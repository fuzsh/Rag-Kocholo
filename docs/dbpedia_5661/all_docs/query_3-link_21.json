        "text": "Britain has found itself in a bit of sticky wicket in the Middle East, where its contradictory promises to the French and the Arabs are now coming home to roost. Today the awkwardness is laid bare when Emir Faisal appears before the Paris Conference to advance the claims of his father, Sharif Hussein of Mecca (self-declared King of the Arabs). Faisal does not speak English, but he has the British intelligence officer T. E. Lawrence to translate for him. Faisal is seeking the Arab kingdom promised to his father, a greater Syria that would stretch from the Anatolian border all the way down to the Arabian peninsula. This unfortunately clashes with French ambitions in the Middle East and the Sykes-Picot agreement on the region’s partition. The French have a particular attachment to the area around Mount Lebanon, where francophile Maronite Christians live, and are keen both to create a larger Lebanese entity under French control and to use this to expand into Syria proper.\n\nAs can be imagined, the French are hostile to Faisal’s presentation. Wilson is curiously indifferent. The British meanwhile are in an embarrassing position. They would like to support their Arab client, but they dare not risk a rupture with France. If they have to choose, then Faisal will be disappointed.\n\nimage source:\n\nEmir Faisal and his delegation. Lawrence is to his right. (Wikipedia: Faisal I of Iraq)\n\nBritain encouraged the Sharif Hussein of Mecca to revolt against the Turks by promising to establish to create an Arab kingdom out of Turkish Syria (the region between Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula). However the British later declared in favour of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine, partly to appeal to Jewish opinion in Britain and the United States. These promises are not entirely consistent with each other (or indeed with other arrangements Britain has reached with France). Now Chaim Weizmann, a leading British Zionist, meets in London with Emir Faisal, son of Sharif Hussain, to see if some kind of accommodation can be reached between then.\n\nWeizmann and Faisal do indeed reach an agreement, signing a document in English (translated for Faisal by T.E. Lawrence, his British advisor). They commit to supporting Jewish immigration into Palestine while acknowledging the rights of Arabs living there and leaving the Muslim Holy Places in Jerusalem under Muslim control. Boundaries between Jewish Palestine and the future Arab state will be demarcated by a commission, while the Zionists commit to advancing the economic development of Arabs living in their area.\n\nFaisal adds one slight addendum in Arabic, affirming that the agreement will be null and void in the event that the promised Arab state fails to be established.\n\nimages:\n\nFaisal and Weizmann at a previous meeting (Wikipedia: the Faisal–Weizmann Agreement)\n\nFaisal & Weizmann’s signatures and Faisal’s caveat (Wikipedia: the Faisal–Weizmann Agreement)\n\nThe people of Damascus are still celebrating their deliverance from Turkish rule, though incidents of looting carried out by Bedouin followers of the Arab army may have dampened the mood somewhat. Now Emir Faisal arrives, intent on staking his father’s claim to the city as capital of the Arab kingdom promised by the British. After riding triumphantly into the city on horseback, he meets Allenby in the Victoria Hotel. The two have not met previously. It is not a meeting of equals, Allenby disabusing Faisal of any notions he might have developed. Faisal is informed that the Balfour Declaration means that Palestine is outside his father’s domain, while Lebanon will be coming under French control in line with the Sykes-Picot agreement. The flag of Sharif Hussein, Faisal’s father, can continue to fly in Damascus, but so long as the war continues all formerly Turkish territory will be effectively under British military control.\n\nimage source:\n\nEmir Faisal and General Allenby (Syrian History)\n\nThe success of Allenby‘s offensive against the Turks has led to a collapse of their position in Palestine and Syria. Having cleared the Turks out of northern Palestine and seized the Transjordan town of Amman, British and Commonwealth forces are pressing on towards Damascus, the centre of Turkish power in the Levant. Also racing towards Damascus are Arab followers of Sharif Hussein of Mecca, self-declared King of the Arabs; these men are a mix of regular troops and Bedouin tribesmen who have attached themselves to the cause of the Arab Revolt. Hussein himself is an old man and has remained in southern Arabia, but his son Faisal is with the Arab army.\n\nSharif Hussein hopes to establish an Arab kingdom with Damascus as its capital; he knows that in the Sykes-Picot agreement the British have promised Syria to the French, but he hopes that if his followers can establish themselves in Damascus then facts on the ground will trump past agreements. Travelling with Faisal is the British liaison officer T.E. Lawrence, who is personally supportive of Arab ambitions versus those of the French.\n\nIn the end the first Allied troops to reach Damascus are a party of Australian cavalrymen who find that the Turks have abandoned the city. The leading citizens of Damascus have already taken down all Turkish flags and replaced them with emblems of Sharif Hussein. The British decide to hush up news of the Australians’ being the first into Damascus. For now the ambitions of Sharif Hussein and his son must be pandered to, so the British prepare for Faisal’s men to make a grand triumphant entrance to the city at which they will they formally receive the surrender of Damascus from the local notables.\n\nThanks to a steady inflow of British arms and money the Arab Revolt is now pretty secure in its dominance of the Hejaz region of the Arabian Peninsula. The Turks still have a garrison in place in Medina but it is unable to contest control of the region with the rebels. British aeroplanes are bombing the railway line to Medina, keeping the Turks there too undersupplied to bother the Arabs.\n\nTo the discomfiture of his British patrons, Emir Hussein of Mecca has declared himself King of the Arabs. Now his son Faisal prepares to extend his father’s writ north into Syria. He sends his cousin Nasir ibn Ali and other trusted associates to reconnoitre the region. They are to make contact with the rural tribesmen and also with the Arab nationalists in Damascus.\n\nTravelling with Faisal’s men is British intelligence officer T.E. Lawrence, who has been liaising between Faisal and the British in Cairo. Lawrence has become sympathetic to the Arab cause. By now Lawrence is aware of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, in which Britain and France agreed to divide the Middle East between them. Lawrence dislikes the French and hopes to assist Faisal in staking a claim to Syria before the French are able to establish themselves there.\n\nimage source:\n\nT.E. Lawrence (Wikipedia)\n\nThe revolt in western Arabia has taken over much of the Hejaz region. British aid is flowing in through coastal ports. Emir Faisal is now trying to turn his tribal host into something approximating to a modern army. He has recruited Arab officers captured as prisoners of war from the Turks to provide the nucleus of an officer corps for his army. Many of these are natives of Mesopotamia and had a prior involvement in secret Arab nationalist organisations.\n\nThe Turks retain one outpost in the Hejaz, the city of Medina. Fahreddin Pasha holds this for the Ottoman Empire and is determined not to abandon it. His garrison is too strong for the rebels to attack him there. While they have attacked the railroad to Medina, the rebels have not been able to completely sever Fahreddin’s supply lines.\n\nWith Medina unassailable, Feisal now begins to think of expanding his operations elsewhere. Perhaps the time has come for the rebels to start moving northwards into Syria.\n\nimage sources:\n\nArab troops (Wikipedia)\n\nThe Medina railroad (Wikipedia)\n\nBritain is supplying the Arab rebels through the Red Sea port of Yanbu. However the sea route there from Suez is long. If the rebels were to establish themselves in the port of Wajh, further north, it would be much easier to supply them. Wajh is also well situated to launch further attacks on the railway line to Medina, where a strong Turkish force remains in place.\n\nThe rebels and the British decide to launch a combined attack on Wajh. Emir Faisal, son of Sharif Hussein, rebel leader and self-styled King of the Arabs, will attack by land. The British navy supports his advance by placing water tanks south of the town to slake the thirst of Faisal’s army. The British will also land a small force of Arabs and British marines to the north of Wajh, to block any Turkish reinforcements.\n\nToday is the agreed date for the attack on Wajh. The British ships arrive and land their men to the north of the town. There is no sign of Faisal, but the small advance party of rebels attack the town anyway. The Arabs are lucky: most of the Turkish garrison has already been withdrawn. Those that remain either surrender or retreat into the town’s mosque and fort, but they are soon dislodged by British naval artillery. Wajh is now in rebel hands.\n\nAnd where is Faisal? The emir has been using his march to impress tribal leaders with the size of his army, thereby encouraging them to join his rebellion. When news of Wajh’s fall begins to circulate, the tribesmen flock to offer Faisal their allegiance.\n\nArabs supporting Sharif Hussein of Mecca are in revolt against their Turkish masters. Fahreddin Pasha however is seeking to crush the revolt. He has led a strong force against the rebel-held port of Yanbu. If Yanbu falls it will be harder for the British to supply the rebels with arms and gold.\n\nThe rebel forces opposing Fahreddin are commanded by Faisal, Sharif Hussein’s son. They are able to delay the Turks but are too weak to halt them. They retreat to Yanbu to make a last stand. Fahreddin advances, hoping that storming the port will be the first step towards victory over the rebels.\n\nBut a nasty surprise awaits Fahreddin when he reaches Yanbu. Five British warships are achored off Yanbu. Their guns outclass anything Fahreddin has at his disposal, forcing him to abandon his plans to assault the town. He accepts defeat and withdraws back towards Medina.\n\nThe British warships’ presence at Yanbu is no coincidence. Captain T. E. Lawrence, a British intelligence officer, had been with Faisal when he first confronted Fahreddin. Realising the rebels’ danger, Lawrence raced back to Yanbu and summoned the British ships, saving the Arab Revolt. Now the rebels make plans to go on the offensive.\n\nSharif Hussein of Mecca is leading an Arab Revolt against his Turkish masters. The rebels have secured Mecca itself, the vital port of Jeddah, and much of the Hejaz region. However the Turks remain in place in Medina.\n\nThe tough Turkish general Fahreddin Pasha hopes to crush the rebels, showing other disloyal elements what happens to those who defy the Ottoman Empire. Hussein’s son Faisal leads a rebel field force, based at Hamra in the hills near the port of Rabigh. Fahreddin’s men attack Faisal, whose tribal followers are no match for the Turkish regulars. Faisal is thrown back. Now Rabigh is threatened, with the rebels and their British allies wondering if the Turks will now be able to roll over Arab forces holding the ports that connect them to the outside world.\n\nThe threat to the Arab ports puts the British in a tricky situation. The defeat of the rebellion would be a disaster, but they are wary of sending their own soldiers to assist the rebels. But what can they do?\n\nIn Cairo British officials turn for advice to Captain T. E. Lawrence, an intelligence officer who visited Faisal in October. Lawrence warns against sending British soldiers into Arabia, as this will convince the Arabs that Britain is planning to take over the region. Instead he suggests providing the Arab rebels with aerial support and technical assistance, and with gold. The support of many of the rebels for Hussein’s cause is conditional and must continuously be paid for. Providing him with gold will allow him to maintain his supporters in the field and attract new supporters.\n\nLawrence’s advice reassures the British. They are short of troops but they have plenty of gold. So they plan to keep the money flowing in the hope that the rebellion can be kept alive.\n\nOutside Medina the Emir of Mecca’s sons Ali and Faisal lead rebels who are skirmishing with the town’s Turkish garrison. Now in Mecca itself their father decides to formally join the revolt against the Turks. Sharif Hussein takes up an antique rifle and fires from his palace at Mecca’s Turkish army barracks. This begins a battle for control of the holy city fought by Hussein’s supporters and the Turkish garrison.\n\nElsewhere Hussein’s other supporters and kinsmen prepare for action. Bedouin horsemen move on Jeddah, the Red Sea port. Hussein’s son Abdullah plans an assault on Ta’if, where the Turkish governor of the Hejaz region is based. Abdullah’s men have already cut the telegraph cables into Ta’if and are preventing couriers from entering or leaving.\n\nGiven the defeats the British have suffered at Gallipoli and Mesopotamia, it might seem strange that Sharif Hussein has now decided to revolt against the Turks. His would-be nationalist allies in Syria are cowed by Djemal’s reign of terror and are unlikely to rally to him. But Hussein knows the Turks are aware of his intrigues with the British. He fears that they will depose or murder him sooner or later.\n\nFor their part, the British are glad to have Hussein formally on their side. His credentials as the guardian of Islam’s holiest sites undercuts the Turkish Sultan’s declaration of Jihad against the Allies. And they do not consider their alliance with Hussein as conflicting with their secret treaty with the French to carve up the Middle East into French and British spheres of influence.\n\nimage source:\n\nSharif Hussein bin Ali (Dying Splendor of the Old World)"
