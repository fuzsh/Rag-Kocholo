        "text": "Nasirâ€™s work is directly involved and specialized in the design and implementation of various control and mechatronics systems in the mechanical and renewable energy fields. Current research efforts are toward the developments of an innovative cooling methods for photovoltaics systems, where he granted several funds from the IAU-DSR. His previous research areas also include proximity maneuvers and vision-based navigation for electromagnetic formation flight, in which the work was supported in part by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). In addition, characterization as well as investigation of potential applications for Nitinol smart materials as a complex servo actuator in biomimetic for facial muscles. Dr. Hariri also participated and received several certificates and awards including 1st place winner of a Master Student Paper competition for the biomedical track in the ASME-IMECE 2015 International Conference in Houston, USA. As well as entrepreneurial-lead certificate in a highly selective Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program from National Science Foundation (NSF) in Dallas, USA, and a member in the honor society of Phi Kappa Phi."
