        "text": "Congratulations are in order for Princess Aisha bint Faisal of Jordan as the niece of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania has announced her engagement to Kareem Yazeed Al-Mufti.\n\nPrincess Aisha celebrated the occasion in traditional Jordanian style – a family ceremony attended by her uncle King Abdullah II, her cousins His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein Bin Abdullah II and Prince Ashem Bin Abdullah, and her father, His Royal Highness Prince Faisal bin Al Hussein.\n\nAisha is the younger sister of Prince Omar and Princess Ayah, and is also the identical twin of Princess Sara. Her mother is Princess Alia Tabbaa.\n\nRead More\n\nKing Charles is ‘keener than ever’ to heal the rift with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and will ‘never be content’ with how little he sees his grandchildren, source claims\n\nThe King has had a packed schedule with the recent D-Day commemorations, but insiders report that he's hoping to foster a closer bond with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet\n\nHer new fiancé has long enjoyed a close relationship with the Jordanian royal family. Al-Mufti studied at the King’s Academy, a co-ed boarding school in Madaba-Manja alongside Crown Prince Hussein. The two were also classmates at Georgetown University in Washington DC, where the Crown Prince studied international history.\n\nPrincess Aisha bint Faisal is no stranger to higher education herself, holding a Master’s degree in Religion, Law, and Society from the University of Westminster. The 27-year-old is also quite the advocate for social change. She has worked for the Generations For Peace scheme, a ‘non-profit peace building entity’ set up by her father, and has published two academic papers on the prison system before she completed her Master’s degree.\n\nIf their most recent of weddings is anything to go by, The Hashemites know how to celebrate in style. Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa were married in a stunning ceremony last summer, which was the biggest wedding of 2023. Some of the world’s most influential names travelled to Jordan for the royal spectacular, including the Prince and Princess of Wales; Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi; First Lady of the United States, Dr Jill Biden; Queen Sofia of Spain; and the Sultan and Prince of Brunei. King Frederik and Queen Mary were also in attendance, a pair who have been at the forefront of royal discussions this year, since Frederik’s mother Queen Margrethe’s shock abdication on New Year’s Eve."
