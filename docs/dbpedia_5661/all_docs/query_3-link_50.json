        "text": "-RJ starts its fleet modernization plan with two Embraer 195-E2\n\n-Majali: New fleet of aircraft, new destinations, promoting Jordan as a tourist destination, and positive earnings are the highlights of the coming phase\n\n-RJ reveals its new livery, new era of creativity starts\n\n-Majali: New, modern livery is reveled; Jordanian identity maintained\n\n-Fleet modernization plan entails: Nine Boeing 787s, 20 Airbus and 8 Embraer aircraft\n\nAmman, Jan. 25, 2024 - Under the patronage of His Royal Highness Prince Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, the first two Embraer E195-E2, out of the planned eight such aircraft, joined the RJ fleet to serve the short- and medium-range routes.\n\nPrince Faisal toured the aircraft and was briefed by RJ Vice Chairman/CEO Samer Majali about the features of this type of aircraft that will be an important enabler of growth, which is part of RJ’s plan in the Levant, by making it possible to increase frequencies to current markets, thus offering passengers more choices, and due to its high operating and fuel efficiency.\n\nMajali spoke about RJ’s fleet modernization plan and the fact that the airline will operate 41 planes in the coming few years.\n\nIn its 60th year, RJ enters an era of modernity and development with the introduction of eight Embraer 195 and 190-E2 regional aircraft, narrow-body A320 neo aircraft and wide-body Boeing 787-9. It will also expand its route network and reach new destinations, to reach 60 points around the world.\n\nMajali expressed optimism for the coming stage on RJ’s journey, including that it will get back to profitability, despite the current regional situation.\n\nAccording to Majali, following extensive feasibility studies, RJ selected Embraer’s E2 as the best fit for its financial objectives and network strategy. These aircraft significantly reduce the investment cost of pilot training and spare parts provisioning, while also making crew scheduling easier and lowering maintenance costs.\n\nHe pointed out that Royal Jordanian has reinvented its livery, making it more modern and youthful without changing the main elements of RJ’s identity, which are proudly displayed on its aircraft. The new design will gradually be rolled out to the rest of the fleet, presenting a more modern design and colors that signal the beginning of a new era of creativity.\n\nRoyal Jordanian has always named its planes after Jordanian cities, in a bid to promote the country as a tourist destination; the new aircraft bear the names of the cities of Ramtha and Ma’an.\n\nThe E2 regional jets provide next generation environmental efficiency, and customers will discover a relaxed atmosphere and comfortable seating, while enjoying Wi-Fi connection during their flight."
