        "text": "Iraq: Bronze Commemorative Medal for the Coronation of King Faisal II. On the obverse: The head of King Faisal II On the reverse: The crowned cipher of King Faisal II, the dates \"1372 - 1953\", the inscription \"Towija Sanah\" (Coronation year) in Arabic numerals and characters. Signed and maker marked: \"Huguenin\" (for Huguenin Freres, La Locle, Switzerland). The medal was issued in 2 classes (silver and bronze) to commemorate the coronation of King Faisal II ibn Ghazi on 2 May 1953. It was produced by the British Royal Mint and by Huguenin Freres, in very small numbers and with small differences between the 2 types. King Faisal II (1935-1958) was the last king of Iraq, reigning typically from 1939 (he was 4 years old when his father died in 1939 and Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah, ruled as Regent until 1953, when Faisal came to age and officially assumed reign). Faisal II died following a military coup d’état in 1958, led by Abd al-Karim Qasim. The medal is rare. A nice, genuine example of a heavily copied medal. FULL SIZE Feisal II Reign 1953 - 1958 Item 100% original - without ribbon Condition as on the photos GREAT ADDITION TO EVERY COLLECTION! Payment method: Paypal FREE SIGNED FOR SHIPPING"
