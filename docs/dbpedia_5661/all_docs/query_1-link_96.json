        "text": "The jihadist group which controls large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq is sometimes referred to by different names by English-speaking governments and media.\n\nWhen talking about the group - which has also spawned affiliates elsewhere in the Middle East, Africa and Asia - UN and US officials generally use the acronym \"Isil\", the acronym of \"Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant\".\n\nThe group itself has not used that name since June 2014 when it declared the creation a caliphate and shortened its name to \"Islamic State\" (IS) to reflect its expansionist ambitions.\n\nSince then, BBC News has been using that term, but qualifying it as \"Islamic State group\" or \"self-styled Islamic State\" and shortening it to \"IS\" on subsequent mentions.\n\nOther media have continued to use \"Isil\" or \"Isis\", which is based on the other widely used translations of the group's former name - \"Islamic State in Iraq and Syria\" or \"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham\".\n\nBut the term \"Daesh\" (or Da'ish) has also gained currency, both in the Middle East and further afield, and has been used as a way of challenging the legitimacy of the group due to the negative connotations of the word.\n\nDaesh is essentially an Arabic acronym formed from the initial letters of the group's previous name in Arabic - \"al-Dawla al-Islamiya fil Iraq wa al-Sham\". Although it does not mean anything as a word in Arabic, it sounds unpleasant and the group's supporters object to its use.\n\nDaesh also sounds similar to an Arabic verb that means to tread underfoot, trample down, or crush something.\n\nAl-Sham can be translated variously as \"the Levant\", \"Greater Syria\", \"Syria\" or even \"Damascus\".\n\nThe term al-Sham was commonly used during the rule of the Muslim Caliphs from the 7th Century to describe the area between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates, Anatolia (in present day Turkey) and Egypt.\n\nIt was used until the first half of the 20th Century, when Britain and France drew the new borders of the Middle East and created nation states.\n\nThe term \"Levant\" had for centuries been used by English speakers to describe the eastern part of the Mediterranean, with its islands and the countries adjoining.\n\nAfter World War One, the colonial powers understood it to be the area comprising what is now Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian Territories and part of south-eastern Turkey.\n\nHowever, the term's colonial association means it would be unlikely to be endorsed by the jihadists. They would also probably object to using just \"Syria\", as it suggests their aspirations are limited to the modern state's borders. Various experts have therefore said that the word al-Sham should not be translated."
