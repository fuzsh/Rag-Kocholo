        "text": "The Royal Democratic Alliance, headed by pretender to Iraq's throne Prince Raad bin Zaid, has announced plans for a shadow government to run the country.\n\nNabil al-Janabi, RDA secretary general, says the US-led coalition has proved incapable of running the country since ousting Saddam Hussein's regime on April 9.\n\n\"If the coalition is incapable of meeting the legitimate demands of the Iraqi people, the RDA has the necessary capacities to form a shadow government to run the country and provide security and stability,\" Mr Janabi said.\n\nMr Janabi, representing Prince Raad who is still abroad, says the shadow government would help settle urgent matters, in coordination with the administration of US overseer Paul Bremer.\n\n\"The United States carries a big part of the responsibility for the slow manner in which they fulfil their commitments and the promises they made to the Iraqi people,\" Mr Janabi said.\n\nMr Janabi has also challenged Al-Shareef Ali bin al-Hussein, another pretender to Iraq's throne, to \"prove his lineage\" to the royal family in Iraq.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1958, Iraq was ruled by three descendents of the Shareef Hussein of Mecca, who led the Arab revolt against the Ottomans at the start of the last century.\n\nIraq's three kings were Faisal I (1922-1933), Ghazi I (1933-1939) and Faisal II (1939-1958).\n\nPrince Raad, 67, lives in Jordan and is King Ghazi's first cousin."
