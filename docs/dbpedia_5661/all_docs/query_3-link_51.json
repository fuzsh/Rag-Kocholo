His Royal Highness Prince Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, of The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, is the honored guest of Gov. John W. Hickenlooper for a national security forum entitled “Crisis & Clarity in the Middle East.” The discussion includes Ambassador Dennis Ross, Middle East policy adviser to five U.S. presidents, and is moderated by Catherine Herridge, award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for Fox News Channel. The event, held in Denver March 13, 2018, is part of the Counterterrorism Education Learning Lab’s global security speaker series.\nJordan and Colorado became partners through the National Guard State Partnership Program in 2004. By linking U.S. states with designated partner countries, the SPP supports geographic combatant commands by building long-term military relationships, improving interoperability, and enhancing military capabilities and the principles of responsible governance. Over the past 14 years, the Soldiers and Airmen of the Colorado National Guard have engaged with their Jordanian counterparts in a variety of areas to include aviation, disaster preparedness and crisis management, human resource development, and many more.\nIn addition to the Colorado-Jordan partnership, Faisal, Ross and Herridge addressed current security concerns in the Middle East and the implications for both the U.S. and Jordan. They examined pressing issues on combating terrorism in the region, and the geopolitical landscape related to Syria, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n(U.S. Air National Guard Photo by Maj.
