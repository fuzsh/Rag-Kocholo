Summer Cohen (n√©e Roberts) is one of the main characters of The O.C., she is portrayed by Rachel Bilson.

Summer initially was the classic spoiled girl from Newport, who only cared about three things : shopping, boys and parties. Although initially may appear a bit superficial, hers is just a mask that hides her insecurities and her doubts. In fact, when she grew up, she did not have an important female figure besides her mother, who left without any explanation. She has been best friends with Marissa Cooper since childhood.

Raised by a single father, she has built around herself the figure of the girl superficial and immature, to defend themselves from what people could think of her and her family. Slowly, however, also thanks to her love affair with Seth Cohen (who has always been in love with her) and her friendship with Ryan Atwood-Cohen, she changed her way of being, remaining, however, always true to herself.

In the fourth season, she left behind the old part of herself, that frivolous and immature, and became a committed animal rights activist and person who thinks it is better to give to others than to keep everything for herself. In fact, she was no longer the spoiled girl she once was. Her character maturation was fundamental part of her life, and helped her bloom like a flower.

Personality[]

Summer is definitely one of those girls not to be messed about with. Some people think she's crossed between Darth Vader and a Vampire but the truth is she's definitely one for the boys. Despite her stunning looks, Summer has aged growing up from a teen into an attractive, ravishing and dazzling young woman.

The only things that initially interested her were parties, boys, and how to find a rich man who she would then marry, of course only for his money. Her personality (self-centered, superficial and "hysterical") was just a way to hide all her insecurities and fears. However, thanks to her love for Seth, her way of approaching others and the world will change. In fact, you know well that to please the guys in Newport, you must "behave in a certain way", and avoid ‚Äúthose like Cohen", considered by the boys of the elite, only losers.
