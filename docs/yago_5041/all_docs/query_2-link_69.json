I'm sure I am not the first person to ever analyze just how deep they run.\n\nGarry's convinced that it's effectively the same show/story, set in NYC instead of Orange County. I maintain that GG has way more delicious scandal and better characters, but gotta admit the resemblances are a bit creepy. So I decided to make a few diptychs (or triptychs) to compare the characters side by side.\n\nRyan Atwood vs. Dan Humphrey vs. Seth Cohen. Garry's got a point - if Ryan and Seth had a love-child, Dan would be the result.\n\nKirsten Cohen vs. Lily Van der Woodsen. They are so alike in appearance and character, I can barely tell them apart!\n\nSummer Roberts vs. Blair Waldorf. Both dark-hair beauties, but Summer's more adorable and Blair's more badass.\n\nSerena van der Woodsen vs. Marissa Cooper. No contest. Serena is as awesome and vivacious as Marissa is vapid and vacant.\n\nSandy Cohen vs. Rufus Humphrey. Garry says they look alike and I think they don't at all! Maybe the only resemblence is that both of them at one point sang in a band.\n\nNate Archibald vs. Luke Ward vs. Chuck Bass. No apparent connection except their all moneyed \"bad\" boys. And they look pretty good.\n\n15 responses\n\n4 visitors upvoted this post."
