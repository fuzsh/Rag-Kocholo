        "text": "If prior to coming to California I would have made a list of all the things I really wanted to see and would have prioritized the items according to how badly I wanted to see them, this would have with no doubt and no consideration whatsoever been top of the list – and after getting the chance to finally seeing it –\n\nwell deserved so.\n\nYou might be able to guess my excitement when I finally knew I was gonna go to Redondo Beach, which is where “The O.C.” shot their Pier and Diner, as well as the Sandy Cohen office and\n\nsome of the lifeguard tower scenes.\n\nLuckily I had Isabella accompanying me since she saw the show as well and we were planning on spending the day up in LA anyway. So after having a deliciously typical Orange County style breakfast at the Rose Bakery, a place I have been walking by on my way to work for the last two months without ever having breakfast there, we were on our way up PCH (the Pacific Coast Highway).\n\nConsidering this was one of the most exciting trips I had taken so far, I had to let Isabella know that she was about to see like the craziest version of myself that day, and that she should be aware that I was gonna freak out and have her take like a hundred pictures of me and she just laughed – I guess she didn’t know what she was in for yet – but she would soon find out.\n\nFirst of all, when you get to Redondo Beach, all you recognize are those triangle shaped Pier applications and the building that is known as the Bait shop on the show. But then walking by those cute little Pier shops it starts to hit you and you feel like you’re in the middle of what you’ve been seeing over and over again while watching the show and it’s like Seth Cohen must be right around the corner on his Skateboard.\n\nI remember being sort of surprised of that first impression because I imagined the place to be a lot less authentic, just like another go-to tourist spot but the whole atmosphere on the Pier is so Orange County, so local and real with the smell of fried fish, the sight of local fishermen with their folding chairs and the view of sail boats in the distance – and if Seth was not around the corner,\n\nhe sure must have been on one of those!\n\nNow imagine that whole first impression, multiply it by a gazillion and you’ll know what it’s like when getting that first glimpse of THE Diner, approaching the door and stepping into the place as if Summer and Marissa had just left it on their way to the beach. There really are no words and again, it was one of those moments where I just stood there not even thinking about getting my camera out and cherishing that very moment with tears in my eyes (I’m just being honest), the biggest smile on my face and another one of those once-in-a-lifetime feelings. Some might not get why I go so crazy on something that seems so “lame”, and I kept asking myself why it would strike me so intensely, but then I got it and I talked about it in one of my earlier posts. There is something about those moments when something we have been wishing for and dreaming of for a long time becomes reality. And honestly, those of you who know a thing or two about me might be aware that I have had a couple of times in my life where some of my biggest dreams got crushed badly and I had no control whatsoever over what was happening. So yes, these dream-come-true moments are more of a “recent” thing to me which must be why I’m experiencing them so intensely. This black and white milkshake that Summer Roberts used to have in that Diner made my day and the whole week after and I’m still smiling by typing these words and thinking about it. Because it was a dream come true – sometimes it’s the small things that mean the world to you.\n\nSo well, while I’m being so personal and honest, after those first couple of seconds passed, I went right back to the crazy tourist picture taking kind of person who annoyed the hell out of the poor waitress who must have been taking pictures of people for however many years she was working there but – I couldn’t care at that moment. There were only a handful of people in there and it was exactly the small little local place it is displayed as in the show.\n\nNow that I gave everyone a pretty vivid idea of what it was like to experience the OC places in real life, I’m just gonna attach some more pictures of strolling around the Pier, the Sandy Cohen lawyer office and the Marissa Cooper view from the lifeguard tower that was no less of an excitement as was all the rest.\n\nI’m really glad I finally got some time to sit down and write about the O.C., California experience since I have been putting it off for two weeks now. It’s a Friday morning and it’s my day off from work since I started to work from Sundays to Thursdays. The plan was to go to Starbucks early in the morning, try one of those Christmas blend Eggnogg Latte’s and write at least three different blog posts about all the things I have been putting off until now. But, somewhere in between the second half of this story and thinking about getting another coffee I decided to leave it at that and assuring you that I’m trying to do a better job on keeping you updated.\n\nSo, just to let you know, there is something coming up about the Sailing Lessons I have been taking, as well as my weekend in San Diego aaaaand the Lakers Game at the Staples Center last week. Also, my dear and deeply missed Melanie finally booked her flight to California for the end of December and we’re currently planning a roadtrip from Dallas to LA in early January and I’m having a blast by just the thought of it."
