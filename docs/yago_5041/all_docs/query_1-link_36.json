        "text": "It is a very big day for alumni of The O.C. Seth Cohen has a child, and Ryan Atwood is going to have one soon! Erm, Adam Brody has a child, and Benjamin McKenzie is going to have one soon! Yes, Seth and Blair Waldorf (Brody and wife Leighton Meester) welcomed their first child last week, per Us Weekly. And that’s . . . all the information we have, as the couple has not revealed the gender of the child or the name. (This seems very Blair, doesn’t it? You can imagine Seth mumbling, “We can’t even post an Instagram?!?” “No, Seth—everyone will know what they need to know at the right time. Dorota!”)\n\nMeanwhile, in far juicier news, McKenzie is expecting a child with Morena Baccarin, his co-star on Gotham, whom you know best, probably, as Mrs. Jessica Brody from Homeland. Yes, Mrs. Brody and the man whom most millennials would think of first if you barked “white tank top!” at them are a couple. Per Us Weekly, the pair are “dating and living together,” and according to TMZ, there is some drama worthy of a Josh Schwartz drama related to their relationship. TMZ reports that Baccarin is going to be appearing in court today—as part of her divorce case with estranged husband Austin Chick—where she will be making the revelation that she is pregnant with McKenzie’s child. She is looking for joint custody of her one-year-old son with Chick, though she is asking for him to move to New York, where she films Gotham. (McKenzie and Baccarin attended the Emmy Awards together on Sunday night.)\n\nWhat does Marissa Cooper think about all this news? We imagine she rolled over slightly on her chaise lounge at an Ibiza hotel, grunting, “Who are Seth and Ryan again?” Summer Roberts? She probably has stalked Seth’s wife on Instagram so many times that it’s the first URL that auto-fills when she types i-n-s-t in her browser, but we also think she’s very happy for Seth, and already has a slew of baby gifts ready to roll out the door. Blair has probably sent Serena van Der Woodsen a series of “Ummmm hello? I had a baby!!!! How come you aren’t responding?!?!?” texts. (Serena lost her phone a week ago and hasn’t even realized it.) And Julie Cooper is probably—actually, we are going to stop now, before this gets too weird (because it definitely hasn’t gotten too weird yet!).\n\nUpdate: Us Weekly is reporting that Brody and Meester had a daughter, which they named the very Cohen-y Arlo Day.\n\nPreviously: Ryan and Trey Atwood Are Starting a Production Company Together\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Morning Show Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nTwo Oscar winners are joining the already starry cast for season four, which must answer a lot of major questions: “Everybody keeps asking me if Bradley’s in jail,” Reese Witherspoon says.\n\nAward Season\n\nBaby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning Never Saw Martha as a Villain\n\n“She’s so much more than that,” says the newly minted Emmy nominee of her breakout role in the Netflix hit series.\n\nHollywood\n\nIndustry Season 3 Is Dark, Addictive, and Filled With “Beautiful Fuckups”\n\nCreators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay open up about new cast member Kit Harington, Succession/Industry overlap, and the odds that their cult HBO drama gets a fourth season.\n\nTelevision\n\nKim Cattrall Shuts Down Rumors She's Returning to Sex and the City Revival Series\n\nIn a post on X, Cattrall maintained that Samantha Jones will not be returning for season three of And Just Like That.\n\nTelevision\n\nJohn Oliver Called JD Vance’s Campaign to Ask If He’d Ever Had Sex With a Couch\n\nAfter a joke about Vance’s (fictional) fondness for futons went viral, the Last Week Tonight host added his voice to the chorus: “If you ask me to draw a man that f--ks his couch, 10 times out of 10, I’m drawing this guy.”\n\nCelebrity\n\nMelania Trump, Utterly Silent on So Much Else, Plans to Tell Us Allllll About Her “Extraordinary Life”\n\nThe former FLOTUS will share a publisher with RFK Jr. and Alan Dershowitz for her tell-some memoir.\n\nCelebrity\n\nOprah Winfrey and Gayle King: “If We Were Gay, We’d Tell You”\n\nThey’ve been friends for nearly half a century, and, yeah, they’ve heard the rumors.\n\nCelebrity\n\nMontel Williams Once Dated Kamala Harris and Now His Social Media Is a Big Mess\n\nThe former TV host’s social media feed has been a real journey in retweeting and deleting.\n\nCelebrity\n\nKarlie Kloss Is Still a Swiftie, Thanks\n\nThe philanthropist and model loves the entirety of The Tortured Poets Department, and told an interviewer that Taylor Swift's “music is classic.”"
