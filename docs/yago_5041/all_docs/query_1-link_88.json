        "text": "We all have a TV boyfriend. For some it was Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) from Beverly Hills, 90210, or Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) from The Office, or in recent times, Nick Miller (Jake Johnson) from New Girl. Mine, and I know I’m not alone on this one, was Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) from The O.C.. The adorable, witty geek is what some might call my “type.” But has he inadvertently ruined that “type”?\n\nSeth Cohen was too good to be true, a teenage boy that was sweet and vulnerable with an unabashed love for comic books. Oh, and he was super cute too. That always helps. He was shy about his years-long crush on Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson) at first, but then became known for his grand romantic gestures. Why is that guy such a rare commodity?\n\nHave you ever witnessed a guy jumping up on a coffee cart to profess his love for a girl, especially one he knows is a little bit out of his league? You have if you watched season 1, episode 20, “The Telenovela.” Has a dude ever named a boat after you? If the answer is yes to that, well, that’s really cool for you. Seth’s lifetime of being bullied and made fun of by the popular kids at school provided him a “nothing to lose” attitude when it came to making a big move or revealing feelings. How refreshing! A man who is open about his feelings and not trying to act all macho for once. In Seth we also see someone who doesn’t give up on his feelings. He spent more time over the course of The O.C.’s four seasons chasing after Summer than he actually spent being in a relationship with her. Would many of us have thrown the term “stalker” on him? Yes, probably at some point. But he always knew how to redeem himself.\n\nNow, before we get much further, let’s address that Seth wasn’t perfect. He was a confused teen boy at the heart of it all, and one that made several romantic mistakes. In season 1, he strung along Summer and Anna (Samaire Armstrong) at the same time and ultimately hurt them more by not just being honest. He probably did care for both of them and surely loved the rare attention he was getting from not one, but two beautiful ladies. But it was a dick move. When his BFF Ryan (Ben McKenzie) ran away, Seth chased after him, hurting Summer once again. Oh, it doesn’t end there. In season 2 upon his return, he made many, many attempts to get her back, even though she had moved on and was happy in her new relationship with Zach (Michael Cassidy). Season 3 finds the semi-happy couple faced with the news that Seth was not admitted to Brown for college, but Summer surprisingly was. After she’s the one who gets up on the coffee cart, he is able to look her in the face and say he doesn’t love her. Gasp! Who would ever? Sure it might be for her own good, so that she goes off to college and does her own thing, but damn! There wasn’t a better way to do that?\n\nBut here’s the real damage he’s done: we analyze text messages and Instagram comments from the men in our lives, hoping that they are secretly a Seth. “Maybe he’s just too shy to ask me out,” or “Maybe he’ll make a romantic gesture in public,” or “Maybe we’ll sail away to Tahiti in a boat he named after me.” Please don’t hold out hope for that last one though. But is it my fault I’m charmed by Seth’s romantic moves, both big and small? If so many women find Seth’s actions so swoon-worthy, why don’t men take note and try to emulate him? Step your game up, bros! If this indie music-loving geek figured out how to make a gal feel special, you surely can too.\n\nI recently spoke to The O.C. creator, writer and executive producer Josh Schwartz, who had this to offer on where Seth comes from, and if he was inspired by real life events or conceived as more of a wish fulfillment character? “It was a combo. The character of Seth was my way into the show. As a Jewish kid from the East Coast coming to USC in Southern California, I felt very much like a fish out of water. That’s where my first encounter with Orange Country people was, where I first heard it referred to as The O.C., even though Orange County people claim they never said that, I heard it. But having that character who you wouldn’t normally expect to find on a teen drama on Fox who can be a little more self-aware, that was certainly for me a way in. Certain attributes or characteristics he had were probably were reflective of mine at the time, combined with getting to be played by Adam Brody which automatically made it wish fulfillment for me, because Adam was the funnier better looking version. So that was a good vessel. Adam was not neurotic, and I don’t even think Jewish. He’s a surfer from southern California, but he pulled it off beautifully. And Adam was cool and he had a great, fun attitude about it and really brought the character to life, so it felt like a really good marriage of actor and material.”\n\nThere is no one like Seth Cohen, mostly because he is a fictional character. And while his romantic acts of love are fun to watch…they might be kind of embarrassing if they actually happened to you with dozens of gawking strangers around. Just let me tell myself that. But learn from him and apply it to your own relationships. Know that you want someone who doesn’t string you along, and does vocalize his feelings for you. Don’t write off an unpopular nerdy kid, but also don’t expect someone to sweep you off your feet and literally sail you away. And know that when the man in your life lets you down, you can always turn to Seth Cohen."
