        "text": "The Gamble\n\nSummer Roberts: Still hasn’t called you back? He was in lockup. Maybe he’s into dudes now.\n\nSummer: You’re not going anywhere, Sid.\n\nSeth: Seth.\n\nSummer: Whatever.\n\nSeth: Okay.\n\nThe Debut\n\nSummer: These gloves are giving me serious sausage arms.\n\nMarissa: You want me to fix you up with Ryan? I thought you said he was a total psycho.\n\nSummer: Well that was before I got to know him.\n\nMarissa: Wait, when did you get to know him?\n\nSummer: Just now. Plus, then there’s that whole brooding bad boy thing. He’s wounded. I can save him.\n\nSummer: Who’s pathetic enough not to have a date the day before cotillion?\n\nAnna: Actually, at this point that would be you.\n\nThe Outsider\n\n.\n\nThe Girlfriend\n\nSeth: Do you have any idea how pathetic it is to sit there and listen to you babble about mergers and acquisitions while some guy just stares at your boobs?\n\nSummer: Which guy was staring at my boobs?\n\nSeth: Who cares. See, the point is that guy doesn’t know you. He doesn’t care about who you really are. In fact, he has no idea that every day of third grade, you shared your lunch with that little skinny squirrel who kept getting his nuts stolen by that fat squirrel.\n\nSummer: I hated that mean squirrel.\n\nThe Escape\n\nSummer about Ryan: He’s all brooding, wounded, “somebody save me.”\n\nMarissa: I thought you liked that.\n\nSummer: It is too hot to save anyone.\n\nSummer: We should be there in three hours.\n\nSeth: Well the GPS says the ETA is three and a half.\n\nSummer: Well that’s because someone drives like an old woman.\n\nSeth: I’m going 70 in a 65 zone.\n\nSummer: Eighty is the new 70.\n\nSeth: What? Who talks like that?\n\nSummer: Who gets passed by a van full of nuns? Oh, wait, Cohen does!\n\nSeth: Well they have God on their side, Summer, okay? I’m not gonna beat Jesus.\n\nSummer: What is up with the AC? My hair is frizzing out. I look like Howard Stern.\n\nSeth: See strangely I feel like my jewfro benefits from this climate.\n\nSummer: You’re Jewish?\n\nSeth: Yes. That’s why I feel so comfortable in this desert heat.\n\nSummer: This is a nightmare. I’m sweating to death, driving ten miles an hour in, like, a rickshaw, listening to this… music.\n\nSeth: Hey, do not insult Death Cab.\n\nSummer: It’s like one guitar and a whole lot of complaining.\n\nMarissa: Guys, can we try to stay positive here?\n\nSeth: Yeah, well I am positive that this is Summer’s fault.\n\nSummer: I am positive that I’m leaving this place with a rash.\n\nSeth: Oh, so you plan on making some extra money tonight?\n\nSummer: Come on. Get off the bed!\n\nSeth: Nope.\n\nSummer: Be, like, a gentleman?\n\nSeth: Chivalry’s dead, sugar.\n\nSummer get onto the bed\n\nSummer: You make a move, I rip out your jugular.\n\nSeth: Oh hey, pillow talk.\n\nSeth: Think we should have woke Ryan and Marissa?\n\nSummer: No. They looked so cute together. Vomit.\n\nSeth: Hey. That’s a real sentimental streak you’ve got there, Summer.\n\nSummer: Trouser it, Cohen. It’s too early for your so-called comedy.\n\nSeth: You enjoy my comedy. You know what else you enjoy? Me.\n\nSummer: Well that’s because you’re mentally unstable.\n\nSeth: Be that as it may, I think the facts speak for themselves. Might I remind you of a little something that I like to call “The time that you kissed me by the pool at my grandfather’s birthday party.”\n\nSummer: What are you talking about?\n\nSeth: Okay. I know that denial is a very powerful coping mechanism, but I just think, Summer, that it’s time we paid lip service to our lip service.\n\nSummer: Two words: no tongue.\n\nSeth: Well, you did agree to take this little trip with me down Mexico way.\n\nSummer: I needed a ride.\n\nSeth: We shared the same bed.\n\nSummer: I wasn’t going to sleep on that couch. It smelled like these eggs.\n\nSeth: You ate my toast, Summer.\n\nSummer: I like crusts, Seth.\n\nSeth: Face it, our chemistry is undeniable.\n\nSummer: You know what else is undeniable? The pain this fork is going to cause when I jam it into your eye! … I suffer from rage blackouts.\n\nThe Rescue\n\nSeth: Not now Mom. I’m studying naked.\n\nSummer: Ew.\n\nSummer: What is this?\n\nSeth: I don’t know. I’ve never seen it before.\n\nSummer: What’s its name?\n\nSeth: I don’t know… Captain Oats.\n\nRyan: We’ll figure something out.\n\nSummer: Well we better hurry. Because she just escaped from a psych ward wearing a candy striper outfit. If they didn’t think she was crazy before— Sorry.\n\nSeth: So you still think that, after everything that happened today, when we get back to school you’re going to be able to ignore me?\n\nSummer: Well. All I can do is try.\n\nSeth: I admire your will.\n\nThe Heights\n\nJimmy: Okay, so new oven. Haven’t quite figured out how to make French toast.\n\nSummer: “Not in the oven” would be a good place to start.\n\nSeth: So, Summer. If you would care to join me for lunch today I can arrange to have an empty chair available.\n\nSummer: There’s nothing but empty chairs at your table.\n\nAnna Stern: Seth Cohen?\n\nSeth: Anna! Hey, how’re you doing?\n\nSummer: Um, excuse me. We were talking here.\n\nAnna: Oh, so insulting him counts as conversation?\n\nSeth: Yeah, well, if it doesn’t we’ve never spoken.\n\nSeth: Hey Summer. What’s going on?\n\nSummer: Coop’s stuck on the Ferris wheel. And I was looking for someone to go on the Tilt-a-whirl with me.\n\nSeth: I’ll go on it with you.\n\nSummer: Okay. I might vomit.\n\nSeth: I like those odds.\n\nThe Perfect Couple\n\nSeth: Oh I get it. I’m just here for the comic relief.\n\nSeth: But you have before, right? Wow. That’s what I thought. I just didn’t want to jump to conclusions. Because my experience is sort of limited. And?\n\nRyan: And what?\n\nSeth: Was it awesome?\n\nRyan: Which time?\n\nSeth: Ah… There were— I don’t know. How many times were there?\n\nRyan: Same girl or different girls?\n\nSeth: There were different girls? How many different girls were there? Ryan starts counting in his head. I have to sit down.\n\nSeth: So when you lost your virginity, I was playing Magic: The Gathering.\n\nRyan: You still play Magic.\n\nSeth: Yeah, but not as much.\n\nSeth: Summer, I’ll walk you to bio.\n\nSummer: I can walk myself.\n\nSeth: Great. Then you can walk me too.\n\nSeth: So get this: Anna thinks all I ever do is talk about Summer. I mean that’s crazy, right?\n\nRyan: You want me to lie?\n\nSeth: I’m that guy? Dude, how can I be that guy? I hate that guy.\n\nSeth: You and Julie Cooper trapped on a boat, huh? Yeah, can’t wait to see how that one goes.\n\nRyan: I don’t really have a choice, since she’s my girlfriend.\n\nSeth: What? “Girlfriend”? I thought that you didn’t do girlfriends. I mean you did them, but you, you know…\n\nRyan: I don’t. And this is not a good way to start.\n\nSeth: Okay, I promise I’m never going to mention Summer’s name again. Except for that. From now on we will only talk about the things we have in common. Like, how do you feel about Newport charity events, huh?\n\nAnna: I hate them.\n\nSeth: Me too. So what do you say you come with me. We’ll hang out and we’ll just quietly mock people.\n\nSeth: Yo.\n\nAnna: What up, Holmes?\n\nSeth: Chillin’.\n\nAnna: A’ight.\n\nAnna: So, this is your crib? This is where all the magic happens?\n\nSeth: Well, if by magic, you’re referring to the card game, then sadly, yes.\n\nAnna: You have a hot tub. Do you ever use it?\n\nSeth: Hot tub’s for the ho’s. I usually hang in the Grotto.\n\nMarissa: So I’m just going to run to the girls’ room. It’s down the hall, right?\n\nAnna: I gotta go too.\n\nSeth: Right. Because girls can’t pee alone. Ryan rolls his eyes. What? It’s Anna. I could have said “pop a squat” in front of her if I wanted to.\n\nRyan: Sometimes I think you talk just to make sounds.\n\nSeth: Sometimes I do.\n\nSeth: What’s going on here?\n\nSummer: I like Seth Cohen.\n\nSeth: You, ah… you what now?\n\nSummer: Nothing. I wasn’t talking to you.\n\nThe Homecoming\n\nSeth: Mom. Mom, no! No recipes. Put them away.\n\nKirsten: This is Ryan’s first Thanksgiving in the house and we’re going to make this meal as a family.\n\nSeth: Do you know what I dream about when I dream about Thanksgiving, which is often? I dream about eating so much deliciousness that all the blood rushes to my stomach and I pass out at the table. Please don’t deny me that.\n\nRyan: That’s just weird.\n\nSeth: So you should probably be heading out soon.\n\nRyan: I gotta finish the stuffing. Then there’s the gravy, candied yams.\n\nSeth: Yeah, and if you find enough cooking to last three to five years, then Trey’ll be out.\n\nRyan: Trey doesn’t even read comics.\n\nSeth: Yeah, he doesn’t yet, But that’s because he hasn’t seen the new Titans.\n\nRyan: Titans. What about Legion? That was kinda cooler.\n\nSeth: The guy’s in prison, man. Have you seen Oz? I’m sure that’ll be fine. But, yeah. The new Legion is cooler.\n\nSeth: Did you guys hear that Ryan’s funny now.\n\nKirsten: We’re just working away.\n\nSeth: Okay, if by “we” you’re referring to yourself then somebody violated the pact.\n\nKirsten: I am merely opening the wine. A skill I feel very confident about.\n\nSeth: No argument here.\n\nSummer: I just can’t help it.\n\nSeth: Uh uh.\n\nSummer: And I certainly can’t explain it. You didn’t tell anyone?\n\nSeth: Of course not.\n\nSummer: ‘Cause I’ll kill you.\n\nSeth: No, I believe you.\n\nSeth trying to be heard over the blender: Hey, so Marissa’s with Ryan.\n\nKirsten: What?\n\nSeth: I said Marissa’s in Chino.\n\nKirsten: I can’t hear you!\n\nSeth: I said Marissa is in Chino! Wow. That actually happens in real life.\n\nKirsten: What? What did you say?\n\nSeth: Yeah, no. I said that Marissa has my chinos. I love those pants.\n\nCaleb: Looks like we’ll be here awhile. to Kirsten You ready to talk?\n\nKirsten to all: Fresh margs?\n\nRyan: Hey man. What are you doing?\n\nSeth: Not… lying with Captain Oats.\n\nMarissa: Why are you on the floor?\n\nSeth: I figured I’d just end up her anyway so might as well cut out the middleman.\n\nRyan: Well looks like things went pretty well.\n\nSeth: Yeah, same for you. Nice shiner.\n\nMarissa: Yeah. So can we sit with you and Captain Oats?\n\nSeth: Yeah. Please. Hey, nothing says Thanksgiving like Moo Shu Pork. So what’d your brother say?\n\nRyan: Goodbye.\n\nSeth: So Chino was, ah….\n\nRyan: It’s good to be home.\n\nMarissa: Hey. So Seth, did you know that Ryan did musicals?\n\nSeth: Ryan, that’s extremely minty of you. I didn’t even know they had musicals in Chino. I didn’t even\n\nknow they had dancing. Or… laughter.\n\nRyan: That’s because no one who lived there is as funny as you.\n\nSeth: So, we finally agree that I’m the funny one. Well look at that! Looks like we all learned some valuable lessons this Thanksgiving. It’s heartwarming.\n\nThe Secret\n\nSeth: Do I have a fever? I think I might have a fever and/or the chills.\n\nRyan: Since when?\n\nSeth: Since recently.\n\nSandy: So you’re not feeling well?\n\nSeth: No, I feel fine. coughs. Just my head’s a little achy and my stomach’s kind of weird. I’m okay.\n\nSandy: C’mere. feels his forehead. Huh. You don’t feel warm.\n\nSeth: What about cold or clammy?\n\nRyan: Maybe you’ve got the Summer flu.\n\nSeth: Yeah, it’s November, but it’s possible.\n\nRyan: Maybe you need some Anna-biotics.\n\nSeth defiantly: Hey! I’m not afraid of Summer and Anna, alright? *beat* Well, I’m not afraid of Anna.\n\nRyan: So you’re going to school.\n\nSandy: And you’re going to yogalates.\n\nKirsten: You just like saying that.\n\nSandy: Yogalates? I kinda do. To Ryan Yogalates?\n\nRyan: Yogalates.\n\nSeth: You and Luke?\n\nMarissa: I know!\n\nSeth: Holy unholy alliances!\n\nSeth: Hey, I was hoping I’d bump into you. I wanted to ta— Hi Summer. And Anna, hanging out together. Wow. Wow. That’s um, that’s awkward.\n\nAnna: Not really.\n\nSeth: Well I meant for me.\n\nLuke: What are you looking at, queer?\n\nSeth: Is somebody writing you new material? Luke lunges at him. Alright. Go with what works.\n\nRyan: I was just over there. They seemed really happy.\n\nSeth: By “happy” do you mean gay?\n\nKirsten: Seth.\n\nSeth: Yes?\n\nKirsten: Cut it out.\n\nSeth: Let me start by saying nothing in my life, nothing, prepared me for the events of the fateful Thanksgiving Day. But I’m not gonna make any excuses for what I did. I just wanna say one little thing in my defense, which is, you can’t really blame me for wanting the company of either of you two.\n\nAnna: That was so sweet what you said earlier. And I could tell you really meant it. We both know sincerity is not your strong point.\n\nSeth: I’m working on it.\n\nSandy: Hey Seth. Ask your mother who was at the door.\n\nSeth: Mom, who was at the door?\n\nKirsten: Julie Cooper, bearing gifts.\n\nSeth: Julie Cooper, Dad.\n\nLuke: Maybe I can just blow the whole thing off. Go to the beach, give everybody time to get it out of their systems.\n\nRyan: It doesn’t work like that. It’s been months and I’m still the kid from Chino that burned a house down.\n\nMarissa: And I’m still the girl who tried to kill herself in Mexico.\n\nSeth: I’m still… I’m still Seth Cohen.\n\nLuke: Man this is going to suck.\n\nSeth: Yeah, well, welcome to my world.\n\nThe Best Chrismukkah Ever\n\nSeth: So what’s it going to be, huh? Do you want your menorah or candy cane? Hm? Hanukkah or Christmas?\n\nRyan: Uh…\n\nSeth: Uh uh. Don’t worry about it, buddy. Because in this house you don’t have to choose. Allow me to introduce you to a little something that I like to call Chrismukkah.\n\nRyan: Chrismukkah?\n\nSeth: That’s right. It’s the new holiday Ryan, and it’s sweeping the nation.\n\nRyan: What are you wrapping?\n\nSeth: Two Seth Cohen Starter Packs. We’ve got Death Cab, we’ve got Brighteyes, we’ve got The Shins. we’ve got Kavalier and Clay. And we’ve got Goonies. It’s not\n\njust for kids, Ryan. It’s not. I don’t care what they tell you.\n\nSeth: C’mon, man. Lighten up! Ryan doesn’t lighten up. Okay fine. Stay dark. Dark works too.\n\nRyan: You’re really starting to scare me.\n\nSeth: I’m okay with that.\n\nRyan: You better pray for a Chrismukkah miracle.\n\nSeth: I’ve got Jesus and Moses on my side, man.\n\nSeth: Hey. What are you doing, working from home?\n\nKirsten: I’m on vacation.\n\nSeth surveying the paperwork: Yes. Clearly.\n\nKirsten: I find reviewing end-of-the-year accounts to be very relaxing.\n\nSeth: Okay. I hope that’s a recessive gene.\n\nKirsten: You should be so lucky. Look, I haven’t taken a vacation in a while and I’m easing into it.\n\nSeth: Hey, I don’t judge okay? I only mock.\n\nKirsten: That you get from your father.\n\nSeth checking his eyebrows: Oh my god, they’re coming in? Oh that’s… I gotcha…\n\nSeth: How was the mall?\n\nRyan: Eh, weird.\n\nSeth: Yes. You’ve really painted a picture for me. I feel like I was there.\n\nRyan: Marissa picked up a few things. Without paying for them.\n\nSeth: What, as in?\n\nRyan: Shoplifting.\n\nYeah.\n\nSeth: Yeah, that’s weird.\n\nSeth: I’m gonna go make magic happen. I feel like my hair’s working for me tonight.\n\nSeth: Hey Anna. Summer was just giving me her gift. It’s cool.\n\nAnna: You’re Wonder Woman?\n\nSummer: Yeah. So?\n\nAnna: I mean you look… amazing. Is that my story? Oh my god. I made you a comic book. What am I, eight?\n\nSummer to herself: Way to go, Wonder Whore.\n\nSeth: Hey, Wonder Woman’s not a whore, okay? Stop.\n\nSummer: What are we doing?\n\nAnna: I don’t know. This is ridiculous.\n\nSeth: Okay, you guys, one second please. Let’s not have one speed bump derail the whole train okay? Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water. Let’s… let’s make some more metaphors.\n\nSummer: Look, I’m not into talking about, like, feelings or whatever. But I like you, okay? And so does she. If we don’t put an end to this soon—\n\nAnna: Someone’s going to get hurt.\n\nSummer: You gotta choose, Cohen.\n\nSeth: How was your night?\n\nRyan: Marissa got drunk and we got pulled over by the cops with an open container of vodka.\n\nSeth: Hey. That Marissa, she’s really making life interesting for you.\n\nRyan: Yeah. We got into a fight.\n\nSeth: What about the cop?\n\nRyan: He got a radio call. Let us off with a warning for the busted tail light. Now you see why I hate Christmas.\n\nSeth: Hang on a second. Ryan. Um, it seems to me that what we have here is a Chrismukkah miracle.\n\nSeth: Is that what I think it is.\n\nRyan: Yeah. Figured I’d hang it.\n\nSeth: Alright man, another Chrismukkah convert!\n\nThe Countdown\n\nSeth: Separate seats, you guys. C’mon. There’s no sex in the champagne room.\n\nHailey Nichol: Marissa; Is that the short chick next door?\n\nSeth: No. Puberty happened. She’s a Laker.\n\nSeth: Carson Daly and a ball dropping. There is two images that should never be said in the same sentence.\n\nSeth: Why don’t you just go to this party? I don’t understand.\n\nRyan: Because we had plans and… because, I mean, who’s Oliver?\n\nSeth: Okay. As long as you’re clear on your motivation.\n\nSandy: Okay, so we’re gonna go.\n\nKirsten: Do you guys need anything?\n\nSeth: Yes. Ryan needs a tear in the space time continuum so he can go back and say “I love you” to Marissa.\n\nKirsten: She said “I love you”?\n\nSandy: So what’d you say back?\n\nSeth: “Thank you”.\n\nRyan: Thank you.\n\nSandy: Well that was polite.\n\nSeth: Okay, that’s a lot of genitalia in my pool.\n\nSeth: I can’t leave Hailey here. The place will get trashed. Come on, man, she’s insane.\n\nRyan: You said she was awesome.\n\nSeth: Insanely awesome.\n\nRyan: So. Tell her. Party’s over.\n\nSeth: Right. Except I don’t want to be the dad. Okay? Listen, telling my aunt she’s can’t have a party, that’s embarrassing. You do it.\n\nRyan: It’s your house.\n\nSeth: Right. And it’s your girlfriend with some dude named Oliver. I’m just trying to help you track your motivation.\n\nRyan: She’s a part of your family.\n\nSeth: Right. And the Cohens are notorious for conflict avoidance. But the Atwoods, they thrive on it. You are the man for this.\n\nRyan: I’m not gonna win this argument.\n\nSeth: No.\n\nRyan: Okay.\n\nSeth to the naked guys in the pool: Hey, no ball dropping until midnight. Okay?\n\nSeth: I can’t breathe.\n\nRyan: What?\n\nSeth: I’m claustrophobic.\n\nRyan: Seth this place is huge. It has a kitchen and a bathroom.\n\nSeth: Shh. Ryan, do not use up all the oxygen.\n\nRyan: Want a sandwich, a shower? We got all that here.\n\nSeth: Ha ha ha. We’re gonna die and I’m the glib one?\n\nRyan: I sleep here every night. Three of the walls are made of windows.\n\nSeth: Yes, which currently are looking out on naked dudes, man. We’re trapped like rats.\n\nRyan: Rats in an enormous pool house! By the way, your aunt’s really cool.\n\nSeth: Yeah I know, she’s be a bit unpredictable sometimes. My shirt’s strangling me.\n\nRyan: Great, my girlfriend’s kissing some guy and I’m stuck here with a lunatic.\n\nRyan: Let’s go. We gotta clear this party out.\n\nSeth: It’s what I do best.\n\nSandy: I think we’re in the wrong house.\n\nKirsten: I don’t.\n\nSandy: What the hell happened here?\n\nSeth: Okay, I don’t even know enough people to cause this much damage.\n\nKirsten: What did you do?\n\nHailey: Nothing that can’t be undone. A little Palmolive, some elbow grease. Seth and I have it covered.\n\nSeth: Woah. Nobody said anything about elbow grease.\n\nKirsten: Seth. Garbage. Out. Now.\n\nSeth: Anna? Hey.\n\nAnna: I didn’t want you to be alone on New Years. Actually, I didn’t want to be alone on New Years.\n\nSeth: Well I’m not alone.\n\nAnna: Oh.\n\nSeth: I have Captain Oats and Carson Daly, so…\n\nAnna: Oh, wow. That’s an unbeatable combination. I’ll go.\n\nSeth: Wait wait. Captain Oats had too much champagne. And Carson Daly’s kind of a ginormous tool. So… I could use the company.\n\nThe Third Wheel\n\nSandy: She’s eating us out of house and home.\n\nKirsten: Sandy, it’s just a bagel.\n\nSandy: No no no. It’s never just a bagel.\n\nSeth: Mom, as someone who’s basically been a shut-in for the last 17 years of his life I can pretty much say with the greatest authority, that woman never leaves the house.\n\nKirsten: She’s got nowhere else to go.\n\nRyan about Hailey: That’s because all her friends want to kick her ass. pause Sorry about the language.\n\nSandy: Why? I’d like to kick her ass.\n\nSeth: What happened to Seth-Ryan time? That was quality time.\n\nRyan: Okay, I know I’ve been a little bit—\n\nSeth: Ah, whipped?\n\nRyan: I’m not whipped.\n\nSeth: Anna and I have decided to take it to the next level and I need some advice.\n\nRyan: You’re going to have sex.\n\nSeth: No. That’s a good idea though.\n\nSeth: Hey. Later, can we please finish this chat? Put a little Seth-Ryan time on the books?\n\nRyan: Yes, yes. Absolutely. Just gotta check with…\n\nSeth: Oh, you forgot your balls.\n\nSeth to himself Luke has a gay dad. Luke has a gay dad. to Luke Can’t wait to see it, buddy!\n\nSeth: Dude. I cannot believe you live in the penthouse, man. This place is ridonculous.\n\nSandy: Anyone there going to be doing drugs?\n\nSeth: I hope so. Otherwise it’d be a lame-ass rock concert.\n\nSeth: to a singing Luke Hey man, you know who sings this song?\n\nLuke: Rooney!\n\nSeth: Yeah. And it should stay that way.\n\nThe Links\n\nSeth: A little golf, a little shpitz.\n\nAnna: I don’t know. It all sounds kind of old.\n\nSeth: Yes, Anna, it does sound old. Somewhere inside of me there’s a little Jewish man who’s very excited.\n\nSeth: Did you rob a liquor store, Luke?\n\nLuke: Cohen. You can’t play golf without a buzz on.\n\nSeth: Thanks for the tip, Bagger Vance.\n\nLuke: A blender. Nice thinking, Cohen.\n\nSeth: Yeah, no. It’s actually a humidifier. I get nose bleeds.\n\nSummer: I’m trying to give you some culture, Cohen.\n\nSeth: The audio version of The DaVinci Code is not culture.\n\nSummer: Yeah, well, it’s a true story.\n\nAnna: How come when she says “friends” it sounds like a threat?\n\nSeth: It’s her inflection.\n\nSummer: It’s eight o’clock. What are you, like seventy?\n\nSeth: On the inside. Yes.\n\nThe Rivals\n\nSeth: You did accuse the guy of faking a suicide attempt.\n\nRyan: No I didn’t. I just didn’t believe him.\n\nSeth: Oh. Okay. Hard to believe such blind compassion upset Marissa. You should go work things out.\n\nRyan: I don’t trust him. Something about Oliver’s… off.\n\nSeth: Yeah. He tried to kill himself. Or he faked it, man. Either way, it’s pretty off.\n\nRyan: Why would I be jealous?\n\nSeth: Because Oliver’s insanely wealthy and well-traveled?\n\nThe Dapper Don.\n\nRyan: I’m not.\n\nSeth: But on the other hand, he’s also clinically depressed and chemically dependent. So it all comes out in the wash really.\n\nSeth: Let me ask you something. Am I dating a female me? Like me, but as a girl?\n\nSeth: Oh, god, he watches Leno. That explains everything.\n\nAnna: Explains what?\n\nSeth: Why that Danny guy is not funny.\n\nAnna: He’s funny.\n\nSeth: No, he’s not funny. He’s big. Big is not funny.\n\nSeth: Oliver might be crazy, you might be right, but you know what? Right now you’re giving him a run for his money.\n\nSandy: Wow, that kid is not funny.\n\nSeth: Thank you! I know.\n\nSandy: He makes Ryan look funny.\n\nSeth: He makes Marissa look funny.\n\nSandy: Gentiles. I love your mother more than words. But not funny. Get yourself some funnier friends.\n\nSeth: She said that about me? That she thinks I’m the funniest guy ever?\n\nDanny: Yes. You and some dude named Captain Oats. Who the hell is Captain Oats?\n\nSeth: I know Jon Stewart’s no Leno.\n\nThe Truth\n\nSeth: You don’t think that’s a little crazy?\n\nLuke: Dude, have you met Oliver?\n\nSandy: Hello, ladies! Seth.\n\nSeth: Dad, don’t call me a lady.\n\nSeth: What? What’d I do?\n\nSandy: You hurt that poor girl’s feelings out there.\n\nSeth: Who, Dad? Summer?\n\nSandy: No, no. Anna.\n\nSeth: I didn’t say a word to Anna.\n\nSandy: Exactly.\n\nSeth: I’m not talking about this anymore.\n\nSandy: No, of course you’re not talking about it. No one’s talking to me about anything lately. If you want to go and flirt with Summer, go ahead.\n\nSeth: Why are we still talking about this?\n\nSandy: Because I’m your father and I’m responsible for you. And if I see something’s going on with you we are going to talk about it.\n\nSeth: Do you think this is about me, or could this be about Ryan?\n\nSandy: No. It’s about you.\n\nSeth: Okay. But just in case it’s a little bit about Ryan, I think he’ll come to you when he’s ready.\n\nSeth: You know how excited I get turning people on to comics.\n\nAnna: I know how excited you get turning Summer on.\n\nSeth: Ever since the day you got here you have totally had my back and I, I just promise you I will never fail you again. I’m so sorry.\n\nSeth: So do you want to tell me about your night, or—since I heard about it—can we just skip to my breakup with Anna?\n\nRyan: Really? Anna broke up with you?\n\nSeth: Now why would you just assume Anna broke up with me?\n\nRyan: Seth, come on.\n\nSeth: What does that mean?\n\nRyan: What, she didn’t break up with you?\n\nSeth: No, she did, but you’re supposed to have my back.\n\nThe Heartbreak\n\nSummer: I’m busy. Studying. Naked.\n\nSeth outside her door: And that’s supposed to keep me away.\n\nSummer: Cohen? {she opens the door} You’re at my house!\n\nSeth: And you’re dressed. I wonder who’s more disappointed.\n\nSeth: It’s not like, like now that me and Anna broke up I’m now choosing you. Because the whole reason that we broke up, is ’cause for me… it’s always been you, Summer. It’s always been you. I’ve tried to fight it, and I’ve tried to deny it. And I can’t. I can’t do it. You’re undeniable.\n\nSeth: So. That was sex.\n\nSummer: Yep.\n\nSeth: I’m gonna go.\n\nSummer: Me too.\n\nSeth: You live here.\n\nSeth: I’m a man now. And not just like an after-your-Bar-Mitzvah-man, but a man man. I had sex with a girl. Summer, to be more specific.\n\nRyan: How was it?\n\nSeth: I had sex.\n\nRyan: That bad.\n\nSeth: No! Not that bad. Just, just kinda weird.\n\nRyan: Weird?\n\nSeth: Not kinky weird, more like weird awkward. But hey, you know what? It was my first time, she’s a more experienced woman. That’s to be expected. And I did… make some faces in the middle that I wish that I could take back but I can’t. And there’s also sort of a whiny noise that came out towards the end […]. It sucked so bad. I was a fish, flopping around on dry land. Ryan, I was Nemo and I just wanted to go home.\n\nSeth: I need to talk to you. Girl stuff.\n\nSandy: Well. You’ve come to the master. {Kirsten snickers} Hey, I got you.\n\nKirsten: I was young, impressionable, and drunk.\n\nSeth: Only child, right here.\n\nSandy: Hey, listen, you were lucky to be able to hang in there after all that foreplay.\n\nSeth: Fore-what-now?\n\nSeth: Things with Summer now are more messed up than they were before the awful fish sex.\n\nRyan: I wouldn’t refer to it as “Fish Sex” again.\n\nSeth rubs his eye and squints.\n\nRyan: What’d you do to your eye?\n\nSeth: It’s just a little bit blurry. Summer poked me in it with her big toe.\n\nRyan: What? Why?\n\nSeth: I don’t know, man. It was an accident.\n\nThere were limbs everywhere. I’m lucky I can still see.\n\nRyan: So you guys did the deed again?\n\nSeth: Technically yes. But it wasn’t pretty. I think I have a spinal injury.\n\nRyan: Maybe next time you should wear a helmet, mouth guard.\n\nSeth to Captain Oats: Not to rub it in, man, but I think Princess Sparkle is your type. Yeah, I blew it for us both. What’s that? Yeah, are you kidding? Great hoofs.\n\nSummer: The other night… when we… had sex, you weren’t the only virgin in the room.\n\nSeth: There was someone else in the room? Like filming us?\n\nSummer: Me, jackass.\n\nSummer: C’mon Cohen, you are so cheesy.\n\nSeth: I’m sweeping you off your feet.\n\nSummer: The sad part is, you kinda are.\n\nThe Telenovela\n\nRyan about Marissa: We’ll just go back to being friends.\n\nSeth: When were you guys ever friends? Was it when you were beating up her boyfriend or, ah, spooning in a Tijuana motel? Is that when you were friends?\n\nRyan: Yeah, that doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. Does it?\n\nSeth: I don’t know.\n\nSeth: Brad. Dude, I didn’t recognize you out of the Speedo. Not that I would recognize you in a Speedo.\n\nSeth: Hey, how was Pittsburgh?\n\nAnna: It was good to be home.\n\nSeth: It’s also the home of Andy Warhol, Mr. Rogers, and ketchup. And you can’t compete with that.\n\nKirsten: I sense sarcasm.\n\nSeth: Well, you’re perceptive, mother.\n\nSeth: I can’t acknowledge you privately if you’re not gonna acknowledge me publicly.\n\nSummer: Cohen!\n\nSeth: So let me know when you’re ready to come to the bargaining table, but until then you just go ahead and consider me on strike.\n\nSummer: Well you’ll be crossing your own picket line in no time.\n\nSeth: Fight the power!\n\nSummer: Why can’t you accept that I’m not comfortable with public displays on affection?\n\nSeth: You’re offering yourself for ten dollars a pop at a kissing booth! How much more public can affection be displayed?\n\nSeth: You guys, what we have here is our very own telenovela.\n\nSandy: You did musicals? I did a musical myself in college.\n\nKirsten: Oh, please, someone stop him before he starts singing “Greased Lightning.”\n\nSeth: Do it, Dad! Travolta’s your bitch!\n\nSeth: I love revolving restaurants.\n\nSandy: Who doesn’t. Motion and digestion. It’s an unbeatable combination.\n\nSeth: That would actually make this romantic triangle more of a romantic rhombus.\n\nSummer: Why are you doing this?\n\nSeth: Because I like you Summer. This much. And if you don’t feel the same way about me then someone’s going to have to give me a hand down because it’s really high up here. And I could fall and that would be embarrassing. More embarrassing.\n\nThe Goodbye Girl\n\nSeth: We were just discussing your plan.\n\nTheresa: What plan?\n\nSeth: Exactly.\n\nSeth: So she’s leaving.\n\nRyan: No, she’s staying.\n\nSeth: What? Did you talk to Anna?\n\nRyan: Anna?\n\nSeth: She’s moving back to Pittsburgh.\n\nRyan: Anna’s going back to Pittsburgh?\n\nSeth: Uh… not anymore according to you.\n\nRyan: I’m totally confused.\n\nSeth: She—Anna—is leaving.\n\nRyan: She—Theresa—is staying.\n\nSeth: Right got it. So she really is moving.\n\nRyan: It sucks.\n\nSeth: I think it’s because of me. I can’t believe I caused a girl to leave the state. The county, maybe, sure. Fine.\n\nRyan: You really think it’s ’cause of you?\n\nSeth: Well, I mean, we broke up, she went back East. She had a great time. She comes back, only to see me standing on a coffee cart declaring my eternal love for Summer.\n\nRyan: Maybe she just doesn’t feel that comfortable here. Not everyone does.\n\nSeth: I know, I get that. But if it is ’cause of me, maybe I can talk her out of it. Except for the fact that I can’t ask her if it’s ’cause of me without sounding totally self-absorbed. And I’m not self-absorbed, right Ryan? Me. Me.\n\nRyan: Huh?\n\nSeth: Me.\n\nRyan: Sorry.\n\nSeth: Me.\n\nRyan: Just thinking about Theresa.\n\nRyan: You and Anna, you guys talk?\n\nSeth: Do not change the subject to me because I am powerless not to talk about it. I tried and she gave me a list of reasons why she’s leaving.\n\nRyan: You didn’t make the cut, did you?\n\nSeth: But she’s lying. I want her to know that, you know, I’m sorry I hurt her feelings but she doesn’t have to do this. She shouldn’t be doing this.\n\nRyan: Then just tell her.\n\nSeth: “Just tell her.” Simple. Honest. Direct. No wonder I never considered it. Okay fine. I will. I’ll tell her tonight but I have to have a little bubbly first. A little veritas and vino, know what I mean?\n\nRyan: Hardly ever.\n\nSeth: Come on, man, her flight leaves soon. Can we hurry?\n\nRyan: We’re doing 75 in a 65, alright?\n\nSeth: “75 in a 65”? Everyone knows 80’s the new 75.\n\nRyan: What? Who talks like that?\n\nSeth: What is up with this AC? My Jew-fro is frizzing out. I look like Screech.\n\nRyan: AC’s fine.\n\nSeth: What is this music?\n\nRyan to Seth: Do not insult Journey, alright?\n\nLike this quote? Check out the shirt.\n\nSeth: You love me. I read it. And I get it. I’m so sorry if I did anything to hurt your feelings or cause this, but I don’t want you to leave. Okay? None of us do.\n\nAnna: Seth, I love you. As a friend.\n\nSeth: What?\n\nAnna: Cohen I love you as a friend.\n\nSeth: It doesn’t say Azerbaijan?\n\nAnna: Look, I think you’re an amazing guy—a little self-absorbed, maybe— but great. I mean, if there’s one thing my relationship taught me it’s that we don’t have a lot of chemistry.\n\nSeth: So you’re not leaving because of me?\n\nAnna: I’m leaving because I need to leave. But who knows, maybe one day we’ll be perfect for each other. I don’t know. I do know I have to go to Pittsburgh. I’m moving, Seth. I thought I could make this ride alone, but I can’t. Thanks for coming. Saying goodbye.\n\nSeth: Anna, wait a second. What am I going to do without you? You’re so wise, and all your sage wisdom. What am I going do without that?\n\nAnna: Confidence, Cohen.\n\nSeth: What if the girl I’m supposed to be with just went back to Pittsburgh?\n\nRyan: What if she went back to Chino?\n\nSeth: Why would Anna go to Chino? pause. Kidding.\n\nRyan: Nice one. Well, at least we have each other.\n\nSeth: Actually, I have Summer now. But I’ll put a little Seth/Ryan time on the books. It’s quality time.\n\nRyan: Thanks, buddy. I could always hang out with Luke. I wonder what he’s doing right now.\n\nSeth: Discovering fire. Hunting and gathering. Shaving his chest with a buck knife. You guys could do that together.\n\nThe L.A.\n\nSeth: So, then, did you take your watch off during the deed or… what exactly?\n\nRyan: Wanna wait in the car? I can pick something up from the front desk myself.\n\nSeth: No, that’s cool. I’ve got more questions. So then, I don’t understand. Did you take it off during foreplay? Was it before foreplay? Now that would seem presumptuous but I—\n\nRyan: No seriously. Seriously. Stay in there, leave the radio on, window up—\n\nSeth: Because I like to leave the watch on, Ryan. I like to leave it on and know how I’m doing. If I’m beating my old time. The thing is, it’s sort of a sex marathon, not a sex sprint.\n\nSeth: This is a good time for you, okay Ryan Atwood? This is Clean Slate Ryan, Finally you have no women to protect from violent goateed factory workers or pill-popping manic depressives.\n\nRyan: You’re right. I guess I really do have a clean slate.\n\nSeth: You do! Dude, since day one of you getting here it’s been nothing but lady drama with you. Marissa, Theresa. Luke, Oliver, Eddie. Dude, I’m getting exhausted just thinking about it.\n\nRyan: I am kinda tired.\n\nSeth: You should be. You know what, you’re going to get a break ’cause you deserve it. I think I’m going to declare this month “Angst-free Ryan” Month.\n\nSeth about Julie and Luke: Maybe they’re not having sex. Maybe they just go to a motel to spoon and watch Charlie Rose.\n\nRyan: You’re right, that’s probably it.\n\nRyan about The Valley: Is that Grady?\n\nSeth: Yeah.\n\nRyan: He’s kinda like you.\n\nSeth: What? Handsome and charming?\n\nRyan: No. Geeky and sarcastic.\n\nSeth: Oh god, he is like me. He is like me except with his own TV show.\n\nRyan: I was kidding.\n\nSeth: Ryan, if you could have the real me or the TV me which one would you take? You’d take the TV me. Dude, we are not going to L.A. ’cause I’m going to lose Summer to the real-life TV Seth Cohen.\n\nRyan: You don’t even know if your parents are going to let us go.\n\nSeth: I’m handling it.\n\nRyan: So you’re going to lie to them.\n\nSeth: No, that was the old me. I have evolved and now I’m a man of honor,\n\nRyan. So I’m gonna need you to talk to them. That’s more your specialty.\n\nRyan: Seems like you’re making a lot of things my specialty these days.\n\nSeth: Yeah, Great leadership’s all about delegation.\n\nRyan: So now I’m your employee?\n\nSeth: No. We’re partners.\n\nRyan: What do you do?\n\nSeth: I’m working on the business plan, okay? And that’s going to be awesome.\n\nDon’t spend an extra minute in L.A. The town will steal your soul.\n\nSeth: Well right now it’s about to steal my girlfriend.\n\nRyan about Grady: How does that guy play high school?\n\nSeth: Hollywood, man.\n\nMarissa: Hey, where’s Summer?\n\nSeth: I don’t know. Off with Grady somewhere. I talk about Pynchon for like two seconds, suddenly she’s gone.\n\nSeth: We’re gonna grab my girlfriend, we’re gonna grab my aunt—more gently than, say, you. and we’re leaving.\n\nSeth: I heard some really—really—awful music. And I knew it could only be self-indulgent actors with instruments.\n\nSeth: You know, I think we did pretty good in there, man. And I told you, we make a good team. I’m the brains, you’re the brawn.\n\nMarissa: Hey! How come you’re the brains? I’m the one who talked us back into that club.\n\nSeth: I’m sorry, I’m the brains.\n\nYou can be the beauty.\n\nMarissa: Okay, thanks.\n\nSeth: Yeah, that’s exactly right. You’re the beauty, he’s the brawn, I’m the brains. Perfect.\n\nSummer: Great. And what am I, Cohen?\n\nSeth: Ah. The boobs? The bitch?\n\nSummer: Okay, I’ll take the boobs.\n\nSeth: Hey. So will I.\n\nThe Nana\n\nLuke: Hey, Cohen, get up.\n\nSeth: It’s my precious, you can’t have it!\n\nSeth: So what’s the GPRA?\n\nRyan: I have no idea what you just said.\n\nSeth: Game plan, Ryan Atwood.\n\nRyan: You’re just using initials now?\n\nSeth: Yeah. They save time.\n\nRyan: Well, not if you have friends that don’t.\n\nSeth: GP.\n\nRyan: Game Plan?\n\nSeth: Good point.\n\nSeth: Mom, Hailey made three different kinds of pancakes and waffles. They’re deliciously redundant.\n\nSummer: I wanna meet The Nana.\n\nSeth: Yeah, you really don’t though. Believe me.\n\nSummer: What, I love old people! They’re so cute.\n\nSeth: Yeah. Well, The Nana, not so cute.\n\nSummer: Really? She’s ugly?\n\nSeth: No, she’s just scary.\n\nSummer: Where are you going?\n\nSeth: Um, I have to pick up some stuff for the Seder.\n\nSummer: What now?\n\nSeth: The Seder. For Passover? Yeah, you’re not meeting The Nana.\n\nSophie Cohen (Linda Lavin): The front door’s wide open. A person could walk in here, take everything and kill us all.\n\nSeth: It’s The Nana.\n\nSeth: The Nana has never exactly cared for The Kirsten.\n\nSandy: Oh, c’mon, Mom. It’s Ryan’s first Seder.\n\nSeth: How do you know that? Don’t assume that. They have Jews in Chino. Why do you think they want a P.F. Cheng’s?\n\nThe Nana: Shawn and your dad used to run in a gang together, did you know that?\n\nSeth: Oh yeah? Bloods or Crips, father?\n\nSandy: It was more of a youth group.\n\nSummer: I’m gonna study this thing so hard I’m even gonna out-Jew you.\n\nSummer opens the Hagada.\n\nSeth: You’re reading it backwards.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nMarissa: I’m emotionally stable. Besides, I’m not the only one crying.\n\nSeth: I’m sorry, what? I’m allergic, okay? And there is so much pollen in here right now, it’s ridiculous.\n\nMarissa: It’s okay.\n\nSeth: And tomorrow I’m watching football, okay?\n\nJulie: Football season is five months away.\n\nSeth walking in on Ryan donning a wifebeater: Hey! Oh… sorry. I’m surprised that hasn’t happened before. Not saying I’m disappointed it hasn’t happened before I’m just saying the mathematical probability of…\n\nRyan: Yeah. Crying during chick flicks, walking in on me getting dressed…\n\nSeth: Yeah, what’s your point, okay? I’m not seeing what you’re getting at. Do you work out?\n\nRyan: Not really.\n\nSeth: Cool, me neither. I’m gonna go watch some hockey.\n\nRyan: Hockey season’s over.\n\nSeth: Dammit. Where are you going?\n\nRyan: I’m gonna go find Luke. Beat the crap out of him.\n\nSeth: Oh. Where shall this can of whoop-ass be opened?\n\nRyan: I don’t know I’m gonna go down to his house, try the pier…\n\nSeth: Have you considered our backyard?\n\nSeth: Yeah, Summer, do you really think giving her a little Feng Shui is going to help her forget her mom slept with her ex-boyfriend?\n\nSummer: You don’t like hardware stores and you cry during chick flicks. Next thing you’re going to tell me, you walk in on Ryan changing!\n\nSeth: That’s crazy! Hey let’s go to the hardware store.\n\nSeth: “1996 All School Hide-and-Seek Champion.” I do believe Joel Gordon is still looking for me.\n\nSummer: You were in the comic book club?\n\nSeth: Yeah. I was the president and only member.\n\nSummer: Was I really mean to you?\n\nSeth: No, that would have required you to speak to me. Nobody would speak to me.\n\nSummer: A lot’s changed in a year, huh.\n\nSeth: I did it. Look.\n\nSummer: Oh, you hit a nail. Bob Vila’s your bitch, Cohen.\n\nSummer: You have to find the stud.\n\nSeth: Like you did, Summer?\n\nSummer: Just get me the stud\n\nfinder.\n\nSeth: Oh Summer. I think you are the stud finder.\n\nSummer: You see this hammer in my hand?\n\nSeth: Yeah, we’ll find that stud finder. What does it look like?\n\nSummer: And a level.\n\nSeth: What does is a level?\n\nSummer: Don’t you know what a level is?\n\nSeth: Yeah, it’s something you advance to in a video game.\n\nSummer: That’s funny. The tool doesn’t know about tools.\n\nSummer You’re such a dandy, Cohen.\n\nSeth offended: You’re a dandy, woman!\n\nSeth: She’ll watch over you with her Care Bear Stare.\n\nRyan: How do you know about the Care Bear Stare?\n\nThe Shower\n\nSeth about Kirsten: It’s the Tourette’s firing up again. Happens every now and again, but it’s fun.\n\nSeth: I think it might be time to take a step back and untangle this incestuous web that I like to call the Caleb-Julie union. Now let’s think about this. When this bizarro knot gets tied, Julie Cooper’s gonna be your mother-in-law.\n\nSandy: Woah.\n\nSeth: Yeah. Enjoy. And your step-mom.\n\nKirsten: Seth, my head is spinning.\n\nSeth: Me and Marissa, we could be related. I don’t know. I can’t even do that math. But the real kicker is: Julie Cooper? My grandma. My grandma wears Uggs. Think about it.\n\nSummer: They’re playing video games. It’s not a Mandy Moore movie.\n\nSeth: No, she’s supposed to be crying and he’s supposed to be brooding. That’s how it works.\n\nSeth: You’ve met my dad, you met my mom, you met Captain Oats. The list goes on and on.\n\nSeth: You’re forgetting one key factor here, Summer. Parents love me. I’ve got this non-threatening, non-sexual vibe.\n\nSeth: Sure we can do lunch. But your dad’s not gonna need a menu because he’ll be eating out of the palm of my hand. Ah ha hah!\n\nSummer: Order steak, because he thinks greens are effeminate.\n\nSeth: Celery’s gay. I got it, right.\n\nSummer: Mostly we talk about me.\n\nSeth: You?\n\nSummer: Yeah, you know. It’s like our common interest.\n\nNeil Roberts: Comic books?\n\nSeth: Sir… I think I hear the skepticism in your tone.\n\nSeth: What would you say—in your professional surgical opinion—she has more of? Would you say it’s vim or would you say it’s vigor?\n\nSeth: So I didn’t even get a review at all? Not that I read my own press. But I mean, nothing involving thumbs or stars or…\n\nSummer: We should go.\n\nRyan to Seth: Let go of me. Now.\n\nMarissa: Is Ryan leaving?\n\nSeth: Yeah. {pause} Oh, he took your car.\n\nSeth: Hey. You’re avoiding me.That’s cool. I like it. It’s a throwback. It feels very eighth grade.\n\nSeth about Summer’s dad: Well look. I’m sorry if your dad doesn’t think I’m good enough for you. Okay? Really. I am. And if that’s the way he feels that sucks. But you know what? It really doesn’t matter, I don’t really have to be his type. Because the only thing that matters is me and you. Right?\n\nSummer: I have to go. {she runs off}\n\nSeth: Go talk to your girlfriend. One of us should be able to.\n\nThe Strip\n\nSeth: Go back to bed. Or… the floor.\n\nTheresa: I can’t impose on Seth’s parents forever.\n\nSeth: Sure you can. I intend to.\n\nSandy: Not that I have any affection for you, Caleb. You know that. But I do love The Vegas.\n\nSeth: I didn’t know you loved The Vegas, Dad.\n\nSandy: I love The Vegas. Ryan, how do you feel about The Vegas?\n\nRyan: I’ve never been to The Vegas. My mom was all about The Reno.\n\nSeth about Summer: Do I force confrontation or do I just continue to be whiny passive aggressive until she realizes what a catch I am?\n\nMarissa: You guys have fake IDs?\n\nSeth: CB Cebulski of Menlo Park. Have you met my associate, Marty Navis?\n\nSeth: What are we gonna do, man? I don’t want to get thrown out of The Hotel. I love The Hotel. I wanna marry the hotel and have little gambling-addicted alcoholic kids with it.\n\nSeth: I love The Vegas. Obviously The Vegas loves me.\n\nSeth: Why quit when you’re ahead?\n\nRyan: ‘Cause if we don’t, Angry Trucker Hat over there is gonna hurt me.\n\nSeth: Maybe he’s not angry at you. Maybe he’s angry ’cause he found out people don’t wear trucker hats anymore.\n\nSummer: Get away from him, whore!\n\nSeth: Wait wait wait! She’s not a whore. She goes to UNLV.\n\nSummer: Oh, okay. You know, I’m sorry. Skank.\n\nSeth: I hate The Vegas.\n\nSeth about Texas Hold ‘Em: That’s a card game, not hooker-talk.\n\nThe Ties The Bind\n\nSeth: Thor. That’s a strong name. No one’s gonna mess with Thor.\n\nRyan: Thanks.\n\nSeth: Seth’s a good name for a boy too. Although at Camp Takahoe I was often referred to as a girl. So I guess it works either way.\n\nRyan: Can we not play the name game?\n\nSeth: Not having anyone pick on me, there’s really been no need for the Seth Cohen retaliatory zinger.\n\nKirsten: Is everything okay?\n\nSeth: Yeah, it’s fine.\n\nTheresa: I’m pregnant.\n\nSeth: Well, except for that.\n\nSummer: I’m freaking out.\n\nSeth: You’re freaking out? What about Ryan and Theresa?\n\nSummer: What about my best friend.\n\nSeth: Princess Sparkle is freaking out?\n\nSummer: Marissa, dumb ass.\n\nSeth: Oh. I always get those two confused. They both have really shiny hair.\n\nSeth: Hey man. They raised me. Okay. Proof pudding. Speaking of pudding, mother, do we have any tapioca on tap?\n\nKirsten: You are king of the segues.\n\nSeth: I just love pudding. It’s so fun to say. Pudding. Pudding. Puuudding.\n\nLike the quote? Check out the shirt.\n\nRyan: You’re talking to a boat, Seth.\n\nSeth: Yeah, I talk to a plastic horse, too. But that never worries anyone.\n\nRyan: It worried me.\n\nSummer: I can’t believe your boat’s name is Summer. What a coincidence. My name’s Summer, your boat’s name is Summer. That’s kind of crazy.\n\nSeth: Yeah. It’s just crazy.\n\nSummer: Six thousand dollars in cash? What are you, fleeing the country or something?\n\nSeth: No, it’s for Ryan.\n\nSummer: What? For vintage wife-beaters?\n\nSeth: I think it was on this very stretch of beach where we first got our asses kicked by the water polo team.\n\nRyan: Yeah. Could be.\n\nSeth: Yes, it definitely tastes the same.\n\nMarissa: Wait, when was that?\n\nRyan: When I first got here.\n\nSeth: Yeah it was after the fashion show at Holly’s beach house.\n\nSummer: You guys were at that party?\n\nSeth: Those were the days.\n\nMarissa: Believe me, if there was something I could do, I would.\n\nSeth: Yeah, well, I think you’ve done enough, so…\n\nMarissa: What does that mean?\n\nSeth: I just don’t think even Ryan would be back with Theresa if it weren’t for you and Oliver in the first place.\n\nSummer: Cohen!\n\nSeth: Really. All you ever did was drag that kid into your messed-up life.\n\nMarissa: Right. And all you ever did was use him to meet girls and get out of fights."
