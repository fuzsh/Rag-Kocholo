        "text": "Oh how I miss the proper teen drama's compared to the usual crap such as GG and 90210 thats on TV today.\n\nI miss the Cohen's Christmukkah, Cooper's drama and just Summer Roberts.\n\nI know Marissa got annoying and to kill her off because her character had nowhere left to go was a wise move but I thought they should have kept her.\n\nTaylor was awesome but I think Marissa and Ryan belonged together and would have been better if Ryan dropped her to the airport and had a happy ending and her returning to season 4 and they can finally be together without your Alex, Volchoks, Jonny's, DJ's and Olivers.\n\nAlso hated Summer as an environmental freak and the missed her as her old self as thats when her and Seth's relationship was fun and banter filled. Glad they married.\n\nSandy and Julie rocked and so did the older Kaitlin.\n\nSeth Cohen and Summer Roberts made the show. I know the focus was on Ryan and Marissa but Seth and Summer really had the relationship that just worked.\n\nOC movie and Marissa returning from the dead perhaps?\n\n0"
