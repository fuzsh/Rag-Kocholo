        "text": "Dominant Extroverted Sensing [Se]: Prior to her relationship with Seth, Summer was superficial, spoiled, and cared a lot about physical appearance and status. She cares about money and looks down on those who don’t have it. She’s immediately interested in Ryan because she finds him attractive and is intrigued by his brooding, bad boy persona, but when she finds out he’s from Chino, she promptly loses interest. She is afraid of what dating Seth will do to her reputation and her social standing. Summer isn’t afraid to take charge and can be quite aggressive. When she discovers Luke cheating on Marissa with Holly, she responds to the situation by attacking Holly. Summer suffers from issues with rage and can display violent tendencies. When she and Anna are fighting over Seth, they each give him a Christmas present. While Anna chooses to write and illustrate a comic book for him, Summer decides to get dressed up as Wonder Woman and seduce him – a physical, sensory gift. Summer loves to engage with the world and live in the moment without giving very much thought to the future. She’s good at taking advantage of opportunities as the arise. She wants to meet attractive rich guys, who will be present at the Cohen’s party for Caleb, so she’ll just convince Seth to take her as his date so she can schmooze away. She enjoys going shopping, partying, and working on her tan. Summer is prone to making short-sighted decisions without really thinking things all the way through. She frees bunnies that are part of an experiment, leading to her suspension from Brown, which could’ve been avoided altogether had she bothered to look into what the study was actually for (it was a socialization experiment that brought no harm to the rabbits). Summer doesn’t hesitate to sign up for the gang’s various schemes. Eventually, the materialistic side of Summer’s Se subsides, and she becomes more focused on utilizing it to advocate for positive change in the world.\n\nAuxiliary Introverted Feeling [Fi]: Summer doesn’t really like to talk about her emotions and has trouble putting her feelings into words. She typically deals with her feelings by pretending they don’t exist until they become impossible for her to deny. It’s difficult for her to accept that she has feelings for Seth, so she tries to push them away. She’s uncomfortable with public displays of affection and prefers to keep her relationship private because she’s afraid of what will happen if Seth dumps her. However, she doesn’t tell him that upfront – he has to pry it out of her. Summer believes in being who she is, no matter what, and remains true to herself. When Seth and Ryan are trying to prep her for a college interview, she gives untraditional answers, and refuses to lie to look good. If she says something that isn’t true to who she is, she could end up living the wrong life as a result. Summer has a very strict honesty policy, which Seth often breaks, leading her to crack down on him. Summer is protective of the people she cares about and will defend them when they’re being threatened or attacked. After Marissa’s death, Summer withdraws from her friends and from Newport because being around them reminds her of Marissa and thinking about Marissa hurts, so she throws herself into other things to avoid the pain. She needs to process her emotions and deal with her grief on her own. Although Summer initially uses activism as a crutch, it gives her the opportunity to discover her inner depth and she becomes a champion for various causes. She frees rabbits in a science lab and she wants to save the Earth and it is these newfound passions that lead her to getting a job offer from G.E.O.R.G.E. She attends rallies and protests and becomes motivated to make a real difference in the world.\n\nTertiary Extroverted Thinking [Te]: Because she is so blunt and has a habit of just saying whatever she’s thinking, Summer can come across as insensitive, rude, and callous. She is very direct and has no problem blurting out harsh truths. Summer tends to deal with her emotions by doing. External measurements of intelligence are important to Summer. She didn’t believe that she had real potential until she received her high SAT scores. It was at that point that she turned her academic career around and decided to buckle down and apply herself. Once she realized what she was capable, she became remarkably successful in school and even managed to get accepted to Brown. When Summer has a goal, her Te can truly shine. The campaign that she launches in order to get Marissa back into Harbor is a success. When she sees that Taylor is trying to take Marissa’s place, she decides to fight her for the position of social chair, successfully ousting Taylor.\n\nInferior Introverted Intuition [Ni]: Although Summer is primarily focused on the here and now, she can sometimes get herself worried about the future. She convinces herself that Seth will inevitably dump her once he gets to college because he’ll realize that he wants someone smarter than her. When she decides she wants to attend Brown, she fully commits to school and she becomes one of the top students at Harbor in an incredibly short period of time. When Summer sets her mind to something, she can be very good at reaching her goals. When she decides she wants to impress Seth’s grandmother, she commits to learning the traditions of Judaism and quickly learns and recites the four questions. It’s sometimes difficult for her to trust her instincts, which can cause her to deny them. She doesn’t really have a sense of direction in life until she begins her activism, but then questions whether that’s truly her calling, leading her to revert back to the materialistic version of herself and has to force herself to show an interest in the things she once loved. Even though it takes her some time, she eventually realizes that she has grown and changed and she isn’t that person anymore, which allows her to fully embrace an entirely new side of herself.\n\nEnneagram: 7w8 8w7 3w2 Sx/So\n\nQuotes:\n\nSummer: I can’t even pick out my shoes in the morning, let alone plan the rest of my life.\n\nSummer: I love shopping, tanning, and celebrity gossip. Always have, always will.\n\nRyan: Who’s been the greatest influence in your intellectual development? Summer: Um, Miuccia Prada. Seth: You probably wanna say somebody more like Einstein or… Summer: So you want me to, like, lie? Seth: No, I just, I don’t think that, uh, Prada is the answer that they’re looking for. Summer: Well, this interview could, like, determine the rest of our lives, right? Well, if I say something that I don’t believe in, I could end up with the wrong life. How awful would that be? Ryan: She has a point. Summer: I have to go get a mani pedi. Seth: Summer. Summer: Cohen, if you wanna memorize answers you think that they wanna hear, that’s fine. But I believe in being myself. And by the way, Miuccia Prada combined styles from time periods in ways people never even imagined possible. Her clothes teach you to change your perspective.\n\nSummer: I just don’t know why he likes me. I mean he’s way smarter and we have like less than nothing in common. And he’s just going to get bored with me because pretty much all boys do. And everybody knows we’re dating and everyone will know when he breaks up with me. Which he will. [trying to mask her vulnerability] I mean, dumped by Seth Cohen? Real good for my reputation.\n\nSummer: You know, college fairs are kind of like shopping. It’s all about brand recognition.\n\n[after kissing Seth] Summer: I just can’t help it. Seth: Uh uh. Summer: And I certainly can’t explain it. You didn’t tell anyone? Seth: Of course not. Summer: ‘Cause I’ll kill you. Seth: No, I believe you.\n\nSeth: Think we should have woke Ryan and Marissa? Summer: No. They looked so cute together. Vomit. Seth: Hey. That’s a real sentimental streak you’ve got there, Summer.\n\nSeth: I can’t acknowledge you privately if you’re not gonna acknowledge me publicly. Summer: Cohen! Seth: So let me know when you’re ready to come to the bargaining table, but until then you just go ahead and consider me on strike. Summer: Well you’ll be crossing your own picket line in no time. Seth: Fight the power!\n\nSummer: Of course I didn’t mean to hit you. Seth: I know. I just find it interesting how your hand collided with my face.\n\nSummer: No way. No scheming, no plan Bs, no wacky hijinks? Cohen broke up with me. Only he has the power to unbreak us up. There’s no way I’m gonna go groveling back to him like some pathetic brokenhearted little bitch.\n\nSandy: Summer! How’re you doing? Summer: Better than the 2.8 billion people living below the poverty level. Are you okay with that statistic, Mr. Cohen? I don’t think so. That’s why I have to go. Sandy: Who knew out of all you kids she’d turn out to be the young Sandy Cohen. Seth: Had to rub off on someone.\n\nSummer: Why can’t you accept that I’m not comfortable with public displays of affection?\n\nSummer: I don’t want the Italians to think I have bad style. I’m representing America. Zach: Well, that’s very patriotic of you.\n\nSummer: No, I’m not worried. I’m freaking terrified, okay? That’s why I’m focusing on just finding Pancakes and not about the the fact that my boyfriend could be laying on the side of the road ravaged by zombies.\n\nSummer: Trapped in a department store. Which is like my ultimate fantasy. Ryan: Okay, and what if we get caught? Summer: We’ll be stealth.\n\nSummer: No. Seth did. He’s worried about you. So are the Cohens. I know you think that you’re protecting them but you’re not. You’re just hurting them. Besides, Seth keeps leaving me these endless, whiny messages that are totally clogging up my voicemail. Ryan, c’mon, take a deep breath. Just let me do what I do best. Ryan: Which is what? Summer: Giving orders. Just do what I say, Atwood. One last time.\n\nSeth: Summer. Hey. We were both just talking and— Summer: Save it, Cohen. I’m done listening to your excuses. Zach: Summer, we’re really sorry. Are you willing to forgive us? Summer: Nope. Don’t wanna forgive you. But prom is tomorrow night. And I have wanted to go my whole life. So I’m not going to let our demented little threesome ruin that for me. So I’m going. With on of you. Seth: Well, which one of us are you going to take? Summer: Don’t care. I am too pissed off and tired to choose. So you’re going to decide. Don’t care how. Tomorrow I will be outside in front of my house in a dress and one of you will pick me up. Got it? Good. Oh! You know, my dress is a magenta color, so my corsage should be in that general family.\n\nSeth: What if we can’t decide? Summer: Rock paper scissors. Flip a coin. I don’t care how you do it.\n\nSeth: Princess Sparkle, you’re in my room. Summer: Yeah. I figured Oats would pretty down and could use the companionship of someone sweet and pretty and with shinier hair. Who would just, you know, be there for him.\n\nSeth: That’s the thing, I’ve been so self-involved this past year I don’t even know. I have no idea. I’m sure it’s, you know, at least partially my fault. I know running away was really hard on her last summer. Summer: Cohen, no offense, but you’re being self-involved again. I think this is bigger than you.\n\nSummer: You gotta admit, Coop, whatever happens—Ryan facing off with Trey to avenge your honor? God, that is so freaking hot! In a mythic, Biblical Samarai Western kind of way.\n\nSummer: Look, I know that our summer sucked. Marissa: To say the least. Summer: But we made it through it! No one is in juvie. Or in a jumpsuit. Seth: I think Marissa would have worn one rather well. I do. It’s the right cut on you— Summer: The point is. The four of us are together. It’s our senior year. Marissa: So? Summer: So. It’s our last time to make everything awesome.\n\nSeth: Face it, our chemistry is undeniable. Summer: You know what else is undeniable? The pain this fork is going to cause when I jam it into your eye! … I suffer from rage blackouts.\n\nRyan: We’ll figure something out. Summer: Well we better hurry. Because she just escaped from a psych ward wearing a candy striper outfit. If they didn’t think she was crazy before— Sorry.\n\nSeth: What’s going on here? Summer: I like Seth Cohen. Seth: You, ah… you what now? Summer: Nothing. I wasn’t talking to you.\n\nSummer: Blacks ops maneuvers commence at twenty-one hundred hours. Synchronize your watch. Seth: This was my plan. Summer: Fine. What do I do? Seth: That twenty-one hundred thing sounded pretty cool. And then we’re going to synchronize our watches. We have to get watches.\n\nSummer: These are our college lists. Do you see a difference? Seth: Yeah. The font. Looks like you went with the, ah, Times New Roman. Summer: The schools, doofus. None of them are the same. None of them are even in the same time zone. Seth: Okay, so you know, you went West Coast, I went East Coast. It’s not a hip-hop war. Summer: We are going to be separated by like a zillionbillion miles. I was up all last night thinking about that. Seth: You were? Summer: You haven’t even given this a second thought, have you?\n\nSummer: You can have him. Go to Brown or wherever you smart people go. He’s yours. Taylor: This is a ploy, isn’t it? Summer: No. It’s life. He’s going to Rhode Island and I’m going to Arizona. Taylor: I just thought you guys would do the whole long distance thing. Summer: Please. And struggle along? Break up at Thanksgiving and hook up at Christmas. And then break up again in January when we’re both back in school? Taylor: But you could still apply to a school near to him. Summer: Could you imagine me on the East coast? I’d be like one of those animals that they rip from their natural habitat and put in a zoo. Their fur would get all mangy and they’d throw dung at people. It would be awful.\n\nSummer: Well maybe I never had a dream. You know, maybe for once in my life I actually want to do something in my life. Like something important. Be the first woman in space or win one of the noble prizes. Seth: Summer, women have been going to space since the 60s. And it’s not noble prizes, it’s Nobel prize. Marie Curie won in 1903 for discovering radium.\n\nSummer: If we’re going to launch a successful campaign to get Marissa back into Harbor we have to find someone who can organize the masses. Someone who they’ll follow, you know, into battle. Seth: You mean General Townsend? Summer: Affirmative.\n\nSummer: This school is apathetic. They need someone who can inspire. Someone who can intimidate. Seth: They need Taylor. Summer: Yeah. You know, maybe it’s better to be feared than loved. Cohen, you have my permission to do whatever it takes. Seth: What is it? Summer: I’m picturing, like, Indecent Proposal. You’re Demi. Naturally. And Taylor is the leather-faced guy who talks to horses. Seth: You want me to trade sex for signatures? Summer: Get her on board. I want Marissa back at this school. Seth: I feel so dirty.\n\nTherapist: I’m proud of you, Summer. You’ve made astounding progress. And all in one week. Summer: Well it’s kind of a relief in a way. Now I can go back to being me. Therapist: What do you mean by that? Summer: Well this whole “Save the Planet” thing. It was a crutch, right? And nothing against handicapped people, but, ew.\n\nSeth: Hey Anna. Summer was just giving me her gift. It’s cool. Anna:You’re Wonder Woman? Summer: Yeah. So? Anna:I mean you look… amazing. Is that my story? Oh my god. I made you a comic book. What am I, eight? Summer to herself: Way to go, Wonder Whore. Seth: Hey, Wonder Woman’s not a whore, okay? Stop. Summer: What are we doing? Anna:I don’t know. This is ridiculous. Seth: Okay, you guys, one second please. Let’s not have one speed bump derail the whole train okay? Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water. Let’s… let’s make some more metaphors. Summer: Look, I’m not into talking about, like, feelings or whatever. But I like you, okay? And so does she. If we don’t put an end to this soon— Anna:Someone’s going to get hurt. Summer: You gotta choose, Cohen.\n\nSummer: Okay, let’s be more professional! Less drooling, more drawing. And don’t give me any junk in the trunk, either.\n\nSummer: Listen, skank, just because you’re saying really mean things in, like, a really nice voice, doesn’t mean that we don’t realize that you’re just some stupid, little skank."
