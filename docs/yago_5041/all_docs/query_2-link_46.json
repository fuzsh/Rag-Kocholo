        "text": "Seth: We were just discussing your plan.\n\nTheresa: What plan?\n\nSeth: Exactly.\n\nLuke: The sooner you realize that it’s never going to go back to the way it was, the sooner you can move on.\n\nAnna: They have chin implants?\n\nSummer: My Dad does them all the time. He says chins are the new nose.\n\nAnna: So did Picasso.\n\nSummer: Really? What hospital does he work for? Kidding! I’m not that dumb, just shallow.\n\nJulie: Luke just came by to defrag my hard drive.\n\nJimmy: Okay.\n\nSandy: Do you want to know what I think?\n\nRyan: You’re going to tell me either way, right?\n\nSandy: Like my own son.\n\nSeth: So she’s leaving.\n\nRyan: No, she’s staying.\n\nSeth: What? Did you talk to Anna?\n\nRyan: Anna?\n\nSeth: She’s moving back to Pittsburgh.\n\nRyan: Anna’s going back to Pittsburgh?\n\nSeth: Uh… not anymore according to you.\n\nRyan: I’m totally confused.\n\nSeth: She—Anna—is leaving.\n\nRyan: She—Theresa—is staying.\n\nSeth: Right got it. So she really is moving.\n\nRyan: It sucks.\n\nSeth: I think it’s because of me. I can’t believe I caused a girl to leave the state. The county, maybe, sure. Fine.\n\nRyan: You really think it’s ’cause of you?\n\nSeth: Well, I mean, we broke up, she went back East. She had a great time. She comes back, only to see me standing on a coffee cart declaring my eternal love for Summer.\n\nRyan: Maybe she just doesn’t feel that comfortable here. Not everyone does.\n\nSeth: I know, I get that. But if it is ’cause of me, maybe I can talk her out of it. Except for the fact that I can’t ask her if it’s ’cause of me without sounding totally self-absorbed. And I’m not self-absorbed, right Ryan? Me. Me.\n\nRyan: Huh?\n\nSeth: Me.\n\nRyan: Sorry.\n\nSeth: Me.\n\nRyan: Just thinking about Theresa.\n\nKirsten: This is my mistake, not yours. And I will not let you compromise yourself. Not even for me.\n\nJoel: Let me tell you something, Sandy. The Newport Group is Orange County’s Enron. You make this just a little bit difficult for me and I will come down on you as hard as I can.\n\nSandy: Oh wow. This must be a reelection year.\n\nJoel: Oh spare me. You and I have been friends for years. That’s probably why Caleb Nichol hired you. But it used to be, Sandy Cohen’s moral compass wouldn’t point him anywhere except the direction of truth. No matter who he took down.\n\nSandy: Ah, spoken like a man who’s never been married.\n\nRyan: You and Anna, you guys talk?\n\nSeth: Do not change the subject to me because I am powerless not to talk about it. I tried and she gave me a list of reasons why she’s leaving.\n\nRyan: You didn’t make the cut, did you?\n\nSeth: But she’s lying. I want her to know that, you know, I’m sorry I hurt her feelings but she doesn’t have to do this. She shouldn’t be doing this.\n\nRyan: Then just tell her.\n\nSeth: “Just tell her.” Simple. Honest. Direct. No wonder I never considered it. Okay fine. I will. I’ll tell her tonight but I have to have a little bubbly first. A little veritas and vino, know what I mean?\n\nRyan: Hardly ever.\n\nSummer about Marissa: She dated Luke for years. You can’t always trust her judgment.\n\nAnna: I just came to say goodbye. My plane’s leaving soon.\n\nSummer: You’re really leaving.\n\nAnna: Yeah.\n\nSummer: Well you might not believe this, but I’m gonna miss you.\n\nAnna: What’s even more unbelievable is that I’m going to miss you.\n\nSummer: Pretty unbelievable.\n\nAnna: Bye Blanche.\n\nSummer: See ya Rose.\n\nRyan: Thanks for teaching me how to waltz.\n\nAnna: Have the best life. You deserve it.\n\nSandy: I saw the D.A. today. It didn’t go what I would call “well.”\n\nCaleb: What’s the matter, Sandy? You cut deals for yours clients all the time.\n\nSandy: Yeah. Well usually they’re the\n\nones who have broken the law. Not me.\n\nTheresa: Okay. I’ll be here trying to spot the chin implants.\n\nCaleb: Hi Juju. I was wondering if you were going to ignore me all night.\n\nJulie: You seemed busy. Congratulations.\n\nCaleb: Thanks for coming. Can I drive you home?\n\nJulie: I can walk down the driveway.\n\nCaleb: Can I call you? Take you out on a real date. Things have gotten a little crazy. And I know I didn’t appreciate you. I want to. I want to make you feel appreciated.\n\nJulie: Plan the perfect date, run it by me. We’ll see.\n\nSeth: Come on, man, her flight leaves soon. Can we hurry?\n\nRyan: We’re doing 75 in a 65, alright?\n\nSeth: “75 in a 65”? Everyone knows 80’s the new 75.\n\nRyan: What? Who talks like that?\n\nSeth: What is up with this AC? My Jew-fro is frizzing out. I look like Screech.\n\nRyan: AC’s fine.\n\nSeth: What is this music?\n\nRyan to Seth: Do not insult Journey, alright?\n\nLike this quote? Check out the shirt.\n\nMarissa: Hey. How are you?\n\nTheresa: I’m just embarrassed. I can’t believe this huge fight at a fancy party.\n\nMarissa: Actually not the first time that’s happened.\n\nKirsten: I told you that I didn’t want you to get involved.\n\nSandy: I will always do what’s best for my family.\n\nKirsten: I would rather go to jail than be responsible for you being mixed up in this— getting into bed with my father.\n\nSandy: I promise you, I’d rather send you to jail that get in bed with your father.\n\nSeth: You love me. I read it. And I get it. I’m so sorry if I did anything to hurt your feelings or cause this, but I don’t want you to leave. Okay? None of us do.\n\nAnna: Seth, I love you. As a friend.\n\nSeth: What?\n\nAnna: Cohen I love you as a friend.\n\nSeth: It doesn’t say Azerbaijan?\n\nAnna: Look, I think you’re an amazing guy—a little self-absorbed, maybe— but great. I mean, if there’s one thing my relationship taught me it’s that we don’t have a lot of chemistry.\n\nSeth: So you’re not leaving because of me?\n\nAnna: I’m leaving because I need to leave. But who knows, maybe one day we’ll be perfect for each other. I don’t know. I do know I have to go to Pittsburgh. I’m moving, Seth. I thought I could make this ride alone, but I can’t. Thanks for coming. Saying goodbye.\n\nSeth: Anna, wait a second. What am I going to do without you? You’re so wise, and all your sage wisdom. What am I going do without that?\n\nAnna: Confidence, Cohen."
