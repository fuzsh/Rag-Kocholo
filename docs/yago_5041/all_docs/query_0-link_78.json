        "text": "Throwback Thursday may be tomorrow—but there’s been an epic TV reunion today that just can’t wait until then. One of the hottest shows of the early 2000s was The O.C.; since it went off the air in 2007, the cast members—including Mischa Barton, Adam Brody, Rachel Bilson, and Ben McKenzie—have gone their separate ways, working on a variety of different projects (Barton, for instance, is now starring, for some reason, on the reboot series of The Hills). But last night, two castmates from the hit show randomly bumped into each other at the airport: call it the most wondrous, unplanned O.C. reunion.\n\nThe two reunited stars in question? That’s Bilson and Brody, who played the on-again, off-again couple Summer Roberts and Seth Cohen on the show. “Ran into my ol buddy from jfk to lax,” Bilson wrote in the caption, Instagramming a photo of her, tongue sticking out, with Brody in an airport terminal.“ #californiaherewecome.”\n\nThese days, the actors have been busy doing their own thing; Brody has been keeping busy with gigs on shows such as StartUp and Curfew, and Bilson had stints on Hart of Dixie and Nashville. Seeing them back together again instantly had us feeling nostalgic for their drama-filled romance on The O.C. Seth, the lovable nerd, and Summer, the hot popular girl, were the breakout characters of the show—you wanted them to get married. (Spoiler: They did.)"
