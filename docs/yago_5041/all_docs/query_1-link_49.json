        "text": "Orange County, California was never the same after Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) came to town at the beginning of The O.C.s first season. From the moment this juvenile delinquent from Chino was taken in by the Cohen family, the socialite community of Newport Beach was turned upside down. Ryan quickly became the first friend that comic book geek Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) had ever had, and his bad boy charm attracted much attention-he drew the affections of popular Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson) and he was criticized by Newport moms all around, particularly Julie Cooper (Melinda Clarke). Unfortunately for Julie, her daughter Marissa (Mischa Barton) didnt share her views on the new boy in town. Thus the stage is set for (to date) four seasons of humor, love, betrayal, school, secrets, divorce, marriage, scandal, and death. The series follows Ryan Atwood, who always seems to be in a fight, Marissa Cooper, who always manages to find a way to get herself into trouble, Summer Roberts, who seems like a ditz on the exterior but actually has a lot to contribute, Seth Cohen, a nerd with a sense of humor, Sandy Cohen, his lawyer father, Kirsten Cohen, his hard-working wife, Julie Cooper, a greedy socialite, and Jimmy Cooper, her embezzling husband.
