        "text": "Blair Waldorf is marrying Seth Cohen.\n\nI repeat.\n\nBLAIR WALDORF IS MARRYING SETH COHEN.*\n\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST NEWS EVER, because the it means that the worlds of The O.C. and Gossip Girl, two of the most seminal television shoes of my generation, are finally colliding. I can officially die happy.\n\nFor those of you living under a rock for the last decade, Seth and Blair are the king and queen of the Josh Schwartz teen drama universe.\n\nSeth, albeit on first appearance the geeky second fiddle to Ryan Atwood’s leather cuff wearing brooding protagonist, was the driving force behind the wit, humor, and emo-laden indie music soundtrack that made The O.C. a tour de force in the mid-2000s. Seth is the guy whose best friend was a plastic horse named Captain Oats (I swear it was much more charming than it sounds), who coined the term Chrismakkuh, who perfectly summarized the insanity that was the Cohen-Atwood-Roberts-Cooper family tree when he said “It’s a tale as old as time. Boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy finds out girl is surrogate mom’s illegitimate step-mother,” who provided his girlfriend with a “Seth Cohen Starter Park” that included The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay and The Goonies and who might just be a stunning satire of Canada. In short, Seth totally stole the show and is awesome.\n\nBlair, albeit on first appearance the constant runner-up to Serena Van Der Woodsen’s cleavage-blessed protagonist, was similarly the driving force behind the wit, humor, and preppy-based fashion that made Gossip Girl a tour de force in the early 2010s. This is the girl who is responsible for the power headband fashion trend, deporting Georgina Sparks to Russia, making the Met steps a status symbol, turning Chuck Bass into a good person, and stating the obvious truth that “it’s so hard finding obedient minions.” In short, Blair is everything that I want to be and is awesome.\n\nWith the union of Blair and Seth and their mutual love of Thanksgiving, everything is FINALLY right in the world. I’ve been waiting for this moment since Blair said, with respect to Serena, “I’m sick of always looking like Darth Vader next to sunshine Barbie.” If that Star Wars reference wasn’t a mating call specifically meant for Seth Cohen, then I don’t know what is.\n\nOf course, this blessed event leaves me with SO many questions. Will Dorota be the maid of honor? Will Ryan Atwood be the best man? Will Captain Oats be present? Will he bring Princess Sparkles as his date to the wedding or will she refuse to attend out of loyalty to Summer Roberts, who was, after all, Seth’s first wife? Will the ghosts of Bart Bass and Marissa Cooper haunt their blessed union? Will Little J finally realize that the model who destroyed her fashion line was actually Kaitlyn Cooper? Will Blair walk down the aisle while Rufus Humphreys plays an acoustic cover of a song by The Shins on the mandolin?\n\nJust imagine the dorky law and Judaism conversations that Blair’s stepfather Cyrus and Seth’s dad Sandy will have at the reception! Kirsten Cohen and Lily Van Der Woodsen will drink the place out of Chardonnay in under an hour! Taylor Townsend and Neli Yuki will finally be united, which means that they will assuredly plot to take over the universe together, because they went to the Sorbonne and Yale and were smarter than all of the rest of those kids and its about time someone noticed!\n\nI, for one, could not be happier that Blair finally heard those “three words, eight letters” that she was always waiting for and that it was from Seth Cohen.\n\nMazel Tov!\n\n* Okay, fine, perhaps technically it is Leighton Meester and Adam Brody who are engaged, but whatever."
