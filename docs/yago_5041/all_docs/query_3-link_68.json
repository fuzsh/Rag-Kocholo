        "text": "01 of 16\n\nMischa Barton as Marissa Cooper\n\nThe girl next door wore Chanel on The O.C., where Barton played SoCal sweetheart-meets-damsel-in-distress Marissa Cooper until her character's tragic death in season 3. Barton would later claim that she departed the series because of \"bullying\" behind the scenes.\n\nWhen It girl Barton left The O.C., her career took a backseat to her partying ways, leading to a 2007 DUI arrest and a 2009 suicide threat. She opened up to PEOPLE about her ups and downs, explaining, \"It was a full-on breakdown.\" Barton also was involved in a high-profile revenge porn lawsuit against a former boyfriend who allegedly tried to sell a sex tape featuring Barton.\n\nFollowing her departure from The O.C., Barton landed a handful of other movie and TV appearances, from the supernatural thriller I Will Follow You Into the Dark (2012) to the TV pilot Gutsy Frog. In 2016, she competed on Dancing With the Stars and made headlines once again when she joined the cast of The Hills: New Beginnings reboot in 2019, but Barton left the series after the first season. Barton continues to appear regularly in films, including 2023's Invitation to a Murder.\n\n02 of 16\n\nRachel Bilson as Summer Roberts\n\nBilson melted hearts and perfected her tan as Summer Roberts, the popular girl who — you called it! — fell for the video game nerd (Brody's Seth Cohen). Off camera, Bilson and Brody took their relationship beyond the beach, dating from 2003 until 2006.\n\nThe actress' first big role post-O.C. saw her move from Orange County to Bluebell, Ala., where she played displaced New Yorker Dr. Zoe Hart on The CW's Hart of Dixie. She then headed for Nashville, where she played Alyssa Greene, and the short-lived ABC series Take Two. Her film roles include Jumper (2008), New York, I Love You (2008) and The To Do List (2013). Bilson hosts a podcast with former O.C. costar Melinda Clarke, called Welcome to the O.C., Bitches!\n\nBilson has one child, daughter Briar Rose, whom she welcomed in October 2014 with now-ex Hayden Christensen. In 2020, she broke up with Barry star Bill Hader after they dated for several months.\n\n03 of 16\n\nAdam Brody as Seth Cohen\n\nBrody's chic geek alter ego loved all things comic books, Chrismukkah and, of course, Summer Roberts. Besides taking his love for leading lady Bilson off-screen, he also introduced the show's tween fan base to indie bands like Death Cab for Cutie.\n\nSince finishing his comic books, Brody has taken on a variety of roles ranging from a lethal lead singer in the 2009 dark comedy Jennifer's Body to a porn star in 2013's Lovelace as well as a role in 2020's Academy Award-winning Promising Young Woman. He also got to play a superhero in 2019's Shazam! and its 2023 sequel, Shazam! Fury of the Gods. On TV, Brody has starred on series like StartUp and Single Parents and on the FX on Hulu miniseries Fleishman Is in Trouble.\n\nThough Brody didn't sail off into the sunset with Bilson on a \"Summer\" breeze, he ultimately wed fellow teen soap alum/former Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester (with whom he also starred in Single Parents!). The pair have two children together: a daughter Arlo Day, born in August 2015, and a son, born in 2020.\n\n04 of 16\n\nBen McKenzie as Ryan Atwood\n\nGood-looking bad boy Ryan Atwood brought as much drama as the Newport housewives when he navigated his post-Chino life and tidal wave-like relationship with Barton's Marissa Cooper — all while wearing his signature white tank top.\n\nTwo years after leaving his pool house residence, McKenzie joined the LAPD as Officer Ben Sherman on Southland, which aired until April 2013. He then took on the role of detective James Gordon on Gotham and Gotham Stories until 2019. McKenzie then made his Broadway debut in 2020's Grand Horizons, and appeared in Amazon Prime Video's 2022 rom-com I Want You Back.\n\nMcKenzie married his Gotham costar Morena Baccarin in 2017, and the pair welcomed their second child together in 2021.\n\n05 of 16\n\nOlivia Wilde as Alex Kelly\n\nWho got Olivia Wilde's kiss of approval on The O.C.? As Alex Kelly, she hooked up with both Seth Cohen (Brody) and Marissa Cooper (Barton), while also helping to run the local hot spot, the Bait Shop. Though Wilde only appeared in 13 episodes of The O.C., her character certainly made an impression.\n\nSince leaving The O.C., Wilde had a five-year stint on House M.D., roles in Tron: Legacy (2010) and on Vinyl as well as in Spike Jonze's New York Film Festival darling, Her. Wilde made her directorial debut with 2019's hit comedy Booksmart.\n\nRomantically, Wilde was engaged to Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis for seven years until they went their separate ways in 2020. The former pair share two children: son Otis and daughter Daisy. Wilde was then involved in a high-profile relationship with Harry Styles, who starred in her 2022 film Don't Worry Darling, which she also directed. However, Wilde and Styles split in November 2022.\n\n06 of 16\n\nPeter Gallagher as Sandy Cohen\n\nSandy Cohen, portrayed by Peter Gallagher, was the lawyer father of Seth — and, via adoption, Ryan — who always knew best.\n\nThe actor, whose Hollywood career long pre-dated The O.C. with films like 1989's Sex, Lies and Videotape, 1995's While You Were Sleeping and 1999's American Beauty, suited up as CIA Director of the National Clandestine Service on the USA drama Covert Affairs from 2010-2014. He then landed a recurring role on Law and Order: SVU as Deputy Chief William Dodds before going on to star in several other hit TV series, including Grace and Frankie and Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, and having a nine-episode arc on Grey's Anatomy.\n\nGallagher has been married to his wife Paula Harwood since 1983; the pair share two children, including Tony-nominated actress Kathryn Gallagher.\n\n07 of 16\n\nKelly Rowan as Kirsten Cohen\n\nKelly Rowan, who played Kirsten Cohen, the mother of Seth, adopted mother of Ryan and wife of Sandy, had her ups and downs with her family throughout the series. Before her role on The O.C., Rowan starred on Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years and many TV movies in both the United States and Canada.\n\nSince The O.C. ended, Rowan has had a few film and television roles, most notably starring on the TNT crime drama series Perception. She also produced several of her own projects, including the 2007 Lifetime movie In God's Country.\n\nIn 2007, she announced that she was engaged to billionaire David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet, though the pair never married. In April 2008, Rowan gave birth to a daughter.\n\n08 of 16\n\nMelinda Clarke as Julie Cooper\n\nBarton's on-screen mom, the ever-conniving (but always comedic!) Julie Cooper, had it going on — even when she had to trade in her mansion for a trailer park.\n\nMelinda Clarke's next major role was equally as intense; on the CW's Nikita she played Amanda Collins, the master manipulator of a hush-hush government-funded organization. The show ran from 2010 to 2013. Before, during and after her role on The O.C., Clarke had a recurring role on CSI as Lady Heather, appearing in six episodes and the series finale movie, CSI: Immortality (2015). She has also appeared in guest roles on series like Chuck, Eli Stone, Ghost Whisperer, The Vampire Diaries, Vegas, Dallas and Gotham. Clarke co-hosts the Welcome to the O.C., Bitches! podcast with former costar Bilson.\n\nClarke was previously married to Star Trek actor Ernie Mirich; the pair share a daughter together. In 2015, the actress wed professional river rafter Adam Farmer.\n\n09 of 16\n\nTate Donovan as Jimmy Cooper\n\nPlaying Marissa's often-troubled father Jimmy Cooper, Tate Donovan was part of the main cast of the first two seasons, followed by a few appearances in the final two seasons of the series.\n\nAfter the end of The O.C., Donovan jumped to another series, Damages, as part of the main cast — and he has been busy ever since with lead roles on Deception, Hostages, 24: Live Another Day, The Man in the High Castle and MacGyver. The actor also appeared in films like Nancy Drew (2007), Argo (2012), Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Rocketman (2019). He voiced Hercules in the 1997 Disney animated film, and he has continued to voice the character in the Kingdom Hearts video games and other media. Donovan has branched out into producing and directing, and he won a Primetime Emmy for directing the ESPN 30 for 30 Shorts installment that focused on the relationship between tennis legend Arthur Ashe and his brother, Johnnie.\n\nDonovan was previously married to Corinne Kingsbury. The couple divorced in 2008.\n\n10 of 16\n\nChris Carmack as Luke Ward\n\nChris Carmack’s breakthrough television role came in 2003 when he joined The O.C. cast as Luke Ward, Marrisa Cooper’s long term boyfriend who delivered the famous line: \"Welcome to the O.C., b----!\" After leaving the show in 2004, Carmack continued acting on series like Beach Girls, Related and even landed a starring role on Nashville. Since 2018, the now 42-year-old actor has appeared on ABC's Grey’s Anatomy as Dr. Atticus 'Link' Lincoln.\n\nIn addition to acting, Carmack also began a music career, releasing music on his own and with his wife, Erin Slaver as part of their band Life on Eris. Carmack and Slaver wed in October 2018 and are parents to two daughters, Kai and Cielle.\n\n11 of 16\n\nAutumn Reeser as Taylor Townsend\n\nAutumn Resser first appeared on television in the early 2000s, landing brief roles on Star Trek: Voyager, Undressed, Maybe It’s Me and George Lopez. Resser joined The O.C. cast in season three as Taylor Townsend, who initially has a rough start getting into the group, but ultimately gains their friendship.\n\nResser went on to appear in other series including Valentine, Entourage, No Ordinary Family, Last Resort and Hawaii 5-0. More recently, she's appeared in The Wedding Veil movies, produced by The Hallmark Channel with Lacey Chabert. Her most recent credit was 2023’s Beautiful Disaster which also starred Dylan Sprouse.\n\nShe shares two sons with her ex-husband, Jesse Warren.\n\n12 of 16\n\nWilla Holland as Kaitlin Cooper\n\nWilla Holland’s role as Marissa’s younger sister, Kaitlin, on The O.C. was the actress’ first big on-screen gig. The character was initially played by Shailene Woodley, before Holland stepped in for seasons three and four.\n\nSince the series wrapped in 2007, Holland has stepped into roles in films including Middle of Nowhere, Legion, Straw Dogs and the starring role in the film adaptation of Judy Blume’s Tiger Eyes. Her longest-running role was Thea Queen on Arrow from 2012 to 2020.\n\n13 of 16\n\nCam Gigandet as Kevin Volchok\n\nCam Gigandet’s role as Kevin Volchok on the third and fourth seasons of The O.C. was one of the actor’s first major roles. From there, he landed numerous film roles in Never Back Down, Easy A, Burlesque, The Roommate and is perhaps most known for his role as James in Twilight. He has also appeared in two television series since wrapping The O.C.: Reckless and Ice.\n\nMore recently, Gigandet starred in Violent Night with David Harbour, Shrapnel and 'Til Death Do Us Part.\n\nHe shares three children, Everleigh, Rekker, and Armie with ex Dominique Nicole Geisendorff, who filed for divorce from the actor in August 2022.\n\n14 of 16\n\nAlan Dale as Caleb Nichol\n\nWhen Alan Dale stepped into the role of Caleb Nichol — Seth Cohen’s grandfather — in season one of The O.C., he had decades of acting credits to his name dating back to the late '70s. The New Zealand native had recurring roles on shows like Radio Waves and The Young Doctors and, in the early 2000s, appeared briefly on ER, The West Wing and 24. From 1985 to 2019 Dale played Jim Robinson on the Australian soap, The Neighbours.\n\nAfter departing The O.C. in season two, Dale continued to act, appearing in series like Ugly Betty, Lost, Entourage (reprising his role in the 2015 film), NCIS and Once Upon a Time. He most recently appeared in the Dynasty reboot from 2017 to 2021.\n\n15 of 16\n\nSamaire Armstrong as Anna Stern\n\nAfter beginning her career on television in the early 2000s, landing brief roles on shows like Party of Five, Freaks and Geeks and ER, Samaire Armstrong joined the cast of The O.C. in 2003 as transfer student Anna Stern. While on The O.C., she also snagged a role on Entourage, playing the recurring role of Emily from 2004 to 2005.\n\nFollowing her time on The O.C., Armstrong continued to act, appearing in Just My Luck with Lindsay Lohan, Dirty Sexy Money, The Mentalist, and Resurrection, with additional one-off appearances on Agent Carter, Arrow and Grey’s Anatomy. Most recently she appeared in the 2022 film, Terror on the Prairie.\n\nArmstrong, who welcomed a son in 2012, ran for mayor in Sedona, Arizona in 2022 but wound up losing to Scott Jablow.\n\n16 of 16\n\nMichael Cassidy as Zach Stevens\n\nMichael Cassidy broke into TV and film playing Zach Stevens — a comic book enthusiast who strikes up a romance with Summer Roberts during season 2. After his stint on the series, Cassidy shared the screen with big names like Tim Allen and Courtney Cox in the 2006 comedy Zoom. His later film credits include cameos in the Oscar-winning film Argo and the ensemble rom-com Dog Days.\n\nAs a television star, Cassidy went on to appear as a recurring character on drama series Hidden Palms, Privileged and Smallville. He held a main cast role on the sitcom Men at Work during its entire three-season run from 2012 through 2014. The O.C. alum has continued on the small screen with roles on Station 19, Mythic Quest and Good Trouble, the spinoff of Freeform’s The Fosters."
