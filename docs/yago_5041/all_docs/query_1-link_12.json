        "text": "Seth Cohen is a fictional character on FOX series The O.C., played by Adam Brody.\n\nSeth Ezekiel Cohen lives in Newport Beach, California, though he was born in Berkeley. He is Jewish on his father's side, and connects and identifies with his father's religious and cultural background (though he embraces the mutual holiday of Chrismukkah). Seth is a very sarcastic guy, and loves to make sarcastic jokes about the events that occur around him. He is a self-proclaimed geek and likes comic books, science fiction, video games, and old movies. He also has a toy horse named Captain Oats. Seth is the adoptive brother of Ryan Atwood and the brother of baby Sophie Rose Cohen.\n\nSeth is the son of Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. He was befriended at the start of the series by Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) and has enjoyed a rise in popularity ever since then. Before Ryan's arrival, he was basically ignored by most of his peers. Soon after Ryan's arrival, Seth became friends with Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and started dating Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson). Seth's goal was to attend Brown University but he ends up going to RISD and continuing work on his comic book, \"Atomic County.\""
