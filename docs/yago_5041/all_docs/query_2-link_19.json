        "text": "Rachel Bilson claims that The OC’s love triangle between her, Adam Brody and Samaire Armstrong’s characters spilled over into real life.\n\nThe actress began dating Adam when they started filming the teen series as Summer Roberts and Seth Cohen respectively, and stayed together for three years before breaking up while still on the show.\n\nIn the first season, Seth found himself in a love triangle between his long-time crush Summer and new girl Anna (played by Samaire Armstrong), who was basically the female version of Seth.\n\nAnd while discussing the episode where Seth attempts to juggle the two women at his parents’ house, Rachel admitted that there was some rivalry off set, too.\n\nSpeaking on her and Melinda Clarke’s podcast Welcome To The OC, B****es about the episode The Homecoming, with guest Kelly Rowan, the 39-year-old said: ‘There’s a scene with Seth and Summer in the pool house, and I think we’re making out and we’re laughing, and I can tell that we’re really laughing. Like, I can tell it’s a real moment where Adam and I were messing around, as opposed to Seth and Summer.\n\n‘And then Seth is in the bedroom with Anna and she goes to kiss him, I see Samaire slip tongue!\n\n‘I’m watching it and she slipped the tongue and me, I get transported back to 18 years ago and I get a little jealous! And I’m like, “Um, what are you doing slipping tongue in his mouth?”\n\n‘It was like the real-life triangle playing out as I’m watching it. I saw the tongue and I was like, “There’s no tongue in television!”’\n\nRachel added: ‘I feel like it definitely played out a little bit in real life for a minute. Not really really, but I remember the tension with Samaire and I, a little bit. ‘Cause it was just this triangle or whatever.’\n\nWhile Seth initially chose Anna, sense prevailed and he ended up with Summer, with their relationship spanning all four seasons of The OC.\n\nIn real life, Rachel and Adam, 41, dated for three years before parting ways, but remain on good terms, having shared a selfie together when they bumped into each other at the airport in 2019.\n\nRachel went on to have a nine-year relationship with her Jumper co-star Hayden Christensen, with whom she shares six-year-old daughter Briar Rose, which ended in 2017.\n\nMost recently, she dated comedian Bill Hader.\n\nMeanwhile, Adam went on to marry another co-star – Gossip Girl’s Leighton Meester, who he met while filming the movie The Oranges in 2010.\n\nThe couple, who tied the knot in 2014, have two children together.\n\nSamaire, who went on to star in Dirty Sexy Money, welcomed a son with then-boyfriend Jason Christopher in 2012, and has recently become known for her outspoken pro-Trump and anti-mask views on social media.\n\nMORE : Netflix’s new true crime series Once Upon a Crime has a game-changing hook"
