        "text": "Seth Cohen and Summer Roberts are undoubtedly one of the most beloved TV show couples ever and many fans of The OC often like to imagine what life would be like for the adorable pair these days.\n\nWell, Rachel Bilson has just given an update on the pair’s relationship and considering she’s the gal that brought Summer to life, we’re inclined to believe her.\n\nIt’s been over a decade since the show came to an end and while speaking to US Weekly, Rachel, 38, joked that she often has to remind herself about how their story ended on screen.\n\n‘Oh my gosh, I try to remember. I’m like, “What happened at the end?” I think Seth and Summer got married,’ she admitted.\n\nWhen asked if she thinks the duo would still be together, she added: ‘Yeah, sure. Why not? You always want a happy ending.’\n\nYes, we do, Rachel. Yes, we really do!\n\nAs many of you know, Rachel and her co-star Adam Brody dated on and off while filming, but sadly their love wasn’t forever.\n\nBut the pair still say hi whenever they bump into each other, especially when it comes as surprise while preparing to board flights at an airport.\n\nBack in August, Rachel shared her run-in ex Adam, 39, on Instagram with a playful selfie of the pair.\n\nThe actress, who played rich b**** turned philanthropist Summer from 2003 until 2007, captioned the pic: ‘Ran into my ol buddy from jfk to lax #californiaherewecome.’\n\nWhile fans totally freaked out over the pair briefly reuniting, The OC creator deadpanned it in the comments, replying: ‘Sorry don’t get the reference.’\n\nAfter breaking up in 2006, Rachel went on to have a nine-year relationship with Hayden Christensen, with whom she has a daughter, Briar Rose, but the couple split in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Shazam! star Adam had a bit of a teen drama crossover when he married Gossip Girl’s Leighton Meester in 2014.\n\nMORE : Rachel Bilson celebrates The OC’s 15th anniversary with epic throwback"
