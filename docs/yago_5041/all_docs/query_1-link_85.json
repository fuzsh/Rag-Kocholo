        "text": "We’re never going back to Orange County. Year after year, a rumor flares up that The O.C., Fox’s O.G. aughties teen drama, will get a revival, reuniting the world with the neurotic inner lives of Seth Cohen, Ryan Atwood, and Summer Roberts (RIP, Marissa). And yet, every year the rumor dissipates with absolutely nothing to show for it. At this year’s TCAs, Fox entertainment boss Michael Thorn officially confirmed that a revival of the hit show is definitely not in the works.\n\n“The O.C. will not happen despite my deep passion for it to come back,” he told Deadline. “No one is available, unfortunately.”\n\nIt’s not for lack of trying, however. “I would be lying if I said I didn’t ask every June,” he added. Well, why wouldn’t he? This is the show that perfected the angsty teen drama, gave us a weekly dose of Peter Gallagher’s inimitable brows, and inadvertently inspired shows like Laguna Beach and The Real Housewives of Orange County, which, as we all know, led to a bigger, badder Housewives empire (Andy Cohen, run Josh Schwartz his check!). It would be true bliss to be reunited with Seth and Summer, to see how Ryan (Ben McKenzie) from Chino is living now as a fancy architect. Maybe he follows through on the promise that the finale made, with Ryan mentoring a down-on-his-luck kid much like himself, starting the cycle all over again.\n\nBut maybe no revival is for the best. The latter seasons of the show (i.e., post-Marissa) were never as strong as the early years. Maybe we don’t need to see formative teen crush Seth Cohen (Adam Brody) all grown up, neuroticizing over boring adult worries like his 401(k) and trying desperately to follow up his one hit idea, Chrismukkah. Meanwhile, Summer’s (Rachel Bilson) story lines would probably hit a little too close to home, what with her environmental activism ramping up by the show’s original end. By now she’s probably the Greta Thunberg of the O.C., urging all her neighboring conservative, vapid mansion-havers to care about the earth for one single second.\n\nAt this rate, though, we’ll never know. As Thorn said, the cast is fairly busy, and Schwartz seems determined not to look backward. As Deadline notes, the O.C. creator put his foot down, saying last year that, “For us, that was a very, very singular story. We felt like we completed that tale by the end.”\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n— Why Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: is too desperate to be loved to take any real risks\n\n— Little Women’s man problem\n\n— From The Irishman to Fleabag, here’s all you need to know about this year’s Golden Globe nominees\n\n— The Rise of Skywalker cameos you might have missed\n\n— Inside the Richard Jewell controversy—and the complicated truth about Kathy Scruggs\n\n— Here’s why Tom Hooper’s Cats is a tragical mess of Mistoffelees\n\n— From the Archive: Julia Roberts— Hollywood's Cinderella and the belle of the box office\n\nLooking for more?
