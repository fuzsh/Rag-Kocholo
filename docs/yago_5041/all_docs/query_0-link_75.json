        "text": "Surprise! Seth Cohen, the dream boyfriend of alternative girls everywhere in the early aughts, was actually a terrible boyfriend. If you ever are in the mood to re-watch the magic that is The O.C. — it's streaming now! — Seth's neuroses and self-absorption will become all too clear. This isn't an ideal suitor to fantasize about; he's the guy every girl dates because he's indie and seems sweet, until you realize he's really just a little bleep on a boat.\n\nChances were, if you owned a studded belt courtesy of Hot Topic but somehow managed to pair it with a Juicy Couture hoodie, Seth Cohen was (and maybe still is) your dream guy. Back when The O.C. premiered, there weren't any emo boys on television. With Seth Cohen, the concert going, skinny jean-wearing uncool cool guy came to life on screen — so handsome and awkward, he helped coin the term “adorkable.”\n\nThe soapy O.C. was one of the first teen shows to create a relatable male character, but just because he wasn't a so-called bad boy like Ryan Atwood, doesn't mean he didn't act like one, only with no hoodies and scowling necessary. Most girls who grew up obsessed with the fantasy of a nerdy, handsome Seth Cohen type quickly realized he was wildly overrated when they found a anxious, narcissistic Cohen of their own for these reasons."
