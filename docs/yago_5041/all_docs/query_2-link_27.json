        "text": "#10: Summer Poses for Seth’s Comic Book\n\n“The Second Chance”\n\nIn Season 2, Seth has begun collaborating on a comic book with Zach Stevens - while Zach has started dating Summer. As their deadline looms, Seth is forced to drop by Summer’s room to draw her for the project. Although it’s a tense meeting at first, the pair’s unresolved feelings quickly surface and they end up nose-to-nose on the bed. For fans of the couple, there’s nothing better than seeing them go from bitter adversaries to crushing hard in a matter of minutes. Even though Seth excuses himself when things start to heat up, his and Summer’s loaded encounter foreshadows their emotional reunion later in the season.\n\n#9: The Proposal\n\n“The Earth Girls Are Easy”\n\nWhen Seth, Summer, Ryan, and Taylor embark on a road trip to celebrate New Year’s Eve in Last Vegas and Summer loses her pregnancy test, it prompts a proposal in classic Seth Cohen fashion. With neither party knowing if a child is in their future, Seth pulls out a hideous ring and tells Summer he’s in it for the long haul. Although he’d been relieved when he mistakenly thought the test belonged to Taylor, this moment demonstrates Seth’s maturity and seriousness when it comes to his relationship. Of course, the couple soon finds out that there is no pregnancy - but it's still a downright heartwarming moment.\n\n#8: Seth’s Prom Speech\n\n“The O.Sea”\n\nWith prom around the corner, Seth and Zach toss a coin to decide who will accompany Summer and who will meet George Lucas for dinner. Zach scores the date with Summer, but he soon leaves her high and dry while Seth arrives at the dance right on time. The nerdy charmer leaps onstage to crown himself prom king alongside his one-time girlfriend, and the moment captures both the awkwardness and courage that make Seth lovable. Never one to bottle up his feelings, he endures the taunts of his peers to declare his love - and unlike the crowd, we can’t get enough.\n\n#7: The Awkward One-Night Stand\n\n“The Secret”\n\nSeason 1 finds Seth pulled between his longtime crush Summer and his kindred spirit and fellow nerd Anna. After he and Anna break up due to his unresolved feelings, Seth shows up at Summer’s door to explain. The pair sleeps together for the first time, but despite their electric chemistry, the experience is a dud. Although the silence after their tryst is absolutely cringe-worthy, it’s equally hilarious to witness. With so much on the line for the burgeoning couple, the scene ramps up the drama as the lovers question their own compatibility. “The O.C.” isn’t always realistic in its depiction of teenage life, but this scene’s painful awkwardness is pitch-perfect.\n\n#6: The Do-Over\n\n“The Heartbreak”\n\nSeeing characters work through the melodramas of adolescence is a hallmark of this beloved teen soap. That’s why Seth and Summer getting over their less-than-stellar first - and second - sexual experiences stands out as a classic moment. After their second attempt at getting it on goes haywire, a defeated Seth apologizes at a Valentine’s Day benefit. To his surprise, Summer pays him a visit and they reflect on what made their sparks fizzle. It’s a moment of remarkable maturity and honesty for two teenagers, culminating in a decision to start their relationship over. And the slow-dance to “Wonderwall”? That’s just a bonus.\n\n#5: “You’re My Destiny, Cohen”\n\n“The End’s Not Near, It’s Here”\n\nWhile much of Summer’s arc in Season 4 concerns a loved one’s tragic death, the show’s final stretch also finds her discovering a calling as an activist. In the series finale, though, Summer has shelved her dreams of environmental advocacy for a hum-drum life. Finally, she takes up a promising job offer and must say a temporary goodbye to her boyfriend. Although by this time, the couple has been through just about every break-up in the book, it’s finally clear that both parties are unwaveringly committed. In one line, Summer manages to summarize an entire show’s worth of ups and downs, and it’s simply beautiful to see.\n\n#4: The Wedding\n\n“The End’s Not Near, It’s Here”\n\nSeth and Summer’s nuptials only take up a few brief seconds in “The O.C.'''s final episode, but they represent a monumental moment for the star-crossed lovers. After a flash-forward that depicts other characters pursuing their professional and academic goals, we see a positively radiant Summer walking down the aisle. Although the scene contains no dialogue, Summer’s bashful smile does all the talking. Of course, the touching moment just wouldn’t be complete without the bride sticking her tongue out at her groom. A mix of romance and sardonic humor defines Seth and Summer’s relationship - why should their wedding be any different?\n\n#3: Seth Recites Summer’s Sixth-Grade Poem\n\n“The Girlfriend”\n\nEarly in the first season of “The O.C.,” Seth is vying for the affection of his childhood crush. Although they seem to strike up a friendship and even attend an important party together, it becomes evident that Summer is only using him to meet eligible bachelors. When Seth lambasts Summer’s suitors for making no attempt to get to know her, his own attentiveness becomes abundantly clear. We don’t get to hear the full poem, but we do get to see the duo’s very first - and very spontaneous - kiss. With Summer paying attention to her longtime classmate for practically the first time, this scene marks a huge shift in the pair’s dynamic.\n\n#2: The Upside-Down “Spider-Man” Kiss\n\n“The Rainy Day Women”\n\nIt’s no secret that throughout the show’s run, Summer’s feelings for Seth are complicated. It doesn’t help that at the end of Season 1, Seth sets sail on a months-long trip without a word. But as Summer prepares to fully move on by jetting off to Italy with Zach, she spots a child that reminds her of Seth. When she ditches the airport for the Cohen house, she finds her old flame has fallen off the roof while adjusting the satellite dish. With Seth sporting a “Spider-Man” mask as raingear, this scene hilariously combines the pop culture references and grand romantic gestures that “The O.C.” does so well. And when two beloved characters finally reunite with a touching kiss, we couldn’t be happier.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nSummer Gets Jealous for the First Time, “The Perfect Couple”\n\nThe Popular Girl Is Shocked at Her Own Feelings for Her Nerdy Classmate\n\nSummer Dresses Up as Wonder Woman, “The Best Chrismukkah Ever”\n\nBecause Summer Is No Stranger to Romantic Gestures, Either\n\nSeth & Summer Remodel Marissa's Room, “The Proposal”\n\nA Conversation About a Studfinder Has Never Been So Entertaining\n\nSeth Tries to Win Summer Back, “The Way We Were”\n\nHe Puts It All on the Line in This Dramatic Confrontation\n\nSnow Angels, “The Game Plan”\n\nSeth & Summer Adorably Prepare For College Life & Rhode Island Winters\n\n#1: Seth Confesses His Love on the Coffee Cart\n\nSummer would later recreate this iconic scene in Season 3 in a last-ditch effort to save their relationship. But it’s Seth’s original declaration that stands out as an absolute classic. While the couple has finally begun a relationship near the end of the first season, Summer is not exactly embracing her boyfriend at school. When she tells Seth she wants their relationship kept private, it inspires a public display of affection if ever there was one. Seth jumping on the coffee cart to announce his love illustrates his commitment and his bravery, while Summer is finally able to put aside her own judgments. With a rousing soundtrack, this triumphant and long-overdue moment is about as swoon-worthy as teen TV gets."
