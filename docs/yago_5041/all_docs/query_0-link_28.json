Really, where did you here that ?\n\nAnnegelic said:\n\nNah.. even if Seth and Anna are more compatible, he had feelings for Summer the whole time.. so it wouldn't be fair to Anna. and they seem better as best friends anyway.\n\nYep:uhhuh:!\n\nNot-That-Bright said:\n\ni'm pretty sure a 'new girl' will come to the school who has 'heaps of style' and grabs his attention, forcing a fight between this new girl and summer.\n\nPersonally i'm hoping for bikini mud wrestling.\n\nUnfortunately, you are probably right .\n\nhow u doin? said:\n\nhe should have stuck with anna dammit!\n\n2. summer was a massive bitch to seth at the start of the series, and only started to like him when anna started liking him.\n\nI actually think she was starting to warm up to him before Anna turned up again. It was just taking her a while to get to know him. Admittedly, Anna's arrival probably sped up the process .\n\nCandypants said:\n\nNOO Ryan (Mackenzie fella) is not gay. Either that or he's bisexual. He and Mischa Barton (Marissa) dated for a solid amound of time while they were doing the show. Apparently.\n\nMaybe he has recently discovered the fact ?\n\nMy opinion: Seth and Summer !\n\nmizz_smee said:\n\nits not there anymore\n\nwat did it say about them?\n\nim happy they are getting married\n\nthey look like they'd be a good couple\n\non and off screen\n\nYou had to go back a day.... here it is (hopefully):\n\n'The OC' Lovers Engaged?\n\nThe OC stars and onscreen lovers Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson have secretly got engaged in real life. Brody and Bilson play teenagers Seth Cohen and Summer Roberts respectively in the hit American TV show, which follows the tangled love lives of rich youngsters living in Orange County, California. The onscreen couple have tried to hide their offscreen romance for as long as possible, but now their engagement is official they are looking for a house together in Los Angeles. A source at US television network Fox says, \"They are both so much in love and want to settle down together. Adam went down on bended knee in a very traditional way and they plan to get married in the new year. It's the talk of the set, but they have been trying to keep it quiet.\"\n\nMerethrond said:\n\nI actually think she was starting to warm up to him before Anna turned up again. It was just taking her a while to get to know him. Admittedly, Anna's arrival probably sped up the process . My opinion: Seth and Summer !\n\nDoes no one remeber the cotillian (that girls becoming women in society thing) Summer was a bitch to Seth, and then when she had no date tried to make Seth chose her over Anna. she even said, \"common Cohen, youll go with me, you;ve always had a thing for me\".\n\nAnd then at Calab's birthday, (even though she did kiss him in the end) she was a fucking bitch then too.\n\nhmmm. as im typing this she just made out with seth in public. but she's still a bitch who doesn't deserve him!! chose Anna!! (yes, im blindly passionate about this issue)\n\nhow u doin? said:\n\nDoes no one remeber the cotillian (that girls becoming women in society thing) Summer was a bitch to Seth, and then when she had no date tried to make Seth chose her over Anna. she even said, \"common Cohen, youll go with me, you;ve always had a thing for me\".\n\nAnd then at Calab's birthday, (even though she did kiss him in the end) she was a fucking bitch then too.\n\nhmmm. as im typing this she just made out with seth in public. but she's still a bitch who doesn't deserve him!! chose Anna!!
