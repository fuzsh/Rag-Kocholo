        "text": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at Notre Dame chapter.\n\nOne of the defining shows of our generation, The O.C. (AKA the OG Laguna Beach), had its fair share of fantastic characters, but Seth Cohen remains the standout of the series with his quintessentially a-dork-able personality. His relationship with Summer was #goals, and his bromance with Ryan proves he’s more than just a cute face. He’s the perfect guy for just about anything.\n\nAs A Homie…\n\nHe keeps it real with his sarcastic comments.\n\nHis nerdiness makes him different, which makes him cool. It’s kind of a weird paradox.\n\nHe has your back with his subtle sass.\n\nHe’s got fresh dance moves for when you go out.\n\nAnd Captain Oats will complete your squad.\n\nAs A Lover…\n\nHe pulls off stellar grand gestures.\n\nYou can look forward to some epic kisses.\n\nHe’s a pretty sensitive guy.\n\nHe’s got an adorable face.\n\nHe’ll look at you the way he looks at Summer Roberts.\n\nAs A Friend…\n\nHe’s always loyal, even when you do something regrettable.\n\nYou get to celebrate Christmukkah with him every year.\n\nHe’s willing to go along with any crazy scheme you might have.\n\nBut he’s also always down to stay in and chill.\n\nHe’s a fantastic listener.\n\nHence, why I’m obsessed with Seth Cohen. RIP The O.C.\n\nFollow HCND on Twitter, like us on Facebook, Pin with us and show our Instagram some love!"
