        "text": "We've been on the run, driving in the sun, looking out for number one -- California, here we come, right back where we started from...\n\nâ€”Phantom Planet, \"California\", The O.C. theme song.\n\nThe OC is the story of Ryan Atwood, a troubled teenager from Chino, and the family who takes him in, the Cohens. Ryan and his brother are arrested for grand theft auto, but Ryan's idealistic public defender, Sandy Cohen, recognizes Ryan's intelligence and offers him a way out. When Ryan's alcoholic mother and her abusive boyfriend kick him out, Ryan has no choice but to call Sandy.\n\nRyan is thrust into the glamorous world of Orange County, and into the lives of the Cohens and their neighbors. There's Kirsten Cohen, Sandy's wife; nerdy Seth Cohen, their son; Marissa Cooper, their beautiful but troubled neighbor; Julie Cooper, Marissa's scheming mother; and Summer Roberts, Marissa's best friend. Ryan's first meeting with Marissa sets off sparks--too bad she's dating a Jerk Jock. Seth has loved Summer for years--too bad she doesn't know he exists.\n\nWith Ryan around, things are changing fast. Ryan, Marissa, Seth, and Summer are about to endure breaking up, breaking down, parties, proms... everything teenagers would normally be expected to go through, but with the added drama of living in the O.C.\n\nThis is a show about references. When you hang a guy upside down in the rain for a kiss from his main babe, and you are not shooting the movie Spider-Man, you are up to your ass in Post Modernism.\n\nOne official All The Tropes Wiki No-Prize is up for grabs for each example of an other-media reference from this show.\n\nNot to be confused with an abbreviation for Original Character.\n\nTropes used in The OC include:\n\nAborted Arc: At the end of Season One, we learn that the Newport Group is virtually bankrupt; Sandy and Jimmy inadvertently foil Caleb's scheme to rescue it. While the DA keeps investigating Caleb in Season Two, the issue of, you know, bankruptcy is forgotten about. In fact Kirsten takes over the Newport Group's accounting in Season Two and never mentions a thing. Except, surprise! In Season Three, it turns out Caleb was bankrupt after all.\n\nAbuse Is Okay When It Is Female On Male: A lot of Taylor's behavior towards Ryan would probably be condemned if she were a guy, but because she's a girl, it's played off as a cute quirk of character. She:\n\nbreaks up with him, but then spends seven hours outside of his workplace with binoculars, spying on him (she follows him in disguise later on).\n\napplies to Berkeley, his college of choice, without telling him.\n\ntries to force him into saying he loves her so her applying to Berkeley is justified.\n\ngets him drunk in an effort to make him do the above.\n\nsays (jokingly, but it's still cringe-worthy) that she wants to tie him to a chair and inject him with sodium penthanol in order to make him admit his feelings.\n\nAbusive Parents: Frank Atwood and many of Ryan's mother's boyfriends. Ryan gets hit in the face by one five minutes into the Pilot.\n\nAll Girls Like Ponies:\n\nSummer and Princess Sparkle.\n\nKaitlin's pony China who had alopecia.\n\nSeth and Captain Oats.\n\nAlternative Foreign Theme Song: \"Ore to Omae no Atarashii Kisetsu\" by B'z is used as the Japanese ending theme.\n\nAlternate Universe: In one episode, Ryan and Taylor fall off a ladder and end up in one of these, where Ryan never came to the O.C. and Taylor was born a boy. Everyone has changed for the worse (like Kirsten who turned into her father, Sandy who became a Republican, Seth who never stopped being a wallflower and Summer became an even more vapid bimbo -- though Marissa still died) except for Veronica, who is \"still a bitch\" as Taylor resignedly points out. Luckily, it was All Just a Dream.\n\nAuthor Avatar: Seth Cohen is Josh Schwartz.\n\nBait and Switch: In this example from 3.18:\n\nBatman Gambit: Caleb Nichols almost pulls this off in Season One. This results in Jimmy punching him in the face and ruining his deal in a Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n\nBitch in Sheep's Clothing: Its arguable whether Seth started as one or Took a Level in Jerkass.\n\nBi the Way: Alex Kelly and Marissa Cooper.\n\nBook Ends\n\nThe Bus Came Back: Kaitlin.\n\nCall Back: A few.\n\nRyan finding Marissa standing alone outside of their prom (2x23, \"The O.Sea\") is a callback to when he found her after Cotillion (1x04, \"The Debut\"). Similarly, when he gives her his jacket a few episodes before (2x18, \"The Risky Business\"), it parallels when he gave her his suit jacket after Cotillion.\n\nA more heartbreaking one for them is when he carries her away from the burning car shortly before her death (3x25, \"The Graduates\"). It parallels when he carried her to the pool house (1x01, \"Pilot\") and out of the alley in Tijuana (1x07, \"The Escape\").\n\nSeth's coffee cart proclamation of love to Summer (1x20, \"The Telenovela\") is reprized by Summer two years later (3x21, \"The Dawn Patrol\"). It doesn't go nearly so well for her.\n\nSeth intruding on Summer and Zack's TV time (2x12, \"The Lonely Hearts Club\") is a callback to Summer intruding on him and Anna (1x16, \"The Links\").\n\nKirsten finds Ryan with Lindsay (2x08, \"The Power of Love\") in almost the exact same position she found him with Marissa (1x10, \"The Perfect Couple\").\n\nSeth being stealth(2x07) and tagging along with Ryan (4x02).\n\nCannot Spit It Out: Hardly an episode goes by without the use of this trope.\n\nCan't Hold His Liquor: Seth Cohen is stealth.\n\nCatch Phrase: \"Bang!\"; \"Eww!\"\n\nCelebrity Paradox: Seth makes a reference to the vomiting little girl from The Sixth Sense... who was played by Mischa Barton, also known as Marissa.\n\nCharacter Development: Luke from a jerk jock to a good friend, Marissa from a normal schoolgirl to a tortured teen, Ryan from a hot-headed teenager to a calmer young man, Summer from a air-headed bimbo to... well, a nice air-headed bimbo and then to nice air-headed bimbo with a conscience. With good SAT scores. Who, despite having very high potential intelligence, is still at the age 18 entirely unaware what 'jihad' means.\n\nCharacterization Marches On: Compare Summer's personality in the first couple of episodes with the rest of the series: she comes across as a lot less likeable, a slutty , obnoxious, party girl airhead who dumps her unconscious best friend in her driveway after a night out. Likewise original flavor Taylor is very different from the adorable Genki Girl she became, being a bitchy Smug Snake who is fooling around with a teacher (a Sadist Teacher at that). Neither character was originally intended to be a regular but the unexpected appeal of Rachel Bilson and Autumn Reeser meant they ended up staying on and developing into quite different characters.\n\nChronic Hero Syndrome: Ryan Atwood. Lampshaded at separate times by different characters in Season 1, 2, 3, and 4. One episode in Season 3 had Kirsten helping Ryan to figure out he doesn't need to help every Damsel in Distress anymore. One episode in Season 4 had Sandy helping Ryan to figure out he needs to help every Damsel in Distress because it's \"his thing\" and he \"shouldn't turn his back on that.\"\n\nChronic Villainy: Julie Cooper switches between trying to be a good mom and being a gold-digging manipulative slut schizophrenically throughout the series.\n\nChuck Cunningham Syndrome: Rachel in Season One. They were setting her up with Jimmy, and then she just... disappeared, never to be mentioned again, despite being Sandy's colleague.\n\nShe \"went on vacation.\"\n\nCleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends\n\nCloudcuckoolander - Taylor and Che.\n\nColor-Coded for Your Convenience: Chino is CSI New York (grainy and desaturated). Orange County is Miami (lush colors).\n\nConflict Ball: Carried by various characters. Often manifests itself in willfully misunderstanding the other person (see Cannot Spit It Out above).\n\nContinuity Nod: Oh so very many. One notable one is the phrase 'salting your game' as an indication of cock-blocking. Used first by Ryan to Seth, half a season later from Seth to his dad, and then in Season 2 by Sandy to his wife.\n\nCoolest Club Ever: The Bait Shop.\n\nCool Loser: Seth Cohen. Then, eventually every character in the main cast.\n\nCool Ship: The Summer Breeze, an awesome Hobie mini-catamaran that Seth owned in Season 1, and pawned for bus-fare in Season 2.\n\nCunning Linguist: Taylor Townsend is fluent in French, Korean and Spanish and is able to use enough Latin to deliver her valedictorian speech in that language.\n\nDeadpan Snarker:\n\nSeth Cohen.\n\nSandy.\n\nRyan also had some moments of this, thanks to Seth's influence.\n\nSummer. She claimed once that she never used irony until she met Seth.\n\nAnna.\n\nAlex as well.\n\nDefrosting Ice Queen: Kirsten, before Ryan joined the family and caused her to soften. Lampshaded in a touching scene in the fourth season premiere \"The Avengers\", when Seth puts together a comic book illustrating the Cohens' lives before he joined the family.\n\nDied in Your Arms Tonight: Marissa, in Ryan's, in the Season 3 finale.\n\nDiegetic Switch: Though not as often as Sorry I Left the BGM On.\n\nDoom Magnet: In-universe, Ryan is accused of being one early in the show by Julie.\n\nMarissa Cooper, especially in Season 3. In fact, when you factor in that her death at the end of the third season was followed by the much Lighter and Softer fourth season - Everything literally got better for the characters after Marissa's death. Possibly lampshaded in a Freeze-Frame Bonus in the Alternate Universe/All Just a Dream episode.[1]\n\nDrugs Are Bad: Chris Brown gets upset when Kaitlin offers him weed.\n\nDumb Blonde: Holly Fischer. Not so much in the first season when she was unpleasant but not noticeably dim but when Holly eventually returned after an absence of two whole seasons she'd enthusiastically embraced the vapidity within.\n\nExpy: Casey, Dennis and Chili at Newport union were pretty blatant expy's of Ryan, Summer and Seth, with the flip that the Summer-analogue was dating the Ryan analogue\n\nFallen Princess: Marissa. Luke is the male version.\n\nFan Service:\n\nSummer in the Wonder Woman costume; Summer in the Little Miss Vixen costume; scenes of bikini clad women aplenty; one episode has Ryan continuously fantasizing about Taylor in what appears to be a bad 80s video involving her in skimpy clothing and at one point sliding her ass across a wet window. Another episode had a purposefully gratuitous close-up of the incredibly attractive cokewhore Jess' bikini-clad ass as she walked up the stairs. For the women, many scenes of men with their shirts off, including a rather porn-like shot of The Yard Guy watering the lawn.\n\nMarissa in the naughty schoolgirl outfit.\n\nFish Out of Water: Ryan (at least, in early seasons).\n\nFive-Man Band: They're all outcasts.\n\nRyan - The Hero.\n\nSeth - The Smart Guy.\n\nLuke - The Big Guy.\n\nMarissa - The Chick.\n\nSummer - Possess all above qualities.\n\nFive Stages of Grief: Summer goes through these after Marissa's death. She goes through Anger twice. The therapist is amazed she got through it all in a week. She then drops some of her Granola Girl act, though she keeps part of the activism.\n\nForeshadowing In \"The Snow C\", Alex kisses both a guy and a girl. This comes back in \"The Ex-Factor\" when it's revealed that she is bisexual.\n\nThe Generic Guy: Zach Stephens.\n\nGenki Girl: Taylor Townsend.\n\nGenre Savvy: Seth. Almost to the point of breaking the fourth wall sometimes. At the beginning of one episode he notes that everything has been going so well lately that something is bound to go wrong."
