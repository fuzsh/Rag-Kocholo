        "text": "Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the new prime minister of France, is a 53-year-old moderate right-wing senator from the free-market Liberal Democracy party (DL).\n\nA public relations expert, Mr Raffarin is seen as a figure who can appeal to a broad section of the right, while embodying a consensual approach that may also keep some left-wing voters on side.\n\nAlthough a minister for small businesses in the 1995-1997 government of Alain Juppe, Mr Raffarin has nonetheless made much of his credentials as a grass-roots politician.\n\nHis relatively low-profile has been seen as an advantage at a time when voters are applying pressure to bring political decision-making closer to the people.\n\nMr Raffarin stressed the need for French politicians to deliver after the shock success of far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen in the presidential elections, and following his coalition's landslide in legislative elections he pledged to live up to voters' demands.\n\n\"We will assume our duty of action,\" he told a sea of supporters.\n\n\"We have the obligation not to disappoint. We will act with firmness and with openness.\"\n\nHandle with care\n\nThe UMP coalition has put the issue of crime at the top of the election agenda, and Mr Raffarin will have to make sure the government delivers on its sweeping promises.\n\nJean-Pierre Raffarin\n\nPreviously marketing director for several companies\n\n1976 - enters politics\n\n1988 - becomes assistant mayor of Chasseneuil-du-Poitou in western France\n\n1989 - elected to European Parliament\n\n1995 - becomes general secretary of conservative UDF party\n\n1997 - becomes vice-president of Liberal Democracy party after UDF split\n\nHis government have also promised a series of tax cuts, and the prospect of a rebate before the end of this summer. There are some fears that the figures being flashed around are unrealistic, given France's traditional commitment to proper funding of its public services.\n\nIt is also thought that Mr Raffarin's government will take on the issue of pension reform, an issue which could spark protests on the streets of Paris if not handled with care.\n\nThe last reforming government fell in 1997 soon after French people took to the streets to protest against reforms to the French welfare system, and in particular against suggestions that pension provision should be overhauled.\n\nMr Raffarin, analysts say, will have to proceed with caution in his new role."
