        "text": "CHINA-LEADERSHIP: CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING TO VISIT VIETNAM ON DECEMBER 12-13, 2023\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Vietnam on December 12--13, 2023. This will be Xi Jinping's third visit to Vietnam. (Comment: Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier visited Vietnam in 2015 and 2017. 2023 marks the 15th anniversary of the establishment of the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between China and Vietnam. Vietnam is Chinaâs biggest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. China registered US$2.92 billion in direct investment in Vietnam over the first nine months of the year, 94.9 per cent higher than in the first three quarters of last year, according to Vietnamâs Ministry of Planning and Investment.)\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-LEADERSHIP: CHINA'S THREE NEW ECONOMIC COMMISSIONS AND LEADERSHIP AFFILIATIONS\n\nChina has three new economic/finance committees under the Partyâs aegis. Two are old and one is new, but all have the word âcentralâ in their titles. The European Think-Tank Marco Polo analysed the entities as follows: First, the Central Finance and Economic Commission (CFEC). Helmed by General Secretary Xi Jinping, itâs the oldest commission thatâs been around since the 1980s. When it convenes, it sets the big picture and ideological direction on the economy. What happens here gets enshrined in Party documents, like Xiâs 2015 supply-side reforms. Second, the newly established Central Finance Commission (CFC). Sitting just below the CFEC, the CFC ostensibly controls the banking regulators and makes decisions on capital allocation. While Premier Li Qiang leads the CFC, Marco Polo is uncertain whether that actually means heâs more empowered. Third, the Central Finance Work Commission (CFWC). It got a second lease on life after it was put on ice in 2003. Its original mission was to break up interest groups and it will likely serve similar disciplinary functions in this incarnation. Vice Premier He Lifeng is the âenforcer-in-chiefâ leading the CFWC. Marco Polo said: \"He Lifengâs place on all three commissions (director x 2, chair x 1) and his long-time relationship with Xi Jinping all but confirm his rise as a top confidante on economic affairs. We know that when it comes to personnel, Xi puts a premium on personal trust. So just how close are Xi and He Lifeng? Close enough that He was invited to Xi and Peng Liyuanâs wedding in 1987. They became comrade-in-arms during the 80s when both served in Xiamen. Xi deferred to He on economic matters even then, and when he started climbing the political ladder, Xi never left He behind. During their Xiamen tenure, He introduced Xi to his graduate mentor Deng Ziji, a scholar known for advocating state-led economics. Deng Ziji shaped China's 1994 tax reform and influenced Xi, He, and former Finance Minister Liu Kun. Xi and He have publicly credited Dengâs influence. As a close Xi ally, He will have Xiâs ear in coming years. His influence can already be seen in the seven State Council appointments he has shepherded through, including NDRC head Zheng Shanjie. This likely sets up Zheng as Heâs successor to the Vice Premiership in 2027. While He may have Xiâs ear, who has Heâs ear is just as important. But that might be harder to come by these days as âfincratsâ (finance technocrats) in the bureaucracy have been depleted. Nearly 80% of officials with finance backgrounds left the Central Committee (CC) in 2022. To compensate for the dearth of fincrats on the CC, Beijing has brought in personnel like Wang Jiang as deputy director of CFC and CFWC. His experience includes cleaning up the 2023 Everbright debt crisis, which will come in handy in dealing with property/local debt problems. So, it looks like itâs going to be âHe said, Xi saidâ on economic affairs for the foreseeable future. He has also clearly taken on the US-China economic portfolio, so we will be seeing a lot more of him. It has taken about a year for the new economic team to be put in place. Now itâs done; can they effectively manage the risks to Chinaâs financial system and reboot growth?\" (Comment: CCAS analysis is that the following are closely affiliated to He Lifeng and owe their rise to him: (i) Lan Fo'an - Finance Minister; Li Yunze - NFRA Director; Luo Wen - SAMR Director; Pei Jinjia - Veteran Affairs Minister; Tang Dengjie - Civil Affairs Minister; Wang Xiaohong - Public Security Minister; and Zhang Shanjie - NDRC Director.)\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-SENIOR APPOINTMENT: LI HONGXIN APPOINTED NEW DIRECTOR AND GENERAL MANAGER OF CHINA AERO ENGINE GROUP CO.

Agnes Chow, who is on police bail while under investigation on suspicion of national-security crimes, said she was taken to Shenzhen to the Tencent headquarters to enable her \"to understand the great development of the motherland.\" She said \"I have never denied China's economic development. But how can such a powerful country send people who fight for democracy to prison, restrict their freedom of movement, & even require them to go to mainland China and visit patriotic exhibitions in exchange for their passports?\" The Hong Kong government condemned Agnes Chow going into exile in Canada and stressed it will âspare no effort in bringing her to justice in accordance with the law.â\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-ANTI-CORRUPTION: CDIC ANNOUNCED THAT TWO OFFICIALS OF DEPUTY MINISTER-LEVEL WERE DISMISSED AND EXPELLED FROM THE CCP THE SAME DAY\n\nThe Central Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC) and the State Supervision Commission posted on its website on December 7, that Li Jinzhu, former member and Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Peopleâs Congress, was expelled from the party for serious violations of discipline and law; and Qu Min, former member of the party group and Vice Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference, was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of discipline and law.

The article said since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has grasped the general trend of world development, focused on the future, destiny and common well-being of mankind in the information age, and clearly proposed the important concept of building a community with a shared future in cyberspace. In November 2014, the first World Internet Conference was held in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province. This year marks its tenth year. In his video speech to the opening ceremony of the Wuzhen Summit of the 2023 World Internet Conference, General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward the \"three major initiatives\" and emphasized that \"we must deepen exchanges and pragmatic cooperation to jointly promote the construction of a community with a shared future in cyberspace to a new stage\" and provide a better future for the world.

Stating that \"The prosperity of a country or a nation is always supported by cultural prosperity\", he said \"since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas, new perspectives and new judgments around cultural construction in the new era\" and hat Xi Jinping's \"important exposition on philosophy and social sciences is an important content and integral part of Xi Jinping's cultural thoughts.

The MoSS clarified that the anti-espionage law targets a very small number of espionage activities that pose a threat to national security, without focusing on regular business activities. It said the law will have no impact on the âlegitimateâ investments and operations of foreign enterprises in China, adding âDistorting the lawful investigation of espionage criminal activities as âcrackdowns on foreign businessesâ is a typical case of concept manipulation and flawed logic.â âAnd it is clearly an intentional effort to mislead and create confusion to conflate state secrets with trade secrets and forcibly link business activities with espionage.â\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-PUBLIC SECURITY: PLANS OF CHINA'S PUBLIC SECURITY MINISTRY TO ABOLISH HUKOU IN CITIES WITH OVER 3 MILLION PEOPLE RUN INTO DIFFICULTIES\n\nReuters (December 7) reported that China's Ministry of Public Security in August called on cities with up to 3 million people to abolish hukou, and those with 3-5 million to significantly relax issuance, but the plan has run into hurdles.\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-ECONOMY: TWO TOP EXECUTIVES OF CHINA'S ZHONGZHI ENTERPRISE GROUP MISSING AFTER IT DECLARED ITSELF \"SERIOUSLY INSOLVENT\"\n\nForeign Policy (December 5) disclosed that late last month, the Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, a big Chinese wealth management firm, wrote a letter to investors that it had a financial shortfall of up to 260 billion yuan ($36.5 billion) and was âseverely insolvent.â The company disclosed that it held assets of around 200 billion yuan (about $27.98 billion) and an estimated 460 billion yuan ($64.37 billion) in liabilities. Caixin (December 4) said on November 25, the authorities opened a criminal investigation into the money management business of Zhongzhi Enterprise Group Co. Ltd. and now, two of its top executives are missing. Zhongzhi is a key part of Chinaâs so-called shadow banking system, or lending that takes place outside of conventional banks. This type of credit proliferates in China, meaning that the government needs to manage the companyâs collapse or restructuring even as it determines criminal responsibility for its insolvency. Itâs unlikely to be the only shadow banking firm that fails amid the countryâs multifaceted economic crisis. (Comment: Shadow banking is a US$ 3 trillion industry in China.)\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-ECONOMY: PEOPLE'S DAILY PUBLISHES ARTICLE BY PBOC GOVERNOR STRESSING MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF CREDIT\n\nOn December 4, the People's Daily published an article by Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) stressing the points he has been making since the Central Financial Work Conference (CFWC) in late October. He stressed: (i) Credit needs to be allocated more efficiently; (ii) Private-sector property developers need more support; and (iii) The âthree major projectsâ â creating more affordable housing, upgrading urban villages, and building dual-use (leisure and emergency relief) facilities â are keys to overhauling the property sector. Pan Gongsheng also said that âInterest rate levels that are too high or too low are not conducive to stable and sustained economic growthâ, thereby indicating the PBoC wonât slash interest rates. He also had some harsh words for the state of the financial sector, saying: (a) âFinancial chaos and corruption persistâ; (b) âFinancial supervision capabilities are weakâ; and (c) âThere are still many hiddenâ¦financial risks.â (Comment: Pan Gongsheng's 'harsh' remarks at (a) echo those made recently by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The remarks at (b) reflect similar recent remarks by Chen Wenqing, Secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission to security personnel.)\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-EDUCATION: CHINA'S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ORDERED REDUCTION IN CLASS AND HOMEWORK OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN BEIJING AFTER THEIR PROTEST\n\nSome junior high school students of Beijingâs largest middle school, NPC Central Chaoyang Branch, due to excessive academic pressure and other issues, issued a long microblogging public complaint against the principal.

I'm Chinese, I've worked in India for a while, I've been to some of the cities and villages in India, Personally, I think the gap between India and China will only get bigger, not smaller, in the next 10 to 20 years. First, India missed a golden opportunity to industrialise. From the end of the cold war in 1989 to the global financial crisis in 2008, more than 20 years were the golden age of global economic globalization. Over the past two decades, developed countries in the west have shifted manufacturing to developing countries, China jumped at the chance and India didn't! After the subprime crisis in 2008, western countries had already felt the danger brought by the hollowing out of manufacturing industry, and had strictly controlled the outflow of manufacturing industry. That's when India started to focus on manufacturing, but the good times won't come again. In recent years, India's manufacturing industry has developed, and foreign investment has also entered India. However, foreign investment in India is quite different from that in China. Foreign investment in India is aimed at capturing the domestic demand of India, Foreign investment in China, the purpose is not only to occupy the Chinese market, but to meet the needs of the world! Foreign investment in India, more to meet the Indian government's market access requirements, It is easy to judge that Indian made products are not globally competitive and it is hard to see any Indian made products outside India. Second, India may miss out on a fourth industrial revolution Many people call breakthroughs in high-speed communications, new energy, new materials, life sciences, artificial intelligence and other fields the fourth industrial revolution. But Indians are still keen on IT and have invested little in the fourth industrial revolution. I am not saying India is not investing, but very little, less than one tenth of China. In the future, the level of science and technology will determine the strength of a country, or even the destiny of a country. Third, India's environmental crisis As a Chinese, I have witnessed the destruction of China's environment by industrialization. It is easy to destroy the environment, but difficult to repair it. Today, the annual investment in environmental protection in China far exceeds the sum of education and military expenditure. But it will take generations to repair the environment, and some will never be. Unfortunately, I saw similar environmental damage in India, which has a higher population density and a lower environmental carrying capacity than China. India must solve its environmental problems, which may cause social instability and unrest. Fourth, India's education crisis In particular, inequality in education, Personally, 20% of people in India get a good education, but the quality and environment of education for the other 80% is really bad. Inequality in education leads to inequality in life development, India should pay special to education and invest heavily in it.\" My Take: The self-proclaimed Vishwaguru is not even a good chela. The Japanese and Chinese copied the Western industrial model, with all its attendant problems, but soon outperformed the Western corporates because they took trouble to understand the West as well as their own strengths. India can't even boast of a competent copy-cat elite. We lack an organic elite class because our heads and minds are deeply colonized. India's colonial elite neither understands the West nor are they rooted in their own culture.

Xinhua quoted Xi Jinping saying, \"China and the EU should be partners for mutually beneficial cooperation\" and called for stepping up dialogue to strengthen trust. Xi Jinping also told the EU leaders to steer clear of \"various kinds of interference\" -- likely a reference to Europe's embrace of the U.S.- led de-risking agenda. Beyond trade, the EU leaders were expected to caution China against circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, while urging Beijing to play a more active role in seeking peace in the Middle East. EU officials and analysts said apart from establishing working groups to ease the trade frictions, they did not expect substantial outcomes from the summit. (ii) The state-owned CCTV (December 7) said 'Xi Jinping emphasized that Chinese-style modernization and European integration are strategic choices made by China and Europe each with an eye on the future. China and Europe should respect and support each other, strengthen the docking of development strategies, and achieve common development. The Belt and Road Initiative is an open platform that has brought tangible benefits to more than 150 countries and people in the world. Gifts of roses, hand a fragrance. China is willing to continue to promote high-quality joint construction of the \"Belt and Road\", including docking with the EU's \"Global Gateway\" plan, and work together to help developing countries accelerate their development. The two sides should strengthen communication and coordination within multilateral frameworks'. It said 'Michel and von der Leyen said that the EU and China are two major forces in the world and are each other's important economic and trade partners, with increasingly broad areas of cooperation. EU-China cooperation is mutually beneficial and equal. Managing and developing EU-China relations well is directly related to the interests of the people on both sides, and is also related to the prosperity and security of the world. The EU attaches great importance to its relations with China and does not want to decouple from China. It looks forward to developing a long-term, stable, predictable and sustainable relationship with China. It hopes that this EU-China leaders' meeting will inject new impetus into the future development of EU-China relations'. It added 'The EU adheres to the one-China policy. The EU is willing to strengthen communication and enhance understanding with China on issues of disagreement in an attitude of mutual respect, openness and candour. Europe and China share common responsibilities and common interests for world peace and stability. The EU is willing to communicate and collaborate closely with China to safeguard multilateralism, uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and promote the resolution of hot-spot issues in Ukraine, the Middle East and other regions'.

Instead, it has committed to promoting peace talks between the junta and the ethnic armed groups and providing humanitarian assistance to Myanmar refugees\". It added \"On November 25, the Chinese Peopleâs Liberation Army announced that it would commence actual combat training on the border with Myanmar. The training areas include the cities of Mangshi and Ruili, and Gengma County, and other locations in southern Yunnan, focusing on testing the combat capabilities of the troops in the war zone, such as rapid mobility, border sealing and control, and fire strikes. The exercises aim to prepare for emergencies and safeguard national sovereignty, border stability, and the safety of peopleâs lives and propertyâ. It clarified that \"the purpose of the recent military drill, which concluded on November 28, was to deter both the junta and ethnic armed groups from escalating tensions\" and that \"it serves as a practical exercise aimed at securing the border in the event of escalated conflict, particularly cross-border air strikes or artillery attacks that could pose a threat to Chinaâs national security\". The article emphasised that \"the Chinese government has collaborated with the junta instead of the ethnic armed groups to jointly combat telecom scams. Therefore, the assertion that China is assisting ethnic armed groups in cracking down on telecom fraud is incorrect, although China does not oppose their efforts in this regard\" It stated in conclusion \"China deems it unworthy to interfere in the civil war in Myanmar, as doing so could result in the loss of trade and investment and undermine cordial relations with Myanmar\".\n\nDec 2023\n\nCHINA-CAMBODIA: CHINA'S CMC VICE CHAIRMAN VISITED CAMBODIA AND LAOS\n\nCoinciding with the visit of several PLA warships to Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, the Vice Chairman of Chinaâs Central Military Commission General He Weidong arrived in Cambodia and on December 4, met Cambodiaâs leaders including Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father Hun Sen, President of the ruling Cambodian Peopleâs Party.

The implication is that the rest will. (Comment: It is possibly one of the few times a very senior official has publicly put both property investment and infrastructure investment in the same \"unsustainable\" category. Observers say it suggests there is a growing sense that China needs to move away from both as a way of getting debt under control and of making growth more sustainable, which of course would not be the case if infrastructure spending actually benefitted the underlying economy.

In fact, Philippine military is a part of elite contingents developed and supported by the U.S. The Philippines also underestimated Chinaâs resolve and capabilities to take necessary countermeasures. 2. The U.S. plays a significant role in the provocations, aiming to leverage its allies and partners to ease pressure and share the costs of maintaining hegemony. Non-regional involvement becomes an important lever for the U.S. to contain China, activating and enhancing its alliance system. 3. In the future, China and the Philippines face two hurdles in stabilizing relations ââ the South China Sea issue and the U.S. influence. The U.S. seeks to widen disputes and create a rift between the two nations as part of its South China Sea policy. 4.U.S.-led militarization of the South China Sea has become the biggest negative factor weighing on peace and stability in the region. In the future, there may be so-called âjoint patrolsâ in the South China Sea, all clearly targeted at China. 5. Despite the strong interference from non-regional countries, the overall situation in the South China Sea remains stable and controllable. The likelihood of a major conflict between China and the U.S. or other non-regional countries in the South China Sea is low, as the two countries have put in place mature crisis management mechanisms. 6. In response to non-regional countriesâ increasing interference in the South China Sea, China should: First, continue to enhance capacity building. China is not powerful enough, otherwise other countries would be deterred from taking provocations. Second, facilitate Code of Conduct (COC) consultations and yield more substantial outcomes.
