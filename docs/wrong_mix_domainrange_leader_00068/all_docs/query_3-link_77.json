        "text": "The \"Raffarin II\" government will count 38 members (12 more than the interim government which took over from the socialist cabinet of Mr. Jospin after the Presidential elections). Most ministers of the interim cabinet are reconfirmed, except for the Minister for European affairs, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, who is under investigation for his alleged involvement in a party funding scandal.\n\nOne of the most remarkable appointments is the one of the former European Parliament President, Nicole Fontaine, as Minister for Industry. The post of European affairs minister goes to Mrs. Noelle Lenoir. Mrs. Lenoir is a lawyer with specialisation in bioethics and former member of the French constitutional Council (for more on her profile, see\n\nYahoo/AFP France)\n\nSome other important cabinet members are:\n\nInterior: Nicolas Sarkozy\n\nForeign affairs: Dominique Galouzeau de Villepin\n\nDefence: Michele Alliot-Marie\n\nEconomy and Finance: Francis Mer\n\nSocial affairs: François Fillon\n\nEcology and Sustainable Development: Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin\n\nAgriculture: Hervé Gaymard\n\nMr. Raffarin, who is a former member of the European Parliament (from 1989-95), wants to reduce taxes, combat crime and introduce reforms of France's health and pension systems. One of the priorities of the new government will be to improve the competitiveness of French companies, and the attractiveness of France for investors. According to some political experts, the Raffarin II government could become a more difficult partner for the European Union (esp. concerning France's budget austerity and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy)."
