        "text": "In his Nobel speech on 7th December 2008 Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio declared that literature had become a weapon in the service of the expression of cultural identity. He referred more specifically to the Innu writer Rita Mestokosho and to her commitment to the protection of a certain way of life. Rita Mestokosho is born in 1966 in Ekuanitshit Innu territory where she is still living today. Her first book of poetry Eshi Uapataman Nukum ( How I perceive life , Grandmother) was published in 1995. Republished in Sweden in 2010 in a bilingual edition. Her latest book Née de la pluie et de la terre was published in 2014 by Editions Bruno Doucey. As a member of the Innu council, Rita Mestokosho acts as a communicator for her community and is very much involved in cultural and educational projects. \"I am Innu, and Innu means human being. We are almost 15.000 Innus, split into 11 communities, 2 in Labrador with English as their second language, 9 in Quebec with French as their second language. We live between 2 worlds, the modern and the traditional. Finding a balance between them is not easy because our traditional land is always threatened by the bigger forest-industries, the dams for hydro-energy and the mines. Our life and survival are linked to the survival of the rivers, the forest and the lakes. Writing in a language, in the French language is also a necessity. It enables us to reach a wider audience for expressing our fears in a poetical way.\" The communities of Pessamit, Essipit, la Romaine, Mashteuiatsh, Matimekosh, Mingan, Natahsquan, Pakuashipi, Uashat Maliotenam which are the 9 communities in Quebec compose what Rita M. names the Innu \" nation \". Rita M. represents indeed a small cultural minority but literature enables her to speak with a universal voice as her poems are published in a multilingual edition. We would like to present here how the fight for the survival of the Innu community reflects the rise of a political native awareness in Québec. We will refer to the interviews we had with Rita Mestokosho during her 2 visits to Stockholm in 2009 and 2014 and to the articles we wrote for the Quebec magazine Littoral/ Côte ouest ( GRÉNOC groupe de recherche sur la l’écriture nord-côtière)\n\nSource criticism is a strong challenge in higher education as many students do not pay sufficient attention to the diversity of sources, they want quick facts that they can reuse. By not being able to distinguish the quality of texts on the net, they clip and paste sentences that they collect in different documents. It is not possible to substitute academic learning with patch-writing strategies (Pecorari, 2015). Many students perceive themselves as illegitimate writers as they have to learn the content of the field as well as a more general academic practice on how to write an essay or formulate adequate answers to academic assignments (Eklund, Sköldvall, 2015).\n\nThe case of Wikipedia is interesting as many students use this immediate information that they find on Internet (Tkacz, 2015). Wikipedia is a collaborative platform (O ́Sullivan, 2009) with many facts that students find it difficult to quote. Consequently, it is important to collect information on their attitudes to be able to see if there are any common strategies that students have. In order to define these strategies, it can be appropriate to ask students to work with Wikipedia articles and evaluate the information that they find. An experiment has been made in 2018 in a class of French as a foreign language at Stockholm University where students were asked to work with some articles of Wikipedia. Students had to learn basic facts by using the information contained in those pages. The inclusion of questions on sources was interesting to analyse students ́ attitudes. Some of them reacted vis-à-vis the content of the articles whereas other students commented the format of Wikipedia as a generic source for facts. In this perspective, the analysis of sources is the first step to acquire a mode of critical thinking in the Academy (Davies, 2013).\n\nThe article aims at studying these reactions to see how the students in a foreign language might use and reflect about a source that they immediately meet when they look for empirical facts, figures or references on the Net. The results of this empirical investigation conducted during Spring 2018 will be presented. The second purpose would be to see whether students could possibly use collaborative strategies as learning tools (Kalin, 2012) in order to avoid plagiarism (Chankova, 2017). Should the Academy pay more attention to Wikipedia sources or consider them as a form of poor and quick knowledge? Are there any recommendations that can be delivered so that a better understanding of sources can help to avoid plagiarism? Last but not least, can this study based on quick facts be applied to formal knowledge?\n\nMany students at the university do not really know how to find relevant information and cite important sources in their field. On the one hand, the challenge is even more difficult in language courses as the students focus on skills without paying attention to source information. In this perspective, they get used to plagiarism attitudes consisting in patchwriting strategies (Pecorari, 2015). On the other hand, teachers do not have time to help students to find the required information, they take this competency for granted in higher education. This contrast can reinforce misunderstandings between students and teachers and lead to a form of passive plagiarism, where students seek for information and gather different meanings taken in different sources. This mimetic attitude has to be questioned at the very beginning of the academic life (Krathwohl, 2002). By preparing students to a better reflection on their sources and by inviting teachers to pay attention to source criticism, a generic form of “constructive alignment” is possible (Hunt, Chalmers, 2012). The presentation proposes an exercise to test the critical capacity of students when it comes to the use of Wikipedia sources. The experiment was made during three semesters in a class of French (“Culture and society in France”) where the students had to study different materials including some Wikipedia articles recommended by the teacher (Premat, 2019). When they wrote the exam, they had to answer a metalinguistic question on the use of Wikipedia articles. The presentation analyzes the answers of the students by proposing a typology of discourses and attitudes on Wikipedia sources.\n\nThere is a paradox between students’ practices (almost all of them recognize that they use Wikipedia) and between the discourse that they have (most of them would not dare citing a Wikipedia article in an academic essay). The presentation proposes pedagogical activities where students would be encouraged to deepen source criticism (Peters, Cadieux, 2019; Premat, 2020).\n\n-Hunt, L., Chalmers, D. (eds.) (2012).

Divided into three parts (The initiate, the invaders and the genocide), Assiniwi incorporates oral stories in the written genre of historical novels. The aim of the novel is both ethnological and cultural as the author presents the history of a nation that was destroyed by colonizers with the help of rival clans. By introducing a chronology on the history of this nation, Assiniwi adds a literary style to enlighten the cultural specificity of the Beothuk. Some researchers in native studies focused on the role of ethnopoetics (Feld, 1982) in order to catch the language and the spirit of the First Nations, whereas others prefer to introduce a form of comparative poetology (Miner, 1990; Beaujour, 2017: 19). The comparative poetology avoids the ethnocentric illusion and opens the possibility of translating and understanding the cultural and artistic productions of the First Nations. Hence, the historical novel is an interesting genre as it contributes to collect fragments of oral traditions into a continuous narrative. Unlike comparative poetology, the focus is on how the author re-members some important actions from unknown ancestors to describe a forgotten genealogy. By using the concept of “remembering” (Premat, Sule, 2016), the present presentation shows how the story of the Beothuks echoes an ancient tradition of Icelandic and Nordic sagas. Assiniwi rediscovers some important features of the first novels to give a voice to this nation.\n\nIt seems that Assiniwi describes an ancient form of métissage that was possible in the genealogy of the Beothuks. In the previous studies on The Beothuk Saga, the hybridity of the narrative was analyzed as well as the founding myths (Jeannotte, 2010; Gatti, 2010). The author wanted to tell the story of the Beothuk from the native point of view. Gerald Vizenor, a native American Indian, described the characteristics of an unilateral colonial narrative that is taken as a historical truth in Western societies. “The Heirs of Christopher Columbus created one more New World in their stories and overturned the tribal prophecies that their avian time would end with the arrival of the white man. The heirs warm the stones at the tavern with their stories in the blood” (Vizenor, 1991: 5). Assiniwi expresses the desire of creating a counter-narrative of the indigenous communities (Bhabha, 1994: 66) by revealing the details of their ways of living and thinking. Moreover, by being inspired by the origins of the novel, Assiniwi reverses the aesthetic canons of the literary colonial tradition. The remembering process is all the deeper as it reintegrates parts of the colonial traditions. Assiniwi is one of the few native writers that adopted the historical novel to tell the story and the tragedy of the Beothuk. The origin of the novel is reused to transmit stories from the oral tradition as if the Beothuk’s story was not that different from other early European nations (Robert, 1988). Some of the characters embody this sense of living memory, just like the old man that inaugurates the second part of the novel. “He was the clan’s Living Memory, charged with keeping the past alive; he had been instructed to do this by his ancestor Anin, the first Beothuk to travel around the whole land now occupied by the Beothuk Nation” (Assiniwi, 2000: 137).\n\nTo address this hypothesis, the presentation will focus on the ethnological tradition concerning the description of Beothuk. There were a few works made on the description of this Nation that can be compared with the details that Assiniwi give (Marshall, 1998: 240). The exogenous tradition has to be presented in order to contextualize the originality of Assiniwi’s work. Second, the genealogy of the ancestors will be studied in terms of lineages and métissage. They are connected to the spiritual drives of the environment which is quite hostile. The characters identify themselves with the natural elements, but the magical realism is never lyric in the novel. As the psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung explains it: “all the contents of our unconscious are constantly being projected into our surroundings, and it is only by recognizing certain properties of the objects as projections or imagos that we are able to distinguish them from the real properties of the objects” (Jung 1986, 50). The relation between the spiritual drives and the genealogy of the clan structures the first part of the novel. Third, the style of the saga will be analyzed (rhythm / characters / narrative focus / symbols / languages). There is no idealization of the ancestors but the rhythm is decisive in the way the chronology meets the story of the ancestors. The chronology is linear whereas the story of the ancestors follows the natural cycle. “For the first time since he had set out on his journey of initiation, Anin was undecided. Should he cross the forest in the direction shown to him by Woasut, to rejoin his people, or should he continue and complete his circumnavigation of their land, as he had given his word he would do?” (Assiniwi, 2000: 27). The notion of rythmanalysis is here adapted to focus on the alternation between the cyclical time and the historical time of the colonizers (Lefebvre, Régulier, 1985). In a nutshell, Assiniwi used the historical novel to make the reader enter into a new imaginary world and to understand the beliefs, the dreams and the thinking of this former Nation.\n\nAssiniwi, B.
