        "text": "The National Chairman of the Popular Action Party, PAP, Lord Justice Ayah Paul Abine has described the Kumba faction of the defunct People’s Action party as miserable “3 hungry boys”. He also observed that actors involved in the SCNC liberation struggle were mainly interested in positions and have deliberately lose sight of their mission and vision.\n\nAsked if PAP is now in two factions, the outspoken Supreme Court Judge said “We have change the name of PAP from People’s Action Party to Popular Action Party. If you are talking about PAP in a different context I don’t know about it.” Quizzed on when and why it was change, the Lord Justice noted “We hold meetings in private, in public and behind closed doors. We are not under any duty to explain to people where we held the meeting to take this or that decision. Otherwise you would soon ask me when and why we held the meeting to annul the so-called document that Kumba is brandishing”.\n\nThe man of law added that “in accordance with our constitution, the important thing the law requires is that when there is such a change we notify the government having such jurisdiction and we did that in March 1st 2016”. Justice Ayah in a typical Fru Ndi-Biya style revealed that “I have a list of at least 22 political parties that have change their names since the advent of multi-party system and nobody has dare to ask or explain why the change of name . CNU became CPDM. We have no reason to change names. If there are any reason then there are entirely intern, not for public consumption. We decided that popular is better than people and within our context so it stays.”\n\nQuestioned on the alleged embezzlement of party funds by the so called “3 hungry boys” in Kumba, Ayah fired back saying, “I am not here to make a statement on account, when I would want to make a statement of account of PAP I will called a national meeting.” To him no political party in Cameroon today is as democratic as the Popular Action Party, PAP. He recounted how his business and savings collapsed because of PAP. “There is no member of PAP apart from those who contested the elections who have spent a million FCFA for the party,” Ayah wept.\n\nHe explained that the party doesn’t function like the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement which takes money from the state coffers without any legal process and rights. He smartly answered a teaser that being member of the Supreme Court doesn’t conflict with being a member of a political party”, against what the Kumba “3 hungry boys” had claimed. Reacting on the SCNC matter Hon Ayah observed that the movement has lost its sense of direction and was baseless in its fight for liberation.\n\nHe was defiant in his statement that there was no legal document on the Southern Cameroons and La Republique’s reunification. He noted that the wise men commission established sometime ago by President Paul Biya to fact find the documents binding Cameroon’s reunification had bear no fruits till date. To this it was eloquent testimony and proves of the undeniable fact that no re-unification ever took place between the two Cameroons.\n\nVictor Bama Cham (CIR)\n\nThe Secretary General of the CPDM Central Committee, Jean NKuete will travel to Buea, capital of the South West region tomorrow Thursday June 16th 2016. His visit falls in line with the recent appointments of regional and divisional delegations of the CPDM party throughout the national territory. The South West regional president, Senator Peter Mafany Musonge and his team would be installed tomorrow alongside six divisional presidents, members and their secretaries. Minister Dion Ngute, Vice Speaker of the National Assembly,Lifaka Emilia, Minister Victor Mengot, CDC Board Chairman,Benjamin Itoe, Tassong Paul and Ngolle Ngolle Elvis are all presidents of divisional delegations of the CPDM in the South West region.\n\nThe National Social Insurance hall constructed in the days of the disgraced former Prime Minister Inoni will host the event. The leadership of the Buea Council has put up welcome banners for the CPDM Secretary General. Mayor Ekema Patrick has mobilized grassroots militants to grace the installation ceremony. Cameroon Intelligence Report gathered that more than 8 million FCFA has been raised for the occasion.\n\nIn Fako, individual contributions were made yesterday with the boss of the GCE Board, Monono Humphrey dishing out the sum of FCFA 200,000 while CDC General Manager, Njie Franklin donated 250,000 FCFA at a time when the CDC senior service quarters in Tiko is crumbling in front of his watchful eyes. Some political commentators have opined that it will provide an opportunity for unity talks within the Fako CPDM family.\n\nCham Victor for CIR\n\nThe opposition is working towards a coalition to have incumbent President Ali Bongo disqualified from running for the presidency. Casimir Oyé Mba, the candidate of the National Union (UN) party in the August 27, 2016 presidential election in Gabon is determined to ensure that incumbent President Ali Bongo is disqualified from standing for the second term of office in the election. This is because he claims that Ali Bongo has acquired the Gabonese nationality which in accordance with Article 10 of the Constitution prohibits him from running for the presidency, RI reported.\n\nIn an interview over RFI, Sunday, June 12, 2016, Mr Oyé Mba called on all other candidates to form an alliance to ensure that Ali Bongo’s candidature is rejected. Before the interview, he had challenged Ali Bongo, to defend before the two Houses of Parliament (Senate and National Assembly) his multiple birth certificates. He claims that Ali Bongo is not constitutionally qualified to run for the presidency of Gabon. Speaking during a press conference, he said Ali Bongo cannot delegate the powers to any other person to answer questions concerning his birth certificate saga.\n\nIn response to the claim by Oyé Mba, President Ali Bongo’s lawyer, Claude Dumont declared that the debate over the President’s birth certificate was over, RFI reported. The lawyer said justice should be allowed to take its course, assuring that the case concerning the civil status of Ali Bongo will be declared baseless and consequently null and void. The lawyer said they were waiting for the opposition to bring proves of their claims.\n\nCameroon Tribune\n\nThe Democratic presidential race has officially come to an end with Hillary Clinton winning the primary contest in the US capital, gaining nearly 79 percent of the vote. Clinton, who already had enough delegates to be her party’s presumptive nominee, won the Tuesday primary in the District of Columbia. The former secretary of state also met with rival Bernie Sanders Tuesday night and talked about the Democratic Party platform to be drawn up at this summer’s convention.\n\n“We’re going to have a wide-ranging conversation, because we share a lot of the same goals,’’ Clinton said Tuesday night in an interview with Telemundo, an American Spanish-language broadcast television network. “We both want to raise the minimum wage, we want to fight inequality of income, we want to make college affordable and we certainly want everybody to get health care.”\n\n“I very much am looking forward to having his support in this campaign, because Donald Trump poses a serious threat to our nation,” she added. Sanders has not formally ended his campaign and has not endorsed Clinton either. He has promised to give every voter a chance to decide between the two candidates. Nonetheless, the Vermont senator has said he’s committed to working with Clinton to defeat Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. “Our goal must not be to allow politicians, Donald Trump or anyone else, to divide us,” he said outside his headquarters in Washington, DC.\n\nPresstv\n\nThe Senate Chamber at the Yaounde Conference Centre was yesterday June 9, 2016, the venue for Senators to check government activities as prescribed by law. Senate President, Marcel Niat Njifenji, in the presence of the Vice Prime Minister, Minister Delegate at the Presidency in charge of Relations with the Assemblies, Amadou Ali, called the House to order and announced that the plenary session was for questions to the Executive. Seven cabinet ministers were grilled on issues patterning to tourism, agriculture, bilingualism, water and electricity, environment amongst others.\n\nThe Minister of State in charge of Tourism and Leisure, Bello Bouba Maïgari, was the first to mount the rostrum to respond to a question from NUDP Senator, Pierre Flambeau Ngayap, on the impact of the Boko Haram war on tourism in the Far North Region. The Minister of State said the impact is tremendous, not only on the tourism sector, but also on agriculture, education and health. Bello Bouba stressed that the government is preoccupied most with the pressing issue of securing the population and defending the national territory, which so far have been done with great success by the Defence Forces.\n\nThis notwithstanding, moves are being made to promote internal tourism, given that diplomatic missions had advised their compatriots to stay away from the Far North Region. Similarly, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Henri Eyebe Ayissi, was also quizzed on measures taken to pre-empt food deficiency in the Far North Region. He outlined short and long term measures adopted stating the Head of State’s special food donation worth FCFA 12 billion which has been partly distributed. Agricultural machinery and the development of production zones are part of long-term measures to ensure food sufficiency in the region.\n\nOn the imbalance in the use of official languages in communicating important information, Communication Minister, Issa Tchiroma Bakary pointed out that the Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon provides for English and French as two official languages of equal status. He cited his press outings, which he said are always bilingual and the official newspaper, Cameroon Tribune, which publishes information in both languages.\n\nSenator Simon Anja’s worry on the non-posting of French language teachers to some schools especially in Akwaya sub-division, Manyu Division of the South West Region, was also addressed by the Minister of Basic Education, Youssouf Alim Adidja. Meanwhile, measures to ease access to water and electricity were explained by Minister Basile Atangana Kouna who also said errors in the billing systems should be reported to the service providers. The Minister of Finance, Alamine Ousmane Mey, his colleague of Environment and Protection of Nature, Helé Pierre also provided answers to worries of Senators.\n\nCameroon Tribune\n\nCameroon Intelligence Report has gathered from reliable sources at the Special Criminal Court that the verdict on case number 003 / RG- TCS / 2016 involving the former Secretary General of the Presidency of the Republic, Jean Atangana Mebara shall be made public on the 22nd of June 2016.\n\nMinister Mebara was charged for embezzlement of 5 million US dollars in a presidential jet scandal that rocked the Cameroonian nation. Depicting the Special Criminal Court established to prosecute alleged corrupt government officials and the several Alibabas responsible for pilfering from the public treasury as the President’s court is no misnomer.\n\nWe call it the President’s court because it is one instrument of power through which the President is reining in on perceived opponents from within his CPDM power conduit. An attribute of a genuine court is the fairness of the trial proceedings in cases which are brought before the court for trial. It is not the number of convictions entered against accused.\n\nA court is legitimate and recognized as such because of its exercise of judicial, executive, legislative and administrative independence. A court that is independent must be accessible to all citizens after all, is equality before the law, not a constitutionally protected value? The Special Criminal Court is lacking in these attributes of impartiality, judicial independence and accessibility. It is perceived more as the President’s Court than a Court of Justice.\n\nCIR"
