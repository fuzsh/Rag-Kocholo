        "text": "A spectre hangs over Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the affable centre-right prime minister of France: that of autumn 1995, when aggressive spending cuts by a previous conservative administration sparked a massive wave of social unrest that brought the country to its knees and the government, eventually, to an early end.\n\nMr Raffarin has insisted recently that the country is not \"in a state of crisis\". He has called on workers to \"respect the spirit of responsibility and of the Republic\", and reiterated that the government will always be open to dialogue.\n\nBut faced with France's fourth lorry drivers' strike in six years, a walkout by air traffic controllers and protest marches today by hundreds of thousands of public sector workers, the prime minister must be wondering whether he is not in for a re-run.\n\nStrikes and protests are, of course, a recurring fact of life in France. Farmers routinely dump tonnes of rotting vegetables on the roads and trash government offices. Train drivers regularly leave millions of commuters stranded while lorry drivers barricade motorways, blockade ports, and spark frenzied bouts of panic buying.\n\nEven schoolchildren and the police enjoy the odd walkout. Ever since the revolution of 1789, the French have believed in their right to protest and expect results, meaning that any halfway sensible French government is rightly terrified of the power of the street.\n\nSuccessive administrations cave in to union demands in the face of widespread support for strikers from almost every sector. Even when their lives are disrupted, polls show the French - presumably on the basis that they may be the next group to walk out - invariably support the strike: 76% backed the lorry drivers this time.\n\nWary of what they see as a government that won this summer's elections by default, with the electorate voting for President Jacques Chirac's centre-right UMP party mainly for its law-and-order platform and to keep out the far right, trade unionists have warned since June that Mr Raffarin faced a winter of discontent.\n\nA perceived disinclination to listen to workers' demands, together with a classic rightwing programme of privatisation and change in the public sector, have prompted trade unionists such as Bernard Thibault of the CGT federation to warn that Mr Raffarin's government \"was not elected for its socio-economic programme and would do well to remember it\".\n\nMr Raffarin, promising a policy of \"firmness and humanity\", has ordered his ministers to tackle each dispute individually. And his government remains broadly popular, in contrast to the 1995 administration whose severe austerity measures fuelled deep public resentment.\n\nFor the time being, the disputes look manageable with a judicious blend of carrot and stick. But the government's commitment to cutting taxes will eventually force it to take on the unions. The current protests are only a foretaste of what is to come.\n\nEuropean disruption\n\nBelgium Transport workers halted Brussels on November 5. Chemist, retail and bank staff also took action\n\nGermany Public sector workers' strike threat. Building, engineering and bank disputes\n\nSwitzerland Largest strike in 55 years this month when 15,000 builders demanded retirement at 60\n\nItaly Strikes over job cuts at Fiat. Sea and air traffic hit.\n\nPortugal Repeated strikes against government cuts and labour law. Half a million strikers paralysed schools, hospitals on November 14."
