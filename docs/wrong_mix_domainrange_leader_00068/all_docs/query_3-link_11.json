        "text": "Newly re-elected French President Jacques Chirac named Raffarin as France’s interim prime minister the day after his landslide election win last Sunday. But because of the vagaries of the French constitution, the pro-European former MEP may find his tenure at the Hôtel Matignon a rather short-lived affair.\n\nIf the Socialists win a majority of seats in the second round of France’s parliamentary elections on 16 June, hiking enthusiast Raffarin will be on his way out, having spent a little over a month as the head of a government that couldn’t pass any laws.\n\nThe latest opinion polls suggest this probably will not happen. A survey carried out by the Sofres group last week found that the Socialists would win most votes in the forthcoming elections but that the right would pick up more parliamentary seats, because of the way the borders between France’s different electoral constituencies have been drawn.\n\nBut then the pollsters all suggested that the recent presidential election would be a tedious head-to-head between Chirac and former Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, so it is by no means a foregone conclusion that Raffarin will keep his job.\n\nIf Raffarin does manage to stay on at the Matignon, observers say he would be good news for France’s relations with the EU.\n\nHe served as an MEP from 1989 to 1994 and according to people who know him from that time, he has a clear grasp of how the Union works.\n\n“I think he was an inspired choice for prime minister,” says the European Parliament’s Liberal group leader, Graham Watson. “I would read this as a clear commitment from Chirac that France is taking its role in Europe seriously.”\n\nOther Parliamentary insiders recall Raffarin was the exact opposite of Nicolas Sarkozy, the other former French MEP who was seen as Raffarin’s main rival for the prime minister’s job. Chirac made Sarkozy interior minister instead.\n\n“The difference between Raffarin and Sarkozy is enormous,” says one seasoned Parliament-watcher. “Sarkozy was very much a member of the ‘I’m the best thing since sliced bread’ school of politicians.”\n\nDespite leaving the European Parliament to become small business minister in the short-lived Alain Juppé government that followed Chirac’s first election to the French presidency in 1995, Raffarin has remained in contact with Brussels.\n\nAs well as holding his ministerial position until the Juppé govern-ment fell in 1997, Raffarin was also president of the Poitou-Charentes regional council in western France.\n\nThis post gave him an automatic seat on the Brussels-based EU Committee of the Regions (CoR), which he held until taking up his new post on Monday.\n\nLike Watson, CoR President Albert Bore, who is the socialist head of Birmingham council in the UK, also welcomed Raffarin’s arrival at the Hôtel Matignon.\n\nChirac’s decision was “good news for the EU’s towns and regions and for Europeans,” Bore said.\n\n“France has a prime minister who has repeatedly given proof of his commitment to the European Union’s values but also, by becoming a member of the CoR, his firm belief that the European Union must be more responsive to its citizens and their key concerns,” he added.\n\nRaffarin is a member of Democratie Liberal (DL), one of France’s smaller centre-right parties. DL is often described as ‘Thatcherite’ when it comes to economic questions but is, unlike the UK’s famed Iron Lady, openly pro-European.\n\nWithin France, currently one of Europe’s most centralised states, DL has for years campaigned in favour of greater autonomy for local and regional government.\n\nAnd this belief in the Maastricht Treaty’s famous principle of ‘subsidiarity’ is also central to Raffarin’s vision of how Europe should develop, say his supporters.\n\n“He is a firm believer that governmental power should be exercised at the most appropriate level possible,” says Watson. “I don’t know if he’d apply the term to himself but I’d certainly call him a genuine federalist.”\n\nAmong the EU’s regional policy experts both within the CoR and the European Parliament, Raffarin is perhaps best known for having created a forum known as the ‘Atlantic Arc’. This grouping brings together local and regional government experts from areas that border the Union’s Atlantic coast from the north of Scotland to the southern tip of Portugal.\n\nThe group tries to ensure that these regions work together to protect and improve the Union’s coastal zones from a variety of threats including poorly planned tourist developments, erosion and pollution.\n\nBut while Raffarin is respected within the rarefied worlds of EU committees and the Paris political elite, as far as the general public is concerned he is relatively unknown. Many French commentators say this is one of the main reasons Chirac picked him to be the new PM.\n\nMuch has been made in recent years of the fact that France’s top political jobs keep going to the same old faces – Chirac first became a minister in 1967, for example. So the decision to give the keys of the Matignon to a man seen as a hard-working local politician has been interpreted as a sign that the newly re-elected president is trying to inject some fresh blood into his country’s tired political establishment.\n\nPeople who have worked with Raffarin say the married father of one – a daughter named Fleur – can be a demanding boss but insist he is never unpleasant to his staff.\n\n“He’s a friendly man. He sometimes expects a great deal of his staff but it is always enjoyable to work with him,” says Christophe Laurioux, Raffarin’s chef de cabinet in the Poitou-Charentes regional council.\n\nLaurioux also insists that his former boss will rise to the challenge of his new job and dismisses criticisms that Raffarin’s relative lack of ministerial experience – his short spell under Juppé is the only government post he has held apart from his present job – could be a handicap.\n\n“I don’t think there is a school where you go to learn to be prime minister,” he says.\n\nNot everyone in France would agree with this statement.\n\nIn fact, the prestigious École Nationale de L’Administration (ENA), which has churned out the vast majority of France’s ruling elite since the Second World War, is precisely that school.\n\nCritics say the fact that France has been ruled by the so-called ‘Enarchs’ for the past 50 years is one of the main reasons that the Paris establishment is so often perceived as being out of touch with the rest of the country.\n\nIf such criticisms are true then they provide yet more evidence that Chirac made a shrewd choice when he picked Raffarin. The former council leader didn’t attend the ENA; he went to business school.\n\nRaffarin has also enjoyed a successful career outside politics, another indication, say his supporters, that he is a new kind of French prime minister.\n\nHe began his professional life as the marketing director for one of France’s best known coffee companies and later on headed a major public relations firm before deciding to enter politics full-time. His tenure in the PR world certainly seems to have rubbed of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe looks eminently at home in television studios, and comes across as relaxed and comfortable in front of the cameras.\n\nHis public image contrasts sharply with that of earnest, hard-working Jospin, who always looked ill-at- ease in the modern world of slick, spin-doctored sound-bite politics.\n\nAll that remains to be seen now is whether Raffarin will have the opportunity to put his much-vaunted qualities into practice over the next five years.\n\nIn six week’s time he could either be up to his eyeballs in government paperwork or up on the top of a favourite Alpine peak enjoying an unexpected walking holiday.\n\nGiven the way France’s elections have gone this year this writer, for one, refuses to predict which.\n\nAdvertisement"
