Over the years, I have developed several exhibitions and conferences in Shanghai and Beijing and strong & friendly relationships with my Chinese counterparts. ​\n\nChina is, of course, most promising in terms of business. It is one of the most promising economies for growth and development as well as innovation in the world.​\n\nNeedless to say, like everywhere business goes hand to hand with confidence, respect, and cultural understanding. ​\n\nToday, the PE community has an important role to play in showing the world that cross-border investments could strongly contribute to creating a more sustainable world for our future. The private equity community is keen to be part of the energy transition by investing in healthcare, green energies, education, biotech, green infrastructures, and any kind of innovative solutions. IPEM China is a great opportunity to elaborate partnerships between Europe, the Middle East and Asia. “\n\n“ After completing my PhD in AI in France, I transitioned into technology investments in China in 2017, a period marked by significant upheaval for private equity investments, especially for USD fund managers like KKR, Blackstone, Hillhouse Investment, TPG, Sequoia Capital, etc. However Europe has seen growing interest from a burgeoning Chinese investment community since COVID-19, ushering in a new era brimming with opportunities and arising from these pivotal changes and challenges.​\n\nChina boasts over 12,800 PE and VC fund managers, with a combined AUM exceeding 3.74 trillion USD, positioning China as a leader in the Asian investment community. The success of US investments in China over the past decades highlights the enormous potential within the country. Today, Chinese industry leaders, investors, and fund managers are eager to continuously collaborate globally, extending their interests to Europe and the Middle East. This has led to a surge in synergies among Asia, the Middle East, and Europe!​\n\nIPEM China is dedicated to building a robust bridge through bicultural and professional knowledge, skills, and networks. Our mission is to connect Europe with Asia, facilitate learning expeditions, ease market entry into China, and drive successful deals! “\n\n“ I chaired IPEM China 2023, and I am convinced that IPEM China 2024 will offer great opportunities to boost cross-border investments. We will learn how to penetrate and develop activities and investments in one of the most vibrant world’s economy.\n\nRemember last year, we saw 500+ delegates, of whom 90% were CEOs. With 60+ speakers (70% international), they brought invaluable insights and expertise, making for an exceptional event.\n\nI am happy to lead the delegation this year again to meet Chinese actors of Private Equity“"
