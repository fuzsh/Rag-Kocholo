        "text": "The UMP launched its campaign for a French 'Oui' on 6 March. The slogan to support the campaign is \"L'Europe mérite qu'on lui dise 'oui'\" [Europe deserves a 'yes' from us]. The UMP President Nicolas Sarkozy was quick to make a clear distinction between the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty (to which the UMP has been in favour) and the issue of possible Turkish accession to the EU (to which the UMP has been opposed, advocating an 'associated partner' status instead). \"It is very important to educate and explain why it is in our interest to vote yes,\" Sarkozy has said.\n\nThe secretary-general of the French Socialist Party, François Hollande, said the task was to demonstrate the progress inherent in the Constitutional Treaty and the strong reasons why the French should vote 'oui'. Following an internal vote, the Socialist Party decided to back the Constitution. The three strongest reasons in favour of the treaty are, according to Hollande, the strengthening of the European institutions and the creation of the post of EU foreign minister; the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Moreover, the new treaty recognises public services for the first time and it gives trade unions the status of 'European partners'.\n\nAlthough according to many, the short time frame favours the 'Yes' camp, representatives of the 'No' camp are adamant. \"Saying 'No' to the Giscard's Constitution is giving a chance to a social, democratic and peaceful Europe,\" Marie-George Buffet, national secretary of the French Communist Party, has said. Alain Krivine of the Revolutionary Communist League said that he would work towards a unitary campaign of all anti-liberal forces for a leftist 'No'."
