Created in 1989 by René MONORY, former President of the Senate and former Minister, and François DALLE, former President of L’Oréal, recognized as being of public utility, the Foundation is today chaired by Jean-Pierre RAFFARIN, former Prime Minister, Member honorary of the Parliament.

Its purpose is to promote awareness and forward thinking on the fundamental transformations of the contemporary world, in order to help French decision-makers, government as well as companies or opinion leaders, to react in full knowledge of the facts.

It strives to shed international light on strategic topics. It facilitates contacts between young French professionals and their counterparts from emerging countries. It supports the efforts of companies, particularly those of medium or intermediate size, in their efforts to penetrate new large markets.

To this end, it brings together specialists and business leaders, intellectuals and political and administrative decision-makers of different sensitivities, in appropriate working frameworks for operational proposals.

Its action focuses on three priority areas:

understand and appreciate the reality of emergencies, and especially that of China but also Africa

stimulate competitiveness by enlightening and supporting businesses, especially SMEs and mid-caps

participate in the design of a new global, national and local governance.

The Foundation makes its work public through publications and a website: www.prospective-innovation.org

It supports the Circle of Entrepreneurs of the Future, led by Michel Godet, in conjunction with the CNE (National Center for Entrepreneurship)
