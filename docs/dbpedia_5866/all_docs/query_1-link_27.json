        "text": "“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows”: Eye Witnesses\n\nAsk any Harry Potter fan, and they will tell you that Harry looks exactly like his father, except he has his mother's green eyes. Not only is it mentioned in all of the books, but the films are full of that mention as well.\n\nSo what on god's green earth made the casting director cast young Lily (that's Harry's mom for you) as a brown-eyed girl? No one knows for sure, but the fans will forever remain furious.\n\n“Dallas Buyers Club”: The Future of Cars\n\nDuring one scene of “Dallas Buyers Club,” we sit inside the office of Matthew McConaughey's character, Ron Woodroof, who is diagnosed with AIDS and goes on a quest to get medication for AIDS/HIV, during a time when research for the disease was underfunded. The movie came out in 2013, and for the most part, it looks just right in its mid-eighties setting, but there are still a few mistakes.\n\nOne of them, behind Woodroof's chair in his office, is a poster of a Lamborghini Aventador, a sweet sports car that, unfortunately, didn't come out until 2011.\n\n“Terminator 2: Judgment Day”: A Magical Healing Jacket\n\nBig Arnold has a habit of being in movies that have items that heal themselves. In this instance, it's the blockbuster “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.” During a scene when the T-1000 is facing down Arnold and John Connor, the enemy terminator unloads a cartridge into the T-800's back, peppering his leather jacket with bullet holes but not doing too much damage to Arnold's robotic body.\n\nA few moments later, however, as the two terminators are in close-quarters, the jacket Arnold has is once again whole and unmarred. Probably not comfortable wearing a jacket with holes in it, but they should have at least tried.\n\n“Avatar”: Instant Wheels\n\nSaying there are mistakes and goofs in “Avatar” is like saying there are plums in plum pudding. We all know that it's going to happen, so let's get this over with.\n\nAt one point, as Jake tears open his capsule during a tense scene, it's clear that there is no wheelchair near him when the lid of the capsule opens, but when the camera angle changes, the wheelchair is right next to the capsule, close enough for Jake to slid himself into and kept the action rolling. Thankfully, it's a rather innocuous mistake, but there are plenty more where that came from.\n\n“Inglourious Basterds”: Maybe it Kept Falling Off\n\nRichard Sammel's character, Sgt. Rachtman is a brutal and ruthless SS officer that appeared on screen opposite the Basterds from another one of Quentin Tarantino's violent historical movies.\n\nWe already know that Tarantino isn't all that strict about having his movies be historically accurate, but even he toned it down for this World War II flick. Yet a mistake still slipped in during a scene that has Sammel's character wearing a medal on his left breast. In one shot, it's there; in the next, it's gone, and then it returns in the next shot.\n\n“Twilight”: Bella, There's a Cameraman\n\n“Twilight” is fun in its poor filmmaking, thanks in part to the barren expressions of lead star Kristen Stewart. The film itself is rife with errors, and one of the most noticeable mistakes is being able to see a cameraman in the curve of Bella's truck, such as you can see in the picture.\n\nA mistake like this reminds the viewers that they're watching a movie and can take them out of the experience – breaking rule number one for most artists of any stripe, be it writers, directors, or musicians.\n\n“Jurassic Park”: Why Are You Speaking to That Video\n\nProgrammer turned thief Dennis Nedry, played by Wayne Knight, is the biggest reason Jurassic Park went from the most amazing theme park ever to a disaster. At one point, Nedry appears to be talking with an accomplice on his computer via a live feed, as we do pretty often today. However, a closer look reveals that he's actually watching a pre-recorded video and speaking back to it.\n\nWhile it's clearly just a technical limitation the filmmakers had to work around, it's pretty obvious nowadays, and with increasing technical skills, it becomes more and more laughable every year.\n\n“Gladiator”: A Little Bit of Extra Propulsion\n\nAs far as historical movies go, “Gladiator” isn't the most accurate, but it's still remembered as one of the best. During the re-enactment of the Battle of Carthage, a chariot hits a wall and flips over, revealing a gas canister hidden in the back to help the vehicle get up to speed for the movie.\n\nThe Romans had plenty of technological advancements, but pressurized gas wasn't one of them. Unfortunately, resetting the entire action scene would have cost too much and taken too long, so they had to go with the shot that they got.\n\n“Commando”: The Magical Rebuilding Car\n\nThe 1985 movie “Commando” includes plenty of fun action scenes with our man Arnold, and one of those scenes is a long car chase sequence. One of the characters is driving a Porsche, and as you might expect from an eighties action movie that stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, the car is pretty beat up by the end of the scene.\n\nIn the next scene, however, the car has somehow been rebuilt and repaired. It's part of the charm of movies in the eighties, which were less about stellar filmmaking and more about making a movie that was simply a lot of fun.\n\n“Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines”: I Think Those Numbers Changed\n\nWhile running for their lives and trying to stop the machines from taking over, John Connor and the rest of the cast have to take to the sky to try and stay one step ahead of the machines.\n\nWhen they approach the plane on the ground, the plane's call number is clearly – as you can see from the picture – N3035C. However, once they're in the air, the plane's numbers change to N3413F. The reason for this is almost certainly difficulties with filming and renting planes, especially while flying.\n\n“American Sniper”: That New Baby Smell\n\n“American Sniper,” starring Bradley Cooper as an Iraq War veteran who has problems adjusting to civilian life again, is said by many to be a very accurate portrayal of the difficulties some soldiers can have when returning home. One aspect, however, wasn't so realistic.\n\nCooper very clearly picks up and cradles a plastic baby. Meaning... no one who was watching the film and has ever seen a baby thought for a moment that it was anything other than a fake, plastic baby. Cooper himself even laughed about it later on, during an interview with Ellen Degeneres: “I couldn't believe that we were working with a plastic baby...I was just like, this is nuts.”\n\n“The Last Samurai”: Ouch\n\nThere are lots of horses all over the place in “The Last Samurai,” and as every actor or actress knows, animals of any kind will make filming a movie more difficult and even dangerous. One poor extra knows this even more than most.\n\nAt one point during the middle of the film, Tom Cruise's character rides his horse into a group of soldiers who are standing at attention. As Cruise dismounts, the horse kicks backward, catching the poor extra right between the legs. Like...RIGHT between the legs. Thanks to the armor he was wearing, he manages to stay in character and props to him.\n\n“Spider-Man: Far From Home”: No Buses Allowed\n\nIn the second Spider-Man movie that is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Peter Parker and the other students from New York travel across the pond to Venice for a trip, which gets Parker involved in another superhero story. At the end of the story, after everything – or most things – have been resolved, Parker and the rest of the students pile onto a bus to head to the airport.\n\nThe only problem is, buses, and really any motor vehicles, aren't allowed in Venice. Due to the weight of the city sinking into the soft mud it was built on, some things had to stay away.\n\n“The Wizard of Oz”: Plain Black Slippers\n\nThere are a number of things that are iconic about “The Wizard of Oz.” One of them is what Dorothy is wearing, from her gingham dress to her twin pigtails to her red slippers. But during one scene, she seems to have left the latter at home.\n\nWhile the trees are pelting Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples, it's possible to catch a glimpse of Judy Garland wearing plain black shoes instead of the red flats she's supposed to have. Whether it was because of the introduction of color or just lax filmmaking standards compared to now, it happened.\n\n“Poltergeist”: What is She Saying?\n\nIf you saw “Poltergeist” in theaters, then you can probably recall some of the most famous scenes still. The top of the list of memorable ones is most likely when young Heather O'Rourke's character, Carol-Ann, turning to the camera and saying “They're he-ere.”\n\nIt's creepy, it's wonderful, and it will send a chill down your spine. Watch closely, however, and you'll see that the character's mouth doesn't exactly line up to what she's saying. It looks more like she's saying, “They're all here,” and the actress dubbed herself over later on.\n\n“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood”: The Wrong Coffee\n\nOne of the latest films Quentin Tarantino released was “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Set around 1969, it revolves around the gruesome murders of Sharon Tate by the Manson cult.\n\nHowever, viewers noticed a number of mistakes in the film when it came to the timing of items, such as California having numbered exit ramps, which didn't happen in real life until all the way in 2002. They also pointed out that the Pussycat Theatre didn't open until about five years after the film is set. Notably, they also pointed out that Starbucks wasn't even founded until 1971, two years after the film takes place.\n\n“Django Unchained”: The Cut\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has been in what feels like a hundred movies, which means we're bound to get some mistakes from him. This one is a little bit shocking – when he slams his hand down on a table during one scene in “Django Unchained,” he breaks a glass and cuts his hand. A real cut that is leaking real blood.\n\nHe managed to stay in character during it all and finish the scene. Director Tarantino liked the take so much it stayed in. Thankfully, later on, when Leo smears blood on Kerry Washington's face, they used fake blood.\n\n“Titanic”: Where Do You Want Me?\n\nSeeing a beautiful woman undressing is enough to get any guy flustered. While Leonardo DiCaprio isn't your everyday man, even he is still human. Thus, during the scene in “Titanic” when Rose undresses so that Jack can paint her, he fumbles his line, saying “over by the bed,” before correcting himself and saying “the couch.” It was a real flub by DiCaprio.\n\nThe filmmakers found it funny and kept it in the final cut of the movie. Just like, you know, everything else, it humanizes Jack a little bit, telling us he can get nervous too.\n\n“The Dark Knight Rises”: What Time is It?\n\nDuring the intense stock market scene in the third installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, the scene clearly takes place during the day. Yet while Batman is chasing the bad guys – and being chased by the police himself – through a tunnel, the sun falls faster than it ever has before.\n\nIt's suddenly a dark night (ha), which, while it does make for a more fun scene, the time change can be jarring. Even worse, at the beginning of the stock market scene, it looks as if the stock market had just opened for the day.\n\n“Braveheart”: A Strange Metal Beast\n\nWhile watching “Braveheart,” we're witness to numerous historical inaccuracies, such as kilts or the timeline of events, but those were decisions made by the filmmakers. One thing that is pure accident, however, is the gray sedan visible in the background of one shot during a big battle scene.\n\nAs horses charge, if you're eagle-eyed enough, you can spot a glimpse of what is clearly just a normal car, very much out of place during the thirteenth century, when the film is set. It only appears once, but that was enough to get people giggling – if they had seen it, that is.\n\n“The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers”: Dropping the Hardware\n\nAnother mistake from the extensive trilogy that makes up Peter Jackson's opus. In “The Two Towers,” when Éomer first meets Aragorn on the plains of Rohan, he dismounts to speak with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Once the discussion ends, Éomer jumps back onto his horse, dropping his sword in the process.\n\nIt's hard to see if you aren't looking for it, but keep your eyes open during the scene, and you'll see Éomer lose his weapon. Not a good look for a leader of this band from Rohan, even if he is currently exiled.\n\n“The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers”: Disappearing Handcuffs\n\nMerry and Pippin have been captured by the Uruk-Hai and are being schlepped to Isengard. Their situation has never been direr. That's what they think, at least, until a band of horsemen attacks the Uruks during the night, turning the place into a slaughter.\n\nMerry and Pippin try to slip away, bound by the hand. Except that Pippin's hands come unbound for no reason during his furious escape, only for the restraints to appear again a moment later. No doubt, keeping track of everything during such a hectic scene proved difficult.\n\n“Bad Boys”: That's a Cameraman\n\nBefore Michael Bay started blowing up Miami, a movie of the same name showed us Sean Penn being sent to reform school after accidentally killing a rival criminal's kid brother.\n\nDuring the movie, there are plenty of fights and dangerous moments, and during one such tussle, it's pretty easy to see...a cameraman in the shot and clearly not part of the actual cast. Just doing his thing as a cameraman. Your guess is as good as ours as to how this shot stayed in the film when it so easily will take anyone watching out of the film and make them laugh in derision.\n\n“The Fast and the Furious”: Tran Changing Shirts\n\nBefore the shift in filmmaking, this famous movie series was all about racing cars and pulling off stunts. It's still mostly about that, but now it has lots of heists, too. In the very first movie, we get a practically unmissable wardrobe mistake, though thankfully not one that has to be censored later on.\n\nIn the scene where Jesse and Tran race, in one shot, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the very next shot, he has a tank top. Did he tear off his out clothing in order to weigh him down less? Was it a bad camera angle? The filmmakers aren't saying.\n\n“The Goonies”: What Octopus?\n\nThe eighties adventure movie “The Goonies” had a pirate treasure, bad guys and girls, and lots more, turning it into one of the most memorable and well-liked movies for kids from the decade.\n\nNear the end of the film, a member of the Goonies, Data, says that the scariest part was “the octopus.” However, if you caught the movie in the theaters, there was no octopus around. Was Data just adding an embellishment? As it turns out, no – there really was an octopus scene left out of the theatrical release. The producers added it back in for the Disney Channel version.\n\n“North by Northwest”: He's Ready for Anything\n\nIn one of Hitchcock's thrillers, you can expect a powerful little pistol to make an appearance. In “North by Northwest,” the pistol in question, played by Eva Maria Saint, pulls out a handgun and fires at Cary Grant's character, startling everyone in the crowded room.\n\nHowever, not everyone was caught off-guard, as the picture above shows: one of the extras, a young boy, plugged his ears before-hand, even looking over his shoulder at the principal actors. Gunshots – and even blanks as were likely being used here – are incredibly loud, and it isn't out of the realm of possibility that the filmmakers warned the boy to plug his ears.\n\n“The Avengers”: Cap's Armor is Undamaged\n\nWe're all aware of the incredible third act of the first “Avengers” movie, which has the entire team taking on an alien army. After two hours of in-fighting, they've finally meshed and worked together as the music swells. Hammers, shields, arrows, bullets, laser blasts, and big green fists go flying in every direction.\n\nAt one point, Captain America takes a hit to the gut, dumping him to the ground. Thor hauls him back up, and Cap's armor is scarred at the spot of the hit, but only a few minutes later, we see that the armor is once again whole and undamaged.\n\n\"Aladdin\": They Should Have Covered Up\n\nTo change iconic costumes that millions of people grew up with was a bold move. For some reason, Disney keeps making the same old mistake, and \"Aladdin\" was no different. The costume designers decided to more appropriately clothe each of the main characters for a 2019 film.\n\nThis meant that Aladdin wasn't running around with a vest and no shirt, and Jasmine would cover up her midriff, and the audiences were upset. You don't mess with classical Disney!\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean\": Redcoats, Really?\n\nWhat's there not to love about the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise? There is this one thing that history lovers surely noticed..the uniforms designed for the British Soldiers. They were seen in the infamous red coats, but that uniform wasn't used until the late 1700s.\n\nSince the movie's premise takes place in the early 1700s, the uniform's use wasn't quite accurate. That doesn't mean the film wasn't fun!\n\nPirates of the Caribbean III: Singapore Wasn't Called Singapore\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide, making it the 14th highest-grossing film series of all time. The film series has had people hooked from its first release in 2003 with \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" This first film grossed $654 million worldwide. The films continued to see success and the next film, which was released 3 years later, earned almost $1.1 billion at the worldwide box office. The third film, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,\" was released in 2007.\n\nDuring this film, the Black Pearl crew are on their way to Singapore in the 1700s. However, all history fanatics out there will know that the area we know today as Singapore wasn’t Singapore at that time. It wasn’t named Singapore until 1819, when the British established a trading post there. When the movie took place, the area was ruled by the Johor Sultanate, which consisted of parts of modern Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This historical oversight is overshadowed by all the great things the films manage to do, like combine horror, romance, and comedy to create something very unique.\n\nHello, Dolly! - A Change Of Dress That Was Way Too Fast\n\nMany people were a fan of this 1969 romantic comedy musical film, which was directed by the great Gene Kelly. The film won three Oscars and four Academy Awards. Despite this, it wasn’t a big commercial success. And still, many people loved the costumes and glittery dresses, which perfectly fit the film’s time period of 1890. And yet, despite the exquisiteness of the outfits, there was something particularly off with one beautiful dress. It seemed to be transformed in only a few seconds.\n\nWhat we are referring to is one scene where Cornelius (played by Michael Crawford) is dancing with a girl who is decked out beautifully in an extravagant red dress. During this scene, it is quite obvious that the dress has its flaws, as is seen by the hem dragging on the pavement and thus dirtying the bottom of the dress. During the next scene, the girl notices that her dress is dirty, so she sets off to change into something cleaner. This happened in a very short span of time. While this is a tiny detail, it nonetheless is a flaw that is worth noting.\n\nCloser: Portman's Bra Goes On Strike\n\nIf you thought that bra malfunctions on the list were over, you’re mistaken. In this 2004 star-powered film, Natalie Portman joins the rankings of wardrobe malfunctions with some trouble in the bra department. While you would expect the character to show some skin considering that she plays a prostitute, the young actress hadn’t before shown more than a little of her stomach or cleavage.\n\nBut, in one scene in the film, while Portman is having a conversation, she has a wardrobe malfunction when her bra goes on strike, leaving her to show more than she would have preferred to show. This goes without saying that more was shown than the actress or director had expected.\n\nThe Notebook: James Marsden's Hair Is Constantly Changing Color\n\nRegarded as one of the best romantic comedies by many women out there, 2004’s \"The Notebook\" huddled together many girls for movie night and many couples (not by the men’s choice.) But, this favorite romantic comedy still has its faults, despite its success at the box office and cult following.\n\nMany loved the film thanks to the passionate love that Noah and Allie have for one another. And yet, others are drawn to the film because of the wealthy Lon Hammond, Jr. He looks great; there’s no denouncing that. But, his hair seems to have a special power that leaves even the most sparkling of vampires in despair. From shot to shot, his hair seems to make the impossible possible and changes colors from black to brown. If you are able to look past that and enjoy the movie for what it is, then you might thoroughly enjoy yourself.\n\nPretty Woman: You Can See Her Entire Breast!\n\nJulia Roberts had a pretty horrific wardrobe malfunction that left her body entirely exposed. This is ironic considering that Julia Roberts stood firmly against nude scenes during her career. Nudity is not her thing; she told E! News. But, in the 1990 romantic comedy directed by Garry Marshall, her values were put to a test.\n\nDuring one scene, Vivian (played by Roberts) wears a thin gown, revealing much of what’s lies under the sheer material. One can safely assume that this wasn’t a part of the script, considering Roberts’ stance against nude scenes. After Roberts is seen in her gown, viewers can actually see one of her breasts quite visibly.\n\nThe Color Purple: No Clip-on Ties In 1916\n\nThis is another successful film adapted from a great novel. Alice Walker published \"The Color Purple\" in 1982. The movie adaptation was released a few years after that. Due to the small window of years in between the novel and film, there wasn’t so much room for messing up the tone of Walker’s novel, and viewers were sure to notice. While the film turned out to be a great success, there is still one thing that viewers may have picked up on.\n\nAlbert, who’s played by Danny Glover, sports a clip-on tie. Sure, it’s a nice tie. But, this wouldn’t have existed a decade earlier. The clip-on tie didn’t come into existence until the late 1920s. \"The Color Purple,\" on the other hand, took place in 1916.\n\nVanilla Sky: The Accidental Slip\n\nThis 2001 psychological sci-fi thriller is jam-packed with action. It has the viewer glued to the screen, waiting to see what will go down next. In one particular scene, David (played by Tom Cruise) has Julie (played by Cameron Diaz) captured and securely tied down to the bed. She isn’t wearing much other than a sheer gown.\n\nAs Cameron moves around, the top of her gown falls, revealing her breast. She takes notice of this and quickly shrugs her shoulders so that the gown falls back into place. Regardless of this slip-up, the scene got past multiple sets of eyes and into the theater straight to audiences around the globe. Considering that Cameron Diaz was nominated for both a Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe Award for her performance, we guess the wardrobe malfunction must have done her well.\n\nSense and Sensibility: Modern Diapers In The 19th Century?\n\nJane Austen’s novel, \"Sense and Sensibility,\" came to life on the big screen in 1995. The drama film, which was directed by Ang Lee, starred Kate Winslet, Elinor Dashwood, and Hugh Grant. The film was a masterpiece, to say the least, and was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Despite its success, nitpicky fans aren’t able to ignore one historical inaccuracy in the film.\n\nThe inaccuracy we are referring to involved an adorable baby who is all bundled up. Nothing seems wrong until you notice something very out of place; the baby is doting a modern-day diaper! This sort of luxury clearly would not have existed in those times and doesn’t fit with the 19th-century setting that the film does a good job at creating.\n\nTitanic: The Ever-Changing Beauty Mark On Rose's Face\n\nJames Cameron’s 1997 \"Titanic\" was a huge critical and commercial success. Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio took the world by storm with their performances, and their romance stole many people's’ hearts along the way. The film was nominated for a whopping 14 Academy Awards and grossed more than $1.84 billion, making it the first film to surpass the billion-dollar mark. And yet, with such success, you would think that the makeup team would have been of the highest quality, no?\n\nWell, they did do a pretty remarkable job, but they made one quite humorous mistake when they switched Rose Dawson’s face around. When Rose Dawson, played by Kate Winslet, first appears in the movie, her beauty mark is on the left side of her face. But, in other scenes, it moves to the right. Magic or just a fault of the makeup artists?\n\nGallipoli: Gibson's Privates Slipped Out\n\nIn this 1981 Australian war film, 25-year-old Mel Gibson stars as Frank Dunne, an unemployed young man who enlists in the Australian Army during the First World War. Dunne and his friend are sent to fight in Gallipoli. The movie shows the men slowly lose their innocence regarding the purpose of war. This was one of Gibson’s first films. The movie changes certain events for dramatic purposes and thus contains a number of obvious historical inaccuracies.\n\nWhile this movie drama helped define Gibson’s role as a serious actor, he suffered a significant wardrobe malfunction during filming- when he goes for a swim with several other soldiers, some of his private parts are exposed.\n\nThe Terminator: Arnie Goes Full Monty\n\nThe classic 1984 science fiction film helped establish James Cameron’s directing career while solidifying Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career. You might be surprised to hear that even the former Governor of California had a bad wardrobe malfunction. In one of the scenes, the governor walks on punks without any clothes on. While the scene is shot from a distance, viewers still see a bit more of Arnie than you thought.\n\nBecause the movie was filmed in the 80s, its quality wasn’t great, and therefore, you couldn’t see much. But if you get the Blu-ray version, you’re in for quite the treat.\n\nJulius Caesar: No Bullet Bras In The Times Of Julius Caesar\n\nThis 1953 adaptation of the Shakespearean play did pretty well in the box office and with critics. It won a few Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture. But most viewers overlooked one small historical accuracy. So, we thought we’d point it out for you.\n\nAs you can see from the picture above, the woman is wearing a supportive bra. While most of the time, bras remain under a woman’s shirt and aren’t visible, bullet bras have quite the opposite effect. They protrude quite obviously through clothing. This isn’t a problem at all unless you take into consideration the time period of Julius Caesar. If you think about it, this wasn’t exactly a time period when bras were available in so many different shapes and colors.\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer: Unintentional Peep Show\n\nThose who are fans of horror films most likely overlooked this wardrobe malfunction, especially if they were enthralled by the next moment of gore. And yet, the scene went on long enough to make some viewers notice and others trying to catch a better view.\n\nDuring one scene, Sarah Michelle Gellar’s character, Helen, is climbing a rope. The scene seems innocent until the perspective of the camera shifts and the cameraman takes some creative liberties. As Gellar reaches for the rope, her poorly fitted dress lets the audience see exactly that which the dress is attempting to hide.\n\nI Dream of Jeannie: You Can See The Stand-in's Face\n\nJeannie the genie (portrayed by Barbara Eden) and her mortal husband Tony (portrayed by Larry Hagman) enthralled audiences on the hit show \"I Dream of Jeannie.\" They cracked up the world with their mischievous and rowdy ways in the 1960s. Despite this, more observant fans of the show noticed something different in the episode called “My Sister, the Homemaker” during Season 5. Something seemed off.\n\nDuring this episode, Barbara Eden played Jeannie and her evil brunette twin sister. In order for both characters to be on screen at the same time, a stand-in was used. Of course, the face of the stand-in was supposed to be covered in order to make the illusion successful. But, at one point in the episode, viewers are able to see the stand-in entirely. Whoops!\n\nGangs of New York: Inaccurate Firefighter Uniforms\n\nMartin Scorsese’s \"Gangs of New York,\" which was released in 2002, had some pretty huge actors in its cast like Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz, just to name a few. The film is set in the New York slums in 1863 and is inspired by the non-fiction book, \"The Gangs of New York.\" The film follows the New York Draft Riots, which erupted into violence in 1863. Scorsese spent nearly twenty years working on the project until 1999, when Harvey Weinstein acquired it. It was finally released in 2002 and grossed $193 million against a $100 million budget. The film was nominated for ten Oscars.\n\nFor the most part, \"Gangs of New York\" succeeds in staying historically accurate. But, there was one minor detail overlooked by producers. The firemen in the film wear uniforms that aren’t so different than what firemen wear today. Considering that the movie took place in 1863, it’s safe to assume that firefighter uniforms looked much different.\n\nSaving Private Ryan: Soldiers Mostly Wore Brown Boots In WWII, Not Black\n\nSteven Spielberg’s 1998 epic war film \"Saving Private Ryan\" is a classic World War II film. It is gory, graphic, and has many intense scenes. The film received universal acclaim from both critics and audiences and grossed $481.8 million worldwide. It proceeded to be a big presence at the Academy Awards, receiving 11 nominations and claiming several of them. Despite the film’s undeniable success, there is one inaccuracy that most people overlook.\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan\" has many scenes where rough, frantic soldiers are just doing their jobs. Most people overlook this error because of this, and it’s pretty hard to catch. So what error are we referring to? The soldiers' boots, during this time period, would have been jump-boots.\n\nThere Will Be Blood: Day-Lewis' Boots Have Waffle Soles, Which Didn't Exist In The 1800s\n\nWith this next mistake, you really would need a good eye to catch it. This movie masterpiece received significant critical praise, particularly for the performance of Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview. 2007’s \"There Will Be Blood\" follows the quest of a silver-miner who becomes an oilman on his search for wealth during Southern California’s oil boom of the late 19th century. Despite the critical praise that the film received and the 2 Oscars, we are going to nit-pick because that’s what we came here to do.\n\nSo, if you are as detailed as we are, you would have noticed that the bottom of character Daniel Plainview’s boots contradicts history. The pattern on the soles belonged to a type of shoe called waffle shoes, and they weren't around in the late 19th century, which is the time in which the film is set. Still, the flaw is insignificant when considering what a masterpiece the film is.\n\nThe Last Samurai: A 17th Century Armor For A 19th Century Samurai\n\n2006’s drama war film, \"The Last Samurai,\" did well at the box office, making a total of $456 million. The film was received well upon its release and was praised for the acting, writing, directing, score, visuals, and costumes. Generally speaking, it’s a good movie that avoids major errors. But, there is still one thing that most viewers overlook.\n\nIn the film, viewers see Tom Cruise’s character Captain Nathan Algren decked out in detailed samurai gear. While it seems fitting for a samurai to wear this, and it does look good, a warrior during this time period wouldn’t be wearing this. The film took place in 1876, and yet the armor dates back to 1600. So, by the film’s time, the armor would have been outdated.\n\nTroy: Umbrellas In Ancient Troy?... Not So Much\n\nWhile 2004's \"Troy\" didn't fare so well with critics, it was pretty successful at the box office. It grossed nearly $500 million on a $175 million budget. The film was inspired by Homer's great \"Iliad,\" which gave it an epic “everything-must-be-big-and-grand” sort of feel to it. It had watchers completely convinced and enthralled in the war scenes until one particular scene.\n\nDuring the scene, the character Paris, which was played by Orlando Bloom, stands under a pink parasol. When put like that, you’re probably wondering what in the world a pink umbrella was doing in the middle of a movie like this. And that’s exactly our point. In reality, Homeric warriors weren't privy to such frilly luxuries.\n\nAmadeus: Zippers Weren't Invented Until 1918\n\nThis 1984 film is widely considered to be one of the best films of all time. It received 53 awards nominations and won 40 of them, 8 of which were Academy Awards and 4 Golden Globe Awards. Despite this, even the most dedicated fans are not able to look past the creative liberties the director took. To say the least, the film was hardly lacking historical inaccuracies. Most critics were highly impressed with the film, but some definitely were soured by the way that Mozart was portrayed as an imbecile during parts of the film.\n\nOne historical mishap that people may have overlooked was the zippers that dancers donned on their outfits. Zippers weren’t invented until the early 1900s. They clearly didn’t exist during Mozart’s years in the late 1700s. So Mozart could have even lived longer than his young age of 35, and still, it wouldn’t have been until 1918 that the invention would come to life.\n\nWhere Eagles Dare: A Hairstyle Ahead Of Its Time\n\nThe 1968 \"Where Eagles Dare\" was a big commercial success. The British WWII action film stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The movie nowadays is considered to be quite the classic and is noted for the phrase \"Broadsword calling Danny Boy.\" While it's a great movie, it’s yet another war film that slightly veered from the style of the time period, particularly in regard to the hairstyles of some of the characters in the film.\n\nHeidi, who was played by Ingrid Pitt, sported quite an interesting hairdo. It did not seem at all fitting for the time period, and that’s because it wasn’t. While the hairstyle would have fared well in a film set in the 60s, it simply just seemed off in the time of WWII.\n\nPompeii: You Couldn't Wear Purple Next To Emperor Nero!\n\nWhen you are more concerned with an entire civilization potentially wiping out from a volcano, fashion is definitely the last thing on your mind. And therefore, it’s the perfect opportunity for us to go ahead and point out a historical inaccuracy from 2014’s Pompeii.\n\nWhile the generals in the film may have felt very bold in their gaudy purple garbs, this is actually deviance from history. Generals would never have been found wearing purple next to Nero. And if so, they would have definitely been done with.\n\nSchindler’s List: Most Women Didn't Shave Back Then - Especially During WWII\n\nThe 1993 Spielberg directed \"Schindler’s List,\" which follows the life of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of thousands of Polish-Jewish refugees from the Holocaust by giving them jobs in his factories during WWII. The film fared very well at the box office, earning $322 million worldwide against a $22 million budget. Critics also perceived it well. It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, seven of which it won. It is often perceived as one of the best films ever made. And still, despite its success, there is still something off in the film that we must point out.\n\nYou may have noticed that the women in the film have clean-shaven legs. You may also notice that they lack armpit hair. While nowadays, this would hold true as realistic, in those days, women walked around happy with their bodily hair.\n\nSpartan: The Boob-Exposing Punch\n\n2004's political thriller, \"Spartan,\" was directed by David Mamet. It starred a bunch of talented names like Val Kilmer, Ed O’Neill, William H. Macy, and Kristen Bell. Kristin Bell makes it on our list as yet another victim of a wardrobe malfunction.\n\nIn the movie, Kristen Bell plays the role of Laura Newton, the President’s daughter who goes missing. In one of the scenes, Bell is punched by another man. The punch is so hard that it ends up slightly exposing Kristin Bell's breast.\n\nDjango Unchained: Django's Shady (Not At All Accurate) Shades\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s 2012 \"Django Unchained\" had quite the talented cast, including Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson. It’s no surprise that the film won several awards, as Tarantino directs a mean film. \"Django Unchained\" is packed with action and suspect and sunglasses; what? While Jamie Foxx looks very profound in those shades, and it adds to the look of his character, there is a problem with this. These sunglasses wouldn’t have existed during those times.\n\nAs fans of the film know, it takes place in 1858, shortly before the start of the American Civil War. People at that time would have been eager to get their hands on a pair of sunglasses so as to protect themselves from the scorching Texas sun. But, realistically, it would have made more sense for Django to go without sunglasses and be left to do what everyone else did at the time- squint through the haze of the sun. But, Jamie Foxx does pull off the look, we must admit.\n\nPearl Harbor: Women's Bare Legs Were Rarely Seen In The 1940s\n\n\"Pearl Harbor\" is a 2001 romantic period war drama film that starred Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, among others. The film is based on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. When you’re basing a film on an actual event, every detail is important. The details can make all the difference between engaging your audience and creating an authentic film to losing your audience completely. \"Pearl Harbor\" got negative reviews from critics, and transparent flaws, both plot-based and historical, are one of the reasons why. But, there was one wardrobe-related flaw in particular, which many people may have actually overlooked.\n\nOf course, \"Pearl Harbor\" is set during World War II. The attack took place in 1941, during a time when women would have dressed in a certain manner. If you pay close enough attention, you will notice that the girls in the film were with their legs bare. But, women during this time period would never have been seen like this. They would have been wearing nylon stockings or painted on stockings with a line down the back of the legs considering that nylon was in short supply.\n\nPulp Fiction: Split-second Peep Show\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s 1994 crime film classic is known for many things, like famous one-liners, dance moves, and even a signature Mexican standoff. But, it isn’t known for its actors showing too much skin. You would actually be surprised to know that Butch Coolidge, portrayed by Bruce Willis, unintentionally exposed himself while filming.\n\nWhile Butch is talking to his girlfriend Fabienne after he takes a shower, he naturally dries off with a towel. But, when he goes to wipe his face with the towel, he pulls the towel away from his body for a second and unintentionally gives viewers a showing of his downstairs region.\n\nPride and Prejudice: Rubber Boots Didn't Exist In 1810\n\n\"Pride and Prejudice,\" the film, was released in 2005. It is, of course, based on the Jane Austen novel with the same title. The film strayed a bit from the novel’s details, as films often do, which is understandable. But, it’s harder to justify the film also drifting from historical facts.\n\nDo you recall those trendy rubber boots that Lizzie (played by Keira Knightley) wore in the film? Those actually didn’t exist in Jane Austen’s time at all. Jane Austen passed away in 1817 when people definitely weren’t moseying around in rubber boots. Rubber boots were first invented in 1852. Luckily, this detail is quite minor, and for most of the film, they are hidden beneath Lizzie’s long dress.\n\nBack to the Future: Marty Plays A Non-Existent Guitar\n\n“Great movie, but–that did not exist back then!” As you probably know by now, this was the case with many popular movies. And yes, this is unfortunately what we have to say about Robert Zemeckis’ 1985 classic \"Back to the Future.\" Sure, the movie was a huge commercial success that grossed over $381 million worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of the year and won the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing. However, that doesn’t mean that it didn’t have its flaws.\n\nThe science-fiction adventure film stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, who accidentally travels back in time to 1955. You must have thought that Marty had an aptitude for the guitar. And there’s no doubt that he did. Nobody else could have played “Johnny B. Goode” quite as well as him. And there’s a good reason for that. The amazing Gibson ES-345 guitar didn’t exist in 1955. The guitar came out only in 1958. So it seems that he would have needed to time travel to get his hands on the futuristic guitar.\n\nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves: Telescopes Didn't Exist In The 12th Century\n\nWhen \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" was released in 1991, it wasn’t received so well by critics. But, it did take in a nice $390.5 million at the box office.\n\nBut, one small detail bewildered viewers. During one scene, Robin Hood’s friend is quite captivated by a telescope. He shows Robin Hood with a spark in his eye. While the scene is charming, it’s far from accurate. The telescope wouldn’t have existed during the film’s time, which was set in the year 1194. The telescope wasn’t invented until the 17th century.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain: Beautiful Dress, But Not For The 1920s\n\nThe 1952 musical-romantic comedy film portrayed Hollywood in the late 20s. While the film was only a modest hit when it was first released, it has since received the title of the best film musical ever made and has a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film gets even the most forbidding of souls singing along with it. But, despite its perfection, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film contains one inaccuracy, which for the sake of our list, prevents it from being entirely perfect.\n\nDebbie Reynolds, who played the part of Kathy Selden, gave a legendary performance. While her acting and singing skills were on point, the same cannot be said of her wardrobe. During one scene, one of her outfits clashed with the time period of the 1920s. Reynolds sported a pink dress, which fit her like a glove, and flaunted her figure, yet didn’t fit the setting of the movie and the fashion trends that would have been popular at the time.\n\nThe Doors: An 80s Ray Ban Sunglasses Model In A 60s Film\n\nWe just have to point out that something in this film did not exist during the time that it is meant to take place. What’s more is that there are some sunglasses in the film that seem very out of place, despite that Val Kilmer wears them quite well and pulls off a convincing Jim Morrison.\n\n1991’s \"The Doors\" is based on a true story. It follows the life of Jim Morrison and his timeless band The Doors. In the film, Jim Morrison can be seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses. But, the model that he wears was released only in the 80s, which means it was more than a decade later than Jim Morrison’s death in the 70s. Most of the film took place in the 60s, so they seemed to have stretched several decades into a short film.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Nazis Didn't Have Medals Pinned Onto Their Uniforms Back Then\n\nIt’s no secret that the Indiana Jones franchise was a huge commercial success. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" was released in 1989 and was a great addition to the franchise. It received raving reviews from critics. It made over $474 million at the box office against a $50 million budget. Despite its success, there was one historical inaccuracy that was quite obvious.\n\nThe Nazis in the film look pretty convincing, thanks to their uniforms. But, one accessory on their uniforms wouldn’t have been around at the time, as the film shows. The medals pinned to the nazis’ chests didn’t come to fruition until the end of the war. However, the film takes place in the middle of the war.\n\nThe Ten Commandments: Underwire Bras And Blue Dresses In Ancient Egypt? We Don't Think So...\n\nEven during Biblical times, women needed the support of a well-fitted bra. So, in biblical films, it’s no surprise that females in the movie would be donning a bra. In the 1956 film \"The Ten Commandments,\" Nefretiri (played by Anne Baxter) looks dashing in her exquisite jewelry and sheer blue dress.\n\nWhile she had most viewers mesmerized by her beauty, she definitely had her female viewers thinking something else as well. As stunning as she looked in the sheer dress, she could have benefited from a better bra, and the editing of the film could have used better censors. Regardless, Baxter’s lacy bra is clearly visible through the thin material of her dress. The color of the dress is also not so relevant to the time period, as it would have been virtually impossible during those times to get a color like that. One might say that Nefretiri is a trendsetter.\n\nCatch Me If You Can: Adams' Braces Didn't Exist At The Time\n\nBraces seem to be the perfect addition to further encourage a character's naive and shy persona. It makes the smile they flash all the more adorable and quirky. This was surely the case with Brenda (played by Amy Adams) in 2002’s \"Catch Me If You Can.\" Despite the film being a financial and critical success, producers overlooked this; these types of braces worn by Brenda weren’t around during the time the film took place.\n\n\"Catch Me If You Can\" is set in 1963. However, Amy Adams wears stick-on braces that didn’t become mainstream until the late 1970s, so it might have been unlikely that someone would have braces like that. Still, the film received favorable views from even the harshest critics.\n\nThe Wedding Singer: Drew's Short Hair Wasn't Typical Of The 80s\n\nThe 1998 music-filled romantic comedy, \"The Wedding Singer,\" attracted a large fan base, many thanks to Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. While it didn’t receive rave reviews from critics, it performed very well at the box office, making $100 million against its humble $18 million budget. In the film, Drew Barrymore plays a waitress named Julia.\n\n\"The Wedding Singer\" is set in the ’80s. One small inaccuracy in the film doesn’t have to do with wardrobe, like most others on this list. But, the short hairstyle that Barrymore dons isn’t a very fitting style for the ’80s. It seems like a bit of the 90s snuck its way into the film.\n\nSeabiscuit: The Strapped Helmets Didn't Exist Yet\n\nEverybody loves a good horse movie, especially when it involves a race to victory. The 2003 equestrian sports film \"Seabiscuit\" is based on the life and racing career of Seabiscuit, who experienced unexpected success. He was a popular media sensation in the U.S. during the Great Depression. The movie fared pretty well with critics as well as with moviegoers. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Tobey Maguire starred in the film as Red Pollard.\n\nAs touching as the film was, it was still ridden with flaws. The historical event takes place during the time of The Great Depression. Yet, the jockeys in the film wear strapped helmets that definitely did not exist during that time. But you know what they say, it’s better to be safe than sorry, and it looks like the producers wanted to adhere to this.\n\nGladiator: Russell Crowe's Lycra Shorts\n\nWe have no problem giving credit where it is deserved. It definitely took a lot of talent to master the fight scenes in this 2000 action film. Making sure that each move looks realistic but still flows smoothly and guaranteeing that actors are under safe conditions is not an easy task. But, there is one blooper that most viewers overlook in the film.\n\nWhen Russell Crowe fell, viewers can see his lycra shorts. While there’s nothing like a man in some lycra wear, nobody in ancient Rome would have been wearing Lycra shorts. Even if they wanted to wear it underneath their armor, those shorts didn’t exist in those times. And sorry to say, but the ancient Romans definitely missed out!\n\nPulp Fiction: Bullet Holes Before The Bullets\n\nThe 1994 American crime film \"Pulp Fiction\" was a major critical and commercial success. It received seven Oscar nominations and won for Best Original Screenplay. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were all nominated for Oscars for their performances. It’s safe to say that the film completely revitalized their careers and brought them worldwide fame. The film, which marked an important turning point in film culture, is widely regarded as Tarantino’s masterpiece. Its award-winning screenplay introduced some of the most famous one-liners in film history and is Tarantino’s most quotable film. And yet, despite the film’s success, it is not without errors.\n\nIn the film’s most famous scene, when Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield attempt to collect Marsellus Wallace’s suitcase from Brett’s apartment, a surprise assailant jumps out and tries to shoot them with a gun. The shots miss, and Vega and Winnfield kill the assailant, and Winnfield concludes it as divine intervention and begins citing biblical verses. If you watch carefully, you will notice that before the bullets start being fired, there are already bullet holes on the wall behind Jules and Vincent.\n\nUnforgiven: Hackman's Pants Had Loopholes\n\n1992’s \"Unforgiven\" was a big commercial success. Although it had a small budget of $14 million, it made over $159 at the box office. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, 4 of which it won. Among those awards, it won for Best Picture, making it the third Western film to win this award.\n\nBut don’t be mistaken by its success. The film still has its faults, as minor as they are. Let’s take Gene Hackman, for example. Sure, he gave an outstanding performance as “Little” Bill Dagget, but one part of his wardrobe leaves us questioning the decisions made by the costume designer of the film. Let’s take his character’s pants with loopholes. These types of pants did not exist in 1880, the year during which the film is meant to take place. Fortunately, the film is that great, so we forgive this error.\n\nBraveheart: Kilts Weren't A Thing Yet In The 1200s\n\nThis 1995 epic war film was a huge hit that provided people with a lot of enjoyment. And enjoy they did. The film received positive reviews from critics who praised the actors’ performances. It grossed $210.4 million worldwide against a $75.6 million budget. At the 68th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for ten awards and won five of them.\n\nMel Gibson directed and starred in it as the amazing William Wallace, a steely Scottish knight. He surely looked dashing in that kilt. While we know that looks are important, for the sake of historical accuracy, Gibson and his fellow men should have gone without the kilts. Nothing says Scottish like a good ol’ kilt, but Scottish people haven’t always rocked the kilt. The kilt came out much later in time, and not in 1280, the year during which the film takes place.\n\nMy Girl: Mood Rings Weren't Popular Yet\n\nIn 1991, \"My Girl\" was released. While it did have some pretty big actors, like Anna Chlumsky, Macaulay Culkin, and Jamie Lee Curtis, some critics loved it while others hated it. One thing that the film succeeded in doing is enveloping its viewers in 1970s nostalgia. But, if you noticed one particularly misplaced accessory, you might have lost track of the sense of the 70s for a second.\n\nThe mood ring that Vada (portrayed by Anna Chlumsky) wears is a great piece, especially for a young girl. Who doesn’t love a device which is able to determine whether you’re happy or sad? But, unfortunately for the film’s accuracy, mood rings weren’t in existence until 1975 and not in 1972, when the movie is set to take place.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark: Jeans and 1980s Fashion Don't Fit In Indiana Jones' 1930s Setting\n\nYou might not consciously notice extras when you’re watching movies, but they are there, in all their glory, waiting for their few seconds of fame. And not only are they there, but they contribute a lot to the atmosphere of a film. They help viewers gain a sense of the setting of the film and its era. Therefore, it’s important to also set requirements for the actors’ clothing. In this film, one extra seemed to have slipped under the radar and not follow suit with others.\n\nIf you watch the film enough and pay close attention, you’ll notice that among the tapestry and other extras dressed appropriately for 1936, you’ll see a man standing in his jeans. They are nice jeans and all, for 1981. But, for 1936, the jeans and this man seem very out of place."
