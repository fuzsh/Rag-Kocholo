        "text": "6-DAY BODY MAKEOVER: Drop One Whole Dress or Pant Size in Just 6 Days–and Keep It Off by Michael Thurmond: Remember the Grapefruit Diet? The Hardboiled Egg Diet? Any fad diet that makes you drop weight quickly but is unsustainable for more than a few days? This is the newest entry into the marketplace of fast weight loss. Thurmond is known for his 6 Week Body Makeover, which emphasizes an exercise routine and diet based on your body type. So does this new book, but with a more restrictive diet. The idea is that you can jumpstart your weight loss by, in my case, eating nothing but fresh tuna and distilled water for six days. Different body types get different foods, but this is not a diet I would dare show my doctor. Still, if you are looking to drop a few pounds for a special occasion, and won’t mind gaining it back the day after, it probably won’t kill you. But don’t hold me to that. 05/05 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch.\n\n52 PROJECTS: RANDOM ACTS OF EVERYDAY CREATIVITY by Jeffrey Yamaguchi: This is a wonderful little book from the creator of http://www.52projects.com website. Everyone has a creative streak and some of us are better than others at bringing it out. This little book has positive ideas to get the creative juices flowing. The first half of the book talks about why these projects are so important, how they work and why you should try them when you need some added inspiration. Then there are the 52 projects which range from writing assignments, photography and other artistic suggestions, and lots of fun, really different ideas like #2, “Find a Recipe for Key Lime Pie.” Now I live in south Florida so I know that there are more recipes for Key Lime Pie than you would think – but it doesn’t stop with just finding the recipe. Then it’s baking it, inviting friends over to eat it, taking pictures of the party and so on. Or #14, “Write down the lyrics to your favorite songs.” Or #50, “Go to the library” with additional suggestions of what to do when you get there. This book makes the perfect graduation gift, a nice little gift for no reason at all (my favorite kind of gift) for any of your creative friends. 06/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal by Ben Mezrich: Mezrich, author of Bringing Down the House which became the film, 21, takes on the founders of Facebook – without even talking to one of them. This is purportedly nonfiction, but let’s call it creative nonfiction, and the bottom line is that it’s a fascinating, fun read. Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin met at Harvard as undergrads and became fast friends. They had a lot in common, they were both social outcasts yet brilliant in math. Zuckerberg gets the idea to hack into the school’s computer system and create a database for the male students to rate the female students. He almost crashed Harvard’s computer system in the process but they didn’t kick him out of school for it. That idea was the baby that grew up to become Facebook. Zuckerberg is the bad guy here, the one who created Facebook by stealing ideas from his friends and not paying anyone back. There is great irony in the founder of a social networking site alienating his friends in the process, and the ‘betrayal’ in the subtitle rests at his door. It’s also interesting that a social networking site was started by two guys who were socially inept, and even more interesting that Zuckerberg refused to talk to the author. What to believe? Who knows, but nonetheless, it’s a good story. 09/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE: ONE FAMILY’S STRUGGLE WITH AN AGONIZING MEDICAL MYSTERY, by James Patterson & Hal Friedman: Cory Friedman was a typical five year old boy. That is, until he wakes up one morning with an urgent need to shake his head. This need is just the beginning of years of uncontrollable ticks, verbal utterances, and other unmanageable behavior. Cory is ultimately diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE is a story told by Cory Friedman and his father, Hal. The reader gets an inside look at the living hell that this family went through in the thirteen years it took to “control” this illness. Cory was put on so many types of medications, they were soon unable to determine if the tics and other problems he was having was a result of the Tourette’s or of the medicine he was on. Nothing appeared to help; Cory’s symptoms just got worse. This is an honest, heart wrenching tale of Cory’s torment. Cory was willing to share this misery with others, in the hopes that someone with the same condition might gain something from this. I can’t say enough about how amazing this book is. I believe that this tale of perseverance, dedication, and love, would be beneficial to any family undergoing any sort of medical or behavioral problem. 11/08 Jennifer Lawrence\n\nALONG THE FLORIDA TRAIL by Bart Smith & Sandra Friend: Most people have heard of the Appalachian Trail (especially lately) but not too many are familiar with the Florida National Scenic Trail. It runs more than 1500 miles from the Everglades at the southern end of the state, through Pensacola up in the Florida Panhandle. While there aren’t any majestic mountains, there are flora and fauna unique to Florida, and while bears aren’t usually a problem, there are alligators and the endangered Florida panther. Friend spent five months hiking the trail to create this beautiful book that captures a part of Florida most tourists – and many residents – never get to see. 07/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAmerica (The Book): A Citizen’s Guide to Democracy Inaction by Jon Stewart and the writers of The Daily Show: Presented as a textbook (perhaps “faux textbook” would be more appropriate) it is entertaining and educational. Stewart has a way of pointing out the obvious; in chapter five, The Judicial System, the following discussion question is asked (p.101): “How many of the nine Supreme Court justices can you name? How many of the nine members of The Brady Bunch can you name? What does that say about you?” A lot of laughs and a lot of good points made. A really good book – and Publishers Weekly’s Book of the Year, deservedly so. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAMERICAN BAND: Music, Dreams, and Coming of Age in the Heartland by Kristen Laine: Anyone who’s ever been in marching band, or has a child in marching band, will want to read this intimate look at the Marching Minutemen of Concord High School, in Elkhart, Indiana. Laine spent a year with these kids and really got to know them, and their band director. I found all the band stuff fascinating because my only experience with marching band was when my daughter started high school last year, so it’s interesting to see a different perspective. The other major theme of the book is the strong emphasis on the Christianity of the band members. Frankly, I found it a bit unsettling as I am a staunch believer in the separation of church and state, and it also bored me, thus making the book more difficult for me to read and I found myself skimming at times. But despite that, the band stuff is interesting enough and unusual enough that I still have to recommend it anyway. 09/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAMERICAN IDOL: THE UNTOLD STORY by Richard Rushfield: I admit I’m a fan, and frankly this book is not going to appeal to anyone who isn’t. The “untold story” is pretty much a rehash of all the goings on and gossip since the show’s inception, along with some background on Simon Fuller and how the show got to America. For fans it is part nostalgia, part explanation for some mistakes made along the way, but mostly confirmation of what we already know. Paula Abdul was the star power at the show’s inception but we all know who became the real star. I had forgotten a lot of this, like the two co-hosts the first year, and this book brought it all back along with some smiles, laughter and even a tear or two. With all the changes the show has gone through, especially this year, I found this book to be a fitting ending to the American Idol era. With Simon gone, the show just isn’t the same. 04/11 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNEY OF BARACK OBAMA by the editors of LIFE Magazine: This is a beautiful coffee table book just in time for the holidays. Learn about our new President-elect via candid pictures and posed shots from the campaign, as well as family photos of Barack, Michelle and the girls, along with a forward by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and essays written by some incredible writers – Gay Talese, Andrei Codrescu, Fay Weldon and others. A wonderful gift for any Obama supporter – I know I’ll treasure this book. 11/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAMERICAN ON PURPOSE: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Tourist by Craig Fergusun: Who would expect a tough guy growing up in Scotland would dream of becoming an astronaut and an American citizen? He may have given up on the first dream, but he proudly fulfilled the second, becoming an American citizen in 2008. Shortly after that momentous occasion, he was invited to host the Washington Correspondents dinner, where he admits that was when he realized that he probably watches too much MSNBC. When he met President George W. Bush backstage before the dinner, he was expecting a “drooling moron.” Instead, he found Bush affable and chatty. Fergusun’s memoir is a delicious read, especially if you like his brand of humor, which I do. He admits to his drinking and drug problems, attempted suicide stopped only by the offer of another drink, and voices his opinion on a wide variety of topics, like why he avoids strip clubs: “If I was inclined to seek the company of a bunch of angry drunk women who hated me, wanted all my money, and were determined to tease me but not have sex with me, I would just open a bar in Edinburgh.” A comfortable, funny and patriotic read. 10/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nANIMAL, VEGETABLE, MIRACLE: A Year of Food Life by Barbara Kingsolver, Camille Kingsolver, and Steven L. Hopp: Kingsolver has been an advocate of eating locally grown food for some time, and was able to put her beliefs into practice when she moved to a farm in Virginia. She spent a year eating only the foods they grew on her farm or that were grown in a hundred mile radius as much as possible, and wrote this fascinating book about that experience. Her husband, Steven Hopp, and daughter Camille also contributed. When people ask if she didn’t get tired of eating the same things all the time, Kingsolver gently points out that every month grows a new menu. They weren’t sure if their pantry would get them through the winter, but it did, although March was a tough month. My favorite part of the book was about the turkeys they raised. Apparently turkeys have been artificially inseminated for decades, but these turkeys were being raised by hand and Kingsolver wanted them to reproduce the old fashioned way. She finally found some information on turkey breeding au natural in an antique farming book, and her female turkeys soon gave up coming on to Steven and instead set their sights on the Tom turkey. What I liked about this book was Kingsolver’s tone; on rare occasion almost preachy, but for the most part just passionate, informative and often funny. Anyone with an interest in how and why we eat what we do should take a look at this book, which was most reminiscent of The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals by Michael Pollan. There’s also a website with lots of pictures and recipes: http://www.animalvegetablemiracle.com/ 06/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE ART OF EATING IN by Cathy Erway: Foodies and fans of Cathy Erway’s Not Eating Out in New York blog will enjoy this companion book to her not eating out efforts that began in 2006. At 26, Erway, like so many of us, realized that her income could not support her eating out habits. Instead, she would use her love of food and cooking to prepare inventive and usually cost-efficient meals in her own kitchen. For two years, she followed a strict regimen of not eating out and discovered some interesting things about herself and New York food movements, blogging about it all the while. The Art of Eating In is a sort of behind the scenes look at those two years; a foodie memoir and a look at the New York food scene from another perspective. Erway’s story makes for some pretty entertaining and inspiring reading—you’d be hard-pressed not to want to try No Knead Bread or some of the other dishes she talks about in her book. I won’t be embracing all of Erway’s experiments in food, menudo as a hangover cure and the more out there underground food movements being a few, but I enjoyed reading about her forays into the various ins and outs of not eating out in the big city. 03/10 Becky Lejeune\n\nART OF THE CHOPPER by Tom Zimberoff: Motorcycles have always been hot and TV shows like American Chopper have revved up the heat even more. Tom Zimberoff is a photographer who is best known for his shots of rock ‘n roll stars like the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and many others. But he’s turned his lens to one-of-a-kind bikes and these pictures are just incredible. This is a beautiful coffee table book, high quality paper and gorgeous photos of the motorcycle as art. Put this on the top of your gift list for any chopper fan. 09/05\n\nASIAN DINING RULES: Essential Strategies for Eating Out at Japanese, Chinese, Southeast Asian, Korean, and Indian Restaurants by Steven A. Shaw: Steven Shaw is a New York Jew, which automatically makes him something of an expert on Chinese food at least. He’s also a serious foodie and a restaurant critic, and has crisscrossed the continent in search of the best in Asian food. He shares what he learns in this eminently readable and educational guide to Asian dining. He espouses befriending the sushi chef, and actually making yourself a regular at most restaurants to get the best food and best dining experience for the buck. He carefully explains the confusing items on various Asian menus, and tips us to always ask for all the menus, especially at Chinese restaurants. Apparently there often is a menu for tourists, i.e. Caucasians, and another, better menu for Chinese. He warns Japanese-Americans not to attempt to speak Japanese at a sushi bar unless you are fluent among other helpful hints. He also includes some history about the various Asian cuisines, how they came to America and why, as well as why some have not, like Filipino restaurants, despite there being more Filipinos in this country than almost any other Asian immigrants or descendents. A fascinating and fun read, especially if you love Asian cuisine or are at least curious about it. 11/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAN ATHEIST IN THE FOXHOLE: A Liberal’s Eight-Year Odyssey Inside the Heart of the Right-Wing Media by Joe Muto: Let’s start this by saying I am not a fan of Fox news and that I watch MSNBC regularly, so this book seemed right in my wheelhouse. I wasn’t really planning on reading it, just wanted to take a look at it, maybe skim a bit. I started at the beginning and that was it, I was hooked. Muto was fired from Fox because he was a mole, leaking Fox-damaging video to Gawker. But he’s also a good writer, and the conversational tone he uses is captivating, rather like hanging out in a bar with a friend and hearing his great story about how he was fired from this job that he both loved and hated. He gets in plenty of shots at Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly, and the rest of the Fox gang but also points out their good points; well, at least O’Reilly’s good points. He has a grudging respect for O’Reilly, claiming that if anyone at Fox news is “fair and balanced,” Bill comes closest, at least for a guy who is basically conservative. Most shocking revelation of the book was that Ann Coulter is a nice person when not on camera making her bizarre accusations and crazy statements of “fact,” a ploy she uses, quite successfully, to get her books on the bestseller lists. All in all, it was a very interesting book about how a show is produced at Fox news with some good gossip thrown in. This was fast reading, and a lot of fun. 7/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAUDITION by Barbara Walters: I’m not usually celebrity happy, but I doubt you’d find any woman of my generation that doesn’t have at least a passing curiosity and some respect for this woman who has broken more glass ceilings than just about anyone in television. Walters has led, some would say, a charmed life, and in this memoir, she shares some of the bad along with the spectacular good to help put her life into a more realistic vision for her fans. It is remarkably readable, especially considering it is a doorstopper of a book with very few pictures, but let’s face it, the woman has lots to talk about. Besides her own history, she made history with her interviews of most of the world leaders of the 20th & 21st centuries, not to mention her popular celebrity interviews. A surprising fast, fascinating read. 06/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBAD DOGS HAVE MORE FUN: Selected Writings on Family, Animals, and Life by John Grogan for The Philadelphia Inquirer by John Grogan: This follow up to the phenomenon known as Marley & Me seeks to capitalize on that success with this collection of Grogan’s columns that have run in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Some are sweet, some are funny, some are sad, and all will tug at the heartstrings and are worthwhile reading, but the magic of Marley & Me is missing here. 01/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBEATEN, SEARED AND SAUCED: ON BECOMING A CHEF AT THE CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA by Jonathan Dixon: As an avid fan of Top Chef and the Food Network, I’ve always been curious about the process chefs go through to get where they are. Not all chefs go to cooking school, but the CIA has its fair share of superstar chef graduates. Their alumni include some of the most recognizable names in food world, including Duff Goldman, John Besh, Cat Cora, Anne Burrell, Sara Moulton, and Scott Conant. But it was Michael Ruhlman, I think, that was the influence here. Ruhlman is called an “honorary” graduate of the CIA because he stayed long enough to write his engaging book, The Making of a Chef: Mastering Heat at the Culinary Institute of America, which frankly, is the better book. But Dixon’s experience was different because although he says he really did want to cook, he is a writer and this book is the dish he’s chosen to serve. It’s an exhausting, difficult process and I’m sure the dropout rate is high. The final course is on wine, and included an 800 page textbook that the students were basically supposed to not only memorize, but then apply during blind tastings. Don’t be expecting any recipes here, although there are a few tips sprinkled throughout the book. It is an interesting book for foodies, and a must read for anyone contemplating cooking school. 06/11 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBEHIND THE MYSTERY: TOP MYSTERY WRITERS INTERVIEWED by Stuart M. Kaminsky, photographs by Laurie Roberts: A must have for any mystery lover, this is a fascinating picture book of interviews with many of today’s most popular authors. The list is memorable and includes: Lawrence Block, James Lee Burke, Michael Connelly, Sue Grafton, Tony Hillerman, the late Evan Hunter, John Jakes, Faye and Jonathan Kellerman, Elmore Leonard, Sara Paretsky, Robert B. Parker, Ann Rule, Lisa Scottoline, Martin Cruz Smith, Mickey Spillane, Joseph Wambaugh, and Donald Westlake. The interviews are interesting and personal, as are the candid photographs; they are taken at either the authors’ homes or Kaminsky’s home. The authors featured are all friends with Kaminsky, lending an insiders’ glimpse into the lives of those more mysterious to readers than the fictional worlds they create. My only complaint: a book like this should have been printed on better paper. The quality is acceptable but this is a very special book and deserved more. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBIKER’S HANDBOOK: BECOMING PART OF THE MOTORCYCLE CULTURE by Jay Barbieri: Barbieri is the TV producer of American Thunder on the SPEED channel, which I’ve never seen as I don’t think I get that channel. But I did like this book which is light, fun, and full of pictures as well as information. Helpful hints abound like if you have to fly to a bike rally and ship your bike, never admit it. Jay tells you what you need to pack for road trips and how to load a bike, offers some of his favorite places to ride (the Badlands among others) along with lots of great stories about all aspects of biking including Daytona Bike Week and why you should never, ever refer to motorcycle clubs as “gangs.” It is a great gift for the biker in your life – but only if they love Harleys. 11/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBILLY COLLINS LIVE: A Performance at the Peter Norton Symphony Space by Billy Collins: I love poetry. And Billy Collins, former U.S. Poet Laureate, is one of my favorites, especially when he is doing the reading. This book on CD is almost as good as attending a reading. Introduced by Bill Murray, Collins reads some new and some old favorites, then takes some questions from the audience. My 13 year old daughter, who delights in torturing me by telling me how much she hates poetry, became a captive prisoner in the back seat of my car on her rides to and from school while I played this CD. The first poem she heard was “The Lanyard”, a sweet, nostalgic and laugh out loud funny poem about that childhood arts & crafts artifact. Collins talks about how he made his mother a lanyard at camp and how that evened the playing field between them:\n\n“Here are thousands of meals” she said,\n\n“and here is clothing and a good education.”\n\n“And here is your lanyard,” I replied,\n\n“which I made with a little help from a counselor.”\n\nCollins has made a poetry lover out of my daughter. What more of a recommendation could anyone hope for? 09/05 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBILLY JOEL: The Life & Times of an Angry Young Man by Hank Bordowitz: As a long time fan of Billy Joel, I really enjoyed this bio of the boy from Long Island who made good. But if I wasn’t a fan, as an objective book reviewer I would have to say that it left much to be desired. There wasn’t really anything new here, most of the anecdotes were gleaned from newspaper & magazine accounts and interviews with some old friends, but it seemed like I heard most of it before, and it was also fairly repetitious. Even the pictures were a bit of a disappointment, again there was nothing new there but I guess all that was to be expected as this book did not have the cooperation of its subject. In fact, Joel wasn’t even interviewed. I appreciated reading about the history of the some of the songs – who they were written for, the hows & whys were fascinating. But the book focuses most closely on his early life and the past ten years are so are just rushed through. A good book for any Billy Joel fan, but probably not so good for anyone else. 11/05 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBITCHFEST edited by Lisa Jervis & Andi Zeisler: Ten Years of Cultural Criticism from the Pages of Bitch Magazine: I’m not sure why, but I am fascinated by all things called “Bitch”. I recently tried an Australian wine with a lovely, pale pink label with the word “Bitch” embossed in a fancy script. The back label was even more extraordinary – it basically has the word “bitch” repeated for several rows before advising that life’s a bitch then you drink some more. And the wine – a lovely Grenache – was surprisingly good. So when I heard there was a forthcoming book called Bitchfest, well, I simply had to read it. It’s a terrific collection of essays on a variety of subjects from “Hitting Puberty” to “The F Word” to “Beauty Myths and Body Projects” to “Talking Back: Activism and Pop Culture.” While there are several writers represented, the viewpoint is pro-feminist and outspoken. A few of the pieces really struck a chord with me and were especially memorable: “I Kissed a Girl: The Evolution of the Prime-Time Lesbian Clinch” by Diane Anderson; “Teen Mean Fighting Machine: Why does the Media Love Mean Girls” by Gabrille Moss; “Double Life: Everyone Wants to See Your Breasts – Until Your Baby Needs Them: by Lisa Moricoli Latham and how can you not love a piece entitled, “Plastic Passion: Tori Spelling’s Breasts and Other Results of Cosmetic Darwinism” by Andi Zeisler. Buy this book to soothe your feminist soul and share it with a friend. 09/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBlack Cloud: The Great Florida Storm of 1928 by Eliot Kleinberg: I recently had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Kleinberg speak about his new book at Borders. It was standing room only and with good reason – this is a fascinating story and Kleinberg is a hell of a storyteller. I immediately went home and started reading, and couldn’t stop until I turned the last page. This unnamed hurricane is the second worst natural disaster in American history, after the Galveston hurricane (Isaac’s Storm,) yet it has been pretty much forgotten. Kleinberg, along with Robert Mykle, who wrote a book about it last year called Killer ‘Cane: The Deadly Hurricane of 1928, are determined to change that.\n\nOver 2500 lives were lost, and that is just an estimate. Black Cloud not only covers the storm, it also covers the historical significance of it. Sixty something white bodies were buried in the cemetery in West Palm Beach. Almost 700 bodies of African Americans were buried in a mass grave in a potters field that was left unmarked for 73 years. Even more disturbing was the fact that who knows how many more African American bodies were simply burned, leaving a black cloud hanging over the ‘Glades (and giving Kleinberg his title.) His research was exhaustive. There are still survivors of the storm living in the area that were available to be interviewed and their stories are simply heartbreaking. It’s a story that needed to be told, and is told well. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBLOOD, BONES AND BUTTER: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef by Gabrielle Hamilton: I listened to the audio book version, read by the author who did a fantastic job. Hamilton is not only a chef, she is a gifted writer with an M.F.A. in fiction writing to prove it. This book is her story, of growing up with a French mother and a father who took to roasting whole lambs at their back yard barbeques. When they split up, Gabrielle was set adrift and ended up working in restaurants, lying about her age. She got into drugs, embezzlement and a host of other decidedly un-chef-life behaviors that make for a fabulous, fascinating story. She ended up with an Italian husband and her own restaurant, Prune, in New York City, where people wait for hours every Sunday for her brunch and quietly make fun of the readers who now flock to their neighborhood mecca. I have reservations for later this month. 7/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBLOOD, BONES AND BUTTER: THE INADVERTENT EDUCATION OF A RELUCTANT CHEF by Gabrielle Hamilton: Within just a few lines of beginning Gabrielle Hamilton’s Blood, Bones and Butter, her intense passion for cooking becomes very clear. Her journey to becoming chef and owner of New York’s Prune restaurant began when she was just a child. Memories of her mother’s pantry, the butcher shop, the dairy, and the apple orchards as well as the dishes prepared with the many ingredients from these places make up just the first portion of the book. After her parents’ divorce, Hamilton’s first jobs were in restaurants. Though becoming a chef never seemed to be at the forefront of her plans for her future, it is nonetheless the life she returned to over and over again. Hamilton’s unique voice and eloquent style are completely engaging and it comes as no surprise that she also has a very strong love of the written word and a talent for writing that must be as great as her talent in the kitchen. Praised by the likes of Anthony Bourdain, Hamilton’s memoir definitely lives up to the hype. 03/11 Becky Lejeune\n\nBORDER FILM PROJECT: Photos by Migrants & Minutemen on the U.S. Mexico Border by Rudy Adler, Victoria Criado, Brett Honeycutt: “It’s hard to know what it’s like to cross the border because no one’s ever really visually documented the experience—until now” -Steve Hartman, CBS News Correspondent\n\nAt this very moment, the United States-Mexico border is a powder keg. On one side, impoverished people hampered by severe unemployment are preparing to sneak in to America. On the other side, a heavily-armed, vigilante group (Minutemen) are patrolling the border to keep the migrants at bay. Meanwhile, legislators on Capital Hill are debating the relative merits/drawbacks of a flawed immigration bill. While there is no quick and easy solution to this problem, The Border Film Project provides a fleeting glimpse of what it life is like for these disparate groups of people.\n\nThe Border Film Project has no agenda and takes no political position. Instead, it tries to put a human face on the immigration dilemma through the lens of a camera. As part of a collaborative art project, disposable cameras were distributed to Migrants and Minutemen alike. Both groups were instructed on the use of the camera and were asked to take random photos of a typical day. They were also given pre-paid envelopes for returning the cardboard cameras. As an incentive, the Migrants were given Wal-Mart gift cards and the Minutemen were provided Shell Oil gift cards. Seventy-three cameras were returned with over 2,000 photographs. The resulting images are nothing short of astonishing.\n\nThe book has minimal text except for background information on the project. It does include an occasional footnote that was provided with a camera’s return. Otherwise, the photographs themselves tell the entire story. Or, at least, the visual story of seventy-three individuals. The images appear as if they were taken by professional photographers; some are artfully composed, some are purposefully blurred, some are classical examples of portraiture. Each photo is powerful in its own way.\n\nThe greatest strength of The Border Film Project is its compassion. Migrants and Minutemen are all human beings. As such, both groups are treated with dignity and respect. Without a preconceived notion on the issue of immigration, it would be impossible to determine who is “good” and who is “bad” based on the book’s structure. What does become clear is that the current border policy is broken and badly needs repair.\n\nCheck out the interactive, online version of The Border Film Project. 06/07 Dan Cawley\n\nBORN ON A BLUE DAY: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Austic Savant by Daniel Tammet: This memoir has a most unique voice in Daniel Tammet, one of only 50 people in the world who has both autism and synesthesia. Tammet has Aspergers syndrome, a high functioning form of autism. Synesthesia is neurological in origin and allows him to see numbers and words as colors and shapes; hence, born on a “blue” day literally means that the particular date of his birth he sees as blue. Synesthesia is an exceedingly rare occurrence, especially in combination with autism. Tammet knows he is different from a young age, but it doesn’t bother him, even when other kids make fun of him. He is able to withdraw into his own world and leave the outer world behind. He is high functioning as he can move in society without too much trouble. And as he grows up, he discovers he is also gay.\n\nWhile Tammet is extraordinarily good in math, especially his ability to express prime numbers, and he set a European record for reciting as many digits as he could of pi. It took him five hours and nine minutes to recite 22,514 digits of pi without error. But his real gift is that he has an uncanny ability to quickly learn new languages and become fluent in them in a very short time. The BBC offered him the opportunity to learn a new language in front of cameras in one week. They asked him to learn Icelandic, gave him some study materials and took him to Iceland for 4 days. At the end of the week, he was interviewed on a live Icelandic talk show entirely in Icelandic for two hours. The Brainman documentary also brought him to the attention of US television, and he appeared on David Letterman.\n\nI found this book difficult to read at times, and found myself skimming a lot of it. There are pages and pages of mathematical figures and such and frankly, I am no savant. But it was a very interesting story for sure and I can see why it is so popular with book groups. 10/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBORN ROUND: The Secret History of a Full-time Eater by Frank Bruni: I loved Ruth Reichl’s account of being the restaurant reviewer for the New York Times in her fascinating, fabulous memoir, Garlic and Sapphires. She retired and was succeeded by William Grimes, and when he left Frank Bruni got the coveted position. My mistake was assuming that Bruni’s memoir would similar to Reichl’s; to me a “full-time eater” was a reference to his job eating at and reviewing restaurants. I know that one should never assume anything, but I did, so this book was a bit of a disappointment to me. Bruni wrote a memoir, mostly about his eating disorders, how he overcame them, and being gay, and as an afterthought, his stint as food critic for the Times. I liked the last eighty pages or so, the rest I could have lived without. I am not a big fan of memoirs dealing with addictions, be they drugs, alcohol, food, or sex, so this book just didn’t work for me. 11/09 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBOSSYPANTS by Tina Fey: Another semester has come to an end, and I celebrated by reading this hilarious memoir. Tina Fey discusses a bit of her childhood and how she got that scar, her Republican parents, her husband Jeff (and a few aliases she assigns him,) motherhood, her daughter, her beginnings at Second City all the way through the Sarah Palin days at SNL and 30 Rock. I had already figured out that Tina Fey is brilliant, but I also learned that she is unusually loyal to her friends and colleagues, and while she takes her success seriously, like most working moms she struggles with balancing it all and not feeling guilty. But mostly this book is laugh out loud funny, and whoever was nearby while I was reading it, promptly went out and got their own copy. Take a break from all the insanity that is our world today, and indulge your funny bone with this great escape. 05/11 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nBreaking Clean by Judy Blunt, Knopf: This is the best memoir I have read in a long time. Just go out and buy it. You will find yourself drawn in immediately and you will not be able to put it down. Blunt is now a hero of mine and she will be a hero of yours. Remember how much you loved ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTIN’? How it took you to a part of the country in contemporary times and to a way of life you barely knew existed? How it plunked you down and opened your eyes? How you came to love it? This is similar to the experience of BREAKING CLEAN. But it’s cold and barren and isolated. It’s northeastern Montana and the challenges to live here are dangerous and frightenening. And if you don’t fill with tears in the chapter called Winter Kill I can’t imagine what is wrong with you! There are a million wonderful quotes hailing all aspects of this book – – but from me let me say I know it’s a book you should read and share with friends – – especially young women.\n\nPS: If Judy Blunt wanted to write a shopping list I’d be pleased to read it. ~This review contributed by Ann Nappa\n\nCharlie Wilson’s War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History by George Crile: This is the fascinating story of how Charlie Wilson, a hard-partying Congressman from Texas, undertook a personal mission to assist the mujahideen rebels of Afghanistan to defeat the forces of the Soviet Union. The consequences of this have shaped our times. On the one hand, this greatly accelerated the downfall of the Soviet Union as a superpower and on the other hand, it left billions of dollars worth of high tech munitions in the caves and on the plains of Afghanistan which we would later come to regret. So this is a story worth hearing.\n\nAnd a fine story it is. With rich characters, not only Charlie himself, but also a rogue CIA agent on the outs with the “old school” boys of the CIA and a military genius who figured out the appropriate “arms mix” to insure victory and then faded from view because he had no more worlds to conquer.\n\nThe process revealed in the telling is just as fascinating as the characters. How Charlie was able to work effectively behind the scenes in Congress, forging an incredibly powerful network of allies from both parties and from all regions of the political spectrum. For example, his years in the Texas legislature sitting next to Barbara Jordan gave him an entree to and credibility with the Black Caucus in Congress. And all of this was accomplished at a time when the CIA was under fire at the White House and in Congress. And while dating a variety of gorgeous women and doing serious damage to his liver.\n\nMany years ago, I had a history test on which the only question was – Do leaders shape events, or do events shape leaders? This is the riveting story about one man who most certainly shaped some of the most important events of our time. With repercussions that perhaps are still yet to come. ~This review contributed by Geoffrey R. Hamlin.\n\nTHE COLDEST WINTER: AMERICA AND THE KOREAN WAR by David Halberstam: On June 25, 1950, seven divisions of elite North Korean troops crossed the border into South Korea with the intention of gaining control of the entire Korean peninsula in three weeks. Sixteen years later on June 25, 1966, I got married and in the fourth year of my marriage was sent to the DMZ in Korea, where the “three week war” was still being contested. While not likely to garner the publicity of his defining book for the Vietnam War, The Best and the Brightest, Halberstam’s treatment of the Korean War, written three decades after it began is arguably his best effort ever. Halberstam himself considered The Coldest Winter the best book he ever wrote, the culmination of forty-five years of writing about America’s postwar foreign policy. In the book, he provides astonishingly vivid and nuanced portraits of all the major figures — Eisenhower, Truman, Acheson, Kim, and Mao, and Generals MacArthur, Almond, and Ridgway, while also giving us tightly crafted narrative journalism, chronicling the stories of individual soldiers on the front line and the challenges they faced. It was for me a disturbing but uplifting read. 02/08 Jack Quick\n\nConfessions of a Tax Collector: One Man’s Tour of Duty Inside the IRS by Richard Yancey: Richard Yancey was a failure. He had numerous, low paying jobs over many years and was living with a woman who had inherited wealth – she was supporting him, and rubbing his face in it. He was a very successful student, however, and when he finds a blind ad in the paper looking for someone with his impeccable grades, he decides to investigate. Turns out to be a job as a revenue collector with the Internal Revenue Service, and thus begins Yancey’s engrossing tale of life with the IRS. This is the stuff of nightmares; he seizes people’s homes, cars, businesses, basically destroys lives, but he’s very, very good at it. Yancey worked for the IRS for twelve years while secretly longing to be a writer, and this is his compelling story. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nCONSIDER THE FORK by Bee Wilson: I loved this book about how we eat and how we cook. Wilson delves into the history of knives, chopsticks, fire, ice & refrigeration, food processors, sous vide machines and of course, the fork, and lots more. Her writing style is conversational rather than instructional, making this an incredibly interesting and easy read. I found myself surprised constantly, from learning that the processing involved in turning sugar into the product we find on supermarket shelves is extremely labor intensive to finding a 1940’s precisely designed ergonomic kitchen. The knife favored by Asian chefs works perfectly well with the eating implements, chopsticks, that they use while the Italians dreamed up the fork for obvious pasta-twirling reasons. I learned why restaurant kitchens call their broiler a salamander and why I’m not the only one who loves wooden spoons, my Cuisinart and my immersion blender. This is fascinating reading for anyone who cooks, or eats. I loved this book. 3/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nCRASHING THROUGH by Robert Kurson: Bob Lujano is a staff member at the Lakeshore Foundation in Birmingham, Alabama where I work out. In 1979, Bob lost his arms above the elbow and his legs at the hips to a rare form of meningitis. Yes, he is in a wheelchair but he isn’t disabled. Try to keep up with him in the swimming pool, or on the track. Don’t even think of taking him on in wheelchair rugby as he has won 5 US Quad Rugby National Championships with the Lakeshore Demolition and 3 medals playing rugby for Team USA. He was one of the stars of the 2005 movie about the sport titled Murderball. Mike May is a similar remarkable person. Blinded in a childhood accident, he learned to drive a motorcycle, hike alone in the woods, and downhill ski, while also working as the CIA’s first blind intelligence analyst as well as being a successful inventor, entrepreneur and family man. While no one has yet been able to replace Bob’s missing limbs, Mike was able to have his eyesight restored at age 46. This book tells the story, with all its ups and downs of what happened to this remarkable man whose brain had forgotten how to process visual input. Whatever problems we think we have pale in the face of the accomplishments of people like these. If you don’t get goose bumps from this book, have your pulse checked by a professional. 08/07 Jack Quick\n\nCREDIT REPAIR by Robin Leonard & Margaret Reiter: This 10th edition is so far superior to the 9th edition (2009) as to render the previous version almost obsolete. The chapters have been reorganized into a more logical sequence. Chapters have been added that deal with “hot topics” including short sales and reverse mortgages; money raising options including Craigslist and Amazon; the new Credit Card ACT and how it impacts borrowers; and identity theft prevention. The authors have clarified their recommended action steps to build a positive credit history. Throughout the text additional resources are noted. Many of the recommended resources cost no money. The authors recommend obtaining some of the books and Consumer Reports magazines via a local library. The accompanying CD contains all forms referenced in the text. As always with Nolo publishers, free legal updates are available on their website. 08/11 Kimberly Bower Note from the BookBitch: If you need more help with credit repair, try Sky Blue Credit\n\nCURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM by Deirdre Dolan: I am a huge fan of the show, so I was really excited to get this book and it exceeded my expectations – and how often do you get to say that? It basically covers the show through its star, Larry David, from his stand-up days through Seinfeld through Curb. It runs through a season-by-season episode guide from day one through season five, but so much more than that. I really enjoyed the interviews with David and his co-stars and directors, and the pictures are great. Besides the obligatory candid on set shots and so forth, there is a section of pictures of artifacts from the show like Dr. Sewell’s prescription pad and the Cashews & Raisins mix that had a low count of cashews, and another section with pictures and descriptions of Larry’s various houses each season. Yes, these are people’s homes, not a stage set. A fun read with a lot of bang for the buck, and a must-have for any fan of the show. And who isn’t? 11/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE DANGEROUS BOOK FOR BOYS by Conn and Hal Iggulden: Just in time for Father’s Day, this is the perfect gift for any man who is still young at heart. The Dangerous Book is jam packed with anything and everything a guy could ever need. From instructions on knots and how to make invisible ink to advice on girls, this book has it all. Think of it as an all-encompassing boy scout manual. I wouldn’t normally review something like this. How do you really review a gift book, right? I took one look at it and had to share it. It’s a neat concept and I highly recommend buying a copy for yourself and that person that is impossible to shop for (dad.) 06/07 Becky Lejeune\n\nDECIDING THE NEXT DECIDER: The 2008 Presidential Race in Rhyme by Calvin Trillin: Is it wrong to gloat? In rhyme, no less? Not if you’ve been as disillusioned as most Democrats over the past eight years. Although to be fair, Trillin has some fun with Obama:\n\nExperience was what he seemed to lack.\n\nAnd to be frank, they pointed out, he’s black.\n\nand Biden too:\n\nJoe carries many thoughts inside his head,\n\nAnd often leaves but few of them unsaid.\n\nIt is rather amazing how Trillin captured the highlights of the election process as it was happening. If you’re going through election withdrawal, here is the perfect antidote. 12/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDepraved English by Peter Novobatzky: A reference book that charts a very specific territory. This is a collection of obscenities and obscure disgusting words. Impress your friends with words like callipygian (having nicely shaped buttocks) and mazophilous (fond of breasts). Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America by Erik Larsen: Nonfiction about the Chicago World’s Fair with a parallel story about a serial killer in the same area at the same time. This book got all sorts of accolades and I can understand why; both stories are fascinating and compelling. But I had issues with the amount of detail the author provides, especially with the World’s Fair – it felt like he had the names of every person who worked at building it. The book alternates chapters between both stories which made for a very jumpy book and forced me to try and remember who some of these people were. Too much information is not always a good thing. Includes about 40 pages of footnotes. 06/05 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDEWEY: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World by Vicki Myron & Bret Witter: This book is purported to be the Marley & Me for cat lovers. I’m not exactly sure what that means, but I think it means the publisher hopes to make as much money on this book as they did on that one. Statistically speaking, there are more cat owners in this country than dog owners, so who knows. All I can tell you is do not pick up this book without a box of tissues, it is a tear-jerker from the first chapter about finding this tiny frozen kitten in the book drop with his tiny frostbitten paws, until the end, nineteen years later when cancer got him. In between, Myron somehow convinced the library director, board, and town attorney to let her keep him in the library. Dewey became a sort of good-will director for the library, and the town. One chapter after another describes how he touched people’s lives, how wise and knowing he was, his favorite toys, food, and hiding spots, and how folks drove in to the tiny town of Spencer, Iowa, just to see this remarkable cat. The appeal to cat lovers is obvious, not to mention librarians, but beyond that, I’m not so sure. In that regard, Marley & Me seems to be much more universal in its appeal; yes it’s about a dog, but it’s more about a family and perhaps therein lies the difference. All I can say is after living with my cat, Edgar-the-psycho-kitty, this book restored my faith that there are good cats out there, and reinforced even more strongly that luck is needed in acquiring one. 09/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDISHWASHER: One Man’s Quest to Wash Dishes in All Fifty States by Pete Jordan: The unsung heroes of the food service industry are often behind the scenes. Pete Jordan was one such hero. Pete washed dishes. In his new book, Mr. Jordan recounts a decade long journey scrubbing our nation’s pots and pans. His goal was to “bust suds” in every state before turning thirty five. Along with restaurants and cafeterias, he winds up in the most unlikely of places: a fish cannery, a ski resort, a dinner train, and an oil rig.\n\nThese dishwashing jobs were left as easily as they were attained. He quit whenever he felt like not working. The longest position held was six months. The shortest, forty-five minutes. None of his employers received a two-week notice. Mr. Jordan was initially attracted to dishwashing because (1.) he was broke and (2.) jobs were plentiful. What began as a lark became a calling. From 1989-2001, he immersed himself into the profession. His accounting of being a “plongeur” is simultaneously fun and funny. Jordan makes washing dishes seem (almost) glamorous. He has a keen eye for his surroundings and a deadpan delivery.\n\nEspecially fascinating is the glimpse he provides into our restaurant subculture. Psychotic chefs, surly waitresses, and stoned busboys are all part of Jordan’s world. He dines off half-eaten plates and sneaks free drinks from the bartender. Dishwasher also provides a treasure trove of dishing history, factoids, trivia, and slang. Jordan discusses early efforts of unionizing the dish-trade. He describes ancient methods of kosher cleaning. He writes about famous celebrity dishwashers: George Orwell, Ronald Reagan, Malcolm X, Little Richard. Over the course of time, Pete Jordan emerges as an accomplished “dish-dog” and a bit of an underground phenomenon. He created a dishwashing magazine, appeared on NPR’s This American Life, and even received an invitation to the David Letterman Show. Sadly, he never accomplished his goal. After 88 restaurants in 33 states, Dishwasher Pete hung up his towel. These days, he can be found repairing bicycles in Amsterdam. 11/07 Dan Cawley\n\nDOGFIGHT: The 2012 Presidential Campaign in Verse by Calvin Trillin: This is the follow up to 2008’s DECIDING THE NEXT DECIDER: The 2008 Presidential Race in Rhyme, with an occasional “Pause for Prose.” It starts with the primaries in all their glorious insanity, including this bit about Michelle Bachman, entitled “Michele: A Serenade by Iowa Social Conservatives” (with apologies to the Beatles):\n\nMichele, our belle,\n\nThinks that gays will all be sent to hell.\n\nThat’s Michele\n\nand continues on for many more irreverent verses. Shots are taken at Obama as well, like this from “First Debate”:\n\nSo Democrats looked on with some dismay\n\n“The President,” some said, “is MIA.”\n\nIrreverence is the theme of this book, so if you haven’t recovered from the Romney debacle, or can’t stand poking fun at Obama’s second run, then steer clear. But if you want to look back and laugh, or know someone who would, this book is ideal (and perfectly sized for a stocking stuffer.) 12/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDOGTRIPPING: 25 Rescues, 11 Volunteers, and 3 RVs on Our Canine Cross-Country Adventure by David Rosenfelt: This author, who created one of my favorite mystery series featuring Andy Carpenter, and who writes superb standalone thrillers, has lent his unique voice to a memoir of sorts; the story of his move from California to Maine. As the subtitle indicates, this was no ordinary move. Carpenter fell in love with Debbie, his wife, and she is a dog lover so he became one too. To an extreme, some might say. Together they founded the Tara Foundation, a large dog rescue organization that has found homes for thousands of dogs, primarily Golden Retrievers and other large dogs. The dogs that are too old or sick to be placed really get lucky; they go home with David & Debbie. So when David & Debbie decided to move, they brought the old timers with them. It took months of preparation and some really dedicated fans to make this move and this is their story. The voice is uniquely David, so if you love his other books like I do, you will love this one too. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me think about all those dogs who aren’t lucky enough to escape the shelters. Give this book to every dog lover in your life and they will thank you. 8/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDON’T GO TO THE COSMETICS COUNTER WITHOUT ME by Paula Begoun: This is the newest, 2012 edition of this very popular book. Begouin analyzes makeup and skin care products and gives a Consumer Reports type rating to them. When it first came out in 1992, it was truly groundbreaking but now I have some issues, chief of which is Begouin now has her own skincare and makeup line which amazingly scores in the “best” rankings for every product. Her products may very well be fantastic, but it does make the rest of her ratings somewhat suspect as bias is now firmly in place. I was also surprised that some brands were completely overlooked; I would have liked to see how Costco’s marriage with Borghese cosmetics stacked up as well as a newcomer (to me, at least,) Ulta and their line of products. But beyond these critiques, I don’t see the point of buying this book. All the information is readily available on the author’s website, which she advises us is http://www.cosmeticscop.com but which miraculously, automatically turns into http://www.paulaschoice.com/ online. Not to mention this book is a doorstopper; at 950 pages, no one is schlepping this book anywhere, never mind to the cosmetics counter. Save your money, borrow from your library or check out the products that interest you online. 4/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDON’T SING AT THE TABLE: Life Lessons From My Grandmothers by Adriana Trigiani: I must confess that Trigiani is one of my favorite authors and I’d read her grocery lists if they were published. This book is her second foray into nonfiction, several years after Cooking with My Sisters: One Hundred Years of Family Recipes, from Bari to Big Stone Gap, and this is another gem. All of Trigiani’s novels are about families, usually big, Italian families, and in this new book we learn where all that inspiration came from. Even their names will be familiar to fans – Lucia, better known as Lucy, and Yolanda, who morphed into Viola. These are strong women who taught their families, especially their daughters and granddaughters, all about life and how to deal with it. Filled with humor and pathos, this book is a joy to read. As the holidays approach, or maybe even encroach on our busy lives, do yourself a favor and take a little time to savor this book. Then wrap it up nicely and give it to your favorite female relative or girlfriend. 12/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nDRIFT: The Unmooring of American Military Power by Rachel Maddow: I wasn’t sure what to expect but I am such a huge Maddow fan that if she published her grocery list I’d read it. Happily, this is no grocery list. It is a thought provoking look at the United States and how and why we go to war. I learned a lot about our history, the constitution and the legalities of war, and how various presidents and Congress manage to manipulate all that. I watch her show and have seen her interviewed so I know how brilliant she is, but this is no paean to intellectualism or even a platform for some political agenda; instead it is an eminently readable, educational yet entertaining book – not an easy feat. This is one impressive debut. 4/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nEARLY BIRD: A Memoir of Premature Retirement by Rodney Rothman: Rothman was 28 years old when he lost his job as a comedy writer on a sitcom produced by David Letterman. Since he was a New York Jew, he decided he would ultimately end up retiring to South Florida, so he got the idea of getting an early taste of what that would be like. He sublet a room from an old woman in Century Village in Boca Raton, Florida and moved in for six months of shuffleboard, cruising with the Red Hat Club, and the ubiquitous Early Bird dinners. Rothman also includes some interesting history on how Florida became the Mecca of retirement and portraits of many of the residents of the retirement community and what their lives are like. Lots of laughs amid the tedium and of certain interest to anyone who is thinking about retirement or knows anyone who has retired to South Florida. 07/05 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nEARTH (THE BOOK): A VISITORS GUIDE TO THE HUMAN RACE presented by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart: The latest “textbook” from Jon Stewart certainly lives up to its predecessor, America. Obviously, Stewart has expanded his horizons. The idea behind this book appears to be that there are no humans left on Earth, and the aliens have arrived seeking archeological information about this uninhabited planet. Earth attempts to explain our lives and how we live them by exploring science, religion, society, the life cycle, culture and certainly pop culture. In the “Life” chapter, evolution is explained, including this on adaptation: “Crustaceans like this lobster evolved strong claws that protected them from predators, but proved no match for rubber bands.” Samantha Bee demonstrates facial expressions that show our various emotions from joy and fear to jealousy and boredom. Each chapter includes FAQ’s, which in this book means, “Future Alien Questions” like, “Q: Was it better to be a man or a woman? A: A man.” One of my favorite pages was in the culture section on – what else – books, and included this: “Harry Potter was a boy wizard whose adventures were so popular they caused massive deforestation leading to a 1-degree rise in global temperature.” And this: “Oh, I see you noticed Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow on our shelf. Yeah, we totally read it all the way through…” Great fun and probably one of the best textbooks out there. FYI: Lots of full frontal nudity, including a very scary picture of Larry King. 10/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nEAT ME: THE FOOD AND PHILOSOPHY OF KENNY SHOPSIN by Kenny Shopsin & Carolynn Carreño: Kenny Shospin’s restaurant is one that I’m sure many New Yorkers are familiar with. With his notorious attitude towards media, health inspectors, and even potential clientele, Shopsin is likened to the Seinfeld Soup Nazi. Some even believe the infamous character may be based on him, but we’re likely never to know for sure. In Eat Me, Shopsin abandons his “no media” rule and shares over 100 of his delectable creations with the public. This is the perfect cookbook for foodies like myself who are likely never to be able to experience these items first hand. From a simple egg salad to Shopsins’ famous Yin-Yang Rice Bowls – meant to be paired with soup – this collection of inventive dishes is sure to tantalize your taste buds. In addition to the recipes, the book also features Shopsin’s own anecdotes about everything from his family and loyal customers to his views on pancakes and salads. The book also features the once 6-page menu, great for help in creating your own Shopsin’s dinner at home. 01/09 Becky Lejeune\n\nEAT THIS, NOT THAT: Thousands of Simple Food Swaps That Can Save You 10, 20, 30 Pounds-or More! by David Zinczenko and Matt Goulding: Buy this as a present for yourself, but if you can’t get to it during the holidays, don’t worry. I’m thinking New Year’s Day is a good day to start reading it; you can always start with the page devoted to hangovers. But most of the other pages in the book will apply to every busy person. The editors of Men’s Health Magazine have gone out and gotten nutritional information on some of the most popular restaurant food, including fast food like Wendy’s and McDonalds, not-quite-as-fast food like Boston Market and Chipotle, and even sit down restaurants like Chili’s and Red Lobster. Then they give us a page by page, side by side comparison of what to eat: “eat this” and “not that”. I saw one of the authors on the Today Show and was so shocked by what he was showing, I immediately ordered the book.\n\nThe premise is that people eat out, a lot. And they make food choices based on what they perceive to be the healthiest, low calorie choices, with an occasional indulgence. But menu items with such healthy, low calorie sounding names like the Turkey Burger from Ruby Tuesday pack in an astonishing 1171 calories and 58 grams of fat, the 3 Piece Dark Rotisserie Chicken with sweet potato casserole and the Market Chopped Side Salad from Boston Market serve you up 1410 calories, 80 grams of fat and a whopping 3020 milligrams of sodium, and the Chicken Burrito from Chipotle gives you a hefty 1169 calories, 47 grams of fat, and 2856 milligrams of sodium. Instead, the authors suggest you order Ruby Tuesday’s 7 oz. Top Sirloin with green beans and baby portabella mushrooms for a mere 464 calories, Boston Market’s Roasted Sirloin with garlic dill potatoes and spinach for a much more reasonable 580 calories, and Chipotle’s Chicken Burrito Bowl sans rice and tortilla for a much healthier 489 calories.\n\nThe authors also point out some startling realities of fine dining, explaining the caloric and fat traps of menu items at steakhouses – porterhouse for two is usually enough meat for four, with everyone getting a complete day’s worth of saturated fat; sushi bars – soy sauce has over 1800 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon, and avoid the croquetas at tapas bar – “think fat bomb.” Just to keep it real, they also includes pages of comparisons between the foods we eat everyday, breakfast cereal, salad dressings, even cookies – Fig Newtons good, Pepperidge Farm Soft Baked bad, and ice cream – Breyer’s All Natural Vanilla Fudge Twirl good, Haagen Dazs Vanilla Fudge bad. Actually, even the Haagen Dazs sorbet is bad.\n\nObviously I think this book has an important message. It’s very visual with page after page of photographs of the foods we love to eat, but don’t love us back. It’s eye opening, enlightening and a bit frightening, but should be read by anyone who orders food through a drive through window or isn’t cooking every meal themselves. 12/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nAN EDGE IN THE KITCHEN: The Ultimate Guide to Kitchen Knives — How to Buy Them, Keep Them Razor Sharp, and Use Them Like a Pro by Chad Ward: I love to cook almost as much as I love to read, so it really isn’t a big surprise that I would enjoy a book about knives – the good, the bad, and the super-expensive. This is probably the definitive book on knives: what to buy and why, where to buy, and how to buy them. And once you’ve procured your knives, how to use them properly, and most of important of all, how to take care of them. Ward is a funny guy, he knows he’s a bit knife-obsessed and doesn’t look down upon anyone who isn’t. This is a very practical guide as well, he not only doesn’t push the custom made, multiple thousands of dollars knife, he recommends knives in every price range. He can get you going with the basics for under a $100, and I never would have even thought that possible. Want to spend more? No problem, he’ll help you there too. If you’re shopping for your favorite foodie or newlywed couple, this excellent resource is your guide to buying the best knife at any price. 8/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE ELEMENTS OF COOKING: Translating the Chef’s Craft for Every Kitchen by Michael Ruhlman: I love books about food, and this is a really good one. So good, in fact, that after I borrowed a copy from the library to read, I went out and bought my own copy. This collection of essays is a a sort of primer for the home chef, and includes a fabulous section on something as basic as stock – not only does it come in cans & boxes at your local grocery store, you can easily make it at home. Many of those French cooking terms are explained in plain English, and I especially loved his advice on what to purchase for a new kitchen – he reminds us that if you look in most restaurant kitchens, especially those of top rated chefs, you will see some of the oldest, grungiest beat-up looking pots and pans, despite their celebrity lines available at your local Bed, Bath & Beyond, which Ruhlman deems overpriced and unnecessary. He suggests finding your local restaurant supply company, and gives specific suggestions as to what to look for and pricing. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book. All in all, an excellent primer for the new cook and an interesting read for the more experienced one. 04/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nEVERYTHING IS MISCELLANEOUS: The Power of the New Digital Disorder by David Weinberger: People like to ask me about books – I’ve been asked to name my favorite books, the books I would take to a desert island, and the books that have changed my life. My favorites change from year to year, I would need an entire cruise ship to fill with enough books to sustain me on a desert island, and while books in general have changed my life, I’ve never had any sort of epiphany while reading, at least not that I can recall. Until now. Reading Everything is Miscellaneous gave me my moment. It was a “EUREKA” moment, rather like that lovely story about Archimedes in the bathtub. Lest you think I’ve completely taken leave of my senses, let me get down to it.\n\nThis is a book about many things, but what I am focusing on here is organization. Specifically, the organization of books, in a library. 95% of all public libraries use the Dewey Decimal System, which has worked reasonably well for quite a long while. Other libraries use a different classification system culled from the Library of Congress, while bookstores tend to use something called BISAC, the Book Industry Standards and Communications. But what Mr. Weinberger wonders is this: if we have computers and are using them, why are we limiting ourselves to such specifics? And it made me wonder too. Yes, books need a specific place on the shelf, but we can look for books, search for books, in other ways that have nothing to do with the physical location of the book, but rather with the need of the reader.\n\nBut that’s only a small part of this fascinating book. Weinberger examines how Google has changed our lives, the wonder of Wikipedia, looks at the business model of the digital music industry and what it portends for the future of all businesses, and even why Staples is so successful. I read this book several months ago, and have just reread it, and I may have to read it yet again. 12/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nThe Exact Same Moon by Jeanne Marie Laskas: This is the marvelous sequel to Fifty Acres and a Poodle, where Jeanne marries Alex, they buy a farm, and live happily ever after…until this new book comes along. Jeanne’s mother becomes paralyzed from Guillain-Barré Syndrome, and Jeanne finds herself commuting back to the city to help out. Sometimes it takes a crisis to force people to examine their lives, and this one causes Jeanne to rethink her decision not to have children. Alex, with two grown children from his first marriage, is supportive and open to anything she wants. Jeanne explores her relationship with her mother, her husband, and her own desire to become a mother in this tender, funny, heart-wrenching-yet-heart-warming story. Lest this sounds maudlin, it is not – there are laugh out loud moments sprinkled throughout, from befriending the scary old woman recluse down the road to stealing her mother’s plants back from the new owners of her home to the horror of converting the entire farming community into satellite TV junkies. Laskas’ style of writing just draws the reader in, making us feel like a part of her amazing family, and creating an intimate, appealing and ultimately satisfying escape into her gentle world of farming, laughs and love. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nF5: Devastation, Survival and the Most Violent Tornado Outbreak of the 20th Century by Mark Levine: On April 3, 1974, the United States was hit by at least 148 tornados spawned from one “megastorm” that killed hundreds and caused billions in property damage. Six of these tornados were rated F5 with sustained winds of over 260 miles per hour. This book tells the story of that day in a rural Alabama county where dozens of individual tornadoes reeked havoc. I grew up in central Alabama in one of the infamous tornado alleys. I have had the experience of having one pass directly overhead (they really do sound like a freight train) and have helped clean up after a dozen of them. Nothing can prepare you for the sheer power of one of these beasts, nor its ability to change lives and alter landscapes in seconds. If you have never experienced one, this reads like fiction. If you have, then you know it is fact. A hurricane, tsunami, blizzard, volcano eruption, even earthquake – generally there is some warning. With tornados, you may die in the wreckage of your home while the dinner table at your neighbor’s house isn’t even disturbed. Entire houses can be picked up and set back down hundreds of feet away with children safely sleeping inside. The sheer capriciousness of these storms actually gives them a certain majesty, not unlike a “big cat” or other predator. Levine has captured about as much of these monsters as any human can – which is still only a modicum of their reality. 05/07 Jack Quick\n\nFather Joe: The Man Who Saved my Soul by Tony Hendra: Tony Hendra is a British comedian and comic writer (he prefers the term “satirist.”) American audiences may be most familiar with him as the Ian Faith character in the rock satire This is Spinal Tap. This book is the surprising story of his spiritual journey from his teens to the present day and the role played in it by his spiritual advisor, a Benedictine monk named Father Joe.\n\nThe beginning of their relationship is hardly auspicious. Young Hendra is sent to the monastery for confession and punishment when he is caught in the early stages of adolescent grouping with a neighbor’s wife. Hendra is given a glimpse of a better faith when Father Joe suggests that the only sin involved was selfishness.\n\nLater in their relationship, as Father Joe advises Tony that his career is in the world and not in the monastery, he comments that “more husbands and wives should be canonized.” Hendra does go on to live in the world and have a very successful career at the National Lampoon and other places, but he regularly feels the need in time of trouble to travel back to the monastery and visit with Father Joe. Despite Father Joe’s cloistered existence, he seems to fully grasp the problems created by a fast-past modern society and life in the entertainment industry. As the story concludes, Mr. Hendra brings his son to visit the dying monk.\n\nThis book is The Seven Story Mountain of our time and will be considered one of the most important books of this decade. It is not light reading, however and may not be appreciated by those readers and worshippers who prefer their God “lite.” Read it anyway. Any book with a sentence like “The first exercise of love is listening.” is worth reading and pondering. 06/04 ~This review contributed by Geoffrey R. Hamlin.\n\nFIRE-BREATHING LIBERAL: How I Learned to Survive (and Thrive) in the Contact Sport of Congress by Robert Wexler: Wexler is my congressman, and I’ve voted for him in every election in which he’s run. So I come to this book with a prejudicial view – I like the guy. How can you not like a guy who was honest enough to admit to Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report that he has tried cocaine? True, as Colbert pointed out, Wexler was running unopposed so he could have admitted to just about anything and been re-elected. This is his story. His years in Congress have been turbulent, to say the least. I also live in the district with the infamous “butterfly ballot” and it was my neighbors who gave the election away by mistake. Wexler discusses those issues, as well as the Supreme Court decision (Gore v. Bush), Clinton’s impeachment and why he thinks Bush should be impeached, his visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad, and lots more Washington insider stuff. Wexler makes it all fascinating and entertaining, a winning combination for any book, but especially one steeped in politics. 7/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nFISH! A Proven Way to Boost Morale and Improve Results by Stephen C. Lundin, Harry Paul, & John Christensen: There is a Pike Place cookbook coming out in March, so I decided to revisit this classic business book and see if it still holds up. Originally published in 2000, the world, especially the business community, has changed a great deal since then. Could the ideas espoused here still work? I think so. The premise of the book, told as an inspiration tale, a “fish tale” if you will, is that the Toxic Waste Dump is floundering and a new manager is brought on board (if you’ll pardon the fish puns.) She visits the famous Pike Place Fish Market across the street from her office and finds the employees there having fun and selling lots and lots of fish. Can you run a business where the employees are passionate about their work, having a great time with each other and the customers, and still make a profit? You bet, and this little book will show you how it’s done. Should be required reading for every manager. If you’ve never read it, or maybe read it when it first came out twelve years ago, pick it up and take another look. It will inspire you all over again. 12/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nFODOR’S SMART 1,001 TRAVEL TIPS: A must read for would-be world travelers. How else can you learn to pack your own chewing gum if you are going to Singapore since its not sold there, and oh yes, be careful of the water in Mexico – use boiled or bottled water even for brushing your teeth. A well-written and somewhat quirky guide that even armchair travelers can enjoy. Even native English speakers can have difficulty with Scots’ English, so don’t hesitate to ask for clarification. Also, watch out for New Zealand’s one health hazard -“duck itch”. In Holland be aware that coffee shops also sell (legally) marijuana, hash, and drug paraphernalia, which can be used on the spot. And if you are a book lover, no matter where you go, pack an empty tote bag or duffle inside your luggage as you will need the extra room to bring home the books. 11/07 Jack Quick\n\nFOOD FOR THOUGHT by Philip J. Romano: Over 200,000 people pay daily homage to the genius of Romano. They do so by eating at Fuddrucker’s, Romano’s Macaroni Grill, eatZi’s, Shuckers or Cozymels. Romano developed and has successfully operated and marketed each of these national restaurant concepts/chains. In his book he shares the reasons for his success, which include placing service first over profit and getting people to work with you rather than for you. Sounds simple, but you must be doing it right to build a $10 billion restaurant empire. Nicely written and interesting background for all of us who tend to eat out more than at home. 03/06 Jack Quick\n\nFOOD RULES: An Eater’s Manual by Michael Pollan: Pollan is the genius behind In Defense of Food, The Omnivore’s Dilemma and a few other books on food and where it comes from. He is also one of the stars of the Academy Award nominated documentary, Food, Inc., for me a life changing film about the food industry in this country and one of the most enlightening and frightening films I’ve ever seen.\n\nThe thing is that Pollan is not one of these militant, radical vegans or anything. To me he comes across like the voice of reason. He eats meat, but sparingly and only free range beef and organic. He does his research and for this book, also put up a request on a New York Times food blog for people to send him the rules about eating that they grew up with. This book is a compilation of his own rules and those he’s collected. It’s a tiny paperback and at its simplest, is a collection of wisdom on how to eat for health and well being. It is an easy read and often amusing.\n\nOne of the rules: “avoid food products that make health claims.” A company with the resources to get FDA approved health claims for their products doesn’t necessarily make them healthy – think margarine. Once touted as the healthy alternative to butter, we now know that the transfats it contains are worse than the saturated fat in butter. Or as Pollan puts it, “the silence of the yams” doesn’t make them less healthful. More rules: “Avoid food products containing ingredients that no ordinary human would keep in the pantry.” (Xanthan gum anyone?) “Eat only foods that will eventually rot.” Not Twinkies, which Pollan took on book tour with him and after two years, remain as fresh as the day he bought them. And a couple of my favorites: “Avoid food products containing ingredients that a third-grader cannot pronounce,” and “If it came from a plant, eat it; if it was made in a plant, don’t.” Thought provoking to say the least. 02/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nTHE FORTUNE COOKIE CHRONICLES: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food by Jennifer 8. Lee: I love Chinese food, and I love humorously written, well researched food books, so when I heard about this one, I couldn’t wait to get my chopsticks on it. I am really glad I did. This is a fact-filled, fun read about the history of Chinese food in America, that includes amazing research that took the author all through China and Japan. Japan, you say? Why yes, because our beloved fortune cookies are not Chinese in origin, but rather Japanese. In fact, we are now exporting “American fortune cookies” to China. The idea of delivering food to people’s homes started with a savvy Chinese restaurant owner in New York City. And Lee explores the relationship between Jews and Chinese food, including a chapter devoted to the only Glatt Kosher Chinese restaurant in the southeastern United States, and its Peking Duck scandal. She goes looking for the origin of one of our most popular dishes, General Tso’s chicken, and explains why chop suey is disappearing off of Chinese restaurant menus all across America – hint: neither dish is Chinese in origin. This is a quick, fun read, perfect to read in small bites and guaranteed to make you hungry. 05/08 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nFOUR KITCHENS: MY LIFE BEHIND THE BURNER IS NEW YORK, HANOI, TEL AVIV, AND PARIS by Lauren Shockey: After finishing college, Lauren Shockey surprised her parents by going to culinary school. She decides that she will round out her cooking education by completing stages (kitchen internships) at four different restaurants with very different viewpoints. She begins her journey at Wylie Dufresne’s wd-50 in New York then travels to Vietnam to work at La Verticale. From Vietnam, Shockey then travels to Tel Aviv to work in Carmella Bistro. Finally, she ends her journey in Paris at Senderens. Shockey describes her time at wd-50 in great detail but her vastly different experience in Hanoi focuses little on the kitchen aspect and more on the local cuisine while Tel Aviv’s central focus becomes more about Shockey’s friends and personal exchanges. In Paris, the focus once again becomes the kitchen, but the transitions all lead up to Shockey’s conclusions at the end of her journey: enjoying food and cooking for others is not necessarily all it takes to make it in a restaurant career. It’s an expensive lesson to learn, but at least she has the kitchen skills to really impress her friends and loved ones! Four Kitchens is entertaining, but is missing a little of the wow factor other food memoirs out there offer. I did find Shockey to be very honest and insightful throughout the book, though. 09/11 Becky Lejeune\n\nFREE FOR ALL: Oddballs, Geeks, and Gangstas in the Public Library by Don Borchert: This one is for the librarians. I checked out the customer reviews on Amazon, and it doesn’t seem to be appreciated nearly as well by library users, and since I work in a library, I have a biased view, which of course I’m happy to share. Borchert is an assistant librarian in a suburban Los Angeles public library, which means he doesn’t have his coveted masters degree in library and information science. But he does have several years experience in dealing with the public, and that’s what he shares in this funny, breezy book. If you think libraries are quiet, dull places of study, then you haven’t been to a public library lately. Borchert’s library may be suburban but has had its share of drug dealers working out of the men’s room, moms brawling in the stacks, and regulars that include a man desperately seeking to buy a South American wife, and Henry, the daily crossword puzzle aficionado/nut. He discusses the hiring process and employment practices of civil service jobs – pass probation and you’ve got a job you can retire from. But it’s the little stories, one after another, that bring this book to life. Written in conversational style, it’s rather like spending a few hours in a bar with a friend who’s unloading about work, like the story about the Indian girl who was hired because she was quiet and helped make the library diverse, but was fired when some young boys were singing offensive rap songs and she exploded like an atom bomb in the middle of the library, practically ripping their heads off. Or the story about the proud parents of the child doing a science fair project on which the absorbency of diapers, and in doing his research Googled the word “diapers” and found a picture of a 50-year-old man wearing one along with a very satisfied smile. But only other library/civil service workers will appreciate the chain of command that must be followed when you see a body go flying past your window. 12/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nFROM ANIMAL HOUSE TO OUR HOUSE: A LOVE STORY by Ron Tanner: My house is under renovation. It is 25 years old and in need of new bathrooms and kitchen. So I’m very interested in other people’s renovations, on TV and now in books. The “animal house” of the title is an old 4500 square foot condemned Victorian in Baltimore that had been owned by a fraternity for ten years, long enough to leave 3 full trailers of trash inside the house. The house was destroyed, barely left standing, and Ron bought it. He fell in love with the possibilities and was stubborn enough to ignore all the warnings. It took several years to make it habitable, and along the way he talked his girlfriend into moving in and working on it too. Honestly, I could have lived without all the girlfriend drama and would have killed for some photographs; this is a book that is just crying out for photographs. There are a few in the book trailer. Instead, I had to settle for slow moving prose and the author’s sketches. It was an interesting story, an interesting reno for sure, but not a great book – this is strictly for those who want to see what’s it really like behind the scenes of those 30 minute renovations on the DIY channel. 5/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nGARLIC AND SAPPHIRES: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise by Ruth Reichl: A quintessential New York book that is so delicious I devoured it in one sitting, if you’ll pardon the food metaphors. Reichl was the NY Times restaurant critic for many years, and this is the inside scoop on how that worked. She learned on her flight in from Los Angeles to take the job that her picture was already hung in every kitchen of every important restaurant in NY. She decided she would need to invent a new persona, someone who could dine anonymously and ended up creating several. Her claim to fame came with an early double review of the famous NY eating establishment, Le Cirque – one review was as the recognized restaurant critic for the Times, the other as an anonymous diner. It cost the restaurant their coveted fourth star and made people sit up and take notice of the newcomer. The book details her meals and her life as a critic with humor and pathos. Reichl is a passionate foodie and her descriptions will fascinate and satiate the reader. 05/05\n\nTHE GASTRONOMY OF MARRIAGE by Michelle Maisto: In Michelle Maisto’s debut, a food memoir that also traces her relationship as she and her fiancée begin building their life together, Maisto shares her passion for cooking and her journey through her new engagement. She walks the reader through her city, her neighborhood, her food memories, and the ups and downs of planning a marriage in the midst of her everyday twenty-something life. With her own thoughts on other culinary writings, the various complications and adventures of combining households (and kitchens), and food itself, Michelle invites readers to experience a little bit of her world. As an eager foodie myself, The Gastronomy of Marriage is a fun look into someone else’s kitchen and their cooking exploits. Maisto writes about food—and the rest of her life—with an elegance and passion that readers will truly enjoy. The book also includes a collection of the recipes discussed within. 09/09 Becky Lejeune\n\nHAPPY ACCIDENTS: 12 Offbeat Essays Exploring the Irony in the Ordinary by David Boyne: A fun and sometimes touching collection of essays that each look at a little slice of life. “Hurry Up and Wait” explores the phenomenon of waiting in line for complicated coffee as the tattooed baristas gossip amongst themselves and with their customers, while a man who is illegally doubleparked is close to apoplexy. Another essay looks at bumper stickers and one of my favorites, at step-parenting. Well written, imaginative and a great way to spend a few hours. Available for the . 03/11 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHEAT: An Amateur’s Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany by Bill Buford: This is a fun read for anyone who enjoys the Food Network, Mario Batali, or has a healthy curiosity about what goes on in a high end restaurant kitchen. Buford gave up his “real” job as an editor at the New Yorker to work full time for Batali in the kitchen at Babbo. Buford is charming and honest about his fun and foibles, from being deliberately bumped 40-some-odd times a shift (by the higher ranking kitchen echelon to keep him in his place,) to the wines that are really used in the restaurant, the blisters on his hands (tongs are useful!), or flying off with Mario to help at a charity event. It’s a foodie’s delight and I couldn’t put it down. 08/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHEROES FOR MY DAUGHTER by Brad Meltzer: Brad Meltzer has three children and they are not all boys. As soon as he published Heroes For My Son, his daughter kept asking about her book. Meltzer has delivered. This book is bigger and dare I say even better than the first, but maybe being a daughter myself I’m a bit prejudiced? No matter, this is a beautiful book, a keepsake, a treasure to be handed down from one generation to the next. As in the Son book, there is a page for you to add your own, personal hero, as well. Meltzer’s heroes aren’t all women, but women predominate as they should in a book aimed at girls. He includes 55 heroes as diverse as Rosa Parks, Eleanor Roosevelt, the passengers on United Flight 93, and Lucille Ball. Each story inspires and these are meant to be read aloud, together. With Mother’s Day right around the corner, I suggest Moms buy this book as a gift for their daughters and granddaughters, and everyone buy this book as a gift for their mom. Then go read together. 5/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHEROES FOR MY SON by Brad Meltzer: This is a giant step away from the thrillers and even graphic novels Meltzer is best known for. Meltzer says he’s been thinking about this book since his first child was born, and it shows. This is a lovely book, a gift to be shared and cherished with children and grandchildren and anyone else who needs a hero. It is a series of photographs and very short essays, no more than a few paragraphs, about the men and women Meltzer finds the most inspiring, and why he wants his son to know about them. These heroes range from the expected like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Albert Einstein to lesser known heroes like Andy Miyares, a Special Olympics swimmer and Barbara Johns, a high school student at the heart of Brown vs. Board of Education. Fifty-two heroes in all, from the most personal, Meltzer’s mother who died from breast cancer, to everyone’s hero, Captain Sullenberger who landed a plane in the Hudson River. There’s even a page at the back of the book with room for the picture and story of your own hero. It’s just a beautiful book to share with those you love. Meltzer has created a legacy. 05/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHiding Places by Daniel Asa Rose: After his divorce, the author decides to take his 2 boys, ages 7 & 12, to Europe to find the hiding places their relatives used to escape the “not-sees” during the Holocaust. I loved the premise of a man instilling his family history, making memories, for his sons. Reading it was an emotional roller coaster that had me laughing and crying and left me both elated and exhausted. A truly amazing book that I could not put down. Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHISTORY DECODED: The 10 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time by Brad Meltzer: There are a few reasons why I love this book, and the conspiracies are the least of it. Don’t get me wrong, the conspiracies which range from Lincoln to Kennedy to the gold (or lack thereof) in Fort Knox to the real Da Vinci Code are fascinating reading, and sure to appeal to fans of TV’s “Brad Metlzer’s Decoded” and all conspiracy and history buffs. But it is the way the material is researched and presented that really pushed this book to the top of the heap. The research is meticulous, and being Brad Meltzer, famous, bestselling author and known conspiracy theorist, with friends like Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, certainly gave him access to people and materials that most mere mortals wouldn’t get near. But it is the physical book itself that really blew me away – this is a stunning book, literally a piece of art. The book is hard cover and textured and filled with ephemera. If you are familiar with Nick Bantock’s Griffin and Sabine series, then you will understand. But that was a novel, and this is factual. Each chapter contains an envelope with replicas of things like the wanted poster for John Wilkes Booth and his will; a code used by the Knights of the Golden Circle, thought to have helped Jefferson Davis hide the Confederate gold; the airline ticket for Dan Cooper, the only American skyjacker who was never caught; facsimiles of the form used to report UFO sightings to the government along with a report of a 1947 UFO sighting in Mt. Ranier, Washington. And while I love eBooks and their convenience in holding a massive quantity of books and accessibility (I don’t need reading glasses for my ) a book like this simply cannot be replicated electronically. And I truly love that. Put this on your holiday wish list and even better, buy a copy for all those people who are hard to shop for and they will thank you. 10/13 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHIT LIT: Cracking the Code of the Twentieth Century’s Biggest Bestsellers by James W. Hall: Hall is a mystery writer and a creative writing professor at Florida International University. As a mystery writer, he has sold millions of books, but not millions of copies of one book like the bestsellers in Hit Lit. As a writing teacher, he taught his students to “plagiarize” by taking a favorite book and breaking it down into minute pieces. How many words in the first chapter, when does the protagonist appear, what percentage is dialogue, and so forth. Then his students would create their own story, using the formula they created from their favorite book. The remarkable thing is that more than half of that first class who performed this exercise had their books published, a ridiculously high number of debuts from one writing class. One of those students was Dennis Lehane.\n\nIn Hit Lit, Hall takes apart twelve of the biggest selling books of all time. You know them, probably read most of them. Gone With the Wind. The Godfather. The Da Vinci Code. To Kill a Mockinbird. Jaws. Most have spawned hugely successful films as well. But what do these books have in common? Hall dissects them and shares with us the appeal factors that are in all of these extraordinary books. This is fascinating reading, and a must read for anyone who works with the public in the book industry – public librarians and booksellers for sure, and for avid readers and writers everywhere. If you can understand why people like something, it becomes easier to find other books they’ll like. This one is going on my reference bookshelf. 5/12 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHOUSE: A Memoir by Michael Ruhlman: From the back cover and flap info on this book I was expecting a written version of This Old House or Extreme Makeover. But what I got instead was a story about a writer and his family and how they live; an old house renovated by an architect, a contractor and his team; and a fascinating history of suburbia, Cleveland-style. Ruhlman, author of the wonderful Soul of a Chef, reveals more of himself than the actual construction efforts and it makes for compelling reading. 11/05\n\nHOW NOT TO WRITE A NOVEL by Howard Mittelmark and Sandra Newman: There are any number of how-to writer’s guides out there but this is not one of them, this is a how-NOT-to guide. Mittlemark and Newman use their combined years in the publishing industry to put together a guide using the most common mistakes made by authors. With advice on everything from plot and style to setting and character development, each chapter is full of useful information on what to avoid when writing your book. By outlining the pitfalls of writing with amusing and interesting examples, Mittelmark and Newman have created what turns out to be a quite funny and easy to read guide that will prove to be a very useful tool to any writer out there. Whether you are finally trying your hand at your first novel, or you’re trying to sell your first completed novel, How NOT to Write a Novel can help along each step of the process and clue you into just what you need to do to clean up your manuscript and get it published. 04/08 Becky Lejeune\n\nHOW STARBUCKS SAVED MY LIFE: A Son of Privilege Learns to Live Like Everyone Else by Michael Gates Gill: Michael Gates Gill grows up in a very comfortable way, then builds a very successful career in advertising with a prestigious firm. But after twenty-something years, a new, young boss is brought in who wants to surround himself with new, young employees, so buh-bye Mike. After an affair that produces another child, buh-bye marriage. Mike finds himself wondering how to survive with no health insurance and the strong possibility of brain cancer. He wanders in to a nearby Starbucks, where a young African-American woman is sitting at the next table. She asks him if he wants to work for Starbucks, and before he knows it, he is. Health insurance is the big draw, but Mike soon learns that feeling useful again is a pretty nice feeling. If you’ve ever worried how you’re going to make it through retirement, or if you are a Starbucks addict, like moi, then this is a very thorough and enjoyable look at the inside of the company through the eyes of one of its happier employees. 09/07 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHOW TO BOOZE: EXQUISITE COCKTAILS AND UNSOUND ADVICE by Jordan Kaye and Marshall Altier: Booze and humor: always a great pair. Jordan Kaye and Marshall Altier have put these two things together in a funny, and sometimes pretty raunchy, bar book filled with tips on the perfect drink, history of classic cocktails, and frat-boy level humor in How to Booze. As a bar book, I actually love the indexing. The guys have divided the index by spirit and then within each spirit by how well-stocked your liquor cabinet may be. Looking for a simple drink with gin? Try a classic gimlet, which is by the way, the recommended drink for your second date. Prefer rum? Someone with a well-stocked (geeked out) bar might prefer a Mai Tai Roa-Ae to serve at a barbecue. I’d say any of the drinks inside would make a good accompaniment for reading Kaye and Altier’s “Unsound Advice.” Like I said, booze and humor always make a good pairing. 06/10 Becky Lejeune\n\nHOW TO COOK LIKE A TOP CHEF by The Creators of Top Chef: Right out of the box let me say you will not learn how to cook like a “Top Chef” from this book. You will learn how the “top chefs” do what they do, however, and that is a pretty satisfying read. Can’t review this book without mentioning the glaring error of a wrongly credited photo; the picture is of Graham Elliot Bowles and is attached to the Rick Moonen bio. But these creators of Top Chef dish the dirt, show us the tattoos, and share lots of Season 6 recipes, none of which I will make. Probably. If you are looking for a gift for your favorite foodie, this is an excellent place to start. 11/10 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHOW TO EAT A SMALL COUNTRY: A FAMILY’S PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, ONE MEAL AT A TIME by Amy Finley: Fans of Food Network’s Next Food Network Star will remember Amy Finley as the perky winner of season 3, whose short run show, The Gourmet Next Door, disappeared after just one season. Anyone who wondered why finds out in How to Eat a Small Country. Finley gave up her short stint as a TV chef when her husband threatened to leave. In an effort to put their marriage back together, Finley suggested that they all (husband, wife, and two small children) move to France where they could travel and eat and basically learn how to be a family again. Their trip, arguments and all, is chronicled in Finley’s new food memoir. I was struck by how great Finley is as a writer. Her vivid (and some might say gruesome at times) descriptions of food and cooking methods are fantastic. Amazingly, she also pulls no punches in describing her family life, her frustrations, her fears, and her hopes. I liked Finley and her show quite a bit. I liked her book just as much. 06/11 Becky Lejeune\n\nHOW TO SET HIS THIGHS ON FIRE: 86 Red-Hot Lessons on Love, Life, Men, and (Especially) Sex by Kate White: When the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine writes a book with a title like this, you get exactly what you expect; a book length version of Cosmo minus the pictures. If you love all the cutesy columns about getting along with your bitch of a boss, pleasing your man and making sure he pleases you, and you want some inside dish on celebrities, this is the book for you. Back in the day, and by that I mean the Helen Gurley Brown days, Cosmo was new, inventive and shockingly bold about s-e-x when every other woman’s magazine was avoiding the topic completely. But the cat was let out of the bag a long time ago and there’s no stuffing it back in again, so frankly, this book just bored me. The best thing I can say about it is it’s written in 86 very short, very put-downable chapters, making it a great book to read at traffic lights. 06/06 Stacy Alesi, AKA The BookBitch\n\nHUSTLING IN AMERICA: The Secrets To Success For International Entrepreneurs Seeking To Turn Their American Dream Into Reality by Charles Kollo: If you are even remotely thinking about starting a business, make this book from successful entrepreneur and author Charles Kollo your initial investment. I have participated in the startup of three companies and wish that I could have had the benefit of his book for each of them. Packed with ideas and tips gained from Kollo’s personal experience as an FBE (Foreign Born Entrepreneur), this book will be invaluable whether you are trying to start a business in a foreign country, if you are a minority tryin"
