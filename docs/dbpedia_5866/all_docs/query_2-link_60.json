        "text": "As we approach Memorial Day in the United States, I am reminded of the many friends and family members affected by war and its fallout, but rarely do veterans talk about their experiences. The authors below have captured the challenges and realities soldiers have faced throughout history. If you read Military Fiction and Non-fiction, these are among the best.\n\nMark Bowden: “Black Hawk Down,” true story of American forces in Somalia.\n\nPhilip Caputo: \"A Rumor of War,\" the riveting true story of Philip Caputo's experience in Viet Nam.\n\nTom Clancy: “The Hunt for Red October,” based on a story rumored to be true.\n\nStephen Coonts: “Flight of the Intruder,” gripping story of Navy carrier pilot during Viet Nam, based on Coonts’ experiences.\n\nBernard Cornwell: “Sharpe’s Rifles,” part of a fictional series about Napoleonic warfare.\n\nNelson DeMille: “Up Country,” one of DeMille’s best. My review can be read here.\n\nKen Follett: “The Eye of the Needle,” Edgar Award winner.\n\nChristopher Hibbert: “Red Coats and Rebels,” American Revolution told from the British perspective.\n\nLaura Hillenbrand: “Unbroken,” WW2 true story of resilience, review here.\n\nJohn Keegan: “The Face of Battle,” the story of what real soldiers go through, with information about famous battles in history.\n\nPhil Klay: “Redeployment,” award-winning book contains 12 short stories centered around deployment in Afghanistan & Iraq.\n\nMarcus Luttrell: “Lone Survivor: Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10.”\n\nTim O'Brien: \"The Things They Carried,\" award-winning book of the Viet Nam conflict.\n\nThank a veteran. Give him/her a job. They sacrificed much and fought to keep you free.\n\n“Louise’s War,” by Sarah Shaber, introduces us to widowed Louise Pearlie, a file clerk in World War II Washington, DC. Louise is not just any file clerk. She has college training, is smart and resourceful, and is a bit of a risk taker. She works in the Office of Strategic Services (aka spy agency) where all the work is classified and government regulations dictate that she can’t even reveal where she works. Louise’s job is to look for information that will help the Allies win the war, perfect for this woman who has escaped her dead-end life on the Carolina coast.\n\nFrance is increasingly coming under German control at this stage of the war and it’s been a while since Louise has heard from a close college friend who lives there. Her husband is important to the war effort, and Louise searches for a way to get this Jewish family out of France before they are taken to internment camps.\n\nWhen papers that would save her friend go missing and a murder is committed, Louise realizes that she can’t trust anyone. She must make alliances she would not have made in less desperate circumstances, and time is not her friend. Shaber creates a tension filled atmosphere of subterfuge and betrayal that keeps us guessing and swept up in the story.\n\nIn “Louise’s War,” Shaber demonstrates the gravity of the events of the war through her well-researched picture of life in WWII America, with its details of domestic sacrifices, and the effects of gas and food rationing. Louise’s time at a D.C. boarding house shows the reality of the jammed housing situation in wartime Washington. Massive amounts of food were needed by the troops, so the backyard gardens and chicken coops that Louise tended at the boarding house were true to the period, necessary supplements to rationed civilian food supplies.\n\nIn “Louise’s Dilemma,” Louise’s job focus has shifted to acquiring and cataloguing intelligence about Nazi U-boats in the North Atlantic. Louise and an FBI agent travel to nearby Maryland after a suspicious postcard is forwarded to the OSS. Their investigation takes alarming twists and turns and puts Louise in danger from a surprising villain. Her clever mind and dogged determination uncover something incredible, yet completely believable, given the real-world terrain in that area. “Louise’s Dilemma,” the third book in the series, delivers an engaging historical mystery and a compelling read. I had read it first, then picked up “Louise’s War,” to see how Louise Pearlie’s journey began. I’m glad I did.\n\nPlease click here for more information about award-winning Mrs. Shaber and her other books."
