        "text": "Even as we're sorting out the best and brightest in cinema from 2003, there's a whole new year waiting for us.\n\nIn 2004 we'll get computer-generated cats (\"Garfield\") and dogs (\"Scooby Doo 2\"), and movies where stars like Tom Cruise (\"Collateral\") and Robert Redford (\"The Clearing\") are kidnapped. A science fiction classic will finally be translated to the big screen when Will Smith stars in \"I, Robot\" based on Isaac Asimov's novel.\n\nOh, and we're expecting another visit from a not-so-boyish-anymore wizard named Potter.\n\nRomance movies will see some new twists in the new year, with couples separated by disjointed realities and surreal set-ups.\n\nJosh Hartnett and Ashton Kutcher travel through time and the mind's inner landscape in, respectively, \"Wicker Park\" and \"The Butterfly Effect.\" Adam Sandler woos a girl who can't remember him in \"50 First Dates.\" And Jim Carrey has his memories of lousy romance erased in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"\n\nThe past year was a great one for animation, and 2004 is shaping up nicely, too, with \"Shrek 2,\" the bovine Disney musical \"Home on the Range\" and the latest computer-animated effort from Pixar, \"The Incredibles.\"\n\nLook for more sequels (\"Barbershop 2,\" \"Spider-Man 2\"), comic book translations (\"Catwoman,\" \"The Punisher\"), remakes (\"The Stepford Wives,\" \"Walking Tall\") and a rebirth of the sandal-and-toga epic (Brad Pitt in \"Troy,\" Colin Farrell in \"Alexander\").\n\nHere's a very early look at what's heading down the pike.
