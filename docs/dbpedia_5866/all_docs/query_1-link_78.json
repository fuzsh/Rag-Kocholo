        "text": "Seabiscuit\n\nBy Laura Hillenbrand,\n\nFrom my list on thoroughbred horses and horse racing.\n\nBy Avalyn Hunter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAn old photograph shows a little blonde girl trying to climb a fence separating her from a pasture full of broodmares near Louisville, Kentucky. That was me, and I have never lost my fascination with these creatures of beauty, courage, and magic. Combine that with an equal passion for books, research, and writing, and you have the path leading to four books and hundreds of magazine articles on Thoroughbred horses over the last twenty years, with a fifth book due out next spring. The five books I’ve recommended are just a few of those that have provided touchstones and inspiration for my journey as a writer.\n\nAvalyn's book list on thoroughbred horses and horse racing\n\nWhy did Avalyn love this book?\n\nWhen I first picked up Seabiscuit, I was dubious; I had already read too many stories of champion racehorses that were either dry histories or overblown hero-worship.\n\nA hundred pages later (where did the time go?) I was completely engrossed and headed for an all-night read. In Hillenbrand’s hands, carefully researched history became the foundation for a sweeping story of a great horse, the incredible cast of people who gave him what he needed to become a legend, and the world of horses, horse racing, and American life in the 1930s.\n\nIf I ever write anything half as good, I will be well content.\n\nBy Laura Hillenbrand,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Seabiscuit as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of the runaway phenomenon Unbroken comes a universal underdog story about the horse who came out of nowhere to become a legend.\n\nSeabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini. But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:\n\nCharles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to…\n\nPreview\n\nHorse Heaven\n\nBy Jane Smiley,\n\nFrom my list on people with other animals in the mix.\n\nBy Meredith Marple Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a former independent publisher and current writer of memoir and fiction. My degree was in zoology (animal biology), which got me my first job in educational publishing. After a solid career in textbooks, I switched over to trade publishing and finally writing. I may have left the \"hard science\" behind, but I continue to be fascinated by human and animal behavior, which shows up in my reading and writing.\n\nMeredith's book list on people with other animals in the mix\n\nWhy did Meredith love this book?\n\nThe animal is a number of racehorses. The human is a collection of owners, trainers, jockeys, and more, yielding a comprehensive look at human and animal behavior in the horse racing industry. A strong, intimate novel. I used to ride but never very well, and I’ve always wondered what a horse’s “thoughts” involved. Author Smiley gave me a feel for that as she applied her own assumptions to one horse in particular.\n\nBy Jane Smiley,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Horse Heaven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK\n\n\"A WISE, SPIRITED NOVEL . . .

I was drawn to her with a magnetic force, and that attraction to horses never diminished. Over the years I’ve presided over their birth, raised them, and conditioned them to various disciplines. When it exists, the bond between horse and human is undeniable. In my novels—through family disfunction, hardship, adventure, and mystery – I explore how this connection gives young people confidence and the courage to overcome any obstacles.\n\nShelley's book list on the horse/human connection\n\nWhy did Shelley love this book?\n\nJaimy Gordon has written a beautiful, unforgettable novel that takes place at a run-down racecourse in West Virginia, where a has-been trainer forms a get-rich-quick plan with used-up racehorses. The story of Lord of Misrule, the legendary stakes winner, brings us into the heart of it, where everybody’s searching for something, everything has a price and what’s truly valuable is right in front of your nose.\n\nBy Jaimy Gordon,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Lord of Misrule as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nLonglisted for the Orange Prize 2012.

Could he be that sure, could he count on being that lucky? Listen carefully my dear. Lord of Misrule, he whispered loudly. Lord of Misrule, Margaret. Memorize that name.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Horse Whisperer\n\nBy Nicholas Evans,\n\nFrom my list on the relationship between horses and people.\n\nBy Diana Kimpton Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI have been a writer for thirty years and a horse lover my entire life. When I decided to write There Must Be Horses, I set out to learn about natural horsemanship and the way horses and people relate to each other. Of course, I then needed to try out all those exciting ideas myself so I bought myself a horse to help with my research. That was my excuse anyway – in truth I was finally fulfilling my childhood dream of a pony of my own. I still have that horse and would never part with him. He’s an important part of our family.\n\nDiana's book list on the relationship between horses and people\n\nWhy did Diana love this book?\n\nI read this book when it was first published, and I couldn’t put it down. The story opens with a dreadful accident where a lorry hits two girls out riding together. One girl and her horse are killed, the other girl has life-changing injuries. and her horse is so traumatised that the vet suggests putting him down. However, her mother refuses to do that. Instead, she loads the horse into a trailer and takes him and her daughter to Montana to meet a horse whisperer who she hopes can heal them all.

At sixteen I began working at Atlantic City Racecourse in the summer and after I graduated college with a B.S. in Animal Science, I became a trainer of Thoroughbred racehorses. For thirteen wonderful years, I raced horses in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Due to my insider’s knowledge of the horse racing industry, I based my book selections on accuracy as well as story.\n\nDawn's book list on horse racing\n\nWhy did Dawn love this book?\n\nActually, I could have chosen any of the Dick Francis mystery books for this list as they are wonderfully consistent in quality of writing and story. Plus, as a former steeple chase jockey, Francis knows horse racing. It’s surprising how many “horse books” out there get racing so wrong. I can’t count how many of his books I read while sitting in the barn waiting to race my own horses.\n\nBy Dick Francis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Bolt as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nKit Fielding will do whatever it takes to stop the killing of racehorses. Not an easy task considering that the woman he adores is leaving him, an international arms dealer is threatening him, and Kit's nemesis has plans to knock him off the track—and plant him under it.\n\nPreview\n\nThe God of Small Things\n\nBy Arundhati Roy,\n\nFrom my list on transporting you across time and place.\n\nBy Jawahara Saidullah Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nTravel and writing are my two great passions. Since I was a child, I escaped reality by escaping into my own mind. I had relied on my stories of the warrior queens ever since I learned about them as a child. It was only a few years ago, when I lived in Geneva, that I had a memory flash at me of the statue of Queen Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi on a rearing horse with a curved sword held in one hand. I knew then that it was time to tell a story—my own story and that of my favorite warrior queens.\n\nJawahara's book list on transporting you across time and place\n\nWhy did Jawahara love this book?\n\nAs a sucker for beautiful writing, this book had me from the first page, and I couldn’t put it down. So many issues that had been part of my childhood culture resonated with me while it also showed me many others from a part of India that I had never even visited.\n\nThough sweeping in its scope, it drills down into a very human story with all its pain and love. It weaves myth, story, real life, love, loss, and the meaning of family. It was one of the first novels by an Indian woman that transcended cultures, gender, and any preconceived notions.\n\nBy Arundhati Roy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked The God of Small Things as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'They all broke the rules. They all crossed into forbidden territory. They all tampered with the laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much.'\n\nThis is the story of Rahel and Estha, twins growing up among the banana vats and peppercorns of their blind grandmother's factory, and amid scenes of political turbulence in Kerala. Armed only with the innocence of youth, they fashion a childhood in the shade of the wreck that is their family: their lonely, lovely mother, their beloved Uncle Chacko (pickle baron, radical Marxist, bottom-pincher) and their sworn enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun,…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Black Tides of Heaven\n\nBy Neon Yang,\n\nWhy did Corin love this book?\n\nAs a fellow genderqueer/non-binary Asian writer, I’m happy to champion the first in Neon Yang’s Tensorate series. A YA novella set in a non-Western fantasy landscape, this book tackles issues of gender identity and choice head-on, introducing us to a society where children are referred to individually using they/them pronouns, and can select one of the binary genders when they come of age or chose to remain non-binary. We see the world through the eyes of twins Mokoya and Akeha as they come into their gender expressions and their powers in a feudal, monastic society largely reminiscent of those found in Asian history.\n\nBy Neon Yang,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Black Tides of Heaven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Joyously wild stuff. Highly recommended.\" ―The New York Times\n\nOne of the 100 Best Fantasy Books of All Time, according to Time Magazine\n\nA Finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Awards for Best Novella\n\nThe Black Tides of Heaven is one of a pair of unique, standalone introductions to Neon Yang's Tensorate Series, which Kate Elliott calls \"effortlessly fascinating.\" For more of the story you can read its twin novella The Red Threads of Fortune, available simultaneously.\n\nMokoya and Akeha, the twin children of the Protector, were sold to the Grand Monastery as infants. While Mokoya developed her…\n\nPreview\n\nSingularity\n\nBy William Sleator,\n\nWhy did Mike love this book?\n\nTwin boys arrive at their late uncle’s cabin ahead of their parents and make a remarkable discovery: When their dog gets into the metal lined one room outbuilding on the property, the boys discover the animal long dead inside, and they realize that, while in the sparce little room, time moves much faster.\n\nWhen the two brothers, already at odds, begin a rivalry over the neighbor girl, one twin decides to spend a night in the room, a decision that will change their lives forever.\n\nThis is one of those stories that stays with you, and makes you ask what you would have done in the same situation as the characters in the book. Add to that a dash of cosmic horror, the fear of the unknown creeping up on you while you question the nature of time and the definition of self.\n\nBy William Sleator,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Singularity as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIdentical twins Barry and Harry Krasner are house-sitting at their great-uncle's Midwest farm. It's peaceful at first, but soon they realize there's something about the farmhouse that makes locals stay far away. The twins are sure that the locked shed out back is their reason why – but what they find there is more shocking than anything they could have imagined.\n\nPreview\n\nNooks & Crannies\n\nBy Jessica Lawson, Natalie Andrewson (illustrator),\n\nFrom my list on children’s mysteries with heart taking place in the real world.\n\nBy Courtney King Walker Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up believing there was a mystery or puzzle around every corner. That guy holding a paper bag by the garbage can? Definitely a Russian spy about to make a drop. The giant house at the top of the street? For sure, haunted (or at least hiding buried treasure). My love for clue games and solving puzzles stemmed from the books and movies I loved as a child. Now, as a children’s author, I get to continue conjuring up clue games and secret spies and puzzling old houses from an ordinary world, one that with the right imagination can turn heartache and heavy things into something close to magic.\n\nCourtney's book list on children’s mysteries with heart taking place in the real world\n\nWhy did Courtney love this book?\n\nThis story differs from the others on my list, as it takes place in England in the early twentieth century. Setting and time period aside, the plucky main character Tabitha along with her pet rat and fellow detective (in her mind) steal the show and our hearts. We can’t help but root for her despite all she comes up against and all who belittle her as she follows clues in her unique and endearing manner through a giant and possibly haunted estate. Nooks & Crannies does a fine job balancing humor and wit with more serious subjects such as murder and abuse, and is sure to appeal to fans of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nBy Jessica Lawson, Natalie Andrewson (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Nooks & Crannies as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Clue when six children navigate a mansion full of secrets—and maybe money—in this “delightful gem” (School Library Journal, starred review) with heart.\n\nSweet, shy Tabitha Crum, the neglected only child of two parents straight out of a Roald Dahl book, doesn’t have a friend in the world—except for her pet mouse, Pemberley, whom she loves dearly. But on the day she receives one of six invitations to the country estate of wealthy Countess Camilla DeMoss, her life changes forever.\n\nUpon the children’s arrival at the sprawling, possibly haunted mansion, it turns out the countess…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Forgotten Legion\n\nBy Ben Kane,\n\nWhy did Adam love this book?\n\nBen instantly became one of my favourite authors after this. It’s not often you can feel an author’s passion for their work, but it shone from every page in this book. I was already hooked on ancient Rome, but I just found this stood out amongst its peers. Ben didn’t concentrate on the generals and senators that would write their names into history, but on the everyday soldiers that lived by the edge of their sword. It is a book I will certainly never forget\n\nBy Ben Kane,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Forgotten Legion as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe Forgotten Legion - fighting for honour, freedom and revenge\n\nRomulus and Fabiola are twins, born into slavery after their mother is raped by a drunken nobleman.
