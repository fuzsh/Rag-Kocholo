We’re also previewing the British Academy of Film and Television Awards. And because it’s Valentine’s Day, we’re chanting Down! With! Love! Peyton Reed’s Down With Love that is...\n\n[theme song plays]\n\nMIA Hi and welcome to Best in Show, a limited podcast series brought to you by The Letterboxd Show. I am Mia Vicino, the West Coast Editor here at Letterboxd and Best in Show is all about awards season. We’re on the downhill run now to the Oscars via the BAFTAs, the Caesars, the Indie Spirits and all of the Guild Awards. We’re looking at the Letterboxd data on this year’s contenders. We’re having chats with special guests. And mostly we’re doing what we always do here at Letterboxd, celebrating cinema. Please welcome my Best in Show besties: Hollywood veteran and our editorial producer, Brian Formo…\n\nBRIAN Howdy.\n\nMIA And our Editor-in-Chief, Gemma Gracewood.\n\nGEMMA Hello!\n\nMIA Also on our team outside in the broadcast van with their unsweetened iced teas and their beans on toast are our resident Fact Finder, Jack’s Facts and the man with the tape deck himself, our editor Slim. As always, thank you very much to these silent gents. And now, the news. We are going to cross now to Brian for a report from inside the Oscar nominees luncheon where the big class photo of 2023 is taken. And the Academy has had finalists read Love Letters from Letterboxd.\n\nBRIAN This is Brian Formo. Reporting from the bowels of the 2023 Oscar nominee luncheon there. This is being held at the Beverly Hilton. The luncheon itself is held next to the pool. It is a sunny day in Los Angeles, California. It’s a great day for a luncheon. And because it’s the day before Valentine’s Day, we partnered with the academy to deliver love letters from letterboxes to many of the nominees who are here and they are reading and reacting to a number of reviews. I got to deliver a trophy to Cate Blanchett. No, it wasn’t an Oscar though that might be on the way for thar. It was a trophy from everyone listening. 8 million members made Cate Blanchett the most watched actress on the letterbox of 2022. She did give a shout out to Peter Jackson for the Lord of the Rings work which obviously helps her out in this case. But we had a lovely chat about TÁR, [Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio], doing the dance wearing the mask, all of that.\n\n[clip of Cate Blanchett plays]\n\nCATE I can’t tell you how exciting this is because, you know, I’ve I spent that my early years in the theater and so you know, whether the whether the auditorium is full or empty and the fact that your home auditoriums or you know the auditoriums hopefully in the cinema itself, you know, in the dark with strangers watching these films that I had the great good pleasure to be part of it. I mean, that’s the reason why we do it. So that you watch it. I can’t tell you what this means to me this time. Wow. That’s amazing. Thank you so much.\n\nBRIAN That was Cate accepting her 2022 Most watched Actress Award from letterbox users worldwide.\n\nMIA Oh, Brian, that sounded like a lovely lunch that I am not jealous of at all. Nope, not even one fit. So we’re in a bit of an Oscars holding pattern right now. So can you tell us what’s happening out there and awards Land.\n\nBRIAN Wow, I’m back. I’m in both places at once.\n\nGEMMA Did you even bring us a fried roll? Just one measly bread roll from the Oscars lunch and Brian when?\n\nMIA Maybe Ryan,\n\nGEMMA Lydia Taz signature on it. I mean, come on.\n\nMIA Yeah, of course we want to signed bread roll from Lydia thar know that\n\nBRIAN I am merely blushing. The Oscar nominations are out, voting has not started. That’s why all the guilds, all those craft unions, from everyone, from producers, to actors to editors, they’re all lined up over the next few weeks. And the televised speeches of them really start to matter depending on what people are saying at these because final voting closes for all the major guilds this week, and Oscar voting begins on March 2, and it’s a tight five days voting closes on March 7. So that’s why everyone’s rubbing elbows at this luncheon. We’re really deep in the final hustle for votes. There’s votes everywhere. You got to get them. Then the accountants do their thing and the envelopes get sealed.\n\nGEMMA It sort of reminds me of that movie Bob Roberts and like the whole riding around on buses. And we in the writing round on buses full of journalists phase of award season,\n\nBRIAN we’re in the space where journalists are invited less and less than it’s only about the elites. Then the accounts do their thing and the envelopes get sealed after everyone’s rubbed elbows and I guess given each other signed, autograph, bred to try to get votes. Apparently that’s the expectation I’ve never heard about before, but I’ll go with it. But we’ll come back to the Oscars in a few minutes. We do have their CEO Bill Kramer waiting in the wings but the BAFTA is our next big ceremony this Sunday, February 19. In London,\n\nGEMMA I was looking at the eligibility rules for the betters and I like this detail from the new and improved rules that beverages and plunk laid in receptions and not permitted during voting round three. So I don’t know if that also excludes bread rolls, but I like the thought of very sober people making their choices between the benches of iniciar and Brian and Charles for outstanding British film. Both films that are made much better with a glass of starred\n\nMIA Gemma Can you clarify what plonk means?\n\nGEMMA For those who weren’t colonized by the British and brought up with their vernacular, yeah, booze, booze, Mia.\n\nMIA Ah, that’s the big difference between the BAFTA and the Golden Globes,\n\nBRIAN okay. And the Spirit Awards, which are brought to you by bullet whiskey.\n\nMIA So this brings us to the London Film Critics Circle speaking of British colonizers, so the last big Critics Award of the season really, they took place last week in London, just like Magic Mike’s Last Dance. And it seems like an incredibly lovely night full of bright young stars and Pip pip Cheerios. Me. I\n\nGEMMA feels like you’re stereotyping Brits.\n\nMIA It is an Anglo phobic stereotype. I was worried that that might be so please don’t cancel me. I’m sorry. I just liked the phrase Pip pip cheerio. I think it’s cute. It’s out of love. Tar was named film of the year at the London Critics Film Awards, making it only the fourth film in history to join a prestigious list of Best Picture winners among four major film critic associations, which are LA, New York, London, and the National Society of Film Critics. So here are the other history-making winners: Schindler's List, 1993, L.A. Confidential, 1997, The Social Network 2010 And now, TÁR 2022.\n\nBRIAN Schindler’s List was the only one of those that went on to win Best Picture from the Oscars. But that is a very nice list of bridesmaids, not the bride that tar is likely to join\n\nGEMMA O’Brien. I’m still holding out hope for Tara’s Best Picture.\n\nBRIAN Well, this type of data point is actually another area where I feel like award season is getting more likes, sports, bringing it back to sports here. While Schindler’s List is the only one of those that won best picture from the Oscars. All three of those did win Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars. Todd fields. Tar is in the original screenplay category at both the BAFTA and the Oscars. It’d be nice if he could win there. I think we all agree like he did at the London critics. Critics Circle in the rumblings that I’ve been hearing around Hollywood cocktails, which is nicer than plonk laden readings like my So, in the higher class realm, Cate Blanchett is keeping on the award season trail. Mostly what I’ve been hearing is that she’s mostly been approaching this award season as trying to help Todd field more than herself. She likes to take a step back from where she isn't a best actress. She’s one, but she would really like to see Todd join her in the ranks of winning. So her London critics speech was certainly pretty short. She said that she was just there to introduce Todd. So maybe she’s starting to have her Frances Fisher era where she’s going to eventually just say, you know, Martin McDonagh has already won a BAFTA and an Oscar. So let’s give Todd this because it took him 16 years to make a movie.\n\nMIA And what a movie that came out. I see why it took 16 years. I’m just saying.\n\nGEMMA Yeah, yeah, yeah, honestly. And that screenplay and like the whole preamble to the screenplay, where he’s like, this might look like it’s gonna be this many minutes, but it’s actually this many minutes because of what the music’s gonna do in it, and I just love it anyway. It’s interesting that because Kate is reportedly opposed to the spotlight on her, the season perhaps leaves space for Michelle Yeoh to take home? The BAFTA for leading actress if it doesn’t go to the also very deserving Viola Davis or Daniel dead while I’m at the very least, though, for Michelle, the London Film critics gave her the Dallas Powell Award for Excellence in film. Brian, you asked me before the show who Dulles pal was and I’m so glad you asked because I had a look. And she’s my new favorite ghost. Dulles was the film critic at the Sunday Times for around five decades from 1939 What a year to start as a film critic, and she was an absolute champion for the art of cinema. Her manifesto reads like a sort of ardent litterbox member might be crude to say, but I don’t care. A fabulous blog by Frederick on film that I read tells us that the first one out of the Dallas Powell award was Dirk Bogarde. and fit it writes that Dirk wrote a beautiful introduction to the golden screen, which is a collection of 50 years of pals writing that’s now very much on my birthday wish list. He wrote about his friendship with Powell. Here’s a sample playing a small part and a not very remarkable French film. She said of me turtley but not unkindly. Given too little to do. Mr. Boga does far too much. And he goes on to say, which was precisely what I did and how I learned from that phrase, they became friends and remained so for life. It’s Satan’s meow, Brian, I would love to know which actor you would love to become friends with by writing some spicy letterbox Ricans about their performance.\n\nMIA Oh, I mean, who remembers when I watched every single Robert Pattinson movie, all 28 of them. And I had, some of those were real flops. So I would have to say some spicy stuff about that guy. And I think he’s cool enough that he would understand and actually respect me for it. So my answer, Brian.\n\nBRIAN I mean, I guess I have to say Kyrsten Dunst because she’s on my bucket list. And I did. I’ve written so many nice reviews about her and I did have an interview lined up for her with shock that was canceled after reviews came out. So I would, I would like to I like to think that the very nice things that I’ve written could eventually Wow, Brian\n\nMIA choosing peace.\n\nGEMMA I love that a lot and you know, becoming lifelong friends. I just love Dirk saying and how I learned from that phrase. I mean, you know, that’s what film criticism is for right I love. I love the fact that I've just discovered Dulles Powell. I’m excited about my future with delicious writing. But back to Michelle Yeoh. I’m excited. Drumroll please. A little plug here for something that we’ve done with our friends in London. Many of you will have heard of girls on tops tees, a small collective that began as an idea. What if we could have filmmaker T shirts, just like we were banned T shirts, right? It’s a completely genius idea in their tiny group of friends who pour their profits into writing by women and non binary writers on film, and I obviously proudly own the Jane Campion T. Meow. Do you have one?\n\nMIA Yes, yes, I do. I have the Julia do corno one, which I purchased when feminist body horror masterpiece T bone came out last year. And I am about to add another one to my collection with this Michelle Yeoh release so girls on tops have done a few collabs over the years and they came to us long before award season about a collaborative T celebrating V. Michelle yo. And that was obviously a no brainer because Michelle is in the words of a letter by next member Cresa Maeve beer. The most balletic, beautiful badass ever to grace the screen and hi kick her way into our hearts. So yep, you are about to see Michelle Yos name across many chests in the distinctive girls on tops. black text on white standby for the drop and order your own T directly from girls on tops keys.com.\n\nGEMMA Brian, do you have girls on tops that you wear on your top?\n\nBRIAN I do. It says Sandy Powell who is my favorite costume designer of all time, she also wants to dress. Cate Blanchett probably more than once but I’m thinking of *Carol*l’s specifically. So I’m bringing it back to Cate Blanchett, who did when at the London critics and at the London critics there was also an acting sweep for The Banshees of Inisheer? There was a tie for foreign language film between Decision to Leave and The Quiet Girl. Also Aftersun won a couple of gongs including breakthrough British Irish filmmaker for its writer director Charlotte Wells and young British Irish performer for Frankie choreo. And the letterbox fav Florence Pugh, one British Irish Actress of the Year for her body of work and Don’t Worry Darling. Glad to see that get mentioned somewhere for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and The Wonder.\n\nMIA Sticking to the UK the BAFTA does for this weekend. That show will be aired on the BBC and in other territories like the US on the britbox app. They’ll be hosted by the hallways delightful Richard II grant. Ah,\n\nBRIAN I’m gonna give a little tea leaf tip to listeners because there’s a ton of overlap between the membership at both the BAFTA as in the academy itself, particularly in the acting branch. So if any of the places were [The Banshees of Inisheer] and nominated in the big categories, it's not when it’s a good indicator of who might be the frontrunner from here for it. For instance, if Austin Butler beats Colin Farrell for Elvis versus Collin’s The Banshees of Inisheer, then Butler is probably the front runner in the homestretch.\n\nGEMMA Well, speaking of Elvis and the colonel, that great volley, I was really interested in some paperwork changes that the drafters have made, they’ve added new eligibility requirements for next year. So BAFTA is introducing a mandatory anti bullying and harassment policy requirement as part of eligibility for all of its awards from 2024 onwards. So for the film awards, this means that UK based production companies will be required to have a policy in place, like as they’re producing the film, to take on issues of bullying and harassment on seat and I guess in the wider production of a film, in order to be able to enter the two UK only categories outstanding British film, and outstanding debut of a British writer, director or producer.\n\nMIA Ah, okay, so this is just a UK stipulation and other countries' productions can continue to bully and harass to their heart’s content. Wow, great.\n\nBRIAN Lydia Tar is safe here as the American expat in Germany. She can continue to do what she does. But in all seriousness, the Oscars themselves are doing an eligibility requirement that is also kicking into gear next year. So beginning in 2020, eligibility for the Best Picture Oscar will be subjected to new representation and inclusion requirements announced by the Academy back in September 2020. So they’ve had four years to prepare for this. Are you ready? mm from 2024 Onward, a film must meet two of the four of the following standards to be deemed eligible for best picture on screen representation, diversity and the creative leadership and project team diversity and industry access and opportunities, which is paid apprenticeships or internships or representation and development, marketing and distribution.\n\nGEMMA Haha. So for all of those who say, our words don’t matter, they’re just silly. Why are you doing an entire podcast season called Best and show focusing on awards? There’s a bit of reverse engineering going on here. Right. So in order to be eligible for an Oscar or BAFTA, you have to not be a dick. And like, honestly, frankly, two out of four ain’t hard. It should be four out of four. It’s what all New Zealand films have to do to meet our public funding guidelines and many other film Commission’s around the world have the same rules. I think it’s neat.\n\nMIA I do too. And speaking of neat, it is time to meet Lee step behind the curtain for a chat with the man behind the Oscars curtain. Ooh. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences not only puts on the Oscars and Bryan’s fancy luncheon every year, but it also extends invites for film professionals from all ranks to join as members and serve various governorships. Plus, it also runs a museum in the heart of Los Angeles, where I can pop in anytime to see the handwritten script for Thelma & Louise or the Rosebud sled from Citizen Kane.\n\nBRIAN Or buy the Spike Lee socks that I’m wearing right now.\n\nMIA Yes, or the Agnes Varda magnet on my fridge\n\nGEMMA Or the bread rolls signed by Lydia Tar.\n\nMIA What’s that in the academy Museum? It is a year round job for many including their new CEO Bill Kramer, whom Brian and I were lucky enough to chat with about all the behind the scenes happenings, but also Pedro Almodovar, Double Indemnity , and the killer AI robot, M3GAN. Well, first off, thank you so much for being here, Bill Kramer, we really appreciate it. And and thank you for bringing the academy onto letterboxed and letting us be a part of the luncheon and everything, it means the world,\n\nBILL KRAMER we are so excited. We’re super fans. We love what you guys are doing. We sit in the same space, and it’s just so exciting. to partner with you. You’re going to help us in so many ways. So I’m extremely grateful. So thank you. I\n\nMIA is going to be attending my very first Oscars this year.\n\nBILL KRAMER All right. You’re gonna have so much fun.\n\nMIA Thank you. Yeah, I wanted to ask you about your first Oscar ceremony that you attended. Can you tell me anything about that and reminisce?\n\nBILL KRAMER Oh my gosh, it feels like yesterday, it was in 2012. That was the year of Hugo and The Artist. I remember the wind that I was most excited about was for A Separation, which I think is just a flawless film. And it won Best International. But it was as glamorous and dynamic and compelling and exciting as I thought it would be. And I still feel that way about the show. But attending in person is sort of out of body experience. You can’t believe that you’re in the room with everyone, you know, it’s not just the celebrities, but you know, visual effects artists and cinematographers who you love, they’re standing right there. It’s hard not to fanboy out over everybody that you’re standing in the middle of the room with but it's just so amazing to bring the industry together. It’s all about the arts and sciences and the artists of moviemaking. And you know, we’re bringing all of the awards back on air live this year. We just won't give away too much. But we just spent about a half a day with our show producers going over the board, each act of the show, and it’s looking incredible and very much focused on the disciplines, the collaborations that go into moviemaking.\n\nBRIAN And you brought up that you’re bringing back all the awards live, televised live again this year. I’m curious what is that relationship listening to feedback from the audience at home and people in your community that you’d take to heart?\n\nBILL KRAMER That’s a great question, because I think it opens up that conversation around stakeholder groups. There’s so many people who engage with the Oscars, right? It’s sort of like concentric circles. And I’ll start with the one that’s closest to our membership. We have over 10,000 members, international members who are engaged in moviemaking, we’ve branches of the academy connected to editing, cinematography, costume, design, acting, all of the disciplines that go into movie making, that’s what our membership is, and they were not thrilled. And I should back up and say, I appreciate the experiment. I think this was an attempt to see if the show could look and feel a little different. I don’t think it was fully effective, but I appreciate the try. And then we listened to the feedback. So sometimes you have to do something to really understand if it’s going to work. We talked about this in the abstract for many years. But our mission or our core values at the academy is about equity across branches and disciplines. And we never want to make one branch feel like they’re less important than another branch. There’s no movie without hair and makeup. There is no movie without sound design. So I think it sets a strange tone and perhaps not the right message. But we’re pulling that back in and all of the awards are live on air. And that’s how it should be. So you know, our members are much happier. But I also think the viewing public if done properly, if it doesn’t extend the show for 40 hours, which it’s not going to, it can be entertaining, and dynamic and exciting. And we didn’t save time last year, that was the interesting part of it. So why not pull it into the show? And organically habits integrated into the conversation all of those eight awards that were pulled off? So I think it’s going to help with our membership, the film industry, film lovers, and people who watch the Oscars to learn about movie making?\n\nMIA Yes, I am so happy that they’re all going to be televised live again. And speaking of Will there be live music performances at this year’s Oscars, I have to ask them, a major Mitski fan and she and David Byrne are nominated. So\n\nBILL KRAMER I know the definite answer. But I don’t want to give away too much. But all I can say is that I think you’ll be very happy. I think you’ll be very happy. And it is exciting to think about, you know, Gaga, Rihanna, David Byrne, they’re going to be on stage at the Oscars if this all works out. And that is the plan. But it’s been a great year for music and film.\n\nMIA Which roles in the filmmaking community, would you maybe like to see have a larger presence in the Academy membership? You know, since we’re celebrating all aspects,\n\nBILL KRAMER all branches are equal. We love all of our children equally. It’s funny, you know, when we open the museum, everyone asks, \"What's your favorite object or exhibition?\" But I think it’s really important to save this, you know, we have to look at this in an equitable way. And again, if there’s no movie without the costume designers, or the director or the producer or the executives, you know, so they all need to grow and evolve in tandem. And what’s so fascinating now that I’m CEO of the academy, and I’m working with our membership in a different way. And you’re working with them on guidelines and rules for their branches and new members coming into their branches. You know, we have branch executive committees that are constantly thinking about how our discipline is evolving? And how do we open up our lenses a bit to think about new components of cinematography or sound design that need to be included when we’re considering people for membership, and how we’re defining our branch. So there’s this sense of evolution and inclusivity that is happening consistently across branches. That’s very exciting. So instead of saying, you know, I’d like to see more of one branch. I like seeing all of the branches evolve, and that’s what they do. That's how our members, you know, take their roles as members very seriously. Our governors do, our branch executive committee members do and they’re committed to evolving these areas. So I think we'll constantly see the industry itself constantly see this evolution, and we should be the academy that, if we’re doing our jobs properly, will be reflective of that change.\n\nMIA I’m glad you brought up the academy museum because I love it. I’ve been there maybe like four or five times since it opened. Ya know, it’s one of my favorite places to go in LA. So I'm not going to ask what your favorite exhibit is. Don’t worry, but I am curious. Which room would you hunker down and live in because I’d be in the Almodovar room?\n\nBILL KRAMER Oh, man, can you see you stole my thunder? If we’d hang on for one second? Yeah, no, I’m not on camera except for the two of you. But I should have had this at the ready. But no one’s seen this yet. But our Pedro Almodovar catalog, wow. That is all about that installation. We worked on it with Pedro who was so, of course, as amazing as you think he’s going to be. He's the best and was so thoughtful and collaborative and kind and creative. And that gallery installation is such a reflection of the work that Pedro did with two of our curators, Raul Guzman and Jenny, he and I could live in that room. And I have to say when I was running the museum, there were days where I would take my laptop before the museum nope it or after hours or if it was quiet and you know, sit on one of the benches in there and just answer some emails. I just needed to be around that energy. And I’m a lifelong Almodovar fan. The whole thing is a thrill and we’re looking to tour that gallery. We’re starting to have some conversations around that because it will be rotating out of the museum in about a year. But so proud of every inch of space and the museum. Jacqueline’s storage who’s now running the museum is just remarkable. This weekend. I don’t know if you attended any of our regeneration summits, but it was a three day kind of gathering with screenings and panel discussions around the history of black cinema, tied to our massive and epic and beautiful exhibition regeneration, black cinema from 98 to 1971. So if you haven’t seen that, please do. It’s so powerful, so beautiful. But if I’m picking one space to live in, it’s the Almodovar space.\n\nMIA Those blues those reds. Oh, yeah, it’s him\n\nBILL KRAMER you feel like you’re in one of his films without being too on the nose and got it? Well, we had wonderful designers srauta our owl who leads our exhibition design, really led the focus of, you know, the design of the space in the museum and, and I love hearing your impression of the museum because you’re obviously a movie lover and have great knowledge of cinema. But I’ve often found pre opening the academy Museum, that sometimes film exhibitions left me a little cold. You know, the thrill of watching a movie in a theater is you know, you’re watching the art in its final form. Gallery, a gallery space around movie making a film exhibition should be just as thrilling as sitting in a theater and watching your favorite movie. Otherwise, you’re going to lose the impact of the storytelling in space. And I do think Pedro’s installation captures the feeling of watching an albedo of our film that you’re learning about his process and his theme. So it’s educational, but it’s also dynamic and enjoyable.\n\nBRIAN I love that. We’re talking about Almodovar in a theater because actually my answer to this question is that Almodovar has talked to her the only time that I’ve ever watched a movie twice in the same day in the theater.\n\nBILL KRAMER The last hour in that movie, I’ve seen it so many times. And it’s just stunning. It’s a masterpiece.\n\nBRIAN Yeah. And so I have to ask because we actually get asked this frequently through our social media. How does the academy verify that its members are watching the nominated films?\n\nMIA I just want to say I picture you keeping them in a room for seeing their eyes open A Clockwork Orange style.\n\nBILL KRAMER Like A Clockwork Orange, exactly. But we do have eye drops for everyone. So no one’s done. So we have the academy screening room. And for certain categories International Animated. to opt in to voting for the shortlist, you have to have watched X percent of the movies that are eligible for nomination. Your branch executive committees track this, our international feature film committee tracks this, there’s a little bit of an honor system so we can track what happens in the academy screening room. But we also ask our members, if you didn’t watch it there. Where did you watch it? And when. So it’s a little bit of tracking a little bit of an honor system. But we hope that everyone is being totally honest about that. Right?\n\nBRIAN I’m a huge KEARSON dance fan. So I loved last year when she said that it’s our duty as an Academy member to watch everything. Yes,\n\nBILL KRAMER I mean, please, this is not a hardship is the duty of a member to do this at voting, people should take it very seriously. Or if you’re having a year where you’re on set, and you’re working a lot and you can’t watch a lot of the shortlisted films, you know, people will opt out sometimes. And I think that’s the responsible thing to do. I would say the members who I work with closely take their responsibility very seriously.\n\nMIA While we're on the subject of, of our favorite films. So Bill, we have researched you and we learned a couple of things about your favorite films.\n\nBILL KRAMER By the way, that list can change depending on the day for all of us some sure\n\nMIA Oh, yes, absolutely. But I got to bring up Klute especially I have\n\nBILL KRAMER a big blue poster right here. You do\n\nMIA so so the other films I just had to say Klute first but Klute, Double Indemnity, Tokyo Story, The Lady Eve, Sweet Smell of Success. So these are amazing choices. But which films had the greatest impact on you as an audience member?\n\nBILL KRAMER So I’ll choose one of those will two of them Tokyo Story. And I love the fact that more and more you’re seeing this film on Top 10 Top 100 lists. Ozu is a master of composition. I’m a very visually driven person. So I remember seeing that film for the first time when I was a kid. I’m not young. And thinking, Oh, filmmakers are like painters or architects and they’re creating, they’re composing a scene, a set. And that composition sends a signal to the audience. And of course, if you went to film school, you get that. Or if you are more knowledgeable about cinema history, you get that at the time, I did not. And it made me start exploring the components of moviemaking and the psychology behind how scenes are framed and shots. And that’s a very sort of straightforward film to discuss when it comes to cinematography and production, design, and set decoration. Because it’s very thoughtful, and I think it’s very apparent to the eye. But I’m also, you know, obsessed with architecture, and the sort of use of space and the characters' placement in space, said so much. So that was a moment where I started looking at movies differently. And it’s just so beautiful. And the story is so universal. Double Indemnity was the first time again. The first time I saw it was decades ago. I have to say, where I’m living now, my husband and I have a house in the Hollywood land developments. So we’re sort of under the Hollywood side. And we live a few houses away from the house that Barbara Stanwyck lived in and Dublin, the, and when we were going to look at this house, I almost drove right into it, I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. It was like a fever dream. But I love that film for so many reasons, but I think she’s a genius. And just the way she uses her body and her humor, you know that both that character and just Stanwick as an actress was so compelling to me. And so both funny and dangerous, like great film noir. All of those elements are there. But it’s also a nod to a moment in LA history. That’s very interesting to me. And, you know, I love looking at La history through, you know, historical films, especially of that era.\n\nBRIAN We talked about doing a little research on some of your favorite films. But we also wanted to ask something that we couldn’t research, which is, and we did this for ourselves at the start of this year, which is case, but you’re in charge of the biggest awards nomination group in the world. But we’re curious what is an award that you won early on? That was small. So for instance, like I went to the hustle award for basketball, Mia won her example she got a little trophy for guessing the Oscars the most right was it last year so we’re sure\n\nMIA I did. I got a trophy for it. No big deal.\n\nBRIAN What? What is it? What is a minor trophy that you’ve gotten?\n\nBILL KRAMER Oh, my Oh my gosh, I mean, I was a big baseball player as a kid and won lots of little league trophies. But I can’t think of one specifically by title. But I’ll say something embarrassing. About a superlative I went to, it wasn't a trophy. But I was voted most cheerful in my high school, which is something I’m teased about constantly by all of my friends from high school, but that was sort of, you know, I feel like with little league trophies, everyone gets a star. You know that didn’t that didn’t matter that much. But when that happened, that kind of solidified a running joke that has not stopped for almost 50 years now.\n\nBRIAN That’s a great superlative.\n\nMIA Yeah, we need more cheer in the Oscars. We need more cheer everywhere.\n\nBILL KRAMER Everywhere. Yeah, absolutely.\n\nMIA Speaking of trophies, I gotta get into Oscars history a little bit. So there have been six ties. And if you could add a seven, which performance or film would you bestow an Oscar to without taking away the winner?\n\nBILL KRAMER Oh, so interesting. I mean, I have a million of those running through my head. I have to be careful here. Yes, exactly. Esteemed Academy membership. But Lupita’s performance in Us a few years ago, where it was really two performances, to me is just a master class in acting and so surprising. And I’ve seen that film so many times because I just want to watch her act. I would love to retroactively go back and have her share the award with you but I think about that as a miss. But you know, look, it’s all subjective. Yeah, people feel many ways. But I feel like that was an acting, exercise and performance of notes that sort of went unnoticed that season. And not just by us, but it just didn’t hit with critics or with critics at dibba with oh, you know, the awards cycle. It didn’t seem to be as much and I just think she’s wrong. markable and I thought that performance was just just beyond anything I’d seen\n\nBRIAN before. yet. I think when we look at additional membership, a lot of people focus on certain areas. But I think horror as a genre is something that we’ll start to see, like, build its way into this space.\n\nBILL KRAMER I hope. So that’s a great point. I wasn’t even really thinking about that. But I think you’re right. I mean, I think what’s been so interesting, over the last year, especially as people are, I’m putting, I’m doing air quotes with the viewers at home coming back to the theaters. I know, we’re not where we were before the pandemic, but horror plays well in theaters. And we want people to go to the movies, we want people to see movies in theaters. And I feel like we’re seeing horror, even Megan, which is sort of a comedy horror. But you know, I loved seeing that in a theater with an audience. And I’m hoping more and more, our members will take horror as a genre seriously, beyond just maybe technical aspects of a horror or thriller, not just horror, but thriller films as well. Because, you know, to create that sort of tension, and to create that feeling in the audience is incredibly difficult. And we shouldn’t diminish the value of these films. But I do think we have some directors already starring one of them who I think are doing really interesting things in that genre. And sort of elevating it in ways that may make it more palatable for the award circuit. I hope so\n\nMIA nice to see Megan getting some Academy friends. Yeah.\n\nBILL KRAMER Wonderful. Allison Williams. Oh, yeah. Along with res dinar nominations. And now. Yes,\n\nMIA yes. Oh, we watched? Yes.\n\nBILL KRAMER I had no, I no doubt. I had no doubts. But you know, we love that movie. You know, Jason Blum is very close to the academy. Love what he’s doing. He’s keeping the industry so fresh and exciting and developing new generations of movie goers. So, you know, we need more of this. We need more of this.\n\nMIA So as we tragically reached the end of our chat, wow, one more last. I know time flies when you’re having fun. Once the Oscar ceremony is over, what is your after party? How do you unwind, let off that steam.\n\nBILL KRAMER I never unwind. I’ve always been at work, you know, I have an amazing husband. We have a great social life. We’re big Pilates Devo Tez. So that’s a huge stress reliever for me constantly. It’ll be a stress reliever the day before the Oscars, so that never stops. You know, post Oscars is a moment for us to really reflect the arc. We have a fiscal year but really be thinking about the cycle of the academy which, you know, Oscars to Oscars, we’re going to be doing a lot of thinking post Oscars about what’s next, about campaign regulations and things that we have to look into. How are we evolving the industry? So you leave that show, and I promise to relax, and we’re going through things that were too much. But I enjoy this work and it is fun for me. But I want to use that time, along with all of our amazing committees, and our governors and our amazing team at the academy to really think about the evolution of our institution. And what’s next? So, you know, I think there’s a lot of exciting thinking and doing work that will set us up for future shows, and beyond. And also, you know, the Academy, we do so much more than just the Oscars. We have amazing talent development programs, our museum, we have the largest film related collection in the world, at our library in our archive and museum. So that work is 365 days a year. And you know, we turn a lot of our attention to that after the show so there will be some chilling out but not that much.\n\nBRIAN Mia mentioned that she she gets to go with Gemma to the press room for this I turned down being able to go because I actually do I feel like I need to not work for a little bit and I want to have it’s been 10 years since I could have people over to like watch the Oscars with me and I am so looking forward to doing that as a spectator again. FYI, oh,\n\nBILL KRAMER that's just as important as we need people watching the show are not all of the TVs in your house until all the same. What we’ve seen so far is the set design, the red carpet, the lineup of presenters, you know, this commitment to really digging into the disciplines of moviemaking. I think it’s going to be a really fantastic night Jimmy has been amazing to work with and his team. I love the return to serve as someone who’s used to doing live television. I think that really grounds the show. I thought Trevor Noah did a great job at the Grammys last night for the same reason. So you’ll have to let us know how we looked on TV.\n\nBRIAN We’ll do it. I'm looking forward to it. I hope Meghan is there.\n\nBILL KRAMER I’m not giving any we’re gonna have Megan and Cocaine Bear going on.\n\nMIA Well, every award show has that moment when the lighting rig comes down from the rafters the confetti is swept away. The chairs are stacked in the last balloon drops as two people quietly hook up in the darkened corner. That’s right. It’s after party time. Gemma Brian, it is Valentine’s Day when this episode drops. So we are revisiting Academy non award winner Down With Love, which stars Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. It’s 20 years old this year and was directed by Ant-Man director Peyton Reed. But why is it relevant to award season Gemma?\n\nGEMMA I mean honestly. Just look at litter box reviews to make anything relevant to anything. For example, here are two reviews from last week on the Letterboxd of downward love. Jamie Carrick writes five stars. I would like to live in the universe where David Hyde Pierce won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this film. So what I end with ABS asks, How do I get this to win Best Picture at the 2023 Oscars only movie ever. And then Cassie tagged Best in Show and they reviewed it because we did warn you last week we’d be watching this. This is peak cinema. The swanky soundtrack, colorful set design and cheeky humor are top notch Renee and her performance absolutely delightful and I would sell my soul to have Barbara Novak’s apartment and her wardrobe.\n\nBRIAN Oh if we’re highlighting reviews, I have to jump on the David Hyde Pierce train with a little side of Sarah Paulson love mixed in via the fondest review, which concludes with love to see queer actors who are pretending to be straight have way more chemistry than the straight leads. Now in regards to awards, Renee Zellweger did win her first Oscar the same year in a different movie but it was for 2000 fours Best Supporting Actress for Cold Mountain. But Down With Love did win the much coveted AARP movies for grownups best movie time capsule award in 2000 for\n\nMIA your favorite Awards, the AARP.\n\nBRIAN It was up against Seabiscuit and A Mighty Wind, Parker Posey. Elvis ****won that award this year. And generally that award does seem to be given for nostalgic reasons. But the time capsule here is appropriate because Down With Love is not just set in the early 60s, but it’s recreating the sex comedy of the era. It’s like the ultimate time capsule.\n\nMIA Yes, absolutely. And specifically, it’s a campy and cheeky send up of the Doris Day and Rock Hudson, quote, no sex, sex comedies of that time period. Now with the category that we’re highlighting it in the coveted Time Capsule award of 2004. It also won the award that I created for this show, the heart rate award. For listeners who might be missing my little game I brought it back just for Down With Love. So a mighty wind has the highest average of those nominees you mentioned with the 3.6 but Jack’s fax has given us the envelope and Down With Love as a higher percentage of logs with a heart appropriate for this Valentine’s Day episode, don’t you think?\n\nGEMMA Absolutely. Absolutely. And before we get into our own love of the movie for those listeners who didn’t watch or rewatch it in the past week, we are no doubt going to watch it this Valentine’s now because of us. Can you give us a little background, a little synopsis, Mia?\n\nMIA Oh, Gemma, it would be my pleasure and my honor. So set in early 1960s New York City our protagonist is feminist author Barbara Novak, played by Rene, who has just published a book called Down With Love which proposes that in order to get ahead in the workplace, women must reject romantic love and embrace sex ala carte ladies man man’s man man about town catcher block played by a swoonworthy. Ewan is a playboy journalist for a men’s magazine and he decides to go undercover to write an expo on Barbara by making her fall for him. In what follows is a screwball cocktail of mistaken identities, Suave innuendo, dazzling 60s fashion and lots and lots of chocolate. So let’s get down with Down With Love.\n\nGEMMA Okay, so the first and most important and pretty much the only thing I have to say about dealing with love is that its letterbox rating average is a perfect 3.5 It sits magnificently atop the gym aligned as it should. What does 3.5 signify you ask? I think a lot of people don’t realize what I mean by this by The fact that it’s the perfect rating, but as any cinephile in their right mind knows a 3.5 film as a five star film that’s just misunderstood. Yes.\n\nBRIAN I even if I ever see a three and a half rating for any of my trusted people is Instant Watch list because that paint cube is entirely worth everyone’s time exactly.\n\nGEMMA But more excitingly, this is one of the films we call a high riser here at letterbox. So back when we began, those who were writing this film generally gave it an average of three out of five. It’s risen steadily over time, it’s showing no signs of dropping off and looking into the backstage sets. I’ve noticed a significant rise in five star ratings over the past year. What do you put that down to?\n\nMIA Maybe my placement of it in my top four? I think I can take all the credit for this one. And I would like to go no, no, no, but So 2003 was not a particularly feminist friendly or, you know, like gay camp friendly moment in American culture. And I do feel it was widely misunderstood by both mainstream audiences and critics alike upon release. But it’s funny and sexy and smart, which are the three best things to be and easily my favorite non Hugh Grant rom com. So it is very gratifying and validating for me to know that a cultural reevaluation is in progress.\n\nGEMMA It’s so true, and we have the data to back it up. So you know, it’s true, Brian, bring it home, bring it home with your dad with love, appreciation.\n\nBRIAN While this, I rewatched it. This is my third rewatch, but I get extra credit because this is the first time that I’ve ever watched this after actually seeing Pillow Talk. I’m trying so hard to not say The Pillow Book, which is a different Ewan McGregor 616 inch hose movie. So this is the first I’ve always really loved Down With Love. But I’ve kind of always had the same reading on it as like the first 45 minutes. I’m always like, this is the best movie comedy that has ever been made. And it reminds me so much. Everyone brings up The Pillow Book for this, but it reminded me or sorry, everyone brings up Pillow Talk.\n\nGEMMA I mean, we’ve all got you and The Pillow Book on your mind. Don’t worry about it, yeah.\n\nBRIAN I mean, it’s great. That’s a three and I gave three and a half to The Pillow Book by the way, but everyone brings up Pillow Talk for this. But what I respond to most is what it seems like it’s recreating the Frank Tashlich Jane Mansfield movies, which are very cartoonish, way more overtly sexual. And you’ll see milk jugs explode and things like that. Because she's so attractive, The Girl Can’t Help It. And it really embraces rock and roll. And it’s kind of very different from the Doris Day movies of the period because I think it is a little more sex positive or attraction pot forward leaning, which a lot of the beginning of Down With Love is, but then it does kick into where it basically is like a recreation of Pillow Talk, which is the mistaken identities. And so now that I’ve seen Pillow Talk, and like, oh, it’s actually like, yeah, it completely segues into doing that. And I love Down With Love throughout. But I kind of like the first half of that movie. It is absolutely perfect. The rest is very, very, very good. But I think I respond more to the Frank Taslan type.\n\nGEMMA So 5025 minutes 3.5 stars for the rest Yeah,\n\nBRIAN which gives it a magnificent four star rating from me. i And i Wow, I didn’t\n\nGEMMA know my math was I was gonna say which gives it a 7.5 out of five so you know smashing it out of the park as\n\nMIA five yes, that math seems correct. That’s what I will give it. Gemma, do you have any additional thoughts?\n\nGEMMA Only that every time you and McGregor comes on a screen my brain goes.\n\nMIA Oh, he had his dark hair and his swab suits when he bites into the chocolate. Oh, I can't, I cannot think about this. I have to distract myself. Like it’s\n\nGEMMA is so insane that you just have to hear his voice. And Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio is a silly little cricket and feels horny?\n\nBRIAN Well, I think that that actually because yeah, around the 45 minute mark is when he switches to his fake text and voice and then we rely on David Hyde Pierce and Sarah Paulson to give us all the sexual Verve back because it just droops when he starts talking with his tie\n\nGEMMA I’m on board with the fake exit media do you do you how do you feel about you and McGregor talking or singing or just like existing?\n\nMIA I’m positive on all fronts extremely positive. This is my favorite role of his sorry Moulin Rouge! I’m sorry. Sorry, this is my un This is my un so I have a meow fact. Too tight. Yes, yes, it’s true. I’m breaking into the fact business. Two time Oscar winner Renee Zellweger and future Oscar nominee hopefully you and McGregor specifically requested to sing an EN credit song because he was in Moulin Rouge! and she was in Chicago which are both Academy Award winning musical See, we’re tying it into award season look at that brought\n\nGEMMA it all home you brought it all home therefore down with love as effectively an Academy Award winning film.\n\nMIA Yes, we have declared itself\n\nGEMMA Alright, it is time to put a pin in the little helium balloon I’ve done with love and, and move on from Valentine’s Day and in step step sideways into our final segment player of the season, which is where we mentioned a person or an organization or, or an event or something that’s happened in the last week and the award season landscape that notches, film culture forward, even just a little bit. So do we have any nominees this week for player of the season?\n\nMIA Yes, I would like to read two sections from the women kings director Gina Prince Brightwood, who wrote for The Hollywood Reporter about the lack of nominations for black directed movies, particularly those made by women, we just very clearly saw that social capital is more valuable than studio power. That type of power is exercised in more casual ways in social circles, where folks are your friends or your acquaintances, there may be diversity on your sets, but not in your lives. And black women in this industry. We don’t have that power. There is no groundswell from privileged people with enormous social capital to get behind black women, there never has been. Also, I think about my crafts people, they did extraordinary work. And for most of them, it was their first time in a film of this size, I had to fight to get them on my crew, because they didn’t have the resume having an academy award or any of these Guild Awards on their resumes, the next time they go up for a job, they don’t have to have that fight. But when we’re not afforded this type of recognition, so many of them have to start back at square one.\n\nGEMMA So true. And look, if litterbox members were Academy voters, The Woman King has a stonking 3.8 average. It’s been seen by almost 100,000 members, and the reviews alone. You know, while they’re not the trophy, because obviously you need the trophy to get the opportunities, but I just like to say Letterboxd hasn’t forgotten The Woman King.\n\nBRIAN And it’s important to note how our chat with Bill Kramer, the CEO of the Academy that we just heard from he keeps noting that the membership needs to continue to grow, but also try to investigate their own comfort zones with his genres and the filmmakers they’re supporting. Like he said, It’s a 365 day a year job. And it will be interesting to see what bylaws come at the end of this award season in regards to social capital campaigning. You should read the whole piece. We’ll drop it in the Episode Notes. But what Gemma has written in that final section that we read aloud as a perfect reminder that so much of the award season is about the jobs you get after you’re nominated. And it becomes less and less about the films we are talking about in the running, and more about every craft and crew person’s future jobs that they receive from this goodwill. And if you don’t have the same level access to begin with, you need Award nominations to get even further and bread rolls.\n\nGEMMA Access to bread rolls.\n\nMIA Signed by Lydia Tar. If anyone can save diversity, it’s Lydia Tar.\n\n[theme song ramps up, plays alone, fades out]\n\nMIA Thanks so much for listening to Best in Show, a limited awards season series brought to you by The Letterboxd Show.
