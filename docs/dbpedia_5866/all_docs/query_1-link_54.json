        "text": "Everyone loves to relax every now and then from their busy schedules at the yard or work... what better way (for us slightly overly obsessed horse lovers) to enjoy time out from the horses than watching horse related stuff?! (LOL).\n\nListed below are 10 equestrian films handpicked by us, that we think you'll quite enjoy!\n\n1. Black Beauty\n\n.\n\nBased off Anna Seawell's novel from 1877, Black Beauty is all about bravery and courage in both horses and humans, and the bond between the two. Spoken from the words of the horse himself as he faces many challenges growing up. There's even a little love story in there too.\n\n.\n\n2. The Horse Whisperer\n\n.\n\nAgain, based off the best-selling novel by Nicholas Evans (reviewed in our book blog) this movie follows a storyline where the mother wants freedom and happiness again for both her daughter and horse after a terrible car accident. The daughter (Grace) has lost all of her confidence and and her horse, Pilgrim is relating her to the accident. Anne finds a horse whisperer to help heal them together.\n\n.\n\n3. Seabiscuit\n\n.\n\nA storyline following three individuals; a homeless jockey, a millionaire a cowboy and a horse named Seabiscuit are the four characters in this film who find each other and continue onto to reach heroism. They find hope in each other when they think all has been lost and lead onto inspire many others whom similarly seek this goal. It showcases a glorious victory between the individuals, a triumph of challenges (both personal and as a team) and takes you on a roller-coaster of a true story about the power of hope and the courage you are able to find to make anyone’s dreams come true. This film will take you on a ride like no other.\n\n.\n\n4. Dreamer\n\n.\n\nBen Crane believes that a injured horse he has found deserves the second chance to live. Ben and his daughter Cale adopt the horse and save it of being sacrificed and killed by the owner. The arrival of the horse to Crane's farm and home, becomes the seamless excuse for both father and daughter pair to reconstruct their bond having lost it many years ago. \"Soñador\" (Dreamer), the renamed mare that enters their lives and proves that despite its broken leg, there may be hope she could have another chance to return to the racecourse, with the help and guidance of Cale, Ben, and his father, Pop. This movie follows a strong storyline of family and bonding, and how horses can strengthen and repair lost bonds.\n\n.\n\n5. Warhorse\n\n.\n\nArguably one of the most iconic and internationally watched equine movies of the 2000’s is Warhorse. Warhorse follows the most heart-breaking yet loved stories of Joey and Albert. Albert's beloved horse 'Joey' is sold to the Cavalry by his Father as war begins. Joey has an unexpected journey across war torn Europe where he finds himself in France. Albert enlists himself in the British Army and is wounded during one of the many battles England had to face. Whilst recovering in Hospital, he becomes aware of a Horse that was earlier found in no man’s land. The storyline picks up and follows both Albert and Joey’s inspirational journeys through the war.\n\n.\n\n6. Horse girl\n\n.\n\nA dark and comical psychological thriller about a woman's search for her truth, however intangible it may be can be found within this film. The films follow socially separated Sarah, who is only content within the company of horses and her favourite supernatural crime shows. A series of weirdly bizarre dreams lead to Sarah struggling to understand the difference between her dreams and reality. A freaky psychological thriller more than an equestrian film, but there are horses! 16+ audiences only\n\n.\n\n7. Spirit\n\n.\n\nA wild stallion is captured by humans and slowly loses the will to resist training, yet, throughout his struggles for freedom, he refuses to let go of the hope of one day returning home to his herd. This movie follows a strong storyline of family and belonging. Spirit will never give up the hope of returning home, which is one of the strongest qualities he has, this film must not be missed.\n\n.\n\n8. Ride like a girl\n\n.\n\nThis is an incredible film that follows the inspirational story of a young female jockey in the racing world, who against all the odds of both men and the industry itself defeats them to inspire many and pave the way to a more equally viewed jockey industry. Michelle Payne is the youngest of ten children, her father is racehorse trainer, Paddy Payne. Almost all of Paddy's children have grown up to become jockeys and this is the story of the youngest daughter. Payne eventually succeeds in her journey and becomes the first woman to ride as the winner of the Melbourne Cup in 2015..\n\n.\n\n9. The Mustang\n\n.\n\nThe story of Roman Coleman, a violent convict, who is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs. Roman is put in a rehabilitation program run by rancher Myles that assigns prisoners with training wild mustangs. Each prisoner in the program is given a specific horse to train and Roman is required to complete the training within five weeks before his horse is sold at an auction. Roman initially struggles with the training of his mustang, but under the guidance of Henry, an inmate regarded as the top horse trainer, he begins to make progress. As the weeks pass, Roman becomes close with the horse, whom he names Marquis, and forms a friendship with Henry. One of the newest releases in this blog is arguably one of the best in cinematic and visual shots.\n\n.\n\n10. Dark Horse\n\n.\n\nIn a small town, a barmaid decides to breed a racehorse. She and her husband buy a broodmare and she asks other villagers to join in the cause. With the help of the villagers this horse goes on to win the Welsh Grand National. Following an inspirational true story of a group of friends from a working men's club who decide to take on the elite 'sport of kings' and breed themselves a racehorse, valuing the friendship between individuals and how powerful it can become when put to the test.\n\n.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this vast range of movies.\n\nWritten by Niamh\n\nEdited by Danielle"
