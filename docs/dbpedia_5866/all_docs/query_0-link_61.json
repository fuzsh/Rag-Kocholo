        "text": "For Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe Deacon (Denzel Washington), heading to Los Angeles should be a routine trip to simply get some evidence for a case. However, when he unofficially gets caught up in a serial killer investigation, it brings up painful memories while uncovering alarming secrets. Warner Bros., in conjunction with FlickDirect, wants to give one lucky individual the chance to win a watch party prize box for THE LITTLE THINGS Coming to theaters and HBO MAX on January 29, 2021. Also, five second-place winners will receive a Fandango code to see the film when it opens in theaters.\n\nTo enter for a chance to win one watch party prize box for THE LITTLE THINGS follow these two easy steps:\n\nSubscribe to the FlickThat!

Kern County Deputy Sheriff Joe \"Deke\" Deacon (Washington) is sent to Los Angeles for what should have been a quick evidence-gathering assignment. Instead, he becomes embroiled in the search for a killer who is terrorizing the city. Leading the hunt, L.A. Sheriff Department Sergeant Jim Baxter (Malek), impressed with Deke's cop instincts, unofficially engages his help. But as they track the killer, Baxter is unaware that the investigation is dredging up echoes of Deke's past, uncovering disturbing secrets that could threaten more than his case. The main cast also includes Natalie Morales (\"Battle of the Sexes\"), Terry Kinney (\"Mile 22,\" TV's \"Billions\"), Chris Bauer (\"Sully,\" TV's \"The Deuce\"), Joris Jarsky (TV's \"Bad Blood\"), Isabel Arraiza (TV's \"Pearson\") and Michael Hyatt (\"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\"). \"The Little Things\" is produced by Oscar- and Emmy-winning producer Mark Johnson (\"Breaking Bad,\" \"Rain Man\") and Hancock, with Mike Drake and Kevin McCormick serving as executive producers. Behind the scenes, Hancock reunited with several longtime collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography John Schwartzman (\"Seabiscuit,\" \"The Founder,\" \"Saving Mr. Banks\"), Oscar-nominated production designer Michael Corenblith (\"Apollo 13,\" \"The Founder,\" \"The Blind Side\") editor Robert Frazen (\"The Founder\"), and costume designer Daniel Orlandi (\"The Founder,\" \"The Blind Side\"). The music is by multiple Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman (\"1917,\" \"Bridge of Spies,\" \"Saving Mr. Banks\").\n\nThe contest ends on January 26, 2021.
