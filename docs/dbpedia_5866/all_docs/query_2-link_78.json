        "text": "Since it’s halfway through the year (well, maybe a little over halfway), I thought I’d try this post I saw done by NutFreeNerd because it just looked like fun! So here we go:\n\n1. What’s the best book you’ve read so far in 2014?\n\nThis is tricky because it’s hard to differentiate between a book that I thought was overall just an amazing novel and one that I most enjoyed. On one hand, there’s Eleanor & Park/Fangirl and the Cinder series by Marissa Meyer, both of which I enjoyed immensely, but then there’s also Sold by Patricia McCormick and The Handmaid’s Tale, which are both books by which I was utterly moved. So I guess I’ll have to just choose the one book that I both enjoyed and was incredulous over, and that would have to be We Were Liars by E. Lockhart.It’s so amazing, and you can read my review here.\n\n2. The best sequel you’ve read so far in 2014?\n\nI haven’t read a lot of sequels this year (which is probably related to my bad habit of only reading the first book in a series), but I will say that Cress by Marissa Meyer, the third installment of the Lunar Chronicles series, was absolutely incredible. I finished that huge book in one day because it was so addictingly good. Read my review of the first book in the series, Cinder, here!\n\n3. What’s a new release you haven’t read yet but want to?\n\nI’ve heard so many wonderful things about All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. I believe it’s a World War II story about two children, but I actually don’t know much more about it. I really want to read it, but usually try to wait until those thick adult fiction books come out in paperback since they’re just so expensive…so maybe for Christmas!\n\n4. What new release for the second half of the year are you most anticipating?\n\nThe last Pretty Little Liars book, Vicious by Sara Shepard, finally comes out in December…I seriously cannot wait to find out A’s identity at last! This series has droned on for ages, and just when you think it’s over, it’s not, so I have to admit that part of my excitement about this book is stemmed from my desire for it to just be over already. It seems like it really is wrapping up this time, though, so here’s to hoping!\n\n5. Your biggest book disappointment so far?\n\nPeople everywhere have been raving about Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe by Bejamin Såenz, so going into it, I thought for sure I’d be finding some new book love. It even won a Printz award, and a friend of mine said that it was one of the most amazing, feel-good books she’d ever read. But I actually really didn’t like it at all. It was too mopey and I just couldn’t click with it on any level. I think I just went into it expecting one thing and came out realizing it wasn’t at all what I thought or had wanted it to be.\n\n6. Your biggest surprise?\n\nEven though I do like John Green, I had a hard time connecting with any of his books except for The Fault in Our Stars, which I did really enjoy, but didn’t rave over the way it seems everyone else has. Looking for Alaska was good, but I didn’t love it, and I didn’t like Will Grayson, Will Grayson very much (it felt mopey to me). So when my friend insisted that I borrow and read Paper Towns, I figured I’d just do it so I could get her off my case about it. But I was amazed to find that I loved it! It was so fun, eccentric and adventurous, and I have the strangest crush on Quentin (he’s much cuter and sweeter than Augustus Waters, everyone! I swear!). So that was a happy surprise!\n\n7. Favorite new author (debut or just new to you)?\n\nHands-down, Rainbow Rowell. There are only a few authors whose work I am consistently obsessed with. Even some of my all-time favorite authors, like J.K. Rowling, can’t always hold my interest with every single book they write (I tried to get into The Casual Vacancy, and I appreciated it on a surface level, but I couldn’t rave about it overall). But I recently discovered Fangirl and Eleanor & Park, and now I can’t stop obsessing over all Rowell’s books. I just ordered Landline and am ecstatic at the thought of getting to read another of her books!\n\n8. A book that made you cry this year?\n\nI’ve had quite a few of those this year…Sold by Patricia McCormick made me sob for hours (it was utterly shattering and completely eye-opening. Check out my Rated Reads review of it here), Eleanor & Park left me heartbroken, and Allegiant just took all the emotion right out of me. But one book this year actually made me cry in public, so I think that ought to be the focus of my answer. I was on a trip with my friends and as we were driving, something about this book just got me and I totally started crying, but I was trying so hard to be quiet and not let them notice. When did I started shaking with sobs, though, it got pretty hard to hide, so they realized what was happening and immediately started making fun of me. It was such a sad, moving story, though, and it was The Impossible Knife of Memory by Laurie Halse Anderson. I should have known better than to try reading Laurie Halse Anderson in public, I suppose!\n\n9. Favorite book-t0-film adaptation you saw this year?\n\nBook-to-film adaptations are hard for me because I just can’t ever fully appreciate the movie. Some I can handle, like The Fault in Our Stars (because you just can’t not be a literature buff and not see it), but books that rank in my favorites, like The Book Thief, Ender’s Game, and The Giver, I just can’t bear to watch because they’ll ruin the imagination and emotion I have for the books. I know I should probably be more supportive of YA books becoming films, so I do try to go to them when I don’t have a strong attachment to the novel. Anyway, to answer the question, I saw Divergent in the theater and thought it was actually very well done. Shailene Woodley was better than I expected, and, of course, I loved Theo James!\n\n10. What book do you need to read by the end of the year?\n\nI need Winter by Marissa Meyer, but I have to wait until next year for that, unfortunately. So I’ll say that I need to read The Selection by Kiera Cass before the year is over so I can see what all the hype is about! I have it on my shelf and I’m excited to read it. It sounds like it’s a dystopian version of Princess Academy by Shannon Hale, which I loved as a kid, so I must read it by the end of the year!\n\nAnd there is my mid-year book update! Try it for yourself and let me know what your answers would be. Happy reading!\n\nTime for another BookTube tag! I saw this one posted by All the Books! and thought it was really fun, so I wanted to try it! The tag contains questions about books that are loosely related to each of the seven deadly sins. Let’s get started!\n\nGREED\n\nWhat is the most expensive book you own and what is the least expensive?\n\nMy most expensive book is one that I’d guess is probably the same for most people, and that is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J.K. Rowling. It probably cost around $30, but I bought it at the midnight premiere and it was worth every single penny!\n\nMy least expensive is sort of hard because I get a lot of free books through my position as a book reviewer, and then there are always those books that you just have from family members or friends. But I did find a copy of Little Bee by Chris Cleave for only 10 cents at a used bookstore in Nashville, so I’ll go with that!\n\nHonestly, though, I’ve done a lot of research over the years and I know how to get the cheapest prices possible on books. I’ve found that book sales (especially at libraries or schools) can save heaps of money, as well as used bookstores and, occasionally, Amazon. And I have to say, if there’s a best-seller you’re desperate to buy, forget Barnes & Noble and go to Target…their book prices are amazingly good! I save my B&N purchases for when I have coupons or gift cards or just really want to support an author because otherwise it’s so outrageously expensive.\n\nGLUTTONY\n\nWhat book or books have you shamelessly devoured many times?\n\nAgain, I have a feeling my answer will be similar to that of many others: the Harry Potter series! I’m not exaggerating, I’ve probably re-read the series at least 30 times in my life. I tended to do a lot of re-reading during my childhood, but I don’t do it as much anymore because I have such a long TBR list!\n\nSLOTH\n\nWhat book or series have you neglected simply out of laziness?\n\nLately, I’ve had this bad habit of starting the first book in a series, enjoying it, but then not following through with the remaining books. And it’s not because I don’t want to read the rest of the series, because I always totally do! I’ve just been too lazy to buy and read them, so I’m stuck in a cycle where I only read the first book in a series. So the series that I’ve neglected out of laziness would be…\n\nShatter Me by Tahereh Mafi\n\nI love Ransom Riggs, so when I went to a book signing and heard him talk about his wife and fellow author Tahereh Mafi, I knew I wanted to check out her books. After I did some research, I couldn’t believe I’d never heard of her before! I bought Shatter Me and had it on my shelf for awhile before getting to it, but when I did, I felt conflicted. One part of me wanted to absolutely gush over Tahereh Mafi’s writing style, and the other part of me wanted to throw the book down in annoyance over it. I’m a sucker for pretty, metaphorical writing, so at first, I was so enchanted by Mafi’s style. But after awhile, the metaphors became so excessive and completely, for lack of a better word, stupid. Same goes for the whole cross-out thing. I could not find any way to make sense of a majority of the symbolism Mafi tried to use, and I think she really is a good writer, but her talent was wasted on that book. I didn’t like Juliette, either, and I thought most of the characters except Warner were superficial and one-dimensional. That all probably came out way more harsh than I intended, though, because something about it did draw me in (I gave it a 3.5/5 stars on Goodreads) and I made a mental note to continue reading the series when I could, if only to find out how it ended. But, obviously, I haven’t yet. Let me know if you think it’s worth finishing because I’d be interested to know if it gets better!\n\nThe Unbecoming of Mara Dyer by Michelle Hodkin\n\nI loved this book (it totally gave me a We Were Liars vibe) and I thought it was so unique and well-written and mysterious. So of course I would continue reading the rest of the series, right? Nope, too lazy. I really do want to finish them, though, especially because I think the last book came out or will come out recently.\n\nPRIDE\n\nWhat book or books do you bring up when you want to sound like an intellectual reader?\n\nI think any classic is an obvious choice for this, so I’m going to change the question a little bit to allow for some diversity.\n\nIf you were in a job interview and were asked what you’d been reading recently, what book or books would you mention?\n\nFor this, I think I would bring up Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand.\n\nI like talking about this one because I was genuinely so moved by it, and I think it’s one of the most incredible stories on the market. I read non-fiction sparingly, so I was amazed by how much I loved this book. Laura Hillenbrand is good at presenting non-fiction stories in a more fiction-esque way, and even though sports books are not normally my cup of tea, I was blown away by Seabiscuit, as well.\n\nLUST\n\nAttractive male character attributes?\n\nIt sort of depends on the character! But I will say that my all-time fictional crushes are Kai from Cinder, Peeta from The Hunger Games, Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice, Four from Divergent , Percy Jackson from The Lightning Thiefand Quentin from Paper Towns.\n\nENVY\n\nWhat book or books would you most want to receive as a gift?\n\nThis is hard, because even though I do have a long Amazon wishlist, if there’s a book I really and truly want, I’ll buy it without hesitation. So I think I’d have to say the new collection of Harry Potter books would be the ones I want to receive most! I already have a set of the books and an extra copy of The Deathly Hallows, but the new editions are so cool and I love the feel of the pages. At the moment, though, I’m not planning on buying them for myself because they’re so expensive and I already own copies of the novels, anyway. But I would love, love, love to get them as a gift!\n\nAnd those are my seven deadly book sins! Comment below or try the tag yourself–I’d love to see what your answers would be. Happy reading!\n\nI saw this tag done by Lipsyy Lost and Found and, because I’ve actually kept a list of adult novels perfect for YA readers on my phone for awhile now, knew I had to do it, too! So here is my “Top Ten Tuesday” post: Top 10 Adult Books for YA Readers. I think this is a great post because even though I love YA, I do think it’s good for readers to have a diverse palate of genres. There are some really great adult books out there that I think can get passed up sometimes just because they aren’t a YA reader’s typical genre, and that’s a shame! So here are some books that are perfect for YA readers wanting to dip their toe into the waters of adult fiction (and other genres).\n\nSince it’s hard for me to gauge which books would be better suited for YA readers than others (everyone has their own opinion on what book is the best, as we all know), I’ll just rank these in accordance with my own personal preference. I have a hard time choosing favorites, but I’ll try my best to make a definitive list! I’ll also try to match each adult book with a YA book similar to it so that you’ll know what you’re getting yourself into. And if you’re interested in more YA-to-adult book comparisons, I did a post sort of like this awhile back called What to Read After Your Favorite YA, so you can check that out!\n\nAnd now, without further ado, here is my list for YA readers wanting to ease into adult books:\n\n10. My Name is Memory by Ann Brashares\n\nThis book is, essentially, a hybrid of Twilight by Stephanie Meyer and The Time Traveller’s Wife by Audrey Niffeneger\n\nI said the magic word, didn’t I? I’ll say it again: Twilight! Yes, My Name is Memory contains all the romance of Edward and Bella with a time travel-ish twist, sure to enthrall all you Twi-hards out there. The story is about a young man with the gift of remembrance; he can actually retain all his memories from past lives and apply them in his current life. But his gift is also a curse, for he cannot forget his true love, Sophia, with whom he is reunited in every life then tragically torn away forever. Now, in present day, the boy finds Sophia again…but can he find a way to keep their love together?\n\nWhile this book wasn’t my favorite, I did think it was cute and creative, and it really is the perfect segue into adult fiction for any YA reader. That probably stems from the fact that Ann Brashares is originally a YA writer (Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants, anyone?), so her style is easily adaptable to either genre. Don’t expect to be blown away by the plot, necessarily, but do try this book if you’re a Twi-hard who wants to branch out. This book will give you all the cutesy romance you need and more!\n\n9. Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn\n\nMysterious, eerie and haunting: a perfect match for any fan of E. Lockhart’s We Were Liars!\n\nEven if you aren’t an adult fiction reader, I’m sure you’ve at least heard of Gone Girl. Dominating the New York Times best-sellers list for months, this novel is a full-on thriller packed with mysteriousness and chilling writing, perfect for any fan of We Were Liars. Just like with We Were Liars, I’ll give you only a brief plot summary of Gone Girl and tell you not to learn anything else about it before reading: A few days after his wedding anniversary, Nick’s wife goes missing, leaving him the prime suspect in her murder. As the days drag on and the plot gets muddled, we see the dark and twisted roots of Nick’s marriage’s past, and we begin to question what really happened to his wife.\n\nI truly enjoyed Gone Girl, even though it is a dark and complex read, and think that its innate intrigue and the unreliability of the narration makes it a perfect compliment to We Were Liars. Flynn is a wonderfully unique and somewhat grotesque writer, and like We Were Liars, her novel is not a light read and requires full attention. But I do think it’s worth reading, and a great stepping stone for YA readers heading into adult fiction!\n\n8. The Promise of Stardust by Priscille Sibley\n\nThis story could probably be the brainchild of Nicholas Sparks and Jodi Picoult, both of whom I believe can cross into YA fiction at times: Sparks for The Last Song and Picoult for My Sister’s Keeper. You can see my YA-to-adult comparisons of both of those novels here, which is why I decided not to put either of them on this list. But this novel, because it combines them both, is a perfect YA match\n\nI absolutely loved this book! And I think the simplicity of the writing paired with the tragic complexity of the plot makes it a perfect book for those wanting to cross into adult fiction after YA. As I said before, I think that Nicholas Sparks and Jodi Picoult are two authors who would also be perfect for crossing into the adult genre, as I sometimes feel that their books could be YA, but since I did already blog about them, I don’t want to do it again. But this novel is basically the two of them combined, so it works out perfectly!\n\nThe story is about a man, Matt, whose wife, Elle, has always dreamed of having a baby but has suffered from various infertility issues. One day, Elle falls and hits her head, leaving her in a vegetative coma from which she may never awaken. Matt knows that Elle would want him to pull the plug, so he prepares to say goodbye…but then the doctor informs him that Elle is pregnant. Faced with the difficulty of deciding between Elle’s two greatest desires, Matt is thrown into a lawsuit that will change his world–and Elle’s–forever. The story flashes back between the present and through Matt and Elle’s love story, making it both a serious and adorable read. The love story aspect will definitely appeal to YA readers, as it has pieces of YA contemporaries in it, and the struggle with the lawsuit will be the perfect stepping stone into adult fiction. Either way, it’s a beautiful story that is so worth reading!\n\n7. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer\n\nI couldn’t think of a YA novel to which I could compare this story because I honestly feel that despite its categorization as adult fiction, this book could really stand on its own as YA\n\nIf you’re looking for a unique, quirky, YA-style adult book, look no further than Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. This is such an amazing story about a boy who is chasing after clues left behind by his father, who was killed in the 9/11. As the boy struggles to deal with the death of his father, his quest to hunt down the clues allows him to make peace with what happened during the attack on the Twin Towers.\n\nI highly recommend this book if you’re a fervent YA reader looking for an “in-between” book. This story is incredibly written and though it will take you on an emotional roller coaster, it’s such an impeccable read. And it has the rare ability to appeal to readers of almost any age, which I think is a very special quality.\n\n6. Wicked by Gregory Maguire\n\nFans of Danielle Paige’s YA novel Dorothy Must Die will love this book\n\nThough it is slightly darker and more serious than the hit Broadway musical, Wicked is an amazing and gorgeously written twist on Frank Baum’s original Wizard of Oz. I paralleled Wicked and Dorothy Must Die for obvious reasons: each take characters from Baum’s story and cast them in a new or different light. Though Wicked is much more adult-like than the somewhat playful and fantastical Dorothy Must Die, I think that if you appreciated the cleverness of Paige’s plot development, you would definitely enjoy Maguire’s rendition.\n\nWicked, in case you didn’t know, is a sort of unofficial prequel to The Wizard of Oz, in which we learn about the Wicked Witch of the West’s past and how she came to be who she is. And though the writing is definitely geared toward adult readers, I think YA fans would absolutely be able to appreciate Maguire’s weaving of the stories in a fantasy setting. It reminds me, in some ways, of Cinder by Marissa Meyer, mostly because I think both Maguire and Meyer are so clever in taking tiny pieces of the original tale and shaping them into bigger plot movements. I have to digress for a second because I totally have been wanting to point this out to someone–did anyone else notice how in Cress, when Thorne lost his vision, it was a total reference to the original “Rapunzel” story? I was so nerdily excited when I realized this…in the actual story by the Grimm Brothers (which is super dark and creepy, not at all how they tell the story in Tangled) the prince is blinded by the witch and Rapunzel has to guide him and keep him safe…just like Cress and Thorne! Ah, sorry, just had to bring it up because I don’t think it’s something most people would notice, but since I did a whole study on fairy tales last semester, I caught it and was really excited about it. Anyway, Wicked is another novel that I wouldn’t necessarily call adult fiction, but also wouldn’t label as YA, either, so I think it could appeal to both genres (though you should be prepared for some mature content and language if you’re coming from the YA spectrum).\n\n5. Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell\n\nFans of The Luxe by Anna Godbersen or A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray will especially love this classic\n\nOkay, I know what you’re thinking…but please, hear me out on this! Yes, I know Gone With the Wind is a tome in and of itself, but seriously, guys, it’s so amazingly good. I read it when I was 12 years old and devoured it in three days, and even now it remains one of my all-time favorite books. I went through a huge classics phase in middle school, so naturally, I picked up Gone With the Wind. I was so shocked when not only was it incredibly easy to read, but more than that, it was so enjoyable! I remember risking my computer privileges staying up past my bedtime reading under the covers with a flashlight because I just could not put it down. I absolutely fell in love with it, and even today, when I can barely remember what I ate for lunch yesterday, I can vividly recall the story of Scarlett O’Hara and Rhett Butler and all the other unforgettable characters.\n\nSo yes, I know it’s a massive book and you’ll be thinking that you don’t want to spend too long on just one book. But I actually read this book faster than some 300-page novels, mostly because it’s so good and you won’t want to put it down. If you’re really trying to branch out from YA and want to try a classic, I promise you will love Gone With the Wind. It’s the kind of classic you can truly enjoy; you won’t suffer through it like some classics (those are the ones I call wine-and-cheese classics, because you only ever force yourself through them so that you can tell your classy and intellectual friends that you read it). In a lot of ways, I think Gone With the Wind is a longer but better version of The Luxe series, so I know that if you like those or even A Great and Terrible Beauty, you will love it! Please check it out. Really, please do!\n\n4. The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman\n\nFor all you fans of Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan\n\nThis might be a bit of a stretch comparison, but I honestly think that any YA fan at all would love Neil Gaiman’s The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It’s a sort of dark fairy tale set in modern day, and I personally got a strong Lightning Thief vibe from it. The protagonist is a young boy who learns that his world contains much more magic than he ever could have imagined, and he seeks counsel with his mysterious next door neighbor/sort-of-girlfriend in order to defeat the wickedness inside his home. That summary probably didn’t do the story much justice, but it’s a short novel that will draw you in immediately and won’t let you go until you’ve finished every word. Neil Gaiman is an incredible fantasy author, and though this is an adult book, I absolutely believe that it could be YA depending on your viewpoint.\n\nIt’s also so beautifully written, and though it lacks the easy-going tone of the Percy Jackson books, there are so many similarities between the two books. The Ocean at the End of the Lane would be another perfect segue into adult fiction for any YA reader!\n\n3. Where’d You Go, Bernadette? by Maria Semple\n\nAll fans of John Green’s Paper Towns must check this book out\n\n,\n\nWhere’d You Go, Bernadette is definitely an adult novel, but it’s so eccentric and quirky and great. I saw this book on the New York Times best-sellers list a long time ago and thought the description sounded interesting, so on a whim, I ordered it. When I picked it up, I had no idea how completely enamored I would be with the story! It’s about a girl named Bea with an astoundingly high IQ in junior high whose crazy but lovable mother, a world-renowned architect turned agoraphobic, disappears after Bea suggests that they take a family cruise to Antarctica. Bea doesn’t understand why her mother would just leave, or where she would go, so she taps into her emails and phone calls, tracing back all the clues to find out just where Bernadette has gone.\n\nThis book is basically the adult version of Paper Towns, in my opinion. I absolutely loved both books, and even though Where’d You Go, Bernadette is a little quirkier and more adult-like, I think any YA reader would love it, too. It also reminds me a little of Wherever Nina Lies by Lynn Wiengarten, but that’s a more obscure book, which is why I didn’t mention it in the header. Plus, it was kind of weird, and not nearly as good as Paper Towns!\n\nMaybe I adored Bernadette so much because I wasn’t expecting to fall in love with it–I don’t know. But whatever the reason, I gave this book a full 5/5 stars (which I rarely do) and I hope you’ll try it and love it, as well!\n\n2. The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion\n\nIf you’re a fan of the YA classic (I always thought this was a YA classic, but maybe I’m wrong? I don’t know) Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, this book is for you! Or if you’re a fan of The Big Bang Theory television show, I think you’d really enjoy this book\n\nOkay, this book is just so cute and great and a perfect light read if you’re at the beach or in a book slump or just want a book that you won’t be able to put down (was that enough of a run-on sentence?). I just loved it! The Rosie Project is about a man named Don with Asperger’s (who doesn’t realize that he has Asperger’s, even as he lectures about them in his classes as a professor) on the hunt for the perfect woman. Don, basically Sheldon Cooper in literary narrative form, has created a questionairre that he believes will formulate his perfect match…but all his findings are shaken when he meets Rosie, a woman who seems to be different from Don in all the critical ways. He and Rosie become friends after he learns of her desire to find her father, and together they initiate a project that will bring them together in ways they never expected.\n\nThe way this story is written reminds me so much of Flowers for Algernon, or even The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, if you’re familiar with that novel by Mark Haddon. It’s just a cute, feel-good novel that I think is perfect for any YA reader trying to branch out into adult fiction. Really, I think anyone would like it!\n\n1. The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\n\nI know there’s some YA book to which I could probably compare this novel, but I’m blanking on it right now…and anyway, this book is so extraordinary that you shouldn’t need to be motivated to read it just because it’s like some YA novel!\n\nLast, but certainly not least, is an incredible novel that is so magical and beautiful, and I really do think it could be classified as YA as well as adult fiction. The appeal is so great for any reader, and I firmly believe that this novel can bridge the chasm between YA and adult literature. I can’t think of any other way to gush about it more, but please read this enchanting book–you won’t regret it!\n\nAnd that’s my top 10 list! Let me know what you think in the comments section below–I’d love to hear your thoughts about any of these books if you have or want to read them!"
