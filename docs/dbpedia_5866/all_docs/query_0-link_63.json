        "text": "12 Angry Men (1957) remains one of the greatest courtroom dramas  actually, a jury-room drama, because only the first few minutes are in court. Nearly the entire running time is confined to the jury deliberations, and the sense of confinement is deliberate. Adapted from a 1954 TV drama about a murder trial, this tight film casts 12 skilled actors as the jurors who debate a young man's fate. The biggest star is Henry Fonda, who calmly plays the lone holdout against the other 11. Additional notables are Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, and Ed Begley, but even the lesser-known actors pull their weight in this masterpiece. Director Sidney Lumet's camera angles, close-ups, and quick cuts heighten the tension as the arguments verge on violence. Although some critics dismiss it as a \"message movie,\" and some scenes show behavior that should trigger a mistrial, its power is undeniable, and it earns classic status.\n\n12 O'Clock High (1949): see Twelve O'Clock High.\n\n12 Years a Slave fully deserves its Academy Awards for Best Picture and Adapted Screenplay of 2013. It's based on the 1853 memoir by Solomon Northup, a free black Northerner who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Northup, and Kenyan-Mexican actress Lupita Nyong'o won an Oscar for her supporting role as a young slave frequently used and abused by her master. British director Steve McQueen and writer John Ridley pull no punches in bringing this harrowing drama to the screen. When its authenticity is hard to watch, the camera does not waver, giving these skilled actors time to wear their roles like skin. Northup's ordeal is a rare first-person account of slavery authored by an educated black man who was born a free American before falling into America's holocaust.\n\n13 (2003): see Thirteen.\n\n13 Ghosts (1960) is a gimmicky thriller about a haunted house whose malicious ghosts are visible to the inhabitants only through special goggles. The gimmick is that theater goers received actual cardboard viewers with red and blue filters and were instructed to use them when the black-and-white scenes were tinted blue. Depending on which filter the watcher employed to view the screen, the red-tinted ghosts either appeared or disappeared. It's selective vision, not 3-D. Seen today without filters, the ghosts are visible as red apparitions on a blue background. The gimmick was necessary because the movie itself is campy and hardly worth watching.\n\n1917 (2019) earns a place of honor alongside Wings (1927), All Quiet On the Western Front (1930), Paths of Glory (1957), and Gallipoli (1981) as the best World War I movies ever made. Two British soldiers are sent on a nearly suicidal mission to stop two front-line battalions from charging into a trap. To avert the massacre, the soldiers must cross no man's land and sneak through enemy territory. Co-writer and director Sam Mendes filmed the screenplay to simulate one continuous shot, although it does have a few disguised cuts. The carefully choreographed action is realistic, and the acting is superb. The set design is over the top, including almost a mile of historically correct trenches. Though fictional, this movie bookends They Shall Not Grow Old (2018), a masterfully restored documentary of the same period.\n\n1984 (1984) brilliantly adapts George Orwell's classic dystopian novel about a cruel authoritarian state. Few adaptations are as faithful to the original story and spirit as this one. Surveillance in this one-party state is ubiquitous, with two-way telescreens in every home and workplace. Crimes discovered by the Thought Police risk arrest, torture, forced confessions, and execution. An autocratic leader nicknamed Big Brother rules the nation (\"Oceania\"), which is constantly at war with other countries and with a mysterious resistance movement led by a hated traitor (\"Goldstein\"). John Hurt is exceptional as Winston Smith, a low-level government worker who revises historical archives to erase people who have fallen into disfavor and to make the records conform to current events. (When the chocolate ration is lowered, he alters the archived newspapers to make it seem larger.) Against the Party's rules, Smith begins an affair with a younger woman (Suzanna Hamilton, also good). In his last performance before his death, Richard Burton convincingly plays a higher-level official. Although no 110-minute movie can fully capture a novel as rich as 1984, this one is a valiant effort. Filmed in ruined sections of London during 1984 when the book's events actually take place, it vividly creates the fearful, decrepit atmosphere of a brutalist society. Warning: the torture scenes are equally true to Orwell's dark vision.\n\n20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932) features two young stars soon destined for greater fame: Spencer Tracy and Bette Davis. Tracy plays a flashy, arrogant gangster sentenced to the infamous New York state prison. Davis plays his loyal girlfriend but is difficult to recognize at first because of her bleach-blonde hair and the absence of her later mannerisms. Tracy's character learns that in prison he's just another serial number, not a big shot. His girl pays regular visits and does more later. Although this drama has a prison-reformist slant, it avoids the cliché of portraying the inmates as the good guys and the warden as the bad guy. And because it was made two years before the Hays Code enforced strict censorship on Hollywood, the ending can be unexpected.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a must-see classic, even for those who dislike science fiction. It's a masterpiece by director Stanley Kubrick that added some memorable visuals and phrases to popular culture. (Examples: mysterious black monoliths imitated by modern-day pranksters, and the line \"Open the pod-bay door, Hal\" when an astronaut begs a rebellious computer to let him back into the spaceship.) The story hints that space aliens accelerated the evolution of human intelligence and are inviting us to take the next big leap. When excavations on the Moon uncover one of those strange monoliths, the discovery spurs Earth to explore Jupiter. But the mission goes haywire  or does it? The last act features stunning special effects for its time and a bizarre climax that stirred much debate. Critics slam the slow pacing of this film and dismiss the classical-music soundtrack as pretentious, but it's irrefutable that 2001 launched sci-fi movies into a new realm.\n\n2012 (2009) is another apocalypse fantasy from Roland Emmerich, who produced and directed The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and Independence Day (1996). This time, life as we know it is threatened by solar flares that overheat the Earth's core and destabilize the crust. The title refers to the Mayan calendar, which supposedly stops at the year 2012 because that's when the world ends. But don't expect any scholarly lessons in history or science from this movie. It's pure special-effects fireworks as things fall apart and entire continents meet their doom. Of course, someone has a plan to save mankind. The only actor who brings an appropriate level of farce to this picture is Woody Harrelson, who plays a wacky radio talk-show host. Everyone else tries very hard to keep a straight face.\n\n21 Grams (2003) would be an even better drama without the jigsaw-puzzle editing, which disrupts the continuity of fine performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro. This is the second time Penn has been flayed by a heavy-handed director who thinks that abrupt jump cuts within scenes are avant-garde filmmaking. (The first time was in I Am Sam, 2001.) Despite the distraction of randomly rearranged scenes, 21 Grams is a compelling drama about three star-crossed people: Penn's character, a math teacher who discovers that a heart transplant doesn't give him a new life; Watts' character, a mother who is nearly destroyed by personal tragedy; and Del Toro's character, an ex-con who struggles against personal demons to go straight. Moral: life goes on.\n\n23 Paces to Baker Street (1956) alludes to Sherlock Holmes (the fictional detective who lived at 221B Baker Street) and echoes Alfred Hitchcock (who directed similar thrillers in the 1950s), but it fails to match either of them. Van Johnson plays a blind American playwright who overhears two strangers plotting a crime in a London pub. Or at least, he thinks it's a crime. Vera Miles plays his pretty admirer. This movie eerily resembles Hitchcock's Rear Window. In both, the main character is a disabled man who suspects a crime is in progress. In both, skimpy clues leave the police skeptical. In both, a pretty woman pines for the man and indulges him just to stay close. In both, cameras help gather clues. In both, the climax is a fight in the man's dark apartment. And in both, the fight ends with a fall. Rear Window was already in production when 23 Paces premiered, so it's not a copy, but the coincidences are odd. Hitchcock's thriller is far superior.\n\n25th Hour (2002) is Spike Lee and David Benioff's tale of a New York City drug dealer (expertly played by Edward Norton) who has one last day of freedom before starting a seven-year prison sentence. He struggles to tie up loose ends and endure the dread of his suddenly bleak future. He's not a sympathetic figure, because the only thing he truly regrets is getting caught. Just when the story appears to be reaching an explosive climax, there's a stupid fight scene, followed by an ambiguous did-he-or-didn't-he ending. Through it all, the post-9/11 references make you wonder if the film is a parable of impending doom. Overall, it's a good effort that never quite resolves itself.\n\n28 Days Later (2003) is a cross between Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Day of the Triffids (1962). Like Living Dead, it's wantonly gross and violent, and it flaunts its low-budget production. (It was shot on grainy digital video.) The parallels with Triffids are even more blatant. In both films, the main character wakes up in a London hospital bed, discovers that an apocalyptic event has transpired while he was unconscious, becomes the surrogate parent of a teenage girl, does battle with strange creatures, watches helplessly as a major English city burns, flees on a desperate road trip, and seeks refuge at a military base. The main difference is the source of the trouble: in Triffids it was weeds from outer space, and this time it's a voracious disease. Like most modern horror flicks, the scariest thing about 28 Days Later is the anticipation of another gross-out scene.\n\n3:10 to Yuma (2007) is a modernist remake of a classic 1957 Western. Russell Crowe plays outlaw Ben Wade (portrayed by Glenn Ford in the original), oddly mixing humor with sociopathy. Crowe veers from amusement to manipulation to violence, often in the same scene. Some lines hint of modern psychobabble and verge on breaking character. Christian Bale, the surprising star of Rescue Dawn (2007), delivers another startling performance in this drama. He plays Dan Evans (portrayed by Dan Heflin in the original), a good-guy rancher who agrees to help escort the outlaw prisoner to a train bound for Yuma, Arizona. Ben Foster plays a chilling Charlie Prince  a sadistic gunslinger who tries to free Ben Wade. At times, the dialogue is a little too breezy, and I found the conclusion unrealistic. But overall, this picture is a thrill.\n\nThe 39 Steps (1935) marks Alfred Hitchcock's ascent as a major filmmaker and contains elements that reappeared in his thrillers for decades to come. A common theme is an innocent man suddenly in dangerous trouble. In this case, Robert Donat plays a Canadian in London who unwittingly befriends a secret agent, is wrongly accused of murder, and tries to clear his name by foiling an espionage plot. Along the way he meets an icy blonde (Madeleine Carroll), another common element. Additional Hitchcockian features are light humor, wry dialogue, surprise twists, and clever film editing. (For the latter, watch when Donat is shot, and again when he and Carroll are backseat auto passengers.) One highlight is a foot chase on a train; another is an impromptu political speech. Rightly hailed as a classic, this fast-paced picture brought Hitchcock international attention and paved the way for his 1940 migration to Hollywood.\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) is a passable comedy if you can tolerate raunchy humor and an utterly predictable plot. Steve Carell plays an electronics-store employee who is unsuccessful with women. He's handsome, intelligent, and well built, so the movie explains his dilemma by portraying him as a unstylish super-nerd whose apartment is filled with collectable action figures, toys, and posters. Even more absurdly, he can't drive a car, even though he lives in L.A., so his primary transportation is a bicycle. It's obvious that the film is stacking the deck, and it doesn't stop there. When his buddies discover his sexual status, they try to get him laid, with occasionally humorous but always expected results. Before long he meets two attractive women who are hot for his bod, and the movie ends with a bizarre scene reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite (2004). If your expectations are low, you'll like it better.\n\nThe 400 Blows (French: Les Quatre Cents Coups, 1959) was the first major film directed by François Truffaut, who reaped an Academy Award nomination for co-writing the original screenplay. It's the semi-autobiographical story of a French boy who's a mischievous juvenile delinquent. He finds trouble in school, at home, while playing hooky from school, while running away from home, and while engaging in petty theft. But he's not violent, and he's enthralled by cinema and eager to start some kind of independent career. Although everyone has a montage of formative childhood memories, Truffaut and child actor Jean-Pierre Léaud effectively bring them to life on screen, immersing us in the unglamorous drudgery of working-class Paris during the austere postwar years. Wistful, gritty, and amusing, this artful film documents a restless youth.\n\n42 (2013) tells the story of baseball legend Jackie Robinson (whose uniform number was 42) breaking the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Recruited by Dodgers owner Branch Rickey from the Negro Leagues, Robinson played a year with a minor-league team in Montreal before moving up to Brooklyn. It was not a smooth path. Robinson faced racism from every direction  fans, team owners, managers, opposing players, and even his own teammates. Chadwick Boseman makes his big-screen debut with an exceptional performance as Robinson, and Harrison Ford is wonderfully gruff as Rickey. This film pulls no punches and portrays a transition that was pivotal not just in baseball history, but also in American history. Like many sports movies, however, it can't resist ending with the cliché of rising music and slow-mo action.\n\n5 Against the House (1955) is a disappointing caper flick, despite featuring Brian Keith as a mentally damaged war veteran, sex-siren Kim Novak in an early role, and a screenplay co-written by Stirling Silliphant. Four college students plan to rob a Reno casino as a daring stunt, just to prove it can be done. Of course, their plan goes awry, but that's not the problem with this movie. Unnecessary scenes and unfunny banter waste half the running time, and the \"foolproof\" plan turns out to be stupid and irrelevant. Critics say that all four actors playing students are too old for their roles, but they aren't completely out of place  two characters are law students, and many vets attended college on the G.I. Bill in this era. Thankfully, the last act avoids a cliché climax.\n\n7 Chances (1925): see Seven Chances.\n\n8-1/2 a/k/a 8½ (Italian: Otto e Mezzo, 1963) is a landmark film by Italian director Federico Fellini and a cinema classic. It was meta before meta was cool. Essentially autobiographical, it stars Marcello Mastroianni as a filmmaker confused about his life and his next project. He's unsure what his film should mean  if anything  and whether it should be elusively allegorical or accessibly literal. His producers, actors, and crew tug him in different directions. His personal life is equally chaotic as he swings between an eccentric lover and a hostile wife. Fellini portrays this confusion by weaving together scenes of his character's personal life with imaginary scenes of his film project and with flashbacks to his childhood. The seamless continuity is hard to follow, especially on first viewing, and the climax is mysterious. This picture is definitely for film fans who enjoy arty cinema. It won Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film (Italian) and Costume Design but should have also won for Cinematography  it's one of most beautifully composed films ever made.\n\n9 Songs (2004) stirred controversy for explicit sex scenes in a movie that's supposedly mainstream, not a XXX porn film. The debate distracted from the movie's real problem, which is that it's a terrible movie. It intercuts nine live-concert hard-rock videos with graphic sex scenes between a British climatologist and an American college student in London. The concert videos are amateurish and are irrelevant to the story, except the Brit says he first met the Yank at one of the concerts. The sex is nothing special by porn standards, and the movie has virtually no plot. It fails at both mainstream filmmaking and pure porn, so the controversy was much ado about nothing.\n\n99 Homes (2015) is an outstanding drama of the housing-bubble collapse that triggered our recent Great Recession. Although it can be criticized for barely mentioning the high-finance schemes hatched by big banks and derivatives traders, the intricate details of collateralized debt obligations and credit-default swaps would only confuse most viewers. Instead, writer/director Ramin Bahrani focuses on the personal story of an evicted homeowner and a predatory real-estate agent who flips foreclosed houses in Florida. It would be easy to cast these characters as good guys and bad guys, but 99 Homes depicts a more complex morality. The victim becomes a predator, and the predatory agent has his reasons. Andrew Garfield as the former homeowner and Michael Shannon as the real-estate agent have their starring roles down cold in this skillfully made film.\n\n********** A **********\n\nA Fool There Was (1915) launched Theda Bara to stardom, and her role as a predatory female shocked audiences. Only four of Bara's feature-length films survive, so it's a pity this one isn't a better showcase. It's an early silent film with no close-ups, few dialogue cards, crude editing, and poor preservation. But it's an unusually frank melodrama that doesn't insist on redemption.\n\nA Man and a Woman (1966): see Un Homme et une Femme.\n\nABBA: Super Troupe (2019) documents the history of the hugely popular Swedish pop-music band. It's interesting and informative, especially for people unfamiliar with the background. Two tidbits: at its peak, ABBA was Sweden's second-richest enterprise, but the Mamma Mia! stage musical featuring the band's songs reaped even more money. Unfortunately, this one-hour documentary suffers from poor-quality audio that makes some interviews almost unintelligible.\n\nAbbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) sounds schlocky, and it is. But it's funny and was the most popular Universal Pictures horror flick since the original Frankenstein (1931). In addition to the Bud Abbott & Lou Costello comedy duo, it stars Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolfman, Glenn Strange (not Boris Karloff) as the Frankenstein monster, and Vincent Price as the voice of the Invisible Man. (The Mummy was dropped.) Expect lots of madcap comedy. My favorite line: \"She has so much bridgework that when I kiss her, I have to pay a toll.\"\n\nThe Abominable Snowman a/k/a The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas (1957) leans more philosophical than most creature features of the 1950s. Under the Cold War threat of nuclear annihilation, it was unclear whether the human race would survive. Could it be replaced by another race of primates hiding in the world's most remote mountains? This interesting thriller, adapted from a British TV show, ponders that question and others when a small expedition searches for the fabled Yeti. Forrest Tucker stars as the leader who has personal motives. Peter Cushing plays a scientist answering a higher calling. Their clashes provide most of the drama, because the big reveal comes late. The moral: Sometimes the mysterious should remain a mystery.\n\nAbout a Boy (2002) is really about a man who's like a boy. He's a man (stiffly played by Hugh Grant) who doesn't have to work because of an inherited income stream. But liberation from the daily grind has turned him into a directionless, moribund consumer. Then a young boy and a single mother come into his life and turn everything upside down. It sounds formulaic, and the last reel is a bit too sugar-coated, but the snappy dialogue and a few plot twists create a story that is frequently funny and warm.\n\nAbout Schmidt (2002) is a devastating evaluation of middle-class American life. Jack Nicholson, with surprising subtlety, plays a newly retired insurance man. After some unexpected tragedy, he begins to doubt his life has accomplished anything of lasting value. The verdict comes slowly because he's not accustomed to self-examination. By swinging deftly between drama and comedy, this film explores the meaning of the American dream far better than American Beauty. And it isn't simply a Hollywood smirk at bourgeois America, as claimed by some critics, who have also overblown the nude scene with Kathy Bates. It's a story that will haunt you for a long time.\n\nThe Abyss (1989) is the best underwater thriller ever made and an excellent sci-fi adventure to boot. Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star as a bickering couple on an experimental deep-sea oil rig. When a nuclear submarine sinks nearby, they're drafted into a desperate rescue mission alongside a U.S. Navy SEAL team. That's already enough drama for most movies, but director James Cameron (The Terminator, Titanic) adds an extraterrestrial angle. The special effects won an Academy Award and still impress today. Many scenes weren't faked, however  to the detriment of the hard-driven cast and crew, some of whom narrowly escaped death while filming in a huge water tank. A longer version released later on DVD has a different ending than the versions released in theaters and now streaming on Amazon. But even the original cut is great.\n\nThe Accidental Tourist (1988) questions isolationism as a personal lifestyle. William Hurt skillfully plays a reluctant business traveler who writes travel books for other business travelers who dislike travel. His advice is to minimize hassles, avoid new experiences, and return home unchanged. His siblings are even more cocooned. Then a family tragedy disrupts the status quo and threatens his marriage. Smoky-voiced Kathleen Turner is perfection as his chilly wife. Geena Davis won an Oscar as a dog trainer who further upsets his stability. Nominated for Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, and Original Score, this deftly crafted movie surpasses most romantic dramas by challenging emotional neutrality as a life strategy.\n\nAcross the Universe (2007) is a lively rock musical featuring new arrangements of classic Beatles songs. It tells the story of a young Liverpool man who travels to America and falls in love. But the backdrop is more sinister: the 1960s turmoil of the Vietnam War, violent protests, civil rights, assassinations, and alienation. Some scenes are day-glo psychedelic, a homage to the Beatles own films  Magical Mystery Tour (1967) and Yellow Submarine (1968). Others contain subtle references to real historical figures and events. Although the updated music is generally quite good, the storyline tends to be jumpy and overpopulated with characters and subplots.\n\nAct of Violence (1948) stars Robert Ryan, Van Heflin, Janet Leigh, and Mary Astor in an excellent film-noir thriller that weighs revenge against morality. Ryan is wonderfully menacing as a crippled World War II veteran pursuing the former officer (Heflin) whom he blames for his misfortune. Heflin's thriving postwar character seems innocent but has secrets. Is his comrade's thirst for revenge justified? Although Leigh gets some screen time as his frightened wife, her role is minimal. Astor plays a more interesting character  a lowlife floozy who picks up the pursued man like a stray dog. The climax echoes a Wild West duel and ends with a surprise.\n\nAdaptation (2002) must be the ultimate self-referential film script. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich) teams again with director Spike Jonze (ditto) to make a film about his struggle to write a film adaptation of Susan Orlean's book The Orchid Thief, which itself was adapted from an article in the New Yorker. Nicolas Cage excels in a double starring role as Kaufman and his twin brother, Donald. Outstanding supporting actors are Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep. The story has more inner twists than a mobius strip and drags a little near the end, but viewers who like unusual movies will enjoy the ride.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau (2011) is a philosophical thriller that pits free will against predestination. Matt Damon stars as a politician who falls in love with a modern dancer (a luminescent Emily Blunt) after a chance meeting. A second unexpected meeting seems to confirm their mutual attraction. But were their meetings really chance? And would a relationship thwart their life goals and disrupt the march of history? Some mysterious strangers who claim to secretly control the world think so. Like another recent movie starring Damon (Hereafter), this film explores an ancient philosophical debate while studiously avoiding theology. Although it offers no new insight, it's a passable thriller  except that religious concepts stripped of their religious trappings often look like naked fantasy.\n\nThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000) tries hard and has some funny moments, but it can't match the charm of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, another movie that mixes live action with cartoon animation.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939) is the second of 14 pictures starring Basil Rathbone as English private detective Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as his sidekick, Doctor Watson. This installment was also the last in the series to take place in Victorian Age London, consistent with the original stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. Later films moved to the then-current 1940s and often featured a wartime theme. This one ranks among the best and erects some deliberately distracting subplots. The supporting cast is particularly good, with thriller-stalwart George Zucco playing Holmes' archenemy Professor Moriarty and the talented Ida Lupino in a surprising role as a young socialite fearing for her life. Holmes and Watson exchange lively banter, and this time Watson gets the triumphant last word.\n\nAelita a/k/a Aelita, the Queen of Mars (1924) was the Soviet Union's first science-fiction film, which qualifies it as a milestone in cinema. This genre wasn't as popular in the silent era, and government censorship kept most early Soviet films down to earth. The screenplay was penned by Aleksei Tolstoy (18831945), not to be confused with the great Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (18281910). It's placed mainly in Moscow in 1921. Unfortunately, the earthbound scenes are a disjointed mess of irrelevant characters and half-baked subplots. More interesting are the scenes on Mars, where a pampered queen is subject to a dictator who rules hordes of subterranean slaves. The Martian sets, props, and costumes are wonderfully exotic. Despite its Bolshevik heritage, the story isn't too propagandistic until the end. Today this picture is a curiosity, not a standout example of its type.\n\nAn Affair to Remember (1957) pairs heartthrob Cary Grant with lovely Deborah Kerr in a classic romance drama that feels dated. Grant plays a playboy who meets Kerr's demure character on an ocean liner. Both are engaged to other people who are absent. At first she deflects his brash overtures, but an interlude ashore to visit his grandmother alters their courses. Unsure whether to break their engagements, they agree to meet six months later atop the Empire State Building if they're still in love. When this movie was made, Grant was 17 years older than Kerr, and the difference looks even greater. Contemporary audiences were so enthralled with him as a leading man that they didn't question the mutual attraction. Today, it's harder to see, and their formal banter sounds chilly. This classic hasn't aged well.\n\nAffair in Trinidad (1952) reunites Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford in a film noir that tries to repeat the success of Gilda (1946). Although it reaped more box-office revenue, contemporary critics disliked the story and particularly Hayworth's performance. Viewed today, it's an average murder mystery that unusually features a woman as the main character, and Hayworth isn't so bad. She flashes her stuff in two song-and-dance numbers. Ford's character is mostly angry and jealous, and he looks even worse when he rudely slaps a woman. The final scene makes me question her judgment.\n\nAfter the Thin Man (1936) followed The Thin Man (1934) as the first sequel in what would become a six-picture series. It's nearly as good. The suave William Powell returns as retired detective Nick Charles, along with the beautiful Myrna Loy as Nora, his wealthy wife, and Asta, their ornery dog. It recaptures the spirit of the first movie by offering a similar plot: a mysterious murder lures Nick and Nora into intrigue and danger. But this time it's a family affair. As before, snappy dialogue, heavy drinking, and a cast of colorful characters keep the action lively. The climax is similar, too: Nick solves the crime at a rowdy gathering of the suspects. Watch for a young James Stewart in a supporting role before he became a star.\n\nAgainst All Odds (1984) remakes the film-noir classic Out of the Past (1947). It lacks the same atmosphere and gravitas but is equally representative of its era. Jeff Bridges substitutes for Robert Mitchum, James Woods for Kirk Douglas, and Rachel Ward for Jane Greer  who reappears as the mother of Ward's character. Despite changing many details, the plot is basically the same: a gangster (Woods) wounded by his runaway girlfriend (Ward) hires an acquaintance (Bridges) to find her in Mexico and recover the money she allegedly stole. The mission goes awry when the acquaintance and girlfriend fall in lust. Richard Widmark and Alex Karras excel in supporting roles. Not only because it's filmed in color, the remake doesn't match the original's noirish feel, and the climax is different. But it's a good movie in its own right that evokes the 1980s.\n\nThe Age of Gold (1930): see L'Age d'Or.\n\nThe Agony and the Ecstasy (1965) dramatizes Michelangelo's painting of the Sistine Chapel ceiling in 15081512. Charlton Heston, the go-to actor for epics of this sort in the 1950s and 1960s, stars as the great Renaissance artist. His gritty performance is less stilted than his turn as Moses in The Ten Commandments (1956). Rex Harrison is equally good as Pope Julius II, the \"warrior pope\" who commissioned the famous fresco while fighting wars to regain control over the Papal States. Although battle scenes provide some historical context, they lengthen the movie and distract viewers unfamiliar with contemporary politics. Diane Cilento adds a feminine touch as a Medici contessina whose love for Michelangelo is unrewarded. As usual, Hollywood can't resist a few embellishments, such as implying that anthropomorphic cloud formations inspired Michelangelo's portrayal of Adam's creation. A better and probably truer concoction is a scene in which he ardently defends the nudity in his paintings against protests by censorious cardinals. Nominated for four Oscars, this production unfortunately won none, despite a fantastic set that re-creates the chapel.\n\nAguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) stars the incomparable Klaus Kinski as a 16th-century Spanish soldier who goes rogue. The great Werner Herzog directed this famous German production, but don't hesitate to watch the English-dubbed version, because the actors read their lines in English and were overdubbed anyway when the location audio was too poor for release. Based loosely on historical events, Herzog's story opens with conquistador Gonzalo Pizarro crossing the Andes and descending into the upper Amazon River jungles to find the fabled golden city of El Dorado. It's a futile expedition that worsens when a reconnaissance group forges further ahead. Kinski is perfect as an overambitious soldier who becomes a megalomaniac. This violent epic is a moral tale of European colonialism, aggressive Christian evangelism, white supremacy, and raw greed. The cinematography is outstanding.\n\nAin't In It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm (2010) documents the last years of a versatile musician best known as the drummer in The Band (196777). Arkansas-born Helm (19402012) was the only American member of the famous group that sometimes backed Bob Dylan and released Music From Big Pink in 1968. This film skimps on history, though. It barely mentions Helm's roots in Ronnie Hawkins' 1950s rockabilly combo. Instead, it documents his dotage, when he played barn concerts to pay medical bills from the throat cancer that was ravaging his voice and sapping his life. It shows Helm still active but in decline, still cheerful but also bitter about The Band's financial arrangements. It's mainly for viewers already familiar with his story.\n\nAkeelah and the Bee (2006) is an uplifting drama about an 11-year-old black girl from an inner-city Los Angeles middle school who enters a national spelling bee. Writer/director Doug Atchison centers his fictional story around Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer), the precocious daughter of a single mother (Angela Bassett). Palmer was actually 11 at the time and ably fills her starring role. Bassett's part is smaller but crucial to portraying the girl's difficult family life. Laurence Fishburne has a larger role as Akeelah's stoic spelling coach. But this family-safe film would fail without good performances from all the child actors, including J.R. Villarreal and Sean Michael Afable as fellow competitors. Although it's really a thinly disguised sports movie, it's good enough to overcome the clichés.\n\nAkron (2015) starts like a typical romance drama except it's boy-meets-boy instead of boy-meets-girl. As it develops, however, the gay angle becomes incidental. The same story with a mixed-sex couple would work as well because a deeper drama emerges from the past. Although this plot turn may disappoint viewers expecting a stronger gay theme, it's refreshing that a \"gay movie\" can play it straight, so to speak. It doesn't treat the relationship as unusual. The emergent story is the hook, and the actors play it superbly. I watched this film because it was made in my home town but was pleasantly surprised that it's good for other reasons.\n\nAktfotographie  z.B Gundula Schulze (1983): see Nude Photography  e.g., Gundula Schulze.\n\nAla Kachuu  Take and Run (2020) is a 38-minute Swiss short film about a Kyrgyzstan girl who is kidnapped and forced into marriage with a stranger. It's a well made dramatization of a widely criticized custom in that country, and it deserved its Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010) is director Tim Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic fairy tale. But it's not a straight adaptation. In this version, Alice is a young woman who only vaguely remembers her childhood adventure in the dream world she calls Wonderland. It's actually called Underland, and it's a bleak underworld dominated by the evil Red Queen and her chief enforcer, a wicked dragon named Jabberwocky. This story is darker than the usual fairy tale and perhaps too frightening and violent for young children. However, the digital animation is magnificent, especially in 3D, and there are good performances by Mia Wasikowska (Alice), Johnny Depp (the Mad Hatter), and Helena Bonham Carter (the Red Queen).\n\nAlien (1979) ranks among the best sci-fi horror movies ever made. Sigourney Weaver is over-the-top excellent as a businesslike spaceship captain whose civilian crew discovers strange alien eggs. Soon their ship is infested with an awesomely hard-to-kill creature whose bloody birth has inspired numerous parodies and Internet memes. In an innovative departure from other monster movies, the creature keeps changing as it matures, appearing different in nearly every scene. Another technique for building suspense is that the spacecraft is a large, dimly lit freighter with many compartments, so we never know when the alien will spring from the darkness or what it will look like when it does. The frights keep coming until the very end. Now a classic, Alien has spawned several sequels, some equaling the original.\n\nAlien: Covenant (2017) is technically impressive and well acted, but the story is a depressing rehash of the much better original film in this long-running series (Alien, 1979). Again, the plot centers on a crew of civilian space travelers who encounter vicious alien creatures that instantly attack everything they see. One problem, however, is that only Alien fanboys will know how this installment fits into the story arc  is it a sequel, prequel, or midquel? Another problem is that it lacks the great Sigourney Weaver, although Katherine Waterston tries admirably to create another female character who battles the aliens. But the biggest problem is that the crew and their captain are implausibly clueless. Would they really explore a mysterious planet without first determining if it has dangerous predators or pathogens? And would they remain so clueless even after discovering the dangers? In one scene, the captain was so stupid that I was rooting for the aliens.\n\nAll About Eve (1950) won the Academy Award for Best Picture and remains one of the best films ever made. Ann Baxter stars as Eve Harrington, a fawning fan who ingratiates herself with Margo Channing, an aging stage actress (Bette Davis). Celeste Holm plays Margo's best friend, and both women gradually grow wary of the waif. Is she as innocent as she seems? Or is she a conniving parasite? Other characters in this multifaceted drama are Margo's lover (Gary Merrill), her skeptical assistant (Thelma Ritter), the best friend's playwright husband (Hugh Marlowe), a heavyweight theater critic (George Sanders), and his ditzy arm candy (Marilyn Monroe). It's a volatile mix that boils in several memorable scenes, and writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's adapted screenplay drips with witty dialogue. In a truly ensemble effort, everyone delivers a career performance. This classic was nominated for 14 Oscars, winning six: Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Sanders), Costume Design, and Sound. Unfortunately, split voting robbed Oscars from the Best Actress nominees (Baxter and Davis) and the Supporting Actress nominees (Holm and Ritter). It says a lot that All About Eve beat Sunset Blvd. for Best Picture.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed (2022) documents P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now), the movement that held Oxycontin, Purdue Pharma, and its Sackler-family owners responsible for the opioid drug crisis that has killed more than 400,000 people. Led by famous photographer Nan Goldin, the activists bankrupted the company, extracted $6 billion in cash, and convinced many institutions that had received Sackler donations to remove the family's name from their museums and art galleries. But the Sacklers weren't criminally prosecuted. This visually graphic film garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature. Although it traces the movement's evolution, it dwells more on Goldin's tragic family history, avant-garde photography, and sordid past. It should have been two documentaries.\n\nAll the King's Men (1949) won the Academy Award for Best Picture and remains a relevant warning against cynical populist politics. It adapts a novel that fictionalized the rise and fall of Huey Long, a Louisiana governor and senator who mesmerized rural voters in the 1920s and '30s. Broderick Crawford won Best Actor as Willie Stark, a crusading politician in the same mold. In this telling, Stark begins honestly and humbly but soon becomes power hungry and corrupt. Although his populism resembles Trumpism, this movie isn't liberal propaganda  Stark is a lefty who advocates free health care and beneficial infrastructure projects. Mercedes McCambridge won Best Supporting Actress for her debut as Stark's assistant and jilted admirer. Four other nominations included John Ireland for Supporting Actor despite his tepid performance as a reporter who becomes Stark's opposition researcher. This film was an uncharacteristically dark view of American democracy in the red-baiting Cold War era.\n\nAll Is Lost (2013) is a skillful exercise in pure cinema rarely seen since the silent-film days. Except for sound effects, music, and a few brief lines of dialogue, it's an uncluttered visual experience. Robert Redford stars as an aging sailor whose solo voyage across the Indian Ocean is interrupted by a derelict shipping container that gores the hull of his sailboat. The movie says nothing about his previous life, his occupation, or the purpose of his journey. Of his personality, we learn only by watching his reactions to adversity. And the sea soon becomes a formidable adversary when a gale threatens his emergency repairs. In lesser hands than those of writer/director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, 2011), this picture might resemble an interesting film-school experiment in minimalism. Instead, the screenplay, direction, cinematography, soundtrack, and cast all come together to create a finely crafted drama that's almost a film-school education in itself.\n\nAll the Money in the World (2017) recounts the kidnapping of oil heir John Paul Getty III by Italian gangsters in 1973. Most of the story is true: his filthy rich grandfather refused to pay the $17 million ransom, so the 16-year-old boy remained captive for months, prompting the kidnappers to resort to drastic measures. Michelle Williams delivers a standout performance as the boy's devoted but agonized mother. Christopher Plummer plays the tycoon in a nuanced performance that is both stoic and playful. (Plummer was a last-minute substitute for disgraced actor Kevin Spacey, requiring director Ridley Scott to reshoot 22 scenes and recut the film in only one month.) Mark Wahlberg plays Getty's security expert, adding some heft to repeated scenes of the mother's agony. Charlie Plummer (no relation to Christopher) portrays the young Getty but adds little. Overall, it's a good suspense tale which shows that wisdom doesn't necessarily follow wealth.\n\nAll the President's Men (1976) dramatizes the nonfiction book of the same name by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who led the exposé of the infamous Watergate scandal. In 1972, shortly before the presidential election, Republican operatives were caught breaking into the Democratic Party's national headquarters to install listening devices. Reporters soon traced the men to the Republican National Committee and the White House. When tape recordings later revealed that President Richard Nixon tried to cover up the plot by paying hush money and engaging in other crimes, he resigned in 1974. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are convincing as Woodward and Bernstein. Although this historically important movie realistically depicts investigative journalism and newspaper practice, today's viewers may get lost in the labyrinthine details of Watergate.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930) was the first film adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's famous World War I novel and was probably the first anti-war motion picture ever made. Remarque experienced the horrors of machine-age infantry combat, and this movie is a masterpiece that preserves the book's spirit. It won Oscars for Best Picture and Director (Lewis Milestone) and was nominated for Writing and Cinematography. It's impressively modern despite being such an early talkie that it was also released as a silent film. Simultaneously epic and personal, it follows the fates of young German recruits who soon learn that war isn't as romantic as they imagined. Nor does it pull punches  in one graphic scene, artillery obliterates a French soldier, leaving only his severed arms hanging from barbed wire. Lew Ayres is perfect as Paul Bäumer, the main character. Subsequent remakes are good, too, but this one endures as a timeless classic.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1979) remakes the 1930 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's famous anti-war novel about German infantrymen in World War I. Although CBS made this version for broadcast TV, the production values are unusually high. In those days, TV movies were generally low-budget productions of limited scope. This one is epic while still personalizing the horrors of modern combat through the eyes of young German recruits who seek glory but find misery. Richard Thomas  then a TV actor known as \"John-Boy\" in The Waltons  delivers a memorable performance as Paul Bäumer, the main character. Ernest Borgnine is also good as \"Kat,\" a gruff front-line veteran who shepherds the green soldiers. The original 150-minute TV version was later butchered to 129 minutes for theatrical release but is better seen uncut. It ranks among the very best TV movies ever made, winning the top Golden Globe Award and an Emmy.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (2022) deservedly won four Academy Awards and was nominated for nine, a rarity for a remake of two previous films also critically acclaimed. This one departs further from the 1930 and 1979 versions and from Erich Maria Remarque's famous 1929 novel about infantry combat in World War I. The differences don't matter, because it retains the theme of young soldiers marching enthusiastically off to war only to become disillusioned by the horrors. It's a timeless theme that never loses its impact. Felix Kammerer ably fills the boots of his 1930 and 1979 predecessors as Paul Bäumer, the main character. This retelling adds scenes depicting the negotiations to end the war and the fury of a German general who doesn't want it to end. They provide historical context and show the contrast between decision makers and foot soldiers. This graphically violent drama won Oscars for Best International Film (German), Cinematography, Original Score, and Production Design. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, Visual Effects, Sound, and Makeup & Hairstyling.\n\nAlmost Famous (2000), based on the actual experiences of director Cameron Crowe, repeats the time-worn loss-of-innocence theme in a story about a teenage journalist making his debut in Rolling Stone magazine in the 1970s. Unlike most autobiographical movies, it works surprisingly well. It also recalls a distant time when an inexperienced young writer could easily gain backstage access to major rock bands, join their rowdy adventures while reporting on them, and sell articles to a mass-circulation magazine. Today's celebrities are much more guarded and the publishing opportunities for aspiring freelancers are much less open. This movie would make a rockin' double feature with High Fidelity (2000).\n\nAlphaville (1965) tries to mix film noir, science fiction, James Bond-style adventure, and poetic philosophy  with mixed results. Directed by the late Jean-Luc Godard, this odd film is a classic example of the French New Wave movement in the 1950s and '60s. It depicts an Orwellian future in which a powerful computer called Alpha 60 subjugates a city's population by redefining their language and by executing those who behave illogically. A secret agent tries to free them from the computer's control, but he's strange. He openly and randomly photographs everything, he kills assassins and others without repercussions, and he enters secure areas without opposition. Although this picture won praise for breaking conventions, it breaks them for little gain.\n\nAmadeus was re-released in 2002 as a director's cut that restores some scenes omitted from the 1984 original. It still portrays the competition between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (a young musical genius) and Antonio Salieri (the court composer to an Austrian emperor). F. Murray Abraham won the Academy Award for Best Actor as Salieri, who is simultaneously in awe and jealous of Mozart's generational talent. Tom Hulce as Mozart was nominated for the same award, and it's a shame they didn't share the Oscar. As usual for a Hollywood production, it stretches the truth, but it's still one of the best films ever made. The restored scenes give us closer views of Mozart's decline and the unsavory relationship between Salieri and Mozart's wife. The underlying theme of rare brilliance versus high-functioning mediocrity remains intact. This blockbuster won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and has lost none of its power, drama, and spectacle.\n\nThe Amazing Colossal Man (1957) a/k/a The Colossal Man exploits the widespread fear of radiation poisoning at the dawn of the Atomic Age. This thriller shows a U.S. Army officer growing to enormous size after his accidental exposure during an atomic bomb test. It's ridiculous but played seriously by Glenn Langan as the victim and Cathy Downs as his distraught fiancée. The special effects are decent for the era as the increasingly unstable giant plays havoc in Las Vegas. This flick was popular enough to inspire a quickie sequel, War of the Colossal Beast (1958).\n\nAmazing Grace (2006) is an outstanding historical drama about the effort to outlaw slavery in the British Empire. Welsh actor Ioan Gruffudd plays William Wilberforce, a British member of Parliament who struggled for decades in the late 1700s and early 1800s to pass an antislavery bill. Gruffudd plays the role with verve and insight. All the performances in this film are excellent, with Albert Finney in an especially good supporting role as the former slave-ship captain who repented his sins and wrote the hymn \"Amazing Grace.\" When the credits roll, be sure to stay for the great bagpipe rendition of the hymn in front of Westminster Abbey, where Wilberforce is interred.\n\nAmazing Grace (2018) rescues the long-abandoned film footage of a 1972 concert by singer Aretha Franklin. Over two days before a live audience at a Baptist church in Los Angeles, famous director Sydney Pollack filmed and recorded her soul-shaking performance of gospel hymns with the Southern California Community Choir. Later that year, the record became the best-selling gospel album of all time. But Pollack's planned TV special never aired because he couldn't synchronize the audio. He died in 2008. Producer Alan Elliot bought the raw film and finished this high-spirited and spiritual documentary. It's an intimate presentation of Franklin's soaring talent and the exuberance of the mostly black audience, which included her father and two members of the Rolling Stones. Franklin was only 30 at the time, so this film is a historical treasure that shows the \"Queen of Soul\" at the peak of her brilliant career.\n\nAmelia (2009) is a middling biopic about Amelia Earhart, the famous aviatrix who vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 while trying to become the first woman to fly around the world. Hilary Swank is credible in the title role, though she looks a little young. (Earhart was 40 when she died.) Richard Gere comfortably plays her husband, a smarmy book publisher eager for the income of Earhart's career but worried about the risks she takes. Ewan McGregor plays an upper-crust love interest to whom Earhart is inexplicably attracted. The soap opera tends to overpower Earhart's flying adventures, and the conclusion misplaces some blame for her failure. (She left behind important equipment.) What I liked best: Earhart's Lockheed Electra.\n\nAmelie was one of the best foreign films of 2001. It's a whimsical tale about a young French woman in Paris who decides to perform random acts of kindness  and sometimes revenge. She is inspired by the chance discovery of childhood relics from the distant past. Her eccentric interference in other people's lives is tempered by her innocent, almost angelic philosophy. Although this film is virtually a fairy tale, it never abandons plausibility and is always entertaining.\n\nAmerica and Lewis Hine (1984) documents the 20th century's most famous labor-activist photographer. Lewis Hine (18741940) moved from teaching to photography after a field trip to Ellis Island where masses of European immigrants were disembarking in New York. Inspired by their hope and misery, Hine began photographing the people, producing a remarkable body of work. When he followed some of them to slums and workplaces, he was appalled by the poor conditions and especially by the child labor. He joined a social-reform organization and journeyed throughout the U.S., collecting information and sneaking his camera into factories and coal mines. This one-hour documentary is a good summary of his activism and photography.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol (1979) transports Charles Dickens' classic morality tale from 1843 Old England to 1933 New England. This adaptation is surprisingly good, especially for a TV movie starring an actor better known for his comedic role on a popular 1970s TV series. Henry Winkler famously played \"Fonzie\" on Happy Days, a hit show about 1950s teenagers. In this retelling of A Christmas Carol, he's Benedict Slade, an American version of Ebenezer Scrooge. A ruthless businessman, he spends Christmas Eve repossessing household goods from Depression-era customers who can't make their payments. After nightlong visitations from ghosts who expose his past, present, and future, he mends his ways. Although the tale is familiar, this screenplay is fresh, and Winkler reveals talent that sustained his career beyond the Fonz.\n\nAmerican Factory (2019) deservedly won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. After General Motors closed an assembly plant near Dayton, Ohio, idling thousands of workers, a Chinese company (Fuyao) revived the factory to manufacture automotive glass. Fuyao imported hundreds of Chinese supervisors, which goes smoothly at first. Trouble starts when production falls short. Chinese managers complain that American workers are inefficient and clumsy. Attempts to import Chinese business practices are unwelcome. Then the Americans campaign to join a union. Despite communist ideology that champions workers over bosses, the bosses are openly hostile to the revolt. This outstanding film shows both perspectives, including some astonishing candid moments you'd expect to happen off camera. Neither communism nor capitalism look pretty here.\n\nAmerican Fiction (2023) deserves its Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (and four other Oscar nominations) as the cleverest and most topical film of the year. Jeffrey Wright was nominated Best Actor for playing Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, an erudite black author of erudite novels that sell poorly. Dismayed by the popularity of other black-authored novels that hype black-culture stereotypes, he writes one himself under a pseudonym as a prank. Surprise! A publisher offers a large advance, and a filmmaker dangles even more cash for the movie rights. Thus begins Ellison's descent into an increasingly complex deception. This dark comedy by writer/director Cord Jefferson lampoons white liberals, black opportunists, Hollywood exploitation, and the monetary rewards for lowbrow entertainment. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Sterling K. Brown as Ellison's brother), and Original Score (Laura Karpman).\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973) was the sleeper hit that made director George Lucas famous and enabled him to make Star Wars (1977). At the behest of producer Francis Ford Coppola, Lucas began working on American Graffiti in 1971 while finishing his first feature film, THX 1138, an adaptation of a 15-minute student film he made in 1967 (Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB). But American Graffiti isn't science fiction. Drawn from Lucas's own experiences, teenagers cruise around town in cars and frequent a Mel's Drive-In Diner in Modesto, California in 1962. It's a light drama that tells parallel stories. The cast includes young actors who, like Lucas, soon won fame: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Harrison Ford, Kathleen Quinlan, Suzanne Somers, and Paul Le Mat. Although its view of mid-century America is nostalgic, its appeal is timeless.\n\nAmerican Hustle is one of the best films of 2013. Often compared with The Sting (1973), it's not quite as sublime but holds its own. It's very loosely based on the Abscam scandal of the 1970s, in which the FBI trapped several members of the U.S. Congress taking bribes from a fake Arab sheik. The cast is uniformly excellent: Christian Bale as a small-time con man who is unwillingly pulled into the big time; Jennifer Lawrence as his spectacularly clueless wife; Amy Adams as his sexy lover and brilliant partner in crime; Bradley Cooper as an ambitious FBI agent; Jeremy Renner as a populist New Jersey mayor; Robert De Niro as a mob boss; and numerous supporters who make the most of their smaller roles. As with The Sting, the plot gets complicated and ends with a surprise, so pay attention. The opening scene of Bale meticulously prepping his toupee symbolizes the cheap subterfuge that nevertheless fools the gullible. In addition to its great performances, this film's strength is its portrayal of money and power flowing behind the wedded worlds of hardball politics and greasy business.\n\nAn American Journey (2009), a/k/a An American Journey in Robert Frank's Footsteps, is a documentary that revisits the locations of some iconic photographs from Robert Frank's The Americans, the most influential photobook of the 20th century. French filmmaker Philippe Seclier achieves mixed results, however. Fifty years after Frank took his revealing black-and-white pictures during cross-country road trips, little remains. Seclier does find two subjects: a black woman whom Frank photographed on a motorcycle, and a white man who's sure he was the young boy at a July 4th town festival. Neither remembers being photographed, and their interviews aren't very interesting. Most other subjects and locations have disappeared. Unfortunately, Seclier interleaves these segments with footage of his own American journey  a vision blurry and jerky, apparently shot with a handheld 8mm camera from a moving car. Frank fans will likely be disappointed.\n\nAmerican Sniper (2014) is the most representative movie yet made about the Iraq War  because, like the war, it's a pack of lies. It's based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL sniper who scored more than 160 kills during four combat tours. But director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Jason Hall start hallucinating from the very first scene, when Kyle must decide whether to shoot a child carrying a grenade. (Never happened, according to Kyle's book.) They continue by fabricating additional characters (\"The Butcher\") and by building much of the drama around an enemy sniper who gets only passing mention in Kyle's book and whom Kyle never killed. Hollywood filmmakers always fictionalize true stories to some extent, but this film is shameless. As a final insult, Eastwood doesn't show us how Kyle died, probably because this genuine war hero didn't fall heroically in combat. Instead, he died by foolishly thinking that a shooting range would be good therapy for a shell-shocked veteran  who abruptly lost control when a gun was placed in his hands. Although the movie is filled with graphic combat scenes, the climax of Kyle's life story was apparently too ironic and contradictory to merit the same treatment.\n\nAmerican Splendor (2003) is one of the best films of the year. Part documentary, part drama, part animation, it's the autobiographical story of Harvey Pekar, author of the autobiographical comic books \"American Splendor.\" Yes, this movie is endlessly self-referential, but it never seems gimmicky. The real Pekar appears in some scenes and narrates the flashback episodes dramatized by actor Paul Giamatti. It's hard to believe that a chronically depressed file clerk at a VA hospital in Cleveland could become a cult figure in underground comics. But it really happened, and this artfully made film shows how, without losing its sense of humor.\n\nAmerican Symphony (2023) profiles polymath musician Jon Batiste during an especially difficult period when he was composing and arranging an orchestral performance for Carnegie Hall while his wife suffered a relapse of leukemia. This intimate documentary by Matthew Heineman showcases Batiste's versatile musical talent and his loving relationship with Suleika \"Boo\" Jaouad, whom he married in 2022. Batiste won fame when his band Stay Human appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert from 2015 to 2022. His music has also won five Grammy Awards and an Oscar. Working at close quarters, Heineman reveals the highs and lows of two people struggling to beat the odds, both professionally and personally. It's one of the year's best documentaries.\n\nAmerican Teen (2008) is the best documentary about the pressure on young people to succeed since Hoop Dreams (1994). Filmmaker Nanette Burstein follows several high-school seniors in a conservative middle-class town in Indiana. She focuses on a socially wicked beauty queen, a nervous basketball star, a girl who wants to be an artist but is starting to feel trapped, a nerdy misfit who's clumsy with girls, and their circle of friends. As in Hoop Dreams, all these teens are beginning to realize that their futures depend on choices they make now  and on circumstances they cannot control. Will the beauty queen fulfill her father's fantasy of entering Notre Dame? Will the basketball star win a college scholarship or settle for the army? Will the art girl escape her small town for an expensive education in San Francisco? Will the pimply nerd find love? The drama is emotional and all too real. It's terrifying when these kids begin to perceive  or are told  that their futures aren't limitless.\n\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981) won a cult following despite (or because of) its odd mix of horror, gore, and comedy. The premise is fairly conventional: during a full moon, a cursed human unwittingly becomes a werewolf and bites someone. Victims who survive become werewolves themselves. The only deviation from canon is that dead victims exist in an undead limbo until the werewolf who fatally bit them is killed. This wrinkle sets up a few scenes played for laughs when two friends are caught in the curse. Additional attempts at comedy often fall flat, such as a Scotland Yard detective's lame imitations of Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies. Another fault is irrelevant scenes of graphic violence, such as Nazis in Halloween masks bursting into a home and machine-gunning a family. (It was incongruous even before random mass shootings became common.) The best few minutes of this thriller are one victim's initial transformation into a werewolf, which won Rick Baker the first-ever Academy Award for Best Makeup.\n\nAmy (2015) is an Oscar-winning documentary about Amy Winehouse, the talented British jazz singer who died of alcohol abuse in 2011 at age 27. For this era of ubiquitous media, director Asif Kapadia dispenses with the customary talking-head interviews. Instead, he employs home movies, amateur video, news footage, paparazzi photos, and snapshots. He overlays these ready-made cinéma vérité clips with audio-only interviews of Amy's family, friends, colleagues, and a bodyguard. The result is an uncommonly intimate retrospective of Amy's journey from childhood to stardom to flame-out. Although she released only two albums during her brief career, this film confirms her talent and leaves us mourning the unrealized potential of her life and artistry.\n\nAndy Warhol's Dracula (1974): see Blood for Dracula.\n\nAndy Warhol's Frankenstein (1973): see Flesh for Frankenstein.\n\nAngel Face (1953) ends with one of the most shocking scenes in Hollywood history, especially for a picture made in the staid 1950s. Robert Mitchum stars as a World War II veteran struggling to save money for his dream business, a hot-rod auto garage. Although Mitchum plays his usual type  a laconic no-nonsense guy  it's a good type. Soon he meets a beautiful but conniving heiress who gradually lures him into trouble. Jean Simmons skillfully plays this role as a femme fatale who flirts with redemption. The plot is twisty, the dialogue impressive, and the surprising climax left audiences aghast in 1953. It still does today.\n\nAngel Heart (1987) blends neo-noir intrigue with gory horror in an atmospheric thriller that sadly crashes at the end. Mickey Rourke is outstanding as Harry Angel, a grizzled private detective hired to find a missing person. Robert De Niro is typically excellent as the creepy client who hires him. But it's Rourke who dominates. He's the rare actor who seems born to play every decrepit character he plays in every film. Unfortunately, the last act in this one collapses in confusion. The plot is so nonsensical that writer/director Alan Parker resorts to writing monologues for two characters in a desperate attempt to explain it. There's also a weird bloody sex scene that was controversial because it features Lisa Bonet, who at the time played a child character on the TV comedy The Cosby Show. Until the messy climax, however, this picture is an engrossing thrill ride.\n\nAnger Management (2003) pairs juvie-humor boy Adam Sandler with old pro Jack Nicholson, and Sandler looks like cardboard in comparison. He plays a timid, underachieving 35-year-old executive secretary who ends up in court-ordered anger-management therapy with shrink Nicholson after a trumped-up charge of assault against a flight attendant. Sandler never seems to come alive in this tepid flick, while Nicholson romps like a crazed buffalo. Let's hope master Jack passed on a few tips about real comedy to Sandler, whose adolescent routines are wearing thin.\n\nThe Angry Red Planet (1959) typifies bad science fiction at the dawn of the Space Age. The low budget (reportedly $200k) and tight schedule (nine shooting days) are no excuse for the dreadful dialogue and awful acting. Director Ib Melchior wrote the screenplay with Sidney W. Pink, who also conceived the story of a Mars mission that meets an unfriendly reception. Although the concept isn't half bad, the script suffers from painfully silly banter and cringeworthy male-female relations. The mission commander is played by Gerald Mohr, who specializes in smirking. Naura Hayden stiffly plays his space candy. The only highlights of this bomb are eerie Mars scenes filmed on b&w stock that was solarized and tinted red, and a creepy creature that's part rat, bat, crab, and spider.\n\nAnnihilation (2018) is an outstanding science-fiction thriller about a mysterious alien environment that suddenly appears on Earth and begins spreading. Men sent into the zone immediately lose radio contact and never return  until one soldier, a year later, finally does. But he can't describe what happened to him and his comrades, so his wife  a biologist and former soldier herself  joins yet another team to investigate. In an unusual departure for a Hollywood film, all the stars are women, led by Natalie Portman as the desperate wife and Jennifer Jason Leigh as a cold psychologist. In a lesser role, Oscar Isaac plays the lone-survivor soldier. Great special effects, occasional jolts of violence, and an overall creepiness make this story compelling. The twister ending is a mind bender.\n\nThe Anniversary Party (2001), shot in a few weeks in digital video, is spontaneous, energetic, satiric, and tragic  but never boring. It's the story of a recently reconciled Hollywood couple that throws a sixth-anniversary party with friends and neighbors. Powerful emotions are always flowing beneath the surface and often bubble to the top as the party swings out of control. It reminds me of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?, though less claustrophobic, and with the setting transferred from academia to the Hollywood entertainment elite. You needn't be an insider to get the jokes.\n\nAnomalisa (2015) is an unusual independent film that uses puppet stop-motion animation to tell a rather bleak story of a man with a bleak life. The main character is a semifamous author of a business book on customer relations. During a trip to deliver an inspirational talk to customer-service reps, he has a potentially life-changing experience. Although he suffers from a disorienting brain disorder that makes every person's face and voice seem identical, he meets a young woman whose actual face and voice are distinct. To him, she's an anomaly, and her name is Lisa (thus \"Anomalisa\"). This interesting film was funded as a Kickstarter project and is thoroughly professional, but it's vaguely unsettling. Be forewarned that it's not an animated movie for kids. The language and sex scenes are definitely for adults.\n\nAnother Earth (2011) poses a fascinating question: What would happen if we suddenly discovered in our solar system an exact duplicate of Earth  a real planet with identical people and our same history? Unfortunately, the movie never answers this question. Instead, the science-fiction aspect becomes a mere backdrop for a personal drama about a teenage girl who wrecks her bright future in a horrific car accident. The new question: Can she atone for her sin? The result is a good drama, but the backdrop is more tantalizing than the action on center stage. And instead of meeting the challenge of writing their final scene, the screenwriters abruptly cut to black and roll credits. Nevertheless, there is some promising filmmaking here, so maybe they will make another film that's better than Another Earth.\n\nAnother Thin Man (1939) is the third installment in the popular six-picture series that began with The Thin Man in 1934. William Powell returns as detective Nick Charles, along with Myrna Loy as Nora, his detective-wannabe wife. Their dog Asta also reappears, but his comic role is subdued this time. What's new is their baby, the result of Nora's pregnancy disclosed in the previous film (After the Thin Man, 1936). The by-now familiar formula ensnares the family in a confusing murder mystery that hard-drinking Nick reluctantly investigates. As usual, the climax features a rowdy crowd of suspects and Nick's reveal of the real killer. Although this installment isn't quite as good as the first two, it's worth watching for its witty banter, amusing characters, a rumba-dance nightclub scene, and the uncredited cameo of \"Three Stooges\" Shemp Howard.\n\nAntares (2004) begins with one kind of bang and follows with bangs of the sexually explicit type. This Austrian drama is about three troubled couples in Vienna, but some scenes resemble hard-core porn  especially the extramarital trysts between an attractive night nurse and her man-of-few-words lover. Another couple entangles a dishonest foreign immigrant with a hyper-jealous girlfriend. The third couple is actually no longer a couple, but the abusive guy doesn't get the message. To make these bleak stories marginally more interesting, events appear out of sequence and their paths eventually intersect. German with English subtitles.\n\nAnts! (1977) is an above-average made-for-TV movie about poisonous insects attacking a resort hotel. Despite the low budget and short shooting schedule of 1970s TV movies, it has decent special effects. Also, like others of its kind, it features some recognizable stars, including Myrna Loy as the wheelchair-bound hotel owner, Suzanne Somers as a blonde-bombshell real-estate agent, Brian Dennehy as a fire chief, and retired footballer Bernie Casey as a construction worker.\n\nAny Given Sunday (2000) is an old-school football movie that's marred by choppy Oliver Stone editing. At times I half-expected to see a young Ronald Reagan reprising his role as the Gipper.\n\nThe Apartment (1960) is a must-see for three reasons: It's a classic rom-com on par with its contemporaries, such as Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961); it features great acting by Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray; and it's a stark but nonpreachy depiction of corporate sexual harassment. Lemmon shines as a lowly insurance accountant whose superiors bully him into lending his bachelor apartment for their extramarital trysts. MacMurray plays his top boss, another weasel. MacLaine is alternately sexy and vulnerable as an elevator operator whom everyone wants to date. Above all, Lemmon's effusive energy drives this story through many comic situations and dramatic plot turns. A rowdy office Christmas party and the blatant sexual exploitation should make us cringe at these images from a bygone era, except similar things still happen today. Like many other films directed by Billy Wilder, this one is essential and timeless.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979) poses as a Vietnam War movie but is really a bizarre end-time allegory. Very loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness (1899), it stars Martin Sheen as a young U.S. Army officer adrift in the war. Then he's assigned to command a small river patrol boat to a remote Cambodian jungle, where he's supposed to assassinate Colonel Walter Kurtz, a Green Beret who has gone rogue with a force of irregulars. It's a distasteful mission that grows more dangerous with every mile through hostile territory. Sheen delivers a great career performance. Marlon Brando plays Kurtz as a mumbling philosophical enigma who's either a fatal realist or a hopeless madman. Other memorable characters are Robert Duvall as a gung-ho Air Cavalry officer and Dennis Hopper as a manic photojournalist. Multiple versions of this film exist with different endings. Some omit a stopover at a French rubber plantation that symbolizes oblivious complacency despite impending doom. Any version is a masterpiece. Nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Director, it won only for Cinematography and Sound.\n\nApocalypto (2006) is a startling film directed by Mel Gibson and cowritten with Farhad Safinia, a heretofore unknown screenwriter. It faces the same challenge as science fiction: depict an alien world that is different enough to be fascinating, but familiar enough so the audience can identify with the characters. In this case, the alien world is from the past, not the future  the Mayan empire on the cusp of its downfall to Spanish conquistadors. But white men make only a token appearance in this extraordinary picture. The main characters are primitive hunter-gatherers whom the Mayans ruthlessly conquer, enslave, and sacrifice to pagan gods. The story centers on one victim who tries desperately to escape so he can save his pregnant wife and young son. It's a compelling drama of epic proportions that always remains very personal. It's also frequently violent, sometimes gratuitously so. Will the Christians who embraced Gibson's The Passion of the Christ (2004) forgive this film's extreme violence, even though it's not against Jesus?\n\nApollo 11 (2019) dramatically documents the first manned moon landing in July 1969. Released near the 50th anniversary, it resurrects a surprising amount of film footage rarely or never seen outside NASA. Thus it appears fresh even to people who remember the TV coverage that followed every step of the mission. For younger people experiencing the Apollo 11 excitement for the first time, it must seem like science fiction. Did we really accomplish such feats using the relatively ancient technology of half a century ago? We did, and this documentary shows the men, women, and machines that made it happen. Although Apollo 11 unabashedly celebrates a historic triumph, the subtle subtext is that it's faded history, because we haven't fulfilled the potential that Project Apollo revealed.\n\nThe April Fools (1969) is an amusing rom-com starring Jack Lemmon, Catherine Deneuve, and Peter Lawford. It's also a time capsule of the late-1960s psychedelic era, particularly in the opening party scene and later visits to swank nightclubs. But these characters are martini-class swingers, not ragged hippies. Lemmon plays a newly promoted Wall Street investment manager working for Lawford, who's living large in his expensive Manhattan apartment adorned with bizarre modern art. Deneuve is the boss's unhappy wife who is spontaneously attracted to straight-laced Lemmon. Good supporting actors include Sally Kellerman as Lemmon's ice-cold wife, Jack Weston as his alcoholic lawyer, Harvey Korman as a philandering friend, and Myrna Loy and Charles Boyer as an eccentric rich couple. Although the last act indulges in too much happy-drunk slapstick, overall this movie is entertaining and shows why Deneuve became the queen of French cinema.\n\nArakimentari (2004) is an interesting documentary on Nobuyoshi Araki, a famous/infamous Japanese photographer known mainly for his erotica. Although his work spans a wide spectrum  he photographs almost everything  his graphic images of nude women who are sometimes bound in ropes have challenged Japanese morals, earned him celebrity-class fame, and provoked the wrath of \"Me-Too\" activists. His erotic photography veers from innocuous poses to soft porn, often in the same session with the same model. And his models range from beautiful young women to average middle-aged housewives. Although this film includes a few critical comments, it's mostly complimentary and was made before the Me-Too movement. Be warned: it's graphically frank.\n\nArgo (2012) is based on the true story of six Americans who were rescued after the U.S. embassy in Teheran was seized by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979. While their embassy colleagues were captured and held hostage, these six people slipped away and found temporary refuge at the Canadian ambassador's house. In an audacious rescue mission kept classified until the 1990s, the CIA worked with the Canadians to spirit the Americans out of the country. Ben Affleck directed and stars in this well-made drama, which remains suspenseful even when you know how it ends. Be sure to stay through the final credits to see side-by-side pictures of the actors and the real escapees they portray  and to hear a voiceover by former president Jimmy Carter, who approved the mission.\n\nArmored Attack (1957): see The North Star (1943).\n\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004) is a mediocre Disney remake of the classic Jules Verne adventure story. A Victorian Englishman wagers that he can circle the globe in less than 80 days, but this version stars martial-arts acrobat Jackie Chan as the Englishman's servant, which spawns a Chinese subplot about a stolen Buddha. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a cameo role as a Middle Eastern prince on the prowl for additional wives. This movie is passable entertainment for children and tolerable for adults.\n\nArrival (2016) is a brain-bending science-fiction drama about the first contact with extraterrestrials. After 12 mysterious ships arrive at various locations around the globe, scientists struggle to establish communication with the mysterious creatures. Their verbal language seems unintelligible at first, so an American linguist (the always-excellent Amy Adams) tries to decipher their emoji. She gets help from a physicist (Jeremy Renner) and a gruff Army colonel (Forest Whitaker). Meanwhile, the world is going crazy with fear, and some people want a first strike. But this movie departs from the usual alien-invasion scripts. The surprising conclusion will mystify, not satisfy, if you don't pay attention to every word from the very beginning and assemble clues in flashbacks and flash-forwards. For the aliens, time is nonlinear, and so is this fascinating film.\n\nArsenic and Old Lace (1944) is one of the most famous screwball comedies of Hollywood's Golden Age. Based on a popular stage play, it has a dark side: two elderly aunts living in a dilapidated old house are serial killers. They lure old bachelors into their home and serve poisoned wine to relieve the men's \"suffering.\" The aunts' delusional nephew Teddy, who thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt, buries the bodies in the basement. Into this bizarre household come two more nephews: a normal one who's bewildered when he discovers the secret (Cary Grant), and a black sheep who's a conventional murderer (Raymond Massey). Peter Lorre plays the latter's accomplice. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair overshadow those stars as the innocently guilty aunties. Frank Capra directed this odd romp, and the broad humor ages fairly well.\n\nThe Artful Penetration of Barbara (1969): see Attraction.\n\nThe Artist took balls to produce  a silent film made in 2011. And black-and-white, of course. But the palette suits the subject. French actor Jean Dujardin is thoroughly convincing as a 1927 silent-film star loosely based on Rudolph Valentino. Even as he's idolized by a younger actress (wonderful Bérénice Bejo), the advent of talkies threatens his stardom. This remarkable picture expertly echoes a 1920s silent film, complete with title cards, music, visual effects, art direction, characterization, humor, and plotting. It's not a gimmick  it works, and it's gorgeous. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it won five: Best Picture, Director, Actor (Dujardin), Costume Design, and Original Score.\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1950) remains one of the great film-noir caper thrillers. Director John Huston stirs a superb cast into a tense screenplay. Sterling Hayden stars as a street-smart hooligan hired as the strongman for a big-time jewel robbery. Sam Jaffe plays the brilliant mastermind of the plot who's obsessed to distraction with nubile young women. Louis Calhern is a crooked lawyer who's supposed to bankroll the job. James Whitmore has a smaller but juicy role as a greasy-spoon diner owner who joins the crew. Pre-fame Marilyn Monroe appears as the lawyer's young lover, and Jean Hagen is the hooligan's frazzled ex-girl. Additional character actors are no less impressive, and their chemistry is explosive. The climax shows that even good dreams can be nightmarish.\n\nAt Eternity's Gate (2018) mimics Post-Impressionism to dramatize the last miserable but prolific years of Vincent Van Gogh's life. Director Julian Schnabel employs shaky cinematography, tinted color, partial blurring, and first-person views to mirror the artistic techniques that Van Gogh employed in his famous 19th-century paintings. Although Schanbel's style is creative, it's sometimes annoying. Willem Dafoe stars as the eccentric Dutch painter who produced most of his masterworks while barely surviving on his brother's charity in France. In two particularly insightful scenes, Van Gogh tries to explain himself to a priest in a mental institution and to a curious portrait subject. Dafoe was nominated as Best Actor for his heartfelt performance. Watch the end credits for a coda that quotes Paul Gaugin, Van Gogh's friend and fellow artist.\n\nThe Atomic Brain (1963) is a British thriller originally titled Monstrosity that was retitled for the U.S. market. A rich old woman pays a rogue doctor to experiment with brain transplants so she can hijack the body of a beautiful young woman. He starts by transplanting animal brains into humans, with unpleasant results. The actors in this low-budget movie are earnest, but they can't overcome the weak script and murky cinematography.\n\nAtonement (2007) is a tear-jerker that's artfully done but doesn't quite live up to its hype. James McAvoy stars as a young groundskeeper on an English estate in the 1930s. He falls in love with the upper-class young lady of the house, played by Keira Knightley. Class division is usually the lovers' obstacle in dramas of this ilk, but Atonement veers in another direction by presenting a series of events that a child eyewitness misinterprets. As a result, the lovers are separated and spend the rest of the movie yearning to reunite. The ambiguity of observation is a common thread in this story, with things often turning out differently than they first appear to be. Ironically, the best performance is by Vanessa Redgrave in one of the film's smallest roles.\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) affirms that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Allison Hayes stars as a wealthy woman with a philandering husband. Everyone thinks she's hallucinating when she reports a close encounter of the third kind: a giant who emerges from a \"satellite\" (UFO) and who tries to snatch her diamond pendant. Later she's infected with that catch-all catalyst of 1950s sci-fi  radiation  and starts growing. Now her whoring hubby is in real trouble. This low-budget stinker has become a campy pop-culture classic.\n\nAttraction a/k/a The Artful Penetration of Barbara a/k/a Black on White (Italian: nEROSubianco, 1969) is an erotic Italian art film. It's a dreamy collage of surrealistic scenes with psychedelic rock music, occasional narration, and almost no dialogue. The bare plot features a lovely young woman who is stalked in London by a mysterious smiling stranger. The Black on White title (\"nerosubianco\" in Italian) refers to the stalker, a young black man, and the woman, who is white. Nothing much happens, but there's lots of nudity, soft-porn sex, political commentary, and visual symbolism. Approach this film as an artifact of late-1960s sex-lib culture.\n\nAugust: Osage County (2013) is a depressing drama based on a stage play about a dysfunctional Oklahoma family. Meryl Streep plays the matriarch, an aging wreck addicted to prescription drugs. Her husband (Sam Shepard) is an alcoholic poet who peaked in 1965. Her three adult children include an embittered daughter with a crumbling marriage (Julia Roberts), a clueless floozy with a creepy fiancée (Juliette Lewis), and a spinster in love with her first cousin (Julianne Nicholson). And then there are the crass in-laws... Things go from bad to worse as the family gathers at the mother's house in 108-degree summer heat and engages in reverse group therapy. Even the casting is perverse. Benedict Cumberbatch, a very British actor who plays Sherlock Holmes as an insensitive genius in the popular PBS series, here plays a sensitive dunce from the American heartland. A double feature of this movie and another bleak film made in the same county in 2012 (To the Wonder) should be enough to keep anyone away from Oklahoma.\n\nAustin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me (2000) is moderately funny, though too heavy on the juvenile toilet humor.\n\nAuto Focus (2002) is a sordid film about the sordid personal life of Bob Crane, star of the 1960s TV sitcom Hogan's Heroes. On the surface, Crane was a happily married, religious family man. But when he was off the set and away from home, he reveled in a dark world of sex orgies, strip clubs, and one-night stands. His best friend was a sleazy video-camera salesman, expertly played by Willem Dafoe. For years, they avidly photographed and videotaped their female conquests. Unfortunately, lead actor Greg Kinnear never quite captures the wisecracking charm of the real Bob Crane, which undercuts the incongruity of Crane's double life. We're left with the sleaze, but not much else.\n\nAvalon (1990) is a beautiful drama about four generations of 20th-century immigrants in Baltimore. After a brief intro in 1914, it jumps to the late 1940s and ends with a brief climax in the 1970s. Most of the story happens shortly after World War II as the families launch new businesses, eager to advance into the upper middle class. As they integrate into American life, however, they gradually lose their old-world traditions  not always for the better. We see their experiences mainly through the eyes of a third-generation boy, artfully played by a young Elijah Wood. Aidan Quinn plays his loving father, and Armin Mueller-Stahl is his first-generation grandfather. In addition to being a superb family drama, this movie resurrects the postwar period in vivid detail. The costumes, props, and sets are extraordinary, and the camera floats over them leisurely instead of limiting us to the quick glimpses common in other period films. It was nominated for four Oscars, including Original Screenplay, Cinematography, Music, and Costume Design.\n\nAvatar (2009) is a spectacular special-effects extravaganza. And it's available in 3D! Actually, the effects aren't \"special\"  they are the whole movie. Director James Cameron of Titanic fame crafted new techniques and cameras that merge live action with computer graphics so seamlessly that Avatar lives up to its considerable hype. The story is basically the same as Dances With Wolves (1990), except the wounded combat veteran controls a genetically engineered body, the Indians are blue-skinned space aliens with tails, the wolf is a flying dragon, and the unsympathetic U.S. Cavalry are corporate mercenaries riding helicopter gunships. The conflict rages over a valuable mineral on a faraway planet, with the indigenous people simply in the way. Avatar is a genuine technical achievement with soul, although the villain is overdrawn. But is it the future of filmmaking, as Cameron claims? Only in this genre. Real faces of real actors will never go out of style.\n\nThe Avengers (2012) is an extravagant summer blockbuster based on Marvel Comics characters, including Nick Fury, Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. They unite as agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to repeal an invasion of Earth by evil space invaders. Action scenes dominate the movie, interrupted mainly by the team's intramural squabbling. But Marvel Comics fans know the climax is never in doubt. Although the special effects are spectacular, these summer action movies are like watching someone else play a videogame.\n\nThe Aviator (2004) is a fascinating biopic about millionaire Howard Hughes, though it ends in the late 1940s before he became the world's most famous recluse in Las Vegas. Instead, it focuses on Hughes' early life as a would-be film mogul, seducer of Hollywood actresses, and aviation pioneer. This phase of his life was later obscured by his bizarre eccentricities, which only makes the film more fresh and interesting. Although it foreshadows his mental illness, it also highlights his brilliance. A star-studded cast includes Cate Blanchett, whose portrayal of Katherine Hepburn is startling.\n\nAway We Go (2009) is a cute but substantial film about a couple in their 30s expecting their first baby. Impending parenthood weighs heavily on their shoulders, spurring them to make changes  mainly, to find a new city in which to live. They travel to Arizona, Wisconsin, Canada, and Florida, visiting old friends and family. Each trip brings surprises as they discover that normalcy isn't as normal as they thought. John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph deliver offbeat but believable performances as the expectant couple, aided by an unusually good supporting cast. The story swings from comedy to philosophy, often in the same scene, rarely losing its balance. Although the ending feels a bit strained, there's a lot to like here.\n\nThe Awful Truth (1937) made Cary Grant a first-class star and launched his run of screwball comedies. He plays a wealthy New Yorker who abruptly asks his wife for divorce and is surprised when she accepts. Irene Dunne plays this role with equal energy and comic timing, which led to more of their pairings in future films. The laughs come fast when it's obvious they're still in love but don't want to admit it. Their attempts to make each other jealous lead to several funny situations, and their ornery little dog is an able co-star. Director Leo McCarey won an Academy Award for his improvisational style. Additional nominations included Best Picture, Actress (Dunne), Supporting Actor (Ralph Bellamy), Adaptation, and Film Editing. The last scene is overlong because it was tamed to pass the censors.\n\n********** B **********\n\nThe Babadook (2014) is a mysterious spook who emerges from a children's book to terrorize a widowed single mom and her hyperactive six-year-old son. To build suspense, this Australian horror flick repeatedly teases the spook's hidden appearance. Although Essie Davis (the mom) and Noah Wiseman (the son) are convincing, the story is merely average. It's more about the frustrations of a harried mother trying to cope with an unruly child; the spook is almost a bit player.\n\nBabel (2006) is a disappointment. Too bad, because the directing, acting, cinematography, score, and sound editing are first-class. Even the writing glows. The problem is that screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga had three good stories and couldn't decide which one to emphasize, so he mashed them together into a loose chain of subplots. Then, to smooth over the rough joints, the stories unfold out of order. One story is about an American tourist in Morocco wounded in a shooting; another is about the Mexican nanny who cares for her children back home; and the third is about a deaf Japanese schoolgirl in search of sex. The sum of these parts is a mess  all the more frustrating because this could have been a great picture. Indeed, it's so brimming with talent that it was nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, despite its flaws.\n\nBaby Boom (1987) finds comedy in single-mom hardship by casting Diane Keaton as an upper-middle-class marketing executive who unwittingly inherits an infant from a foreign cousin she's never met. Women who want to \"have it all\"  an ambitious career and a nurturing motherhood  was an especially popular theme in the 1980s. Although this portrayal is highly contrived, Keaton's manic acting style carries the film. Harold Ramis and Sam Shepard have small parts as boyfriends, but most of the male characters are unhelpful accessories.\n\nBaby Driver (2017) is one of the best car-chase movies on film. Little-known Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars and Divergent, 2014) stars as Baby, a young man who ceaselessly listens to music on his Apple iPod to drown out his chronic tinnitus. When he accidentally becomes indebted to a master criminal, he's forced to become a getaway driver for a series of daring robberies. Luckily, he's a wizard behind the wheel, but his skills only get him ensnared more deeply. The getaway chases are the highlights of this thrill ride, always synchronized to Baby's iPod soundtrack. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx deliver great performances as creepy criminals.\n\nBaby Face Nelson (1957) improbably stars Mickey Rooney as a sociopathic killer in a crime drama based on a real 1930s gangster. But Rooney, an underrated actor, delivers a capable performance. Carolyn Jones (later Morticia in The Addams Family 1960s TV series) is smoothly sexy as his gun moll. Other notables are Elisha Cook Jr. as a fellow crook, Jack Elam as their heist planner, and Cedric Hardwicke as a drunken doctor. Although this low-budget picture has lots of action, it's wildly inaccurate and lacks the angst and atmosphere that make a great film noir.\n\nBabylon (2022) simultaneously celebrates and denigrates Hollywood but ultimately is a tribute to the motion-picture industry. Be warned that at times it's sexually graphic and violent, and the dialogue is always coarse. It's also more than three hours long, though never boring. It opens during the 1920s silent-film era when Hollywood was awash in money, sex, drugs, and scandals. Little-known Diego Calva stars as a young Mexican immigrant yearning for even the lowliest job on a movie set. During a huge depraved party at a producer's mansion, he falls in love with a young woman who's eager to become an actress. Margot Robbie nails this role and should have been nominated for an Oscar. Brad Pitt adeptly plays a silent-film star who has trouble adapting to talkies. This production is extravagant in depicting Hollywood extravagance and decadence, sometimes exaggerated. Babylon achieves the rarity of being both revolting and uplifting.\n\nBackfire (1950) is an excellent film noir about a pair of World War II veterans hoping to build successful civilian lives. They want to start a cattle ranch but are sidetracked into an underworld of gambling and murder. Gordon MacRae stars as the seriously wounded half of the pair who emerges from a veterans' hospital mostly cured but desperate to find his now-missing buddy (Edmond O'Brien). O'Brien's performance outshines MacRae's, who seems out of place here. Virginia Mayo co-stars as MacRae's nurse and fiancée. She excels in one tense scene in which she burgles a doctor's office to find a medical record crucial to the mystery. The usual film-noir twists and turns aren't too difficult to follow, and the surprise climax is well done.\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful (1952) draws an unflattering but entertaining portrait of Hollywood. Three flashbacks unmask a producer who crosses his lovers, friends, and colleagues. The cast is great: Kirk Douglas as the disloyal producer, Barry Sullivan as his director friend, Walter Pidgeon as his first studio boss, Lana Turner as an alcoholic actress, Dick Powell as a novelist/screenwriter, and Gloria Grahame as the writer's Southern belle wife. Though less eccentric than Sunset Blvd. (1950)  a contemporary Hollywood exposé  it's a rare drama whose central character is magnetic but detestable. He also typifies the cutthroats in any industry. One highlight is a rowdy scene in which Douglas spars with Turner. The ambiguous climax is brilliant. Nominated for six Academy Awards, it won five: Supporting Actress (Grahame), Screenplay, Art Direction (b&w), Cinematography (b&w), and Costume Design (b&w). Douglas was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Gary Cooper in High Noon.\n\nBad Day at Black Rock (1955) is a Western placed in 1945 instead of the Old West. Nevertheless, the theme is familiar: a stranger comes to town and upsets the locals by encroaching on a dark secret. Spencer Tracy stars as the stranger, a crippled World War II veteran on a mysterious mission. Although Tracy looks old for the part, combat can prematurely age a man, and his war-weary, passive performance is right for his character. The supporting cast is superb: Robert Ryan as the town's alpha male, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine as the town bullies, Walter Brennan as a sympathetic doctor/undertaker, Dean Jagger as the drunken sheriff, Russell Collins as a terrified telegrapher, and Anne Francis as the token female in this taut testosterone drama. The secret is easy to guess, but the suspense lies in how the stranger will extricate himself from his predicament.\n\nBad Girl (1931) has aged poorly despite its Best Picture nomination and Oscars for Best Director and Adapted Screenplay. The movie's alluring title and sexy publicity poster are the 1930s versions of click-bait. The \"bad girl\" is Sally Eilers as an innocent department-store model who's skeptical of marriage. James Dunn plays a radio repairman who's equally skeptical. Their improbable union and misunderstandings form the weakly beating heart of this early rom-com. It has some witty dialogue, though, including quips that would likely have been censored a few years later when the Hays Code clamped down on Hollywood.\n\nThe Bad Seed (1956) is based on a Broadway play about an impossibly sweet eight-y"
