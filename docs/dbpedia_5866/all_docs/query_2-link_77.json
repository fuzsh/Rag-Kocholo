That's an accurate description of the american scene (evidence/reference: Merchants of Cool)\n\neverything has exceptions, exceptions are in everything, thus they're completely meaningless for any type of basis/discussion/etc\n\nof course I've seen more american content, I'm an american, living in america my entire life, lol\n\nThe only japanese I get is via the internet, like for any foreign content, unless you got a lot of money (and even then, some content jsut ins't made available outside of a country, sadly).\n\nand yep, I don't know a thing of japanese language, except for a few words/phrases from manga/anime, which is again not knowing any japanese language at all\n\ntranslations... is by definition is problematic, as they're just not the same language at all, and thus its really not technically possible to truly translate at all. language is from centuries of culture and society and etc, and from learning/hearing it as a baby in the womb, being born into that language.\n\nbut we do the best we can... it's all we can do.... the only way to know a language is to be born into it, even those who seemingly have learned to be expert/fluent in a foreign language, still doesn't know all of its intricasies as someone born into it. You can't make up for learning/hearing it from a baby in the womb to a child's age of capable of being taught it non-naturally.\n\nsome translations (and dubs even) are very good, some are even better than the japanese/original, and some are worse/horrendous as well.\n\nthere's some really good translators out there, which can still do a horrible job at the content they're translating, as well as do a great job.\n\nthere's some really bad/poor translators out there too, which can get lucky and do a really great translation of content, as well as doing a really horrible job as well.\n\nmy point, is that translations have nothing to do with america vs japan discussion, it's irrelevant.\n\n@ kmnevil54:\n\nindeed, quantity is completely meaningless, when its about the absolute of truth/falsity. I never said anything about quantity in my posts, so I'm confused why you're bringing it up.\n\nthe point is that I have nothing to respond to from the others' posts, they've got no material, no substance, no references, no evidence, nothing, except just hollow and/or nonsensical one-to-a-few-line opinion/spam posts. They provided zero support for their baseless or nonsensical comments.\n\nI'm awaiting for something that I can respond to, sighs.\n\nI can and will easily provide numerous example proofs (I have a lot of references/empirical evidence as seen in my big list post to work with), soon as I get the chance, but I've got nothing to respond to, and am not going to waste my time, until I've got something to discuss and for them to try to debate me on, from them, sighs. I'm just waiting on them.

You got to watch the anime series though to understand it, as it's too hard to explain all of the things that make Heero so awesome and badass, lol.\n\n(also, his english dub is done by a really good-voiced actor, and girls find it really sexy, and guys, a very cool/good voice for him)\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMYd3S61EBE\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD2346AopZA\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcFg3xOsR_M\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gqPnZWA9PY\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtQkoecIzng (heero's laugh)\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOjEXZ5joao (Heero's villianous/evil laugh, I never realized it was such a good villian's laugh, it was jsut a good laugh until this clip pointed out how evil it sounds, lol)\n\nunfortunately, they took down the vid of Heero's epic speech... sighs, but you can read (but not as good as watching/hearing) it here:\n\nht.tp://gwepisode50.tumblr.com/post/121506858735/heeros-brutally-honest-speech\n\nht.tp://www.oocities.org/televisioncity/set/8812/gundam/speeches.htm (many/some of the epic quotes here)\n\n“Earth the planet in the solar system that miraculously gave birth to life. In the year After Colony 195, with the development of the colonies people now live in new surroundings. Thanks to plentiful natural resources and cultivated technological abilities. However, this new world is nothing but an imitation of humankind’s motherland the Earth. But why were the colonies made in the first place? I hear the main purpose was technological development to improve the lives of human kind on Earth. Did human kind start asking too much from this imitation world? The self-sustained way of life is more stable than life on Earth especially since it lacks the risk of natural disasters. It appeared that this unlimited growth was guaranteeing the eternal existence of human kind. Perhaps there was an age where people dreamed of the possibilities in the outer space; where they could start from scratch. However it’s unthinkable that the colonies or that humankind will ever forget the Earth. What did technological development in the colonies bring to the Earth? The kind of technology the Earth wants most: military power. Destruction is part of human nature that can never be gotten rid of; and now the colonies are developing a militaristic disposition. The colonies cannot forget the Earth. The Earth has great beauty. The animals known as humans have acquired such strength that they even think about controlling this planet for themselves. From the point of view of a planets life the life of a living thing lasts no more than an instant. But in the end, it is only themselves that humans can think of. Nothing changes. The time spent by humans in outer space has been a complete waste. The ideal is just a dream. This false pacifism. This false living space. Outer space is nothing but a breeding ground for even more battles in the future. Wars throughout history have claimed many lives. Although human kind has never been able to forget the sorrow that has been caused by the wars, they have not stopped fighting. The blood and tears they shed in battle are merely ceremonial. One can’t speak of history without referring to the wars in each era as important events. I’m sure the pale pep talks of fighting for peace have been repeated numerous times in the past. The colonies say they need armaments to maintain peace. It’s no different from on Earth. The colonies think they have joined the big boys. I guess they believe that the bloodshed would lead to higher morale [to further unite the colonies.] So why do people fight anyway? Perhaps the meaning of human existence lies within their will to fight. People feel a sense of accomplishment through battle. And it’s also a fact that the ones who are actually fighting are never perceived as being tainted.” - Heero Yuy\n\nand then the nazi teacher censors/ends it, as the stupid students can't handle advanced science topics, like the ultimate question of human's war/violent nature:\n\n“Okay, that’s enough, Duo Maxwell! [HK: Heero is using Duo's identity as his fake student identity] Let’s avoid that subject. It’s making your classmates uncomfortable. Personally, I don’t feel it was an appropriate subject for your greeting speech.”\n\nand another epic quote:\n\n~ \"The heartbeat of humanity: war -> peace -> revolution -> war -> peace -> revolution -> and on and on\") ~ \"War leads directly to peace\" (and peace leads directly to war, as both: 'revolution' is war, and 'war' is war)\n\nBut, this is an old show now... Sasuke (Naruto) has taken Heero's place, as Naruto is the current popular anime of today.\n\nBut, Sasuke is nothing compared to Heero Yuy, no one is, hehe.\n\ndon't worry, I was seeing it due to me, not due to you, lol. I was already going to see it, I didn't go see it because of you, lol.\n\nMost stuff I see, disappoints me, but I still go see it anyways, lol. I'm very hard to please, in terms of movies, lol. I have a narrow niche, which is rarely satisfied.\n\nfrom my list...\n\nI like ~300 movies, out of seeing ~1,000 movies:\n\n2/3 of the movies I see, I think are utter crap, or at best, watchable (so-so/decent/non-horrendous-but-not-good/average/\"run-of-the-mill\")\n\n1/3 of the movies I see, I find as good, lol.\n\nAnd... those ~1,000 movies I've seen, are ONLY the movies that I think I might enjoy... I can tell right away with most movies, in whether they're worth trying to see them or not (most movies get completely ignored by me --- especially all the comedy movies that everyone else loves --- I don't --- I hate them lol, as I know I'll not like them).\n\nI would be immediately fired as a movie critic:\n\nmovie 1: sucks\n\nmovie 2: sucks\n\nmovie 3: sucks\n\nmovie 4: sucks\n\nmovie 5: okay\n\nmovie 6: sucks\n\nmovie 7: sucks\n\nmovie 8: sucks\n\nmovie 9: sucks\n\nmovie 10: good\n\nmovie 11: sucks\n\netc etc etc\n\nlol....\n\nI would not follow all movie critics/reviewers of giving every movie 4-5/5 stars and always praise-worthy reviews/quotes, as is seen/done, lol. Movie/Game so-called \"critics/reviewers\" are bought and paid for by them, which is why all you see is high scores/reviews of every single movie/game, it's just paid for avertising, fraudulently tricking all the stupid poeple, that they're legit critics/reviewers, when they're so not.\n\nyou like never see \"this movie is more puke-worthy than my dog's dino-sized-pile of poop dumps\", nor critics/reviewers giving it: 0-2/5 stars, lol.\n\nI'm different from everyone else\n\neveryone else: loves guardians of the galaxy (1+2) and thor (1+2)\n\nHK: hates them... thor 1 had a few funny scenes (him getting run/knocked over, again and again, by the girl driving the car, lol)... but otherwise, the movie was completely unimpressive/crappy for me, sighs. There was nothing impressive/good about guardians of the galaxy for me. Uber boring/lame plot that I've seen billions of time, and it was really pathetically done too... I don't understand how people, don't see crap, as crap... Some millenial was so hyped up about seeing GoG1... and gushed about it after seeing it... and I'm like .... did we see the same shit? what in the world was good about Gog1 ??!!! It's like he just loved it, because that was the hype, that it'd be a good movie and everyone will love it, and thus he and everyone must love it... just because they are hyped up, that it is to be good and loved... okay... right...\n\nSeriously, Serenity's 'space crew/gang' is (and is done) so much better than GoG's laughable 'space crew/gang'.... sighs.\n\nThey have the exact same character roles... GoG just did such a lack-luster pitiful job of their characters, compared to every other same space-crew type of movie... sighs.\n\nGamora: 'dime a dozen' character role and not done well at all (not her fault as she is really good actress, movie writers/producers of having so simplistic/boring character design for her as Gamora, sighs)... pfft. My planet was taken over, and we're forced to serve them... and that's it... that's my stupid lame character.... laughs... pathetic\n\nDrax: 'dime a dozen' muscle character role, my parents were killed, revenge, and that's it... ya... that's some character design... pfft\n\nGroot: again, your basic muscle character... and tree-plant-characters/dryads/\"ents (Hobbit/LotR)\" aren't anything new... pfft\n\nrocket: I was some sick-fk's gene-spliced \"lab rat / human-racoon guinee pig\" experiment, and I'm obviously traumatized by it... boo hoo hoo.... that me, Rocket! ...wow... that was... anti-climatic... such pathetic empty character design... HK shakes his head.\n\nno character with any note-worthy personality nor development nor background/history, what-so-ever... sighs.... so bland and boring... what exactly was good about these utterly lame character designs?\n\nStar Lord: again, a \"dime-a-dozen\"... and again, nothing special about him at all... being a god entity's son ... oh wow... how creative... sighs... and then you get GoG2, where you get introduced to it... and it makes it even more pathetic, when you see just what this \"god entity\" is... pitiful... really crappy writers... sighs... There was some interest with Star Lord's mysterious origins/powers... (as I came into this totally blind --- never read comics, never even heard/knew of 'GoG', lol)... of how he could use the infinity gems/stones... (I did know valuely of these from x-men/capcom fighing games)... but their reveal of it in GoG2 was so... disappointing... really crappy writers... it was a joke... they killed and completely disappointed all the mystery of star lord, sighs. if you're going to reveal it, make it epic... but nope... it was total crap...\n\nStar Lord: an even more pathetic clone of jango fett (star wars, the dad who got his head cut off by the samual jackson jedi whatever his name, or in the older movies, fell into and eaten by the sand-lion pit on tatooie when luke was freeing leia and han solo from jaba the hutt, not his son: boba fett, who was very impressive, for a non-jedi character)\n\nanyways... I can rant at how stupid GoG was... forever... lol\n\nIf you like GoG... then watch Serenity... it'll be glorious for you! (well probably not, as I got different tastes... but it should be... lol)\n\nI only liked the first Underworld (it had a really good story/plot), and the second Underworld (Underworld: Evolution) was okay, but it had so much more potential (as the story/plot set in Underworld 1 was so good/unique, sighs).. huge disappointment, but it was okay to watch despite how much better it could (and SHOULD) have been, sighs.\n\nAll the other Underworlds sucked, except I did love the fight/combat scenes in the Underworld with Selene's daughter (Underworld 4: awakening), as we got to see godly Selene's abilities in it against the humans (lol) was awesome, and then her daughter ripping bodies apart, but the movie itself was total crap.\n\nThe Last (at least for now) Underworld (Underworld: Blood Ties) was okay with the action, but I really hated/didn't-like it (as it sucked: again no/crappy story/plot), as I didn't like Selene becoming this undead/ghost/shade character (so lame) and I thought it was stupid with how they tried to explain the screw-up of taking out (\"missing of\") her hybrid husband (michael) from all of the Underworld series... the hybridization was (half of) main (and cool) plot of the series: \"half vampire, half werewolf, but stronger than both\" and seeing him in his fight against victor, in underworld 1. The other half of the main plot is Selene, becoming godly from taking in their (vampire and lycan) founder, corvinius blood, which again was horrible done in underworld 2, sighs.\n\nIf you liked Baby Driver, if you've not seen it, then you need to see:\n\nDrive (2011) --- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMAJOR/MASSIVE SPOILER WARNING:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI love how it was done (really good camera and etc work, kinda like M. Shamalan's in a way/feel to it)... very little dialogue in the movie, but lots of action/body-language (\"action speaks louder than words\"), as the main character is really shy/quiet and bland guy... except... he's hiding a very dark side... it's cool to see its reveal... hehe... \"he might speak softly... but he carries a big stick --- don't get on his bad side\"\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAlso, while story/plot wise not a great movie at all, it has such a funny and well-done character:\n\nDrive Angry (2011, lol both care out in the same year, haha, never realized that): http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1502404/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\n\nbe warned that the show (rated R) is violent, along with sex/nudity (and the 'having sex while blowing guys heads off' scene, which was also done in the 'Shoot Em Up' movie too) too.\n\nthe 'devil's marshal/accountant/lawyer/bounty-hunter whatever for tracking down fugitive souls that escaped from hell', so well done and so funny/comedic scenes with him... I loved how well done this character was by them!\n\nplot: nickolas cage escapes from hell to get vengence on the guy(s) that killed his daughter (I think, or was it his girlfriend, meh, can't remember and too lazy to look up), and the devil sends his 'soul lawyer/accountant/marshal' to bring cage back, but while he's trying to get nicholoas cage back, he's not fond of all the bad people nicolas cage is after either, so he ends up helping cage a bit too, as he encounters the bad people (\"sinners who're going to be going to hell soon\") -- giving them the fast track to hell (kills them), and/or as they get in his way with bringing nicolas cage back to hell.\n\nlet me see if I can find some clips of it/him... here it is... this is just one of my favorite scenes... golden... so well done...\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXK_ZW_MM5U\n\nand some other scenes too:\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxYmi_coUSM (warning: violence)\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlL1j2XMb0\n\nht.tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT3kQdSXrMw\n\nthere's some more really good scenes... too, but some of them... got the sex/nudity parts... so no links of them... lol"
