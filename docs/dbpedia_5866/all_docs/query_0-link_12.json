        "text": "In 1945, immediately following the end of Second World War, a woman who lives with her two photosensitive children on her darkened old family estate in the Channel Islands becomes convinced that the home is haunted.\n\nA family curse confines orphaned twins Rachel and Edwards to their home, in punishment for their ancestors' sins. Bound to the rules of a haunting childhood lullaby, the twins must never let any outsiders inside the house.\n\nIn the late 1880's, a widowed mother of three struggles to keep her family intact and to put food on the table. The oldest daughter sends a letter to her estranged, very wealthy grandmother urging her assistance, much to her mother's disapproval. When the grandmother arrives, old wounds are opened but eventually healed. From a story by Louisa May Alcott. Stars Jacqueline Bisset, Ted Atherton, Tatiana Maslany, Helene Joy, Paula Boudreau, and Michael Barbuto.\n\nThérèse grows up with her aunt and cousin. Around 1860 the aunt decides they move to Paris and that her son and Thérèse get married. The joy- and loveless life changes when her husband brings a friend home. The affair turns ugly for all.\n\nIn 1921, England is overwhelmed by the loss and grief of World War I. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart visits a boarding school to explain sightings of a child ghost. Everything she believes unravels as the 'missing' begin to show themselves.\n\nAfter hastening the death of a tenant with whom he has been feuding, Squire Fairfield brings the dead man's young daughter to live in Wyvern Manor. Alice falls in love with one of the squire's two sons. She and Charles elope, incurring the wrath of his father, who had lecherous intentions towards Alice. The newlyweds avoid the squire by living in an outlying estate, where their baby is born. Charles is attacked by a mysterious woman who literally comes out of the woodwork, and their baby is hidden away in another home. Alice feels trapped, surrounded by secrets and mysteries and wondering who she can really trust.\n\nShirley is a 42-year-old bored Liverpudlian housewife who takes a holiday trip to Greece and meets a local man who bolsters her self-confidence. She evolves and transforms to the point that her husband doesn't even recognize her."
