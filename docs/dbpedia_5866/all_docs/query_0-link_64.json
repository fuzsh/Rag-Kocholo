I mean, if we agree that greatness in form relies on how a\n\ndirector frames and blocks humans (usually actors) in relation to the\n\nset , both statically and in motion (camera and actors) I think you have\n\nto take acting and the treatment of characters seriously as a very\n\nimportant component of what directors are doing to achieve greatness.\n\nBecause I don't think many of the films we'd agree on as great would be\n\nat all great if the actors and their acting styles were somehow made\n\nindistinguishable while keeping all the other formal elements intact--if\n\nyou have a form as human-centered as narrative cinema, what the humans\n\ndo within that formal construction seems quite important. I don't know\n\nif that makes sense--\"\n\nWell, I wouldn't limit it to \"how a director frames and blocks humans.\"\n\n\"Sansho Dayu\" and \"Red River\" and \"The Tall Men\" and too many others to\n\nmention are at least in part landscape films. And \"frames and blocks\"\n\nseems too limiting even when that tiny part of the cosmos that we call\n\n\"humans\" is what's involved: there's the quality of light, there are\n\nparticular qualities of the space -- the entrapments of Lang, the\n\npainterliness of Ford -- that are to me much more important. A film\n\ndirector is not a theater director.\n\nI'm not saying acting is irrelevant. I think if you could somehow manage\n\nto transpose the acting styles of a Hawks film to a Lang, or vice versa,\n\ndoing so would interject a discordant element that would seriously harm\n\nthe whole. I gather this is what you're saying, but I don't think I'd\n\nagree that such an artificial hybrid would not be \"at all great.\" I'm\n\nnot sure that all the acting in \"Red Line 7000\" is successfully\n\nHawksian, for example, though this is admittedly an extreme case.\n\nAt the same time, what I'm reacting against, and you probably agree with\n\nme here, is the movie-as-restaurant-meal metaphor that often surfaces,\n\nand was recently on another film discussion group: all the ingredients\n\nhave to be \"good\" for the movie to succeed completely. This notion, at\n\nleast when applied without subtlety, doesn't take into account the fact\n\nthat a great film is not simply the sum of its parts, it's a system of\n\nmeaning and beauty in which each part is only given meaning by the\n\nwhole, which is why what might be great acting in one film would be bad\n\nacting in another -- the elements cannot be evaluated separately, the\n\nway they can in an anonymously mediocre film, in which there is no\n\noverriding system, in which what one *does* notice and take pleasure\n\nfrom is a good performance or great cinematography or an engaging narrative.\n\nI don't agree with the common idea that the style of a good film can be\n\ntranslated into an articulation of the emotions of the narrative. To be\n\nsure, I write this way all the time, so I obviously think there's a\n\nrelationship there. But, as we see all the time in film, for many people\n\nthe ordinary human affections and responses, things one might also\n\nexperience in life itself -- fear, pleasure, desire, thrills -- are\n\nmostly what one gets out of movies. And that *is*, or at least can be,\n\nthe main thing one gets out of movies that are, well, not auteurist\n\nsuccesses. But I don't agree the idea (not that I think you were saying\n\nthis) that great art is somehow contiguous with one's own life\n\nexperiences, yet many critics write all the time as if this were the\n\ncase. In saying elsewhere that you see a great film as somehow above you\n\nor anything you can write about it, I'm guessing you don't mean that\n\nthis is because Brad Pitt or Cameron Diaz are so totally awesome that\n\nyou can't even imagine being in the same room with them -- which is\n\noften what many others *do* mean -- but because there's an aesthetic\n\nsystem at work that can't fully be translated and that takes you out of\n\nyourself. This is certainly the way I would say it for myself.\n\nThe best complaint I ever got about my own writing is that I makes it\n\nseem as if I've described the whole film, figured it out, accounted for\n\nthe all its possibilities. Hearing this, and thinking about it, made me\n\nrealize my limitations as a writer -- that tying up all the elements as\n\nif I were constructing a mathematical proof is fundamentally false to\n\nthe experience of art, which is ecstatic and chaotic as well as formal\n\nand controlled. And this needn't be a limitation of all film writing:\n\nthere's no illusion of completeness or of seeing a full explanation when\n\nreading Bresson's great book.\n\nThe reason my writing is so incomplete is that I haven't figured out how\n\nto account for the fundamentally inhuman heart at the core of any great\n\nfilm. And yes, it can't be truly \"inhuman\" since it was created by\n\nhumans -- I mean \"inhuman\" in the sense of being outside of daily\n\nexperience, and operating in a realm far removed from the simple\n\naffections. The accretion of stylistic devices that creates a vision in\n\na great film can't be reduced to theme or narrative, and is certainly\n\nnot homologous with quotidian encounters with others. Spending time with\n\nHawks's actors when watching a Hawks movie -- I'm intentionally choosing\n\na relatively \"humanist\" and actor-sensitive director here -- is almost\n\nnothing like spending time with other people in daily life, if you are\n\nable to see their performances as part of his whole system. There's an\n\nabundance of writing on Hawks that shows that many cannot do this. It's\n\nthe inhuman heart, the formal qualities that add up to style, that\n\npermits a film bring you to ecstasy, whether or not you like or dislike\n\nJohn Wayne.\n\n- Fred\n\n202\n\nFrom: Dan Sallitt\n\nDate: Wed Jun 25, 2003 4:01pm\n\nSubject: Re: Hawks\n\n> I guess I might say that,\n\n> regardless of whether he's developing and shaping and refining or\n\n> just sitting back in the world\n\n> he's created, Hawks can get a bit too precious for my stomach to\n\n> handle.\n\n>\n\n> It seems like Hawks is one of those filmmakers where one of the\n\n> primary pleasures of watching\n\n> his movies is to inhabit (as a viewer) the spaces he creates, to\n\n> experience the company of his\n\n> characters.\n\nI think there's at least one more dimension to this. True, hanging out\n\nwith Hawks people is a lot of what the films offer. And true, it can\n\nget precious. At a certain point most Hawks fans pull away a bit,\n\nrealizing that there's something odd and enclosed about the society in\n\nHawks' films.\n\nBut I think there are good reasons to immerse again after that initial\n\npulling back. Behavioral qualities are crucially important to Hawks,\n\nbut not just because they make the people likable. Trying to say it\n\nquickly: Hawks sets up an opposition between background and foreground.\n\nBackground in Hawks is made to signify \"genre\": it includes the\n\nlighting, the basic plotting, sometimes the minor characters - whatever\n\nhe needs to evoke a strong sense of a familiar set of movie conventions.\n\nAnd foreground in Hawks is the behavior of his key actors. And that\n\nbehavior is made to play out at a different level of realism than all\n\nthe genre signifiers in the background. Things happen faster than\n\nexpected, because Hawks is playing against a drama-based concept of\n\ntime. People talk over each other or under their breath or away from\n\nthe camera, in order to play against the way information is usually\n\ngiven to us in discrete packets for dramatic purposes.\n\nYou can extend this idea to the structure of the comedies. But, anyway,\n\nthe results of this shifting of levels of realism can be very striking\n\nand very energizing.\n\nSo I think there's more to it than just experiencing these people's\n\ncompany. They're part of a subtle formal play.\n\nDavid Thomson's essay on Hawks in A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FILM was\n\nthe first, I believe, to get at this idea.\n\n- Dan\n\n203\n\nFrom: Dan Sallitt\n\nDate: Wed Jun 25, 2003 4:59pm\n\nSubject: Re: Hawks, Ulmer\n\n> There were big changes starting with Rio Bravo.

The production and script files on Big Sky and Baby\n\nare fascinating reading; so does Gerald Mast's intro to the\n\npublished Baby screenplay, which is full of production tid-bits\n\nyou won't see elsewhere. Here's one I found: Before the\n\nmysteriosa Hagar Wilde came on board and stole stodgy\n\nDudley Nichols' heart (Pirandello time) Hawks and Nichols were\n\nplanning for Hepburn and Grant to reenact Laurel and hardy's\n\n\"auto-destruction\" routine in the parking lot (kind aout of\n\ncharacter, I'd say). L & H were still on someone's mind when the\n\nback of Hepburn's gown went deliciously missing in the\n\nnightclub.\n\nMore good stuff: Richard Schickel had some interesting\n\npersonal observations when I interviewed him for the Cahiers\n\nDVD on Baby; so did Peter Bogdanovich when interviewed him\n\non Male War Bride for that Locarno retrospective book. Check out\n\nthe Japanese guy Rosenbaum has been touting who has\n\nwrittten on both Hawks and Ozu, and don't miss the mad\n\nJungian visionary who did a whole book in a nearly unreadable\n\nstyle. Then there's the Cahiers tradition, both pre-Daney and\n\npost- (notably J-C Biette's \"Trois morts,\" on the deaths of Hawks,\n\nTourneur and Chaplin). And if you're looking for non-closure,\n\nManny Farber's seminal article on The Man can't be beat.\n\nFred, Ken Mogg (of MacGuffin fame) would identify that\n\nimpersonal element as Schopenhauer's \"Will.\" There is also no\n\nshortage of purely esthetic theories of impersonality - sounds\n\nlike Dan has a hot (or cold) one up his sleeve.\n\n206\n\nFrom:\n\nDate: Wed Jun 25, 2003 3:14pm\n\nSubject: Re: Hawks, Ulmer\n\nIn a message dated 6/25/03 2:42:43 AM, hotlove666@y... writes:\n\n>Repetition in late Hawks - intensified, foregrounded, but completely\n\n>continuous with the earlier films - exemplifies what auteurism is\n\n>about.

Though Farber wasn't an auteurist, I find his definition of\n\nthe best kind of movies - the termite ones, the ones made to please its maker\n\nfirst and foremost - to intersect thrillingly with this conception of\n\nauteurism.\n\nHawks pursued what gave him pleasure quite consciously (adding weight to\n\nTruffaut's belief that he was the most intellectual filmmaker in America) and\n\noften quite explicitly, the continuity between the Rio Trio being obvious to even\n\nthe most ardent non-auteurists. It's telling that his last major project was\n\nto be a re-make of his first: \"When It's Hot, Play It Cool\" was based, as we\n\nall know, on \"A Girl In Every Port.\" (I wish I could read that script!) These\n\ndays, I think of Woody Allen as being in a place similar to Hawks was late in\n\nhis career, single-mindedly working on variations on his hallmark themes and\n\nstyles. Naturally, one of the biggest criticisms of him has always been that\n\nhe repeats himself. The risk might be artistic stagnation, but I honestly\n\ndon't find this to be the case at all with either Hawks or Allen: \"El Dorado\" has\n\na whole host of concerns - such as the stuff about aging that Dan and Jaime\n\nhave been talking about - which differentiate it from \"Rio Bravo.\"\n\n>Besides Daney, and while waiting for that translation, I'd\n\n>recommend \"Mostly About Rio Lobo\" (I think that's the title) by Greg\n\n>Ford in Focus on Hawks, about that film and the Rio Trio as a whole.\n\nOddly enough, I was re-reading some of McCarthy's Hawks bio a few days ago\n\nand ran across a mention of this piece as one of the few defenses around of \"Rio\n\nLobo.\" I'll definitely try to check it out while waiting for the Daney\n\ntranslation to surface.\n\n>Pete: Pirates and Strange Illusion are well worth a look.

I'll use Kubrick as an example since I'm a\n\nfan: would he have made a film like \"Barry Lyndon\" without having been\n\nemboldened by the huge popular, critical, and cultural impact of the\n\n\"Strangelove\"-\"2001\"-\"Clockwork Orange\" trilogy? It's an unanswerable question, of course, but\n\nmy inclination is that he wouldn't have. BL raises the stakes, removes a lot\n\nof the easy points of audience access of the previous films (the satire of\n\nDS, the hippie appeal \"2001\" had, the magnetism of Alex in ACO) and assumes his\n\naudience will be up to the challenge - an assumption based on the success of\n\nthe previous films. Interestingly, I think the relative failure of BL prompted\n\nKubrick to retrench and pursue a more commercial looking property, but\n\nparadoxically \"The Shining\" ended up being as closed-off and termite-like of any of\n\nhis films. I think of TS as Kubrick using a huge bestseller to indulge in\n\nsome favorite visual things - and maybe he wasn't even aware of it at first, but\n\nby the time the film came out he'd become very cagey about the value of King's\n\nnovel. Though it's far from my favorite Kubrick, it's come to personify what\n\nhe \"is\" for me in its cataloging of Kubrickian things.\n\nHitchcock was coming off the peak of his public visibility and commercial\n\nappeal when he made radical films like \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie.\" There are a\n\nhundred other examples one could come up with.\n\nIt's something I can't particularly account for, but I fully admit that my\n\ntastes tend to run in line with the films following a director's big success.\n\nPeter\n\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/ptonguette/index.html\n\n208\n\nFrom: hotlove666\n\nDate: Wed Jun 25, 2003 8:47pm\n\nSubject: Success and freedom\n\nI fully admit that my\n\ntastes tend to run in line with the films following a director's big\n\nsuccess.\n\nI can think of a few counter-examples: Scorsese, Bogdanovich\n\n(who only became the best filmmaker of his generation after the\n\nbankruptcy), Coppola, Cimino, De Palma, Altman...\n\nBut back in the day it certainly was true.

I would say that \"Saint\n\nJack\" was a big turning point aesthetically - made on-the-fly in Singapore for\n\nvery little money, the film was at once his most humane and reality-based to that\n\ndate - and it was enough of a critical success to encourage him to continue\n\ndown that direction, I think. This resulted in what I view as his best film,\n\n\"They All Laughed,\" which fused his favorite genre tropes with a new warmth and\n\nrealism (if nothing else, the latter manifested itself in his choice to shoot\n\nin the real streets of NYC). Then came the bankruptcy and I think he's only\n\ngotten better as a director; I'm sure he could surpass \"They All Laughed\" if\n\nhe could direct one of his own scripts again. But \"Mask,\" \"Texasville,\" \"The\n\nCat's Meow\"... these are some of my favorite movies of the past two decades,\n\nwithout doubt.\n\nI also agree with you about Altman and De Palma. Less sure about Cimino,\n\nthough I'm interested in reassessing him. I love \"Heaven's Gate,\" but that seems\n\nlike a classic case of a big movie made by a director emboldened by a big\n\nsuccess.

I'll use Kubrick as an example since I'm a\n\nfan: would he have made a film like \"Barry Lyndon\" without having been\n\nemboldened by the huge popular, critical, and cultural impact of the\n\n\"Strangelove\"-\"2001\"-\"Clockwork Orange\" trilogy? It's an unanswerable question, of course, but\n\nmy inclination is that he wouldn't have. BL raises the stakes, removes a lot\n\nof the easy points of audience access of the previous films (the satire of\n\nDS, the hippie appeal \"2001\" had, the magnetism of Alex in ACO) and assumes his\n\naudience will be up to the challenge - an assumption based on the success of\n\nthe previous films. Interestingly, I think the relative failure of BL prompted\n\nKubrick to retrench and pursue a more commercial looking property, but\n\nparadoxically \"The Shining\" ended up being as closed-off and termite-like of any of\n\nhis films. I think of TS as Kubrick using a huge bestseller to indulge in\n\nsome favorite visual things - and maybe he wasn't even aware of it at first, but\n\nby the time the film came out he'd become very cagey about the value of King's\n\nnovel. Though it's far from my favorite Kubrick, it's come to personify what\n\nhe \"is\" for me in its cataloging of Kubrickian things.\n\nHitchcock was coming off the peak of his public visibility and commercial\n\nappeal when he made radical films like \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie.\" There are a\n\nhundred other examples one could come up with.\n\nIt's something I can't particularly account for, but I fully admit that my\n\ntastes tend to run in line with the films following a director's big success.\n\nPeter\n\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/ptonguette/index.html\n\n213\n\nFrom:\n\nDate: Wed Jun 25, 2003 6:37pm\n\nSubject: Re: Bogdanovich, Cimino, Dopple-post\n\nIn a message dated 6/25/03 6:03:04 PM, hotlove666@y... writes:\n\n>The SECOND bankruptcy came after They All Laughed, which\n\n>certainly is his best film, and was a direct result of buying back\n\n>TAL ($250,000) from Fox and attempting self-distribution.

In interviews, he tends to blame himself for its failure, which I\n\ncan understand given the fact that he was suffering an emotional breakdown\n\nduring this time. But it really heartens me to know that the film was on its way\n\nto becoming a success via PB's plan.\n\nI have an essay on TAL which I've been writing for about a year. It's\n\nunquestionably one of my very favorite films and I tend to add 1,000 words to my\n\npiece every time I re-see it.\n\nI'm also of the opinion that \"Texasville\" is superior to \"Picture Show,\" and\n\nthat \"The Thing Called Love\" and \"Noises Off\" are superb. In regards to\n\n\"Texasville,\" this film never ceases to move or surprise me. It's like an American\n\nvariant on Renoir. Bogdanovich has an amazing way of breaking up his\n\ngenerally long takes with cross-cutting between close-ups of his characters, usually\n\nregarding each other in silence. (Even in a farce like \"Noises Off,\" which\n\ndepends greatly on wide shots, he manages a few exchanges like this.) In\n\n\"Texasville,\" there are several memorable instances of cross-cutting: the looks\n\nbetween Shepherd and Potts towards the end, for example.\n\n>And let's not forget tv: His\n\n>pilot for the new Naked City, Killer Christmas, is minor but\n\n>interesting for its negligee attitude to the serial killer theme,\n\n>which he helped pioneer with Targets.\n\nFor some reason, Bogdanovich completist that I am, I've never seen this. I\n\ndo think a lot of his TV work is very underrated. There's the short he did for\n\nShowtime, \"Song of Songs,\" which is very sympathetic towards its middle-aged\n\ncharacters' romantic longings.\n\n>The new Peter is a farceur (one who had been hiding in the skin\n\n>of a tragedian during the 70s), and should be financed like the\n\n>national treasure he is to make two films a year in that vein from\n\n>his own screenplays.\n\nThe plot summaries I've read of \"Squirrels to the Nuts\" make it sound like a\n\nfarce on the level of \"Noises Off.\" I really hope he gets to make it. I\n\nremember reading, around the time of the release of \"The Cat's Meow,\" that there\n\nwere plans to shoot it in DV. That said, the unmade Bogdanovich project I long\n\nfor most is \"Wait For Me\" - 20 years in the writing, about a middle-aged\n\nmovie director bedeviled by ex-wives, up-and-coming movie people, and ghosts. I\n\nthink it could be phenomenal.\n\n>I like everything Michael Cimino has done, and some parts of\n\n>Heaven's Gate more than anything he has done, although it's an\n\n>uneven film in comparison with those that preceded it.

I'm floored by so many whole sections whenever I see it -\n\nJoseph Cotten's oration, the sweeping shot of the graduates dancing on the lawn to\n\nthe Blue Danube, Kristofferson and Huppert dancing in the hall, the\n\naccumulation of utter regret (personal regret, societal regret, historical regret) that\n\ncomes to the fore in the final scene, etc., etc. - that I completely forgive\n\nthe ones which don't work. It seems to me that post-HG Cimino could be a case\n\nstudy of a director trying to transform impersonal projects his own. I think\n\nthe reason he made \"The Sunchaser\" was so he could turn on the Aaron Copland\n\nin the last reel. I'd love to see his cut of \"Desperate Hours.\"\n\nPeter\n\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/ptonguette/index.html\n\n214\n\nFrom: jess_l_amortell\n\nDate: Thu Jun 26, 2003 1:02am\n\nSubject: Re: Losey\n\nI'm currently fuzzy on much of Losey, but speaking of THE PROWLER (\"Radio D=\n\nays\" for real, by the way), my recollection is that you could hardly see a f=\n\nilm like this without wanting to rush to any other examples of the director'=\n\ns early work that came your way. (A few of them have never come my way.) I=\n\nn other words, I'd think that seeing THE PROWLER would be enough to incline =\n\nany half-sentient viewer toward at least a provisional embrace of \"auteurism=\n\n.\"\n\nI suppose it goes without saying, but a lot of the principled resistance to=\n\nsame over on the mothership (sorry dear Web readers, but you really don't w=\n\nant to know) strikes me as merely perverse. For anyone with the merest inkl=\n\ning of \"what the director does,\" how can auteurism seem anything but a natur=\n\nal response? The whole \"filter\" argument -- \"what we've objected to isn't a=\n\nuteurism per se, but the adoption of a system through which one filters movi=\n\nes\" -- is just a diversion, since presumably no one would consider it \"filte=\n\nring\" to hunt down books by a writer they loved, for example. So it must st=\n\nill come down to the old disinclination to see the director as principal aut=\n\nhor -- or to give such authorship any importance. C'est la vie.\n\nI thought I'd mention that FINGER OF GUILT (THE INTIMATE STRANGER), from th=\n\ne blacklist period, is kind of interesting in that it's actually about an Am=\n\nerican film director (Basehart) obliged to work in England, though not for p=\n\nolitical reasons as I recall. \"Blackmail\" stands in for \"blacklist,\" I thin=\n\nk. It's probably a bit of a film a clef, although one that apparently the a=\n\nuthor was initially unable to sign.\n\n215\n\nFrom: jess_l_amortell\n\nDate: Thu Jun 26, 2003 1:07am\n\nSubject: Re: Losey\n\nSorry about the typographical ch=a=os.

I've only read a small fraction of the posts\n\nthere, but I have yet to see anyone object to one of those \"which\n\nactress would you rather fuck\" questions by saying, \"No, no, it's the\n\nDIRECTOR that matters.\" Maybe it's just something one learns from being\n\nin a minority group: don't question the majority. I mean, homosexuals\n\ngrow up hearing about how \"sick\" their desires are, but I'm not sure\n\nI've ever heard a gay man tell a heterosexual that there was anything\n\nwrong about straight sex.\n\nThe mothership majority seems really threatened by auteurists,\n\nespecially hard-line auteurists. I don't mind Mike's sarcasm to me,\n\nbecause it doesn't feel like an attack, and I don't think it is, but my\n\nposition(s) seem to bother him. And Victor is really over the top: to my\n\nlong careful explanation that auteurs have made some very bad films but\n\nI still find those films worth seeing and thinking about, he offers\n\nrepeatedly the translation that auteurists think their faves don't make\n\nbad films.\n\nI think one think that bothers more mainstream viewers about auteurists\n\nis their seriousness. Movies are not all fun, auteurists sayeth, but\n\nrather actually have ideas, styles, visions.\n\nI wanted to engage with this just to prevent people from having the\n\nwrong idea about us and our group, and it's interesting to see the same\n\nold battles of forty years ago refought again and again -- but, it's not\n\nTHAT interesting.\n\nTo cut the non-auteurists some slack, I think auteurism *can* seem, to\n\nan outsider, a bit like a religion. And for auteurists, it's just not\n\nall that interesting to hear the same things over and over. I'm an\n\natheist, but if I were Catholic, while I hope I'd do my part in trying\n\nto convert the heathen, I'm aslo very sure that I'd want to spend some\n\ntime in the company of my fellow Catholics, where I didn't have to hear\n\nthe same old cracks about flesh eating and who really shtupped Mary\n\nagain and again.\n\nI think what the non-auteurists don't get is that most auteurists\n\narrived at their position empircally. Bogdanovich said it early on\n\n(though I disagree with what he values): for him, auteurism was noticing\n\nthat the films he loved tended to be made by the same directors. I think\n\nJohn Alton is an amazing cinematographer, and I've enjoyed his work even\n\nin films by non-auteurs (aka \"bad diretors\" in my lingo), but ultimately\n\nI think \"Border Incident\" and \"The Big Combo\" have their greatest\n\nmeanings as Mann and Lewis films. And there was a period when I was\n\ndiscovering Alton when I really *wanted* him to be an auteur, his images\n\nwere so amazing.\n\n- Fred\n\n217\n\nFrom: Damien Bona\n\nDate: Thu Jun 26, 2003 1:54am\n\nSubject: Re: Uh, a screenwriter?\n\n--- In a_film_by@yahoogroups.com, \"Patrick Ciccone\""
