        "text": "We never know which films to cover since there are so many channels so please note that we welcome comments and requests for more in-depth coverage of new-to-streaming titles.\n\nOkay, time for this month's streaming roulette. You know the rules. We highlight new-to-streaming movies and an occasional TV series by freezing them on the scroll bar at entirely random places and just sharing what pops up. No cheating*!\n\nOkay, we're going to have a nice CALM talk like we discussed, right?\n\nLOVE, VICTOR (SEASON 3) on Hulu\n\nSad this show is ending but also relieved since so few high school shows wrap up at their natural ending point (senior year) before they've overstayed their welcome. Have you started watching the final season yet? Ana Ortiz (who is completely Emmy worthy for season 2) and James Martinez as Victor's parents are both so terrific and not at all the afterthoughts parents so often are in teen soaps...\n\nYou need to eat something. Eat it.\n\nTHE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) on HBOMax\n\nAhhh, remember how completely excellent baby Tom Holland was in The Impossible. Here he is bossing his mother (Naomi Watts) around in this tsunami drama/true story. For some reason when I think of this movie I always recall that Reese Witherspoon was obsessed and campaigning for the Watts's Best Actress nomination.\n\n-Dr. Kibner will be here soon.\n\n-Kibner Kibner Kibner Kibner. I'm going to lie down and think, honey. I'm just gonna think.\n\nINVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1978) on Shudder\n\nI've never seen this well received remake of the 50s classic, have you? And look it's young Jeff Goldblum and . the perpetually undervalued Veronica Cartwright (as great in genre films as many 'prestige' actors are in dramas) as husband and wife. They're talking about Leonard Nimoy's character in this scene. Something tells me Jeff Goldblum is not going to survive his little nap when he's feeling strange.\n\nOlga: Why go through all this trouble? Be the weak little person you were meant to be.\n\nJoey: Let's find out.\n\nTHE PRINCESS (2022) on Hulu\n\nCannot believe this is the image I landed on considering how I felt when I first heard about this project. The focus is about to shift to Joey King, the titular character, as she fights the villainess Olga Kurylenko, but there in the background is the charismatic action-ready Vietnamese star Veronica Ngo who could surely take both Joey & Olga out in seconds and be ready for more opponents. We've sung her praises before here on the site from her movie star charisma in Vietnam's Oscar submission Furie to a Film Bitch Award medal for her work in Da 5 Bloods as Hanoi Hannah. Why isn't she the star of this fantasy? Argh.\n\n- Tina, I love you!\n\n- No. No. It's over.\n\nBROADWAY DANNY ROSE (1984) on Amazon Prime & Paramount Plus\n\nThis was the first Woody Allen film I ever saw and afterwards I was completely smitten with Woody & Mia as a team (sigh). Mia Farrow is so hilarious in this movie and though her overall filmography doesn't immediately suggest a lot of range in terms of the type of characters she could play Broadway Danny Rose and, five years later, Alice (1990) prove otherwise! [Nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, and Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes]\n\nMother, are you hiding something from me?\n\nLATE AUTUMN (1960) on Criterion Collection\n\nCriterion has a Setsuko Hara program this month with 11 films including many of her cinephile-beloved Yasujiro Ozu classics. Tokyo Story (1953) might be the most famous but since Ozu was primarily working before the Oscars recognized foreign films, the only one of his films ever submitted to the Oscars was Late Autumn.\n\n[Singing in Voiceover] I will always remember the chair, that window, the way the light streams in, the clothes I'm wearing, the words I'm hearing, the face i'm seeing, the feeling I'm feeling... â™«\n\nYENTL (1983) on Amazon Prime\n\nWe just discussed this Barbra Streisand gem (the best of her very unprolific directorial career) on \"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\" when it was on Criterion Channel and now it's on Amazon Prime. If you haven't yet watched what are you waiting for? [Nominated for 5 Oscars, winning for Original Song Score, and nominated for 6 Golden Globes, winning Best Musical and Best Director]\n\nI stumble naked through the ruins back towards blander less complicated confections, leaving in my wake a trail of rainbow carnage.\n\nHEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (2001) on Criterion Channel\n\nI had forgotten about the Gummy Bears! Perfection. This play/concert/soundtrack/movie is perfection. It's crayz how little John Cameron Mitchell is discussed since all of his movies are treats... though they're definitely not of the blander less complicated variety.\n\nSo what (else) is streaming in July?\n\nâ˜… indicates movies or series of note though sometimes hidden gems have no buzz until you see them.\n\nðŸ”¸ Indicates that the movie was Oscar-nominated in some category or another\n\nalso new on Netflix in July\n\nLater this Month (a sampling)\n\nThe Sea Beast (2022) - new animated adventure July 8th\n\nHow to Change Your Mind (2022) - new Alex Gibney doc series on mind altering drugs July 12th\n\nPersuasion (2022) - new Austen adaptation starring Dakota Johnson July 15th\n\nUmma (2022) - Sandra Oh horror film July 16th\n\nThe Gray Man (2022) - new action film July 27th\n\nâ˜…ðŸ”¸ COLLECTIONS now streaming on Criterion Channel\n\nBOXING ONSCREEN - 16 films including Raging Bull, Fat City, The Champ\n\nDIRECTED BY HENRY KING - 8 films including In Old Chicago, State Fair\n\nNOIR IN COLOR - 15 films including Leave Her to Heaven, Niagara, Rivers Edge\n\nSTARRING SETSUKO HARA - 11 films including Late Spring, Tokyo Story\n\nDIRECTED BY BLAKE EDWARDS - 6 films including Victor/Victoria, That's Life!\n\nTHE BEFORE TRILOGY - Richard Linklater's classic romantic dramas with Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke\n\nINDIVIDUAL FILMS\n\nAir Doll (2009) Hirokazu Kore-eda film starring Doona Bae\n\nâ˜… Destry Rides Again (1939) Western with Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich\n\nâ˜… Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001) John Cameron Mitchell's musical classic\n\nâ˜… Pink Flamingos (1972) John Waters classic -Retrospective Tribute\n\nðŸ”¸Shaft (1971) Gordon Parks hit with Oscar winning theme song\n\nWalker (1987) unconventional biopic about the President of Nicaragua\n\nLater this Month - a Sampling\n\nLemon (2017) Janicza Bravo's debut before Zola - July 6th\n\nAhed's Knee (2021) from Nadav Lapid - July 14th\n\nMississippi Masala (1991) Mira Nair's romantic drama with Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury\n\nâ˜… Adoption (1975) Hungarian classic -July 27th\n\nalso streaming now\n\nðŸ”¸ â˜…127 Hours (2010)\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999)\n\nBecause I Said So (2007)\n\nBig Trouble in Little China (1986)\n\nBillboard Dad (1999)\n\nBlack Knight (2001)\n\nBogus (1996)\n\nðŸ”¸ Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)\n\nBride Wars (2009)\n\nCadillac Records (2008)\n\nClosed Circuit (2013)\n\nContraband (2012)\n\nDeath Race (2008)\n\nðŸ”¸ The Descendants (2011)\n\nThe Expendables (2010-2014) first 3 movies\n\nFirst Knight (1995)\n\nGhost Rider (2007)\n\nGodsend (2004)\n\nâ˜… Good Luck to You Leo Grande (2022) - REVIEW\n\nThe Gospel According to AndrÃ© (2017)\n\nHeist (2001)\n\nHysteria (2012)\n\nðŸ”¸Independence Day (1996)\n\nInsidious (2011)\n\nJohn Dies at the End (2012)\n\nâ˜…Joy Ride (2001)\n\nJumanji (1995)\n\nKnock Knock (2015)\n\nâ˜…Kung Fu Hustle (2005)\n\nThe Last Circus (2010)\n\nThe Last Days on Mars (2013)\n\nLegend of the Guardians: The Owls Of Gaâ€™hoole (2010)\n\nThe Librarian...

We're never sure exactly why this is except for that perhaps studios lazily bundle various movies from their catalogues for streaming rights and everyone buys the same bundles. Or perhaps it's due to so many streaming services being part of conglomerates. It's a pity there's not more variety and no curation outside of the Criterion Channel.\n\n* People never believe this but it's (mostly) true. The only exceptions are when the image is too fast to look good in still frame (we usually use a gif in those cases) or if it's too transitional (dissolves, fadeouts, etcetera) or an establishing shot of a building or something... the other secret to why the images are often good is that we just dont use that particular film if we land on something that's too dull."
