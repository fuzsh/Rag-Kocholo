The record also includes the date of proclamation of the election at the Election Diet. From 6 Jan 1573, during vacancies in the elective kingship the primate of Poland ex officio (occasionally another prelate, in emergency situations) headed the state with the style Interrex. In the United Commonwealth of Two Nations, the Polish king also had the style of Grand Prince of Lithuania, and the two countries were governed together and were represented on the Diets. Although de jure the Polish Interrex only dealt with Poland during a vacancy in the kingship (the Lithuanian Council of State dealing with Lithuania), this is de facto a spurious distinction. The full style of Polish kings from 1573 was Dei Gratiae Rex Poloniae, Magnus Dux Lituaniae, Russiae, Prussiae, Masoviae, Samogithiae, Kiioviae, Volhyniae, Podoliae, Podlachiae, Livoniae, Smolensciae, Severiae, Czernichoviaeque (official Latin style) or Z Bozej laski Król Polski, Wielki Ksiaze Litewski, Ruski, Pruski, Mazowiecki, Zmudzki, Kijowski, Wolynski, Podolski, Podlaski, Inflancki, Smolenski, Siewierski i Czernihowski (Polish) (\"By the Grace of God, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Russia, Prussia, Mazovia, Samogitia, Kiev, Volhynia, Podolia, Podlachia, Livonia, Smolensk, Severia and Chernigov\").\n\n²The Polish government in exile lost the diplomatic recognition of the Western Allies on 5 Jul 1945.\n\nMinistries, etc. Voivodships 1919-39 Voivodships from 1999\n\nCracow\n\n1815 - 3 Mar 1846 \"Free, Independent, and Strictly Neutral City of Cracow With Its Territory\" (often styled Cracow Republic) 3 Mar 1846 - 15 Oct 1918 subject to Austria; from 16 Nov 1846 styled Grand Duchy of Cracow, under the emperor of Austria; from the Ausgleich of 21 Dec 1867 that established the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, a territory in the Austrian half of the Monarchy Chairmen of the Governing Senate of the Cracow Republic 2 Nov 1815 - 18 Jan 1831 Stanislaw hrabia Wodzicki (b. 1759 - d. 1843) 18 Jan 1831 - 24 Mar 1833 no permanent chairman 24 Mar 1833 - 26 Feb 1836 Kacper Wieloglowski 26 Feb 1836 - 27 Apr 1839 Józef Haller de Hallenburg (b. 1783 - d. 1850) 27 Apr 1839 - 27 Oct 1839 Antoni Bystrzonowski (1st time) (b. 1769 - d. 1848) (acting) 27 Oct 1839 - 27 Dec 1839 Jan Chrzciciel Schindler (1st time) (acting) (b. 1802 - d. 1890) 27 Dec 1839 - 27 Feb 1840 Antoni Bystrzonowski (2nd time) (s.a.)
