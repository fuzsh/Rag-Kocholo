        "text": "It is very motivating when you see a team, colleagues and likeminded associates, using knowledge and experience for the better quality of life of everyone. Time flies, looking back is fulfilling, looking forward is exciting! ☆ Thanks for a great job, Vitor Rebelo! __________________ 》CESL ASIA PRESENTS SOLUTIONS FOR THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 《 CESL Asia, a company dedicated to energy and infrastructure management, also on greater food sustainability, presents tomorrow, on the first day of the Macau International Environmental Cooperation Forum and Exhibition, a solution that says it is innovative in terms of facilities management through the deployment of artificial intelligence tools. The president of the company told the TRIBUNA DE MACAU newspaper that he is working with experts from several countries and to follow up on the partnerships he has established in previous years. António Trindade stresses that the fundamental thing is \"to know how to make the most by deploying solutions that use these new technologies and the complexity of information that we have collected and at our disposal to produce as efficiently as possible.\" The presence in the environmental event, he says, \"allows you to use knowledge and experience to improve the quality of life, sharing this with customers.\" REBELO, VITOR https://lnkd.in/gBd3v6KQ\n\nTakeaways from the eIDAS Summit 2024 , a full day of intense discussions and interesting presentations on eIDAS & eIDAS2 and digitalisation as a whole in Germany, DACH and beyond. In a nutshell: a perfectly organised event with high class speakers, great content and superb opportunity to discuss and network with peers. Highlights: The first panel offered a candit discussion on the legislation required to prepare the future of eIDAS which got hijacked by a discussion on the future of the OZG revision (Online Zugangs Gesetz). Whilst all participants (government representative and opposition) showed willingness to solve the actual situation, it became clear to the audience that there is still a lot of work to be done, especially to cover the wider scope of eIDAS2 which got under-represented in the discussion. Followed a panel on success factors of adoption for the EU wallet. Without surprise, user experience and trust made the race. The relevance of ease of use was discussed based on scientific evidence, the trustful image of the issuer of the wallet and the importance of the role of the Qualified Trusted Service Provider were highlighted as contributors to the trust. eIDAS2 should even strengthen the importance of QTSPs in the future to manage attributes of all kind; Attributes which might become a much wider topic and much more important than the eID itself. The next panel put the light on how eIDAS services can find their ways into use cases. They are numerous and go way beyond the scope of the actual large scale pilot projects for the EU Wallet. The importance to include DLT and Blockchain technologies in the equation was highlighted referring to parallel European and global initiatives (e.g. payments, tracking of goods, ..) This lead into the next Panel with a discussion of the benefits of open source technologies where again it was emphasised that there is more than eIDAS2 to be looked at when it comes down to digitisation. The afternoon was characterised by reality checks on how eIDAS can help develop digitalisation in countries. Special mentioning: - eID development in Denmark and what we can learn from it - what can already be done with eIDAS1 services within Europe (e.g. HR contracting) - QES in Telemedicine - Learning from eID development in Austria - Panel discussion with representatives of Switzerland, Austria and Germany with interesting discussion on how to make the difference between private usage and commercial usage of QES in the Wallet. On the Online forum participants could also follow discussions on the experiences of the large scale pilots for the EU wallet and a presentation of a new competition project for the best EUID Wallet ideas initiated by the German Ministry of internal affairs: fcandidatures can be submitted until May 5th (next online Info session: April 18th). Many thanks again to the Bitkom Team for a perfect event. #eIDAS24 #reusableidentities #eIDAS #digitalsignature #digitaltrust BeYs\n\nIn the hearts of many Portuguese citizens, the date of April 25th holds profound significance. It marks the day when the Carnation Revolution, a peaceful coup d'état, brought an end to decades of authoritarian rule in Portugal in 1974. As the country transitioned to democracy, it embarked on a journey of transformation that extended far beyond politics and into the realm of technology. In the decades following the revolution, Portugal witnessed a remarkable transformation in its tech landscape The spirit of the April 25th Revolution is deeply ingrained in Portugal's tech community, driving a culture of openness, collaboration, and resilience. Startups and tech companies across the country embody the revolutionary ethos, challenging conventions, disrupting industries, and pushing boundaries. Just as the Carnation Revolution symbolized a break from the past, Portugal has emerged as a trailblazer in renewable energy, harnessing its natural resources to power the future. The revolution in digital connectivity has democratized access to information and empowered citizens to engage with democracy in new ways. From e-government services to digital platforms for civic engagement, technology has played a crucial role in strengthening Portugal's democratic institutions and fostering transparency and accountability. As Portugal continues its journey of technological advancement, it must remain true to the values that underpinned the April 25th Revolution – inclusivity, social justice, and human dignity. While progress in technology is essential for economic growth and prosperity, it must also serve the greater good, bridging divides and improving the quality of life for all Portuguese citizens. The evolution of Portugal's tech industry is a testament to the enduring legacy of the April 25th Revolution. Just as the Carnation Revolution transformed Portugal's political landscape, the country's tech revolution is reshaping its economic and social fabric, embodying the spirit of innovation, freedom, and progress. As we commemorate the anniversary of this historic event, let us celebrate Portugal's journey from carnations to code and embrace the limitless possibilities that lie ahead. #wearewestshore #25abril #standforfreedom"
