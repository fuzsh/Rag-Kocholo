        "text": "dos Santos, José\n\n▪ Angolan leader\n\nin full José Eduardo dos Santos\n\nborn August 28, 1942, Luanda, Angola\n\npolitician who became president of Angola in 1979.\n\nIn 1961 dos Santos, a militant nationalist, joined the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola ( Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola; MPLA), which supported independence from Portugal. He was chosen by the movement to study in Moscow, where he trained as an engineer, specializing in the problems of the oil industry, an important sector of Angola's economy.\n\nAfter returning to Angola in 1970, dos Santos served as an active fighter with the MPLA's Second Military Front in Cabinda, the oil province of Angola. A frequent representative of the MPLA at international forums, he was elected to the executive committee of the movement's political bureau. After the country achieved independence in 1975, several groups vied for control of Angola, including the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA); UNITA), which was led by Jonas Savimbi (Savimbi, Jonas). The MPLA eventually declared itself the government, establishing a single-party system, though UNITA continued to stage guerrilla attacks. In 1975 dos Santos became Angola's first prime minister, and three years later, when that post was eliminated, he was named planning minister.\n\nFollowing the death of President Agostinho Neto (Neto, Agostinho) in 1979, dos Santos came to power. Pragmatic and flexible, he attempted to improve relations with the West, especially the United States, which did not recognize the MPLA-led government. In the early 1990s he abandoned Marxist-Leninism and ordered the withdrawal of Cuban troops that had been in the country since the late 1970s. The changes did little to appease UNITA, which intensified its attacks. In 1991 dos Santos signed a peace agreement with UNITA and agreed to multiparty elections. After he defeated Savimbi at the polls in 1992, however, UNITA resumed the fighting, which did not end until Savimbi's death in 2002. As elections originally slated for 1997 had been postponed indefinitely because of the conflict and its aftermath, dos Santos remained president into the 2000s.\n\nIn 2007 dos Santos announced that parliamentary elections would be held in September 2008, while the presidential election would be held in 2009. The MPLA was victorious in the parliamentary elections; although there were reports of fraud and intimidation, the elections were deemed valid by international observers.\n\n* * *\n\nUniversalium. 2010.\n\nDos Pilas\n\nDōshō"
