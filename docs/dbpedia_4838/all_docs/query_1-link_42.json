        "text": "History of United Sports Panel 1959-2009\n\nGolden Jubilee Presentation Booklet, January 31, 2009\n\nWhen the original members of the United Sports Panel first met they had, in fact, no name. They met in the Slievenamon Hotel, Parnell Street on Saturday, December 12, 1959. When they met a week later to pick their Stars it was unanimously decided on the proposition of Sean Barlow, seconded by Eddie O'Neill, to adopt the name United Sports Panel.'\n\nAt their second meeting the panel elected the Sports Stars for 1959 by secret ballot. In the early years the trophies were presented by various business premises in the county but with the introduction of the much-appreciated sponsorship of Messrs Showerings (Ireland) Limited came the introduction of the Cidona Awards. The Panel was the first of its kind to be formed outside Dublin.\n\nThe members of the first panel were Sean Cleary (chairman), Sean Lyons (organising secretary), Sean Barlow, Bill Hyland, Christy Mulcahy, Eddie O'Neill, Bill O'Brien, Paddy Cummins, Ken Hogan, Tom Halpin and Ted Dillon.\n\nThe presentation of the awards was made at the Tipperary County Basketball Board's ceili in St. Patrick's Hall, Clonmel on Sunday, January 17, 1960. The recipients were presented in apparent random order. The sports honoured were Camogie, Soccer, Table Tennis, Sports Executive, Athletics, Cycling, Hurling, Boxing, Basketball and Gaelic Football. A photograph of the receipients appeared on the front page of the following week's Nationalist.\n\nThe awards were presented by the Mayor of Clonmel, Councillor Maurice Slator, and all ten recipients were in attendance. Each was cheered to the echo as he/she received the award. One of the biggest receptions of the night was reserved for John Doyle, the hurling award winner. Each winner was presented with a cup.\n\nSean Lyons introduced the various stars, thanked them for coming, and also thanked all those who had donated trophies.\n\nHandball and Pitch & Putt were honoured in 1960 in place of Sports Executive and Boxing. In the report in The Nationalist on the 1961 Sports Stars we are told that the Stars were chosen by ballot at a meeting in the Slievenamon Hotel, Clonmel. Seven awards, all of the same design, were to be presented early in the New Year.\n\nThe report goes on to state: 'Stars considered by the panel were those who participated in Tipperary amateur sports during the year, or who represented the county in any of the sports mentioned.'\n\nThe report continued: 'The panel was first formed in 1959 when ten awards were made. Last year the panel again decided to choose ten sports, but when the members met this year it was agreed that the number should be reduced by three. Knocked off the list were basketball, soccer and tennis.'\n\nThe 1962 Awards were presented at a special dance in the Collins Hall, Clonmel on January 20, 1963.One important addition to the awards was the Knocknagow Award, which was presented to honour an outstanding Tipperary sportsperson from the past. The first recipient was athlete, J. J. Ryan of Cordangan, Tipperary. Also making its first appearance in the awards in that year was weight-lifting.\n\nThe United Sports Panel picked eight stars plus the Knocknagow Award in 1963. The awards were presented in the Collins Ballroom, Clonmel on Sunday, January 26, 1964 and the presentations were made at 10 pm by the Mayor of Clonmel, Cllr. M. Kilkelly, P.C.\n\nThe four-page program listed the Honorary Members of the U.S.P. They included the Mayor, Christy Mulcahy, Tom Fitzgerald, Jack Pyke, Jim Power, Colm Ryan, Andy Hogan, Snr., Andy Hogan, Jnr., Garry Lonergan, Gerry Coffey, Michael Hogan (Dublin), Mrs. K. O'Flaheryy (Cahir), Paddy O'Loughlin, William Byrne, Michael O'Brien, Ned Gahan, Martin Cronin, Ald. Wm Corbett, Patrick O'Neill (Ardfinnan), John O'Neill, Tom Wall (Carrick-on-Suir), Ald, Sean Treacy, T.D., William Caulfield, Bill Devereux, Senator Wm Ryan (Kilfeacle), Elmville Camogie Club, Con O'Donovan, M.C.C. (Ballyporeen), Ald, John Kennedy, M.C.C., Matt Kennedy, D.P. Honan, M.C.C. (Ennis).\n\nThere was a major development when the Clonmel United Sports Panel announced the 1964 Awards. They announced that the Irish Cider and Perry Company was sponsoring the awards and that the trophies would henceforth be known as the Cidona Trophies. Also for the first time there would be a dinner-dance in connection with the presentations and it was scheduled to be held in the Ormonde Hotel on Sunday, January 31, 1965.\n\nA large advertisement appeared in The Nationalist underneath the report of the announcement of the awards and the sponsorship. It stated: 'The Irish Cider & Perry Company Ltd. Salute The Tipperary Sports Stars of 1964 and are pleased to sponsor the Cidona Trophies. Happy Christmas to all Sportsmen and Sportswomen.'\n\nThe panel in charge of the presentation was as follows: Tom Halpin, chairman, Sean Barlow, vice-chairman, Sean Lyons, secretary, John Boyle, M.C.C., Bill O'Brien, Bill Hyland, Tom Carroll, Paddy Cummins, Eddie O'Neill, Michael O'Meara, Ted Dillon.\n\nThere was a preview of the 1965 awards in the 'Nationalist', the week before the announcement of the awards was made. Columnist Atlas stated that the awards would be presented in the Ormonde Hotel, Clonmel on Sunday, January 23 and attendance would be limited to 200 patrons. It was hoped that the proceedings would be televised for subsequent showing. The Sports panel were pleased to announce that the Irish Cider and Perry Company Ltd. Of Annerville. Clonmel had again agreed to sponsor the awards presentation.\n\nAtlas went on to describe how the sports stars were chosen. According to him any sport can be proposed for a ballot of the members so long 'as it's purely amateur in make-up and outlook. The sports that received 50 percent plus 1 of the panel's voting strength were automatically selected for producing a sports star. In the ballot for the Stars each panel member makes his choice and it has to receive 50 percent plus 1 of the votes to be selected. In the event of a tie or of no candidate reaching the 'quota', further ballots take place.\n\nIn answer to the question of influence or pull being used, Atlas stated: 'I have served on the panel since its foundation in 1959 and I can truthfully state that as far as human endeavour will allow, every selection of sports stars is fair, clearcut and above reproach. Maybe that's the secret of the panel's success and its extraordinary growth from year to year.'\n\nThe 1966 Awards, which were now called the Cidona Awards, were presented in the Ormonde Hotel, Clonmel on January 29, 1967.\n\nThree new sports, Ladies Athletics, Golf and Rugby, were honoured for the first time in the 1967 Awards. They were presented at a function in the Ormonde Hotel, Clonmel on Saturday, January 20, 1968. Up to that year the Awards were presented on a Sunday night.\n\nThe 1968 Awards were presented at the Ormonde Hotel on the last Saturday in January, 1969. In a newspaper report on the selection of the Stars it was stated: 'Thanks to the untiring work by the panel members, the continuing support of the growing numbers of honorary members and, most important of all, to the commercial sponsorship extended to the panel by Messrs Showerings Ltd (Clonmel) without whose assistance USP could never survive in these costly times.'\n\nThe 1969 Awards were presented at Hearn's Hotel, Clonmel for the first time on January 16, 1970. The members of the panel were as follows: chairman, Sean Barlow, vice-chairman, Bill O'Brien, secretary, Tom Carroll, treasurer, Ald. Sean Lyons, John Boyle, Ted Dillon, Paddy Cummins, Bill Hyland, Ken Hogan, Michael O'Meara, Christy Mulcahy.\n\nThere was a new departure in the 1970 Awards when the Knocknagow Award was given to the eight survivors of the Tipperary team, which won the 1920 All-Ireland senior football title (played in 1922).\n\nThe 1971 Awards were presented at Hearn's Hotel on January 29, 1972. They were picked by the United Sports Panel at a meeting in Hearn's Hotel on December 18, 1971 and and history was made when one recipient, Michael Keating, received two awards, in hurling and football. Badminton was honoured for the first time.\n\nThe 1972 Awards were presented in the Clonmel Arms Hotel for the first time on Saturday, January 26, 1973. The event commenced at 7-30 pm and the music was by the Remo Quartet. Tickets were £2 each. Clay Bird Shooting was honoured for the first time.\n\nThere was an increase in the number of awards to thirteen announced in 1974 and they were presented at a function in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on the last Saturday in January 1975. Volleyball made its appearance for the first time and the Knocknagow Award winner was the well-known journalist and broadcaster, Tommy O'Brien, who was one of the finest billiard players in the county during the fifties. Brothers Jimmy and Paddy Doyle received awards in different sports.\n\nThe 1975 Awards were presented at a function in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on the last Saturday in January 1976. Rowing was awarded for the first time.\n\nThe 1976 Awards were presented at a dinner oin the Clonmel Arms Hotel on Saturday, January 29, 1977. Equestrian, Sculling and Tennis were awarded for the first time.\n\nThe 1978 Awards were presented at the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 27, 1979. Darts were honoured for the first time.\n\nThe 1979 Awards were presented at the Clonmel Arms Hotel at the end of January 1980. History was made when the Knocknagow Award was won by a lady, former international hockey player, Jenny O'Donnell, for the first time.\n\nThe souvenir program produced for the 1980 awards includes a greatly expanded list of Honorary Members, one hundred and seventy-six in all. Virtually every public representative and local councillor is included. Also included is a list of the officers to date. The chairmen included Sean Cleary (1960), Tom Halpin (1961-65), Sean Barlow (1966-68), Bill O'Brien (1969-71), Ken Hogan (1972-1974), Bill Hyland (1974), John Boyle (1975-78), Seamus O'Doherty (1979-81). The secretaries during the period were Sean Lyons (1960-65), Eddie O'Neill (1966-68), Tom Carroll (1969-72), Seamus O'Doherty (1973-74), Ken Hogan (1975-81). Sean Lyons took over as treasurer in 1966 and was still in the position in 1981.\n\nThe names of all the Stars and Knocknagow Award winners over the twenty-one years are included.\n\nThe officers are as follows: chairman, Seamus O'Doherty; vice-chairman, Ted Dillon; secretary, Ken Hogan; treasurer, Sean Lyons. The committee included John Boyle, Sean Barlow, Bill O'Brien, Johnny Ryan, Liam Delahunty, Johnny O'Loughlin, Jimmy Cooney. As many as fifteen Awards were made, with Shooting included for the first time.\n\nThe 1981 Awards included Powerlifting for the first time.\n\nThe 1982 Awards were presented at the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 29, 1983. Olympic gold medalists Dr. Pat O'Callaghan and Bob Tisdall, were selected for the Knocknagow Award.\n\nThe 1984 Awards were the Silver Jubilee Awards of the United Sports Panel and they were presented at the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 26, 1985. In a press release in connection with the Awards, the panel outlined its distinguished history over twenty-five years and concluded by saying: 'In these times when a cynical approach to all games is growing and the less acceptable face of some facets of the game are hitting the headlines, the ideals for which the Panel was formed twenty-five years ago, to further sport for its own sake, is still laudable and worthy of support.'\n\nThe distinction between men's and ladies' athletics was abolished and athletics became one award, open to men and women.\n\nThe 1985 Awards were presented at the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 25, 1986. Rallying was honoured for the first time. Motor Sport made its first appearance in 1986\n\nThe United Sports Panel of 1987 was as follows: chairman, Liam Delahunty, vice-chairman, Johnny O'Loughlin, secretary, Seamus O'Doherty, treasurer, Sean Lyons; committee included Jimmy Cooney, Davy Hallinan, Peter Tobin, Sean Barlow, Ted Dillon, Michael Guinan, Johnny Ryan.\n\nIn the course of his remarks at the AGM the chairman said he would like to see a get-together of the Panel before Christmas. This would suggest that there wasn't a get-together the previous year. At the next meeting the treasurer reported there would be a get-together for the Panel at Cahir House on Sunday, January 3. Johnny O'Loughlin recalls a Chairman's Dinner from the time he joined, but believes it didn't take place one or two years because of financial constraints.\n\nTwo new sports, Judo and Raquetball, were honoured for the first time in 1989, and Canine Sports and Deep Sea Angling made their appearance in 1990.\n\nA new spotlight was introduced for the presentation of the 1992 Awards in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on the last Saturday in January 1993. The chairman's dinner was held in Cahir House Hotel on Sunday, January 3.\n\nMore sports continued to make their appearance in the Awards. In 1995 there were three, Gymnastics, Hockey and Snooker. Swimming was honoured for the first time in 1996, as was Horse Racing in 1998. At the presentation dinner in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 31, 1999 with 350 guests present, Johnny Ryan was presented with an inscribed silver tankard to honour twenty-five years of loyal service to the panel.\n\nA sub-committee of the United Sports Panel was held in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on October 3, 1999 to discuss a special event to celebrate the Millennium Presentation Dinner. The following suggestions were agreed: a) selection of the outstanding sportsmen since the awards began; b) honour the surviving members of the 1959 Sports Stars; c) seek Showerings involvement; d) video the awards ceremony and seek exposure on Multichannel TV; e) produce a souvenier brochure, possibly in colour.\n\nAfter some years being held in Clonmel Arms Hotel the chairman's dinner was held in Cahir House Hotel. Showerings Ltd. gave a 'once off' subvention of £500 to the panel. Three hundred and seventeen people attended the Awards Dinner in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 29, 2000. A presentation tankard was presented to Liam Delahunty to honour twenty-five years loyal service to the panel.\n\nThe chairman's dinner was held in Bailey's of Cashel in January 2002 and Johnny O'Loughlin and Jimmy Cooney were presented with mementoes for their 25 years of service to the panel.. There was a large crowd at the Presentation Dinner in the Clonmel Arms Hotel on January 25, 2002, with 348 guests attending. Sailing was honoured for the first time.\n\nSean Lyons, a founder member, retired at the end of the year. As well as concieving the idea of the awards scheme, Sean was a driving force on the panel over the years and played a huge and pivotal role in its organisation and development. Unfortunately the year ended with the death of Sean, one of the founder members of the panel and for many years the inspiration behind its work.\n\nMartial Arts was recognised for the first time in the 2002 Awards.\n\nAt a meeting on November 9, 2004 it was agreed to name the Sports Executive Award the Sean Lyons Sports Executive Award. It was also agreed to inaugurate a new award, a Special Achievement Award, to be awarded to to athletes who were performaing with some deficiency.\n\nAt the November 9, 2005 meeting the members were informed that the Clonmel Arms Hotel was closing down. Seamus McCarthy offered the Bank of Ireland building in Parnell Street as a meeting place.\n\nA new venue had to be found for the Presentation Dinner and the Hotel Minella was the choice for the meal on January 28, 2006. A letter was sent to Showerings re increase in sponsorship. In reply the company agreed to increase our sponsorship by •1,000 to cover the cost of our move to the Minella Hotel. The chairman's dinner was held in Legends, Cashel on January 14, 2006.\n\nThe AGM of 2006 was held in Mulcahy's Bar, Gladstone Street, Clonmel on October 23. It became the new location of the Panel meetings. Officers elected were as follows: chairman, James Holohan, vice-chairman, Cyril O'Flaherty; secretary, Seamus J. King, treasurer, Ken Conway. Members: Eamonn Wynne, Jimmy Cooney, Johnny O'Loughlin, Michael Guinan, Richie Blanche, Liam Ó Donnchú, Seamus McCarthy. The chairman's dinner was held in Lilli Mai's, Golden on January 20 and the Presentation Dinner was held in the Minella Hotel on January 27.\n\nThe biggest change in the 2007 Awards was in the change in the name of the Awards. The Cidona brand was no longer held by Showerings Limited so they could not retain the name for the Awards. A new name had to be found and the one chosen was Annerville, the name of the townsland where the company is located. So after forty-two years as the Cidona Awards they were called the Annerville Awards for 2007 and presented as such at the presentation dinner, in the Minella Hotel on February 2, 2008.\n\nThe 50th presentations of the awards took place in the Minella Hotel, Clonmel on January 21, 2009. Special guests at the dinner included past members of the panel as well as the survivors of the first awards. A special presentation booklet was produced for the occasion outlining the history of the awards and including the names of all the winners over fifty years. It also included the names of all the members of the United Sports Panel over the period as well as a representative selection of photgraphs.\n\nThe United Sports Panel Award Winners 1959-2008\n\n1959: Camogie: Terry Griffin (Roscrea); Soccer: Pat Ward (Cahir); Table tennis: Kevin Pyke (Hillview); Sports Executive: Bill Hyland (Clonmel A. & C.C.); Athletics: Jack Lalor (Carrick); Cycling: Johnny Gearon (Clonmel); Hurling: John Doyle (Holycross-Ballycahill); Boxing: Liam Ralph (Thurles); Basketball: Phil Fanning (Clonmel); Gaelic Football: Leo Dooley (Roscrea).\n\n1960: Athletics: Jack Lalor (Carrick); Basketball: Timmy O'Dwyer (Clonmel); Hurling: Theo English (Marlfield); Camogie: Kitty O'Flaherty (Cahir); Handball: Con and Tom Cleere (Nenagh); Gaelic Football: Tony Newport (Fethard); Cycling: Patsy Wall (Carrick-on-Suir); Soccer: Mick Boyle (Cahir); Table Tennis: Kevin Pyke (Clonmel); Pitch & Putt: Liam Daly (Clonmel).\n\n1961: Hurling: Liam Devaney (Borrisoleigh); Handball: John Cleary (Tipperary); Pitch and Putt: Eoin Morrissey (Clonmel); Gaelic Football: Babs Keating (Ardfinnan); Cycling: Patsy Wall (Carrick); Athletics: Liam F.

These were Athletics, Basketball, Boxing, Camogie, Cycling, Gaelic Football, Hurling, Soccer, Sports Executive and Table Tennis. Since then thirty more sports have been honoured in the annual awards\n\nWith the exception of Table Tennis, which has only been honoured twice over the fifty years, the other nine sports have been honoured regularly during the intervening years. Standing out above them all, and the only sports to be included in the awards every year, are hurling and athletics, which have 50 awards to date. The continued recognition of hurling is understandable in the light of its standing in the county. There is a strong tradition of athletics also, perhaps not as strong now as it was in the sixties and seventies. In fact from 1967 to 1982 there was double recognition for athletics, with Ladies Athletics and Men's Athletics treated as two distinct sports and each of them honoured annually. In 1983 the panel decided to amalgamate the two with men and women athletes given equal rights to be recognised and in the first two years, 1983 and 1984, the winners were women, Mary Martin of Tipperary and Jackie Stokes of Fethard respectively\n\nGaelic Football takes up third place with 48 awards. It missed out in 1967 and 1979 and it is probably unthinkable that it would miss out today when the panel members vote for sports. Soccer and Sports Excutive take up fourth and fifth positions with 46 awards each. The Sports Executive which, since 2004, is the Sean Lyons Sports Executive Award, named after founder member of the panel and early secretary and longtime treasurer, while mostly recognising managerial talent in sport, covers a range of performances.\n\nCycling has received 39 awards, a recognition of its strength especially in the south of the county. Handball, which was honoured for the first time in 1960, has received the same number of awards.\n\nNext in line is camogie, which has received 30 awards and the sport got regular recognition with the rise of the Tipperary senior team in the nineties. Boxing has received 21 awards and basketball 11, the latter mostly honouring secondary school achievements. Pitch & Putt, which was also recognised for the first time in 1960, has won 14 awards.\n\nWeightlifting came in in 1962, when it won its first award and it has now won 11 in all. A related form of the sport, Powerlifting, was honoured for the fust time in 1981 and has received two awards.\n\nThree sports were honoured for the first time in 1967. As mentioned above Ladies Athletics was recognised as a separate sport in 1967 and until it was amalgamated with men's in 1982, was honoured with 15 Awards. In the same year Golf was honoured and has received 22 awards to date. Rugby was the third sport on the scene that year, perhaps a rather belated recognition of a popular sport but also reflecting its low profile in the county until then, and it has been honoured with 18 awards in the meantime.\n\nNine more sports were honoured during the seventies. Badminton was honoured in 1971 and has 12 awards to date. Clay Bird Shooting got its one and only recognition in 1972. Ladies football came in in 1974 and has received 9 awards. Volleyball was honoured the same year but has received only one award since. Rowing made its appearance in 1975 and has been honoured 9 times in all. Equestrian Sports were recognised in 1976 and has 9 awards to its credit. Sculling got its one and only award in the same year. Tennis was also recognised for the first time in 1976 and has been honoured 7 times in all. Darts received its first and only honour in 1978.\n\nSix sports were honoured for the first time during the eighties. Shooting was honoured for the first and only time in 1980, as was rallying in 1985. Powerlifting was mentioned above. Motor Sport came on the scene in 1986 and has been honoured 4 times in all. Judo, with its first an only honour, was recognised in 1989. In the same year Raquetball made its appearance and has been honoured 8 times in all.\n\nThe nineties continued to recognise new sports. Two unusual ones were honoured for the first and only time in 1990, Canine Sports and Deep Sea Angling. In 1995 Gymnastics, Hockey and Snooker were honoured for the fIrst time. Gymnastics has been honured twice, Hockey 4 times and Snooker 3 times. Swimming got its fIrst of four honours in 1996 as did Horse racing in 1998.\n\nSailing made its first and only appearance in 2001 as did Martial Arts in 2002.\n\nIn a completely different category to anything before was the recognition in a Special Achievement Award of our 4 Special Olympians in the year 2007.\n\nThe great variety of sports that has been honoured in the awards over half-a-century is a very fine recognition of the openness of the members to new sports and their desire to promote them through their recognition in the awards. This work fulfils the purpose of the United Sports Panel which is to promote sport throughout County Tipperary by the annual presentation of the (Cidona) Annerville Awards to the selected stars. While constantly on the lookout for new sports to be recognised the panel have never forgotten the popular sports, which entertain the majority of people within the county, and these continue to be recognised and honoured also.\n\nThe Knocknagow Award\n\nThe format of the United Sports Panel awards has remained fairly constant over the fifty years with the exception of one major addition in 1962, when the Knocknagow Award was added to the list of awards.\n\nThe intention behind the new award was to recognise a great sportsman of the past and the choice of name was most appropriate. The name Knocknagow resonates with so much in the minds of Tipperary people. At one level it recalls the name of Charles Kickhams' great novel about the ordinary people in the 19th century, written by one of themselves. At another level it stands for heroic effort and triumphing against the odds, the ability to rise above one's limitations for the credit of the little village. The name touches the heartstrings of every Tipperary man worth his salt, suggesting devotion to place and county, even to a greater patriotism. It was a most fitting name for an award honouring the greatest Tipperary sporting stars of the past.\n\nIt was only fItting that the fIrst award should go to an athlete, J. J. Ryan of Drumline, who ran over all kinds of distances from the mile to the marathon in the 1920s. He won a 5000 metres international event in Berlin in 1925 with some of the best middle distance runners in Europe trailing in his wake.\n\nMany other athletes have been honoured since then including Ned Tobin, the track and fIeld star, and the Ballincurry Hare, J. J. Barry, Pat O'Callaghan and Bob Tisdall of Olympic fame, Paddy Fahey, Tom Healy and Jimmy Hannon, who shone for Coolcroo AC, as well as Jimmy Reardon, who was one of the fIrst Irish atthetes to get a scholarship to Villanova University, and power- and weight-lifting stars, Michael Arrigan and Frank Rothwell. The latest winner of the award is another athlete, Denis 'Sonny' O'Gorman, a Thurles man who represented the U.K. in the 1960 Olympics\n\nNot surprisingly a number of hurlers have been honoured with the award. The fIrst was Martin Kennedy in 1963 and following him were Tommy Treacy, of Killea and Dublin fame, the surviving members of the 1930 Triple Crown championship winning teams, Tommy Doyle, Johnny Ryan, Willie Wall, Tony Reddin, the four players honoured by An Post for the Millennium, John Doyle, Jimmy Doyle, Jimmy Finn and Tony Reddin, Jimmy 'Butler' Coffey, whose exploits stretch back to the 1920s and 1930s, Theo English and Mickey 'The Rattler' Byme.\n\nGaelic footballers also make the distinguished list, commencing with Tommy O'Keeffe in 1964, and including the surviving members of the 1920 All-Ireland championship winning side, Mick Cahill, the surviving members of the 1935 Munster champions, William 'Bunny' Lambe, Bill Ryan (Laha), Sean Cleary and Pake Brennan.\n\nJohnny Healy of Clonmel was recognised in 1965 and two other boxers, Jimmy Smith and Eddie Cantwell have been recognised since.\n\nRugby has also been honoured three times in Dr. Paddy Stokes of Fethard, Paddy Berkery, who played for Landsdowne and Ireland, and Edmund 'Bunny' O'Rahilly of Clanwilliam.\n\nSoccer has been honoured twice, with Joe Butler of Cahir getting his award in 1966 and P. J. Cumrnins of Clonmel in 1984. Handball has also been honoured twice with Joe Bergin of Nenagh getting the award in 1971 and Paddy Ormonde of Ballyporeen two years later.\n\nA number of sports have received one award. Jack Ayres of Nenagh got the award for his achievements in billiards in 1967. Ed Beary of Clonmel got the award for rowing in 1969. Mick Phelan of Grange was honoured in 1981 for cycling. The famous Tommy O'Brien was awarded in 1974. The journalist and broadcaster was one ofthe finest billiard players in the country in the 1950s, winning three national amateur titles and reaching four other fInals.\n\nThe only woman ever to receive the award was Janet O'Donnell from Kilsheelan. She received her award in 1979 for hockey, having been an Irish international player in the late 1930s.\n\nThe recipients of the Knocknagow Awards are a very select bunch and to date have been chosen from fourteen different sports. The presentation of the award is the high point of the annual presentation dinner. There is usually a dramatic hush among the guests in expectation of the announcement and thunderous applause as the winner makes his way to the podium to receive the presentation. He is the most special person on the night."
