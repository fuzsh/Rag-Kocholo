        "text": "The history of the penal laws against Catholicism in Ireland may be said to date from 1536 when the parliament at Dublin, under pressure from henry viii, passed legislation recognizing him as supreme head of the Church and, among other measures, ordered the suppression of the monasteries. In the following year the same parliament enacted further legislation, particularly an act that required an oath of clerics, degree candidates, and public officials stating they would \"utterly renounce, refuse, relinquish, and forsake the Bishop of Rome and his authority, power, and jurisdiction.\" Such an oath, of course, was incompatible with membership in the Catholic Church. Contumacy, or the repeated refusal to take the oath when offered, could be punished by death. It became treasonable for the clergy and holders of public office to recognize the supremacy of the pope in spiritual matters.\n\nUnder Henry VIII. It has been much debated whether during the remainder of Henry's reign there was a religious persecution in Ireland, whether anyone suffered loss of fortune or liberty or life solely for acknowledging papal jurisdiction. The Annals of the Four Masters, under the year 1537, have the following well-known entry:\n\nThey [i.e., the English schismatics] broke down the monasteries and sold their roofs and bells, so that from Aran of the Saints to the Iccian Sea [the English Channel] there was not one monastery that was not broken and shattered with the exception of a few in Ireland, of which the English took no notice or heed. They afterwards burned the images shrines and relics of the Saints of Ireland and England; they likewise burned the celebrated image of Mary at Trim, which was used to perform wonders and miracles, which used to heal the blind, the deaf and the crippled, and persons affected with all kinds of diseases; and [they also burned] the Staff of Jesus, which was in Dublin performing miracles from the time of St Patrick down to that time, and had been in the hands of Christ while he was among men. They also appointed archbishops and sub-bishops for themselves; and, though great was the persecution of the Roman emperors against the Church, scarcely had there ever come so great a persecution from Rome as this; so that it is impossible to narrate or tell its description, unless it should be narrated by one who saw it.\n\nFrom the foregoing account it is evident that the religious susceptibilities of Catholic Ireland were deeply outraged by the destruction of the monasteries and the profanation of long-venerated relics. And it can be safely surmised that the destruction of the monasteries caused great suffering, hardship, and social dislocation for expelled religious and for the country as well. The monasteries were not simply abodes of study and prayer of the religious. They were schools, hospitals, and inns for wayfarers in remote areas. But the Four Masters, neither in the entry for 1537 nor in those for the rest of Henry's reign, makes any mention of persons who suffered imprisonment, loss of fortune, or death for refusing to recognize the royal supremacy.\n\nThe legislative machinery for persecution was certainly set in position by Henry and his subservient parliament in Dublin, but historical research has not hitherto established that such machinery was actually set in motion. It should be remembered that, at that time, the king's writ affected only one-third of Irish territory and that the old English settlers of the Pale and adjoining districts, whom Henry needed desperately to win over to his policy of conquest, proved thoroughly hostile to his religious innovation and unmistakably loyal to traditional obedience to Rome.\n\nWith the exception of the Spanish Trinitarian Domingo Lopez, historians of the penal times in Ireland have not attempted to portray the so-called Henrician persecution. Lopez's book, a laudatory account of the Trinitarian Order in the British Isles (Madrid 1714), has long been rejected by historians. According to Lopez, some 200 Trinitarians were put to death in Ireland during the period from 1539 to 1550, under circumstances of such publicity and revolting cruelty as could never have escaped the notice of the earlier Catholic annalists. In his earlier researches on the history of the religious persecutions in Ireland, Cardinal Moran all too uncritically accepted for truth the mischievous inventions of Lopez. But it is noteworthy that the cause of the Irish Trinitarians fabricated by Lopez was not submitted to Rome in 1907 when the causes of the Irish martyrs and confessors were forwarded by the Irish hierarchy for examination.\n\nSo far, only two causes of the Henrician period in Ireland are under consideration at the Holy See: (1) Ven. John Travers, Chancellor of St. Patrick's, Dublin, executed in 1535, during the rebellion of Silken Thomas. His cause has been presented with those of the English martyrs because it was believed, until recent times, that he was executed in London and not, as in fact he was, at Oxmanstown, Dublin. (2) The guardian and community of the Franciscan convent, Monaghan, beheaded by English soldiers in 1540. Their cause is discussed in the list below under the year 1589.\n\nUnder Edward VI. The Council of Regency, who were the real rulers during the reign of Henry's son and successor edward vi, altered still further the doctrinal structure of the Church in England by superimposing Protestant doctrines on the schism of Henry. The Mass was rejected and the number of sacraments reduced from seven to two. Orders were transmitted to Ireland to conduct all future services as laid down in the Book of Common Prayer. Most of those in Ireland who had embraced Henry's schism—their numbers were quite insignificant—rejected outright the doctrinal errors being exported from England. For the next six years the Mass continued to be celebrated openly in the wide territories of the Irish chiefs. In the Pale and some towns of the English settlers a few priests preached the royal supremacy but otherwise continued in the old faith. Edward's successor, Mary Tudor, reconciled her dominions to the traditional obedience to the Apostolic See.\n\nUnder Elizabeth I. In 1560 Elizabeth exacted from the parliament at Dublin the enactment of legislation which reasserted the royal supremacy as claimed by Henry VIII. In addition, an Act of Uniformity was passed that obliged Irish Catholics to assist, under penalty of a fine, at the new heretical worship on Sundays and holy days.\n\nelizabeth possessed little genuinely religious zeal, but she was anxious for the Protestantizing of Ireland as part of her plan to extirpate any national identity that the country had. Ireland, she decided, was to become English, culturally as well as politically subjugated to her own kingdom. After a generation of English control, the change in religion would be complete. So the religious legislation was not strictly enforced against the laity throughout her reign. Officials were advised not to provoke the resentment of the old English settlers, for without their good will it would have been almost impossible for her to maintain any grip on Ireland. That the Act of Uniformity stood little chance of being obeyed may be gauged from the fact that, even at the end of Elizabeth's reign, many officeholders had been able to discharge their duties without having taken the supremacy oath. By 1603 four-fifths of the peerage of Ireland were still Catholic.\n\nAfter Elizabeth's excommunication (1570), the persecution of the faith in Ireland, which continued to the end of the reign, was directly aimed against the clergy. Many priests and bishops suffered the extreme penalty, yet the laity are also represented in the roll of honor for the period from 1572 to 1600. The martyrs and confessors who suffered at this time may be enumerated: eight bishops; 18 secular priests; 45 priests, lay brothers, and scholastics of the religious orders; and 26 lay persons, including one woman.\n\nUnder James I. The accession of james i in 1603 bolstered the hopes of Catholic Ireland. In many of the populous centers public worship of the Church was once more set up but the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity remained on the Statute Books. Throughout James's reign, the anti-Catholic laws were not strictly enforced against the laity but were sporadically set in motion, with considerable severity, against the clergy. King James was personally not inclined to enforce edicts against the priests, but the sovereign of England had really ceased to be the effectual master in his own house. For reasons of state, therefore, he had from time to time to order proclamations to be issued from Dublin Castle for the banishment of bishops and priests. But officials were instructed at the same time that while the priests, when discovered, might be transported, they should not be sought out or hunted down. The number of the clergy and laity who suffered during this reign amounts to hardly a quarter of the victims of Elizabeth: one bishop; six secular priests; nine religious; and seven laymen.\n\nUnder Charles I. Although some 34 persons died in prison or on the scaffold during the reign of Charles I, it should be noted that they were victims not of Charles himself but of the Parliamentarians. Early in the reign, Charles, a convinced Protestant, refused any relaxation of the Act of Uniformity but through \"graces\" granted in exchange for large monetary contributions to the royal treasury replaced the oath required by the Act of Supremacy with an oath of simple allegiance to the crown. This royal indulgence, as well as another concerning fixity of land tenure for those with undisturbed occupancy of 60 years, was purely unofficial and therefore revocable at the royal will. Officially the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity remained the law of the land.\n\nUnder the Commonwealth. The persecution of the Church in Ireland under the Commonwealth (1649–60) far surpassed in ferocity that of Elizabethan days. In four years the number of its victims almost equaled that of Elizabeth's entire reign. Catholic worship was effectively outlawed. Apart from the clergy who suffered the extreme penalty, many died of hardship at home or on the high seas while being transported to exile or slavery to which they were condemned in the West Indies or American colonies. Countless thousands of nameless Catholic children and young people kidnaped throughout the Cromwellian regime for slave labor in the abovementioned places were among the victims.\n\nRestoration to 1714. From the Restoration (1660) to the death of Queen Anne (1714) no one, with the exception of St. Oliver plunkett, was executed for the faith, but this period can point to its list of notable confessors.\n\nSources. While some information concerning the Irish martyrs and confessors is forthcoming from the State Papers, naturally distorted by the English anti-Catholic viewpoint, the main source of knowledge of the sufferers for the faith is derived from the various \"martyrologies\" drawn up from 1590 to 1629 and from 1659 to 1669. The Irish Jesuit John Howling (1539–99), founder of the Irish College in Lisbon, is the pioneer writer in this genre of history. His treatise compiled about 1590 was added to successively by Bl. Bp. Cornelius o'devany (1611), Bp. David Rothe (1619), and two priests from Cork but living on the Continent, John Coppinger (1620) and John Molan (1629). At the end of the Commonwealth era, the Franciscan, Maurice Morison, published Threnodia-Hiberno-Catholica, and a decade later his colleague, Antony Bruodin, published Propugnaculum at Prague. Both Franciscan writers had had the experience of the mission in Ireland before they retired to the Continent. Bruodin, however, is not always to be regarded as a critical authority, perhaps because of the remoteness of his later place of residence.\n\nThe above-mentioned sources for the martyrology of Ireland during the penal times (1535–1714) are further amplified by the archives of various religious orders. A fairly full list of published works and MS sources is in the introduction to Father Denis Murphy's well-known work Our Martyrs.\n\nThe active persecution of the Catholic religion in Ireland ended with the death of Anne, although most of the penal laws remained unrepealed until the end of the 18th century. Throughout the century an appeal to Rome for recognition with public cult of the heroism of the Irish martyrs was thought inopportune. Indeed, until Catholic Emancipation in 1829, any move on the part of the Holy See to beatify the Irish who had suffered for the Catholic religion could have had only the result of inviting further penal legislation against the already heavily oppressed Catholics in Ireland.\n\nNearly a generation elapsed after Catholic emanci pation before anything was done to revive interest in the cause of the Irish sufferers for the faith. However, Ireland, from 1830 to 1860 had many and immediate preoccupations: the Tithe War, the Repeal campaign of O'Connell and Young Ireland, the Great Famine, and the resulting exhaustion of the country in the 1850s. Also, throughout this period Catholic Ireland, after the disappearance of penal disabilities, was faced with the heavy task of building churches and schools.\n\nSubmission of Causes. The year 1861 saw the remote beginnings of the movement to present the cause of the Irish martyrs at Rome. In that year Dr. Moran (later cardinal) published his life of St. Oliver Plunket, a work designed to advance the cause of the martyr archbishop of Armagh. A few years later O'Reilly's Memorials of Those Who Suffered for the Catholic Faith in Ireland appeared. This work especially, together with Moran's reissue of the works of Bishop Rothe, focused attention widely on the desirability of submitting the cause of the Irish martyrs to the judgment of the Holy See. The Irish hierarchy soon afterward commissioned Denis Murphy, SJ, to prepare the necessary evidence for the processus ordinarius informativus; the result of his research, Our Martyrs, appeared posthumously in 1896. At the request of the Irish hierarchy, the archbishop of Dublin undertook the investigation of all the causes from every diocese in Ireland. The tribunal of investigation presided over by Abp. William Walsh held many sessions from 1903 to 1907. Its dossier, when dispatched to Rome on 16 March 1915, comprised some 292 causes (a few of them multiple). Of these, 11 were later rejected at Rome (mainly cases of confused identity) and 22 were deferred (for want of clearer evidence to show that imprisonment or death was inflicted principally for the profession of the faith) and are not included in the following lists. The lists reproduce those appearing in the Irish Ecclesiastical Record, 1918 (312–321), but, in some instances, changes with regard to year of death or other particulars established or cogently indicated by later research have been made.\n\nWithin the 20th century several Irishmen were raised to the honors of the altar. Only Oliver Plunket, beatified by Benedict XV, has been canonized (Oct. 17, 1975 by Paul VI). In 1929 Pope Pius XI beatified John Roche, John Cornelius (O'Mahony), John Carey, Patrick Salmon, and Ralph Corby with some of the English martyrs because they worked and were martyred in England.\n\nA representative group of seventeen, known as Dermot O'Hurley and 16 Companions, were beatified Sept. 27, 1992 by Pope John Paul II. Blesseds in this group are indicated below by a †.\n\nChronological List of Confessors and Martyrs.

[This is one of the most controverted of all the causes of the Irish martyrs. The Annals of Lough Cé, the Annals of Connaught, and the Four Masters all mention the massacre of the Monaghan community as of 1540. It is very unlikely that the alleged occurrence of 1589 could have escaped the notice of Howling, O'Devany, and Rothe. The last in his early priestly life was intimately associated with the neighboring (to Monaghan) Archdiocese of Armagh. The Four Masters, written some 15 years after the first mention by Coppinger and Ward of this 1589 massacre, make no allusion to it. No annalist could have failed to draw attention to a double massacre, i.e., in 1540 and 1589. The date 1540 vouched for by the Four Masters, who were Franciscans, seems to be the only acceptable one. There is the important consideration also that in that year the English forces penetrated to O'Neill's territory after their victorious rout of the Irish troops at Bellahoe.]\n\n1590 Matthew O'Leyn, Franciscan, of Kilcrea convent, Muskerry; killed by English soldiers.
