        "text": "Latest News\n\nView all the latest news on Marlfield GAA:\n\n13/2/06 Finance and Club Grounds Major Talking Points at Meeting\n\nThere was a very good exchange of views at the well attended meeting of the Marlfield Hurling Club on Friday night last. Finance was the main item on the agenda and there were many suggestions on how to progress fund raising for the upgrading of the club facilities. Working groups to carry out the running repairs to the existing club house and field equipment were agreed; Group 1 will look after the doors and windows, group 2 will attend to the roof and gutters, group 3 will look after the goal posts and pitch lining. P.J and Brendan will keep up their excellent work on the ground maintenance which is presently in very good condition. During these works the use of the Marlfield Hurling Club Facilities are restricted. Training will commence shortly and players will, be advised of dates and times.\n\nSt Martins Gaelic Football Club will also commence training shortly and Chairman James Dolan and Secretary Paul Higgins will be in contact with their panel of players. Reminder to all club members that their membership is now due and for insurance reasons anybody using the club facilities will have to be insured. Further details on Marlfield Hurling Club from, Secretary Brendan Ferris, Chairman Bill Morrissey, Treasurer John Whyte or P.R.O Bernard Lennon on 08629372\n\n30/1/06 AGM 2006\n\nChairman Bill Morrissey began proceedings with his address. He mentioned the disappointing performances at junior hurling and football during the year. He apportioned much of the fault of this to the lack of players. He thanked John Whyte, Brendan Ferris and Ron Collins for their efforts in contacting players for the matches. He hoped that re-entering St. Martins as a separate football club would allow more players to play with the club in the coming year. He thanked PJ OMeara for the up-keep of the grounds during the year which due to the renting of the field to Commercials provided a major source of income to the club. He made reference to the talks which had taken place regarding a merger with Clonmel Commercials. He said that after a number of meetings there was a lot of common interests but that it was unlikely that anything would happen in the near future. Bill said that there were no more meetings scheduled but that they would meet and discuss a possible merger with any club. He stressed, however, that no deal would be done behind closed doors and that any decisions would be made at a full club meeting.\n\nThe secretarys report again mentioned the poor performance at adult level in hurling and football and apportioned much of the blame on the lack of players. It was also mentioned how the club had failed to enter any underage players during the year. He stated that more coaches and money would be required to re-establish a juvenile club. He also mentioned the need for finances and man power to carry out some much needed repairs to the clubhouse and grounds. He recommended the establishment of a finance/fundraising committee that would look into the raising of money for the club during the year. Con Hogan asked what was needed to run the club on our own. Brendan Ferris said that at least four or five more adult players were required for both the junior football and hurling teams. He also said that 8 to 12 coaches were required to fully re-establish the juvenile club. It was suggested that the juvenile club initially field an U-12 football and hurling team and build the club from there. The secretary also said that due to the small population base in the village that it would be necessary to run buses from Clonmel for training and that this would cost over 5000 per year. Ned Lonergan mentioned how running the buses before had led to a lack of interest from parents. It was also noted that help may become available from the hurling development committee that was currently getting involved in Clonmel.\n\nThe treasurer, John Whyte, presented his annual report. It showed that despite the inactivity in the club that without a major fundraising event during the year we were eating into our bank balance with our annual expenses, affiliations, registrations etc. It was suggested that this may be something that the new finance committee could look after. The treasurers report was proposed by Brendan Ferris and seconded by Paul Higgins.\n\nElection of Officers: Chairman Bill Morrissey was re-elected, proposed by B. Lennon and seconded by R. Collins. Secretary Brendan Ferris was re-elected, proposed by Paul Higgins and seconded by B. Morrissey. Treasurer John Whyte was also re-elected, proposed by B. Morrissey and seconded by B. Ferris. Bernard Lennon was elected PRO, proposed by P. Higgins and seconded by R. Collins. Noel Cosgrave and Brendan Ferris were jointly elected as South Board representatives and Ned Lonergan was elected as county board representative.\n\nJames Dolan was elected as chairman of St. Martins, proposed by B. Ferris and seconded by B. Morrissey. Paul Higgins was elected secretary, proposed by R. Collins and seconded by B. Morrissey. James Dolan was elected as South Board representative and Noel Cosgrave was elected as county board representative.\n\n28/1/06 AGM 2006 - Secretary's Report\n\nSecretarys Report:\n\nClick on the link below to view the Secretary's Report from last nights AGM.\n\nView Secretary's Report Word Format\n\n28/1/06 Marlfield GAA Website back on-line\n\nApologies to all for the inactivity on this website for the past year or so. With the election of a new PRO at our recent AGM it is hoped to have regular weekly updates on all club activities on this site.\n\n17/10/04 Review of 2004\n\nA more in dept review will appear in the secretary's report which will be available after the AGM.\n\nJunior Hurling : Despite the introduction of a league based championship the Junior hurlers were unable to progress in this years South Championship. The management took the oppertunity during the year to introduce younger players from our Juvenile ranks to the side. It is hoped that this influx of youth will freshen the side up and with some more experience will go on to lead the club to some success.\n\nJunior Football : Again we struggled in a championship that we should be challenging for. Unfortunately it seems to suffer from fixture congestions and many games were played mid-week. This was of particular disadvantage to the side as many of the players are based outside the county.\n\nJuveniles : Yet again this was the most successful part of the club this year.\n\nOur U-16's were competing at at 'B' in the football championship and came through the league phase undefeated. Unfortunately their performance on the day was not up to their usual standards and they lost out to Carrick Davins. The same side just recently won the South hurling championship, beating Skeheenarinka in the final, and are awaiting their county semifinal.\n\nOur U-14's reached the knockout stages in both hurling and football and were short some vital players for both semi-finals. Their performances bode well for next years championship.\n\n17/10/04 Web-Site off-line\n\nApologies to all who have accessed this website looking for updates on the Club. Unfortunately we were not able to keep the site current during the year.\n\nHopefully this will be sorted for next season\n\n18/1/04 New Officers Elected at AGM\n\nFriday's AGM saw a host of changes in the officers positions, the new committees are as follows:\n\nMarlfield HC : Chairman-Bill Morrissey Secretary-Brendan Ferris Treasurer-John Whyte Asst. Tres-James Dolan PRO-Ron Collins\n\nSt Martins GFC : Chairman-James Dolan Secratery-Paul Higgins\n\nJuvenile Clubs : Chairman-Philip Hennessey Secretary-Martin Monaghan Asst. Sec.-JJ English\n\nCongratulations to all those elected and best of luck in their positions for the coming year. The appointment of managers was put of for the ajourned AGM and a big player input is requested for this particular meeting.\n\n14/1/04 WEB-SITE BACK ON LINE\n\nApologies to all for the lack of activity on the site for the past few months, this was a tempory hitch and it is hoped to keep the site regularly up-dated from now on.\n\n6/9/03 U-16's Loose to Newcastle\n\nOur Juvenile playing activity came to an end this afternoon as our U-16 hurlers lost out to Newcastle in a South semi-final played in Goatenbridge. This was a disappointing end to a successful season as we had hoped to win a hurling title to go with our two football titles. Congratulations to all involved for their effort all season.\n\n31/8/03 U-14's Beaten in Semi-Final\n\nOur U-14 hurlers were robbed of a place in the South Championship final by a last-minute goal from Fr. Sheehy's in the semi-final tonight. Having led early in the game we were unlucky to concede two late first half goals which left us trailing by five points at the break. Another flurry of scores early in the second half had us backin front, alead we held untill the dying moments of the game.\n\nGood performanceson the night came from Colin Burke, Kevin McGrath, Ian Mullins, Con Sheehan and John Ryan, however the entire squad, including their coaches, must be thanked for their huge effort all year.\n\n25/8/03 Juvenile Up-date\n\nOur U-14 hurlers are due to play Fr. Sheehy's in their South semi-final in the coming week and having beaten the same opposition by only a point in the group stages, nothing less than 100% effort will be good enough to see us through to a final.\n\nOur U-16s have also earned themselves a place in the semi-finals and will be looking to avenge the loss to Newcastle in the opening league game.\n\n23/8/03 Hurlers bow out of Junior Championship\n\nOur Junior hurlers bowed out of the South championship on Friday night last with a disappointing loss to Ballylooby. The side started the match briskly and a Paul Cahill goal had us level with twenty minutes played, however two quick goals before half time, for Ballylooby, left the team reeling and they never really recovered. Despite much effort from the team in the second half, they never managed to eat into the oppositions lead and Ballylooby ran out easy winners. This was a disappointing end to the season and leaves the players with just the football to concentrate on, training for which continues with Anthony Power.\n\n21/8/03 Win or Bust for Junior Hurlers\n\nOn Friday evening in Goatenbridge, our Junior hurlers face Ballylooby in the South Championship. The winners on the night will be rewarded with a place in the draw for the quarter finals, whilst the loosers will have to wait another 12 months for a chance of glory. With this in mind it is hoped that we will have a big turn-out on Friday, both on the side-line and in the dressing-room. The side will be looking for big performances from Topsy Williams, team captain Philip Hennessey, Bill Morrissey and Paudie Quinnlivan, to name but a few, as they go in search of much needed sucess.\n\n20/8/03 Summer Camp in Elm Park\n\nOur summer hurling camp got underway this morning in Elm Park, where boys and girls aged 5 - 12 years were coached some of the skills of hurling by our dedicated coaches ably assisted by County Board Games Promotion Officer Johnny Cummins. It is hoped that by running the event in Elm Park it will give the children of the area a taste of the GAA which they will hopefully carry on. A big thanks must go to Philly Hennessey and his coaches, David Cosgrave, Conor Hogan, Fred Fortune, Bill Morrissey and Brendan Ferris for giving up their time for the week to organise and run the event.\n\n18/8/03 U-16's Loose Out to Skeheenarinka\n\nOur U-16 hurlers have left themselves with a lot of work to do to qualify for the South semi-final after a dissappointing loss to Skeheenarinka on Monday evening. The team were well down at half-time and fought really hard to come back level but in the end lost out by a single point. Good performances on the night came from Graham Fox, Kevin McGrath, Shane Weste and Ian Mullins. Another victory should put us in a South semi-final and if we can play for the full hour we have the ability to win a South title.\n\n16/7/03 Ian Moore Blitz\n\nOur annual 7-a-side football blitz takes place this Saturday at 11am in the lawn. Clonmel Commercials will be looking to defend their title, however a strong home side will hope to challenge for the victory. With a large number of teams from the town competing, an entertaining day is guaranteed for all.\n\n15/7/03 Minor Hurling Championship\n\nThe minor hurlers continued their championship campaign on Tuesday evening and a victory was required to keep our championship hopes alive. All minors are reminded that training takes place Tuesday and Fridays with the Junior side,\n\n14/7/03 U-16's bow out of Championship\n\nOur U-16 footballers were unlucky to loose their county semi-final to Ballinahinch on Monday night. Short a couple of key players on the night we had our chances to win the game but were denied by the woodwork on more than one occasion. Despite the two point defeat, the players must be congratulated for their remarkable achievements this year and it is hoped that we can double our successes by winning a South hurling title as the championship begins next Monday night.\n\n17/6/03 Greyhound Night\n\nThe club are running a Greyhound Race night on Thursday June 26th next in the Clonmel Greyhound Track. This event has been identified as a major fund-raiser for the day to day running of both our senior and juvenile clubs, as well as continued club development. Tickets are available from all club members and can also be bought on the night.\n\nAs much of the funds raised go towards the Juvenile club we would appreciate it if the parents of our Juvenile players could support this night. A great night of racing is guaranteed for all.\n\n15/6/03 U-12's loose out to Borrisleigh in Replay\n\nOur U-12 football side bowed out of the County football championship this weekend in a semi-final replay to Borrisleigh. The lads tried their utmost to succeed on a blistering afternoon, but it was not to be their day as they ended up loosing by six points.\n\nThey will not have much time to ponder over this defeat, however, as they are out in the hurling championship this Thursday night away to St. Patricks. A bus will collect players in town at 6.00pm\n\n1/6/03 U-12's Win South Football Title\n\nOur U-12 football side under Philip Hennessey and Martin Monahan matched their U-16 counterparts by winning a South title at Clonmel GAA field. With Craig Brew up front in fine form and Jamie Freaney in goal ably assisted by Hayden Grace and John Ryan at the back, we never looked like relinquishing an early lead, despite the efforts of a galliant Cahir team. At full time Brian O'Hara collected the plaque from South Bord chairman Mick Lonergan to the cheers of the Marlfield supporters.\n\nView Picture of the South Champions\n\nView Picture of the team celebrating\n\nBrian O'Hara receiving the trophy\n\n23/5/03 U-16's Win South Football Title\n\nJJ English's U-16 football side defeated Ballyporeen in a dramatic South final replay at Ardfinnan this evening on a 3-9 to 1-9 scoreline. Another outstanding performance from the side has put them in a county semi-final. It was a great honour to see Gino Lonergan collect the first piece of silverware of the year.\n\nView Picture of the South Champions\n\nGino Lonergan receiving the trophy\n\n21/5/03 Juniors Face Clonmel Óg\n\nOur Junior hurlers are out in the South league this Friday night against Clonmel Óg in Ned Hall Park with a 7.30 throw-in. All players are asked to be there before 7pm. This is a game we need to win to give us a chance of progressing in this league.\n\n20/5/03 Greyhound Night\n\nThe Club are running a night at the dog track on June 26th with all proceeds in aid of the Juvenile club. This is the clubs major fundraiser for the year and it is hoped that as many of the businesses in town as possible will support us. Details of the sponsorship options are available from any committee member. The money we are hoping to raise will be used in our attempts to promote Gaelic Games amongst young people in Clonmel.\n\n18/5/03 U-16's Earn Replay\n\nOur U-16s staged a dramatic comeback to draw their South football final on Friday night last. Kevin OKeefes injury time point has earned us a place in a replay that takes place on Wednesday night. A win here would have put us in a county semi-final, something that the players and their manager JJ English deserve for the spirit they showed on Friday night.\n\n16/5/03 U-12's reach South semi-final\n\nThe U-12s have successfully come through their South football championship group undefeated and have qualified to play Grangemockler in the semi-final next weekend. This game will most likely be played Sunday and all players will be notified of the exact time in training on Saturday.\n\n13/5/03 U-16's reach South Final\n\nOur U-16 footballers are through to a South final thanks to a victory over Ballylooby this evening. The game finished all square after normal time but our boys dominated the extra time period and ended up winning by six points.\n\n4/5/03 U-16 South Semi Final Postponed\n\nDue to a water-logged pitch in Ardfinnan, this mornings semi-final was postponed. News of the re-fixed date will appear shortly.\n\n29/4/03 U-16's reach South Semi-Final\n\nOur U-16 footballers play their South semi-final against Ballylooby next Sunday at 11am in Ardfinnan. This is an excellent chance for success this season and a full turnout is required for the game. The bus will collect players at 10am from the usual points. In preparation for this we play Clonakenny in Marlfield at 3.30 on Saturday, players will be collected at 2.45 from town. All U-14's are welcome to play this match also as their championship gets underway on Monday 5th.\n\n28/4/03 Junior Hurlers loose to Rockwell Rovers\n\nIn our second match of the year our Junior hurlers lost an entertaining game to Rockwell Rovers. The game was marred however by a few injuries to key players. After a very slow start to the game, we down at half time despite playing with the aid of a strong wind. We began the second half with a more committed attitude and but for the lack of fire-power up front could have threatened Rockwell's lead. Good performances on the night came from Conor Hogan, Philly Hennessey and Paudie Quinlivan. We will look to build on this game in the up-coming South league.\n\n12/4/03 Juvenile Football\n\nOur Juvenile footballers have started the year with at a blistering pace with three wins and a draw so far this year. Our U-12's have a 100% record so far with wins over Newcastle and Moyle Rovers. While the U-16's have all but guarranted themselves a South final place with a draw against Ballyporeen and victory over Newcastle.\n\n7/4/03 Sympathies\n\nThe club would like to send its sympathy to the family and friends of Frank Halley on his recent bereavement. Frank was a founding member of the club and served as our treasurer for many years. A detail of Franks involvement with the club will appear in the history section of the site shortly.\n\n6/4/03 Easter Draw\n\nTickets are now available for the clubs annual Easter raffle and are available from any committee member. All proceeds are in aid of the Juvenile club and these funds are vital this year, as we incur extra costs with our new coaching initiative on Saturday mornings. Finances are needed to back up the efforts of our dedicated coaches.\n\n27/3/03 Club Membership\n\nThe annual club membership is now due for all club members. It is priced at 20 for all adult members and no player will be allowed to play for the club until this is paid. Juvenile membership is also due at a charge of 8 and this includes a free hurley.\n\n24/3/03 Juvenile Fixtures\n\nA full list of all juvenile football fixtures for the coming year is now available in the fixtures and results section of this web-site. It is hoped to have all results on the site within 24 hours of matches.\n\n16/3/03 Junior Training\n\nTraining continues for Junior hurlers and footballers on Tuesday and Friday nights, and bigger numbers are required if we have any intentions of wining a championship this year. All minors and U-21s are expected to train with the Juniors and it is imperative that they turn up in greater numbers. This particularly applies to the U-21 footballers who will be out in championship action in the near future.\n\n12/3/03 Recent Bereavements\n\nThe club would like to extend its sympathies to the Whyte family on their recent bereavement, and also to the family of Tommy Quinnlivan on their sudden loss. With this in mind the club has decided to postpone the annual Ian Moore blitz which was to be held this Saturday.\n\n11/3/03 Juvenile Coaching\n\nLast week saw the start of our Juvenile coaching program, and a large crowd of over seventy children were present on Saturday morning for football and hurling coaching. The coaching continues this Saturday and it is hoped that we can improve on last weeks numbers. An active and fun morning is guaranteed for all children in an attempt to get them involved in Gaelic games. As was the case last week a bus will be run from town, collecting children at St. Olivers and the Gaelscoil at about 10.40am. Coaching will begin at 11am sharp and all children from 7 to 12 years of age, boys and girls, are welcome. Any further information can be got from Brendan Ferris on 0864053893.\n\n10/3/03 Vandals Attack Clubhouse\n\nOver the last two weeks the clubhouse has been attacked by vandals, the last and most serious was a break in on Sunday night last, which has led to the unfortunate situation of contacting the Gardai.\n\n1/3/03 South Tipp GAA championship draws\n\nThe draws were made for the various South championships at the adjourned convention on Thursday 20th February. We have been given a bye in the first round of the Junior hurling, therefore we are only guaranteed one game in the championship. With this in mind it is hoped that we can get good numbers out for training when we start next week.\n\nOur Junior footballers have been drawn in a group alongside Killenaule, Moyle Rovers, Grangemockler, Carrick Davins and Fr. Sheehys, while our U-21 footballers will soon be out in action against St. Patricks.\n\nThe U-21 hurlers have drawn Skeheenarinky in the first round of their championship which is run on a knockout basis. The minor hurling and minor football championships will be run on a league basis.\n\n16/2/03 Juvenile Coaching\n\nAs we start into a new year the club have decided to invest their time into developing further the Juvenile side of the club. With this in mind all children from 7yrs up are invited to attend coaching on Saturday mornings in Marlfield. This begins on the 8th March at 11am and a bus will be arranged to collect those in town.\n\nClick on the link below to view a short presentation on this coaching and its aims.\n\nView Presentataion PowerPoint format\n\n7/2/03 Medals Presentation for U-14 Footballers\n\nThe victorious U-14 football side that won South and county honors last year were presented with their medals on Friday night. Medals were presented by former county board chairman Con Hogan and Tipperary's senior goalkeeper Philly Ryan. All present also gave credit to Noel Cosgrave for his excellent work with the side and for his five years of service as Juvenile secretary. It is hoped that we will have these players back training along with all the other under-age sides in mid March as we go in search of further success. The club would like thank all who helped out on Friday night and in particular Philly Ryan for coming to make the presentation.\n\nView Picture of the team at the presentation\n\n10/1/03 Coaching Lessons\n\nAny club members interested in coaching should get in touch with Philip Hennessey immediately, as he is entering a few members in a level one coaching course to take place in Clonmel shortly.\n\n3/1/03 Con Hogan Elected to Central Council\n\nThe club would like to congratulate Con Hogan on his election to Central Council at county convention before Christmas. The delegates rewarded Con for his diligent service as county board chairman, during the last three years, with election to this prestigious position.\n\n1/12/02 South Junior B Football Final\n\nOur Junior footballers failed in their attempt to bring home an historic first South football title on Sunday last in Ardfinnan against Ballyporeen. Great credit must go to both sets of players for performing in conditions which were not conducive to good football. Both sides found it difficult to adapt to the elements and scores were at a premium in the early stages. An early Ballyporeen point was cancelled out by a Paul Cahill free for St Martins. Three late scores for Ballyporeen gave them the advantage by 0-4 to 0-1 going into the break. The early stages of the second half were scrappy, as the sides exchanged a couple of points with most players struggling to hold on to the ball in the atrocious conditions. A goal for Ballyporeen mid-way through the half proved decisive despite the best efforts of the Marlfield players to retrieve the deficit. Best on the day for St. Martins were Owen Parker in defence, George Fuller in the middle of the field and Paul Cahill up front, while young David Cosgrave impressed in goal in his first start. All credit must go the players and their management team of Anthony Power, Morris Kennedy and John Whyte for the effort theyve put in all year, and lets hope we can go a step further next year.\n\n29/11/02 South Junior B Football Final\n\nOur Junior footballers play their long awaited South final against Ballyporeen on Sunday next at 2.30pm in Ardfinnan. Without a competitive fixture for two months it has been difficult to maintain focus, however great credit must go to the players for their commitment in training over the last few weeks.\n\nDespite going into the game as underdogs, the side are very hopeful of bringing an historic South title back to the village. It is hoped that as many supporters as possible will make the trip to Ardfinnan to cheer on the team to victory.\n\n11/11/02 AGM\n\nThe AGM incorporating Marlfield HC, St. Martins GFC and the juvenile club took place yesterday in the clubhouse. Congratulations to all those elected and lets hope that they carry on the good work of this year. Bill Morrissey, Paul Higgins and John Whyte were re-elected to the hurling club committee, while James Dolan was elected as chairman of St. Martins GFC. After five years of diligent service Noel Cosgrave is stepping down as secretary of the juvenile club and his presence will be sorely missed. Brendan Ferris and Philip Henessey have been elected to the juvenile committee where they will attempt to build on Noels successes.\n\n1/11/02 Junior Footballer Training\n\nTraining continues for our footballers in preparation for their South Final, we await the result of the other semi-final between Ballyporeen and Mullinahone, before the date for the final will be fixed.\n\n6/10/02 Junior Footballers Reach South Final\n\nOur Junior footballers fought back from an eight point half-time deficit to defeat Carrick Davins in the South Junior B semi-final on Sunday afternoon in Kilsheelan. In a game played in conditions that resembled July we went into the game as underdogs and all the early indications were that this was a deserving tag. The side looked nervous from the start and struggled to hold onto possession. A sharper looking Davins side seized the initiative and converted the chances that came their way. We went into the interval 1-8 to 0-3 down and looked like a beaten side. However the side returned to the field for the second half looking more determined and an early goal from Peter Kiely set the tone for the rest of the game. Paul Cahill and Gearoid Collins traded points with the Davins forwards before two more St. Martins goals put us in the driving seat. A further goal just minutes before the end, from Philly Hennessey sealed the victory that puts us in a South final. All the players deserve credit for a fine victory, particularly Ron the Cat Collins and his defence who managed to concede just a single point in the second period, Paul Williams who ran himself into the ground in the middle of the field and David Cahill who finished the game with a tally of 2-1.\n\n25/9/02 Junior Footballers continue preparations\n\nWith our place in a South semi-final now almost guaranteed (two matches have yet to be played before the final group placings can be confirmed), the footballers continue preparing for this semi-final with training twice a week on Wednesday's and Friday's. A number of challenge matches have also been played to allow the management finalise their starting fifteen.\n\n14/9/02 Junior Hurlers Bow out to Newcastle\n\nAnother year has passed without any sucess for our Junior hurling team after a seven point defeat to Newcastle this evening. The game was dominated in the early stages by a sharper looking Newcastle team and our defence was tested on many occasions. We went in to the half-time interval only a few scores down, thanks mainly to a Gearoid Collins goal, scored against the run of play. Our performance in the second period was much improved and but for a few wasted chances we could have overcome our oppenents. On the day Paudie Quinlivan, Paul Cahill and Philip Hennessy were the best on the Marlfield side.\n\nThis was a disappointing way to go out, particularly after all the hard work that went in since February, however we must try to build on this for next year in our aim in winning a south title and wish Newcastle all the best in the champonship.\n\n10/9/02 Junior Hurlers Draw Newcastle\n\nOur Junior hurling side have been drawn against Newcastle in the next round of the Junior hurling championship. With a place in the South semi-final up for grabs this is sure to be a tough battle with our old rivals. Newcastle have been in good form thus far in the championship and with an impressive victory over Cahir only last week under their belts, they are sure to be hot favourites for the tie. Throw-in for the game has been fixed for 6pm in Goatenbridge and all support would be greatly appreciated.\n\n9/9/02 Junior Hurlers Beat Rockwell Rovers\n\nJust a week before the next round of the hurling championship, a challenge match was played against Rockwell Rovers in the lawn on Monday night. In a lively game we ran out eventual winners by a single point. This result should fill us with confidence given that we had gone down heavily to the same side a few months earlier. Best on the night were Paudie Quinlivan in goal, Benny OConnell and Bill Morrissey in defence and David Cahill in the forward line.\n\n30/8/02 Gleneletric Tean Wins Golf Classic\n\nOur annual Golf Classic was run today and thankfully the weather held up for the day and all the teams got around in fairly good conditions. The eventual winners on the day were the Glenelectric team, who were presented with their prizes of Waterford Crystal lamps by the club chairman. The club would like to thank all the people and businesses who sponsored teams or tee-boxes for the event. Clonmel Golf club must also be thanked for their hospitality on the day and complemented on the excellent condition of the course.\n\n18/8/02 Junior Footballer's Find Going Tougher\n\nThe Junior Footballers played two matches in the past week, on Wednesday we suffered our first defeat of the year at the hands of Ballyporeen and this was followed with a draw against Newcastle on Saturday night.\n\nThe game Wednesday night was played in dreadful conditions in the lawn and two Ballyporeen goals proved to be the difference between the sides as we went down on a 2-4 to 0-9 score line. The side fought well in the last few minutes and deserved more from the game. Best for St. Martins were Brian Morrissey, David Cahill and Shane OConnell.\n\nThe game Saturday evening was played in Goatenbridge against Newcastle and we held out to draw the game with a final score of 11 points a piece. Most impressive for the side were Bill Morrissey, Owen Parker and Paul Cahill.\n\nWe are not certain yet if we have a place in the semi-final or if we have to play another game in the league stages, training continues Wednesdays and Fridays along with the Junior hurlers at 7.30 pm.\n\n14/8/02 Golf Classic Cancelled\n\nDue to circumstances beyond our control we have had to postpone Fridays golf classic, this has now been re-fixed for the 30th August. Apologies to everyone for the inconvenience caused by cancelling at such a late stage. The organising committee will be in touch with all involved to confirm their attendance and tee-times for the re-fixed date.\n\n10/8/02 Junior Footballer's Keep Up Winning Ways\n\nThe Junior footballers followed up their victories against Fethard and Killenaule with a 10 point win over Grangemockler. In a game played on Saturday evening in Kilsheelan, we struggled in the early exchanges and a soft Grangemockler goal left us trailing by three points at the break. A much improved performance was seen in the second half, particularly by Paul Cahill who finished the game with a tally of 3-5. The defence played well throughout, particularly Owen Parker, while up front Shane OConnell gave a good display. The game however was dominated by Paul Cahill who scored all but six points of the St. Martins scores.\n\n5/8/02 U-14 Hurlers Defeated in South Final\n\nOur U-14 hurlers lost the replay of their south final to Newcastle on Monday evening. In a game played in Ardfinnan we found scores very hard to come-by and despite dominating the possession we could not convert this into scores. We trailed by five points to one at the break and could only manage to reduce the Newcastle lead by a single point in the second period. On the day Newcastle were deserving winners, and we wish them all the best in the County Championship.\n\nBest for Marlfield were Kevin Murray in goal, Niall McCarthy and Brian OHara were strong in defence, Gino Lonergan was excellent in the middle of the field, while Gary Doyle and Colin OMahony were the best of our forwards.\n\n4/8/02 Junior Hurlers Beat Ballingarry\n\nOur junior hurlers recorded a victory over Ballingarry in the first round of the championship on Sunday evening. After a couple a years without a championship win, we should be able to build on this victory and go on to achieve some success this year. We started the game very brightly and early scores from Philip Hennessey and David Cahill gave us a lead that we never relinquished. We went into the half-time interval eight points to three up. A goal from PJ OMeara early in the second half put us into a strong position and despite a Ballingarry come-back our defence held firm, and a late goal from Anthony Brew sealed the victory.\n\nBest for Marlfield on the night were JJ English and George Fuller at the back, Dean Kennedy did an amount of work in mid-field, while David Cahill and Philip Hennessey were the best in an impressive forward line.\n\n30/7/02 U-14 Hurlers Draw South Final\n\nOur U-14 hurlers must do it all again after finishing level with Newcastle in a match played in Ardfinnan. A tough uncompromising game seemed to be going our way after a late Colin O'Mahony point put us in the lead. However the referee managed to find seven minutes of injury time and awarded Newcastle a late dubious free, to tie up the game.\n\nAn early Ian Mullins goal put us in a strong positon and we led by four points at the break. Newcastle dominated the second period and with time almost up the sides were level at 1-2 a piece. A last minute score from Colin O'Mahony seemed to have given us the title, however this wasn't to be and this tie will have to be decided with a replay.\n\nBest for Marlfield were Kevin McGrath, Gino Lonergan, Colin O'Mahony and Eoin Burke.\n\n29/7/02 Junior Hurling Championship\n\nThe championship game against Ballingarry has been fixed for Sunday evening at 7.30 in Fethard. It is important that we get a full turnout for this game and for the remaining training session on Friday evening at 7.30 p.m.\n\n28/7/02 Junior Footballer's Notch-up Second Win\n\nThe Junior footballers followed up their victory against Fethard with a two point win over Killenaule. In a scrappy game played on Sunday evening we failed to repeat the performance seen against Fethard but still scraped through to win. Most impressive for the side were Owen Parker and David Cahill, while Paul Cahills accuracy from frees provided the majority of scores.\n\n23/7/02 New Arrival in the club\n\nCongratulations to Brian Morrissey and Rosemary on the birth of their baby boy today.\n\n23/7/02 U-14 Hurlers Reach South Final\n\nA late late comeback saw our U-14's pull off a one point victory over Skeheenarinka, in a game played at Ned Hall Park. The opening half was a high scoring one with our three goals from Kevin Dahill, Ian Mullins and Colin O'Mahony cancelled out by three Skeheen goals. We trailed by two points at the interval, 3-5 to 3-3. The second half was a much tighter affair with Skeheenarinka flooding their defence in an effort to hold their lead. A Shane Weste free and a late point from Colin O'Mahony seemed to have us heading for a replay until man of the match Kevin Dahill stepped up to score the winning point. Best for Marlfield were Kevin Murray in goal, Kevin McGrath and Jason Coburn in defence, Kevin Dahill in midfield, Gino Lonergan and Colin O'Mahony in the attack.\n\nMarlfield:K Murray, E Burke, K McGrath, B O'Hara, S Weste(0-2), S Wall, J Coburn(0-1), K Dahill(1-2), G Doyle, G Lonergan, C O'Mahony(1-1), C Sheehan, I Mullins(1-0).

The club will be in contact with all teams involved, in the next week to confirm their participation and to collect the entry fee.\n\n17/7/02 Junior Footballers Defeat Fethard\n\nThe Junior Footballers opened their campaign with a win against Fethard in Cloneen. After a shaky first half we trailed by 1-5 to 0-5, this margin would have been wider but for some excellent free-taking by Paul Cahill. Two early goals from Paul Cahill and James Dolan in the second half gave the side a badly needed shot in the arm, and we went on to play some good football, with excellent scores from Dean Kennedy, Owen Parker, Shane OConnell and particularly Paul Cahill. Our defence, well marshalled by Bill Morrissey and Paul Williams held firm for the final ten minutes, and we ran out eventual winners on a 3-12 to 1-6 scoreline.\n\n4/7/02 U-14 Hurlers Defeat Newcastle\n\nOur U-14 hurlers notched up their first victory of the season with a seven point win over Newcastle in Newcastle. After a sluggish start we got into our stride with a couple of goals either side of half time from Gary Doyle and Shane Weste. We eventually ran out winners on a 3-4 to 0-7 scoreline. Most impressive were Eoin Burke and Kevin McGrath at the back and Gino Lonergan, Con Sheehan and Gary Doyle up front.\n\nScorers for Marlfield : Shane Weste 2-1, Gary Doyle 1-1, Con Sheehan 0-1 and Colin O'Mahony 0-1.\n\n28/6/02 U-14's Win Historic County Title\n\nOur U-14 footballers brought a first ever county title back to Marlfield this evening after defeating Kildangan in a tough encounter in Thurles. The opening exchanges were scrapy as is often the case in a final when both teams are somewhat nervous, however we managed to keep our noses in front thanks to good scores from Con Sheehan and Gino Lonergan amoungst others, and good defending particularly from Eoin Burke and Jason Coburn. A late penalty, converted by Gino Lonergan gave us a slight cussion going into half-time.\n\nThe first 15 minutes of the second half were all St. Martins and some of the scores from Kevin O'Keefe and David Joyce would have graced any level of Juvenile football. Kildangan proved themselves worthy North champions with a late second half comeback, however our defence, well marshalled by Kevin Murray and Shane Weste held firm and we ran out winners on a 1-11 to 1-2 scoreline. It was a fitting end to the night when County Board Chairman Con Hogan presented captain Kevin Murray with the trophy.\n\nSt. Martins Team : Ross Moroney, Eoin Burke, Shane Weste, Colin O'Mahony, Jason Coburn, Kevin Murray, Kevin O'Keefe, Gino Lonergan, Gary Doyle, Con Sheehan, David Joyce, Kevin McGrath, Shane Norris. Subs - Ian Mullins, Shane Harris, Niall McCarthy, Micheal Burke, Colin Burke, Shane Wall, Brendan O'Meara, Philip Hayde, Darren Boland and Brian O'Hara.\n\nView Picture of the County Champions\n\nKevin Murray receiving the trophy\n\n28/6/02 Juvenile Club Annual Flag Day\n\nThe club ran a very successful flag day to earn some extra funds for the juvenile club.

An early goal from Ian Mullins was added to by fine scores from Gino Lonergan and Con Sheehan and we seemed to be well in control. This was all to change as Sean Tracey's responded with a late first half goal and two goals within minutes of the restart had them back level. With Jason Coburn out centre-back on their danger man, we shoared up the gaps in our defence, and allowed the forwards to put us back in the lead. Despite a late rally from the West champions our defence, well marshalled by captain Kevin Murray, held firm and the game finished 3-8 to 3-4.\n\nScorers for St. Martins : Shane Norris 1-1; Con Sheehan 0-3; Gino Lonergan 0-3; David Joyce 1-0; Ian Mullins 1-0; Kevin O'Keefe 0-1.\n\n3/06/02 U-14 Football South Champions\n\nCongratulations to our U-14 football team in collecting the first cup of the year in winning the South Championship. The final was a very good sporting game played against a very competitive Ballingarry team. Marlfield had some great preformances especially from Ian Mullins, Jason Coburn, Shane Weste, Colin O'Mahony and Gary Doyle. Kevin Murray as a captain gave an exemplary performance with Gino Lonergan doing trojan work at midfield. This was a very close match with Ballingarry dominating the first half and went into the second half with a narrow lead. Our lads got off to a slow start but showed tremendous character to pull away in the final 15 minutes. The backs put in a great performance in the last 5 minutes to ensure victory. Great credit must be given to Noel Cosgrove in preparing such a fine team. We wish them every luck in th county championship and hope they bring a second cup home.\n\n25/05/02 Juniors Go Down To St. Pats\n\nIn a game played in very poor conditions in Kilsheelan, the Junior hurlers were defeated by five points by St. Patricks. The early loss of Philip Hennessey was a big blow and the forwards found scores hard to come by. Trailing by four points at half time, Marlfield started the second half brightly and a scrappy goal by Paul Cahill brought them right back into the game. Unfortunately this was not built on and St. Pats put up a few scores, and were only denied a goal by a great save from Paudie Quinlivan. This was a good display from the side, given the conditions, and with a bit more work in training by all panel members we should should be more competitive in the championship.\n\n23/05/02 Benny O'Connell Appointed Captain\n\nAfter this evening's challenge game Bennedict O'Connell was appointed captain of the Junior hurling side by his fellow players. After thanking all for his selection Benny reminded the players that a full turn-out is required if we are to have any hope of success in the championship this year.\n\n22/05/02 Website Back On-Line\n\nApologies to all on the recent lack of information on the website. I have only just got it set up to allow me to directly put new information on the site. As of this week there should be new information on the site at least once a week. I would like to hear from anyone on the Juvenile comittee that has information on the current stages that the various teams are at.\n\n16/03/02 Clonmel Commercials Win Ian Moore Blitz\n\nA very successful football blitz was held on the lawn on Saturday.
