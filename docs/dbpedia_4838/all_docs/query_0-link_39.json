PATRICKS CEMETERY\n\nMass for those buried in St Patricks Cemetery will be celebrated outdoors – weather permitting – on Thursday 28th July at 7.30pm. The Cemetery Mass is an opportunity to pray for the repose of the souls of those buried in the cemetery. A Cemetery Mass and blessing of the graves is a unique community celebration and indeed a thanksgiving for those who have gone before us.\n\nPerhaps even more profoundly the Cemetery Mass is an intimate personal encounter with a loved one who has died. When we stand by the grave of a loved one we remember the day when we carried or followed the coffin into that space and it marks the spot where we said our last formal public goodbye. And yet while death is such a painful parting and experience of loss, the one thing that death cannot do is take away the love we shared with the one who has died.\n\nFor the blessing of the graves, you may wish to bring a small Holy Water bottle which will be blessed at the start of Mass, so you can bless the graves of your loved ones afterwards.\n\nFurther details will be given in the coming weeks.\n\nPadre Pio Weekend at Knock Shrine:\n\nSeptember 17th and 18th: This weekend is organised. Fr Bryan Shortall, OFM Cap., who will be the Master of Ceremonies. Ceremonies on Saturday in St. Johns Rest and Care Centre commence at 2pm and conclude with a Holy Hour at 7.30pm. This year the main celebrant and homilist on Sunday is His Excellency Cardinal Sean Brady.\n\nWe come in peace\n\nGod save all here is a traditional Irish blessing, spoken on entering someones home or arriving at a gathering. It was also used as a general greeting when entering a public house, and is often heard in films depicting life in early 20th century Ireland. Other variations traditionally spoken on crossing a threshold include God bless all here or God bless all in this house. While not in use as much these days, such greetings serve to set the tone for a visit. They indicate that the visitor has come in peace, with good wishes for all present  he or she bears no ill will to anyone.\n\nToday Jesus recommends a specific greeting for his disciples to use when entering a home: Peace to this house! Whatever house the disciples go into, this should be their greeting. Like the traditional Irish blessings, these words set a tone. Jesus explains that if a person of peace lives in that house, your peace will go and rest on him. The peace blessing offered by the disciples will spread to those they meet. Peace should be our number one consideration in our dealings with others. Tríona Doherty\n\nThought for the Day\n\nAngels around us, angels beside us, angels within us. Angels are watching over you when times are good or stressed. Their wings wrap gently around you, whispering you are loved and blessed.\n\nMasses this Weekend:\n\nSaturday 2nd July\n\n10:00am\n\n6:15pm John & Eileen Sullivan\n\nSunday 3rd July\n\n10:30am Alice Daly\n\nMary Healey\n\n12:00noon Patrick McGrath\n\nWelcome: We welcome into the Christian Faith Community of St. Mary’s, Conor Patrick Taylor, we congratulate his parents, Cathal and Orla, her godparents, grandparents and extended family.

Michael’s winning entry was: “We need to talk, text me.”\n\nInislounaght Celebrates: Last Friday evening, the residents of Inislounaght Estate celebrated their 40th “birthday” as an estate. In all there are 30 homes on the estate and of the present occupants 12 families have been their since it opened 40 years ago. There was a celebratory Mass at 5pm at which the Inislounaght Choristers sang. Refreshments followed. There was also a sports competition for the young children. It was great to see families who had lived on the estate but who had moved on to different areas returning for this occasion. Thanks to Ann-Marie Farrell and her committee who organised the whole event.\n\nArea Masses: Apropos of the success and goodwill generated by the Inislounaght experience, wouldn’t it be nice if other estates and community groups followed Inislounaght’s example. Area Masses are a great way of building up a sense of community spirit and cohesion in our area.\n\nWedding Bells: Congratulations to Matthew Ryan, Bianconi Drive and Beata Kudha, Wolfetone St & Poland who were married last Sunday in Borego, Poland. Congratulations also to Conor Hogan, Inislounaght and Fiona Hogan, Glenconnor who were married last Saturday in Marlfield.

This collection is used to finance various Diocesan ministries e.g. Accord, Cura, Cathechetical Development, Family Ministry Child Safeguarding Services, St John’s Pastoral Centre. There are huge demands on these services, and all are struggling to maintain their services. Your contribution guarantees the survival of these very necessary and important services and ministry in our Diocese. A certain amount of this collection also goes to the Vatican to support Church Services worldwide. This collection will be taken up at all Masses next weekend.\n\nParish Office: The Parish Office will be closed from Friday 29th July until Friday 12th August. If you have any notices or anniversaries for the Newsletter for those two weeks, please can you let Maria have them before Tuesday 26th July. Many thanks.\n\nYearly Boxes: To support your local Parish, your weekly contributions at the Offertory Collection are valued and appreciated. Because of dwindling numbers and financial constraints the Offertory Collection has been gradually decreasing. Perhaps you might be in a position to increase your contribution. Many living in the Parish, worship at other Churches, which is O.K. They might give a thought to making a contribution to St Mary’s Parish. They can do this by using the Yearly Box of Envelopes. If interested call Maria on 61 22773. Boxes are available at Parish Office in the Crying Room in Church. Maria is present 10am—11am Monday to Friday and at weekend Mass times. The future of St Mary’s depends on your loyalty and generosity.\n\nHolidays: The school children will be beginning their summer holidays next week. We wish them an enjoyable and safe holiday and look forward to meeting them again next September. D.V.\n\nMass for the Buried: Mass for those buried in St Patrick’s Cemetery will be celebrated outdoors, weather permitting, on Thurs 28th July at 7.30pm. It is an opportunity to pray for the repose of the souls of those buried in the cemetery and the blessing of the graves is a unique community celebration and indeed a ‘thanksgiving’ for those who have gone before us.

Forty-six-year-old Donnie Brown, who was travelling alone on his first holiday in Ireland, was attacked after stopping to ask a woman for directions back to his hostel. The gang held a knife to his throat and stole his wallet, bag, and phone, before leaving him lying bloodied in a lane. Donnie recalled how he had found help in a local shop and from Gardaí who drove him around the area in the hope of identifying his attackers. However, after his story was aired on the radio, he experienced a real outpouring of kindness. A bed and breakfast owner offered him free accommodation, and he received more than 40 offers of help from all over Ireland, including free use of a rental car. I feel like Ive won the lottery, he said afterwards. Its extraordinary that such a horrific experience could end with someone feeling so blessed. The man in todays parable must have felt something similar, to be treated with such generosity, from an unexpected source, after his ordeal. Those who helped Donnie in Dublin didnt know him or have any reason to help him. Their kindness to a stranger was very much in the spirit of the Good Samaritan we hear about today.\n\nTríona Doherty\n\nParish Newslink\n\nSs.

Its such a familiar story. Think of the last time you had friends or family over for a meal or a gathering. Were you more of a Mary or a Martha? Many of us fall more easily into one category than the other  the host with the most who is always up to their eyes with the cooking and catering and table clearing; or the chatterer who is happy to leave the washing up until later?\n\nAt face value, I dont think Jesus is saying we shouldnt be hospitable and look after our guests, offering them food or drinks. Like many, I really feel for Martha in this story. She had welcomed Jesus into her home, was looking after him and busying herself with serving him, while her sister was too busy listening to Jesus to offer to help. It is no wonder that Martha complained. After all, someone had to do the practical work. Martha may have wanted to spend time with her guest too  but then, who would have served him?\n\nThe key is in Jesuss words. He does not criticise Martha for her efforts, but rather gently rebukes her for worrying and fretting about so many things. She is so distracted and bogged down in her work that she has forgotten to spend time with Jesus. This is familiar territory for many of us. We are often distracted and busy. Do we make space to sit at the Lords feet and listen? Can we take time each day, perhaps, for a Scripture reading?\n\nTríona Doherty\n\nThe CARE Cancer Support Centre in Wellington Street, Clonmel will close for the summer break on\n\nFriday 29th July and re-open on Monday 22nd August.

Should we pray lying in bed or kneeling at the altar, alone or in company, in the church or out in nature, in stillness and silence or with tambourines and songs of praise? The first disciples werent quite sure how to go about things, and today we see them approach Jesus to ask him Lord, teach us to pray. In response, he gave them the words of what we now know as the Our Father. But he had some more advice for the disciples too  keep praying! If you were to call on a friend for help in the middle of the night, Jesus says, your persistence alone would convince him to help. If a child asks for food, his parents will naturally grant him what he asks for. The message is clear  we just have to keep asking. Jesus often withdrew to quiet places to spend time alone in prayer, and we know from the Passion accounts that he cried out to God in moments of anguish and desperation. There are many different ways to pray. It matters less where and how we choose to pray, than the fact that we choose to pray at all. If we keep asking, if we keep the lines of communication open, God will grant us what is good.\n\nTríona Doherty\n\nRiver Suir Patrol was launched by a Group of Volunteers last Saturday.\n\nIts aim is to recognise, respond to and possibly prevent situations where people may be thinking about self harming.\n\nFor Information Tel: 083 8635386 or e-mail riversuirpatrol@gmail.com\n\nEucharistic Adoration in St. Oliver’s Church Day Chapel on Mondays from 2pm– 8.00 pm.

Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nNext Monday the 15th August is the Feast of the Assumption of Our Lady and is a Holy Day of Obligation.\n\nMasses for both churches are as follows:\n\nChurch of the Resurrection: 9.30am\n\nSs Peter and Pauls: 1.00pm and 6.15pm\n\nWatching and Waiting\n\nWe do not like to wait. Listening to a radio discussion recently about the ever-increasing role technology plays in our lives, one panellist described how her smartphone had become almost like an extension of her arm. We dont know how to be alone or to have free time anymore, she lamented. If were waiting for a friend or family member, the slightest delay has us reaching for our phones to catch up on emails, social media or the latest news. Delayed flights, or food that doesnt arrive promptly in a restaurant, can make us impatient and jittery. We have lost the art of waiting.\n\nYet Jesus regularly emphasises the importance of waiting. But it is clear that it is not the sort of waiting where we can sit around scrolling through our phones  there is an art to it. We must be awake and dressed for action and have our lamps lit, ready to go. We must be ready to open the door to the master when he knocks.\n\nThe waiter described in todays Gospel is a devoted servant, eagerly awaiting his masters return. We dont know when Jesus will return, but we are called to live in constant vigilance and readiness. Let us not be found asleep on the job, or distracting ourselves with the trivial things in life! Tríona Doherty\n\nThe National Novena to Our Lady of Knock will take place from the 14th  22nd August. The theme for this year is Merciful like the Father in keeping with the Jubilee Year of Mercy. The Novena will open with Most Rev. Bishop Michael Smith. As part of the Jubilee celebrations of the 150th Anniv as custodians of the Mother of Perpetual Help, the Pilgrim Icon will make a visit to Knock Shrine as part of its annual Novena. The 15th August is a traditional pilgrimage day, with many pilgrims walking to Knock from far and wide as part of their annual ritual.
