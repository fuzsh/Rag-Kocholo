The first point around which they are building a case is the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon war. I really want to understand the Government's position. Like many others at the weekend, I almost fell back in astonishment when I looked at the news and saw in the Israeli ambassador, Dana Erlich, at the Famine commemoration in County Louth. This was an insult not only to the occasion but also to the 1 million Irish people who died and those who were forcefully exiled from our nation. The population has still not recovered from the latter. What happened at the weekend was an absolute abomination and I would like to know that happened. The Russian ambassador, correctly, was not there, but all the other ambassadors were. That was a political decision. Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain the basis for that decision. I understand we are about to recognise the state of Palestine, which is welcome, but surely we must go further. The time for doing so has long since passed.\n\nThe Taoiseach wrote a letter to Ursula von der Leyen highlighting issues with the EU-Israel trade agreement but he has yet to receive a response. Is he embarrassed that his candidates are out there saying that they will vote for her for the EU Commission? We have gone beyond the point of playing politics here; we need leadership.\n\nI wish to raise with the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip the lack of business being transacted this week. Where has the debate on the EU migration pact gone? Everyone knows that the European elections and local elections are due to take place. The pact was due back from committee in the first week of May and was supposed to have been disposed of by the House by 9 May, as we were told. It has just gone missing. We raised this matter at a Business Committee meeting last week. We have problems all over the country. There was a public meeting last night at the Pike in Rathcabbin to discuss St. Kieran's Nursing Home which had been given over for Ukrainians and is now being turned into an International Protection Accommodation Services centre. It is the same with the Heywood Road site in Clonmel, and what happened in Newtownmountkennedy and Doneraile in Cork. You name it. There has been trouble and violence in some of these places. I abhor violence from any source. We do not want that, but a vacuum has been created. This was voted through the EU and now the European Union Parliament members and candidates want it hidden until after the election. The Government also wants it hidden as well. Then we will be back and it will be pushed through. People are not fools. They are well copped on to the Government. Where is the EU migration pact? When will it back here for debate? How much time will we have to debate it? Will it be voted on segment by segment as opposed to all in one block?\n\nI thank the Chair. We are very much looking forward to debating it because of the position held by those Deputies who believe we can go it alone in a global migration crisis. It is a legitimate position for them to hold; it is just wrong. I look forward to debating it with the Deputies and explaining to them why we believe operating at EU level makes sense.\n\nWhen it comes to migration, accommodation is important. So, too, is the Government considering the levers at its disposal to move from an emergency response to a sustainable one.

The Government does intend to recognise the state of Palestine this month. We obviously hope to do so with some other countries. I am respectful of the different roles we have but the question of when it is best to schedule a debate will be in the hands of this House. It will be very important. To deal with Deputy Bacik’s comments on this, it is very important we set time aside in a way that this House views as appropriate.\n\nWith regard to the trade agreement, the Irish position is clear, but I am also very clear that it involves an EU competency, and it is not a consensus at European level.
