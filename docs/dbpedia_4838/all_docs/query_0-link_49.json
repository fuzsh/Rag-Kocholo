        "text": "The impact of the economic freeze caused by the Covid-19 lockdown has reached every sector, but during this time some good news came from promising young companies keen to change the world.\n\nEvery conceivable facet of the Irish business world has been impacted by Covid-19, from manufacturing and tourism to agribusiness and retail.\n\nOne of the largely untold or unrecognised areas where the impact is being severely felt is among young start-up companies who are particularly sensitive to economic shocks.\n\nWhen the lockdown began, it emerged that Irish start-ups had an average cashflow runway of between three and six months before they run out of cash due to the Covid-19 crisis, a survey by Scale Ireland had found.\n\nMany start-up enterprises in Ireland have less than 10 employees and have no revenues or profits.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19 on start-up and SME funding was immediate and Irish Venture Capital Association director-general Sarah-Jane Larkin warned how “Covid-19 will act like a hard frost which will wipe out the majority of Irish seed companies.”\n\nBut somehow in the midst of the Covid-19 lockdown some of the few good news stories actually came from Irish start-ups raising finance, creating new jobs, pivoting, investing or successfully exiting.\n\nWhile these are the exceptions rather than the rule, it is good to know that Ireland’s entrepreneurs are still powering ahead.\n\nHere are 24 young companies positioning themselves for a future beyond Covid-19.\n\nApisProtect\n\nIn May Cork start-up ApisProtect joined the Microsoft for Start-ups programme. This strategic partnership will allow ApisProtect to use Microsoft technologies to scale its business for the next two years.\n\nFounded by preeminent researchers at UCC in the use of sensors in beehives, ApisProtect provides real-time hive monitoring powered by intelligent sensor technology. ApisProtect gives beekeepers actionable insights and alerts to help prevent losses and increase colony productivity.\n\n“Our bee monitoring technology will enable beekeepers to manage their apiaries more effectively and focus on cultivating larger and stronger colonies,” said Dr Fiona Edwards Murphy, CEO and co-founder of ApisProtect. “We are delighted to be working with Microsoft as we scale our company globally over the next two years.”\n\nBuymie\n\nBuymie was founded in 2015 by Artavazd Sokhikyan and Devan Hughes (pictured) as a mobile app for on-demand groceries where customers can order goods and have them delivered within an hour.\n\nBuymie has created a platform using artificial intelligence (AI) technology, that enables consumers to access multiple large grocery retailers and receive short notice delivery to their chosen destination in as little as an hour. Currently, the Buymie service is available to more than 490,000 households across Dublin as well large towns in Kildare and Wicklow.\n\nIn May Buymie raised €2.2m from existing and new investors as well as entering into a multi-year partnership with Lidl Ireland. Consumers are also able to use their Buymie application to shop from Tesco in Ireland.\n\nThe same month it emerged that the business is expecting to hire 200 personal shoppers over the next six months – including 30 drivers – due to increased demand during Covid-19 restrictions. It has also expanded into the UK and has teamed-up with Co-op to offer same-day home grocery deliveries and full personal shopping services across Bristol as a first UK city deployment.\n\nBrightWind\n\nIn June renewable energy player BrightWind revealed plans to double its workforce by adding five new staff members in response to market needs.\n\nBrightWind was founded in 2015 by Shane Martin and Stephen Holleran.\n\nEarlier this year BrightWind secured over €160,000 in funding from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to develop a new cloud platform to help better understand Ireland’s wind and solar resource data, and to build an open-source analysis Python library to enable easy processing of such data.\n\nDeveire\n\nIn early March, just as the Covid-19 lockdown was about to be announced, it emerged that Deveire, a Limerick tech company is planning on creating 15 jobs with Dublin-level perks in Derry.\n\nSet up 10 years ago by Ollie Cahill and employing 55 people Deveire specialises in building web solutions for enterprises and large organisations looking to use the latest technologies for their digital presence.\n\nDeveire has delivered platforms that power the systems behind over 50 globally-renowned companies including Johnson & Johnson, Cisco, Walmart, Coca-Cola, Amazon and the Special Olympics.
