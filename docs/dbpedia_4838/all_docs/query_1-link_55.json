With the decommissioning of the old-style psychiatric hospitals, St. Lomanâs Hospital will no longer exist as we know it. The task, initially, appeared very daunting and insurmountable but, as research unfolded, it became a labour of love and we felt duty bound to chronicle and present the hospitalâs evolution to the present day. Sentimentality and nostalgia brought a mutually interested group together who endeavoured to bring this project to fruition. Our group consists of employees who have each dedicated their working life to the psychiatric service and have diligently over the past two years committed themselves to the task in hand. Due to the vast amount of archival material, spanning more than a century and a half, this is an overview of the history of St. Lomanâs Hospital through its time and existence. The language pertains to the era that our research and history covered. Our book is a passionate and sincere tribute and dedication to the memory of all staff, patients and their families who have been associated with St. Lomanâs Hospital, Mullingar.

The History of St. Lomanâs Hospital in Changing Times iv\n\nP:13\n\nIntroduction For many people in the Midlands over the years, St. Loman's Hospital will have provoked different perceptions and reactions. For many patients it will undoubtedly have been seen as a place of safety, comfort and refuge and sadly for some would have been a place to fear, resent or perhaps somewhere to avoid. There are few publications written about mental hospitals in Ireland and this is perhaps not surprising. Irish culture has, for many years, sought to disregard the issue of mental health and more particularly mental illness, with attitudes of fear, stigma and shame prevalent for many hundreds of thousands of sufferers and their families. Yet refuge was sought and provided in many institutions in the state, to such an extent that historical records demonstrate that Ireland had, at one stage, the highest rate of mental hospital beds in the world! Various theories are proposed for this dubious honour and it is generally accepted that the most relevant factors to this high rate of people held in mental hospitals included societal attitudes to mental illness, economic necessity and individuals with mental disorder having few alternative sources of help or assistance. Whatever the social and cultural interpretations of the reasons for the rise and fall of mental hospitals, what is often overlooked is the considerable effort to do the right things for patients. Staff in St. Loman's have always made valiant efforts to change the lives of those in their care for the better, which went far beyond what could be considered as âconventionalâ treatment. Numerous days and nights were devoted to fund raising, holding dances and other social events with the ultimate aim of improving the lives of patients, many of whom did not have the usual supportive family structures. I am a relative newcomer to St. Lomanâs Hospital, having started in 2000. What was clear to me at a very early stage was that, whilst the buildings and general accommodation for patients was of a poor standard, the care of patients was of a much higher standard. There was almost a surrogate quality to the interpersonal relationships between staff and in particular the older patients, many of whom had spent many decades in St. Lomanâs. Each knew each other 1\n\nP:14\n\nIntroduction so well and was well versed in getting the best out of each other! I truly met more âcharactersâ in my early years in St. Lomanâs Hospital than I had ever encountered in other hospitals. It is nice to see that some of those characters are referenced here in this book and Iâm sure most of them would have either a wry smile or a cutting remark about how they are fondly remembered by many staff. Thankfully, time doesn't stand still, and whilst many people believe that people dislike and resist change, even a cursory examination of the history of healthcare shows that mental health services have been in almost constant stages of change and especially so in the last three or four decades. Not just in Ireland, but in many countries, the role of the psychiatric hospital has been changing, with an emphasis on care in the community with the hospital being considered only where all alternatives had been considered. Planning for the Future (1984) set the template for the process of deinstitutionalisation whilst Vision for Change (2006) gives further guidance on the future direction for mental health service development in this country and the focus on community based care is central to mental health policy. As shown in the bed occupancy figures, there has been a significant decline in bed numbers in St. Lomanâs Hospital since the 1980âs. This was only possible by the introduction of community based services in all of the major towns in the counties of Longford and Westmeath. It required a considerable âleap of faithâ for many of those staff in the 1980âs, as they ventured from the hospital to work in local communities, with all the challenges and potential pitfalls that such a move entailed. The efforts of Community Mental Health Teams have made the necessary bed closures and service transformations possible, whilst at the same time providing more appropriate and acceptable care for people with mental health difficulties in the community. Those early teams, composed almost entirely of small numbers of nursing staff, have evolved into todayâs larger multi-disciplinary teams and these teams have expanded their clinical activity to include providing home-based care, support in out-patient and day care settings including day centres and day hospitals and staffing a network of supported housing facilities. This changed focus is supported by research, which tells us that people want to receive health services in their own home or their own communities as much as possible. 2\n\nP:15\n\nIntroduction Societal attitudes towards mental health are changing rapidly in Ireland. Gone are the days when people spoke in hushed terms about members of their communities who suffered mental disorder. It is commonplace for open discussions on mental health issues in the media and amongst people, in much the same manner as discussions on other health concerns such as heart disease or arthritis. The emergence from the dark days of stigma and shame may be ending but there is a long way to go before those old negative attitudes held by many, often based on fear and ignorance, are truly gone. The importance of the voice of service users is also recognised as is the voice of carers and families. Additionally, recognition that the quality of mental health services being delivered is as important as the quantity or location of services is a crucial change in attitude in society. The modern âlanguageâ of mental health care would be almost foreign to those who worked here beyond the last few decades. Phrases such as service user representation, multi-disciplinary team working, care planning, quality initiatives, aftercare arrangements and patient-centred care would be unheard of prior to the 1980âs. Staff in modern mental health services are increasingly aware that they can not and should not claim a monopoly on care. Caring is part and parcel of normal family life and we must continue to encourage an inclusive role for family members wherever possible. This means allowing those being cared for having a greater say on their care and more consultation with their families and the wider community on how care can be delivered. For those who have worked in St. Loman's Hospital, whatever their occupation, St. Lomanâs has represented a place of many different guises; workplace, a place of professional education, a place where lifelong friendships were made and a sense of having a bond with others who were associated with the hospital. If any such review of a workplace or institution can be criticised, it is often that we are inclined to remember the good old days and how people triumphed or survived in difficult circumstances. Thankfully, we are less inclined to look back with regrets of what could have been or how bad things were but rather to look forward with optimism to this new era of mental health care provision for our midland counties. For some people, this requires the same âleap of faithâ that others took when radical change was required. However, staff who are associated with St. Lomanâs Hospital have a justifiable pride in working in a service with a progressive tradition. 3\n\nP:16\n\nIntroduction This book, in recording the history of the hospital, also captures a small yet important part of the social history of Ireland and should not be underestimated. The authors and contributors have worked hard to bring to the fore the history and the experiences of the past. I would like to extend my congratulations to all those who contributed to this very successful record, which will undoubtedly be a success because of their efforts, time consuming research and dedication to the task they undertook. I am sure that many readers, whatever their motivation for interest in St. Lomanâs Hospital, will enjoy the portrayal of St. Lomanâs Hospital as an important microcosm of a changing Ireland. For those who have had the pleasure of working in St. Lomanâs Hospital, this book will hopefully be a reminder that whatever the fate of the actual building, St. Lomanâs was always more than a collection of buildings. It was a place for laughter, hard work, good times, friendship and belonging. This will hopefully remain in place for many years to come, even in the absence of bricks and mortar. Anthony Coyne Director of Nursing July 2014 4\n\nP:17\n\nForeword St Lomanâs Hospital began as an asylum, that is an asylum in the proper sense of this word, a place of refuge, of safety and retreat from the trauma and harshness of the world. When we remember that the hospital opened less than a decade after the Great Famine we can only imagine the distress and hurt it witnessed and how it sought to restore stability and calm to a broken people. The Hospital has played a central role in the life of Mullingar with sporting and cultural links, providing education and employment and serving the people of Counties Westmeath, Longford and Meath. Designed by JS Mulvany, as the Mullingar District Lunatic Asylum the main building was built to accommodate 300 patients, which quickly proved to be insufficient in size. In 1904 all of the mental hospitals in Ireland were valued for rates and the Mullingar Mental Hospital was considered to be one of the most valuable sites at the start of the 20th century. Its lands at that time were valued at Â£176,862 revealing the vital role that farming played in the life of the hospital. Throughout turbulent times in Irish life, the hospital remained steadfast and constant and attempted to insulate vulnerable people from the great social and economic changes happening in the new State. St Lomanâs played a vital role within its community and this book gives us a glimpse into life at the hospital. Vibrant memories of life in this unique environment are authentically recreated and retold in this book. In Irelandâs first example of Peer Advocacy, Hanna Greally gave the world an insight into life within âthe Big Houseâ. Her story was simple and poetic yet stark in its honesty. Through her courage, Hanna played a major role in finding a better way to support people with a mental illness in Ireland. The modern service has brought forward the values of compassion, sensitivity and respect from St Lomanâs and these values are the hallmark of the modern service and a testament to its history. 5\n\nP:18\n\nForeword The pride and care taken by the authors shows their deep affection for the hospital and its history and their wish to see St Lomanâs being remembered and honoured. The view is not a romanticised perspective but one which retells the story of so many lives touched by mental illness and trauma. Both current and retired staff members must be congratulated for their dedicated work in cataloguing artefacts and faithfully collecting stories from the past. Since its opening, St Lomanâs Hospital has served the people of the midlands with pride and distinction. This Hospital provided a sanctuary and refuge for people at a vulnerable time in their lives, across its long history, St Lomanâs offered shelter, kindness and compassion. The Longford Westmeath Mental Health Services have embraced modern service models, have reduced their clientsâ dependence on hospitalisation by providing a wide range of community based interventions. The story continues. Martin Rogan Assistant National Director for Mental Health July 2014 6\n\nP:19\n\nSt. Lomman of Lough Owel St. Lomman was a cousin of St. Colmcille and St. Colman of Lynn and he was born on the western side of Lough Owel about 600 A.D. He became a priest and founded a monastery, Teampal Lomman, on a site given by his father on the very brink of the lake. His memory is still lovingly treasured in his native district and tradition tells many stories which illustrate his gentleness and asceticism; his charity to the poor and his fondness for birds and animals, but above all his burning love for God and his tender devotion to Mary, the Mother of the Lord. Tradition says that St. Lomman died soon after the Great Drought which happened according to the Annalists about 680 A.D. Two of the traditional stories about him are: âthere was a terrible disease in Ireland and when it spread to this part of the country the people were afraid for their lives and they went to St. Lomman and asked him to save them. So Lomman yoked up his plough and he ploughed a furrow all around the parish of Teampal Lomman and none within the furrow died of the plague nor any plague thereafter. Ever since Lomman did that nobody in the parish begins ploughing till after the 7th of February which is Lommanâs feast day.â There was a very old donkey in Teampal Lomman which Lomman had for a long time. He was very fond of him and the donkey used to follow Lomman around, and sometimes he would give him titbits out of his pocket. Now the monk who was in charge of the barn thought it was a great waste of food to be feeding an animal that was long past his labour and he wanted to have the donkey destroyed. Lomman however would not have it so, because said he âwhen Our Lord made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, it was the donkey He chose to ride. The donkey said Lomman is an honourable animalâ. Lommanâs Pattern was held on the first Sunday in August. 7\n\nP:20\n\nBackground The earliest records show care for the sick was provided in religious monasteries with the advent of Christianity. Many of these monasteries had associated hostels and hospitals, and placed emphasis on caring for the sick and impoverished. With the reformation and the suppression of monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547) this hospital care system, such as it was, came to an end and as a result provision for the sick and the destitute largely disappeared, leaving the country virtually with no hospital system for two hundred years. At the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century the sad state of the sick in Dublin came to the attention of more fortunate wealthy citizens who came together to establish voluntary hospitals. The city saw the establishment of major medical and custodial institutions. In 1684 the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, opened to care for the military pensioners. In 1711 an asylum was built attached to the infirmary. On his death, in 1710, a Dublin medical practitioner willed his property to his sister and thereafter to provide a hospital for the sick poor of the city. This man was Dr. Richard Steevens. His sister Grizel administered his will and supervised the hospital construction. Dr. Steevensâ Hospital received its first patients in 1733. It is now the administrative centre of the Health Service Executive. In 1718 a house was opened in Cook Street by six surgeons for the maimed and poor called the Charitable Infirmary. It later moved to Kings Inn Quay and finally to the former mansion of the Earl of Charlemont at 14 Jervis Street and became Jervis Street Hospital. This was followed by Mercerâs in 1734, the Hospital of Rotunda in 1745 and the Meath in 1757. Other hospitals followed. Treatment for the sick in these hospitals was combined with clinical instruction by the three medical schools in Dublin - the College of Surgeons, the College of Physicians and Trinity College. The first religious controlled hospital was St. Vincentâs. 8\n\nP:21\n\nBackground Special hospitals were also established in this period and among the earliest, in 1747, St. Patrickâs Hospital for the insane, founded by Jonathon Swift (1667- 1745), came to fruition. He was the Dean of St. Patrickâs, author, satirist and one of the leading figures in the political and literary world of his day, whose works survive among English Literature. He was a remarkable man whose life was to end in the dim shadows of insanity. The hospital was built on grounds adjoining Dr. Steevens and was the first, and for many years the only one in the country specially devoted to the care of mentally afflicted. The hospital still exists. It has been enlarged and modernised and now functions as a private psychiatric hospital. Outside Dublin, voluntary hospitals were also founded including the North and South Infirmaries in Cork and St. Johnâs and Barringtons in Limerick. The rural poor in provincial areas had to be content with limited service in county infirmaries and fever hospitals. County infirmaries were established following the passing of the County Infirmaries Act in 1765 by the Irish Parliament (Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland). Many people were also treated by the local dispensary doctors. The population of Ireland was difficult to ascertain in medieval times but by 1700 it was established to be 2 million. By 1720 it had risen to 3 million and peaked at an estimated 8.1 million in 1841 in the four provinces. 9\n\nP:22\n\nBackground While the Industrial Revolution brought new opportunities for people in England, life in Ireland was characterised by overpopulation on small landholdings, social disorder and a stagnant economy. The vast majority of the population lived in rural areas, in poor conditions, where poverty and disease were common problems. The Elizabethan poor law system in England was not extended to Ireland and the Irish parliament at that time was considered unsympathetic to the plight of the poor and the afflicted. Houses of Industry were to be built in every county under legislation enacted in 1771/1772. Only five were built; Dublin 1773, Limerick 1774, Ennis 1775, Maryborough 1775 and Waterford 1779. It was not until 1838 that an Irish Poor Law Act, based on the English Act of 1834, attempted to deal with widespread poverty in Ireland. The poor were to be given food and shelter in exchange for work. It was based on a system of indoor relief and was financed by a tax on land. The workhouse system was the largest building project ever to take place in Ireland and was reputed to have cost 1 million pounds. They were built to cater for 1% of the population but numbers peaked at 217,000 or 4% of the population by 1851. The Prisons Act (1787) established lunatic wards in the Houses of Industry where wards and cells were provided in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. Accommodation was provided for âsturdy beggars, vagabonds and deserving poorâ. William Tuke (1732-1822) was born into a leading Quaker family of tea and coffee merchants in York. He combined commercial acumen with philanthropic works. Following a visit to a friend, who later died in the York asylum, he felt it necessary to appeal to the Society of Friends and received sufficient funds to establish the York Retreat for the care of the insane. He pioneered a humane and caring approach which was to become a model for care around the world. Unknown to Tuke, Philippe Pinel (1745-1826), the French physician, was advocating a similar approach. He was noted for his observation of and humane approach to the care of the mentally ill. This concept became known as moral treatment. Pinel wrote extensively on the classification of mental illness during his time at Hospital BicÃªtre and SalpÃªtriÃ¨re in Paris. He is described by many as âthe father of modern psychiatryâ. His more clinical approach was to 10\n\nP:23\n\nBackground become the worldwide model for the care of the mentally ill. It was in this atmosphere that a new ethos for the care of the insane in Ireland developed. Robert Peel (1778-1850) became Chief Secretary in Dublin from 1813-1818. Having revised the system of public administration he established a select committee in 1817 which led to new legislation to establish district asylums. The momentum for reform was assisted by Sir John Newport (1756-1843), MP for Waterford from 1803. He also campaigned for catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform in Ireland. Much of the credit for advancing provision of care for the Irish insane is given to Mr. Thomas Spring Rice (1795-1866). Elected MP for Limerick in 1820 he fought for the worldwide abolition of slavery and the introduction of state funded education. In the roles as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department and Chancellor of the Exchequer he strongly supported improvements in the system of asylum care. In 1804 the building of four provincial asylums in Ireland was recommended to Government, by a Select Committee of the House of Commons, each to have capacity of 250 beds. Only one, the Richmond in Dublin (1815) was built as a result. In 1810 the Governors of the Dublin Houses of Industry applied to Government for funding to construct facilities to cater for the growing demand from lunatics from all over Ireland, as well as in their own facility. 46 cells were available which was insufficient to deal with demand. Â£2,000 was provided to purchase land to build a 250-bed facility, named the Richmond Lunatic Asylum to cater for curable lunatics from all over Ireland. The Richmond was the first and largest public hospital, (the oldest asylum being St. Patrickâs Private asylum opened in c. 1745 to care for âfee paying and pauper inmatesâ). The first patients admitted to the Richmond came from the Dublin House of Industry and at its peak it catered for over 2,000 patients. In 1831 it was incorporated into the district asylum system. Private asylums charged patients or their families for care, so mainly catered for the wealthy, while mixed asylums were funded by patient fees and voluntary contributions. 11\n\nP:24\n\nBackground In 1817 and 1821 the Government introduced legislation to set up asylums for the lunatic poor in Ireland. The problem of mental illness in Ireland was finally recognised and the Government needed to respond. The Legislation did not provide funding for local authorities to build asylums in their areas and by 1831 only five had been completed â Armagh, Belfast, Derry, Limerick and Dublin. Later funding was provided and a series of asylum building commenced â Ballinasloe, Carlow, Clonmel, Maryborough (Portlaoise), Waterford, with extensions to the Richmond. Following meetings of a House of Commons Select Committee in 1843, another phase of asylum building commenced. These new asylums were designed by private architects and included: â¢ Killarney, 1852 by Sir Thomas Deane; â¢ Kilkenny, 1853 by George Papworth; â¢ Sligo, 1855 by William Deane Butler; â¢ Mullingar, 1855 by John Skipton Mulvany. They would be influenced by recent British practice for long buildings to maximise ventilation and a southerly aspect to increase light. They were sited on the outskirts of towns, falling ground and a view, as in Enniscorthy and Cork, was considered an advantage. The brief stipulated that Classical architecture would be replaced by Tudor and Gothic designs, three stories rather than two and wards would replace individual cells. Further legislation enacted in 1845 provided for a criminal asylum in Dundrum and a 500-bed facility in Cork (1850). The ten district asylums now in existence provide care for 1,300 patients. By 1870 there was a growing demand in society for care of non-pauper mentally ill people so paying patients were admitted into district asylums. Very few availed of this opportunity, with only 3% of patients in public facilities in 1890 paying a fee. The District Asylum was usually not considered by the families of the wealthy, due to the stigma of having a relative in an asylum built for the pauper poor. Catholics would have been more likely to be admitted into the district system while Protestants more likely to be admitted to private or mixed institutions. 12\n\nP:25\n\nBackground By 1900 all asylums had been built, with the exception of Ardee which was opened in 1933. So, one hundred years after Government started dealing with the problem of mental illness, around 16,000 people (.5% of total population) were housed in district asylums, with a small number still in workhouses and 300 in private institutions. Mullingar District Asylum (St. Lomanâs Hospital, Mullingar) At a meeting of the Privy Council of Ireland, a decision was taken to erect an asylum for a new district consisting of counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford. It was intended that this institution would relieve serious overcrowding in the jails of the midland towns which resulted from social unrest following the famine. On the 13th September 1847, the Lord Lieutenant and Council of Ireland made an order that an Asylum for Lunatic Poor be erected near Mullingar. The building would accommodate 300 inmates and be named Mullingar Lunatic Asylum. It was estimated that the building would be completed for Â£24,203. The design brief stated that the building must be built to a Tudor Gothic style and was designed by John Skipton Mulvany. In 1848, twenty five acres and nine perches of land were purchased from a Mr. Thomas Tuite at a cost of Â£829. Mr. Tuite still retained one hundred and ninety four acres of land at Petitswood. The main building was completed in 1855 by Mr. John Smith at a final cost of Â£35,430. The asylum land had a total annual rateable valuation of Â£320, for which an exemption was granted in line with all other municipal buildings in Mullingar. 13\n\nP:26\n\nArchitecture The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage of Ireland describes the building as a âmonumental and well detailed Victorian institutional building, built in an institutional Gothic style with extensive Tudor Gothic detailing which retains its imposing early form and original character. The numerous symmetrically arranged gable fronted projections and the canted bays help to alleviate the enormous bulk and scale of the building lending variety and interest to the front. The tall Tudor chimney stacks and numerous gables create an interesting rooflineâ. The building design differs somewhat from other Mulvany designs and appears to have been influenced by the work of Augustus Pugin at St. Patrickâs College in Maynooth (1845-1851). Allegations of extravagance in relation to decorative features of some new asylums led to an investigation by a group of Treasury Commissioners at the end of 1855. In relation to Mullingar these allegations included overuse of architectural ornamentation, the projecting dayrooms and Tudor-style chimney stacks. The high quality limestone which was âdrawn by cart from 20 miles distantâ to Mullingar also added to the cost overrun. The investigating Commissioners reported that the buildings were âpleasing in style and built in a manner highly creditable to the architects engaged and ornamental to the countryâ. They conceded that there may have been too much embellishment in Cork, Killarney, Sligo and Mullingar but they found in favour of the asylum governors who had rejected the more prison-like features of earlier asylums and workhouses. 14\n\nP:27\n\nArchitecture The Early Architects John Skipton Mulvany (1813â1870) John Skipton Mulvany was born in 1813, son of Thomas and Mary (nee Field). His father was a noted landscape and figure painter, friend and biographer of James Gandon (architect of the Custom House, The Four Courts and Bank of Ireland, College Green in Dublin). He was also keeper of the house of the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It has been written that John was âtaken in hand by some of the first nobility and commercial men in Dublinâ and on account of his fatherâs position and connections helped him establish in private practice as an architect and receive commissions to design many of Irelandâs finest buildings including Broadstone Station and the Royal St. George John Skipton Mulvany (1813â1870). Yacht Club in Dun Laoghaire. Later while employed by the Midland Great Western Rail Co. he is credited with designs of Killucan, Mullingar, Athlone and Galway Rail stations as well as the Great Southern Hotel in Galway. Local private commissions include Gigginstown House, Ballinagore House and the Quaker Meeting House in Clara. He is described as âone of the most extensively employed practitioners in Irelandâ. He died in 1870, aged 57 years, after a short illness and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. 15\n\nP:28\n\nArchitecture George Wilkinson (1814â1891) An English architect, George Wilkinson, born in Oxfordshire and having designed twenty workhouses in England, was appointed to the Poor Law Commissioners in Ireland in January 1839, with a brief to plan and oversee the development of Irish workhouses. He was allocated one assistant and a clerk. The first workhouse was completed in Cork in 1840 and many others followed around the country without delay, 112 being finished by 1843, with the total of 130 completed by 1847. The failure of the potato crop and onset of the George Wilkinson (1814â1891). Great Famine saw an urgent need for more workhouse accommodation. Between 1849 and 1853 the existing number was increased by 30, with fever hospitals added to many. He retired his post on 18th September 1855 and wrote extensively. He also designed railway stations in Multyfarnham, Co. Westmeath for the Midland Great Western Company in 1855 and Harcourt Street, Dublin in 1858/59 for the Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Company. George Wilkinson again entered public service in August 1860 as architect to the Commissioners of Asylums. He also designed asylums in Castlebar and Letterkenny. 16\n\nP:29\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Resident Medical Superintendents The hospital opened for reception of its first patients on the 23rd August 1855, with Dr. Henry Berkeley as Resident Medical Superintendent. He was appointed on the 10th May 1852 to oversee the development of the asylum. He had previously practised in Northumberland, England. Three visiting physicians are recorded as attending the hospital: Dr. Joseph Ferguson, Dr. Stokes and Dr. W.H. Middleton. Following Dr. Berkeleyâs retirement in 1881, he was succeeded by Dr. G.W. Hatchell, son of Dr. George Hatchell who served as Inspector. He transferred to Castlebar Asylum in February 1882 where he was later appointed as R.M.S. Dr. Jameson Dwyer held the position from April 1882 until August 1886, when he transferred to the Asylum in Cork. Dr. Arthur Finegan was appointed to the position in September 1886 and served until May 1911. Dr. Arthur Finegan 17\n\nP:30\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Dr. W.S.

Dr. John Fitzgerald 18\n\nP:31\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Dr. P.F. OâBrien â July 1959 to September 1980 was the last R.M.S. who was obliged to live in the hospital and relocated to private accommodation before his retirement. Dr. OâBrien qualified in U.C.D. in 1939 and spent the war years as a Captain in the Army Medical Corps. On leaving the Army he took the post of Medical Director, St. John of Godâs Hospital, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin. In the early 1950âs he worked in psychiatry in England and returned to Ireland to take a permanent post in the Mental Health Service in St. Brigidâs Hospital, Ballinasloe. From there he was Dr. P.F. OâBrien seconded as Resident Medical Superintendent (R.M.S.) to St. Patrickâs Hospital, Castlerea. In 1959 he was appointed R.M.S. to Mullingar Psychiatric Hospital. He set about re-organising the hospital internally by opening the doors and greatly expanding occupational and recreational departments and setting up a large Industrial Therapy Unit for the rehabilitation of patients. He also developed a patientsâ Social Club and, with the help of the County Librarian, organised an internal Library Service for patients. He expanded out-patient clinic services very widely throughout the three counties of Westmeath, Longford and Meath. In addition he played a large part in establishing the local Mental Health Association and spread this association to other centres in the hospitalâs catchment area. His interest and enthusiasm in this field led to his being appointed Chairman of the Mental Health Association of Ireland. His exceptional attributes of organisational ability, easy relationship with his colleagues at all levels and his personal empathy for, and genuine interest in, patientâs welfare made him an outstanding Psychiatrist and Administrator. 19\n\nP:32\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors The post of R.M.S. was converted to Chief Psychiatrist and later Clinical Director. Consultants who held the position included: Dr. Brendan Perry Dr. George Coghlan Dr. Oliver Leavy Dr. Mary OâHanlon Current Clinical Director 20\n\nP:33\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Medico-Psychological Association (M.P.A.) The M.P.A. evolved from the Association of Medical Officers of Asylums and Hospitals for the Insane. Their first meeting was held at the Gloucester Asylum in 1841. By 1855 the Association was publishing the âAsylum Journal of Mental Scienceâ, becoming the âJournal of Mental Scienceâ after 1858 and the âBritish Journal of Psychiatryâ in 1963. By 1865 the Association included twelve Irish members. Dr. Eleanora Fleury was elected the first Irish female member in 1895 with the support of Dr. Connolly Norman, R.M.S. Richmond Hospital. Regular meetings of the Irish branch were held, as captured in the photo below taken in Mullingar on 27th October 1892.

Front â L to R: Dr. Eustace (Highfield), Dr. West (Omagh), Dr. Garner (Clonmel), Dr. Nash (Richmond). 21\n\nP:34\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors The Irish Branch maintained its affiliation to the M.P.A. following the granting of a Royal Charter in 1926 and was renamed the Royal Medico-Psychological Association (R.M.P.A.). In 2002 an independent Irish College of Psychiatrists was formed which included members from Northern Ireland. Governors From the earliest years District Asylums were administered by Boards of Governors, appointed by the Lord Lieutenant. Many were local Members of Parliament, Deputy Lieutenants or held other high public office. Most were Protestants, the few Catholics drawn from the landed gentry and often included the local Catholic Bishop. Two Governors inspected the Asylum, including the farm, each month and reported to the full Board at their monthly meeting. They were responsible for the financial control of the institution and sanctioned admissions and discharges. They appointed staff, including the Visiting Physician and all subordinate positions within the hospital. The appointment of R.M.S., Manager and, for a time, Matron was retained by the Lord Lieutenant. The Right Rev. Dr. Cantwell, (Bishop Dr. Francis White.

Mercer Library. from 1830 â 1866) 22\n\nP:35\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors The first Board of Governors meeting, following the opening of the hospital, was held on the 27th August 1855. Governors present were Right Rev. Dr. Cantwell (Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath) in the chair, Hugh M. Tuite, J.C. Lyons (1792-1874) of Lediston, Philip OâReilly and Fredrick Jessop esqrs. Also present were Dr. F. White, Inspector of Asylums, Dr. Berkeley R.M.S. and Dr. Joseph Ferguson, Visiting Physician. Over the years many other Governors were appointed, including: The Earl of Longford (Lord-Lieutenant of County Longford), Lord Greville MP for Westmeath 1865-1874, William Pollard Urquhart MP (High Sheriff of Westmeath), the Rev. Essex Edgeworth (Rector of Edgeworthstown), Colonel Caulfield (of Bloomfield House), Dr. Charles Reichel (Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath, appointed 1885) and the Rt. Rev. Bishop McCabe. Inspectors The Asylum system was governed by a Board of Control and had a permanent office, clerical services and two full time inspectors based at Dublin Castle. In 1843 Dr. Francis White testified before a committee investigating the lunatic poor in Ireland. He was surgeon to the Richmond Asylum, having studied at Dr. Steevens and St. Patrickâs Hospitals. This may account for his interest in the treatment of the mentally ill. Having been appointed Inspector of Prisons with responsibility for asylums he was the driving force to reform their management. He drew up new rules governing District Asylums and in 1846 he succeeded in having a separate Lunacy Inspectorate established, with himself as first Inspector. With his medical background he was anxious to see doctors taking a more active role in the management of asylums rather than lay managers. By 1853 nine of the fourteen asylums were controlled by doctors and in 1859 only one lay manager remained â Captain John Dobbs of Waterford. Dr. White was joined by Dr. John Nugent who was previously Travelling Physician to Daniel OâConnell. Drs. White and Nugent were considered to have had a successful relationship, closing old and opening many new asylums. Dr White retired in 1857, 23\n\nP:36\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors following injuries sustained in a rail accident on the Kilkenny to Waterford line. He died in 1859. He was succeeded by Dr. George Hatchell, who joined Dr. Nugent, now the Senior Inspector. While not without some controversy, their years together were considered fruitful and both men are credited with being responsible for the birth of the Irish Psychiatric Profession. Dr. Hatchell died in 1889 and Dr. Nugent retired after 43 years of public service with a knighthood. In 1891 the Lord Lieutenant appointed a Commission to investigate asylums countrywide. This four man committee included the two new Inspectors of Lunacy, Dr. George Plunkett OâFarrell and Dr. E. Maziere Courtenay. OâFarrell had been an inspector of the Local Government Board, while Courtenay was previously R.M.S. in the Limerick Asylum and founding member of the Irish branch of the Medico-Psychological Association. The First Inspectorâs Report on Mullingar Asylum The first recorded Inspectorâs Report, of the 11th March 1856, following the visit of Drs. White and Nugent, who reported thus: âI have this day minutely inspected the various departments at the Mullingar Asylum and it affords me great pleasure to report in a very favourable manner of them, the house is remarkably clean and orderly, both the male and female division. The non- restraint principle is carried out to the fullest extent and with the happiest results, since the period of my last visit considerable improvements have been effected in the grounds attached to the institution which appear to me to be very judiciously laid out. The sanitary condition of the patients is good and the visiting and resident Physician with the Matron bestows every attention to the establishment generally. Signed, John Nugent.â 24\n\nP:37\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Since 1924 five people are recorded as Inspectors of Mental Hospitals: 1924â1937 Mr. Daniel L. Kelly. 1938â1939 Mr. R. P. McDonnell. 1939â1950 Dr. Joseph Kearney. 1952â1979 Dr. Vincent J. Dolphin. 1988â2001 Dr. Dermot Walsh. There were no reports filed for the years 1962â1977 and 1980â1987. A new Inspectorate was established with the passing of the Mental Health Act, 2001. Dr. Teresa Carey was appointed as Inspector of Mental Health Services, the first time that a female held this post since the position was established in 1846. 25\n\nP:38\n\nR.M.S.âs, Governors and Inspectors Photos from Mullingar District Asylum 26\n\nP:39\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan 1854-1952 As per Dr. Arthur Fineganâs request in his last will and testament, read on the 8th day of May 1953: âI desire that my body shall be interred in the grave of my late wife, Eleanor, in the enclosed plot in the private cemetery of the Mullingar District Mental Hospital, Co. Westmeath in Eire and that the Roman Catholic priest, who administers at my funeral, shall be paid two guineas for his professional services and I also desire that my said funeral shall be conducted in as simple a manner as possible. I also desire that my name and position, as Medical Superintendent of the said Mullingar District Mental Hospital from the year 1886-1912 shall be inscribed on the monument which has been erected over the said grave.â The above words, in his last will and testament, indicate very explicitly the regard which this, very innovative and progressive man held for St. Lomanâs Hospital and in particular his affinity with the patients of the hospital. Dr. Finegan attended Tullabeg College, which later amalgamated with Clongowes Wood College. The record shows that Arthur Daniel OâConnell Finegan registered in medicine on April 13th 1877, having passed âbrilliantlyâ the various examinations. As a practicing doctor he went to France for further study, in which country he procured qualification in surgery. He practiced in England and became connected with institutions for the treatment of mental disease. He came back to his own country in the early 1880âs and was appointed as R.M.S. in what was then known as Castlebar Lunatic Asylum. Later in 1886, he transferred to a similar facility in Mullingar. Appointments in those days, were made by the then Lord Lieutenant. Dr. Finegan was one of the earliest pioneers in treating mental ailment, âas a disease which like most others was capable of improvement and even of cureâ. A very significant display of Dr. Fineganâs innovation was when he appointed the first female doctor at Mullingar Asylum â Dr. Elizabeth Moffatt. 27\n\nP:40\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan As the report in 1895 states âDr. Finegan suggested the strengthening of the medical staff and, after mature deliberation, a medical woman for the post of a junior assistant medical officer was employedâ. The then Inspector of Lunatic Asylums stated âin creating this appointment, you prudently followed the example set by some of the best managed asylums in the kingdomâ. Dr. Moffatt worked at the asylum until 1897 when she secured a position in London. However, she didnât forget Dr. Finegan and on his death wrote in glowing terms of her experience working under his leadership, demonstrating that, while 55 years had elapsed, Arthur Fineganâs attributes were still recognised. Dr. Finegan is the young man on the right in the front row with his brothers and sisters. Dr. Finegan was considered the âdoyenâ of Irish psychiatry. His opinion was always valued by his peers and he contributed very significant articles to the Journal of Mental Science regularly. Two such examples were: Systematic Dress Fitting for Female Inmates of Asylums in April 1883 and Tuberculosis Disease and its Treatment in Irish Asylums â April 1895. It was also noted that Dr. Finegan had originated the clinical meetings of the Medico-Psychological Association in Ireland. 28\n\nP:41\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan He was a powerful advocate for both staff and patients. It was recognised by the then Inspector of District Asylums, George Plunkett OâFarrell in 1893 that âthe patients in the Asylum enjoy many instances and amount of individual liberty which reflects the greatest credit, in my opinion, on the humanity and courage of the Resident Medical Superintendent, Dr. Arthur Finegan, in carrying out enlightened and advanced treatmentâ. Others would have recognised that he practiced occupational therapy, before it was even given a name. âThere are many parts in the administration of Mullingar Asylum which extort official praise but its best and most distinctive feature is perhaps the treatment and training of the staff, whom Dr. Finegan regards as his assistants in a mission of humanity, to surround them with all the ordinary comforts of civilised life. On the other hand the kind and humane treatment which they receive, doubtless tends to lend the attendants to accord a like measure of sympathy and kindness to the suffering poor for whose care they are responsible. One result is that the difficulty of retaining them for any length of time, so often experienced in other asylums, is not felt in Mullingar. It has been truly said that without efficient attendants, the very best Superintendent is powerless to effect improvementsâ (1895). Dr. Arthur Finegan with his grandniece and companion Delia Bagnell, daughter of Elizabeth Bagnell, his niece and housekeeper in 1911. 29\n\nP:42\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan During his time as R.M.S. in Mullingar District Asylum he met and worked alongside Eleanor Hobson, who had been Matron in the hospital from 1882- 1897. She subsequently resigned her position and pursued a career in medicine. Mostly influenced by Arthur she attended Trinity College. Having relinquished her nursing career in pursuit of a medical career she married Arthur in 1898. Sadly Eleanor died 10 years into their marriage in November 1908 and was interred in the District Asylum graveyard, where 44 years later Arthur was reunited in the same plot alongside his beloved Eleanor. In testament to his devotion and admiration of Eleanor, Arthur requested that a bursary be administered to be called the âEleanor Finegan Prizeâ, it was to be awarded to the nursing student who achieved highest marks in the hospital examination. In setting up this award, Arthur demonstrated his undying devotion to Eleanor and his encouragement and recognition to the future of mental nursing. The trust was set up in 1913 to the value of Â£5 and ceased to exist when St. Lomanâs School of Nursing was decommissioned. Retiring from Mullingar Asylum in 1912 his successor, Dr. Gavin, stated: âI desire to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the great services rendered to this institution and to the cause of the insane generally by my predecessor, Dr. Finegan. During the twenty five years that Dr. Finegan was Resident Medical Superintendent, great reforms were brought about in the management of asylums, as a result of which the unhappy lot of the mentally inflicted has been markedly ameliorated, and, in the initiating of these changes and improvements, Dr. Finegan was one of the leading pioneers. The benefits conferred on the Mullingar District Asylum by his zeal and ability are numerous and lasting. Amongst the many improvements introduced by Dr. Finegan, I may mention the installation of an up-to-date sanitary system and the acquiring of the extensive asylum farm, which affords congenial and healthy occupation for large numbers of our patients, as well as providing for the institution a plentiful supply of fresh milk, vegetables and other commodities. Dr. Finegan, in all his work, was actuated by ideals of humanity and kindness and it is satisfactory for his successor to observe that Dr. Finegan has been very successful in instilling these ideals into the staff who worked for many years under him.â 30\n\nP:43\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan Following his retirement, he went to London where he had an association with Battersea Hospital, prior to the commencement of the First World War. In 1915 he was employed by the War Office and subsequent to that he worked as Resident Medical Superintendent (R.M.S.) at a lunatic asylum on the Isle of Man. In 1919 he took a position as a ships surgeon, which he held until 1922. Between 1922 and 1939 he travelled extensively. Family records show he travelled to America via Panama in 1930. He owned Dr. Arthur Finegan at sea as a Shipâs Doctor between some property in California, 1919 and 1922. where he grew avocados, as he was a keen gardener. He also travelled to the south of France and the Soviet Union, other visits to Russia being made during the Czarist regime. In 1939 he lived with his grand-niece close to Regents Park in London. When the bombing raids began in 1940 Arthur was in his late 80âs and his grand-niece felt it would be desirable to go to family in Drogheda, where he learned to ride a bicycle and regularly cycled 3 - 4 miles to the gardens of Queensboro Cottage. He returned to London after the war. Unfortunately he met with an accident in the London fog in 1949 and as a result suffered a broken hip. In the Spring of 1950 he wrote to the then R.M.S. of the Mullingar Mental Hospital, Dr. Fitzgerald, and requested that he could return to his old hospital as a voluntary patient. 31\n\nP:44\n\nDr. Arthur Finegan His request was gladly complied with and for more than a year and a half he received great care from the medical and nursing staff. Arthur was visited frequently by the few old friends who still remained. His mental capacity was undiminished and he became a reliable authority regarding the hospital and indeed of affairs of the county. Arthur died in his 98th year in February 1952. .

OâConnor, chaplain, Arthur Finegan was laid to rest alongside Eleanor in the hospital graveyard. 32\n\nP:45\n\nDevelopments Following the opening of the building in 1855 general upkeep, maintenance and improvements were of primary importance. Painting, decorating and the provision of âhomely furnitureâ was considered essential. Great effort was extended to laying down drainage and sewage pipes to prevent any outbreak of infectious disease. The provision of running water exercised the mind of the Board constantly. Fresh drinking water was âconsistently in short supply and deemed essential for the health and cleanliness of the house, to prevent infection and deal with any outbreak of fireâ. An extra well was sunk on the female side in 1863 and within a year rain water was collected from the roof to supply soft water for the laundry. Heating the building and reducing dampness was necessary. By March 1867 stoves were installed throughout the building to replace open fires. The Board agreed that this would result in âmore heat, using less fuelâ and the work was carried out under the supervision of architect George Wilkinson . The Gas Works in Mullingar town was built in 1859. The new Railway Station was one of the first buildings in the town to be lighted by gas. The question of lighting the hospital became a topic of debate for the Board from December 1866, following a recommendation from Dr. Nugent. He considered it âessential on scale of economy, comfort, cleanliness and safetyâ. He had first- hand experience of the benefits of gas lighting during previous visits to other asylums in Ireland, England and Scotland. The Board was instructed to investigate the feasibility of laying pipes from the Gas Works in Mullingar, and the costs and quality of supply, compared to building a private gas facility on the hospital grounds. The tender for the erection and installation of a gasometer was granted to William Daniels, at a cost of Â£1,051 9s 0d in February 1868. The R.M.S. was instructed to employ a competent person to manufacture and superintend the gas works at a salary of Â£25 per annum. Such was the importance attaching to the post, as outlined in the minutes of a meeting post the event, a reward of Â£5 was offered for information leading to 33\n\nP:46\n\nDevelopments the conviction of person or persons unknown who turned off the gas supply on the night of the 6th May 1868. Iron covers and padlocks were to be installed on the main outlet to prevent any such recurrence. Following the installation of gas lighting, lanterns were erected at the entrance gates and along the avenue to the main hospital building to facilitate ease of access. Further developments at the hospital included two new dining rooms, enlarged laundry and boiler house to cater for the increased patient population. Dr. John Nugent visited the Asylum on 24th August 1866 to personally inquire into the precautions taken by the R.M.S. in accordance with a notification from the office of Lunatic Asylums to meet any outbreak of cholera and deemed that Dr. Berkeley had adopted âthe best systemâ. He had set up rooms, with bathroom facilities, in the basement for males and converted a dayroom to an infirmary on a female ward as a temporary measure. Two months later Dr. Nugentâs colleague, Dr. G.W. Hatchell, advised the provision of detached infirmaries to each side of the hospital. Dr. Nugent stated in his 12th November 1867 report that it was quite clear that the Mullingar Asylum would not be adequate for the wants of the three counties. There were but two solutions, he noted, the enlargement of existing buildings with additional grounds or, as he recommended as the better alternative, the division of the district and the construction of a second asylum in Co. Meath, also to cater for Co. Louth. The Board meeting of 10th December 1867 thanked Dr. Nugent for his clear statement on the subject and, at a special meeting the following month, the Board stated âthat having duly weighed all the circumstances of the district and the changes in the law and wishing to avoid all unnecessary increases of taxation they beg to suggest that additional accommodation for sixty patients be erectedâ. Records maintained at St. Lomanâs Hospital show that the rise in patient numbers, (324 in 1868), necessitated the building of additional accommodation. According to Dr. Nugent, the rise in admissions resulted from a change in the law on the 1st January 1868, which allowed Magistrates to send dangerous 34\n\nP:47\n\nDevelopments lunatics to asylums rather than jail, for âthe benefit of scientific treatmentâ. In March 1871, Dr. Nugent stated to the Board âthat no Act ever has been more abused throughout Ireland than that which empowers Justices of the Peace to commit dangerous lunatics to asylumsâ. He noted that many patients were improperly sent, and on the most frivolous pretexts, from union workhouses. Nugentâs response states âthat in agreeing to the enlargement of the institution by 100 instead of 60 beds I cannot but think that the Board of Governors acted judiciously and for the benefit of the district at large â¦.â, suggesting that 20 acres of land needed to be added to the existing farm. George Wilkinson attended the Board meeting on the 10th March 1868 and was requested to submit plans for new buildings. It was further proposed to purchase additional land as the existing farm would be too limited for a large asylum. The purchase of 10 acres on each side of the original building was considered âmost desirableâ. By October 1868 tenders were accepted from Sir George Moyers in the amount of Â£4,698 14s 7d. The Governors requested that they have the power to appoint an officer of their own to oversee such a large and expensive development. Mr. Patrick Dromgoole was engaged as Clerk of Works at a salary of Â£2 10s per week. A new dining room was also to be constructed to eliminate carrying food from the central kitchen to wards at meal times. A general purpose room and accommodation for 130 patients was to be included. The total cost of buildings, land and boundary walls was to be under Â£10,000. This was given as a loan from the Government; interest free, to be repaid over the usual fourteen years. Primitive debt on the original building had recently been paid off. The new loan calculated on a rateable valuation of the three counties of Meath, Westmeath and Longford of Â£1,010,000 would be about 2/3rd of a farthing in the Â£. It was considered by Dr. Nugent that when work was completed âthe District would have, in every detail, a perfect institution creditable to the component counties and adequate to meet all their legitimate demandsâ. He again commented on âthe deficiency of space on the farmâ and the need to enlarge it. By 1870 the new extensions were completed to both the East (Delvin) side and to the west (Town) side, each with their own separate entrances and were later 35\n\nP:48\n\nDevelopments joined to the main building. This development required the purchase of 10 acres of land at each side of the building. In the report of John Nugent, 27th March 1871, he considered that one of the main objections to the limited area of land attached to the Asylum was the prison-like appearance produced by the close proximity of the east and west boundary walls to the building itself. A new wall was erected using the stone from the original wall. This new wall, stated Nugent, would ensure the security of the inmates and protect Asylum property. Despite the steady rise in patient numbers, totalling 400 by 1873, Dr. Nugent, in his report of 1st August of that year, considered the Mullingar Asylum to be âin good working order in every respect â testing the condition of the patients by their health and no better criterion of care and judicious treatment, nothing can be more satisfactory than their present stateâ. Entrance Gate Dr. Nugent considered that the entrance gate was not at all in character with the building and âtruly discreditable to the institutionâ. He recommended âa handsome gateway with iron gates similar to those in Kilkenny and Enniscorthyâ. On 8th August 1898, Dr. Finegan informed the Board that a new gateway had been opened behind the existing gate lodge âfor the convenience of the contractorâs cartsâ now that the new buildings were under construction. He considered it âmost desirable that this gateway be permanently maintained as it was directly in front of the new roadway round the churchâ and that âit could be used for all heavy traffic and thereby preserve in good condition the front avenueâ. Following the result of a competitive tender process Messrs. C & J Coyne, Millmount Road, Mullingar secured the contract to supply and erect new metal gates to the main entrance. On the 10th June 1954 a motion of the Board, proposed by Mr. James OâBrien Co. Co., paid tribute stating âthat the workmanship reflected great credit on the suppliersâ. 36\n\nP:49\n\nDevelopments Gate Lodge The earliest reference to the gate lodge is in Dr. Fineganâs report of 8th November 1888, to the Board, recommending that in order to provide a convenient residence for the head male attendant it was necessary to extend the gate lodge, to the east side, and shape it similar to a Swiss cottage. Mr. Christopher Glynn, Clerk of Works, would arrange the plans and ensure that all work was carried out by Asylum labour. The Gate Lodge at St. Lomanâs hospital. Mortuary Tenders were accepted for the erection of a âDead Houseâ from Mr. Richard Willis for a total of Â£49 10d 6s on the 31st October 1877. This building served as the hospital mortuary until 1961. 37\n\nP:50\n\nDevelopments R.M.S.âs Walled Garden A walled hospital garden was constructed for the use of the R.M.S. and to provide food and occupation for patients. It has a cut stone, Tudor style central gateway with the year 1889 inscribed on a limestone plaque. It also has cut stone towers at each end of the front wall, a central glasshouse with other glasshouses and buildings added later. 38\n\nP:51\n\nDevelopments The glasshouse in the walled garden in the early 1900âs Over the years the garden has supplied plants for ward decoration and landscaping at HSE facilities. Other produce was also grown which was used by the catering department at St. Lomanâs Hospital. The late John Gavin who joined the staff of St. Lomanâs in 1952 and was Head Gardener until his retirement. 39\n\nP:52\n\nDevelopments In the 1980âs, Nurse Kevin Craig started a highly successful garden project yielding potatoes of a very high standard. The potatoes were sold and all profits went to the patientâs comfort fund. Following Kevinâs retirement, the project continued under the supervision of Xavier Kiernan and later Dermot Cooney. The garden is still in use today providing occupational therapy for patients. Group of patients from St. Ednaâs ward preparing the garden for sowing the potatoes, the late Nurse Kevin Craig overseeing. In 2014, a group of staff, friends and family volunteered to undertake the renovation of the walled garden. The aim is to restore the garden to its former glory and create a therapeutic landscape for reflection and rehabilitation and a tranquil space to spend time with visiting relatives. Volunteers include Rose Cole, Ben Smith, Ann Masterson, Jenifer Nolan, Marie Nolan, Margaret OâNeill, Michael Hyland, Anthony Bennett, Colin Metcaffe, Mary Kelly, Noelle Hynes, Frank Hynes, Ciaran Conroy and the Maintenance Department, patients and staff from St. Ednaâs and the Admission Unit. 40\n\nP:53\n\nDevelopments Volunteers constructing the seating area in the walled garden. Reclaiming the walkways. The entrance to the old glasshouse planted with Hydrangeas. 41\n\nP:54\n\nDevelopments Bath House In 1875 approval was sought to build a Turkish bath. Dr. Nugent considered the installation of a Turkish bath very necessary especially given the number of patients engaged in outdoor labour. He stated there was âno means of cleaning so certain or so cheapâ. He referenced Cork Asylum where almost 1,300 baths were taken every ten days at a cost of two thirds of a farthing each. New Turkish baths were installed in 1889 with improvements to water supply, drainage, sanitary facilities and plumbing with the construction of a new boiler house and chimney. By 1890 the additions to the main hospital had been completed over four phases and then accommodated 601 patients (December 1890), with the stand alone units now joined to the main building by corridors or new wards. Overcrowding Overcrowding again became a serious issue at the hospital. At the 11th July 1889 Board meeting Dr. Finegan stated that âwhile the general health of inmates remains satisfactory the admissions to the female department have been so numerous during the past month, and the accumulation has so cramped our day room accommodation that I have been obliged to encamp about twenty of the female inmates in the grounds under canvas during the working hours of the day. The change from the wards has proved an agreeable one and has relieved the congestion of the day-rooms.â Female patients under canvas due to overcrowding. 42\n\nP:55\n\nDevelopments The First Electricity By September 1890 the need for the provision of electricity as a means of lighting the hospital became urgent due to the excessive cost of replacing the gasworks which had been in continuous use since 1868. On the 8th January 1891 a motion proposed by the Board âthat it was desirable that electricity be substituted for gas in the lighting of the asylumâ was carried unanimously. This development to plans by William Kaye Parry would cost Â£2,250. Installation was carried out by the Electrical Engineering Co. of Dawson Street, Dublin. In a report to the Board by the R.M.S. Dr. Finegan, 11th April 1892, the merits of electrification were extolled as follows: âthe first gleams of our electric light installation shone through the centre building of the asylum. The work of installation is not quite complete but we are already in a position to appreciate the beauty and salubrity of this excellent new illuminantâ. Electricity was produced using a coal fired, steam driven generator. The steam was further used to provide domestic hot water. By 1894 electricity was extended to all the buildings. The hospital was one of the first buildings lit by electricity in Mullingar. The âTall Chimneyâ Built in 1895 as a smoke stack serving the steam boilers, to the north of the main block. It was built to plans of architects Joyce and Parry, as part of ongoing developments involving improvements to the boiler house, laundry and provision of domestic hot water. Standing at 130 feet high, (as measured by J. Rainey & Co. Ltd., Swords, Co. Dublin, 1995) on an octagonal plan. It has a brick plinth to the base and metal-tie bars at regular intervals along its length. The redbrick chimney stack is a well-known landmark in the Mullingar area. 43\n\nP:56\n\nDevelopments A report from Delap & Waller, in November 1955, identified a crack in the chimney, bricks dislodged from the top, many courses of brickwork needing re- pointing and the lightning conductor needing replacement. This followed an initial inspection by an engineer from Messrs. Hamer & Sons Ltd., Lancashire, England. Regular maintenance and preservation has been carried out in recent years. Petitswood Petitswood is a detached three-storey building, on a U shape plan built around 1895, on hospital land on the opposite side of the Delvin Road from the main complex. Built using good quality limestone masonry, it has a steeply pitched slate roof with gable and hipped ends and red clay ridges. It is described in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage as a substantial and well-detailed late 19th century hospital building. âThe varied front facade, having various fronted and canted projections, echoes the form of the main original hospital buildingâ. There is a central courtyard comprising of the main building and out 44\n\nP:57\n\nDevelopments buildings. It was built to the designs of architects Arthur Edward Joyce and William Kaye Parry. On 9th October 1902, Dr. Finegan, in his report to the Board, stated that âthe new building at Petitswood is now sufficiently advanced to admit of being occupied by male patients, and I trust you will consider today the appointment of an adequate staff to work this department and further that you will kindly decide upon some rearrangement of the accommodation in the parent buildingâ. The building accommodated 150 male patients, most of whom worked on the farm. When the building was no longer required for patient accommodation it was used as the main Industrial and Occupational Therapy Department. In later years the Central Stores Department for the midland area was located in Petitswood. Today it is in use for the ARCS Department of Mullingar Resource Centre as well as a storage area. The Petitswood gate lodge is no longer in use, having been the residence for the head gardener in St. Lomanâs Hospital. The Retreat This 50 bed temporary wooden structure was Nurse Katherine Kenny (RIP) built, on the hospital grounds, in order to sitting on the veranda of accommodate the rapidly rising patient The Retreat. population while Petitswood was under construction. On 13th October 1904, the temporary wooden block formerly occupied by male patients was ârearranged and readily suitable to accommodate 76 female patients and 4 nurses â¦ one department is fitted with an open air shelter for the special treatment of females with tuberculosisâ. It remained in use as a ward until 1972 and it was then used as a social and recreational centre for both patients and staff. It was demolished in 1981. 45\n\nP:58\n\nDevelopments Last Governorâs Meeting Dr. Finegan, on 8th June 1899, reported to the new Asylum Committee that âas of 11th ultimo the late Governors of this Asylum held their last meeting and on the 16th they ceased to exercise any further control in the institution. I have felt myself solely responsible for its management and I have now the privilege of being relieved of the onus of control by you as the legally constituted authorityâ. He informed the new Committee that Â£26,367 5s 6d remained the residue of several loans for building purposes, but that Â£3,724 19s 6d remained to the credit of the hospital in the bank, along with Â£9,462 7s 9d due from the Imperial Treasury (as rate in aid for a period of fifteen months) for further maintenance. This change was brought about by the introduction of the Local Government Act 1898, which saw the formation of County Councils and District Councils. Many of the Governors retired and were replaced by newly elected County and Rural District Councillors from the three contributing counties. The signature of Lord Longford as Chairman of the Board appears for the last time on 11th August 1898 and that of Lord Greville on 10th April 1902. The new Asylum Committee continued with monthly meetings as had been custom and practice by their predecessors. They oversaw hospital financial management, granting of contracts for goods and services, many staff appointments and all other matters pertaining to the optimum and efficient running of the hospital. Subcommittees with responsibility for Finance, Visiting, House and Farm were also formed. In July 1934, the Committee welcomed its first female member, Mrs. Margaret Murray, a County Council representative for Meath. All activity of the Committee was overseen by the Westmeath County Manager, who also attended the monthly meetings. It later became normal practice for T.D.s and Senators to be included among the Committee membership. 46\n\nP:59\n\nDevelopments Buildings 1931 to 1956 From 1931 overcrowding and a rising number of admissions necessitated further expansion of the hospital. Patient numbers exceeded 1,150 in 1932. Mr. Edward Boyd Barrett, Architect, was charged with designing accommodation for 400 patients, along with a new nurses home and accommodation for catering and household staff. His designs were to consider cost while ensuring the major amount of employment in construction was to be given to those from the three contributing counties and building materials were to be sourced locally to further maximise employment. The contract for building was awarded to W.A. Roberts & Co., Dublin, in the amount of Â£113,369 4s 9d in June 1933. The contract specified teakwood floors, doors and finishings, as it was considered they âwould never warp or need paintingâ. Mr. R.J. Crawford, Dublin, was appointed Clerk of Works. From 1930 to 1955 Mullingar Mental Hospital is recorded as having received Â£139,310 5s 1d in Capital Grants from the Irish Hospitalsâ Sweepstake. The cost of work carried out over this period was over Â£250,000. Much of this development was spearheaded by Dr. Gavin, R.M.S., who died on the 15th October 1935. The Board of Management paid tribute to his âinitiative, his extraordinary ability and perseverance not only in getting the works carried 47\n\nP:60\n\nDevelopments through but also in obtaining a grant of 50% from the Irish Hospitalsâ Sweepstakeâ. The first new County Hospital to be built with Sweepstake funds was opened in Mullingar in April 1936. The hospital has been substantially developed to become the present day Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar. From December 1932, in conjunction with the development of new buildings, the method of heating and lighting the whole complex again concerned the Board of Management. The Department of Local Government and Health would not sanction the development of a private electricity generating plant. Tenders were accepted from the Electricity Supply Board (E.S.B.) to install and provide electricity to the old and now new buildings under construction, also to include a backup generator. Mr. Patrick Wynn was appointed Clerk of Works over the electrical installation and Mr. J.J. Judge of 189 Clonliffe Rd., Dublin, was appointed to oversee the development of a new kitchen and laundry. Following an appraisal by Delap & Waller, Consulting Engineers, the three existing Lancashire boilers were considered unfit for purpose. New boilers were to be installed. A representative of the newly formed Turf Development Board Ltd. was invited to attend the June 1935 Hospital Board meeting. The Turf Development Board was the forerunner to Bord na Mona, which would be set up in 1946. For discussion at the meeting was the feasibility of adapting one of the new boilers to facilitate turf burning. This proposal came about as a result of government policy at the time - being to reduce reliance on imported coal by developing peat bogs through mechanised harvesting of turf and other peat products. Following a successful trial period, under Prof. A.H. Taylor, a turbine furnace suitable for turf-burning was installed by the Crosthwaite Engineering & Furnace Company. The Hospital Board agreed to purchase 3,500 tons of turf, at 11/- per ton, with the stipulation that 500 tons would be sourced in Longford. New turf sheds were constructed to plans by Delap & Waller. During the years of the Second World War all the furnaces were converted to use turf, briquettes or milled peat, with coal used only when extreme cold periods occurred. Much of the turf was âhand-wonâ and sourced from small turf societies locally. Records show that patients and staff assisted in 48\n\nP:61\n\nDevelopments harvesting the turf in local bogs. In April 1950, the Board, in a reply to the Minister for Health, informed him that the hospital was ânow burning all native fuelâ. In August 1938 a new telephone service was installed throughout the hospital to plans by Delap & Waller. Over the years this telephone system was upgraded and modernised in line with telecommunication developments. The R.M.S. advised the Board of Management that in order to offer employment to people of the three counties it was necessary to provide accommodation on the campus. Sufficient private accommodation was not available in the town of Mullingar. The numbers of staff employed had risen in line with the increase in patient numbers. The practice of obliging staff to live on or adjacent to wards was no longer an ideal situation, as there was insufficient room available. The practice in both general and mental hospitals throughout the country was to provide purpose built accommodation on campus. He, therefore, proposed that a nurses home be constructed for the use of single female nurses. This development was to be followed by building accommodation for domestic and catering staff. Consideration would be given to the provision of accommodation for male staff at a later time. The Nurses Home opened on the 2nd September 1938 when 55 nurses were reported to be in residence. It is currently being used as office accommodation for HSE staff from various disciplines. The Nurses Home. 49\n\nP:62\n\nDevelopments St. Patrickâs Block. St. Bridgetâs Block. St. Bridgetâs and St. Patrickâs Blocks were occupied with the transfer of 150 and 130 patients respectively on the 12th January 1939. Each three-storey block comprised of three wards. Following the opening of both buildings Dr. Higgins, Acting R.M.S., reported to the Committee that the new buildings âwere modern and comfortable and much appreciated by the patient, it had relieved the overcrowding in the main building to the comfort of allâ. Frost damage and what was described as slight administrative difficulties delayed opening of the Admission Units, but by the 9th February 1939 all the new wards were occupied. 50\n\nP:63\n\nDevelopments The Admission Units. In his report to the Board of Management, 13th February 1939, Dr. Fitzgerald stated that he expected that the new buildings would be officially opened in the following few weeks and he sought approval to host the summer meeting of the Irish Branch of the R.M.P.A. at the hospital. A letter dated 7th July 1939 from Dr. P.S. Thompson, R.M.P.A., thanked the Board for the kind hospitality extended to the members and commented that it was one of their most successful meetings ever. The new buildings were officially opened by the TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Local Government and Health, Mr. Sean T. OâKelly, TD, on Thursday 3rd August 1939. Mr. Sean T. OâKelly, TD officially opens St. Patrickâs Block, St. Bridgetâs Block and the Admission Units â August 1939. 51\n\nP:64\n\nDevelopments Further developments in the 1930âs entailed demolishing the old gas works, boiler house, paint shops and coal yards. Dining rooms, kitchen, boiler house, laundry and maintenance workshops were upgraded and constructed. The stores complex to the north of the main building included a supplies store and shop, along with tailors and shoe-makers workshops. The Sanitary Annexes to Main Building were delayed due to the onset of World War II. In June 1949, the Hospital Board recommended proceeding with the developments in accordance with âmodern hospital ideasâ. Other improvements included new central heating for the main building and Petitswood at a cost of Â£60,000. Following a deputation from the hospital to the Minister for Health on 28th September 1949 in relation to financing the new projects a grant of 50% of the total cost of sanitary annexes, 40% of the central heating costs and Â£6,000 towards the cost of other approved buildings was secured through the Minister from the Irish Hospitalsâ Sweepstake. The hostel building which was to provide living accommodation for catering and household staff was not erected when originally planned (1938) due to a âwar-clauseâ in the original contract. While the Department of Health raised no objection to the provision of a temporary prefabricated building the decision was made to proceed with construction as originally planned, with Mr. Scott as the new architect. It was to cost Â£20,000. Work commenced in 1952 and the building was opened in 1956 with accommodation for 33 members of staff. Currently staff working with the Child and Family Service are accommodated in this building. The Hostel Building. 52\n\nP:65\n\nDevelopments Residence for Medical Officers Built in the early 1950âs, at a cost of Â£4,600, opposite the main entrance to the hospital. Described in the Record of Protected Structures maintained by Westmeath County Council as a âmodern building with an unusual pair of well-built ashlar limestone gate piers, with stone blancmange motif capstonesâ. It suggests that the piers, dating from 1850, were probably âmoved to their present location but remain a feature of some artistic meritâ. This house was later used as a low support hostel for clients of the hospital and subsequently transferred to Childcare Services. In June 1965 Boyd Barrett Architects prepared plans for three further residences for medical staff on hospital land on the Dublin Road. These houses were later used as low support hostels. A new 12 bed High Support Hostel will open on the site in 2014. Low support hostel on Dublin Road. New High Support Hostel currently under construction. 53\n\nP:66\n\nDevelopments The Childrenâs Ward Given the increasing incidence of children being presented for admission to hospital it was considered imperative that a specifically designated ward be allocated for the care of minors rather than the current practice of their needs being addressed amongst the adult patient population. These concerns were highlighted by the then R.M.S., Dr. Fitzgerald, during a Board meeting and a decision reached to discuss the matter with the Minister for Health, Dr. Noel Browne. In turn the Board was informed that consideration of this matter would receive attention by the Department of Health. This in turn led to the opening of a Childrenâs Ward following a decision reached by the Board in July 1968. Within the confines of this ward, care was given to children with profound cognitive impairment, mental handicap and medical conditions including congenital heart defects, haemophilia, epilepsy, to name but a few. The ward provided a more child friendly environment in which optimum care and more positive outcome could be achieved in a paediatric setting. It was now possible to maximise potential for the individual needs of the child in all aspects of their physical, psychological, academic and social development within the confines of their illnesses. Staff also accompanied them to the holiday home âOzanam Houseâ in Mornington, Co. Meath where they enjoyed summer days by the sea. Birthdays, Christmas, First Holy Communion and Confirmation days are etched indelibly on the minds of staff allocated to this ward and interacting with these children whose lifeâs milestones were marked within St. Lomanâs Hospital. In 1961, the Minister for Health Mr. SeÃ¡n MacEntee appointed a Commission of Enquiry to investigate and thereafter report on all aspects of mental handicap nationally. Following the inception of the Health Boards in 1970 further consideration was given to intellectual disability and the Midland Health Board purchased what was to become St. Peterâs Centre in Castlepollard in 1971. This facility then provided residential care, training and development for adults and children with learning and physical disabilities, and led initially to the transfer of paediatric patients from St. Lomanâs Hospital and thereafter adult patients followed. 54\n\nP:67\n\nDevelopments A cohort of psychiatric nursing staff were also allocated from St. Lomanâs Hospital to St. Peterâs Centre and later it became part of student nurse training to have rostered placement at this care centre. Dr. OâDaly, a medical officer with special interest in children with disabilities supported staff to attend training and education courses in Drumcar and Dun Laoghaire. In the late 1970âs, St. Peterâs Centre became an independent location under the auspices of the Intellectual Disability Services, relinquishing its affiliation with St. Lomanâs Hospital, marking another chapter in individualisation of patient care.

Assessment and training were continuous and relative, patients moved from a closely supervised ward situation, to more independent living in âflatletsâ and finally to the self-contained apartments (St. Itaâs) for total self-care prior to discharge. The aim of the individual and group programmes was to establish or re-establish social and living skills in patients to such a degree as to enable them, within the shortest possible time, to function at maximum level in the community.

In 1948 the Minister for Health requested the Mullingar Hospital Board to assist the Department in its efforts to eradicate tuberculosis nationally. He requested them to accept up to 250 patients from Castlerea Mental Hospital which was to be converted to a sanatorium, pending completion of the new Western Regional Sanatorium at Merlin Park, Galway. 90 male patients were transferred on the 26th April 1948. 85 more followed on the 28th April, with 75 females transferred on the 30th of that month. This brought the total number of patients in the hospital from 933 on the 25th April to 1,185 on the 30th. Dr. Fitzgerald assured the Board that they would be paid, in advance, for the maintenance of the patients by Galway County Council and that there were sufficient Irish speakers employed on the staff to deal with any native speakers from Castlerea. The transfer was supervised by Dr. Joseph Kearney, Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Most returned to their original hospital, with a small number opting to remain in Mullingar.

A number of houses are recorded in Bray and Dalkey and a marble staircase for the Marquess of Sligo at Westport House in 1858, but no commercial premises or churches. At the Board meeting, 8th March 1883, the Right Rev. Dr. Woodlock, Protestant Bishop of Meath, first proposed that a chapel be provided for the Roman Catholic inmates. George Wilkinson, was requested to prepare designs for a new church and presented same at the October 1883 Board meeting. The plans were accepted and a loan of Â£4,000 was proposed. In April 1884 the project was finalised at a cost of Â£3,000 and officially opened in 1887 by Rev. Dr. Nulty, the Catholic Bishop of Meath. St. Lomanâs Hospital Chapel. 66\n\nP:79\n\nReligious Services The building is a free-standing, typical late 19th century hospital chapel, built in a Gothic Revival style. It comprises of a seven bay nave, an apsidal chancel and a two-stage tower on a square plan. It has a copper spire, steep pitched natural slate roof, cast iron rainwater goods and raised cut stone verges on the gables. It is built of limestone with tall narrow pointed top windows. The interior has an open king post roof. In 1889 a sum of Â£40 was allocated for an altar, on the suggestion of Rev. Thomas Drumm. Apsidal Chancel and Altar circa 1900 On 14th November 1889, a new under.ground stove manufactured by Messrs. Parret & Son was installed and was considered to be âa most efficient heating apparatusâ. It removed the dampness and maintained a constant internal temperature. 67\n\nP:80\n\nReligious Services The structure of the chapel remains as originally built but it was re-roofed in 1929 and had a new altar added. In 1950 altar rails were installed, having been paid for by staff collections. After the second Vatican Council a wooden altar table was constructed by the patients of the Occupational Therapy Department. This was replaced in 1984 with the present marble altar. A view of the interior of the chapel. Old vestments and objects displayed during the Mass to mark 150th anniversary of opening of St. Loman's Hospital, 2005. 68\n\nP:81\n\nReligious Services The Mullingar Parish was paid a fee for providing religious services and, as records show, in 1914 the Roman Catholic Chaplain was paid Â£120 per year, which rose to Â£144 by 1926. At this time the Board reduced the salaries of all staff and in line with this reduction the chaplainâs salary reduced to Â£130. Roman Catholic services were provided by priests of the Mullingar Parish, with the first full-time chaplain appointed in 1944. The chapel continues to serve the needs of patients, staff and the local community.
