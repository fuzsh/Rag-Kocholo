        "text": "Kilkenny minor manager Niall Bergin has named an unchanged starting 15 for Saturday's All-Ireland Minor Final with Tipperary in UPMC Nowlan Park.\n\nThe Leinster winners in similar fashion to Tipperary reached the final on the back of an extra-time victory over Clare and although the likes of Louis Raggett, Patrick Lacey and Eoghan Cahill all impacted that game from the bench, the Kilkenny boss has decided to go with the same starting lineup.\n\nThe Cats are appearing in their first final since 2020 and they will be hoping to bridge a 10 year gap to their last success at this grade when they defeated Limerick.\n\nBoth counties are locked on 21 All-Ireland titles apiece so in an added bit of spice, the winner will move to the top of the minor roll of honour on their own.\n\nAs with most clashes between Kilkenny and Tipperary a close affair is expected for a game that is set to draw a large attendance to the Marble City.\n\nThe game is also live on TG4 where there is a 5.30pm throw-in.\n\nKilkenny- Jake O’Doherty (Mooncoin); Oisin Henderson (Dicksboro), Larry Phelan (James Stephens), Bobby Brennan (Erin's Own); David Barcoe (Clara), Jack Dollard (Glenmore), Mikey Rohan (Carrickshock); Kevin Buggy (Erin's Own), Robbie Doherty (Mooncoin); Jake Mullen (Shamrocks), Bill McDermott (James Stephens), Jason Cody (Glenmore); Ollie O’Donovan (John Lockes), Conor Holohan (O'Loughlin Gaels), Eoin Brennan (Erin's Own).\n\nSubs- Daniel McCormack (O'Loughlin Gaels), Diarmuid Behan (James Stephens), Cian Byrne (O'Loughlin Gaels), Eoghan Cahill (Graigue Ballycallan), Anthony Clifford (Dicksboro), Conor Heffernan (James Stephens), Patrick Lacey (Dicksboro), Conor McEvoy (James Stephens), Louis Raggett (Dicksboro).\n\nTipperary- Daire English; Shane Ryan, Cathal O'Reilly, Patrick Ryan; David Ryan, Owen O'Dwyer, Jake Donelan Houlihan; Tiernan Ryan, Darragh O'Hora; Adam Ryan, Euan Murray, Billy O'Brien; Eoghan Doughan, Stefan Tobin, Cillian Minogue.\n\nSubs- Evan Sherlock, Aaron Cagney, Jack Cahill, Killian Cantwell, Toby Corbett, Paul Cummins, Austin Duff, Joe O'Dwyer, Sean Walsh."
