FoCuSandLeArN (talk)\n\nPersonally, I think that this, John Wilson (Garda), Maurice McCabe and Martin Callinan should all be merged into a single article, named 2014 Garda Síochána controversy or some such. The affair is too small in the general scheme of things to merit four articles. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI agree, merge and redirect the rest. Snappy (talk)\n\nMerge Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nOk, whatever seems best for the Project. I guess I should decline and you'll go ahead with the merge? Thanks, FoCuSandLeArN (talk)\n\nIs it in order for me to move that article into mainspace, change the title, and then merge the others into it? I don't want to mess with the AfC process. If it's easier, you could just create the article and leave us to do the merging. Scolaire (talk)\n\nOppose. This is an inaccurate use of the merge procedure, coming under the \"should be avoided\" criterion. Is it possible that all these could have been merged because one person says it's \"too small\"? Martin Callinan, for instance, was a Garda Commissioner (just like Fachtna Murphy and the others) whose page is much better developed than the rest of them, and includes mention of his long career before 2014. John Wilson has appeared independently on TV, been the subject of documentaries and has had separate involvement/interest in politics to give some examples, all of which covers at least half his page, with virtually no mention of McCabe or Callinan. The only one that could possibly be merged is Guerin Report into Maurice McCabe. The rest are loosely connected at best. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.45.76.150 (talk)\n\n\"Just like Fachtna Murphy and the others\" is a tad misleading. There is only a handful of articles on Garda Commissioners, the majority of them on early commissioners, such as Eoin O'Duffy, Eamon Broy and Michael Staines, who were notable for things other than merely being commissioners. The Callinan article was only created when the whistle-blowing affair hit the headlines. Merely being involved in some high-profile cases does not make him otherwise notable. John Wilson is notable only for his involvement in the affair. That RTÉ did a programme on him does not alter that fact. Every one of the four articles owe their existence to the one affair, and none of them would have been created but for it. The affair is big news in Ireland right now, but not internationally, and it will be forgotten in a few years time. It just about merits one article; the others can be trimmed to the relevant bits and merged in. Scolaire (talk)\n\nFachtna Murphy's predecessor Noel Conroy was not an early commissioner either. All three mentioned here pass GNG. A large proportion of Wilson isn't even directly about the \"affair\" and Callinan was commissioner for years before 2014 so how can he be merged into an article about a 2014 event? As for \"not internationally\" this and this show some international interest. \"It will be forgotten in a few years time\" is speculation. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 86.45.76.150 (talk)\n\nNoel Conroy has a tag saying \"The topic of this article may not meet Wikipedia's general notability guideline\" – the very first edit after the article was created in 2009! I don't know who you think you're fooling: we can see these things with a single mouse click. Murphy's article is not so tagged...yet. I think it ought to be. Before Conroy, how many articles on post-1940 commissioners can you count?\n\nA large part of Wilson's article and a large part of Callinan's article are not about the affair, and those large parts are mostly unencylopaedic. What is relevant can be retained when they are merged.\n\nI didn't say that there was no interest in Britain or elsewhere, I said it is not big news there. And if you want to quote policy, WP:RECENTISM is far more relevant than WP:CRYSTAL. After all, I'm not proposing to say in any article whether it will still be news in a few years' time.\n\nAnd please learn to sign your posts by putting four tildes (~~~~) at the end. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI'd expect such a Merge would result in a single 33,069 or so byte article which seems entirely reasonable to me. — {{U|Technical 13}} (e • t • c)\n\nTechnical Opine Remembering that we need to retain sourcing information (WP:MERGE, Reasons for Merger, 3rd paragraph \"Merging should always leave a redirect...\"), I think the best solution is to accept the AFC submission and then merge all 3 articles into a unified submission. My justification for this is that if the AFC draft is left declined it may be deleted when the draft goes over 6 months without any edits to it (at which time CSD:G13 would be applicable). Hasteur (talk)\n\nI've asked FoCuSandLeArN to accept it, but he seems reluctant. Can somebody else accept it? I wouldn't know the technical ins and outs. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI'm not reluctant. I am simply waiting for us to reach a reasonable conclusion. FoCuSandLeArN (talk)\n\nSo, FoCuSandLeArN, how will you determine when of if there is a reasonable conclusion? I cannot initiate a proper merge discussion if I cannot tag all the articles, so we're left with this part-consultation, part-merge discussion, part-technical thread on a non-ideal page which is unlikely to reach any conclusion. And if by any chance there's a decision not to merge, will you create the article anyway? If so, what difference does it make if you do it now or do it later. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI didn't think there was any concensus whatsoever as per the discussion above. I've accepted the article so you can play with it at your own leisure. I suggest you use some patience in the future; after all, you wouldn't be talking about the article hadn't I let you know about its existence. FoCuSandLeArN (talk)\n\nDoes anyone know anything about those two paintings? We are looking for a source so we can safely keep the images on Commons. Any additional information is also very welcome! Thanks for your time! --Hedwig in Washington (TALK)\n\nThere were a series of these prints. My uncle who lived by the track in Blackrock owned several. This National Library of Ireland link, and this one may be of use for the first image and this link for the second image. Perhaps someone need to view the records in person to gleen any more. I hope this helps you. ww2censor (talk)\n\n@Ww2censor: Done Sources updated. :-)) Thanks a bunch! --Hedwig in Washington (TALK)\n\nFollowing from the discussion in the AfC submission - 30/05 section above, I am proposing that Guerin Report, 2014 Garda phone recordings controversy, John Wilson (Garda), Maurice McCabe, Martin Callinan and Gemma O'Doherty all be merged into 2014 Garda Síochána controversy. Discussion at Talk:2014 Garda Síochána controversy#Merger proposal. Scolaire (talk)\n\nHi all,\n\nMy name is Adi Khajuria and I am helping out with Wikimania 2014 in London.\n\nOne of our initiatives is to create leaflets to increase the discoverability of various wikimedia projects, and showcase the breadth of activity within wikimedia. Any kind of project can have a physical paper leaflet designed - for free - as a tool to help recruit new contributors. These leaflets will be printed at Wikimania 2014, and the designs can be re-used in the future at other events and locations.\n\nThis is particularly aimed at highlighting less discoverable but successful projects, e.g:\n\n• Active Wikiprojects: Wikiproject Medicine, WikiProject Video Games, Wikiproject Film\n\n• Tech projects/Tools, which may be looking for either users or developers.\n\n• Less known major projects: Wikinews, Wikidata, Wikivoyage, etc.\n\n• Wiki Loves Parliaments, Wiki Loves Monuments, Wiki Loves ____\n\n• Wikimedia thematic organisations, Wikiwomen’s Collaborative, The Signpost\n\nFor more information or to sign up for one for your project, go to: Project leaflets Adikhajuria (talk)\n\nWe have categories for entities that expired many centuries ago: empires, countries, provinces. North Tipperary, of blessed memory, is not yet cold in the grave when it has been consigned to the oblivion that is re-direct. Mr. ODEA has been busy de-populating and redirecting articles and categories away from North Tipperary. Is this in order? Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nTo confess, I too have been doing my bit to bury North Tipperary; mostly references to locations of towns but I think O'Dea goes too far. For example, he redirected the 'Local councillors in North Tipperary' to 'Local councillors in County Tipperary', and did the same with South Tipp. The North Tipp councillors category is a historic one, a record of those who served on North Tipp County Council, and it should be restored. Category:Councillors of Dublin County Council is an example of a category for members of a former local government entity. On the other hand, many other North Tipperary categories like Rivers, Lakes, Mountains, Strip clubs etc., that you created LL, will get my vote to be upmerged. Snappy (talk)\n\nIt would have been good manners if Laurel Lodged had done me the courtesy of alerting me to the fact that my actions were being discussed; I stumbled upon this discussion by accident. And why \"mister\"? I have never declared a gender. I merged the north and south counties following the coming-into-effect of legislation on 3 June 2014 amalgamating the two counties, which no longer exist. It was a large, repetitive job of about 680 edits (you're welcome) but I can correct any mistakes brought to my attention. Further, even more tedious, work remains to be done fixing references in articles to the former counties, as alluded to by Snappy. That is an even bigger task, unless we can find someone who can write a script to do it. I was thinking since yesterday of writing a note here to inquire if anyone knows how to find one of these coders. Does anyone know? — O'Dea (talk)\n\nForgive my discourtesy O'Dea, though it's rather mild by comparison to the ravaging of NT and ST at your hands. Snappy is right - though his interpretation is at the very mildest end of the scale in my view. All of NT is now historic but that's no reason to hide its brief but glorious flowering. The hunt for a coder may be a good idea, though not to continue the de-population but instead to undo the devastation. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nBefore my work, many hundreds of articles were miscategorised. Do you have any positive suggestions to make or do you merely wish to continue to use the Wikipedia talk process to express bitterness and piss on other editors' work and time devoted to the project? Please adhere to WP:Civil and contribute any positive suggestions you may have concerning Tipperary instead of merely griping. — O'Dea (talk)\n\nWhat mis-categorisation? All were diffused to the lowest level of detail. Each NT / ST category is a child of Tipperary. You fixed something that was not broken. It's been a colossal waste of time in my view, and of that I'm positive. I positively recommend that you revert the damage. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nDamage? You cant be serious Laurel Lodged! Your argument was the Irish categories should be divided along current administrative boundaries. I dont suppose you would advocate having County Dublin cats since it had a long and glorious existence.! Fair Play O'Dea keep up the good work. Finnegas (talk)\n\nI have never advocated the destruction of County Dublin as a category. Even though it is, like NT & ST, redundant as a county and administrative territory, it is still noteworthy. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nI have a bot account that has been laying idle for some time. It's time it got some work to do. If someone lays out clearly the task to be done, I can write up a script and get the task approved over the next week or so. --Tóraí (talk)\n\nI am still waiting for @O'Dea: to come up with some justification for his \"work\" on the NT / ST categories. If he/she cannot produce such a rationale, then he/she should revert the \"work\". Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nIt's a looong road to (fixing) Tipperary\n\nSnappy: I have responded to your concern above and reverted my category changes for the councillors in North and South Tipperary, and reinstated the two categories that contained them. Tell me of other articles that require category reversion if you identify any.\n\nTóraí: The automation of article updates using a script is not nearly as straightforward a problem as I imagined. I envisioned creating a list of articles containing links to North Tipperary and South Tipperary and getting a bot operating in batch mode to read the list and simply substitute County Tipperary within those articles in all cases. This approach is crude and prone to error. There are too many cases where references to the old names remains legitimate even after amalgamation of the counties. I also imagined an alternative bot operating in interactive mode using a list of articles to investigate, where the editor could open each article and review it intelligently before deciding whether to perform an automated substitution at the click of a button. Such an interactive bot would be more complex to code than a simple batch-mode bot.\n\nAn additional difficulty is that even generating an accurate list of articles to review is not trivial. A list of articles containing Wikilinks to North Tipperary and South Tipperary can be retrieved easily enough (example included in collapsed green box below, as illustration), but there may be, in addition, articles containing references to \"North Tipperary\" or \"South Tipperary\" that are not Wikilinked. Searching for such articles creates many false positives because, for example, a search for non-Wikilink references returns articles containing templates at the bottom of the article which contain mentions to the two old counties. Such articles might not require editor review at all. I will continue to analyse the scope of the task as time permits. In any case, the number of articles to consider ranges rather widely between about 600 and 1,200! — O'Dea (talk)\n\nTipperary article list (work in progress)\n\nO'Dea: Sounds like a job for something like the AutoWikiBrowser. This tool semi-automates tedious tasks. If you download the software, familiarise yourself with it and come up with a plan, I will approve you for its use. --Tóraí (talk)\n\nHellllooooooo Just like to point out that all of the above contravenes wiki policy. Before anybody fires up a bot, let's first hear the rationale for disappearing all NT / St cateogries. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nHow so? Why would we want Rivers of North Obselete County and Rivers of South Obselete County when all we need is Rivers of Current County? I'd had hoped that you wouldn't throw a fit when North and South Tipperary were abolished and the inevitable changes that would result on Wikipedia, but alas poor Laurel Lodged! Snappy (talk)\n\nFor the same reason that we have Category:Ancient Roman government, Category:Ancient Roman provinces and Category:Ancient Roman geography. They're old, their obsolete but they had their moment of glory and are still notable. Still awaiting the abolition rationale from somebody.... Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nI've already given it to you, but of course, you don't want to hear it. Instead, you just propose some What about X-ery and compare apples to oranges? You keep on eye on WP:CFD now. Snappy (talk)\n\nI have not found an explanation from Snappy for the disappearing of the NT/ ST category structure. All I found was a rhetorical question. I provided an answer above (i.e. there is ample precedent for keeping categories for former entities). Snappy thinks that this is apples and oranges - it is not. The (Roman) analogy is apt. So please set out a succinct reason for disappearing the NT / ST tree structure (instead of \"I already told you\"). No explanation at all is forthcoming from the main culprit - O'Dea. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nWhat about something snappy like \"The NT /ST tree categories should be deleted because them violate Wiki policies X, Y & Z\". Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nUnless I get a responsible answer on this from the main culprits by tomorrow, I will escalate this matter. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nThis sounds like a good old WP:BATTLEGROUND. The Banner talk\n\nCould people keep an eye on the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home article, please? There's an American editor who seems intent on discrediting anything that might be seen as damaging to the RC church or the nuns, and is being far from objective. (Apparently when Catherine Corless is videoed saying that it's possible there are 800 babies buried in a septic tank, we're to ignore that and instead take the words of the journalist who recorded the video yet somehow reports those words as Corless saying \"It's impossible!\" - contrast the written report with the video - http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/tuam-mother-and-baby-home-the-trouble-with-the-septic-tank-story-1.1823393 and see also http://kettleontherange.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/an-international-publicity-frenzy-and-my-mother/ ). Thanks, BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nEamon Gilmore's article has undergone large scale hagiography-isation in recent days, if anyone wants to keep an eye on it. Snappy (talk)\n\nThirty-one of the 179 citations are now dead links that either need archive links, possibly from the Wayback Machine, or updating and that excludes all the Irish Times citations, of which there are many, that nowadays require subscription, so there are blind to readers. Maybe we should try to avoid Irish Times links in citations when other accessable sources are available. I've several other bad links yesterday but this is an article that should be kept in better shape. Anyone who can help please step in and do what you can. Thanks ww2censor (talk)\n\nThe Irish Times is not the main problem. And when you have a decent article title, you can access most stuff through Highbeam. The Banner talk\n\nBut as I understand it you also need a subscription for Highbeam just like the Irish Times though it is less expensive, so it is almost as useful as the Irish Times except you can actually read the first few paragraphs. ww2censor (talk)\n\nWikipedia:HighBeam: Sign up for free access access to HighBeam's online resources (accounts available) The Banner talk\n\nWhile that is somewhat useful for editors I cannot see casual readers bothering, besides which, free is only for 7 days otherwise it is $29.95 per month, etc. ww2censor (talk)\n\nAs of March 13, 2012 HighBeam has generously agreed to give free, full-access one-year accounts for Wikipedia editors to use, at the discretion of the community. HighBeam is excited about this and does not expect there to be a shortage of these free, one-year accounts; however, editors will have to have a one-year-old account and 1000 edits in order to qualify for one. At the end of one year, editors who found the resource useful can simply re-apply. So nothing to do with 7 days... The Banner talk\n\nThanks for that info. That's really useful to editors but again, as I said the casual reader is unlikely to bother, so we are still depriving them of a useful link through abd how we access source is not their concern, nor should it be. ww2censor (talk)\n\nA CfD to rename Category:Irish Sinn Féin politicians to Category:Sinn Féin politicians (1905–1926) ended with the cat being merged with Category:Sinn Féin politicians instead, but with the rider, \"this close is without prejudice to the creation of one or more subcategories with specified date cutoffs.\" I have created a subcat, Category:Early Sinn Féin politicians, which avoids the use of parentheses, with a hatnote saying, \"This category contains politicians who were members of Sinn Féin before or during the Irish revolutionary period (1912–1923).\" I have moved 171 articles that were previously in Category:Irish Sinn Féin politicians into this cat. Scolaire (talk)\n\nWhether the Category:North Tipperary and Category:South Tipperary and all their sub-cateogries ought to be de-populated and made into re-directs to Category:County Tipperary and its sub-cateogries. Whether the two categories are still notable, historical entities or may be entirely deprecated. Whether articles that formerly reported solely to one of the two categories (before their de-population)ought to have a double parentage to one of the two categories, as relevant, and County Tipperary. Question for voting purposes: Should Category:North Tipperary and Category:South Tipperary be retained, and relevant articles have double parentage? Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nSurvey\n\nSupport maintenance of NT & ST categories and the double parentage per article which helps the reader. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nOppose Redirect to County Tipperary.

Finnegas (talk)\n\nThreaded discussion\n\nSee above thread also.\n\nThe question is entirely composed of \"whether...ors\", and is therefore incapable of a yes/no answer. If anything, I would take a support answer as meaning \"Category:North Tipperary and Category:South Tipperary and all their sub-cateogries ought to be de-populated and made into re-directs\", because that is at the beginning of the question. Either the question ought to be re-phrased e.g. \"Should Category:North Tipperary and Category:South Tipperary be retained, and relevant articles have double parentage?\", or each of the possibilities (how many are there exactly?) should have its own subsection where participants can support or oppose. Scolaire (talk)\n\nSingle question now framed. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nDid I miss this part in history? I cant remember the 1937 pleb giving us the \"Commonwealth of Ireland\". AFD?

SW3 5DL (talk)\n\nIt has been brought to my attention, that there is currently an ongoing debate on the Magdalene asylum article.

I am appealing to see if there are people with better knowledge within the project to comment on the situation and possibly provide a solution. I have discussed the issue on the talk page, but to no avail. Here is a discussion about prior concerns being raised about the issue, you can also see my own contribution here.

As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded. I believe there is a lot of potential for WikiProjects to facilitate collaboration across subject areas, so I have submitted a grant proposal with the Wikimedia Foundation for the \"WikiProject X\" project. WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please review the proposal here and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my talk page. Thank you for your time! (Also, sorry about the posting mistake earlier. If someone already moved my message to the talk page, feel free to remove this posting.) Harej (talk)\n\nA discussion is taking place as to whether the article His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia according to Wikipedia's policies and guidelines or whether it should be deleted.\n\nThe article will be discussed at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State until a consensus is reached, and anyone is welcome to contribute to the discussion. The nomination will explain the policies and guidelines which are of concern. The discussion focuses on high-quality evidence and our policies and guidelines.\n\nUsers may edit the article during the discussion, including to improve the article to address concerns raised in the discussion. However, do not remove the article-for-deletion notice from the top of the article. Scolaire (talk)\n\nCouldn't it be a line on the IFS page, that the government was technically described as \"His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State\". We are back to description and (different) name again.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion here that may interest the project. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nI seen 2008–14 Irish protests and thought to myself there hasn't been 6 years of protests in Ireland that have common thread . It seems to be agenda pusging. AFD ? Gnevin (talk)\n\nIt seems like this goes hand-in-hand with 2008–14 Irish financial crisis, so might be better to rename as 2008–14 Irish financial crisis protests. AFD sounds like a way to get more opinions. ww2censor (talk)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/2008–14 Irish protests Gnevin (talk)\n\nThe protests article will overload the 2008–14 Irish financial crisis, and should remain as a separate article. The protests made little difference, the theme was anti-austerity (aren't we all?), and should be recorded as a part of history. Anti-austerity protests has its own \"issues\".PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nEr, no, its a coatrack article, with OR to link it. Are they ALL anti-austerity? Are they co-organised? Are they linked by common goals? Are they linked by common priciples? Anti-coruption, anti-austerity, anti-government, anti-globalism and more anti's than I care to type, are not a linear form for a stand alone article, they can be mentioned in the relevant articles with relevant weight to their importance. Murry1975 (talk)\n\nIt needs rewriting, but anti- whatever protests are a big part of our history.

Murry1975 (talk)\n\nSame editor that created the Commonwealth of Ireland article that was deleted. Murry1975 (talk)\n\nSupport Delete. Noted that it adds no useful information, but that the paragraph on \"Formation\" uses the historic present style of the source[2] from which it is taken (\"This site is run by Soren Swigart and Axel Schudak\")[3]; the subsection headed \"World War 2\" would need cleaning up: \"...neutrality was on preservation of Irish sovereignty...\", \"...at series of meetings ...\"; the subsection \"Republic of Ireland established\" also needs cleanup. Qexigator (talk)\n\nMy text from the relevant talk page cut and pasted:\n\nDunum and Domnainn in particular should not be used as they are (I hear somewhere Domnain was not around that time, and I can say factually that Dunum was not only the name of Down, and that Ptolemy did not record it that way. It was the name of many, even then, as recorded by all, and still is, throughout Europe to a lesser degree). It is not the same map at all though it says it is, and the reasons for switching it around and claiming it to be the same thing is not described. So I am inclined to request deletion and replace with the actual map. For instance, I count 10 settlements on Ptolemys map. On this map I count 11, and only four of them the same as Ptolemy, with no explanation.\n\nAnd I haven't gone over every inch of it, but there are significant differences and omissions. It seems that this map is widely used on early tribes, while Ptolemys original is used only as part of the Irish history template. Let's have more than faith that this is sourced and accurate, or let's use Ptolemy, and describe then any suggested alterations or inaccuracy. I'm a bit uncomfortable challenging this particular map, but it interests me and appears inaccurate, so I want to ask about how it is being done, cheers. ~ R.T.G\n\nAny chance you could link to the \"relevant talk page\"? Scolaire (talk)\n\nIt's at File talk:Keltoi Tribes.PNG. I agree, it's not a very good map, although \"Keltoi Tribes\" is probably more of a problem than \"Ptolemy's Ireland\". Domnainn, Cruithin and Eamhain Macha are not from Ptolemy, and Eblana is placed at Dublin which almost certainly isn't where it was. Your proposed alternative is not much better as it also places Eblana at Dublin, and the shape of the map bears no relation to the shape of the island either in reality or according to Ptolemy's coordinates. See this link to Bill Thayer's site for the text and a map based on it. I'm sure someone with the appropriate software could whip up something similar for Wikipedia. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nLooking further at the \"Ptolemy's Ireland and Keltoi Tribes\", you're quite right that Dunum is put in the wrong place: from Thayer's version of the map it should be roughly in Laois or Kildare. It includes both Ebdani and Blanii, which are two manuscript variants of the same name (Eblani is the more usual version). Concani and Gangani are also manuscript variants of the same name, and so (I think) are are Usdiae and Vodiae. To clarify my earlier comment, Eamhain Macha, Domnainn and Cruithin are early medieval, and it is very clear that the political geography of Ireland changed greatly between Ptolemy's time and then, and while the Irish can be considered Celtic in the modern sense in that they spoke a Celtic language, we can't call them \"Keltoi\" in the ancient sense.\n\nA better map is certainly needed. I appear to have made a map of Ptolemy's Irish population groups at Protohistory of Ireland#Ptolemy by adding image labels to a blank map (although I no longer remember how), but it doesn't include the promotories, rivers, towns or islands. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\n@RTG: Looking at File:Keltoi Tribes.PNG, I see that it was created by User:Setanta Saki, (formerly Caomhan27). If you want to know the rationale behind it, the best way is probably to ask him on his talk page. Looking at what links to it, in almost every case it is used to illustrate an article – usually small – on one of the tribes referred to. It's caption in each case is some variation on \"Celtic tribes in Ireland according to Ptolemy\". I would recommend that in each case the file be replaced with the Ptolemy's map file; it is by far the more logical illustration. The caption should also be expanded to say, for instance, \"The Gangani are shown in the west of the country\". Where a tribe does not appear on the map (I don't see the Iverni, for instance) it should be removed. Similarly, in the Brigantes article, it should be moved from it's current location (a list of settlements in England) to a section that actually mentions Ireland, or removed altogether. I've just discovered that the file you have shown is not Ptolemy's map, but was drawn by Wenceslaus Hollar in the 17th century. Ptolemy's map is shown here, although even that says it was published in Rome in 1490, so it's only a copy of the 2nd-century one. Unless a copyright-free image of the real Ptolemy's map can be uploaded, all illutrations should be removed from the articles on which Keltoi_Tribes.png is currently used.\n\n@Nicknack009: the accuracy of Ptolemy's map is of no importance, since the file is only being used to say where Ptolemy said the tribes and settlements were. I would be more concerned about the accuracy of any alternative map, and the reliability of the sources used to create it. Bill Thayer says of himself, \"Obviously, I like to think of myself as a guy with no credentials but writing fairly decent stuff.\" The standard on WP:RS is somewhat higher than that. BTW, to see how you added the labels to the blank map, just click \"edit\" above it. Scolaire (talk)\n\nYes, I see that. Don't remember actually doing it, and have evidently forgotten how to use using image labels in the meantime. I based it on Philip Freeman's Ireland and the Classical World, which I believe I still have, so maybe I could work up a better map based on that. In the meantime, I think I'll copy my image-labelled map into relevant articles. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nAs I said above, I don't think anything should be shown in those articles. Ptolemy's Ireland was not shaped like NASA's Ireland, so any placing of the labels on the NASA map is pure guesswork. As far as I'm concerned, nothing at all would be better than guesswork. If a copyright-free image of Ptolemy's map could be uploaded, that would be different. But you can't say Ptolemy put this tribe in this place when in fact he put it somewhere on a crazy geometric shape. Scolaire (talk)\n\n\"Guesswork\"? It was based on a reliable source, a contemporary scholar who's done the work of trying to relate Ptolemy's coordinates to the actual territory. Don't go around calling other editors' sourced and cited efforts \"guesswork\". --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nThe work of trying to relate Ptolemy's coordinates to the actual territory is precisely that: guesswork. There is no scientific methodology outlined anywhere. The amount of work they've put into it is not a factor. Sorry, I missed the bit where it was based on Philip Freeman's work. As I do not know this work, I cannot comment on methodology. Did Freeman draw a map, and is your map derived from his? If so, then the new template should state that explicitly, instead of just a citation. If not, is it based on co-ordinates provided by Freeman. Again, this should be made explicit in the template. Otherwise, to what extent is it scientific and to what extent guesswork? Scolaire (talk) – edited 17:19, 21 October 2014 (UTC)\n\nThe entire field of ancient history is based on the interpretation of sources by scholars. Or, as Scolaire has unilaterally declared it, \"guesswork\". That's it, we'll just have to remove all articles on ancient history from Wikipedia.\n\nTell me something. You have one map, based largely on Ptolemy but not sourced and with a number of obvious flaws. You bring it here for discussion. I point out there's a better one already in use on Wikipedia, based on and cited to a reputable source, and start using it more widely, and you unilaterally declare it worthless and delete it on sight, without discussion. Explain precisely why the \"Ptolemy's Ireland and Keltoi Tribes\" map merits discussion, but my map doesn't. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nDid you post that before you saw my edit to my previous post? I apologized for the earlier misunderstanding and tried to engage with you on specifics. I am genuinely interested in discussing this and would like to arrive at a solution. Answering my questions would be more conducive to discussion than just ranting. In my first post here I said that all illustrations should be removed from affected articles. I never gave any weight to the other image, and never made any attempt to restore it to articles. It was RTG who first brought it here for discussion, not me. Scolaire (talk)\n\nIt seems I did. Your edit hadn't shown up when I was composing my reply - no idea how I didn't get an edit conflict. Thanks for the apology. And you're right, it wasn't you who brought it here for discussion, and I apologise for getting that wrong. But you still insist on referring to \"guesswork\", so I will no longer take any part in this conversation. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nA pity. I think the template is usable – not as it is, but with a little work on the legend. There's not much point in me offering suggestions, though, if you refuse to take part in discussion. It will have to remain unusable and unused. Why that one word makes you so angry I can't imagine. I've never seen it on any list of words to avoid. I'm a historian myself, and I can tell you that when you have researched all your sources, it still requires a considerable amount of g*******k to put your theory together. In any event, I didn't mean it to be insulting and I don't see it as insulting so I can't and won't apologise for it. Scolaire (talk)\n\nIf you want to go around insulting people who are trying to help, you're not going to get any. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nMy comments are on content only. There's no need to get personal. Scolaire (talk)\n\nDismissing the sourced and cited work of another editor as \"guesswork\" is not a comment on content, it's an insult. You did not use that sort of language about the creator of the \"Ptolemy's Ireland and Keltoi Tribes\" map. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nThe \"Keltoi Tribes\" map looks like pure guesswork to me. You may characterize such a comment as an insult; that is a matter of opinion and it still doesn't justify a personal attack. Scolaire (talk)\n\nRe-reading your post now, I saw something I hadn't noticed before. Let me repeat, I did not \"use that sort of language\" about the creator of the Keltoi Tribes map or about you. My observations were about the images themselves, and the questions they raised about how they were created. Scolaire (talk)\n\nThis claims to be an accurate description of Ptolemy, with a set of co ordinates, but it's not a map, it's just a plot. ~ R.T.G\n\nYes, that's the Bill Thayer page that Nicknack linked to above. It seems to be the 1490 Ptolemy map reduced to straight lines. It has the same problem as the images of the map, though: they're all copyright. Maybe if somebody else did a freehand copy of the 1490 map, labelled it appropriately and uploaded it to Wikipedia/Commons that could be used. Alternatively, Nicknack's template could be used if it was made clear on the face of it that it is a modern map, not Ptolemy's map, and that the placing of the tribes was based on scholarly interpretation of Ptolemy's written works. Scolaire (talk)\n\nImages of the maps are not copyright when they are before about 1923, ~ R.T.G\n\nGo ahead and upload it, then. Problem solved. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI was looking at it just now but on reading the rest of the page properly, the author says in notes about \"the translation\" , \"If you are doing serious research, you should not base any of it on this edition, nor should you cite it, at the risk of immediately vitiating your work in the mind of anyone competent to judge.\" Because he reckoned the translations he was working with are useless, he just left up how much he had already published before he gave up. Apparently Ptolemys surviving texts have instructions on drawing a map and co-ordinates. ~ R.T.G\n\nI've recreated the Ptolemy's from the coordinates of towns, rivers, headlands and islands given by Ptolemy. Before the question is raised, recreation of images in this manner is not OR. The sources of the coordinates is http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/1*.html --Tóraí (talk)\n\nTóraí, would you be knowing of a good source for the Keltoi parts, and be able to do something similar on a blank Ireland map from Commons? Or even confirm the one above and correct the title? It would be a good improvement over several articles I think. But that's Ptolemy anyway unless something from his instructions can be had and be different. ~ R.T.G\n\nIt's the only hit for \"ptolemy\" on the Maps of Ireland category on Commons, out of a couple hundred. ~ R.T.G\n\nAs far as I know, Ptolemy only gave a rough description of location of the different tribes relative to features on his map. These features, such as towns and rivers, he identified with coordinates. I didn't add the tribes to the map I created because it would require speculation on my part.\n\nI think we would need to use a published map, such as the first one above, to locate these tribes. A map like mine or the second one above would require some OR if it was to locate the tribes on it, I believe. --Tóraí (talk)\n\nWould you be able to put it on the proper coordinates on a map showing its position according to Ptolemy? ~ R.T.G\n\nWould I be able to put what on the proper coordinates? --Tóraí (talk)\n\nYou plotted that using coordinates. Those are assumedly coordinates of the actual map, maybe even with similar numberings, so could probably be put on the map in the place Ptolemy said, which is probably not the place of the actual place. I think there are about four maps, 1). a 1467 one, 2). the Torai version, 3). the Torai version superimposed on a map showing both its shape and position in comparision to todays map, and 4). a map of the Keltoi, and maybe even some others in place of 4)., and such a tall order then because it would go for a lot of articles covering a lot of queries,? ~ R.T.G\n\nThose 4 maybe with a picture of the earliest version of \"Geography\" text either Hibernia or earlier would be a set as such could go on a good few articles, ~ R.T.G\n\n@RTG: I wasn't suggesting you upload the Bill Thayer map, I was suggesting you upload the 1490 one – this image, which I previously linked to, or another image such as this one, which doesn't have \"rootsweb.com\" printed on it). This one is in colour. Scolaire (talk)\n\n@Scolaire:The colour one is from UCD, even with the brush strokes on it, as a lifelike copy, its copyright is that of the original, i.e, none. I had been thinking of the 1467 one as its date is older and it looks originally coloured, but for no other reason (follow it to Commons and check out the shape of Scotland in the larger map, it nearly touches Holland). You'd really need an accurate translation of the original to make anything more than a preference, ~ R.T.G\n\nOkay, so there is a file in Commons already which calls itself Ptolemy's Ireland. That's fine. I'll go back to saying what I said originally. In articles on tribes that are on this map it might be added as an illustration if desired. Personally, I don't think it adds anything – in most cases the illustration will be bigger than the article – but if it is to be added it should be small (no bigger than 150px) and It should say exactly what it is. Thus in the Nagnatae article it would be:\n\n[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - Ireland.jpg|thumb|150px|A 15th-century map of Ireland based on [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's Geography]]. The Magnatae are shown in the west of the country]]\n\nScolaire (talk)\n\nAs you might have seen in the Signpost this week, there's currently a drive to go through the million 19th century images released by the British Library last year, and identify all the maps, with a view to their being georeferenced by BL volunteers, and then uploaded to Commons early next year. As of Sunday night, over five thousand new maps have been identified, with 26.5% of the target books looked at -- but see the status page for the latest figures, and more information.\n\nA part that may specifically interest this project is\n\nc:Commons:British Library/Mechanical Curator collection/Synoptic index/Ireland\n\nwhich currently shows pink templated links for 121 Flickr book pages still to be looked at. (Though there are lots of other parts of the world, still to be looked through as well).\n\nAny help looking through these would be very much appreciated -- as well as the maps (and ground plans) for tagging, you may well also find other interesting or useful non-map views that may be worth considering or uploading for articles on different places in Ireland.\n\nThanks, Jheald (talk)\n\nFirstly the John Charles McQuaid article is a mess. He really is a huge figure - like it/him or not - in Ireland's 'recent' history, and really deserves a better quality article. There are lots of refs in there, but the structure is very poor, and some of the prose is poor and POV.. I think someone with a bit more experience than me needs to take it in hand.\n\nSecondly, While reading the above article I noticed there was no article for the TV series Radharc, so I created a stub, but it needs some filling out. I will do some of it but any help would be appreciated. Patient12 (talk)\n\nThere was a book published some time ago, No Tigers in Africa, about the programme. It would be a useful source, and may be available at the local library or on Ebay. Scolaire (talk)\n\nThanks Sclaire. Actually it's available brand new on Amazon for a couple of quid. Patient12 (talk)\n\nThere is a Requested move at Irish Republic that may be of interest to project members. Scolaire (talk)\n\nNow speedy-closed. It may re-appear at WT:IECOLL. --Scolaire (talk)\n\nWe have absolutely nothing on the controversy around the allegations by Mairia Cahill, grand-niece of Joe Cahill, that Sinn Féin/the IRA/Gerry Adams knew of her claim of rape by a leading republican, that she was interrogated by the IRA about the claim, and that the proper authorities were not informed. I asked about including it on the Gerry Adams page, three days ago, but there's not been a single response to date. I could be bold but I'd expect similar results to this if I tried... BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nNearly a week later, and not even one \"No, WP is no place to stage your coat-racking BLP attacks on Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin?

Adding the ongoing controversy to any article would be recentism. When the dust has settled we will see whether the controversy has had a lasting impact on Sinn Féin, the IRA or Gerry Adams. These things can only be assessed in retrospect. In the meantime, maybe you should be over at Wikinews asking why there's no mention of it there. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI'm not looking for an argument, Scolaire. I am genuinely puzzled as to why or how a news story that's been covered in depth in mainstream media, pretty much every single day for a month, and involves both the leader of Sinn Féin and Enda Kenny doesn't merit a single mention on any of the Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin, or Provisional Irish Republican Army pages. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nThe clue is in the word \"month\".

Let it go. --Scolaire (talk)\n\nShe deserves an article having also been an officer in Sinn Féin Republican Youth. And someone should do an article on the hereditary aspect of the leadership in that part of the world.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nSome questions arising here, after the merger of Waterford City and Co. Councils, is Dungarvan still a county town? What is the difference between \"county town\" and \"administrative centre\"?Now during purely discussion and trying to find links, myself and an IP editor are being called \"difficult\", even though no out come has been reached and no major edit (a tag only by the IP) has happened. Cheers. Murry1975 (talk)\n\nNote also that we have the county town article, whose section on Ireland simply lists Waterford as the county town, and is also completely unsourced. I think the root cause is that \"county town\" isn't formally or legally defined, so can mean either \"county town of a traditional county\", or \"administrative centre of a present council area\". If the former, the CT is Waterford; if the latter, we'd have two CTs for the merged entity. We should make clear which sense we intend in each article. The linguistic debate about which usage is \"correct\" is likely to be fraught and twisty, and would lead us down the path of having to obtain reliable sources using that terminology explicitly, when in practice it's very patchy. 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nOn Talk:List of urban areas in the Republic of Ireland by population, a discussion is going on about county town. To my opinion, the discussion is growing more and more vague and into WP:OR. Hot apple is county Waterford, where Dungarvan seems to be the county town but Waterford City is the main town.\n\nYour opinion (and sources!!) are highly appreciated there. The Banner talk\n\nI'd strongly prefer not to split the discussion, but I really struggle to see how it's \"into OR\" to object to a vague, unsourced, contradictory claim (that you repeat above) in the article status quo, and to suggest a recasting of the article that can clearly be sourced. But I do at least agree that more input would be very welcome: otherwise this seems likely to go around in circles indefinitely. 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nDo you have any sources that Waterford is or was the county town? The Banner talk\n\nI'm struggling to see how the above is either responsive to the comment it's replying to, or \"not splitting the discussion\". 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nIn fact, this should be the place to discuss this issue, that by now has spread over three articles. By you. And sorry to say so, unless you come up with sources to prove that Waterford is/was the \"county town\" and that Dungarvan is not any more the \"county town\", you are just creating drama. The Banner talk\n\nI'm particularly struggling to see how I'm causing \"drama\". I've pointed out consistency and sourcing issues with various articles, on those articles' talk pages. (You can hardly dispute that there being such issues, having yourself changed at least one of the articles in response.) I haven't added -- or even proposed adding -- unsourced claims; I haven't removed source-seeking tags; I haven't speedily reverted attempts to improve articles or flag up these issues; I haven't attributed malicious motives to people; I haven't used intemperate edit summaries. Would that everyone involved could say as much. Your claim that I've split the discussion doesn't bear up under any examination. There's a discussion at the original site of the issue. I've posted messages on other affected articles, pointing back to that discussion. What's entirely unhelpful is to insist that ground already covered there be retrod out of context, without addressing any of the material outstanding issues. 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nSee also the same page with regard to County Tipperary, where the merged council has two apparent administrative centres and meeting places, and the many related articles claim one, the other, or indeed both as \"county town\". With not so much as an up-to-date source between them. 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nThe councils' take\n\nAs alluded to on an article talk page, I emailed the two counties with multiple administrative centres. From Tipp, I happily have both a response, and the express OK to reproduce it here (minus names, etc):\n\n\"Further to your email dated 10th November 2014 in relation to the above matter, I wish to advise as follows;\n\nA number of the authoritative dictionaries define a 'County Town' as \"The town in which a county’s affairs are or were administered\". By that definition, both Clonmel and Nenagh continue to be the 'county towns' of Tipperary.\n\nI trust that this clarifies the situation for you.\"\n\nThere's a certain logic to that (as it's much the same as I've been saying), but it certainly doesn't speak to any particularly \"official\" such status, much less going any real way to getting it definitively sourced.\n\nI won't quote the response I got from Waterford in full, because I'm still waiting for a followup saying expressly that I can do so. (There's no confidentiality notice, but normal considerations would still apply.) I think I'm fairly safe, however, in saying that the essence of their reply was to refer to those things we're already noted can be securely sourced (their website; DoE), to wit the location of the corporate address of the new council, and that it works out of both sites. They did not, however, go into the above sort of dictionary exercise, and instead stated that for them county town status was \"not really relevant now\". 79.97.71.180 (talk)\n\nAre you familiar with WP:OR? The Banner talk\n\nI don't think this is original research, county towns have been around for centuries. Those in Ireland aren't called county towns very much any more, that's all.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nWe don't know what the original question was, nor are it prior published sources. The point is that mr. IP wants Waterford named as county town, but fails to give reliable sources. He just gives a personal interpretation. The Banner talk\n\nThe thing is, we are all familiar with the concept of original research. What I would like to know is, how much of what is on WP about county towns does not fall under NOR? In the County town article I count 23 citations (one arising from this discussion) for well over 100 counties, some with both current and past county towns. Do fully reliable sources exist for county towns in general, and if not, should we remove all reference in all articles to those that can't be reliably sourced, or should we use common sense, and – yes, I dare invoke the policy – ignore all rules?\n\nNow, the ref added to the County town article here includes the quote, \"Dungarvan, which is currently the 'county' town of Waterford County Council\". The scare quotes in the source were deliberate, as was the phrasing of the sentence, and there is nothing similar in the rest of the document when referring to eight other county towns. Thus, \"the 'county' town of Waterford County Council\" is not the same as \"the county town of Waterford\". To say that one implies the other is...well, it's just OR.\n\nIn short, I don't see why any reasonable person should have a problem with saying that both Dungarvan and Waterford have the status of county towns, especially given that the status means very little anyway.

As regards your question, I can't imagine why anyone would object. Scolaire (talk)\n\nPosting here is entirely proper according to WP:CANVASS. This is a project whose objective is to improve articles about Ireland, rather than promote a specific view. The project includes dozens of articles about terrorism in Northern Ireland and presumably some of the members of the project would know how expert sources describe it. TFD (talk)\n\nI just saw this now. As for \"entirely\", I'll paste here what I said yesterday at the article talk page. --Tryptofish (talk)\n\n\"Asarlaí: thank you, and I think that things are settling down now, so I have no remaining problem with any of this. What is more important than any remaining discussion about canvassing is that I hope that you will see my comments above, made before other editors showed up from the WikiProject, in which I had altered my opinion and, I hope, made some edits to the page that may help address your concerns. As for the WikiProject, it was very strange, from my perspective and in real time, to suddenly have multiple editors show up together, all with the same concerns, and without any apparent reason for that happening. That's where the canvassing policy comes into play. All you had to do was to note, here, that you had posted at the WikiProject, for transparency. Also, I very much stand by my concern that the header you used there, which was The Troubles as \"Christian terrorism\", used those quote marks in such a way as to indicate that, in your view, it was wrong to classify the The Troubles as Christian terrorism, so in a subtle way, that was not a neutral posting. I fully understand why TFD and Scolaire see the notice as neutral: because they agree with you that the classification is questionable. But that's still one of two sides to this discussion. There are plenty of ways to seek fresh eyes, including WP:RFC, WP:3O, or WT:WikiProject Terrorism or the other WikiProjects at the top of this talk page, which do not include the Ireland project. I asked at the Ireland project page whether anyone would have objected if, instead, I had posted a notice at WT:WikiProject Atheism (which I actually have no intention of doing). Had I done so, however, I could reasonably have expected that editors who are quick to see problems with religion would have come to this discussion and been eager to see The Troubles painted as a religious conflict. Even though, officially, the Ireland project is about improving content about Ireland in a neutral fashion, it's no coincidence that every editor who responded to your post makes a big deal on their user pages about their pride in their Irish identities, and so your post was a subtle way to reach out preferentially to editors who would be predisposed to object to characterizations of Irish conflicts that might seem negative to them. And the irony is that these editors showed up after I had already partly changed my mind and made edits agreeing with you. Síochána. --Tryptofish (talk) 15:51, 29 November 2014 (UTC)\"\n\nThank you for that. Can we draw a line under this now, please? Scolaire (talk)\n\nAgree. --Tryptofish (talk)\n\nTryptofish, please see my reply at the article talkpage. As Scolaire says, I hope we can now draw a line under this and get back to discussing the issues. ~Asarlaí\n\n[4] --Tryptofish (talk)\n\nA series of edits on the Éamonn Ceannt article were done today. They all look pretty kosher, but unfortunately they are not very well referenced, and some of the content is borderline unencyclopaedic. It looks like it may have been taken from the recently published \"16 Lives\" book. If somebody has the time and resources to check this I would be grateful. Scolaire (talk)\n\nIt comes across as pretty naive, but that well reflects Mr Kent/Ceannt himself. For example \"After finishing his schooling education he was presented with the opportunity to work for the civil service but turned this position down as he felt he would be working for the British. He went on to secure a job with the clerical staff of the City Treasurer and Estates and Finances office, he was working as an accountant with the Dublin Corporation from 1901-1916.\"\n\nWho comes up with these stories? The Corpo was supervised and usually subsidised by the \"Local Government Board for Ireland\" (1872-1922), so he was \"working for the British\".PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nWell, if somebody would edit it for style, that would be a good thing. There's no doubt the language in the edits is somewhat below the standard we've come to expect on WP. But mainly I'm concerned about verifiability. By all accounts, the \"16 Lives\" book is no great shakes, but it would count as a reliable source if it was what's being used here. I was kind of hoping somebody would have read the book and be able to say \"yes, that checks out.\" Scolaire (talk)\n\n... of the Gaelic warriors has arrived and has started changing English-language place names into Gaelic-language place names. By now, I consider it POV-pushing as (s)he is using rather silly arguments (rarely used Anglicized names, even when those names have 8 times more Google hits than the Gaelic ones) and altering the guideline Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Ireland-related articles to get the desired result. Help needed. An overview of the edits of user:Gaelmise can be found [5]. In the mean time, I do a step back. The Banner talk\n\nThis is hardily an unbiased summary of events, take Baile na hAbhann in Galway for example, the Irish language version is ahead in terms of hits over the English equivalent Ballynahown. Irish version has 200,000 hits, English version has 40,000 and the top page is a town in Westmeath. A more important point is that all Gaeltacht place names are no longer recognized by the state, and as such, official sources will use the Irish version of the place name instead of the anglicization. As for the change to the style guide, correct me if i'm wrong, but these are not rules set in stone. The change I made was done in good faith and intended to improve the guide, if someone disagrees, then they should discuss it, not go off an a rant about 'Gaelic Warriors'. It's fairly obvious that this issue has come up regularly in relation to Galetacht Place names, perhaps you should consider that there is a reasonable discussion to be had on this rather than cancelling any and all changes without debate. Gaelmise (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, though, Gaelmise, Wikipedia uses the common name, not the \"official\" name. So we have articles at Spiddal, not Spidéal, and at Dingle, not at either Daingean or Daingean Uí Chúis. Ballynahown would indeed seem to be an exception to the general rule that the English name is much more commonly used than the Irish name - probably because TG4 is located there. I doubt there are many more.\n\nGenerally the practice on WP would be to discuss a proposed change to a manual of style, rather than altering the guide and then arguing about it afterwards. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\ni am aware of the the common name practice, as I understand it the policy is based on the desirability to have the article title match the most prevalent place name in reliable English-language sources. The fact that the state does not recognize the anglicization of Gaeltacht place names has a significant impact on the name likely to appear in reliable sources in English dealing with that place. One of the most significant sources on information about the Gaeltacht is material produced by or on behalf of the state, these sources use the official name. Given this, there is a debate to be had as to weather it is better to use the Official name or the Anglicization. Perhaps you think more weight should be given to 100 daft.ie listings on google than 1 useful source about the area, but I think that would be foolish. In any case, the blind application of a rule and ranting about those who question its application is not helpfull. Gaelmise (talk)\n\n(edit conflict)\"As for the change to the style guide, correct me if i'm wrong, but these are not rules set in stone. The change I made was done in good faith and intended to improve the guide, if someone disagrees, then they should discuss it,\" - Wikipedia is a collaboration and any changes to guides should be done via consensus after discussion not by assuming you are correct and have the right to just go ahead and alter it to justify your own arguments and then say opponents need to discuss it. Also they are not rules, they are guidelines to help. This guideline has worked well for years I see no need for a change. Mabuska (talk)\n\nMy apologies if I went about it the wrong way, but the article on consensus does say that the best way to achieve consensus is to make an edit and work it out from there. As for the pre-existing guideline 'working well for years' a brief glance at the talk pages on the articles in question shows that its a guideline that has been regularly questioned when it comes to Galetacht place names. I'm not the first to raise this issue, as evidenced by the name of the section. If anything it seems that this has been a contentious issue. Gaelmise (talk)\n\nUnless controversial, then you should discuss it first. Going on the attack, as you did on my talk page, will not help your case. At least to me, it proves that you are not for a friendly and useful collaboration but to promote your point. You preferred to ignore the openings sentence: The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language, as you would find it in reliable sources (for example other encyclopedias and reference works, scholarly journals and major news sources). The Banner talk\n\nGaelmise, your changes are controversial and need to be discussed in advance. There is a process for requesting page moves - WP:RM - please use that in future and don't just revert other editors when they move a page back to its original location. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nThe thing is that this is the English-language wikipedia, and there's a perfectly good Gaelic wikipedia that can be linked on the left side of the page.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nThat \"English-language Wikipedia\" is a put-down I've been seeing for many years, and it's meaningless. If a place name such as \"Baile na hAbhann\" is commonly used in the English language, then it can be used on En-Wikipedia. We don't go to German Wikipedia to read about Berlin or French Wikipedia to read about Lyon. As for Gaeltacht place-names in general, that is a matter for discussion, not for glib one-liners. Scolaire (talk)\n\nI'm sorry, it's not intended as a put-down, just a reflection of the reality. If you look at the Gaelic page you'll see one footnote which has the name spelt as \"Ballynahown\" (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/EI/10/Ballynahown.html), which is telling. In pre-GPS days you could always get directions to Ballynahown, everyone around there knew what you meant.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nHave created this article.

Some of the pages currently in the category should perhaps simply be removed, if they were English and merely had an Irish title.\n\nThis task has been on the list for manual handling for some months, and the editor who made the nomination is no longer very active.

For example, if we ever had an article on the wife of my ancestor Arthur Dillon, Count Dillon, she was English-born with an Irish title of countess recognised in France.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nI've added a few more women, mainly Gaelic-Irish, to widen the scope.

His rationale is: \"In every single Wikipedia pages (except this one), the image sections of predecessing and sucessing polities would be left empty if it doesn't have an unanimous representation, or doesn't have a representation at all (like in this case). It is a universal common practice since the birth of Wikipedia. It is forgivable for users putting disputed flag/coat of arms in the image section, but insisting to type words in that section while that polity doesn't have a flag at all…the name of that polity is rather short so it's possible to fit in those words for this case, but there are also plenty of articles that have long names, it's thus unfeasible to use words as representations, therefore the section should be left blank under universal practice.

Mabuska (talk)\n\nIt looks OK now.PatrickGuinness (talk)\n\nI need some help. Could someone tell me who I should go to about harrassment on Wikipedia? There is another (almost certainly Irish) Wikipedian who continually reverts any additions I make to Wikipedia articles, even when I give exact references. Just a few days ago, I made a number of, if I say so myself, very informed, accurate and scrupulously referenced additions to the Wikipedia article on Castleblayney. This particular Wikipedian, I noticed today, has removed ALL my additions, reverting them all, even though they all had proper, academic references.\n\nI consider this behavior to be harrassment and I want it stopped. I want an independent adjudicator on Wikipedia to intervene in this long-running dispute. I want all my recent additions to the Castleblayney article to be reinstated in full, as, in this case, I have done absolutely nothing wrong. It is this kind of harassment that gives Wikipedia a bad name, as Jimmy Wales recently alluded to. I need help in this matter, as I don't know what to do or who to turn to. Laggan Boy (talk)\n\nDidnt see this til now. Well for those concerned for an update, I have gone through the Castleblayney article and re-instated the reference material removed some overlinking, and non-notable people for the list, also the entire music section (Laggan Boy didnt add). As for long running, I have engaged with this editor as an IP, then user, and still occasional IP, since shortly after I started editing on here, he has been on longer than I. He has improved vastly, but edits like this still crop up, as does overlinking. The editor has started since the new year to add WP:RS and references, but occasionally drifts back. Murry1975 (talk)\n\nPersonally, I dislike the practice of blanket reverting and then adding back, but there's no rule about it and no grounds for complaint. On the other hand, it is not polite to post a message in a forum like this making a complaint without informing the other party.\n\nThere certainly was overlinking. There was also an excessive tendency to add titles, and the refs were not well formatted. Having \"Kevin V. Mulligan, The Buildings of Ireland: South Ulster (popularly known as the Pevsner Guide to South Ulster), p. xxx. Yale, London, 2013\" in the ref list seventeen times is somewhat over the top. I have fixed that. Scolaire (talk)\n\nScolaire, do you know what am still crap at on here, doing the multiple refs to one and the like, after nearly four years. The dyslexia just gets the better of me, I try but end up adding in bear URLs mostly. Thanks for that. Murry1975 (talk)\n\nAgain????? Murry1975 (talk)\n\nI accept fully the comments of Scolaire as regards my references in the Castleblayney article. The reason I went 'OTT' with the references was to make sure that Murry1975 would have absolutely no grounds for reverting my edits. It made no difference. Murry1975 still reverted all my edits to that article. Laggan Boy (talk)\n\nThere's only one way around all this. Laggan Boy is no more. I'll still be knocking about, but in a different guise. I've been harassed out by Murry1975. This is the type of carry on that Jimmy Wales complained about recently. Hence, as Mr Wales pointed out, so few Wikipedians are either female or non-white. Laggan Boy (talk)\n\nTo be honest User:Laggan Boy, User:Murry1975 did reinsert some good information that had been removed for what seems like no real reason. But I wouldn't worry, you just have to learn to be better. I was harassed by a real republican asshole when I started on this site who plagued me but I got the last laugh when they couldn't nitpick my edits anymore. In fact I ended up being given \"autopatrolled\" status meaning I am trusted enough to create articles without the need for them to be approved by clerks as is the norm. Mabuska (talk)\n\nKnocking about, but in a different guise? That sounds a bit dodgy to me, to be honest. Scolaire (talk)\n\n'Knocking about' as in a different User Name and from a different computer, that's all, Scolaire. Nothing more sinister than that, I can assure you!! Life is too short for this kind of harassment that I am getting from the zealot that is Murry1975!! Life is just too short. Laggan Boy (talk)\n\nHmmm, you better read this: Wikipedia:Sock puppetry.

I've given him a cite to a relevant secondary source, Byrne's Irish Kings and High-Kings, which devotes a whole chapter to the question of Niall's historicity and the sources for it. He's demanded detailed cites of primary sources, and I've explained to him in the talk why that's inappropriate - that would be original research and way too detailed for a footnote in the lede, and most of the references to Niall in the annals are indirect, to his sons, but give us valuable information on the man himself, his dates and context. I've linked examples. But he just keeps putting the citation tag back in. Somebody help! --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nYour concept of the requirements to meet WP:OR is false. Citing primary sources is not original research. It is simply research. You did not cite any pages within your source, merely citing the entire book as your source. Citing books, when specific citations are requested is improper. Removing my request for a specific citation is also improper since you refuse to make any specific citation.Wjhonson (talk)\n\nYou could also address the issue by making these specific citations in the body of the text. But I believe citing a vague \"Irish annals\" in the lead would be a false way to force the question of his historicity. It begs the question, it appeals to false authority since the point of his historicity is the very point being glossed over.Wjhonson (talk)\n\n\"You did not cite any pages within your source, merely citing the entire book as your source.\" That's not true. The cite was not to a whole book, but to a chapter. And I told you that yesterday. I've caught you either knowingly lying or not reading my comments. I see no reason to respond to you further. --Nicknack009 (talk)\n\nAn editor, Gob Lofa, is intent on misquoting a source to present speculation as fact. Outside input would be appreciated to see whether their edit or my amendment better reflects the source and should be used. Discussion is at Talk:RUC_Special_Branch. Obviously due to the topic of the article it is sensitive, even if only recently created by Gob Lofa, hence the need for accurate quoting/paraphrasing. Mabuska (talk)\n\nIssue has been sorted. Mabuska (talk)\n\nA discussion is talking place on Category talk:Sinn Féin MPs. An editor wants to lump all Sinn Fein MPS from 1917 to 2015 in the same category. Snappy (talk)\n\nNot exactly. I have no problem with further sub-categorising by time periods. I do have a problem with any editor who tries to pretend a Sinn Féin MP wasn't a Sinn Féin MP at all. Gob Lofa (talk)\n\nCompletely mis-presenting my position as usual. I want Michael Collins to remain in Category:Early Sinn Féin politicians only, to avoid confusion with present Sinn Féin MPs. Simple as! Snappy (talk)\n\nBeing an MP is quite an achievement for a SF politician, and most don't make it that far; you're demoting him, essentially. By the way, your unilateral attempt to impose your own understanding of what constitutes a SF MP on the category page (without consensus) is subject to the same 1:RR rule as all Troubles-related articles, and it's pretty disingenuous of you to suggest that Provisional IRA members and veteran SF politicians have nothing to do with the Troubles. I suggest you revert yourself, unless you want people to think you're an arrogant boor who believes he can flaunt Wikipedia rules to his heart's content. Gob Lofa (talk)\n\nCan we stay on the substantial issue at hand, please? It's not helpful or productive to throw around 1RR warnings and the like. The easiest solution here would be just to break Sinn Fein MPs down into Sinn Fein MPs (pre-1983) and Sinn Fein MPs 1983-. Of course, the first category could be broken down further according to time period. Would you both agree with that? Valenciano (talk)\n\nPart of the problem is that Gob Lofa seems on a mission to de factor claim that Provisional Sinn Fein, is Sinn Fein historically. I'm open to two articles or a clear split in the article between them (per Valenciano) ----Snowded TALK\n\nAs I indicated above, I've no problem with that, Valenciano. Gob Lofa (talk)\n\n\"unless you want people to think you're an arrogant boor who believes he can flaunt Wikipedia rules to his heart's content.\" the hypocrisy is outstanding here. On topic, at the pointed out talk page. Mabuska (talk)\n\nNo question; given the double standard being applied to 1RR breaches, the hypocrisy is far surpassing its usual levels here. Gob Lofa (talk)\n\nClearly User:Gob Lofa needs to read The Mote and the Beam. Snappy (talk)\n\nJesus wept. You have some neck on you. Gob Lofa (talk)\n\nPot -> Kettle. Anyway, the category is now at: CFD -> Category:Sinn Féin MPs for Northern Irish constituencies.

Thryduulf (talk)\n\nSomething I asked at Talk:Caílte mac Rónáin, but now that I think of it, it seems more of a wikiproject question: It would help at this (and other such) articles to have a pronunciation guide. This given name seems to vary between /kweel-teh/ and /kyle-chuh/, depending on specific modern Hiberno-English dialect, with some intermediate forms, like /keel-chuh/ (the one I would have expected, at least for the Caoilte spelling, and perhaps /kyle-chuh/ for the Caílte spelling, from the Irish class I took once upon a time). Some source somewhere probably has an idea how it was pronounced in Old Irish. The family name seem to even out toward \"Roh-nine\", though I've also heard something approximating \"Roh-nawin\", and what I've been taught would lean toward that because of the accent on the á). Does WP:IRELAND have any kind of consistent approach to this sort of thing? Giving one exact pronunciation seems dicey, but giving three or more for each spelling would be overkill. Is it reasonable to provide a traditional Gaeltacht, vs Dublin standardized school-book, pronunciation? — SMcCandlish ☺ ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼\n\nWell, as you identify, the problem is dialect... there are very distinct differences between the various ones. I think Munster Irish is the \"official\" version taught in schools (rather than a \"Dublin\" Irish) but don't quote me on it. I'd agree with your interpretations on this example - the á would give an \"aw\" sound rather than a \"-ine\" sound. 21:49, 23 August 2015 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by Bastun (talk • contribs)\n\n(edit conflict)It would be good if articles on people and events that are in Irish had a phonetic pronunciation given afterwards, for to ordinary English speakers, they aren't the easiest things in the world to pronounce without some knowledge of Irish pronunciation. Mabuska (talk)\n\nTo clarify, the \"official\" version is the Caighdeán Oifigiúil. According to that article, \"many aspects of the Caighdeán are essentially those of Connacht Irish\", so Munster Irish is not the \"official\" version (\"Dublin Irish\" is usually used to refer to a bastardisation of the language by people with thick Dublin accents, and I would dispute the contention in the article that it is used to refer to the Caighdeán). At any rate, this does not solve the problem of pronunciation, as the Caighdeán only regulates spelling and grammar, and pronunciation differs from one region to another. Even if it were agreed that a single dialect (e.g. Connemara) be used for pronunciation guides, it would take somebody with both knowledge and dedication to change it in all the articles where pronunciation is given, not to mention policing it to stop people changing it to their own preferred pronunciation. Scolaire (talk)\n\nAh, yes, Connacht, not Munster, my mistake. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nAnd just to be awkward I'd request a Donegal dialect pronunciation be used for Ulster related articles ;-) Mabuska (talk)\n\nJust to notify I have raised an issue that does need sorted to stop it re-arising once again. Mabuska (talk)\n\nThis is an invitation to anyone so inclined to take a look at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home article. A good deal of work has been done recently by an editor whose viewpoint would appear to be somewhat transparent, and possibly less than well-informed. Righteous indignation without a view to underlying causes for what was probably not an isolated situation is all too similar to tabloid journalism. I leave this to those who may be interested. Mannanan51 (talk)\n\nI'd absolutely agree that more eyes from this side of the Atlantic are needed. A couple of Americans, who don't seem to understand that per capita headage payments per inmate from the state to private religious institutions should result in adequate levels of care, medication and nutrition, could certainly turn an article into a whitewashing exercise... They may not even be aware that 1947 data from the National Archives showed that, during the preceding twelve months, the death rate of children in Bon Secours was almost twice that of some other mother and baby homes, for example. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nThe article is almost devoid of balance. I put up one quote from the AP where it acknowledged its own reporting errors. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nIs there a better reference than very balanced David Quinn (columnist)? What exactly do you feel is \"unbalanced\" about the article? Some more useful material, including the reaction of the Bon Secours Sisters, is here. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nThe reference does not cite David Quinn. It cites AP. I've looked at AP itself but cannot find a direct quote. However, other websites also carry the retraction / apology. Use them if Mr. Quinn offends you. The lack of balance stems from the fact that the article relies heavily on the initial reports that have now been retracted by AP. It should, at the very least, exclude all material tainted by this (i.e. that remains covered by the AP retraction). Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nThe AP correction (not retraction) covers baptisms (that the children had not been batpised; and RC church teaching on baptism); and the claim that 800 bodies were found dumped in a septic tank. The article is very clear that this was what had initially been reported; that it was based on speculation never made by Corless; and that \"She [Corless] said the skeletons found in 1975 had most likely been in the septic tank,[3] but added that only 204 of the babies had died when the septic tank was in use, saying it \"seemed impossible\" that all of them could have been \"put in a working sewage tank\". So I think it's actually reasonably balanced. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nSo the speculation of one person is allowed to go unchecked? The fact that it may not be corroborated by the evidence is not to get equal weighting? As it stands, the article is weighted in favour of sensationalism, not sober assessment of the weight of evidence. Hence the need for balance from the other side. It is not the job of wiki to act as judge in the matter. However, where reasonable, sourced, verifiable opposing views are present, it is the job of wiki to give them due weight. Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\n\"However, where reasonable, sourced, verifiable opposing views are present, it is the job of wiki to give them due weight.\" - absolutley. The article does that - even to the extent of quoting from opinion pieces in Catholic newspapers. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nThe scales is weighed down by sensationalism on one side and a single instance of a retraction by the author of the same sensationalism on the other. Is that balance or due weight? Laurel Lodged (talk)\n\nApparently both the Irish Examiner and the HSE are \"scandal mongering.\" Again, more eyes needed on this article, from this side of the Atlantic. BastunĖġáḍβáś₮ŭŃ!\n\nI stumbled across a pdf of Lewis' Topographical Directory of Ireland on the Placenames Database of Ireland website at http://www.logainm.ie/en/res/98 Rather useful for Irish geography buffs if you don't have another source.
