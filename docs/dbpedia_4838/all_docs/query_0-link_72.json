Discover firsthand accounts of how Rockwell College has shaped the futures of its students and prepared them for success in the global arena.\n\n\"As an Irish national, born and raised in the Middle East, the thought of moving back to Ireland to go to Boarding School was a daunting thought. Any worries I had quickly evaporated once I stepped foot in Rockwell and its magnificent grounds for the first time. Living in dorms was an amazing experience, the facilities are comfortable and modern and - between the games room, cinema room, gym, lake...I could go on - it sometimes felt like a holiday! The pastoral staff and Deans at the residence were patient, thoughtful and understanding - they were well equipped to deal with any issues or homesickness that inevitably arises at some stage. Boarding at Rockwell, gave me an incredible opportunity to grow, as a young adult, a student and a sportsman. It was an incredible experience which I could not recommend enough - I am still in frequent contact with staff and my friends from my school days and will be for life!\" Daryl Egan, class of 2016\n\n\"During my five years of boarding Rockwell College played a pivotal role in shaping my future, bridging my upbringing in Bahrain with newfound experiences. Guided by excellence and inspired by the achievements of past alumni, Rockwell nurtured me to achieve my highest potential. It fostered a love of learning, an ability to manage my time efficiently and it is where I made lifelong friendships . I am so grateful for my time there setting the stage for my journey towards becoming an Olympian.\" Harry Mc Nulty, class of 2011\n\n“I was raised in the Middle East, my family lived in Bahrain and I did my primary education there too. When I was 13 I joined Rockwell and went straight into Second year as a full-time boarder. The culture shock wasn’t that hard, I’m half Irish/Filipino myself but also there were many other international students. In a sense, I felt very much at home in the boarding house whichever way I looked at it. My fellow boarders were from across Ireland and abroad, it was always fun and we created strong bonds over the years. The school itself was excellent and looking back now over 10 years later, they provide many opportunities and support. I’m dyslexic and was given the extra help I needed in the classroom and during study periods in the evening.” Jack Sutcliffe, class of 2011\n\n“Rockwell college provided me with an exceptional education through its academic programme. Being born and educated in the Middle East, returning to Rockwell for my final years of secondary education was a pivotal decision. In addition to its educational excellence, the college offers a multitude of sporting opportunities. I was fortunate to leave Rockwell with what have proved to be life long friends.” Shane Stapleton, class of 2000\n\nRockwell College Students Triumph at Tipperary County Final of Student Enterprise Programme\n\nOn Friday, February 23, the Tipperary County Final of the Student Enterprise Programme for secondary school entrepreneurs took place at TUS, Thurles.
