        "text": "Ruairí Henchy\n\nClooney's finest and 3-time Golden Cleric award winner Ruairí​ Henchy is the latest star to undergo the player profile treatment. Why do we love Ruairí? His greatest ever performance came in a Railway Cup game to secure club bragging rights for his Munster brothers (For a year) and he has always volunteered to help out the C team when they are in need. Those two facts alone tell you that he's a man who gets what Réalt Dearg is all about​. Read on for more inside information on the B team midfielder!\n\nThe victorious Munster team after Henchy single-handedly carried them over the line in the 2018 Railway Cup\n\n​Name: Ruairí Henchy\n\nAge: 31\n\nHometown: Clooney\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut? I have a very bad memory for these kind of things but I remember in either my first match or one of my first matches against Team X (I don't remember who they were but apparently we hate them). Coach Mulkere explained to us in the dressing room beforehand that there are three occasions when nothing should need to be said before a match to get people psyched up. Those were: for the first match of the year; for a knockout championship game; and for when we're playing Team X - and he said that anybody who didn't understand that might as well get the fuck out of the dressing room right now. Anyway I had the good sense not to take him literally and I'm still happy playing for the club three or four years later.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? The effort so many people put in to keep things going off the pitch. It's a great example of all of the good things in the GAA and doesn't have the politics or bickering that normal parish clubs in the countryside will always have a bit of.\n\nFavourite position? I've played a bit in every position on the pitch throughout the years and although they're very difficult positions I like the freedom you can have playing centre back, midfield or centre forward. If your team is on top and you get good ball then corner forward can be a dream as well.\n\nPrevious club? Clooney.\n\nWhat other sports have you played? Hurling was number one with the club at home but I also played football and handball and I've dabbled in many other sports.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV show? About the House with Duncan Stewart.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? I don't know but I always thought that if Joyce, Keats and Lawrence were sitting in a room together and Dostoevsky walked in there'd be a hell of a fight for the last piece of pudding so I'd like to put that one to the test.\n\nWhat would you like to improve about your game? Catching high ball. I was amazed at how quickly Eric the AmERICan (see what I did there) mastered so many of the skills of the game, not least catching high ball, that so many of us who have been playing for more than 20 years never managed and we probably just decided in our teenage years that that was us as hurlers and we just weren't good at this or that and we'd get by.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? All the usual.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? (Hurling, non hurling, or both!) If you don't win the throw-in you might as well go home.\n\nWhat's your favourite sporting memory? Winning the Clare minor championship.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be................... still around hopefully. A lot of clubs like ours have come and gone but a lot of planning and work has been done behind the scenes to secure our future. No fault.\n\n​\n\nRichie Kelly\n\nThe greatest hurler of all time when it comes to coordinating togs and jersey, Richie is as stylish on the ball as he is with his gear. One of the new generation of 2019 recruits, Richie found his place at midfield and helped drive us to the Junior E semi-final last year. More importantly he's already a regular in the Terenure Inn and the lovely Mrs.Kelly has given the club their most committed supporter since John O'Callaghan, with a much better accent. So grab a beer and see what Richie Kelly has to say about the GAA and his time with RD so far.\n\nName:\n\nRichie Kelly\n\nAge:\n\nOlder than I care to admit\n\nHometown:\n\nPaulstown, Kilkenny\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?\n\nFirst round of the league vs Thomas Davis at home. Gahan ensured I had the authentic Réalt Dearg experience by getting sent off. Oh the things he called that ref.......\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?\n\nThe inclusiveness & no fault culture. It doesn't matter what your skill level is, everyone is welcome and you get a load of game time. Everyone is encouraging and there's no negative BS. As long as you love hurling & a bit of craic, it's the ideal club.\n\nFavourite position?\n\nAnywhere in the forwards or in midfield. If I had to pick, I'd say somewhere in the full forward line.\n\nWhat was your previous hurling club?\n\nThe mighty Willamette Hurling Club in Portland, Oregon. Joined the club there after not playing for more than a decade for various reasons. Made a heap of lifelong friends road tripping around the Pacific Northwest playing hurling with tournaments where you play 2 or 3 games in the one day. Honourable mention to the other clubs that I played with in various tournaments, Seattle Gaels, Tacoma Rangers, Corvallis, Columbia Red Branch and the Montana clubs.\n\nWhat other sports have you played?\n\nPlayed a lot of soccer, as well as a bit of basketball & golf too..... even a bit of gaelic football in Kilkenny would you believe\n\nWhats your favourite memory playing hurling?\n\nScoring my first goal for the club vs Sylvesters last year was a good one, but I would say my favourite memory is winning a tournament in Butte, Montana on a pitch that was covered in snow when we started. It was so cold that icicles formed under the cars while the games were being played. On the way back to the hotel afterwards, legitimately considering asking to be dropped off at an A&E for hypothermia (and/or the lack of being able to breathe properly because we played 3 games at high altitude), but instead going for pints.\n\nWhat current player would you recruit for Réalt Dearg?\n\nTJ Reid is absolutely class. He could do a Gary Hurney on it for us for years to come! Wouldn't mind Aaron Gillane or Seamie Callanan either.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?\n\nThe TV is exclusively for sports.... but oddly enough during this whole pandemic thing when there wasn't a hint of a sporting event, I ended up watching an unholy amount of The Chase believe it or not - not sure why! Also enjoyed The Last Dance about the Chicago Bulls on Netflix too.\n\nWhat American Sports star would make the best hurler?\n\nDoes Eric Lee count as an American Sports star or does his retractable glue covered paw rule him out? If so.... I'd say Damian Lillard - one of the top NBA players and not bad at the whole hip-hop/rap thing. One of those people with a rare mentality that you know means they'd be good at anything.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party?\n\nTommy Walsh (for the craic), Sir Alex Ferguson (for the stories) & Michael Jordan (because he's the GOAT)\n\nWhat would you like to improve about your game?\n\nHigh fielding, first touch, striking, accuracy, physicality, quicker reading of the breaking ball, speed, agility, work rate, hooking, blocking, fitness, speed. If I could improve all those things a lot, I'd be OK.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?\n\nI'm into motorsport & like to go karting now and again. Obviously watch a lot of other sport too.....NBA, rugby, soccer (basically any sport except Cricket). Would also be known to play a bit of poker, read any sports related books & play a few games on the playstation or PC\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? (Hurling, non hurling, or both!)\n\nNever be afraid to fail\n\nWhat's your favourite sporting memory?\n\nHard to pick one in particular, but I'd have to go with the All-Ireland in 2008 (sorry to the Deise lads). One of the best team performances I've ever seen live... skill, pace, power & unreal work rate.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be...................\n\nRunning out of space in our trophy cabinet. After we buy a trophy cabinet. And our own club grounds.\n\n​\n\nBrian 'CHUBBA' Gavin\n\nMarathon runner, wordsmith, virtually every executive position going, corner back, Tony Kelly's cousin. Brian Gavin is many things to many people, but to us he's Chubba. For ten years he has been cursed by out of shape teammates as he storms around Stepaside and Drimnagh, training as hard as most of us play. The ultimate clubman, he has played for all 3 teams and can regularly found in the Terenure Inn belting out his catchphrases \"I am Irish life!!\" and \"Your chips taste like peas\".* You've all read his puntastic match reports, now strap yourself in for Chubba's mile-a-minute player profile.\n\n*Both actual quotes\n\nName/Nickname: Brian Gavin but I have been called Chubba since I was about 10, which has given me a ferocious complex about putting on the lbs.\n\nAge: 35 and 5/12ths\n\nHometown: Ballynacally, Co. Clare\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?: Made my debut in June 2010 against Naomh Mearnóg in a game which included the normally mild-mannered club-founder Liam Lanigan getting sent off for using very un-parliamentary language for a Joycean scholar, despite not even being on the field at the time. We lost the game, but I figured the club was going somewhere if it could fire up the passions of an English professor so much. It was also the beginning of the “they hate ye lads” template copied and pasted for numerous other Dublin clubs over the years.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?: The inclusiveness. It doesn’t matter one bit where you’re from, what your GAA background or ability level is, or what the Tipperary lads have done with their sister-cousins, everybody is accepted as long as they are prepared to buy into things. The fact that all teams still train together ten years on is a huge part in this ethos. This was most clearly shown the night we got to train in Parnell Park before the 2017 county final where everybody who wanted could get a run out on the pitch (Evidence is posted below!) I know the camaraderie and craic has meant I have definitely stayed in Dublin longer than I ever intended when I moved up here.\n\nFavourite position?: In a real match, I probably prefer midfield but my favourite position really is the free-roaming non-position that everybody plays in during small-sided training games.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)?: Clondegad for football and Ballyea for hurling\n\nWhat's your favourite music?: Questionable 90s dance classics and 70s rock. Faithless meets Fleetwood Mac type of thing.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?: NFL Redzone\n\nName your top 3 Réalt Dearg singers?: Rúairí Henchy, Leon Flanagan and Colm O’Gorman. Ronan Moloney has been docked points for his repeated butcherings of I am the Walrus and Psycho Killer.\n\nWhat inter county players would you like on the Réalt Dearg team? Gary Brennan, Tony Kelly and Conor O’Droma now that he has abandoned what he started.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game?: I would like to get on the scoresheet more, which is proving difficult from the full-back line. I would love to have the same amount of Hollywood in my game as Ronan Moloney.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?: I run a lot – an unhealthy amount for a grown man really. I also have a chronic addiction to Supermac’s burger sauce which sort of balances things out.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?: Don’t be afraid to look like an idiot.\n\nWhat's your favourite Réalt Dearg memory?: The best feeling ever after coming off a pitch was the night in August 2010 when we won our first championship game against Fingallians, in the quarter final we qualified for because there were only 8 teams in the competition and which ended up being our first match under floodlights because of serious traffic issues getting there that evening. I remember scoring a point from out on the wing in front of the RD dug-out with a few minutes left, which either put us ahead or two points up, and getting swarmed by our subs. The session in Terenure late into that night, and that weekend was magic.\n\nWhat’s your favourite non-Réalt Dearg GAA memory?: See post #33 of this thread on boards.ie: https://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=112009464\n\nWhat’s your favourite Réalt Dearg non-GAA memory?: Too many to choose from, but highlights include Mick Conlan sitting on his bar stool in the middle of Terenure cross-roads, Cian O’Brien and his tractor joy-ride through the streets of Dublin, Gahan’s dad taking on all comers in the stand in Parnell Park, Gahan’s escapades in general, Martin Murphy falling over backwards trying to take a free while steamed in Dresden, Ronan Moloney in tears when I handed him the #7 jersey after coming back from his cruciate injury.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?: I’ve been fortunate enough to play with both Gary Brennan and Tony Kelly in hurling and football – they are certainly the most talented I’ve played with at both games. But the most effective footballer was clearly the 2011-12 vintage Shane Murphy who scored about 18-2 over that period with the boot. He was never the same once he figured out how to use the hurley.\n\nIn 10 years’ time Réalt Dearg will be: All-Ireland club champions in at least one grade, still run by the players, most of which haven’t even joined yet. And also still be having cameo appearances from Cian O’Brien as he returns home for a summer holiday from trying to civilise the natives in some far-flung part of the world\n\n​Chris Hill (Scottish Chris)\n\nThe club's first ever Scot, Chris came along with Brendan 12 months ago, but we didn't hold it against him. He was a good sport about a mildly sectarian joke at his first session and since then has hardly missed training or the Tinn. A deserved \"Most Improved Player\" award winner last year, we found out more about what makes Chris tick.\n\n*​The only available Chris pictures were decidedly blurry, but they're still better than that creepy picture of Bernard with Aussie Gleeson that was on the page before.\n\nName:\n\nChris Hill\n\nAge:\n\n29\n\nHometown:\n\nBathgate (Sco) – Home of Susan Boyle, Lewis Capaldi and the inventor of chloroform no less.\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?\n\n2019 season – first C game\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?\n\nMix of skill level and background – great environment, training and set up for all skills levels and experience. It’s been really good for me to pick up the game quickly and the club’s doors are open to all backgrounds, although may be best to keep any football allegiances\n\nquiet.\n\nFavourite position?\n\nSomewhere in the full forward or half forward line where I get to run.\n\nWhat other sports have you played?\n\nFootball (the proper one, not GAA), rugby, golf and anything else to keep myself amused.\n\nHow did you first discover hurling?\n\nPeer pressure.\n\nHow would you describe Realt Dearg and Hurling, to your friends from home?\n\nSurprisingly violent.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?\n\nArrested Development.\n\nWhat Scottish Sports star would make the best hurler?\n\nOne of our many top Shinty players – [insert name of top Shinty player here] – they don’t\n\nhappen to be household names.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party?\n\n3 religious leaders to see who has the most rounded view on the world and best sales pitch– let’s start with the Dalai Lama, the Pope and Tom Cruise.\n\nWhat would you like to improve about your game?\n\nUnderstand all of the rules.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?\n\nRunning, following all sorts of sports and trying to find the best Guinness in Dublin.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? (Hurling, non hurling, or both!)\n\nIf in doubt, just kick it forwards – mainly hurling, summing up my current skill level with the ball on the deck.\n\nWhat's your favourite sporting memory?\n\nFootball (soccer) related but probably shouldn’t provide full details.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be...................\n\nCompleting further expansion of the seating capacity at the “field of Drims” following unprecedented public demand, but for some reason not car parking capacity.\n\n​\n\nBERNARD HERLIHY\n\nHe may have played in the forwards at first, but we always knew he was a keeper. Manning the goal is the latest chapter in a colourful career (they say he once held John Mullane scoreless for 3 seconds in training) but what makes Bernard Herlihy tick?\n\nName/Nickname: Bernard Herlihy\n\nAge: 31 per birth cert, 61 per fitness levels\n\nHometown: The mighty Deise\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?: 2016 vs Peregines (spelling prob needs to be checked on that one)\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?: The welcoming of all comers regardless of age/ability/nationality and collective hatred of Dubs and football\n\nFavourite position?: Edge of either square.

Brian Cody and Alex Ferguson to see them bounce off each other and JFK to hear the Marilyn Monroe stories.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game?: Fitness and actually able to catch a looping high ball.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?: Armchair sports supporter in general and going to matches.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?: Practice doesn't make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Brian Phelan's sideline cut in Parnell Park for De La Salle in All Ireland Club semi final which helped the club to run out on Paddys Day in Croke Park. From a county view, beating Kilkenny in Thurles after so many near misses over the years\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?: Going for pure skill on this one, Hurling is Paul Flynn, he could make a ball talk and mainly did it because it was less running. Football is Maurice Fizgerald, I was in Thurles the day he curled over the sideline vs the Dubs, a beautiful sight.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be: On a run to club all Ireland glory!\n\n​\n\nConor Maharaj\n\nName/Nickname: Conor Maharaj\n\nAge: 27\n\nHometown: Kilkenny\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut? 21st July 2015 away win to Naomh Olaf\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?: ​Great balance between hurling and working life.\n\nFavourite position?: Anywhere I can go for a jog around the pitch.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)?

Although the best piece of advice I've ever heard was \"If he pulls across you like that again, make sure you pull twice as hard back\" Colm Gahan.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory?:\n\nWinning the U-14 feile competition in Kilkenny against Thomastown Gaa (Jamie O'Hara). We drew against them the first match after a far harder qualification match than them the previous day. We then went out a week later and bet them by 12 points.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?:\n\nTommy Walsh - 3 All Stars in 3 different positions, need I say more. Football's not a real sport.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be:\n\nHurling Senior and I'll be doing a Gary Hurney on it (Few matches in the goal and a few matches in the full forward line making everyone else look good).\n\n​\n\nTomas 'Mossy' O'Mahoney\n\nTwo full years in the red and black, and he's already fundraised and topless danced his way to the very top. He goes by many names, (most of them invented by Cathal Mulkere) but to us he's simply Mossy.\n\nName/Nickname: Tomas O’ Mahoney (Mossy)\n\nAge: 33\n\nHometown: Glenbrien, Co. Wexford\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?: March 2017 against Counsel Gaels, the pitch was like a bog, it was pissing rain and it resembled more of a wrestling match than a hurling match. Coupled with that, efforts to turn me into a free scoring forward were quickly scrapped because I was shite and back to the backs I went.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?: It’s a home away from home for people, there is always someone up for doing something if you are at a loose end. On the pitch we have been relatively successful in my time here and who doesn’t love winning matches!\n\nFavourite position?: Midfield/Wing back – I love the freedom just to be able to go hunt the ball constantly\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)?: Oylegate/Glenbrien back in Wexford and Central Coast in Sydney\n\nWhat's your favourite music?: Love rock music/anything with an electric guitar and drums – Muse, Kasabian, Royal Blood the list is endless\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?: Billions, Entourage, The West Wing\n\nName your top 3 Réalt Dearg singers?: I thought about this long and hard and I didn’t want to offend RoMo so I’ve decided to say they are all good in their own way\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Réalt Dearg team? Daithi Burke purely to watch Gahan try take lumps out of him in training. If that’s not an option then Joe Canning, the man is a magician\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party?: Tommy Walsh because he would keep everyone laughing\n\nMargot Robbie because she would surely fall for me, right?\n\nThen David Attenborough so we could throw on a documentary after dessert (not a metaphor for anything going on with me and Margot) and get a live narration.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game?: I was told there was a word limit on this piece – Probably striking, seeing something and executing it are two completely different things\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?: All other sports really, documentaries, getting out for a few pints and some live music\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?: In Hurling – Don’t drop the fu$king ball, In life – It’s a numbers game\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory?: I’d love to say the 1996 All-Ireland but I don’t remember it properly so I’m going to go with Mick Jacobs last second goal to beat Kilkenny in 2004\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?: Easily Tommy Walsh he had everything and I don’t think there is anyone who could come close to being as good as him in all the positions he was brilliant in. Football, what’s that? Did we not burst those??? Go on then Ciaran McDonald, different class\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be: Still pulling up trees and ruffling feathers within Dublin GAA circles due to their success\n\n​\n\n​Gary Hurney\n\nName: Gary Hurney\n\nAge: 37\n\nHometown: Turloughmore - Galway Tidy Town's winner 1886\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?: 2 years ago, 19th April 2015, home defeat to St.Sylvesters.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?: That every other team in Dublin hurling has no time for us, and somehow, that makes it all the more sweeter when we succeed\n\nFavourite position?: Nowadays, full-forward I think...don't have the young legs anymore\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)?: Football: Claregalway\n\nHurling: Turloughmore + various international clubs on my travels\n\nWhat's your favourite music?: Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Metallica...bring me back to that '90s scene!!\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?: Family Guy - sums up my humour right there\n\nName your top 3 Réalt Dearg singers?:\n\n#3.

Jesus Christ - he'd have some cool party tricks, like walking on water then turning it into wine\n\n#2. Judas Iscariot - for the resulting craic...see guest #1\n\n#3. Seth MacFarlane - because he'd script one hell of a show based on the punch up!!\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game?: Be more selfish, and stop making heroes out of Jamie O'Hara and Martin Murphy!!\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?: Movies and music...I'd watch any sport and probably bet on it too, & I do like my horse racing\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?: Make your opponent expect the unexpected off you, always keep him guessing what you're going to do next\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory?: Sunday afternoons at home as a kid in the late '80s watching live hurling games on The Sunday Game on RTE...especially Galway's good times of '87 & '88, watching my then hero & neighbour, Martin Naughton, win two All-Irelands...Christ, seems an awful long time ago now...\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?: Very tough question, but I'll go with players I had the honour to play against in club champo, and in football that was Pádraic Joyce of Killererin/Galway...simply unmarkable when in full flow, could kick points from any angle with a great footballing brain.\n\nAnd in hurling, I'd have to say Joe Cooney of Sarsfields/Galway...was near the end of his career when I played against him, but he was an absolute joy to watch. A magician with a sliotar...it always seemed to be attracted to him like a magnet & could make it talk, it just went exactly where he wanted to put it. A man who didn't read the game, he wrote it!!\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be: Acting as a character witness for Colm Gahan, following a failed attempt to set up a camogie team which resulted in numerous allegations towards him\n\n​Kieran \"Mushie\" O'Brien\n\nName: Kieran \"Mushie\" O'Brien\n\nAge: 25\n\nHometown: Shanagarry, Co.

It's really simple.\" - Coach Gahan pre-match team talk vs Kilmacud Crokes\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory?

First of many times I’ve been told ‘they hate ye lads’. They did too.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg?

Joe Canning / Diarmuid Connolly\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be................... Based on Castleknocks rate of progression and Droma’s managerial success this year I think we have a great chance of playing senior football in that timeframe.\n\n​Dave Sheehan\n\nNext up is a proud son of Cork. He's not sure when he started but he's planning on sticking around. Dave Sheehan, this is your player profile....\n\nName: Dave Sheehan\n\nAge: 31\n\nHometown: Castlelyons in the great county of Cork\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?\n\nNot 100% sure! Two games stand out though. First game I scored in for Realt Dearg was against Civil Service. An incredibly badly hit free that snuck in over the keepers head at the back post that even had the Ref laughing at me. 2nd memorable game was our first C game against Whitehall. Was only 12 of us against 13 so we won’t talk about the result but was a great start to the C team.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg\n\nHow open the club is to lads of all levels and to new members in general. Able to bring lads down and you know that regardless of their level of skill that they will be made welcome.\n\nFavourite position?\n\nGoing to say wing forward. Not a fan of the running there but bit of craic.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)?\n\nCastlelyons. Home of the “Great” Timmy McCarthy. Great club to be in when younger when in 1997-1998 we won the Junior County and then the Intermediate County back to back. Made it as far as a Senior semi-final before got slaughtered by the Blackrock team that had 5/6 of the Cork team on it.\n\nWhat's your favourite music?\n\nListen to a bit of everything from Punk to Classical. Big fan of brand new, the foo fighters, kings of leon, and Little Green Cars.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show?\n\nThought that the Wire was unreal.\n\nName your top 3 Realt Dearg singers?\n\nFirst going to have to say Leon. The man of many talents.Other than that I suppose Maloney has to get a mention for his sheer effort if nothing else.\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team?\n\nTough question. Going to say Ronan Maher from Tipp. Very hard working player who does the simple things well and is a good man to clear ball. Since he only u-21 should get the guts of 20 years out of him too.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party?\n\nMarilyn Monroe just to see if she really was all that. Elvis Presley because he would be great craic and Denis Irwin because think he one of the best sportsmen Cork has ever produced.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game?\n\nFirstly speed! Not sure exactly when lost it but would like it back! Confidence on the ball too. Time is short enough on the ball without 2nd guessing myself!\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA?\n\nBig fan of music and comedy gigs. Used to do a lot of Swimming and water polo so still interested in that. Other than that the bit of travel and reading and that.\n\nWhat’s your favourite Realt Dearg motivational speech/mantra?\n\nFavourite motivational speech was from Maloney at the first Railway cup. Been heard a few times before and since but “they hate ye lads” always enough to get me going.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?\n\n“We’re here for a good time not a long time.” Applies to pretty much all of life.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory?\n\nThink the 1999 all Ireland final against Kilkenny. Was the first time I was in Croke Park on all-Ireland Sunday and was a great day for the parish.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?\n\nControversial choice but gonna say Wayne Sherlock. An incredible player who did the basic things perfectly. Even managed to make Sully look good. Should have been picked as captain the year Alan Browne was but it wouldn’t be Cork without some politics.\n\nRichie Power second for his skill and incredible work rate but can’t be giving it to a Kilkenny man.\n\nBest footballer a toss up between Trevor Giles and Colin Corkery. Giles for his skill and work rate and Corkery for his ability to slot points over from 50 yards out.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be...................\n\nUp to 6/7 teams as I for one am going nowhere!\n\n​Kevin Danger Deady\n\nContinuing our series of \"quiet men of the club\", next up is a man who has made a big impact on and off the pitch. A true gael, proud Dublin supporter, a wearer of Hurling Helmets in airports. A lot of people don't even know his name is Kevin! \"Danger\" this is your player profile.....\n\nName: Danger\n\nAge: 38\n\nHometown: Our Nations Capital and Current All Ireland Football Champions - Dublin\n\nWhen did you make your Réalt Dearg debut?\n\nDay 1 – Against Commercials.

Recipient of the finest birthday cake ever, he knows his music and likes to play a round. Lets meet Kevin McEvoy!\n\nName: Kevin McEvoy\n\nAge: 30\n\nHometown: Tramore\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? I think it was against Lucan in a challenge game. I was new to the club obviously, but also completely new to hurling. I still remember when I was being brought on being asked what position I played and saying “I’ve never played before”. And I played like I’d never played before too. But it was my best performance up to that point.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg As everyone else says – the universal acceptance in the club. I don’t think many clubs would welcome in so many new hurlers at any age and it’s one of the great strengths of the club.\n\nFavourite position? Wing back. Plenty of action there to get involved in a game and unlike corner back if your man beats you to a ball he’s not through on goal!\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? Tramore golf club. Hence the easy to hook swing!\n\nWhat's your favourite music? Probably Baroque\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? I like the Political ones. If I’m looking for something light maybe The West Wing. Or if I’m looking for something a bit more realistic Yes, Minister.\n\n​\n\nName your top 3 Realt Dearg singers? Leon Flanagan number 1 obviously. James Doyle has a lovely timbre, I’d give him number 2. And I can’t think of a number 3, but if I could go all the way to number 7 I’d have to pick Ronan Moloney.\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team? I think Aussie Gleeson would really add something to the C team if he could be convinced.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? Padraig Harrington – as interesting a sportsman as you can listen to. Tiger Woods – I’d love to know where he got his stamina from. Most golfers go home after 18 holes, but it was never enough for him. And Oliver Reed, because talking about golf gets boring after a while and he seemed like unreal craic!\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? Striking. Especially on my bad side, but also on my not quite as bad side. Striking on the run and striking under pressure. In fairness, from a stationery position in about 30 yards of space on my good side not too far out from goal in dry and non-windy and not too cold conditions I’m pretty dangerous.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? GAA takes up a lot of my free time! If I ever hang up the boots I might get back into playing golf and the cello.\n\nWhat’s your favourite Realt Dearg motivational speech/mantra? The Robocop pre-Railway cup match speech (e-mail). That was a magical e-mail – one of those where you can’t help but hear the voice of the writer when reading it. In fact, read is the wrong word. You sing that e-mail\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? In hurling I assume? Not to worry about mistakes. Get to the ball first and if you miss it worry about recovering then.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Munster final 1998 Paul Flynn’s goal from the 21 metre free. I jabbed a few people with my Waterford flag after we’d scored it.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Best hurler – Ken McGrath.

To be better at fielding the ball.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? Music, reading and acting the malley.\n\nWhat’s your favourite RealtDearg motivational speech/mantra? I think I have seen all the greats - the naked speech, the yeast infection,\n\nShabs’ various ‘I hate talk but…’ speeches. My favourite is Mike Butler telling the team that he would pull off the next fella who went up with one hand on the hurley… promises, promises\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? If it doesn’t come up first time..pull on it… it was hurling advice I think!\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Limerick hurlers have given me more painful ones than great onesunfortunately, winning the Munster Final in 2013 was great considering it hadn’t happened since 1996.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Best hurler – DJ, Best Footballer – the Gooch. No points for originality I know.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be................... the reason the solicitors, publicans and therapists of Dublin are all driving high end automobiles.\n\n​Cathal Mulkere\n\nPart of the notorious Clare Mafia, the inventor of the phrase \"No fault\", Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh impressionist, music appreciator and keen enthusiast on public transport and infrastructure. Cathal Mulkere, take it away....\n\nName: Cathal Mulkere\n\nAge: 30\n\nHometown: Crusheen, Co. Clare\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against?

One of my favourite pastimes however is discussing the top 5 roundabouts, pedestrian crossings and bus stops in Limerick city with Mike Butler, Eoin “Ninja” O’Dwyer and Barry “Twig” Horan via email on Wednesdays. Yes, that does actually happen amidst significant trolling and hurling discussion.\n\nWhat’s your favourite Realt Dearg motivational speech/mantra? I thought we’d never recover from the loss of Doctor Liam Lanigan with his poetic words and grandiose ideology. Then Colm Gahan spoke at a C match one day and I was simply blown away! Gone are the days of the Leitrim contingent giving us words of wisdom in the nip when we’d nowhere to look...\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? “You have to put your head Sunday where you wouldn’t put the crowbar Monday” – the legendary Tom Mac from Crusheen\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? I grew up in Clare in the 90s and witnessed Crusheen’s first every county championship win in 2010 which was particularly memorable. They were all great days but with regards to Realt Dearg, winning our first championship match against Fingallians was brilliant in 2010. Everything suggested we’d struggle in that game but we gave one of our best performances and it was a key building block for the club.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Henry Shefflin, Kilkenny. Colm Cooper, Kerry\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be................... hopefully progressing further up the divisions and winning trophies.

Take it away Martin...\n\nName: Martin Murphy\n\nAge: 30\n\nHometown: Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? I can’t recall name of the exact team, but if I recall correctly I appeared as a sub for the last 30 seconds or so and never looked back since!\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg The whole cosmopolitan and diversity amongst its members and players alike – That being said, we had Conor O’Droma asking as to the whereabouts of County Waterford recently after training.\n\nFavourite position?

Lets meet them. First up its the Kilkenny version, self confessed nerd, hipster football fan and John Travolta enthusiast....\n\nName: Martin Murphy\n\nAge: 28\n\nHometown: Ballycallan Co. Kilkenny\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? Not sure but it was some Irish speaking team we played in a challenge in stepaside in 2013. Not sure if that narrows it down much! Think the first league game I played was in Thomas Davis against Thomas Davis.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg Getting to play hurling for a club that actually cares about hurling as its first sport.\n\nFavourite position? Corner or wing forward. I like to score goals and because it’s such a rarity it makes it all the more special when it happens. Not sure the rest of ye would agree!\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? I played for Graigue Ballycallan underage up as far as Minor then gave up for a few years and started again for Clonguish Gaels in Longford for a year. I played on the county team for Longford so I like introduce myself as an ex-county hurler from Kilkenny and let peoples imagination do the rest. After that I played for college in DIT for a year and then found my true home away from home in Realt Dearg.\n\nWhat's your favourite music? Leaning towards 90’s rock and older.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? At the moment it’s Parks and Recreation but just started watching Arrested Development and its hilarious!\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team? I’d say Ger Aylward.

Jesus to bring the wine, Genghis Kahn for some light dinner conversation and Kate Middleton to do the dishes after.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? I’d score more.

I’m studying nutrition and dietetics and love it. Also enjoy powerlifting and coaching for weightlifting. Bit of a science nerd.\n\nWho is the worst/laziest to train in Realt Dearg? It might be easier to list those who aren’t lazy! Nah I kid. I think the standard of fitness of the club has improved since I started and I definitely think that’s in part due to everyone putting it in hard at training. Now that’s a safe answer.\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received? From my granddad “Never be afraid to stick your body in front of the hurl, most lads will try not to hit ya, and if they do hit ya then you’ll have blocked them!!” Two broken hands, a fractured thumb and a sprained ankle later and I’m a little less confident that this was good advice. Apparently (according to granddad) the Tullaroan hurlers would train this as an actual blocking technique and that’s why they’re hardened to almost godlike proportions. I should mention my Granddad is a devout follower of Tullaroan and believes all past Kilkenny losses were due to a lack of Tullaroan players on the team and all victories were due primarily to Tommy Walsh.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? 2011 All Ireland Richie Hogans goal against Tipp. Great touch.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? DJ Carey probably or depending what you’re looking for King Henry of course! Favourite footballer has to be Kilkenny footballing legend Paul Donnelly for holding Dermot Early to just 2 points in their mammoth clash against the Lily Whites.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be...................

On the pitch? – Anywhere in the forwards (I like to be on the attack!).\n\nOff the pitch? – Feet up, listening to music or pucking balls in Bushy.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? RD is my first (I’m one of life’s late-starters) and at this stage, probably my only club.\n\nWhat's your favourite music? I have eclectic taste, don’t follow bands anymore (gave that up in the 80’s). Like any style from classical to pop as long as the melody is good.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? Watching “The Killing” (American version) at the moment – excellent! But for sheer timeless genius it’s got to be “Father Ted”. I laugh from start to finish at it.\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team? No preference really, as long as they don’t take my place!\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? Probably would go with dead people – they eat less! My three would be:\n\nAdolf Hitler – Would be interesting to hear his humorous side and I bet he’d give a great after-dinner speech. Would need to keep the wine-glasses well away from him though.\n\nDermot Morgan – Comic genius and if Adolf was disappointing, he could step-in with a great impression here.\n\nOn a serious note – my Dad. He’d probably give out to me for inviting the first fella, but what wouldn’t I give to see him one more time.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? Nothing. It’s perfect! (Just kidding). No, I’d like to keep working on taking the right option under pressure and I’d like to improve the quality of my striking, again under pressure. Also, I’d like to throw the ball a little less, or not at all even?\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? Apart from running around the place after 5 children, I like to go for walks with my wife Eilis and of course, the odd pint or two with the lads now and again. I also like to strum the guitar when I’ve time.\n\nWho is the worst/laziest to train in Realt Dearg? Eh, you don’t really expect me to answer that do you? For god’s sake! I could be marking the guy at the next training session! What's the best piece of advice you ever received? Don’t get caught in the corner! Get into the middle of the court! Actually a piece of handball advice I heard long ago, but I think it’s a statement on life really, and that’s how I’ve tried to live (in the middle of it all).\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Watching my son Ciaran win a juvenile All-Ireland 40X20 handball title a couple of years ago.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen?\n\nHurling: Henry Shefflin. His skill, power and consistency over his career are the best I’ve seen and his scoring record is phenomenal. A great leader on the field too.\n\nFootball: Pat Spillane. I remembering watching those mighty contests between Dublin and Kerry in the late 70’s, and I have to say he was the stand-out player for Kerry in my opinion. His energy and work-rate were amazing. Apart from his scoring ability, he made a lot happen all around him.\n\nIn 10 years’ time Réalt Dearg will be................... Still a great bunch of lads!! Hopefully playing in the top Dublin divisions, with a clubhouse to call home and maybe even a juvenile section underway.\n\n​Mike Richardson\n\nName: Mike Richardson\n\nAge: 33\n\nHometown: Emly, Co.

Civil Service\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? The almighty craic, banter & slagging between the rival hurling counties that even welcomed myself from a so called weaker hurling county to many lads from other so called weaker hurling counties.

I suppose I would like to invite Nelson Mandela as he an inspirational leader to us all and be nice to get his version of events on why he went to prison; Alex Ferguson has always being a person I admired for his man management no nonsense approach; and James Gandolfini (Aka the legend that is Tony Soprano) so if anyone dears mess with me that I have three good people to back me up and sort someone out.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? Suppose bit more confidence on making correct & best decisions in a match\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? Pool and Snooker so if anyone dears to challenge me in a game of pool, I am more the ready for the challenge. Also, keen interest in Basketball (an All Ireland Colleges medal with St Mel's in Longford under 16 to my name defeating Kieran Donaghy's CBS Tralee in final in Tralee). Also, like reading, listening to music, watching good TV shows, having bit of craic playing Golf when get some practice in beforehand though. A big soccer fan in following Man United and Longford Town.\n\nWho is the worst/laziest to train in Realt Dearg? So sweet jaysus some days I could fall into that category. But might give that nomination to Mike Butler as seems the man is injured the whole time or just trains for while before popping in goals for some relaxation time and shouting \"Hon Tipp\" at Cian O'Brien just before he lines up to take a shot. Sorry Mike no offence meant at all here\n\nWhats the best piece of advice you ever received? Always point the linesman's flag in Realt Dearg direction whether it is Realt Dearg's sideline cut or not. Hence, always show that you back your decision strongly by holding the flag firmly out straight with head held high so ref thinks this guy is a good linesman. I believe worked mighty in the club quarter final win over Wild Geese played out in a beautiful scenary of Oldtown, North Dublin in August 2013.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Suppose would have to see my 2 older brothers winning an All Ireland hurling Minor \"C\" level on 2 separate occasions in the late nineties and early 2000's for Longford respectively. Longford doesn't win much major success but winning at any grade is still a satisfactory achievement for same amount of effort bigger teams put in. Longford defeated Mayo in Croke Park where brother was Centre half back and then few years later another brother captained the side at half back to beat Donegal in Enniskillen (Yeah there was uproar that Croke Park was not chosen again this time around which was a disgrace at the time....won't go into that now).\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Hurler would be DJ Carey (may cause a few stirs with this choice) and footballer would be Maurice Fitzgerald hitting those sublime kicks with either foot over the bar from any reasonable distance.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be................... a great club for the Community of the Terenure region and beyond to be involved in and win the hurling Senior Championship.\n\nMícheál Curtin\n\nOur next Profile is Mícheál Curtin. He tells us about his interests in the music tastes of 12 year olds......\n\nName: Mícheál Curtin\n\nAge: 25\n\nHometown: Barefield, Co Clare\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? Cup Game v Thomas Davis Feb 2013.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? Unbelievably inclusive. Gives all new players a fair crack of the whip.\n\nFavourite position? Missionary.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? St Josephs Doora-Barefield. Clare-Stamford for a summer on J1 back in '07.\n\nWhat's your favourite music? Unfortunately for me, I have the same taste in music as your average 12 year old girl. If it's on Spin 1038, chances are it's on my i-pod.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? Loving Suits at the minute.\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team? Big Joe Canning. Altho he'd probably have to play in the corner cuz Eugenio has that full forward spot nailed down at this stage!\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? Tim Tebow (we'll need God on our side if I'm cooking dinner), Russell Brand (he might have a few stories for the boys!) & Mila Kunis (don't really think an explanation is necessary here... well someone has to do the dishes after :)).\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? It would be nice to be able to hit the ball further than 40 yards off my left hand side so that I don't always have to pretend I'm tryin to \"find\" a pass every time I hit off that side!!\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? Love NFL. Pity the Jets are terrible. Golf. Pity I'm terrible. Horse Racing, Rugby. Generally jumping on bandwagons is a good laugh.\n\nWho is the worst/laziest to train in Realt Dearg? Mike Butler. Sometimes he doesn't even pretend he's doing the stretches!! Also once said and I quote \"Anyone carrying a slight injury can sit this out. And a hangover counts as a slight injury.\"\n\nWhats the best piece of advice you ever received? \"Stay off the burgers the night before matches.\" Stone, H,. 2013.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Josephs winning the club all-Ireland was unreal. Clare's all-Ireland in '97... beating Tipp twice in one year was not lost on me even though I was only 9!!\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Hurler - DJ. Footballer, Maurice Fitz.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be... a senior club hopefully. They'll also continue to smash records for having the highest average age of any team. Ever.\n\n​Stephen Casey\n\n\"Casey, Casey you're the divil\" as the song goes. Footballer come hurler Stephen Casey tells us he wishes he had the pace of Jack Mac and how he'd love to see Cavan/Kildare's Seánie Johnston line out in the Red and Black.\n\nAge: 27\n\nHometown: Tramore\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? Competitive debut against Peregrines. We played Lucan before that but I wouldn't use competitive to describe it.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? Despite nearly every member getting through third level education, someone will always find a way to mess up the simplest of drills proving there will always be a job in this country for people who's only skill is to say \"luggage door operating.\" Also despite Lanigan spending 8 years in college, still being unable to open the boot of a car.\n\nFavourite position? Only took up hurling in February so I've only managed 12 of the 15. Probably somewhere down the middle as it reduces the chances of having to take a sideline cut.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? Tramore but only for football. My hurling career began in February.\n\nWhat's your favourite music? The whistle to signal we can stop running laps has a certain musical quality.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? Psych. Nobody has heard of it. Primetime in America. RTE showed it at 9 on a Saturday morning 3/4 years ago, stopped mid season and started again at 12 on a Sunday last year.\n\nWhat inter county player would you like on the Realt Dearg team? Seanie Johnson but only if he gave full commitment to hurling. His dual commitments last year meant his game suffered.\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? As I'm limited to 3 I won't cause a rift by inviting some of the Kelly family but not others. I'd probably ask the lads from a football team what its like to have to train with low numbers all the time. I'd let the two of them pick whoever they want as the the third guest.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? I wish I had Jack's pace.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? I find more and more of my spare time being spent in VHI swiftcare these days.\n\nWho is the worst/laziest to train in Realt Dearg? Paul Warren. Went to the effort and expense of travelling to the other hemisphere for 3 months to avoid running the hill.\n\nWhats the best piece of advice you ever received? Cian's advice on using the hurley and not my hand to hook and block seems sound, if not a case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted, came back in and bolted again.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Being a footballer from Waterford I really only knew the bad times and the worse.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Cian O Brien has a well practiced kicking technique which I assume could be applied to a football. I'm not sure if Sean Cavanagh has ever played hurling but his style would be similar to that of all the Junior F full backs that I've faced.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be... hopefully still attracting more players who never played hurling before. That and attracting players from the so called weaker counties like Westmeath, Mayo, Tipperary.\n\n​Cian Wazu O'Brien\n\nThe man from Aherlow, Cian O'Brien, fills out the player profile this time and pretty much shows how to lose friends and alienate people.\n\nWas you there?\n\nWazu?\n\nName: Cian O'Brien\n\nAge: 34\n\nHometown: Glen of Aherlow. Co. Tipp\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against?

Réalt Dearg's very own Cha Fitzpatrick tells us of his love for a bit of Haddaway and a pint of Kilkenny stew from Vaughan's.\n\nName: Eoin Fitzpatrick\n\nAge: 28\n\nHometown: Conahy, Co. Kilkenny\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? Naomh Mearnóg.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? The openness of the Club throughout. The pints of Smithwicks in Vaughans. Deacon watch and the 60 odd emails it generates.The banter with Wazu. O'Dea's songs.\n\nLeast favourite thing about Réalt Dearg? The transient nature of our pitch status. Roma gypises have nothing on us. Everyone forgets to bring the Jerseys and the balls.\n\nWhat was your previous club(s)? Conahy Shamrocks, Kilkenny, Fullen Gaels, Lancashire\n\nWhat's your favourite music? Electro and the chart stuff that the cool kids listen to.\n\nWhat's your favourite TV Show? Fan of Breaking Bad, “making fat stacks yo”.\n\nIn soccer, who do you support? Manchester United\n\nWhat 3 people, alive or dead, would you invite to a dinner party? Tony Montana, Haddaway (to spin some 90s classics), and Rihanna, Tony Montana would soon kick the place off.\n\nWhat would you like to change about your game? To be able to catch a ball would be nice. I could also apply a style of hurling a little less rule bending, but theres only space for one improvement so GET USED TO IT!\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? I do play the odd bit of Squash. In 2012 I'm gonna copy Shane Murphy's gym regime or buy t-shirts two sizes down (I'm sure Murphy does lots in the gym).\n\nWho's your sporting idol? Tommy Walsh for the current generation and the O'Connor Brothers were masters of the small rectangle.\n\nWhen I was younger I wanted to be...? Some class of an engineer. I think a lack of attention detail affected that outcome.\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? 2006 Kilkenny win over Cork was sweet. Win of 2009 was good too, at half time my head was in my hands.\n\nWho is the best hurler and footballer you have ever seen? Carey and Shefflin in hurling. Peter Canavan in the football.\n\nIn 10 years time Réalt Dearg will be... Larger than life itself - videos of Mulkere's speeches, Butlers cussing, GK's patented “Bate em like he's your brother” training sessions, and O'Deas classic tunes will have become legendary. Dont worry Maloney, just like the x-factor, being the 4th best singer in the club might be your making yet.\n\n​Trevor Jackman\n\nAh Boy Skip. Part of \"The greatest half-back line of all time\". Apparently\n\nName: Trevor Jackman\n\nAge: 30\n\nHometown: Callan, Co Kilkenny via Windgap.\n\nWho did you make your Réalt Dearg debut against? Day 1. Commercials.\n\nFavourite thing about Réalt Dearg? The 2010 half back line. Many people (ok just Mailman) say the greatest of all time. Also the way everyone is welcomed and integrated into the club.

I was gonna say pace but I always say sprinting is just for lads who can't read the game. Being able to strike off my right side might come in handy sometime I suppose.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside the GAA? Reading sports books, 'socialising' and stalking on facebook.\n\nWho's your sporting idol? Franco Baresi\n\nWhen I was younger I wanted to be...? Captain of Kilkenny. Only for that pesky County Champions rule .....\n\nWhat's your favourite GAA memory? Probably 2008 All Ireland stands out. Watching hurling being perfected!\n\n2006, 2009 and 2011 were fair sweet too.
