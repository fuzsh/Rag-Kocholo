        "text": "County Tipperary is in a unique situation in the province of Munster, sharing a border with the provinces of Connacht to the west and Leinster to the east and north. It has a boundary with counties Limerick, Clare and Galway to the west, with Cork and Waterford to the south and east, and Kilkenny, Laois (Queenâ€™s County) and Offaly (Kingâ€™s County) to the east and north. This geographical position meant direct road access to the capital in Dublin and the cities of Kilkenny, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. It has no coastal area but is bounded to the west by the River Shannon, leading to Limerick and the Atlantic, and the River Suir to the south, giving access to the ports of Waterford and New Ross and to the Irish Sea in the east. In 1789 the Royal Mail Coaches from Dublin and Cork announced a service seven times a week for passengers and parcels, with a guard, stopping at the Globe Inn in Clonmel, and the mail coach service operated from Clonmel to Waterford via Carrick-on-Suir (Clonmel Gazette, 22-25 Jul 1789; 17-21 Oct 1789).\n\nJohn Senex, A new map of Ireland (1720), detail showing County Tipperary. Daniel Augustus Beaufort, A new map of Ireland (1797), detail showing County Tipperary. Bernard Scale, An Hibernian atlas (1776), showing the province of Munster (Courtesy Dublin City Library & Archive)\n\nIn the first half of the eighteenth century the county was underdeveloped, its inhabitants poor and its communications networks backward. However, by the last quarter of the century economic conditions improved, trade developed and carriage by road and river facilitated movement and trade. Education became more widely available and literacy increased, creating a wider literate public leading to a demand for printed materials. In the early years of the eighteenth century books, periodicals and newspapers circulating in the county were brought in from Dublin, Limerick, and Cork, and imports from London would have come mainly through Irish booksellers. The earliest references to those involved in the book trade come from subscription editions of books, periodicals or newspapers. At a time when demand for print was low, dedicated booksellers are not found outside the larger cities, those in the country towns combined bookselling with other occupations, such as merchant, grocer or apothecary. In County Tipperary the main centres for the book trade were Clonmel, Cashel, and Carrick-on-Suir, with some activity in Roscrea, Nenagh, Thurles and Tipperary town. The presence of theatrical spaces in Cashel and Clonmel points to a literate and engaged audience willing to support them. On 25 February 1771 Cashel saw a performance in the town theatre supported by the Freemasons (Clark 1965, p. 7). In the summer season of 1783 the New Theatre in Clonmel staged performances of The Earl of Essex by James Ralph and The tragedy of Jane Shore by Nicholas Rowe, featuring Miss Wallis (Clonmel Gazette, 30 Jun-3 Jul 1783). A gentlemanâ€™s play (conducted by Mr Lord) was performed in the Clonmel theatre in May 1787, Cato: a tragedy by Joseph Addison was acted by young gentlemen for the benefit of a gentlewoman in distress (Clonmel Gazette, 17-21 May 1787). The New Theatre in Cashel advertised its plays and farces to be performed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in 1788, including The rivals by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and The chapter of accidents by Sophia Lee (Clonmel Gazette, 11-14 Aug 1788; 4-8 Sep 1788).\n\nTaylor and Skinnerâ€™s Maps of the roads of Ireland (1778), details showing Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and Clonmel.\n\nNewspapers:\n\nFrom the late seventeenth century Irish readers had access to newspapers published in Dublin and London. Subscribers were mainly confined to official bodies and wealthy individuals, the earliest newspapers were distributed to subscribers along the post roads by the clerks of the Post Office, or by dedicated suppliers who distributed a range of Irish and English newspapers and votes of parliament. Newspapers were distributed to subscribers in Tipperary in the first half of the eighteenth century. Burke in his History of Clonmel shows receipts from the accounts of Colonel John Carleton of Darling Hill near Clonmel, sheriff of Tipperary, and the Perry family of Woodrooffe, Clonmel, for newspapers received from Dublin newspaper agents Walter Pallisser and Edmund Browning who also supplied English newspapers and votes of the House of Commons (Burke 1907, p. 346). Dublin newspapers continued to circulate in the county throughout the century distributed from the General Post Office by the clerks of the Munster Road (Clonmel Gazette, 6-9 Aug 1787). From the 1750s newspapers published in Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford also began to circulate in Tipperary. The first newspapers printed in the county did not appear until the 1770s: The Hibernian Gazette, or Universal Advertiser (Clonmel, 1771), The Clonmel Gazette, or Hibernian Advertiser (Clonmel, 1778), and Lordâ€™s Munster Herald (Cashel, 1788).\n\nWhen local provincial newspapers began to be published in the mid eighteenth century they were delivered to drop off points or to individual subscribers by messengers on horseback or through the postal network. Newspaper agents were appointed by the printers to oversee delivery of newspapers, and to receive payment. The newspaper agents also undertook to distribute books and periodicals, so they fulfilled the place of booksellers in the smaller towns. Their role was an important one, as they were responsible for the collection of monies for subscriptions and advertising. In the larger towns the agent could be a printer or bookseller, but a range of individuals undertook this role: postmasters, inn keepers, merchants, apothecaries and private gentlemen. Newspaper printers warned subscribers not to give money to the messengers, but to pay their representatives in town, or at seasonal gatherings such as fairs and the assizes. In 1771 Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford inserted a notice in The Waterford Chronicle: â€˜the printers request that such gentlemen as are indebted to them in Clonmell, for newspapers, advertisements, books, &c. will pay in the amount thereof, as a person attends there at the house of Mr Edmund Dwyer, with proper receiptsâ€™ (Waterford Chronicle, 12-16 Jul 1771). Edmund Finn printed a notice in Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal when one of his clerks lost a small book covered with marbled paper containing printed receipts, on the road between Clonmel and Loughlober in 1773, some receipts were filled in with subscriberâ€™s names and signed by Finn while others were blank, a reward for its recovery could be claimed from James White or Edward Collins in Clonmel (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 13-17 Mar 1773).\n\nIn 1754 Eugene Swiney, printer, bookseller and publisher of The Corke Journal, with his printing office in Paul Street, Cork, inserted a notice in the paper addressed to gentlemen and advertisers, informing them that he had established â€˜at considerable expenseâ€™ a courier between Cork and Clonmel, serving the towns of Kilworth, Rathcormack, Castlelyons, Clogheen and Clonmel (Corke Journal, 8 Apr 1754). The twice weekly paper was commenced in December 1753 (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753), and the following April Swiney was extending its circulation to south Tipperary, at a cost of a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum, dropped â€˜at any house on the road, sealâ€™d up and directedâ€™ for subscribers. He needed a certain number of subscribers to make it worthwhile to employ a courier, in December 1753 he required 100 subscribers in order to establish a delivery to Youghal, County Cork (Corke Journal, 11 Dec 1753). His agents in Tipperary were Dennis McCraith at the Globe Inn in Clogheen and Patrick Brennock, merchant in Clonmel. In 1755 Swiney requested gentlemen in Tipperary to pay their subscriptions to Edward Griffithâ€™s in Kilworth, Thomas Brown in Clonmel, and Denis McGrath in Clogheen (Corke Journal, 5 Aug 1755). Patrick Brennock was agent for The Corke Journal in 1754, but he also sold books and in 1749 had been subscription agent for Seven sacraments, to be published by Patrick Lord in Dublin and Jer Caldwell in Waterford, the subscription proposal was advertised in Jer Calwellâ€™s edition of The oeconomy of human life, published in Waterford. Dennis McCraith and Patrick Brennock were also subscription agents for an abortive project to publish The Clonmell Journal in 1771 (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 30 Jan-2 Feb 1771).\n\nEdmund Finn, printer and bookseller in Kilkenny, began publication of Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal in 1767. The twice weekly newspaper had a wide circulation in Kilkenny, Tipperary, Laois, Carlow, Waterford, Wexford and North Cork. Finn appointed a number of agents in Tipperary to facilitate its local delivery; annual subscriptions of a half guinea (10s.6d.) and advertisements were taken in and messengers were employed to deliver the newspapers and magazines. As the agents came from a variety of trades and social situations changes of personnel were frequent, in its early years several Tipperary agents were involved in its distribution (Cork Evening Post, 19 Jan 1767; Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 11-14 Feb 1767; 25-28 Mar 1767; 26-30 Sep 1767; 13-17 Aug 1768; 21-25 Jan 1769; 27-31 May 1769; 8-11 Nov 1769; 4-7 Nov 1772; 27-30 Oct 1773). Robert Dudley, merchant and bookseller, was its earliest Clonmel agent in 1767 and 1768, followed by Andrew Fogarty in 1769, and James St John in 1772 and 1773. Edward Collins, printer and bookseller, was agent in Clonmel in 1773, and James White, merchant, in 1773 and 1774 (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 13-17 Mar 1773; 5-9 Mar 1774). Carrick-on-Suir was served by William Cantwell and William Durick in 1767, John Carshore, merchant, in 1768 and 1769, James Sause at the end of 1769 and John Verlin in 1772 and 1773; Dennis McCraith at the Globe Inn in Clogheen was agent in 1767; John Bray in Fethard was agent from 1768 to 1772; William St John, merchant and seedsman, was Cashel agent from 1769 to 1773, Robert Constable in Mullinahone and Patrick Common (or Comman) in Thurles, were agents in 1768 and 1769, Nathaniel Goodwin was Thurles agent and James Johnston Mullinahone agent in 1772 and 1773. By 1769 new agents were appointed in Killenaule, John Bacon and later Thomas Bailly, and Nicholas Cummins in Nine-Mile-House, a well known inn on the high road from Cork to Dublin, and a stopping point for the mail carriages (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 14 Nov 1789). Edward Fox was Roscrea agent in 1772 and 1773.\n\nFinnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 11-14 Feb 1767; 20-24 Aug 1768; 8-11 Nov 1769, lists of subscription agents for the newspaper.\n\nThe Limerick Chronicle was published by John Ferrar from 1768, it circulated in counties Limerick, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Tipperary and Offaly (Limerick Chronicle, 13 Mar 1769). His agent in Tipperary town was William Smithis, and it was also delivered twice a week to Newport and Nenagh. Smithis had subscribed to Ferrarâ€™s History of Limerick, published in 1767. When Ferrar published Bowenâ€™s Spelling book in 1774 William Smithis in Tipperary, Mr Oâ€™Brien in Silvermines and Ed Mulconry in Silver Street, Nenagh, were selling agents (Limerick Chronicle, 6 Jan 1774; 24 Nov 1777; 5 Jan 1778). In 1779 a notice in the Limerick Chronicle advised subscribers â€˜in and about Tipperaryâ€™ to call for their papers at the shop of Edmund Dwyer, apothecary, where they were regularly dropped (Limerick Chronicle, 13 May 1779). Ferrar produced a catalogue of books, paper and stationery which was given free to his customers (Limerick Chronicle, 13 Mar 1769). Ten years later Ferrarâ€™s catalogue of books was sent to â€˜all places in the country where his news-paper is deliveredâ€™ (Limerick Chronicle, 15 Feb 1779). Bookshop stock was made available to country readers in this way, local agents could take orders from the catalogue, and books and periodicals were sent to readers with their newspapers.\n\nIn late 1770 agents were listed for Ramseyâ€™s Waterford Chronicle, a twice weekly paper begun by Hugh and James Ramsey in Waterford in 1765(Waterford Chronicle, 28 Dec 1770 â€“ 1 Jan 1771; 11-14 Jun 1771). The Ramseysâ€™ Tipperary agents included James Wall in Newtown, Sam Holland in Cashel, George Lloyd and Edmond Dwyer in Clonmel, John Danks in Carrick-on-Suir, and Amyas Griffith Esq. in Fethard. Griffith was a writer and excise officer. One of his duties involved monitoring pedlars, who purveyed chapbooks and little histories among their goods, and in 1767 it was reported that he seized unlicenced pedlarâ€™s boxes at Fethard fair (Cork Evening Post, 22 Jun 1767). He founded and edited The Public Monitor newspaper in Dublin in 1772, and his three act comedy, The Swadler, was printed in Clonmel by Edward Collins in 1771. Griffithâ€™s time as agent for the Ramseys was short and Samuel Brown of Fethard took over for the towns of Fethard and Killenaule (Waterford Chronicle, 11-14 Jun 1771; 17-20 Dec 1771). Twenty years later The Waterford Herald had an extensive circulation in counties Waterford, Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Carlow, Tipperary, Offaly, Wicklow, Wexford, Clare, Kildare, Kilkenny and Galway, and as far as London and Bath (Waterford Herald, 4 Feb 1792). It used the postal network to deliver the papers, and the post office agents in Tipperary were James Morrissey in Cashel, William Hutchinson in Carrick-on-Suir, and Thomas Shaw in Clonmel (Waterford Herald, 4 Feb 1792).\n\nIn June 1802 The Cork Mercantile Chronicle printed a list of its agents in Munster and beyond (Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 28 Jun 1802; 3 Jan 1803). A continuation of The Hibernian Chronicle, published in Cork by William Flyn since 1769, the printing was taken over by Flynâ€™s son in law, James Haly, in 1801. The Tipperary agents were Thomas Gorman, printer and bookseller, serving Clonmel and Thurles, Mr D. Power in Carrick-on-Suir, and the post office in Clogheen.\n\nThe circulation of newspapers in Tipperary, which were printed in surrounding counties as well as in Dublin, provided advertising and news coverage for most of the eighteenth century. But, an enterprising newspaper publisher from London sought to find a foothold in the market in the 1770s. In 1773 William Bingley made a tour of Munster and Leinster gathering subscriptions for two London newspapers, The Independent Chronicle, costing one guinea and one crown (Â£1.6s.) per annum, and Bingleyâ€™s London Journal, costing 13s British. He appointed a number of individuals around Ireland to act as agents for the newspapers (Hibernian Chronicle, 26 Aug 1773; Freemanâ€™s Journal, 19-21 Oct 1773). Bingley attended the assizes at Cork, Kilkenny and Clonmel and on his return to London subscriptions and advertisements for his two publications were taken by his Tipperary agents, Edward Collins, printer and bookseller, and Thomas Shaw, postmaster, in Clonmel, W. Neve in Cashel and R. Rumbold in Tipperary town(Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 31 Jul-4 Aug 1773; 28 Aug-1 Sep 1773; 30 Jul-3 Aug 1774; Hibernian Chronicle, 26 Aug 1773; 6 Sep 1773; Freemanâ€™s Journal, 19-21 Oct 1773).\n\nTipperary newspapers:\n\nLocally printed newspapers in Tipperary date from about 1771, but the very poor survival of issues makes it difficult to be precise about their operation (nli.ie, Newsplan online). A minimum number of annual subscribers was essential to the viability of a newspaper venture. Revenue from advertising was the mainstay of a provincial newspaper, official and government notices accounted for a regular income, but the vast majority of notices were inserted by local businesses and services (â€˜Eighteenth-century newspaper publishing in Munster and South Leinsterâ€™, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). Not all ventures were successfully established, and some were established but could not be sustained. In February 1771 Francis Bray of Fethard issued proposals to set up a printing office to print a newspaper in Clonmel, to be called the Clonmell Journal. It would be published twice a week and it was aimed at readers in â€˜the extensive and opulent County of Tipperaryâ€™. The paper would contain foreign and home news and prices from the markets in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. The paper was aimed at subscribers in Tipperary, Kilkenny, Waterford and Cork, and subscriptions were charged at a rate of 8s.8d. in town, 11s.4Â½d. in the country, or 1d. for a single paper (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 30 Jan-2 Feb 1771). Agents took subscriptions in Clogheen (Dennis McCraith and Michael Keogh), Carrick (Francis Baron and Edward Fitzgerald), Mullinahone (Thomas Oldis, Esq.), Thurles (Robert Shee), Slievardagh and Killenaule (William Howly, Esq. and Mr Mackey, apothecary), Cashel (Lawford Miles Esq. and Robert Keating), Fethard (Richard Sankey, Esq., Amyas Griffith, Esq. and John Bray), and Clonmel (Patrick Brennock and John Kearney), County Tipperary; Kilkenny and Callan, County Kilkenny; Waterford and Dungarvan, County Waterford; and Mitchelstown, County Cork. Response must have been slow, as another notice published in March acknowledged the support of some subscribers, and requested new subscribers to send in their names (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 9-13 Mar 1771). There is no surviving issue of this paper, and the establishment of the Hibernian Gazette, printed in Clonmel by Edward Collins later that year, suggests that it failed to raise sufficient support to become viable.\n\nThe Clonmel Gazette, or Hibernian Advertiser, 7-10 Jan 1788, masthead. Powerâ€™s Clonmel Gazette and Munster Mercury, 16-19 Jun 1802, masthead.\n\nThe Hibernian Gazette, or Universal Advertiser was founded by Edward Collins in Clonmel in 1771. It was issued twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. Only two issues are known: volume II, no. 1 (20-23 Jul 1772) and volume III, no. 52 (13-17 Jan 1774), this would give it a start date of July 1771. Its circulation extended to counties Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Clare, Laois and Offaly. This is borne out by advertising from businesses in Clonmel, Cashel, Silvermines, Cahir, Nenagh, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Kilworth, County Cork. The title had changed to The Clonmel Gazette, or Hibernian Advertiser by about 1776 (Clonmel Gazette, vol. II, no. 85, 12-15 Jan 1778). On 31 December 1789 Edward Collins handed over the business to Stephen Collins and George Heaslop, the firm becoming Messrs Collins and Heaslop. A notice in the Gazette stated that â€˜Edward Collins is to resign his interest in the wine and printing business to his son and nephew Stephen Collins and George Heaslopâ€™ (Clonmel Gazette, 26-30 Dec 1789; 10-13 Mar 1790). Edward Collins died in 1794 and the Gazette continued until at least 1795. Burke suggests that the title continued after this with a change of name, ownership and politics (Burke 1907, p. 349). Powerâ€™s Clonmel Gazette and Munster Mercury began publication in late 1801, the typeface used in the main title of its masthead identical to that of Edward Collinsâ€™s paper (Clonmel Gazette, 16-19 Jun 1802, volume 1, no. 59). Although not a continuation of the Clonmel Gazette, there was some transfer of title and perhaps printing stock, but the change of political orientation, to support the Catholic party, suggests that it was a separate enterprise. Edmond Power was the proprietor and in June 1802 he advertised for an apprentice â€˜of good connectionsâ€™ and informed his readers that an elegant type had been cast for the paper and would shortly arrive at his office (Clonmel Gazette, 16-19 Jun 1802). The newspaper lasted until 1804, when the loss of a libel action against Power ruined him (Power 1804; Burke 1907, p. 349-350). George Heaslop, Edward Collinsâ€™s nephew, began a new newspaper, The Clonmel Journal, first issued on 11 August 1798. It was published twice a week and printed by his cousin, Stephen Collins, Edwardâ€™s son (Clonmel Journal, 11 Aug 1798; Burke 1907, pp 350-351). Both Heaslop and Collins were prominent in Clonmel business and administration, Collins was collector of revenue in 1788, Heaslop acted as mayor in 1798 and Collins in 1800 (Clonmel Gazette, 31 Jul-4 Aug 1788; Burke 1907, p. 231). Only two issues of the Journal have survived (Clonmel Journal, 24 Sep 1800; 1 Oct 1800), and it seems to have closed about 1804 (Burke 1907, p. 350).\n\nThomas Lord arrived in Cashel in 1788 and set up the first printing press in the town to publish a new newspaper. He may have been the Mr Lord who conducted a gentlemanâ€™s play, Cato by Joseph Addison, performed in the Clonmel theatre in May 1787 (Clonmel Gazette, 17-21 May 1787). One issue of Lordâ€™s Munster Herald, or General Advertiser has survived (Munster Herald, 14 Apr 1788) and evidence suggests that this title was short lived (â€˜Patrick and Thomas Lord: Catholic printers and booksellersâ€™, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). Lordâ€™s time in Cashel was short, but he may have settled in Roscrea in north Tipperary about 1794. It is not clear if Thomas Lord was active in Roscrea, working with William Lord and Thomas Henry Lord, probably his sons. They established a newspaper, The Roscrea Southern Star; or, General Advertiser in August 1795 with its printing office in Limerick Street, becoming that townâ€™s first printers, but Thomasâ€™s name is not on the imprint of the sole surviving issue, Edward Dudley in Roscrea was given as agent for the paper (Roscrea Southern Star, 19 Aug 1795). The paper continued until at least 1797, but in 1798 the press was â€˜burnt by the yeomanry in suspicion of printing seditious balladsâ€™ (Burke 1907, pp 358-359).\n\nThe Clonmel Herald was founded by George Grace in 1802, with William Duffy as printer, but the earliest surviving issues date from 1828. George Grace is listed at Mary Street in 1820 (Pigot 1820-22). Duffy had his printing office at the Kingâ€™s Arms, Main Street, and in 1815 he was advertising the sale of water colours, imported from London (Belfast News Letter, 29 Dec 1815). Mrs Rumbold, bookseller, at the corner of Johnson Street, Clonmel, is listed as one of its agents in 1802 (Bradshaw 1916, ii, p. 824). William Bayly Upton, printer, succeeded as proprietor after Graceâ€™s death and is listed in Johnson Street in 1824 (Pigot 1824). The Clonmel Advertiser was founded in 1811, printed by William Carson who had been printer of the successful Waterford Mirror (founded in 1801), for proprietor Richard Farrell in Waterford, so he came to the project with valuable experience (Burke 1907, p. 352). It was a twice weekly newspaper, published on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The printing office was at Johnson Street from 1811 to 1820, and at Bagwell Street in 1824 (Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824). The early years of the Advertiser have not survived, issues from July 1813 to April 1838 are available.\n\nBooks and periodicals:\n\nBooks and periodicals were available on a limited scale in Tipperary for most of the eighteenth century. Wealthy readers could order their books directly from Dublin, Cork, Kilkenny or Limerick, less well-off readers had to rely on local merchants who carried a small stock of publications, who held catalogues from booksellers, such as John Ferrar in Limerick, or who acted as subscription agents for individual books. Cheap publications, chapbooks, devotional literature and ballad sheets would have been sold by travelling pedlars tramping the countryside and at markets and fairs. Dedicated bookshops began to appear in the 1770s when locally printed newspapers also began to circulate. The earliest reference we have for a bookseller in Clonmel is from 1680, when William Vaughan is named on the imprint of a London printed text, Shepherdy spiritualizâ€™d, or, The improvement of a shepherdâ€™s life to soul-advantage by James Woode (Wood 1680). Another imprint of this edition names Joseph How in Castle Street, Dublin, as the seller. William Connor in Clonmel was agent for the sale of The trial of Doctor Henry Sacheverell in 1710 (Dublin Intelligence, 24 Jun 1710; 1 Jul 1710). In 1720 George Bagwell in Clonmel was subscription agent for Sixteen sermons by Increase Mather, of Boston (Dublin Courant, 4 Jul 1720). C. Daniel was subscription agent in Cashel for Major Richardson Packâ€™s Miscellaneous works in verse and prose printed in Dublin in 1726 (Dublin Weekly Journal, 2 Jul 1726). Burke notes from the Carleton accounts in 1730, payment of 3s.6d. in cash to one Gorman in Clonmel for Caesarâ€™s Commentaries, probably a school book (Burke 1907, p. 358).\n\nIn the 1740s and 1750s Patrick Brennock, merchant in Clonmel, was involved in the sale and distribution of books and newspapers. Burke notes him as a bookseller in 1747 (Burke 1907, p. 358), in 1751 he was subscription agent for an edition of The assertion and defence of the seven sacraments by Henry VIII, due to be published by Pat Lord in Dublin and Jer Calwell in Waterford, in 1754 he was newspaper agent for The Corke Journal (Corke Journal, 8 Apr 1754), and in 1771 he was agent for the Clonmell Journal, the new newspaper proposed by Francis Bray (Finnâ€™s 30 Jan â€“ 2 Feb 1771). Exshawâ€™s London Magazine, a monthly periodical published in Dublin, was distributed in Tipperary during the 1740s and 1750s, by Robert Turner in Cashel from 1746 to 1750 and in Clonmel by James Cumin from 1747 to 1748 and Thomas Butler in 1750 (Dublin Courant, 30 Dec 1746-3 Jan 1747). In the 1780s Edward Collins stocked Exshawâ€™s Gentlemanâ€™s and London Magazine and Walkerâ€™s Hibernian Magazine (Clonmel Gazette, 31 Dec 1781-3 Jan 1782; 27-31 Mar 1783; 5-8 Apr 1784; 10-13 Apr 1786; 11-14 Feb 1788).\n\nIn 1749 Mr McLannan in Clonmel was subscription agent for a Limerick publication, William Biggs, The military history of Europe, published by Andrew Welsh, its issue date scheduled to coincide with the Munster circuit of the assizes (Munster Journal, 17 Jul 1749; 7 Aug 1749). The large octavo volume, illustrated with plans, cost five British shillings, half to be paid on subscribing, and the remainder on delivery. William Airay (or Airy) in Clonmel, was subscription agent in 1750 for The present state of Germany and Italy, the Swiss Cantons, and the republick of Holland (Munster Journal, 11 Jun 1750). Proposals were issued by Phineas Bagnell in Castle Street, Cork, but it is not clear if the project went ahead as no copies are known (ESTC online). The cost to subscribers was two British shillings, bound in calf leather and lettered on the back, half to be paid on subscribing. Anyone purchasing six copies would get the seventh free. Bagnell required 300 subscribers before going to press, and as he was newly in business he may not have had enough support to continue. William Airay in Clonmel, and Joseph Evans in Tipperary, were subscription agents for Dialogues concerning education in two volumes duodecimo, printed in Cork by Phineas and George Bagnell in 1754 (Corke Journal, 19 Feb 1754). Evans subscribed to 14 sets of the work, which strongly suggests local sale. Subscribers who took six sets were entitled to one gratis, at five English shillings (5s.5d. Irish) each, Evans would have saved 10s.10d. on the order. Airay and Evans each subscribed to Templeâ€™s History of the Irish rebellion, published in Cork by Phineas and George Bagnell in 1766.\n\nCork Evening Post, 26 Jun 1766; 29 Jan 1767, advertisements for Robert Dudley, Clonmel.\n\nRobert Dudley, Quaker merchant in Clonmel, acted as newspaper and subscription agent during the 1760s and 1770s. In 1763 he subscribed to George Roberts, Juvenile poems, printed in Limerick for the author by John Cherry, which may have been a personal purchase. He had business contacts with Phineas and George Bagnell, printers, booksellers and papermakers in Castle Street, Cork, in the 1760s. In 1766 he was selling Archbishop Edward Syngeâ€™s A discourse concerning the laws ecclesiastical and civil, printed by them in octavo the previous year, and selling for 1s.1d. (Cork Evening Post, 26 Jun 1766). He was subscription agent for their publication of Sir John Templeâ€™s History of the rebellion in Ireland in 1766, selling for 5s.5d. bound in calf (Cork Evening Post, 29 Jan 1767). In 1767 and 1768 he was agent for Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, and in August 1767 subscribers in and around Clonmel were requested to discharge their accounts for Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal by applying to Robert Dudley (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 11-14 Feb 1767; 26-29 Aug 1767; 14-17 Sep 1768). He subscribed to 12 copies of James Jenkins, Juvenile poems, printed in Waterford by Esther Crawley in 1773, volumes clearly meant for resale. An advertisement by Robert Dudley from 1791 for the fourth edition of The narrative of the life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa the African, selling for 4s. in duodecimo sewed, shows that bookselling continued to form part of the business (Clonmel Gazette, 22-25 June 1791). However, earlier that year Robert Dudley advertised that he was relinquishing the shop-keeping business and selling off his stock of hardware and ironmongery, letting his shop, and moving a little outside the town (Clonmel Gazette, 19-23 Feb 1791).\n\nIn 1763 Robert Jâ€™Ans, with the encouragement of several gentlemen in the county, advertised his stationery business in Clonmel, opposite the Exchange. He stocked â€˜all sorts of stationary-ware, books of all kinds, plays, novels, classic authors, accompt-books, pocket-books &c., all which he will sell at the lowest profit, and give good encouragement to country dealersâ€™. He also offered ready money for second-hand books (Cork Evening Post, 11 Jul 1763). Thomas Chaytor, a teacher who conducted his boarding school in Barrack Street, Clonmel, subscribed to six copies of Juvenile poems by James Jenkins in 1773 and two copies of Miscellaneous poems by Edward Mandeville, printed in Waterford by John Veacock in 1798. These were possibly for the use of his students, or perhaps to be awarded as premiums or prizes for exemplary results or behaviour. Andrew Watson and Co., printers, booksellers and stationers in Limerick, issued catalogues of their book stock in 1785, which were distributed free to booksellers in Munster and Connacht, including Heaslop in Clonmel and Dwyer in Tipperary (Clonmel Gazette, 16-20 Jun 1785). Customers could order from the catalogues and have their books delivered there. Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal noted an amusing shop sign in Tipperary town in 1788: â€˜Joseph Prossor, bookseller, stationer, map and print seller; watchmaker, jeweller and toy maker; iron-monger, bell-hanger and hardware-seller; boot and shoe maker, glazier, hatter and Methodist preacherâ€™ pointing to the diversity of activities often undertaken by country booksellers (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 24-27 Sept 1788). The only mention we have of John McNemara, bookseller in Clonmel, is from 1789 when his wife died (Freemanâ€™s Journal, 2 Jul 1789). James Rumbold, grocer, near the Court House in Clonmel, extended his business interests in 1789, when he advertised stationery, and a large collection of Greek, Latin, French and English books, which he was willing to sell at Dublin prices, in this way absorbing transportation and delivery costs (Clonmel Gazette, 29 Jan-2 Feb 1789). He continued to stock books and stationery, advertising Edmund Burkeâ€™s pamphlet on the French revolution, as well as Irish and English paper and patent medicines (Clonmel Gazette, 1-5 Jan 1791). He was listed as sales agent for the monthly periodical of science, belles letters and history, Anthologia Hibernica, published in Dublin in 1793 and 1794 (Anthologia Hibernica 1793-94). Mrs Rumbold was agent for The Clonmel Herald newspaper in 1802. Mrs Ellen Russell in Carrick-on-Suir and William Gorman, merchant in Clonmel, were subscription agents for The Vulgate bible to be printed in Dublin at a cost to subscribers of Â£1.9s.3d., bound in calf (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 27-31 Mar 1790). This was the Douai bible, translated from Latin and approved by the Catholic church, printed in Dublin in royal quarto format by Hugh Fitzpatrick for Richard Cross. As well as being agent for the Bible William Gorman subscribed for 20 copies of the text, anticipating sale to non-subscribers. In 1799 Thomas Gorman, bookseller and stationer, and J. Taylor in Clonmel were agents for The New Magazine, printed in Dublin by John Gough (New Magazine, July 1799; Cork Advertiser, 3 Aug 1799).\n\nClonmel Gazette, 29 Jan-2 Feb 1789, advertisement for James Rumbold.\n\nEdward Collins:\n\nEdward Collins was the first dedicated bookseller, printer and newspaper proprietor in Clonmel from about 1771 to his death in 1794. One of the Protestant administrative elite, Collins served as justice of the peace for the county of Tipperary, and was mayor of Clonmel in 1787-1788, when he was praised for reforming the police of the town (Burke 1907, p. 231; Clonmel Gazette, 9-13 Oct 1788). He acted as treasurer to the Trustees of the Turnpike Road from Kilkenny to Clonmel, a post later held by his nephew, George Heaslop (Clonmel Gazette, 10-14 Apr 1788). As well as being a printer, bookseller and newspaper proprietor he was also a patent medicine agent and wine merchant. Burke states that Collins was a native of Cork, probably based on the entry in the subscription list in Templeâ€™s History of the Irish rebellion in 1766 where Mr Edward Collins of Cork was described as â€˜compilater of mineral typesâ€™ (Temple 1766; Burke 1907, p. 347). It is not certain that this is the same Edward Collins, but he did have a Cork connection and he died at Anngrove, Carrigtwohill, in East Cork in 1794. His bookshop carried a wide range of stock, books, newspapers, periodicals and almanacs, as well as patent medicines. He sold books and periodicals from London, Dublin and Cork. In 1772 he was selling Timothy Delanyâ€™s Cork almanack printed in Cork by William Flyn. He stocked monthly issues of John Whebleâ€™s Ladyâ€™s Magazine, the first volume published in London in August 1770, and The ladyâ€™s memorandum book, an annual publication printed in London. He sold the annual Watsonâ€™s almanack (1s.1d.) and The English Registry (6Â½d), both published in Dublin (Hibernian Gazette, 13-17 Jan 1774). In 1777 and 1778 he was subscription agent for the Magazin Ã  la mode, a monthly periodical in French compiled by Charles Praval, a French teacher in Dublin. Published by William and Henry Whitestone in Dublin, it ran from May 1777 to April 1778 (Kennedy 1994; â€˜Charles Praval: eighteenth-century French teacherâ€™, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). He stocked the monthly magazines from Dublin, Exshawâ€™s Gentlemanâ€™s and London Magazine, and Walkerâ€™s Hibernian Magazine, and The Monthly Review from London, which he forwarded to subscribers and sold individually in his shop (Clonmel Gazette, 31 Dec 1781-3 Jan 1782; 27-31 Mar 1783; 5-8 Apr 1784; 10-13 Apr 1786; 11-14 Feb 1788).\n\nOne of his more expensive publications was the latest edition of Bollingbrookeâ€™s Abridgement of the public statutes of Ireland, now in force and in general use, selling at Â£1.17s.6d. in 1772. This volume, printed in London, was essential for legal and administrative bodies or individuals (Hibernian Gazette, 20-23 Jul 1772). In 1776 and 1777 he subscribed to three sets of Goldsmithâ€™s History of the earth, published in Dublin by James Williams. He was subscription agent in 1778 for The complete dictionary of arts and sciences (Freemanâ€™s Journal, 15-17 Jan 1778). This was a Dublin edition to be issued in 75 weekly parts, coming to three volumes folio illustrated with 150 engraved plates when completed. The cost to subscribers was a British shilling (1s.1d. Irish) per number, or for those who wanted it delivered with their monthly magazines, the cost for four numbers per month was 4s.4d. He was licensed agent to sell such popular patent medicines as Maredantâ€™s Antiscorbutic Drops (Hibernian Journal, 5-7 Apr 1775) and Dr Ryanâ€™s Pectoral Essence of Coltâ€™s Foot at 3s.3d. per bottle (Clonmell Gazette, 12-15 Jan 1778).\n\nFreemanâ€™s Journal, 30 Dec-1 Jan 1778, advertisement for The complete dictionary of arts and sciences. Le magazin Ã  la mode (1777), titlepage.\n\nIn 1778 Collins advertised a list of new books which included A treatise on forest trees by William Boutcher, published in Edinburgh in 1775, selling for 5s.10d.; Momus, or the laughing philosopher for 2s.11d., published in Dublin by James Williams in 1777, the text was originally printed serially in The Westminster Magazine; Political tracts for 2s.11d.; Sylvester Oâ€™Halloranâ€™s An introduction to the study of the history and antiquities of Ireland, illustrated with copper plates, for 17s.4d., published in Dublin in quarto format by Thomas Ewing in 1772 and reissued in London by John Murray the same year; Select poetical works of William Dunkin in two volumes, first published in Dublin in 1769-1770; Lord Chesterfieldâ€™s Letters to his son in two volumes octavo for 14s.1d. or in four volumes duodecimo for 12s.8d., the Letters went into five editions in London and Dublin in 1774, with the sixth edition in 1775 and the seventh in 1776; and The speaker, or miscellaneous pieces by William Enfield for 3s.6d., published in London and Dublin from 1774, with the third edition in 1777 (Clonmell Gazette, 12-15 Jan 1778). This list of up-to-date popular works displays a breadth of interest to appeal to Collinsâ€™s customers.\n\nIn 1783 he announced a new publication of local interest, â€˜highly esteemed in Dublin for its patriotic tendencyâ€™. Published by John Exshaw and entitled Collectanea Hibernica medica, number one of a collection of papers on medicine by Richard Harris, M. D., physician in Clonmel, it was priced at 2s.2d. for the octavo volume (Clonmel Gazette, 27-31 Mar 1783). He stocked Dominick Trantâ€™s topical text Considerations on the present disturbances, in the province of Munster, printed in Dublin by Pat Byrne in octavo and selling for 1s.1d. (Clonmel Gazette, 22-26 Feb 1787). This publication proved a best seller and went into three editions during the year.\n\nCollins retired from business as printer and wine merchant at the end of 1789 in order â€˜to attend to his other engagementsâ€™ (Clonmel Gazette, 26-30 Dec 1789). Collinsâ€™s death occurred on 16 September 1794 at Anngrove, County Cork (Hibernian Chronicle, 18 Sep 1794; Anthologia Hibernica 1794, p. 240). He was succeeded by his son Stephen Collins, and his nephew, George Heaslop. Collins and Heaslop continued to publish The Clonmel Gazette and to run their extensive wine importation business as well as offering sums of money for loan at interest (Clonmel Gazette, 30 Jun-3 Jul 1790; 14-17 Jul 1790; 1-4 Sep 1790; 13-17 Nov 1790; 26-29 Jan 1791; 9-13 Apr 1791; 24-27 Oct 1792; 9-13 Feb 1793).\n\nClonmel Gazette, 26-30 Dec 1789, advertisement for Edward Collins.\n\nGeorge Heaslop\n\nGeorge Heaslop, Edward Collinsâ€™s nephew, had a successful bookshop, patent medicine, and lottery office in Clonmel from at least 1781 (Clonmel Gazette, 1-4 Oct 1781). He was a member of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, and took an active role in the running of the town, being elected burgess in 1790 and mayor of Clonmel in 1798 (Clonmel Gazette, 25-29 Sep 1790; Findmypast.ie; Burke 1907, p. 231). He also acted as treasurer to the Trustees of the Turnpike Road from Kilkenny to Clonmel during the 1790s, a position previously held by Edward Collins (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 20 Apr 1791; 9 Jun 1792; 19 Apr 1794; 30 Apr 1796). He was married in 1792 to Miss Susanna Griffith, daughter of Edward Griffith of Raheen, Co Waterford, but his young wife died of scarlet fever after giving birth to twins in 1794 (Waterford Herald, 6 Mar 1792; Marriage Licences, Cashel and Emly; Clonmel Gazette, 10-13 Sep 1794).\n\nWith his cousin, Stephen Collins, Heaslop succeeded Edward Collins as printer of The Clonmel Gazette in 1789. However, he had placed significant advertising in the Gazette for his book stock, patent medicines and lottery tickets during the previous eight years. An advertisement for lottery tickets, policies and shares in the English lottery was carried in October 1781 for Dublin booksellers James Potts, James Williams, Caleb Jenkin and Luke White, the Clonmel agents were F. and G. Heaslop, and postmaster Thomas Shaw (Clonmel Gazette, 1-4 Oct 1781). Heaslop was also agent for policies from Dublin booksellers John Beatty, William and Henry Whitestone, John Magee, Robert Burton and John Cash (Clonmel Gazette, 26-29 Nov 1781; 7-11 Nov 1782; 24-27 Nov 1783; 6-9 Dec 1784). In his advertising Heaslop has not given a street address for his shop, but in 1783 when advertising lottery tickets for sale by Thomas Andrews and George Heaslop, purchasers are directed to â€˜the printerâ€™s hereofâ€™, so he may have shared the Barrack Street premises with Edward Collins, however by 1792 Collins and Heaslop had their premises in Gaol Street (Clonmel Gazette, 24-27 Nov 1783; 25-28 Jan 1792). The sale of lottery tickets and shares was a valuable component of business and many booksellers became agents for the English and Irish state lotteries, and for individual local lottery schemes to raise funds for public or charitable projects. The sale of patent medicines was another important strand of business for many booksellers, they were luxury commodities aimed at well off customers. Printed instructions accompanied the various medicines, giving directions for use, and also carrying endorsements from satisfied customers. Heaslopâ€™s advertisements for Dr Ryanâ€™s Antiscorbutic Drops for the cure of scurvy, selling at 5s.5d. per bottle, with printed instructions, and his Pectoral Essence of Coltsfoot for colds, coughs and sore throats, at 3s.3d. a bottle, with the printed instructions bearing the seal of Dr Ryan, and Dr Storyâ€™s Patent Worm Cakes â€˜sold by the patenteeâ€™s special appointmentâ€™ at one British shilling per paper, were full and detailed, giving the benefits of each productâ€™s properties (Clonmel Gazette, 16-20 May 1782). Engraved prints also formed part of a booksellerâ€™s stock, and in 1782 Heaslop offered for sale an engraving of Hibernia in the character of Minerva, flanked by two volunteers in full colour uniform, in an elegant slip case, price 2s.4d. (Clonmel Gazette, 21-24 Jan 1782).\n\nHeaslopâ€™s book stock, mainly distributed from Dublin, was current, varied and extensive. He sold the annual steady sellers, Watsonâ€™s Almanack for 1s.1d., or accompanied by The English registry for 2s.2d., and Mageeâ€™s Miniature almanack for 2s.4d. (Clonmel Gazette, 14-17 Jan 1782). These little books were essential for gentleman, farmers, merchants and traders, and sold in large quantities. In his advertising, two entire columns of the four column page of the Gazette, were regularly devoted to his books, often with a further column for his medicines. His lists of books included detailed descriptions, giving number of volumes and prices. The variety of titles offered is striking, including new works of English and European literature, history and travels, from expensive multi volume sets to plays costing 6Â½d. Many recent publications came from the bookshops of James Williams or John Exshaw, while the more popular titles were issued by groups of Dublin booksellers in co-operation. Books â€˜just arrived to George Heaslopâ€™ in 1781 included Views of the most remarkable public buildings in Dublin, for 12s.5d. (Clonmel Gazette, 26-29 Nov 1781). This quarto volume by Robert Pool and John Cash, was made up of historical descriptions of important buildings, beautifully illustrated with engravings, including an engraved title page and map of Dublin. It was published by subscription by James Williams in Dublin in 1780, with the Dublin Society acting as patron. It remains one of the most beautiful books about eighteenth-century Dublin.\n\nThe November 1781 list included The complete works of M. de Montesquieu, translated from French, in four volumes for Â£1.8s.8d. This is likely to be the Dublin edition in octavo, published by a group of seventeen booksellers in 1777. Other items listed were The poetical miscellany for 3s.6d., published by James Williams in duodecimo in 1774; Magazin des enfans, in two volumes for 9s.5d., compiled by Madame Leprince de Beaumont, probably the London edition in English translation from 1765, as Dublin editions in French did not appear until 1787 and 1788; Memoirs of the Cardinal de Retz, translated from French, in four volumes, cost 11s.8d., probably the most recent edition printed in Dublin for a group of booksellers in four volumes duodecimo in 1777; Richard Brinsley Sheridanâ€™s The school for scandal, for 6Â½d., this new play was performed in Dublin in 1778 and in Cork the following year; Thomas Sheridanâ€™s A rhetorical grammar of the English language for 2s.11d., published in Dublin in duodecimo by a group of booksellers in 1781; The Hibernian Magazine for 1776 to 1780, five years of the monthly magazine bound in annual volumes for 9s.2Â½d. each, compiled and printed in Dublin by Thomas Walker; Marmontelâ€™s Moral tales, two volumes for 2s.6Â½d, printed in Dublin in duodecimo by James Potts in 1775; The history of Miss Stanhope for 2s.11d.; Nathaniel Hookeâ€™s Roman history in eight volumes for Â£2.13s.4d , this likely to be the sixth edition in eight volumes octavo printed in Dublin by Thomas Henshall about 1775; World displayed; or a curious collection of voyages and travels in 20 volumes bound for Â£2.11s.10d., or Â£1.16s.8d. sewed, the sixth edition corrected, published in Dublin by James Williams in 1779 in duodecimo with plates and maps; and The suspicious lovers: a novel, by the author of Woodbury, in two volumes sewed for 4s.8d. (Clonmel Gazette, 26-29 Nov 1781).\n\nThe following year he was advertising Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, translated from Spanish, with an account of the authorâ€™s life by Tobias Smollett, illustrated with copper plates, in four volumes for 11s.4d., this could have been the 1766 Dublin duodecimo edition printed by Thomas Ewing, or the latest duodecimo edition in four volumes with plates, issued in Dublin by a group of booksellers, with 1783 as the date of publication; the AbbÃ© Raynalâ€™s A philosophical and political history of the East and West Indies in four volumes for Â£1.10s.4d., translated from French, it was published in Dublin in four volumes octavo, with maps and plates, by John Exshaw and William Halhead in 1776 and the third edition in 1779; William Robertsonâ€™s History of Scotland in two volumes for 14s.1d., a new edition was printed in Dublin, in two volumes octavo with plates, by James Williams in 1778, and his History of Emperor Charles V in three volumes for 17s.7d., the most recent edition published in Dublin in octavo, with plates, by a large group of booksellers in 1777; A view of society in Europe by Gilbert Stuart, priced at 5s.10d., an octavo volume printed in Dublin for a groups of booksellers in 1778; John Lockeâ€™s Essay concerning human understanding, the eighteenth edition in three volumes for 10s.6d., this was published in Dublin for a group of booksellers in 1777; the AbbÃ© Millotâ€™s Elements of general history in two volumes for 14s.3d., published in Dublin in octavo for a group of booksellers in 1779; The morality of Shakespeareâ€™s drama illustrated, by Mrs Elizabeth Griffith, two volumes for 5s.10d., published in Dublin in duodecimo by John Beatty in 1777; and The modern gardener by Thomas Hill for 4s.10Â½d., published in Dublin in duodecimo by James Williams in 1772 (Clonmel Gazette, 21-24 Jan 1782; 6-9 May 1782; 1-4 Jul 1782; 25-28 Nov 1782).\n\nIn early 1783 he advertised Dr Samuel Johnsonâ€™s A journey to the western islands of Scotland for 2s.11d., published in two volumes duodecimo in 1775; The political tracts and speeches of Edmund Burke for 7s.0Â½d., printed in Dublin in octavo in 1777; a new edition of The sorrows of Werter in two volumes for 2s.11d., the best selling novel by GoÃ«the was printed in Dublin for Christopher Jackson in duodecimo in 1780 and 1781; The affected indifference; a sentimental novel, in letters, in two volumes for 2s.11d., printed in duodecimo also for Jackson in 1781; Lectures on the art of reading by Thomas Sheridan in two volumes for 7s., printed in Dublin in duodecimo in 1782; History of the United Provinces of the Netherlands by William Lothian, for 7s.0Â½d., printed in octavo by a group of Dublin booksellers in 1780; and Reflections on death by William Dodd, the fifth edition for 3s. filletted, printed in Dublin in duodecimo by John Kiernan for Thomas Walker, the binding with gilt fillets made it suitable as a gift. Among his publications for sale he listed Collectanea Hibernica medica, number one of a collection of papers on medicine by Richard Harris, M. D., physician in Clonmel, published in Dublin by John Exshaw, which had been advertised by Edward Collins in March (Clonmel Gazette, 27-31 Mar 1783; 30 Jun-3 Jul 1783). By the end of the year he had added Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The confessions in two volumes for 7s.0Â½d., published in Dublin in duodecimo for a large group of booksellers in 1783; The Lilliputian library, or Gulliverâ€™s museum in ten volumes, aimed at a juvenile audience, printed in Dublin in tiny 24mo format with woodcuts, by Sheppard and Nugent, and John Parker in 1782; William Blackstoneâ€™s Commentaries on the laws of England, the sixth edition in four volumes for 14s.1d, printed in Dublin in duodecimo in 1775, and his Reports of cases determined in the several courts of Westminster-Hall, from 1746 to 1779, in two volumes for Â£1.4s.8d., printed in Dublin in octavo in 1781; Journal of Captain Cookâ€™s last voyage to the Pacific Ocean 1776, 1777, 1778, 1779, price 7s.0Â½d., containing plates and a map, printed in Dublin by a group of booksellers in 1781; and Philip Thicknesseâ€™s A yearâ€™s journey through France, and part of Spain, two volumes for 7s.0Â½d., published by James Williams in duodecimo in 1777 Some titles continued to be advertised, such as Raynalâ€™s East and West Indies, Mrs Griffithâ€™s Shakespeare, Hillâ€™s Modern gardener, or Robertsonâ€™s History of Scotland and Charles V, appearing in the lists for months or years, either because they had not sold, or because Heaslop stocked multiple copies (Clonmel Gazette, 20-23 Jan 1783; 10-13 Mar 1783; 30 Jun-3 Jul 1783; 4-8 Sep 1783; 18-22 Dec 1783).\n\nIn 1784 he was subscription agent, with William Flyn bookseller in Cork, for Mr De la Mainâ€™s (Henry Delamain of Cork) eight song scores. The price to subscribers was 11s.4Â½d., half to be paid on subscribing, while the price to non subscribers would rise to 16s.3d. The songs were adapted to the harpsichord, â€˜for such as do not play from scoreâ€™ (Clonmel Gazette, 15-19 Apr 1784; 20-24 May 1784). The song scores were probably printed in Dublin by Joseph Hill, printer and music seller, as one song score in a single folio sheet has survived, â€˜When I think on your truth, &c. A favourite song, composed by Mr Delamain of Corkâ€™.\n\nCollins and Heaslop advertised Tipperary author, Hariet Heskethâ€™s, Historic tales in 1790, quoting a paragraph from The Critical Review to promote it (Clonmel Gazette, 10-13 Mar 1790). Proposals were issued for publication by subscription of Mr Hargrove, surgeon dentist of Limerick, A general treatise on the teeth and gums. No money was required in advance, and it would go to press when a sufficient number had subscribed (Clonmel Gazette, 20-24 Mar 1790). No copies of this text have survived, so it is not clear if it attracted enough purchasers to be viable. They stocked poll books, pamphlets listing alphabetically the freeholders who voted to return two Knights of the Shire at parliamentary elections, giving the addresses and values of their freeholds (Clonmel Gazette, 30 Jun-3 Jul 1790; 9-13 Apr 1791).\n\nThomas Gorman:\n\nThomas Gorman was printer, bookseller, stationer, newspaper and subscription agent, wholesale paper and patent medicine agent, and lottery agent in Main Street, Clonmel, from at least 1796. He was a Catholic bookseller, disseminating works of Catholic interest and he was the first publisher of Tadhg Gaelach Ã“ SÃºilleabhÃ¡inâ€™s (Timothy Oâ€™Sullivan) popular Catholic devotional work, Pious miscellany. He may have succeeded William Gorman, who was subscription agent in Clonmel in 1790 for the Catholic Vulgate Bible, printed in Dublin (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 27-31 Mar 1790). Thomas was in business until 1817, when he was listed for the sale of lottery tickets (Freemanâ€™s Journal, 11 Oct 1814; 16 Jan 1816; 11 Apr 1817). His death occurred on 3 July 1817 in his 47th year, â€˜a truly honest, liberal and honourable man in all his dealings.â€™ He is buried in Old St Maryâ€™s churchyard in Clonmel (tipperarystudies.ie). He was succeeded as printer by his widow, Catherine, named in the census of 1821 (Dix 1912; Bradshaw 1916, ii, p. 824) and by Ellen Gorman, printer, bookseller and stationer, listed at Main Street, Clonmel, in the 1820s (Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824).\n\nBooksellerâ€™s label of Thomas Gorman, c.1796.\n\nThomas Gormanâ€™s shop on Main Street was variously named Shakespeareâ€™s Head (1801-1812), Wholesale Paper and Patent Medicine Ware-House (1801), Mirror Office (1802) and County Tipperary Printing Office (1802). A booksellerâ€™s label from about 1796 reads: â€˜Sold by T. Gorman, bookseller and stationer, Main-Street, Clonmel, The greatest variety of account-books, stamps of every description, magazines, &c. &c. at his shopâ€™ (Reeve 1796). In 1796 Gorman subscribed to 25 sets of Rev. Joseph Moronyâ€™s Sermons, printed in Dublin in two volumes duodecimo by Thomas McDonnel and displaying an impressive subscription list of Catholic clergy taking multiple sets of the work. In 1799 he was agent for The New Magazine, printed in Dublin by John Gough (New Magazine, July 1799; Cork Advertiser, 3 Aug 1799). In 1801 and in 1802 he advertised his Wholesale Paper and Patent Medicine Ware-House, on Main Street, which was â€˜regularly supplied with every new work of merit, mercantile and common account books, and stationary in generalâ€™ (Waterford Mirror, 28 Nov 1801). He acted as agent for The Waterford Mirror in 1802, taking in advertisements and subscriptions at the Mirror Office on Main Street, and The Cork Mercantile Chronicle in 1802 and 1803 (Waterford Mirror, 20 Jan 1802; Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 3 Jan 1803). His advertisement for new books in 1802 offered â€˜every new work of merit, soon as published in the United Kingdom, with a variety of stationary, &c. may be had at his shop â€“ fishing tackle, &c. &c.â€™ (Waterford Mirror, 20 Jan 1802). He was agent for George Wallâ€™s Hibernian preceptor printed in Parsonstown (Birr), County Offaly, by Joseph Bull in 1810. He continued to stock patent medicines, such as the Balm of Gilead, anti-impetigines, essence of mustard, coltsfoot, and horehound (Waterford Mirror, 28 Nov 1801; Clonmel Gazette, 9-13 Oct 1802; 3-6 Nov 1802) and Duiganâ€™s Balsam of Licorice, which he was licensed to sell in 1811 (Ramseyâ€™s Waterford Chronicle, 19 Nov 1811). One of his staple commodities was Warrenâ€™s Original Japan Liquid Blacking, a product for the care of leather produced in London, for which he was agent; it was sold in stone bottles at 3s.9d. a quart, 2s. a pint and 1s.1d. a half pint (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 7 May 1808; Ramseyâ€™s Waterford Chronicle, 22 Feb 1812).\n\nWaterford Mirror, 28 Nov 1801; 23 Jan 1802, advertisements for Thomas Gorman.\n\nHis printing career began about 1802, in an advertisement he noted that â€˜he has fitted up, in a very extensive manner, a complete Printing-Office, â€¦ where all orders in that line, will be executed at the shortest notice, and in a style of taste, elegance, and correctness, much superior to any hitherto known in this town or county, and on terms that will generally pleaseâ€™ (Waterford Mirror, 20 Jan 1802). His printing output was typical of Catholic booksellers of the period, concentrating on works of devotional literature in small formats, selling cheaply, chapbooks and song books. One of his earliest productions was a popular volume of Irish language religious poetry by Tadhg Gaelach Ã“ SÃºilleabhÃ¡in, Pious miscellany, which he published by subscription in 1802 (Ã“ CiosÃ¡in 1996; Sharpe 2014; Sharpe and Hoyne 2020). Poems and songs from this collection had circulated throughout Munster in manuscript form in Tadhgâ€™s lifetime, and for many years after his death in 1795. So popular was this text among Catholic readers that more than twenty editions were published in the first half of the nineteenth century, four surviving editions were printed in Clonmel from 1802 to 1816, with further editions printed in Cork, Cappoquin, County Waterford, Limerick and Dublin up to the 1860s. The text in Irish was printed in Roman rather than Gaelic type, the title and editorial matter was in English. The books were cheaply produced in paper covers, a common occurrence with Catholic devotional literature, and would have sold for a few pence.\n\nSamuel Fennell, Original poems (1811); Tadhg Gaelach Ã“ SÃºilleabhÃ¡in, Pious miscellany (1812), titlepages.\n\nIn 1802 or 1803 Gorman printed The harp of Erin: consisting of a choice collection of the most fashionable, convivial and Bacchanalian songs, toasts, etc., etc., made up of 108 pages in duodecimo. He printed works of Catholic devotion and in 1804 he published The love of Jesus: a new and correct translation from the French of H. M. Boudon. Gorman printed a number of official and government proclamations, including a broadside, List of the tolls and dues of Clonmel in 1802 and Tipperary presentments in 1814. He printed a 22 page pamphlet, Thoughts on a late advertisement in â€˜The Dublin Evening Postâ€™, on the subject of tithes, in 1807. In 1808 he published a novel by Mrs Penelope Aubin, first published in London in 1726, The life and adventures of Lady Lucy, the daughter of an Irish lord. This was printed in small format sextodecimo (16mo) by Gorman for the Catholic bookseller Patrick Wogan in Dublin, and was likely destined for the country market. In 1811 he printed Samuel Fennellâ€™s Original poems, in duodecimo format with frontispiece portrait and advertisement, and a chapbook, The renowned history of Valentine and Orson, in sextodecimo format. In 1815 he printed another title in Irish for a Catholic readership, An teagasg cristuy, agus urnihe na mainne, agus na trahnona, a 56 page catechism first published in 1774 (Sharpe and Hoyne 2020).\n\n1800-1824:\n\nBy the early nineteenth century book trade networks in Tipperary had expanded considerably and the demand for printed books had increased. Dedicated bookshops and circulating libraries are found in a number of towns in the first two decades of the century. Mr Linton was bookseller in Cashel in 1809 and 1810 when he was sales agent for Sir James Wareâ€™s Ancient Irish histories published in Dublin in 1809 and for George Wallâ€™s Hibernian preceptor printed in Parsonstown (Birr) by Joseph Bull in 1810. Mr Spaight, bookseller in Nenagh, was also agent for Wallâ€™s Hibernian preceptor in 1810. Charles Bianconi, later well known throughout Ireland for his road coaching services, advertised as a print seller in Clonmel in 1811. The advertisement for the sale of paintings, prints, drawings, looking glasses, and â€˜commands for him [to be] directed to Mr Bull and Mr Farrell, booksellers, The Quay, Waterfordâ€™ (Ramseyâ€™s Waterford Chronicle, 14 Nov 1811). In Clonmel two individuals are associated with what may be the same circulating library in Dublin Street, Archibald Heuston, circulating library, and Margaret Lynch who is named as circulating library keeper (Pigot 1820-22). George Higgins was bookseller and stationer in Duncan Street, Clonmel, in 1820 (Pigot 1820-22), and Cornelius Higgins was bookseller, bookbinder and stationer in Dublin Street, Clonmel, in 1824 (Pigot 1824). James Kearney was bookseller and stationer in Main Street, Clonmel, in 1824 (Pigot 1824). Michael Boyle was bookseller, stationer and library keeper on Main Street, Carrick-on-Suir, in 1824 (Pigot 1824). Two booksellers are listed in Roscrea in the 1820s, Paul Eggers, printer and bookseller in Castle Street, who subscribed to six copies of William Stittâ€™s Practical architectâ€™s ready assistant in 1819 and was listed in Pigotâ€™s Directory in 1824, and John Cleary, bookseller in Main Street, Roscrea, in 1824 (Pigot 1824).\n\nLocal printing:\n\nAside from the publication of newspapers few items were printed in the county during the eighteenth century, and they were mostly confined to proclamations, school books or works of local interest. Edward Collins was Clonmelâ€™s first printer, in addition to publication of The Hibernian Gazette, he printed The swadler. A new comedy of three acts. Written by Amyas Griffith, in 1771. He advertised it with other new publications in The Waterford Chronicle,â€˜a new comedy of three acts, (as â€˜twas performed in Dublin for eighteen nights successively with universal applause, but never before in print) entitled the Swadler, written by Amyas Griffith of Fethard, Esq.â€™ (Waterford Chronicle, 14-17 May 1771).\n\nWaterford Chronicle, 14-17 May 1771, advertisement for The swadler.\n\nThomas Lord, Catholic printer and bookseller, made an attempt to establish a printing business in Tipperary, first at Clonmel in 1786 and then at Cashel in 1788, where he set up the townâ€™s first press, before moving on to Roscrea (â€˜Patrick and Thomas Lord: Catholic printers and booksellersâ€™, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). Lord printed at least two books during his stay in Clonmel, a 16 page octavo pamphlet The upright lives of the heathens (1786), first published in London in 1683, and a 50 page account of The life and conversion of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African prince (1786). This narrative had a popular appeal, and editions were printed in England, Scotland and America from the early 1770s, and a Welsh language version from 1779. It had later Irish editions, printed in Dublin in 1790 and Cork in 1791.\n\nPatrick Lynch, The pentaglot preceptor (1796), titlepage.\n\nThe first press was set up in Carrick-on-Suir in the 1790s by school master, Patrick Lynch, and printer, John Stacy, and the first item from the press was Lynchâ€™s Paddyâ€™s portable chronoscope in 1792 (Dictionary of Irish biography online). An interesting school text by Lynch, was printed by subscription at the press in 1796, the first of a proposed five volume set. Printed by John Stacy, The pentaglot preceptor; or elementary institutes of the English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Irish languages, only volume one, A complete grammar of the English tongue, made it into print. Subscriptions were to be taken by Patrick Lynch, school master, Carrick-on-Suir, and subscriberâ€™s names were to be appended to each volume. It was issued in octavo format and was reissued in 1802 with the â€˜Preliminary discourseâ€™ dated May 1st 1802, and again in 1805. Stacy issued an Irish language text in 1796, Oific na hoige Naomhtha Muire. Translated for the use of the Carmelites, by P. Oâ€™Neill, a single copy of which was held in Cambridge University Library, but does not appear in the current catalogue (Bradshaw 1916, ii, p. 819). Stacy printed a 32 page pamphlet, A serious address to people of all denominations professing Christianity by Thomas Leary, in 1800, and a play written by himself, The good natured Irishman: or, the corporal bewitchâ€™d: a farce in two acts, written by John Stacy, in 1806.\n\nW. Price, printer in Cashel, printed a proclamation in a single sheet folio in 1798, Notice to the inhabitants of town and neighbourhood of Tipperary. Other surviving notices and proclamations from this period do not name the printer, for example Grand Jury Room, Clonmel, March 12, 1796, To the Honourable Francis Hely Hutchinson, High Sheriff of the County of Tipperary in 1799 and Notice, Clonmel, September 13th 1799, printed at The Public and Military printing Office, near the bank. The census return for Clonmel in 1821 lists William Carson, printer, and three apprentices in Gordon Street, William Goggin, printer, in Main Street, Mrs Catherine Gorman, widow, printer, in Main Street, and John Hackett, printer with one apprentice, in Main Street (Dix 1912). William Goggin, was a printer on Main Street, Clonmel, in the 1820s (Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824), although Burke believed that he spent no more than a year in Clonmel (Burke 1907, p. 359). He printed street ballads and chapbooks for the country market. A native of Limerick, he was related to the family of printers, booksellers, stationers and copper-plate printers, who traded at the Shakespeare Press in Limerick from at least 1784 and specialized in the production of chapbooks, prayer books, school books and ballad sheets (Herbert 1942). Dix notes five slim small format 16mo song books, printed by Goggin in Clonmel about 1820, each comprising eight pages containing a number of songs with two woodcuts, The new broom sweeps clean, The banks of Claudy, Castle Hyde, The admired song of Youghal harbour and Captain Wattle (Dix 1912). He also printed the 20th edition of the Catholic Catechism compiled by Dr James Butler, coming to 72 pages in diminutive 24mo. (Dix 1912). Hugh Hearn, printer in Carrick-on-Suir, issued a prospectus in 1816 for Original Irish poems in the Irish language, Blaithfleasg na milsean, only one part of which was published (Dix 1907).\n\nJohn Hackett was printer, wholesale and retail bookseller, stationer, bookbinder, paper merchant, library keeper and patent medicine agent at Main Street, Clonmel, from at least 1818 to 1854 (Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824; Commercial directory 1839). He specialized in distributing books of Catholic interest. In 1818 and 1819 he printed two small format Irish language devotional works using Roman type, Leavar beag na rosaries, a book of devotional pieces in 16mo, written by Patrick Denn, school teacher, of Cappoquin, County Waterford, and Machtnuig go maith air, think well onâ€™t, in 18mo, written by Rev. Dr Richard Challoner and translated into Irish by Patrick Denn. He advertised his stock and services at the back of Machtnuig go maith air, including a notice that he had purchased new types from England for his Military and Public Printing Office (Sharpe 2020, pp 497-498). He printed Selim: a Turkish tale by G. Fitzgerald in 1821 and a 32 page Letter to the people of Ireland on the present disturbed state of the country in 1822. In 1826 he issued a prospectus for a new newspaper, The Tipperary Free Press, and the first issue appeared on 23 December 1826(Burke 1907, pp 352-353). He continued to sell patent medicines and in 1830 advertised the Cordial Balm of Life (Belfast News Letter, 29 Jun 1830; 21 Sep 1830). J. Hackett printed the annual reports of the Clonmel Mechanicsâ€™ Institute from 1842 to 1854. John Hackett was printer of The Catholic Directory in 1846. William Hackett is listed as printer, medicine and foreign snuff warehouse on Main Street, Clonmel, in 1824 (Pigot 1824).\n\nConclusion:\n\nFrom the late seventeenth century the printed word circulated in Tipperary; with newspapers, books and pamphlets distributed from Dublin and London. In the absence of dedicated bookshops before the 1770s it is interesting to pick out the almost invisible network of agents who facilitated the spread of printed materials: general merchants, grocers, apothecaries, inn keepers and private individuals. This shifting population of individuals discharged the role of bookshops in a limited way, by distributing books, magazines, newspapers and stationery, taking subscriptions for books and newspapers, and filling orders from catalogues. Clonmel was the main centre for the book trade in eighteenth-century Tipperary. The town had strong links with Kilkenny and Waterford, which had successful printing enterprises from the 1760s. Newspaper publishing took off in the early 1770s providing news and advertising to businesses and the administration. Most of the countyâ€™s printed needs were supplied from Dublin and local printing centres of Kilkenny, Waterford, Cork and Limerick. Booksellers, such as Edward Collins and George Heaslop in Clonmel, carried a wide and varied stock of modern editions, mostly produced by Dublin printing houses. Book production in the county was small scale, and mainly confined to pamphlets, devotional works, school books, official and commercial notices, and items of local interest. The nineteenth century saw an increase in book trade activity, with bookshops and libraries listed in several towns.\n\nIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the Irish language was widely spoken in Munster, especially among the Catholic population. While most items printed in the region were in English a number of Irish language texts were also produced and found a willing audience. Printers and booksellers serving the country market distributed Irish texts, and printers such as John Stacy in Carrick-on-Suir, Thomas Gorman and John Hackett in Clonmel, printed their own editions. While Irish typefaces were designed and cast in printing centres on the continent, such as Louvain, Rome and Paris in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and were available in Dublin from the late eighteenth century, they were not among the typefaces available to a provincial printer. The devotional texts printed in Carrick and Clonmel used Roman, a type to be found in a regular provincial workshop.\n\nBook Trade Personnel in Eighteenth-Century Tipperary\n\nReferences:\n\nAnthologia Hibernica, 1793-1794.

They supplied books, magazines, stationery and patent medicines to the citizens of Cork. As newspaper publishers they printed foreign and domestic news, carried notices of shipping and the cost of basic commodities and advertised the services of their fellow tradesmen in the city and in surrounding towns. George Busteedâ€™s business life is confined to less than a decade, but John Busteed spent fifty years in the book trade in Cork city, Ennis, County Clare, and Tralee, County Kerry, and his publication of a range of newspapers ensured his place in the histories of these counties. Johnâ€™s early career, spanning a decade, was spent in Cork, where he had his printing office and bookshop in the busy heart of the city. He succeeded George Busteed, probably his brother, as publisher of The Corke Chronicle in 1769. Following a short stay in Ennis, Co Clare, he moved to Tralee in 1780 as postmaster, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was part of an extended family of printers, and his sons established and ran newspaper and printing businesses in several different counties until the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nGeorge Busteed (1762-1769):\n\nGeorge Busteed was printer, bookseller and newspaper publisher in Cork from at least 1762, at Castle Street from 1764 to 1766, moving to nearby Paul Street from 1766 to 1769. George married Mary Henny at St Finbarrâ€™s Cathedral on 10 August 1762 (St Finbarrâ€™s Registers; Marriage Licence Bonds, diocese of Cork and Ross, 1762). They had at least four children, Frances (born on 31 May 1763), Elizabeth (died September 1767), Mary (died June 1768), and John (died in May 1770) (St Finbarrâ€™s Registers). He ceased trading after 1769, possibly having retired; he was still alive in May 1770 when his son John died. George may have been Johnâ€™s brother, but when Johnâ€™s mother, Frances Busteed, died and was buried at St Finbarrâ€™s, Cork, in February 1772 there was no mention of George in the newspaper notice, so if they were brothers he may already have been deceased (St Finbarrâ€™s Registers; Hibernian Chronicle, 17 Feb 1772; Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 19-22 Feb 1772). It is likely that Georgeâ€™s daughter was the Frances who married Thomas Saunders Knox, printer in Ennis, proprietor of The Clare Journal, and one-time partner of John Busteed, and was mother of John Busteed Knox. Frances and Thomas Knox lived at Jail Street (now Oâ€™Connell Street), Ennis. Georgeâ€™s widow, Mary, died at Jail Street, Ennis, in August 1807; this would fit if Frances Knox was her daughter (Clare Journal, 10 Aug 1807; Ennis Chronicle, 12 Aug 1807; Limerick Gazette, 14 Aug 1807). When Thomas Saunders Knox died in 1802 (Clare Journal, 1 Apr 1802; Ennis Chronicle, 29 Mar 1802), Frances became proprietor of The Clare Journal, and when her son John Busteed Knox (born 1792) came of age he became its editor. This business arrangement lasted until 1846 (Slaterâ€™s Directory 1846) and Francesâ€™s death on 29 September of that year (Freemanâ€™s Journal, 3 Oct 1846).\n\nJohn Busteed (1768-1819):\n\nJohn Busteedâ€™s career began in Cork as printer, newspaper publisher and bookseller. He was the son of Richard Busteed and Frances McCormick (Marriage Licence Bonds, diocese of Cork and Ross, March 1738/9). He married Miss Sarah Saunders (or Sanders) at Christ Church, Cork, on 28 October 1770 (Marriage Licence Bonds, diocese of Cork and Ross; 1770; Hibernian Chronicle, 29 Oct 1770; Cork Evening Post, 29 Oct 1770). Sarah may have been a relative of Thomas Saunders Knox, printer and newspaper publisher in Cork, who later became Johnâ€™s business partner. John Busteed remained in Cork for about ten years, before moving to Ennis, County Clare, by 1778. In 1780 he established his printing office in Tralee, County Kerry, where he remained, and for more than half a century he and his sons ran a successful business there. Sarah died in Tralee in January 1782 (Cork Evening Post, 4 Feb 1782). Shortly afterwards John remarried and with his second wife, Catherine Hilliard, had eight children (irishgenealogy.ie online), Richard (born 31 May 1783), William Hilliard (born 5 Dec 1784, died 12 Feb 1824), George Washington (born 1786, died 1859), John (born 11 Jul 1788, died 14 Jul 1863), Morgan Oâ€™Connell (born 12 Jan 1790, died 27 Jan 1830), Frances / Francis (born 5 / 6 Jan 1793), Barbara (born 12 Oct 1794), and Thomas Ellis Emmett (born 15 Aug 1797). John junior joined him in business in Tralee about 1809, and by 1813 at least one other son joined the business, which became Busteed and Sons. John senior died on 4 March 1819 (Clare Journal, 8 Mar 1819. Southern Reporter, 13 Mar 1819). His widow, Catherine, lived until 27 February 1830 (Kerry Evening Post, 3 Mar 1830). In 1834 John and Catherineâ€™s daughter, Barbara, married her cousin John Busteed Knox, son of Frances and Thomas Saunders Knox (irishgenealogy.ie; Clare Journal, 5 Jun 1834), and they lived in Ennis, where he was publisher and editor of The Clare Journal.\n\nCork Evening Post, 7 Feb 1782, death notice for Sarah Busteed.\n\nCork:\n\nGeorge Busteed printed and published The Corke Chronicle, or Universal Register in Cork from late 1763. Early issues covering the years 1765 to 1769 are held in Cork City Library and issues covering 1770 to 1772 are held in University College Cork. The paper was issued twice weekly at a cost of 6s.6d. to city subscribers and 2d. per issue to non subscribers during the theatrical season (Corke Chronicle, 19 Aug 1765). In 1764 he advertised for a â€˜sober carefulâ€™ messenger to deliver the paper to the country (Corke Chronicle, 31 Dec 1764). Subscriptions were taken in surrounding towns by Mr Kennedy Hayes, apothecary and post master in Mallow, Mr Howell Powell, schoolmaster in Bandon, Mrs Fowlue in Kinsale and Edward Crofton, stationer in Kilkenny (Corke Chronicle, 19 Aug 1765). Busteed offered his subscribers an extra news sheet, the Corke Mercury, published on Saturdays when the English mails arrived, and advertisements from the Chronicle were inserted gratis in the Mercury (Corke Chronicle, 24 Jul 1766). By 1767 the cost of the paper had reduced substantially to 5s.5d. per annum and a halfpenny per issue (Corke Chronicle, 26 Mar 1767; 2 Apr 1767). The title of the paper was changed to The Corke Chronicle, or Free Intelligencer in October 1768 (Corke Chronicle, 14 Oct 1768). In February 1767 Busteed established a General Public Register Office at his printing office in Paul Street, for buying and selling goods and services, offering or seeking employment, borrowing or lending money, and buying, selling or letting houses and lands: a first in the city of Cork (Corke Chronicle, 16 Feb 1767). For a small registration fee buyers and sellers could advertise in the office, and for no extra charge advertisements were carried in the Corke Chronicle. This office continued for many years and a full page of the newspaper was given over to Register Office advertisements (Corke Chronicle, 23 Apr 1767; 27 Jul 1769; 25 Jan 1770).\n\nThe Corke Chronicle, 31 Dec 1764, masthead\n\nDuring the theatrical season of 1765 the Chronicle began to publish attacks on the Theatre Royal company in Cork, instigated by local critics of the visiting repertory group from Dublin, led by Spranger Barry (Clarke 1965, pp 89-93). The Cork theatrical season took place from August to October, as troupes of players came to Cork at the close of the Crow Street season in Dublin. Local theatergoers criticised the quality of the productions and the poor performances of the actors. The company was so aggrieved that a law suit was brought against Busteed for â€˜publishing a false and scandalous paperâ€™, which was later dropped. The following year further charges were brought against Busteed, and they contrived his arrest on 5 September 1766, after a day in jail he was released on bail of Â£2,000 (Clarke 1765, pp 92-93; Corke Chronicle, 28 Aug 1766). The row played out in the columns of the Chronicle for the season under the heading â€˜Theatrical intelligenceâ€™ (Corke Chronicle, 21 Jul 1766; 18 Aug 1766; 8 Sep 1766; 20 Oct 1766). In November Busteed advertised a subscription project, Theatrical intelligence: a brief criticism on the merits and demerits of theatrical performers, who have appeared on the Corke stage, in the year 1764, 1765 and 1766, based on letters and essays published in the Chronicle (Corke Chronicle, 30 Oct 1766; 6 Nov 1766; 4 Dec 1766). The publication, â€˜in a neat pocket volume on a beautiful type and good writing paperâ€™, was priced at 2s.8Â½d., stitched in blue paper (Corke Chronicle, 4 Dec 1766). Clarke considers this a mock advertisement, but the publication of such a pamphlet was quite feasible (Clarke 1965, p. 92). The advertisement itself has every appearance of a genuine proposal to publish, with conditions of sale and noting an introductory preface on the dangers of attacking the liberty of the press. No copies are known to survive (English Short Title Catalogue online), but unbound ephemeral pamphlets have a poor survival rate.\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing Castle Street and Paul Street.\n\nIn June 1766 following a dispute with his landlord, George Hughes, glazier, George Busteed quit his house in Castle Street (Corke Chronicle, 7 Jul 1766). He announced his move from Castle Street to Paul Street, at the corner of Brown Street, where he hoped to carry on the business in a more extensive manner, having invested in a new printing press (Corke Chronicle, 30 Jun 1766). In March 1768 he moved again to another premises on Paul Street, across the street from his old printing office (Corke Chronicle, 7 Mar 1768). From 1765 to 1768 George received payment from Cork Corporation for printing work (Caulfield 1876, pp 790, 808, 813, 827, 835). It is likely that this was for printing official notices; on 16 December 1768 he was paid for printing the assize of bread for one year. Printing for city and town administrations and official bodies was a lucrative contract, providing a regular income.\n\nHis bookshop in Paul Street carried a range of London and Dublin publications, patent medicines and snuff. He stocked religious books such as A golden treasury for the children of God (London, 1762, part two 1764) and a subscription edition of a proselytising pamphlet An essay for the conversion of the Irish by Sir Richard Cox, a small duodecimo volume selling for 1s.7Â½d. sewed in blue paper. Agents for the Corke Chronicle also acted as subscription agents for the pamphlet: Edward Crofton, stationer in Kilkenny, Howell Powell, schoolmaster in Bandon, the Widow Fowlue in Kinsale, and John Clark in Youghal. Those subscribers who wished to distribute the tract to the poor could purchase six copies and get the seventh free (Corke Chronicle, 6 Mar 1766). He was subscription agent for a number of substantial works, including a Dublin edition printed by Ann Leathley of An ecclesiastical history by John Lawrence Mosheim, in four volumes octavo for Â£1.1s.8d. to subscribers and Â£1.4s. to non subscribers, neatly bound and lettered (Dublin, 1767), and the London edition of The complete dictionary of arts and sciences (Corke Chronicle, 16 Dec 1765). The Dictionary was illustrated with 150 copper plates, and selling in 50 weekly parts for a British sixpence (6Â½d. Irish) per number, the completed work would come to three large folio volumes (London, 1764, 1765, 1766). Busteed required a minimum of 50 subscribers for the Dictionary, and the parts would be imported once a month and delivered to subscribersâ€™ houses in town or sent by messenger along with their newspapers to Kinsale, Bandon, Mallow and other towns (Corke Chronicle, 16 Dec 1765). He advertised a list of new books from London that were published in parts, all selling for 6Â½d. per number. They included Mortimerâ€™s History of England in 92 parts, with plates, portraits and maps, coming to two volumes folio when completed (London, 1764-1766), A new system of geography by Daniel Fenning and Joseph Collier in 75 parts, coming to two volumes folio, with plates, portraits and maps (London 1764, 1765), Cunninghamâ€™s Law dictionary in 76 parts, Lloydâ€™s History of England in 50 parts, to be completed in five volumes octavo with plates (London, 1764), Riderâ€™s Family bible in 143 numbers, complete in three volumes folio with plates and maps (London, 1763-1767), and the Grand imperial bible in 58 parts (London, 1764-1766) (Corke Chronicle, 6 Mar 1766).\n\nCorke Chronicle, 27 Jul 1769, masthead\n\nGeorge continued as printer of The Corke Chronicle until early 1769 (Corke Chronicle, 20 April 1769), when it was taken over by John Busteed (Corke Chronicle, 27 Jul 1769). The change of proprietorship occurred under something of a cloud. In his notice to the public John Busteed noted â€˜He cannot harbour the least imagination, that any gentleman of humanity, will withdraw his beneficent countenance, from a disconsolate family, by reason of the misconduct of an individualâ€™ (Corke Chronicle, 27 Jul 1769). It is not clear what misconduct was involved, whether it was a financial issue, or something else. No issues of the Corke Chronicle survive between 20 April 1769, when George is proprietor, and 27 July 1769, when John has taken over. A notice carried in The Cork Evening Post (1 Jun 1769) reproduces an apology from Mr Busteed published in the Corke Chronicle of 27 instant (May) â€˜the printer is concerned to find that a letter which was unguardedly inserted in his paper of the 25th instant, hath given great offence to several gentlemen of weight and consequence â€¦ [he] voluntarily begs pardon for printing so scurrilous and so infamous a letter calculated (as he has since discovered) to prejudice the reputation of a gentleman of eminence and character in this city, and for whom he has a particular respectâ€™. Whether the offence caused to an important individual was enough to put him out of business is unclear.\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing North Main Street and Flag Lane.\n\nJohn Busteed began his business in Cork about 1768, first at Paul Street, moving to Flackâ€™s (Flag) Lane, opposite St Peterâ€™s church in North Main Street by 1771, and then by at least 1775 to Castle Street, near the Exchange. From the start he was involved with the publication of newspapers. He was probably the brother of George Busteed, who had his business in Paul Street until 1769. George printed and published The Corke Chronicle from 1763 to 1769, and Johnâ€™s first venture was publication of the same newspaper from 1769 to 1772. When he took over publication of the paper in July 1769 he stated his intention to remain in the shop in Paul Street â€˜till such time as a convenient shop can be procured, in which he proposes carrying on the bookselling business, in as extensive a manner as the city and county of Cork will encourageâ€™(Corke Chronicle, 27 Jul 1769). In 1770 John advertised for an apprentice â€˜a Protestant lad, of reputable parentsâ€™ ((Corke Chronicle, 11 Jan 1770). In January 1771 he set up his printing office in Flackâ€™s Lane where he shared the premises with the silk weaving and embroidery business run by the Saunders family (Corke Chronicle, 31 Jan 1771; 21 Nov 1771), the same family name as his wife, Sarah. His name was â€˜in large characters, upon a plate, over the doorâ€™ (Corke Chronicle, 21 Nov 1771). As well as printing the twice weekly issues of the paper, Busteed offered printing services to merchants and shopkeepers, for handbills and â€˜all other kinds of printingâ€™ at the most reasonable rates (Corke Chronicle, 1 Jan 1770; 21 Nov 1771; 2 Jan 1772).\n\nThe Corke Chronicle was published twice a week, on Monday and Thursday, at a subscription rate of a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum covered and eight English shillings (8s.8d. Irish) loose for delivery to Youghal, Middleton, Mallow, Kinsale and Bandon, with agents John Clarke in Youghal, Kennedy Hayes in Mallow and James Hawes in Bandon delivering them to subscribers locally (Corke Chronicle, 9 Oct 1769). The cost was 7s.7d. per annum for city subscribers in 1772 (Corke Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). A proposal to publish the newspaper three times a week was issued in early 1770, city subscribers would pay a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum, while country subscribers would pay 13s. per annum for loose papers, or 17s.4d. for covered papers (Corke Chronicle, 1 Feb 1770). A total of 600 subscribers were required by April 1770 before the new publication schedule would come into effect. However, as no issue of the Saturday paper has survived, and the original subscription rate still pertained two years later, it is likely that sufficient subscribers were not signed up. The distribution of the paper covered a wide range of towns in the county, as well as city subscribers, newspapers were delivered by messengers to Mallow, Doneraile, Kanturk, Newmarket, Youghal, Middleton, Castlemartyr, Kinsale and Bandon (Corke Chronicle, 28 May 1770). No copies of the newspaper after survived after 2 January 1772.\n\nAt his bookshop John Busteed stocked books, literary magazines, almanacs, patent medicines and stationery, and advertisements for books and magazines were inserted in the Corke Chronicle. Advertisements usually carry the date of the original insertion and are often repeated for up to a year, in cases of poor survival of issues this helps to pinpoint the original notices. In 1770 he advertised Emilius and Sophia by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, translated into English by Thomas Nugent. This translation of Ã‰mile, ou de lâ€™Ã©ducation, published in two volumes in Dublin about 1765, was selling for 6s.6d. bound in calf (Corke Chronicle, 1 Feb 1770). In January 1771 he advertised a group of popular new novels in small format duodecimo editions, published in London and Dublin in that year, The vicar of Bray in two volumes (2s.8d.), The man of feeling by Henry MacKenzie, which went into two editions in 1771 (2s.8d.), and The history of Sir William Harrington in four volumes (5s.5d.) (Corke Chronicle, [31 Jan 1771]; 18 Nov 1771). He offered a new edition of Alexander Popeâ€™s Works in six volumes, a fine edition printed by James Potts and James Williams in Dublin in 1770, â€˜printed on a beautiful paper and a new typeâ€™ with copper plate cuts (Corke Chronicle, [31 Jan 1771]; 18 Nov 1771). At the end of the year he advertised Tobias Smollettâ€™s The expedition of Humphrey Clinker in two volumes duodecimo bound for 5s.5d., this is the Dublin edition printed by a group of booksellers, based on the three volume London edition published in 1771 (Corke Chronicle, 21 Nov 1771). For the farmer or country gentleman he advertised The complete grazier, or gentleman and farmerâ€™s directory for 2s.8Â½d. bound in calf (Corke Chronicle, 1 Feb 1770), and Every man his own gardener by John Abercrombie and Thomas Mawe, gardener to the Duke of Leeds, â€˜adorned with an elegant copper plate frontiepieceâ€™, selling for 4s.4d. bound (Corke Chronicle, 29 Aug 1771; 7 Nov 1771). These titles are likely the Dublin editions printed by James Potts in 1767 and 1768 respectively. He also advertised The historical, political and literary register for 1769, for 6s.6d. neatly bound, which he noted would be continued annually (Corke Chronicle, [31 Jan 1771]; 23 Dec 1771). For young readers he listed two titles of interest, A genteel present for young ladies and gentlemen, â€˜elegantly printed in two handsome pocket volumes, and ornamented with neat engravingsâ€™ priced at 5s.5d., and The works of the Marchioness de Lambert (Corke Chronicle, 18 Nov 1771).In August 1771 he printed an advertisement for a new newspaper published in Dublin, The Hibernian Journal, or Chronicle of Liberty, at a reduced subscription rate and offering all back issues from the first number (Corke Chronicle, [29 Aug 1771]; 21 Nov 1771).\n\nIn September 1771, with William Sargent, he opened a bookshop in Paul Street, opposite St Paulâ€™s church. His advertisement, dated 26 September, offered a large variety of stationery, Irish and imported paper and â€˜all the new publicationsâ€™ (Corke Chronicle, 7 Nov 1771). Busteed and Sargent were regularly supplied with monthly issues of The Ladyâ€™s Magazine from London and The Hibernian Magazine from Dublin (Corke Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). The currency of new works advertised is striking, many published within the year, most are likely to have been Dublin reprints of London originals, where the Dublin editions were often in smaller format or otherwise cheaper productions. They were selling William Guthrieâ€™s A new geographical, historical and commercial grammar, illustrated with maps, published in octavo format in 1771 in London and reprinted in Dublin, bound and lettered for 6s.6d. (Corke Chronicle, 18 Nov 1771). Two titles were offered in December 1771, Anecdotes of a convent in two volumes for 5s.5d. and Oliver Goldsmithâ€™s History of England in four volumes for 10s.10d. (Corke Chronicle, 23 Dec 1771). Anecdotes was the Dublin edition of 1771 in two volumes duodecimo, reprinted from the London three volume octavo edition of 1771. Goldsmithâ€™s History was also likely to be the Dublin edition of 1771, based on the cost, the London edition was in the larger octavo format, with illustrations and portraits, while the Dublin edition was in duodecimo. They were selling two titles by Arthur Young, The farmerâ€™s guide in hiring and stocking farms, illustrated with copper plates and bound in two volumes octavo for 8s.8d., and A six monthâ€™s tour through the North of England, available in three volumes octavo for 19s.6d. (Corke Chronicle, 18 Nov 1771; 21 Nov 1771). There were London and Dublin editions of both titles, A six monthâ€™s tour was the Dublin edition containing engraved plates, published by a group of booksellers in 1770, reprinted from the four volume London edition. For Christmas 1771 Busteed and Sargeant targeted the â€˜ladies of Corke, Mallow, Bandon, Kinsale, Youghallâ€™ and â€˜all the fair readers of this paperâ€™ with notice of The Ladyâ€™s Magazine for October for 6Â½d., and The ladies pocket book for 1772 (Corke Chronicle, 23 Dec 1771), both published in London. These publications were aimed specifically at women readers, as well as a range of literary and topical articles and poetry, they included copper plate portraits, engraved sheet plates for sewing and embroidery, music and songs. The pocket book was designed as a gift for Christmas or new year in a range of bindings: â€˜neatly bound in red, with pockets for letters 2s.4d., with gilt covers 1s.7Â½d., with gilt leaves 2s.2d., elegantly bound in Turkey leather 5s.5d.â€™ (Corke Chronicle, [9 Dec 1771]; 23 Dec 1771).\n\nFrom about 1771 to 1776, in partnership with William Sargent, John published a new newspaper, The Hibernian Morning Post or Literary Chronicle (Hibernian Journal, 19 Apr 1773). The earliest surviving issue is from February 1775, which is volume IV, indicating a start date of 1771 (Hibernian Morning Post, 20-23 Feb 1775). This twice weekly newspaper, published on Mondays and Thursdays, cost 2d. per issue. During its lifetime news from America was at a premium, Cork was a major port of call for transatlantic vessels, and Cork newspapers often had first news from America. In July 1775 Busteed announced the arrival of three ships from America carrying newspapers from Philadelphia and Baltimore, and in August another from New York (Hibernian Morning Post, 24-27 Jul 1775; 17-21 Aug 1775). Continental news from Holland, France and Flanders came on British packets (Hibernian Morning Post, 17-21 Aug 1775). Sargentâ€™s death in June 1776 may have ended the venture (Finnâ€™s Leinster Journal, 26-29 Jun 1776), the last surviving issue is from 25-29 April 1776. In August 1775 John Busteed was Cork agent for a new newspaper published in Tralee, County Kerry, The Kerry Journal, published twice a week, and costing three crowns (15s.) a year to subscribers (Hibernian Morning Post, 31 Augâ€“4 Sep 1775).\n\nFrom his earliest advertising John Busteed announced his printing services. In addition to newspaper production much of his printing work would have involved jobbing printing, executing official notices, and printed items for commerce, such as advertising hand bills, printed labels, bill heads and trade cards (Corke Chronicle, 2 Jan 1772). Like George, who had printed for Cork Corporation from 1765 to 1768, John continued with this work from 5 November 1768 to 1776, printing the assize of bread and other notices and supplying newspapers (Caulfield 1876, pp 846; 883; 891; 896). However, in July 1776 the Council ordered â€˜that John Busteed be no longer imployed for printing and the taking his newspapers be discontinuedâ€™ (Caulfield 1876, p. 909). He did not undertake major book publication at any time in his career. While working in Cork in 1775 he printed a work of religious controversy, Some strictures on the Scotch doctorâ€™s supplement to his curious apology for the Venerable Servetus (Author of The Querist 1775). This 40 page pamphlet was addressed to the Scotch doctor (Patrick Blair, M.D., of Cork) and â€˜humbly inscribed to the good people of Corkâ€™. It was published in response to Blairâ€™s Thoughts on nature and religion, printed in Cork the previous year (Blair 1774; Richards 1774). Associated with this publication, Busteed penned his own 15 page pamphlet, A letter from Mr John Busteed, to P.B. [Patrick Blair], Esq. M.D., printed in small format 24mo by his business partner, William Sargent, it is undated, but 1775 is the likely date.\n\nHis extensive stock of plays and farces, selling at 6Â½d. each, were advertised to coincide with the season at the Theatre Royal in July and August 1775 (Hibernian Morning Post, 21-24 Aug 1775). Most of the plays were current, having been performed in Cork in the previous two or three years (Clark 1965). He had business connections with booksellers in Dublin and Limerick for the sale of books and magazines. He regularly advertised the monthly issues of The Hibernian Magazine, published in Dublin, first by James Potts, and later by Thomas Walker. He acted as subscription agent for several works. In 1775 he was agent for The memoirs and adventures of Robert Kirk, late of the Royal Highland Regiment, published in Limerick by John Ferrar (Hibernian Morning Post, 20-23 Feb 1775). At the time of publication Kirk was serving with the 45th regiment in Limerick. Cheaply produced in the diminutive sextodecimo format, the 128 page volume was priced at a British shilling (1s.1d. Irish) â€˜neatly printed in a pocket volume, sewed in blue paperâ€™. This was a local publication, with a small print run, probably 200 or less. It attracted just 123 subscribers for 158 copies of the book, the majority of purchasers were the authorâ€™s colleagues in the 45th and other regiments. The book deals with the American War of Independence, in which Kirk was a participant, with descriptions of the peoples, customs, commerce and landscape of North America.\n\nHibernian Journal, 28 Apr-1 May 1775, advertisement for The exemplary life of the pious Lady Guion.
