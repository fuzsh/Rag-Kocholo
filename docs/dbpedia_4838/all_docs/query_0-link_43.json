FOR THE CLONMEL LIBRARY COMMITTEE. 1907. ^^/J-^/AJ-Z PREFACE JN presenting to the Subscribers the HISTORY OF ClONMEL, the Editor feels that an apology is due for the long delay — nearly five years, since the prospectus was issued. During three of these, unforeseen events interrupted the work, and indeed, separated him from reading altogether. But the delay was not without some advantage. Extended inquiries were made for original mater- ial, in particular for the \"Annals of Clonmel,\" which existed in the time of Sir James Ware,* The old corporation books were also sought for. Though little was discovered, one is thereby enabled to go to press with the assurance that the ''History of Clonmel\" is as complete as it is now possible to make it. Those who are acquainted with the works of Gilbert, Hardiman, Caulfield and others, will miss in the earlier chapters that minute detail, those old-world pictures of burgher life which give local histories most of their value and all their charm. But in extenuation, it is to be observed that the present work was gathered exclusively from outside and public sources. The early municipal records which form the basis of the history of Dublin, Galway or Waterford, are here altogether wanting- There is not a charter preserved, and scarcely a deed as old as the seventeenth century. The oldest minute book does not go beyond 1744, and even then it is, for a century, a mere catalogue of names. There are no parish records. Family papers which elsewhere afford such valuable material, are inaccessible or not existing. So that the past of the town could be reconstructed only by painful gleaning in the Dublin Record Office, the Royal Irish Academy and the Bodleian Library. Among those who co-operated, special acknowledgment is due to Mr, J, F, Morrissey, of H,M, Public Record Office, himself a native of Clonmel, who furnished no fewer than one hundred and fifty folios of transcripts from the Pipe Rolls, Quit Rent records. Wills and Commonwealth Books, From Mr, Frederick /. Quinn, besides advice on many points, was obtained the Vaughan-Ryall Ledger (1680-1707), Mr. John F. O'Brien gave much infor- mation upon the corporate estate, tolls and the like. Among the other members of the Library Committee it will not be invidious to name Mr. James White, To him indeed, to his public spirit and generous labours, it is mainly due that the book has been undertaken at all, WILLIAM P.

INTRODUCTORY. CHE district of Cionmei in the beginning of documentary history was inhabited by a Celtic tribe who bore the name of the Deisi. Traces of an older people, probably non- Aryan, exist in some place names, those especially of prominent natural features, such as rivers and mountains /'^/A But whence this older race or races were, and what influences economic, customary or religious, they exercised on the Celtic Deisi cannot be determined at the present stage of ethnological inquiry /'W. The story which the Deisi told of themselves was this: they originally occupied a territory in Meath, now the barony of Deece, and were descended from a common ancestor, Fiacha Suidhe, brother of Con of the Hundred Battles who in the second century of the Christian era was monarch of Ireland. About the year 278 having attempted to place their chief, Aongus on the throne, they were defeated and driven into Munster, where Olioll Olum, king of that province settled them in the present County of Waterford. Increasing in power and numbers they passed the Suir towards the end of the fifth century, and drove the Ossorians out of the district north of the river which henceforward was known as Deise Tuaisceart or North Deise. Such, cleared of preternatural accretions, was the traditional account (c). Whatever truth it may contain, it is to be noted that the aboriginal name of the locality W1a$ femtn ran with the Celtic Deise Tuaisceart far into the historic period and the inference is that neither Ossorians nor Deisi supplanted the older race but simply conquered and coalesced with them. (a) For example : Liiij^aii, Clodaj^h, Mahon. Suir. But Rev. Dr. Hcncbry informs me that in the canton ol\" Lu/ern, Switzerland, there is a small river called the Sur which empties into the Sursee. (h) Professor Rhys, of O.xford, is of opinion that Druidism bespeaks a non-Aryan oriji^in. (c) Keatinj^, O' Flaherty, O'Heerin passim. The earliest narrative of these events is in the Bodleian (Laud 610, fol. 99) the language is middle Irish. B 2 History of Clonmel. From the introduction of Christianity onward the evidence becomes more reliable. It is probable that the Gospel was preached in the district by St. Patrick himself. The localities Ballypatrick and Glasspatrick preserve his name ; three ancient churches, Kiltagan, Killerk, and Kilmaloge, preserve those of his immediate disciples, while Donoughmore has from the earliest times been regarded as a Patrician foundation (d). In the tenth and eleventh centuries many traditions of the saint's visit to the Deisi were current, some of them fortunately finding their way into recognized biography. The Tripartite life has a very circumstantial account. Patrick then went into the southern Desi and set about building a church in Ard Patrick; and Lec-Patrick is there and the marks of his church, Derball son of Aedh opposed him, Derball said to Patrick, \" If you would remove that mountain there so that I could see Loch Lunga across it to the south, in Fera Maigh Feine [Fermoy barony] I would believe.\" Cenn Abhrat is the name of the mountain and Belach Legtha the name of the pass which was melted there. When the mountain began to dissolve Derball said that whatever he (Patrick) did would be of no use. Patrick said to Derball, \"There shall be no king nor bishop of your family and it will be permitted to the men of Munster to plunder you all every seventh year for ever as bare as a leek.\" As Patrick was in the district of the Desi awaiting the King of the country — Fergair the son of Rossa, Patrick said to him after his arrival, \" How slowly you come\"! \" The country is rough \" (said he), \" Quite true,\" said Patrick. \" There shall be no King from you for ever.\" \"What delayed you to-day\"? asked Patrick, \"The rain delayed us,\" said the King. \"Your meetings shall be showery for ever,\" said Patrick. Patrick's well is there and also the church of MacClairidh one of Patrick's people. And assemblies are not held by the Desi except at night because Patrick left that sentence upon them for it was towards night they went to him. Patrick then cursed the streams of that place because his books were drowned in them and the fishermen gave his people a refusal. Patrick said that they would not be fruitful notwithstanding their great profusion up to that time and that there would never be any mills upon them except the mills of strangers. He blessed the Suir moreover and the country around and it is fruitful in fish except the places where those streams (glaise) flow into it (e) Another tradition of the eleventh century, to which the scholarship of Ussher has given undue prominence, was that St. Declan preached to the Deisi before the coming of St. Patrick. That there were isolated Christians in the South of Ireland is almost certain, considering the close proximity of the Christian communities of Wales and Cornwall, but that St. Patrick (d) Glasspatrick now Glen Patrick was a distinct parish as late as the Down Survey, 1654. A rude stone chalice, long an object of popular veneration in Ballypatrick, is now in possession of Rev. P. Power, of Waterford. (e) Hennessy and others have identified this Deisi with \" Deisbeag,\" a district lying around Bruff ; the truth seems to be that the Tripartite is a redaction of older lives — such as the one in the Book of Armagh — nt^de by some one imperfectly acquainted with Munster topography. Not to speak of \" Patrick's Well \" with its extremely ancient Celtic cross, the names Lec-Patrick, Belach- Legtha, Cille MacClairidh, are all discoverable in South Tipperary. The monk Jocelyn, who wrote in the 12th century, makes Lec-Patrick the coronation stone of the Munster Kings on the Rock of Cashel (Ed. Messingham p. 35, Paris, 1624). Belach-Legtha seems to be the very remarkable pass in the Knockmeldown mountains now known as Bay Lough : a Bealanlogh in Co. Tipperary is found in a Piant of Elizabeth dated 1587. Cille Mac Clairidh is possibly Kilmoclear, north of Carrick. These localities may have been confused with Ardpatrick and Singland, in< Co. Limerick, by the compiler of the Tripartite. History of Clonmel. 3 found a Christian tribe and a regularly constituted diocese under the rule of St. Declan as the old legend of that saint relates, cannot now be maintained. At whatever time converted, it is clear that by the middle of the seventh century the whole population of the Deisi had embraced the Christian religion ; not only so, but with a fervour and an enthusiasm that led them to imitate the extreme asceticism of the East. Some such as St, Aidan of Bollendesert and St. Declan of Ardmore, retired into desert places after the manner of St. Anthony and St. Pachomius. Others as St. Cuan at Mothel, and St. Carthage of Lismore, set up religious communities, living together in stone cells or houses of wattle and cultivating the learning of the time. Others again fired with an indomitable missionary spirit carried their faith to the continent, and we hear of two great Deisi saints as wide asunder as Liege and Otranto. St. Farannan of Donoughmore is venerated as the founder of the abbey and town of Waser on the Meuse; while St. Cathaldus of Lismore is held in honour in the old Greek city of Tarentum at the extreme heel of Italy, In their pedigrees like the modern Spaniards, the Deisi were proud to emblazon the names of their saints, and we read in MacFirbisigh of St. Colman of Kilcash, St. Ronan of Kilronan, St. Ultan of Maghnidh, and others. The death of a notable ecclesiastic was recorded by the chroniclers with equal care to that of the chief himself. More curious still it is to read amid the annals of savage warfare how men retired to Lismore-Mochuda and in the quaint language of the annalist put themselves under the direction of a \" soul-friend \" and died there \" after the victory of penance.\" But only in asceticism did the Deisi copy the Eastern church ; an incident related by St. Bernard affords evidence of extraordinary religious tolerance. A cleric of Lismore denied the Real Presence. Being prosecuted by the laity before a meeting of the clergy he had permission granted him to defend his views. He stoutly maintained against St. Malachy who was present, that he had reason and truth on his side while on the other was the mere ipse dixit of the primate. Furthermore he accused the saint of dishonestly speaking against his real convictions. Yet we learn that the assembly merely declared him anathema and left him to the judgment of God. (f) Civilization went hand in hand with religion. It is often taken for granted that the Irish previous to the Anglo-Norman invasion, were little better than savages, and the murderous tribal warfare recorded in the annals is put in evidence. The truth is that in the fine arts as probably also in the useful ones they were far in advance of the English of the same period. The Lismore crozier apart from its artistic value bespeaks long experience (f) Life of St. Malachy by St. Bernard. Messingham, Paris, 1624, p. 368-9. 4 History of Clonmel. and great skill in the working of metals. The old church of Donoughmore may be instructively compared with contemporary ones in England such as Bradford-on-Avon. The clean cut ashlar of the windows together with the exquisite Hiberno-classic detail is removed from the barbaric English Romanesque by a whole cycle, (g) The most important epoch in the history of the Deisi from their conversion to the twelfth century was the invasion of the Danes. Their first appearance in the locality was in 864 when their fleet on the Blackwater was defeated and the fortified camp at Youghal, destroyed. The next year the Deisi were again victorious, Grimhbeolu, \"chief of the foreigners of Cork,\" being slain. During the following century and a half, despite many reverses, the Danes continued steadily to arrive. From the harbours they penetrated inland in their flat bottomed boats and having raided the monasteries and chieftains* strongholds swiftly disappeared again. Yet in the wake of the freebooters many came to trade and settle. Tradition credits them with being the builders of forts, bridges and even round towers. This much is certain that they were the founders of the great maritime cities and probably of some of the towns on navigable rivers also. There they carried on considerable trade, importing large quantities of wine from Poitou and exporting ox hides and other skins (h). Not having brought wives they interjnarrled with the Irish, and so came in the next generation to profess the Christian religion. Politically too they were soon identified with the Irish ; they took a part in the tribal wars, and at Clontarf some of them fought on the Irish side, while on the other hand some Irish fought with them. When the Danish community of Waterford petitioned for a bishop, the petition went naturally in the name of the Irish king (i). By the time that the Anglo-Normans arrived the North- men and the native Deisi were almost completely fused. We meet with such names as 'Heverbric' (Ivar O'Brick), *Ragnal O'Rigbardain ' (Reginald 0*Riordan), 'Imari O'Cathal' (Ivar O'Cahill) and others (j). The most notable occupant of the See of Lismore from St. Carthage down, was the Dano-Irish Gillechriost O'Connary, better known as Christianus, while in the defence of Waterford against Strongbow the leading part was taken by Malachy OThelan, chief of the Deisi. It is to the Danes that we are to look for the first beginnings of Clonmel. Making their way up the Suir to its navigable limit, the islands in the river (^) Appendix.

The home of the OThelans, Greenane, was close by, and with them as chiefs of the district the principal exchange of wine, iron, arms, and personal ornament would naturally be made. Tradition indeed has constantly traced the origin of Clonmpl to the Danes. The compiler of the Tripartite Life in the eleventh century speaks of the mills of the \" foreigners \" there. Without entering the region of mere speculation a few vestiges of the Danish settlement may be traced. The highest elevation of the old town, about one hundred yards west of the Main Guard, has always been pointed to as the site of the Castle of Clonmel (k). Lower down, the level land along the river now occupied by the eastern section of the town was known as late as a century ago as the \"Green.\" From what we know of Scandinavian settlements elsewhere, we can have no difficulty in recognising the fort- crowned hill as the ancient \"Thingmote,\" while along the foot of it was the unmistakably Danish \"Green\" or place of assembly. As illustrating the abiding character of legal institutions amid political disturbance, it may be observed that down to the beginning of the seventeenth century inquisitions were held and cases adjudicated on the Green. But the settlement of the Danes seems to have been of small importance. Girald Barry who visited Ireland in II84 describes the Suir as flowing through Ardfinnan and Tibarach (a hamlet below Kilsheelan now forgotten) to the sea ; there is no mention of Clonmel (l). fk) Sec note iti/ru. (I) The name of Clonmel so obviously inteliij^ihle to the Irish sixraker does not prove so easy on closer investigation. If it were discoverable in the ancient annals the question would lie at once set at rest, but it occurs at the earliest only in 17th century documents, -Keating and the Four Masters. Shaw Mason's \" Statistical Survey \" of Clonmel in the P.K.O., gives the popular tradition. '* Clonmel derived from Irish Clu^m a retreat and mcAlA honey which Burke (De Burgo, Hibernia Dominicana) translates \" Secessus Mellis.\" When it got this name not clearly known, many suppose from fertility of soil and richness of country in which it is situate. The inhabitants have among them the following tradition. I/Oiig before the inhabitants of this country were converted to Christianity the site of this town being all an uncultivated tract of land on both sides of the Suir some of the aborigines intended to build a large castle, and like the antient Greeks and Romans they undertook nothing of importance without some kind of omen. Taking a large swarm of bees for their guides which they accidentally met, they determined to build wherever the wandering insects first settled. Accordingly they erected a castle and called it CluAin Ule^lA which name it always retained till it was lately [circa 18 10] thrown down by Mr. John Harvey to the rear of whose house in the Main Street and directly opposite Flag Lane it stood.\" Though the 17th century authorities give CluAin me-AlA there are very strong reasons for doubting the etymology. The careful inquirer will hear the older townsfolk who are uninfluenced by literary tradition pronounce \" Clomell \" (accent on sejond syllable). Kickham who reproduced dialect peculiarities with absolute fidelity makes Phil Lsihy in \" Knocknagow \" state \" 'Twas the corn med a town of Clomell.\" Now this is supported by the earliest forms of the name in state papers and other public records. We find ' Clumell ' (1215), 'Clomele' (1243), 'Clomele' (1268), Clomeil' (1291), 'Clomer (1302), 'Clomell' (1381), ' Clomel' (1429). This would point to the old Irish Ctiu met. The word Cltti means a portion or division and is often used in connection with land in the early MSS. The other word may be a proper name, and it is to be noted that the Deisi pedigree contains the name melt, daughter of Ercbran, who became wife of Crimthan, King of Ui Cinnselagh. So that the true interpretation of Cloinnel may be *' Mell's Lot \" rather than \" Honeyvale.\" The later form of the name took shape as the significance of the former was forgotten. Just as in H.M. navy the ship Bdlcrophon is known by the more intelligible \" Billy Kufifian.\" Ohapxe^r II. FEUDAL CLONMEL, JT is one of the commonplaces of Irish history that at the time of the English invasion, the whole country was parcelled out among the Anglo-Norman adventurers and that, so far as the power and law of England could effect it, the Irish dominion of the land ceased, \" All Ireland,\" writes Sir John Davis, \"was cantonized among ten persons of the English nation \"; and he gives the interesting detail that \" Otto de Grandison obtained a grant of all Tipperary \" (m). Yet this statement sanctioned as it is even by original inquirers such as Prendergast and Richey is altogether wide of the facts (n). To take a few local instances. In 1204 Donal OThelan son of the defender of Waterford against Strongbow, still held the \"province\" of Dungarvan with two other cantreds in Waterford. Forty years later his son Ros OThelan, together with Murrough O'Brien of Aherlow, and Richard MacCormacan of the Deisi, as independent chiefs were invited by Henry III. to help in the war against the Scots (0). And so far from Otto de Grandison being granted all Tipperary, the truth is that personage did not arrive in Ireland for a full century subsequent to the invasion and then received only a portion of the Burgh estates in that county. Though the records of Henry II. and John are in great part lost, the Pipe rolls of Edward I. enable us to form a tolerable notion of the Anglo-Norman settlement of Tipperary. For the sheriffs of the county, John de Coventry (lu) A Discovery of the True Causes VVhy Ireland was never Subdued — London 16 13. (u) Cromwellian Settlement 2 Ed. p. 17.

Now these rents were paid in the names not of the tenants then living, but in those of the original grantees or their immediate descendants. From the rolls therefore it appears that in the beginning of the thirteenth century the southern boundary of the county was formed by the Suir as far as Cahir, and thence by the Galtees. East and north the boundaries were substantially as at present, but westwards the county included some three of the present baronies of Limerick and extended to within a few miles of that city. Upon this territory were set down twenty-two feudarii or tenants holding immediately of the King, and about six times that number of sub- feudarii. The Irish for the most part were left undisturbed. We hear only of the O'Mearas driven into North Tipperary from the rich lands of lifa and OfFa (p). The O'Neills of Ballyneale, the O'Lonergans of Cahir, the Quirkes of Clanwilliam, the Ryans of Owney, the Fogartys of Ely, the Meaghers of Ikerrin and several smaller septs, still lived on the lands as they had probably done since the time of Christ. The Anglo-Norman baron or tenant in capite built his mound, erected a stockade, surrounded himself with his free tenants and demanded tribute which the Irish paid when he was strong enough to enforce it (q). The twenty-two baronial feuds were created at different times and were of very unequal extent. A list of them drawn up about 1240 with the services payable to the King in time of war, is found in the Pipe rolls. Though not invariably, the services were generally proportioned to the value and extent of the lands conveyed, \" From Richard de Burgh, XVII Knights' services, a half and a third.

It will be observed that out of the sixty two and a half knight services, forty-eight were rendered by three barons, De Burgh, Lc Butler and De Worcester. De Burgh was son of William FitzAdelm, lord lieutenant under Henry II., a man according to Cambrensis, conspicuous among his fellow adventurers for covetousness and ambition. FitzAdelm as the earliest grantee obtained the choice lands of that county, the 'Golden Vale' from Cashel to Limerick, and the alluvial district from Clonmel to Carrick. The ruins of Athassel, the largest of Irish abbeys, where he and his sons down to the Red Earl of Ulster lie buried, still witness to his magnificence. The junior branches of his family became more Irish than the Irish themselves, and as the \"Clan William\" held sway in the baronies which bear their name in Tipperary and Limerick, down to the time of Elizabeth. More extensive though not so fertile was the district granted to Theobald Butler in 1200. It included the five baronies of Ely O'Carrol, Eliogarthy, Owney and Arra, Owney O'Callaghan, Owney O'Heflfernan and the half barony of Killaloe (s). The third of the great feuds was created in favour of Philip of Worcester, uncle of William, whose name appears on the roll. It embraced the baronies of Slievardagh, Comsey, Owney Cashel (now Middlethird), Ardfinnan and Muskerry Quirke, the head or baronial castles being Knockgraffon, Ardmayle and Kiltinan (i). These three great feudarii created numerous sub-infeudations. Under the Butlers were the Purcells, Graces (Le Gros), Morrises (De Monte Marisco), Boy tons, Fannings, and others.

Having settled on their allotments the Anglo-Normans proceeded to open communications through the county. The two approaches into Tipperary were the ** tougher\" in the bog of Ely east of Thurles, and the passage from South Ossory by Mullinahone. The former was guarded by the castle of Adlongport (Longford Pass) held by Elias FitzNorman. In 1242 Maurice FitzGeraJd, justiciary, was ordered to cut down the wood of Thomas St. Aubyn in the pass of Comsy, between Fethard and the marches of Ossory, \" that a safe way might be opened for merchants and wayfarers, the King having heard that many persons peaceably passing there had been killed and others robbed \" (11), Southwards the great road between Cashel and Lismore was protected at the ford of Ardfinnan by the Knights Hospitallers settled there. The communication with Limerick by the wooden bridge at Ballindrehid was maintained by the neighbouring castle of Knock- graflfon. Many of these Anglo-Norman roads are still traceable with the aid of the ordnance maps, and it will be found that in nearly all cases they follow the line of the old castles. Communications being established, the new settlers obtained charters for holding fairs in certain districts, and in some instances founded municipal communities. If we had not the evidence of the public records it would be difficult to believe that such places as Athassel, Ardfinnan and Lisronagh were once corporate towns. Yet in 1293 the commonalty of Athassel with their provost Roger Thuberville were fined for trespass. Edward II. in 1 31 1 at the instance of the Bishop of Lismore granted bridge toll to the \" bailiffs and good men of Ardfynan,\" while Henry IV. granted to the provost and commons of Lisronagh exemption from taxes \"for the building and rehabilitation of their town burnt by the FitzGeralds \" (v). Throughout the thirteenth century the feudal system was maintained unbroken. The King's officers, sheriffs, escheators and coroners were regularly appointed and the baronial and manor courts were in full operation. The accounts in the Pipe rolls exhibit the profits of the King's courts, fines, reliefs, marriage compositions, scutage payments, escheats, down to the smallest detail. The dull routine of the figures is occasionally relieved by such items as [1254] \"£3 14s. od. fine to be levied on the town of Cashel for the escape of a thief from the parish church [where he had been kept] for want of a prison.'Ytyy. In the same year a thief took (n) State Papers, Sweetman, p. 385. (%^} Pipe Rolls Ed. I. Patent Rolls Ed. II. & Hen. IV. (w) Account of William de Waylande, Sheriff of Tipperary, 39 Hen.

In 1275 David, Archbishop of Cashel, accounted for 125 marks out of the goods of Reginald Maccot a usurer ^jrA Henry of Kilsheelan was fined for selling wine contrary to the assize (legal price), while several were fined for false weights and measures. So exhaustive indeed are the particulars, that the few fragments of the rolls of Henry III. and Edward I. surviving, are enough to show that the Anglo-Norman settlement of Tipperary was thorough and complete. But the feudal system in Ireland laboured under some fatal defects. At the head stood the justiciary representing the King. Often selected from one of the eight or so ruling families, that functionary instead of being the controlling power and the bond of peace, became a mere centre of intrigue and conflict. Occasionally but worse still, some adventurer climbed into the position, only to use it for traffic in the King's justice and King's patronage. Such a man was Stephen de Fulburne, Bishop of Waterford, who was appointed justiciary in 1 282. \" Hardly any one\" it was said \"can hold office, or be sheriif, or constable of a castle unless he gives or sells land to the justiciary or bestows on him half the fees. Take the case of Walter Uncle [sheriflf] and the proceeds of the Co. Tipperary. He every year gives more in horses to the justiciary than the whole proceeds for which he is accountable to the King.\" (y) How the sheriff\" recouped himself we learn from a petition of the Tipperary freeholders to King Edward I. in 1290. Following the example of the neighbouring Irish chiefs the sheriffs in their half-yearly tourns regularly \"coshered\" on the people to their great damage. Moreover they now levied a half mark each tourn on every knight's fee instead of on the barony as formerly (z). They invented a new offence and so by the fines reaped considerable profit. This was to summon the freeholder to cut down the woods in the bad passes of the county, whoever defaulted was fined YiQ2iV\\\\y (aa). The Anglo-Norman yeomen caught between the upper and nether millstones of their lords on the one hand, and the Irish on the other gradually disappeared. The names which figure so largely in the Pipe rolls and Plea rolls of Tipperary in the thirteenth century are sought in vain in later records. Neither in the Fiants of Elizabeth, nor the census of our own day can one discover such patronymics as Arsyc, Burel, Codynor, Dunheved, I'Enfaut, fflamvill, Godmund, Haleton, Joye, Krik, Lovell, Mallbronch, Namenach, Osnel, Passelewe, Roleg, Stobboc, Trussenylan, Wyard, Yvor.

History of Clonmel. ii The Irish, as has been observed, still remained on their tribe lands. Except that some fertile districts here and there were occupied by the Norman lord, partly in demesne partly by his tenants, the old order continued. The chief was regularly elected; the land distribution under the ancient law took place periodically; the brehon sat in judgment; the shanaghee constructed the tribal pedigree ; the bard played the old music ; the traditional literature still flourished. There were in short two nations on the same soil, not side by side but intermixed, one claiming it de jure by the legal fiction of conquest, the other holding it de facto by every moral right. Such a state of things could last only as long as the balance of power was even, and the balance was disturbed in the early years of the fourteenth century by the advent of Edward Bruce. In 1318 after three years warfare and eighteen successive victories Bruce fell at Faughard, near Dundalk. But he brought down with him in his fall the feudal government of Ireland. The Anglo-Norman forces were shattered, their tenantry dispersed,- their castles even in ruins. The Irish now seized the opportunity and what Bruce had left, they destroyed. North Tipperary for example had been a successful colony under the Butlers. Along the line of the Shannon and among the head waters of the Suir many a castle had been planted in dependence on Nenagh as the \" caput baroniae.\" Lord Edmund Butler being justiciary in 1 3 16, Bruce invaded the district and making Nenagh his headquarters \" burnt and destroyed all Butler's lands \" (bb). Next year O'Carrol of Ely completed the ruin by defeating the remnant of Butler's forces, killing two hundred of them. Shortly after Bryan O'Brien laid claim to the whole district as part of the ancient kingdom of Thomond, and forthwith proceeded to make good his claim (cc). In 1322 he gained his first great victory over the English. The parliament at Kilkenny on the petition of the commonalty of Tipperary agreed to raise a subsidy, and the sheriffs of the county, Geoflfry Prendergast and John Landers, were ordered to organize an army to be commanded by John de Bermingham, the conqueror of Bruce (dd). But O'Brien maintained his ground and three years later, moving south, he destroyed the De Burgh baronies of Clanwilliam and reduced the towns of Tipperary and Athassel to ashes. The Normans, now thoroughly aroused, formed a confederacy under the Earl of Ulster, with O'Connor King of Connaught and Murtough O'Brien of Thomond as allies. O'Brien at first suffered a reverse at Thurles but soon inflicted an overwhelming defeat on (bb) Book of Howth ad an. fee) In a State Paper of Henry VII.

(dd) Pat. Rol. 20 Ed. II. 12 History of Clonmel. the allies, the King of Connaught being left dead on the field. The success of the Irish may be measured by the fact that two years later, in 1332, they cut into the heart of the Dc Bermingham country and burnt the town of Cahir (ec). The sequel is related in the Four Masters, under the date 1337, when an agreement was come to that O'Brien should hold the land and a certain rent was to be paid to De Burgh— a covenant probably which neither party took seriously. If, as has been observed, there are some indications in embryonic Clonmel of a Danish origin, yet the town as it emerges into history is unmistakably Anglo-Norman. The four streets radiating from the centre forming a cross, the parish church occupying the north-west quadrant, the dedications \"Our Lady of Clonmel,\" St. Nicholas, patron of sailors, St. Stephen with its leper house, all these are characteristic of the older English towns and of their Norman prototypes. The earliest documentary reference to the town occurs in 121 5. That year King John sent a mandate to the Archbishop of Dublin, justiciary, to distrain William d'Aencurt for £ioo purchase money of Clonmel. The purchase had been effected some years before but payment had not been made (ff). The explanation is probably furnished by an entry in the Close rolls, 2ist October, 1221, when the manor and ville of Clonmel were in litigation between D'Aencurt and Richard de Burgh. It would appear therefore that the grant to D'Aencurt had been made in ignorance that Clonmel was included in the lands previously granted to William fitz Adelm de Burgh, father of Richard. To Richard de Burgh, justiciar}', the most prominent man in Ireland of his generation, Clonmel as a municipal and commercial entity owes its existence. As early as 1225 he obtained from Henry III. a grant for a yearly fair in the town beginning on the feast of All Saints and lasting for the seven following days. In 1242 this fair was changed to the feast of St. Magdalen (2ist July) and made permanent. The charter of incorporation which he as lord of the manor granted to the burgesses is not now extant, but its tenor may be learned from similar ones by contemporary lords. Evidence however is not wanting as to the state of the town. On the death of De Burgh in 1243 an inquisition in accordance with feudal law was held into his property. From this it appears that a rent of £19 6s. was payable by the burgesses. Now as contemporary charters show a uniform burgage rent of twelve pence, the sheriff's return would represent 386 burgesses and a town population therefore of 2,000. Surprising though these figures appear they can be tested from other sources. In the charter of incorporation besides the fit'} .\\nna!s of Four Masters, Clyn, Koss. &c. (fi) Stale Papers, Swcctinan. History of Clonmel. i3 common of wood and moor on the south side of the river, there were granted in small allotments the burgagery lands north of the town. These extended to about 850 Irish acres, and taking the average allotment, the burgesses would approximate to the above figure (gg). Again, the mills of Clonmel as part of the dower of Egidia widow of De Burgh were valued at £8 1 3s. 4d. yearly. As only the corn of the manor tenants was ground, the profits show the existence of a large community. De Burgh's children being minors his estates passed into the hands of the King. Richard de Burgh, junior, dying in 1 250 was succeeded by his brother Walter, who does not seem to have had livery of Clonmel and Kilsheelan previous to his exchanging these manors for the land of Ulster. An entry in the Pipe roll for 1276 runs \"Richard fitz Ely accounts to the Exchequer for the rent of Clonmel and Kilsylan and for all the other proceeds of these manors, — which have been in the hands of the King from Christmas in the twenty-ninth year (Henry III., 1244), — up to the next Feast of St. Michael.\" A notable personage now appears on the scene. Otto de Grandison was sheriff of County Tipperary in 1 267 and the two following years. During this period casting his eyes on the rich lands occupied despite feudal law by the junior De Burgh families, De Grandison soon obtained a grant of them for life. Subsequently returning to England, he was attached to the King's council until 1289 when he went on an embassy to Rome. Ten years later he set out for the Crusade. He was present at the siege of Acre whence escaping in company with the King of Cyprus he was reported to have perished in a shipwreck. But in 1302 he arrived home safely, bringing with him a Roman order for payment of 3,000 marks, losses incurred at the siege of Acre. Previous to his foreign peregrinations he succeeded in converting his freehold in Clonmel into fee simple absolute. Edward, the King has granted to Otto de Grandisson for his homage and his service to the King during youth, and for his expenditure the castle, cantred, and entire territory of Hokmath ICoonagh barony, Co. Limerick], the entire ville of Tipperary and its appurtenances, the castle and ville of Kilfecle, the entire district of Muskerry and the ville of Clonmel, to hold to him and his heirs for ever, with knight services, advowsons of churches, &c., &c. Copeford, 26th July, 1281 (hh). The interest which he and his representatives took in the newly acquired possessions is evident from several entries in the State Papers. It is probable that during the minority of the De Burghs the manorial jurisdiction fell into abeyance, De Grandison determined to protect his (^) '•'•i^' hurf(:igc holdiiiiis in Imiistiogue were 3 acres, in Rathcoolc 4 acres, in Rathmorc some I, some 7 acres- Gale. (hh) V'A\\. Rolls, Calendar Hen. II. Hen. VH. p. i. 14 History of Clonmel. tenants as doubtless also to secure the perquisites of his court. In 1 299 John de la Rokele and Walter fitz Mathew Power by a writ Praecipe began proceedings against certain burgesses of Clonmel in the King's courts. As it was a grievance to the citizens to compel them to appear outside their bailiwick and a violation of their rights as freemen under Magna Charta, Otto petitioned the King and quashed the proceedings. Besides legal protection the citizens obtained a further instalment of freedom, the right to levy taxes. The King at the instance of Otto de Grandison in 1298 granted to \" the bailiffs and good men of Clonmel \" for the benefit of the town and the greater security of the adjacent parts, customs on all articles domestic or foreign brought for sale there, the grant to last for ten years (it). Before this had run out, the need for fortifying the town became increasingly evident: the water ditch and the wooden stockade afforded the citizens scant protection against the marauding baron and the omnipresent Irish (jj). In 1319 a \"murage\" grant, or grant to build stone walls was made to the provost and bailiffs, to be levied on all merchandise sold in the town for seven years. This seems to have been effective for no other is discoverable in the records for a generation. Meanwhile the De Grandisons finding the occupation of their Irish territory uncongenial and the defence of it anything but easy, became absentees. The withdrawal of the superior lord unbridled the turbulent sub-feudarii who by this time, through the logic of circumstances, were grown half Irish. The country was soon consumed by smouldering civil war. A drastic remedy had to be adopted. [1316]. Edward the King to John Wesda of Clonmel, greeting. Whereas all rents, profits, etc., of the holdings of foreigners and strangers who do not spend such in defence of the said lands whereby all their own lands and those of other faithful subjects are destroyed and wasted by malefactors and other disturbers of the peace and whereas Otho de Grandison is beyond the seas, etc., he John Wesda is authorized to receive such rents of the said Otho and transmit them to Dublin to our Treasury (kk). The De Grandisons returned and seem to have satisfactorily fulfilled their responsibilities. Under date 1 326 the Anglo-Irish chronicler records \"In the morning of the vigil of Michaelmas died at Clonmel the noble squire Theobald de Grandison\" (H). The town folk followed their vocations in peace, their only vexation being the trade jealousy of Carrick. A curious instance of this is set forth in some law pleadings of 1331. Henry Tykenham sued Richard Ocrethan (O'Crehan) and others. The plaintiff stated that the late (ii) Appendix. (ij) A memorial of this ditch long existed outside the north gate of the town ; the \" Barior \" is frequently mentioned in early 17th century patents of land there.

History of Clonmel. is King (Edward II.) by letters patent in aid of enclosing the town of Carrick with a stone wall, granted certain customs of things coming for sale to said town. Now the plaintiff his men and servants in boats with merchandizes passing through the middle of the water which leads from Clonmel to Waterford and from Waterford to Clonmel, just as if the merchandizes had passed through the middle of the town of Carrick to be sold there which they were not, were greviously destroyed and manifoldly aggrieved by the said Richard O'Crehan and others being the men of Carrick, to the great damage of said Henry and against the prohibition of the Lord the King, etc. (mm). But disturbed times came again and the De Grandisons, who to judge from the Papal Registers were intensely religious, preferred their quiet home in Hereford. In 1 338 their sixty years connexion with Clonmel came to an end. \"At the beginning of autumn Maurice fitz Thomas then Earl of Desmond bought Clonmel and Kilsheelan from William (recte Peter) de Grandison for one thousand one hundred marks (nn). Hitherto Kilmanahan Castle had been the northern outpost of the Desmond territory and the Suir the natural boundary. By the new purchase the Desmonds encroached upon the Ormond palatinate which had just been created, so that between them and their kinsman the White Knight, the districts of the De Keatings of Nicholastown, De Prendergasts of Newcastle, and De Berminghams of Cahir were almost isolated. To this disturbance of the scientific frontier much of the subsequent local history is traceable. The ruins of fifteenth and sixteenth century castles which stud the country still tell of the historic feud between the Butlers and the Desmonds, and in part explain it, Clonmel accordingly soon began to share the varying fortunes of its new lords. In 1345 Ralph de Ufford, justiciary, after a successful campaign against Desmond occupied his principal castles and confiscated the estates. The following year John Morris, seneschal, was granted the custody of Clonmel, etc. with power to remove constables, bailiffs, and minor officers and appoint others in their stead. The terrible plague known in history as the \"Black Death \" visited the town in 1349. This with other calamities, is touchingly related in a murage grant of 1355. Whereas it has been fully testified to the Council of the King in Ireland that the town of Clonmel is in divers ways reduced to pauperism by the plague which was lately in those parts as also by the numerous losses of different kinds which its merchants have met by sea and in foreign countries, the King considering their losses and poverty, (mm) Plea Rolls, 5 Ed. III., P.R.O. Grammar and sense slightly mixed in original as in translation. (nn) Clyn's Annals, p. 29. 16 History of Clonmel. for a fine of two marks paid by the burgesses and commonalty through John Stephens, junior, has conceded and granted to the said burgesses and commonalty for the relief of the said town murage and pontage of everything coming for sale there for eight years from date hereof. Provided that at the end of that term they render account before two liege men of the said town to be chosen for that purpose by the commonalty, as is fitting, and no other account to be rendered to the lord the king, if only the murage and pontage receipts are honestly expended on the repair of the walls and bridge of the said town. 12 day of January, 1355. Edward III. released the Earl from custody and having pronounced D'Uflford's proceedings illegal, restored the estates and finally in 1355 made Desmond viceroy. On the death of Desmond, his countess Eveleen had livery of Clonmel as part of her dowry, and the following year 1359 is remarkable as the first in which Clonmel returned members to Parliament. On i8th March a writ was directed to the provost and bailiffs of Clonmel to send \" two of their more discreet citizens \" to the parliament which was to meet at Waterford on the Monday next after the Feast of St. Ambrose. Though the Desmonds as lords of the manor held courts leet in the town, yet the Ormonds in right of their palatinate, took cognisance of the graver pleas excepting the four reserved to the King. But the provost of the town would be subject to the Desmonds as his jurisdiction was manorial, hence the Ormonds to counteract this, appointed a higher authority known as the Superior or Sovereign. The preamble therefore of the following writ is probably as truthful as such things usually are. Edward by the grace of God, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland to all whom these presents shall reach, greet im;. Whereas we considering how much the town of Clonmel within the liberty of our beloved and faithful cousin James le Bottiler, Earl of Ormond, stands in need of ampler and more powerful government than it has had hitherto, especially in these days when the citizens as loyal men are seriously and openly threatened by malefactors and robbers, as is reported. We, therefore wishing to make liberal provision for the safety and defence of the said town by our special grace and at the request of our said cousin grant and give license for us and our heirs to the extent of our power, to the provost and commonalty of the said town that they in future whenever it shall please them, shall elect out of their fellow burgesses every year, a Superior who when elected shall make oath before the provost and commonalty to do each and everything necessary and opportune for the safe and secure government of the said town and the peace and tranquillity of our loyal men therein, just as the superiors of the towns of Kilkenny, Ross, Wexford and Youghal reasonably do. We grant also to the provost and commonalty for the time being by these presents in writing that they be intendant and respondent to the Superior for the time being in all things relating to his office as often as and just as is enjoined him on our part, the right of the royal liberty granted to our cousin and his heirs, being saved in every wise. In testimony of which, etc. William de Wyndsor, lord lieutenant, Kilkenny, 20 January, 1371- A few years later the citizens obtained a grant of a more valuable character, namely, freedom from pre-emption and purveyance. The royal privilege of commandeering food and conveyance at a price fixed by the History of Clonmel. it purveyor himself, had it appears, been usurped by the feudal lords generally. This scarcely disguised form of robbery was ended in the case of Clonmel by a mandatum dated 12 July, 1376. Edward by the grace of God, etc. Whereas in a Statute of Westminster lately promulgated, it is enacted inter alia that no corn, victuals or other goods belonging to any prelate, religious person, cleric or layman, be taken under colour of \" emption \" against the will of the owner or keeper, within any trading town, and that no horses, bullocks, cars, ships or boats be taken for conveyance against the will of the owner, and if taken with his consent he must be satisfied according to agreement, and whosoever offends in the premises and is convicted shall be imprisoned during our pleasure and that of our Court according to the amount of the offence. And Whereas on the part of our beloved the Superior and commonalty of Clonmel within our said land, it is shown that certain evil doers calling themselves purveyors and servants of great folk (magnatum) and others, have up to now taken corn and other victuals from several burgesses against their will and did not satisfy them according to the statute, the superior and commonalty have humbly petitioned us for redress, we therefore wishing to keep the statute inviolate, command under the penalties expressed therein that the superior and burgesses or any of them be not molested contrary to its tenor. The Ormonds as lords palatine, in 1385 gave the citizens a further extension of liberty. James le Botiller granted to the sovereign provost and commonalty that their taxes should be rateably assessed by themselves, that they should not be compelled to serve on juries, etc., out of the borough, and that they should have the \" office of the market,\" that is the market tolls and the court of Pie Poudre which adjudicated on all disputes arising therein. These several grants mark the growth of popular freedom from the stage when the burghers were mere serfs under the feudal lord down to the period when some of the \" more discreet \" of their number sat in parliament as the equals of the barons themselves. But it must be remembered throughout, that these franchises were only for burghers of Norman or English blood. The Celtic Irish as belonging to a different nation had no legal status ; the law took no cognizance of them and afforded no protection either to their lives or their property. Those of them who attached themselves to the English as dependents or servants could not be domiciled within the walls but dwelt in a suburb outside which to this day preserves the name of \"the Irish town.\" And should any Irish even be murdered the only question that could arise would be one of compensation to their master — just as for the loss of so many horses or cattle. For instance in the Pipe roll of 1276 the sheriff returns \"David Toerny of Clonmele, Ixxviii. s., on account of the wrongful death of an Irishman belonging to the Lord Edward,\" to be paid to the said lord. Sometimes, but at rare intervals, an Irish family obtained letters of naturalization by which they were enabled to inhabit and trade. Such a family were the Moroneys who for three hundred years played a prominent part in the town and only disappeared in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. C 18 History of Clonmel. The King grants to O'Molrony O'Griffy chief of his race, to Molrony his son, to Neill and Desmond brothers of the said 0*Molrony, that they and all their descendants be of free state and free from all Irish slavery, that they use English law and freely acquire lands, goods and cattle, because they have become faithful subjects and reformed themselves and their people to the King's peace and loyalty. Clonmel, 6 December, 1375 (00), Again, The King grants to Terence son of Charles O'Connor who is of Irish nationality, that he and his descendants be of free state. Clonmel, 17 June, 1408 (pp). The charter of Henry V. to Clonmel sets forth the exclusively English character of the inhabitants as the reason for granting them a Hundred Court and exempting them from the jurisdiction of the seneschal of the liberty. Clonmel is inhabited by English merchants and burgesses who have lately constructed great walls, towers and fortifications around the said town, and who observing English law are a great succour to the government and to those who resort to that place, but whereas they, the said inhabitants, are greatly oppressed by assess- ments as well of the Irish as of the English of the County Tipperary around the said town, etc An entry on the Patent roll of 1408, illustrates still more vividly the relations of the burghers to the native Irish. The King grants to John Folyot, a merchant of Clonmel, that he and his servants for the next three years carry on trading intercourse with the Irish enemy of Ormond and Ely in Munster, as well in time of war as in time of peace (qq). It is not therefore a matter ^f surprise if occasionally the Irish enemy dealt with these merchants in a prompt, business like way of their own. The King commands all sheriffs, etc, to arrest Walter Ormon, Richard Rery, Griffin mac Walter mac Edmund, Henry McEon, outlaws in county Waterford at the prosecution of Arnold de Hanse for the death of Martin de Hanse, merchant. Clonmel, 8 March, 1303. From all this it may be gathered that life in medieval Clonmel was neither empty nor colourless. The burghers* ordinary portion was that of the apostle — perils from the deep and perils from robbers. Outside the walls they and all they had were at the mercy of every enemy whom they were not strong enough to resist or fortunate enough to escape. Within, they had to take turn in watch and ward at the gates and walls, and on holidays instead of rest every man between sixty and sixteen practiced (00) Pat. Rot. 79, Ed. III. 121-2. (pp) Pat.

The return too of the merchant was a notable event for he told of episodes of chivalry, of the people he had met, of the churches he had seen and the pilgrimages he had made. The friar brought from the chapter of his order not only the news of ecclesiastical appointments and changes of discipline bat a full budget of gossip got from his fellow capitulars. An old inhabitant at the end of the fourteenth century could relate many a stirring scene in the town itself. He would tell how in 1331 the lord of Cahir, William De Bermingham was pounced on in Clonmel by the judiciary De Lucy, and the year after someone recognized the ghastly head of the unfortunate nobleman spiked over the gate of Dublin Castle. He would tell also how in 1338 William De Wall, sheriff of Tipperary, with thirteen of his kinsmen were murdered just outside the walls of the town by the Powers with whom they were holding parley. And in 1346 that Ralph Kelly Archbishop of Cashel, Maurice Rochfort Bishop of Limerick, Richard Walsh Bishop of Emly, and John Lynch Bishop of Lismore, one day in the middle of the High Street vested in full pontificals solemnly excommunicated all who, contrary to the liberties of the Church, paid the subsidy to the Crown. Our inhabitant in extreme old age would have seen the Anglo-Irish parliament assemble in the ancient church of Our Lady on the Monday after the feast of St. Peter 1381. Alexander Bishop of Ossory, and Sir Thomas de Mortimer were there with the King's commission, and there also were the ecclesiastical peers the bishops of the Pale, the abbots of Mellifont and Dunbrody, the priors of Athassel and Kells, and many another. The lay barons too mustered, Butlers and Fitzgeralds, Freynes and Cusacks, Poers and Barrys. The cities of the Pale sent their representatives in aldermanic array, rivalling Solomon in his glory. Indeed the barbaric splendour of this feudal parliament afforded such a spectacle as Clonmel has never since beheld ^^5/ Life therefore was full of incident; the character of the burghers strenuous and healthy, and if chronic warfare quenched the more humane instincts, it brought the ennobling compensations, personal loyalty, mutual trust and the equality of comradeship. But there were great drawbacks. Sanitation and hygiene were absolutely unknown. Not perhaps a dozen houses were built of stone, the rest were frame work and shingle. Open sewers drained the streets, and when the universal mud and offal became impassable, an additional layer of (rr) 5 Ed.

Food also was of the coarsest kind, only in summer was it to be obtained fresh. After Michaelmas all cattle and swine that could not be foddered through the winter were slaughtered and barrelled and there were no winter vegetables^/// The consequences are obvious. Fever was endemic and when such visitations of Providence as the plagues of 1349 and 1376 came, priest and congregation were swept away together (uu). Few realize the history that lies behind the Irish name of St. Nicholas' CeAmpuU ha puige \"The Church of the Plague.\" The general use also of salted food produced aggravated scorbutic affections and it is probable that most of the ' leprosy ' of the middle ages was a virulent form of scurvy. The hospital for the lepers adjoined the chapel of St. Stephen, well removed from the town ; its last memorial is the local name \" 'Spittle lands.\" (w) Such was Clonmel for the first three centuries of its existence. Aggressively hostile to the Celtic population, neither influencing nor being influenced by them, a \"garrison town \" in the most literal sense, it kept its English identity unimpaired amid the active solvents of language and marriage which destroyed the feudal system everywhere about it. (tt) The Annalists, v.g., Penbridge and the Book of Howth carefully record the price of salt for different years. (uh) Friar Clynn, of Carrick-on-Suir, writes in 1349 \"Scarcely one alone ever died in a house. Commonly husband, wife, children and servants went the same way of death, and the penitent and the confessor were carried together to the grave.\" (i*v) The 'Spittle lands are still the property of the Corporation. Ohapxe^r III. CLONMEL IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. CHE Anglo-Nomian supremacy of Tipperary which had been complete in the thirteenth century was disputed in the fourteenth. In the fifteenth century it gave way absolutely to the Celtic. The Irish language was used universally, even Geraldines and Butlers were proud of their skill in the vernacular literature fwwj. The Brehon code regulated all disputes ; the lord became a chief, tanistry was substituted for primogeniture, and instead of feudal homage there was the equality of clan- ship. The Anglo-Irish then indeed and long after, considered themselves English, but it was only after the fashion of the modern Australians. They appealed to the executive when they were oppressed ; they made a parade of their English lineage, and their former services against the King's Irish enemy, but the t^uth was that in essentials they were themselves become \"as Irish as O'Hanlon's breeches \" (xxj. Amongst the Irish Kern brought to the siege of Boulogne in 1544 by lords Ormond and Cahir were Purcells, Fannings, Fitzwilliams, Cantwells, Archers, Keatings, Dobbyns, Whites, Rothes, Walls, and a host of others.

The unhappy freeholders and tenants in consequence were crushed beneath a load of oppressions, feudal and Irish. They gave aids, reliefs and the rest to lord Cahir or lord Dunboyne as their liege lord, and then he came in his role of Irish chief with his dependents \" coshering \" on them and ate up everything they had left. In 1542 a body of them petitioned King Henry VIII. and told a story piteous in its quaint details. The petitioners were Thomas Prendergast of Newcastle, James Keating of Moortown, James Walsh, Rathronan, James Oge Wall of Finglas, Richard son of William Butler of Kilcash, Geoff ry Mocklerof Mocklerstown, St. John of St. Johnstown, William Power, Rathcoole, John Comyn of Kilconnell, Richard fitz Theobald of Ballylynch, Richard son of William and grandson of John Butler of Cabbragh, James Oge Butler of Lismalin, Geofifry Fanning, Ballingarry, James LafTan Graystown, Pierce fitz Richard Butler of Moy- kelly and John O'Neill of Maynestown. They and their ancestors, they said, provided a retinue by which the Earls of Ormond as lords of the liberty of Tipperary right well governed and defended the said county. On the departure of the White Earl to England in 1430 he divided the county into certain districts among his kinsfolk assigning to each of them a proportion of the agreed retinue. These kinsfolk \"entered into such a wrongfull inordynate pride and malicious division between them selfs that they fell suddenly out of their good obedience to be murderers and mansleers of either other.\" Though the Earl on his return restored the county to its \" prestynate estate,\" his sons as Earls of Wiltshire resided wholly in England. During this period again the Ormond kinsfolk partly by joining in the Irish wars, partly by internecine strife \" brought the countrie not oonely into disobedience but also in effect, into utter desolation and waste saving a few castells and so contynued till about 1524.\" The late Earl of Ormond \" to the great daunger of his person at sundry tymes began to styrr soo with Syr Edmunde Butler [of Cahir] and Syr James Butler [of Kiltinane] being then men of good power and strongely allied with the Brenes [O'Briens] as with the Desmonds that he readoptid vnto him agayn moche of the power of the same retynue that were so commytted by his auncestors vnto the auncestors of the said Syr Edmonde and Syr James.\" The Kiltinane Butlers were soon brought into subjection (yy) Tliorold Rogers ckiiiuiistratcd, iur tlic lirsl time I think, the pai't phiyed in English history by *' the younger sons.\" Along this line probably we shall find the explanation how, e.g., the Burkes of Clanwilliam only three generations removed from FitzAdelm and claiming kinship with Edward III., ranked themselves as Irish chiefs. History of Clonmel. 23 but not so with the lords of Cahir. Edmund Butler cousin german of the eleventh and twelfth earls of Desmond and married to a daughter of lord Power, despised the orders of the lords deputy though sworn for performance thereof. His son Sir Thomas Butler \" slakith not to sesse [cess] and exacte many kinds of inordynate exactions and taxes daily.\" First the said Sir Thomas takith of every freholder coddies [night suppers] at Xrimas and Ester or certan sommes of money in liewe thereof at his pleasyr.

Such was Tipperary during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, a theatre of anarchy and disorder that — to use the words of a contemporary — would have wrecked the kingdom of Beelzebub himself. How far the burghers of Clonmel were able to maintain their civic independence and trade, we are fortunately able to judge from a State Paper preserved in the London Record Office. In 1537 a Royal Commission was issued to inquire into the state of Ireland. The Commissioners, Antony St Leger, George Poulet, T. Mayne, and William Berners opened an \" inquest \" in Clonmel, the October of that year, when the following report was made.

The citizens therefore of those days said little about the patronage of the nobility and gentry, but on the other hand made grave charges of interference with their trade.

Itm they fynde that Sir Thomas Butler Knight, Nycholas Keteing of Nycholas Town, Jamys Keteing of the Mortown, Jamys Englyshe of Whytechurche, the Pryor of the Kagher [Cahir] the Pryor of our Lady Abbey [Ardfinnan] John Mawclerkeof Dounes Towne, Thomas Prendergaste of the New Castell, Robert McShane Prendergaste, Robert Keteyng of Ardfinan and all others within this shire in the cantrede of Clonmell that have any towne or villadge under his govemaunce with one assent and assembleing, before Sir Thomas Butler as govemer of them hath affyrmed and establyshed and enacteid that none under their govemaunce nor jurysdycon shalle sell or bring any woUe fleshe or other merchandyse oute or fro any towne or vyllege to market towne of the Kings wythoute speciall lycence. And so this acte made by commandyment and penaltye to be leved of the seller wythoute grace. But besides this boycotting of the markets of the town, there was also the grievance of forestalling. Certain persons styled \" gray merchants \" went through the country buying \"hides, felles [skins] checkers, fleges, yarne, linnen cloth, woole and flockes \" secretly and not in open market, with the evil intent to sell them again (b), Itm they fynde that Jamys White merchaunte useith and hathe graye merchaunts regrateing the market, Thomas White and John Merthye useyth the same.

Among the robbers in high station not the least conspicuous was Edmund Butler, Archbishop of Cashel. An illegitimate son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond, he was educated at Oxford, and subsequently through family influence probably, was appointed prior of Athassel. From this was but a short step to the archbishopric of Cashel. But the mitre no more made the archbishop than the habit makes the monk, and Butler only difi'ered from the rest of the family in his deeper shade of rapacity. Living with his notorious sister, the lady Catherine Power in Kilmeaden Castle, he levied blackmail on the traders of the Suir. The Clonmel jurors presented him and \"his folowers\" for committing riot. In Waterford We finde that tharchebysshop of Casshell with a companye and specially Phylip Hennebre toke a bootye of Clonmell men and goods wythin this ryver.

That first coyne and livery be put bake and the Inglish lords and trewe subjects of Ireland be brought at one peace and that none may be at no severall peases with eny of the Irishe naycons but with such Irishe nacions as is trewe and faithfull to the Kynge and to his subjects and that then all Irishe naycons under the Kyngs lawes be obedyent to the Statutes and lawes proclaymed, affyrmed by the Kings deputie and his counsell and that the bigge Irishe sheets be dampned [be condemned] and put bake and brought to lesse making and facyon (d). And when tyme is and may be by leasure after your discrecyons that all Inglish nacyons of Inglishe and Irishe be brought to one apparell as nigh to the Inglishe maner and facyon as may be, and that every man be so charged to socor ne favor no thieves nor Irishe rebelles, and that every lord within his dominacon be charged to have weapon after the best manner according as he maye occupie best, and every man after his degree answere the crye [hue and cry] and defende his neighbour the Kings subjects and that every gentylman answere for his servant in the countrey that useth Irishe manners. God save our soveraign lorde Kynge Henry the eight. The advice of the burghers and the recommendations of the royal commissioners, notwithstanding, the \"enormities\" continued, and two generations later the state of Tipperary was worse than ever. On llth October, 1563, Pierce Lord Cahir wrote that the brothers of lord Ormond invaded his district and plundered his tenants of cattle, household goods and clothing to the value of a thousand pounds sterling. In January, 1566, Theobald Hackett of Meldrum, with divers others malefactors, burnt thirty houses in Sheepstown, one hundred pounds worth of household goods, \" besydes the burninge of a womane and a mane child.\" The same year, (di \" Linnen shirts the rich doe weare for wantones and bravery with wide hanging sleeves playted, thirtie yards are little enough for one of them. They have now left their saffron and learne to wash their shirts fourc or five times in a veare.\" Campion. Historie, 1571, Dublin Edition, 1810, p. 24. 30 History of Clonmel. Philip Comyn fitz George burnt eight ricks of corn belonging to Edmond Coniyn, of Kilconnell. Connor Fox of Monroe, burnt nine houses, one hundred sheep and swine, and twenty pounds value of house stuff belonging to Teige OTogarty of Duagh. In 1568 Edmond, son of the White Knight, with others \"vilonusly burned and spoyled the barrony of Cahir to the number of sixteen townlands.\" Coyne and livery was universal. Sir Edmond Butler's and the lord of Ormond's men cessed the country with cuddies, horsemen, galloglass, '* goners and doggs.\" So did the sheriff of the liberty, and the Clonmel jury of 1 576 reported the same of the president of Munster himself. At intervals war broke out between the Geraldines and the Butlers, and then indeed the combatants in the elegant phraseology of Cox \" played the devils'* in the district. In 1516 the Earl of Kildare, lord deputy, having defeated the O'Carrolls marched on Clonmel, then controlled by Sir James Butler, natural son to the Earl of Ormond. He \" attempted the town with so much celerity that the townsmen (being surprized) immediately surrendered upon conditions. The deputy returned loaden with hostages, prey and glory.\" (e). An end seemed to be put to the feud by the marriage of Joan, daughter of the eleventh Earl of Desmond, with James, heir to the earldom of Ormond, the manors of Clonmel, Kilsheelan and Kilfeacle being settled on Butler as her dowry. But as Ormond refused to acknowledge James Fitz John as next Earl of Desmond, the latter felt justified in repudiating the marriage settlement made by his kinsman the eleventh earl. In his attempt to recover these manors he was supported by the lord deputy Bellingham, whose policy was to keep the Irish divided. Ormond complained bitterly of Bellingham's action. \"I am credably informed,\" he wrote, \"the Lord Deputie hath counsailid James of Desmond to make werr upon mee for suche landes as my sonn James hath in his wife's right and have procurid Sir Thomas Butler [of Cahir] to be of the same mynde and to take his parte \" (f). On the death of James, Earl of Ormond, his countess Joan married Gerald, Earl of Desmond, so that the rivals then stood towards one another in the relation of step-son and step-father. Yet peace was as far off as ever. For when the ownership of the manors was settled, the controversy about the regalities sprang up. In 1558 the question at issue was \"the boundyng of the countie of Tipperary, how farre the liberties doo extend and whether the manors of Clomell, Kilfeakill and Kilsheelan being within the said countie ought to answer to the said lybertie. The erle of Ormonde clayming by his patente of graunte (c) Cox. Hibernia Anglicana, p. 206. (f) Ormond to Cowley, Jnly 20, 1538, Journal A.S., 1873, p. 511. History of Clonmel. 31 that the same extende in all places within the same countie withoute anye exception, and the erle of Desmonde supposing that the boundes of the said countie extende not so fair as the said earle of Ormonde pretendith to have lybertie and the said manors ought not to answer the sayde liberty.\" (g). Though the earls were bound to the peace in the sum of £2,000 each, yet two years later they were as busy as ever in murderous cattle lifting. By orders made by the lieutenant and council at Waterford, 1st August, 1 560, John Butler, Piers Butler and Edmund Commins, of Tolomane, were delivered as hostages for the good conduct of Ormon"
