        "text": "In January, Roscrea town made unwanted international headlines when some locals clashed with gardaí, after the local Racket Hall hotel closed to house asylum seekers.\n\nImages of ugly scenes emerged as international protection applicants, including small children, were being bused into the grounds of the hotel, with some locals arguing that the closure would be a major blow to the tourism industry.\n\nFianna Fáil TD Jackie Cahill was one of the speakers at the lunchtime vigil on Saturday. As he addressed the crowd, one man began shouting at him while streaming live on his phone.\n\nThe people attending the vigil immediately circled the man with placards and shouted, “refugees welcome, refugees welcome” and the man eventually left.\n\nThe protestors cheered as he crossed the road where he was joined by six others who shouted over at the people holding the vigil before they moved on.\n\nFollowing the disruption, Mr Cahill said: “I think if you want an endorsement about why we have events like this, we’re just after getting it. We are an open country we are completely against racism. We offer people an opportunity in this country, we will continue to do that.\n\n“Yes, there is an issue in terms of resources that needs to be addressed and is being addressed but I will make no apologies to anyone for saying this is a country that welcomes people, the vast majority of the population in this country have that view.\n\n“We have a minority that are trying to force their opinions down our throats, lets never let that happen. Let’s endorse the people coming in here — welcome them, incorporate them into our workforce, let them build up futures like Irish people did all over the world for the last number centuries, and they will enrich our culture and country.\"\n\nDuring the protest people held up signs saying “refugees welcome” and “Tipperary against racism”.\n\nPat McCabe from Tipperary Anti-Racist Network said: \"Some people want to divide our community using fear about where these new faces are from, or their colour. Why? Because they’ve got nothing else to offer.\n\n“Whether born here, or seeking safety, we all want a safe and decent life. That’s why we need to stop being divided and distracted, roll up our sleeves and fight together for the resources Roscrea needs”.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Examiner, he said the vigil was “a great success” and that it was “wonderful to see so many people from all backgrounds here”.\n\nTwo asylum seekers who are living in the former mother and baby home, Sean Ross Abbey, outside the town — which now houses 120 international protection applicants — said they are now after securing employment.\n\nOne of the men, who did not want to be identified, said: “We want to be part of the community and we like Roscrea so we hope that some people will eventually be okay with us”.\n\nChristine Murphy, house manager for Sean Ross Abbey which is also known as Corville House, read a poem about asylum seekers at the vigil, called “Why Ireland?”.\n\nIt included the words: “When my brothers and sisters were washed up ashore, Ireland wept, their hearts bruised and sore. When my brothers and sisters were suffocated in a lorry with no air, Ireland wept, the whole country filled with despair”.\n\nMs Murphy recently revealed that 85% of the residents housed in Corville house are employed in the local area and surrounding countries.\n\nShe said: “We wanted to show that not everyone is of the same opinion as the protestors who have been very vocal over the last couple of weeks. We are very happy with the turnout and from the towns around Roscrea”.\n\nFormer asylum seeker, Hasret Dayan from Turkey, said: “I am a refugee, and I live in Cloughjordan for the last seven years. I have my own private place now and I am out of the main system, and I am waiting for my citizenship. I am almost there.\n\n\"I am a professional chef. I came here in 2016 and there were no protests then. I feel sorry and a little bit angry, when I arrived my community was so helpful. I felt really at home, and I have really nice friends.\n\n“Recently a lot of things are happening, and it has really shocked me, the protests they really upset me. This never happened when I came here, things are changing. But we are here today to say, guys we can live together all of us, this behaviour of the protests is new to me, and I hate racism.”\n\nCloughjordan native Ruari McBride said that when he saw what was happening in Racket Hall, he wanted to come here and stand in solidarity with the anti-racism groups.\n\n“Irish people moved all around the world over the years and other people have the right to do that too.”\n\nA minute’s silence was then held among the crowd for the people who have fled wars and persecution to seek refuge in Ireland.\n\nRoscrea currently has three centres housing international protection applicants including Racket Hall hotel, Mercy Convent and Sean Ross Abbey.\n\nLocals are still protesting at Racket Hall over what they say is a lack of resources in the town, where there is a population of around 6,000."
