        "text": "The Clonmel A C New Year 4k Road Race series got off to a brilliant start tonight with 102 mathletes taking part. Conditions for the race were ideal, no breeze and dry, contrary to what went ahead during the day. The Club would like to thank the Brothers of Charity for the use of their carpark for our Race Headquarters, to the Red Cross for providing First Aid and to our many stewards who ensured that the event was well organised.\n\nThe format for tonight’s race was Lucky Dip, where pre selected finishing positions were drawn before the race and whoever finished in those positions were the lucky winners. The winners tonight were: Elaine Morrissey 15th in 17 mins 21 secs, Laura McCarthy Armstrong 30th in 18:25, Trish Cooney 41st in 19:37, Maureen Murray 60th in 21:51, Nicola Ryan 74th in 23:35 and Michael Murphy 90th in 27:24. Tonight’s race was won by Michael j Ryan in 14 mins 58 secs, 2nd was Eamonn Morrissey 15 mins 6 secs and 3rd Ian Purcell in 15 mins 44 secs. The top 3 women finishers were Elaine Horgan 13th in 17 mins 4 secs, Elaine Morrissey 15th in 17 mins 21 secs and Anne Marie Boland 18th in 17 mins 34 secs.We would like to remind people that we have two rules for this series, You Must wear a High Viz and No High Viz and Head Phones are not allowed, these rules are for your own safety and no exceptions"
