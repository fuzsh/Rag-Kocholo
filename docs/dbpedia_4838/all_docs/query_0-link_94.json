        "text": "Adrian Kavanagh, First posted 7th November 2023 – with updates as new candidate nominations announced, or as soon as I become aware of these. Any links in this post are to online announcements of candidate selections – there will be no specific links to candidate web pages.\n\nThe seventh of my series of rolling blog posts, looking to the 2024 County and City Council elections, in which I detail the latest information as to candidate selections relating to the different political parties and groupings and/or candidate declarations (as in the case of the non-party grouping). The rule of thumb here is that I will add party candidates in most cases only after they have been officially selected to run for the party at a selection convention or by some other means of candidate selection. I try my best to find information about local election candidate selection conventions, but in some cases this information is hard to find and occasionally it can be some time after a convention takes place before I find this information and hence am in a position to update this page accordingly.\n\nThe post will focus on the candidate selections for Solidarity and People Before Profit.\n\nIn the 2014 Local Elections there were fourteen People Before Profit Alliance candidates elected and fourteen Solidarity candidates (although they contested the 2014 elections as the Anti Austerity Alliance) elected. The two parties did not fare as well in the 2019 elections however, with People Before Profit winning seven seats and Solidarity winning four.\n\nAs of now (20th May 2024), there are forty five People Before Profit candidates listed on this page: eighteen of these candidates are women (40.0%) and twenty seven are men (60.0%), while six of these candidates (13.3%) are incumbents. There are eight Solidarity candidates listed on this page: four of these candidates are women (50.0%) and four are men (50.0%), while four of these candidates (50.0%) are incumbents. These numbers only reflect the details I have managed to find, as of now, and the likelihood is that both parties/groupings have more officially selected candidates in the field, as of now. As and when I become aware of these details, as well as any other subsequent selections, I will add these to this page.\n\nThe candidates that have been officially selected to contest the 2019 Local Elections as People Before Profit candidates include:\n\n(Please note that any links that are provided here are to posts/newspaper reports offering “evidence” of their candidatures and will normally not link back to candidate websites. I will generally not put in links to candidates’ own webpages here, on the basis of consistency and to manage my own time – if I do this for one candidate, I’ll have to do it for every candidate and we’re probably looking at thousands of candidates across all parties/groupings.)\n\nI will be adding to this list as and when I come across further People Before Profit and Solidarity candidate selections."
