        "text": "Cases\n\nO ‘Gorman v Ritz (Clonmel) Ltd\n\n[1947] Ir Jur Rep 35 (HC)\n\nGeoghegan J: I have to deal with this action on the basis that the defendants warranted their premises to be reasonably safe for patrons who paid to see the picture. The defendants are not insurers and it seems to me that the plaintiff seeks a degree of diligence, foresight, and precaution to which an ordinary theatre-goer is not entitled. I am satisfied on the particular facts, that to guard against a remote contingency such as that which led to the injuries here would need precautions of a well-nigh fantastic nature, which could notreasonably be expected in the construction or management of a theatre. The defendants could not foresee that Mrs O’Gorman would get her feet into the position that led to the\n\ninjuries from which she suffered. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\n\nWalsh v. Dublin Corporation\n\n[1998] IEHC 221\n\nSMITH J:\n\n1. The Plaintiff alleges in the Statement of Claim delivered herein that on or about the 4 April 1993 she was present in the premises of the Defendants known as Flat No 41, Basin Street Upper, Dublin 8, when, owing to the negligence and breach of duty and nuisance of the Defendants, their servants or agents, in and about, inter alia, the design and construction of the said premises and in particular the system of doors on the ground floor thereof, the Plaintiff suffered and sustained and continues to suffer and sustain severe personal injuries, loss, damage, inconvenience and expense, the door of the hallway leading back into the back room of the said premises, suddenly and without warning, closed forcefully onto the person of the Plaintiff by reason of the tunnel effect which was created due to the defective design of the said premises and in particular the doors on the ground floor thereof.\n\nThe Defendants, in their Defence delivered herein, deny all the allegations made against them and plead contributory negligence on the part of the Plaintiff.\n\nThe evidence in this case establishes that on the 4 March, 1993, the Plaintiff Miss Walsh, went with her boyfriend to her boyfriend’s brother’s apartment at No 41 Basin Street Upper, Dublin 8. She had been a visitor to these particular premises on approximately four to five occasions before the 4 April, 1993. This apartment, like the others in the complex, is a small compact apartment on the fourth floor of these premises, which were constructed approximately thirty years ago. On the bottom floor there is an open balcony at the front and the front door. As one enters the front door there is a small hallway, approximately eight feet long by seven feet wide, which contains a staircase to the upper floor. To the left of the hall there is a small kitchen, measuring approximately eight feet by five feet.\n\nAt the end of the hallway there is a door, which enters into the living room, and the living room is approximately twelve feet by twelve feet. At the end of the living room, near the wall on the right-hand side, there is a back door going out to another balcony. If all the doors are open at the same time a draught is created, and the middle door, if open, is prone to bang and close without warning. This is a situation that arises in most homes throughout the country and one with which we are all familiar. On the occasion in question the Plaintiff was a guest in the Corporation apartment, the tenant of which was her boyfriend’s brother. An unfortunate set of circumstances arose. The Plaintiff was standing close to the middle door, intending to go towards the front door. She had her right hand on the right frame of the door, with the open door to her left shoulder. At the very moment when she was about to go through the door, her boyfriend and her boyfriend’s brother opened the front and back doors, respectively. According to the Plaintiff there was an unmerciful bang, and the door on her left shot past her face striking her on the face and then caught her right thumb as the door closed. As a result, the top of her right thumb was crushed and she has now lost the terminal 2 cm of her right thumb.\n\nThe problem of the inner door slamming occurs whenever the front and back doors are open at the same time. A child belonging to a Mrs Anne Dunphy from Flat 38 Basin Street, injured her fingers in 1992 in a similar accident. She mentioned the matter to the caretaker, but she did not follow this up with a formal complaint to the Corporation. In the last two years or so, these middle doors have been removed and replaced with a fire proof door which has a controlling arm which ensures that the doors are closed at all times.\n\nThe allegation made against the Corporation, as landlord of the apartment, is that the design or layout of the apartment was faulty in that it created a wind tunnel effect when all three doors were open at the same time and also that a restraining mechanism should have been attached to the door so that it would have closed gradually at all times. Mr David Semple, Consulting Engineer who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff, stated that the problem of the banging door could have been obviated by:-\n\n1. The insertion of a sliding door;\n\n2. opening a door into the kitchen from the hallway, and;\n\n3. fitting a closing device on the door.\n\nMr Paul Romeril, Consulting Engineer, who gave evidence on behalf of the Corporation, rejected the suggestions of Mr Semple. He stated that a sliding door was unsatisfactory and would not comply with the fire regulations. He stated that the opening of a door from the hallway into the kitchen and then into the living room was unacceptable, and that the fitting of a closing device on the door was only ever done as a fire precaution and was never done to prevent a door closing because of a draught.\n\nThe law is that the Corporation as landlord of the apartment must take all reasonable care for the safety of the tenant and all persons invited onto the premises. It must warrant that the premises are reasonably safe for users but it is certainly not an insurer of the premises.\n\nThis case is not unlike the case of O’Gorman v Ritz (Clonmel) Limited [1947] Ir Jur Rep 35 where the Plaintiff, a cinemagoer, was injured when the patron immediately in front of her tipped up her seat and caught the Plaintiff’s outstretched legs. In that case on Appeal to the High Court, the Plaintiff’s claim failed. Geoghegan J, delivering judgement, stated that the Defendant warranted their premises to be reasonably safe for patrons. He stated that the Plaintiff sought a degree of diligence, foresight and precaution to which the ordinary theatregoer is not entitled. The Judge was satisfied that to guard against a remote contingency, such as that which led to the injuries there, would need precautions of a well-nigh fantastic nature which could not reasonably be expected in the construction or management of a theatre.\n\nI am satisfied on the evidence that the Plaintiff has not proved that the Corporation failed in its duty to her to take reasonable care for her safety. I am satisfied that the layout of the small apartment is satisfactory. It is a small and compact apartment and space is at a premium. I am also satisfied that the Corporation was not negligent in failing to have a restraining arm fitted to the middle door to prevent it from banging.\n\nThe accident was unfortunate, and was one that could befall any of us at any time whether in our own homes or elsewhere.\n\nThe Plaintiff’s claim must in those circumstances be dismissed with costs.\n\nWhooley v. Dublin Corporation\n\n[1961] IR 60\n\nMcLoughlin J.\n\nThe plaintiff claims damages from the defendant Corporation for injuries received by her by reason of the alleged negligence of the servants of the Corporation in the maintenance of a fire hydrant box in the public footway at Oxford Road, Ranelagh. On the night of the 11th November, 1958, the plaintiff was walking along the footway when her foot went into the uncovered box of a fire hydrant causing her to fall to the ground whereby she was injured. The fire hydrant box is normally covered by a flush-fitting cast iron lid measuring superficially 11 inches by 14 inches by 1/4-inch in depth and weighing about 3 lbs. On this night the lid had been removed and was lying some distance away and the box was full of water; the latter circumstance may have been due to the fact that it was a wet night, which I think was unlikely, or to escape of water from the hydrant caused by a defect in the valve or to unwarranted interference with the valve by some person, which last cause I consider most likely.\n\nIt is not contended that the Corporation are not under a duty to maintain these hydrants on the footway and that they must be readily accessible for use by the Corporation fire brigade in case of fire, but reliance is placed by the plaintiff on the evidence of an engineer called on her behalf who stated that the type of hydrant and box in this case was thirty to forty years old, that the lid could be removed by a child inserting a stick or some instrument into a slot provided along one side of the lid for that purpose, and that a more modern type has a heavier, though smaller, lid without a slot but with a hole in the centre for the insertion of a simple type of key. He did not, however, suggest that this more modern type of lid was designed to make, or would make, interference by mischievous persons more difficult.\n\nThere was evidence also by a lady that some days previous to the accident water was spurting from a hydrant without a lid in Oxford Road which, I am inclined to believe, was this same hydrant.\n\nFor the defendant Corporation there was evidence that for paving purposes the hydrants in Oxford Road, including this particular one, were in use during that period, 21st October to 4th November, after which they were inspected and were left in proper and safe condition. There was also evidence of a turncock who was notified of the accident on the same night, shortly after its happening, and inspected this hydrant box and found nothing wrong with it. How the lid came to be replaced is not known.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the circumstances and the authorities quoted to me by counsel I cannot find that the Corporation through its officials maintained this hydrant box in a negligent way so as to cause the plaintiff’s injuries. There is, in my view, no reason for holding that this type of hydrant box is of the kind that is likely to be interfered with by young irresponsible children to the knowledge of the Corporation’s officials or that any such knowledge should be imputed to them. It is my opinion that this hydrant was interfered with by some mischievous person and that no other type of hydrant which could be devised, consistent with its necessary purpose, would be safe from such malicious interference.\n\nAccordingly, this action must be dismissed and the order of the Circuit Judge reversed.\n\nBreslin v. Corcoran\n\n[2003] IESC 23 [2003] 2 ILRM 189, [2003] 2 IR 203\n\nFENNELLY J., [Nem Diss].\n\n1. It is an act of folly to leave one’s motor car in the public street, even for a short time, with the keys in the ignition. There are plenty of ill-intentioned persons around to take advantage. The consequences can be tragic. But what is the liability of the imprudent car owner to a person injured by the bad driving of the thief?\n\n2. The agreed facts of the present case are that first-named defendant left his car outside the Tea Time Express Coffee Shop in Talbot Street in Dublin unlocked and with the keys in the ignition. He dropped into the shop to buy a sandwich. As he came out, he saw an unknown person jump into the car and drive it off at speed. The car turned from Talbot Street into Talbot Lane. The plaintiff was walking across Talbot Lane. The car ran into him and injured him. For simplicity, if not accuracy, I will refer to the person who took the car as “the thief.” He may, of course, have been a joyrider or other temporary taker of the car.\n\n3. The plaintiff brought an action in the High Court against Mr Corcoran, first-named defendant, alleging negligence in leaving the car unattended in the manner described. He joined MIBI, as second defendant, “pursuant to the terms of an agreement dated the 21st day of December 1988 and made between the Minister for the Environment and the Second Named Defendant and in particular Clause 2(2) and 6 thereof.” The plaintiff succeeded before Butler J against MIBI only. The damages were agreed at £65,000. The learned High Court judge apportioned all the liability to the MIBI and gave a decree against it with costs.\n\n4. The MIBI is sued directly in this way, not as representing or standing in for the thief, but because it has agreed to compensate victims of uninsured driving, subject to the terms of the agreement. The real issue before the Court is whether there was any negligence on the part of the first named defendant. If there was, the MIBI has no liability. If not, it is bound by the agreement. The form of the proceedings is unsatisfactory in one respect. The plaintiff had a clear case against whoever was responsible for the driving of the car. There were no pleadings between the defendants. Thus MIBI was left to argue the liability of the first named defendant, in order to escape its own. In particular, the extent, if any to which the regulations, made under the Road Traffic Acts were part of the argument is unclear.\n\n5. Counsel for MIBI argued in the High Court that the first named defendant was negligent. In the circumstances, he said, it was probable that the car was going to be stolen and that it was reasonably foreseeable that the thief would injure someone. The concept of novus actus interveniens was central to the argument as were two cases, one Irish, a Circuit Court decision of McWilliam J (Dockery v O’Brien [1975] ILTR 127, “Dockery”) and one English (Topp v London Country Bus (South West) Limited [1993] 3 All ER 448, “Topp”). Reference was also made to the well-known Supreme Court decision in Conole v Redbank Oyster Company [1976] I.R. 191. Butler J had no doubt that the act of the thief amounted to a novus actus interveniens, which broke the chain of causation. He thought that, to impose any liability on the first named defendant, it would be necessary to have evidence that the car was left in an area where it should be known to the owner that people routinely stole cars for the purpose of driving them around in a reckless and dangerous fashion.\n\n6. MIBI contest these views of learned High Court judge. In particular MIBI says that he was wrong not to find that the “admitted negligence” of the owner of the car was the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries and that the chain of causation.\n\n7. The contending positions may be expressed as follows. The appellant would say that the act of leaving a motor car, unattended and unguarded, for any length of time in a public street with the keys in the ignition is clearly an act of carelessness. There is an obvious and serious risk of the car being taken, whether by way of theft, in order to commit some crime or, merely for joyriding. The culprit must necessarily be a person who does not respect the law and who is likely to be a danger to others whether by reason of general irresponsibility or while trying to get away. The first defendant would say that the taking of the car is a novus actus interveniens. It is an independent, illegal act of a third party. The car owner is not responsible for the manner of driving of the thief. He cannot control it. He should not be treated as if he had authorised the driving of the car. He is not vicariously liable.\n\nAnalysis\n\n8. In order to resolve this dispute, it is necessary to consider both the scope of the duty of care in negligence and the cause of the damage. Specifically, does the person injured by a stolen motor car come within the range of persons who can complain? Once more, the case raises the sufficiency of the test of foreseeability and hence the range of damage for which the person performing a careless act is liable.\n\n9. It is particularly helpful that Keane C.J. has, in his recent judgment in Glencar Exploration plc v Mayo County Council [2002] 1 IR 84, reviewed in a considered manner the very vexed question of the proper test for the imposition of a duty of care. In doing so, he went a long way to resolving the apparent divergence which had manifested itself from the mid nineteen eighties between the approaches of our courts and those of other common law jurisdictions, in particular those of England and Wales. The merely persuasive status of the decisions of other common law jurisdictions has not dissuaded our courts from taking its inspiration from contemporaneous new steps in the development of the common law. The decisions of the House of Lords in Donoghue v Stephenson [1932] A.C. 532 and Hedley Byrne v Heller and partners [1964] AC 465 are the best known examples.\n\n10. The famous two stage test enunciated by Lord Wilberforce in what was once regarded as the landmark case of Anns v London Borough of Merton [1978] AC 728 at 751, was, however, open to being read as postulating foreseeability as the single governing test. In truth, it led to much confusion both here and in England. After a period of some doubt both in the English and Commonwealth courts, the House of Lords, taking its lead in part form the High Court of Australia, (Council of the Shire of Sutherland v. Heyman (1985) 157 C.L.R. 424), departed from Anns ( Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1991] A.C. 391). Keane C.J., in Glencar, citing Council of the Shire of Sutherland v. Heyman, referred to the need to maintain the distinction between duties on the moral plane and those whose breach could be invoked in the law of negligence. He went on:\n\n“It is precisely that distinction between the requirements of altruism on the one hand and the law of negligence on the other hand which is in grave danger of being eroded by the approach adopted in Anns v. Merton London Borough [1978] AC 728, as it has subsequently been interpreted by some. There is, in my view, no reason why courts determining whether a duty of care arises should consider themselves obliged to hold that it does in every case where injury or damage to property was reasonably foreseeable and the notoriously difficult and elusive test of “proximity” or “neighbourhood” can be said to have been met, unless very powerful public policy considerations dictate otherwise. It seems to me that no injustice will be done if they are required to take the further step of considering whether, in all the circumstances, it is just and reasonable that the law should impose a duty of a given scope on the defendant for the benefit of the plaintiff, as held by Costello J. at first instance in Ward v. McMaster [1985] I.R. 29 by Brennan J . in Sutherland Shire Council v. Heyman [1985] 157 C.L.R. 424 and by the House of Lords in Caparo plc. v. Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605. As Brennan J. pointed out, there is a significant risk that any other approach will result in what he called a ‘massive extension of a prima facie duty of care restrained only by undefinable considerations…'”\n\n11. I consider that this passage represents the most authoritative statement of the general approach to be adopted by our courts when ruling on the existence of a duty of care. It seems to me that, in addition to the elements of foreseeability and proximity, it is natural to have regard to considerations of fairness, justice and reasonableness. Almost anything may be foreseeable. What is reasonably foreseeable is closely linked to the concept of proximity as explained in the cases. The judge of fact will naturally also consider whether it is fair and just to impose the liability. Put otherwise, it is necessary to have regard to all the relevant circumstances.\n\n12. The present case is concerned with a narrower application of the question of to whom a duty of care is owed. It raises the circumstances in which it may be proper to fix a person with liability for an act of carelessness, where a third person’s independent act has intervened between that act and has directly caused the damage. However, the general principles laid down by Keane C.J provide useful guidance.\n\n13. I will refer, firstly, to the cases directly concerned with the taking of unattended motor vehicles.\n\n14. There are two Irish Circuit decisions. The facts of Dockery are similar to the present case. An owner left his car in the street with the keys in the ignition. An intoxicated person took it and crashed into the plaintiff’s parked car. McWilliam J said:\n\n“With regard to a novus actus interveniens, Lord Reid, in the Dorset Yacht Co. case, said that, if what is relied on as a novus actus interveniens is the very thing which is likely to happen, if the want of care which is alleged takes place, the principle involved in the maxim is no defence, and he added that, unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party may be the very kind of thing which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful or careless act of the defendant…this was the very kind of thing which a reasonable person should have foreseen.”\n\n15. In Cahill v Kenneally (1955-1956) Ir Jur Rep 127), a bus driver had driven some dart players to a competition. The driver allowed some of the players back onto the bus after the event and then left the bus unattended while he went off to look for some of the passengers. In fact, the persons who drove the bus away were themselves, passengers, who started it and crashed into a parked car. According to the very brief note, Judge Patrick Roe ruled: “It was negligence on the part of the driver, when he obviously knows [sic] that the bus, if unattended, should be locked, so that it may be safe, and it was clearly dangerous to allow these men into the bus.”\n\n16. The English courts took a strikingly different approach in Topp. In that case, a bus company had a system of leaving some of their buses parked in the public street with the keys in, to facilitate changeover of drivers. Normally, there would only be an eight-minute interval, but the accident happened on a day when one driver failed to attend for duty. The bus was left for over nine hours. It was driven away and crashed into a cyclist. May J carefully reviewed a number of authorities, not only concerning the misfortunes flowing from the taking of motor vehicles, but touching on the general issue of liability where an intervening person has done the damage. His conclusion, so far as relevant, was as follows:\n\n“…It would not be fair just and reasonable to recognise the duty of care contended for here….\n\n…any affirmative duty to prevent deliberate wrongdoing by third parties, if recognised in English law, is likely to be strictly limited.\n\nIt is in my view, clear that the law should not impose such a duty on what may compendiously be called the private motorist. There could be very many different circumstances in which a private car, standing unlocked and with its ignition key in the switch, might be stolen, and then driven negligently so as to cause injury or damage. The motorist may or may not have been careless for his own property, but he should not be held for the wrongdoing of criminal hijackers.\n\n………….\n\n…problems would arise with the length of time during which the vehicle was left unattended and the place where and the circumstances in which this occurs. Is it material or crucial if the vehicle is left outside a public house? And what if the car is left for several weeks in an airport long-term car park?\n\nI do not consider that the likelihood of an unlocked and unattended minibus with its keys in the ignition being both stolen and so negligently driven as to cause injury is sufficiently strong to compel the law to impose a duty of care on the owners of the minibus.”\n\n17. The Court of Appeal approved the decision of May J. Dillon LJ held that the case was ruled by an earlier unreported case of Denton, where a bus had been taken from the private property of the bus company. Neither he nor May J thought that it made any difference whether the vehicle had been left on private property or the public road. Nonetheless, it does not appear that the Court of Appeal entirely closed the door to liability in circumstances of this sort.\n\n18. The Court of Appeal in Topp said that May J had not “laid down too rigid a line..” The judge was deciding the case before him. An appeal court should be slow to interfere with the determination of a trial judge.\n\n19. It is of some importance, however, that May J had referred to the House of Lords decision in Smith v. Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987]AC 241. In that case, in turn, the law lords referred to the more celebrated case of Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd. v. Home Office [1970] AC 1004. As noted above, McWilliam J has also found that case helpful.\n\n20. In Littlewoods, the defenders had bought a disused cinema in Dunfermline. They left it vacant pending its conversion into a supermarket. It was set on fire by some teenagers. The fire spread to neighbouring buildings, whose owners sued for damages. The claim against the defenders was that they, as owners and occupiers of a disused cinema, owed a duty to the owners of neighbouring property to take reasonable care against vandals gaining entry and setting fire in the old cinema. On the other hand, there was nothing inherently dangerous stored in the premises; the owners were not on notice of any dangerous activity by trespassers, in particular that there had been any attempts to start fires; it was common case that only twenty four hour guard would have been likely to have prevented the fire from taking.\n\n21. It must be said at once that the Littlewoods case and the present one are quite substantially different on their facts. The pursuers’ case implied a heavy duty of care, inspection and supervision of their premise on the defenders, whereas the only complaint against the first named defendant, in this case, is that he failed to take the simple step of locking his car. Moreover, the issue, in Littlewoods, turned largely on the absence of specific knowledge, on the part of the defenders, concerning the activities of trespassers and vandals on their property. In this case, by contrast, the issue is as to the level of knowledge of the nature and extent of risk that should be imputed to the owner of a motor car who fails to take that step.\n\n22. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, firstly, stated succinctly that, since the question was whether there was a duty of care to prevent fire from spreading so as to damage adjoining premises “unless Littlewoods were bound reasonably to anticipate and guard against this danger they had no duty of care, relevant to the case…,” the pursuers could not succeed. He stated, in general terms, that:\n\n“It is plain from the authorities that the fact that the damage, upon which a claim is founded, was caused by a human agent quite independent of the person against whom a claim in negligence is made does not, of itself, preclude success of the claim, since breach of duty on the part of the person against whom the claim is made may also have played a part in causing the damage.”\n\n23. He summarised the legal position, as he saw it, of a defender facing a claim to fix him with liability for damage caused by third parties:\n\n“In summary I conclude that what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a case involving injury or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases where such agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own act or omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required on which to assert that the injury or damage is more than a mere possibility. To illustrate, it is not necessary to go further than the decision of this House in Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd. v. Home Office [1970] AC 1004 where I consider that all the members of the majority found such a possible basis in the facts that the respondent’s yacht was situated very close to the island on which the Borstal boys escaped from their custodians, that the only effective means of avoiding recapture was to escape by the use of some nearby vessel, and that the only means of providing themselves with the means to continue their journey was likely to be theft from such nearby vessels. These considerations so limited the options open to the escaping boys that it became highly probable that the boys would.”\n\n24. The pursuers lost their case essentially because there was no evidence that the defenders had knowledge of the fact that the vandalising trespassers in the disused cinema were in the habit of starting fires. The House of Lords decision turned on the absence of any evidence to bring the activities of these persons within the knowledge or control of the defenders and the fact that the only remedy would have been a twenty-four hour guard.\n\n25. The Littlewoods case provides a useful point of reference for this case. In the first instance, it is interesting that the arguments and the speeches in the House of Lords were concerned principally with the foreseeability test and the issue of novus actus interveniens or the breaking of the chain of causation played little direct part in the reasoning.\n\n26. Having regard to its special facts, it was natural that Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd. v. Home Office should figure largely in the speeches in Littlewoods. The assumed facts ( the case came before the House of Lords as a preliminary issue of law) were that seven Borstal boys, who were working as trainees on an island under the control and supervision of three officers of the Home Office, escaped from the island at night. They boarded, cast adrift and damaged the plaintiffs’ yacht which was moored offshore. The officers were assumed to have gone to bed, in breach of their instructions, leaving the trainees to their own devices. The plaintiffs, owners of the damaged yacht, in their action against the Home Office, alleged negligence consisting in the officers’ failure, knowing, as they did of the boys’ criminal records and records of previous escapes from Borstal institutions, to exercise any effective control or supervision over them and knowing that craft such as the plaintiffs’ yacht were moored offshore.\n\n27. Lord Reid said (page 1028 of the report) that it had never been the law that the intervention of some independent human action “always prevents the ultimate damage from being regarded as having been caused by the original carelessness.” He then asked what was the “dividing line.” He went on: “Is it foreseeability or is it such a degree of probability as warrants the conclusion that the intervening human conduct was the natural and probable cause of what preceded it?” Lord Reid’s considered answer, following a review of the authorities was:\n\n“These cases show that, where human action forms one of the links between the original wrongdoing of the defendant and the loss suffered by the plaintiff, that action must at least have been something very likely to happen if it is not to be regarded as novus actus interveniens breaking the chain of causation. I do not think that a mere foreseeable possibility is or should be sufficient, for then the intervening human action can more properly be regarded as a new cause than as a consequence of the original wrongdoing. But if the intervening action was likely to happen I do not think that it can matter whether that action was innocent or tortious or criminal. Unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party is often the “very kind of thing” which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful or careless act of the defendant. And in the present case, on the facts which we must assume at this stage, I think that the taking of a boat by the escaping trainees and their unskillful navigation leading to damage to another vessel were the very kind of thing that these Borstal officers ought to have seen to be likely.”\n\n28. Where Lord Reid spoke of whether the thing to be guarded against, the escape, was “very likely to happen,” Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest spoke in terms of “a manifest and obvious risk,” and Lord Diplock, though also speaking of likelihood was more concerned to confine the right to recover to persons “who had property situate in the immediate vicinity.” An important element in the assessment by the House of Lords in the Dorset Yacht case of what is reasonably foreseeable is whether the event in question is the “very kind of thing” against which precautions must be taken. The reason is the probability of the thing happening. Lord Reid’s analysis, based as it was, on the insufficiency of mere foreseeability and the need for compliance with the additional test of reasonable probability is the most helpful for the present case.\n\n29. This Court had already adopted that approach in Cunningham v McGrath Bros. [1964] I.R. 209. The defendants had left a ladder in a street leaning against their premises, after the completion of work. An unknown person moved the ladder to another nearby street where it later fell upon and injured the plaintiff. Kingsmill Moore J, in a unanimous judgment responded (at page 214 of the judgment) to an argument based on the breaking of the chain of causation:\n\n“It is not every ‘novus actus’ which breaks the chain of causation. ‘If what is relied upon as novus actus interveniens is the very kind of thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged takes place, the principle embodied in the maxim is no defence. The whole question is whether or not, to use the words of the leading case, Hadley v. Baxendale (1) the accident can be said to be ‘the natural and probable result’ of the breach of duty. If it is the very thing which ought to be anticipated . . . or one of the things likely to arise as a consequence of his wrongful act, it is no defence; it is only a step in the way of proving that the damage is the result of the wrongful act . . .”\n\nHe stated the test as follows (at page 215):\n\n“I am of opinion that the test to be applied is whether the person responsible for creating the nuisance should anticipate as a reasonable and probable consequence that some person in pursuance of his rights would attempt to abate the nuisance and in so doing would create a danger.”\n\n30. From all these cases, I draw the following conclusion. A person is not normally liable, if he has committed an act carelessness, where the damage has been directly caused by the intervening independent act of another person, for whom he is not otherwise vicariously responsible. Such liability may exist, where the damage caused by that other person was the very kind of thing which he was bound to expect and guard against and the resulting damage was likely to happen, if he did not.\n\n31. Before turning to the scope of the duty of care in the present case, I need to refer to a\n\nmatter raised in the submissions of the MIBI, but which was not referred to in the High Court judgment. The Road Traffic (Construction, Use and Equipment of Vehicle) Regulations (S.I. 190) of 1963, Regulation 87 provide, in relevant part:\n\n“87. (1) Where a vehicle as allowed to remain stationary on a public road, the driver shall not, subject to sub-article (2) of this article, leave the vehicle unattended unless—\n\n(a) the engine of the vehicle is not running,\n\n(b) where the engine is contained in a separate portion of the vehicle capable of being closed, such portion is closed, and\n\n(c) where the vehicle is fitted under article 31 of these Regulations with a door or doors capable of being locked or with a device for preventing unauthorised driving, such door, doors or device is or are locked so as to prevent the vehicle being driven, and, where appropriate, the key of the door, doors or device is removed from the vehicle.”\n\n32. No claim based on breach of statutory duty was made against the first named Defendant. This is not to exclude the relevance of the Regulation. In my view, this Court can have regard to it when considering the scope of the duty of care of the first named defendant.\n\nConclusion\n\n33. The test then is not merely that of reasonable foreseeability. It is, in addition, necessary to ask whether it was probable that the unattended car, if taken, would be driven do carelessly as to cause damage to others. It seems to me beyond argument, and it is not really disputed, that it was reasonably foreseeable that the car would be stolen.\n\n34. It cannot be seriously disputed, that it was reasonably foreseeable as well as likely that the unattended car, with its keys in the ignition, would be stolen. I think it is obvious that to do all these things in a busy city street, without any mitigating circumstances, is an act of gross carelessness.\n\n35. In modern circumstances, it is obvious that failure to exercise proper control and supervision over motor cars involves a serious risk of damage and worse to innocent people. It is equally clear that it was reasonably foreseeable that any goods, which might have been left in the car, would be stolen. Thus, if the motor car owner had been carrying goods commercially and, perhaps even looking after them gratuitously, for others, he would probably have been liable to the owners for their loss; similarly, if he had borrowed or rented the car, in respect of any damage to the vehicle. In each of these cases, it seems to me that the test of proximity would have been satisfied. Theft of the car or its contents could be regarded as “the very thing” against the custodian of the car should guard. They are directly related to the act of theft.\n\n36. The nub of the case is, of course, the possible liability of the first named defendant for injuries caused by the negligent driving of the thief. Even if the owner of the car, or the driver, if not the owner, should be held liable to the owner of contents or of the car itself for damage to either of these items of property, it is not easy to articulate the basis for his automatic liability to the victim of negligent driving of the car.\n\n37. It is the negligent driving, not the taking of the car, which has caused the damage. It would have to be shown that the owner should have foreseen not merely the taking but also the negligent driving. There would have to be some basis in the evidence, such as that suggested by the learned trial judge, for a finding that the car, if stolen, was likely to be driven in such a way as to endanger others. Cars may be stolen for reasons which do not carry such implications. Some of these, though criminal, do not necessarily imply dangerous driving. The line would, on any view, have to be drawn somewhere. If a car were stolen for resale, the owner could scarcely be responsible for the driving of the purchaser, whether that person were honest or not.\n\n38. In my view, there is nothing in the present case to suggest that the first-named defendant should have anticipated as a reasonable probability that the car, if stolen, would be driven so carelessly as to cause injury to another user of the road such as the plaintiff.\n\n39. I would dismiss the appeal.\n\nBegadon v Laois Hunt Club Ltd & anor\n\n[2019] IEHC 343 (17 May 2019)\n\nO’Hanlon J.\n\nStatus:\n\nJUDGMENT of Ms. Justice Bronagh O’Hanlon delivered on the 17th day of May, 2019\n\n1. The plaintiff is an experienced horse rider and her date of birth 1st February, 1983. On 8th March, 2014, the plaintiff paid a levy to join a day’s hunting with the Laois Hunt Club Limited and brings her proceedings claiming damages in respect of an incident which occurred on the lands of the second named defendant at Ballygeehan, Ballyacolla in the county of Laois. The said defendant was the owner, occupier and manager of the said lands,\n\n2. The plaintiff had successfully traversed a river on the lands of the second named defendant and this led into a field with a whitethorn tree obstacle, on the other side of which were brambles and a fall-away portion. The plaintiff made the decision to jump this particular obstacle and the horse’s feet got caught in the brambles causing the horse to roll on top of the plaintiff. The plaintiff suffered a severe back injury. Her claim is that this particular obstacle constituted a hazard which was foreseeable, in relation to which she ought to have been advised not to jump that particular obstacle.\n\n3. Her claim is that the defendants did not take any reasonable care for her safety, failed to take any adequate precautions in terms of safety, examination or other measures, caused and/or her permitted on obstruction/danger which they have may or ought to have known the participant would have jumped over and failed to have adequate personnel or procedures in place. A full defence was filed pleading that any act or omission on the part of the defendants, their servants or agents was not sufficiently proximate to the alleged acts or omissions. It is expressly denied that she was required to jump the particular obstacle to enable her to continue with the hunt and that on the contrary, the Field Master of the hunt, having inspected the said obstacle, instructed the field not to jump it and led the hunt away from same. It is alleged that the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of jumping the said obstacle of her own volition and that she deliberately ignored the instruction of the Field Master.\n\n4. A plea of contributory negligence is also made. It is alleged that she jumped of her own volition, she failed to stay behind the Field Master and follow his line and that she disregarded the rest of the field who were led away from the particular obstacle in question, and that she jumped an obstacle which was not part of the hunt route, failing to have regard to her own previous experience, thereby exposing her to a risk of injury of which she knew or ought to have known and that she failed to have any or any due regard for her own safety. It is alleged that she failed to adhere to hunting etiquette and voluntarily assumed the risk.\n\nEvidence of the Plaintiff\n\n5. The plaintiff said that at 2:30pm on the day of the accident, after one and a half hours riding, she was near the back of the hunt and she thought that people were queuing up to jump the particular obstacle. A third party invited her to go first, but after she jumped to the left hand side there was a heap of brambles and her horse went into these going forward, pulling her forward and that the horse came down on top of her. She knew that she was seriously injured as she could only take shallow breaths and she knew that her teeth were damaged. She confirmed that she was wearing every piece of essential safety equipment including gaiters, a helmet and jodhpurs. Despite her requests that she ought not be moved she was physically lifted up and taken across the river and had to walk a quarter of mile before she reached a jeep belonging to a member of her family.\n\n6. The plaintiff agreed that she was an avid hunt follower, and that she had broken in the mare she was riding and that she was an experienced rider but she thought that this particular obstacle looked like the route she was to follow and there was no one there to tell her that this was not the case.\n\n7. The plaintiff agreed that the Field Master goes out front wearing a red coat, followed by the rest of the hunt and she further agreed that one does not pass him and that where he goes, the riders follow. The distinction between show jumping and cross country riding was discussed with her where one could walk the course in advance but it was put to her that fox hunting was unpredictable. The plaintiff believed that a person ought to be told about a danger and she accepted that her obligation was to keep up with the hunt insofar as she could.\n\n8. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she did not hang back in the hunt and she believed that her mare listened to her and that she was cantering into the jump, counting her rhythm into it and she was going to take a direct line into it. She believed that often red tape would be used and that there is a certain amount of predictability in this day and age. She said she did make an informed decision as whether to jump or not and she confirmed her life work as a pony club instructor teaching children and getting them ready for tests in terms of hunt etiquette. She said she was counting down her strides as she approached this jump and that she was well over it but then saw the brambles. She confirmed that she believed she ought not to have been moved in the manner applied and that an ambulance could have accessed the locus of the accident where she was.\n\nEvidence of Commandant Derek Connell\n\n9. The witness confirmed that he has been an ex-Irish Army horse coach and national showjumper, and he was aware that the plaintiff was an experienced rider. He did indicate that the plaintiff’s mare had not done a huge amount of hunting and he said that a horse could have done ten years of hunting, twenty times a season and could still be an unsuitable horse and confirmed further that there was a certain amount of unpredictability in hunting.\n\n10. This witness stressed that they were a group of people at the particular obstacle and that the Field Master ought to have filtered the message back not to jump the particular obstacle in question. He said there would no obligation to have a tape at the site. He said that possibly there could have been a red flag put at the site to warn people. He noted that the Field Master ought to or could have told one of his subordinates to stay at that point to stop people jumping that obstacle and he said that to go around that obstacle was unsafe. His view was that the helpers at the hunt ought to have indicated that the riders ought not jump the particular obstacle, that there was an obvious danger and that it was not suitable. This etiquette ought to have dictated that this would have happened.\n\n11. This witness accepted that one could have five or six ambulance cases in any one season and that most riders were not entering competitions and most horses were not hunting. He further indicated that there were few show jumpers who do hunt and that hunting is a different discipline and that there is an assumption that one would have a safe landing. This witness said that it was strange given the hazard that there had not been communication and that there was a relatively small time gap to assess the situation and he was surprised word did not filter back.\n\nThe Defence Case\n\n12. Mr. David Lawlor gave evidence that he had 60 years hunting experience with the Laois Hunt and that he was Field Master of that hunt for last 25 years. He noted that the huntsman was paid, everyone else was voluntary and that there would normally be six to seven serious falls in a season.\n\n13. This witness described the procedure involved for him in getting permission from surrounding farmers to traverse their lands in the days coming up to the hunt and that this would involve between 30 to 35 farms in the vicinity and that such hunting takes place twice a week in the season. He described the normal situation as having two whips in front helping with the hounds and that it was the Field Master’s job to keep order and to make sure that as guests of the particular farmer whose lands they traverse that the riders do not abuse the situation. He explained that in fox hunting, the only given route is to the first “draw” and if there is no fox there, one proceeds to the second “draw”. His view was that the unpredictability of fox hunting was the big attraction and that he had been out 30 days this season on his own hunter and that the particular mare which the plaintiff was riding was a novice, although it had hunted on one occasion prior to that day. This witness said no one uses red flags in fox hunting and that it goes against the nature of such hunting.\n\n14. This witness gave evidence that on the day, there was no fox found at the first draw and he, therefore, took the field to the left and that there was a flood plain to the back and that he crossed the river and saw the bushes, 50 to 60 metres away when he came out of the river and that there was a pile of debris in it which had been taken out of the river and he could see wire and what he thought were the remains of a gate so he passed back the message that it was dangerous and unsafe.\n\n15. This witness considered that this was a very obvious danger and that he himself was on an excellent horse and that he deemed the jump not safe. He gave evidence that he told a few people behind not to jump that obstacle and if a person then did so it was entirely at their own risk if they broke every bone in their body. A quarter of a mile down the river he was going on to the field and he saw two to three people around the particular obstacle and two horses run out of it i.e. they did not take that fence and he saw the plaintiff’s horse fall from far away.\n\n16. This witness’s view was that there was no necessity to go near that particular obstacle, that it was 50 to 80 yards from where they came out of the river and that it was important theoretically for people to jump what they have to jump and when it was put to him that he knew that it was dangerous he said there were plenty of other things later that day which were dangerous to jump. He said that he himself would have checked and double checked and that the horse was on a first day’s outing and that the plaintiff was a novice.\n\n17. He personally informed people of a danger, he knew that he was not in a position during a fox hunt to inform everyone personally and that there would be nobody walking around. He said he never had to warn people to jump before, it was very rare. This witness did agree that it was unsafe to jump the particular obstacle in question.\n\nEvidence of Mr. Christopher Ryan\n\n18. Mr. Christopher Ryan said that he was an eighth generation huntsman and a horse rider with ten to fifteen years’ experience and was a Senior Master of the Scarteen Hounds. This witness made the point that a horse can weigh up to half a ton and that a mistake could be a very bad one with the rider in primary control and that one has to look to the person in front in order to safeguard the horse and oneself. He described it as quite natural for a young horse to jump to the left as happened at the site of this incident but he stressed that it was the rider who was in primary control and he said with regard to the issue of whether the plaintiff was schooling her horse, he said that would not be allowed and that if a person did that they would not be allowed to hunt there again.\n\n19. This witness felt that it was the duty of the rider to know what was on the other side of a jump and he said that a hunt ride is not a prepared track where every jump is flagged and that the hunting field by its nature is not prepared in that manner and that he never heard of a hunt taking responsibility for what happens. He further added that the rider is responsible for their horse and assumes responsibility and that she did not look at what was on the other side and that the horse has to learn to think for himself.\n\n20. This witness believed that the Field Master, on this occasion, in informing those of his followers not to jump that fence, did everything one could reasonably expect. He noted that the stragglers were out of earshot of the field marshal and that it was very evident that no horse had jumped the particular jump and that people have to take responsibility for their own actions. He said that the whole idea was that riders watch the Field Master and take their lead from him. This witness indicated that it was not part of the culture of fox hunting to flag jumps to be avoided in his 27 years’ experience of hunting. His view was that the plaintiff had paid €25 to be entitled to hunt and everything was prepared for her and that that money goes towards upkeep and costs.\n\nEvidence of Ms. Suzanne Macken, B.A.\n\n21. This witness prepared an expert report and knew that the plaintiff was a good rider, had her British Horse Society Exams and had looked at the fence with five paces to jump and that every fence ought to have been checked by the rider. She noted that the horse was young and that with such a horse there was a risk that it would go to the side and that if she herself had seen the back of the hedge, she would not have jumped the particular obstacle. Her view was that the plaintiff needed a good line to the fence and would have needed a good right side to stop the risk of the horse turning towards the left and also she ought to have checked by walking around the fence first and that one ought not to jump unnecessarily.\n\n22. This witness took the view that the plaintiff had missed the fact that there were no tracks around the particular obstacle and that this ought to have been a sign to the plaintiff that the hunt was not taking that path.\n\n23. This witness took the view that when one was out hunting, one is supposed to keep up with the Field Master and that it is not good to have stragglers hanging around at the back of the hunt and that that is an impossible situation. She said that word does not always filter back in a hunt and that when one goes hunting, one exercises free will that from the hunt’s perspective, no other action could have been taken.\n\nThe Plaintiff’s Injuries\n\n24. After a considerable period of time awaiting surgery, the plaintiff was transferred from Tullamore General Hospital to the care of Mr. Devitt, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon in Galway when he diagnosed unstable fractures in T6 and T7 vertebrae and she underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with instrumentation from T4 – T9. The plaintiff had to have two teeth crowned as a result of the injuries. No spinal cord injury was suffered by her and normal neurology was noted.\n\n25. In all, the plaintiff spent three weeks in hospital, she had six sessions of physiotherapy, ten GP visits and six specialist visits and had to remain off work for a one year period. Her GP notes that there is ongoing back discomfort for between three to five years post injury. The plaintiff has normal spine alignment with a scar of 20 cm at the injury site, and some tenderness over the rod to the left. It is unlikely that an operation will be carried out to remove the rods on medical advice. There are no neurological deficits in her lower limbs.\n\nThe Law\n\n26. In relation to the second named defendant, the general rule in terms of fox hunting is that the members of the field waive all claims against landowners for injuries to themselves or their mounts. The argument is made that the plaintiff in paying the cap fee, therefore, opts to follow the rules of hunting etiquette. Given her experience, it is accepted that her expertise in preparing others for tests in hunting etiquette, the plaintiff was therefore aware of the rules and accepted them.\n\n27. In looking at the duty of care of the second named defendant towards the plaintiff, the test is one of reasonable care. Reference is made to Peart J. in Vega and Cullen [2005] IEHC 362, “there is no meaningful distinction between the common law duty of care and the statutory duty of care under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995”.\n\n28. Under s. 3 of Occupiers Liability Act 2005:\n\n“(1) An occupier of premises owes a duty of care (‘the common duty of care’) towards a visitor thereto except in so far as the occupier extends, restricts, modifies or excludes that duty in accordance with section 5.\n\n(2) In this section ‘the common duty of care’ means a duty to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances (having regard to the care which a visitor may reasonably be expected to take for his or her own safety and, if the visitor is on the premises in the company of another person, the extent of the supervision and control the latter person may reasonably be expected to exercise over the visitor’s activities) to ensure that a visitor to the premises does not suffer injury or damage by reason of any danger existing thereon.”\n\n29. In Heaves v. Westmeath County Council 20 ILT (ns) 235 (2001), where the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1995 came into play regarding an incident on the grounds of a large house and in this case, it was found that the duty of care found under s. 3(1) of the Act was to take “reasonable care and no more”.\n\n30. In the instant case, given the nature of the hunt, in that it follows a fox’s scent and that the fox could go anywhere on the land or property it is not, therefore, foreseeable that a safe route or safety audit could take place in advance of a person taking such a route. Therefore, on the balance of probabilities, the second named defendant could not be deemed not to have taken reasonable care regarding his property. His only involvement was that he was contacted by the Master of the Hunt in advance and gave permission for the hunt to cross his land. He can have no liability in the matter.\n\nThe law\n\n31. In the English decision of Caldwell v. Maguire and Fitzgerald [2001] EWCA 1054 Holland J. sets out in relation to the issues of liability concerning jockeys, a test to assist with the determination of both liability and the duty of care and found that each contestant in a lawful sporting contest (and in particular a race) owes a duty of care to each and all other contestants.\n\n32. Secondly, Holland J. found that that duty is to exercise in the course of the contest all care that is objectively reasonable in the prevailing circumstances for the avoidance of infliction of injury to such fellow contestants.\n\n33. The Learned Judge also found that the prevailing circumstances are all such properly attendant upon the contest and include its object, the demands inevitably made upon its contestants, its inherent dangers (if any), its rules, conventions and customs and the standards, skills and judgment reasonable to be expected of a contestant. His view that this must include the rules of racing and the standards, skills and judgment of a professional jockey, i.e. all as expected by fellow contestants.\n\n34. Fourthly, he found that given the nature of such prevailing circumstances, the threshold for liability is in practice inevitably high; the proof of a breach of duty will not flow from proof of no more than an error of judgment or from mere proof of a momentary lapse in skill and thus care (respectively, when subject to the stress of a race). Such are no more than incidents inherent in the nature of the sport.\n\n35. Fifthly, in practice, it may therefore be difficult to prove any such breach of duty, absent proof of conduct that in point of fact amounts to reckless disregard for the fellow competitor’s safety. The Learned Judge emphasised the distinction between the expression of legal principle and the practicalities of the evidential burden.\n\nFindings of Fact and General Issues on Liability\n\n36. The main contention of the plaintiff was that she ought to have been advised not to take the particular jump in question and that insufficient effort was made in terms of passing back the information to her that the Field Master had indicated to members of the hunt not to take the said jump. The question in this case is the extent of a duty of care towards an individual such as the plaintiff and whether such duty exists as a legally recognised obligation requiring the defendant to conform to a certain behaviour for others against reasonable risks.\n\n37. The court has considered Roote v. Sheldon [1967] 116 CLR at 383, decided by the Australian Supreme Court examining the duty of care in relation to a water sports incident. The plaintiff in that case believed he ought to have been cautioned in relation to a boat nearby and on the basis that the boat allegedly had not been adequately controlled. Barwick C.J. found that these two grounds were not inherent risks but at p. 384 of his judgment, he indicated:\n\n“By engaging in a sport or pastime, the participants may be held to have accepted risks which are inherent in that sport or pastime…the tribunal of fact can make its own assessment of what the accepted risks are; but this does not eliminate all duty of care of the one participant to the other.”\n\n38. In the instant case, falling due to the nature of the sport must be considered to be an inherent risk. The plaintiff was aware of the nature of the sport and the fact that the hunt was taking place on unpredictable terrain on a working farm where the fox is unpredictable and can go anywhere and where the evidence was that the expanse of between 30 and 35 acres was in play in terms of the terrain which might or might not be covered. The argument therefore is that there was an inherent risk which the plaintiff assumed.\n\n39. With reference to Condon v. Basi [1985] 1 WLR 866, Donaldson M.R. summarised reference to Roote v. Sheldon:\n\n“…you are under a duty to take all reasonable care taking into account of the circumstances in which you are placed;\n\nWhich in a game of football are quite different from those which affect you when you are going for a walk in the countryside.”\n\n40. This Court finds that the Master of the Hunt the Field Master on the day in question was an experienced Master having been in that position since 1992. He was chairperson of the Irish Masters of the Foxhound Association and since he found no way of seeing the landing site he turned away from the particular obstacle and instructed the field. It seems to this Court therefore that the rules and etiquette of fox hunting were followed by him. It appears to this Court that the warning was properly communicated to a reasonable standard, that it was obviously given to a considerable number of people and only three of the rider group of 40 to 50 riders, including the plaintiff, attempted to jump the particular obstacle. Furthermore two riders turned away from the obstacle without taking that particular jump.\n\n41. It seems to this Court that there was an obligation on all members of the hunt to follow the Field Master, to keep reasonably close to him and not to lag behind at the back of the hunt and to ensure they were appraised of any directions he gave. I find as a fact that the Field Master gave the warning to those behind him in the field whom he advised to pass the word on, and that in so doing he was following the established practice of fox hunting and that he did so in a manner that was entirely reasonable.\n\n42. The plaintiff makes the complaint that those who came to give immediate assistance did not follow her request that she not be moved and the plaintiff complained as to the manner in which she was moved causing her to be assisted back over the river and to have to walk for a considerable distance, and being linked by two people where she was brought to a yard for her boyfriend to collect her by car. Although her evidence was that an ambulance could have reached on the particular piece of terrain in question and while I don’t doubt the veracity of that, there was no evidence whatsoever adduced to suggest that this manner of moving her in anyway caused injury to her or made worse the injuries she had received.\n\n43. This Court accepts the evidence of the Field Master of the Hunt and that of Ms. Suzanne Macken, in particular in terms of the rules and etiquette of hunting and in terms of the valid criticism made of the plaintiff and her approach to this hunt.\n\n44. The plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of a mare which had only hunted once before, even though the plaintiff was an accomplished horse person she was an inexperienced hunter on an inexperienced horse taking part in an entirely unpredictable sport with the fox at its centre.\n\n45. She did not have due regard for her own safety. She was obliged to keep up with the hunt and with the Field Master and not lag behind. She ought not to have jumped unnecessarily the dangerous jump in relation to which a warning had been given. The expanse of acreage involved and nature of fox hunting mean that the type of precautions which might be used in other forms of horse-riding could not reasonably be expected as the standard of fox hunting, given the nature of this sport.\n\nConclusion on Liability\n\n46. There is no doubt but that the plaintiff suffered a serious injury in this accident. However, given that the Court has found against the Plaintiff on Liability the Court confines itself to that issue. It seems to this Court however that reasonable care was taken by both defendants in relation to the outing in question. Crucially, the rules and procedures of the sport were followed and the master did fulfil his obligations in relation to the jump, the defendant having the final decision to make as to whether she ought to jump or not the particular jump in question. It seems to this Court that the first named defendant in particular exercised all care objectively or subjectively reasonable in the circumstances of this particular case and while the second named defendant was joined in the proceedings his consent was obtained prior to this hunt to traverse his lands and there is no negligence found against him in all the circumstances. It is quite clear that although the Field Master sent back word not to jump the particular jump in question word does not always get back to all the participants and that one hunts of one’s free will. It is noted also that the particular horse the plaintiff was using on the day in question had done one-day cross country hunting prior to that and it was assumed that she would not hunt on that horse given that it was its first day of an actual hunt. From the perspective of the hunt no other action could have been taken.\n\n47. Taking into account the evidence given of the high level of unpredictability which was described as a feature of foxhunting, in the nature of the sport, and forming a big attraction to this sport, and that the use of red flags was not seen as a feature of the sport. Thus, the high bar required to prove negligence or reasonable foreseeability has not been reached. The court hereby dismisses the plaintiff’s claim.\n\nCarolan v The Board of Management of St Ciaran’s National School\n\n[2006] IEHC 416 (06 July 2006)\n\nMR. JUSTICE FEENEY: This is a claim brought by the\n\nplaintiff for damages for\n\npersonal injury arising from an accident that occurred to the\n\nplaintiff at the defendant’s school on 13 May 1997. The\n\nplaintiff was on that date some five weeks short of her 13th\n\nbirthday and was in sixth class. She had started in that\n\nschool at the beginning of fifth class and was nearing the\n\nend of her second full year as a student of that school.\n\nDuring both her years in the school, the plaintiff’s teacher\n\nwas Mr. John Walsh. Mr. Walsh was an experienced teacher,\n\nhaving graduated from St. Patrick’s in Drumcondra in 1974,\n\nand by the time of the accident had been continuously working\n\nas a primary school teacher for over 20 years, and by the\n\ntime he came to give evidence for some 32 years.\n\nThe system as St. Ciaran’s was that one teacher taught all\n\nsubjects to a particular class. Mr. Walsh was Aoife\n\nCarrollan’s teacher and he covered everything in the\n\ncurriculum including physical education. At the time of the\n\naccident Mr. Walsh was taking a PE class which was due to\n\nlast for about one hour starting at 1:30 p.m. and ending\n\nshortly before the end of the school day at 2:40 p.m. The\n\naccident occurred during a game of “dodgeball” which was part\n\nof the PE class. The form of “dodgeball” being used was a\n\nparticular variation used in the school. During the course\n\nof the game, which had been going on for some time, the\n\nplaintiff had to run or traverse the width of the room and\n\nhad to avoid being hit by any of three sponge balls being\n\nthrown by three classmates.\n\nThey, the classmates, were standing to the side as the\n\nplaintiff crossed the floor and the plaintiff had to avoid\n\nbeing hit by dodging, weaving, stopping and running. The\n\nobject of the game was to avoid being hit and to cross the\n\nroom. If a pupil was hit that pupil was out, and went to sit\n\non a bench. The plaintiff was the last successful pupil,\n\nthat is un-hit, whilst crossing the room, and had to make one\n\nmore successful crossing to finish the game. The plaintiff\n\nhad made some three or four crossings without being hit to be\n\nthe last pupil in the game.\n\nIn making the final crossing the plaintiff avoided the first\n\nball and in trying to avoid either the second or the third,\n\nthe plaintiff is uncertain in her evidence as to which, she\n\nwas ducking or weaving and came to a stop and in moving off\n\nagain to try and reach the far side, she stumbled or tripped\n\nover her own legs and fell to the ground on her left arm.\n\nThat fall caused a severe injury to the left arm and she had\n\na fracture of both her ulna and radius. The injury was so\n\nsevere as to require open reduction and internal fixation and\n\nthereafter a further operation to remove the metal plate.\n\nThe plaintiff has been left with two extensive scars on\n\neither side of her forearm, one of approximately eight inches\n\nin the length and the other of approximately six inches.\n\nThe above factual description of the accident is not disputed\n\nand is accepted as an accurate description of how the\n\naccident occurred. There are a small number of factual\n\nmatters in dispute; there is no issue as at suitability of\n\nthe premises or in particular as to the suitability of the\n\nfloor surface and this was expressly acknowledged in the\n\nopening of the plaintiff’s case. It was also acknowledged\n\nthat there was no issue in relation to supervision.\n\nThe facts that are in issue are whether the plaintiff had\n\never previously been involved in a game of “dodgeball” and\n\nsecondly, whether the game was being used as a warm up at the\n\nstart of the class period rather than towards the end of the\n\nperiod following an independent warm up. The evidence\n\nconcerning whether or not the plaintiff had taken part in the\n\nthis “dodgeball” game on a previous occasion or not is\n\nsomewhat uncertain. The plaintiff believes it was her first\n\nexperience of the game. The teacher, Mr. Walsh, indicated\n\nthat had the game was a regular feature of a PE class and\n\nthat the plaintiff, in all probability, would have\n\nparticipated on a number of occasions during her time with\n\nhim in fifth and sixth classes.\n\nThe plaintiff had certain absences during fifth class due to\n\nill health but had been a regular attender during sixth\n\nclass. On balance I would favour the evidence which suggests\n\nthat the plaintiff would have participated in this type of\n\ngame on other occasions. It is unlikely that she would have\n\nmissed all the occasions during fifth and sixth class when it\n\nwas played. However this finding is not of particular\n\nsignificance as it is apparent that the variation of\n\n“dodgeball” used in the school had simple and straightforward\n\nrules of a basic kind and by the time of the accident the\n\nplaintiff would have been aware of the format of the game or\n\nactivity.\n\nAlso there is no case made to suggest that a lack of\n\nunderstanding of the format caused the accident. It is the\n\nformat itself rather than a knowledge of same which is\n\ncriticised by the plaintiff. The issue of the use of the\n\ngame or activity as a warm up is by and large academic. It\n\nis extensively questioned as a suitable warm up exercise in\n\nthe report of the plaintiff’s Physical Education expert, Ms.\n\nJudith Wooton. However, the balance of evidence tends to\n\nsupport the view that there was an independent warm up of the\n\ntype approved by Ms. Wooton. The plaintiff and her classmate\n\ndo not recall one on that day, but the evidence of Mr. Walsh\n\nindicates that there was an independent warm up. The Court\n\nprefers that evidence and the lack of recall on the part of\n\nthe plaintiff and her classmate can be explained by the\n\npassage of time.\n\nThe Court accepts that it is likely that the accident\n\nhappened towards the end of the PE class as suggested by\n\nMr. Walsh, rather than early on as contended for by the\n\nplaintiff. The teacher’s evidence that the Head Master was\n\nsent for after the accident and that when he arrived, the\n\nclass time was nearly over. And that evidence is strongly\n\nsupportive of the accident happening near 2:30 p.m. after the\n\nmajority of the class time had passed. The Court favors the\n\nevidence that there was an independent warm up. Even if\n\nthere was not, the activity involved in the class up to the\n\ntime of the accident or even the limited activity involved in\n\nthe particular “dodgeball” game would have been sufficient\n\nfor a warm up. Also the type of injury and accident do not\n\nrelate to the existence or non-existence of a warm up.\n\nThe real criticism put forward on behalf of the plaintiff was\n\nthat the variation of “dodgeball” used in the school or its\n\nparticular format was unsafe and should have been identified\n\nas such. And it was unsafe because the throwers threw from a\n\nright angle position or sideways-on to the direction that the\n\nplaintiff was required to run. It is suggested that by\n\nhaving the three throwers sideways-on to the direction the\n\nplaintiff was travelling, that this caused a so called\n\nconflict in the focus of attention. By having a conflict of\n\nattention between the travelling forward and the looking\n\nsideways to see the balls approaching, together with the\n\nadded likelihood of the participant moving or jerking her or\n\nhis head together with the pressure to succeed, resulted in a\n\nsituation where there was a clear risk of a participant\n\nlosing balance and tripping or falling. This contention was\n\nsupport bid the evidence of Ms. Wooton. The Court does not\n\nhave regard to the engineer’s view on the appropriateness of\n\nthe activity as it considers his expertise to be of marginal,\n\nif any, relevance to such matters.\n\nThe defendant’s case is that this was a simple straight\n\nforward game or activity, suitable for 12 year old with no\n\nsignificant risk of injury over and above the risk inherent\n\nin physical activity, where a trip or fall can occur. And\n\nthat the format was safe and shown to be safe by 20 years of\n\nuse and there being only one accident, that is the accident\n\nthe subject matter of this case. This view was supported by\n\nthe evidence of Dr. Joseph Lennon.\n\nThe Court has considered both experts’ evidence and the\n\nevidence as to fact, and is of the clear view that the more\n\nrational and credible evidence of expert opinion is that of the\n\ndefendants. The experts evidence called by the defendant is\n\nin the Court’s view compelling in support of an absence of\n\nnegligence on the part of the defendant. This is not a case\n\nof defective premises or equipment or lack of supervision,\n\nbut rather a claim that a particular activity or game was\n\nunsuitable, likely to cause injury or as stated by the\n\nplaintiff’s counsel, inherently dangerous and ill-considered\n\nas being suitable for 12 year-olds. The Court is of the view\n\nthat this contention is based upon a contrived examination\n\nand analysis of the game or activity.\n\nThe criticism from the plaintiff’s expert lacks reality and\n\ndisregards many activities and games requiring a conflict of\n\nfocus; it disregards the simple and straight forward nature\n\nof the activity or game compared to other more complicated\n\ngames suitable for and played by 12 years old, such as\n\nfootball or basketball, and it also disregards 20 years of\n\nsafe use of the game.\n\nThe Court is satisfied that the facts of this case show that\n\nthe plaintiff dodged and weaved to avoid a ball she saw\n\napproaching and came to a stop. That appears to be common\n\ncase, and when taking off again she tripped herself. That\n\nunfortunate event is a type of risk or event inherent in\n\nphysical activity and it is the Court’s view that the school\n\ndid not impose an unsuitable or unsafe activity but rather\n\ninsured that an activity suitably and reasonably safe was\n\nbeing followed. The Court is of the view that such activity\n\nproperly formed part of a PE class.\n\nThe Court found Dr. Lennon’s evidence and opinion credible,\n\npractical, and based on true experience. It accepts the\n\nevidence from him that this was a simple, safe game suitable\n\nfor the premises and pupils. As he said, “the game of the\n\nsimplest and safest form”. The Court is satisfied that the\n\ntheory of risk emanating from dual focus is unreal and\n\ncontrived. What happened here was an accident which can\n\narise during any physical activity. All physical activity\n\ncarries some risk; the Court is satisfied that the chosen\n\nactivity did not unreasonably or unsafely create a risk and\n\nthat the game was properly chosen for use and appropriately\n\nconsidered by the teachers, both as to use and format. There\n\nis, as Dr. Lennon says, a risk of falling in any moving game.\n\nThe risk is incidental, not inherent. And the Court is the\n\nof the view that it certainly cannot be categorised as this\n\ngame being inherently dangerous. Physical activity is both\n\nan appropriate and vital part of the school curriculum and\n\nthe activity chosen here was a simple and straight forward\n\ngame that could be safely played. The Court is fully\n\nsatisfied that there was no negligence or lack of care on the\n\npart of the defendant and therefore dismisses the plaintiff’s\n\nclaim.\n\nthe judgment was then concluded\n\nUK Cases\n\nGlasgow Corporation v Muir\n\nHouse of Lords [1943] 2 All ER 44\n\nLORD MACMILLAN: . . .\n\nMy Lords, the degree of care for the safety of others which the law requires human beings to observe in the conduct of their affairs varies according to the circumstances. There is no absolute standard, but it may be said generally that the degree of care required varies directly with the risk involved. Those who engage in operations inherently dangerous must take precautions which are not required of persons engaged in the ordinary routine of daily life. It is no doubt true that in every act which an individual performs there is present a potentiality of injury to others. All things are possible and, indeed, it has become proverbial that the unexpected always happens. But while the precept alterum non laedere requires us to abstain from intentionally injuring others, it does not impose liability for every injury which our conduct may occasion. In Scotland, at any rate, it has never been a maxim of the law that a man acts at his peril. Legal liability is limited to those consequences of our acts which a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence and experience so acting would have in contemplation . . .\n\nThe standard of foresight of the reasonable man is in one sense an impersonal test. It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question. Some persons are by nature unduly timorous and imagine every path beset with lions; others, of more robust temperament, fail to foresee or nonchalantly disregard even the most obvious dangers. The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over-apprehension and from over-confidence. But there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable man involves in its application a subjective element. It is still left to the judge to decide what in the circumstances of the particular case the reasonable man would have had in contemplation and what accordingly the party sought to be made liable ought to have foreseen. Here there is room for diversity of view, as, indeed, is well illustrated in the present case. What to one judge may seem far-fetched may seem to another both natural and probable.\n\n. . . The question, as I see it, is whether Mrs Alexander, when she was\n\nasked to allow a tea urn to be brought into the premises under her charge, ought to have had in mind that it would require to be carried through a narrow passage in which there were a number of children and that there would be a risk of the contents of the urn being spilt and scalding some of the children. If as a reasonable person she ought to have had these considerations in mind, was it her duty to require that she should be informed of the arrival of the urn and, before allowing it to be carried through the narrow passage, to clear all the children out of it, in case they might be splashed with scalding water?\n\nThe urn was an ordinary medium-sized cylindrical vessel of about 15 ins. diameter and about 16 ins. in height, made of light sheet metal with a fitting lid, which was closed. It had a handle at each side. Its capacity was about 9\n\ngallons, but it was only a third or a half full It was not in itself an inherently dangerous thing and could be carried quite safely and easily by two persons exercising ordinary care. A caterer, called as a witness on behalf of the pursuers, who had large experience of the use of such urns, said that he had never had a mishap with an urn while it was being carried. The urn was in charge of two responsible persons, McDonald, the church officer, and the lad Taylor, who carried it between them. When they entered the passage-way they called out to the children there congregated to keep out of the way and the children drew back to let them pass. Taylor who held the front handle had safely passed the children when, for some unexplained reason, McDonald loosened hold of the other handle, the urn tilted over and some of its contents were spilt, scalding several of the children who were standing by. The urn was not upset but came to the ground on its base.\n\nIn my opinion, Mrs Alexander had no reason to anticipate that such an event would happen as a consequence of granting permission for a tea urn to be carried through the passage-way where the children were congregated, and consequently there was no duty incumbent on her to take precautions against the occurrence of such an event. I think that she was entitled to assume that the urn would be in charge of responsible persons (as it was) who would have regard for the safety of the children in the passage (as they did have regard) and that the urn would be carried with ordinary care, in which case its transit would occasion no danger to bystanders. The pursuers have left quite unexplained the actual cause of the accident. The immediate cause was not the carrying of the urn through the passage, but McDonald’s losing grip of his handle. How he came to do so is entirely a matter of speculation. He may\n\nhave stumbled or he may have suffered a temporary muscular failure. We do not know and the pursuers have not chosen to enlighten us by calling McDonald as a witness. Yet it is argued that Mrs Alexander ought to have foreseen the possibility, nay, the reasonable probability of an occurrence the nature of which is unascertained. Suppose that McDonald let go his handle through carelessness. Was Mrs Alexander bound to foresee this as reasonably probable and to take precautions against the possible consequences? I do not think so. The only ground on which the view of the majority of the judges of the first division can be justified is that Mrs Alexander ought to have foreseen that some accidental injury might happen to the children in the passage if she allowed an urn containing hot tea to be carried through the passage and ought, therefore, to have cleared out the children entirely during its transit, which Lord Moncrieff describes as ‘the only effective step’. With all respect I think that this would impose upon Mrs Alexander a degree of care higher than the law exacts. . . . As, in my opinion, no negligence has been established I agree with what I understand to be the view of all your Lordships that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Lord Ordinary restored.\n\nBolton v Stone\n\nHouse of Lords [1951] 1 All ER 1078\n\nLORD OAKSEY:\n\nCricket has been played for about ninety years on the ground in question and no ball has been proved to have struck anyone on the highways near the ground until the respondent was struck, nor has there been any complaint to the appellants. In such circumstances was it the duty of the appellants, who are the committee of the club, to take some special precautions other than those they did take to prevent such an accident as happened? The standard of care in the law of negligence is the standard of an ordinarily careful man, but, in my opinion, an ordinarily careful man does not take precautions against every foreseeable risk. He can, of course, foresee the possibility of many risks, but life would be almost impossible if he were to attempt to take precautions against every risk which he can foresee. He takes precautions against risks which are reasonably likely to happen. Many foreseeable risks are extremely unlikely to happen and cannot be guarded against except by almost complete isolation. The ordinarily prudent owner of a dog does not keep his dog always on a lead on a country highway for fear it may cause injury to a passing motor cyclist, nor does the ordinarily prudent pedestrian avoid the use of the highway for fear of skidding motor cars. It may very well be that after this accident the ordinarily prudent committee man of a similar cricket ground would take some further precaution, but that is not to say that he would have taken a similar precaution before the accident . . .\n\nLORD REID:\n\nrespondent might possibly occur during one of the appellants’ cricket matches. Balls had been driven into the public road from time to time, and it was obvious that if a person happened to be where a ball fell that person would receive injuries which might or might not be serious. On the other hand, it was plain that the chance of that happening was small. The exact number of times a ball has been driven into the road is not known, but it is not proved that this has happened more than about six times in about thirty years. If I assume that it has happened on the average once in three seasons I shall be doing no injustice to the respondent’s case. Then there has to be considered the chance of a person being hit by a ball falling in the road. The road appears to be an ordinary side road giving access to a number of private houses, and there is no evidence to suggest that the traffic on this road is other than what one might expect on such a road. On the whole of that part of the road where a ball could fall there would often be nobody and seldom any great number of people. It follows that the chances of a person ever being struck even in a long period of years was very small.\n\nThis case, therefore, raises sharply the question what is the nature and extent of the duty of a person who promotes on his land operations which may cause damage to persons on an adjoining highway. Is it that he must not carry out or permit an operation which he knows or ought to know clearly can cause such damage, however improbable that result may be, or is it that he is only bound to take into account the possibility of such damage if such damage is a likely or probable consequence of what he does or permits, or if the risk of damage is such that a reasonable man, careful of the safety of his neighbour, would regard that risk as material? I do not know of any case where this question has had to be decided or even where it has been fully discussed. Of course there are many cases in which somewhat similar questions have arisen, but, generally speaking, if injury to another person from the defendants’ acts is reasonably foreseeable the chance that injury will result is substantial and it does not matter in which way the duty is stated. In such cases I do not think that much assistance is to be got from analysing the language which a judge has used. More assistance is to be got from cases where judges have clearly chosen their language with care in setting out a principle, but even so, statements of the law must be read in light of the facts of the particular case. Nevertheless, making all allowances for this, I do find at least a tendency to base duty rather on the likelihood of damage to others than on its foreseeability alone . . . I think that reasonable men do, in fact,\n\ntake into account the degree of risk and do not act on a bare possibility as they would if the risk were more substantial . . .\n\nCounsel for the respondent in the present case had to put his case so high as to say that, at least as soon as one ball had been driven into the road in the ordinary course of a match, the appellants could and should have realised that that might happen again, and that, if it did, someone might be injured, and that that was enough to put on the appellants a duty to take steps to prevent such an occurrence. If the true test is foreseeability alone I think that must be so. Once a ball has been driven on to a road without there being anything extraordinary to account for the fact, there is clearly a risk that another will follow and if it does there is clearly a chance, small though it may be, that somebody may be injured. On the theory that it is foreseeability alone that matters it would be irrelevant to consider how often a ball might be expected to land in the road and it would not matter whether the road was the busiest street or the quietest country lane. The only difference between these cases is in the degree of risk. It would take a good deal to make me believe that the law has departed too far from the standards which guide ordinary careful people in ordinary life. In the crowded conditions of modern life even the most careful person cannot avoid creating some risks and accepting others. What a man must not do, and what I think a careful man tries not to do, is to create a risk which is substantial. Of course, there are numerous cases where special circumstances require that a higher standard shall be observed and where that is recognised by the law, but I do not think that this case comes within any such special category . . . In my judgment, the test to be applied here is whether the risk of damage to a person on the road was so small that a reasonable man in the position of the appellants, considering the matter from the point of view of safety, would have thought it right to refrain from taking steps to prevent the danger. In considering the matter I think that it would be right to take into account, not only how remote is the chance that a person might be struck, but also how serious the consequences are likely to be if a person is struck, but I do not think that it would be right to take into account the difficulty of remedial measures. If cricket cannot be played on a ground without creating a substantial risk, then it should not be played there at all. I think that this is in substance the test which Oliver J applied in this case. He considered whether the appellants’ ground was large enough to be safe for all practical purposes and held that it was. This is a question, not of law, but of fact and degree. It is not an easy question, and it is one on which opinions\n\nmay well differ. I can only say that, having given the whole matter repeated and anxious consideration, I find myself unable to decide this question in favour of the respondent. I think, however, that this case is not far from the borderline. If this appeal is allowed, that does not, in my judgment, mean that in every case where cricket has been played on a ground for a number of years without accident or complaint those who organise matches there are safe to go on in reliance on past immunity. I would have reached a different conclusion if I had thought that the risk here had been other than extremely small because I do not think that a reasonable man, considering the matter from the point of view of safety, would or should disregard any risk unless it is extremely small.\n\nThis case was also argued as a case of nuisance, but counsel for the respondent admitted that he could not succeed on that ground if the case on negligence failed. I, therefore, find it unnecessary to deal with the question of nuisance and I reserve my opinion as to what constitutes nuisance in cases of this character. In my judgment, the appeal should be allowed.\n\nThe Wagon Mound (No 2), Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd\n\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council [1966] UKPC 10, [1966] 2 All ER 709\n\nLORD REID: . . .\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of Walsh J,2 dated 10 October 1963, in the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Commercial Causes) by which he awarded to the respondents sums of £80,000 and £1,000 in respect of damage from fire sustained by their vessels, Corrimal and Audrey D, on 1 November 1951. These vessels were then at Sheerlegs Wharf, Morts Bay, in Sydney Harbour undergoing repairs. The appellant was charterer by demise of a vessel, the Wagon Mound, which in the early hours of 30 October 1951, had been taking in bunkering oil from Caltex Wharf not far from Sheerlegs Wharf. By reason of carelessness of the Wagon Mound engineers a large quantity of this oil overflowed from the Wagon Mound on to the surface of the water. Some hours later much of the oil had drifted to and accumulated round Sheerlegs Wharf and the respondents’ vessels. About 2 p.m. on 1 November this oil was set alight: the fire spread rapidly and caused extensive damage to the wharf and to the respondents’ vessels.\n\nAn action was raised against the present appellant by the owners of Sheerlegs Wharf on the ground of negligence. On appeal to the Board it was held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the ground that it was not foreseeable that such oil on the surface of the water could be set alight\n\n(Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd).3 Their lordships will refer to this case as the Wagon Mound (No. 1). The issue of\n\nnuisance was also raised but their lordships did not deal with it: they remitted this issue to the Supreme Court and their lordships now understand that the matter was not pursued there in that case.\n\nIn the present case the respondents sue alternatively in nuisance and in\n\nnegligence. Walsh J4 had found in their favour in nuisance but against them in negligence. Before their lordships the appellant appeals against his decision on nuisance and the respondents appeal against his decision on negligence. Their lordships are indebted to that learned judge for the full and\n\ncareful survey of the evidence which is set out in his judgment.5 Few of his findings of fact have been attacked, and their lordships do not find it necessary to set out or deal with the evidence at any length; but it is desirable to give some explanation of how the fire started before setting out the learned judge’s findings.\n\nIn the course of repairing the respondents’ vessels the Morts Dock Co, the owners of Sheerlegs Wharf, were carrying out oxy-acetylene welding and cutting. This work was apt to cause pieces or drops of hot metal to fly off and fall in the sea. So when their manager arrived on the morning of 30 October and saw the thick scum of oil round the Wharf, he was apprehensive of fire danger and he stopped the work while he took advice. He consulted the manager of Caltex Wharf and, after some further consultation, he was assured that he was safe to proceed: so he did so, and the repair work was carried on normally until the fire broke out on 1 November. Oil of this character with a flash point of 170°F is extremely difficult to ignite in the open; but we now know that that is not impossible. There is no certainty about how this oil was set alight, but the most probable explanation, accepted by Walsh J, is that there was floating in the oil-covered water some object supporting a piece of inflammable material, and that a hot piece of metal fell on it when it burned for a sufficient time to ignite the surrounding oil.\n\nThe findings of the learned trial judge are as follows:6\n\n`(i) Reasonable people in the position of the officers of the Wagon\n\nMound would regard furnace oil as very difficult to ignite on water. `OD Their personal experience would probably have been that this had\n\nvery rarely happened.\n\n`OH) If they had given attention to the risk of fire from the spillage, they would have regarded it as a possibility, but one which could become an actuality only in very exceptional circumstances.\n\n`(iv) They would have considered the chances of the required exceptional circumstances happening whilst the oil remained spread on the harbour waters, as being remote.\n\n`(v) I find that the occurrence of damage to property as a result of the spillage, was not reasonably foreseeable by those for whose acts would be responsible.\n\n`(vi) I find that the spillage of oil was brought about by the careless conduct of persons for whose acts [the appellant] would be responsible.\n\n`(vii) I find that the spillage of oil was a cause of damage to the property of each of .\n\n`(viii)Having regard to those findings, and because of finding (v), I hold that the claim of each of …. framed in negligence fails.’ .\n\nIt is now necessary to turn to the respondents’ submission that the trial judge was wrong in holding that damage from fire was not reasonably foreseeable.\n\nIn Wagon Mound (No. 1)7 the finding on which the Board proceeded was that of the trial judge:\n\n`. . . did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that oil was capable of being set afire when spread on water.’\n\nIn the present case the evidence led was substantially different from the\n\nevidence led in Wagon Mound (No. 1)8 and the findings of Walsh J9 are significantly different. That is not due to there having been any failure by the\n\nplaintiffs in Wagon Mound (No. 1)8 in preparing and presenting their case. The plaintiffs there were no doubt embarrassed by a difficulty which does not affect the present plaintiffs. The outbreak of the fire was consequent on the\n\nact of the manager of the plaintiffs in Wagon Mound (No. 1)8 in resuming oxy-acetylene welding and cutting while the wharf was surrounded by this oil. So if the plaintiffs in the former case had set out to prove that it was foreseeable by the engineers of the Wagon Mound that this oil could be set alight, they might have had difficulty in parrying the reply that then this must also have been foreseeable by their manager. Then there would have been contributory negligence and at that time contributory negligence was a complete defence in New South Wales.\n\nThe crucial finding of Walsh J1° in this case is in finding (v): that the\n\ndamage was ‘not reasonably foreseeable by those for whose acts the defendant would be responsible.’ That is not a primary finding of fact but an inference from the other findings, and it is clear from the learned judge’s judgment that in drawing this inference he was to a large extent influenced by his view of the law. The vital parts of the findings of fact which have already been set out in full are (i) that the officers of the Wagon Mound ‘would regard furnace oil as very difficult to ignite on water’—not that they would regard this as impossible: (ii) that their experience would probably have been `that this had very rarely happened’—not that they would never have heard of a case where it had happened, and\n\n(iii) that they would have regarded it as a ‘possibility, but one which could become an actuality only in very exceptional circumstances’—not, as in\n\nWagon Mound (No. 1),8 that they could not reasonably be expected to have known that this oil was capable of being set afire when spread on water. The question which must now be determined is whether these differences between the findings in the two cases do or do not lead to different results in law.\n\nIn Wagon Mound (No. 1)8 the Board were not concerned with degrees of foreseeability because the finding was that the fire was not foreseeable at all.\n\nSo Viscount Simondsil had no cause to amplify the statement that the `essential factor in determining liability is whether the damage is of such a kind as the reasonable man should have f"
