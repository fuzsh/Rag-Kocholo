        "text": "The following collection of gravestone inscriptions are to be found in the cemetery which surrounds St Mary’s (Church of Ireland) Church in Thurles, County Tipperary. Where posible, these inscriptions have been checked against ‘The Journal for the Preservation of the Memorials of the Dead,’ which are to be found in the Local Studies Dept. of Thurles Library. All the inscriptions below are incised.\n\nThe Church building itself is a comparatively modern building, early 1800, but evidently stands on the site of a much older one. This parish was impropriate in the Abbey of Owney, County of Limerick, and in 1202 Abbot Hugh mortgaged this church to Italian merchants. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was handed over to Walter Ap Howell, and after him to Pierce Walsh and his descendants.\n\nThe work of compiling these headstone inscriptions was painstakingly undertaken by Mr James Ryan, Dublin Road, Thurles, and it is the hope of ‘Hidden Tipperary’ that this information will be of some assistance to persons involved in tracing their family roots, here in Thurles, Co.Tipperary.\n\nThe numbers shown in brackets after each inscription refer to the position of that grave stone in the graveyard. Spellings have not been changed to the modern accepted spelling of names and any person consulting this record is advised to look for a name under every possible spelling.\n\nAnderson\n\nHere lies the body of John Anderson who died May the 15 1791 aged 78 years.
