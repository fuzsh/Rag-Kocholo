        "text": "Welcome to the Cork AUL hIstory page. This page is under construction so we would ask you to bear with us as we add the history information to the page. The following is is taken from Plunkett Carter’s 50 Years of the Cork Athletic Union Football League.\n\nHistory of\n\nThe Cork Athletic Union Football League\n\nThe Cork Athletic Union Football League (originally called The Cork City and County Athletic Union Junior League) was established in 1947 and in its first season had just four competitions for teams (teams also competed in the FAI Junior Cup area competition).\n\nThe winners of the competitions in that first historic season were as follows (there were originally just three competitions in the maiden season with the others organised by the MFA and the FAI):\n\n1st division: Mortonville (Cobh Ramblers);\n\nCity Challenge Cup : Prospect Rovers (Ballinlough Rovers)\n\nSaxone Cup: Western Rovers\n\nMiniature Cup: Maymount Rovers\n\nFAI Area Final: Western Rovers\n\nThe members of the first management committee elected were, Owen O’Keeffe (chairman); Jim Mullins (hon. secretary); Bill O’Brien (treasurer) with Jack McCarthy, Paddy Hennessy and Mick Millard on the Administrative Committee. Others who played parts in the running of the league were Sam Allen, Ted O’Regan and Dan Looney.\n\nThere is some confusion regarding the the amount of clubs that made up the Cork AUL for the first season (with anything from 8 to 14 being mentioned) but it is reliably now stated that 14 teams made up the league in that historic first season. The teams were, Maymount, Prospect Rovers, Mortonville, Grattan, Ballinllough, Clapton Celtic, Cobh Ramblers, Green Rovers, Blackrock, Mountview, Albert Rovers, Marine Services, Cork Sppinning and Ladyswell Brewery.\n\nSince then, the League has made significant progress and at one stage had in excess of 150 teams that participated in 28 competitions in Under-17, Youth and Junior grades.\n\nCork Corporation criticised (1975-76)\n\nThe Chairman of the Cork AUL, Donal Crowley, in the course of his address to delegates at the AGM, spoke in great detail of the problems which had to be faced because of lack of playing pitches. The 21 year lease on the Church Road grounds had expired on 31st December, 1974 and the League were given until July, 1976 to vacate the property. Mr Crowley hit hard at the Cork Corporation who were dragging their feet in providing playing facilities for the large number of people in the city who wanted to play soccer. Several months earlier it had been reported that three soccer pitches were being made available in the Lakelands district. This conveyed a false position as the grounds were not immediately available for soccer and it was doubtful if the land at Lakelands could ever be properly prepared to make suitable pitches. It was pointed out that, during 1974-75 alone, 484 matches had been played in the Church Road grounds.\n\nOnce again, the meeting was tinged with sadness as it marked the retirement of the long serving Treasurer, Gene Murphy. Words could not adequately convey the true value of the esteemed member’s contribution to the League during his 21 years’ association. Hon Secretary Denis Collins also signified his intention to step down but, in this case, his expertise would still be available as he was to continue as the League’s Press Officer. The AUL Management line-up for the 1975-76 season was: D Crowley, Chairman/Hon Treas; V Cummins, Hon Sec; F Dorgan, Fix Sec; P Barry, Reg. Committee; J O’Sullivan, T Fitzgerald, S Casey, D O’Driscoll, W Murphy and D Collins. Midway through the season Hon Secretary Vince Cummins resigned and was replaced by Finbarr Dorgan.\n\nMFA fury\n\nPlans for the Inter Provincial tournament, on which National Coach John Jarman placed so much emphasis. were snubbed by the MFA who decided not to compete as a protest against the lack of representation in the previous year on the Republic of Ireland Youths’ team after Munster had won the inaugural event held in Limerick. They were furious at the scant recognition received and blasted that they were no longer willing to make up the numbers. Not all in local football were supportive of the MFA’s stance. Paul O’Donovan, manager of Cork Celtic, said that he did not accept that a committee should deprive any boy of the chance to play for his country, a statement which was endorsed by Cork Examiner columnist Billy George. That was not the only front on which soccer legislators in the South differed with the powers that be, as the Cork AUL refused to enter the National Inter League competitions because the previous term’s Youth competition had not been concluded. Cork, the holders of the trophy, had qualified for the semi-final months earlier and had been left kicking their heels. awaiting a decision by the FAI on the arrangements.\n\nThe AUL, who had been for many years, enviously casting their eyes towards the MFA Disciplinary Committee (who fined and censured players sent off in AUL competitions), successfully tabled an amendment to rule at the MFA’s AGM. held in Waterford. This enabled all leagues to administer their own disciplinary affairs.\n\nEvergreen returned after a year’s “holiday” and Youghal were represented in junior soccer by St Martin’s Utd: Fr Murphy’s YC made their debut in that grade also. Newcomers welcomed were Glenview, Farnanes, Little Island, Blackrock Celtic, Sunbeam, St Anne’s, Lisavaird, Ballinspittle, Glounthaune and South View Ath. Farewells were tendered to AIB, CIE Bus, Kingfisher, Standard, Ballydaly, St Patrick’s and Ballyphehane Athletic.\n\nRockmount graduate\n\nRockmount’s youths, winners of the 2nd Div double in ’73, remained together as a group and, during the 1974-75 season, which for many was their first taste of junior, served notice of impending success. Yet, the graduation was speedier and more fruitful than anticipated, beginning with a thrilling win over St Mary’s in a classic Premier Shield decider at Church Road. The titanic struggle was only decided in injury time when a super Robert Stephens’ goal gave Rockmount a 3-2 victory. In defeat, Mary’s were as glorious as in any of their successes in the past, playing the entire second half with ten men as defender Edward Healy was sent off in the 43rd minute. Seconds earlier Fergus McDaid had pulled back a goal for Mary’s who had fallen two behind as early as the 25th minute. Rockmount got off to a blistering start with a 5th minute Paddy O’Connor goal which was stretched, twenty minutes later, by Aidan O’Mahony. Vince Marshall who made it level pegging soon after the resumption and it then looked as though the Mount would be swept away in a tidal wave of Mary’s attacks until Stephens’ priceless strike. The many important clashes between these northside giants dominated the junior soccer calendar. They shared the points after a thrilling top of the table league clash in April which left Rockmount, who had played two games less, trailing Mary’s by just two points. Rockmount had to come from behind, twice, to salvage a point against Castleview and set themselves up for a championship winning tie against Casement by defeating Mallow in the penultimate game. On Wednesday May 19th, they survived many scares from a gallant Casement side which made them pull out all the stops before eventually capitulating to the champions-elect on a 5-3 scoreline.\n\nForm worked out amazingly well and Rockmount and Mary’s crossed swords again in the FAI Junior Cup Area final. Mary’s were comfortable 4-1 winners over Castleview in a semi-final marred by four sending offs – two from each side. At the same time, Rockmount were again grateful to Robert Stephens who stepped in with a dramatic late winner to down brave Hillington in the other semi-final. The League’s top sides could only provide one goal between them after 200 minutes of nervous endeavour in the decider and Denis Lahive’s golden goal gave Rockmount custody of the President’s Cup. Cork soccer followers were becoming accustomed to Leeside failures in this elusive competition so, it was no surprise to learn that the quest for the Holy Grail was still to continue after Rockmount’s defeat by Dún Laoghaire Celtic in the 7th round.\n\nRecord fifth AOH for Castleview\n\nSt Mary’s still retained hopes of salvaging something from a frustrating season and were the bookmakers’ favourites to equal Castleview’s record of four AOH Cup victories. In fact the League got the crowd pulling final they craved for when Castleview became Mary’s opponents in the show-piece decider after the other 106 teams had been eliminated. At Turner’s Cross, before a large crowd, the View upset predictions when scoring an extremely fortunate 1-0 win over the holders with a Cyril Kavanagh goal seven minutes from time. The victors were fortunate in that, when their keeper Jim Cambridge was penalised for kicking an opposing player in the penalty area, Vince Marshall sent him the wrong way with his spot kick but had the agony of seeing the shot come back off the post. Referee Pat Kelly sent off Castleview’s Walter McCarthy during the closely contested tie. Castleview: J Cambridge, D Devereaux, M Caulfield, T Kennefick, C Lynch, D Bennett, B Mulcahy, W McCarthy, J Devereaux, J O’Brien and C Kavanagh. Sub: E King.\n\nCasement refused to play\n\nCastleview, it seemed, were heading for a disappointing season prior to that success, and even greater riches were in store when they crowned it all with an unexpected Munster Junior Cup win. Greenmount proudly flew the Cork flag in the open rounds, and did the spade work for others when travelling to Limerick and inflicting on Ballynanty their first defeat of the year, thanks to a Harry Speight goal in extra time. They then put Geraldines to the sword and were coasting to a 2-0 victory over Castleview until a dramatic collapse allowed the View to scrape into the final. Castleview, who were never ones to look a gift horse in the mouth, made the most of their previous good fortunate and strolled to a comfortable 2-0 win over Janesboro in the final at Turner’s Cross with a brace of goals from Johnny “Dev”. Sadly, the Munster Minor Cup final was not played and Wembley Rovers (Limerick) were awarded the trophy after the holders Casement Celtic refused to play the refixed final at Priory Park. The dispute arose, originally, when Casement were not willing to fulfil the fixture initially scheduled for Turner’s Cross on May 30th, as they only became aware of the scheduling through the Evening Echo on the night before. In the semi-final, Casement had whipped St Michael’s 8-1 at Turner’s Cross. It was hoped that a victory in Munster would have provided ideal compensation for a narrow defeat at the hands of the classy Cambridge Boys in the semi-final of the FAI Minor Cup at Richmond Park. Casement’s national and provincial priorities affected their domestic trophy hunt and they ended, like Old Mother Hubbard with a bare cupboard as Tramore, Crofton, Tower, Crosshaven and Springfield shared the local honours.\n\nIt was encouraging to see such a nice geographical trophy spread which would have been even wider had Fermoy, the season’s surprise packets, maintained the early form which saw them lead the elite group for long periods. However, championship specialists Tramore finished very strongly and relegated Rockmount and Fermoy to second and third places respectively. The Turner’s Cross team finished runners-up to Tower who took the Wrixon Shield when beating Fermoy 2-0 in. In the 2nd Div Shield final, two second half goals gave the Danny Cronin managed Springfield a 2-0 victory over Passage Utd. Starring for “Springers” were Liam Naughton, Shane Fitzgerald and Joe Stack while promising youngsters in the Passage camp included Timmy Holloway, John Herlihy, Edmund Farr, Brendan Murphy and his nephew Stephen Russell. Crosshaven did not have an anxious moment as they trounced section B winners St Martin’s 7-0 in the Youths 2nd Div League decider when their haul was shared by Colm Moore (3), Dom Hayes (2) and John Mulcahy (2). Fermoy, who held fancied Crofton to a scoreless draw in a thrilling Murphy Cup final, had high hopes of finishing the job on their own ground but the big crowd brought the best out of the city team who took the coveted trophy 2-0 with goals from Alan Cremin and Christy Kelleher.\n\n“The Dav” in East Cork\n\nThe big news, as the season began in August, was Killeagh’s signing of the flamboyant, dazzling, former English and League of Ireland star Carl Davenport. “The Dav” certainly gave the east Cork team their money’s worth when netting goals galore in a scoring bonanza that captured the attention of soccer followers everywhere. He began with a debut four-timer against Everton and made it ten for the first three games. The going got tougher as opponents admired less and marked more tightly but, nonetheless, he continued to hit the target and accounted for half of Killeagh’s total. All this scoring went unrewarded and it was Killeagh’s neighbours Fr Murphy’s YC, in their maiden season (who had an even more impressive strike rate and a watertight defence) who successfully flew the east Cork flag in the 2nd Div Shield final when defeating 4th Battalion. Familiar figures on the Fr Murphy’s team were Denis Mulcahy, Mick Kirby, Paudie Foley, Jack Daly, Johnny Barry, Deccie Barry and Gerard O’Brien. They narrowly failed in a double bid when giving best to Ballincollig by the odd goal in five after a thrilling 2nd Div League final replay at Turner’s Cross. Ballincollig, who won the Div 3 award the previous term, owed much to prolific scorer Frank Condon and consistent players Brian Gaffney, Martin Hogan, Mick McNulty and Sean Fitton. In a battle of the satellite towns, Ballincollig took the County Cup in a penalty shoot-out(4-3) after finishing 2-2 with Carrigaline, in Clonakilty..\n\nDinny “Pop’s” reward\n\nThere were emotional scenes at Church Road when Grattan defeated Mayfield 2-1 in the3rd Div Shield final. This was the result everyone (except Mayfield) wanted as Grattan had been members since 1947 without ever having won a trophy. If ever a man deserved his hour of triumph it was Grattan supremo Dinny “Pop” O’Neill, who persevered when all others despaired. Grattan looked odds-on to complete the double but Togher also planned to party and it was they who did all the singing after a great 2-1 victory was assured through goals from Alex Crowley and Liam O’Sullivan. Tramore and Temple produced a 1st Div Shield final of high drama. Here, the highlight of a breathtaking finish was a daring save by Tramore keeper Teddy McGarry (incidentally, he lost several teeth in the process) which enabled his side to retain the 2-1 interval lead and paved the way for a magnificent triumph engineered by Pat Goggin and Mattie Brett. Temple’s better players were Ned O’Leary, Tim McCarthy, Lar Leahy and Anthony Ricken. Tramore were another team to fail in a double bid as the hard summer surface favoured the younger Wolf Tones eleven who had a comfortable 3-0 victory in the league final. Micky Dennehy’s boys had earlier captured the O’Keeffe Cup when Eddie Cotter’s solitary goal was enough to deprive Glenvale. UCC Academicals, who were founded by Ger Canning in 1971, became the first college team in 23 years to reach a local final when qualifying for the Saxone decider against Dillon’s Cross. Despite their tender years the Freshers were still installed as favourites and not surprisingly, since in their ranks were a host of students who later formed the nucleus of some of the University’s better teams including Brendan Manley, Carl O’Connell, Shay Daly and Kieran Dunlea. The boys of Dillon’s Cross had a few bob on the result and the winnings, collected after their 2-0 victory paid for the Sunday night celebrations up at the “Cross”. There to enjoy the occasion were the stars who gave the students a free football lesson: Timmy Murphy, Liam King, Richie Cahill, Nick Heffernan, Pat Horgan and Jimmy Callaghan.\n\nDuring September, the representatives of 140 AUL teams were given the outline plans of a scheme designed to provide playing pitches and a solid financial base, for the League and clubs. The plans, drawn up by Stephen Collins, (Chairman of Killeagh AFC), centred on the Arcadia being transformed into a Sports and Social Headquarters for the AUL and its clubs. A special draw was to be organised to get the scheme off the ground and it was hoped to be opened for its new use in early November. The first-fund raiser was a big dance night at the Arcadia, the ad for which is reproduced below. Very little was heard of the plans afterwards; the draw was cancelled as guarantees were not possible due to the fact that it was a joint operation involving the League and promoters.\n\nMore difficult to enter (1976-77)\n\nNew clubs seeking admission to membership of the League, now had to provide a ground over which they had sole control on match days and, also, were required to pay an entry fee of £30 (juniors) or £10 (youths). The entrance fee for existing clubs remained at £14 and £7. The expiry of the lease on the League’s grounds at Church Road was clearly behind the drafting of those new rules as they (the League) were, soon afterwards, to face the problem of providing for the teams in their membership without pitches. Mindful of the cost to clubs of having to post all registration forms separately a concessionary alteration was made to rule nine, allowing them to register players on a master form up to July 31st, The only amendment to rule to come from outside the management committee was Dunbar’s adopted proposal that two substitutes be allowed in all competitions under the jurisdiction of the League. Major news, as the season began, was that the shield had been replaced by league cup competitions for which several new trophies were donated and titled as follows: Tom O’Kelly Premier Div League Cup; Mall Tavern 1st Div; Quinlan 2nd Div; Dunlop Employees’ Social Club 3rd Div; Coca Cola Youths 1st Div; CMP Youths 2nd Div. It was also agreed that all league competitions would be double round affairs. Vince Cummins, who was co-opted onto the management committee at the AGM, was restored to his former position as League Secretary at the first meeting of the new committee, while former Chairman Donal Crowley, who addressed the delegates at the AGM in June, did not seek re-election and resigned after a few short, but productive, years. The management committee in place at the commencement of the season was Chairman, W Murphy; Vice-Chairman & Fixtures Sec, F Dorgan; Hon Sec, V Cummins; Treasurer, D O’Driscoll; Registrar, P Barry; Disciplinary Sec, T Fitzgerald; Minute Sec, J O’Sullivan. Comm: N Sheehan, G Keating and S Casey.\n\nBallyphehane side Kilreen Celtic and Park Utd (Mitchelstown) made their debuts as Youghal returned to junior soccer again which with the entry of Sarsfield brought the seaside town’s representation to three. Others in, to briefly sample the AUL menu were, Gunners (Ballincollig), Newcastle, Sunberry, Croaghta Rangers and Lisgriffin. Glasheen were, surprisingly, not among the 106 entries (did return the following year) and also absenting were Examiner, Capwell Rovers, Blackrock Celtic, Glounthaune and Ballinspittle. Premier League champions Rockmount decided to step up to senior ranks.\n\nLeague Cups a refreshing change\n\nThe knock-out league cup competitions resulted in early decisions on trophy destinations with a welcome gap between finals, easing the hectic end of season scramble for the Turner’s Cross venue. Hillington began in style and became the first holders of the Tom O’Kelly Premier League Cup when Tom McCarthy’s solitary strike was enough to give them victory over Tramore in a tense final. Incidentally, in the course of the season, Hillington found it necessary to issue a statement through the AUL notes to stifle claims of rough play which were unfairly levelled at them. I remember Hillington not even as a Wimbledon type team, but as a classy ball playing outfit who often perished as a result of their total reliance on the finer arts. Hillington’s classy outfit included the Bickerstaffe’s, O’Rourke’s, Paddy Fahy, Dave Lawless, Martin Cashman, Terry McSweeney, Philip Browne, Sean Dennehy, Ger O’Connell, Richard O’Donoughue and Billy Grainger. The Youths League Cups provided a double-decker promotion at Flower Lodge with the Mayfield v Wilton Ath, 2nd Div decider being the better of two wonderful matches which were a great fillip for underage followers. Jimmy Howard’s solitary strike in the curtain-raiser was sufficient to give Mayfield their first ever AUL success in five final appearances and thereby rewarded the enterprising tactics adopted by their joint managers, Mick Murphy and Tadhg O’Neill. Avondale were also celebrating for the very first time when beating Wilton Utd 2-0 in the Coca Cola final. Donal O’Shea’s great 35 yard pile-driver, which left the Wilton keeper helpless, was calculated to inspire, and Pat Horgan made it number two to complete a joy day for young managers Shane O’Neill and Dave McAllen. Big time manager Tony “Tucker” Allen was at the helm to steer Avondale to an exciting 4-2 victory, after extra time, over Crofton Celtic in the Mall Tavern 1st Div Cup. Jim Cahill gave Crofton a half-time lead which was cancelled out by Dave O’Brien shortly after the resumption. The pendulum swung Crofton’s way again when Mick O’Leary put through his own goal but Alan O’Driscoll came to the rescue with a cracking equaliser which ensured extra time. Avondale piled on the pressure during this period with the inspiring O’Driscoll providing the cross for Gene Buckley to head them into the lead and John Turner wrapped it up when adding number four. Apart from O’Driscoll, Mick O’Leary and Paudie Flaherty caught the eye for the victors while Crofton had stars in Dave Mahon, Brendan Murphy and Ger Keane.\n\nIn November, the announcement of the resignation of Finbarr Dorgan, one of the most able administrators in soccer, was a bitter blow for the League. Tony Fitzgerald took over Finbarr’s role of Fixtures Secretary. Matches arranged for Number One ground, Church Road were cancelled while a subsidence was being repaired. It was not all bad news however, as the AUL were given three new pitches in Churchfield (now Knocknaheeny Parks) and the temporary use of two more at Dunne’s Park, Blackrock.\n\nOfficers and gentlemen\n\nThe refreshing new league cups continued to provide great excitement and the Quinlan final was no exception as the warriors of Garda and Grattan provided rich entertainment. The Garda squad, built at “enormous” expense, was a compilation of officers and gentlemen (civilians). The officers were led by Teddy Holland while the gentlemen, who were under the baton of Donie Leahy, had in their ranks Ray Cowhie, Charlie O’Mahony, John Clifford and Tedser Healy. The lead changed hands twice before Garda emerged victorious by the odd goal in five. Veteran Donie Leahy showed he had not lost his goal scoring touch when shooting Garda into an early lead, which drew an immediate response from Grattan who struck back with the perfect smash and grab: a Georgie Murphy equaliser followed by a converted Paul Lynch penalty. On the stroke of half-time that man Leahy struck again and, as the evenly contested second half looked destined to end in stalemate, Tedser Healy, who was constantly on the beat around Grattan territory goaled to enable the boys in blue to lift the silverware.\n\n108 goals in 21 games\n\nThe 2nd Div League final threw up a fascinating all Forces final, between Garda and the Army, the outcome of which hinged on the striking power of respective centre forwards Teddy Holland and Junior Murphy. Holland was the league’s top scorer with over fifty goals in the bag but he was outgunned by the brilliant Murphy whose hat trick highlighted a memorable game, won 3-1 by the Army. Garda, who in March were credited with having accumulated 108 goals in 21 games, shrugged off that league final disappointment by capturing the O’Keeffe Cup on their third final appearance of the year when the crafty Donie Leahy’s lone goal was just enough to overcome battling Northvilla after an excellent replay. The thrilling first meeting, which ended 2-2, will be remembered by most as a result of a broken leg injury sustained by brave Northvilla keeper Liam Dennehy. The Army were anxious to emulate their Garda friends in completing an AUL double and marched to the Saxone final with lofty ambitions. However, pride took a fall when they were ambushed by crafty St Mary’s Utd who won a pulsating game 4-3. Just one week earlier the sides had shared eight goals in a league thriller and, in anticipation of a repeat performance, the crowds flocked to the ’Cross. Mary’s twice opened up a two goal lead and each time 4th Battalion rallied to get back on terms but the unquenchable spirit of the Saints prevailed as Kevin O’Leary grabbed his second – and the trophy winning seventh – goal in the 83rd minute of another exhilarating encounter. Liam Hawkins, whose mastery over Junior Murphy was one of the deciding factors in Mary’s triumph, collected his fifth Saxone medal. Kevin Murphy and Noel Delea were also on the scoresheet for the Saints. Mick Downey, Mick Green and Junior Murphy were the trio who hit the target for the losers. For the second week in succession, Mayfield had something to celebrate.as, following on their youths victory at Flower Lodge, the third division juniors travelled across the city to Turner’s Cross and defeated Glenview 2-0 in the Dunlop final. Skipper Michael Flaherty had the only goal of the opening half and Sean Long netted the second after the interval. It was a major disappointment for Glenview who created a big surprise in beating Fr Murphy’s 5-3 in the semi-final with the help of goals from Dave Buckley (3), Sean O’Keeffe and Frank O’Flynn each. Glenview’s consistency went unrewarded, when once more disappointing on the big occasion, as they failed to produce their glittering section winning form when comprehensively beaten 4-1 by Sunbeam in the 3rd Div League decider. The highlight of this game was an excellent Lynch hat trick for Sunbeam for whom Sean O’Neill was also on the mark.\n\nCastleview and Crofton take titles\n\nCrofton’s disappointing junior season in 1975-76 was attributed to their amalgamation with the Crofton Senior League side to which the bulk of the key players moved. In the intervening twelve months, another batch of youngsters had come off the youth team conveyor belt and they were a force again, evidenced by a 2-1 Div 1 League final win over Bohemians at Turner’s Cross. Alan Cremin, so impressive in underage football, graduated in style and netted both scores for the Crofton “freshers”. The winter season, with its customary quagmire surfaces, brought Casement’s unbeaten premier league run to an abrupt end and, when the grounds once more became conducive to good football, a revival began. The championship race, until then dominated by the northside giants Castleview and St Mary’s, now became open again.The Ballyphehane boys dealt Mary’s hopes a fatal blow, and improved their own prospects, when John Downey’s lone goal decided a crucial tie. Castleview took a giant step towards the title, and severely dented Casement’s fading challenge, as Frankie Thornton hammered home that game’s only score. Two points were now all that was required to clinch the title and Hillington seemed to have delayed the Gurranabraher team’s celebrations when they led them 2-0 in the penultimate tie with just fifteen minutes left on the clock. Champions are made of stern stuff, and Castleview showed they possessed the right ingredients when, with a mighty effort, they not alone drew level with Hillington but conquered them in the dying seconds of a memorable game.\n\nFive for O’Driscoll\n\nTony Allen’s astute coaching paid dividends as glamour club Avondale trounced Celtic with devastating ease in the FAI Junior Area final at a packed Parkhead (Rochestown). Celtic gambled on the fitness of former Coventry and Cork Celtic star Tommy O’Brien who, apart from one brilliant strike which came back off the crossbar, was anonymous. Talk before the game centred on O’Brien. However, at the final whistle there was only one name on everyone’s lips, that was Alan O’Driscoll, the Avondale wizard who hit five of his side’s goals in the 6-2 romp, with Michael O’Leary completing the tally. Veteran Paddy O’Regan netted both the losers’ scores in a game during which little blame could be attached to Liam McSweeney, John Tighe and Liam Ahern who tried hard to stem the Avondale tide. The ’Dale prepared in style and lunched in Blarney prior to their 7th round tie with Whitehall at Flower Lodge, where they experienced the same fate as countless Leeside predecessors who exited once the open stage was reached.\n\nRecord Gate\n\nThe biggest prize in Cork junior soccer still remained to be won and Avondale’s clash in the AOH Cup final with St Mary’s captured the attention of the sporting mad city. Scoreless draws at this level rarely satisfy and the sides first meeting at a packed Turner’s Cross was not an exception to the rule, the talking point being the dismissal of a player from each side by referee Eddie McGeough. Tony O’Sullivan (Avondale) and John Healy (St Mary’s ) were the pair that walked. Friday night, June 3rd was a glorious summer’s night providing a perfect setting befitting junior soccer’s biggest occasion: two of the League’s top teams in opposition for a most coveted prize and a record crowd to watch it all. I watched the match in the company of Coventry City’s Irish scout, Bunny Fullam, who was dispatched from Dublin to run the rule over an Avondale youngster. This former League of Ireland great was amazed at the massive attendance which he reckoned was the biggest he had ever seen for a junior tie. The gate receipts returned were approximately £2,000. He was equally impressed with the standard of football and was enthralled by the Cork colloquialism and wit experienced on the packed terrace.\n\nSt Mary’s, by scoring twice in a five minute spell between the fifteenth and twentieth minute, laid the platform which enabled them go on and win the trophy for a fifth time. They played with great conviction and there was a determination about their performance which was sadly lacking in their opponents. The Avondale defence was breached when Liam King headed Declan Geaney’s free kick to the net. Five minutes later, the Avondale offside trap misfired and Sean Murphy was allowed run on and lob the stranded Adrian Ryan to make it 2-0. There was more urgency about Avondale’s play on the resumption but very early on they lost Tony O’Sullivan who, together with Edward Healy (St Mary’s), was sent off. O’Sullivan, as noted above, was also dismissed by the same referee in the drawn game which must surely be a record of sorts. Avondale were afforded a number of scoring opportunities but their finish was deplorable. In this match, Vincie Marshall and John Healy starred for the winners who were also delighted with the performance of Irish Youth International Finbarr Murphy. On the Avondale side, Michael O’Leary was at his brilliant best. The rest were very much out of touch but one had to give credit to John Turner and Donal O’Shea for their wholehearted effort.\n\nTramore lose in Dublin\n\nCork were assured of a representation in the FAI Minor Cup final when Tramore and Casement were paired together in the semi-final. One had to have sympathy for Casement on the day as no team could have lived with Tramore who produced a dazzling exhibition of football on the way to a 5-1 victory. Joe O’Connell was an inspiring captain for the winners who had other stars in the goalscorers Barry Walsh (2), Robbie Cuthbert (2) and Tommy Walsh. Tom Hennebry, Dave Keating and scorer Toss McCarthy did best for the losers. Tramore Athletic were lucky to survive against the classy Cambridge Boys (Dublin),who had ten of the previous season’s winning squad on duty, in the final at Flower Lodge. The Dubliner’s comprehensive 4-0 victory in the replay did not come as a great surprise to those who witnessed the scoreless match in Cork. Tramore: B Cahill, F Drummond, J Lane, K Buckley, P Quigley, R Cuthbert, T Walsh, J O’Connell, B.Walsh, S Gould and L Hedderman. Subs: Twomey, Kerrigan. Tramore eased over their most difficult hurdle when defeating challengers Casement 2-0 on the way to retaining the premier youths championship. Then, they saw off the determined challenge of 2nd Div Ballincollig as they took the Murphy Cup on a 2-0 scoreline. Ballincollig showed qualities in defeat which would soon put silverware in their trophy cabinet and they did not have long to wait to claim that honour as they defeated gallant Passage 2-1 after extra-time in the 2nd Div League final at a packed Farranlea Road. Goals from Thomas Hogan and Frank Donovan were the cause of the jubilation and pandemonium when the final whistle was blown.\n\nFew had ever heard of Norton Celtic, who hailed from the Lough district, until their Munster Minor Cup exploits caught readers’ attention on the AUL notes. A semi-final victory over Crosshaven at Turner’s Cross really made people take notice and the minnows carried everyone’s best wishes into the final against Fairview (Limerick). The entire Norton team had another twelve months in youths football and, though beaten 4-1 in the final, they were a credit to their mentors. Liam Keane got the consolation score and those to catch the eye were Dave Cronin, Sean Long, Rory Sheehan, Ger Madden and Michael Bruton.\n\nJoy short lived\n\nThere was a controversial finish to the County Cup campaign when rank outsiders Skibbereen Dynamoes created a sensation when journeying to St Colman’s Park and handsomely defeated the locals 4-2 much to the delight of their chanting followers. Unfortunately, Alan O’Brien, whose two goals had them nicely placed at half-time, was formerly on Ramblers books and did not officially transfer. Cobh’s protest was upheld and a replay ordered at a city venue. Skibb’s supporters were again in great voice, and had plenty of reason to sing as their heroes enjoyed the lion’s share of a thriller which ended in a 4-4 deadlock. However, their disappointment was great after a 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat. James Nolan, James Hegarty and Brendan Terry all scored and shone brightest for the gallant losers. Mick McGee (2), Moss Mellerick and Con Brierley hit the target for Cobh. The Ramblers’ opponents in the final were Fr Murphy’s who were favoured with a home venue. Ger Brennan gave Cobh the lead in the 25th minute. Shortly after the resumption, Fr Murphy’s switched their goalkeeper Paudie Foley to centre forward in an effort to save the game but the plan backfired when in the 65th minute sub Billy Keogh added a decisive second goal for Ramblers, who were well worth their win after a scrappy encounter. Ramblers’ twenty year wait to win an AUL trophy had come to an end and the victorious squad, captained by Terry Sheally, had a wee celebration in Cobh that night. Now that Cork had opted out of the Oscar Traynor Trophy, greater importance was attached to the Tayto Cup challenge against the Dublin AUL which was won 1-0 by the visitors at Turner’s Cross. Cork AUL panel: J Scanlon, A Ryan, E Healy, M Caulfield, M Morrison, D Bennett, L King, P Healy, T Healy, J O’Callaghan, D Mahon, V Marshall, J Healy, B Mulcahy, A O’Driscoll and J Murphy. Two AUL players, Ger Spillane (Mallow) and Brendan Mulcahy (Castleview), were selected on the Irish team for a match against Wales for which John Healy (St Mary’s) was designated the travelling reserve.\n\nChurch Road RIP\n\nThe end of that season marked the AUL’s departure from Church Road and officials, players and supporters, all united in expressing sadness at its passing. During the League’s tenancy at the “sacred” venue it is estimated that over 6,000 games were played there. Is it any wonder that there was not a blade of grass on any of the four pitches? What surprised many was the fact that people actually mourned its passing even though at least three of the pitches would probably fail a standard inspection by any grounds committee. Without them, junior soccer in Cork would never have survived and their contribution to the nostalgic reminisces of older stars can never be understated. Even for relatively young clubs, those founded in the seventies who have since sampled football at venues all over the county, Church Road is always fondly remembered. Writing in Mayfield Utd’s Silver Jubilee book, Joe Kennedy said “Our fondest memories are of Church Road. This was a unique venue, the Mecca of football then. The atmosphere was something special and never since replicated. From here, the AUL grounds moved to Blackrock and finally to the Mahon peninsula. All had their own atmosphere but none encapsulated the uniqueness of Church Road.” Very true! However, not all agreed with these sentiments. In the UCC publication ‘At Least We Won The Toss’, a contributor wrote “Church Road was Cork’s answer to Wembley Stadium, and was then receiving the kind of attention normally reserved for underdeveloped, Third World countries. Incidentally, playing in the AUL at Church Road, one’s thoughts were usually on the next world and not the Third World!” Perhaps it is appropriate here to include an extract from “Cork Soccer Memories” on the closure of the grounds.\n\nCHURCH ROAD MEMORIES\n\nSad news, which would tug at the heart strings of thousands of AUL soccer enthusiasts, was the closure of their headquarters’ grounds at Church Road. It was a venue which provided the basis for stimulating stories and was the arena in which, with great trepidation, countless stars tried out their first pair of football boots. Many recall the day a section of number one pitch collapsed and the game continued regardless, others talk of the sea of mud which was a regular feature of winter football. I, myself, remember the day a streaker ransacked the dressing rooms, having earlier retired injured after pulling a muscle and limping towards the showers. But my abiding memory of the sacred venue was of an AUL second division match on Number 2 pitch when (I think) we were playing Boher. Centre forward for Greenmount on the day was Pat Murphy, a real tearaway, a trier true and true. Pat was being held in a vicelike grip by a clever centre half and our enlightened selectors shouted instructions to Pat to switch to outside left, (why is it if you are playing badly it’s always to outside left you are moved?). Pat ran towards the sideline to confirm the change and as he returned to action he saw the Boher centre half chase the ball inside his own half. True to form, Pat, who never gave up, tore off in pursuit and quickly robbed the startled defender before carrying the ball forward with some part of his anatomy – his chest, his stomach or his shin bone – before hitting a daisy cutter past the keeper, who did not even move, to the corner of the net. Pat gave his customary leap of joy and then, in his well practised victory manoeuvre, pirouetted gracefully and raised his right arm aloft with his index finger pointing towards the clouds (shades of Denis Law). But then, sensing some absurd infringement (no one rushed forward to hug him), he ran towards the referee who had a grin as wide as the goalmouth. “Are yeh gone mad, man”, roared Pat “I couldn’t have been offside.” “You weren’t son,” replied the ref “you were playing with the wrong ball – that ball just came in over the ditch from Number 3 pitch.” Happy days!\n\n“Eusebio” at Church Road\n\nMost of us have memories of tough games, high scoring thrillers, certain goalmouth incidents when balls went through the nets and were given as wides by blinkered refs and, of course, sending offs. Almost everyone seems to remember being sent for an early shower at Church Road. I recall reading of a smarty pants student who, when asked for his name by ref Nedser Cotter, replied “Eusebio”! “Right, Eusebio, take a walk to the dressing room and wipe the black off your face” snapped Ned. I also remember taking a penalty kick on a snow covered Number 1 ground and promptly planting the ball in the back of the net. The keeper complained at not having been able to see the white ball on account of the snow (of course he was not serious) so in the spirit of the occasion, I shouted to our trainer and asked him if he could spare one of the half-time oranges in order I could do it all over again. Within seconds, a beautiful jaffa orange was thrown in and the keeper rather belatedly, showed his expertise by plucking it out of the sky with one hand before offering to share it with the referee who, luckily, was in cheerful mood it being almost Christmas Eve.\n\nA day at headquarters\n\nFor those with fading memories, I will recall here a typical Church Road Sunday which began with a rush to the bus stop on the South Mall.\n\nThe queue at the bus stop for the No 2 to Church Road is lengthy. Chivalry is buried and old ladies are almost trampled on as soccergoers crowd onto the already congested double-decker on which the northside teams are already seated. The conductor has an impossible task and most avoid paying the fourpenny fare. On arrival at the venue, you noted that the minor games are in progress and that the area in front of the dressing room is crowded ,with many of the early arrivals doing emergency repairs to, or lacing up football boots. The selectors (normally eight groups of three) are out of earshot and a little bit distant from the hullabaloo as they debate their choices. Eyes are inevitably fixed on the entrance gate, waiting for another bus to pass. A scout has been delegated to stand at the gate with instructions to shout if Hackett, Lyncha, Hawkins or Mr Football are seen alighting from a bus. If they have not, then the selectors have to proceed without the stars and those waiting outside the dressing room are told to start getting stripped. “Here’s Hackett! here’s Lyncha!” comes a roar from the gate. A typical Greenmount solution to such an eventuality would result in a debate along the following lines. “The team is already picked”, says one of the selectors. “But Hackett has to play”, adds another. “OK, who are you going to let out now?” quizzes the third. “Shack of course,” says the Hackett fan. “Then you can call out the team” reply the others. “And no better boy” cries the hero as he heads for the dressing room with the others meekishly in tow. The brave selector calls for “ciúnas” as he names the eleven! “Shack you’re a sub” he says before closing the door behind him. Seconds later, a messenger appears with word that Hackett had forgotten his boots. “Ask Shack to give him his” quipps a shy selector, “You ask him yourself” snapps yer man, adding “it’s your turn to be Vincent De Paul”. The games soon get underway on the four pitches with the match in Number 4 the last to get started.\n\nPopping in and out\n\nAt Church Road, one could not be everywhere at once and so have to contented with hopping in and out of each ground in turn. Number 4 pitch is the furthest from the dressing room, and the most isolated and spacious, set in the middle of four acres – usually the scene of relegation battles (I only played there once). One of the teams is sporting a beautiful new gear, they look brilliant and it appears that their opposition have already scored. The football is anything but pretty, the wingers are flyers, the type that forget to cross the ball before running over the end line, leading to the usual cry of “they couldn’t cross the don”. Meanwhile, Number 3 is hosting a dour battle, no quarter asked or given. This is the tightest of the three pitches, you can nearly reach over and shake hands with spectators on the other sideline. Through the gap in the hedgerow, you can see our boys in action in Number 2. Albert’s provide the opposition so its no place for the faint-hearted. Hackett is uncomfortable in Shack’s boots (relics from the early fifties), which are two sizes too small, but still is our best player despite the opposition taunts of “Hackett is a wanker”. In the show-piece Number 1, a big crowd adds to the atmosphere of the northside derby between Castleview and Mary’s and referee Eddie Mullins has centre stage. Lyncha slides in and robs Hawkins. “Penalty”! roars Gerry Geaney. “Play on”, shouts Mullins. “Handball ref”, screams Geaney. “Thank God you’re not a surgeon”, bellows Mullins, revelling in the controversy. “Penalty kick” comes a huge roar from Number 3 which instantly results in a stampede from all other grounds. “Tich missed it”, late arrivers were told as the others scamper back to watch their own teams. The match in Number 4 which started last has ended first and the ref has some explaining to do to the irate players of the beautifully attired side who are losing six nil when the ref’s whistle brings a merciful and premature end to the massacre. They soon realised the reason for the short time as they were first in to the hot showers and are almost ready to head for the bus-stop before the other 69 tired athletes begin to scramble out of their muddy gear. The shower area soon resembles a sauna with bare bodies colliding in search of the hot water spray as the Lux soap and rare bottle of shampoo are shared by the masses. A mass exodus back to the changing room was a sign that all the hot water is used and only the Christmas Day swimmers remain to rinse the suds from their hair.\n\nVery soon all would be quiet in Church Road again, the last of the stragglers would have left for their local, leaving the dressing rooms littered with dirty cotton wool, torn socks, tie-ups, empty dettol bottles, old newspapers and an occasional, discarded, torn football boot. Oh, if only they could tell a tale –Is mise bróga peile. Ba maith liom scéal mo shaol a insint duit. Imagine the heartbreaking tale of the 1001 misses of the “sole” destroying Church Road striker. Happy days.\n\nEntry fees doubled (1977-78)\n\nSome significant changes for the new season (1977-78) emerged from the League’s AGM. The £1 levy on junior players, and 50p on youth’s was dispensed with but, to offset the loss of revenue, entrance fees almost doubled. Entry fees for juniors were increased to £30 (£35 new teams) and £16 for youths. It became compulsory to have team jerseys numbered and the referees Yellow and Red card system was extended to all competitions. When Finbarr Dorgan resigned from the AUL during the previous season he was not replaced and, as Seamus Casey and George Keating did not seek re-election, the management committee reverted to seven. The only absentee noted was Lisavaird and, the years since have shown that, there were some very loyal clubs among the newcomers which included Leeside, Killowen, Buttevant, St Patrick’s (again), Abbey Utd, Dungourney and Castletown Celtic.\n\nReputation tarnished\n\nThe “Team of the Year” for 1977/78 was Crofton Celtic, winners of the Tom O’Kelly Cup, Premier League and runners-up Munster Junior Cup. The Paddy Walsh managed squad – which included Dave Mahon, Pat Mahon, Pat Kirby, Alan Forde, Brendan Murphy, Alan Cremin and Jim Cahill – looked at one stage as if they would sweep the boards, but tired in the hectic final weeks and were beaten after a replay in the AOH Cup semi-final by Casement. Crofton won many new admirers when winning the O’Kelly Cup in decisive style, defeating indisciplined St Mary’s 3-0 after extra time at Dunne’s Park. It was an occasion St Mary’s will want to forget, they lost a player in the second half of normal time and had two more dismissed in extra time in a shameful decider. The proud name of the St Mary’s Club was sadly tarnished by their brutal performance in this game and the watching AUL Management Committee cracked the disciplinary whip hard when dishing out its heaviest penalties in many years. The numerically stronger Crofton took the trophy with the help of goals from Pat Kirby, Alan Cremin and Dave Mahon.\n\nShowdown avoided\n\nIn early March, Crofton had an eight point lead in the championship race but faltered over the Easter period when it became mathematically possible for St Mary’s to take the title by winning all their remaining games. The Saints dropped a vital point and Crofton beat Wolf Tones in their third last game to gain a championship winning opportunity against Casement in the penultimate tie. Casement had, the previous week, prevented the Crofton grand slam in the AOH Cup and, if they could repeat the feat or even take a point, the concluding match of the series between Crofton and St Mary’s would assume championship decider status. The showdown was avoided, and Crofton were crowned champions, after they defeated Casement in a thrilling finale to the campaign. Crofton made a brave bid for the Munster Junior Cup when beaten after a replay by Johnville. The first match at the Mardyke was an absolute thriller with the teams sharing eight goals and the Cork side squandering a two goal lead.\n\nMary’s take FAI Area\n\nAll St Mary’s craft and experience was needed to overcome the determined challenge of fast emerging Midleton in the Area final of the FAI Junior Cup at Turner’s Cross. After a scoreless opening half, the Saints jumped into a flattering 2-0 lead thanks to a Billy Keane og and a Ger Henchion converted penalty. The East Corkmen made a brave bid to recover from the setback, and Denis Mulcahy’s goal ensured a tension packed last 15 minutes after which the premier boys just held on to take their first President’s Cup as Area winners. There was no joy in the open draw for St Mary’s and even home advantage could not prevent their exit at the hands of Dublin Gas who advanced with a 2-0 victory. Before departing from the FAI Cup, tribute has to be paid to Barrack Rovers for their outstanding contribution to a memorable Area competition. Their drawn semi-final against St Mary’s at Flower Lodge was a terrific match, almost without parallel. The little southside team conceded two penalties; both for fouls, conceded by Con O’Connell, on the Healy brothers. They paid dearly for the indiscretions as Ger Henchion blasted shots past Liam O’Callaghan to put Mary’s 3-1 ahead. John Healy (St Mary’s) and Denis O’Keeffe had earlier exchanged goals. In the second half, Eric Humphreys drove a penalty wide for Barrack, while first half villain Con O’Connell gave Barrack hope with a great header and the crowd erupted when Humphreys compensated for his penalty miss with a dramatic equaliser. Unfortunately, Barrack learned that you only get one chance against Mary’s and in the replay the writing was on the wall when they had a player sent off, after which the Saints romped to a 4-0 victory.\n\nFought like tigers\n\nMany believe that the famed AOH competition was devalued by the hurried manner in which the concluding rounds were completed. It was unfair on the finalists to have played in what was for them the biggest game of their lives just two days after their replayed semi finals were decided.\n\nOne semi-final paired Casement with Crofton Celtic, the new sensations in junior soccer, who were annihilating all before them, therefore one might have thought that, the end was nigh for Casement, particularly as Crofton had in their previous meetings during the season had comfortable victories over their neighbours. Casement dug in and fought like tigers but were still a little fortunate to bring the game to a replay. A golden goal from Billy O’Sullivan was enough to edge out the hot favourites at the second time of asking. So Casement were ninety minutes away from achieving the first of their major ambitions. Their opponents in the final were Mallow who, surprisingly, defeated the holders St Mary’s on penalties after extra time had failed to decide their tie. The Mardyke was the ideal setting for this the final of the most prestigious trophy in Cork junior football, and patrons were assured of a close struggle for supremacy. Casement were banking on the cool heads of Tony O’Leary, the only surviving member of the side which lost in three semi-finals, the “evergreen” John Downey and Michael Foolkes. The game began in whirlwind fashion with defences unrelenting. However, both teams tired (noticeably and understandably), after their exertions in the semi-final replays completed only forty-eight hours earlier in Dunne’s Park. The fine attendance still got great value for their fifty pence as the teams skillfully probed for the one killer goal which was always likely to decide the outcome.\n\nWonder goal\n\nTwo minutes from the interval, Noel Rea broke the deadlock with a wonder goal befitting any great occasion, and one that deserved to decide the destination of the AOH. As one had come to expect of Mallow, they refused to throw in the towel and only determined play from the city boys managed to keep their goal intact, particularly during a hectic period midway through the second half. Liam Walsh was an inspiring captain and Dave Keating was beautifully composed, while O’Leary, Downey and John Bowen all made noticeable contributions. None, however, matched the brilliance of winger Ger Coughlan who ran the Mallow defence ragged. Tears of joy flowed freely with O’Leary, Downey, Skipper Walsh and Joe McCarthy all shedding a few as the triumphant cavalcade returned to the Horse Shoe Inn to celebrate in the time honoured way. Casement Celtic: J Hogan, J Bowen, M Foolkes, N Rea, L Walsh (capt), T O’Leary, G Coughlan, D Keating, J Downey, B O’Sullivan and J McCarthy. Subs: P O’Sullivan, P Mulcahy. Other panel members were G Rea, J Power, T O’Mahony and S O’Leary.\n\nOutstanding teams\n\nA few days after the AOH final patrons at the Mardyke enjoyed a spectacular Saxone Cup final when the dreaded penalty shoot-out was needed to separate two outstanding teams, Wilton and Kinsale. It was heartbreak for Kinsale who received the commiserations of all present after losing in such circumstances, having shaded most of the drawn tie. Brian McCarthy had finished a beautiful Ger Barry cross to the net in spectacular style to reward Kinsale for their enterprising play. That goal looked as if it would suffice until Tadhg Bowdren equalised, from an expertly struck free kick, 20 minutes from time. Kinsale’s penalty nominees, lacking in confidence, made a sorry mess of scoring from the spot with only one of their takers hitting the target. Wilton’s double bid was foiled when Glenvale defeated them 2-1 in the League Div 2 decider. A team who did record a double was Douglas Hall, who had ace marksman Ger Connolly to thank for their 1-0 league final win over Midleton at the Mardyke. Two nights earlier, in scorching heat, at Dunne’s Park, the Eddie O’Donovan managed side took the O’Keeffe Cup when defeating Temple Utd on penalties after the sides’ energy sapping encounter ended scoreless. Temple stars on the night were keeper Christy Coleman, Ned Leary, Padser Morley and Gerry Ambrose while those who shone brightly in the Hall’s double achievement were C J Harrington, John Dwyer, Noel O’Sullivan, Mick O’Connor and Donal Kidney.\n\nTrophies for Greenmount and Collegeview\n\nCollegeview won the Mall Tavern 1st Div League Cup when they defeated Cobh Ramblers 1-0 at St Colman’s Park, the winning goal coming from a penalty by Jim Byrne in the final minute. It was a popular result for a club who had been going through some lean years and was a reward for the hard-working committee – and people like Denis Budden and Geoff Barrett who showed great resolution in keeping the club going. Outstanding in St Colman’s Park were Pat McLaverty, Finbarr Riordan, Micky Bennett and Ted O’Brien. Ramblers were well served by Eddie Frahill, Moss Mellerick, Tony Britton and Denis Kinnivane. The form teams in the 3rd Div were Greenmount Celtic, Passage, Churchvilla, Kinsale and Gunners. Fittingly, all had the distinction of final appearances. Greenmount’s second string were always in control in the Dunlop League Cup final against Gunners yet the game’s solitary goal scored on the hour by Matthew Carter was more a testimony to the wholehearted endeavours of the army team in keeping the score to 1-0 than their own shortcomings. For Greenmount players Dave Delea, Buller Mullane, Ger Cahill, Micky McCarthy, Neil White, Tony O’Mahony, Leonard Corcoran, Martin O’Leary, Gene Healy, Pat “Dixie” Cahill and Eamonn Corcoran, it was a red letter occasion as they won their first and only soccer mementos. Churchvilla (Cloyne) were rewarded for their consistency when they defeated Passage Utd 2-0 in the League final at Rockenham.\n\nThe early closure of Turner’s Cross grounds resulted in many of the League’s finals being played in open grounds and, in a particular case, in one of the finalist’s home ground. Fermoy drew the short straw in the Quinlan 2nd Div League Cup final and conceded home advantage to St John Bosco’s. Gerry Carey gave Fermoy their first junior trophy in 20 years when netting the deciding goal in extra time after the sides had shared four goals in the exciting 90 minutes of normal time. Moss Maunsell was Fermoy’s hero having accounted for their early goals which were cancelled out by strikes from Joe Hartnett and Ger Glavin. Bosco’s were fighting a losing battle from the time they had a player sent off. Fermoy’s double bid was thwarted when John Coughlan’s Ballincollig travelled to the North Cork capital and defeated them 1-0 in the County Cup final when Alan Collins’ lone goal was decisive.\n\nCurley’s sixtimer\n\nOnly Wilton Utd, with three players, had multiple representation on the Cork AUL Youths team which returned to the national competition after their self-imposed exile. Thirteen other clubs were represented on the squad which read S Lynch (Wilton), F Lennox (Casement), P Coleman (Avondale), A Stack (Carrigaline), F Murphy (St Mary’s), R Hewitt (Dunbar), L Keane (Norton), C White (Crofton), N O’Sullivan (Douglas Hall), D Curtin (Ringmahon), B Walsh (Tramore), M Curley (Brideview), H O’Gorman (Kilreen), F Collins (Wilton) and I McGilton (Wilton). Cork slaughtered Waterford 8-1 in the 1st round when, ironically, Brideview’s representative on the AUL team, Michael Curley, hit six of the Cork goals. Cork greatly disappointed in the next round when defeated 3-2 by Limerick after extra time in a game where they squandered a 2-0 lead. Mick Curley’s goal scoring earned him a call up to the Irish Youth International team. Wilton and Fermoy were our standard-bearers in the open stage of the FAI Minor Cup when both made exits after very brave fights, to Shelbourne and Waterford Bohs respectively. Kilreen Celtic were surprise finalists in the Murphy Cup which ranked among the best finals played at the Mardyke during the season. Kilreen came from a goal down to lead St Mary’s 2-1 and Paddy Rice’s boys looked set to create a major shock until the Saints, inspired by Finbarr Murphy and Timmy McCarthy, equalised in the closing minutes through Paul Hickey. Mary’s went into overdrive in extra time and Tom O’Neill grabbed his second, and trophy winning, third goal. Kilreen’s gallant players were on their knees at the final whistle but lads like Harry O’Gorman, Dave Noonan, John McGrath and Mathew Morrissey had shown enough in defeat to suggest that a bright future was in store. This was the second leg of the big double as the Saints had already taken the 1st Div League championship. The championship success was attributable to their remarkable consistency in the second half of the programme when they easily dismissed the fading challenge of Wilton, and overtook and destroyed Springfield who had held the lead for so long.\n\nCon Sheehan, a well known patron of underage soccer, had a double celebration to organise when his Norton Celtic fulfilled promise shown the previous year when winning the 2nd Div League and Cup. Dunbar Celtic were their victims in both instances and the South Parish team, who had quality players in the Hewitt twins, Neil Hannigan, Tom Doyle and Finny Connors, could have had no complaints after a comprehensive 3-0 defeat in the league final. Dunbar were fast learners, and in the CMP Cup final they frustrated Norton with a well organised defensive performance before suffering the heartbreak of the dreaded penalty shoot-out defeat which was decided 7-6 in favour of the champions.\n\nWilton Utd confirmed their form as favourites when annexing the Coca Cola (1st Div Youths) Cup defeating Fermoy 1-0 after extra time. But for a superb performance from Ian McGrath, Wilton would not have enjoyed the success that everyone predicted. The all important winner was flashed to the net by Don O’Herlihy from a pinpoint Dave Leonard cross. Apart from McGrath, Wilton had other stars in Seward Lynch, Finbarr Collins, Ger Hayes, Don O’Herlihy and the Leonard brothers. Fermoy’s bravest were Pat Barry and John Gibbons.\n\nEarlier in the season, the football fraternity was stunned and saddened by the untimely death of Wembley’s Noel Martin. In 1974 the brilliant Martin had helped the Cork AUL to their first Inter League Youths triumph.\n\nCork AUL beat Dublin 2-1 at the Marist Grounds, Dundrum with goals from Vince Marshall and Liam King. Cork AUL panel: John Dwyer, Ned Leary, Don O’Neill, Liam Keane, Liam King, Mick Treacy, Ted Hickey, Brendan Mulcahy, Finbarr Murphy, Mick Curley, Robert Bickerstaffe, Vince Marshall, Terry Hayes and Peter Lee.\n\nSOCCER FLOURISHING 1978-79\n\nEntries for the League increased again with a grand total of 157 teams, consisting of 120 junior and 37 youths. The management committee was particularly pleased with the increase in the number of youths teams affiliated. While it was heartening to see soccer flourishing, one had to take into consideration the additional problems, which the increase in the number of teams created, for the League.\n\nThe biggest problem, and the greatest drawback, to the League was, undoubtedly, the shortage of playing pitches in the city. The AUL had a total of 44 junior and 14 youth teams without pitches, and when one realised that the League had only three playable pitches, the extent of the problem was easily seen. Clubs, who were present at the previous delegate meeting, voiced their displeasure with Cork Corporation for its failure to provide a sufficient number of grounds and all the delegates present agreed that some form of protest should be made to make Cork Corporation aware of the alarming lack of playing pitches. The AUL spent a lot of time and money in the close season on Dunne’s Park, making a vast improvement in the dressing rooms and shifting the goalposts to a more favourable positions. How annoying it was then to the League and the clubs when the Corporation failed to cut the grass on the playing surface in time for the season’s opening.\n\nAt that stage, nearly all the established clubs were in League membership. Still the enrollments continued with Ard-na-Laoi, Waterloo, Bweeng Rangers, Matehy Utd, Kilmichael Utd., Glenville Utd, Shanballymore and Churchtown registering. Apart from the first three mentioned, it was, for the others, just a visit to sample the fare. The league were sorry to lose St Christopher’s, who departed after well appreciated service, and Lisavaird from Div 3 after a very short stay. Newcomers Flower Lodge had direct links with the former AOH club and, not surprisingly, Garda (spot the guard) changed their name – they were to be known as St Gabriel’s. Though Crofton Celtic Premier League champions moved to the MSL to spearhead the senior club’s successful title challenge, they retained a team in the Premier League which also included a second Tipperary entry, Cahir Park. Disappointing news for Echo readers was that the League Press Officer, Denis Collins, retired after ten fascinating years of match reporting. Tony Fitzgerald kept readers informed of all the developments until Billy Lyons arrived to begin his long, fruitful association in September. Referees in 1978-79 were paid £3 for junior and £2 for youths games. There was good news at the commencement of the season for Brendan Mulcahy (Castleview) and Robert Bickerstaffe (Hillington) when they were called on to the Irish junior panel for the match against Scotland.\n\nThe practice of completing the league cup competitions early and the playing of finals before Christmas, which had proved very popular with the clubs, continued.\n\nWins for Midleton and Casement\n\nMidleton’s greater determination, allied to superior fitness, saw them take the Premier award when defeating Wembley 1-0 on the October Bank holiday at Rangers Park. In the 30th minute, a right wing cross from the industrious John Barry was spectacularly headed to the net by Paudie Foley. Jackie Daly was “Man of the Match” for Midleton, while the tireless Mick Long deserved greater rewards for his efforts on behalf of Wembley. Keeper Francis Lennox was the hero for Casement Celtic who beat favourites Tramore on penalties in the Youths League Cup final. Lennox atoned for an earlier mistake by saving two of the first five in a penalty shoot-out and then by blocking the effort of Alan Ramsell in the first of the sudden death spotters. Outstanding for the winners, apart from Lennox, were Seamus O’Leary and Noel Rea. Barry and Horgan shone brightest for the losers.\n\nKingston’s expertise\n\nIt was only through the herculean efforts of Wembley groundsman Finbarr Kingston that the CMP 2nd Div Youths final was played as scheduled. He was rewarded for his expertise when Wembley and Togher provided a thrilling game. Though leading 2-0, through early goals from Declan Courtney and Tony Burns, Wembley had to go to extra time to quench the challenge of the underdogs. Togher had kept plugging on and their outstanding player, Burke, atoned for an earlier miss when reducing arrears and on the stroke of time Christy Kenneally had equalised. In the first period of extra time, Burns proved Wembley’s match winner when netting from close range. The winners heroes were Burns, Neilus Dineen and Pat Murphy while Burke, Kenneally and Martin McCarthy starred for the losers.\n\nHappy Christmas for Hibernians\n\nThere was a little extra cheer for Hibernians (Shanbally) as they celebrated Christmas in the best possible manner by winning the Mall Tavern 1st Div trophy on Christmas Eve, defeating Rockmount 3-0 in the final. It was the first ever trophy win for the Miksey Lyons managed team. Rockmount’s sometimes lucky, and often brave, run came to an unsatisfactory halt in the 10th minute of a poor game. For, in the opening sequence, they took a 1-2-3- ko – No 1 was delivered by Liam O’Sullivan who opened the scoring for Hibs, Mick O’Reilly added No 2 and No 3 was the sending off of Eddie Murphy for a rash retaliation after a foul by Lyons. Derry Hurley sealed it midway through the second half when he crashed home a splendid free kick to make it 3-0. Apart from the scorers, Hibs best were John Crowley and Mick Murphy. Rockmount had creditable performances from Frank Murphy, George Cummins and Dan Mulvihill.\n\nThe buccaneers of Boher Celtic took the Quinlan League Cup – their first trophy – by beating Fermoy in Fermoy. The winning score was no isolated act of piracy, rather a gem (that would have Jimmy Hill and his legion of armchair fans drooling) brought about by an inspired substitution by Boher’s dynamic manager Andy Neenan who took of his out of touch leading scorer, John Scanlon. Sub John Blake linked with Denis Kiely who crossed for the “Prince of Pirates”, Sean Buckley, to head powerfully past Declan Condon. Boher’s stars were Denis Kiely, Noel Frazier and Ger O’Connell and the Fermoy players to whom no blame could be attached were John Redmond, Christy Kennedy, Jim Noonan and Jerry Condon.\n\nFarnanes click then slip\n\nThe fine J A Woods ground at Ovens hosted its first junior final when Farnanes and Fairview met in the Dunlop 3rd Div decider. Farnanes, who triumphed with goals from Ray Payne and Brian Taylor, were thrilled with the performances of Taylor and Pat Donegan. Those who tried hardest for Fairview were Micky Twohig, Martin Murphy, Micky Crowley and Pat O’Sullivan. Scot Brian Taylor, who, the previous Sunday, scored seven in a league game and the Sunday after the final notched four more, was tamed by Kilreen’s Christy Keeffe in the league final at Turner’s Cross. Here, Farnanes were left regretting a penalty miss when Pat Buckley netted the game’s only goal for Kilreen. The Ballyphehane side were fortunate to survive as the referee was unsighted when Christy Keeffe punched a certain Farnanes score off the goal-line. For Kilreen, veteran Liam McCarthy was an inspiring pivot and he received great support from Harry O’Gorman, Gene Burns, Dave Noonan and John McGrath. A goal by Ger Hayes, and a late og, gave Wilton a 2-1 Saxone Cup final win over Grattan whose sharpshooter was Paul Watt. The winners owed their success to the quality play of Hughie Bowdren, Willie Hennessy, Denis Murphy, Sean Walsh and Paul Curtin. Grattan’s performance suggested that there were better days ahead as a little improvement in front of goal would have provided greater reward for the wholehearted displays of Joe Lynch, Don O’Leary, Paul Lynch and Terry Hayes.\n\nChampions Cobh\n\nRingmahon won the 2nd Div Junior League title the hard way. In the decider at Turner’s Cross, they hit the front early with a goal from Pat Kavanagh and stayed there despite the gallant efforts of losers Kinsale. In the 1st Div League final at St Colman’s Park between Cobh Ramblers and Greenmount Rangers, dominated by defensive attitudes – the offside trap being the most frequently employed tactic – it was perhaps appropriate that the winning goal (the only score) came from a defender. It was tallied by Rambler’s Moss Mellerick who had ventured upfield in support of his attackers during a rare Cobh raid, 20 minutes into the second half. Unmarked, he picked up a clearance and rifled home a shot which flew into the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Best for the Danny Cronin managed champions were Ger Brennan, Con Brierley and Terry Sheally, while Greenmount could not fault Pat Mulcahy, Tim Healy or keeper Finbarr O’Mahony.\n\nCastleview Champs\n\nThe crucial ties in the Premier League title race were those “head to heads” between Castleview and Midleton. Midleton inflicted on Castleview their only defeat of the campaign but, really, needed to take all four points to have had a realistic chance of overtaking the runaway leaders. In the end, the View had four points to spare over Midleton, their nearest challengers. Castleview, who were captained by Denis Bennett, owed their championship success to the striking partnership of Brendan Mulcahy and Cyril Kavanagh; the steadiness of Dan Devereaux, Maurice Caulfield and John O’Brien; along with the scheming play of Timmy Singleton, Lar Leahy and Walter McCarthy. The title was claimed when they defeated Bohs 1-0 after Cyril Kavanagh’s cross was headed to the net by Lar Leahy.\n\nUnbeaten run ended\n\nBallincollig ended Midleton’s two year unbeaten run at the Mart Field when defeating them 2-1 in the Area final of the FAI Junior Cup. Long range frees by Pat Healy led to both Ballincollig goals, the first going in off Midleton skipper Mick Kirby while the second was headed home by James McNamara. Midleton’s reply came from a Paudie Foley penalty, their second such award, with the earlier attempt by Jackie Daly coming back off the post. Midleton also had to play for a long period with ten players after Billy Keane was dismissed. Ballincollig, well organised by John Coughlan, had outstanding performers in Healy, Sean Fitton, Danny Horgan and Mick McNulty. Denis Mulcahy, one of Midleton’s greatest sportstars in every code he played, established a club record with 40 goals from 47 games. Ballincollig were unable to improve on Cork’s dismal FAI record when beaten 3-1 by St Mochta’s in the 7th round.\n\nGoal scoring record\n\nThere were some outstanding goal scoring performances during the season. Dan Greene got sixty for Bweeng Rangers. I have already mentioned Brian Taylor’s individual haul of seven in one match, which topped Paudie Foley’s five in an FAI Junior Cup game. However, all nearly paled into insignificance beside Ger Dennehy’s record ten goal strike for Northvilla in the 10-0 annihilation of Crosshaven. Ger’s goalscoring touch deserted him on the biggest day of all – the final of the AOH Cup when Northvilla were trounced 5-1 by Grangevale at Turners Cross. The new goal scoring sensation was Dave Hayes, who helped himself to a hat trick, and the winners’ other scores were tallied by Val Morris (who opened the scoring) and Tony O’Leary (pen). Denis Cummins had Northvilla’s consolation score. As well as taking custody of the coveted AOH trophy for the first time in their 26 year history, Grangevale also received a cash prize of £100 from sponsor Kieran O’Riordan of O’Riordan’s Joiners. Grangevale: J Varian, M Corkery, J Nolan, T Desmond, M Treacy, K O’Sullivan, P Cronin, T O’Leary, D Hayes, C Moore, V Morris. Subs: P O’Sullivan, S Buckley.\n\nTitles for Tramore and Mallow\n\nTramore, managed by John Walsh, won the 1st Div Youths League title for the sixth time when a scoreless draw with St Mary’s gave them the trophy after an undefeated campaign. Meanwhile, Mallow recorded a first by taking the 2nd Div trophy when defeating unbeaten section ‘A’ winners Bohemians 2-1 in the decider at Turner’s Cross. Tom O’Neill and Derek Mellerick hit the target for the winners who had very able players in Peter Redmond, Gerard Buckley and Ray Cosgrove. The closest a Cork AUL team got to winning a trophy in outside competitions was when Ballincollig were defeated 3-1 by Wembley Rovers (Limerick) in the final of the Munster Minor Cup. Wembley, who only lost two out of twenty-eight, were clearly the better side, but spirited Ballincollig helped to make it a splendid game. Ballincollig even looked like making a match of it when Barry Murphy slotted home an equaliser, but the bigger and stronger Limerick side dominated the second half in which they sealed the Cork side’s fate when netting twice. For the losers, Finbarr Hogan, Brian Coughlan and Peter Walsh, all showed great promise. The County Cup competition was postponed after the completion of the second round as a result of petrol shortages. During the season, Matehy and Killeagh Celtic were expelled from the League, a fate which also befell Crofton (Premier) and Mayfield Ath (Div 3) who were removed for playing illegal players.\n\nJuniors fail\n\nCork AUL drew 1-1 with Waterford in the first round of the Oscar Traynor Cup when John Cahill was the scorer. They lined out as follows: Jim Scanlon, Ned Leary, Robert Bickerstaffe, Jack Daly, Pat Healy, Brendan Mulcahy, Denis Mulcahy, Willie Driscoll, Ger Connolly, Tadhg O’Reilly and Paudie Foley. Subs: John Bowen, John Cahill. The Cork AUL midfield failed to function in Ozier Park and yet was little improved for the replay in Midleton. This time Waterford got the breaks that luck denied them in the drawn game and won by two clear goals – both netted from penalties. Cork selectors Gerry Geaney, John Coughlan, Noel Punch, Tony Fitzgerald and Vince Cummins made numerous changes in the panel for the Tayto Cup match against Dublin when Cork retained the trophy with a 3-1 win at Turners Cross. After a scoreless first half, Cork introduced substitutes Dave Hayes and Larry Leahy in what turned out to be a master move as the deadly duo shared the Cork total with Hayes getting the brace. Panel: John Dwyer, Terry Furlong, Dan Devereaux, Mick Treacy, Pat Healy, Ned O’Leary, Liam O’Sullivan, John Healy, Brendan Mulcahy, John Dowling, Liam Naughton, Tadhg O’Reilly, Dave Hayes, Lar Leahy and Tadhg Bowdren.\n\nYouths go close\n\nIn an effervescent extra time effort that sometimes bubbled up to the edges of excellence Cork Youths destroyed a Waterford team that held them to a 1-1 draw in normal time in the Inter League Soccer Reporter Trophy. Dave Barry’s header, from an Eddie O’Halloran cross, had sent the tie to extra time. Waterford collapsed in the added time when Cork, playing glorious football, netted four times through Robbie O’Donoghue, Dave Barry, Liam Murphy and James Corcoran. Buoyed up by a confident rearguard, and inspired by a tireless and constructive midfield, the AUL overcame shortcomings in attack to score a notable 3-1 victory over their Dublin counterparts in the semi-final in Midleton. Cork’s scorers were Eddie O’Halloran, Liam Murphy and James Corcoran.\n\nA strong wind spoiled the football in the final, played at St Colman’s Park, but nothing marred the evident joy of the Donegal side who won with the game’s only goal. If the standard was a mild let-down to the spectators, then the result was even more so for the home lads who, except for the ebullient Rea, could hardly manage a smile between them as they trooped up for the losers; trophies. Cork: Francis Lennox, Pat Coleman, Finbarr Collins, Noel Rea, Terry O’Donovan, Eddie O’Halloran, Liam Murphy, Dave Barry, James Corcoran, Richard Horgan, Robbie O’Donoghue. Subs: Terry Kearns, Philip Long.\n\nA few days later, the Cork side gained some consolation when Liam Murphy set up Terry Kearns to shoot the winner against the touring Westphalians. Wilton’s Finbarr Collins played in four internationals during the European Youth campaign when Casement keeper Francis Lennox was substitute. Incidentally, Lennox got one of those rare goals by a goalkeeper in a Murphy Cup game when a huge kick from his own area went all the way to the net at the other end of the field. Munster Youths beat the Westphalians 2-0 at Flower Lodge. Both goals were scored by John Dwyer of Tipperary, and Cork players in the side were F Lennox, P Coleman, F Collins, N Rea, L Murphy and D Barry.\n\nDuring the season, the AUL celebrated its 30th anniversary with a dinner at the Imperial Hotel. In April, they put away the knives and forks and carried placards, along with other soccer bodies, in a protest march through the city to highlight the lack of adequate facilities.\n\nGrounds still a major problem (1979 – 80)\n\nThe numbers playing organised amateur soccer, at all levels in Cork, continued to increase spectacularly. Each new season brought with it its quota of new clubs and news of extensions to existing clubs. Soccer was one of the fastest growing sports. The resultant problems inspired the Cork Examiner’s Billy George to produce an excellent series of articles examining the state of soccer in Cork. The grounds’ situation constantly referred to in the series was highlighted at the AGM of the AUL when the critical shortage of playing pitches, and the role of the Cork Corporation in providing such facilities, was discussed at length by the 69 club delegates that attended. The Chairman of the Cork AUL, Mr Billy Murphy, said he regretted the fact that, as yet, there had been no response from the Cork Corporation regarding grounds, following the massive protest march through the city two months earlier when they tried to highlight the plight of city and county clubs.\n\nAUL bid for Turner’s Cross\n\nThe management committee of the Cork Athletic Union Football League disclosed that they had made an official bid to the Football Association of Ireland to secure a long-term lease for the Turner’s Cross ground, once the home of League of Ireland side Cork Celtic. The Cork AUL had been without a headquarters in Cork for a number of years – since the termination of their links with Church Road – and they pointed out that with the expulsion of Cork Celtic from the League of Ireland, and their subsequent failure to gain entry to the Munster Senior League, the time was ripe for the Cork AUL to establish Turner’s Cross as their headquarters in Cork. Mr Murphy stated that he and other members of the committee had discussed the situation in depth and decided that the Cork AUL were willing and able to plough £50,000 into the development of Turner’s Cross. The Chairman added that through, the Cork AUL’s Ground Development Fund and through the assistance of the various clubs in the League, the money could be raised. At the time, the AUL’s GDF stood at £18,000. Mr Vincent Cummins, Hon Secretary of the Cork AUL, said that the pitch would be made available for all leagues in Cork including the Munster Senior League, the Shipping League, the Cork Schoolboys League and the Cork AUL’s Leagues.\n\nTerrible conditions\n\nAUL Fixtures Secretary, Tony Fitzgerald, in an interview with Billy George for the afore-mentioned series, said: “Really, teams are having to play under terrible conditions in Cork. There is a shortage of pitches and a very serious lack of dressing-rooms. We have 58 teams in our League without a pitch of their own and we have only two pitches from the Corporation at Dunne’s Park, in Blackrock, for them”. A cause of encouragement to the AUL was the spread of the game throughout the county. “The game has picked up enormously in rural areas”, said Mr Fitzgerald. “Midleton is a case in point. They are one of the outstanding teams in our Premier Division. We have 14 teams in North Cork and teams in Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bandon, Crosshaven, Cobh, Youghal and five teams in Midleton. We had three pitches at Church Road in the city for 28 years and were paid £20,000 in compensation when we had to move out of there in 1977, but we cannot get land to spend the money on. The pitches in Blackrock are available to us only on a temporary basis and to progress, we need 16 new pitches in all areas.”\n\nOnly three clubs own their grounds\n\nThe comparative lack of success in national competitions at Schoolboys, Youths, Junior, Munster Senior and League of Ireland level was a commentary on the lack of proper playing pitches and suggested serious shortcomings in the standard of Cork football. A total of 318 teams took part in regular competitions in these leagues. In addition, further competitions organised by the Cork Shipping League and the Cork Inter-House League boosted the numbers playing the game still higher. This was a key issue raised by Mr. George who informed readers of another sad fact when stating “A more relevant statistic and surely a chilling commentary on the state of the game is that only three clubs actually own their own ground (1979) – Cobh Ramblers, Fermoy and Springfield.”\n\nConstructive step\n\nThat statement was, said Mr George, sure to inflame many of those involved in soccer. “There are teams with proud traditions and high standards who have been catering for the youth in their district for several decades. The work they have done and continue to do is invaluable as a community service, apart from anything else”. continued Bill George who added “that work has almost exclusively been directed at putting teams on the field and playing matches. There can be no denying, one of the biggest brakes on the advancement of the game is the lack of permanent homes and club facilities as well as dressing-rooms for the teams. There are signs that this shortcoming has, as last, been recognised”.\n\n‘Three years ago, we implemented a rule that forbade us from allowing any new teams into our competitions unless they had their own pitch”, said Tony Fitzgerald of the Cork AUL, the biggest league outside of Dublin. That was a constructive step if a little too late to ease the problem facing League officials trying to cater for more teams than there are pitches. There are 58 teams in the League who do not have a pitch. In consequence many teams are without a match for two and three weeks at a time.’\n\n“Criticism of the Corporation in this context was justified”, added Bill George. “The Cork Schoolboys’ League suffered and continues to suffer because of the loss of their pitch at Togher. The Corporation has done little to provide playing areas and they suffer by comparison with Dublin Corporation in this regard. Dublin Corporation lease out pitches, dressing-rooms and provide a caretaker service”, he said. Very few soccer legislators, players or supporters would have disagreed with Billy’s concluding statement which placed the ball firmly in the clubs’ own back garden when saying that: “The soccer teams will continue to agitate for more facilities from the Corporation in Cork, but they must also help themselves if the sport is to develop. There are signs that some, at least, accept this and are taking the first, tentative steps towards filling the obvious need”.\n\nJim Hennebry, speaking on the grounds issue, said “Avondale United is one of the newer teams in Cork; Tramore Athletic is 30 years old and one of the most respected. I have admired Tramore, in fact I have tried to develop Avondale along the same lines as Tramore” added Jim, General Manager of Avondale. “But they have only started a grounds fund in the past year. They are one of the most enlightened clubs . . . but look at the time that has been lost.”\n\nAll the outgoing officers of the League were returned to office. Flower Lodge AFC changed their name to AOH and newcomers admitted were Macroom International, Killeady, Verolme and Annsvilla. Not among the 121 entries to the junior grade were the previously successful clubs Celtic and 4th Battalion, along with Lisgriffin. The door remained closed to the expelled clubs Crofton Celtic, Mayfield Ath, Killeagh Celtic and Matehy Utd.\n\nGreat year for youth football\n\nViews expressed earlier about the poor standard of Cork football, a fact the experts claimed was borne out by our poor results at national level, were booted into touch when Cork Youths laid claim to being the best in Ireland with a magnificent double success. The AUL won the FAI Inter League trophy and Tramore Youths won the FAI Minor and Munster Cups. Cork were represented by both Tramore and Springfield in the FAI Youth semi-finals and St Mary’s ensured that the provincial final was an all-Leeside affair.\n\nTramore are Ireland’s Number 1\n\nTramore’s marvellous 2-0 victory over Home Farm in the FAI, achieved without injured stars – Tony Mullins and Brian Fleming – really indicated that Cork soccer was alive and well. Ger Cunningham had an outstanding game in goal for the Cork team, but it was in midfield that victory was earned most. Dave Barry was top class and was bolstered by non-stop Mattie Murphy; together they created the majority of the scoring chances. The formidable Home Farm defence finally cracked two minutes into extra time. Kieran O’Regan, the best forward on view, crossed for Niall Dineen to head on to Barry whose low shot crashed to the net. The victory was sealed with a fine goal 4 minutes late; Matt Murphy linked with White to create the opening for substitute Mick O’Rourke to net from close range. Tramore: Cunningham, Smith, Donovan, Madden, Waters, Murphy, Barry, White, O’Regan, Dineen and Clarke. Subs: O’Rourke, Leahy.\n\nMunster as well\n\nTramore followed up this success by capturing the Munster Youths Cup for the first time with a very hard earned 1-0 win over brave St Mary’s. The only goal of the game arrived in the 68th minute when Dave Barry set up sub Donal O’Callaghan to shoot past Finbarr Redmond. Outstanding for the winners were Terry Donovan, Niall Dineen and Dave Barry. The Mary’s players to make most impression on the exciting game were Redmond, Long, Galvin and Brady. Tramore added the Coca Cola Cup to the impressive haul with a deserved 2-0 win over Rockmount. Ray Clarke had them 1-0 ahead at half-time and Niall Dineen sealed the win with a delightful second half score. They made it a four-timer by wrapping up the league championship with a scintillating 4-0 victory over Casement in their final game. Rockmount, who had lived in the shadow of Tramore all year, finished the season in style by annexing the coveted Murphy Cup as a result of an impressive 4-0 win over St Mary’s in the final. Sharing the scores were John Magee, Brendan Kenneally, Kevin Kearney and Denis Keane.\n\nWins for Ringmahon and Blackpool\n\nRingmahon Youths, though dominating the CMP Cup final against Douglas Hall, had to depend on their penalty expertise to win. Normal and extra time produced no goals and Ringmahon won the penalty decider 4-3. Best for the winners were Cormac Harrington, James Furlong and Martin Lyons. For the Hall, Peter Morris and Neil and John Creedon did well. Rangers failed to make it a double. Blackpool Celtic returned to youth footballs with a championship win and great credit was given to mentors Micky Moriarty, Denis Cullinane and Paddy Walsh. They beat Ringmahon 1-0 after extra time and the win was achieved as a result of a brilliant individual score from Noel Buckley who ended a jinking run with a beautiful strike. Blackpool’s stars were Gerry O’Sullivan, Tony Murphy, Martin O’Brien and Finbarr Murphy. The unlucky Rangers were best served by Paudie Coughlan, Pat O’Leary and James Furlong.\n\nMagnificent Cork\n\nCork AUL’s great win in the final of the Youths Inter League Soccer Reporter Cup in Kilkenny was the icing on the cake for AUL football. Visitors Cork recovered from the shuddering shock of conceding an easy 4th minute goal to Kilkenny’s Fitzpatrick, to equalise 10 minutes later when Youghal player Terry Kearns scored. Both sides had scoring chances as the thrill packed game progressed but Cork had most, and only brilliant saves by Kilkenny’s youth international, Cleere, kept the home side in the hunt until extra time. Cork dominated the last period of this added time and had the opportunism of Kearns to thank for their victory when he pounced on a bad back pass to shoot the decisive goal. Cork AUL: Finbarr Hogan (Ballincollig), Sean O’Sullivan (Casement Celtic), Fergus Begley (Everton), Mick O’Keeffe (Rockmount), Terry O’Donovan (Tramore Ath.), Sean Madden (do.), Matthew Murphy (do), Liam Murphy (Wilton Utd), Terry Kearns (St Martin’s), Kevin Murphy (UCC Academicals) and David O’Connor (Casement Celtic). Subs were Philip Long and Martin Lyons.\n\nTerry O’Donovan received the cup from FAI Youth President John Farrell and Terry’s acceptance speech, a model of its kind, went down very well with the large attendance. Among those Terry singled out as being vital to the Cork success were coach Denis Galvin, trainer Johnny O’Driscoll and the selectors Mick Moriarty, Noel Stokes, John Delea and Paddy Fitton. It is probably not entirely fair to single out players from the champions for, all along the hard road since midwinter, each lad had done his bit (and here, let us not forget Jamesie Corcoran sidelined through injury), but on the day the best were Hogan, O’Sullivan, Begley, O’Donovan, Liam and Mattie Murphy, Madden and Kearns.\n\nReplays needed\n\nThe pathway to glory began with a 4-1 victory over Limerick at Turner’s Cross when the marksmen were Mattie Murphy, Liam Murphy, James Corcoran and Dave Barry. Cork had it much tougher in the next round and lost a two goal lead to the Dublin AUL who earned a replay in Cork. In the replay, Cork overcame injuries to Kevin Murphy and Jamesie Corcoran (fractured leg) in beating the Dubs 2-1 with scores from Corcoran and Kevin Kearney. Cork also needed a replay to see off the brave challenge of Donegal in the semi-final. The sides shared four goals in Donegal as Dave Barry and Larry O’Donovan accounted for the Cork scores. A well hit Barry free kick was enough to ensure a final place as Donegal’s dreams were shattered at Turner’s Cross. The other members of the squad not involved against Kilkenny were C Campbell (Wilton), N O’Driscoll (Rockmount) and K Kearney (Rockmount). Players on the panel in the earlier rounds included F Redmond (St Mary’s), P Murphy (Rockmount) and A Cullen (Farnanes).\n\nCork were double-handed going into the open stages of the FAI Junior but neither of the sides, St Mary’s and Douglas Hall, made progress. Mary’s led through Ted Hickey in their match with Raheeny and held out until the closing minutes when two defensive mistakes brought about their downfall. Douglas Hall put up a creditable show before going out on a 2-1 scoreline to Geraldine’s (Limerick) who led 1-0 at half-time. C J Harrington gave the Hall hope with a sweet equaliser but the Limerick side struck within minutes to secure their quarter final place.\n\nGlavin stars as Bosco’s take AOH\n\nPrior to Friday, June 6th, soccer followers were asking who were St John Bosco’s and where did they come from? These questions and many others were answered after 90 minutes of an exciting AOH Cup final when the 2nd div side shocked premier outfit Greenmount 2-1. The city team, who were entitled to be confident having knocked out favourites St Mary’s in the semi-final, looked to have snatched a 15th minute, when Plunkett Carter was on hand to hammer home after a blistering 20 yard free by Pat Mulcahy came back off the post, but, Barry Kearney ruled it offside. Oh-oh-oh-oh What a referee! What a referee! Greenmount were still reeling from that decision when Ger Glavin, from a seemingly impossible position on the bottom right hand corner of Turner’s Cross, beat keeper Liam Ryan with a delightful chip. Greenmount were back on level terms soon afterwards when Mulcahy scored from the penalty spot after Carter was brought down in the box. Three minutes later, Glavin latched on to a misjudged back pass and the ace striker beat Ryan at the second attempt. At the start of the second half, Greenmount had yet another goal disallowed for offside, followed minutes later by more misfortune when Deccie Barry headed a goal bound shot from Alan Ramsell off the line. Greenmount continuing to press forward (but lacking a cool head in midfield) and Bosco’s raiding on the break, were the ingredients that kept the excellent attendance on a knife-edge to the end, which arrived with the underdogs successfully surviving a series of corners to take the coveted trophy. For Bosco’s Glavin was undoubtedly the star but they also were grateful for the backup support from Tony Horgan, Denis McSweeney, Kevin Barry, Deccie Barry and John “Scobie” Cleary. On a disappointing night for Greenmount, only Paddy O’Callaghan, Sean Long, Greg Healy, Cal O’Leary and Alan Ramsell could have been happy with their performances. St John Bosco’s: Tony Horgan, Sean Barry, Deccie Barry, Kevin Barry, Denis McSweeney, Joe Hartnett, Ger Glavin (captain), Anthony Ahern, John Cleary, Billy Ahern and Anthony McSweeney. Subs (not used) were Kieran O’Donovan and Paddy O’Sullivan.\n\nCHAMPIONS\n\nCasement Celtic had yet another of their aspirations filled when they were deservedly crowned Premier League champions after a comfortable 3-0 victory over St Michael’s (Tipp) in their final league game at Turner’s Cross. Billy O’Sullivan, Ger Rea and Joe McCarthy were credited with the goals that had Casement Celtic’s name on the trophy for the first time. The ease and inevitability of a Casement victory, which was always apparent, created an anticlimatic situation with the champagne being readied in the home dressing-room long before the final whistle was blown.\n\nCasement’s day\n\nIt was a tremendous Premier League title race with several teams in contention for long periods. Douglas Hall joined Casement at the top of the table in early April, and Cobh Ramblers were still in the hunt with some games in hand. The “Hall” slipped up on the run-in and Casement went under to arch rivals St Mary’s, allowing Cobh to leap-frog into the lead. Now the cat was among the pigeons and a thriller was assured when Casement and Cobh met in a showdown that would decide the title – one point for Cobh and the cup would be on its way to the Holy Ground. Paul O’Sullivan gave Casement first blood; then, AUL youths player Sean O’Sullivan brought down Moss Mellerick in the box, allowing Ger Brennan to equalise from the spot. But it was Casement’s day, and goals from Ger O’Sullivan and Seamus O’Leary quickly brought Cobh back to terra firma. Hot House Flowers fans will be surprised to hear that brilliant drummer Gerry Fehilly, former schoolboy international, was a key member of Casement’s youths and junior panels.\n\nEarlier in the month, Casement had defeated Midleton 2-0 in the final of the Tom O’Kelly Premier League Cup, thanks to goals from regular marksmen Pat Mulcahy and Liam Walsh. Once again Casement’s slick teamwork was the hallmark of their game. For the record, the victorious team was B Corkery, S O’Leary, J Bowen, J O’Sullivan, T McCarthy, G Rea, L Walsh, P O’Sullivan, P Mulcahy, M Foolkes, B O’Sullivan. Subs: N Rea, J Dowling. Casement’s speed and sharpness around the field were a direct result of the hard training the squad put in during the season and they deservedly reaped the rewards of that dedication, providing an object-lesson for many other clubs content to play from Sunday to Sunday without any worthwhile effort in between. It was also a tribute to their coach John Dowling, his assistant Georgie Foolkes, and their inspiring captain Ger O’Sullivan who left no stone unturned in their quest for glory.\n\nTwice in six days Grattan lost out in penalty shoot-out deciders (beaten on penalties by Waterford Bohs in the Munster Junior). They were beaten 5-4 by their bogey team, Wilton, in the Mall Tavern 1st Div League Cup final after normal and extra time had ended scoreless. Centre half and capt. Ger Hayes was outstanding for the winners and he received great support from Ian McGilton, Willie Hennessy and Micky Duggan. Those who impressed most in the Grattan colours were Paul Hogan, Richie McDonnell and Georgie Murphy.\n\nIn the Quinlan 2nd Div League Cup final, Anthony McSweeney gave Bosco’s an early lead against Bandon and John Cleary made it two nil before the break. Four minutes into the second half, Bandon’s best player, Barry Manley, was successful from the penalty spot after which they laid siege to the Bosco’s goal. Bosco’s were equal to the task and hung on to complete the AOH and Quinlan Cup doubles. Bosco’s owed a lot to their stars on the day who were Kevin Barry, Owen McCarthy and Anthony Aherne.\n\nRecord scoring fails to land trophy\n\nPrior to April, Bweeng Rangers had scored 120 goals and suffered only one defeat (at the hands of Banteer), so they were entitled to their favourite’s tag in the all-county Dunlop Div 3 Cup final. This suited unfashionable Ballyclough who reaped the benefits of a flying start and eventually beat Bweeng 2-1. The match was only five minutes old when Moloney was tumbled in the box and Walsh converted the spot kick. A few minutes later Moloney made it two nil. Bweeng, who badly missed their absent ace striker Dan Green, reduced the arrears midway through the second half but could not conjure up enough magic to wrestle the initiative from Ballyclough who hung on for a famous victory. It was a particularly sweet triumph for manager Ger O’Connor and capt Johnny Donoghue, co-founders of the club. On song for the winners were Ed Jones, Ger Deady and Teddy O’Keeffe. Out of touch Bweeng were satisfied with the performances of Jerry Horgan, Eamonn Connors, Mick Walsh and Brendan O’Shea.\n\nArd-na-Laoi double up\n\nSurprisingly Bweeng’s record scoring (they netted 14 in one game against Glenville) could not win them a title as they were beaten in the 3rd Div League semi-final by Ard-na-Laoi and were spectators as their conquerors and Grangevale Utd fought out a thrilling final at Turner’s Cross. The Leemount team, in only their second season in football, were a revelation and took the title at the end of a fantastic 110 minutes when St John Cremin hit the ninth goal of the game. The order of scoring was: James O’Leary put Ard-na-Laoi ahead.; a double strike by Jimmy Leahy had Grangevale in the ascendancy, Cremin and James O’Leary then netted as the pendulum swung Ard-na-Laoi’s way. Ard-na-Laoi 3 – Grangevale 2. Then super sub Peter Connolly entered the fray and scored twice to put Grange in front again. The AUL Management were preparing for the trophy presentation when “Man of"
