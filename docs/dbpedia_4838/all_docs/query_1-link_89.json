And the intruiging thing about this final is that both team possess players who can turn the game.\n\nWhen Cork are heading for their opponents' goal look for Ollie Cahill. The Clonmel flyer is Cork's joint top scorer this year but it has been his eye-catching wing performances that earned him the Player of the Month award for December. Most of Cork's attacks will filter through Cahill and Shels will do well to shut him off from the play. The same applies for Patsy Freyne too, Cork's creative force in midfield.\n\nElsewhere manager Dave Barry is hoping that Jason Kabia can continue where he left off against Athlone Town in the semi-final. The English striker should benefit with either Johnny Glynn or Noel Hartigan playing alongside him in attack. Shels, perhaps, have more options. Pat Fenlon was badly missed in Dundalk when Shels lost the league, along with Dessie Baker, who has adpated well to playing on the right flank.\n\nStephen Geoghegan as always represents the main threat to Cork - but he'll be ably assisted by new front man Liam Kelly, who has settled magnificently since his move from Home Farm Everton.\n\nAnd don't forget prolific centre-half Pat Scully, who is a constant danger from set-pieces."
