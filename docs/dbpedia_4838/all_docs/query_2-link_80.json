        "text": "Tullow Historian is privileged to add this, the third of Eugene O’Connor’s Tullow triology, to his previous works, featured on this blog. Eugene captures the everyday life of Tullow, with its ways of earning a living, its fun and entertainment, and its fair share of characters. He writes with affection and with wit, covering his earliest childhood memories to his most recent recollections. Enjoy this journey down memory lane in Eugene’s own words:\n\nThis slight memoir covers hardly one per cent of the lives and times of the Tullow people. The late Mrs Jackman, of Barrack street wrote an excellent piece on her family in her nineties and it should be in the library. Everyone they say has a story of some kind and all are worth recording, even about the two teachers on holiday, one who bumped into a past pupil at Ayer’s Rock in Australia and the other who met a past pupil in South Africa. And if you think your spelling is not up to much then you are as good as President Trump. Record one story and try it out on a friend. It doesn’t have to be tragic or funny just a little diﬀerent and as they say we’re all a little diﬀerent.\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nThis book is about growing up in an Irish village in the 1940s. With a population of about 1,700 Tullow was little more than a village with no industry and employment mostly on the land where there was very little machinery in use. A day on your knees in the beet ﬁelds was in stark contrast to the romance of the Summer hay ﬁelds. There were some government jobs, teachers and Gardai, two doctors and a small district hospital, but there was no running water in the town and electricity was available only as far the town’s edge. It really was almost primitive except that since 1938 it had a cinema that brought magic and exotica into the humdrum lives.\n\nA bus left for Dublin at 7 a.m. and returned at 8 p.m. (times are approximate) and when the New Ross bus came around 11 a.m. on its way to Dublin that was the excitement over for the day. Cars were so rare that we could play football on Sundays in the Square with balls made of newspaper wrappings and strong white cord. Now and again we paused to let a car chug through. The Gardai were busy checking that cyclists had the obligatory lights, and in Summer gathering a census of the crops the farmers were growing. A lot of time was spent observing.\n\nThere were busy times too especially when the monthly cattle and sheep fairs were held. The stock crowded into the town and stood, heads into the walls as the buyers did their best to bring down prices. Dealers of all sorts came from Dublin with delph and second-hand clothes and boots, while the singers and ﬁddlers moved from street to street, and the strong man, on his bed of nails with a granite rock on his chest invited the onlooker to stand on the rock, all trying desperately to gather a few shillings, as the wolf seemed always at the door. Money was scarce, wages were low, and the cheapest luxury was the 4p pit in the cinema where a vast new world could be longingly enjoyed.\n\nIn 2016 the Irish Times published three articles from me in the Family Fortunes column and with those as a basis I decided to try a memoir for ourgrandchildren, Irish and American, to record for them what life was like for us, and to account for any inﬂuences our character and personality had on them. There was stuﬀ in the memoir that I thought the people of Tullow would like to be reminded of and that became the booklet Tough times in Tullow, and then I couldn’t stop, and More tales from Tullow arrived. This present book is a reworking of all, with a fuller account of the town and its people. I have included articles in More Tales from Tullow that are not strictly about Tullow, but which originated there and they may entertain when the reader tires of Tullow. Both books are available in tullowhistorian@wordpress.com courtesy of C.P. McQuinn.\n\nIt is impossible to thank all who helped me with all kinds of information and suggestions for further study. I am very grateful for the time and research they did to help in the project and I am most grateful for the positive response to the two booklets in print. My sincere thanks to all who helped in any way including Fr. E. Aughney, Pat Byrne, John Byrne, Lar Byrne, R. Burgess, Haulie Brophy, Eamonn Darcy, John Dawson, Evan Fitzgerald, Johnny Clarke, Michael Johnson, P.J.Griﬃn, Ursula and Pat Farrell, P. Holden, Jinksy Keating, Tom Holohan, John O’Brien, Joe Whelan, Mick Murphy, Johnny Doran, Eunice, Brendan McMahon, Jim Bolger, Paddy Hickey, Margaret Ronan, Pee Kavanagh, David Kenny, John Doyle, Mary Murphy, Sean Ronan, Josephine Nugent, Diarmuid O’Connor, and especially Anne Twomey who taught me a lot more than I ever taught her. Thank you also to the excellent help from the staﬀ of Carlow, Tullow and Wexford Libraries. Christy McQuinn very kindly put all on view online at http://www.tullowhistorian.wordpress.com. My brothers, Tom and Liam, and our three boys, Feargal, Daragh and Gene helped and encouraged me all the way.\n\nEsther’s everlasting patience, fortitude and help kept me going.\n\nEugene O Connor 2.3.’18———— 10.2.’20\n\nC H A P T E R O N E A Little Bit of History\n\nEvery small town in Ireland seems to have a history at least 2,000 years old. Whether its a fairy ring or a holy well or a dolmen something of signiﬁcance is available in every settlement area. Tullow’s most important history concerns education. An older name of Tullow was Teaghlach Fortchern or the household of St. Fortune who taught St. Finnian who then set up a school in Clonard which had an average attendance of 3,000 students. From this place the Twelve Apostles of Ireland set oﬀ to Europe to repair the destruction caused by the Huns, the Goths and the Vandals and their relations which resulted in the Dark Ages. Evidence of the Apostles eﬀorts can be seen in many towns and cities all over Europe .\n\nThat was around 800 A.D. St. Columbanus, the Patron saint of the E. U. was born in Myshall and may have picked up a bit of education from his neighbours.\n\nThe Normans came and quickly settled down in hastily made castles. They married into the superior culture and the castles became, as the cynic said ‘just a load of oul walls.’\n\nIn 1798 Fr. Murphy spurred up the rocks and the people of Wexford in an eﬀort to liberate his people, but bravery and pikes were hopeless against guns and he was betrayed and captured in Tullow.\n\nThe next important development was the foundation of the Brigidine order of nuns in 1807 and of the Patrician Brothers in 1808 both founded by Bishop Delany. The children of the area were largely illiterate and the foundations were a very important development. The Religious served the young wherever they went in Wales, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Mexico and the U.S.A. and India.\n\nWhen the 1916 Rising came about there were not a lot of IRA in active service. However the story is told that there were four police in the barracks, two of whom were reasonable, while the other pair were dangerous. A decision was made to kill the dangerous ones but on the night in question the pairs had swopped duties and the wrong ones were shot. That was on 15 September 1920, and on the following night the Black and Tans struck in revenge.\n\nAs night fell a riﬂe shot rang out and then a sustained burst of gunﬁre followed by the burning of McDermott’s and Griﬃn’s both of which were then owned by the Murphy family whose son, Captain Murphy, had recently died in the war in France.\n\nNeavyn’s bar and grocery was smashed up and ransacked and £100 of goods stolen. Many barrels of beer were removed from the premises and rolled down the Square and shot through with riﬂe ﬁre. The locals were terriﬁed as the Tans, well under the inﬂuence, were capable of anything. The great fear was that the Square would be burned down but help arrived from Carlow with thirty ﬁreﬁghters in Mr.Governey’s lorry. The Captain Murphy Hall reminds us of those days. The Murphy name is still at the entrance to Mc Dermott’s public house. Restoring Griﬃns cost over £17,000 .\n\nThe Economic War, 1932-38, caused great hardship to the farmers and to all depending on them. Farm workers earned £ 3.50 p.w. and road workers £5 with no hope of improvement for twenty years or so. The population then was about 2.8m and between 1945 and 1960 half a million emigrated. Frank Foley told me that on one Monday morning he saw 20 men board the bus for Dublin and England. Donall Mac Amhlaigh in 1947 earned £1 a week and his keep working in a hotel in Salthill. He later had a book on the Leaving Certiﬁcate Irish course, Dialann Deorai, describing the years he spent on the buildings in England .\n\nC H A P T E R T W O In the Beginning\n\nIt was into this precarious world that I was born where illnesses, nowadays almost unknown, could sweep you away in twenty-four hours. I spent a while reading the linoleum until one day I found a window and managed to stand up and see the light. It was Mill Street with people and shops and, way in the distance, the school. Then Burgess’s cows came wobbling across the Square from Barrack St. plopping their way to the milking parlour in Mill Street twice a day.\n\nThere was a face in the window across from me and I wondered had she just stood up too. There were people in the street and a big billy goat with huge horns and when evening came some men stood against the wall and smoked. Every day I watched and wondered was there more until Summer came and when I climbed the big apple tree, I could see pigs next door and hear them snuﬄing and grunting. When Morrissey’s big lorry came groaning up the hill the window shivered under my hand. I longed to be out there and when I was allowed outside at the shop window it was a huge new world and then one night at bed time Mammy said I could go to school next day if I wanted .\n\nI woke early and ran over Mill Street. There was a massive big gate but it was closed. I shook real hard but it didn’t budge. I started climbing and it was awful high, but I was a good climber. When I was at the top someone shouted, ‘what are ye doing up there?’ ‘Going to school.’ ‘Come down. Its not open yet.’ It was Ger Dawson. He put me on the carrier and wheeled me home. I told Mammy the school was shut, and she said, ‘not for an hour’, and I had breakfast.\n\nThey put me beside Johnny Nail and when the priest came he took him and threw him up as high as the ceiling which was ﬁerce high and we all screamed and then he put his arm around the nun, the priest I mean, and we all screamed even more and one time long after Johnny bit me on the arm. The next year a girl had her hands tied together to stop her ﬁdgeting and a year after that somebody’s Mammy came to school and gave out stink to the Brother and nearly hit him, and in ﬁfth class teacher asked, ‘how do you pronounce “s- t-a-l-k-s”‘ and nobody knew, and I said ‘stollicks’ and I got three of the best on each hand for that.\n\nThe woman in the window was still looking at me and one day I went over to Ward’s shop and looked up and saw it was only a picture. P.J.Griﬃn and I got dog biscuits somewhere and ate them at the monument. They would choke you with dryness. I did messages for Mr. Harty in the pharmacy and he rewarded me with a big spoon of Milk of Magnesia. I went to him regularly and I made ointments with the pestle and mortar. When I was big enough, we went to the river for fun and ﬁshing.\n\nFrom time to time ladies came to visit Mammy and talk with her. I could never ﬁgure out what they were saying especially Mrs. Walsh as I was busy watching the wart bobbing up and down on her chin. Miss Hunter was diﬀerent for she was delicate and coughed gently and spoke in a kind of whisper as if everything was a secret. Miss Howard came in from the country and always brought eggs in a big basket attached to her bike. She got shop prices and was very grateful to Mammy.\n\nAbout this time, I began to get jobs in our paper shop helping to keep it tidy and emptying the boxes of oranges and the small barrels of grapes which came from Spain covered in pellets of cork. There was a steady ﬂow of people into the shop, some looking for things they could not aﬀord, others for a free read, but mostly to pass the time of day and buy a paper.\n\nAs well as the locals there were foreigners too, Monsieur Garnier from France and the Bielenbergs from Germany and lots of generals and colonels and majors from England trying to forget the war. There was also Sir Standish O’ Grady Roche and Lady Roche who died this year (2019) in her nineties in Portugal. All had to be treated with respect as they put bread on our table and sometimes butter. The postman, Mr. Coady, collected a few papers each morning and delivered to special customers on his country round and they paid by the month.\n\nI swept the ﬂoor and the footpath and polished the apples and oranges to entice more sales and brought money to feed the Bank which had to be paciﬁed twice a week.\n\nC H A P T E R T H R E E The Slaney a Playground\n\nThe river has always played an important part in the lives of the people of Tullow whether for sport or hygiene, or because it can be a real nuisance or downright dangerous.\n\nWhen Michael ‘Mick’ Murphy of Snowball Alley went for a swim one hot day in Summer he did not realise how important it was to be as strong a swimmer as he was. On that momentous day he saved three youngsters from drowning, among them my niece, Orla and Michael Halloran and Elaine Hogan. What a tremendous feat of cool-headed strength and daring.\n\nAnd, in 1957, the late John Foley of Mill Street dived in twice, the second time after removing his clothes, to save a non-swimmer who wanted to join in the fun in what we called, for good reason, the Horse Pool.\n\nIn those days very few houses had running water and it was the height of pleasure to jump in after a day cocking hay or stooking corn. And if you had a bar of Lifebuoy, you’d be clean as a new penny. We had 2lb jam jars to help us catch fat minnows and elvers and maybe a gudgeon but next morning the ones we brought home had somehow escaped. That harmless ﬁshing took place at the bridge, but Health and Safety has put a stop to that now as the entrance has been blocked oﬀ during changes to the bridge. We now have the only bridge in Ireland with four footpaths, two attached on the outside and two mini ones on the inside, presumably for the fairies and leipreacháns who have been coming to town more frequently of late. I believe that a few more changes have been made to that structure since the engineers ﬁnished their work.\n\nDuring the Summer holidays we made the Ballymurphy Rocks one of our favourite playgrounds. The Rocks are part of a gorge that stretches from Byrne’s Lane down to Snowball Alley, probably carved by a glacier that left huge rocks strewn along the side of the gorge. The biggest rock is about 16 feet high and 16 feet diameter. Geologists call it an Erratic, dropped by a glacier on its way to Wexford or wherever glaciers go to die. We called it Finn Mc Coole’s table as his handprint was on top. When you reached the top and put your hand in his you qualiﬁed for some kind of distinction.\n\nFerns and furze covered the ten acres or so of wilderness, enough to hide a war party of Indians that had escaped from the Grand Central Cinema. We all wanted to be on the side of John Wayne with our search party. There was the remains of an old mill and a weir and a very tricky steppingstones across the river and somewhere up high a hazel nut tree that I could never ﬁnd but I didn’t like nuts anyway.\n\nOn the ﬂoor of the gorge there was a tennis club, just one court and clock golf where you putted to the centre from each of the hours in turn. We were not allowed in but it looked really silly. The players were the Misses Shore and Eustace and the Neavyns and Magees, whose brother, Frank, electriﬁed Saudi Arabia almost on his own. Under Toole’s house there were more huge rocks and a dark cave where the last sleeping tiger hung out.\n\nThe mill at Snowball Alley was out of bounds on the far side of the river, dangerous headhunters there. Instead we went to Mrs. Bailey’s for a mug of the most delicious buttermilk ever tasted. The Ballymurphy road at that time was made of boulders between and around which a yellow clay had been hammered smooth. John Byrne told me that when Tommy Farrell was doing a job for Ger Toole he ran out of cigarettes and sent Jackie, the brother, to get some in town. Jackie was seen on his way back carrying his bike across some of the more dangerous parts of the road!\n\nAs we passed the rectory we noted the tree where we tried to convert Donny Studdart. We tied him to the tree and interrogated him: ‘Do you believe in God?’ ‘I do.’ ‘Do you believe in Jesus?’ ‘I do.’ ‘Do you believe in the Virgil Mary?’ ‘ I do.’ ‘Aw. shucks he is the same as us. Let him go.’ Sorry Donny.\n\nThere was Tullow Hill on the old road to Shillelagh, with the challenging granite cliﬀs almost 20 feet high or was it 60? And the furze bushes that we burned in honour of Moses and on Christmas Day searching for the Rollos and jellies that Dad carelessly let fall in the undergrowth. The cliﬀs are unfortunately and unsympathetically covered over now.\n\nThe Mill at Mill Street was a favourite place for killing rats but Fenelon’s Mill was busy sawing huge trees and grinding ﬂour and when we tired of local industry we could view the world from Griﬃn’s ﬂat roof which was a great place from which to redistribute any loose snow that was lying around.\n\nTullow bridge was damaged by one of the many ﬂoods that tormented those living nearby. Every year the threat was there especially after a snowfall. The river rises in Lug na Coille and falls about 2,000 feet in the fifty mile dash to the sea. It’s a clean and fast ﬂowing river and a combination of melting snow and falling rain makes it dangerous and a constant worry. Homes and business in Bridge Street and Abbey street and Tullabeg were constantly on watch when the weather turned wet, and though sometimes only a foot of water came in often it was two or three feet. Losses were great but over the years people shrugged their shoulders and got on with cleaning the mess themselves.\n\nBut 1965 was a diﬀerent kind of ﬂood. There was lots of snow on Lug, then the rain came and a rise in temperature. The householders in Tullow watched anxiously till about one o’clock when they noticed the water had stopped rising. They went to bed and slept ﬁtfully.\n\nLittle did they know what was happening upstream. In Glen Imaal soldiers had been lopping trees and many of the cuttings had made their way into the Slaney and were swept downstream as far as Stratford on Slaney. There some got snagged in the bridge and became a barrier and a dam and then a bigger dam and ﬁnally a lake began to form.\n\nAround ﬁve a.m. the bridge collapsed and was swept away as a wall of water over ﬁve feet high rushed down like a tsunami. Chest-high water rushed through the houses and McCabes and Johnsons and Tim Donoghues businesses. Thousands of pounds worth were swept away a total loss with no insurance cover and unfortunately, it only took the council about forty years to do something about it .\n\nParody of the big ﬂood in Tullow in 1965 by Garda Joe Brennan.\n\n(Air: The Sea around Us).\n\nThey say that the bridge of Aghade is so fair that Kilcarrig or Tullow could never compare.\n\nIf its water you’re watching there’s nothing so rare as the muck that ﬂows down in the Slaney.\n\nTommy Johnson’s a tailor of fame and renown makes suits for the big shots all over the town, when the water ﬂowed in we all thought he would drown and be washed up in the mouth of the Slaney.\n\nTim Donoghue also got into the news when McCabes bullock swam out like a bloody big moose he busted the windows and out jumped the shoes John Monaghan is ﬁshing the Slaney.\n\nJohnny Cowman was stranded high up on the roof from the Civil Defences he stayed quite aloof.\n\nHe was trying to keep his oul pigs on the hoof and from falling back into the Slaney.\n\nThere was Jackmans and Forrestals, Mulhalls and O’ Neills, Byrnes, Manzors, O’ Briens, Lennons Jack Neills.\n\nIf the rivers could talk you’d hear some quare tales. O Lord put Your ear to the Slaney.\n\nTwo foreign reporters were anxious to know where the chickens and pigs and caravan did go\n\nYa will in yer Jerkin said oul Rustico and he threw them both into the Slaney.\n\nThe Square oh the Square it’s great to be there so high and so dry and fair in the air\n\nFr.Murphy holds up his right hand in despair for the Bridge is surrounded by water.\n\nA fellow from Carlow with too many wines swam down Tullabeg and ignored all the signs\n\nIf the poor lad had sense he’d swim into Dan Brien’s and the empties throw into the Slaney.\n\nC H A P T E R F O U R Bounteous Rivers\n\nFor some other people the river was a Godsend. It and the Daoirin on the eastern side of Tullow Hill were a very valuable source of protein and we all need protein. This protein came in the form of fresh salmon, thousands of them. In the early 60s electricity came as far as the Convent national school and in Carlow houses within a mile of the Cathedral had neither light nor running water. Anything that eased the daily hardship was accepted with a huge welcome.\n\nWhen John Fitzgerald was a licensed ﬁsh dealer he regularly collected up to one hundred ﬁsh from Huntington Castle and Ballynoe house and Altamont for the ﬁsh market in Billingsgate. When he lived in Aghade his man called him urgently one morning. He was ﬂustered and excited. Come down to the river! They hurried down, John wondering what was the matter. Look! Boss look! What is it? Can’t you see? Slowly John’s eyes adjusted to an amazing sight, there were so many salmon the riverbed could not be seen. That must have been when Frank and E.J. Foley counted 200 ﬁsh jumping the weir at the bottom of their garden in Mill Street in one hour and when the Gardai spent the days on the bridge to warn oﬀ would be poachers and when I climbed the parapet of the bridge and counted seven without my glasses.\n\nIt was not just in the Slaney and Daoirin. In Carlow Ken Tucker and a friend boated down the Barrow to St. Mullins trolling all the way and caught twenty-two good sized ﬁsh.\n\nA small trawler was steaming past Hook Head on the way to Waterford Estuary to ﬁsh for salmon. The Skipper saw a salmon jump oﬀ Slade and decided to try there next day. The net is let into the water like a wall, corks on top and lead on the bottom about twelve feet deep as the ﬁsh won’t go any deeper. Next day the half mile net (the length allowed there) was let out and the boat stood oﬀ watching. The salmon were picked oﬀ as they tried to burst through the net and the bouncing corks alerted the watching Skipper. At day’s end they had 101 salmon. Six years later the area was ﬁshed out. What they could catch would not pay for the diesel.\n\nThe Brod Sullivan and the Jesuit\n\nThere were huge numbers of ﬁsh available then in Kerry also. The Brod Sullivan had a BnB in Waterville for discerning ﬁshermen and was a well regarded gillie on Lough Currane nearby. One Saturday night he suggested to the priest who was lodging there that he be ready at 6 a.m. next morning, a Sunday. Nothing else was said, nothing about weather reports or tackle.\n\nYou trusted the Brod. They chugged up the lake to where a small river entered from an upper lake. The priest was put on the bank and told to ﬁsh away. All we know of the Rev. is that he was a Jesuit and that he had a very sound heart for by nine o’clock he had twelve salmon on the bank and four sea trout. The trout were each big enough to be mistaken for salmon. He had to stop at nine as he had promised to say Mass, probably a Te Deum. He handed over to a Protestant clergyman to try his luck. The 16 ﬁsh made a beautiful picture on the lawn at the front of Brod’s house and later on the front page of The Kerryman.\n\nThe Professor\n\nThere was great ﬁshing for sea trout in Galway too. The sea trout is thought by some to be superior to the salmon having a more subtle, a sweeter ﬂavour, very tasty especially skinned and coated in aspic with grapes for eyes and a few slivers of angelica to delight eye and palate . They run into rivers in small shoals six to twelve at a time in June and July in time to spawn.\n\nProfessor Christy O’Connor, Pharmacologist, of the College of Pharmacy, Dublin took his wife and caravan for a little holiday to Ballynahinch, Co. Galway. The caravan contained his ﬁshing gear which blended perfectly with the lovely mountains and lakes and rivers alive with fish.\n\nFirst he called to the Castle to the bar where the Bailiﬀ was ﬁdgetting with a large brandy. After replenishing his glass, he asked humbly if it would it be alright to ﬁsh for a few trout. That’s ok, but leave the salmon alone. Oh no, certainly not, just a few trout. The water level was perfect, and the weather too, just enough rain each day to keep the water right. The Castle was once owned by a Rajah who saw to it that every inch of the water was easily ﬁshed.\n\nThe Professor met a student from Galway University who was collecting ﬁsh scales as part of her studies and he was glad to oblige her. After 10 days his wife revolted. She was fed up sitting in the caravan all day and she wanted to go somewhere else, anywhere else. The rain was a Godsend, a once in a lifetime chance, but he yielded for peace sake and he checked with the student how many samples he had given her – she had samples of scales from 180 sea trout and four salmon. He could not stop the salmon from taking the trout ﬂies.\n\nOuragh\n\nJohn O’Brien woke at six that morning and immediately looked out the window. Yes, he could see the rock just peeping over the water. Perfect. He slipped out of bed. He had two hours to try his luck in near ideal conditions. It was time he had a bit of luck. He tried to quell the excitement..Not a sinner in sight. He cast out and felt a niggle. Calm down, calm down! At ten to eight he was home with two twenty pounders. Fish were scarce then and he got £100 from Clayton Love for the pair, equal to twenty weeks wages where he worked in the Square.\n\nJohn Cullen told J.B. in the Slip Inn that the most ﬁsh he caught in a season was 300. At £10 each he could buy a small truck for £2,000 and go into the calf trade which he did. The ﬁshing club did not want him on club waters as he ﬁshed full time. He did well in the cattle trade.\n\nFr Kaye’s Dilemma\n\nAt times it could be quite diﬃcult to meet a salmon and that was Fr Kaye’s problem. He badly needed a ﬁsh for Conﬁrmation Day – the Bishop was coming. He had ﬁshed on and oﬀ for ten days with no luck. Either the water was too low or bank high or the ﬁsh were plain sulky. He had tried his favourite ﬂy and a prawn and even a yalla belly but not an oﬀer had he got. As he worked on the grandfather clock he was restoring he explained his predicament to his wood expert, Pierre. He listened sympathetically and, when he ﬁnished for the day, said he would ask around town.\n\nA couple of days later, after Mass, Mary, the housekeeper, said there’s a message for you in the pantry wrapped in an Evening Herald. He carefully unwrapped a perfect salmon, about twelve lbs, with sea lice that told it was just out of the sea, no more than thirty-six hours. He lifted it and then noticed the horrible gash in the belly. It was like the tear you get in your best coat crossing barbed wire. He carried on and cleaned the ﬁsh- Mary hated the feel of a dead ﬁsh – and put it away in the fridge.\n\nPierre told him later that Jack Flynn, the gravedigger, had got it for him and was delighted to be of service. The Bishop too was delighted with his generous portion and the piece for his cat and complimented Fr. Kaye on his expertise. He responded, after a pause, that the hollandaise sauce was a perfect complement.\n\nHe thanked Jack at the next funeral, and he replied smiling that he was only too happy to oblige. Fr. Kaye opined that it was a pity about the gash in the stomach. ‘Ah, Father you wouldn’t mind that. It’s to be expected. That’s where he took the bait.’\n\nC H A P T E R F I V E Poaching for Protein\n\nAs I got older the river attracted lots of us especially in Summer when the water was warmer and there were lots of minnows to tantalise us. It was on the river I ﬁrst heard the word ‘poaching’, and later learned the following.\n\nPoaching is the most economical way to get fresh salmon as no licence is needed, no ﬁshing rod, no expensive baits and no membership of a club with rules and a quaint thing called etiquette It is generally a much quicker way to get a ﬁsh and there are no restrictions as to the time of day (or night) or the time of year. The basic equipment is relatively cheap. A length of net–don’t skimp it – mono ﬁlament is best, purchased a distance away from your target area – you don’t want your neighbour to know your business. It is very productive in the right hands. For the less ambitious a gaﬀ is usually 100% successful .\n\nAny fifteen-year-old Vocational pupil could make one for a small consideration. A champagne cork is needed for the razor-sharp point. Sometimes gelignite is necessary –in deep pools – but it’s not as easy come by as years ago. In the lower reaches of the Barrow a new method has been perfected using a strong light to attract the ﬁsh (they are curious by nature) and a harpoon made of two-inch wavin pipe to dispatch them. Again, any local workshop can supply a simple harpoon. Of course if everyone had money there would be little poaching done though at the time I was invited to poach there was no shortage of cash.\n\nA staunch member of the Board of Conservators – the river police – asked me to keep watch while he tempted a salmon with a gobble of worms when it wouldn’t take the ﬂy oﬀered. Worms were illegal at that time but sometimes Conservators are a law unto themselves.\n\nThe Slaney was a fantastic river for salmon in the Spring and early Summer. When I was about eight or so I was told to go to the bridge and look in. I could see seven salmon. How many more were there between the bridge and the weir half a mile up stream or the weir 500 yds below? That was when the river became for me a favourite spot whether for swimming or ﬁshing or just dreaming. Frank and E.J . Foley watched them for an hour from their garden below the bridge as 200 salmon jumped the weir. Frank stressed they did not count the ones that swam over it. The Guards were on the bridge all day guarding the ﬁsh and the bailliﬀs all night with their big search lights.\n\nThere were thousands of salmon, thousands of people unemployed, workers on £3-50 a week and a small number of resourceful ones who had the skill and nerve to get a few salmon to help out at home. Was it illegal ? Yes, but they say the rich make the laws to suit themselves.\n\nThere were plenty for all in those days. Are those your salmon in that stretch of the river or are they just passing through? Yes, they are heading upstream to spawn. One of the local Justices insisted on fresh salmon when he sat regardless of the season. Eunice went with her Daddy – she was twelve –to the river and held the light so he could see the target (it is an oﬀence to have a light near the river), and she remembers the bath full of salmon and the Parish Priest invited to choose. He got one and could he have one too for his dear sister? Then it was the Sergeant’s turn, and could have another for his dear, dear mother?\n\nSeanie, aged eleven, was charged with throwing stones into the river. (Its an oﬀence to throw stones into the river especially if it frightens salmon into a location more convenient for you). ‘I’’ll take you to court tomorrow’…..Seanie’s father. ‘No you won’t. I know where it is and I’ll lookafter meself.’\n\nJudge: ‘Why were you throwing stones?’\n\nDefendant: ‘I wasn’t throwin’ stones, yer honour, Sir.\n\n‘Well, what were you doing at the river?’\n\n‘It was a game, yer Honour Sir. We calls it ducks and drakes Sir, yer Honour, just like when a duck or a swan lands in the water ye skim the stones to see how many bounces you can get, and the one with the most bounces wins.’\n\n‘Case dismissed.’\n\nSeanie didn’t catch his ﬁrst trout till he was seven. He was eleven when he got his ﬁrst salmon, poached, naturally.\n\nMaria and her sisters pulled the net across the river while Seanie stayed on the bank directing operations. They were afraid he might fall in and they swore they would do it properly. He took away the salmon and said they could sell the couple of pike and go to the dance. Pike was a sophisticated taste and there were no takers with salmon available. Poachers had no problem disposing of ﬁsh for there were always people who had spare cash. A posse of bailiﬀs raided a hotel in County Clare, and they were just in time to see a small van scarper in a cloud of dust. When the fridges were inspected they found 90 salmon that could not be accounted for. In other words, they were poached salmon.\n\nThere were twenty boats ﬁshing for salmon out of Dingle and one of them had a licence. A deep-sea trawler had 10 miles of net on board when 1 mile was the limit. Generally, the Slaney poachers were small fry merely wanting enough cash for the baby’s cough bottle and 20 fags for their own cough. It is said there was a couple of poachers in Rathoe on the Burrin who just did it for the challenge.\n\nThe Authorities reported that in ’63, 3,000 were taken on the Slaney by rod and line but added that the true ﬁgure was probably 6,000 with another 6,000 netted in the tidal waters below Enniscorthy with seventy net licences in the Oylegate area. There are stories in Tullow of three horseloads of ﬁsh taken to the Dublin train, one to Milford via Kavanagh’s lane in Ouragh, another to Rathvilly and the third to the station in Tullow. Bill Julian prefaced everything with ‘If its lies I was told its lies I am telling you.’ But it is beyond doubt that there were thousands of ﬁsh available. When Seanie tried the Daoirin he only took six as he had to carry them home cross-country away from prying eyes.\n\nHe was generous too when working for Mrs. A. in Rathmore House. She had a problem. Her dear friend, Mrs. W., was coming and there was no ﬁsh in\n\nthe larder. He overheard her complaint and oﬀered his assistance. The Slaney ﬂowed past the estate and he strolled down to the big pool. He carefully lobbed a few stones into the pool. Yes, there was one there that darted into the weeds for cover. He stripped and edged his way slowly to the weed bed. He surgically slipped the razor-sharp gaﬀ into the panting gills and held him tight till he got to the bank. Mrs. A. was overjoyed and grateful but was sensible enough not to ask what kind of magic he had worked.\n\nSixteen large bottles\n\nJimmy and Johnny were perplexed by the severe scarcity of disposable income. They had carefully evaluated their respective prospects of a future but their immediate concern was a most debilitating thirst. Billy Mernagh, the builder, had oﬀered something to help but as he had 6 children they declined his kind oﬀer. They would wait till the big job started. Johnny suggested a refreshing stroll up the river as far as the Red Rock.\n\nThey left the Bridge and wandered nonchalantly up the hill and slipped quietly down Moore’s lane. Johnny paused to retrieve a short 2- piece rod from under an old sheet of galvanised. When they reached the Red Rock Johnny climbed the overhanging tree and surveyed the river.\n\n‘Jimmy, I can see sixteen large bottles down there. Don’t stir’. And he climbed down and rigged up the rod. The tips of the treble hooks glistened . ‘I’ll go up and try to get into that fella. I’ll drop down the rod to you, and you just hold on tight till I get down.’ The treble sailed across and plopped down gently. He drew it back slowly till the line lay across the target . ‘Ready, Jimmy . Say a prayer.’\n\nA sudden jerk and the river burst into turbulence. Johnny held on and then dropped the rod. As he climbed down he heard swearing as the stricken ﬁsh dashed round and round. He grabbed the rod and hauled him in quickly and ﬁnished him oﬀ as Jimmy concealed the rod. With a thumb stuck in the gills and the coat carelessly covering all they strolled into town by a diﬀerent route. At Mac’s they checked the clientele and then asked Jim to weigh it.\n\n‘And what would you be asking for that?’, Someone in the snug. Johnny was quick. At £3 a pound that would be £50. It was 16 pound weight. ‘The ﬁrst man oﬀers £50 gets it.’ The deal was done. ‘And now Mr. Mac can we have two large bottles and two large Players if you please?’\n\nIn the long grass\n\nBill Julian worked on the land where the wages were so low that the Government had to make a law stipulating a minimum wage per week. It was very hard to make ends meet and the chance of a bag of spuds and a turnip was little compensation for the hardship endured in the beet ﬁelds.\n\nHe had learned to ﬁsh as a chap and as he grew, he learned the value of a salmon. In 1957 he caught one weighing 29 and a half pounds, legitimately, and it was a record at that time of which he was justly proud. Hanlon’s in Dublin paid him almost 10 shillings per pound which meant a great deal to Bill.\n\nOn another occasion he was ﬁshing for trout above the bridge in Tullow. He did not care for trout, but it was a good way to see if there was anything else stirring. He spotted a nice ﬁsh close to the bank in the shade. He ﬁshed on slowly checking if anyone was about. There was nobody on the bridge. In 30 seconds the gaﬀ was assembled and he crawled forward through the long grass. There was a ﬂurry and a ﬂash of silver and he had him, a ﬁne cock with sea lice on him, just in from the sea and about 10 pounds. He covered him well in the long grass and sauntered down to the bridge. ‘Any luck Bill?’ ‘Naw, they’re taking alright but all I have is olives. It’s a sedge they’re on I think.’\n\nHe moseyed oﬀ to the hotel and parked the rod. Lifting a creamy pint he was thinking about the 10 pounder. When the bridge was clear he went back to where he had hidden his prize. He was there alright and so was a big sow fast asleep with the tail of the ﬁsh sticking out of her mouth.\n\nLar and Joe Keating\n\nIt was a balmy afternoon in July when Lar and Joe Ceitinn took a leisurely stroll on the banks of the Slaney. After a satisfying lunch it was the perfect place to take a constitutional, a beautiful setting with the water hurrying sweetly along to the sea in Wexford. The area was known locally as The Slough but little did they know they were to take part in an historic event. They paused from time to time admiring how the ﬂowering weeds swung and danced on the dazzling water.\n\n‘Hold on Lar,’ pulling him back from the bank. ‘See that sceach,’ pointing cautiously.’ ‘Yeah, what about it?’ They both looked, and said,’Jayzs! Look at the head on that!’ There was a big fish under the bush, and as they moved down a piece they saw the tail moving side to side at the end of the bush. ‘Jayzs, he’s huge!’ The ﬁsh was resting in the shade out of the hot sun. The brothers moved on a piece and chatted about the ﬁsh. It was very big and there seemed to be no ﬁshermen around that they could see, and it was a terrible thing to see a ﬁne creature like that and people hungry all over. As luck would have it they had no ﬁshing rod but Joe had the business end of a gaﬀ that he had forgotten to leave in his other coat.\n\nLar’s walking stick had a screw top that actually ﬁtted the hook end and between them they thought they might be able to do something. They lay down in the shade of the sceach and ﬁgured they could just manage through a gap in the bush. Lar slipped oﬀ his coat for ease of movement while Joe watched the target – it wasn’t just big, it was massive. ‘Right,’ he said. ‘We have just one chance at this. You be ready to grab.’\n\nIt was surprisingly easy. He leaned in slowly, carefully moved the glistering hook under the panting prey and suddenly buried it in the silver belly and hauled mightily. Lar fell on the Leviathan and lay on the thrashing body. The ﬁsh ﬁnally lay still and they looked around to see if anyone else had witnessed the historic moment for they were sure from experience that this was a record ﬁsh. And so it proved; when Frank Foley weighed it on his scales in Mill Street, 34.5 lbs a ﬁne cock ﬁsh. They knew of Bill Julian’s twent-nine pounder, and Ger Dawsons thirty pounder and Willie Nourse’s thirty-two pounder. This was the daddy of them all but they wouldn’t dream of bragging about it.\n\nEventually, it being a Thursday, the nuns might like a bit of fresh ﬁsh for Friday. It was Sister Agricola was in charge that day and she expressed surprise that it was selling it they were. When a price for half was suggested she was horriﬁed at how prices had risen and oﬀered a third of what they wanted but when she insisted on the lower half of the ﬁsh they looked at one another and gathered their prize and left without a word. They complained bitterly about how hard it sometimes was to deal with charitable people.\n\nIn Snowball Alley that night people had slices of salmon for tea the like of which was never seen before or since. And the next night too and the cats feasted on the five pound head for days. That must have been the time the Gardai were watching on the bridge for poachers all day and the bailiﬀs watching all night.\n\nC H A P T E R S I X Foraging for a living\n\nA Dillon lad from the Cross Keys went foraging for his winter grub in Vancouver Bay. There he caught all the salmon he wanted; he had them processed and canned in the cannery and stored them in his garage. When they were restricted to four each per trip, they took the baby along for her share. These were Paciﬁc salmon, all caught at sea.\n\nIn Tullow it was herrings they were after, and some people were anxious about the weather in Arklow. Then Tom Byrne of Barrack St. got a message through one of the two phones in Tullow and at 3 p.m. he hitched up his horse and cart and set out on the 33 miles to Arklow to buy a load of herrings. They were reputed to be the best herrings in Irish Waters.\n\nThrough the night on his journey home he sold to well-known customers and if there was a cup of tea going it was very welcome. When John, with sleep in his eyes, had fed and rubbed down the horse it was back to bed and be ready to sell on the street next morning.\n\nThis was the routine from October to January in the scanty clothing available then. There were no plastics in those days. Fancy standing in the street all day handling cold ﬁsh without gloves? After Christmas things were very slack and the pennies and indeed the halfpennies had to be minded.\n\nTom was a good gardener and had the use of a plot beside his own as the old lady was past gardening. There was cabbage and scallions and turnips and potatoes for the table, and they would not starve. And in March it was time to travel to East Wicklow and buy 7 or 8000 cabbage plants. These were tied in 25’s, 50’s and 100’s and sold wherever there were crowds, at fairs and matches. Likewise, for the Winter cabbage. And if help was needed for the hay or skulling cattle they were always available.\n\nIn the Autumn there were orchards to be picked and sold to Bulmers in Clonmel having ﬁrst made sure the crop was well bruised as that was what Bulmers wanted. Paddy Murphy drove to Piltown every Autumn with his crew of pickers including Haulie Brophy, Johnny Coogan and others. They shook the branches carefully and bagged the crop making sure they were well bruised. That was the way Bulmers wanted them for the best cider in Ireland.\n\nThe crew got home about ten p. m. with a ten bob note for their trouble. If your mother gave back two bob to you, you were in clover as that meant you could have six trips to the pit in the Grand Central Cinema or a horse-load of sweets. If a disaster came their way they just got over it as lá dár saol as when a lorry load of eating apples overturned on that terrible bend on the road down from Crooksling into Tallaght.\n\nThe Jackmans were in the herring business too and in the apple business but these were very seasonal, the herrings only lasting from October to Christmas. On one occasion the late Luke Jackman drove Frank Foley and two others to Arklow, but it was too stormy there so oﬀ they went to Courtown. Again stormy, and oﬀ to Dunmore East where 30 cran of ﬁsh was bought to be sold over the next two days. What a journey on those roads to tryto make a living. One of them showed me a ﬁeld of cabbage, every head of which was as big as a football. These were for the Dublin market where you would be at your wit’s end trying to get a fair price. Lots of families were very busy trying to provide one good meal per day.\n\nThe Dillons and Cullens and Jackmans were also in the cattle business, travelling to Castleisland and Dingle buying calves and weanlings that the Kerrymen did not want, preferring to rely on milk only for an income. Arriving back on Monday morning they disposed of their load and returned immediately to Kerry for another load. That went on for a couple of months on those roads. They were hardy men!\n\nWhen Autumn came it was time to scour the hedges for sticks and kindling. Tom Bolger did a deal with Christy Toole, he’d trim the hedges if he could have the trimmings. Christy had the best hedges and for years Tom had the best ﬁres. In Autumn there were mushrooms and blackberries and damsons. The Vocational school put on cookery lessons for distressed cooks whose jam would not set or who could not ﬁgure out what to do with an abundance of crabs. In Autumn too came the beet season.\n\nI tried to help my late brother- in- law at beet once. It was the hardest work I ever attempted and that was only half a drill. Among the ladies who thinned beet were Mrs.Dunne and Mrs.Gartland and Mrs. Doyle. The women were hardy too. In late Autumn there was beet pulling but only the hardiest and toughest could pull in frosty and damp weather. Those people earned their corn .\n\nOther people kept a pig or probably a sow. There were five premises on our side of Bridge Street that kept pigs and two of those killed and cured their own for sale in their premises. My neighbour, Nancy, after their pig was killed and cured, gave me a sample of her delicious black pudding and its about time that this delicacy got a cookery book for itself .\n\nHomes were busy from morning till night often with no electricity till the mid- sixties, with everything done by hand. You’d like a cuppa in the morning? Light the ﬁre. Where are the ﬁrelighters? What are they? How long does it take to boil a kettle on a little spark? Granny baked brown bread every day, and the hens got the leavings, but when Granny sold a doz. eggs in town the shopkeeper got as much as she did for all her trouble, just like the farmers nowadays.\n\nKnitting was another necessary cottage industry – gansies, hats, socks. Again the technical school taught how to turn a heel that would last a few years with care. A lady knitted a gansai with wool foraged from the hedges and it was water proof. Her father then built a spinning wheel so that she could spin whatever she could gather. Later the same lady, Jill, discovered that bags of potatoes were sewn closed with cotton and with a ball or two of that created a dress which she wore at a son’s wedding, and was the belle of the ball. Home industry was busy and creative in those days. My Mayo Granny boiled a big pot of spuds every day, as big as a witch’s cauldron, and what was left was mashed with a pounder, a tuairgnin, with pollard and other stuﬀ for the pigs and hens.\n\nSome people had other ways of surviving. A young lady in Carlow, on marrying, decided baking was not her forte and bought a small soda in Mc Darby’s each day and popped it in the oven at a quarter to six each evening and shook a small dusting of ﬂour on her hands. Over forty years his adoration bloomed, and he died slightly overweight but happy.\n\nIn Carlow Digger Kelly made handy money minding bicycles at matches at two pence a bike. With up to 500 people at matches no matter who was playing Digger always came out on top. And in Ballybunion chaps had a local delicacy for sale as the pubs shut – black periwinkles,boiled in heavily salted water and presented neatly in tubs, succulent heaven.\n\nMick Flynn told me his mother waited for him on a Saturday night and washed and dried and ironed his shirt for Sunday morning. An expert tradesman had only one shirt in those days.\n\nC H A P T E R S E V E N Bunnies for Dinner\n\nThe Rue Cler is a narrow little street in the centre of Paris within a stone’s throw of the Eiﬀel Tower. In 1989 there was a family butchers there with a magniﬁcent display of exotic meats of all shapes and sizes including pigeons and larks and pheasants and birds I did not recognise. What really caught my eye were the two pigs ears, spotlessly pink and hairless, like a babies, and below them four crubeens scrubbed spotless and tastefully presented. There was no sign of the rest of the pig but on either side of the crubeens were two perfect rabbits, pure pink with a see-through membrane exposing the organs, liver, kidneys and all as if they had just taken oﬀ their coats to show you. This was Paris of the wonderful cuisine in 1989 . What on earth were they eating? And when did we stop eating rabbits ?\n\nJohn Fitzgerald\n\nIn the 1940s John Fitzgerald started a rabbit business in Tullow. The countryside was overun with the furry darlings, and England was crying out for food after the disastrous war. Their navy was in ruins and most of their food was imported. No licence was needed to catch rabbits and snares were easy to make and cheap and anchored in the right spot the visually challenged bunny could be depended on to stick his head in the noose. There was little skill involved that was easily learned if you were not squeamish. For five good pairs you could get £1 which for many was a week’s wage. It was a common sight to see people wheeling bicycles into town laden with pairs of them on the handlebars, the crossbar, and in better times with an extension on the carrier. Two lorry loads were sent to English cities every week of fresh and frozen rabbits. They had built a cold store, ten feet by seven, said to be the ﬁrst in Ireland and it helped greatly to improve productivity and put money in the pockets of the hunters. A pair of strong working boots in those days cost less than a £1 (c.f. the glossary). Two vans scoured the countryside collecting from suppliers.\n\nSome hunters used a ferret, a vicious little animal like a weasel, which could mistake a ﬁnger for a sausage. You cover the burrows with netting and then introduce the ferret. This causes instant mayhem and they get caught in the nets trying desperately to escape. A killer punch is administered to the back of the neck (a rabbit punch). If the ferret catches one in the burrow you have a big problem as he will eat heartily and then sleep. He must be got out. If left he will cause havoc in the neighbourhood eating chickens and ducks and anything else available.The lady who looks after the fowl will be more than upset if the ferret is allowed roam free.\n\nIf you had a good dog — but what is a good dog? It’s a hunter, not one that looks like a hunter but a determined hound of uncertain pedigree who thinks every ﬁeld is his personal property. We tried out a dog at Bishop’s Cross, a Golden Labrador, a class animal called Rufus. A classy name for a classy dog. We took him into Caldbeck’s ﬁeld where there was a hedge full of rabbits. We got within about twenty-five yards of the target and he turned around and looked at us and at the rabbits, as if to say what do you want me to do?\n\nBut with a good dog and a strong man to carry a car battery on his back for hours and a powerful lamp you could tramp the ﬁelds on misty nights with maybe some rain and wind and you could dazzle the prey till the dog catches them. The second person rescues them from the dog. On a good night up to 40 rabbits. Pat Mulhall oﬀered to show me the scars from spilt battery acid. I took his word for it. He said it was a bad deal, for after a hard night of wind and rain and lots of money the pub beckoned and the stories began of their adventures.\n\nThe rabbit was a good friend to many. Arthur Keppel caught them at weekends, and they yielded as much as his apprenticeship with the E.S.B. A daughter of a star hunter/ﬁsherman confessed how, as a child, she was sick to death of rabbit dressed as chicken and fresh salmon poached or otherwise. As a schoolboy, in the late 50s, Fr. Ed brought five pairs to Fitzgerald’s and demanded 4/6 per pair. He settled for 4/3. It was the ﬁrst piece of paper money he ever handled.\n\nThe rabbits were an important source of income for many. We had it for dinner on Saturdays while it lasted. Eventually the myxomatosis or ‘myxo’ arrived and some say many of the farmers were not unhappy for the Farmers Journal said that six rabbits ate as much as a sheep and six sheep as much as a bullock. With millions of rabbits that meant a lot of grass was going astray. The myxo came in ’54 and Tom Bolger told of how he could see them from high on Ardattin church staggering along the road slowly dying.\n\nThen in ’65 the salmon disease came, a series of greyish white patches appearing on their heads and backs as they swam listlessly, high in the water, sometimes facing downstream. We saw a sick one as late as 2003 in the millrace at our house in Paupish. Around the same time, we saw an otter chasing a very healthy one up the millrace. In November ’17 we saw another sick one at the bridge in Tullow. But around 1962 Sean Lemass arrived and gave everyone a rise of 12% and saved the world whether they got up early or not.\n\nFitzgeralds dealt in game also, pheasants and grouse and anything the Dublin market would take in season. Jack Flynn turned up one day with a bird. ‘I got lucky Boss, down by the river, one shot and I had him. A plover.’ How much would I get for that?’ ‘Not much, Jack. Nothing only trouble. Did you see Mary Byrne at all?’ ‘Bedad, I seen her this morning out on the road calling someone.’ ‘She was calling her Bantam, her pet bantam and its dead, I think. This is a bantam, Jack.’\n\nFor Christmas they reared 400-500 turkeys in the old mill below the bridge and there was work for expert pluckers. As they plucked the feathers rose feet high and were cleared and packed and sold on. Tess Quigley was so fast that when they were clearing out one day, they found a plucked bird under the feathers – they were not quick enough removing the birds!\n\nC H A P T E R 8 People who made a diﬀerence\n\nThe Credit Union\n\nI met a man from Louisiana recently and he had an interesting story to tell. He was back for a short stay on family matters. He is a Professor of Medicine over there specialising in long-term illnesses including diabetes. He told me the Credit Union saved his life. After the Leaving Cert he qualiﬁed for college but he had no funds. He had an All Ireland football medal and was a brilliant athlete.\n\nDes Murphy advised him to try Boston for the Summer and if he played football a job would be no problem. He gave him a few phone numbers. When he approached the Union they listened and they ﬁnanced him for the Summer and in the Autumn he repaid them and had enough to cover the college year. The same next year and until he qualiﬁed.\n\nAs he said the Credit Union saved his life and that is typical for thousands of C.U. customers over the last 50 years. From tricycles to engagement rings the C.U. has facilitated their clients in every possible way with courtesy and eagerness. They have done most to make life less stressful and more fulﬁlling for the people who need the C. U. A pensioner said to me last month that the ﬁrst holiday she ever had was ﬁnanced by the Credit Union.\n\nJohnny Byrne and Lar\n\nSome people should be remembered for the contribution they made to the general happiness of the population. Johnny Byrne was much more than a garage owner and employed up to seventy people from time to time. He was in land reclamation for a good while and oil distribution with a second depot in Abbeyleix.\n\nJohn Doyle, tiler, now living in County Wexford, worked on the Paul and Vincent lorry delivering animal feeds and on the Guinness lorry delivering ﬁrkins and barrels of Guinness and was glad of the ten bob he had left after helping out at home.\n\nByrnes were also into making cement blocks and people were very glad of the chance to work. (When John Doyle started working, just out of Primary, he was paid eight shillings per week and later moved to Neavyn’s at ten shillings p.w.)\n\nLar Byrne, a son of Johnny, also made many people happy but in a very diﬀerent way. When he had success in business, he invested in a horse that Dessie Hughes had for sale. Dessie had had a run of bad luck but now everything changed. Lar named the horse Hardy Eustace after the former Master of the Carlow Hunt, Oliver Hardy Eustace Duckett. What a horse! He was brilliant and won two Champion hurdles at Cheltenham and the Sun Alliance Chase and was placed in four other Champion races.\n\nSometimes @ 33/1 people who knew – and Larry let everyone know – were very happy to have a good jingle in their pockets. And the neighbour, Mrs. Finlayson, made a few bob too. The horse won over £1 million in prizemoney.\n\nA local postman, who seemed to know something about horses decided to back his knowledge with a substantial investment that he had saved up and did so well at 33/1 that he had a heart attack and wound up in hospital in Bermingham festooned with wires and knobs and congratulations.\n\nPadraig Cunnane\n\nPadraig was ﬁrst and foremost a Mayoman with a heartfelt longing to kiss the Sam Maguire in Ballina. He did the next best thing by winning an All -Ireland for Carlow. His contribution to Gaelic football was immense for schools and for Tullow.\n\nOn the stage he was memorable for eighteen years as the Widow Twanky in the Christmas Pantomime at the Captain Murphy Memorial hall. He could play Cinderella or one of the Ugglies equally well if called on in an emergency. He shared the stage with Simon Ronan and Jimmy Barron and the great Richie Kavanagh. He also took part in the Talk of the Town shows for many years.\n\nTom Flynn\n\nTom Flynn was one of the greats when Tullow was at its neediest. He built St. Austins Terrace, ﬁrst known as The Commons. He later built Templeowen and also the Dublin road . He also extended the parish church. The local economy was massively improved as a result and the arrival of the Grand Central Cinema helped put Tullow on the map as hundreds came from far and near to be enthralled.\n\nHe was the ﬁrst in Ireland to import combine harvesters and when he delivered tractors to hard pressed farmers he was told, ‘I can’t aﬀord it Tom;’ to which he responded, ‘who said anything about money? You’ll make more with this and then you can pay;’ and it was said he was never let down.\n\nWe remember St. Steven’s Day and the free matinee when we brought our new hardware and caps to join John Wayne shooting those pesky Indians. Right little racists we were then. Crowds came from all over especially for such ﬁlms as The Robe and the Ten Commandments and Ben Hur. The movies were a marvelous escape and the longest queue went as far as Duﬀy’s corner.\n\nC. H. Finlayson\n\nThe Vocational School opened in 1953 with Mr. Finlayson as Principal and two assistant teachers and about thirty pupils. Miss Maureen Aughney and Miss Dympna Coen were the assistants. It was a momentous day for the people of Tullow and of the surrounding areas. He ﬁnished his career thirty-five-years later as Principal of the Community School with about 800 pupils and over fifty staﬀ.\n\nHe worked each day till 6 p.m. and all through the Summers except two weeks holidays and even then he often took work with him. Countless students beneﬁtted from his wisdom, his knowledge and his care. He was a powerful inﬂuence for progress and development in the region. His contribution will be felt for generations. He often contacted past pupils to advise them of possible openings.\n\nTom Hayden C.C. played a large part in bringing the school to Tullow. He cycled to Carlow for council meetengs and in those days there was no pay or expenses.\n\nMartin Fenelon and Joey O’Neill\n\nIn the late 50s Martin Fenelon of Barrack St. and Joey O’ Neill of Bridge St. spotted a big gap in the market. Farmers were beginning to have spare cash and they badly needed to upgrade their machinery. The two men decided there must be a chance of buying tractors in England and after testing the market they began to import second-hand tractors. These were landed at the North Wall in Dublin and usually driven down to Tullow where they were overhauled and oﬀered for sale. Prices must have been good for the business thrived. Later the business moved to Joey’s new garage at Tullabeg for the over-hauling.\n\nPat O’Farrell remembers driving a tractor while towing another oﬀ the boat through Dublin and down the Naas road to Tullow. In those days you had no cabin to keep you warm. Martin Fenelon drove behind for the ﬁrst few miles to make sure everything was alright. A mobile phone would have been handy. The tractors were David Browns and Nuﬃelds.\n\nIn ’61 land prices were £70 per acre and by ’71 they had reached £366 per acre. This was a sure sign of better times for all.\n\nJoe Dwyer\n\nI heard Joe long before I saw him as his scut-truck rounded the bridge with a grating of gears and a bang and a backﬁre as it struggled up the hill belching smoke with a dead animal of some sort sprawled across the open back. This was a fairly regular occurrence as was his attendance at auctions and fairs where help might be needed, probably for a small tip. He was walking over Mill Street one day with a friend and met another lady who said ‘Hello, Mrs. Mac,’ and passed on whereupon Joe said, ‘Isn’t it terrible about that poor woman?’ ‘What’s that Joe?’ ‘She has only sight in one eye!’ ‘Is that so? And I never knew.’ ‘Oh yes,’ says Joe. ‘She saw you but never saw me at all!’\n\nHe disposed of dead animals for unlucky farmers and didn’t mind if they stank after a couple of days on the truck. He cut hair on Saturday at his Salon in Old Chapel Lane. It was like a Greek Symposium with a bunch of the best liars in town gathered to entertain. Stories emanated from there that rivalled the best of Jack Flynn’s. Joe always had a smile and a willing hand for any improving enterprise in the town.\n\nThe Boxer Doyle\n\nThe Boxer was a local man who spent some time in the British army and was a champion boxer there. When he returned he helped out at the family bakery. They had a horse-drawn van to deliver bread and I remember sitting on top and the sore bum from the iron railing, Tom having the sack ﬁlled with straw for comfort.\n\nHe was an aﬀable man who liked people specially ladies and he had a boxing club going with Ollie Mc Grath and Larry Roche and Christy Roche among others learning the noble art. My brother Liam told me of the day Tom’s horse bolted. They were at the Convent when a dog frightened the horse and he came careering across Mill Street and when Dad saw what was coming he went about closing the doors but luckily changed his mind as the horse clattered through the door leaving the cart in bits on the road and his head over the counter looking at the ice cream!\n\nTom kept a few greyhounds and often took them to the races in the same bread van and they didn’t seem to mind the smell of the bread!\n\nArthur Thompson\n\nArthur Thompson was diﬀerent. He was the only watchmaker/repairer in town with an oﬃce in Bridge Street where he could be seen at his window, an array of timepieces on the table under lights as he worked away. When he came out his walk was instantly recognisable from 200 yards. He was six feet two or three and his long legs rushed up town as if on ﬁre and his broken cap and shabby coat caught the attention.\n\nHe had a beautiful baritone voice that needed a little training and he charmed the clients in Dalton’s many a time with a little persuasion and if his throat was sore a little more liquid persuasion was needed. His rendition of ‘The Bridle Hanging on the Wall’ was greatly appreciated but his dramatic presentation of the tragic romance of ‘Noirin Ban’ brought the house down as he fell on his knees in tears at her sad end. They don’t make them like Arthur any more .\n\nDonnacha Harkin\n\nWho gets 10/10 for his work restoring the Tennis Club.\n\nMichael Johnson\n\nMichael is the Tailor to the President and Proprietor of the oldest family business in Tullow from 1867.\n\nWillie Byrne\n\nWillie Byrne was described as the best angler on the Slaney. He could put a salmon ﬂy on your shoulder from thirty yards and you would not feel it land. He had an eye like a sea-eagle and a knowledge of the weather and water conditions that was unsurpassed. And if you were of a mind to take an ass load of catch down Kavanagh’s lane and across the river towards Milltown Railway Station to save the bailiﬀs any bother, well, Willie wouldn’t stop you. He had two favourite ﬂies, a Jack Scot and a Lemon Yellow which he had made in London.\n\nThe following is what happened one ﬁne day. When the conditions were right the ﬁshing could be very good. For Willie Byrne they were exceptional. He was fretting all morning and could not settle down to work. There was corn to be sowed and the weather might break and if it did Gods knows when there might be another chance, so he worked away, but still he fretted. He could hear the river noising away though he tried not to,;in fact he could see it and the gentle ripple on the water like corduroy – perfect for ﬂy ﬁshing – the wavelets hiding the steel hidden in the feathers; better still the cloud cover and the blue rock just showing above the water. Perfect.\n\nHis brother grumbled away to himself knowing full well that Willie wanted away and needing him to get the work done. They broke for dinner at twelve, but the spuds were not ready and Willie took his chance and headed down for twenty minutes or so. He was back in forty with two salmon.\n\nAfter dinner Peter said if it’s that good you might as well go, ‘It is; it is; I lost two more.’ He was back within the hour for a cup of tea with two more and he told his sister he had lost three others. He worked his way down to the river covering every inch of the well-known water and, at the Meetings he went up the Daoirin, his luck holding out till he was back at the house.\n\nHe regretted abandoning his brother but he knew he would be secretly pleased at the great day he had – eleven salmon caught and banked and eleven, lost one way or another. His best catch ever in a single day, and all legal.\n\nCHAPTER 9 Miscellaneous\n\nOur plague of boils\n\nThe plague that struck our town in the 1940s was a sight to behold. Unlike the present virus this aﬄiction could be easily seen in the body language of the victims who were mostly men. The man walking his bicycle, a cote de velo, seemed reluctant to hop on and cycle away but walked slowly as if thinking deep thoughts. Another had his head tilted forward and quite rigid obviously something wrong with his neck. There were others whose arms seemed to be stiﬀ as they walked along deprived of some freedom of movement.\n\nThey were suﬀering from a plague of boils that struck mostly men – at least it was they who complained loudest. No one seemed to know where it came from for in those days there was no Google to solve all mysteries. There were cures of course and amateur witches with the real cure, genuine. Would cider help? Is it a drink or a rub? How about bread soda? That was real magic. Or a poultice. What is a poultice? You make a paste of bread and hot water and place it hot on the boil till the puss, an ugly thick poisoned liquid, emerges and you then carefully protect the opened skin till the area is clean and safe.\n\nThere were no anti biotics in those days and all depended on those who knew stuﬀ from their secondary school days. The word spread on how to counteract the inconvenience for it was little more than that as there were no fatalities, just a lot of males with sore necks or sore armpits or thighs and bums. They sat slowly and rose slowly.\n\nI had three boils myself and I charge my grandchildren £1 to see the scar on my knee after seventy-five years or so. There was one on the back of my neck too and one on an eyebrow. It was very tender and caused me excruciating pain when I bumped it into the handle of a pot jutting out from a cooker as I looked to see what was cooking. It was a cure some witch had given my Mother. You boil a quantity of broom gathered from Tullow Hill and to that add a bottle of ale and cool. A smathan of that was taken on the way out to school – you weren’t released till it had gone down. Like the cod liver oil and other cures in those days it was disgusting.\n\nThe infection usually entered the skin through a cut or a scratch and looked for the hair follicles. There it went about its business infecting the area and raising a very sensitive swelling that could incapacitate the victim in bad cases. There was also the possibility of cellulitus and even sepsis developing. A number of boils on the body could be crippling and the only treatment available then was to remove the poison physically.\n\nBetter hygiene and diet would have helped but the town had no running water then and, as for diet, there was a war on with no fresh fruit available except in the Autumn if you had apple trees. Otherwise you scoured the hedges. We had a good pump in our yard where we washed but not in Winter. There was always the river of course, the Sandy Slane as Spenser called it, and a bar of carbolic soap, the chunky red one, could do wonders there.\n\nThe Slaney supplied lots of valuable protein from January to August each year in the form of fresh salmon. There was a superabundance of them to be caught or poached the beneﬁt being the same either way. A plate of poached salmon can be doubly beneﬁcial.\n\nOur little plague was as nothing compared to what Moses started with handfuls of soot thrown on the unfortunate Egyptians. It took more than boils to get them to mend their ways. It is heartening to read and hear now of how governments worldwide considering how governance of nations might be radically adjusted are to take care of nations rather than economies.\n\nThey could also set aside a day to remember the hundreds of carers who died trying to save the victims of the virus and those who struggled mightily for us and survived. How ﬁtting and wholesome such a commeroration would be rather than memorials that tend to honour the ravages of war.\n\nTullow Salmon and Trout Anglers Association\n\nThis association was set up in the late 50s . Its purpose was to improve the ﬁshing generally and to curb the activities of poachers. The members built about twenty weirs on the Slaney and Daoirin and repaired weirs as needed. The weirs broke up long sluggish stretches of the rivers and created water that would encourage salmon to linger a while.\n\nMany, many tons of rock were hauled to the sites. Salmon like water that is a bit lively. Overgrown banks were trimmed at the best spots for ﬂy ﬁshing. Farmers were approached to permit members to ﬁsh their waters exclusively and a monetary encouragement oﬀered. Membership was £25-£35 per annum, in those days a very large sum that excluded the less well oﬀ-teachers pay was then £9 per week gross.\n\nThere was free ﬁshing above Tullow and on Kavanagh’s land in Ouragh and later on Willie Shepperd’s. The principal drivers of the club were Fr. Kaye, M. Lennon and Joey Neill. When Fr. Ed. was joining Joey told him there were thirty-five members and thirty-four of them would need to be watched, and he wasn’t sure about the thirty-fifth one.\n\nAbout eight years later when Fr. Ed. was a curate in Coventry the curate’s got £1 to ﬁll their shared car with petrol for the week. It bought eight gallons.\n\nG.A.A. happy days\n\nA major factor in making people feel good was the performance of the G.A.A. , both at county and at local level. First there was ’44, a trip to Croke Park for the All Ireland semi ﬁnal. (In the year ’44 near the end of July the great Leinster Final was played in Athy. The horses came trotting down every boreen with their ears to attention for the Carlow fifteen.)\n\nIt was against Kerry. Bring them on we said, but we were beaten by what the faithful still say was downright trickery (but we still go there on holidays). On the big day a party of cyclists headed for Dublin in high spirits. Some of these had cycled before. There were Peter and Vince Fenelon and Mick Raftery and my father and a few others.\n\nMick was bet at Blessington but they persuaded him it was downhill from Crooksling. Alas the wind! It blew up the hill from the city forcing them to pedal all the way down. There were many casualties that day and next with many bodies found in haystacks.\n\nThere was another trip in ’53 against Mayo but they brought back a secret weapon from New York and beat us. The Junior hurlers won an All-Ireland and then an Intermediate which qualiﬁed them for Senior league. Their ﬁrst opponents were Cork, the reigning All Ireland Champions and we beat them.\n\nAmong the Tullow greats were Jim Archbold, Johnny Darcy, Chris Maher, Joe Nolan, Bill Canavan, Sean Nolan, Pat Brophy, Mick Donovan and the three Jackmans, and if I forgot your uncle he was great too. I’m told Josher’s father played in a junior Final in Croke Park in the early Twenties.\n\nThe brothers\n\nThere were two men who lived a mile or so on the other side of town, brothers they were, about the one age, who kept themselves to themselves, but always aware of their neighbours’ needs. If you were about to turn a ﬁeld of hay they’d be there doing the headlands for you, and the next time you looked they’d be gone home without a word after ﬁnishing.\n\nThere was nothing wasted, no time or words. Their cottage was neat and tidy, with their two cups and plates and knives set carefully on the little table. They ate simply and silently unless there was something urgent. They never went to town together or to Mass, the older going to ﬁrst Mass and the other later. Neatly turned out and respectable.\n\nThe older one took ill and died. The neighbours came in force to help, cleaning and dusting and washing and preparing the room for the wake. Cakes and buns and tarts and delph and all the necessaries began to arrive and when the body was laid out the chief organiser took the brother in to show him how well the corpse looked. He was thankful and uneasy and she suggested to him that people would soon be coming to pay their respects and that he should dress up a bit. He looked at her and then at the corpse and at her again and it slowly came to her that the one suit they had was on the corpse.\n\nTwo more men\n\nThere were two men whose marriages did not last. In both cases the bride was gone back home within a month or so. The mother-in-law was the problem in the ﬁrst case. She was a widow with a long history of getting her own way and wore a lot of black clothes lest anyone would forget her exalted state and spoke in hushed tones as if still shocked at her recent sad loss of twelve years ago.\n\nHer boy, he was her boy, was in awe of her and was seriously dumb. At the ﬁrst family breakfast the widow barked at the bride That’s not the way to boil an egg! The undefended bride wisely ﬂed.\n\nThe second man\n\nThe second man travelled to court his girl and she ﬁrst came to his house after a honeymoon in Killarney. She was a big-town girl unused to eccentrics. She discovered he was fond of rabbits, extremely fond. They were all over the house and the smell was overpowering. ‘What smell?’ he asked. ‘Oh, that’s only the bunnies, you’ll get used to it. They’re lovely, aint they?’ They stank! And the ﬁrst row started. They were in every room and did not behave like educated cats. And there was promise of more to come, as they behaved as nature intended. Getting them out of the bed was the most diﬃcult part but really it was the smell that drove the bride away.\n\nThere were two other men about whom there was an air of mystery. Both were well-educated people in steady jobs with good prospects and evidence of some prosperity for that time. Then for some unknown reason both stopped working. They always wore a suit but after a year or so the one who lived in town began to look dishevelled and shabby. The suit seemed to hang on him and he developed a sniﬀ which he seemed to use instead of a greeting.\n\nThe other man held his bearing and went regularly for walks in ﬁne clothes that seemed, if anything to improve as time went by. He held on to his superior manner too as if he had gone to a good boarding school and don’t you forget it.\n\nStrange phenomena in Tullow\n\nJohn O’Brien of the Hollow was a busy man. There were cocks of hay in Agar’s ﬁeld to be drawn home and an ailing heifer in the cowhouse. He was awaiting the arrival of the vet. when Nature took a hand, a helping hand.\n\nWe were on the railway bridge at Bishop’s Cross commenting on how still and close the air was when we noticed a cock of hay in Agar’s. It seemed to be moving, at least the top piece. There was no breeze and then a forkful rose and fell again and then a big wisp lifted oﬀ twisting and twirling lazily and rising slowly into the sky. And then another and another till almost suddenly the sky was full of drifting hay about 100 feet up coming across the ﬁeld in front of us and heading for the Hollow.\n\nFor about five minutes the hay drifted across, the whole cock en route to the Hollow, with only the butt left in Agar’s. John says about three quarters of the cock was dumped in the yard. A mini tornado had taken a hand at hay making.\n\nWhen Bishop’s Cross shook\n\nI was lying in bed one Summer morning –no school – thinking about a cup of tea, how nice it would be, I could hear delph rattling. Maybe I’ll be lucky. There was a noise like a heavy thump and at the same time a squawk like a very sick telephone call. ‘Are you alright?’ ‘Of course I am,’ ‘what was that noise?’ ‘A mystery.’\n\nSome hours later the radio explained, a small earthquake centred in Enniscorthy, 2.1 on the Richter scale. Google it. Phones in the general area had been disturbed in the incident. Apparently its a common occurrence.\n\nCircus – carnival\n\nThe Circus and the Carnival when they came to town brought a welcome break with colour and spectacle and excitement. As they say when you’ve seen one circus you’ve seen them all, but there was one Carnival I vividly remember. It was in the ﬁeld behind the Capt. Murphy Hall. Crowds ﬂocked to it for the two spectacular shows. It must have been Summer for I was out till midnight or so at seven or eight years old.\n\nThe High Dive was at midnight amid great tension. The diver was up sixty to eighty feet on some kind of scaﬀolding and a tank of water far below about six or seven feet deep.\n\nWhen the razz-ma-tazz was over the tank was set on ﬁre and the diver, who wore a kind of suit, set himself on ﬁre and threw himself down in a blazing dive into the tank to gasps and screams and tumultuous applause.\n\nThe Wall of Death was just as gripping and awesome. How in hell’s bells were they going to get those motor bikes to climb the vertical walls? We stood on top looking down on the riders as they revved and revved making lots of noise. They circled round and round trying and failing to mount the short ramp.\n\nAt last one of them got a few feet up the wall for a minute or so and came down again and then to a tremendous roar they were both on the wall, six or seven feet oﬀ the ground and whizzing round. The noise was deafening as one rose higher and higher near the safety wire and then he hit it just near me and fell and the bike fell too the wheels ﬂying round and his hand; all I remember is the bone sticking out and all the blood.\n\nCourtown\n\nCourtown was our Costa Brava for many years. The shops in those days closed for a half-day on Wednesdays, and many headed seaward then and on Sundays. Courtown had a sandy beach then, big enough for games of football, and spacious enough for hundreds to sit down in comfort.\n\nJohnny Byrne regularly ran a bus called a charabanc to the sea and early in my life I saw a two-horse stagecoach with passengers inside and on top. When Mag Keppel saw the sea for the ﬁrst time, she exclaimed, ‘Jayze, will ya look at the size of the f…en river!’\n\nByrne’s charabanc was later converted and became a mobile home, permanently parked in Ireton’s ﬁeld. In the early 70’s I drove our Volks with eight passengers, three chaps over the engine and the rest almost comfortable.\n\nA number of Tullow people had Summer homes there, soaking up the ozone. On one occasion when our family had rented a chalet in Ardamine my brother Tom and I walked into Courtown, bought a paper for Dad, hired a rowing boat and headed out the harbour for Ardamine. After delivering the paper we rowed back to the harbour. Life jacket? Unheard of then.\n\nOn day trips, Mother always brought a can of rice pudding. When cold it had to be carved out of the sweet can –delicious! We fought over the scrapings. You could buy a kettle of boiling water for a shilling. Lots of Tullovians went to the dances in the Tara Ballroom – they seemed to love music.\n\nLough Martin\n\nFor our Winter Sports we had Lough Martin which was a lough which formed each Winter between the Bunclody and Rathoe roads. It often was twelve acres or so, about the size of four football ﬁelds, and was mostly shallow.\n\nIn the Summer it usually dried out but in winter we slid around it in our hob-nailed boots. The only skaters were the Burgess ladies, Edna and Thea, and Rev. Studdart and the Hardy Eustaces. They had real skates. Eventually it was drained into the Slaney which in its way was ironic. It was on that ice that Dad broke his nose.\n\nWe also skated on the Square when a couple of buckets of water would put a good track on the road. In 1947 the Square was a great Winter playground after six or seven weeks of snow, and ice that lasted till May. The snow was pushed to one side but not before a bunch of us including P.J. Griﬃn, Patsy Fenelon and my brother, Liam decided to build a snowball.\n\nAs it got bigger we pushed it downhill to collect more snow and when it was five feet high it began to move itself and, gathering speed, it raced silently down Bridge Street. We gaped in awe at the monster and slunk home in case we had done harm.\n\nAround that time Patsy went sliding down the hill in his Communion suit. As he gathered speed he lost control and couldn’t stop till he hit the slush. His mother just happened to come to the door and witnessed the daredevil. She wasn’t annoyed, she was incandescent, and a very sore Patsy was ﬂung in the door and wasn’t seen for a few days.\n\nNed Farrell and Larry Roche had their own use for the hill. They found an old lorry tyre and climbed in, each taking turns to propel the other at breakneck speed down the hill using their hob-nails as brakes as necessary. Thrill seekers!\n\nThe Vice Squad\n\nThe Vice Squad was very busy in the 50s and 60s. A small group, about twenty to thirty was engaged in clearly illegal activities from time to time, especially at weekends, and sometimes out in the open for all to see. The Gardai were determined to wipe out this blot on the reputation of the Force and restore the good name of the town.\n\nThe vice had become endemic and unsavoury persons from Carlow had been seen lurking around the town. Whenever a raid had been arranged the group seemed to melt away in the dark as if forewarned, and then they would turn up in a diﬀerent location just as diﬃcult to surprise. As the years went by the older Gardai left the job to the younger lot and tut-tutted at the shortcomings of youthful enthusiasm.\n\nEventually a trickle of prosperity became a rivulet and then a stream until ﬁnally the pestilence vanished. The ‘School of Pitch and Toss’ had closed down.\n\n(Pitch and Toss was a gamble in which two half pence were tossed high in the air, and the participants bet whether two heads or harps or one of each would turn up. Even a fool could follow this game. Many did for years. One man lost £1,000 on a Christmas Day. Another unfortunate lost his farm, as he sold it bit by bit to feed his weakness. Edward told me he earned £18 for a week’s savage work in the beet ﬁelds, and lost whatever he did not give to the mother.)\n\nThe Children’s Allowance\n\nWe had no TV in the early 70s, as it was twenty-four hour snow, and to compensate we took our boys to Eason’s in Dublin with the Children’s Allowance. Government employees got a special allowance in those days, because they reckoned we were fecund and would people the land with obedient little taxpayers. Our boys could get six or seven books each, and it was easy to drive in Dublin, and Satan hadn’t yet thought of clamping.\n\nWe set out on our trip in our new Fiat 128 (second-hand), a real bargain. As the contented party set oﬀ home through Dame Street the Fiat felt a little sluggish. I stopped for a few minutes and tried again labouring up Christchurch Hill.\n\nAfter a mile or so I had to stop. I hardly knew how to open the bonnet, but when I did I immediately recognised the problem – it was the ﬂames! Small ones but real and surprisingly hot. Panic! Fire blanket? ‘Esther, give me your coat!’ It was a duﬄe, new, and she looked cute in it. It covered the ﬂames nicely as they ﬂickered away. Just then an Angel appeared with a bucket of water – Whoosh. Problem solved.\n\nNew problem – how do we get home? Paddy Brennan answered the phone. ‘Eugene? What have ye done now?’ He laughed. ‘Of course I’ll drive to Dublin and tow home a ﬁre hazard.’ I was a wreck trying to keep my distance from him and wondering how on earth we would pay for it. Maybe Paddy would wait till the cow calved.\n\nTullow and the ‘cupla focail’\n\nOle yawn from the Irish Áilleán = a fool. ‘Will ye look at that ole yawn and the cut of him.’\n\nFeac = a spade. ‘Where did ye lave the feac Jack ?’\n\nCruisteil = throwing stones. ‘Why were you throwing stones at the ﬁsh?’ ‘We weren’t throwing stones at the ﬁsh, yer honour, Sir.

His first book can be found on Tough Times in Tullow – 1940s to the 1960s\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nThe author was born in Tullow and taught there from 1969 until his retirement. He has had articles published in the Irish Press, the Irish Times and Business and Finance.\n\nHe enjoys searching the garden for seeds sowed some time ago. Most of the fish he caught surrendered.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis book, a companion to Tough Times in Tullow, is quite unlike it in many ways. Though the tales are from Tullow, they cover Bombay, New York, Paris and Berlin. There is a Prince, a Ghost, and a too friendly domestic rodent. Some parts are 200 years old and others a mere 40 or so, with a death or two and a birth and a life saving. There is something here for the most fastidious reader, and something too for those who prefer plain unvarnished truths.\n\nSo, take this book, turn off the phone and the telly, lock the door and enjoy bits of a life that has been lived mostly in Tullow.\n\nIt has been put together with the help of many local people, whom I wish to thank here most sincerely. Anne Twomey, as “editor”, has been exceptional, and my family, Fergal, Daragh, and Gene, and especially the one without whom it would not have appeared, in name Esther.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAlard Von Rorh\n\nAlec Twomey\n\nFear of Water\n\nOf Mice and Me\n\nBill Julian – Fisherman\n\nExtroverts\n\nThe Igloo\n\nWinter\n\nA Short History of My Body\n\nJack Flynn\n\nThe Big Cabbage\n\nThe Big Salmon\n\nMaynooth and The Haunted Rooms\n\nEconomic Theory and the Bikini Syndrome\n\nSkinny French Models\n\nThe Baptism\n\nSearching for Father\n\nSubmission for Military Pension\n\nCoincidence\n\nOn Fenit Pier\n\nThe Egg Head\n\nThe Mystery Man\n\nThe Pub That Wasn’t\n\nSport\n\nPorky was a Friend of Mine\n\nThe Teachers Strike\n\nThe Children’s Allowance\n\nNo One Died\n\nOsmosis\n\nLeo Loughney\n\nEuchid’s Headstone\n\nThe Just Man\n\nMinding the Shop\n\nThe Community School\n\n1. ALARD VON ROHR\n\nWhen Dr. Alard Von Rohr came to Tullow, Co. Carlow area in the 80s, he was house hunting, and he found and bought Newstown House, in Ardattin, a fine old Georgian building with about 20 or so acres.\n\nHis neighbour, Alec Twomey, soon introduced himself, welcomed him, and offered to help in any way he could. He quickly became his adviser and confidant. He was a God send to the Von Rohrs. Alard wanted to make some changes to the house and to build a vast exercise shed for his wife’s show jumping horses. She, Ruth, was on the German show jumping team and loved the sport.\n\nWhen World War 2 started, Alard, who was from Prussia, was quickly captured by the Russians and spent the war in prison. His 4000-acre estate was confiscated and after his release he went to Berlin and set up a very successful security company which eventually employed 800 people.\n\nWe met the Von Rohr’s through Alec, who was my bridge partner. The Von Rohr’s had a beautiful home with a magnificent bog oak dining table and chairs, seating about twenty and lots of candelabra and so on, that would remind you of Downton Abbey. Alard was affable and struggling a little with his English, but he was a natural joker.\n\nSome months later I got a call from Alec. The Von Rohr’s had a visitor from Germany. They had toured Ireland in 5-star luxury for three days, and on his last night, he wanted to visit a typical Irish pub. Where would I recommend? I thought first of ‘The Dying Cow’ which had featured on the front page of the New York Times, however it was difficult to find, even in daylight, so I suggested ‘The Fleece’ in Coolkenno, a couple of miles from each of us. He asked us to come along so he would not have to listen to German all night.\n\nWe arrived at ‘The Fleece’ early and were halfway through a drink when the others arrived. There was Alard and Ruth, and Alec, and a slightly portly gentleman in a beautiful suit with another man in the background. We were introduced, and the gentleman took Esther’s hand and in perfect courtly fashion – kissed it. When Ruth announced quietly, and it was an announcement, that the man was ‘Prince Louis Ferdinand’ – I was stunned.\n\nYou remember the photo of the Kaiser, Wilhelm the 2nd on his high horse with his steel helmet and the spike sticking up\n\n– he was in all our history books?\n\nWell this was his grandson, Prince Louis Ferdinand, the last of the Hohenzollerns, the Crown Prince of Germany. You remember the great Frederick the Great, whose exploits we struggled to remember, this Prince was a direct descendant and there he was, kissing my wife’s hand in Jack Carroll’s pub on a Winters’ night. This was no Prince William or Prince Charles; this man was History walking.\n\nWould anyone believe me? For the rest of the night, I was tongue tied. I don’t meet Princes very often and I am afraid my natural volubility was cowed in the awesome presence.\n\nThe Prince’s English was perfect. He had worked in Chicago for a number of years for Henry Ford with a view of being the Ford representative. for Europe. He had a doctorate in economics and was an author and music composer. He had been in close contact with the Anti-Hitler groups. When it came time to go, Esther received another gracious kiss on her proffered hand – rather like Audrey Hepburn in ‘Roman Holiday’. I offered her the back seat in the Volkswagen on the drive home, but she graciously declined.\n\nA couple of years later when we were at the house again, Alard showed us the Mausoleum he was having built for himself and Ruth. It was Greek in style, in cut granite, set among beech trees with branches tied back while building was in progress.\n\nIt fitted neatly into the beautiful surroundings. Alard knew what was coming. When Ruth died the cortege was led up the avenue by her favourite horse with her riding boots reversed in the stirrups. Within a few short years the major characters in the evening had passed away – The Prince, Ruth, Alard and their adviser and confidant, Alec Twomey. It brought home to me the brevity of history and the smallness of the world.\n\n2. ALEC TWOMEY\n\nAlec and Jo Twomey and their two children, John and Anne, arrived in the Tullow area directly from Massachusetts, U.S.A. They had decided Ireland might be a better place to rear a family and with that in mind had bought a parcel of land, 77 acres in Craans, Ardattin, with the initial leg work done by his brother Christy. A mobile home was installed for the family to live in, before Alec set about building a bungalow.\n\nAfter consulting the experts, he decided against their advice, and planted an orchard of 7,000 apple trees, Golden Delicious and Odin, and in due course they bore fruit for their expected 20+ years. How would he dispose of his crops? The Dublin market was rejected as they wanted a large portion of the profit, so he decided to sell direct from the farm. And he made it work. Many local people found work there at different times including our own children. There was the thinning in May and June, tying branches July through October and the picking and sorting in time for Halloween.\n\nAlec had left Ballyvourney, Co. Cork in 1947 after a spell in the Army and had gone to a cousin in Boston. His trip across the Atlantic was very stormy and he and three others were the only ones not affected, and they were fed lavishly for the journey whiling away the hours playing bridge, a game whose challenges he loved. His cousin in Boston guided and encouraged him and he soon began to prosper.\n\nHe started as a dispatcher in a trucking business, and worked his way through the ranks, then when his chance came to buy a local business he grabbed it and grew it to a seven-truck outfit.\n\nThe apple business thrived. Great care was taken with the crop. He could be seen at 4 or 5 a.m. spraying before any breeze got up that would cause spray drift. Every child who came with parents got an apple and everyone knew the ‘Apple Man’. A grading machine was installed to sort the apples and when the crop was sold the shed was transformed into a badminton court and roller skate rink.\n\nThe children of the area had a great time. As many as twenty locals turned up on Winter nights for games which kept them from hankering after town life. One Summer R.A. Keppels’ boat was sawn in half and an 8-foot section added to it. That operation was a sight to behold and was typical of the ingenuity and confidence he brought to every enterprise. To his mind everything was possible.\n\nWhen my Bluebird was developing rust he took it in, cured it by screwing a long thin piece of lath into the lid of the boot to facilitate its repair, and that Bluebird was the only one in the country with woodworm. When Christmas came he drove his tractor and trailer with bales for seating and choir of carolers around the town for charity. On another occasion we figured it out that it was his £50 note that turned up in a school charity box at a time when a tenner was real money.\n\nAlec started his local water scheme. He rallied the neighbours, planned it and built it, was carpenter, plumber, electrician and general go-getter for the enterprise. He was Von Rohr’s right-hand man, confidant and money-minder, ensuring that all money was spent locally. When his friend Charlie became infirm he got him into the Cheshire Home and when Charlie passed away the home was amply rewarded.\n\nThe above only gives a hint of what a power for good he was for the community. I am sure the people were greatly enriched by his presence and his activities in the area.\n\nAr Dheis De Go Raibh A Anam.\n\n3. FEAR OF WATER\n\nIt took a very long time to develop a fear of water, mainly because of ignorance and stupidity. There were warnings in plenty but as no one in my memory had drowned in the Slaney river, the dangers were not heeded. In 2015 I first heard how one strong swimmer, Michael Murphy (Mick, of Thomas Traynor Road) had saved three youngsters in the same afternoon. Well done Mick, how lucky you were there! My first dangerous encounter happened in the Slaney, in a harmless looking part of the river. Moving downstream from the others close to the bank was just an adventure until I felt the current pulling a bit stronger as the water became chest high. At the same time the gravel began to move under my feet and panic set in, enough to make me silent. I reached for a branch; it broke.\n\nAgain, this time barely clutching the slim shoot and slowly increasing the pressure and reaching up further. My pals had disappeared from sight and earshot. A foot reached out under the bush, a little shallower. The water was pushing me downstream. My foot reached again – unexpectedly shallower under the bank. The crisis was over and with more confidence there was a stronger branch and I moved slowly upstream to safety and climbed onto the bank, and for a half hour pretended it was a lovely day.\n\nOn a brisk hot day at Ardamine the waves were crashing vigorously on our bodies. It was very refreshing. It was waist high in the troughs and after a while the exhilaration paled, and I started heading ashore. The sand slipped under my feet at each attempted step. Again, and again it happened. No progress. I was afraid again, and it paralyses. I couldn’t throw myself in and swim as I hated getting my head under water. Luckily a wave threw me further in and I stumbled ashore. There was no talking for a while.\n\nThat silent thing happened again when three of us were fishing off Hook Head and having no luck. We steamed slowly towards the lighthouse searching for gulls and mackerel. After a while the waves seemed much higher than our little boat especially coming near the point. Then I noticed the lighthouse disappeared for a moment. That was one big wave, and then silence reigned as the skipper tried to turn without shipping water. Slowly but surely, we got out of danger.\n\nI was fishing from the shore on a summers evening at a place called the Coombe. It was a stretch of sandy beach a couple of miles long on the south coast of Wexford, east of Bastardstown. It was a heavenly evening and I was hoping to catch a mac"
