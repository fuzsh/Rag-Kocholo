        "text": "Eugene Swiney was printer, bookseller, stationer, newspaper publisher and patent medicine agent in Cork, his business possibly dating to the mid 1720s, and continuing until his financial failure in 1772 and his death in November 1777. He has been identified as Owen Sweeney, apprentice to Andrew Welsh junior (1738-d.1772), printer, bookseller and publisher of The Munster Journal in Limerick (see ‘Cork’s early eighteenth-century book trade‘, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). In December 1747 this Sweeney absconded from his apprenticeship and Welsh advertised his elopement in 1748: ‘Ran away on Saturday, 12th of this inst. Dec., from the service of his Master, Owen Sweeney, otherwise Eugene Swiney, son of Miles Sweeney late of the city of Limerick, but now of Ennis in the Co of Clare’ (Dublin Journal, 5-9 Jan 1747/8). He was described as: ‘about 5 feet 9 inches tall, red haired, but wore a wig, had on a chocolate coloured coat, blue waistcoat and leather breeches’. He ran with another apprentice, one Lacy, apprentice to Mr Alex. Guppy, silversmith, and it was thought they would try to take ship for Lisbon. A reward of one moydore was offered for his apprehension.\n\nHowever, recent research by Garret Cahill has suggested a different identification. In the mid 1720s a young Irish-language poet, Seán Ó Murchadha (1700-1762), was helped by a Cork bookseller called Eoghan Mac Suibhne (Sweeney or Swiney) who dealt in paper, books and writing materials, and who loaned him books to transcribe (Cahill 2024; Ó Donnchadha 1954, pp viii-ix). Two surviving manuscripts in the hand of Ó Murchadha are transcripts of Antoin Gearnon’s Parrhas an anma (The paradise of the soul), an Irish-language text published in Louvain in 1645, and Archaeologia Britannica, published in Oxford in 1707, both of which could have been borrowed from the bookshop (Sharpe and Hoyne 2020). Mac Suibhne was related by marriage to Seán Ó Macháin, poet and school master in Carrignavar, possibly married to Ó Macháin’s daughter, Nóra Ní Mhacháin (Ó Donnchadha 1954, p. ix). This individual is a better fit with Eugene Swiney’s subsequent life and work. Instead of being born about 1730, which is estimated for the runaway apprentice, his birth about 1700 makes sense of his two marriages and the son by his first marriage, John M. Swiney, who was an adult in 1768. A gap in evidence of about 30 years, from the 1720s to 1753, makes it difficult to be certain, and there is a possibility that the earlier bookseller was the father or other relative of Eugene Swiney.\n\nCork Evening Post, 21 Apr 1766, marriage notice.\n\nEugene Swiney’s first wife died in 1765 (Freeman’s Journal, 30 Jul 1765), and he was married in April 1766 to Miss Isabella Callanan, daughter of Owen Callanan, apothecary in Cork, ‘an agreeable young lady, with a handsome fortune’ (Cork Evening Post, 21 Apr 1766; Freeman’s Journal, 26-29 Apr 1766; Registry of Deeds 248 397 160458; findmypast.ie). Isabella’s brother, James Callanan, a young surgeon, died at the age of 22 in 1770 (Corke Journal, 1-5 Feb 1770). Eugene Swiney had at least one son from his earlier marriage, John M. Swiney, author of A new history of England (1768) and The juvenile muse (1781). John is likely to have trained with his father, he took over printing of The Corke Journal in August 1771, and he was the printer of The Juvenile muse: ‘printed by the author’. He may also have printed issues of The Cork Gazette from 1794 to 1796. Myles Swiney, printer in Cork, who subscribed to James Kennedy’s Modern elements of numeral arithmetic in 1759, and James Swiney, printer in Cork, a young man who died in 1763, may have been relatives (Freeman’s Journal, 15 Nov 1763; Faulkner’s Dublin Journal, 19 Nov 1763). Madden (1867) noted George Swiney as proprietor of The Corke Journal (1754-1769), but this is likely to be an error. Eugene Swiney died on 12 November 1777 (Freeman’s Journal, 13 Nov 1777; Hibernian Journal, 14 Nov 1777; Saunder’s News Letter, 14 Nov 1777); Munter reported his death as 1781, but this is not correct (Munter 1988). He was acknowledged in the Dublin press: ‘some years since an eminent printer and bookseller in Corke … However unsuccessful in the pursuit of fortune, he was universally allowed to possess an honest heart and most unsullied reputation both in public and in private character’, a hint that his business had already ceased and his fortunes had not improved after his insolvency (Saunders’s News Letter, 14 Nov 1777).\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing Main Street, and the Exchange or Tholsel. Charles Smith, The antient and present state of Cork, 1750, map showing Cross St and Fishamble Lane. Corke Journal, 28 Nov 1754, colophon.\n\nNo concrete evidence is available for Swiney’s business until he began printing The Corke Journal newspaper in December 1753 (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753). He led a peripatetic existence, moving his printing office and bookshop every few years, but always staying ‘near the Exchange’. The Exchange, or Tholsel, was situated in Castle Street where it jutted onto Main Street, it was a prestigious building housing the merchant’s exchange, legal and civil administration. In 1753 his bookshop was in Paul Street, and from November 1754 at the sign of the Peacock in Cross Street, near Broad Lane: ‘Removed his printing office to the Old Assembly Room at the Peacock in Cross Street, where he takes in all manner of printing work, as usual’ (Corke Journal, 28 Nov 1754). Cross Street, running parallel to Main Street, from Broad Lane to the Exchange, was just off the centre of the Cork book trade in Castle Street, but close enough to the Exchange to make business profitable, and he noted this proximity when advertising his shop as near the Exchange. In August 1757 he announced his move to the shop formerly occupied by bookseller Timothy Cronin under the English Coffee House near the Exchange (Corke Journal, 1 Aug 1757; 29 Sep 1757). Cronin had died on 10 June 1757 and Swiney had taken over the bookshop by August, where he hoped for the friends of Mr Cronin to continue their dealings with that shop, and he was empowered by the executors to collect the debts owing to Timothy Cronin (Corke Journal, 13 Jun 1757; 1 Aug 1757; 7 Nov 1757). In May 1759 he advertised the Assembly Room to be let, indicating that it would be suitable for a dancing master, by August the Corke Journal carried an advertisement for Richard Ellis, dancing master, at the Assembly Room at the sign of the Peacock (Corke Journal, 31 May 1759; 18 June 1759; 23 Aug 1759). By early 1761 Swiney advertised his shop and dwelling house, near the Exchange, to be let, and by May his printing office was no longer ‘under the English Coffee House’, but still near the Exchange (Corke Journal, 15 Jan 1761; 21 May 1761). In 1770 Swiney’s bookshop and printing office were in different locations a short distance apart, he gave notice that he had moved entirely from his shop on Main Street, facing the Exchange, to his dwelling house and printing office in nearby Fishamble Lane (now Liberty Street) where he would continue the bookselling business (Corke Journal, 12-15 Mar 1770). In his advertisement he appended a list of discounted titles, which he would sell at wholesale prices (Corke Journal, 26-29 Mar 1770). His old shop ‘the noted shop lately held by Mr Eugene Swiney, printer and bookseller, opposite the Exchange’ continued as a bookshop occupied by Thomas White (1766-d.1803) (Hibernian Chronicle, 8 Mar 1770; Corke Journal, 12-15 Mar 1770). A crisis came for Swiney in April 1770 when he was owed so much that he was unable to pay his own creditors ‘for the present’ (Corke Journal, 28-30 Apr 1770). He was forced to ‘shut up his doors’, but as he intended to continue printing the paper and to take in advertisements, it must have been the bookshop which was closed. Swiney was listed among insolvent debtors in March 1772 and his business does not seem to have continued after this setback, with publication of the Corke Journal not recorded beyond January 1772, and only one text printed in that year (Dublin Gazette, 10-12 March 1772).\n\nBOOKSHOP:\n\nEvidence for Swiney’s bookshop in Paul Street, at the Peacock in Cross Street, under the English Coffee House, on Main Street facing the Exchange, and finally in Fishamble Lane, comes from advertising in The Corke Journal, from catalogues printed in his publications, and from the imprints of his printed titles, and dates from 1753. The earlier shop of Eoghan Mac Suibhne sold ‘paper, books, and writing materials’ in the 1720s (Ó Donnchadha 1754, p. ix). No notice of the business survives in the interim period, there is no advertising due to the lack of local newspapers, and his first printing projects date to 1753. Advertising from 1753 and 1754 points to a full scale established business of printing and bookselling, and does not suggest a newly opened enterprise. Swiney offered a wide range of books, monthly magazines, newspaper subscriptions, stationery, paper and ink, patent medicines, tickets for the Theatre Royal, Dunscomb’s Marsh, and engraved prints.\n\nIn 1753 Swiney was selling, on behalf of the owner, a large collection of curious French copper plate prints, imported and to be sold ‘either fram’d or glaz’d in sheets’ (Corke Journal, 11 Dec 1753). He offered a ‘whole length metzotinto print’ of the King of Prussia (Frederick II) in 1757 for a British shilling (1s.1d. Irish) (Corke Journal, 13 Jun 1757). This was accompanied by the King’s Plan for reforming the administration of justice, selling for a British sixpence (6½d. Irish), and at the same time in the Corke Journal Swiney printed ‘The confession of faith by the King of Prussia’, reprinted from one of the London papers (Corke Journal, 13 Jun 1757). In 1754 he took subscriptions for the Dublin newspapers and in 1767 he was agent for the newly established Finn’s Leinster Journal, published by Edmund Finn in Kilkenny (Corke Journal, 3 Jun 1754; Cork Evening Post, 19 Jan 1767; Finn’s Leinster Journal, 27-31 Aug 1768). He supported a new venture by Thomas Bond, who had set up his paper mill at Riverstown, Co Cork, and in 1754 Swiney agreed to use his paper products for printing the Corke Journal, and other printed works (Cork Journal, 11 Nov 1754; 2 Jan 1755). However, he continued to import paper and he offered his imported fine and coarse paper for writing and account books in 1758, and opened his Paper Ware-House in November 1758, where he sold a variety of writing and printing paper, selling at wholesale rates to town and country dealers (Corke Journal, 25 May 1758; 13 Nov 1758).\n\nEphemeral items such as monthly and annual publications formed a significant part of his stock, slim volumes which could be distributed to customers by the newspaper carriers. He stocked the annual Watson’s Almanack, printed in Dublin by John Watson, John Exshaw’s edition of The English Registry, and the monthly periodicals The Gentleman’s and London Magazine, reprinted in Dublin by Exshaw, selling for a British sixpence (6½d. Irish) per issue, and Peter Wilson’s Dublin Magazine, established in 1762, and sold by Swiney and John Bardin in Cork (Corke Journal, 16 Jan 1758; 30 Mar 1758; 7 May 1759; 11 Oct 1759; 5 Jan 1761; 15 Feb 1762; 2-4 Feb 1765). He sold The Freeholder’s Magazine; or monthly chronicle of liberty by a Patriotic Society, issued in London in 1770 priced at sixpence per monthly issue (Corke Journal, 15-18 Jan 1770). He advertised as just published John Scanlan’s Book almanack, calculated for the meridian of Cork, and Cork sheet almanack, sold by wholesale or retail at Dublin prices, and country chapmen would be supplied on reasonable terms (Corke Journal, 21-24 Oct 1765). Like many provincial booksellers he stocked a number of patent medicines, such as Brenan of London’s famous Eye Water, costing a half crown English for a large bottle, and a smaller bottle for 1s.6½d. English; fresh German Spa Water in large and small flasks; Dr Storie’s famous worm-destroying sugar-cakes, selling for 1s.1d. per box with directions for use; Violet of Strasbourg’s rapee snuff in pound canisters; and Pilula Salutaria medication for scurvy, orders for which could be placed with the newspaper carriers (Corke Journal, 6 Jan 1757; 1 Aug 1757; 12 Jun 1758; 29 Jun 1758; 2 Nov 1758; 27 Jul 1761).\n\nStock catalogues:\n\nHis book stock included his own printings, and a variety of Dublin publications ranging from pamphlets to expensive multi volume works published by subscription. Swiney took the opportunity of publishing short catalogues of his book stock on the final leaves of his own publications, such as his 1761 editions of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus, Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet. This acted as a shop window, highlighting some of his steady sellers, such as school books and plays, but also promoting some of his more expensive titles. One two-page catalogue has been replicated in different publications, for example the same list appears in 1761 in his edition of James Greenwood’s Grammar, at the end of Coriolanus and Macbeth, and in 1769 in Corderius’s Colloquies. The catalogue of 69 titles does not give places of publication or prices. There is a strong emphasis on school books, but expensive literary works are present, giving the readers of Cork the opportunity to inspect the new works and purchase them locally. Among the most important were Charles Rollin’s Ancient history in 13 volumes, his Roman history in 16 volumes and his Belles Lettres in four volumes, eight volumes of The Spectator, Alexander Pope’s Homer in six volumes, Works in five volumes and Letters in two volumes, and Don Quixote in four volumes. Jonathan Swift was represented by nine volumes of his Works and Lord Orrery’s Remarks on Swift. The catalogue in Macbeth (1761) included an additional page listing 43 plays, some of which were printed by Swiney that year.\n\nJames Greenwood, Grammar, 1761, book lists. Macbeth, 1761, list of plays. Corke Journal, 26-29 Mar 1770, advertisement.\n\nIndividual titles were advertised in the Corke Journal, and occasionally he ran advertisements for a larger selection of titles from his stock (Corke Journal, 8 Sep 1760; 4-8 Dec 1766; 29 Mar-2 Apr 1770). A list of seven new books was advertised in 1761, made up of The history of Frederick the forsaken, two volumes neatly bound for 2s.8½d., The sermons of Mr Yorick, two volumes for 2s.8½d., Moral and political dialogues by Mr Hurd for 2s.8½d., A collection of letters of the late Revd. Mr James Harvey, two volumes for 5s.5d., Conversations on the plurality of worlds by M. de Fontenelle for 2s.8½d., A treatise on the diseases of horses by W. Osmer for 2s.2d., and Philip Miller’s new Gardener’s calendar for 2s.8½d. (Corke Journal, 27 Apr 1761). This accompanied an advertisement for a range of pamphlets such as An account of that unfortunate young lady Miss Bell otherwise Sharpe (6½d.), the Earl of Egmont’s Things as they are (6½d.), George Colman’s The jealous wife, a comedy (6½d.), Some cautions offered to the confederation of those who are to chuse members to serve in the ensuing parliament (4d.), and A full and candid answer to a pamphlet intituled Considerations on the present German war (6½d.). A separate advertisement appeared for Isaac Watt’s Compleat spelling book in three parts for 1s.8d., and he offered ‘proper encouragement will be given to country chapmen, or those who buy a quantity’ (Corke Journal, 27 Apr 1761). In December 1766 Swiney advertised a larger selection of his book stock in the Corke Journal, ‘just published and to be sold by the printer hereof’ (Corke Journal, 4-8 Dec 1766). The titles were popular and current, the list of 158 books gave a flavour of his offering, although places of publication and prices were not given. Prominent were school books, especially Latin classics, dictionaries, novels, including Samuel Richardson’s Clarissa in eight volumes, and Pamela in four volumes, Tobias Smollett’s Peregrine Pickle in four volumes and his translation of Don Quixote in two volumes, Alain-René Le Sage’s Gil Blas in four volumes, The Jewish spy by the Marquis D’Argens in five volumes, The Turkish spy in eight volumes, poems by Robert Dodsley, Alexander Pope, Matthew Prior and James Thomson, essays and literary works, building and architecture, drawing and painting, history and voyages, Nature displayed in seven volumes, Owen’s Dictionary of arts and sciences in four volumes, Love in a village, a ballad opera by Thomas Arne, with music, and three volumes of Marmontel’s Tales in French.\n\nCorke Journal, 12-15 Mar 1770, 26-29 Mar 1770, advertisements.\n\nIn 1770, with the announcement of the closure of his bookshop on Main Street, opposite the Exchange, and its move to Fishamble Lane, Swiney published a list of 121 books to be sold at wholesale prices (Corke Journal, 29 Mar-2 Apr 1770). The list was comprised of school books and Latin classics, religious works, including bibles, testaments, catechisms and sermons, medical texts, novels, history, gardening, essays and literature, prices ranging from 1s.1d. for his own 1756 printing of J. Daubichon’s French exercises, to £1.10s. for Philip Miller’s Gardener’s dictionary. The acclaimed novels of Samuel Richardson were on the list: Sir Charles Grandison in seven volumes for 19s.6d., Clarissa in seven volumes for 15s.2d. and Pamela in four volumes for 8s.8d. Literary works included Jonathan Swift’s Works in nine volumes for 19s.6d., his Letters in three volumes for 6s.6d. and his Poems for 2s.2d., Oliver Goldsmith’s Essays for 2s.2d., Michel de Montaigne’s Essays in four volumes for 10s.10d., and Charles Rollin’s Belles Lettres in four volumes for 8s.8d. Swiney did not give edition information, but many of these titles were probably Dublin editions, with some London and Cork editions, while copies of Juvenal’s Satires were given as the Paris edition for 4s.10½d., and the London edition for 5s.5d.\n\nReligious works:\n\nReligious titles of Catholic interest formed a significant part of his stock. In 1756 Lewis de Granada, A memorial of a Christian life, was sold by Swiney. The printer is not named but the text was approved by Nicholas Barron, S. J., and Richard Walsh, Catholic bishop of Cork, dated 5 October 1756, so it is likely to be a Cork printing (Fenning 1995). John Gother’s The sincere Christian’s guide to the choice of religion, was printed in London in 1758 by Thomas Meighan, Catholic printer in Drury Lane, and sold by E. Swiney in Cork. Swiney cooperated with Patrick Lord, Catholic printer in Dublin, on a number of publications. Swiney’s own 1755 printing of Charles O’Conor’s The case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, was first printed by Lord in Dublin, but the Cork edition was suppressed by the city council (Corke Journal, 30 Jun 1755). A two penny pamphlet, An appeal to the Lord Primate of all Ireland; being a short vindication of the political principles of Roman Catholics by an Honest Free-Thinker was advertised in January 1758 (Corke Journal, 12 Jan 1758). The 22 page octavo was printed by Lord in 1757. The Corke Journal carried pre-publication advertisements for Lord’s edition of An essay on the antient and modern state of Ireland as ‘in the press and speedily will be publish’d’ in 1759. It came out ‘publish’d by the printer hereof’ in 1760, priced at 1s.1d. (Corke Journal, 5 Nov 1759; 4 Feb 1760). The first, second and third letters of Henry Brooke’s The farmer’s case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, printed by Lord in Dublin and sold by Swiney in Cork in 1760, were advertised for 3d. each (Corke Journal, 21 Apr 1760).\n\nPlays and farces:\n\nTheatrical life was quite vibrant in Cork in the 1750s and 1760s as players from the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, and later members of Crow Street Theatre, came to perform in Cork in the summer / autumn seasons (Clark 1965, pp 69-145). Swiney printed advertisements in the Corke Journal for theatrical performances and benefits, and he sold tickets for the theatre (Corke Journal, 22 Aug 1754; 2 Sep 1754; 5 Sep 1754; 7 Aug 1755). He carried a large stock of plays and farces, mostly printed in Dublin, and printed his own editions of certain plays. A new theatre was constructed on George’s Street (now the General Post Office, Oliver Plunkett Street) in 1760, replacing the old Theatre Royal, Dunscomb’s Marsh. Printed plays were steady sellers, especially those that had become popular after performances in London at Covent Garden or Drury Lane. A cast list, featuring the big names of the day, was generally printed at the beginning of the text. Play texts usually came to about 60 to 80 pages, printed in pocket sized duodecimo format, and selling for 6½d. for plays and 3d. for farces (Corke Journal, 8 Sep 1760). In addition to attending theatrical performances readers read plays for pleasure, and sometimes performed them in family settings. In 1760 Swiney advertised all the plays and farces performed in the previous season at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, and in the current season in Cork (Corke Journal, 8 Sep 1760). In 1761 he advertised a new publication by former manager of the Theatre Royal in Dublin, Benjamin Victor, The history of the theatres of London and Dublin, from the year 1730 to the present time, two volumes bound in one, in duodecimo format, for 3s.9½d. (Corke Journal, 2 Jul 1761). It contained a register of all the plays performed at the Theatres Royal in London from 1712. First published in London in 1761, this edition was reprinted in Dublin by George Faulkner and John Exshaw in the same year\n\nCorke Journal, 26 Aug 1754, advertisement for Romeo and Juliet. Arthur Murphy, All in the wrong, 1762, title page and cast list.\n\nAmong the cheap publications sold at his bookshop in 1757, he advertised two plays in duodecimo format and a book for children (Corke Journal, 21 Jul 1757). The plays were new, first performed in London at Drury Lane and Covent Garden respectively in February and March 1757. Samuel Foote’s The author, a comedy of two acts, was priced at 3d., and was certainly the edition printed for Peter Wilson and William Sleater in Dublin in 1757, and John Home’s Douglas, a tragedy, probably the edition printed by George Faulkner in Dublin in 1757, was selling for 6½d., Swiney printed his own edition of Douglas in 1762. Both plays were performed in Cork at the Theatre Royal in Dunscomb’s Marsh in the following two seasons, The author accompanied a performance of Coriolanus on 11 September 1758, and Douglas played on 17 August 1759 and again on 9 October 1760 (Corke Journal, 11 Sep 1758; 16 Aug 1759; 6 Oct 1760). A curious sales strategy was employed for the sale of A lottery-book for children, ‘containing a new method of playing them into a knowledge of their letters’. It was neatly bound and gilt, and embellished with 26 cuts. Swiney offered it gratis to little masters and misses, just charging 3d. for the binding.\n\nHe advertised a new comedy by Arthur Murphy in 1760, The way to keep him, selling for 6d. (Corke Journal, 13 Oct 1760; 3 Nov 1760). Published in London that year, it was reprinted in Dublin by a group of booksellers. It was performed in Cork in 1762. Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher’s The humorous lieutenant, a tragic-comedy, performed at the Theatre Royal in Crow Street, Dublin, was printed by Peter Wilson in 1761 and advertised by Swiney for 6½d. (Corke Journal, 19 Feb 1761). George Colman’s The jealous wife, a comedy first performed in Drury Lane in 1761, was printed in London and reprinted in Dublin by a large group of booksellers within the year, and advertised by Swiney for 6½d. (Corke Journal, 27 Apr 1761).\n\nBest selling titles:\n\nHe was selling William Smith’s A review of the military operations in North America, from the commencement of the French hostilities on the frontiers of Virginia in 1753 to 1756 for 2s.2d., sewed in blue paper (Corke Journal, 21 Jul 1757). This topical work was first printed in London in 1757, with a reissue in Dublin, printed for Peter Wilson and John Exshaw, later that year. The Dublin edition reputedly included additional papers not contained in the London edition. A volume aimed at country gentlemen, merchants and traders, Every man his own lawyer; or, a summary of the laws now in force in Ireland, in a new and instructive method, was printed in Dublin by and for Oliver Nelson and Peter Wilson in 1755. Swiney advertised it in 1757 for four British shillings (4s.4d. Irish) bound (Corke Journal, 8 Sep 1757; 29 Jun 1758). He offered The history of the Swedish Countess of Gyllemberg by C. F. Gellert in 1758 for 1s.1d. sewed in blue paper and 1s.7½d. bound (Corke Journal, 29 Jun 1758). It was translated from German, and in order to promote it he printed an extract from the Literary Gazette, printed at Frankfurt. He advertised a selection of imported titles in 1758, Bernard Mandeville’s The fable of the bees for 5s.5d. neatly bound, Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antonius, newly translated from Greek, for 3s.3d., A journey through every stage of life by a Person of Quality in two volumes for 4s.10½d. neatly bound, Memoirs of the life and ministerial conduct of Lord Bolingbroke for 2s.8½d. neatly bound, and Samuel Clarke’s A paraphrase on the four evangelists for 6s.6d., neatly bound (Corke Journal, 20 Jul 1758; 27 Jul 1758).\n\nThe adventures of Telemachus, Dublin, 1756, title page. Corke Journal, 21 Jul 1757, advertisement for A review of the military operations in North America.\n\nThe adventures of Telemachus, the son of Ulysses by François de Salignac de la Mothe Fénelon, was one of the most popular titles in Irish private libraries during the eighteenth century (Kennedy 1995; 2001). Used as a school reading text for French language students because of the purity of its style and its historical interest, it was also widely read in English translation. Swiney advertised a dual language edition, the French and English texts on facing pages, in 1757 for six shillings bound (Corke Journal, 8 Sep 1757; 10 Nov 1757). It was printed in Dublin the previous year by Peter Wilson. This was a new translation, revised by Pierre Des Maizeaux, the third edition corrected, in two volumes, illustrated with cuts. Swiney was also willing to sell the French and English volumes separately for three shillings each. An English language edition of the Des Maizeaux translation was printed in Cork in 1767 ‘for the proprietors’, but no printer is named.\n\nSubscription titles:\n\nSwiney acted as subscription agent for books published by Dublin booksellers, especially expensive titles reprinted from London editions. In December 1753 Richard James advertised in the Corke Journal the London edition of An historical account of the British trade over the Caspian Sea into Persia by Jonas Hanway (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753). It was elegantly printed in four volumes quarto, neatly bound and lettered, for 40s. He claimed ‘This curious work is in so high esteem in London that above 1000 copies have been disposed of there, since the publication which have been but a few weeks’. The following February Richard James advertised proposals to print his own edition by subscription, with subscriptions taken in Cork by Cornelius Sullivan and Eugene Swiney (Corke Journal, 15 Feb 1754). The Irish edition would be in a smaller format, in two volumes octavo, ’printed on quite new letter and good paper’, in neat half binding. The cost to subscribers was nine shillings, four shillings English (4s.4d. Irish) to be paid in advance. He was willing to go to press when 200 had subscribed. Again he pointed to its popularity ‘This useful and entertaining work is held in so great esteem in England, that two large impressions have been sold off in a few months; many setts of which have been disposed of in this city, at the price of forty shillings’.\n\nJohn Rocque, Survey of the city and suburbs of Cork, 1759, cartouche.\n\nIn 1754 Swiney was named as subscription agent for The life and uncommon adventures of Capt. Dudley Bradstreet, published in Dublin by Samuel Powell for the author the following year (Corke Journal, 13 Jun 1754). The volume was to be printed in octavo format, on good paper and letter and sewed in blue paper, for the cost of five British shillings (5s.5d. Irish), half to be paid in advance. The author was willing to go to press when he had gathered 200 subscribers, and at the time of the advertisement he was staying in Cork. The work proved popular, attracting over 900 subscribers, and Swiney took eight copies for sale in his bookshop. Another volume, Bradstreet’s lives, was published by subscription two years later in 1757, with nearly 700 subscribers. It was advertised for sale by Cornelius Sullivan in Cork for 5s.5d., sewed in blue paper (Corke Journal, 5 May 1757). In 1757 Patrick Lord in Dublin, Swiney and Timothy Cronin in Cork, each subscribed to 25 copies of A single combat, or personal dispute between Mr Trapp and his anonymous antagonist printed in Dublin for Philip Bowes. George and Alexander Ewing, booksellers at the Angel and Bible in Dame Street, Dublin, issued proposals to print by subscription Samuel Johnson’s Dictionary of the English language, with subscriptions taken by Cornelius Sullivan and Eugene Swiney in Cork (Corke Journal, 29 Jun 1758). Originally printed in folio in London, the Dublin reprint was issued in 1758 as a large octavo selling for six shillings in half binding, three shillings to be paid in advance. John Rocque, the renowned topographer and creator of detailed maps of London, Paris, Dublin, Cork and Kilkenny, came to Cork in 1758 for the purpose of making a map of the city in one sheet to a scale of 200 feet to the inch and publishing it by subscription (Corke Journal, 4 May 1758; 1 Jun 1758). He lodged with Mr Burnell at the Coach and Horses in Hammond’s March. Potential purchasers could see the drawings at Burnell’s, and could get his other maps there, or at Eugene Swiney’s.\n\nCorke Journal, 20-23 Nov 1769, advertisement for Focalóir Gaoidhilge-Sax-bhéarla.\n\nAn important Irish-English dictionary, Focalóir Gaoidhilge-Sax-bhéarla, was published in Paris in 1768. This was a valuable work for Irish scholarship, sponsored by John O’Brien, bishop of Cloyne and Ross, and compiled under his direction. A prospectus was issued in 1767 and subscriptions were taken by a number of booksellers in London, by James Hoey in Dublin, and by Eugene Swiney in Cork (Corke Journal, 20-23 Apr 1769; 9-12 Apr 1770). It was issued in one volume quarto, bound in calf, and costing 10s. It was printed in Roman and italic rather than using an Irish typeface, and it was noticed in the Journal des sçavans (McGuinne 2010; Sharpe and Hoyne 2020).\n\nA new work, printed in London in 50 weekly numbers at sixpence each, The British farmer: or, a complete system of agriculture and husbandry, was available from 16 December 1769 (Corke Journal, 1-5 Feb 1770). Subscriptions were taken by Eugene Swiney in Cork, and the whole would amount to one volume in folio, illustrated by copperplates engraved by the best artists. Swiney’s advertisement noted that half the cost was to be paid when subscribing and the remainder paid on delivery of the volume, suggesting that the individual numbers were not available separately to Cork subscribers.\n\nBusiness contacts:\n\nCooperation with other printers and booksellers in Dublin and Cork ensured a wide ranging stock of new publications. The main booksellers in Cork with whom Swiney had a working relationship were Cornelius Sullivan (1736-d.1767), Martha Pilkington (1743-1757), Patrick (1743-1785) and Thomas Lord (1767-1798), Phineas (1748-1784) and George Bagnell (1755-d.1768), Timothy Cronin (1747-d.1757), John Bardin (1763-d.1773), and William Flyn (1764-1801). He was associated with Richard James (1746-d.1757), John Exshaw (1741-d.1776), and James Williams (1764-1785) in Dublin. He had a close working connection with Peter Wilson (1743-d.1801), printer and bookseller in Dame Street, Dublin, acting as selling agent for many of Wilson’s publications in Cork. Wilson’s printing of the second edition of The country gentleman’s companion in 1755, in two volumes duodecimo selling for 2s.2d. bound, or 1s.8d. sewed in blue paper, was for sale in Cork from Cornelius Sullivan, Phineas Bagnell and Eugene Swiney (Corke Journal, 20 Mar 1755). The London edition, printed for the author in 1753, was selling in Cork for six British shillings (6s.6d. Irish). In 1759 Swiney took the lead with a new textbook, his Cork edition of The modern elements of numeral arithmetic by James Kennedy was reissued in Dublin by Wilson, replacing Swiney’s letter press title page with an engraved title page bearing his own imprint. The two page ‘Catalogue of books, printed for Peter Wilson, in Dame-Street, Dublin: and sold by Eugene Swiney, bookseller, in Corke’ was retained in Wilson’s reissue. The titles included in the list were Lex mercatoria rediviva, or merchant’s directory compiled by Wyndham Beawes, for 16s.3d. bound, A new general English dictionary by Thomas Dyche, the tenth edition, selling for 6s. bound, and A new and easy introduction to the study of geography by Mr Hubner, the fifth edition, with large additions, not in the London impression, for 3s.6d. bound. The Corke Journal also carried advertisements for Wilson’s publications which were sold by Swiney. Lex mercatoria was advertised in 1754 and 1757 in one large quarto volume for the price of three British crowns (16s.3d. Irish) bound (Corke Journal, 12 Aug 1754; 30 Jun 1757). The seventh edition of Dyche’s A new general English dictionary, printed for Wilson and sold by Swiney in 1757 was priced at 6s. bound (Corke Journal, 23 Jun 1757).\n\nSwiney advertised the seventh edition in duodecimo of a new Classical English dictionary for the use of young scholars by one J. K., first printed in London, reprinted by Samuel Powell in Dublin and sold by Swiney in Cork. It was neatly bound in calf and lettered for a British half crown (2s.8½d. Irish), the price was later reduced to 2s.2d., which would fit with it being sold sewed rather then bound, and he still had copies for sale nine years later (Corke Journal, 12 Dec 1757; 19 Nov 1759; 4-8 Dec 1766). George and Alexander Ewing, at the Angel and Bible in Dame Street, Dublin, published Dean Jonathan Swift’s The history of the four last years of the Queen, handsomely printed in octavo, and selling for 3s.3d. sewed in blue paper, or 4s. bound and lettered, it was available from Eugene Swiney and Cornelius Sullivan in Cork (Corke Journal, 27 Jul 1758). George Faulkner, bookseller in Essex Street, Dublin, advertised his edition of Swift’s Complete works in eleven neat pocket volumes in eighteens, using a new silver type and printed on fine paper (Corke Journal, 27 Jul 1758). He advertised George Faulkner’s Dublin edition of Frances Sheridan’s novel, Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph, just published in two volumes duodecimo, stitched in blue paper for 4s.4d. and neatly bound for 5s.5d. (Corke Journal, 30 Apr 1761).\n\nAn advertisement for the third volume in octavo of The modern universal history, selling for 4s.6d. in boards, first published in London, and reissued in Dublin by a large group of booksellers, was sold by Cornelius Sullivan, Eugene Swiney and Phineas and George Bagnell in Cork in 1760 (Belfast News Letter, 19 Feb 1760). Eugene Swiney and Cornelius Sullivan joined with John Exshaw, bookseller in Dame Street, Dublin, in 1763 in the publication of The complete history of the late war by John Wright. An octavo volume, it was illustrated with engraved portraits, maps and plans, and sold for 6s.6d. neatly bound, or 6s. in blue boards (Corke Journal, 26 Jan 1764). Proposals were issued in 1764 to print Limerick surgeon, Sylvester O’Halloran’s Treatise on amputation by subscription, at a cost of six English shillings (6s.6d.), a crown (5s.) to be paid in advance, and Swiney was subscription agent in Cork (Corke Journal, 10-14 May 1764). The following year, 1765, O’Halloran’s A complete treatise on gangrene and sphacelus with a new method of amputation was printed in London by Paul Vaillant, its dedication dated Limerick, 30 October 1765. M. Pollard (Trinity College Dublin) believed that the text was printed in Limerick by Andrew Welsh, and the National Library of Ireland catalogue states ‘London: printed by A. Welsh for the author’. In 1768 Swiney was one of four Cork booksellers publishing the Cork edition of Thomas Gray, Poems by Mr Gray, printed in Cork by William Flyn for E. Swiney, J. Bardin, T. White and W. Flyn.\n\nPRINTING OFFICE:\n\nSwiney worked as a printer as well as a bookseller and stationer, advertising ‘all manner of printing-work done at the most reasonable rates’ (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753). He advertised for an apprentice to the printing business in 1754 and 1755, ‘a young lad well recommended’ (Corke Journal, 23 Dec 1754; 7 Apr 1755; 5 June 1755). One of his apprentices, eighteen year old James Mahony, son of John Mahony, basket maker from Macroom, Co Cork, ran away in 1755, and Swiney offered a crown (5s.) reward for his capture (Corke Journal, 6 Nov 1755). Whether due to the expansion of his business or the loss of experienced staff, by 1764 he needed three sober journeymen printers (compositors) (Corke Journal, 20-24 Sep 1764; 8-11 Oct 1764). In 1770 he advertised again for an apprentice ‘a lad of good character, with a tolerable share of education’, and noted that a fee was required (Corke Journal, 26-29 Nov 1770). From 1753 to 1761 Swiney printed notices, proclamations and other routine printing work for Cork Corporation. In May 1755 he was paid 5s.5d. for printing a proclamation during the mayoralty of Sir John Freke (1753-1754). Printed proclamations were posted on the Exchange, and in other places around the city. In January 1758 he was paid £4.7s.1d. for printing work done from 1753 to 1757, and in May 1762 a further £7.17s.11d for work done from 1758 to 1761, but this terminated his contract, ‘that said Swiney be no further employed by this board’ (Caulfield 1870, pp 685, 704, 761, 794).\n\nCorke Journal, 7 Dec 1753 masthead; 1 Feb 1754 colophon; 6 Nov 1755 runaway apprentice; 25 Dec 1755 Christmas greetings.\n\nThe Corke Journal:\n\nFrom 1753 Swiney established a new newspaper, The Corke Journal. Publication of a twice-weekly newspaper in a provincial city was a major undertaking. Competition from the Dublin and London presses was an inhibiting factor. To make the venture pay a sufficient number of subscribers needed to be signed up, and enough advertising to provide a steady stream of income. Local official notices also helped to fund the production. News from home and abroad had to be gathered and presented in a timely fashion for its readers. The Corke Journal embodied all the elements of a successful newspaper operating in the restricted market of provincial Munster. It is the first Cork newspaper to have a long and unbroken sequence, but it was followed shortly afterwards by The Cork Evening Post, established in 1755. At the time of his death in 1777 the Dublin newspapers noted that he was ‘the first person who established a regular compleat news-paper, many years published with a great degree of merit’ (Freeman’s Journal, 13 Nov 1777; Saunders’s News Letter, 14 Nov 1777).\n\nCorke Journal, 7 Dec 1753, notice; 18 Dec 1753, subscribers.\n\nThe first issue of The Corke Journal appeared in December 1753 and it continued to be published until 1772 (Newsplan 1998, p. 51). Madden notes the title as George Swiney’s Corke Journal, suggesting George as the proprietor (Madden 1867, ii, p.168). George’s name does not appear on the masthead nor in the imprint of surviving copies of the newspaper, and even though Madden had some issues from 1765 in his possession this seems to be an error. The early issues had an elaborate masthead depicting the arms of Cork in the centre, flanked by a postboy with his trumpet and Liberty holding an olive branch and a spear. The paper was printed twice a week on Monday and Thursday evenings, with mastheads dated Tuesdays and Fridays (Corke Journal, 11 Dec 1753; 18 Dec 1753; 24 Jun 1754). In his notice to the public Swiney expressed his desire ‘to make the Corke Journal instructive, useful, and amusing equal to any other publick papers’ (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753). He targeted gentlemen and ladies in Cork and Munster, initially aiming for 300 subscribers (Corke Journal, 18 Dec 1753). The cost was six shillings English (6s. 6d. Irish) per annum to subscribers in the city or one penny per issue to non subscribers. Country subscribers paid the same fee if they were willing to pick up the papers in town. For delivery to Youghal he would charge ten English shillings (10s.10d. Irish) a year, as soon as he had 100 subscribers. Gentlemen in Bandon and Kinsale would be supplied on the same terms. He planned to issue an additional paper on Saturdays ‘as the packets arrive on Saturdays containing the freshest advices’ for an extra 6½d. per quarter to subscribers, but there is no evidence that this proposal was supported by the readers at this time (Corke Journal, 18 Aug 1755). Due to rising costs he was forced to raise his annual fee from 6s.6d. to 7s.7d., beginning in January 1759 (Corke Journal, 21 Dec 1758; 25 Dec 1758). By 1770 the circumstances were more favourable for printing a third weekly issue, published on Monday, Thursday and Saturday mornings, at the same cost of 6s.6d. to subscribers in the city (Corke Journal, 9-12 Apr 1770; 11-14 Jun 1770).\n\nCorke Journal, 28 Aug 1755; 9-12 Apr 1770.\n\nSigning up subscribers was the first step, but getting them to pay their subscriptions could be a difficulty. Requests for payment were frequently issued in the paper, especially at times of public gatherings such as the assizes when country people visited the towns (Corke Journal, 5 June 1755; 5 Aug 1755; 30 Aug 1756; 14 Oct 1756; 24 Mar 1757; 29 Jun 1758; 16 Aug 1759; 4-7 Jan 1768; 28-30 Apr 1770). He designated trusted agents in different towns to take payments and issue official receipts. In 1754 Swiney advised gentlemen subscribers in the city and county not to pay any of his servants without a printed receipt signed by himself (Corke Journal, 16 Dec 1754). The following year subscribers on the Clonmel route were urged to pay their debts to Edward Griffith’s in Kilworth, Mr McGrath in Clogheen and Thomas Brown in Clonmel, and Swiney appointed a person to collect the payments (Corke Journal, 8 May 1755).\n\nCorke Journal, 8 Apr 1754, newspaper agents; 3 Jun 1754 delivery of Dublin papers; 12 May 1755 advertisement for a courier for the Tipperary route.\n\nSwiney’s newspapers were delivered by couriers on horseback, possibly using one or more pack horses. They needed to carry at least 100 copies of a newspaper, in addition to stationery, monthly magazines and any books ordered, and their range of distribution was about fifty miles (Cork Journal, 24 Jun 1754). Pack horses could carry a range of goods for different traders, and on one occasion the Kinsale newspaper carrier was robbed as he picked up grocery items for delivery (Cork Journal, 15 Aug 1754). By April 1754 Swiney had established a courier from Cork to Clonmel, delivering the paper twice a week for a cost to subscribers of a half guinea (10s.6d.) per annum (Corke Journal, 8 Apr 1754). His agents at stages along the road were Andrew Morrogh, merchant in Rathcormuck, Co Cork, Atfield Bell in Castlelyons, Co Cork, Dennis McGrath (or McCraith), innkeeper at the Globe Inn in Clogheen, Co Tipperary, and Patrick Brennock, merchant in Clonmel. He advertised for a newspaper carrier for the Mallow route in October 1754 (Corke Journal, 10 Oct 1754). He looked for a courier in 1755, for two routes to Clonmel and Bandon, and again in 1759 he looked for a rider to undertake the Bandon and Kinsale route (Corke Journal, 10 Feb 1755; 7 Apr 1755; 26 Mar 1759). In his advertisement for a courier for the Clonmel route he stated a preference for ‘an honest man well recommended’ who had a pair of horses and lived along the route in Kilworth, Clogheen or Clonmel (Corke Journal, 12 May 1755). As the newspaper’s network expanded Swiney needed to employ two couriers for the Co Kerry route to Killarney, Castleisland and Tralee, persons that could ‘give security for their sobriety, honesty, and diligence’ (Corke Journal, 5-7 Jan 1771).\n\nSwiney offered to supply the Dublin newspapers with the Corke Journal to subscribers for one guinea (21s.) per annum in the city, and 24s. to subscribers in Kinsale, Bandon, Mallow, Middleton, Carrigtwohill, Castlemartyr, Youghal, Rathcormuck, Fermoy, Kilworth and Clogheen (Corke Journal, 3 Jun 1754). Subscriptions were taken at the Bowling Green in Kinsale. John Browne, proprietor of the Bowling Green, opened it to paying guests in the summer season, where they could play bowls and partake of dancing and card drums. Subscribers paid a British crown, and non subscribers paid 3d. on entering the Green. He also offered ‘English and Dublin news to read’ (Corke Journal, 15 Apr 1756). A decade after its launch the Corke Journal could claim 2,000 subscribers in Cork city and surrounding towns, subscriptions were taken by Daniel Swiney in Bandon, probably the proprietor of the King’s Head inn, and John Browne in Kinsale (Corke Journal, 24 Nov 1760; 8-12 Nov 1764; 24-26 Nov 1764). By 1770 he advised those wishing to subscribe or to insert advertisements in the Corke Journal to contact his agents in Cork, at the coffee house, at Thomas White, bookseller, or at his own shop facing the Exchange, James Craswell in Killarney, Darby Dowde in Tralee, Timothy Heydon in Kinsale, Daniel Swiney in Bandon, Jeremiah McCarthy in Clonakilty, and James Barry in Mallow (Corke Journal, 11-14 Jun 1770).\n\nAdvertising was the mainstay of a provincial newspaper. About half of each issue of the Corke Journal was given over to paid content in the form of advertising and notices. When the paper was launched the fee charged for advertisements of less than ten lines was 2s.8½d. for one month, and needed to be paid in advance ‘for ready money’ (Corke Journal, 11 Dec 1753). Fees for advertisements went up effectively in 1760, when the same fee of 2s.8½d. bought up to seven lines in small print, or an English crown (5s.5d. Irish) for seven to fourteen lines for one month (Corke Journal, 21 Apr 1760). He warned that he would not insert any advertisements ‘for the future but what are paid for when given to be published’ (Corke Journal, 5 Jun 1755). However, by October 1756 he was still requesting gentlemen to pay their debts for subscriptions and advertisements (Corke Journal, 14 Oct 1756; 31 Mar 1757). A build up of debts owed to him caused him to curtail his activities in 1770, at first streamlining his business premises by moving his bookshop from its prominent location on Main Street to his home and printing office in Fishamble Lane (Corke Journal, 12-15 Mar 1770). A sale of stock followed when he offered to sell a large selection of titles at wholesale prices (Corke Journal, 29 Mar-2 Apr 1770), and from August 1771 the printing of the Corke Journal was carried out by his son, John Swiney, at the Fishamble Lane address (Corke Journal, 19-22 Aug 1771).\n\nCorke Journal, 7 Dec 1753, advertisements for Richard James.\n\nThe early issues of the newspaper carried a range of advertisements for Dublin bookseller, Richard James, amounting to substantial support for the new venture. James (1746-d.1757) was printer and bookseller in Dame Street, at Newton’s Head, who had served his time with George Faulkner, printer, bookseller and proprietor of Faulkner’s Dublin Journal newspaper. Over the next number of years James advertised some of his more expensive titles imported from London as well as pamphlets selling for 2d. In 1754 and 1755 James advertised London-printed books published in parts, A new and complete dictionary of arts and sciences by a Society of Gentlemen, published in 74 numbers, each containing three sheets of letterpress and four copperplates and sewed in blue paper, at a British sixpence per number; A new universal etymological English dictionary in weekly parts at 6d. each, stitched in blue paper, to come to no more than two guineas for the completed folio volume; and An illustration of the Holy scriptures, in weekly parts at three-pence English per folio part (Corke Journal, 6 May 1754; 28 Nov 1754; 22 Dec 1755; 25 Dec 1755; 29 Mar 1756). As these works were sold by ‘all other booksellers in Great Britain and Ireland’ it is likely that Swiney also stocked them. The scale of James’s advertising suggests a prior relationship and a desire to help fund the new paper. The Corke Journal also carried advertisements for Cork booksellers Martha Pilkington, Timothy Cronin, and Phineas and George Bagnell, who went on to print the very successful Cork Evening Post, established in 1755 (Corke Journal, 28 Dec 1753; 18 Feb 1754; 29 Jan 1756)\n\nThe content of the newspaper was typical for an eighteenth-century Irish provincial paper. In his statement of intent Swiney wanted the paper to be ‘instructive, useful, and amusing’ (Corke Journal, 7 Dec 1753). He claimed that this was ‘the first attempt that has hitherto been made to establish a good news paper in Corke, and continue it with any degree of credit and reputation’ (Corke Journal, 24 Jun 1754). International news, gathered from London and Dublin newspapers, incoming Packets, official and merchants’ correspondence, was an important element, especially in times of war. Local news included political news from Dublin, port news from Cork and Cove (Cobh), the coming and going of shipping, the assize of bread and the prices of basic commodities, reports from the assizes, notices of births, marriages and deaths, and accounts of interesting or curious events. Swiney also printed ‘letters, essays and miscellaneous tracts’ as well as poetry and anecdotal stories of well-known persons, such as the King of Prussia (Corke Journal, 24 Jun 1754; 8 Jul 1754; 12 Jan 1758; 23 Jan 1758). The currency of news was of major importance, and on occasions Swiney had to delay publication of the paper until the post boys delivered the Dublin newspapers (Corke Journal, 8 Mar 1754; 22 Mar 1754; 14 Feb 1757). The arrival of a Packet bringing the mail with news from abroad curtailed the space for advertisements. While advertising funded the enterprise up-to-date news was critical to its success. Swiney’s advertising for his own stock was dropped first to accommodate fresh news, any other advertisements omitted were inserted in later issues (Corke Journal, 21 Apr 1760).\n\nOne of the hazards faced by a newspaper proprietor was insulting or otherwise impugning the reputation of important persons in the pages of the paper. Shortly after the establishment of the Corke Journal Swiney had to answer a charge of libel ‘reflecting on the honour and reputation of a certain eminent gentleman of this kingdom’ (Corke Journal, 5 Feb 1754). He countered that he had never printed, published, or offered for sale, nor had any knowledge of the libel, believing ‘it to be as well my duty as interest, to merit rather the countenance and protection of every gentleman of this city and county’. It is not known what the outcome of this charge was.\n\nCorke Journal, 22-25 Apr 1771, advertisement for music sheets.\n\nIn a unique and innovative move Swiney acquired a set of music type in 1771 and used it in the Corke Journal, printing songs and dance music (Corke Journal, 30 Mar-1 Apr 1771; 22-25 Apr 1771; 9-11 May 1771; 8-10 Jun 1771; 24-27 Jun 1771; UCC Library website). Music printing of this kind was generally confined to the monthly periodicals and to single music sheets or books of music. In addition to printing these musical pieces in the Journal Swiney also produced them as single sheets, set for the harpsichord, selling at three halfpence (1½d.) each (Corke Journal, 20-24 Apr 1771).\n\nPamphlets:\n\nSwiney’s own publications consisted mainly of school books, plays and pamphlets. He invested in works that were likely to sell in large numbers while not taking up valuable resources in type and paper. He used a tail-piece decorative device of an eagle with spread wings at the end of many of his publications. His earliest titles were small pamphlets of local interest, selling for a few pence. Although no copies of some of the more ephemeral items have survived he was likely to have been the printer. The term ‘published by’ did not have the same precision as it has now, it simply meant available for sale. For example in January 1754 he advertised as ‘This day is publish’d by the printer hereof’ The temple of interest, a vision, in imitation of Pope’s Temple of fame, inscrib’d to the Right Honourable Henry Boyle, Esq., [M. P. for Cork, speaker of the Irish House of Commons 1733-1753, and later created Earl of Shannon], selling for 2d. (Corke Journal, 11 Jan 1754). This is likely to have been a Cork publication, but not necessarily printed by Swiney. He also advertised ‘In the press and speedily will be published’ A present for an apprentice, for 6½d. (Corke Journal, 25 Jan 1754). In June he printed John Cuthbert, A letter to Mr Joseph Popham, mercht. Occasion’d by his two letters to a friend, lately publish’d, a 44 page pamphlet in octavo format, it was advertised for sale by Swiney and Phineas Bagnell, and by Thomas Popham, at Mr John Connor’s in Paul Street, stitched in blue paper for 4d. (Corke Journal, 18 Feb 1754; 30 May 1754; 24 Jun 1754; 1 Jul 1754). In July he advertised as ‘in the press and will be published by the printer’ The mason’s creed. To which is subjoined A curious letter, written by Mr Lock, author of the Essay on human understanding, selling for 2d. (Corke Journal, 22 Jul 1754). He was certainly the printer, when in August he advertised: ‘Wednesday next will be publish’d by the printer hereof, the speech of Daniel O’Connell as written by himself, and sent me to be printed’ as well as the speech of William Devereux. Both were condemned to death at the assizes, O’Connell for the murder of John Puxley, Esq., and Devereux for horse stealing (Corke Journal, 26 Aug 1754). In 1758 Thomas Gataker’s short treatise, Observations on the internal use of the solanum or nightshade, was reprinted by Swiney in duodecimo, priced at 6½d., from the third London edition in octavo (Corke Journal, 9 Mar 1758). He printed the first of four parts of George Stacpoole’s Some historical anecdotes, with remarks relative to Ireland in 1762, but no more was published. The 94 page octavo work, dedicated to the author’s uncle, John Stacpoole of Co Clare, dealt with agriculture, trade and economic conditions in Ireland in an historical context.\n\nSchool books:\n\nThe publication of school books was a profitable business with an assured market, especially for texts written by local teachers and used in local schools. School texts, whether his own publications or not, were supplied in quantity to schoolmasters and country chapmen who bought to sell again, allowing them to claim a discount (Corke Journal, 18 Feb 1760). In 1754 proposals were advertised for printing by subscription a ‘regular French grammar; or a short and easy method to learn French’, by Charles Dwyer, teacher of French in Cork from 1751 to 1780 (Corke Journal, 20 Jun 1754). One hundred subscribers were needed and the cost was two English shillings (2s.2d. Irish) bound in leather, half to be paid on subscribing. It was to be printed on good paper and new type. Proposals were published again in December 1759, for the same price, but this time seeking 400 subscribers, subscriptions were taken by Swiney, by the author, and by several gentlemen in Cork (Corke Journal, 24 Dec 1759). It was finally published by Eugene Swiney, for the author, in octavo format in January 1761, as the Anglo-Gallic grammar. The subscribers were directed to make their final payment to the author at his house on Fenn’s Quay, Hammond’s Marsh (Corke Journal, 19 Feb 1761). The price to non subscribers was 2s.8½d., neatly bound and lettered (Corke Journal, 4 Sep 1760). Swiney’s costs were secured with publication by subscription, where monies were gathered in advance of his outlay on paper and type, and ‘for the author’ usually indicated that the author had a financial stake in the production. In October 1756 Swiney printed in octavo format An English exercise book to translate into French by J. Daubichon, professor of French in Dublin, and author of The new French grammar (Corke Journal, 6 Jan 1757). This text was first printed in Dublin by Samuel Powell for Thomas Browne and Ignatius Kelly in 1743. At the end of the year he advertised ‘In the press and speedily will be publish’d by the printer hereof’ The expeditious instructor, or reading, writing and arithmetic made plain and easy, to which is annexed The child’s new play-thing, selling for 1s.1d. (Corke Journal, 23 Dec 1756; 13 Jan 1757). Printed in London for the author in 1756, this was a 60 page quarto volume with engraved plates. Special rates were offered to those who took 100 copies. Swiney may have reprinted this text, but more likely he was selling the London edition as it was advertised at the same price with the same discount for taking 100 copies. George Wood’s A new English-Latin grammar was advertised for sale for one British shilling by Cornelius Sullivan and Eugene Swiney in 1758 (Corke Journal, 6 Feb 1758). Rev. Wood was master of Bandon School, and an earlier text book, The rudiments both of the English and Latin tongues. Made easy and familiar to the meanest capacity, in duodecimo, was printed in Cork for the author in 1757. The printer was not named.\n\nCorke Journal, 8 May 1755, advertisement for Daubichon’s grammar.\n\nIn cooperation with Peter Wilson, bookseller in Dublin, he issued James Kennedy, The modern elements of numeral arithmetic, ‘printed by Eugene Swiney, for the author, and are to be sold by him, by said Swiney, and by Mr Peter Wilson, Dublin, 1759’. Proposals were issued in June 1758 to print it by subscription and names were taken by the author and Eugene Swiney in Cork, by Peter Wilson in Dublin, at both coffee houses in Cork, and by agents in Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, Bandon and Kinsale (Cork Evening Post, 1 Jun 1758; Corke Journal, 1 Jun 1758). The cost to subscribers, printed in duodecimo on good paper and beautiful new letter, neatly bound and lettered, was a British half crown (2s.8½d. Irish), one British shilling to be paid in advance, and the book would go to press when 300 purchasers were in place. Special rates were offered to school masters and booksellers taking multiple copies. Kennedy, termed Philomath, was master at the parochial school of St Finn Barry’s in Cork, and teacher of writing, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, book-keeping and navigation, educating youth for trade and business (Corke Journal, 13 Mar 1758; 1 Jun 1758). The book was dedicated to Jemmett Browne, then bishop of Cork and Ross, later archbishop of Tuam, who was responsible for the ‘present establishment’ of St Finn Barry’s school. The preface was dated: Cork, 28 March 1759. Another edition was issued in Dublin by Wilson, using Swiney’s printing with the Cork letter press title page cancelled and an engraved title page substituted. At the end of each is a two page ‘Catalogue of books, printed for Peter Wilson, in Dame-Street, Dublin: and sold by Eugene Swiney, bookseller, in Corke’.\n\nIn 1761 Swiney printed the sixth edition of The royal English grammar, by James Greenwood, sur-master of St Paul’s school in London, in duodecimo format. It was dedicated to the Princess of Wales. Swiney included two final advertisement leaves for his stock. Mathurin Cordier’s A select century of Corderius’s colloquies, with English notes by William Willymot, for the use of schools, the twelfth edition of a Latin text, was reprinted by Swiney in octavo from the London edition in 1769 (Corke Journal, 11-14 Dec 1769). It was reissued in Dublin by Robert Jackson about 1780 from the Cork-printed sheets, remaindered after Swiney’s death in 1777 (Trinity College Dublin catalogue), with a final leaf of Eugene Swiney’s bookseller’s advertisements. His last known publication was his 1772 printing of William Lily, Contraction of Lily’s syntaxis (Syntaxis Lilli contractior), a forty page Lain text in duodecimo.\n\nLimerick Chronicle, 13 Oct 1768; Corke Journal, 19-22 Dec 1768, advertisements for John M. Swiney’s History of England; John M. Swiney, Juvenile Muse, 1781, title page\n\nEugene Swiney’s son, John M. Swiney, was the author of A new history of England which he planned to publish by subscription. Proposals were widely advertised in the Munster region, and subscriptions were taken by John Swiney at Eugene Swiney’s Printing Office, by John Ferrar in Limerick and James Stuart in Ennis (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 24-28 Sep 1768; 16-19 Nov 1768. Limerick Chronicle, 13 Oct 1768). It was a quality production printed on good letter and paper, with engraved portraits. It was aimed at children and was advertised by Eugene Swiney as a Christmas or New Year gift, bound in red leather and gilt for 1s.7½d. (Corke Journal, 19-22 Dec 1768). John Swiney published another title in 1781, ‘An entire new work shortly will be published, price 2s.2d. sewed, The juvenile muse, written by J. M. Swiney (son of the late Eugene Swiney, printer). Subscriptions are taken in Cork by William Flyn, printer and bookseller, Eugene Daly, stationer, Paul Street, near the bank, and at both coffee houses’ (Hibernian Chronicle, 19 Jul 1781). The imprint identified John Swiney as the printer, ‘printed by the author; and published by all the booksellers’, Eugene Daly took 25 copies, Jeremiah Sullivan, 25 copies, and William Flyn, 14 copies.\n\nCorke Journal, 13-17 Apr 1769, advertisement for Magazine des enfans; 18-21 Dec 1769, advertisement for Corderius’ Colloquies.\n\nIn 1769 Swiney published proposals to publish by subscription A new pocket dictionary of the French and English languages by Thomas Nugent, London printed and Cork reprinted by Eugene Swiney (Corke Journal, 13-17 Apr 1769). It was to be printed verbatim from the London edition, with a good type and paper, neatly bound in leather, to cost three British shillings (3s.3d. Irish), half to be paid on subscribing. It would go to press when 300 names were pledged and subscriptions were taken by Swiney in Cork, John Ferrar in Limerick, Hugh Ramsay in Waterford, and Edmund Finn in Kilkenny. It is not clear if the Cork edition was completed; a Dublin edition was printed by James Williams the following year. Madame Leprince de Beaumont’s Magazine des enfans, or the young misses magazine in four volumes, a quality publication bound in red leather gilt, was advertised for 4s.4d., but volumes could be purchased separately (Corke Journal, 30 Mar-3 Apr 1769). This popular work was unlikely to be a Cork printing, but probably a London edition.\n\nPlays and farces:\n\nIn 1761 and 1762 Swiney printed a series of plays, most were popular and current and had been performed, or would soon be performed, in Cork (Clark 1965). Shakespeare was a perennial favourite and in 1761 he printed Coriolanus: a tragedy, with a final advertisement leaf for his stock; Macbeth, performed in Cork in 1759, 1760, 1762 and 1765, with three final advertisement pages; Nahum Tate, The history of King Lear, altered from Shakespeare’s play, performed in Cork in 1759; and Romeo and Juliet, performed in Cork in 1754, 1756, 1758, 1760, 1761 and 1762 (Cork Journal, 22 Aug 1754). The imprint of Romeo and Juliet stated ‘London printed’, but it was printed in Cork by Eugene Swiney with his advertisement on the verso of the final leaf. In the same year, 1761, he printed Richard Brome, The jovial crew, a comic opera, with new songs, without the music, for 3d., performed in Cork in 1761 (Corke Journal, 19 Feb 1761); George Colman’s Polly Honeycombe, a dramatic novel of one act, performed in Cork in 1763 and 1764; and the seventh edition of John Gay, The beggar’s opera, performed in Cork in 1756, 1758 and 1760. The following year, 1762, saw his editions of Arthur Murphy’s All in the wrong, a comedy as it is acted at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, printed by subscription, performed in Cork in 1766, and John Home, Douglas, a tragedy, performed in Cork 1759, 1760, 1761 and 1763. In 1769 he printed Samuel Madden, Themistocles, the lover of his country, a tragedy, with two final advertisement leaves for Dublin booksellers George Risk, George Ewing and William Smith.\n\nLiterary works:\n\nHe published a number of literary works, the most important of which was Oliver Goldsmith’s The vicar of Wakefield. A certain best seller it was published in London in 1766 in two volumes duodecimo, and reprinted in Dublin for a large group of booksellers, including Peter Wilson, in the same year. The Cork edition, printed by Swiney, was set page for page with the Dublin two volume edition, the two volumes bound in one. He printed works by naval surgeon, John Solas Dodd, in 1770, An essay on education. With a new plan of an academy was printed for the author, by Eugene Swiney, and sold by the booksellers of Cork and Limerick, costing 3d. (Corke Journal, 17-19 May 1770). Dodd’s Essays and poems, satirical, moral, political, and entertaining was published by subscription for the author. Proposals were published in March 1769 for the neat pocket volume in duodecimo format to cost 3s.3d., subscriptions were taken by Swiney and Thomas Lord in Cork, and John Ferrar in Limerick, and Swiney subscribed for 12 copies (Corke Journal, 12 Mar 1769; 12-15 Mar 1770; 26-29 Mar 1770; 17-19 May 1770). It appeared in 1770 and a final advertisement leaf printed proposals to print by subscription Dodd’s Satyrical and moral lecture upon hearts, which had been published in London in 1767 in octavo.\n\nCorke Journal, 26-29 Mar 1770, advertisement dated 12 Mar 1769. J. S. Dodd, Essays and poems, 1770, title page. Proposals to print Dodd’s Lecture upon hearts, 1770.\n\nReligious works:\n\nHe also published titles of local religious interest, mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic. Short prayer sheets were issued for special services in the Anglican Church of Ireland calendar, these were official documents normally printed by the King’s printer in Ireland or printed locally and licensed by him. Martha Pilkington, bookseller in Castle Street, printed A form of prayer for Friday, 11 February 1757, selling for 1½d. each, or one shilling for a dozen (Corke Journal, 10 Feb 1757). Swiney printed A form of prayer for Thursday, 29 November 1759, a day of general thanksgiving, a sixteen page octavo pamphlet, reprinted in Cork with permission from Boulter Grierson, King’s printer in Dublin.\n\nCorke Journal, 30 Jun 1755, advertisement for The case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland.\n\nIn 1755 he reprinted in duodecimo format a 56 page argument by Charles O’Conor, The case of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, first printed by Patrick Lord in Dublin, this publication, however, was suppressed by the mayor and council of Cork (Corke Journal, 30 Jun 1755; Fenning 1995; 1996). Official texts from the Catholic diocese of Cork included Apparatus ad clericorum institutionem, a theological text book in duodecimo format to prepare candidates for holy orders, printed in 1764, and Statuta synodalia, statutes of a Cork diocesan synod on the administration of the sacraments, printed in duodecimo in 1768. Thomas Vincent Sadler’s A daily exercise of the devout Christian was a little devotional text in duodecimo illustrated with engraved plates. Swiney printed the ninth edition, corrected in 1766, but he reverted to the eighth edition corrected in 1770 (Fenning 1995).\n\nA substantial project was undertaken by Swiney in 1764, when he advertised his reprint, corrected from the English edition, of Nicholas Caussin’s The holy court, in five books, translated from French by Sir Thomas Hawkins. A Catholic work Swiney claimed the patronage of every Christian, advertising it as suitable for persons of every denomination. Proposals for the printing by subscription were issued in April 1764, the price to subscribers, neatly bound in calf and lettered on the back, was one guinea (21s.), half to be paid in advance, the price to non subscribers would be 30s. (Corke Journal, 19-23 April 1764; 16-20 Aug 1764). Three years later, in May 1767, he noted the delay in publication due to the engraving of the plates, subscriptions were still sought and would be taken by Swiney, and by Henry Long, bookseller, and David Callinane, merchant, in Limerick, and Michael Bonfield, merchant in Dublin (Corke Journal, 11-14 May 1767). The work appeared in November 1767, coming to nearly 900 pages, the five volumes were printed in one large folio, illustrated with beautiful copperplates, with the title page printed in red and black, neatly bound, gilt and lettered, at a cost of £1.2s.9d. (Corke Journal, 9-12 Nov 1767). The subscription list has not survived.\n\nPhineas Bagnell:\n\nHe cooperated with Phineas and George Bagnell in 1759 and 1760 when they reprinted two titles of contemporary interest. The genuine legal sentence pronounced by the high court of Judicature of Portugal upon the conspirators against the life of His Most Faithful Majesty, with the just motives for the same, translated from Portuguese, was a 32 page octavo pamphlet printed in 1759 (Corke Journal, 5 Mar 1759). Lord George Germain Sackville’s The proceedings of a general court-martial was reprinted from the London edition by Phineas and George Bagnell and Eugene Swiney in 1760, selling for 1s.7½d., stitched in blue paper (Corke Journal, 28 Jul 1760; 8 Sep 1760). Phineas Bagnell, established his bookshop in Castle Street, Cork, in 1748, and was joined in business by his brother George about 1755. The Bagnell business had a degree of financial stability, perhaps due to their privileged background as sons of William Bagnell, gentleman, of Killmalogue, Co Tipperary, and brothers of William Bagnell of Marlhill, Co Tipperary. Phineas was apprenticed in 1740 to Abraham Bradley, King’s Printer and one of Dublin’s most renowned printers and booksellers (Pollard 2000; Power 2004). Phineas moved to Cork in 1748, and an advertisement from May 1749 informed his customers that he ‘lately finished his apprenticeship in Dublin, [and] open’d shop in Castle Street’ (Munster Journal, 15 May 1749). Swiney was ahead of him when he established The Corke Journal in 1753, but Phineas and George started to print The Cork Evening Post in 1755, both papers traded successfully until the demise of The Corke Journal in 1772. George Bagnell had died in 1768 and in 1771 Phineas took George and James Knight into partnership to publish the Cork Evening Post (MacLochlainn 1960). While Swiney cooperated with the Bagnells in some publications and both printed for Cork Corporation, the orientation of many Bagnell publications was towards loyalist Protestant readers, most notably with their printings of Sir John Temple’s Irish rebellion in 1766 and Archbishop William King’s State of the Protestants in 1768, while Swiney printed and sold Gaelic Irish history and Catholic works.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nUncertainty remains about Eugene Swiney’s early career, whether he was the established bookseller from the 1720s, who from 1753 ran a successful newspaper, whether he was the young printer who started business on a large and ambitious scale in the early 1750s, five years after absconding from his master, or whether another generation is present, and father and son are working in the book trade. The older individual fits better into the later career. A successful bookselling and printing business, with a solid customer base, would have laid the foundations for the establishment of a newspaper. Swiney’s interest in Gaelic cultural and historical publications and works of Catholic interest is consistent with a connection to the poetic enclave at Carrignavar, eight miles north of Cork city.\n\nBy the middle years of the eighteenth century Eugene Swiney was one of a group of printers and booksellers working in Cork city. They congregated in proximity to the Exchange, in Castle Street, Paul Street, Main Street and nearby streets, an area which formed the hub of business and the administration. Here merchants, traders, lawyers, teachers, members of the council, the gentry and patrons of the two coffee houses sought information and entertainment through the printed word. That the city and its inhabitants could sustain five or six active booksellers at any one time in this period is remarkable. Swiney’s business was eventually not sustainable, through over extension or poor management, or by his own assessment the non payment of debts. When he married Isabella Callanan in 1766 she brought a handsome fortune to the family, but by March 1770 he was forced to reduce his bookselling activities and by 1772 he was declared insolvent. His business did not recover and was not passed on to his son John M. Swiney.\n\nThe Corke Journal, the earliest of the two twice-weekly newspapers published in Cork from the 1750s, brought news and advertising to several hundred households in the city and was delivered by couriers to surrounding towns in Cork, and further afield to counties Tipperary and Kerry, later rising to over 2,000 subscribers. In addition Swiney took subscriptions for Dublin newspapers, which were delivered with the Journal by his couriers. His stock of books was wide ranging and current. Books from London and Dublin could be purchased soon after publication, and expensive titles could be purchased by subscription. His own publications comprised plays, school books, local pamphlets, and some religious titles, all likely to sell in quantities. He published lists of titles, a selection from the bookshop, in The Corke Journal and at the end of his own publications.\n\nCooperation is evident among booksellers, sharing the business of the growing literate population of the city. Even across the religious divide, which was profound in the mid eighteenth century, relations with booksellers, such as Phineas and George Bagnell and Martha Pilkington, were workmanlike, or even cordial. According to his obituaries Swiney was considered ‘to possess an honest heart and most unsullied reputation’. His connections with Dublin booksellers, especially with Richard James, Peter Wilson and John Exshaw, were enduring, leading to the availability of new and interesting works of entertainment, literature, history, travel and the sciences for the growing cohort of readers in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nSwiney tailpiece in Charles Dwyer, Anglo-Gallic grammar, 1761.\n\nReferences:\n\nBeaumont, Daniel, 2009. ‘Swiney, Eugene’, Dictionary of Irish biography online.\n\nBradshaw, Henry, 1916.

A number of circulating libraries were commenced in Ireland by the mid eighteenth century. By the end of the century subscription libraries and reading societies were also founded to cater to different audiences (Manley 2018). As literacy levels rose and the base of readers broadened, many who could read and enjoy books were not able to afford them. Aristocratic, country house and estate libraries were used by family and friends of the owners, but there was a large cohort who could not gain access to them. Booksellers were innovative and flexible and they embraced a commercial solution, by lending new books to readers of more modest means. Commercial circulating libraries were particularly associated with lending novels, literary and epistolary narratives, plays and poetry. With the establishment of commercial ventures the very latest and most sought after titles became available for borrowing for a small weekly or monthly fee. Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s well known line from The Rivals indicates their importance in the lives of readers, but also point to suspicion in some quarters about the kind of reading offered: ‘a circulating library in a town is as an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge. It blossoms through the year!’.\n\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century subscription or proprietary libraries became a feature of Irish towns, the Belfast Reading Society was founded in 1788, the Dublin Library in 1790, the Cork Library Society in 1792, the Limerick Institution in 1809 and the Kilkenny Library Society in 1811. They were distinct from circulating libraries in their set-up and their stock, not accessible to the casual reader but aimed at a group of members who observed the rules of the society. Established in English cities from the 1750s, they were geared towards the better off reader, with cultural and enlightenment values, and carried more serious titles in history, philosophy, belles letters, voyages and travels, theology, and the sciences, stocking few novels and romances (Kennedy 1989).\n\nBusiness models:\n\nCommercial lending libraries formed one part of the book trade in Irish cities and larger towns in the second half of the eighteenth century, where booksellers considered a sufficient audience could support the venture. By the early nineteenth century the widespread and intricate networks of book distribution enabled the establishment of circulating libraries in smaller towns. One of the earliest circulating libraries, as noted by Pollard, was run by James Hoey, bookseller in Dublin, who was lending novels and romances in 1735 (Pollard 1989; Hoey’s Dublin Journal, 15 Jul 1735). In Munster the cities of Cork and Limerick had libraries in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, followed by Tralee, Co Kerry and Clonmel, Co Tipperary, after 1800. In Cork city at least seven lending libraries were provided by booksellers, in Castle Street by Thomas Lord from 1770, Michael Matthews from 1777, Anthony Edwards from 1787, and John Connor from 1792, in Patrick Street by George Cherry by 1801 and Dominick Jacotin by 1803, and by Henry Denmead in South Main Street in 1803. The first quarter of the nineteenth century saw an increase in circulating libraries, subscription libraries and reading clubs outside Cork city, in the towns of Bandon, Clonakilty, Cobh, Fermoy, Mallow, Mitchelstown and Youghal (Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824; Manley 2018). Limerick booksellers opened circulating libraries in the 1790s, John Carroll in Bridge Street by 1791 and Richard Hill, near the Main Guard also by 1791, and John and Thomas McAuliff, near the Exchange by 1801.\n\nFinn’s Leinster Journal, 9-12 Jul 1788; 8-11 Oct 1788, advertisements for Catharine Finn’s circulating library.\n\nBy the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries libraries were frequently run by women, such as Catharine Finn’s new undertaking in Kilkenny in 1788 (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 9-12 Jul 1788; 2-6 Aug 1788; 8-11 Oct 1788). Catharine ran a successful printing and newspaper office and bookshop after the death of her husband, Edmund, in 1777 (‘Edmund and Catharine Finn: enterprising booksellers in Kilkenny (1766-1801)’, mairekennedybooks.wordpress.com). In the summer of 1788 she announced the establishment of her circulating library ‘in compliance with the repeated solicitations of many ladies and gentlemen, as well as her own wish to contribute every thing in her power to the public convenience, she will open a circulating library on Monday the 21st instant; on which day catalogues (with the terms of subscribing) will be ready for delivery’ (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 9-12 Jul 1788). It is not clear how long the library lasted, if it closed early on, or if it became an integral part of her business. In 1794 a group of women proprietors proposed to establish a circulating library in Cork ‘on a new and elegant plan’. They required 200 subscribers, each paying 11s.4½d. per annum to make the venture possible, a more modest fee than those pertaining at Bath or Dublin at the period (Cork Gazette, 8 Feb 1794). They targeted women and young persons, with the objective of blending amusement with instruction, intending to fit up the library in a neat manner for the reception of ladies, and to stock only the most approved writers, those who ‘may safely be committed to the inspection of Young Persons’. As they wished particularly to attract women to the library, they arranged that the books could be browsed, ‘which, it is presumed, will be more pleasing than the usual method of sending Servants’. It is not known, however, if the plan became a reality. From 1803 Mrs Jacotin carried on the day to day running of the English, French and Italian circulating library in Cork, while her husband taught French and Italian. In the early 1820s trade directories listed a number of circulating libraries in Munster run by women: in Cork Miss Fitton in Patrick Street and Bachelor’s Quay (1817-1820) and Ellen Constant in the South Mall (1824); Catherine Geary at 5 Harbour Row in Cobh, Co Cork (1824); in Limerick Mary Crippes (1820-1824), and Eliza O’Shaughnessy (1824), both in Patrick Street, and Margaret Lynch in Dublin Street, Clonmel, Co Tipperary (1820-1824) (Connor 1817; Pigot 1820-22; Pigot 1824).\n\nBooksellers running circulating libraries prided themselves on stocking the very latest and most fashionable reading matter, especially novels, plays and poetry. For a modest sum books could be borrowed and read. Currency of titles was a critical factor, so popular were certain three volume novels that each volume was lent separately to cater for the maximum readership. Robert Darnton points to the frenzy to read Rousseau’s La Nouvelle Heloïse in France as booksellers lent out volumes by the day or even the hour (Darnton 1985). The English translation, Eloisa, was available in a Dublin edition in four volumes duodecimo costing 10s.10d. (Dublin Catalogue 1779). In Ireland in the last quarter of the eighteenth century novels typically cost from 2s. to 3s.3d. per volume, while the membership fees at circulating libraries provided good value for readers.\n\nFees:\n\nA circulating library became viable when a sizable audience was present with the means and leisure to sustain it. The fees were not cheap, but when compared to the cost of purchasing books they provided value for money. Not all enterprises were long lived, a substantial outlay was involved in the initial stages, when an extensive range of new stock needed to be purchased, and to be replenished regularly to keep it up-to-date. Generally fees were charged by the week, month or year, but Hugh Warrin, bookseller and stationer, who ran the Belfast circulating library, also lent books by the day (Belfast News Letter, 11 Jul 1796).\n\nJames De la Cour, A prospect of poetry (Cork, 1770), title page; advertisement page.\n\nA Fees charged for the use of circulating libraries were relatively stable, with some variation depending on their distance from centres of book production. In London James Lackington, with access to a broad range of new works produced in the city, charged 10s.6d. per year, down to 6d. per week, in 1776 ((Raven 2007, pp 288-9). When James Williams, bookseller in Dublin, established his circulating library in 1764 his fees were 16s.3d. a year, 4s.6d. per quarter or 6d. a week (Public Gazetteer, 13 Oct 1764). Fees in the capital remained within the same range for the rest of the century, on average 6½d. per week, 5s.5d. per quarter, or 16s.3d. per year in the 1780s and 1790s. The circulating library at Essex Gate, Dublin, advertised at this rate in 1783, claiming that the charges equalled the ‘very moderate Terms at Bath’ (Volunteer’s Journal, 15 Dec 1783). Vincent Dowling conducted the Apollo Library in Suffolk Street, Dublin, in the 1790s, charging the same rate (Freeman’s Journal, 8 Sep 1792). Fees in the county towns could be a little higher as transport costs added to the overheads. In 1770 Thomas Lord in Cork was charging 17s.4d. a year, 10s. a half year, 5s.5d. a quarter and 2s.2d. a month (De la Cour 1770). In 1777 Michael Matthews, bookseller and stationer under the exchange in Cork, advertised his circulating library ‘on the most moderate terms’ (Cork Evening Post, 24 Apr 1777). Anthony Edwards in Castle Street, Cork, charged 16s.3d. per annum, 5s.5d. per quarter or 8d. per week in 1787, the annual and quarterly rates equal to those charged in Dublin (Hibernian Chronicle, 12 Apr 1787). The women proprietors who planned to set up a new library in Cork in 1794 proposed a lesser fee of 11s.4½d. per annum (Cork Gazette, 8 Feb 1794). The fees at Dominick Jacotin’s English, French and Italian circulating library in Patrick Street, Cork, were one guinea per year, 13s. for a half year, 8s.8d a quarter, 3s.9½d. per month, and one British shilling (1s.1d.) per week (Jacotin 1803). These elevated charges reflected the outlay involved with importing books from London, Paris and perhaps Italy. Mitchelstown circulating library charged 1s. per quarter in 1811 for perhaps a small selection of books (Townsend 1811).\n\nApollo Library catalogue (Dublin, 1792), title page. Antoine Gerna, Catalogue (Dublin, 1793), title page.\n\nCatalogues:\n\nThe operation of commercial lending libraries can be gleaned from a number of sources, especially advertising. Thomas Lord advertised his new circulating library under the Exchange Coffee House in Castle Street, Cork, in 1770, guaranteeing attendance from six in the morning until nine at night (De la Cour 1770, final leaf). For the most part borrowers had no access to the shelves and library stock could not be browsed. Catalogues were issued from which customers could choose their preferred titles. Titles were usually numbered, which acted as call numbers, and prices were sometimes given, which were used as replacement values if books were lost or damaged (Cabinet littéraire 1796). Servants were sent to the libraries to pick up the books. In Sheridan’s The rivals, the servant, Lucy, is sent in search of a list of novels, including The reward of constancy, The fateful connection, The mistakes of the heart: ‘I transferr’d half the town in search of it – I don’t believe there’s a circulating library in Bath I ha’n’t been at’ (Sheridan 1775, scene 2, p. 20). When planning their proposed new library in Cork the women proprietors made a point of advertising that the books could be browsed, ‘which, it is presumed, will be more pleasing than the usual method of sending Servants’ (Cork Gazette, 8 Feb 1794).\n\nFew catalogues or lists have survived, where examples are available it can be seen that most titles are present in single numbers, with more popular titles available in multiples. It is likely that catalogues were printed as they were needed in large numbers. Printed catalogues were frequently issued in London and other English and Scottish towns, often for a small charge of sixpence or one shilling. In Dublin William Spotswood issued a 68 page catalogue in 1782 while Dowling’s catalogue for the Apollo Library about 1793 ran to over 140 pages, and Richard Twigg’s 62 page catalogue was issued in 1797. Catharine Finn in Kilkenny advertised her catalogues, which included the terms of subscribing, and would be ready for delivery when the library opened on 21 July 1788, but no copies have survived (Finn’s Leinster Journal, 9-12 Jul 1788; 2-6 Aug 1788). John Connor informed his customers that catalogues of the library would be given gratis (Cork Gazette, 17 Apr 1793; 20 Apr 1793). Connor advertised a new catalogue in 1795, following his importation of 2,000 volumes from London (Cork Gazette, 5 Sep 1795). This is likely to be the catalogue.containing 1,310 titles, made up of novels, some in multiple copies, plays, memoirs, magazines and historical works (Loeber 1998, p. 2). In 1800 Connor offered a catalogue of new books, to be had at the library (Cork Advertiser, 3 May 1800). In 1803 Dominick Jacotin issued a Catalogue of the English, French and Italian circulating library and bookshop in Cork. Mitchelstown circulating library had a list of 123 titles in 200 volumes printed in Horace Townsend’s, Observations on Dr Copinger’s letter to the Dublin Society (Townsend 1811, pp 61-64).\n\nStock:\n\nCommercial circulating libraries and subscription libraries carried a substantially different stock. Circulating libraries stressed that they provided entertaining reading, and were geared towards the female reader, or towards young persons whose finances were slender. They specialised in lending novels, plays, magazines, essays, memoirs and other literary fare. Circulating libraries were particularly associated with lending novels, and were sometimes accused of corrupting impressionable young minds. Subscription libraries and reading societies focused on providing serious works representing the full range of contemporary knowledge, trying for a more broadly based stock, in addition to literary works they included history and the sciences, as well as multi volume periodicals and antiquarian titles. However, there was often an overlap in the offerings of different types of libraries. Lending libraries had extensive holdings, most amounting to thousands of volumes. New novels were imported from London or purchased from Dublin booksellers. In the eighteenth century circulating libraries were part of a bookselling enterprise, while they had a dedicated lending stock they also had the back-up of bookshop stock to make a broader range of topics available, and to sell off stock when no longer needed for lending.\n\nEdward Holland, A poetical miscellany (Cork, 1794), title page and advertisement.\n\nThomas Lord’s new circulating library under the Exchange Coffee House in Castle Street, Cork, offered new books as soon as published in 1770 (De la Cour 1770, final leaf). In 1777, when advertising his circulating library in Castle Street, under the Exchange, in Cork, Michael Matthews offered ‘the highest price for libraries and parcels of books’ (Cork Evening Post, 24 Apr 1777). It is not clear if this secondhand stock was exclusively for sale in his bookshop, or if some titles were available for lending. Anthony Edwards operated his circulating library from his bookshop at Castle Street, where in 1787 he advertised 6,000 volumes from London and Dublin (Hibernian Chronicle, 12 Apr 1787). London editions were likely to have been prized among readers as they represented the very latest in fashionable reading, and booksellers specifically advertised them. For example, in October 1792 Vincent Dowling’s Apollo library in Dublin advertised 1,000 new volumes just arrived from London, they included multi-volume novels, travel, memoirs and biographies (Freeman’s Journal, 20 Oct 1792). A year later, with a move to a more extensive premises on Suffolk Street, Dowling promised ‘every new work of merit constantly added to the collection, with all the London and Dublin magazines and reviews’ (Freeman’s Journal, 1 Oct 1793). John Connor’s circulating library at 17 Castle Street, Cork, contained ‘upwards of 4,000 volumes’ in 1794 and he offered to hire out every new publication (Holland 1794). He published an advertisement for his circulating library and bookshop in 1795, listing some of his new novels imported from London, with ‘upwards of two thousand volumes of the most approved books, in addition to his library, a catalogue of which will be published in a few days’ (Cork Gazette, 5 Sep 1795). His importation of new novels from London ensured that he carried the most up-to-date stock (Cork Gazette, 5 Sep 1795. Cork Advertiser, 3 May 1800). His own printing output was strong on novels, plays and poetry, as well as political pamphlets and trials.\n\nWhile a number of Dublin booksellers, such as Luke White, John Archer, William Wilson and Richard Edward Mercier, specialized in the sale of foreign language books in the 1780s and 1790s some libraries also lent French and Italian books: Thomas Jackson’s Universal circulating library in Dublin in 1784, lending French books, Gerna’s Cabinet littéraire in Dublin in 1790, stocking French and Italian books and periodicals, and Jacotin’s French and Italian circulating library in Cork by 1803. Their target audience was obviously more limited than that for most commercial libraries and their stock was broader. In August 1790 Antoine Gerna, bookseller at 31 College Green, Dublin, announced the establishment of his Cabinet littéraire ‘ou l’on pourra lire les Gazettes etrangères et d’autres imprimés utiles et agréables’ (Dublin Chronicle, 17 Aug 1790). The plan was to give the cabinet a broad appeal, stocking ‘every political Pamphlet, Magazine, Atlas, Globes, Spheres and Maps of Merit, with a Variety of historical, geographical, and commercial Books, to which will be added the best Military new Publications, and also those relative to the Gentlemen of the Faculty’ (Dublin Chronicle, 1 Jan 1791; 29 Jan 1791; 16 Feb 1792). It may not have been possible to borrow books from Gerna’s cabinet; newspapers, magazines and books may have had to be consulted in situ. The reading room was open from seven in the morning until eleven at night, and ‘had a constant fire and attendance’, Subscription was high, at two guineas per annum. Gerna issued a Catalogue des livres françois, italien, &c. in 1793 for his bookshop stock (Gerna 1793). A similar Cabinet littéraire was established in Edinburgh by 1796. It was a circulating library for French books run by bookseller Walter Berry, and the catalogue of 589 titles cost sixpence. Library subscribers paid one guinea per annum, or 7s. per quarter, and they were allowed to borrow two books at a time, or one book of new stock (Cabinet littéraire 1796). Books were ordered by number from the catalogue, and readers were requested to provide several numbers in order of preference, in case books were already on loan. Dominick Jacotin (sometimes Jacquottin) established the English, French and Italian circulating library and bookshop in Patrick Street, Cork before 1803. He imported stock from London and Paris and issued a catalogue in 1803 (Jacotin 1803). Only a fragment of this catalogue survives, listing just the English language titles. Jacotin was also a teacher of French and Italian in Cork from at least 1794 to 1828, teaching French and Italian in schools and running his own evening academy while his wife conducted the library and bookshop (Cork Advertiser, 2 Aug 1800; 21 Jun 1803; 25 Jun 1814; Connor’s Cork directory 1826; 1828).\n\nJohn Connor’s Circulating Library, a case study:\n\nThe most successful circulating library in Cork was conducted by John Connor (1792-1831), printer, bookseller, stationer and bookbinder, it was substantial in size and included a large percentage of works printed by Connor, either reprints of bestselling titles, or original works. He established his circulating library at 17, Castle Street, the corner of Corn Market, in the early 1790s (Cork Gazette, 17 Apr 1793; 20 Apr 1793), later moving to Chatterton’s Buildings, Grand Parade, by 1798. He moved from the Grand Parade to nearby Tuckey Street in the 1820s, and finally to Great George’s Street, within two doors of the Arcade in 1830 and 1831. In 1815 he was declared bankrupt, but he recovered his fortunes and continued his printing and bookselling business, however the library may have ceased operations (Dublin Gazette, 20 Jun 1815). He lost his two sons as young men, John Connor in 1810, aged 15, and Cornelius Connor in 1814, aged 22, ensuring that he had no successor in business (Cork Mercantile Chronicle, 23 May 1810; 6 May 1814; Cork Advertiser, 7 May 1814).\n\nJohn Rocque, Map of Cork city, 1759, detail showing Castle Street and Corn Market. Dublin Gazette, 20 Jun 1815, notice of bankruptcy.\n\nConnor ran an active printing business, printing newspapers, trial reports and political pamphlets, directories, Catholic religious works, plays, poetry, reprints of best selling novels, and original titles.
