        "text": "Perhaps it would help us all, both men and women, if we learned to look beyond the superficial. I am a single, straight male who cooks, likes clean bed linen and cut flowers and goes to concerts and the theatre alone.\n\nI sent my photo to a lonely hearts club once; they sent it back saying: “We’re not that lonely.” Excellent paper, keep up the good work.\n\nPeter McKinney, Wythenshawe, Manchester\n\nBritish myth exposed in the decline of Truss\n\nSir — I have reflected on the significance of Liz Truss’s resignation as British prime minister.\n\nI couldn’t help but think of the great Brexit lie peddled by so many and imbued with wartime myths of British uniqueness and greatness. It’s now wearing off.\n\nNow that Truss has left the stage, it’s my contention that this Tory project is moribund.\n\nJohn O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary\n\nBrexit takes a heavy toll on UK’s top job\n\nSir — As the UK sees its prime ministers fall like ninepins, we would do well to reflect that the real reason for this mess can be summed up in one word: Brexit.\n\nLeo Gormley, Dundalk, Co Louth\n\n​Panic stations are all too common now\n\nSir — The comings and goings in Westminster remind me of an old saying: “Let there be no panic, and even if there is, let it be organised panic.” Indeed.\n\nTom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9\n\n​England struggles on a wing and a prayer\n\nSir — I would never have thought that I would pray for England, but now I am. England is, in spite of everything, a really great country, deserving of better, and they really will have to get their act together.\n\nOf course, as their nearest neighbour, there is an element of self-interest in my prayer.\n\nAnthony Hanrahan, Renvyle, Co Galway\n\n​Bringing Boris back another bizarre twist\n\nSir — The festival of folly and fun shows no sign of slowing down in British politics. Liz Truss sacks herself as PM due to being so out of her depth it was embarrassing.\n\nNow there is talk of Boris Johnson putting his name forward. Well, why not: let’s get recession done?\n\nVincent O’Connell, New Ross, Co Wexford\n\nPoliticians have truly gone down the toilet\n\nSir — Quentin Letts, British parliamentary sketch-writer extraordinaire, was on Today with Claire Byrne last week, hilariously depicting Labour Party leader Keir Starmer as a “straight lavatory brush” in personality.\n\nHearing that, I cast my mind around to identify such candidates on the Irish political scene. I concluded our own crop are all bendy.\n\nOliver McGrane, Rathfarnham, Dublin 16\n\nNew generation face same old mistakes\n\nSir — There was a time when people said the Irish had “too much history”, but the post-Good Friday Agreement generation has not had enough, apparently.\n\nI have been familiar with the “Up the ’Ra” shouts since the 1970s. Last summer in West Cork I heard a wedding party breaking out with the same chorus. Why?\n\nColin Murphy (Sunday Independent, October 16) reminds us of the death toll caused by Irish nationalist paramilitaries: 1,768 people during the Troubles.\n\nThis is a very sensitive time, with talk of reunification, while the Westminster government descends into chaos. Be very careful what one wishes for.\n\nPieter Tesch, Croydon, Surrey\n\n​Media strike just one note over ballad row\n\nSir — A lot has been written in relation to the subject of questionable ballads being chanted.\n\nBut what is deeply disturbing is the fact that only nationalists/Sinn Féin are expected to apologise and grovel. Rarely have I ever heard the unionist establishment ask their communities to apologise for similar or worse offences.\n\nEilis O’Hanlon and other journalists in your paper have been exacerbating this situation for years.\n\nSinn Féin seems to be rising in the polls irrespective of this imbalanced journalism.\n\nMartin Walsh, Wicklow town\n\n​O’Hanlon is offside in football song scandal\n\nSir — Eilis O’Hanlon writes that “excusing what the Irish football team did simply plays into the hands of ruthless political delinquents”. Who is a “ruthless political delinquent” and who is not?\n\nChe Guevara was a mass murderer, O’Hanlon writes, and she’s right. But what about former US presidents Bush, Truman and Trump?\n\nStop writing nonsense.\n\nIan De Neubourg, Killarney\n\n​Sinn Féin critics bury heads in the sand\n\nSir — There’s a scene in the 2017 film The Post, where editor Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks, says to his news team: “Is anybody else tired of reading the news instead of reporting it?”\n\nThat scene came to mind when reading your editor’s letter (October 16) that asked the question “so what does it all mean?” in relation to the deepening split between generations and the rise of Sinn Féin.\n\nOne could be forgiven for thinking the institutions of our democracy are under threat or the freedom of the press is being challenged. What is under the microscope is the status quo, and elements in the mainstream media are having a hard time understanding the implications of this.\n\nIf Sinn Féin is so successful at getting its message across despite many of its supporters never picking up a print edition of your newspaper, something is happening all right.\n\nAs Bradlee would no doubt say, it’s up to the press to do their jobs and report what is really going on. Scratching your heads in desperation is unlikely to do anyone any good, least of all the Sunday Independent.\n\nTom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry\n\n​Therapist has been a Peerless sleeping aid\n\nSir — I had to laugh when I read that Brendan O’Connor listens to Marisa Peer while trying to get sleep, as I do the same (People & Culture, October 16).\n\nI look forward to hearing about his attempt to contact her. Not only is it good to say “I am enough”; it is also good to say when you have had enough of a bad situation. “I am enough, but I have had enough” could be the mantra.\n\nMaria O’Donovan, Co Cork\n\n​Lenihan given every chance to save stories\n\nSir — Your article of October 9, stating that the storyteller Eddie Lenihan is to gift a treasure trove of recordings to a US university, incorrectly stated in its headline that this decision followed “apathy from Irish institutions”.\n\nIn fact, the Department of Folklore and Ethnology at UCC and the National Folklore Collection, UCD, have at various times visited Eddie, discussed his collection with him and offered assistance in the safeguarding of these recordings through digitisation and archival deposit.\n\nWith regard to my department’s interest in his work, he has been a regular visitor from at least 2011, often visiting twice yearly as a paid speaker in the intervening years down to 2019.\n\nBeyond that, our wish that his collection be safeguarded was clear through our offers of support.\n\nDr Clíona O’Carroll, Lecturer, Folklore and Ethnology, UCC\n\n​Cahill shows class as he calls time at RTÉ\n\nSir — Des Cahill’s announcement last week that he is to step back from presenting The Sunday Game after 15 seasons came as no surprise to me.\n\nOne of the most endearing aspects of Des is that he wears his heart on his sleeve and, in this regard, his discomfort – albeit most always well-disguised – with the growing constraints on his presentation was unmistakable.\n\nIt is a further measure of the man that in these circumstances he decided to call it a day. So, in addition to thanking him for 15 seasons of the programme, his candour in the matter should above all be appreciated.\n\nMichael Gannon, St Thomas’s Square, Kilkenny\n\n​Mass media have key role in democracy\n\nSir — In the last sentence of his article on October 16, Gene Kerrigan tells us that “people resent being told what to think and how to vote”. As is shown in Conor Skehan’s article on the same day, in which Skehan says “slick social media use can turn clicks to votes”, the opposite can be argued to be the case.\n\nMass media constitute a very powerful institution in all democracies. Being human, it is just as likely to make mistakes as other democratic institutions.\n\nFor example, the election of Trump and the vote for Brexit had the support of a large section of the media. On the other hand, the survival of democracy in much of the world is due to the media’s contribution to the democratic discourse.\n\nThis democracy has survived for a century with a free media. It has, however, been less than perfect. One political group was in power for 75pc of the time between 1930 and 2010, and that year saw a record-breaking collapse and consequent bailout.\n\nOur mass media contributed significantly to the background conditions in which these events occurred. Suffice to say, the media are important and have a big influence on how we vote.\n\nAnthony Leavy, Sutton, Dublin 13\n\n​No logic to high cost of gas and electricity\n\nSir — The softer we become, the weaker and poorer we will become. We are allowing a minority group of people to control our economy, our decisions and our choices while they profit. We are heading in to poverty like we have not seen in many generations.\n\nThere is no logic to the cost of gas and electricity — businesses will go bankrupt and people will be living on the breadline.\n\nWe are going to become the most uncompetitive economy in the world.\n\nWe need to start buying gas and oil directly from other countries. We must end this madness of allowing a small group of people to control and destroy our lives.\n\nDavid Hennessy, Dawson Street, Dublin 2\n\nDiesel price is driving the cost of living crisis\n\nSir — Why is diesel now more expensive than petrol? It is less refined and costs less to produce, and for many years it was always cheaper at the pumps.\n\nThe Government’s temporary cut in excise duty reduced petrol by 21c but reduced diesel by only 16c per litre.\n\nWith transport relying on diesel for deliveries to shops and supermarkets, doesn’t this just add to the cost of living?\n\nWith the increase in fuel prises, most people are cutting back as best they can, but deliveries and industry must go on. Can someone please explain to me why this makes sense to the Government?\n\nBrian Lube, Kilcock, Co Meath​\n\nLeo Varadkar never said a truer word\n\nSir — Tánaiste Leo Varadkar was correct when referring to the findings of the recent Commission on Taxation and Welfare as something he would expect from a populist party like Sinn Féin.\n\nUnfortunately, it was his government that made the appointments to the commission, with the likelihood that it will be Sinn Féin who will implement its findings.\n\nDenis Larkin, Mullingar, Co Westmeath\n\n​Bad planning is why we’re in this mess\n\nSir — Colm McCarthy’s focus on the physical planning system (‘We won’t solve housing crisis until TDs take on the Nimby brigade’) completely misses the elephant in the room.\n\nOur housing crisis is an example of the governing network’s failure of foresight on a much wider and deeper scale.\n\nWe face an electricity supply shortage because public authorities did not act on warnings about generation adequacy over years.\n\nDitto for water services. The cyber attack on the HSE was eased by poor management of the IT systems.\n\nAfter the financial crash, the State watched as housing output dropped to fewer than 3,000 completions a year — less than 10pc of what was needed.\n\nManaging the State for our common good requires consistent discipline over decades, not electoral or business cycles. Government now seems to be little more than the bureaucratic mediation of interest groups.\n\nDonal O’Brolcáin, Drumcondra, Dublin\n\n​TDs cannot take on the Nimby brigade\n\nSir — Colm McCarthy wants our TDs to take on the Nimby brigade to help solve the housing crisis. It won’t happen.\n\nTDs are only reflecting the views of the electorate (older people usually, not younger), and they know their jobs are on the line if they vote contrary to the wishes of their constituents. They have families to clothe and feed and mortgages to pay. They cannot afford to lose their seats.\n\nWe may blame all the governments of the past, but it is us, the general population, who have created this problem.\n\nSinn Féin will promise anything that will get them in to power. They have no interest in solving the housing problem. It’s just a tool for getting votes to enable them to achieve their single aim: their particular version of a united Ireland.\n\nAnthony Hanrahan, Renvyle, Co Galway\n\n​You will not find any news in the fridge\n\nSir — I might not be alone in saying that what Leo Varadkar chooses to keep in his fridge is his own business and should not concern anyone else, least of all RTÉ radio’s News at One.\n\nMike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare\n\nPursuit of peace is role of neutral state\n\nSir — Instead of involving himself in the Ukraine war to the extent that our foreign minister is offering Irish military expertise to the forces of that country’s army, would it not be more in keeping with his political brief to promote peace talks with Russia?\n\nWe aren’t at war, yet the Government behaves as if we are.\n\nPeace is the role that must be pursued when Simon Coveney represents this neutral republic in dealings with foreign warring nations, especially in Europe.\n\nRobert Sullivan, Bantry, Co Cork\n\n​Take the price fight to the shop doors\n\nSir — The new battlefield in this cost-of-living emergency is the supermarket, with canyons of grocery products that supermarkets owners want you to take from their shelf to yours.\n\nFor years, Irish supermarkets have feasted on the Irish consumer. Their annual profits give these companies the financial heft to absorb supply chain increases without using the consumer as a money sponge.\n\nApps, loyalty cards and vouchers are nothing more than retail fool’s gold. Shoppers need to be more vocal and raise the price rises issue with their local supermarket manager.\n\nJohn Tierney, Fews, Co Waterford\n\n​Abortion provision is adequate already\n\nSir — The Oireachtas Health Committee, according to an RTÉ report, is greatly exercised that ‘only’ 413 GPs nationally have signed up to provide abortions, and ‘only’ 11 maternity hospitals have done so. ​\n\nIn a small country like ours, it is difficult to see how this is in any way inadequate access.\n\nJim Stack, Lismore, Co Waterford"
