        "meta_description": "The rumble of thunder didn't bode well yesterday but thankfully the morning turned out fine and just as well as we had a little surpise for our Under 8s after yesterday's training session. We brought an Under 8 team over to the Complex to take part in an invitational blitz involving teams from Clonmel Town, Home Farm and Clerihan. Everyone who follows soccer in Clonmel will know Ollie Cahill as one of the most successful players the town has produced. After playing with his local club Clonmel Town (don't always believe Wikipedia and we're not responsible for that!!) Ollie went on to enjoy a great career in the League of Ireland playing close to 500 games. He is also the joint record holder for the most games (41) a domestic player has played in European competition. Ollie is now involved with Home Farm in the Leinster Senior League and a few weeks ago he contacted Tony Scully, Clonmel Town U8 coach about organising a blitz. Tony decided to enhance the eventÂ by inviting two other local clubs i.e. Clerihan and ourselves hence our partipation. Our boys played two games against Clonmel Town and two against Home Farm. It was an enjoyable morning and more importantly a great learning experience for our boys. After the games there was food and refresments for everyone prepared by the hard working Clonmel Town Ladies committee. Tony wound up the morning by thanking everyone who took part especially Home Farm who travelled from Dublin. We know a lot of work goes into organising these events so well done and thanks again to Tony and Clonmel Town.",
