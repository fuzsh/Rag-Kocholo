Click To Pray (www.clicktopray.org) is a platform that invites men and women from around the world, to accompany the Pope in a mission of compassion for the world. It has a website and a mobile app, both for Android and iOS, with its social networks, available in six languages. Click To Pray has three main sections: ‘Pray with the Pope’, with the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions for the challenges facing humanity and the mission of the Church; ‘Pray every day’, and ‘Pray with the network’ that is a space where users (Pope Francis among them) can share their prayers with the others. Pope’s Francis own profile (https://www.clicktopray.org/en/user/popefrancis) can be found clicking on the Pope Francis button at the ‘Pray with the Network’ section.\n\nDid I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone’s face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and\n\nresentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? The love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come.\n\nHenri Nouwen\n\nReflection for World Day of Prayer for the Sick 11th February\n\nThe Church’s maternal vocation to the needy and to the sick has found concrete expression throughout the two thousand years of her history in an impressive series of initiatives on behalf of the sick. This history of dedication must not be forgotten. It continues to the present day throughout the world. In countries where adequate public health care systems exist, the work of Catholic religious congregations and dioceses and their hospitals is aimed not only at providing quality medical care, but also at putting the human person at the centre of the healing process, while carrying out scientific research with full respect for life and for Christian moral values. In countries where health care systems are inadequate or non-existent, the Church seeks to do what she can to improve health, eliminate infant mortality and combat widespread disease. The image of the Church as a ‘field hospital’ that welcomes all those wounded by life is a very concrete reality, for in some parts of the world, missionary and diocesan hospitals are the only institutions providing necessary care to the population.\n\nPope Francis (Message for 2018)\n\nDistributors Boxes with Weekly Envelopes will be available in the Parish Shop for Delivery from Monday 11th February.\n\nCHURCH SERVICES TV UPDATE\n\nMany thanks to all who donated a poinsettia or donated towards the parish calendar before Christmas.

One of the earliest references to it comes from 1910, when it began to be used as a prayer for the French scouting movement. To this day it is often known as “The Scout Prayer” and is used by many Scout groups as a blueprint for the work they do.\n\nThe prayer perfectly sums up the generous spirit of the many volunteer organisations and charities whose members give their time and energy so freely and generously to help others. There are thousands of volunteers all over our country who put love into action by visiting those who are lonely, listening to those who are struggling, providing food and other supplies for those in need, and fundraising for all sorts of worthy causes. Week in and week out, they give without ever counting the cost.\n\nThese volunteers are living the message of today’s Gospel, which can be summed up in one short sentence: Go the extra mile. Thank you, Lord, for volunteers. Make us ever more generous with our time, energy and resources. Help us to be compassionate, as you are compassionate Tríona Doherty\n\nIntercom Newsletter Resources\n\nFirst Friday\n\nNext Friday, 1st March is the First Friday of the month, a day when we bring Holy Communion to the sick and housebound of our parish.

This familiar saying paraphrases the words of Jesus in today’s Gospel: ‘I tell you solemnly, no prophet is ever accepted in his own country.’ We might find ourselves sympathising with Jesus on this front: that feeling that no matter what we have done in our adult life, in our homeplace we are still identified with the child we were or the family we came from. Sadly there are some who seem to delight in taking others down a peg or two and ensuring they don’t get ideas ‘above their station’.\n\nPerhaps we ourselves have this tendency sometimes. We can be guilty of pigeonholing people, of silencing their voices because their message comes in the wrong package. We don’t always recognise the prophets among us. Do we listen to young people’s opinions? Do we dismiss the experience and wisdom of elderly people? Are we biased against certain groups of people, or do we shoot people down before they even speak, just because we have disagreed with something they said in the past?\n\nJesus, the carpenter’s son, faces this attitude in today’s Gospel. Returning home to Nazareth he impresses his former neighbours at first with his preaching. But as soon as he challenges them, they turn on him. They refuse to listen to his message of hope and inclusion. They hustle him out of town and attempt to throw him from a cliff. Josephs son should not be speaking to them in this manner. Joseph’s son should know his place.\n\nTríona Doherty – Intercom News Resources\n\nSOUTH TIPPERARY GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\nBishop Cullinan has been informed by the management of South Tipperary General Hospital and the HSE, that they are no longer able to provide clergy with a list of parishioners who are Inpatients in the hospital.

Dirty sort of talk is not going to bring her back to life. She’s in heaven and we shall meet again. I will pray for these men tonight and every night. ”These words of Gordon Wilson echoed across the world in 1987, just hours after his 20-year-old daughter Marie was killed in an IRA bomb in Enniskillen. Very few words in the history of the Northern Ireland conflict had such a powerful impact. His extraordinary capacity to forgive the people who had caused him so much pain helped to move along the slow process.”\n\nGordon Wilson was the personification of the words of Jesus: love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. ”It is one of the most difficult and challenging passages in the Gospels; one commentator calls it “Jesus” most unreasonable command.” Living under oppressive Roman rule, with torture and murder not uncommon, the disciples knew what it was to hate their enemies. As we read and listen to the news today, the cruelty of people continues to astound and upset us. But Jesus reminds us that everyone is human. All are children of God, who “causes his sun to rise on bad men as well as good.” While we clearly don’t accept or excuse the terror and evil in the world, we cannot dehumanise those who carry out despicable actions. It is much easier said than done, but we must strive to meet hatred with love. With God, there is always forgiveness; there is always hope.\n\n“Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr\n\nIntercom News Resources\n\nLent\n\nNext Wednesday 26th February is the Start of Lent.

We would encourage the following to be\n\nimplemented at this time:\n\n1. Holy Communion – extra vigilance in washing ones hands before administering Holy Communion. This applies to the celebrant and extraordinary ministers. Hand gels are provided.\n\n2. It is advised that Holy Communion be given only into the hands, and not on the tongue at this time.\n\n3. The HSE advise that only the priest receives from the Chalice at this time. (We will provide separate chalices to those who can receive from the chalice only)\n\n4. While the shaking of hands is deemed to be low-risk and following sensible guidelines with regard to the Sign of Peace  perhaps it is best with this current outbreak that the Sign of Peace be confined to a smile or a bow and the shaking of hands be suspended for now. Please refrain from handshaking.\n\n5. We advise those who have flu symptoms to remain at home. You can access a Mass on television or radio on 107.9 FM, or on EWTN. For our live-streaming service, go to www.churchservices.tv Search “Clonmel” and select SS Peter & Paul’s or St Marys.\n\n6. All hand washing facilities will be well maintained, and all hard surfaces which are frequently touched e.g. door handles, hand rails, pews, will be regularly cleaned.\n\n7. Holy Water fonts will not be used at this time.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please contact the HSE Live\n\nhelpline on 1850 24 1850 for advice.\n\nCanon Brendan Crowley & Fr Michael Toomey\n\nSignposts on the Road to Emmaus “Exploring the Mass”\n\nBeginning on Thursday 5th March, over four weeks during Lent, we will place ourselves in the story of the Road to Emmaus, giving participants a renewed understanding of the Mass we celebrate.\n\nSession One “ We gather in the footsteps of Christ “ we will explore the gathering rite.\n\nSession Two “ Christ speaks to us in the Scriptures today “ we will explore the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nSession Three “ Christ is our Host” we will explore the Liturgy of the Eucharist.\n\nSession Four “ We are sent to become what we have received “ we will explore the dismissal rite.\n\nEach evening will begin at 7.30pm in the hall at the Church of the Resurrection and will be facilitated by Mary Dee, Diocesan Liturgy Office.
