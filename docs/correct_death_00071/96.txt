Gamal Abdel Nasser, the 2nd president of Egypt, died on 28 September 1970, at age 52. Abdel Nasser, one of the most respected and revered Arab leaders, died suddenly after bidding farewell to the Emir of Kuwait at the airport, as soon as the work of the emergency Arab summit ended. Vice president Anwar Sadat gave a speech to the nation announcing the death of Nasser.[1] After the news of his death came out, Egyptian television and radio hastily began reciting the verses of the Qur'an.[2] Nasser had never recovered from the second stroke in four years.[2]

He was succeeded by his vice president, Anwar Sadat. His funeral was attended by millions of Egyptians and foreign mourners, including leaders. At least 46 people were killed and 80 injured in the stampede.[1] The United Arab Republic declared 40 days of mourning,[3] India three days,[4] and Algeria at least three days. Cuba, East Germany and Yugoslavia also declared one day of mourning each.
