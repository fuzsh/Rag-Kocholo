I believe that it was a tragic mistake to give this aid to Nasser without con- ditions of any kind. I wish to call to the attention of my colleagues a remarkable study, recently prepared by the research staff of the Anti-Defamation League, dealing with Nasser's worldwide anti-Jewish activi- ties. I heard of the existence of this 'study' last week, and I asked for an advance copy of the document because I felt that this situation has, or should have, a very direct bearing on Public Law 480 ship- ments, or aid of any other kind, to the Nasser regime. The document has not yet been pub- lished, but I am so impressed by the facts compiled in this study and by their per- tlnence to the entire question of our re- lations with the United Arab Republic, that I have asked and have been given permission to insert them into the REc- ORD for the information of Congress. I ask unanimous consent to insert into the RECORD, at the conclusion of my re- marks, the complete text of the study on \"Arab Anti-Jewish Activities in the United States,\" prepared by the Anti- Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith. The PRESIDING OFFICER. With- out objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. DODD.

This is the latest conclusion in a continuing study of Arab sources-official government publica- tions, tightly regulated domestic newspapers and magazines, and the voluminous output of worldwide information services. The study points out that in a pam- phlet entitled \"Who Benefits From Anti- Semitism?\" published by the Arab In- formation Center and available from the United Arab Republic Embassy in this country, the Jews are assailed with nu- merous quotations from that most dis- credited of all spurious documents, the so-called protocols of the Elders of Zion. The study quotes the following passage from the Scribe-April 1964-a monthly magazine published in Cairo in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish: At the risk of being accused o anti-bean ism (sic), we want, in the single pursuit o th, to prove that President Kennedy, ins ike the two American Presidents assessi ted before him, was the victim of a Zion Yemeni Government and we evth? Frel \"\"01 1 frained from any statement of at cial condemnation such as we made the time of the Indian Invasion of Goa. In response to this show of restraint on our part, Nasser has now increased his forces in Yemen to 50,000 men, and he has mounted campaigns of infiltra- tion and subversion directed against the other countries of the Arabian Peninsula. Beyond indicating our mild displeas- ure, or perhaps I should say beyond in- dicating our strong displeasure mildly, we have failed to react to Nasser's open support of the Congo rebellion, to the massive arms buildup carried out with the help of the Soviet Union and German scientists, and to the unyielding belliger- ence he has displayed toward the State of Israel. Even the sacking and destruct o U.S. Embassy installations, with t e in- R H dulgence and most probably witti the inspiration of the Egyptian authorities, brought no reaction beyond an ostensibly stern demand for indemnification- which Nasser was quick to promise. In February of this year, the Senate voted against continued Public Law 480 shipments to the United Arab Republic. However, the resolution barring such shipments was amended at the request of the administration in a manner which ilkes Booth, murderer of President Abra tam Lincoln, and Leon Czolgosz, who assns mated President McKinley, were both Jew n the service of the Zionist cause. newspaper as saying that \"what Hitler did to the Jews was simply revenge for what they did to Christ.\" Still another article quoted from an Arab newspaper says: The Jews are use to living on f others, and whatever the Jewish people ave achieved was mainly arrived at by eans of disorders which they themselves rovoked to help attain their goal. The Communist revolution in Russia was orga- ized by the Jews for their own ends. orld War II against Hitler was a Jewish war. These are only a few of the many, many exhibits compiled by the research- ers of the Anti-Defamation League. In deciding last month to renew Pub- lic Law 480 shipments to Egypt, the ad- ministration was unquestionably guided by the conviction that, as difficult as Nasser may be, we must do everything in our power to prevent his further aliena- tion. If we decide to get tough with Nasser, so the argument goes, it may result in a complete rupture of his al- ready tenuous ties with the West and force him into the arms of the Com- munists. Out of fear of driving Nasser irrevoc- ably into the arms of the Communists, we have, ever since the Suez crisis, turned the. other cheek to each new af- front by Nasser and to each violation of The berserk quality of this propaganda is terribly reminiscent of \"Der Stuermer\" and Stretcher and Goebbels. To rational men, its sheer insanity may appear to render it ineffective. But, as I learned in painful detail at the Nuremberg trials, such malicious nonsense can poison the minds of millions of people; and -once they are thus poisoned, they become ca- pable of unspeakable atrocities against the objecl;s of their hatred. Thi$ new Arab anti-Semitic propa- ganda, like Nazi propaganda in its own day, is nothing less than an incitation to. murder. And if, in the interest of avoiding offense to the Nasserite ex- tremists, we close our eyes to the poten- tial consequences, we reduce ourselves left Public Law 480 shipments to the dis- cretion of the executive branch. I voted against this amendment, because~,~ as I stated on the floor on February 4 5.d e tRGH that it makes no sense for Cong ss to pass on the details of our foreign aid program, and then have the executive branch override the intent of Congress whenever, in its opinion, the national interest demands it. I \"Relieve that the stand I took at that time has been borne out by the events of the past several weeks. As we should have learned from past experience, our new offer of aid to the Nasser regime has brought only more abuse from the Egyptian press and radio, and more praise for Moscow and Peiping. In this connection, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks an article in the Baltimore Sun for Sat- urday, July 3, captioned \"U.S. Food Aid Disparaged by Egyptians : Radio Stations Belittle Johnson Action but Praise Russ Help.\" The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I bring these items to the attention of my colleagues because I believe that the time has come fora fundamental re- examination of our relations with ex- tremist dictators like Nasser.__ , . All of Qur massive aid has given, us absolutely no influence with Nasser. On the contrary, it seems only to have fed his contempt for us. All our attempts to placate and ap- pease him have only resulted in further abuse and more aggression-yes, and ultimately in the growing alienation which we seek to avoid., If we had forgotten the previous les- song of history on this score, we should at least have learned from our very recent experience with Sukarno. A policy of firmness from the begin- ning in our dealings with Sukarno would, in my opinion, have obliged him to pursue a more moderate policy. At the very least it would have encouraged the more moderate elements in his coun- try. But, instead of firmness, we dealt with Sukarno as we are still dealing with Nasser. We lavished aid on him, , We ignored his _ abuse, ignored the frequent attacks on American Embassy installations, ig- nored the consistent diplomatic aline- ment with the Communist countries against the free world, ignored the mas- sive buildup of Soviet weapons. We even went so far as to. give him our support for his imperialist grab of West New Guinea., The omentum of the course he was pursuing has now carried Sukarno al- most to the end of the road. He has withdrawn from the United Nations and has virtually severed relations with the free world. Bolstered by the support,he was receiving from both the Communist world and the United States, he has moved progressively to undermine the once-powerful moderate elements, em- ploying the salami tactics made famous by the Communists. And, now a point has been reached where most Westgrn commentators fear that Indonesia, un- der Sukarno, has become, or is rapidly becoming, a de facto member of the Communist camp. Such has ,been the consequence of the policy of avoiding offense to Sukarno, I gravely fear that, if we persist in the policy, of avoiding offense to Nasser, the ultimate consequence may be very little different. Because we refuse to offend Nasser, we cannot officially 'oppose or expose his anti-Jewish propaganda. Because we refuse to offend him, or to openly disapprove of his actions, we can- not, clearly demarcate ourselves mQr- ally from the many acts of , aggression Nasser. has already perpetrated against his. Arab neighbors, or from the major aggression he is plotting against Israel. Nasser does not speak for the entire Arab world. He speaks for only an ex- tremist segment of it. I think it would vastly improve our posture before the entire world, including the Arab world, if we made further American aid to Nas- ser contingent on his peaceful behavior. I think it would contribute to the peace and stability of the Near East if we spoke up in a strong voice against the crimes of the Nasser regime against its neighbors and against its own people. We must continue, as I have said be- fore, to offer Nasser the hand of friend- ship. But we must stop kowtowing to him, or muting our disapproval of his actions. Only such a combination of friendship and firmness stands any chance of per- suading Nasser that it is in his interest and in the interests of his people to abandon his present dangerous path and instead seek a regional settlement that would assure peace to the peoples of the Middle East. Especially on the question of the vi- cious anti-Jewish agitation now being carried on by his propagandists, it is important that we let Nasser know where we stand. Only several months ago, the Senate voted unanimously for a resolution, which I was honored to cosponsor, ex- pressing our moral condemnation of the persecution of the ,Jewish religion and other religions of the Soviet regime. We took this action because we believed that this was a matter that properly con- cerned us and that it was incumbent on us to express our indignation to the world. I consider the massive international anti-Jewish agitation being carried on by extremist elements in the Arab com- munity to be a matter that appeals equally to our conscience. Perhaps this is a matter, too, on which the Senate of the United States should let the people of the world know where it stands. Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. DODD. I yield. Mr. GRUENING. I commend the Sen- ator from Connecticut highly for his constructive criticism of Dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser. The statement of the Senator from Connecticut is one additional indictment on a series of acts that we in the United States seem not only to condone but also to subsidize. , The list of these violations, the ag- gressive acts of this dictator, the waging of war in Yemen, while we pour our money into Egypt for the relief of the undernourished and poor citizens of Egypt, is positively shocking. The list of his other aggressions and planned ag- gressions, his mutiple acts of violence and hate, are well known to the Senate. However, the indictment should lie not only against Nasser, but also against those in our administration who persist in appeasing him. Such indictment may apply not orily to the executive branch, It may be that we should be somewhat critical also of some of our own col- leagues who take the actions of the Sen- ate to conference, after an overwhelming 15339 vote that aid to Nasser should cease, and, almost invariably and without exception, the actions of the Senate are deleted in conference. I believe that it is about time that we had an extended debate on how long we shall subsidize such characters when their every act is a violation of every principle that the United States es- pouses. Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am ex- tremely pleased that the Senator from Alaska made that comment. The com- ment needed to be made. _ I wholeheartedly agree with what the Senator said. I assure him that I will do my best and I know that he will do his best to see whether we can change our policy toward governments that are so hostile to us. Mr. HARRIS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. DODD. I yield. Mr. HARRIS. Mr.: President, I asso- ciate myself with the remarks of the Sen- ator from Alaska and the Senator from Connecticut, concerning aid to Nasser. The Senator will recall that, by a vote of 73 to 13, the Senate agreed to an amendment in the foreign aid authoriza- tion bill, declaring. that no aid should go to either Egypt or Indonesia so long as either of those countries continue their acts of aggression against our country. We now have a finding by the Senate that these countries are continuing their acts of aggression against our country. Reports filter down to me from the con- ference to the effect that that section of the bill has been deleted and that the measure will come back to the Senate shorn of the amendment which was agreed to by a vote of 73 to 13. This ac- tion in conference would be taken in spite of the fact that the State Department now admits that it has under investiga-, tion reports that Nasser is in violation of our 1962 agreement with him and, in vio- lation of the agreement, has been selling rice in excess of the agreed amount to the Communist bloc countries, including Cuba and China, against which countries we have embargoes. If that particular bill comes back to the Senate without that amendment included therein, with regard to Sukarno and Nas- ser, I hope the Senate will refuse to agree to the conference report. I commend the distinguished Senator from Connecticut for his remarks, which further strengthen the position of the Senate. Mr. DODD. I am grateful to the Sen- ator from Oklahoma. Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr DODD. I yield. Mr. RIBICOFF. I commend my dis- tinguished colleague the Senator from Connecticut for making this case co- gently clear and bringing the matter to the attention of the Senate and of the country. I believe that the Senator has per- formed a most useful service. I should like to associate myself with the remarks and comments of my dis- tinguished colleague the Senator from Connecticut.

Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleague joins me in this action, ,as I have joined him. I believe that we are making progress. I am glad that I was able to bring the matter to the attention of the Senate. Mr. LAUSCHE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. DODD. I yield. Mr. LAUSCHE. I associate myself with the remarks made by the Senator ;root Connecticut. I particularly sub- scribe to his statement that our policy of helping our enemies and looking In- differentlY and sometimes with coolness upoll our friends, Is the main ' cause of our problems. There are men in the State Depart- ment who believe that we can, by ap- peasement and by the spending of money, win the friendship of dictators who are basically and philosophically opposed to what we do. Nasser is a good example. He has flouted our flag. He has burned our buildings. He has challenged the honor of our Nation. And yet those men in the State Department, in the face of these actions, believe that, by pleas and by gentle considerations, we can win Nasser to our side. The fact Is that the more we help him, the more we supply him, the greater Is his challenge, because he be- lieves if he threatens to join the Com- munist forces we will yield still more. I Ommerid the Senator. Mr. DODD... I thank the Senator from Ohio, Mr. MILER. Mr. President, will the .Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator from Iowa. Mr. MILLED?,. I also join the other Senators who have spoken in commen- dation of the Senator for making this most timely statement. In addition to other violations, Mr. Nasser and his gov- the ernment are very delinquent to Jnfted Nations in their dues and as- ses=Lei ts. That is only one of many other factors-that ought to be taken into account. I say to the junior Senator from Okla- homa [Mr. HARRIS] that we have been through this before. We have put amendments in the foreign aid bill In the Senate, and we have seen them taken out in conference. As sure as we are present here In the Senate tonight, Mr. Nasser is counting on action by the State Department with the conferees to take the amendment out of the bill. I hope he will be disappointed, but if pre- vious history is borne out again, he will not be disappointed. I dislike to say this, but that is the way it has been. I CPYRGHIink it is most unfortunate. I hope the conferees will stand firm, but do not count on it. EXHIErS 1 ARAB ANTI-SEMITISM Against Arab claims in regard to their writings, broadcasts, and press dispatches that they are solely anti-Israel and anti ' 1onist-standg the documented record o their own words. ' It is a record of the most malevolent international hate canipaig against Jews as Jews since the Hitler years and it bears the seal of the highest position of Arab officialdom. Anti-Semitism-hard core and deliberate in design-Is now, despite pious and often heated denials, a distinct mark of the au- thorized propaganda of the Arab world. This is the latest conclusion in a continuing study of Arab sources-official government publi- cations, tightly regulated domestic news- papers and magazines, and the voluminous output of worldwide information services. ATTACKS ON JEWS Though political war against the State of Israel may be the ultimate purpose of Arab propaganda efforts, the means to this end are often vicious attacks on the Jews them- selves, regardless of nationality or political belief, and on their religion. In fact, in notable instances the political issue of Israel Is so unrelated to the questions involved as to be obviously only the thinnest excuse for open defamation of the Jewish people in all parts of the world. Two well-documented examples--a barrage of' scurrilous anti- Semitic canards attempting to cite a Jewish plot behind the assassination of Presi- dent Kennedy; recent Arab pressure on the Roman Catholic Church to uphold the \"guilt\" of all Jews in all times for the killing of Christ-serve to demonstrate both the turn to undisguised anti-Semitism in official propaganda and the surprisingly unsubtle techniques involved. An Arab propagandist in the United States may write that charges \"that Arabs are anti- Semitic * * * are not only false but ridicu- lous\" '-but in January 1965, English-speak- ing areas in Africa were flooded with copies of a pamphlet, \"Israel, The Enemy of Africa,\" vilifying the Jewish faith and labeling all Jews as cheats, thieves, and murders. Its authors cite and quote directly from the' \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" and Henry Ford's \"The International Jew,\" two of history's most vicious and most thoroughly discredited anti-Jewish tracts. Released by the Information Department of the United Arab Republic in Cairo, the pamphlet is available from the United Arab Republic Embassy in Washington, D.C. Such official sources prove undeniable government policy. But the rigorous press censorship practiced in Arab lands, especially in Egypt, points also to government aip- proval-if not to actual government origin- Of articles and opinions published in the leading daily newspapers. \"Spot the Jew\"-with this headline, Fala- stin, a Jerusalem (Jordan) daily, began its account of the tragic events in Dallas in November 1963. Emphasizing the fact that Jack Ruby was Jewish, the Arab propagan- dists discovered a blood conspiracy in far-off Texas, and the winds of hatred were fanned. On November 25, the authoritative Egyp- tian daily, Al-Gomhouria of Cairo, reported the assassination's aftermath in a. column by Nasser ed-Din An-Nashashibi: \"In the same part of town * * * Ken- nedy's killer fell in his own life blood. \"All eyes are turned to the new killer- the murderer of the assassin. He is a night club owner named Jack Rubinstein * * * a Jew, of course. \"It has already been proved beyond all shadow of doubt that the new killer is of Jewish origin.\" On the 'loth, \"Al-Hihad Dialog,\" a daily\" column in Al-Jihad, published in the Jor- danian part of Jerusalem, reported: 'The man who killed Kennedy's assassin was a Jew. The question is, what were these vital secrets which the Jew who killed Kennedy's assassin was trying to cover up? * * * The role of this, Jewish killer in the dilemma of Kennedy's assassination moves people to ask whether world Jewry has any interest in this crime, and whether sub- ' Sami Hadawi, \"Who Benefits From Anti- Semitism\" (New York: Arab Information Center, 1961) pp. 1, 2. CPFRGH July 8, Y965 sequently, for fear of punishment, it got rid of the assassin lest he should disclose vital secrets? How many crimes has world Jewry already committed In history, to attain its ends and further its own interests?\" On the 27th, the same column in Al-Jihad probed deeper into Its suspicions of the pre- vious day: \"The Jews are used to living on the blood of others, and whatever the Jewish people have achieved was mainly arrived at by means of disorders which they themselves provoked to help attain their goal. The Com- munist revolution in Russia was organized by the Jews for their own ends. World War II against Hitler was a Jewish war. \"Rooted in the Jewish character since the dawn of their history, these qualities domi- nate them In America and Europe just as they did in days gone by. \"When will the Americans become wise to the secret crimes and conspiracies of the Jews-Heaven only knows.\" The following day, Beirut's newspaper Al- Hayyat published a letter from Na'if Shab- laq, a supporter of the Grand Mufti of Pales- tine, which added some new Jewish blood to the supposed conspiracy into which only \"Rubinstein\" seemed to have fit until then. Incredibly, the writer had uncovered \"an im- portant point, which the international news agencies-mostly under Zionist influence- apparently tried to cover up; namely, that the assassin, Lee Oswald, Is a Jew on both his father's and his mother's side, a Jew by be- lief and a Jew by religion, who was born a Jew and lived as a Jew.\" This revelation continued the vision of the \"hidden hand\" plot behind all major assassi- nations-one of the oldest canards of anti- Semitic pamphleteering and one which the Arab ideologies have recently resurrected for worldwide consumption. It was set forth in the Scribe (April 1964), a monthly magazine published in English, French, German, Ital- ian, and Spanish by the National Publica- tions House in Cairo: \"At the risk of being accused of anti- semitism (sic), we want, in the single pur- suit of truth, to prove that President Ken- nedy, just like the two American Presidents assassinated before him, was the victim of a Zionist-armed hand. It is no secret that John Wilkes Booth, murderer of President Abraham Lincoln, and Leon Czolgosz, who assassinated President McKinley, were both Jews in the service of the Zionist cause.\" To the names of the three Presidents, the Scribe added those of seven Senators-in- eluding Huey Long and William E. Borah- as victims of Jewish killers. The technique is to identify any American Jew as a part of what this Arab monthly referred to as \"the Zionist octopus at large,\" then to insist that the attack is against Zionism rather than Jews as such. And in this case the picture of Jewish terror In America's streets was sharpened with a quote from some even more practiced masters of tortuous propa- ganda. The editors of the Scribe reported to their readers in five language: \"The Moscow newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, organ of the Soviet Ministry of Defense, at- tributed, in its issue of December 14, the assassination of President Kennedy to Murder Inc., which succeeded the Mafia of sad memory, and which gave rise to all sorts of Israeli criminals, such as Al Capone (real name Isaac Schacher). \" On December 4, 1963, Sa'id Nu'mat Ulla, writing in Cairo's Government-regulated Acher Sa'a, summed up the approved assas- sination story,, brazenly twisting the best evidence and adding a final virulent carica- ture: \"The Zionist terror * * * and the Jewish gangs are the ones responsible for the crime of President Kennedy's assassination. \"Investigators in America have all come to the same conclusion: this outrage com- mitted in Dallas, which shook the conscience Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400170011-8 CPYFH- July 8, 1965 Approved F~raig/gl/1EBDP%RR000400170011-8 15341 of the world, was not the act of one s ngle man. * * * Jack Rubinstein, the Jew who killed Oswald, had no intention--as he claimed-of sparing Jacqueline Kennedy the anguish of testifying in court. \"All the evidence indicates that an inter- na$lonal gang is behind the assassination. Meanwhile, in Dallas jail, Rubinstein is busy writing his memoirs. He has announced that he hopes to fetch a very high price for them. \"Once a Jew-always a Jew, even in jail.\" THE ECUMENICAL COUNCIL The continuing study of Arab propaganda sources establishes that the renewed use of blatant anti-Jewish material, begun after the Kennedy assassination, was greatly in- creased at the time the Ecumenical Council of the Roman ' Catholic Church undertook consideration of its schema relating to the Jews-the clarifying statement on respon- sibility for trie crucifixion. The Arab nations seemed determined to halt the Vatican's efforts to bring about a better understanding between Christians and Jews-this, in an area far removed from any i;naginable dispute with Israel or Zionism, could only lead to grave questions concerning the motive for the Arab actions. \"Certainly the Arab Christians have raised their voices against the attempts to alter the Holy Scriptures,\" declared Arabische Kor- respondenz, a German-language newsletter ,published by the Arab League in Bonn, West Germany, in its issue of October 28, 1964. \"As inhabitants of the cradle of Christianity the Arabs are, in a better position to be able to judge the history of Christianity. That is why they permitted themselves to oppose the attempts of the council.\" ARAB'PRESSURR Suggesting thus that its judgments on matters of Christian doctrine were superior to those of the Vatican itself, the Arab League stepped up its anti-Jewish propaganda. To this its agents added open political pressure on Rome, designed to convince the Council of the Jews' \"total and perpetual guilt\" in Christ's death. The following issue of Arabische Korres- pondenz (Nov. 20, 1964) announced the League's political orders clearly: \"All Arab Ambassadors in foreign countries have received instructions to keep constant contact with the bishops and cardinals who participate in the council in Rome and to enlighten them about the political back- grounli behind the Jewish schema debated by the council. The Arab Ambassadors will also explain the Arabian point of view con- 'cerning this document to the Papal Secre- tariat and other authorities of the Vatican. This action of, the Arab nations is to be. in- terpreted as a good-will, action, in order to maintain good relations with the Vatican.\" The closing threat, though implied, was clear. Indeed, Catholic prelates now ex- pressed openly their concern for the well- being of priests and church in the Arab lands should the schema pass. President Achmed Sukarno of Indonesia made a trip to Rome to warn the Pope of possible diplomatic reper- cussions. On November 22, Jordan's Foreign Minister Kadri Toukan was quoted in a Bei- rut newspaper, the Daily Star, to the effect that passage of the proposed church declara- tion would be disastrous since, he said, \"his- tory testifies to Jewish intentions of destroy- ing Christ and Christianity.' Ill-disguised assaults of hate from official sources had patterned such analyses as the following-from the Arab Observer, \"the nonalined weekly,\" published in English by the United Arab Republic's General Organi- zatlon of Publications in Cairo (issue of Oct. 19, 1964) 1 \"What are the facts of the -strife betvyeen opposing .groups of prelates? * ? * Some mention would inevitably be made concern- ing the references in the New Testament to the part of the Jews in the murder of Jesus of Nazareth, and o their and ua guilt in this crime. \"The Zionising Cardinals * * * are the dupes of an incessant power struggle which uses the supposed sufferings of the Jews as one of its principal aids.\" In connection with these \"supposed suffer- ings,\" the Arab League's Bonn voice had sought somewhat startling ties of sympathy with its German readers (Arabische Korre- spondenz, Oct. 3, 1964) : \"The Council in Rome again occupies itself with Judiaism and Christianity * * *. The question arises whether it is prudent and right to correct history for the sake of Zion- ism * * '. Would it also not be right if one wants to forgive the Jews their 2,000- year-old guilt also to forgive the Germans their guilt?\" POPE PAUL'S PILGRIMAGE All restraint seemed to be dropped in the barrage of propaganda attending the historic visit of Pope Paul VI to the Holy Land prior to the council debates on the Crucifixion schema. \"They Will Not Deceive Him, for He Knows Them Well,\" proclaimed the headline in Cairo's highly-authoritative Akhbar el-Yom on December 14, 1963, over the following diatribe: \"The Jews have already exploited this purely religious pilgrimage to create the im- pression in world opinion that the new Pope harbors some opinion concerning charges that the Jews killed Christ. Christianity holds fast to its belief that the Jews killed Christ-because they ad- mitted their guilt and boasted of it, and be- cause the way they treat Christians and everybody else is like that of bloodthirsty murderers. \"And as for the claim these vagrants make-why do they trouble today to clear themselves of something they admitted per- petrating 2,000 years ago. Why are they so anxious to still their conscience over the blood of Christ, when so many fingers have pointed at them to claim the blood of Kennedy? \"We are convinced that this visit will not influence the Pope's belief as to the nature of the Jews, since he knows them quite enough. And once he will have met them, he will get to know them more than enough.\" On January 4, 1964, in covering the Pope's arrival at the Emir Abdullah Bridge, Radio Amman (Jordan) broadcast a com- mentary which declared in part: \"The events of history will fortify his lofty ,spirit more and more; His Holiness will con- sider how the Jews behaved at that time. \"Some 2,000 years ago the Jews crucified Jesus, after beatings, humilations and tor- tures that heap shame upon mankind every- where. And 15 years ago, in the most cruel manner, the Jews overran Palestine. They attacked its innocent, unarmed citizens and subjected many of them to the most villain- ous atrocities. \"Thus do the Jews prove their respon- sibility for the infamies of their forebears, and for the crucifixion and humilation of Christ 19 generations ago.\" HITLER, AVENGER OF CHRIST? Among the Ecumenical Council fathers there was deep feeling that distortions of the crucifixion story had spawned many of the slanders that had led to historic persecu- tions-slanders now heard again, ironically, at the very moment of these deliverations. The propagandists of the Arab world were attempting to turn that hatred which had made the schema necessary into a weapon against its success. Upon Christ's \"murder- ers\" should fall a heritage of blood and pun- ishment. And the killing of an American President had provided a fortunate parallel. Anis Mansur, writing in Cairo's Al-Musa- war on December 6, 1962, had turned the trick to the propagandists' satisfaction, set- ting a pattern for muc of e ensu ng cam- paign. Some significant excerpts: \"I am not a man of religion, but I feel bound to broach an old religious problem, for reasons that are new * * * whereupon the connection between this problem and Ken- nedy's assassination becomes quite straight- forward. * * \"What is 'new, however, is that there is a definite trend among Catholics to exon- erate the Jews completely from the blood of Jesus * * * The Jews have already suffered dozens of times since those days. They pleaded innocence of this dastardly crime hundreds of times. What Hitler did to them was simply revenge for what they did to Christ. * * * * Catholic Church, \"A congress of Catholic churchmen was held in Rome, which debated a document appealing to brotherhood. * * * A vote was taken on this particular passage, which showed 2,114 for and 40 against. It was thus decided that Catholics the world over should know that the Jews had not crucified Jesus. * * * \"It was strange that this congress was held in great haste, since one would have ex- pected it to take place in December, 1964. \"Its decisions-in other words-were due to have been published in the middle of this month, a week before President Kennedy was assassinated. \"Kennedy was a Catholic-and his assassin Jewish. The killer of Kennedy's assassin was Jewish too, and so is the man in charge of the investigation. \"While the Catholics are busy making peace with the Jews-the Jews are assas- sinating the foremost Catholic personality in the world. * * * * \"The capitalist regime in America tolerates the existence of Jewish gangs * * * and America pays the price * * * which this time was high. It is inevitable that anti- Jewish feeling-flickering at present-will turn into an open hatred as cruel as the bullet that struck Kennedy.\" On February 24, 1964, the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Mohammad Amin El Husseini, as chairman of the Arab Higher Committee for Palestine, wrote to Pope Paul VI decrying the principles of the Jewish religion-as in- terpreted, to be sure, in some of the oldest examples of anti-Semitic humbug? \"The Zionist movement,\" he wrote, \"is chauvinistic and reactionary. It is based on the Talmudic principles which consider non- Jews as goyim with no human rights.\" The same tactic-an apparent attack against Zionism as an excuse for vicious slanders against a people and their religious faith-is at work in the United Arab Repub- lic's government-sponsored pamphlet, \"Israel, the Enemy of Africa,\" distributed through- out the struggling continent to the south of Egypt since January 1965. An obvious at- tempt to promote fears among the people of new nations which have received extensive technical and educational assistance from Israel, the United Arab Republic's political pitch has been one of religious hatred-re- plete with quotes from the notorious proto- cols of Zion forgery. A few excerpts from the pamphlet: Page 8: \"Before we examine in detail the racial and religious discrimination practiced by Israel which also sucks the blood of the 9 The Mufti's letter was publicly printed in Beirut 4 days later.

The Talmud adds that it is for- bidden for a Jew to help a non-Jew get out of a hole. It decrees that the Jew must cover the hole with a atone and bury the non-Jew alive. \"Such are the teachings of the Talmud which are binding to the Jews. Therefore, it should not surprise anyone when the Jews ? * cheat end rob. Wheh Israel extends her hand to the Africans, she is extending a hand covered with blood.\" Page 19: \"The Talmud is full of agitation -against the Christians, and insulting words against the Virgin Mary whose virginity is doubted.\" Page 22: \"The Jew Is a materialist and a heathen.\" Page 24: \"It is laid down in the 14th pro- tocol of Zion which says: 'When rule is con- centrated in our hands, any religion other than Judaism would have to be destroyed.' \"Israel is using another manner of weapon in Africa that is spreading moral corruption among the African youth. \"In doing so it is applying protocol 13 of Zion which says: 'In order not to give the noh-Jew a chance to think. independently, we must encourage him to enjoy himself' * * * This. Is why the Israeli Government has opened brothels for the Africans and en- couraged them to keep company with Israeli girls, in the hope that they may forget their national mission.\" But the \"Jewish corruption\" theme had other ancient. versions, and the Arab govern- ment, propagandists could scarcely ignore them. On November 16, 1964, El-Kuat El-Muslaha, the official journal of the Egyptian armed forces, published a tired expose of Free- masonry, supposedly a licentious Jewish secret society designed to bring about the \"elimination of the Christian religion\" by luring young Christians \"into the arms of Jewesses\" and into moral ruin. Corruption was allegedly Introduced into Germany in the 1920's when one of the secret plotters introduced in the Reichstag a bill to legalize sexual perversion. \"Another member who could not restrain his feelings, went up to the rostrum and struck the Freemason a sharp blow which felled him to the ground. All the members in the House, applauded with the exception, of course, of the Jews * * *. If that Free- mason had survived until the Hitler period, Hitler would have broken every bone in his body.\" VICIOUS CARICATURES Such diatribes of hate are not isolated in- stances, nor have they gone without conse- quence in the life of Arab nations. In the New Yqrk Arab Information Center pamphlet mentioned at the outset, Sami Hadawi wrote that \"there are no discrimina- tory laws anywhere in 'Arab countries; Jews are legally recognized as citizens and exer- cise full and equal rights with Moslem and Christian Arabs:' Yet on December 8, 1963, the Jews of Iraq were ordered to report to the Department of Travel and Nationalities within 10 days, bringing with them proof of Iraqi nationality. Those recognized as citi- zens were to receive identity cards; the prop- erty of all others was to be impounded. The significant point is that the law (law No. 161 of 1963) was applicable to neither Moslems nor Christians-nor even to Israelis or Zionists as such-but sole)y to Iraqi Jews as Jews. If such laws were reminiscent of the Nazi regime, so too was the ' malignant propaganda which acccompanied them in'the daily press. The leading Jordanian daily, Al-Manar, of November 24, 1964, for example, published caricature of a..Jew wearing the the vicious Star of David on his chest and surrounded by bags of money. The caption over It read: \"The hungry one who is never satisfied.\" The Unified Arab Republic's armed forces weekly, El-Is uat El-Muslaha, in its article on freemasonary, drew an equally vicious caricature in words: \"The Jew in his very soul and character has not the qualities of a man who bears arms. Ile is not naturally prepared to sacri- fice his life for anything, not even for his son or his; wife. If there is today in Israel a man who bears arms he does this because he is sure that there is another man who will pre- cede him, who will stand in front of him not behind him in order to defend him when the time comes. Were it not for that, no ,Tew in the world would agree to bear arms.\" The expressed views of certain Arab leaders, like their propaganda techniques, seem to echo a recent European sound. An inter- view with President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic was published on May 1, 1964 on the front page of the Deutsche National Zeitung, an extreme rightist Ger- man weekly edited by Dr. Gerhar l Frey, who had visited Cairo that spring to bolster his international anti-Jewish alliances. In the Interview with Frey, Nasser said: \"During the Second World War our sym- pathi.es were with the Germans.\" LIE OF THE 6 MILLION Nasser added that recent policies of the West German Government, Including the payment of reparations to Israel, irked and confused him. When Dr, Frey explained that these payments, and other examples of West German accommodation with. Israel, were the result of what he called the Jew murders, of the recent past, the United Arab Republic's dictator replied: \"But the lie of the 6 million murdered Jews is not taken seriously by anybody.\" Certainly not by the authorized peddlers of hate. The Arabs, wrote Saleh Joda in the Cairo newspaper Al-Musawar on December 20, 1963, \"have always had faith in Germany's friendship, and in the fact that the great German people, which tasted disaster and de- struction at the hands of Jewish arms- dealers and bloodsuckers, can trust them no more.\" The writer added: \"There are still a few Jews left in Germany, who are trying once again to raise their viper's head and seize control of economic life, business, and politics.\" Events in other countries have been re- ported in the approved and sometimes gov- ernment-subsidized Arab press from a simi- lar viewpoint-particularly those events which lend themselves to an anti-Jewish slur. The notorious.Profumo affair in England, as described by Ibrahim Sakjaha in the Jor- danian Falastin, was headlined \"Jewish Scandals,\" and the writer concluded: \"In all this scandal and corruption, one fact stands out. Most of the leading racketeers and vicemongers were Jews * * *. Jews in England who ran these rackets amassed their fortunes by the foulest and most depraved of means.\" On August 8, 1963, a venomous analysis of history was offered by \"Wayfarer\" in the Jerusalem (Jordan) daily, Al-Jihad: \"Of all the dwellers on this planet, if any scholar were bent on counting; * * * the nations who hate the Jews * 'i * and those who are pro-Jewish * * * would he find so much as one single nation that like them? * * * I am sure that on this score everyone feels the same way. \"All of them hate to have Jews in their midst, and all do their best to get rid of them. Obviously this hatred is rooted in world feeling since the dawn of history. \"But why is it that everyone hates the Jews? \"The reason is one and the same * * * with everyone * * * in every age. \"It stems from the mentality of the Jews, and their character, which impels theme to live within a nation * * * as a people apart * * * with different aims * * * and feelings * ? * Because of this * ? ? and because of their spiritual insolationism * * * among whichever nations they dwell * * * they plunder its. wealth * * * and are not squeamish over the propriety of'thelr meth- ods. \"This is why the Jews are the root of all creeping corruption, and there is no doubt that this is also one of the main reasons why Jews are detested.\" But the persecutions of the past are not all that the Arab propagandists seek to justify. The threat of future anti-Jewish recriminations, even more terrible ones, are often only lightly hidden. In an article called \"The Sinister Grasp,\" in Falastin (Nov. 22, 1962), H. Ibrahim Sakjaha began with a report of Jewish crimes in the Soviet Union, then produced a torrent of analysis and grave prophecy: \"'The mouse is dead but its tail is wag- ging' runs the well-known Arabic proverb. And it springs to mind, when we read of an- other band of Jews in the U.S.S.R., sentenced for economic crimes. \"Not only Jews are tried on the charge in that particular country, admittedly. But most of the convicted criminals are Jews--- for one of two reasons. '\"The Jews try to get control of financial and economic life wherever they are. \"In this attempt they usually tend to em- ploy unscrupulous and illegal tactics. \"Obviously it is not just the Jews of Rus- sia who commit economic crimes, try to get the whip hand, and use underhanded tactics. In Russia, however, they are caught and tried, and some of them get the death sen- tence, in accordance with the severe laws there. Whereas in the United States, for instance, and other capitalist countries, they pursue their nefarious work unhindered, liv- ing a life of pleasure, and seizing all in their clutches, without their deeds being con- sidered a capital crime. On the contrary, some of them are even thanked or decorated for what they do. \"Take for instance the stock exchange crises in New York, London and elsewhere. Most people blame the Jews for profiteering on the stock markets to their own advantage, but all the same nobody takes them to task. In a city like New York nobody can settle accounts with them. \"Yet if the powers that be who yield to Zionist domination because their economies are in its clutches shut their eyes to crimes like these for the while, will the peoples who are lorded over by these Jewish exploiters be able to keep silent forever? \"We do not think so-nor do we doubt that they will square their accounts with the Jews, one day in the not too distant future. This accounting will be cruel and terrible; it will take reckoning of the sinister Jewish domination over the economy of the free world.\" THE EXPORT OF POISON Much of the blatant defamation of Jews produced by the authorized Arab propa- gandists-that which is paranoid or patently nonsensical--is obviously intended chiefly for internal consumption. For, only under a system of rigid press censorship which con- trols the public's level of awareness could the distortions in 'the Arab version of the Kennedy assassination, for example, be ped- died seriously. But the growing hate cam- paign has had international elements as well.

In Argentina, there are a number of anti- Semitic groups, many of them Nazi In flavor and beliefs. According to .a leading Argen- tine daily newspaper, El Siglo, an agent of. the Arab League named Hussein Triki has been working closely with some of these groups and financing their activities-par- ticularly a 'banned fascistic organization known as Tacuara. According to the Buenos Aires weekly, Pr'imera Plana, the police have known of Tacuara `expenses being covered by Triki. (Triki, a former representative of Algeria's FLN who was known for his openly pro-Nazi sympathies during World War It, publishes an anti-Jewish newspaper, Nacion Arabe, and has fostered widespread distribu- tion of the \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\")' ARAB BLASTS IN VNITED STATES In the Arab States, Arab propaganda is issued regularly from several special offices. A press release dated March 5, 1965, issued by the Palestine Arab Delegation in New York, was, quite in keeping with the official anti-Jewish propaganda abroad-charging that Zionists had started 'the Second World War in Europe in 1939 and had later \"capi- talized on the alleged destruction by Ger- many of 6 million Jews.\" The release added: \"It is appropriate to point out that ac- cording to statistics published by European governments, it is estimated that more than 45 million gentiles lost their lives in the Second World 'Par and yet no one hears about them, no one is capitalizing on their deaths, erecting monuments in their mem- ory, or cashing in through blackmail on their misfortune.\" Deliberately, or not, the authors had con- fused the hapless victims of war with those of programed murder. But such confu- sion fits the divisive purpose apparent In today's Arab propaganda throughout several continents. In \"Who Benefits From Anti-Semitism,\" the New York Arab Information Center's pamphlet, Author Hadawi quotes proudly from a book by Dov Joseph, who had been military governor of the Israel part of Jeru- salem, In order to bolster claims that such propaganda was merely anti-Israel, and purely political in nature. \"I have never found among Moslems * * *\" the author had written, \"any trace of feeling against Jews comparable to anti-Semitism.\" If this is so, then the flood of anti-Jewish hate sampled in these pages becomes all the more damning of its perpetrators-all the more tragic to the hopes for ultimate under- standing between peoples-for the responsi- bility then must fall almost entirely upon the officials of the Arab governments them- selves. One such official, King Hussein of Jordan, declared in a speech in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 1984: \"It is clearly in the best in- terest of the adherents of the Jewish faith wherever they live to make a deep, soul- searching, and, perhaps, an agonizing re- appraisal of their attitude toward this whole program of Zionism. For if they could only do that they would be able to make a far- reaching contribution toward solving a tragedy which threatens to engulf them and others in a senseless and ruthless calamity.\" The tbxekt--against \"adherents of the Jewish faith. wherever they live\"-was, ' like all threats of its kind, only thinly veiled. May 17, 1965: Bjorn Lundahl, leader of a group of Swedish Nazis, at whose headquar- ters police discovered a cache of weapons and a list of Swedish Jewish leaders marked for assassination, was charged with high treason. Lundahl had held at least 3b conferences with the former First Secretary of the Egyp- tian Embassy in Stockholm. April 24, 1965: Radio Cairo, commenting on the \"necessity of the destruction of Israel and the disappearance of Jewish people from the face of Arab soil,\" declared: \"We find our- selves facing human groups whose nature prevents them from coexistence with other peoples * * * These groups plan aggres- sion of, and domination over, other peoples.\" April 16, 1965: Mahmound Riad, Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, in an 'interview with the \"Deutsche National Zeitung and Soldatenzeitung,\" extreme rightist German weekly, said: \"Most nations are not interested in these (Nazi crime) trials and (wish) that these nuisances be stopped. This self-flagellation does not bring honor to Germany. Often, it seems to me as though the Germans were begging to be slapped. What is referred to in Ger- many as pressure of world public opinion is in reality the pressure of a tiny minority.\" April 15, 1965: Hilmi Salem, writing in Al Gemhouria, attacks President Bourguiba for being the first Arab ruler to have nominated a Jew, Andre Baruch, a relative of the famous millionaire, Bernard Baruch, as a member of his cabinet. March 6, 1965: The Palestine Arab Delega- tion In New York issued a press released en- titled \"Germany, the Arabs and the Inter- national Zionist Manipulators\" stating: \"No German leader with any self-respect whatso- ever would take such a position (arms de- liveries to Israel) knowing as he does about the sinister role played by the international Zionist manipulators to crush Germany in two World Wars.

Government-controlled radio stations, on which the regime depends for indoctrina- tion of an electorate that is 70 percent il- literate, are belittling President Johnson's action but simultaneously praising Premier Alexei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union for having taken similar action 3 days later. Recordings of the Arab broadcasts that be- came available in translation here today also contain quotations from Cairo's govern- ment-controlled. newspapers that show Nasser's press organs being as pro-Soviet and anti-American as his broadcasters in this matter. CPYRGH 153T15 STOCKS NEARLY DEPLETED They show, in addition, that Egypt was thin 3 weeks of exhausting its grain stocks when the State Department announced here n June 22 that President Johnson had de- ided the previous day to resume aid ship- , ents to Nasser's regime. The decision entailed arrangements to hip 260,600 tons, or $22,400,000 worth of heat plus $8,900,000 worth of tobacco, 5,600,000 worth of vegetable oils, and $100,- 00 worth of dried milk to Egypt in comple- ion of contracts made in October 1962, to upply that country with $431,800,000 worth f American farm products at bargain prices epayable in currency spendable only in gypt. Three days later Nasser got a note from osygin promising an additional 300,000 tons wheat for Egypt on terms that he left ubject to negotiation but vowed would be ept within the means of an Egyptian regime hat, according to Israeli publications, had ust tried to contract for annual shipments f 1 million tons of wheat from Argentina ver the next 5 years but could not meet rgentine credit requirements. DESPERATE NEED Egypt's desperate need of grain was also ointed up in Cairo broadcasts about osygin's offer. They stressed that it en- ailed immediate diversion to Egypt of Aus- ralian and Canadian wheat in Soviet ships hat had been bound for the Soviet Union. The first of those Soviet ships, northbound, eached the Suez Canal last Saturday. The econd, bearing another 11,500 tons of Aus- ralian wheat, reached Alexandria Tuesday, nd a third, carrying 9,500 tons, is due there unday. Nasser's radio stations, which had forecast 'resident Johnson's decision weeks in ad- ance, treating it as something Arab pres- ures were certain to extract from the White Ouse, began contrasting Moscow's action 7ith Washington's as soon as Kosygin's note as received. They have, moreover, used each Soviet ain ship's arrival as excuse for elaborating n their pro-Soviet and anti-American theme nd for blasting at \"pro-Zionist American ongressmen clamoring for stopping the ex- ort of wheat and foodstuffs to Egypt so that is sons may starve and succumb to Ameri- an policy.\" FAVORABLE TERMS \"We do not get wheat from the United tates as charity or aid, as its trumpets make ut,\" they add, \"but buy it at the full price hich, indeed, includes profit. There were avorable payment terms because the wheat, Lour, or other supplies were surplus in the United States.\" The contrastingly pro-Soviet note is struck n Cairo broadcasts saying Kosygin's promise as accompanied by \"a profound diplomatic emark; namely, that the Soviet Union fully ppreciates the policy of nonalinelpeYR espoused by Nasser. ll,~ \"The first (Soviet) consignment of w eat cached us,\" they add, \"while discussions were taking place (at Cairo) between Presi- ent Nasser and Chou En-lai, Premier of the hinese People's Republic which is contest- ng the Soviet Government on vital ideo- ogical subjects. \"Despite this, neither the Peiping Govern- ent nor the Moscow Government sees any trangeness in the supply of Soviet wheat to he United Arab Republic. GREAT LESSON SEEN \"This is because each behaves within the Balm of peaceful coexistence among lib- rated peoples. This is a great lesson for he U.S. Senators who have often pressed heir Government to break the wheat agree- at with us.

We have conclud deals to purchase wheat from Mexico. Theare other wheat deals being concluded These deals will meet our requirements 'unti we produce our own wheat in 2 years' time \"After 2 years It will be our right to tel those who helped us 'thank you, and thos who were hostile to us `what did you gain being hostile to us, other than failure?'\" Nasser's radios, which also have been blare lag the United States this week for all th United Nations' Shortcomings as a peace keeping organization and simultaneously de nouncing both Britain and the United State.- for their actions in the Vietnam crisis, hay just broadcast, in addition, some detail about Egypt's present grain stocks and futur prospects. These broadcasts are based on an an- nouncement made at Cairo last Sunday b Deputy' Premier Kamal Ramzi Istinu, wh said Egypt has managed to \"overcome th difficulty of meeting its requirements i wheat, corn, and flour\" for the next 1 months. It had entered last Saturday, he added into a contract with Mexican authorities fo 400,000 tons of wheat and 100,000 tons OF. corn to be supplied it on an 18-month credi basis. Egypt, which currently has to imporE 1, 500,000 tons of wheat a year, also has con tracted, he said, to buy 55,000 tons fro Australia plus 30,000 tons from the Unit States exclusive of the additional 260,00 tons due it under President Johnson's Jun 21 decision. Added to the 300,000 tons promised b Moscow, these figures reach an aggregate o 1,045,000 tons of wheat, or enough, he said to last 10 months in Egypt, which normall consumes 125,000 a month. OTHER FIGURES It has also contracted, he added, to bu 380,000 tons of flour from France, Italy, an Spain and this, added to its stock of 80,00 tons, will cover Egypt's flour needs for months. He did not project any imports of corn be yond the 100,000 tons from Mexico, saying instead, that Egypt's Ministry of Agricultur is Increasing acreage that will yield a con crop in September of 1 million feddan (1,470,000 acres). The United States has been shippin about about 2 million tons of wheat an nually to Egypt as part of economic ai allotments to that country which by Jun 30 last year had reached an aggregate o $943,100 and topped $1 billion at the end o Wednesday of fiscal 1965. - MILITARY AM ALSO But Soviet economic aid commitments totaling $1,011,300,000, according to Stat Department data, have been supplement by military aid commitments in excess o $1 billion. Some of the latter are, however not directly attributable to Moscow, bein shared by other Soviet bloc members suc as Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary Poland, and Rumania. According to State Department data Moscow's foreign aid commitments wer trippled during 1964 and a third of the tots, went to Egypt which got, in consequence $467,300,000 in credits from the Sovie Union. Communist Chinese credits Egypt amount, on the other hand, to onl $84,700,000 to date, including $80 millio granted last year. Mr. JAVITS subsequently said: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this brief statement may appear in con- nection with the statement made by the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD] on President Nasser's anti-Jewish propa- ganda. Mr. President, I believe that the Sen- ator from Connecticut has rendered the country a distinguished service in dis- closing the facts of what appeasement of President Nasser has come to mean to the United States. I have been trying to disclose these same facts constantly. The Senator from Connecticut has given enormous aid to efforts to show how misguided the United States has often been in Near East policy, especially with respect to the recent release of wheat to President Nasser's regime. I hope very much that every Senator will read the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut, as we shall be trying to implement by legislation these policy recommendations.
