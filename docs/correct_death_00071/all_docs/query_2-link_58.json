        "text": "British presence\n\nThe Suez Canal was an economically and strategically vital route for both Middle Eastern oil and trade with the Far East. Britain maintained a military presence in Egypt to protect the canal under the terms of a treaty signed in 1936.\n\nHowever, Egyptian nationalists resented the British presence in their country. As early as 1945, riots had broken out and the first British soldier was killed there.\n\nWithdrawing from the cities, British forces concentrated in the area immediately adjacent to the canal, known as ‘the Canal Zone’.\n\nThen, in October 1951, the Egyptian government increased pressure on the British and repealed the 1936 treaty.\n\nEscalation\n\nBetween 1950 and 1956, violence escalated: 54 servicemen were killed and many others injured. An operation to disarm the police in Ismailia in January 1952 resulted in the deaths of 40 Egyptian paramilitaries, and the death and wounding of several British soldiers.\n\nThe 2nd and 3rd Battalions of The Parachute Regiment had cordoned off the town, while the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers stormed the Bureau Sanitaire on 25 January.\n\nNegotiations\n\nBy 1954, the garrison in the Canal Zone numbered 70,000 troops. This was difficult to supply without the support of the Egyptian government.\n\nIn April 1954, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser became the leader of Egypt. He was one of a group of Egyptian Army officers who had overthrown King Farouk in 1952, and had a strong nationalistic vision.\n\nNegotiations began and an agreement was reached on 19 October 1954 ending the British occupation. Britain was given 20 months to withdraw.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nThis agreement led to a reduction in tension. British troops were able to leave the Canal Zone and move about more freely.\n\nThe first troops departed in May 1955. The last British unit to leave was 2nd Battalion The Grenadier Guards, which departed Port Said on 24 March 1956.\n\nRecognition\n\nIn June 2003, following a campaign by ex-servicemen and women and their relatives, the British prime minister Tony Blair announced the award of a Suez Canal Zone Clasp to the General Service Medal.\n\nThis was for anyone who had served in the Canal Zone for a minimum of 30 consecutive days between 1951 and 1954."
