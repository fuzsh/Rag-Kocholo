        "text": "This article is based upon a presentation at the Orlando IAJGS conference in July 2017— Ed.\n\nFormally speaking, for Jews who lived during the 18th–20th centuries in Eastern Europe (in the territories of present-day Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, and Russia), we cannot take for granted that all their ancestors necessarily dwelled in the region that in medieval rabbinical literature was called Ashkenaz and corresponded to territories in which the Christian majority was German-speaking. Yet, such simplification is often found in various texts written about Jews, including textbooks and encyclopedias.\n\nPartly as a reaction to this imprecise approach, and partly for other reasons having nothing to do with science, over the past few decades a number of authors have suggested a total revision of the mainstream point of view. They contest the existence of the genetic link between Eastern European Jews and those who lived in the Middle Ages in West Germany, suggesting that most Eastern European Jews descend from indigenous converts to Judaism, Turkic and/or Slavic.\n\nOnly an approach combining methods and data from various sciences allows us to address adequately the controversial question of the origin of Eastern European Jews. The most relevant sciences are historiography (operating with historical documents), demography (working with population figures), linguistics (analyzing various aspects of the language), onomastics (dealing with names of persons) and genetics (studying human genes). In this article, emphasis will be on information provided by historiography, linguistics, and onomastics.\n\nOrigin of Contemporary Ashkenazim\n\nWe can state that contemporary Ashkenazim descend from the merger of three principal groups of medieval Jews, namely:\n\n• Jews from the Rhineland whose vernacular language was based on German\n\n• Jews from the Czech lands who spoke Old Czech\n\n• Jews from the territory of modern Ukraine and Belarus who, in their everyday life, spoke an East Slavic language, the common ancestor of modern Ukrainian and Belarusian.\n\nNo information in our possession allows us to state that any of these three groups were formed by migrants from another group. In Jewish historiography, the fact of the existence of these three groups is consensual; medieval documents do not leave any doubt here. On the other hand, the opinions of various authors differ dramatically concerning the following aspects:\n\n• The exact origins of each of these groups (including the possibility that some of them were formed by migrants from another group)\n\n• The relative portion each contributed to the composition of modern Ashkenazic Jewry. Table 1 summarizes various approaches:\n\nGlobally speaking, one may distinguish two significantly different groups. The first (the first two lines in Table 1) usually is called the Rhine Hypothesis. It corresponds to the paradigm that currently dominates Jewish historiography. The most detailed description of this approach from the point of view of linguistics appears in the history of Yiddish written by Max Weinreich (1973). According to this approach, Jewish communities that existed during the last few centuries in Central and Eastern Europe were mainly the result of migrations of German Jews. As a result, within the framework of the Rhine Hypothesis, the general direction of migrations in non-Mediterranean Europe has been from West to East. Scholars who adhere to this approach usually acknowledge that a number of Slavic-speaking Jewish communities existed in Slavic territories before the arrival of Ashkenazic migrants from western Germany. Generally, however, they consider the demographic contribution of these pre-Ashkenazic communities insignificant in comparison to that of the Ashkenazic newcomers.\n\nThe second approach is totally different. It breaks the genetic link between modern Ashkenazic Jews from Slavic countries and those Jews who lived in medieval Germany. Paul Wexler is the main proponent of this approach among Yiddish linguists. In numerous published works beginning in 1991, he claims that most Eastern European Jews descend from “autochthonous” converts to Judaism, Slavic Sorbians, and Turkic Khazars. Theories by several non-linguists points to a similar direction. For example, Israeli historians Abraham Poliak (1943) and Shlomo Sand (2009), writer Arthur Koestler (1976) and certain other authors all emphasize the role of the Khazars. Jits van Straten (2011) asserts the existence of numerous conversions of East Slavs in relationship with intermarriages with Jews. He bases his conclusion mainly on demographical data. In this article, the approach of all these authors will be called “revolutionary” because it is radically opposed to the entire set of traditional points of view on this topic.\n\nAs can be seen from Table 1, the approach suggested here is different from other authors. Yet, its difference in comparison to the scenario described by the Rhine Hypothesis is not fundamental. It just provides additional details concerning Slavic territories making the general picture more nuanced and in this way may be considered as complementing the Rhine Hypothesis. On the other hand, the approach is totally incompatible with the ideas of the “revolutionary” authors.\n\nIn the following sections, the main arguments advanced by various authors to support their theories will be addressed critically. A much more detailed development of similar ideas is present in Beider 2015 (Appendix C) where one can also find all exact bibliographical references.\n\nRhine Hypothesis\n\nHistory. Historians who accept the Rhine Hypothesis often suggest arguments that reveal the existence of important cultural influences on Eastern European Jews that came from the West. The direct link between Rhenish religious traditions and those of modern Eastern European Jewry represents one such influence. Yet, this does not necessarily imply the mass migrations of people. Influential rabbis from Western Europe could have progressively incorporated various non-Mediterranean communities into the sphere of Rhenish Judaism.\n\nIn the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), the western origin of most of the rabbinical elite is obvious. It is true, for example, of such families as Auerbach, Braude, Epstein, Ettinger/Ettingen, Fränkel, Günzburg, Halpern, Heller, Horowitz, Jaffe/Joffe, Katzenellenbogen, Landau, Lipschitz, Luria, Margolies, Minz, Rappoport, Schor, and Spira/Schapiro. Clearly, rabbis were not a small closed caste whose representatives moved individually from place to place. They were accompanied by family members. Moreover, their migrations made it attractive for relatives and compatriots to move to the same areas. From the above cultural changes, however, we cannot deduce that the proportions of western migrants were significantly higher than those of “autochthonous” Jews.\n\nBefore the mid-14th century, the density of Jewish communities in western German-speaking territories was significantly higher than in Central or Eastern Europe. For all of Poland, references to Jews until the mid-14th century are concentrated along its western borders and clearly imply the western origins of local communities. During the entire 15th century and the first half of the 16th century, Jews were banned from numerous towns and entire provinces of Western and Central Europe. During the same period, however, the situation for Jews in Poland and Lithuania was significantly more favorable from political and economic viewpoints. It is precisely during the 15th century that we find rapid growth in the number of communities in this area. Numerous historians make a causal link between the deterioration of the situation for Jews in the West and the creation of new communities in the East. A priori, this opinion appears quite logical; it finds both a motivation for the emigration from various German-speaking provinces (including the urban centers in the Czech lands) and a phenomenon in the Polish-Lithuanian territories that looks like a direct consequence of these conjectured migrations. Moreover, we know for sure about cases of individual migrations in this direction.\n\nGlobally speaking, consideration of the historical factors does not provide a decisive argument in favor of any competing theory about the proportions of western migrants in the formation of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. However, these facts undoubtedly look more favorable for the opinions of scholars who emphasize the western contribution than to those who consider “autochthonous” Jews as numerically more important.\n\nLinguistics. Analysis of various elements of Yiddish provides a number of arguments in favor of the Rhine Hypothesis. One finds a series of words known in the Yiddish of Eastern Europe with Old French roots including, among others, leyenen (to read), tsholnt (Sabbath meal), pen (pen), milgrom (pomegranate), teytl (date [fruit]), and khremzl (Passover pancake). The verb bentshn (to bless) also is of western Romance origin. These words could only have been brought to Eastern Europe by Jews whose ancestors lived in the Rhineland and who, in turn, inherited them from ancestors who mainly lived in Northern France.\n\nNumerous phonetic peculiarities of the pronunciation of Yiddish words of Hebrew origin are shared by various dialects of modern Yiddish, those from Eastern Europe and those from Western Europe. They are surely due to oral (rather than textual) traditions. Some of them were already known in the Middle Ages in western Germany. For others, no sources are available that would shed light on their exact pronunciation in medieval Germany. Yet, the fact they also are found in modern times in western communities (e.g., Alsace and Switzerland) implies the likelihood that these peculiarities already were present in the Yiddish pronunciation of medieval, western, German-speaking communities.\n\nIndeed, even if a number of Yiddish-speaking migrants moved from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to Western Europe after the mid-17th century, numerous linguistic criteria show that the Yiddish dialect of these western communities is not an offspring of Yiddish from Eastern Europe. It is based on western German dialects and was inherited from Jews who lived in medieval western Germany. Among such numerous words with peculiar pronunciation that cannot be directly explained by the diacritics present in the corresponding Hebrew words are shames not shamesh (sexton in synagogue), tokhes not takhes (buttocks), shayle, not sheyle (question), peysekh, not pesekh (Passover), kheyder, not kheder (Jewish elementary school), kheyn, not khen (grace).\n\nNumerous lexical Hebrew neologisms present in modern Yiddish also were either already known in the language of Rhenish Jews during the Middle Ages or, at least, are found in western Yiddish dialects too. Examples are katoves (jest, joke), khalef (knife for ritual slaughtering), shlakh-mones (presents sent on Purim), khoge (Christian religious holiday), klezmer (musician), shlemiel (unlucky fellow), sheygets (Gentile boy), shikse (Gentile girl).\n\nAmong morphologic peculiarities, one finds the neuter gender for a number of Yiddish words of Hebrew origin, e.g., rakhmones (pity or mercy), goles (diaspora), mazl (luck), non-grammatical plural endings e.g.. yontoyvim (holidays), seyfer-toyres (scrolls of the Torah), ameratsim (ignoramuses), as well as the use of the suffix –te, of Aramaic origin, to create words designating women such as baleboste (female owner), mekhuteneste (female relative by marriage) and khonte (prostitute).\n\nA large number of Yiddish words of German origin have meanings unknown in dialects spoken by German Christians. These Jewish neologisms were usually brought from West to East. Examples are lerner (Talmudic scholar), shulklaper (one who knocks on doors calling people to synagogue), kloyz (house of worship or study), yortsayt (anniversary of death), gut(e) ort (Jewish cemetery [literally, ‘good place]), and yidishn (to circumcise). Many of these words are directly related to communal life and, therefore, could have been introduced by western itinerant rabbis. The hypothesis of massive migrations from the West is unnecessary to explain their propagation. A large set of words with German roots known in medieval Jewish communities of western Europe, with special meanings or some striking phonetic peculiarities, could appear in Yiddish of Eastern Europe through the study of the biblical translations, study that was mandatory for every boy in a kheyder (Jewish elementary school). The tradition of these translations originated in Western Europe.\n\nYiddish possesses a very large set of words with Hebrew roots and German suffixes. Documents available to us show that a number of them appeared initially in Western Europe. Some examples are shekhtn (to slaughter according to Jewish ritual), farmasern (to betray), rebetsn (rabbi’s wife) and numerous compound verbs with a Hebrew root followed by zayn, for example, mekhabed zayn (to honor).\n\nOnomastics. Given names are of particular importance for studying the history of Jewish settlement. Migrants coming to new locations invariably have proper names; therefore, it is reasonable to speak about migrations of names associated with these persons. A comparative analysis of names used in different communities can yield information of paramount importance about patterns of migrations and genetic relationships existing between communities. Indeed, if one can find a large set of names that clearly came from region R1 to region R2, we can be sure that we are dealing with an important migratory pattern. In this respect, information about names is significantly more important than knowledge about the vernacular language spoken by Jews in various regions. Here is one example: in the 11th–14th centuries, Jews from the Rhineland and northern France spoke completely different languages, yet they shared a number of given names. As a result, close genetic links between these two groups is beyond doubt.\n\nA number of Romance (mainly based on Old French) names initially used by medieval Rhenish Jews were brought to Eastern Europe, among them such Yiddish names as female Beyle, Bune, Reyne, Rike, Toltse, Yentl, as well as male Bendit, Bunem, Fayvush, and Shneyer. Also from western Germany came certain male names of initially Greek origin: Kalmen (from Kalonymos) and Todres (from Theodoros). Numerous Rhenish names of German origin also are found later in other German-speaking provinces, as well as in Slavic countries. For some of them, their semantics could be at least partly responsible for their propagation as fashionable names. Among examples are Liberman(beloved man), Zelikman(blessed man), Ziskind (sweet child), and numerous female names including Sheyne (beautiful), Feyge(little bird), Golde(golden), Eydl(noble), Freyde (joy), Blume (flower) and Reyzl (little rose).\n\nFor numerous other names, however, semantics would not have been a particular reason for their spread, which must, therefore, be explained as a direct consequence of migrations. Among examples, all with West German ancestors, are the male names Anshl, Ayzik, Ber, Eberl, Falk, Getsl, Gimpl, Helman, Henzl, Herts, Hirsh, Karpl, Kopl, Koyfman, Leyb, Lipman, Note, Volf, Zalmen, Zanvl, Zekl and Ziml, female names Brayne, Ele, Frumet, Gele, Ginendl, Hendl, Mine, Tile, and Zelde. Generally speaking, we can be confident that a large portion of these names were really inherited. The scenario of fashionable names can be a valid explanation in some particular cases only and certainly not on a large scale.\n\nJews from Czech Lands\n\nCareful analysis of data related to Jews who, in the Middle Ages, lived in Czech lands shows that their role in the development of Ashkenazic Jewry is usually underestimated. The earliest references to Jews in Czech lands date from the early 10th century. Over the next centuries, local communities became populous and the fame of their religious scholars extended beyond the region. Nothing similar may be said about Jewish communities in other Slavic countries.\n\nWe do not know about the origins of Jews who lived in the Czech lands, Bohemia and Moravia, during the Middle Ages. From the geographic point of view, one can think about Byzantium (via Balkans), northern Italy, and/or western Germany. It would be purely speculative, however, to establish a link to any of these regions; no information is available to corroborate it. The possibility of the community in Prague being an offspring of Rhenish Jewry is implausible because of differences in the pronunciation of Hebrew, given names, and religious rites that existed between these Jews and their coreligionists from western Germany. The genesis of Jewish communities in eastern Germany, Silesia, and western Poland, is less obscure. Onomastic information implies that it is directly related to Czech Jews.\n\nLinguistic and onomastic data leave no doubt about the important role Czech Jews played in the development of Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. For Eastern Yiddish, this role relates to several distinct layers. The first layer corresponds to the only perfectly identifiable substratum that exists in that idiom: a number of words with Old Czech roots. Among these are treybern (to remove forbidden parts from meat), beylik (white meat), preydek (front part of an animal or fowl), zodik (butchery hindquarters), khreyn (horseradish), tsvorekh (soft cheese), srovetke (whey), parev(e) (neither dairy, nor meat), meyre (the dough for baking matzot), zeyde (grandfather), bobe (grandmother), pleytse (shoulder), hoyl (bare, pure, hollow) and the interjection nebekh (poor thing!).\n\nAs may be seen from the list above, the importance of this group of words does not lie in a number of the items it encompasses, which is rather small, but in their semantics. Here we deal, among other things, with religious terms (including a large series of items related to food), words designating family members and parts of the body. Such words, basic for the vernacular language of Jewish communities, could not be borrowed by Yiddish from Slavic languages. They were necessarily inherited from the language of Czech-speaking Jews.\n\nGiven names of Old Czech origin are abundant in the body of traditional names used in modern times in Eastern and Central Europe. Female examples are Dobre/Dobruske, Drazne/Dreyzl, Khvoles, Krashe, Prive, Rode/Rude, Slave/ Slove/Sluve, Tsherne/Tsharne, Tsvetle, Zlate, and the malenames Beynesh and Khlavne. During the medieval period, a number of names of Hebrew or Aramaic origin were unknown in Western Europe while references to them are found in the Czech Lands. Among them we find the ancestors of the following Yiddish forms Abe ‘Abba’, Avner, Azriel, Betsalel, Paltiel, and the female names Hodes ‘Hadassah,’ Menukhe, Nekhame, and Noyme ‘Naomi’. These names most likely also were inherited from medieval Czech-speaking Jews.\n\nDuring the 14th to 16th centuries, all Jewish communities in Central Europe gradually became integrated into the Ashkenazic cultural sphere. Gradual abandonment of the Slavic vernacular language in favor of a German-based Yiddish was principally related to two factors. The first one is related to the presence of numerous German Christian colonists in Bohemia and Moravia. The second factor is related to the arrival of Jewish immigrants from West Germany. These settlers were not necessarily more numerous than the indigenous Jews, but their cultural importance and the fact that they spoke German dialects similar to those used by local German Christians meant their linguistic influence could be disproportional to their population size. The Bohemian colonial dialect of German to which Czech Jewry—representing a mixture of those Jews whose families lived there for centuries and relatively recent migrants from Germany—shifted during the 14th–15th centuries, eventually became the basic idiom for the genesis of all Eastern Yiddish dialects.\n\nEast Slavic Jews\n\nDocuments attest to Jewish presence in the territories of modern Ukraine and Belarus since the Middle Ages. Jews appear in sources from Kiev since the 10th century. In 1239–41, the Mongol invasion destroyed numerous towns in the area. From that time until the end of the 15th century, no reference to Jews is found in the area that corresponds to eastern Ukraine. Yet, Jewish presence in Vladimir (the capital city of the region of Volhynia, now in Ukraine) was uninterrupted from at least the end of the 12th century until the end of the 20th century. At the end of the 14th century, Slavic-speaking Jews also lived in Grodno and Brest (now both in western Belarus) and Lutsk (in Volhynia).\n\nNo consensus exists among historians about the origins of Jewish communities known during the 10th to 15th centuries. Usually historians assume that they had eastern and/or southern roots. Theories include the Khazar Kingdom, Crimea, Caucasus, Byzantium, Persia and Babylonia as possible sources. Until the end of the 10th century, Khazaria, whose western border passed in the immediate vicinity of Kyiv, clearly represents the most plausible source. According to a number of independent sources, the ruling elite of Khazaria embraced Judaism between the 8th and the 10th centuries. Although contacts between Russian principalities and the Khazar Kingdom before the 11th century are well known from Russian chronicles, no direct data is available to corroborate the presence of Jews from Khazaria in the territories of modern Ukraine.\n\nBefore the destruction of the Khazar Kingdom by the Russians during the 960s, however, this powerful state in which the rulers were Jewish clearly was attractive to Jews from other countries. The probability of the presence in Khazaria of Jews who was genetically independent of the Khazar converts to Judaism is particularly high since the archaeological data show that the conversion to Judaism could not have been massive. Traces of Jewish ritual on that territory are quite scarce. Moreover, several Arab authors from the 10th century write that Jews, though politically dominant, represent a minority of the country in comparison to Muslims, Christians, and pagans. One of these authors speaks about migrations to Khazaria of Jews from Muslim countries and Byzantium. For these reasons, it is logical to consider (though without certainty) that Jewish families in Khazaria during the 10th century were of heterogeneous origin. In any case, we find no given name of Turkic, Persian, or Greek origin in documents dealing with medieval Slavic-speaking Jews of Eastern Europe that could provide any clues about the languages spoken by their ancestors.\n\nIt is in the early 17th century that we can observe a large-scale homogenization of the body of Jewish names found in sources from the territories of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. Typically, Ashkenazic forms of biblical names dominate. Names with Germanic roots and/or suffixes are common. Many names known before, disappear and only a few (such as male Shakhne and female Badane, Yakhne, and Vikhne) survived in the corpus of Yiddish names. The onomastic homogenization is a direct consequence of the linguistic homogenization. There is no doubt that since the 17th century the Eastern dialect of Yiddish was already the first spoken language for a large majority of Jews living in the territories of modern Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. Numerous characteristics of this language imply its origin in the Czech lands. It has a small, but well identifiable, Old Czech lexical substratum, while its major linguistic features are mainly based on the colonial Bohemian dialect of German spoken in urban centers of Bohemia and Moravia. Migrants from these lands were responsible for the diffusion of this idiom to Poland and from it to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. An important number of other Yiddish peculiarities appeared already in the Polish territories, under the influence of the colonial Silesian dialect of German spoken in the Middle Ages in numerous Polish towns and also as a result of internal innovations. Almost all of them were eventually brought to Ukraine and a large part of them (mainly those dating from the period before the mid-16th century) appeared in Lithuania and Belorussia as well.\n\nRevolutionary Theories\n\nGenerally speaking, we have no evidence about the existence of Jewish mass migrations from West to East. Nevertheless, we definitely know about migrations of individuals (most likely, accompanied by members of their families) that continued until the Cossack wars of the mid-17th century in Eastern Europe. These scarce pieces of information are factual, while the “revolutionary” theories of Ashkenazic history are mainly speculative. We know about the conversion of representatives of the Khazar elite in the first millennium CE. Yet, we know nothing about any link between the Khazar converts and the Slavic-speaking communities that existed in the territories of modern Ukraine and Belarus during the 13th to 15th centuries. Moreover, we do not even know the sizes of the corresponding communities. Scant available information concerning censuses and taxes provides only a rough idea about the small number of Jews living in the area in question. For a period during which migrations could take place, such data are certainly more objective than the method used by van Straten of backward calculation using unreliable annual growth rates resulting from extrapolations made by that author on the basis of unknown growth rates. As for the putative mass conversions to Judaism of Sorbians or East Slavic people, they are the fruit of the theoretical imagination of Wexler and van Straten, respectively. Not a single piece of historical information alludes to such events.\n\nNo author writing about the composition of Jewish communities in Slavic countries can ignore the fact that in recent centuries Yiddish, a language with an obvious High German basis, was the first everyday language for all local communities. Often, the approach to this topic is directly related to the general conception an author has about the history of the formation of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. For scholars who adhere to a traditional point of view about the history of the formation of these communities, the propagation of Yiddish is totally natural. For them, the Jewish settlement in Eastern Europe is mainly due to western migrants who brought this language from Central and/or Western Europe. For “revolutionary” authors who favor the non-western origin of Jews in Eastern Europe, the status of Yiddish represents a serious issue they need to address. Generally, they advance two main arguments.\n\nFirst, some write about a large linguistic impact of the German colonists in medieval Polish towns. This argument is invalid. The Silesian dialect spoken by colonists indeed was an important influence on Yiddish. Moreover, the presence of a large number of German-speaking Christian colonists and their dominant role in the economic life of numerous urban centers of western and southern Poland could be important factors that contributed to the survival of Yiddish during the first centuries of its presence in Poland. However, the basis of Eastern Yiddish is not Silesian; this is particularly clear from a consideration of vowels. The language of German colonists could be the reason for neither the initial development of Yiddish in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, nor for the propagation of this language, especially in Ukraine, Belorussia, and Lithuania where German presence was minimal and where most communities of Jewish speakers of East Slavic, in theory, could be located.\n\nThe second argument deals with sociolinguistics. The dispersion of a language represents a fact that is partially cultural. If an entire community speaks the same language, it does not mean that all or even a majority of its population is of homogenous origin. In theory, at certain periods, the language of the more cultured minority could become that spoken by the majority. An explanation of the diffusion of Yiddish as a natural result of western migrations would be sufficient if direct information about the massive character of these migrations was available. Yet, that is not the case and, moreover, we have serious arguments showing that, on the one hand, the Jewish presence in the territories of modern Ukraine could be uninterrupted since at least the 10th century. On the other hand, even during the 16th to 17th centuries, certain Jews living in western Ukraine and western Belarus were still using East Slavic languages as their vernacular idioms. In this context, the mere fact of the propagation of Yiddish does not allow one to make automatic conclusions about the prevalence of western migrants in comparison to “autochthonous” Jews.\n\nAll “revolutionary” authors invoke the possibility of sociolinguistic factors playing dramatic roles in the propagation of Eastern Yiddish. Poliak (1943) insists that the Yiddish language spoken in Jewish elementary schools and houses of rich men influenced that of all other members of communities, who, according to his general idea, were of Khazar origin. Koestler (1976) also emphasizes that Yiddish is due to a very small but more cultured group of Jews from Bohemia and Germany. Sand (2009) assigns the propagation of Yiddish (the language that started, according to him, among descendants of Khazar converts under the impact of German settlers in Poland), to a late migration of erudite German rabbis whose influence was disproportional to the small number of these migrants. Van Straten (2011) also considers that a limited number of western rabbis and teachers played a fundamental role in the propagation of Yiddish in Eastern Europe.\n\nEven if the sociolinguistic factors described in the previous paragraph could indeed have had some importance for the development of Yiddish in Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as a whole the scenario in question (purely theoretical and speculative since no evidence exists to corroborate it) seems impossible. It goes against common sense.\n\nCertainly, in world history, we know about some cases in which the language of a more cultural minority gradually became the everyday idiom of the majority who copied the linguistic behavior of its elite. This, for example, was the case in the territory of modern France where Latin, initially a vehicular language brought by Romans, became the first language for the entire population that abandoned its Celtic (Gaulish) idiom. The case of Yiddish, however, is fundamentally different. Latin “won” against Gaulish in a context in which the competition was between these two idioms and two population groups only. An exact analogy would be an imaginary scenario according to which Yiddish-speaking Jewish migrants come to an island inhabited by Slavic-speaking Jews only and the latter gradually shift to Yiddish. Yet, Slavic-speaking Jews did not live on an island and were not confined to any type of ghetto. They constituted a minority among Slavic Gentiles and were by no means isolated from their Gentile neighbors. As a result, in the real situation, Yiddish competed against the everyday language of Slavic Jews in a context of close contact with a Gentile majority speaking a language structurally identical to that of Slavic Jews. Moreover, nothing indicates the existence of mass migrations of Jews from the West. It is clear that under such circumstances, the chances for the victory of Yiddish were relatively small. It is not a surprise that the process of total Yiddishizing took several centuries in the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine. Traces of monolingual Slavic-speaking Jews are visible as late as the 17th century.\n\nTo explain the fact that Yiddish finally became the dominant Jewish vernacular language in the total Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the sociolinguistic factors exposed above are totally insufficient. The dominant role of Yiddish is a cogent argument about the importance of the demographic contribution of western Yiddish-speaking migrants (from Central Europe to Poland and from Poland to Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania), with a regular influx over a long period of time into relatively small Slavic Jewish communities.\n\nSeveral additional arguments complement the above analysis. The emphasis made by “revolutionary” authors on the decisive role of the western elite is untenable from the point of view of common sense also because it is unclear how this presumably small layer of western migrants could include the many rabbis, teachers, and rich men necessary for the propagation of Yiddish over such a large area. It is logical to consider that, on the average, western migrants could be better educated from the religious point of view than Slavic Jews. Yet, there is no reason to consider that only the elite took part in the migrations to the East. Obviously, it also would be absurd to conjecture that Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe held only highly educated persons. In addition, in the case of the putative autochthonous (formerly Slavic) majority in Eastern Europe, one could expect a substantial Eastern Slavic substratum in Yiddish dialects of Ukraine and Belarus. Such a substratum, however, is invisible.\n\nThe consideration by “revolutionary” authors of Yiddish as the prestige idiom contradicts what we learn from the history of Yiddish literature. Hebrew, the language of culture, was the only idiom whose social status among Jews was indeed high. Nothing similar can be said about Yiddish. It was a typical vernacular language. In Jewish elementary schools, the Bible was studied in Yiddish translations certainly not because of the putative prestige of Yiddish but simply because it was the language understood by all the students. In prefaces to numerous Yiddish books published in Poland during the 16thand 17th centuries, authors explicitly state that the text is written in that language so that simple folk and/or women and girls might understand. These books were printed using a special typeface, vaybertaytsh, literally “women’s Yiddish” and not in square Hebrew letters, to distinguish them from the sanctified texts in Hebrew or Aramaic. Until the 19th century, rabbinic tradition considers that Yiddish can have only an auxiliary function and is not for serious publications. Note also that girls did not study in Jewish elementary schools and, consequently, could not acquire their knowledge at school. Yet, there is no evidence that women were less fluent in Yiddish than men.\n\nThe Yiddish literature of Eastern Europe known to us dates from the 16th century only and comes from Poland. No Yiddish publication from the territories of modern Ukraine, Belarus or Lithuania is known even for the 17th century. As a result, the available literature does not provide any direct information about a presumed period of “struggle” between Yiddish and East Slavic languages in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Moreover there is no reason to think that the general attitude toward Yiddish could change so dramatically in time and/or space. A language with high social status in Lithuania would not be considered an idiom suitable for writings for a female audience in contemporary Poland and later in Lithuania too.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor any of “revolutionary” theories to reflect historical reality, one must develop a large series of bold independent hypotheses to explain all the historical, linguistic, onomastic and demographic information in our possession. If they were valid, such assertions really would be revolutionary for the corresponding domains. This general conclusion represents itself as a very important argument against the theories in question. It shows that for the “revolutionary” authors, the scholars who worked in the domains in question before them were totally wrong. In other words, these authors consider (mainly implicitly) that their predecessors either have been bad specialists in their respective domains or, were at least, ideologically biased.\n\nIn many cases, the real situation is just the opposite. The ideological bias of Sand, Wexler, and Koestler is self-evident. For the first two authors, their idea about converts being the basis of the Jewish people is not limited just to Jews from Eastern Europe. For them, this is just a particular case of the general task that inspires their studies—showing that all modern Jews (or, at least, the largest branches, Ashkenazic and Sephardic) descend from converts. Moreover, Sand does not hide the fact that his study is a pamphlet aimed against Israeli politics and the notion of Jewish people as a whole. In his book, Koestler (1976) declares many times his intention to prove with his study the invalidity of the Nazi racial doctrine. An ideological orientation is less visible in the book by van Straten (2011). Yet, when reading it, one has the impression that the author is a proponent of a kind of conspiracy theory. He accuses almost all major Jewish historians and almost all biologists who worked in the domain of Jewish genetics of asserting incorrect statements. His denigration of views of various authors (often considered classical by their peers) is so general that he does not hesitate to “refute” some of their basic ideas dealing with topics totally marginal to the main questions addressed in his book. Numerous passages from Sand (2009) also can be interpreted as inspired by conspiracy theories. He regularly accuses the Israeli academic establishment of hiding the truth about the conversions. Yet, almost all his information on this topic represents direct quotes from books and articles published in Israel or theses held in Israeli universities. Another general feature characteristic of “revolutionary” authors is their amateurism in the domains they address. Wexler is an exception, but his approach violates all general principles elaborated by historical linguistics, and it is not a surprise that his writings are not endorsed by his peers. Superficial opinions are particularly common in onomastics or linguistics. Often, when asserting something about Jewish history, they ignore or disclaim the opinions of the most important historians and base their conclusions on the views of authors marginal to the field.\n\nDue to the scarcity of written documents dealing with the early period of the existence of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, historical and linguistic analysis never will be able to yield the proportions of population contributions of various sources of Ashkenazic Jews. In this context, any attempt to reduce the problem to a simple set of conclusions should not be accepted. Only a broader vision, without any reductionism, really allows our knowledge of history to progress.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBeider, Alexander. 2015. Origins of Yiddish Dialects.

Starting from a classical reconstruction of a family tree in the particular town of Krasnobrod, we have succeeded in tracking the entire family of Shlomo Tzvi Elbaum, in linking him to Yakov Kopel Likover, and in deducing the latter’s previously unknown descendants. We have examined family tombstones and the subscription list of an important scholarly work, thereby learning more about the family. The peculiar geo-political history, particularly of the Zamość District, of the main towns of residence in relationship to Austrian naming laws allowed us to determine the etymological origin of the surname, Elbaum. The unusual naming of grandchildren of the progenitor of the family during his lifetime, along with peculiar aspects of hagiography, i.e. idealized biographies, allowed us to determine the possible Italian provenance of the family.\n\nKeywords\n\nRabbinic genealogy, Kopel Likover, origin of surnames, tombstone inscriptions, prenumeranten lists, family reconstruction\n\n*Presented in part at the 38th IAJGS, Warsaw, Aug. 2018\n\nA. Introduction\n\nThe origin and development of Jewish surnames in Poland has been the subject of several modern treatises[1]. The studies are based on religious, historical, philological and etymological principles. By and large the forced adoption of surnames took effect only over a 20-year period, regardless of regulations, during which time there was a transition from the age-old system of patronyms to one of invented surnames. As Jews became used to the new order, identities sometimes vacillated between two or more invented surnames until the names became invariant by about 1830. Not so ELBAUM[2], which seems to have appeared sometime around 1788 and remained fixed thereafter. Furthermore, as we found out from the present study, no unrelated family seems to have adopted that surname. Aside from its uniqueness, ELBAUM is also a prime example of a Jewish family whose members lived almost entirely in the Lublin Guberniya, specifically in the Zamość and Tamoszow districts of Galicia in 1788. Its near geographic isolation allows us the opportunity to study the history of the family without having to stretch our resources too widely. The progenitor of the family, known to historians, was Yakov Koppel Lukover (ca 1695-1769). He had a reputation as a scholar and kabbalist; and he was also famous for his kindness to his guests and to all travelers stopping at his tavern in the Polish village of Lukowa near Tarnograd.[3] Lukover was, therefore, a toponym.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to not only flesh out the genealogical history of the ELBAUM family but also to trace the origin of the surname. The surname appears to have remained stubbornly unchanged for the most part, even as those of other contemporary families evolved or changed dramatically during the 19th century. Its establishment is partly a quirk of history and geography, subject to religious custom. We are fortunate that the progenitor of the family, Yakov Kopel Lukover, is a well-known religious figure with even more well-known descendants who were religious leaders and who left behind oral and written records. This helps us to track the family history throughout the ages. Hagiography in these writings luckily provides us with clues to the family history prior to its arrival in Poland without those authors necessarily knowing such details. The only other source of information which we have encountered regarding the origin of the family dates back to 1935 with the establishment of the Oelbaum Family Society[4] which has a tradition of descent from Kopel Lukover. We believe that ours, however, is the first comprehensive and systematic study.\n\nB. Procedure\n\na) Record extraction\n\nSince the original aim of the project was restricted to reconstructing the family history of one particular Elbaum family living in Krasnobrod (Lublin guberniya), we started with the extraction of genealogical data available in the Polish State Archives for that town starting from 1826 when birth, marriage and death records were kept in separate books for Jews[5]. A single monolithic family was revealed. This exercise was extended to the vital records kept in the mixed Catholic / non-Catholic parish records covering the years 1810 to 1825[6]. This is sometimes referred to as the patronymic era because, at least for Jews, surnames were most often absent and, instead, Jews were denoted as X son/daughter of Y. We were surprised, however, to see the Elbaum surname being in use as early as 1810. The data had been extracted from the records which had been originally microfilmed in the past[7] or from images available on the Polish State Archives website[8], many of which are also available at the JRI website[9]. The family reconstruction indicated that all Elbaums living in Krasnobrod were related. The reconstruction was subsequently augmented by studying the records from neighboring towns. Printed family histories placed this Krasnobrod clan into a larger framework.\n\nAn important headstone, still extant in the Jewish cemetery of Jozefow Ordinacki, helped us enormously with the reconstruction, as it spread further afield in Lublin province.\n\nb) Geographic provenance of the Elbaum surname\n\nOne of JRI’s tools is a time-and-space mapper[10] indicating the density of the use of any given surname during any particular decade after 1810. (Get permission from JRI to reproduce the maps). The application to the surname, Elbaum, indicates that its use showed up in Zamość county and in very distant Kutno. (See Figure 1, below). We shall argue that the Kutno branch transported its name when it migrated from the Zamość area to Kutno after about 1788. In each case, the family spread outward concentrically from these locations as the generations progressed. No registry data was available prior to 1808, leaving us with the uncertainty of whether or not there were two unrelated Elbaum clans originating simultaneously in two different regions. Therefore, the next step was to examine the history of these two locations. An important Prenumeranten (subscription) list helped us to answer this question.\n\n1811-1820\n\n1831-1840\n\n1851-1860\n\nFig. 1. Time- and space-distribution of ELBAUM family events during early period of record-keeping in Poland.\n\nReproduced with the kind permission from JRI-Poland.\n\nc) Austrian surname laws\n\nZamość county was, at one point in this critical time period, located within the Austrian Empire. Therefore, we examined the legal use of surnames within the region, subject to the historical framework of rapidly changing borders.\n\nd) Origin of the Elbaum family itself\n\nWe then examined family lore recorded by the Rabbinic branches themselves in order to understand the broader picture including the geographical origin of the Elbaum family prior to its arrival in Poland.\n\nC. Results and Discussion\n\nAt first, the analysis of the civil registry records led us to most of the children of Josef ELBAUM (1768-1818) of Krasnobrod. The patronymic era records revealed that the parents of Josef were Szlama and Gryna[11]. With such an unusual combination of given names, it was not difficult to expand the scope to nearby towns, thus revealing several additional Elbaums whose parents were Szlama and Gryna. A chart resulting from this earliest analysis is shown in Figure 2, below.\n\nFig. 2. Children of Shlomo Tzvi Elbaum\n\nMoszek, a teacher, was identified by virtue of his (second) marriage in 1828 in Zamość to Fayga BRAM[12]. His father, Szlama, was identified as the erstwhile beadle in the synagogue of Kransobrod. Abram, two of whose sons lived in Lublin, was identified by virtue of grandchildren with the telltale names, Szlama and Gryna, as well as from his 1832 death record in Jozefow Ordynacki[13], henceforth refered to simply as Jozefow. Because Szlama was born ca 1800, this provides an upper limit to the death year of Shlomo Tzvi. Another son, Kopel, was identified by virtue of his death record in 1848 in Jozefow[14]. The last son, Majer ELENBAUM, living in Zelechow, was the son of Szlama Jankelewicz[15]. Jankel is, of course, the Yiddish endearment for Yakov [Kopel]. We also considered whether a certain Michla, nee ELBAUM, who died in 1825 in Jozefow[16], could be a daughter of Szlama, given that she named grandchildren Szlama and Gryna; but ultimately we rejected this possibility (see below for a deeper analysis).\n\nAt this point, we realized that, even though Gryna had never before been identified prior to our study, nor any of her children, nevertheless Shlomo [Tzvi] Elbaum was known in the literature as a son of Yakov Kopel Lukover. Meir Wunder’s study[17] of Shimon Maryles, the Chassidic Rebbe of Jaroslaw, devotes a chapter to Yakov Kopel Lukover and his then known children. An outline of Yakov Kopel’s family tree, based on Wunder’s work (2010) and showing two sons – Shlomo Tzvi (who lived in Krasnobrod, unbeknownst to historians) and Israel Leibs (who lived in Jozefow) – is given in Figure 3, below.\n\nFig. 3. The first three generations after Yakov Kopel Lukover, as per ref. 16.\n\nThe boxes shaded in blue are for three early Chassidic leaders\n\nWe see that both sons of Yakov Kopel carried the surname Elbaum (written in one of its variant forms). Only one of Israel’s own sons, Shimon (and his descendants), deviated from this practice because of the desire to commemorate the latter’s father by using the acronym, MARYL’S, i.e. Mi-Avinu-R’Yisroel Leibs.\n\nWunder recounts the family tradition that Yakov Kopel was a learned Kabbalist but lived in the tiny agricultural village of Lukowa close to Tarnograd. Although a scholar, he did not have a Rabbinic position, but rather operated a wayside inn where he generously offered hospitality to Jewish travellers. His fame as a scholar spread to the point where he was offered the position of Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam – which he rejected. Although he was an opponent of Chassidism, Yakov was approached by the Ba’al Shem Tov (d. 1772) the founder of the Chassidic movement, who asked him to intercede with Yakov’s friend, the Pope in Rome, in a quest to act favourably towards the Jews of Poland.[18]\n\nYakov Kopel died in 1769 and was buried in nearby Tarnograd. Although his headstone is no longer extant, the inscription was recorded prior to World War 2[19]. Ours, the first English translation, is given below:\n\n“And Jacob went out from Be’er Sheva,\n\nHe would provide for every wayfarer,\n\nand now he has gone on his way in holiness. He was a saint.\n\nIn the year [5]529 [i.e. 1769] on Wednesday on the minor Shushan Purim,\n\nthe luminaries were removed, and the Holy Ark was captured.\n\nAnd the scholar, superb in Torah learning and in acts of kindness,\n\nwas summoned to heaven. Famed in praise, our teacher, Yakov Kopel,\n\nson of the recently deceased Kalonymus”.\n\nIt is not surprising that the surviving children, immersed in Torah scholarship, too, compared Yakov Kopel to the Biblical forefather and namesake, Jacob, who also left the family well of Torah nourishment, towards his encounter with destiny.\n\nWe shall not repeat details of the family history described in Wunder’s study, which essentially concentrated on the life and works of Shimon and his descendants. We wish to underline only two key points relevant to our study of Shimon’s siblings and of the father Jakob: 1) Yisroel Leibs family migrated deeper into Galicia, while his siblings remained in Poland proper; and 2) The headstone, shown below in Fig. 4, is miraculously still extant in the Jewish cemetery of Jozefow; and it has been transcribed by Trczinski[20]. Wunder[21], too, reproduced the inscription in Hebrew of the headstone of Yisroel Leibs as first published in Dvar Chein (p. 178). It reads:\n\nFig. 4. The headstone of Yisroel Leibs [ELBAUM], in front of one of the present authors (DE) in Jozefow\n\nInscriptions for illustrious scholars are usually very poetic with Biblical references; and this headstone is no exception. This one is a partial quote from the Biblical episode of the gathering of the 12 sons of the patriarch, Jacob (i.e. Israel), around his deathbed to listen to the final words of the father. Ours, the first English translation is very instructive:\n\nGather around your father Israel\n\nAnd cry over him with embittered souls\n\nAnd let your tears roll down ceaselessly [for]\n\nHim who led you in the [path of the] fear of God all his life\n\nThe honest learned scholar who walked in the footsteps of his forefathers\n\n….. our teacher and Rabbi, Israel,\n\nson of the famous Kabbalist,\n\nreferred to as a holy man of God,\n\nour Rabbi and teacher Yakov Kopel LUKOVER.\n\nMay the memory of this Tzaddik be a blessing for ever.\n\nHe passed away on the second day of Pesach [5]572 [1812]\n\nMay his soul be bound up in the bonds of everlasting life.\n\nFrom this, we note, the deceased’s real name was merely Israel / Yisroel; and so the descriptive additive, Leibs, must refer to the name of his father-in-law, a common grammatical construct for such cases when ambiguity might otherwise arise from multiple marriages. Furthermore, in order to complete the parallel Biblical allusion we naturally conclude that Yisroel Leibs must have also had 12 sons (and an unknown number of daughters), whereas at the outset of this study we knew of only four. This directs us to further research on that part of Yisroel’s family which might have remained in Poland proper. By studying all available Polish civil registration data that do not connect to Shlomo Tzvi and his brothers, we believe, we have uncovered 11 of the twelve sons of Yisroel and at least two daughters and their families, thereby fleshing out most of the history of the descendants of Yakov Kopel Likover who, by the end of the 19th century, spread out over most of Poland and Galicia and even into Hungary and Moldavia. Four were already known and were described by Wunder.\n\nThe remainder, discovered by us and shown in Figure 5, were discovered raising families in various Polish towns. According to Wunder (ref. 16), Yisroel was married to a Hinda, daughter of Leyb[22]. However, we have found records where his (second) wife was Ruchl; and this is consistent with giving birth to children as late as 1785. Many of these children were living in Jozefow or nearby. In approximate chronological order we have found:\n\n1. Szmul ELBAUM (born ca 1755) was married to Ruchl. He was identified by the death of his son, Majer (1775-1850), recorded in Tarnow and Zwolen[23]. Since a religious Jew would not marry a woman with the same name as his mother, we tend to believe that Szmul was the son of Yisroel Leibs’ first wife, Hinda. However, the issue is complicated by the existence of at least three contemporary men named Szmul / Samuel ELBAUM, one of whom was a likely an early son of Yakov Kopel himself. For now, we attach the Szmul in question to Yisroel Leibs. See further, below.\n\n2. Leyzor ALBAUM (b ca 1760) and his wife, Sura, were the parents of Zelman ALBAUM (1784-1839)[24], Rabbi of Kazanow. We have connected Leyzor to Yisroel Leibs by virtue of a grandson, named Izrael in 1\n\n3. Fayga ELBAUM, born ca 1760, was married to Chaim WOLBEDACHT. Their son, Szmul, married Zora / Sora, the daughter of Berek ELBAUM, born ca 1775, and Frayda FYNKEL[25], in 1818 in Jozefow. Fayga and the WOLBEDACHTs were from Jozefow, which was Yisroel Leibs’ homestead. Since a granddaughter was named Ruchl, we suspect that Fayga was the daughter of Yisroel Leibs second wife. Berek’s provenance is a bit murky. His children were being married in Jozefow, Sokolow Podlaski and Szczebrze\n\n4. Boruch EJLBOJM (born ca 1765) appeared in the 1850 census of Krements as the father of Szymon of Radziwill, in the region of Galicia[26] where Yisroel Leibs’ known children lived\n\n5. Oszer Anczel (born ca 1765) a tailor from Jozefow, and married to Malka Chana Herszkowicz, had two sons – Leyzor ELBUM and Majer ALBUM – living in Kosow Lacki[27].\n\nAnother son, Eliye OELBAUM, was married off in Szczebrzeszyn. Their marriage and death records mention Oszer as their father. Again, the association with Jozefow or nearby, links Oszer to Yisroel Leibs.\n\n6. Another possible son, is Salomon ÖHLBAUM from Jozefow and born ca 1775. His daughter,\n\nFeige SCHLEFRIG, died in 1886[28], in the nearby Galician town of Jaroslaw. Salomon’s son,\n\nBerek, born in 1800, married a second time to Katzl / Katja IZAAK (45 years his junior) of\n\nBargszas in Hungary. Berek must have been from a very prestigious family for such a match.\n\n7. Etl ELBAUM (1777-1853) was married to Nuchym SZECHTER of Jozefow. Etl’s death record[ explicitly states that her parents were Izrael and Ruchl.\n\n[1]\n\n8. Icyk Eyzyk ELBAUM (ca 1785 – > 1832) of Zelechow and his wife, Ester, married off a son, Izrael, in Konskie in 1832[30]. Since Izrael was born in 1813 – one year after the death of Yisroel Leibs – it seems clear that Icyk Eyzyk was a late-born son of Yisroel Leibs. record[29] explicitly states that her parents were Izrael and Ruchl.\n\n9. Berek ELBAUM, born ca 1775, was likely a brother of Fayga (#3 above). Their children who married each other were thus likely first cousins to each other. If more distantly related than that, they could not be children of Yisroel Leibs, but rather of Yakov Kopel himself. This is not possible since Yakov Kopel had already died by 1769. When Berek married off his daughter, Zora, in 1818, he was a resident of Jozefow[31]. But when Zora remarried in 1822 (in\n\nSzczebrzeszyn), Berek was described as already a resident of Jerusalem!![32]\n\nFig. 5. Likely children of Yisroel Leibs ELBAUM. Names in colored boxes were deduced in the present study.\n\nWe now address the question of origins, both of the name Elbaum as well as of the family itself.\n\nThe first mention of the surname Elbaum does not occur in Polish civil registration or parish records, but rather in a Hebrew Prenumeranten (subscription) list printed in Zolkiew in 1804. Virtually all of the notable scholars in Poland and Galicia subscribed to this book, Sefer Yere’im.[33] The ones from Jozefow are shown below in Figure 6. These are the town scholars.\n\nHaRav R’ Eliezer HaKohen Rappoport R’ Betzalel Vaks (WAX) mi-Yozifev R’ Dov Ber Eilboim R’ Zev Volf Leiterer R’ Yisroel Eilboim mi-Lukiv R’ Yisroel Vol-bedachter ? R’ Leibish Lerner mi-Yozifev R’ Lemel ben R K. Hoichman R’ Moshe Kupershtein R’ Moshe Schlossman mi-Yozifev R’ Shmuel ben haRav MiKACHAN ?\n\nFig. 6. List of subscribers for Sefer Yere’im (1804) living in Jozefow\n\nWe recognize our Yisroel ELBAUM and note that his given name does not contain the added Leibs, thus confirming our interpretation above. Both he and his relative, Dov Ber[34], used the Yiddishized version of the name Elbaum, namely “Eilboim”. In addition, Yisroel described himself as being from Lukowa, a village which he had left 46 years earlier, in 1758, in order to marry and settle in the town of Jozefow. Clearly, sometime between the death of Yakov Kopel in 1769 and 1804 the name Elbaum suddenly appeared. One must ask why, then, if there was still an emotional attachment to the descriptive Lukover, was there a fairly universal switch to a new surname, Elbaum. We believe that the name change was compelled by the 1787 Austrian Familianten laws and surname edicts.\n\nWe can also recognize three other personalities on the list:\n\n1. Yisroel Volbedachter who shows up in the civil registration records as Zrul WOLBEDACHT\n\n(d 1834)[35]. This is the same family as the one that Fayga ELBAUM (child # 3, above) married into. It appears that Zrul (son of Josef) was the nephew of Fayga.\n\n2. Furthermore, Zrul was married to Toba LERNER, the daughter of Josef LERNER, who was probably related to Leibish Lerner who also appears on the list.\n\n3. Betzalel Wax is also a fascinating person. He was a member of the family which founded a\n\npublishing house in Jozefow[36]. He was also the progenitor of a famous Rabbinic family[37].\n\nAnd most likely, he was a grandson of Yakov Kopel Lukover.[38] So far, the subscription list appears to contain members of an extended family; and this tends to confirm that Berek was indeed the brother of Fayga (#9 above) i.e. a son Yisroel Leibs. We would not be surprised if the others on the list were also relatives of Yisroel Leibs.[39\n\nIn 1772, the towns in which most of Kopel’s children were living, became part of Galicia. All descendants living at that time were Austrian subjects. In 1787 Austria decreed that all its Jews had to adopt German surnames[40]. Place names like Likover (lit. from Lukowa) were forbidden. Kopel’s living children suddenly had to replace LIKOVER with a Germanic name. But in 1809 Napoleon shrunk the size of Galicia. The towns, in which Elbaums were living, were suddenly no longer subject to Austrian laws. By then it was too late: Yisroel Leibs and Ber ELBAUM seem to have obediently chosen their surname, certainly by the 1804 publication of Sefer Yere’im. Nevertheless, since the Austrians would be interested in legal documents alone, Yisroel felt able to revert, in such a non-public setting, to the old toponym, Likover, which appears also on his headstone.\n\nThe question which remains is why the name Elbaum, in particular, was chosen. We hypothesize that in 1787 the family cleverly transformed the toponym into a surname via a 2-stage process: 1) applying an anagram (ie. re-arrangement of letters or words in phrases – especially common in Kabbalah; and 2) applying a calque (i.e. a literal translation, a copy, from one language to another). Any family, like Kopel’s, which was mystically inclined, felt comfortable doing so. Thus Likowa (cf Likover) was transformed into Oliwka which, in Polish can mean olive or olive tree. The latter version translates directly into the German ÖLBAUM / OELBAUM. This double trick allowed Yakov Kopel’s sons to preserve their original “surname” without offending the Austrian laws. By 1809, when the more liberal Polish regulations were in force, the surname was already established, and there was no natural desire to deviate from a surname which actually served its purpose, namely to honor the family’s famous ancestor\n\nHaving successfully traced the family from 1769 to modern times[41], we now turn our attention to additional children of Yakov Kopel Lukover beyond Shlomo Tzvi and Yisroel Leibs. Some clarification is needed for two of the known important children or grandchildren. Part of the fallout from this investigation allows us to penetrate to earlier times and locations. We also end up discovering 4 or 5 previously unknown children of Yakov Kopel.\n\na) Matel\n\nOne of the known daughters of Yakov Kopel, named Matel (b ca 1725), married Avraham Elazar Horowitz who became the Rabbi of the town of Jozefow. Their son, Yakov Yitzchak Horowitz, known as the “Chozeh” of Lublin, literally meaning “seer” or “visionary” in Hebrew, was a charismatic miracle-worker. He was popularized by his great intuitive powers and his penetrating gaze, and was thereby responsible for the early spread of Chassidism via his many disciples who took leadership roles in various towns throughout Poland. Indeed, he mentored his first-cousin, Shimon, Rebbe of Jaroslaw. And he was also responsible for the marriage of his much younger aunt (see below) to Alexander Sender Safran, the Rebbe of Komarno / Chmielnik, and indirectly of their son, Eyzyk, progenitor of a branch of the Zidichover Rebbes to his distant cousin[42]. We focus on the Seer because of the peculiarity of his given name, Yakov, so-named in 1745 during the lifetime of his grandfather, Yakov Kopel. The family lore, presumably initiated by Kopel himself, is described by Alfasi[43]. He was spared by the Angel of Death in the year 1744, and given an extra 25 years of life with the opportunity to marry off his eldest daughter, Matel, to see the birth of his grandson the future Seer, and to attend the latter’s marriage in 1765.[44] In fact, Kopel insisted on raising the young Yakov Yitzchak in his own home in Lukowa and then Tarnograd, away from the youth’s own parents. How could a Polish Jew tolerate the naming of a grandson in his own lifetime[45] and, indeed in his own presence? The answer must be the same as that for why there was in fact, another grandson of Kopel who was given the name Yakov. That was Jakob Elbaum of Kutno, born approximately in 1744[46].\n\nBut this mystery is only part of a larger puzzle: Why would the Amsterdam community choose a relatively unknown innkeeper from the agricultural village of Lukowa to be their Rabbi? How could a Polish village innkeeper develop his skills as an accomplished kabbalist in isolation without any masters? How could a simple Polish village innkeeper learn Italian well enough to intercede with his acquaintance, the Pope, on behalf of his fellow Jews?\n\nGenerally, the only Jews who name boys after their living grandfathers are Sefardi or Italian Jews. Consequently, we believe that Kopel or his father was an Italian or Sephardic Jew, possibly from Padua, Amsterdam or Venice where Kopel would be close to centers of Kabbalah and where he could have developed a friendship with the future Pope; and then moved to Lukowa 54 km from Zamość (“Padua of the North”) because of ties to Italian relatives. This certainly explains the naming anomaly. Why Zamość, though? It turns out that this was the home to Italian artisans and Sephardic and /or Italian Jews,[47] who had exclusively been invited by its owner, the nobleman Jan Zamoyski, to settle and develop his town Zamość in an Italian style in 1588. After his death in 1605, the Sephardic Jews are thought to have scattered or to have assimilated among Ashkenazi Jews. However, it seems just as plausible that they moved to other family holdings within the estate (Zamość, Goraj, Janów Lubelski, Kraśnik, Krzeszów, Szczebrzeszyn, Tarnogród, Tomaszów Lubelski, and Turobin, as well as 157 villages which presumably included Lukowa.)[48] The holdings of the family expanded considerably. Until 1775 distant Kutno, too, was owned by Andrzej Zamoyski. We presume that after the original Zamość estates fell under Austrian rule in 1773, many Jews from that area may have moved to privately owned Kutno, which was under Prussian control from 1793 to1807, in order to avoid increasingly oppressive Austrian laws, for family ties, or for economic reasons. In Kutno there is mention of, not only Elbaums, but also of other exclusive Zamość area families living in Kutno, (e.g. KIBEL, SPERLING, ELBAUM, ROK / RAK, SZLAJFER, GAJST). This could explain the sudden blooming of the Elbaum records in Kutno, including the death of Yakov, a grandson of Kopel born ca 1744, a member of a family which was apparently still observing Mediterranean customs.\n\nIn principle, we can go further and try to find Kopel’s family in Western Europe. The major centers for Kaballah in the late 17th early 18th century were Venice and Amsterdam. A major hotbed of Kabbalah at the time was Padua[49] (Bonomi personal communication). Prominent Kabbalists of the time were Moses ben Mordecai Zacuto of Amsterdam; and Moshe Chaim Luzzatto of Venice and Amsterdam – a younger contemporary of Kopel Lukover. Mantua is also a strong possibility since many prominent Italian Kabbalists were buried at Mantua.[50]\n\nTracing Kopel’s father, Kalonymus, (Calimani in Italian) within these circles is a work in progress.\n\nThe possible Sefardi connection suggests the need to participate in Y-DNA testing. The Elbaums belong to Haplogroup G2b-M377[51]. This includes two Elbaums, one Ohlbaum, one Albom and one Olivinbaum who have been tested. The Elbaum subclade is G-Y15861[52] and is unique to the Lukover-Elbaum family. According to Beider[53] the name Olivenbaum was adopted in Jaroslaw; however, we could not find family records there. Instead, we found Copel Leib Olivenbaum, born in 1840, living in the city of Iasi[54]. The Y-DNA tests verify that the Olivenbaums must have been originally Elbaums who had changed their surname to Olivenbaum by the time they reached Moldavia.\n\nb) The Safrin Dynasty\n\nThe identity of the mother of Yitzchak Yehuda Yechiel SAFRIN, the Chassidic Rebbe of Komarno, has been somewhat controversial until the present study. Family lore merely asserts descent from Yakov Kopel Lukover. Wunder[55] claims that she was Chana, the granddaughter of Kopel. Others claim, again without justification, that she was Chawa[56], an actual daughter of Kopel. One would think that civil registry records ought to clarify the issue; however, it appears that researchers were scouring, in vain, the archives of Safrin, Hungary from where his family came, or else the original family surname, EICHENSTEIN, of Zydaczow where he was brought up. We have, however, uncovered the 1822 Pinczow marriage record of the 20-year old Yitzchak Yehuda Yechiel, the future Admor of Komarno[57] (signing as Eyzyk Sender, i.e. son of Sender, and living in Chmielnik, as expected), to 19-year old Gitl (the daughter of the Admor of Pinczow, Avraham Mordechai HOROWICZ, again as expected). An image of this record (Figure 7, below) shows that the groom’s mother is named Rochl z Koplow.\n\nFig. 7. Image of a portion of the 1822 marriage record of Yitzchak [SAFRIN], son of Rochl, daughter of Kopel\n\nIn the style of the Codex Napoleon for such records, this means that Rochl was the daughter of Kopel, presumably Kopel LUKOWER. However, the name is Rochl rather than Chana or Chawa. One possible explanation is that it is the groom’s maternal grandmother who is cited rather than his mother herself – a rather odd procedure or clerical error. Alternatively, in principle, it could be that both mother and grandmother were each daughters of different Kopels. However, in Chassidic circles it is taboo for a girl to marry a man with the same name as that of her father. On the face of it, therefore, it appears that it was Kopel’s daughter, Rochl, born not much later than ca 1765, who married Sender SAFRIN, born supposedly ca 1765. If so, that means that Rochl was born to an elderly Kopel from a second wife. She was orphaned in 1769. By the time that Rochl was ready for marriage around 1785 to the Chozeh’s disciple, Sender, she was probably under the guardianship of her nephew, the Chozeh, who was 20 years older than she was. It would only be natural to find a groom from the Chozeh’s circle. The Chozeh’s strong interest in Rochl’s well-being continued for many years. According to the family lore of the Komarno dynasty, the Chozeh certainly advocated for the engagement of Sender’s and Rochl’s son, Eyzyk, to Gitl HOROWITZ in 1815 when Eyzyk was only 13, i.e. very shortly before the Chozeh died[58]. The marriage took place seven years later in 1822 in Pinczow. But why choose a bride from Pinczow of all places? Aside from the fact that Gitl’s father, Avraham Mordechai HOROWITZ, the Admor of Pinczow, was also a disciple of the Chozeh, someone on the spot in Pinczow must have proposed the match to the Chozeh. It turns out that the Chozeh had prior ties to Pinczow: One of the Chozeh’s own grandsons, Szmul Szaja SZTERNFELD, married Ita Riwa GOLDKORN of Pinczow during his own lifetime. There is also the likelihood that Mindl (1752-1812), a previously unknown sister of the Chozeh living in Pinczow, was in a position of influence. Mindl had married a certain Icyk (d 1818) son of Fiszel LUBELSKI\n\n(indicating an origin in Lublin Guberniya.) The LUBELSKIs had settled in Pinczow prior to 1775. The Pinczow records indicate explicitly that Mindl was the daughter of Abram Leyzor [HOROWITZ] and [Matel ELBAUM][59]. It is not surprising, therefore, that Mindl named one of her daughters Matel (presumably after her own mother). Descendants of this branch of the LUBELSKIs are, therefore, previously unknown descendants of Kopel LUKOVER. Figure 8 shows the time scales for Kopel’s daughters, Matel and Rochl.\n\nFig. 8 Kopel Lukover’s daughters linked by the Chozeh of Lublin\n\nc) Michla\n\nMichla was the wife of Zrul (i.e. Izrael) ZYSBRENNER of Josefow. (The surname indicates that he was a brandy producer, a trade which complemented that of Yakov Kopel Lukower). Figure 9, below, shows that when Michla died in 1825 at the age of 76 her maiden name was given as ELBAUM[60]. (Thus she was born in 1749.) Moreover, she named a son Kopel in 1777 who married Szajndl Jenta WAKS (brother of the Cala WAKS described earlier, who signed the subscription list.) These two facts indicate that Michla was the daughter of Yakov Kopel himself. In truth, some of her children moved to Krasnobrod, and named two grandchildren Gryna; and so one might think that Michla was the daughter of Shlomo Tzvi (son of Kopel) and Gryna of Krasnobord, rather than of Kopel directly. However, we think this is a coincidence since Gryna seems to have been an ancestral name of the WAKS family too.[61] Furthermore, Shlomo Tzvi was born in 1736, and his wife, Gryna, was born in 1738, dates which make it impossible for them to be the parents of a Michla born in 1749.\n\nFig. 9. 1825 death record of Michla ELBAUM, daughter of Yakov Kopel Lukover, the only official record that associates Kopel with ELBAUM\n\nd) Chaja Sora\n\nIn our discussion of the WAKS family, above, we noted the cousin marriage between Ryfka Matl (daughter of Szajndl Jenta nee WAKS) and Szmul WAKS (son of Ankel WAKS). Szajndl Jenta and Szmul were siblings, both being children of Lejb WAX and Chaja Sora. We also suggested that, where there was one cousin marriage, there was probably an earlier cousin marriage – namely the one between Szjandl Jenta herself and Kopel ZYSBRENNER. As described above, since Kopel ZYSBRENNER was a grandson of Yakov Kopel, then so too was Szajndl Jenta a grand-daughter, thus making Chaja Sora a daughter of Kopel Lukover. She could not have been the daughter of Yisroel Leibs or of Szlama, since these sons were roughly the same age as Chaja Sora. However, we cannot rule out that she was the daughter of Szmul, below.\n\ne) Szmul\n\nAs mentioned above, we believe that the distant town of Kutno was a secondary homestead of the early ELBAUMs. They seem to have moved there (along with other longstanding residents of the district of Zamość, tied together by family), out of a desire to find new economic advantages under the protection of the Zamoyski family, which had recently acquired this private town. The time-mapping of Figure 1 indicates that this happened very early, namely before the end of the 18th century. Therefore, we believe that the ELBAUM family which was living in Kutno were part of the first generation after Yakov Kopel. The earliest members of that branch who are mentioned explicitly in the Kutno records are Jakob ELBAUM (1744-1814)[62] and his son, Samuel ELBAUM (1763-1825)[63] married (second time) to Ester SZLAYFER[64].\n\nAround the same time that Jakob’s family was establishing itself in Kutno, a second related family began raising a family there: When Juda [Lejb] Hersz OELBAUM[65] (b 1794) named a son Szmul [ben] Leyb in 1820, the birth was witnessed by the father’s uncle, also similarly named Szmul Lejbuszowicz ELBAUM (born in 1770)[66]. Consequently, it makes sense that the head of this branch of the family was a Leybusz ELBAUM, born around 1745 to 1750. He was a contemporary of Jakob ELBAUM, described above — possibly his brother. We do not know for sure where Leybusz himself was living. All we know is that one of his sons was from Kutno. However, there is proof that Szmul Leybuszowicz ELBAUM’s son, namely Hersz Leyb ELBAUM was born in Ciepielow[67], but was raising a family in Granica, Tarlow and Gniewoszow. Consequently, it seems that Szmul Leybuszowicz was living at one point in Ciepielow.\n\nWe can summarize to this point by saying that there were two first-cousins with similar names – Hersz Lejb of Ciepielow and Juda Leyb Hersz of Kutno, both grandsons of Leybusz ELBAUM of Kutno, a likely brother of Jakob of Kutno. Now, we note that both of these brothers (Leybusz and Jakob) named a son Samuel / Szmul around the same time. Consequently, it makes sense to say that the two brothers were sons of an early Szmul ELBAUM, born around 1720.\n\nWho was this early Szmul? We can only speculate. There were two contemporary Szmuls named after him in Kutno: a) one born in 1770, who was the son of Leybusz; and b) one born in 1763, who was the son of Jakob. And there was actually a third contemporary Szmul (1777 – 1836), son of Berek ELBAUM of Warsaw (see below).[68] Since the earliest Szmul was born ca 1720, this means that the very early Szmul died rather young, prior to 1763. Given the year of birth, the most obvious conclusion is that Szmul could only have been a previously unknown son of Yakov Kopel Lukover.\n\nf) Berek\n\nWe have come across records of three early Berek ELBAUMs.\n\nBerek (1781-?), a hatmaker who was raising a family in Kutno.[69] We have no record which enables us to identify him conclusively. However, he is most likely a son of Jakob of Kutno whose family also occupied itself with hatmaking.\n\nBerek (ca 1775-?) of Jozefow and Jerusalem, whom we have identified as a son of Yisroel Leibs of Jozefow. He was married to Frayda FYNKIEL.\n\nA very early Berek (ca 1740 – >1812) of Warsaw, who was married to Brandl. They had sons, Szmul ELBAUM (1777-1836) and Szlama ELBAUM (b ca 1770). This early Berek could not have been a son of Shlomo Tzvi or of Yisroel Leibs (sons of Yakov Kopel) because these two were born around the same time as Berek. Berek could only have been a son of Szmul of Kutno, born ca 1720 or earlier, or a son of Yakov Kopel Lukover himself. Both are equally possible from the point of view of birth years. We believe, though, since the name Szmul was transmitted through the generations in Berek’s family, then it is more logical to conclude that this early Berek was a son of the early Szmul of Kutno. However, we cannot definitively rule out that Berek was a previously unknown son of Yakov Kopel.\n\nLeaving out the details for the four previously known children of Yakov Kopel, we can now reconstruct a speculative family history in Figure 10 below, focusing mostly on the early generations of the various Szmuls and the various Bereks involved.\n\nFig. 10. Reconstructed family history of some descendants of Yakov Kopel Lukover, emphasizing the first generation, the various Bereks and the branch from Kutno.\n\nThere are many more additional ELBAUM families throughout our regions of Poland, born in the 18th century, who must be connected to Yakov Kopel. However, for lack of data, we are unable to definitively make the links. Therefore we have not included them in Figure 10.\n\nNotable among such early personalities are, in chronological order of birth year: Izrael Icyk ELBAUM (ca 1740- ) of Sierpc; Mosiek ELBAUM (ca 1750- ) of Zareba Koscielne; Lejb ELBAUM (1757-1817) of Bilgoraj; Icyk ALBOIM (1759-1829) of Przytyk; Eyzyk ELBAUM (ca 1760- ) of Konskawola; Abram EHLBAUM (ca 1765- ) of Krasnik; Szymel ELBOIM (ca 1765- <1830) of Parczew; Salomon ELBAUM (ca 1775- ) of Jaroslaw and Jozefow, probably a son of Yisroel Leibs; Szymon ELBOIM (ca 1775 -) of Parczew; Icek ELBAUM (ca 1780- ) of Wladowa); Leyb ELBAUM (1780 -) of Szczebrzeszyn; Moszek Josek ELBAUM (ca 1780 -) of Wlodawa; Kopel ELBAUM (1781-1839) of Zarnowiec; Abram ELBOIM (1786- ) of Komarow; Jankiel ELBAUM (ca 1790-<1861) of Glowno; Ayzyk ELBAUM (ca 1790 – >1832) of Konskie; and Leyzor ELBAUM (1793- ) of Zolkiewka. The only ones who could qualify as additional sons of Yakov Kopel are those born prior to 1769. There are three Icyks / Eyzyks among them. At most one of them would qualify. It is important to emphasize that all of the personalities born prior to 1788 would mostly have been born in Zamość county, and they have been assigned the name Elbaum retroactively.\n\nSummarizing, we see that Yakov Kopel was having children as early as 1720 (Szmul ca 1720, Matel ca 1725) and as late as ca 1765 (Rochla). In between those limits he had 4 previously known children, and 3 newly-discovered children (Michla, Chaja Sora and Szmul) and as many as 4 more from the list, above. Clearly, Yakov Kopel was married at least twice. However, there are no records revealing the name of either of his wives.\n\nDNA Analysis\n\nThe following glossary might be useful for readers without prior background in genetics:\n\nY-DNA – The portion of DNA passed uniquely down the male-to-male path.\n\nNucleotide – a building block of DNA consisting of arrangements of 4 chemicals symbolized by\n\nA, G, C, and T\n\nSTR – Short Tandem Repeat—pattern of repeating nucleotides, such e.g. “AGAT”\n\nSNP – Single Nucleotide Polymorphism—difference in one nucleotide (letter) from the reference\n\nHaplogroup – A group of individuals who share a common SNP that defines a branching point of the human genetic tree\n\nSubclade – a downstream haplogroup (subclade), i.e. a smaller (newer) haplogroup that a particular SNP defines as a more recent branch (“descendant”) of a larger, older haplogroup.\n\nHaplotype – An individual’s genetic markers\n\nMRCA – Most Recent Common Ancestor\n\ntMRCA – Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor. This is usually a statistical estimate +/- 5%\n\nybp – years before present.\n\nBAM file – a binary format for storing genetic sequence data\n\nAutosomal DNA – DNA which is inherited from the numbered chromosomes, in distinction from the sex chromosome\n\nHistocompatibility complex – a large region of DNA responsible for formation of proteins needed for the immune system.\n\nAllele – one of the possible forms of a gene (e.g. dominant or recessive)\n\nThe possible Sefardi / Italki connection, discovered above, suggests the need to participate in Y-DNA testing. The test group included two Elbaums, one Ohlbaum, one Albom and one Olivenbaum. The names Ohlbaum and Albom can be considered dialectic versions of Elbaum. Olivenbaum is a little more questionable. According to Beider[70] the name Olivenbaum was adopted in Jaroslaw; however, we could not find family records there. Instead, we found Copel Leib Olivenbaum, born in 1840, living in the city of Iasi[71]. The Y-DNA tests verify that the Olivenbaums must have been originally Elbaums who had changed their surname to Olivenbaum by the time they reached Moldavia. These tests, conducted by FamilyTree DNA are based on an analysis of up to 111 STRs. Those tests, taken so far, do indeed confirm the validity of our surname paper trail, as they all match that of a pedigreed descendant of Yakov Koppe\n\nIn order to delve further into the genetic and geographic origins of the ELBAUM family, we undertook whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of a saliva sample provided by a 101-year old Holocaust survivor, Boruch Elbaum (A”H), born in 1917. It was carried out by Open Genomes Foundation[72]. The entire set of results and methodology, as applied to Boruch Elbaum, can be seen on its website[73]. In short, the procedure used was an Illumina 150 base-pair paired-end read Build 38 (hg38) 40x read depth whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis, which produced an excellent (99.85%) Y-coverage. Open Genomes Foundation uploaded a Y-DNA BAM file to YFull[74], a company that analyzed the Elbaum Y-subclade. Figure 11 shows the basic results of the Y-DNA analysis alone.\n\nFig. 11. Y-DNA map of the branches of G-Y15861* (a subclade of G-Y12975, a subclade of G-M377). G-Y12975, also denoted as AB-056 contains 4%-6% of Ashkenazi Jews and is one of largest Ashkenazi Haplogroups[75].\n\nYaakov Kopel Likover was in a basal branch of Y-DNA, G-Y15861[76], which split off from the G-Y12975 branch of the G2b1-M377[77] trunk. Subsequently, its subclade, denoted by id:YF14448 (location listed as POL-LB = Polish-Lubelski) branched off, and it is unique to the Lukover-Elbaum family, i.e. no other Sephardi, Ashkenazi, or Gentile male DNA has been found to match this Y-DNA subclade. No other matches at all exist to tell us where this Y-DNA came from. Until such time as other families are tested in the same way and found to be members of this sub-clade, we can say only that the ELBAUMs’ ancestors of id:YF14448 migrated independently of other branches of G-Y15861.\n\nThe time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of G-Y12975 is 1050 ybp i.e. 970 CE , which would just predate the settlement of Ashkenazi Jews in the Rhineland in the year 987 CE. The tMRCA of G-Y15861* itself is 850 ybp, i.e. 1170 CE, which predates the documented influx of Jews into Poland and Lithuania in 1350 CE, i.e. right after the Black Death massacres of 1348-1349 in the Holy Roman Empire. We do not know where in Central Europe the ELBAUM ancestors were living, say, in 1250 CE, since there are multiple scenarios. Possibilities include France, Italy, or the Rhineland.\n\nAdditional Y-SNP testing could help to find other subjects from Y15861 and thus pinpoint a specific route to Poland. These living trees are continuously updated, as new SNPs are discovered; and we can also expect that once more subjects are tested, we would be able to determine a genetic signature of Yakov Kopel LUKOVER from the SNP analysis.\n\nThe whole genome SNP array data for autosomal DNA too was extracted by Open Genomes, and uploaded to Gedmatch and Family Finder. This is a particularly interesting analysis because Boruch Elbaum’s ancestry along maternal lines, using archival records from the same region surrounding Zamosc county, is known. We had found that Boruch Elbaum descends from Yakov Kopel Lukover in several additional directions – via the aforementioned Waks, Kagan, Rozner, and Kupferstein families, as discussed above, i.e. also along maternal lines. Therefore the results are relevant also for the spouses of the early male ELBAUM ancestors.\n\nThe following ancestral components, based on a Monte Carlo averaged analysis of Boruch Elbaum’s Eurogenes Global25 principal components (compared to those of all 500 Jewish samples tested) shows that there is no sign of native Iberian ancestry as would be common among Sephardim, even compared to some other Ashkenazi Jews. Boruch Elbaum’s ancestry is somewhat analogous to that of a German Jew, without any detectable Slavic ancestry, much like most Polish and Russian Jews have.\n\nFigure 12. Admixture Analysis Showing No Native Iberian Ancestry\n\nFinally, we also analyzed Boruch Elbaum’s Major Histocompatiblity Complex (MHC) Class I alleles (HLA-A*26 – HLA-B*38 – HLA-C*12). As can be seen from Figure 13, they are the most common haplotype combination among a large set of Ashkenazim[78].\n\nFigure 13. Ashkenazi Jews in the Allele Frequencies in Worldwide Populations. The order of the haplotypes is from most frequent among Jews to less frequent.\n\nIn closing, all three tests – YDNA, autosomal DNA, and allele frequencies indicate that Boruch Elbaum had Ashkenazi ancestry with no overt signs of a Sephardic lineage.\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting from a classical reconstruction of a family tree in the particular town of Krasnobrod, we have succeeded in tracking the entire family of Shlomo Tzvi Elbaum, in linking him to the kabbalist, Yakov Kopel Likover, and in deducing the latter’s previously unknown descendants. We have examined family tombstones and the subscription list of an important scholarly work, thereby learning more about the family. The peculiar geopolitical history of the main towns of residence in relationship to Austrian naming laws allowed us to determine the etymological origin of the surname, Elbaum. The naming of grandchildren of the progenitor of the family during his lifetime, along with peculiar aspects of the hagiography allowed us to determine the possible Italian provenance of the family.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to JRI-Poland for making available its very extensive database of extracts of vital records, as well as to Petje Schroeder for her professional extracts of hard-to-find parish records, and to Tadeusz Przystojecki of Grodzka N.N. for finding and translating lost records.

Jozefow, pp 256-258. Jerusalem: Yad Vashem. Retrieved fromhttps://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/pinkas_poland/pol7_00256.html. The chapter on the early Rabbis states that “at the beginning of the [19th] century, probably 1824, Dawid Saadia and Szaja Waks founded a Hebrew printing press [in Jozefow].” Szaja WAKS (ca 1790 – ) does appear in the civil registration records of Jozefow, as a clergyman and as a son of Cala (Betzalel) WAX (1770-1828). See 1828 death akta 6, PSA Archive 35, Fond 1736/0/2/3. Cala is described as a dealer in paper, a convenient if not a necessary affiliation to a printing house. He is also known to have been a wealthy owner of an agricultural estate in the village of Hamer outside of Tarnograd, although he was described in the records as living in nearby Hrubieszow, where indeed we have found records of the rest of the extended family.\n\n[37] The history of the WAKS family is described in the introduction to Chaim Elazar Waks (2006) Nefesh Chaya. Part 2 of Ginzei Avot, edited by his descendant R’Yehoshua Eibeshitz (1916-2019), Jerusalem: HaMachole Limudei HaShoah. See especially p. 180. Chaim Elazar Waks (1822-1889) was the Av Beit Din (Head of the Rabbinical Court) in Tarnograd (near Lukowa) from the age of 18 until 1859, succeeding his father, Abram Lejb (a son of Cala); and then he became the Av Beit Din of Kalisz, from where his fame as halachic arbiter spread throughout Poland. (Interestingly, in the civil registry records of Kalisz his surname is given as GERYMTER-WAKS a couple of times for no apparent reason, except that it literally means “the illustrious” in Yiddish, apparently to distinguish him from the many other (unrelated) WAKSes living in Kalisz. But we note that Szaja WAKS, the clergyman from Jozefow and uncle of Chaim Elazar, married off a son into the GERYMTER family of Jozefow. So the GERYMTER part of the surname was not the original family surname, but nevertheless not totally invented. See also Rosenstein, Neil (2008) Avotaynu, Vol 24 for a related interpretation. Chaim Elaza WAKS was the son-in-law of Yehoshua Trunk, the Rabbi of Kutno, an ELBAUM outpost. Chaim Elazar’s father, Abram Lejb (b ca 1795), was the son of the Betzalel (Cala) WAKS appearing in the subscription list. The editor of Nefesh Chaya was not personally aware of the parentage of Cala (private communication) prior to our research.\n\n[38] Cala (Betzalel) was the son of Leib WAKS of Hrubieszow and of Chaja Sora. Leib must have been born ca 1745 or earlier. Numerous descendants of Cala’s siblings were named Cala, suggesting that Leib’s father was probably named Cala (b. ca 1720 or earlier). Now, Leib’s daughter, Jenta Szajndl, married a Kopel ZYSBRENNER (b.1777) who, it turns out (see below), was a grandson of Yakov Kopel Lukover himself, via a previously unknown daughter, Michla. Jenta Szjandl’s daughter, Ryfka Matl (1827 marriage akta 4, PSA Archive 35, Fond 1736/0/2/2) married Cala WAKS’ nephew, Szmul in 1827, son of [J]Ankiel WAKS (born 1780). This was most likely a cousin marriage, suggesting that Jankel (akaYakov) too was a grandson of Yakov Kopel Lukover. The only obvious explanation is that Chaja Sora was another previously unknown daughter, or else the original Betzalel WAKS (b ca 1720) was a previously unknown son-in-law of Yakov Kopel.\n\n[39] We can give two examples:\n\n1) Frojm KUPFERSZTEJN (1784-1824) married Serl WAKS, a probable sister of Cala. Also, Cala himself married Chana KUPFERSZTEJN, daughter of Chaim and Basia. So it is recorded in her death record. In earlier records she was surnamed HAMER; but that was most likely because she must have come from or lived in HAMER, the estate that Cala owned.) Unfortunately, we do not know the relationship between Frojm and Chaim to Moshe KUPFERSZTEJN of the distribution list, as the latter is not mentioned in the parish records. We surmise The simplest conclusion is that Moshe must have died between the writing of the distribution list in 1804 and the first records in 1810. However, the available records are not complete. So we reserve judgment.\n\n2) We have also deciphered a headstone inscription in the Jewish cemetery of Jozefow, the image of which was kindly provided by Prof. Trzciński. It describes the deceased, Yakov Yitzchak HaKohen (1847-1878) benMordechai, as a descendant of Yakov Kopel Lukover. Although no real surname appears on the headstone, we found his marriage record (1869 marriage akta 1, PSA Archive 35, Fond 1736) in the civil registry records of Jozefow, which revealed that his parents were Mordka KAHN (1800-1854) and Chana ROZNER. The latter’s marriage record (1823 marriage akta 23, PSA Archive 35, Fond 1736/0/2/9) showed Mordka’s parents to be [Szmul-] Zanwel KAHAN / KACHAN (ca 1775 – 1834) and Ryfka (d. 1817). The death record (1834 death akta 28, PSA Archive 35, Fond 1834) revealed Szmul Zanwel’s parents to be Mortko KACHAN (ca 1750 – bed 1800) and Ryfka. It turns out that Szmul’s sister, Zeftel, married Tewel ELBAUM from Krasnobrod).\n\nTherefore, not only is there a marriage into Yakov Kopel’s family but also, according to the 1878 headstone, the KACHAN’s were also independently descended from Yakov Kopel. Since the original Mordko KACHAN was a Kohen, he could not be a son of Kopel. However, Mordko’s wife Ryfka born ca 1750 or earlier might well have been yet another unknown daughter (or granddaughter) of Kopel. In the context of the subscription list we note that one of the signators was Shmuel, son of the Rabbi Mi-Kachan. We are tempted to identify him as our Szmul Zanwel KACHAN, were it not for the extra letter “Mi”. It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that the first name on the list, Rabbi Eliezer HaKOHEN, might have had a connection to the KACHAN / HaKohen family – perhaps even the father of Mortko.\n\n[40] Patent. “Die Führung bestimmter Geschlechtsnamen von 1-ten Jäner 1788 bei fer Judenschaft betrefend” [Austrian German version] or „Uniwersał.
