Nasser led the Egyptian revolution of 1952 and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year.\n\n Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Mohamed Naguib under house arrest and assumed executive office. He was formally elected president in June 1956.\n\n#powerofafrica #discoverafrica\".",
