The movie starred several prominent actors, with the late actor Ahmad Zaki as the Egyptian president. It is considered to be one of Zaki's greatest performances, capturing intimate details about the president in great accuracy. One notable characteristic of Sadat was his speech pattern, which Ahmad Zaki captured strongly in his performance.\n\nThe movie included several prominent actors of Egypt, including:\n\nAhmad Zaki as President Sadat\n\nMona Zaki as the young Jehan Al Sadat\n\nMervat Amin as First Lady Jehan Al Sadat\n\nAhmed El Sakka as Atef El Sadat, the president's brother\n\nMohamed El Kholi as President Gamal Abdel Nasser\n\nDirector Mohamed Khan received high praise for his directing of the movie. However, some critics[who?] claimed that the movie was a bit too biased, since it only focused on the writings of Sadat himself from his book, In Search of an Identity.\n\nWhen the movie was released in 2001, it attracted a huge following in Egypt, ranking as one of Egypt's highest grossing movies. This was Zaki's second biographical movie, following Nasser 56.\n\nAyam El Sadat at the Internet Movie Database"
