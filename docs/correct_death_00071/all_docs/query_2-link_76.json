        "text": "'In this original and absorbing book, Laura James chronicles Nasser's involvement in four major wars. There is a great deal of new material here, fresh assessments, and subtle analysis of the mindset of the Arab world's iconic leader. Nasser's image of the enemy is presented as the key to understanding his foreign policy. A remarkable book about a remarkable leader.' - Avi Shlaim, St Antony's College, Oxford\n\n'Fluently written and based on a wide range of sources, James's book is one of the most significant pieces of scholarship to have emerged on the Nasser regime in recent years. Nasser at War will make essential reading for contemporary Middle East specialists.' - Nigel Ashton, London School of Economics and Politics, UK\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 85.59\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 106.99\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access\n\nLicence this eBook for your library\n\nInstitutional subscriptions"
