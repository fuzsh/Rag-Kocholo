Any sense of completely secular Arab states ended with him and what we see today happening in the Middle East is a direct result of Western opposition to Nasser&#39;s strategies and ideals.<br /> <br /> Nasser is a fascinating figure fraught with dilemmas. With the CIA continually trying to undermine him, Nasser threw his lot in with the Soviet Union, even though he was fervently anti-Communist. Nasser wanted to build up a military on par with Israel&#39;s, but didn&#39;t want either the &#39;56 or &#39;67 wars. This was a man who was a dictator, but also a popular leader with an ideology which appealed to most of the Arab people and bound them together. While he was alive, there was a brief chance of actual Arab unity producing common, honest, and incorruptible governments throughout the region.<br /> <br /> More than ever, the Arab world is anti-Western and teetering on disaster, and this examination of Nasser&#39;s life is tantamount to understanding whether the interests of the West and the Arab world are reconcilable.<br /> <br /> Nasser is a definitive and engaging portrait of a man who stood at the center of this continuing clash in the Middle East.<br />",

With the CIA continually trying to undermine him, Nasser threw his lot in with the Soviet Union, even though he was fervently anti-Communist. Nasser wanted to build up a military on par with Israel's, but didn't want either the '56 or '67 wars. This was a man who was a dictator, but also a popular leader with an ideology which appealed to most of the Arab people and bound them together.
