Its dedication to Arabic literature in the modern period, that is, from the nineteenth century onwards, is what makes it unique among series undertaken by academic publishers in the Englishspeaking world. Individual books on modern Arabic literature in general or aspects of it have been and continue to be published sporadically. Series on Islamic studies and Arab/Islamic thought and civilisation are not in short supply either in the academic world, but these are far removed from the study of Arabic literature qua literature, that is, imaginative, creative literature as we understand the term when, for instance, we speak of English literature or French literature. Even series labelled ‘Arabic/Middle Eastern Literature’ make no period distinction, extending their purview from the sixth century to the present, and often including non-Arabic literatures of the region. This series aims to redress the situation by focusing on the Arabic literature and criticism of today, stretching its interest to the earliest beginnings of Arab modernity in the nineteenth century. The need for such a dedicated series, and generally for the redoubling of scholarly endeavour in researching and introducing modern Arabic literature to the Western reader, has never been stronger. Among activities and events heightening public, let alone academic, interest in all things Arab, and not least Arabic literature, are the significant growth in the last decades of the translation of contemporary Arab authors from all genres, especially fiction, into English; the higher profile of Arabic literature internationally since the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Naguib Mahfouz in 1988; the growing number of Arab authors living in the Western diaspora and writing both in\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 6\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nseri es edi tor’s f orewo r d | vii English and Arabic; the adoption of such authors and others by mainstream, high-circulation publishers, as opposed to the academic publishers of the past; the establishment of prestigious prizes, such as the International Prize for Arabic Fiction (the Arabic Booker), run by the Man Booker Foundation, which brings huge publicity to the shortlist and winner every year, as well as translation contracts into English and other languages; and very recently the events of the Arab Spring. It is therefore part of the ambition of this series that it will increasingly address a wider reading public beyond its natural territory of students and researchers in Arabic and world literature. Nor indeed is the academic readership of the series expected to be confined to specialists in literature in the light of the growing trend for interdisciplinarity, which increasingly sees scholars crossing field boundaries in their research tools and coming up with findings that equally cross discipline borders in their appeal. Critical examinations of autobiography, memoirs, and other forms of selfwriting in Arabic literature are few and far between, leaving scholarship lagging behind a steadily growing genre in Arabic literature, not only in Arabic but also in Francophone and Anglophone literature penned by Arab writers. This series has already contributed to the redress of this imbalance with Valerie Anishchenkova’s title, Autobiographical Identities in Contemporary Arab Culture (2014). The title in hand extends the subject further in at least two ways: by focusing the study within the context of a post-colonial, antiimperialist approach, bringing in a multiplicity of new authors and texts, and going beyond texts written in Arabic to include also Anglophone and Francophone texts authored by Arab writers, during the colonial period and post-independence up to the twenty-first century. The scope of the book is broad, not only in the period it covers, nearly a hundred years, with a full spectrum of changing social and political conditions, but also in the geographic spread of the authors and texts investigated that extend across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region with its different cultures, different ethnicities, and different colonial and post-colonial experiences, and indeed the experience of Arab writers in the diaspora, too (for example, Edward Said). The breadth of coverage is further strengthened by the author not limiting herself to narrative prose, the natural medium of autobiography and memoirs, but extending her interest across genres to include poetry (for\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 7\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nviii | li tera ry auto b io gr a p h y example, Mahmoud Darwish and Mourid Barghouti), especially relevant to the postcolonial framework of her approach. This strategy enhances the representative quality of the study and underscores the cross-genre uniformity of the literary response to the changing historical conditions and the sociopolitical scene. Particularly original too in the author’s theoretical context is her movement away from the traditional Eurocentric approach that juxtaposes East and West, opting rather to place the Arab experience in the ‘global South’ or a ‘South–South’ perspective where the Arab literature is examined comparatively in relation to other national experiences of colonisation and independence.

Personal names with spellings that have become standard in English are rendered in the forms known to an Anglophone audience (for example, Gamal Abdel Nasser). The names of authors whose works have been translated into English are transliterated upon first mention, and appear thenceforth in the conventional English spellings (for example, Taha Hussein). The names of Arab authors writing in English and French are rendered in the most common and preferred spelling. All references to Arabic memoirs and novels are to the original. I use existing translations of works that have been translated from Arabic or French to English. Parenthetical citations refer to the Arabic or French original, followed by the English translation. Unless otherwise noted, all translations are my own. A list of abbreviations for all literary works cited is included.\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 12\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nAbbreviations\n\nA1, A2, A3 al-Ayyām Aa al-Ajnabīyah Ab A†yāf AD Fī Arwiqat al-Dhākirah AF L’Amour, la fantasia BM al-Bāb al-Maftūª C Children of the New World DB Dreaming of Baghdad DN Dhākirah li-l Nisyān EC An Egyptian Childhood F Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade Óamlat Taftīsh: Awrāq Shakh‚īyyah HT IW I Was Born There, I Was Born Here J Jidārīyya JO Journal of an Ordinary Grief LP Looking for Palestine M Mural MF Memory for Forgetfulness N Notes from the Oases Prison NP Nulle part dans la maison de mon père OD The Open Door OP Out of Place PF A Passage to France R al-Riªlah RR Ra’aytu Rāmallāh Í al-Íarkhah\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 13\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nxiv | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y Sc The Scream Sa Specters Sb Stealth SD The Stream of Days SP The Search: Personal Papers SR I Saw Ramallah SS State of Siege T al-Tala‚‚u‚ TR Tilka al-Rā’iªa TS That Smell W Wulidtu Hunākah, Wulidtu Hunā Y Yawmiyyāt al-Óuzn al-‘Ādī\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 14\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nIntroduction Literary Solitude: Autobiography, Modernity, and Independence Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it. Gabriel García Márquez, Living to Tell the Tale\n\nI\n\nn 1926, the Egyptian reformer Taha Hussein (˝āhā Óusayn) (1889–1973) wrote the first volume of his autobiography, al-Ayyām (The Days), in France.1 The evocation of the journey of the young blind boy from the village to the Azhar showed very little of the effects of the controversy of the publication of his book Fī al-Shi‘r al-Jāhilī (On Pre-Islamic Poetry, 1926).2 However, the story of his boyhood – and, over the three volumes, the narration of his rise from poverty to the pinnacle of the Egyptian literary community – was written in response to the controversy. The story of the completion of his three-volume autobiography from 1926 to 1967– two volumes are separated by another controversy – is a chronicle of the journey of the Egyptian reformer. Years later, when he was discharged from his post at the modern Egyptian University (renamed Fu’ad I and now Cairo University) in 1932 for his political writings (Cachia 2012), he wrote the second volume The Stream of Days: A Student at the Azhar (1939). The history of his autobiographical project enacts the deep public involvement and solitude of the writer. In the second half of the twentieth century, Arab autobiography flourished in different forms, including memoirs, the autobiographical novel, journals, diaries, and poetry. With roots in medieval Arabic chronicles, treatises, and travelogues, the nineteenth-century novel, and the foundational ­autobiography by Taha Hussein, Arab writers developed new a­ utobiographical\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 1\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n2 | li terary au to b io gr a ph y forms.3 At the same time, they created new conceptions of subjectivity, the role of the writer, and political agency in response to colonialism, nationalism, and independence. The colonial encounter produced new Anglophone and Francophone autobiography that further enriched Arab cultural production and simultaneously contributed to global literary networks. In many ways, the trajectories of writers in the twentieth century opened up the form to a constellation of local and global influences. From 1926, autobiographical writing evoked the experiences of the solitary writer, the embattled critic, the revolutionary, the prisoner, the exile, and the émigré. Arab autobiography in the mid-twentieth century responded to the enduring effects of colonialism, national movements, and independence. Important political junctures in the Arab world such as the founding of Israel in 1948, the Arab–Israeli 1967 War (Six-Day War), the Lebanese civil war (1975–90), the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the 2003 US invasion of Iraq had a profound effect on the production and directions of the genre. For Arab writers, whose formation and careers spanned these major historical moments, their autobiographical production is fraught with the representation of subjectivity vis-à-vis anticolonial and anti-imperialist movements. They explored the tension between the communal and the individual in a form that was broadly conceived as the writer’s expression of subjectivity within collective struggles in the Arab world. The rise of Arabic autobiography dovetailed the private and the public, the individual and the national. Jean Franco observes that memoirs increasingly and directly address ‘unity, association, community, bonding’ and ‘solitude, fragmentation, entropy’ (Franco 2002: 78). In her reading of Pablo Neruda’s poetry and memoirs, she draws attention to autobiographical strands in his early poems ‘interwoven with accounts of solitude’ (79). Neruda’s Confieso que he vivido: Memorias (Memoirs, 1974) is framed with an epigraph: ‘In these memoirs or recollections there are gaps here and there, and sometimes they are also forgetful, because life is like that . . . Many of the things I remember have blurred as I recalled them, they have crumbled to dust, like irreparably shattered glass’ (Neruda 2001). Franco further notes that Neruda (1904–73) produced an oblique memoir, with ‘episodes that needed explanation yet could not be fully revealed’ and that the events he recounts are more of ‘publicly acceptable material’ and ‘represent the public\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 2\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 3 and authorized narrative that reveal little that is not already known’ (2002: 82–3). While Neruda offers a more public story, Gabriel García Márquez (1927–2014) recounts a comparatively solitary life in his memoir. In Vivir para contarla (Living to Tell the Tale), his 2002 memoir, García Márquez recounts his commitment to a literary life in his youth, telling his story the way he remembers his literary vocation. He writes in the epigraph: ‘Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it’ (García Márquez 2003; italics in original). García Márquez revisits the explosive world of ‘La Violencia’ in Colombia during the late 1940s and 1950s, embedding events that are ‘erased from historical memory’ (283) such as the Banana Massacre in his story.4 In chronicling his literary life, he looks at national and continental history, but recounts the story of the youthful solitary writer. The stature of writers and, in the words of Franco, the status of the writer as ‘hero’ (2002: 3) is central to the production of autobiography. Franco alludes to a Latin American culture where ‘writers pronounced on politics, revolution, and literature’ (5). Edward Said observes that the veneration of writers in all cultures endows them with a separate, special role. Importantly, Said notes ‘the special symbolic role of writers’ as defenders or chroniclers of the communal struggles of ‘emblematized regions’ (2004: 127). As Franco writes, in Latin America poets and novelists inspired how ‘literature was read, history understood, and language valued’, ‘created canons’, and evaluated contemporary culture (2002: 4). Arab writers chronicled life and experience within vast networks of cultural–historical relations; they explicitly or obliquely revisited the national landscape that shaped them. These writers influenced national culture and crossed cultural borders: Taha Hussein through his reforms for a modern, secular nation-state and his influence by European culture; Edward Said (1935–2003) through his foundation of postcolonial studies in the US; and Assia Djebar (1936–2015) through her Francophone North African literature in France. The purpose of this book is to explore the autobiographical production of revolutionary Arab writers with prominent roles in national cultures and anticolonial movements and new writers as well as the reinvention of Arab autobiography through encounters with other cultures and languages. At the same time, it examines Anglophone, Francophone, and Arabic ­autobiography\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 3\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n4 | li terary au to b io gr a ph y not only as the appropriation of a Western form but also as a form that draws on indigenous sources and responds to historical moments such as colonialism, national movements, and independence. The book explores Arab autobiography, tracing its adaptation of local forms, Western canon, and affiliations with other literatures of the global South. Autobiography enabled Arab writers to further explore the writer’s role in national culture in the twentieth-century contexts of colonialism, dispossession, and postcolonialism and to depart from the forms prevailing in Western and premodern Arabic literature. The rise of autobiography is connected to modernity, national movements, and independence and its c­ontemporary reworkings show these complex intertwinings in a new light. By focusing on anticolonial movements and the development of literary forms such as autobiography, this book examines the literary imagination of the cultural, national, and transnational roles of Arab writers during colonialism and independence. Autobiography developed and endured as a literary form throughout the twentieth century. Novelists, poets, and critics – nationalist, Westerneducated, leftist, and secular – produced Arabic, Anglophone, and Francophone autobiography in colonial, revolutionary, and postcolonial cultures. Autobiography has bridged genres and cultures from Arab medieval treatises to European autobiography to Neruda’s Memorial de Isla Negra (Isla Negra: A Notebook, 1964), a collection of autobiographical poems. In modern Arab culture, the form has persisted and evolved from the autobiography of Taha Hussein to Assia Djebar’s Francophone autobiographical novels and Mahmoud Darwish’s prose memoirs. Throughout the twentieth century, Arab writers produced autobiography during colonialism, revolution, and independence. Autobiography, a form deeply influenced by these contexts, traced developments in the Arab world from colonialism to independence through the national landscapes of the writer’s life. Moreover, the cultural role and transnational encounters of the writers further infused the form. In Egypt and Lebanon, writers such as Taha Hussein and Mikhail Nu‘aymah (Mikhaīl Nu‘aymah) (1889–1988) explored the encounter with the West throughout the colonial period. Arab writers revisited national movements that played an important role in their literary formation.\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 4\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 5 The importance of these Arab memoirs and autobiographical works rests in the transnational status of some of these writers. Some of these writers enjoyed pre-eminence on account of the translation of their autobiographical works or their Anglophone and Francophone writing. Edward Said inaugurated the field of postcolonial studies, which reformulated the study of comparative literature, and Assia Djebar was elected to the Académie Française. Literary Autobiography and Arab National Struggles explores a growing body of autobiographical literature that has rethought the relationship of writers to national cultures and languages, adapted the form, and explored colonialism. A study of twentieth- and twenty-first century Arab autobiography helps illuminate the role of the writer in the national and literary imagination. By rethinking the form within colonial encounters and national movements, Arab writers rethought the role of the writer in national culture. While reading autobiography in particular contexts embeds it in broader cultural, literary, and political landscapes, the form also stages the desire to write a life story that can be appreciated for its particularity. Autobiographical writing produced within national movements and postcolonial situations highlights the role of national culture and colonial encounters. In this context, Arab writers reworked the form to challenge autobiographical conventions and offer more indigenous reworkings of the genre in response to local historical and cultural change. There is no book-length study in any language that has employed a comparative framework across three languages to examine Arab autobi­ ography over the last half-century. Contemporary Arab memoirs written in anticolonial and anti-imperialist movements have yet to be more fully explored. Literary Autobiography and Arab National Struggles examines Arab ­autobiography in Arabic, English, and French, primarily from the second half of the twentieth century to the twenty-first century. It examines different aspects of the contemporary autobiography as it has evolved in the Arab world for more than half a century with a focus on more recent autobiographical production. By focusing on autobiography from Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, and Palestine, in Arabic, English, and French, the book examines the effects of anticolonial movements on autobiographical production. In this way, it explores the rise of contemporary Arab autobiography and the role of the Arab writer in national cultures and global networks, extending the\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 5\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n6 | li terary au to b io gr a ph y study to writers who have been influential not only in Arab culture but also in Anglophone and Francophone transnational literary circuits. The autobiographical works considered here are landmarks in contemporary Arab autobiography that problematise conventional autobiographical forms. Many of the writers have enjoyed a transnational status or crossed ­cultural borders through translation. In these autobiographical works, the writers work through introspection at important historical junctures. The study is far from exhaustive. Instead, it offers an examination of prominent and new writers, canonical and contemporary memoirs, focusing on the effects of revolutionary movements, the writer’s cultural status, and encounters with other cultures. The trajectories of Literary Autobiography and Arab National Struggles cross national, cultural, and linguistic borders. They encompass the rural village, the Azhar seminary, the prison cell, the mountains of the Algerian rebels, the Parisian apartment, the besieged apartment in Beirut, the Palestinian ancestral village, colonial Cairo, New York, the hospital room, and the square. Critics have focused on the difference between autobiography (sīra dhātīyya), a form that focuses on the development of the author’s personality, and memoir (mudhakkirāt), written at a late moment in the author’s life.5 Memoirs chronicle the context more explicitly than autobiography and examine the role of the writer in the events.6 Other Arabic terms have different associations such as ‘tarjama’ (literally, ‘translation’), ‘yawmiyyāt’ (‘diary’) (Rooke 1997: 66), and ‘sīra’ (biography of the prophet Muhammad or sīra nabawiyya). The word ‘autobiography’ encompasses broadly the autobiographical production of writers from the Arab world. For works in which the authors describe the genre, I distinguish between memoir and autobiography. Moreover, I examine paratexts and the ways in which works focus on the development of the author’s life or external events.7 Although the terms ‘autobiography’ and ‘Arab’ do not accurately capture the complexity of cultures and ethnicities in the works under consideration here because not all the works are ‘autobiography’ and not all the writers are Arab (Assia Djebar is Amazigh and Haifa Zangana is Kurdish), I employ the term ‘Arab’ to ­encompass writers from the Arab world and examine these complex belongings in each chapter. Autobiography spans memoirs, autobiographical novels, journals, notebooks, and diaries whose poetics and aesthetics each\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 6\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 7 chapter examines. The autobiographical works examined here were produced between the early twentieth century and the twenty-first and encompass a series of stages of colonisation and neocolonialism. Autobiography and the Modern Nation Arab writers promoted literary modernity in the nineteenth century by creating new literary forms. It was in the wake of the cultural movement of the Nahda (Renaissance), the Arab literary revival in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with such luminaries as Taha Hussein, that autobiography became a feature of modernity. Like the novel, autobiography served to explore the central topoi of tradition and modernity and East and West.8 The history of the rise of autobiography in the West has been the subject of much scholarly attention.9 Moreover, critics have amply noted that the prevalence of autobiography in Arabic literature is not a modern phenomenon.10 Modern Arab autobiography has drawn on Arab premodern forms such as biography (sīra), travelogues (riªla), religious tracts (Rooke 1997: 75–83; Anishchenkova 2014: 17), anecdotes (akhbār), chronicles, travelogues, and biographical dictionaries (Ostle 1998: 19). Arab writers who elaborated the form in the early and mid-twentieth century were most likely aware of a long autobiographical tradition, especially the medieval origins of the genre in Arabic. These writers would have perhaps known such classics as the spiritual and secular autobiographies of al-Ghazālī and Usāma b. Munqidh, including the travelogues of Ibn Fa∂lān on the lands of Rūs and the nomadic Turks, Andalusian traveller Ibn Jubayr (540/1145–614/1217), who writes about the East, and Jerusalemite geographer al-Mukaddasī who surveys both the extreme West and the extreme East of the Islamic world.11 Taha Hussein is widely acknowledged as the ‘father of modern Arabic autobiography’.12 The appearance of Taha Hussein’s autobiography was central to the rise of modern Arabic autobiography, not only in the way in which it produced a generation of authors who fused the genre with the conventions of the European novel (Reynolds 2001: 10), but also because of its foundation of a form that staged the encounters between European colonialism and Arab nationalism.13 Although two volumes (1929 and 1939) are set during colonial rule, volume III (serialised in 1955 and published in 1967) was written and published after independence. Early in The Days, the reformer who\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 7\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n8 | li terary au to b io gr a ph y chronicles his passage from the Egyptian village to the Sorbonne introduces the narrative of the Western-educated Arab intellectual bridging cultures, epochs, and worlds. In the second half of the twentieth century, Arab writers adapted an inherently colonial genre to re-envision subjectivity in colonial and postcolonial worlds.14 The moment of the burgeoning of the autobiographical form or sīra dhātiyya was also a context of British and French imperial domination in the Arab world. Modern Arab autobiography was concerned with the formation of modern nation-states and national history (Enderwitz 1998: 81). In this context, writers reworked existing literary forms and rethought the genre from the perspective of the colonised. Arab writers reworked a tradition of autobiographical production – sīra, chronicle, travelogue, and lyric poetry – and blurred the borders of autobiography and fiction, and problematised notions of subjectivity, creating hybrid literary genres and inventing new autobiographical forms. They further revitalised the form by elaborating postcolonial subjectivity. As a form that flourished in anticolonial movements and postcolonial cultures, autobiography was typically read as a communal form within which Arab writers framed the story of the individual at particular national and cultural moments. Postcolonial critics have focused on the enduring importance of the nation as a category in the cultural production of former colonies. Benedict Anderson argues that the nation acquired its form through print culture.15 Partha Chatterjee refutes the notion of the West supplying the forms for anticolonial nationalism to the postcolonial world and that national culture is a site of sovereignty from colonialism.16 The formation of the modern nation was central to Arab autobiographical production in the twentieth century. In many ways, anticolonial nationalisms deeply influenced Arab autobiography produced at important moments in national history. Writers involved in national movements drew on the rise of the modern nation in autobiographical writing and explored subjectivity in anticolonial movements. During colonialism and the prevalence of concerns with modernity, autobiography flourished on the Arab literary scene. It adapted to the imperatives of the context in which it was produced, particularly national movements and critical moments in the Arab world such as the loss of Palestine in 1948. While autobiography recounted the writer’s life, it\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 8\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 9 revisited important historical moments and framed the history of the writer within anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles.17 Since the 1980s, writers have produced different autobiographical forms that foreground the solitude of the writer. Palestinian writer Fadwa Tuqan (Fadwa ˝ūqān) explores the effects of a patriarchal culture on her formation, especially her journey to become a poet in Riªlah Jabalīyah, Riªlah Ía‘bah (Mountainous Journey, Difficult Journey) (translated as A Mountainous Journey: An Autobiography), her 1985 autobiography. Palestinian-Iraqi writer Jabra Ibrahim Jabra (Jabrā Ibrahīm Jabrā) wrote two memoirs on his youth in British Mandate Palestine and his life in post-World War II Iraq: al-Bi’r al-Ūlā: Fu‚ūl min Sīra Dhātiyya (The First Well: A Bethlehem Boyhood, 1987) and Shāri‘ al-Amīrāt: Fu‚ūl min Sīra Dhātiyya (Princesses’ Street: Baghdad Memories, 1994). Egyptian writer Latifa al-Zayyat (Latīfa al-Zayyāt) (1923– 96) began her memoir in the women’s prison. Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish (Mahmūd Darwīsh) (1941–2008) wrote Dhākirah li-l Nisyān (Memory for Forgetfulness, 1986), a prose memoir about the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, in exile in France. The writer’s solitude is connected in complex ways to the narrative of the modern nation. In modern Arab autobiography, subjectivity and solitude are explored in ways that focus on the relationship of the writers to the anticolonial and anti-imperialist movements in which they were involved. The word ‘solitude’ evokes seclusion, isolation, separation, or exclusion.18 The writers examined here place a greater premium on solitude by focusing on the solitary writer or self-imposed solitude. While towering writers were prominent in national culture and the public sphere, they focused on solitude at moments of deep public involvement in their autobiographical works. Taha Hussein, Sonallah Ibrahim (Íun‘ Allāh Ibrahīm), Latifa al-Zayyat, Assia Djebar, Mahmoud Darwish, Mourid Barghouti (Murīd Barghūtī), Edward Said, Haifa Zangana (Haifā’ Zangana), and Radwa Ashour (Ra∂wā ‘Ashūr) all use the word ‘solitude’ or the state in complex ways as a form of isolation and freedom that does not preclude political commitment. The book offers an examination of the development of Arab autobiography through anticolonial nationalism and postcolonialism. Colonialism, culture, and language provide important frameworks for the examination and comparison of Arab autobiography in Arabic, English, and French over the\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 9\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n10 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y last half-century. These frameworks trace the influence of anticolonial movements on the development of the genre from modernity to independence by examining the role of the writers and the forms of solitude in which they wrote, re-reading Arab autobiography through a state of revolutionary solitude, the contemplation of commitment, and independence from the state. The rise of autobiography in postcolonial cultures responded to the effects of colonialism and subverted colonial domination throughout the twentieth century. Arab autobiography produced in colonial and postcolonial cultures is characterised by cultural and historical particularity. Reworkings of the genre show networks of affiliations with other literatures, the legacy of colonialism, the centrality of nationalism, and the autonomy of the writer. Postcolonial Autobiography Literary Autobiography and Arab National Struggles explores Anglophone, Francophone, and Arabic autobiographical production by influential Arab writers whose isolation or self-imposed solitude followed a period of deep involvement in national movements at major historical moments. By examining contemporary autobiographical production through anticolonial nationalism and independence, it looks at ways in which the writers reexamine conceptions of subjectivity and the role of the writer from national movements in the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, focusing on the particularity of the genre written in different languages but pertaining to one overarching Arab culture. The book examines canonical and new Arab memoirs that have not been the subject of critical attention, tracing the range of autobiographical forms produced over the last half-century during national movements and independence. The study explores the ways in which the genre offers new perspectives on subjectivity from the second half of the twentieth century. It serves to examine the influence of anticolonial movements on the production of contemporary Arab autobiography, and to make a contribution to comparative scholarship by examining Arab adaptations of the genre, as well as the influences of a long Arab tradition and other networks of the global South. It problematises assumptions that Arab writers produced what critics have described as ‘collective autobiography’ and explores ways in which Arab autobiography has offered uniquely different readings of the legacy of colonial-\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 10\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 11 ism and postcolonial nation-states. Focusing on autobiography from Egypt, Algeria, Palestine, and Iraq, it examines reworkings of the genre by exploring the effects of anticolonial movements on autobiographical production and the role of the Arab writer in national cultures and global networks. Postcolonial literatures developed along with national movements and apart from the ‘imperial center’ (Ashcroft el al 1989: 4). In the postindependence period, writers continued to challenge colonialism through cultural production (Ashcroft et al. 1989: 6). Postcolonial autobiography created new representations of subjectivity by examining the role of the writer vis-à-vis anticolonial movements and, in postcolonial cultures, adopted languages and local sources to overturn Western conventions of the form. The work of Aimé Césaire, Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi, and Edward Said, which renewed the study of the cultural production of the formerly colonised, has opened up the study of autobiographical production during anticolonial nationalism and independence.19 The resurgence of autobiography in the era of decolonisation during the 1950s and 1960s offered responses to Western colonialism and forms of self-representation centred on the ­formation of the writer in colonial worlds. Arab writers produced forms of autobiography that challenged imperial cultural formations by chronicling the writers’ self-formation and public involvement in independence struggles. As Aijaz Ahmad observes of cultural nationalism, writing within a culture or tradition of ‘the Third World’ is ‘itself an act of anti-imperialist resistance’ (1987: 9). Postcolonial autobiography draws on local traditions and hybridises colonial and indigenous languages (Moore-Gilbert 2009: xxiii). Further, Arab autobiography shares common features with autobiographical production in other postcolonial literatures such as African and Latin American autobiography. Arab autobiography in the postindependence period revisited colonial experience and explored stages of the independent nation through its effects on the writer: for instance, Latifa al-Zayyat’s Óamlat Taftīsh: Awrāq Shakh‚iyyah (The Search: Personal Papers, 1992), Sonallah Ibrahim’s al-Tala‚‚u‚ (Stealth, 2007), and Radwa Ashour’s A†yāf (Specters, 1999) revisit the life of the writer in major historical moments in the Arab world such as anticolonial struggles, the Palestine War, and postindependence periods. While postcolonial autobiography dealt with the effects of colonialism\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 11\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n12 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y in the Arab world and offered forms of self-representation to challenge colonial and Orientalist misrepresentations, Palestinian memoirs focused on the writer’s relationship to Palestine. These memoirs dealt with the legacy of the Nakba (catastrophe), the Israeli occupation, and the segregation enforced on the Palestinian population since 1948. Writers revisited their youth in British Mandate Palestine or the effects of the loss of Palestine in 1948 and the 1967 War in memoirs such as Jabra’s The First Well, Tuqan’s A Mountainous Journey: An Autobiography, Darwish’s Memory for Forgetfulness and Jidārīyya (Mural, 1999), and Mourid Barghouti’s Ra’aytu Rāmallah (I Saw Ramallah, 1997) and Wulidtu Hunākah, Wulidtu Hunā (I Was Born There, I Was Born Here, 2009).20 By chronicling a history of dispossession in autobiography, Arab writers re-envision subjectivity through memory and rework the form. Postcolonial autobiography extends beyond monolingualism and poses the themes of language and translation. Francophone and Anglophone autobiography explores notions of hybridity, cultural translation, and postcoloniality. As Ashcroft et al. note, the ‘appropriation of language’ appeared as one of the most important features of postcolonial literatures (1989: 6). The contest between languages in the autobiographical production of the ­formerly colonised explores a history of colonial conquest. Kilito notes the hierarchy of languages: ‘Bilingualism does not evoke an image of two gladiators advancing upon each other armed with nets and tridents; rather, it suggests that one of the two combatants is already sprawled in the dust awaiting the fatal blow’ (2008: 108). Kilito outlines a contest between languages, a definition of bilingualism through violence (Hassan 2008: xvii).21 Francophone and Anglophone autobiography contravenes the conventions of the genre by infusing it with the cultures and languages of the formerly colonised. Cultural hybridity enabled writers to adapt the genre in response to colonialism and employ the ensuing metaphors of conquest and hybridisation to represent postcolonial subjectivity. Francophone and Anglophone autobiography opened up ways for the writer’s story to migrate between languages and in turn to be enriched by this migration. Education, exchange, exile, migration, and translation inform much of the autobiographical production of the twentieth century. Taha Hussein learned French, Latin, and Greek and earned a doctorate from France; Sonallah Ibrahim avidly read Arabic translations of Hemingway and\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 12\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 13 Jorge Amado in prison and later went on cultural exchanges in Berlin and Moscow; Assia Djebar attended the French Lycée in Blida and then L’Ecole Supérieure in Sévres; and Darwish moved between the Arab world, Moscow, and Paris. Language informed the autobiographical production of writers who came into contact with other languages: French for Taha Hussein and Assia Djebar; English for Edward Said; Hebrew for Darwish;22 and Kurdish for Haifa Zangana. Francophone autobiography in the Maghreb offers a rich autobiographical corpus that developed in response to French colonial rule and North African national movements. Francophone autobiography adopted local forms drawn from Arab and Amazigh culture, such as oral testimony, song, rituals, and travelogues. Francophone literature in the Maghreb created a hybridised language to challenge colonial hegemony. Thus, writers from the Maghreb reworked the language of the former coloniser to serve anticolonial ends, creating a ‘hybrid language’ or ‘linguistic métissage’ (Lionnet 1995: 13). The appropriation of the French language produced heteroglossia and hybridity in literature. Lionnet’s concept of métissage in the work of multilingual writers, ‘the layerings or stratifications of diverse language systems’ (1989: 21), focuses on multiplicity, or the interweaving of languages, and cultural hybridity. Francophone autobiography played a central role in the representation of the subjectivity of the colonised, such as Assia Djebar’s L’Amour, la fantasia (Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade, 1985) and Nulle part dans la maison de mon père (Nowhere in My Father’s House, 2007); Abdelkebir Khatibi’s La Mémoire tatouée: autobiographie d’un décolonisé (Tattooed Memory: Autobiography of a Decolonized Man, 1971) and Amour bilingue (Love in Two Languages, 1983); and the Morrocon writer Mohamed Choukri’s For Bread Alone (1973) (Le Pain nu, 1980; al-Khubz al-Óāfī, 1982). Critics have noted that African and Caribbean Francophone autobiography poses the problem of writing for a local audience or the French literary market with the latter offering a much broader readership (Sankara 2011: 7). By comparison, the case of Anglophone autobiography in the Arab world is limited but has witnessed a steady rise, especially in memoirs in the twenty-first century. Anglophone Arab memoirs include Edward Said’s Out of Place (1999b); two volumes by Jean Said Makdisi, Beirut Fragments: A War Memoir (1990) and Teta, Mother, and Me: An Arab Woman’s Memoir (2005);\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 13\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n14 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood (1995) by the Moroccan Fatima Mernissi; and, more recently, a collection of Anglophone Palestinian memoirs that has grown out of the occupation of Palestine by writers such as Palestinian lawyer Raja Shehadeh.23 Contemporary Arab autobiography, drawing on a rich heritage, local forms, and European autobiography, reworked the conventions of autobiography in a plethora of forms – autobiographical novel, memoir, journals, and epic. Mohamed Makhzangi (Muªammad Makhzanjī) revised conventional autobiographical forms in LaªaÕāt Gharaq Jazīrat al-Óūt (Memories of a Meltdown: An Egyptian Between Moscow and Chernobyl ), his 1997 memoir, or what he calls ‘anti-memoir’.24 Makhzangi relates the aftermath of the nuclear explosion of the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine in 1986 through the realism of reportage interwoven with fiction. He traces the dissolution of his dreams of Moscow while studying medicine in Kiev, his grief distilled in moments in the irradiated city. Twenty-first century memoirs offer new forms and explore the role of autobiographical production in revolutionary movements: Mona Prince’s Ismī Thawra (Revolution Is My Name: An Egyptian Woman’s Diary from Eighteen Days in Tahrir, 2012); Radwa Ashour’s Athqal min Radwā: Maqā†i‘ min Sīra Dhātiyya (Heavier Than Radwa: Fragments of an Autobiography, 2013); and a new generation of Arab-American memoirs such as Najla Said’s Looking for Palestine (2013). Chapter 1, ‘From Solitude to Stealth’, examines the foundational threevolume autobiography in Arabic literature by Egyptian reformer Taha Hussein and an autobiographical novel by Egyptian writer Sonallah Ibrahim. The two works rework the form through important historical, cultural, and literary junctures. This chapter explores the ways in which Hussein’s The Days and Ibrahim’s Stealth blur the conventional borders between fiction and autobiography. One lays down the conventions of the autobiography of childhood and the other dramatically revises the genre. By focusing on a canonical autobiography and a seemingly conventional autobiographical novel, the chapter reads the reworking of the form from the twentieth to the twenty-first centuries in parallel with national developments and through the cultural status of the writers. Chapter 2, ‘Revolutionary Memoirs’, focuses on the autobiographical novels and memoirs of two important twentieth-century Arab women\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 14\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 15 writers who provide models for the adaptation of the genre in colonial and postcolonial cultures: Fantasia: An Algerian Cavalcade and Nowhere in My Father’s House, two Francophone autobiographical novels by Algerian writer Assia Djebar, and The Search: Personal Papers, a memoir in Arabic by Egyptian writer Latifa al-Zayyat. By framing autobiographical production in anticolonial national movements, Djebar and al-Zayyat rework the genre to comment on postcolonial cultures. Both writers contest colonial formations and offer revolutionary representations of solitude in the postcolonial nation: the Francophone Algerian writer’s challenge to the French archive of the Algerian War of Independence and the Egyptian writer’s reexamination of national culture and the history of the 1940s student movement. In the chapter, solitude is read as an emancipatory opportunity when the writers rethink the language of the new nation through autobiography. Examining the two writers’ autobiography against two landmark 1960s novels, the chapter shows the effects of national movements on Djebar and alZayyat’s literary production in colonial and postcolonial Algeria and Egypt. While Djebar focuses on colonialism and her vexed relationship with the French language, al-Zayyat frames self-liberation within the broader national struggle. Both writers appropriate and remake the genre through the solitude of the writer and her representation of national history. Chapter 3, ‘Palestine Song’, explores a new form of poetic autobiography by Palestinian poets Mahmoud Darwish and Mourid Barghouti. The chapter explores the relationship of the poets to Palestine and its effects on autobiographical form in Darwish’s Memory for Forgetfulness, his 1986 memoir of the Israeli siege of Beirut, and Mural, his 1999 autobiographical epic focusing on mortality and Palestine. Barghouti’s memoirs I Saw Ramallah and I Was Born There, I Was Born Here explore the ‘solitude of exile’ (Said 2000d: 181), in the words of Edward Said, and the return of the poet to Palestine. Darwish and Barghouti rework the genre to explore the life of the poet in relation to Palestine and the tension between the poet’s solitude and his public role. Chapter 4, ‘Revolutionary Solitude’, examines Arab Anglophone memoirs by focusing on Edward Said’s Out of Place: A Memoir (1999b) and Najla Said’s Looking for Palestine: Growing Up Confused in an Arab-American Family (2013). Out of Place traces Edward Said’s cultural and literary journey\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 15\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n16 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y from Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt to his education in the US, framing the story of his life in a form of ‘revolutionary solitude’ represented by the public intellectual. Edward Said’s self-representation rests on the dichotomy of his solitude during his formation within a history of dispossession and his career. Rather than the Arab-American public intellectual, the memoir focuses on Said’s youth, chronicling his history in counterpoint to the cultural icon. The chapter rethinks Out of Place through the burgeoning of the Palestinian national movement and Said’s lifework. In the chapter, I compare Edward Said’s youth in the Arab world and Najla Said’s Arab-American background, Said’s journey to the US and his daughter’s return to her roots, to arrive at a rethinking of the genre that migrates across languages and cultures. Chapter 5, ‘Dreaming of Solitude’, concentrates on new areas of exploration of testimony and memory in unconventional forms such as the prison diary by focusing on the narration of torture in Fī Arwiqat al-Dhākirah (Dreaming of Baghdad, 1990) by Iraqi writer Haifa Zangana and the prevalence of fear in Al-Ajnabīyah (The Foreigner, 2013) by Iraqi novelist Alia Mamdouh. Dreaming of Baghdad, written in London during the 1980s, revisits Zangana’s experience of imprisonment in 1970s Iraq in complex ways. While Dreaming of Baghdad offers new forms for the exploration of the subjectivity of Iraqi revolutionary women by exploring the precariousness of memory and challenging taboos on testimony, The Foreigner subjects the subjectivity and trajectory of Iraqis in the diaspora to scrutiny, focusing on the effects of violence and the infringement of taboos. Chapter 6, ‘Tahrir Memoirs’, examines new Arab memoirs and the effects of the Arab revolutions in the twenty-first century on the genre. The genre of the Tahrir memoir, a form that focuses on subjectivity in the broader movement rather than solitude, reworks Arab memoirs in the twenty-first century. Radwa Ashour (1946–2014) and Mona Prince (Muna Brins) (b. 1970) wrote new memoirs that chronicle the writers’ involvement in Egypt’s 2011 revolution. The chapter focuses on Ashour’s Athqal min Radwā: Maqā†i‘ min Sīra Dhātiyya (Heavier than Radwa: Fragments of an Autobiography, 2013) and the posthumously published al-Íarkhah (The Scream, 2014), including al-Riªlah (The Journey, 1983) and A†yāf (Specters, 1999), with Mona Prince’s Ismī Thawra (Revolution Is My Name, 2012). Both Ashour and Prince offer a new form in which writing, activism, the university campus, and Tahrir Square\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 16\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nli terary soli tud e | 17 are deeply intertwined, with parts that focus on the writers’ medical or professional crises within Egypt’s revolution. The final chapter looks at the effects of autobiographical production in other languages and translation on the globality of national literatures and world literary study. It examines current theorisations of world literature and considers Arab autobiography within new literary systems and comparative literary studies.\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 17\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n1 From Solitude to Stealth: Taha Hussein and Sonallah Ibrahim\n\nI\n\nn 1926, during the controversy provoked by the publication of On PreIslamic Poetry, and ensuing developments, Taha Hussein retired to France where he dictated part I of his famous three-volume autobiography The Days over nine days (Hafez 2002: 10–11). Part I seems to be written in selfdefence, helping him to re-evaluate the present by revisiting his boyhood.1 Hussein, from his solitude in a village in the Haute-Savoie, traced his journey from an Upper Egyptian village to the city (and, subsequently over his trilogy, his rise to the pinnacle of Arab culture). France is emblematic of his East–West trajectory in his education, thought, and literature: he had travelled on a scholarship to France, and he would formulate an important framework by which Egypt formed part of the West and not the East in Mustaqbal al-Thaqāfah fī Mi‚r (The Future of Culture in Egypt, 1938). In part I of his autobiography, the story of his youth and his embattled public life intersected. The autobiography responded to the crisis with an exemplar of a cultural Arab hero whose growth to prominence in national culture and cultural exchange can be traced to his revolt against the traditionalism of his education. Similarly, Hussein wrote part II, The Stream of Days: A Student at the Azhar, after another crisis occasioned his dismissal from Cairo University.2 The stature of Taha Hussein and his adaptation of the genre of autobiography to chronicle his passage from the village kuttāb to a secular education have earned The Days the status of a masterwork in modern Arabic literature. The autobiography frames two important encounters that appear in other Arab autobiographical production in subtle ways: the encounter with the West (such as his predecessors’ the pre-eminent Egyptian intellectual, educator, and translator Rifā‘a Rāfi‘ al-˝ah†āwī and Lebanese writer Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq), and his encounters with the state or the establishment. Hussein\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 18\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 19 epitomised revolution in his thought and his career is marked by a series of crises.3 Not only does The Days chronicle his migration from the village to the Azhar to France, but also the movement from tradition to an Arab literary modernity influenced by secularism and the synthesis of an Arab heritage and European culture. The cultural-historical background of The Days helps contextualise the three volumes: part I (An Egyptian Childhood ) was serialised in al-Hilāl in 1926–7 and published in 1929 (Cachia 1997: 6) during the crisis in which he was embroiled; part II (The Stream of Days) appeared in 1939 in colonial Egypt; and part III (serialised in Akhir Sā‘a in 1955, printed as Mudhakkirāt Taha Hussein in 1967, and later added to The Days (A Passage to France in English)) appeared in postindependence Egypt. A Passage to France, a chronicle of his education in France and his career at the Egyptian University upon his return to Egypt, is grounded in his career-long struggle for cultural and educational reform. The Days offers a model inspired by the synthesis of an Arab heritage and Western education, scholarly freedom, and revolutionary thought.4 Critics have described The Days as ‘one of the foundations of modern Arabic literature’ (Malti-Douglas 1988: 11), ‘an important example of Third World autobiography’ (13–14), and ‘the first great classic of modern Arabic prose literature’ (Allen 1982: 566). The relationship between East and West frames and informs the foundational autobiography in Arabic letters. Fedwa Malti-Douglas observes: ‘Al-Ayyām is an important example of Third World autobiography. Not only does it articulate a vision of East and West but, more importantly, it shows the East as it comes into a special contact with the West’ (1988: 13). Taha Hussein’s autobiography synthesises Egyptian and European cultures within a movement of Arab literary revival and ­revolutionary rethinking of Arabic letters. The autobiography provides the most famous Arab model emulated in subsequent autobiographical production. It offers a model where fiction is not antithetical to autobiography, but a feature of the form (Eakin 1985: 7). Nor is it concerned with self-creation or the fictionalisation of autobiography. Rather, it lays the foundation for a form, drawn from a rich Arabic literary tradition that inspired its reworking over the past half-century. This chapter brings a contemporary autobiographical novel into conversation with\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 19\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n20 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y a famous autobiography: Stealth, a 2007 novel by Egyptian writer Sonallah Ibrahim (b. 1937), reenvisions An Egyptian Childhood. Like Hussein’s An Egyptian Childhood, Stealth focuses on the misadventures of a young boy and the ways he comes to understand his world in colonial Egypt. In contrast to An Egyptian Childhood, which details the youth’s conquest of his blindness, important scenes focus on the young narrator’s stealth, spying, or sight. While Hussein adapted a new literary form, Ibrahim infuses a modern genre with renewed narrative modes to revisit his youth and expose the parallels between a historical moment in which he grew up and a present one with which he unequivocally contends. The Fiction of Autobiography Fiction and autobiography intersect in ways that have provoked much critical attention: the relation of autobiographical form to subjectivity (Eakin 1985: 34); the role of creation and invention in autobiography;5 and the forms of autobiographical fiction and fictional autobiography in modern Arabic literature.6 The conventional borders between fiction and autobiography are tantalisingly blurred when autobiography employs the forms and conventions of the novel (295). John Paul Eakin argues that the autobiographical self is necessarily fictive and notes the interplay between the process of selfdiscovery and the art of self-invention (55). Novelists produce autobiography by re-ordering and framing experience within the form of a novel. To shape autobiographical material, they may adhere to the conventions of the novel. Memory plays an important role in the production of autobiography: the complexity, lapses, and imprecisions of memory influence the recovery and interpretation of experiences and events. The autobiographical pact (le pacte autobiographique) is central to the reception of an autobiography. Philippe Lejeune distinguishes between autobiography and fiction by identifying an autobiographical pact, the conventional agreement between the author of autobiography, who offers his statement of intention, and the reader. The autobiographical pact confirms the identity between the author, the narrator, and the character (Lejeune 1982: 193). As Lejeune notes, the autobiographical pact appears in the title, the dedication, the preface, the author’s note, or in interviews. Lejeune’s definition of autobiography depends on a set of conditions: form, the life story,\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 20\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 21 the identity between the author (whose name designates a real person) and the narrator, and retrospective narration (1989: 193). Occasionally, writers blur the borders between literary genres and contravene the convention of the autobiographical pact, when no such agreement, commentary, or paratexts (interview, title, preface, or testimony) frame the autobiography. Another form they rework is the novel of education and formation (Erziehungsroman or Bildungsroman) – examined by Bakhtin – in which a writer narrates the formative years of the protagonist (1986: 19). These writers review and rethink their youth from the vantage point of a mature narrator (or writer) who reports the adventures of a youthful character. The relationship between Bildungsroman and autobiography is central to autobiographical novels that centre on the education and youth of the writers. Moretti’s examination of the Bildungsroman ‘between two epochs’ may be adopted to illuminate Hussein’s autobiography and Ibrahim’s autobiographical novel. For Moretti, the rise of the Bildungsroman has to do with youth and modernity (2000: 5). The Days employs the conventions of the classical Bildungsroman, or what Moretti notes as the synthesis of Entwicklungsroman, or ‘novel of ‘development’’, and Erziehungsroman, or ‘novel of “education” . . . observed from the standpoint of an educator’ (16–17), through the balance between vocation and education. The synthesis of the development of personality and the process of education is prevalent in The Days in the protagonist’s learning in the kuttāb of an Upper Egyptian village, his journey to the Azhar, and passage to France. Moretti notes that the classical Bildungsroman traces the rise of the modern young hero and social change through ‘the fiction of youth’ (230). Although the classical Bildungsroman evokes the ‘tension between the individual and his world’ (23), it also traces the fulfilment of the young hero’s aspirations. The Days traces the birth of the modern autobiographical hero during cultural and political change in turnof-the-century Egypt. The form of ‘autofiction’ offers further insight into Hussein’s novelised autobiography and Ibrahim’s autobiographical novel. Coined in 1977 by Serge Doubrovsky, ‘autofiction’ evokes both autobiography and fiction, a form of the autobiographical novel, although critical debates have distinguished between autofiction, on the one hand, and autobiography, the novel, and the autobiographical novel, on the other (Bacar 2014: 178, 183).7\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 21\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n22 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y Autofiction is neither autobiography nor novel (163). Like the autobiographical novel, it is a hybrid literary form that blurs the borders between fiction and autobiography. Unlike other forms, autofiction is autobiography where the name of the narrator is different from the author (188); it offers a double pact – autobiographical and fictional; and displays autobiography and novel on the cover (407) through such subtitles as ‘sīra ruwā’iyya’ (literally, novelised autobiography). It is a form that mingles autobiography and the modes of fiction to create works that contract to be both autobiographical and fictional. Taha Hussein and Sonallah Ibrahim rework the autobiographical and fictional in an autobiography that employs the mode of fiction and an autobiographical novel, respectively. While Hussein employs third-person narration and distance from the protagonist, and other autobiographical features underline the genre of The Days, Ibrahim reworks autobiography into his novel. Hussein draws on the Erziehungsroman (novel of education) in an autobiography that closely follows his growth into an educator and reformer and traces the fulfilment of his aspirations. Ibrahim evokes his youth through his protagonist’s intimately recounted boyhood in his autobiographical novel. Whereas Hussein set the foundations of the genre in modern Arabic literature through its productive relationship to fiction, Ibrahim would go on to produce a seemingly conventional novel whose literary history and role within his oeuvre betokens a complex autobiographical corpus. The Autobiography of Youth Hussein, a revolutionary thinker in modern Arab culture, was involved in the cultural movement of the Nahda or Arab literary renaissance. He earned a traditional Azharite and European education, adopted Western ideals, and famously declared a shared heritage for Europeans and Egyptians in the form of a Mediterranean culture in The Future of Culture in Egypt by which he resituated Egypt in the West, not the East.8 One of the most important Nahda thinkers, Hussein founded the genre of autobiography in modern Arabic literature at the confluence of important cultural-historical forces in the Arab world: part I appeared when Egypt was colonised by Britain and European culture dominated the Arab world.9 Hussein reworked a form with precedents in an Arab autobiographical tradition.10 His history informs his\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 22\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 23 adaptation of the genre: his migration from the village to Cairo, his criticism of the conservatism of the Azhar, his education in France, and his conception of Egypt within a cultural framework shared with the cultures of the Mediterranean. Although part I returns to the nineteenth century during the British colonisation of Egypt (1882–1952), it does not directly engage with colonialism. Rather, it delineates the forces of tradition and ignorance that profoundly changed the life of the young boy who was blinded from the age of two by the treatment of a local barber. From 1932 to 1952, plagued by party politics and dismissed from the university by the government in 1932 (he would return to the post of Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1936), Hussein obliquely directed his criticism of the government in his literary production (Cachia 1956: 65–6). The conventions of the Bildungsroman pervade the story of his boyhood and youth in an Upper Egyptian village and his formation at the Azhar. An Egyptian Childhood focuses on the solitude of a young blind village boy at the turn of the twentieth century. In volume I, Hussein narrates his formation in the Upper Egyptian village of Izbit al-Kīlū near the town of Maghāgha in poverty (Cachia 1997: 3), framing the story of his youth in the backwardness of the village. In one of the most widely quoted scenes in modern Arabic literature, a mature narrator, distant, detached, and ironic, commences the story with his evocation of a young boy who ‘cannot remember’ the day, but recalls a spot by the fence where he would contemplate and enjoy the recitations of a poet. The fence is symbolic of the boundary between his house in the village and the world, which he would cross with his journey to the Azhar. In An Egyptian Childhood, the young boy is deeply aware of his blindness and his sense of isolation in an Upper Egyptian village and, in The Stream of Days, he suffers solitude in the dormitory at the Azhar seminary.11 Early in An Egyptian Childhood, blindness is conjured in his sense of the soft light, the sensation of a cool breeze, the hushed movements in his surroundings, and the euphonious song of a poet; when his mother pours a liquid in his ‘poor weak eyes’; and when his father entrusts him with prayers because he is a young boy and blind and thus favoured ‘in the sight of God’: ‘How could God be pleased to turn a deaf ear to a blind lad’ (A1, 102; EC, 62). The English translation offers the play on the words ‘deaf’ and ‘blind’ while the Arabic only alludes to the blind boy: ‘sabiyyan makfufan’. He learns of his\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 23\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n24 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y infirmity when he hears his siblings describe sights of which he had no knowledge: ‘Then he knew that they saw what he did not see’ (A1, 18; EC, 16). The youth apprehends his world in The Days through auditory experience. While he feels the play of light and the outlines of the fence, he would strain his ears in his surroundings. An Egyptian Childhood abounds with recitation and the imagination: the Qur’an he recites; poetry to which he listens in the kuttāb; folktales; Sufi rituals in which he partakes; the sound and movement of his dying sister (for whom no one summons a doctor) as well as his mother’s bereavement; and the sound of his elder brother’s sickness – his groans, and silence when he is afflicted with cholera, while the young protagonist, isolated, ‘silent’, and ‘downcast’ rests in a corner of the room; and the preacher’s sermons at the Azhar. Hussein offers no conventional autobiographical pact that may identify the narrator by the author’s name in volume I.12 The narrator goes on to challenge the conception of his story as an ‘example’ or ‘model’ of the ‘noblest of men’ (and children) to be emulated (A1, 145; EC, 84). Rather, by the volume’s end, the narrator offers a model of a fate he has laboured to spare his daughter. Malti-Douglas draws attention to a doubling and distancing produced by third-person narration (1988: 100). As Lejeune notes, autobiography ‘in the third person’ draws attention to an indirect character or a ‘figurative narrator’ (1989: 35), an observation that pertains to The Days. While autobiography is ‘autodiegetic’, the third person creates a ‘distancing’ to ‘express an articulation (a tension) between identity and difference’ (36). Lejeune notes that the alternations ‘in which contemporary autobiographers indulge are the timid echo of the investigations of modern novelists into narrative voice and focalization’ (37). In this sense, Hussein’s alternation between the third person and autodiegetic narration or the split of the narrator ‘produces an effect of unvoicing and of stepping back (an effect whose functions can be very diverse: protection, self-irony, solemnity)’ (39). The enunciation ‘splits’ or ‘distances’, producing an effect by which autobiography is read ‘from the perspective of the convention that it violates’ (42). In the case of The Days, to use Lejeune’s reasoning, the title and history of the autobiography impose an autobiographical interpretation. The alternation between the first and third person, although often unobtrusive, may be seen to create the effect of distance, repudiation, or modesty.\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 24\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 25 By An Egyptian Childhood’s end, the narrator notes to his daughter: ‘He [her father, the youth] was conspicuous for all this [his poverty], but nevertheless pleasing to the eye when its gaze fell on him, notwithstanding his ragged state and sightless eyes’ (EC, 86). The Arabic clearly imparts the pronounced appearance of his poverty: ‘taqtaªimahu al-‘ayn iqtiªaman’ (A1, 148) is rendered into ‘Indeed he was conspicuous’ (EC, 85), thereby removing the connotation of the eye’s aversion to his dirty cloak, an allusion to the ‘eye’ that recurs three times in the same passage. Here ‘taqtaªimahu al-‘ayn wa lakinaha tabtasim lahu’ (A1, 149) is rendered thus: ‘He was conspicuous but pleasing to the eye’ (EC, 86). The emphasis on ‘the eye’, a prominent allusion in the chapter, is part of the evocation of sight and sightlessness. The conflation of narrator and protagonist in this passage gestures to his present state: how he passed from poverty to prominence and what he provoked in the way of ‘envy, hatred and malice’ and earned by way of ‘approval, respect and encouragement’ (EC, 87). In this passage, the narrator imparts to his daughter his identity with the young boy as well as his blindness and his poverty and offers the insight of the mature narrator. In The Stream of Days, the narrator’s father sends him to study in the Azhar seminary in his brother’s charge. The second volume details the young boy’s education, solitary life in Cairo, and frustration with the conservatism of the Azhar. Pierre Cachia notes his experience of ‘solitude’ in his early months at the Azhar (1956: 47), a state furthered by his criticism of the Azhar’s traditionalism. The second volume, penned in Vic-sur-Cère during July and August 1939, opens with the imagination frequently evoked in volume I: ‘It was more by imagination than by sense that he distinguished the three phases of his day’ (SD, 105) – his room; the journey between his lodging and the Azhar; and the courtyard of the Azhar. On his way from the Azhar to his lodging, he has to pass through a narrow passage-way, assailed by odours and attentive to sounds, feel his way forward and then turn up a staircase. In his room in Cairo, he would fall to an ‘intolerable solitude’ (SD, 131); when his cousin comes up to the Azhar to keep him company, his ‘solitude’ (‘uzla) (A2, 109; SD, 178) ends, so much so that he sometimes longs for it, and he returns to his solitude at the Azhar and in the tenement when his cousin matriculates at Dār al-‘Ulūm and feels ‘condemned once more to the\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 25\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n26 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y stony solitude which long before in the first months of his life as a student had caused him so much suffering’ (A2, 180; SD, 230). The Stream of Days traces the young Azharite’s revolt against the Azhar. The author frames the chronicle of his education at the Azhar within the old and the new. The Stream of Days ends with his break with the Azhar; while he was enrolled at the Azhar, he began to frequent the Egyptian University and thus came to lead a ‘double life’ between ‘the old world of the Azhar’ and ‘the new world of the University’ (A2, 183; SD, 232), a doubleness that would characterise his oscillation between the old and the new, the conservatism of the Azhar and the secularism and humanism of the modern university. The final volume, Memoirs (1967), republished six months before his death in October 1973 (Cragg 1997: 241) as part of the trilogy, enshrines his formation and education within the birth of the modern university, the pursuit of academic freedom, and the Egyptian–European encounter. The final volume chronicles his passage to France on a scholarship for doctoral study at the Sorbonne. Before France, in 1908 he enrolled at the newly established Egyptian University, where he was introduced to Western culture. On his return from France, he would be appointed a professor of ancient history at Cairo University, where his legendary lectures and subsequently his revolutionary thought would court controversy. In France, he encounters a new education and languages (French and Latin) that differ from his learning of the Qur’an at the village kuttāb and his education at the Azhar. A reader, metonymically described as ‘the sweet voice’ (A3, 87; PF, 330), the woman who was eyes to him, later his fiancée and wife, reads to him. When he is encouraged to learn writing for the blind, he finds it difficult and uncongenial because he was accustomed to acquiring knowledge through his ears and reasons that it was more suitable to learn through his hearing. Throughout his education, he is unaware of others’ signs; he notes that people are ‘those whose voices he heard, and some of whose movements he felt, but he did not see them or know what lay behind these voices he heard and movements he felt’ (A3, 114). Politics creeps into volume III when he lampoons the sheikhs for their conservatism, servility to the Khedive, and co-operation with the British. This is the only volume in which he slips in a barb at British colonial rule. With the end of World War I comes ‘the news that Egypt was seeking inde-\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 26\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 27 pendence from the victorious occupying power’ (A3, 137; PF, 378). Taha Hussein and Egyptian students abroad are full of aspirations and dreams of revolution: ‘Our friend was given to solitude and rarely mingled with his fellow Egyptian students. Now he began to meet with them frequently and to engage with them in conversations about the revolution and revolutionaries’ (A3, 137–8).13 The events inspire him to complete his doctoral study to return to Egypt: ‘Who knows? He might be able to play some part insofar as he is able to’ (A3, 138). On his return, he notes his national aspirations and the revolution that rose in Egypt in 1919: ‘It was little wonder that our friend returned to his country, believing in the revolution that had risen in it, and believing, too, that a large measure of the burdens of this revolution would fall upon the educated and the intellectuals of the country . . . they were able to lead the people forward’ (A3, 158). A national struggle and controversy bring the volume to a close: in the wake of the 1922 Declaration, which granted Egypt nominal independence, he is keen to fan the flames of revolution because of his conviction that this would grow into a full-fledged independence from the British, and he would go on to advocate a democratic constitution that would make him fall out of favour with the Palace. Caught between the supporters of Sa‘d Zaghlūl and the Palace, he notes: ‘Thus our friend was up to his ears in politics’ (A3, 163). Thereafter he would go on to reap the fruits of his entry into national politics. The foundational Arab autobiography chronicles the rise to prominence from poverty, tradition, and blindness. The Days adheres to three important landmarks in Taha Hussein’s trajectory: his education in the village, his departure to the Azhar, and his encounter with the West. His revolutionary thought and reform of education, language, and culture underwrite the solitude prevalent in his autobiography, but not in his public involvement as reformer, educator, and intellectual. Solitude and Stealth The status and experiences of Taha Hussein and Sonallah Ibrahim are markedly different: they have made different contributions to Arab literary and political culture; Hussein, a reformer and educator, holds a revered status in the highest levels of Egyptian culture while Ibrahim has long held a special role characterised by his independence on the Egyptian cultural scene, and\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 27\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n28 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y both writers produced autobiographical examinations of rural and urban boyhoods, respectively. Nonetheless, a comparison between The Days and Stealth reveals some important similarities between the two writers: they struggled for independence from institutions and the state, adopted positions that were at odds with the establishment, and went through major political and cultural crises. They were deeply marked by contact and exchange with Europe: Hussein by his contact with French culture and Ibrahim by his cultural exchange in East Germany and the Soviet Union, including his reading of American, Latin American, and Russian literature in prison. Hussein worked to reform education and culture in Egypt; Ibrahim revitalised Arabic literature with innovative modern novels. Moreover, Hussein reoriented culture towards a literary modernity and Ibrahim produced a modern literary corpus. The Days offers the model of an original autobiography, whose protagonist is blind and solitary, and Ibrahim appropriates that model by focusing on a young narrator whose spying and stealth are diametrically opposed to his literary antecedent. Ibrahim rose to prominence on the Egyptian literary scene with the publication of That Smell (Tilka al-Rā’iªa), his 1966 semi-autobiographical novella. Ibrahim was a revolutionary, who served most of a seven-year sentence for his activity in the Communist Party in 1959 and was released in an amnesty granted in 1964.14 Although Ibrahim is an emblem of the independent, solitary, and ascetic writer, he has been deeply committed to national and anti-imperialist movements. Richard Jacquemond notes that he ‘has always been at the limit of what can be tolerated by the various censorship authorities’, represents the ideal of ‘fusing purity with commitment’, and enjoys pre-eminence within ‘the consecrated avant-garde’ (2008: 258–9). In That Smell, the narrator, like his author, a prisoner just released from prison, has to transact new relationships to the city. He circles around the city on the tram and returns to his flat at dusk to report to a policeman and sign his notebook. Little happens in That Smell: his failure to write, the curfew, impotence, and defeats punctuate the novel. The reception of That Smell was incendiary largely because it explicitly presented sexuality but most likely because it plumbed the depths of a general state of stagnation. Hoda Elsadda reads That Smell as the novel that ‘inaugurates the character of the ineffectual, impotent male’ and the modern ‘defeated antihero’ who has lost his revolu-\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 28\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 29 tionary fervour and national dreams (2012: 124, 138) and Paul Starkey reads the narrator as a model for an ‘anti-hero’ who recurs in most of Ibrahim’s novels (2016: 41).15 In the late 1960s, Ibrahim performed a revolution of literary style in That Smell: a statement signed by his friends Kamāl al-Qilish, Ra’ūf Mos‘ad, and Abdel Óakīm Qāsim (his co-prisoners in al-Wāªāt prison) declared the novel an expression of ‘the experience of a generation’ in the introduction: A generation born in the shadow of monarchy and feudalism, that went out marching to demand the fall of the King and the British, and that embraced the July Revolution with words and deeds. A generation that has witnessed the collapse of monarchy and capitalism and the construction of socialism – all this in a few short years. A rich and profound experience, full of contradictions and crises, a growing sense of self and knowledge of self. All this requires serious, courageous expression to articulate these experiences creatively and innovatively. (TR, 18; TS, 73)16\n\nThe 1986 introduction to the complete edition of That Smell proclaims his nationalism and his doubts about the production of a novel that is critical of the nation in the context of anti-imperialist movements: ‘The Arab nation, with Egypt in the vanguard, was indeed in a dogfight with American imperialism and its Zionist stepdaughter, not to mention Arab conservatives. So it was natural for me to wonder whether I wasn’t harming the country by publishing my work under such conditions’ (TR, 19; TS, 74). Samia Mehrez, in her examination of the history of the production of That Smell and Ibrahim’s introduction, notes his guilt towards the regime ‘whose struggle and sacrifice he had respected’ (1994: 122) by publishing a novel that was critical during the rise of Arab nationalism and the challenge to imperialism and Zionism (122–3).17 The introduction proclaims: ‘Rebellion was the spirit of the age, after all’, inspiring the explosion of ‘conventional forms’ (TR, 13; TS, 69).18 Youssef Idris called That Smell a revolution (thawra) ‘of an artist against himself’ (1986: 29). The publication of That Smell established Ibrahim’s status as a revolutionary and an iconoclast known for his independence from the Egyptian literary establishment. That Smell contains asides on the narrator’s work on a novel whose description closely resembles Stealth. Although Stealth appeared much later,\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 29\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n30 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y the novel can be read as a preliminary to That Smell and Notes from Prison (Yawmiyyāt al-Wāªāt) (literally, Notes from the Oases Prison), a memoir based on Ibrahim’s prison experience (1959–64). After the narrator wanders around Cairo on the tram, visits relatives and his co-prisoner’s wife, returns to his apartment to report to a policeman, and attempts to write, he resumes another novel he had commenced in prison, which continues to exert an influence on him. As the introduction comments on the writing of That Smell: When I wrote That Smell, I had just gotten out of prison and was under house arrest, which required me to be at home from dusk to dawn. I spent the rest of the day getting to know the world I’d been away from for more than five years. As soon as I was back in my room, I rushed to record, in quick sketches, all those events and sights that had made an impression on me, that seemed to me completely out of the ordinary. Then I would put the diaries aside and get back to the novel I’d begun in prison, a novel of childhood. (TR, 12–13; TS, 68)\n\nStealth, a novel he wrote secretly in prison and shaped amid interruptions by the policeman’s visits and his failure to write under house arrest, rests within That Smell. Although That Smell abounds in interruptions and non-action – the policeman’s visits, reveries, smoking – it is suggested that the narrator has resumed a novel of childhood. In his 1986 introduction, Ibrahim admits that he had begun to leaf through the drafts of a ‘still unfinished novel of childhood’ in the room he rented after his release from prison, ‘asking myself what the point was of writing something that didn’t engage the struggle against imperialism, the effort to build socialism’ and the problems of ‘terror, torture, prison, death’ (TR, 15; TS, 70). Ibrahim’s admissions express the unease with the genre of autobiography in the Arab world because the focus on subjectivity appears to preclude commitment to public roles and national movements. By contrast, politics pervades the novella: the police officer, the train bearing troops from Yemen, the surveillance of the narrator, and the arrest of the narrator on his release from prison all contribute to the politically charged atmosphere. Notes from Prison (henceforth Notes), his 2004 memoir, recounts the story of the years he spent in prison through a diary (1962–4).19 Ibrahim wrote his\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 30\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 31 memoirs in prison and transferred his secret notebooks to cigarette paper and had them transported out of prison in November 1963. Notes is a series of journal entries written in his last two years in al-Wāªāt prison camp in the Western Desert (1962–4). Part prison notebook and part creative work, the memoir includes notes on the formation of the writer, observations, excerpts from books, historical commentary, and reflections on Soviet, American, and Latin American literature.20 Ibrahim’s prison notebooks, in which he adopts Hemingway’s objective reportorial style discovered in prison, anticipate his signature style employed in his autobiographical novel. Stealth can be read as the novel of childhood to which Ibrahim alludes as the novel he began in prison. It tells the story of a young boy and his elderly father, Khalil Bey, a retired army officer, who live on his meagre pension in middle-class poverty. The young narrator explores his world by spying and eavesdropping on other characters (maids, tenants, neighbours, sister, brother-in-law, parents) but is often unaware of the implications of conversations, scenes, and memories. Like That Smell, he goes on a series of visits with his father throughout the novel to relatives, the coffeehouse, and the grocer and stays in the flat. Mostly the knowledge he accumulates eludes him: the history of his father’s marriage to his mother, a younger woman whom he loved; his mother’s psychological breakdown; and his father’s need for female companionship. Stealth plots a parallel between the early twenty-first century in which the novel appeared and mid-twentieth-century Egypt in which it is set (Ibrahim 2011b). Ibrahim returns to Stealth to resume the novel of childhood he began in prison and under house arrest. His challenges to colonialism and the state appear in two important historical moments that he reads in counterpoint: 1940s Egypt characterised by discontent with the monarchy, defeat in the Palestine War in 1948, and the decline of the middle class, on the one hand, and corruption and disenfranchisement in the early twenty-first century, on the other.21 Stealth narrates the boyhood of the writer, offering the story underlying Notes and That Smell. At the moment that Ibrahim completed his autobiographical novel, he had been involved in a recent crisis on the Egyptian literary scene that preserved his independence from state cultural institutions.22 The literary and cultural landscape in which Ibrahim wrote Stealth is telling. On 22 October\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 31\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n32 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y 2003, Ibrahim was awarded the Arab Novel Award by the Egyptian Higher Council for Culture at the Second Cairo Conference on the Arab Novel whose panel of judges honoured his ideals: asceticism, independence, ethics, and national commitment.23 In a climactic speech, Ibrahim declined the state prize and excoriated the Mubarak regime.24 The appearance of Stealth can be read in the context in which he declined the award – the story of his boyhood against his public confirmation of his freedom and independence from the state. Importantly, Ibrahim’s subsequent works confirm a commitment to autobiographical literature: Amrikanli, a 2003 novel inspired by his visiting professorship at the University of California, Berkeley;25 his 2004 memoir Notes from Prison; and the 2007 Stealth. Notes and Stealth fall into the genre of memoir and autobiography and, in a sense, represent an autobiographical project that is coterminous with his public encounters with state cultural formations. Stealth followed Notes, unconventionally revisiting his boyhood in a context in which Ibrahim declined a prestigious state prize, thereby confirming his autonomy and his stature on the Arab literary scene. Ibrahim extends and rethinks the autobiographical tradition formed by Taha Hussein’s autobiography in modern Arabic literature. Ibrahim maintains that Stealth is not an autobiography, but fiction inspired by memory (Ibrahim 2013b). Nonetheless, there is evidence that Stealth is autobiographical: That Smell, Notes from Prison, and Stealth contain references to his mother and a novel of childhood. Ibrahim does not adhere to Lejeune’s autobiographical pact and the character is unnamed in Stealth. Nor are there authorial interventions or an introduction framing Stealth as autobiography. Nonetheless, the Arabic edition (and the first edition of the English translation) features on its cover a family photograph of a young boy and a suited father. In Stealth, the young boy looks at a postcard-sized photograph in his father’s room: The other picture has my father sitting wearing a fez and a tie. Between his knees a small child wearing a two-piece shorts suit is standing. Its first piece starts at the neck, and its second goes all the way down to the knees. The picture is in black and white, except for the child’s clothes. The suit is a blue-green color with two yellow stripes around the wrists and around the\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 32\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\nt aha hussei n a nd sonall a h ib r a h im | 33 waist. On the back there’s my name and father’s name too. The handwriting is my mother’s. (T, 77; Sb, 52)26\n\nOther autobiographical allusions appear in paratexts: interviews, novels, and memoirs.27 His statements about Stealth, therefore, both confirm and unsettle its autobiographical status. Although Ibrahim breaks with the conventions of autobiography in That Smell, Stealth appears to be comparatively conventional. It departs from the iconoclasm of Dhāt (Zaat), his 1992 postmodern novel of the 1970s culture of post-Open-Door (infitāª) consumerism. The writer challenges himself by departing from the postmodern style characteristic of his other novels and reworking the conventions of autobiography with the unconventional autobiographical representation of stealth and sparse language, a rupture with rhetorical prose that departs from the lyrical style characteristic of the highbrow Arabic prose of Taha Hussein. Ibrahim’s quotation of a phrase by Hemingway, underlined in his prison diary in his notes on Hemingway’s The Green Hills of Africa, helps to frame his autobiographical novel Stealth. The Arabic translation of the English ‘But you ought to always write it to try to get it stated’ reads: ‘Uktub, uthbit ma tarāhu wa-ma tasma‘uhu’ (‘Write, set down what you see and hear’) (YW, 95; NP, 90).28 In Stealth, Ibrahim literally adheres to Hemingway’s dictum and sets down what the narrator sees and hears. The reader reads the implications of what the narrator sees and hears in the world of the novel. The young narrator’s observations and experiences offer deep insights into his relationship to his father and the absence of his mother. The young narrator understands his world through what he sees and hears in a novel whose title in Arabic, altala‚‚u‚, means ‘spying’ or ‘eavesdropping’. The word ‘stealth’ in the English translation denotes ‘secrecy’, ‘furtiveness’, and ‘voyeurism’, but also connotes furtive actions by the state in an evocation of the surveillance prevalent in That Smell.29 In contrast to An Egyptian Childhood, where the character remembers the play of light on the fence in front of his house in the village and contemplates the day, Stealth commences with the narrator walking with his father in an alley (ªāra) at dusk. Unlike That Smell, where the narrator walks out of prison and has nowhere to go upon his release, the young narrator in Stealth holds\n\nNASSER 9781474420228 PRINT.indd 33\n\n12/05/2017 10:38\n\n34 | li tera ry au to b io gr a ph y his father’s hand as they pass through the alley of a working-class district to which they have just moved, pass the café, the grocer’s, the butcher’s shop, and the shoe shiner, and head by tram to Midan al-Sayyeda where his father sells his pocketwatch. Stealth begins: ‘My father stops for a second at the door to the house before we step into the alley’ (T, 7; Sb, 7).30 The young narrator evokes his father of whom the narrator-prisoner dreams, walking and embracing him, seeming ‘strong’ and ‘solid’, and complaining about last year’s troubles in Notes from Prison (YW, 114; NP, 94). The young narrator evokes the squalor of the family’s room, the challenges his father faces to live on a modest pension, and the memory of his mother in Stealth. The city seethes on the eve of King Farouk’s birthday and the founding of Israel in 1948. The narrator reports conversations that reflect the disaffection in Egypt where a wave of strikes and protests has spread under the monarchy and British colonial rule. Such conversations between his father and his circle in the coffeehouse highlight rising national tensions in 1948 that would parallel the regional catastrophe experienced with the loss of Palestine. Khalil Bey, asked if he would like to contribute a piastre with the rest of the group to buy the daily newspaper al-Ahrām for a month, observes: ‘anyway, today’s news is the same as yesterday’s’ (T, 52; Sb, 36). The response of the young lawyer Refaat Effendi in sheikh Abdel ‘Alim’s shop, where a picture of the King hangs on the wall, captures the political landscape of the narrator’s boyhood: You can say that again. Look at the story today about the Yemeni Jews and how the English are smuggling them into Palestine. Ever since the partition, s"
