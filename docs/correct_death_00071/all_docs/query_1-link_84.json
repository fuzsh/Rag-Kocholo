Nasser became leader of Egypt in 1954 and subsequently negotiated an end to Britain’s 72-year occupation of Egypt. Nasser was elected president of Egypt in 1956 and remained in office until his death in 1970. His accomplishments included the construction of the Aswan High Dam, the institution of land reforms and a program of industrialization, and the restoration of Egyptian self-government. Nasser also pursued policies of Arab unity and socialism."
