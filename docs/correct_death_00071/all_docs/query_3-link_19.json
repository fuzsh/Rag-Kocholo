        "text": "Fifty years ago, war broke out between Israel and its neighbours. The conflict lasted just six days but its effect would last to the present day.\n\nAt the end of 1948, Israel's Arab neighbours had invaded to try to destroy the new state, and failed. The Egyptian army had been beaten, but a force surrounded in a piece of land known as the Falluja pocket refused to surrender.\n\nA group of young Egyptian and Israeli officers tried to break the impasse. Among them was Yitzhak Rabin, a 26-year-old Israeli military prodigy who was head of operations on the southern front, and the 30-year-old Egyptian Major Gamal Abdel Nasser.\n\nJust a few years after the Nazis had killed six million Jews, the dream of establishing a state in their biblical homeland had come true.\n\nPalestinians call 1948 \"al-Nakba\", or \"the Catastrophe\". Up to 750,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the land that became Israel, and were never allowed back.\n\nFor the Arabs, defeat at the hands of the fledgling Israeli state was a seismic political moment that led to years of upheaval.\n\nEgypt was an ancient country without the sense of insecurity that underlay Israel's swagger. Amer's most important mission, which he did very well, was to make sure that the army stayed loyal by stamping out plots and keeping the officer corps happy. The military arts were much less of a priority.\n\nBy 1967, Egypt was bogged down in a war in Yemen that had become its own Vietnam. It had not fought well. But Nasser could not replace Amer with a better soldier.\n\nThe Syrian army was equally politicised, and like Egypt was a client of the Soviet Union. A series of generals were rotated into power by a series of coups d'Ã©tat.\n\nArabs talked a lot about unity, socialism and nationalism, but in reality they were deeply disunited. The Syrian and Egyptian leaderships fretted about plots allegedly instigated by the monarchies in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Kings worried that the military populists who led Syria and Egypt would incite revolution.\n\nJordan's ruler, King Hussein, was a close ally of Britain and the US. Jordan was the only Arab state that emerged from 1948 as a winner.\n\nA big Israeli raid into the Jordanian-occupied West Bank targeting the village of Samua in November 1966, followed a land mine attack inside Israel.\n\nThe raid caused uproar among Palestinians in the West Bank. Hussein was aghast. He told the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that for three years he had been in secret talks with Israel; his Israeli contacts had sent him assurances there would be no reprisals on the morning of the raid.\n\nThe Americans were sympathetic. They supported a resolution at the UN Security Council condemning the Samua raid.\n\nHussein imposed martial law on the West Bank and became more convinced than ever that his throne was in jeopardy, and that he could be overthrown by angry Palestinians. He feared a coup by radical pro-Nasser officers in the army that Israel could use as a pretext to swallow the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nThe king did not want to share the fate of the other Hashemite monarch in the Middle East, his cousin and friend King Faisal of Iraq. He had been shot in the yard of his palace in a military coup in 1958.\n\nThe march to war continued with escalating trouble on the Israel-Syrian border. Unlike Hussein, who the Americans believed was doing all he could to stop Palestinian infiltration, Syria actively encouraged it; Israel was pushing its claims to disputed territory in the border area aggressively by cultivating fields in demilitarised areas with armoured tractors.\n\nIt came to a head with a full-scale air and artillery battle between Israel and Syria on 7 April, 1967. Israel routed the Syrians.\n\nThe next morning young Palestinians in Jerusalem, according to British diplomats, showed \"a stunned awe at the Israeli competence and Arab helplessness in the face of it\" and they asked \"where were the Egyptians?\" Pressure was growing on Nasser to add action to his talk.\n\nIsrael basked in a mood of national self-congratulation. But some elder statesmen and soldiers were alarmed. In a corridor in the Israeli parliament (the Knesset), the military's former chief-of-staff Moshe Dayan bumped into General Ezer Weizmann, the former head of the air force and now Rabin's number two. \"Are you out of your minds?\" Dayan said. \"You're leading the country to war!\"\n\nSyria, and the Palestinian guerrillas it sponsored, tried even harder to provoke the Israelis, who obliged them by rising to every provocation.\n\nIt looked to Syria and Egypt, as well as to Britain and the US, that Israel was planning a bigger move.\n\nAn exaggerated news agency report, quoting \"a high Israeli source\" said that Israel \"would take limited military action designed to topple the Damascus army regime if Syrian terrorists continued sabotage raids inside Israel\".\n\nThe source was Brigadier General Aharon Yariv, the head of military intelligence. He mentioned toppling the regime only as the most extreme of a range of possibilities. But the report was taken seriously in Syria - and also in the Israeli press.\n\nThen an intervention by the Soviet Union changed everything. On 13 May, Moscow delivered a warning to Cairo that Israel was massing troops on the border with Syria and would attack within a week.\n\nWhy exactly the Soviet Union fired the starting pistol for war has been debated ever since. Two Israeli historians, Isabella Ginor and Gideon Remez, argue that the USSR deliberately instigated the crisis; they say it wanted to block Israel's nuclear weapons plans; and that the Soviets were ready to commit their own forces to the fight.\n\nAt the time a \"medium-level\" Soviet official told the CIA that the Soviet Union was stirring up the Arabs to try to make trouble for the US. With the big problems in Vietnam, another war in the Middle East would be an even worse headache.\n\nIn 1967 neither Israel nor its Arab neighbours needed much encouragement. They plunged straight into the crisis that they had all expected for years.\n\nThe Israeli army, still obsessed with Syria, was much more patient with Egypt at first.\n\nShlomo Gazit, who was head of analysis in military intelligence, told American diplomats that Israel had been taken by surprise by Egypt's belligerency, but it was \"an elaborate charade\", that would only get serious if Egypt blockaded the port of Eilat on the Red Sea by closing the Straits of Tiran.\n\nThe mood was whipped up by Nasser's ubiquitous radio station, Sawt al-Arab, the Voice of the Arabs.\n\nBroadcasting from Cairo to the rest of the Middle East, it was a vital tool of Nasser's foreign policy. Throughout the crisis, its chief announcer, Ahmed Said, read out a series of blood-curdling threats to Israel.\n\nThe Israelis did not call Nasser's bluff when he threw out the UN peacekeepers and sent more troops into the Sinai. So he doubled the stakes.\n\nOn 22 May, he banned Israeli shipping from the Straits of Tiran, the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba, effectively re-imposing the blockade of the port of Eilat that had been lifted in 1956.\n\nAt an airbase in the Sinai desert Nasser announced: \"If Israel wishes to threaten war, we tell her, you are welcome.\" A photo shows Nasser, looking as debonair as ever, surrounded by happy young flyers. Smiles flashed across the grainy black and white still.\n\nThe image Nasser desired was pumped around the world - the leader of the Arabs challenging the Jewish state, surrounded by the symbols of a modern fighting force - jet pilots - ready for action. Nasser looks excited, almost like a child intoxicated by the enormity of the line he had just crossed.\n\nThe day after Nasser closed the Straits, the Israeli prime minister, Levi Eshkol, and the cabinet ordered a full mobilisation. In 48 hours, 250,000 men could be put into the field. After compulsory military service, all Israeli men were allocated to a reserve unit.\n\nIn a couple of days, most Israeli men under the age of 50 were in some sort of military uniform.\n\nThe pressure was crushing General Rabin. Against all the military evidence, he had convinced himself that he was leading Israel to catastrophe. Rabin smoked pack after pack of cigarettes and eventually suffered a nervous collapse.\n\nHe slept for nearly 24 hours, recovered himself, and went back to work.\n\nInternational diplomacy attempted to settle the crisis before it descended into full-scale war. Israel's foreign minister, Abba Eban, flew to Washington for an urgent meeting with President Johnson.\n\nIn 1956, when Israel attacked Egypt as part of a secret agreement with Britain and France, the Americans branded Israel an aggressor, and forced it to pull out of the land it conquered. This time Eban wanted Johnson's consent for Israel's fight.\n\nThe US president warned Israel not to fire the first shot. He told Eban not to worry about an Egyptian attack. It wasn't imminent and if it came \"you'll whip the hell out of them\".\n\nFor Hussein it all came down to survival. He decided on reconciliation with Nasser. He believed that if he stayed out of the war \"an eruption\" among his Palestinian subjects might cause his regime to collapse. If he fought, Egyptian air cover might delay Israel's advance into the West Bank long enough for the UN to impose a ceasefire.\n\nOn 30 May, King Hussein flew to Cairo and did the deal. When he returned to Amman deliriously happy crowds tried to lift up his Mercedes so they could carry it back to the palace. Hussein was not deluded. The crowds loved him because Nasser had accepted him, not the other way around.\n\nLater he told the historian Avi Shlaim: \"I knew that war was inevitable. I knew that we were going to lose. I knew that we in Jordan were threatened, threatened by two things: we either followed the course we did, or alternatively the country could tear itself apart if we stayed out.\"\n\nThe government stockpiled coffins; rabbis consecrated parks as emergency cemeteries; tens of thousands of pints of blood were donated.\n\nThe mood was not helped when Prime Minister Levi Eshkol made a disastrous broadcast to the nation on 28 May. He stammered and fluffed his way through it.\n\nAt a meeting afterwards Israel's generals gave him a vicious dressing-down. Among many interventions, Brig Gen Ariel Sharon raged \"we have removed our principal weapon, fear of us\".\n\nSeveral of the commanders used aggressive, highly pejorative language comparing the government to Jewish leaders in the diaspora who had been forced to beg like slaves. Native-born Israelis in the 1950s and 60s were brought up to reject what they assumed was the weakness and passivity of European Jews who did not fight when the Nazis came.\n\nTo the young Israeli generals, mainly native-born, mostly in their 30s and 40s, Eshkol, who liked speaking Russian and Yiddish as much as Hebrew, seemed to embody the weakness of the diaspora. That was unfair - he had arrived in Palestine as a young man and had spent his life building the state.\n\nBrig Gen Elad Peled, one of four divisional commanders, was at the meeting. Peled told me in 2002: \"The mental generation gap was very important. We were the cowboys, frontier people. We looked at the older generation as people who were not free, they were not liberatedâ¦ the minister of education asked me 'what if you're wrong? You're playing with the existence of the state.' I told him I am 100% confident about the result of the war.\"\n\nLike many Israeli prime ministers, Eshkol was also minister of defence. He was forced to give the job up, in favour of one of Israel's war heroes, the swashbuckling, one-eyed general, Moshe Dayan.\n\nThe soldier had stated his essential philosophy at the funeral of Ray Rothberg, who was killed at a kibbutz near Gaza in 1956. \"It is the fate of our generation that our life requires that we be always prepared and armed, strong and determined, for if the sword be struck from our grasp, we shall die.\"\n\nNasser was gambling for high stakes. Egypt had a modern air force but the army was weak. His generals were well-aware that Nasser's brinkmanship had taken them to the edge of a disastrous war.\n\nInternational attempts to defuse the crisis had failed. The only idea the Americans and the British had was the so-called Red Sea Regatta, the proposed naval task force that would force open the Straits of Tiran.\n\nBut the US and British admirals and politicians hated the idea. They worried it might not work, and that they would be handing Nasser another victory.\n\nOn Friday 2 June, Israel's generals put the definitive case for war to the cabinet defence committee. They told the politicians that they could beat Egypt, but the longer they had to wait the harder it would be.\n\nA few days earlier Meir Amit, the head of Israel's spy agency Mossad, had travelled to Washington DC on a false passport, in disguise. He did not want to wait longer for war; he was deeply concerned about the shutdown in the economy caused by the mobilisation of most of the male population under the age of 50.\n\nAmit told me in 2002 about a crucial meeting he had with the US defence secretary, Robert McNamara.\n\n\"I saidâ¦ 'I'm going to recommend a war'.\n\n\"McNamara asked only two questions. 'How long?' I said it would take a week. 'How many casualties?' I said less than the war of independence, which was 6,000. McNamara said 'I read you loud and clear'.\"\n\nThe Americans had given a clear signal. They had been told that Israel would be going to war and had made no attempt to stop it happening.\n\nAmit travelled back to Israel with the Washington ambassador, Abe Harman, on an aircraft full of gas masks. They arrived in Tel Aviv on the evening of Saturday 3 June.\n\nA car took them straight to Eshkol's apartment, where he was waiting with his key ministers. Amit wanted an immediate war. Harman wanted to wait another week or so.\n\nDayan disagreed: \"If we wait for seven to nine days, there will be thousands dead. It's not logical to wait. Let's strike first and then look after the political side.\"\n\nEveryone who was there had no doubt that the decision had been taken. Israel was going to war. The cabinet ratified it the next morning.\n\nIn Egypt, Nasser predicted Israel would attack on 4 or 5 June. He based his observation on the progress of an Iraqi armoured division, which was heading towards the Jordan Valley and Israel. He knew Israel would not tolerate such a change in the balance of forces.\n\nUnlike the Egyptians and the other Arab armies, the Israelis had done their homework. They had flown hundreds of reconnaissance missions over the years to build up an accurate picture of every airbase in Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Pilots had a target book, giving the details of their layouts, call signs and defences. From radio intercepts they even built up voice-recognition files of the main Arab commanders.\n\nIt was a huge success. Field Marshal Amer and the Egyptian top brass were meeting at Bir Tamada, an airbase in Sinai. They were just starting the meeting when the first Israeli jets started their bomb runs. One of the generals was so surprised by the attack that the first thing that flashed through his mind was a coup or some other kind of Egyptian betrayal.\n\nAmer's plane was able to take off but at one point had nowhere to land as every Egyptian airbase was under attack.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Ezer Weizman was ecstatic. The attacks were going better than expected. They had achieved complete surprise over the enemy. He phoned his wife: \"We've won the war,\" he shouted.\n\nLater in the day Israel destroyed most of the Jordanian and Syrian air forces. Israel controlled the skies, and after that it was matter of finishing the job.\n\nIsrael warned King Hussein not to enter the war. But his mind was already made up, and he had put Jordan's efficient army under the command of a less than capable Egyptian general.\n\nJust before midday fighting started in Jerusalem. The Jordanians opened fire. King Hussein ignored Israeli signals that Jordan would be spared if it stayed out of the war. After the Samua raid in 1966 he didn't believe Israeli assurances; and he was convinced that if he reneged on the military alliance he had entered with Egypt he would lose his throne.\n\nFurther south, Israeli ground forces had pushed into the Sinai desert, and were moving forward rapidly in three broad thrusts. The Egyptians fought bravely from fixed positions but unlike the Israelis had not been trained to improvise, or to be flexible or speedy.\n\nIn the army headquarters in Cairo the commanders were increasingly gripped by panic. General Salahdeen Hadidi slumped in his chair, convinced that the war was at least half lost. It was worse than that for Egypt.\n\nBut outside on the streets the people were celebrating. Crowds poured into the city by evening on buses provided by the ruling party. Voice of the Arabs was their trusted source of news and truth, and it was pushing out fantasy.\n\nBy 20:17 it was reporting that 86 Israeli aircraft had been destroyed and that Egyptian tanks had broken into Israel. At the headquarters of the Sinai front, General Mohamed Abdel Ghani Gamasy listened \"with growing horror\" to what he knew was a pack of nonsense.\n\nYears later I asked Ahmed Said why he had told outright lies on air. In his crumbling, once-grand apartment overlooking the Nile, he defended himself.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Eshkol died of a heart attack in 1969. His widow, Miriam, believed that he had never recovered from being forced out of the ministry of defence on the eve of war.\n\nEshkol's successor, Golda Meir, was warned in 1973 that Egypt and Syria were preparing a surprise attack. But the Israelis were still suffering from hubris after the crushing defeat they had inflicted in 1967.\n\nIn the war that followed Israel was saved by a massive airlift of supplies from the United States. Egypt believed it had redeemed its national honour, and its president, Anwar Sadat, followed through with his historic overture for peace.\n\nAfter 1967 the Americans looked at Israel with new eyes. It fell in love with the young sabras who had beaten three Arab armies.\n\nAll the issues that are now depressingly familiar to anyone who follows the news - violence, occupation, settlements, the future of Jerusalem - took their current form as a result of the war. The shape of the occupation emerged very quickly. Predictions of the dangers that lay ahead were ignored.\n\nJust after the war ended, David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, warned against the seductive charms of victory. In a speech at Beit Berl, the think tank of the Israeli Left, he said that staying in the territories would distort the Jewish state and might even destroy it. Israel must keep Jerusalem, but everything else must go back to the Arabs, with or without a peace deal.\n\nAbba Eban, the foreign minister, saw maps that showed Israel stretching from the Golan to Suez and along the entire length of the River Jordan not as a \"guarantee of peace but an invitation to early war\".\n\nBut the mood in Israel blew away any suggestion of caution as decisively as the Israeli army had dealt with the Arabs. In just under a week of war the Israeli public went from despair to the joy of deliverance.\n\nReligious Jews believed that the victory was a miracle that had been given to them by God. Secular Israelis felt the electricity of the moment. Hanan Porat, a paratrooper who went on to become a leader of the settlement movement, never forgot the sight of his secular comrades weeping at the Western Wall, a remnant from the time of the second Jewish Temple, in East Jerusalem, a few minutes after they captured it.\n\n\"I had a sense that here in Jerusalem the inner truth of the Jewish nation was revealed. It was a miracle because the truth of the Bible was combined with the truth of life. An electric current ran right through the people of Israel.\"\n\nPresident Johnson's Middle East adviser Bob Anderson warned a month after the war that Jerusalem had a special significance for Arabs. \"The Old City of Jerusalem is capable of stirring mobs in the streets to the point where the fate of our most moderate friends in the Middle East will be in jeopardy and the basis laid for a later holy war.\"\n\nSome Israelis thought they might be able to trade some of the captured territory for peace, though not East Jerusalem which was enlarged with the addition of a band of territory from the West Bank and then annexed.\n\nAt a summit in Khartoum at the end of August, Arab states were in no mood to go cap in the hand to the country that had humiliated them, again. Arab leaders said there would be no negotiations, no recognition and no peace with Israel.\n\nParadoxically, defeat in 1967 helped kick start the Palestinian national movement. Before then the Palestine Liberation Organisation had been a puppet of Nasser, a way of containing the Palestinians rather than helping their fight for independence.\n\nAfter 1967 Yasser Arafat and his Fatah faction took matters into their own hands. After several dozen Fatah hit and run raids in only three months in 1968, the Israelis mounted a reprisal raid on the group's headquarters in Karameh refugee camp in Jordan.\n\nPeace negotiations started in the early 1990s to try to unwind the consequences of the 1967 war. Yitzhak Rabin, by then prime minister, shook hands with his old enemy Yasser Arafat under the gaze of a beaming President Clinton on the lawn of the White House in 1993.\n\nThe peace process was flawed from the start for both sides. But it was all they had. Extreme Israeli right-wingers took it seriously; they believed it threatened their dream of controlling all the land that God had given to the Jewish people.\n\nA Jewish extremist assassinated Rabin in Tel Aviv in 1995. His killer was so pleased that he had killed a man he saw as a traitor and a threat to Jews that during his first interrogation he picked up a cup to toast his success.\n\nRabin was the necessary man for Israelis; they trusted him with their security. That was why he was killed.\n\nThe peace process might have failed with Rabin. But without the man who had prepared and led the army to victory in 1967, and with Palestinian violence against Israelis rising in the unstable years after the assassination, peace did not have a chance.\n\nFifty years on from 1967, President Trump - like many new American presidents - is hoping to help Israelis and Palestinians make peace.\n\nIf his dreams become substantive talks, they will have to be about the future of the land that was captured in six days of war. It was an extraordinary human drama, which swept up a generation of Israelis and Arabs whose children and grandchildren still cannot live peacefully in the world the war created.\n\nThe Holy Land, with Jerusalem at its heart, is a place where the great tectonic plates of religion, culture and nationalism come together. The fault lines that run between them are never quiet and always dangerous. Ignoring the legacy of 1967 is not an option."
