        "text": "To All the Boys I've Loved Before has taken the world by storm and it certainly helps that it was a best-selling novel before it got turned into the hit movie we have all fallen in love with. Along with its two other sequels, the book series has become a New York Times best seller. But, as with every book adaptation, some scenes that you loved reading about might look a little different on screen.\n\nHere are all the differences between the book and movie...\n\nWhy Kitty Sent Out the Letters\n\nKitty meant well when she sent out the letters in the movie. In an effort to help her sister find a good guy, she decided to send out all 5 letters in the hopes of getting Lara Jean a boyfriend. However, in the book, Kitty sent out the letters after Lara Jean found out about Kitty's crush on Josh. Before Lara Jean was able to tell Josh about it, Kitty decided to send out the letters as revenge.\n\nThe Mystery of Who Sent the Letters\n\nFor the majority of the book, it was honestly anyone's guess as to who sent out the letters. However, in the movie, it was pretty obvious that Kitty was the one who sent out the letters after she sneaked into the closet and looked at the hat box.\n\nHow Lara Jean and Peter First Interact\n\nWhile Lara Jean and Peter clearly have history before their first scenes together, the way they first start to talk is completely different. In the book, Lara Jean has some car issues and Peter decides to help her out. In the movie, Lara Jean backs up and almost runs him over.\n\nPeter's Letter Is Missing Something\n\nOnce all the letters get out, Peter tries to sort things out with Lara Jean and mentions a part of the letter that says he has golden specks in his eyes. While that's a super cute moment in the movie, it wasn't the same in the book as she wrote that he has an STD, something that was definitely not mentioned in the film.\n\nJosh's Jeep vs. Audi\n\nPeter Kavinski's silver Jeep was certainly Kitty-approved in the movie, but in the book he actually drove an Audi. However, when he started to pick up Kitty and Lara Jean before school, he decided to switch to his mom's minivan in order to fit everyone.\n\nWhy Josh is Jealous\n\nIn the book, it's pretty obvious that Josh has feelings from Lara Jean. He ends up getting jealous of her new relationship with Peter after he realizes his feeling for her. In the movie, it's not really clear why Josh hates Peter. It just seems like he's really protective of her because of their old friendship, although, it is kind of odd he just so happened to be outside during Lara Jean and Peter's big fight.\n\nLara Jean and Peter's First Kiss\n\nIn both the book and the movie, Lara Jean decides to kiss Peter in order to hide her crush on Josh. However, in the movie she kisses him in the middle of the track field once she sees Josh, who wants to ask her about the letter. In the book, she accidentally runs into Peter after Josh tries to confront her and she kisses him.\n\nWhy Peter Tries to Start the Secret Relationship\n\nGen is a major reason why Peter ends up getting into the secret relationship with Lara Jean, but it's completely different in the book than it is in the movie. In the film, he hopes it would help him get back with Gen after their breakup. In the book, he tries to use it in order to send a message to Gen that their relationship is over.\n\nThe Reason Behind their Big Fight\n\nAfter their big hot tub film goes viral, Lara Jean and Peter break up in the film after she finds out that he went to Gen's room the same night. In the book, they end up breaking up after she thinks that he still loves Gen.\n\nThe Big Reveal of Who Shared the Hot Tub Video\n\nIn both the book and the movie, it's revealed that Gen was the one who shared the video. However, Peter and Lara Jean don't find out about it until the second book P.S. I Still Love You.\n\nJohn Ambrose McClaren Showing Up\n\nYou might have missed this mid-credits scene where John Ambrose McClaren shows up at Lara Jean's doorstep with some flowers and her letter! Unfortunately, we didn't see what happened next in the movie. In the book, however, John Ambrose plays a big part in the sequel P.S. I Still Love You. Here's hoping we get a sequel so we can see that unfold!"
