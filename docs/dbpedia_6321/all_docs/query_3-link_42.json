        "text": "The Boy and the Heron is said to be the final film from the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, director of Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and Howl’s Moving Castle.\n\nLike Spirited Away, The Boy and the Heron tells the story of a child who enters a magical world and undergoes a psychological transformation—both films have been compared to Alice in Wonderland, best interpreted through the logic of dreams.\n\nThe story of The Boy and the Heron is simple, but challenging; it’s a film that embraces ambiguity and contradictions.\n\nIt might be reductive to “explain” a film that rewards personal interpretation, but here’s my take on The Boy and the Heron.\n\nWarning — spoilers ahead.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron is Miyazaki reflecting on his life and legacy, and arguably, the film is the clearest articulation of a philosophy that has always influenced his art—the importance of accepting the end.\n\nMiyazaki’s films tend to be imbued with a deep, aching sense of nostalgia, but his protagonists are often forced to accept loss. Change is depicted as an unstoppable force; only fools try to resist the passing of time.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron is about saying goodbye and moving into the future, scars and all.\n\nThe Heron\n\nThe heron (memorably voiced by Robert Pattinson in the English dub) remains something of a mystery throughout the film, but the bird is clearly very powerful, different from the rest of the magical creatures we see in the film.\n\nThe heron proves to be a contradictory character, a liar who leads the protagonist to the truth and proves himself to be a loyal ally. After the heron’s beak is damaged, he reveals his true form—a small, wizened man who wears a heron skin to shape-shift.\n\nThe heron might have been inspired by myths and legends; many folktales across the world feature animal skins as the key to shape-shifting, with damaged skins hindering the ability to transform.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the heron’s cry was viewed as a harbinger of change. In ancient Egypt, the heron was associated with creation and rebirth and is suspected to have inspired the legend of the phoenix (another symbol of rebirth). Japanese folklore sees the heron as divine, able to traverse across the three elements: earth, air and water.\n\nThe heron’s role in the film, as the creature who delivers the call to action and can seamlessly move between worlds, echoes the folklore associated with the bird.\n\nThe Plot Of ‘The Boy And The Heron’\n\nThe story begins in tragedy, with the young protagonist, Mahito, traumatized by the loss of his mother, who perishes in a fire.\n\nThere’s no time to grieve, as Mahito’s father immediately remarries and impregnates his wife’s sister, Natsuko, who asks Mahito to accept her as his new mother. Natsuko is very kind, but Mahito is not ready yet.\n\nThe boy soon finds himself isolated, in a strange house, haunted by a mysterious tower that seems to be a gateway to the supernatural. After being bullied at school, Mahito is overcome with emotion and strikes himself with a rock, scarring the side of his head.\n\nWhile recovering, Mahito is stalked by a gray heron who summons him to the tower, claiming that his mother can be found there, alive and well. Mahito watches as Natsuko, who is heavily pregnant, enters the woods that lead to the tower, seemingly in a trance.\n\nMahito soon makes his own way to the tower, consumed by curiosity; he understands that the heron is lying about his mother, but nevertheless, he wants to see for himself.\n\nAfter entering the gate and challenging the heron, Mahito finds himself trapped in a magical world that exists beyond time and space, a realm created by his elderly great uncle who is struggling to maintain balance, and seeks a successor to inherit his role.\n\nFrom this point, the film slips smoothly into dream logic, with dramatic tonal shifts between whimsy and horror, as Mahito tries to make sense of the inexplicable.\n\nThe Other World Of ‘The Boy And The Heron’\n\nLike Spirited Away, the other world is filled with unexpected friends and foes. Mahito encounters a younger version of his mother, Himi, who wandered into the tower when she was a child.\n\nHimi appears to exist beyond linear time, holding memories of motherhood and gifted with powerful fire magic that seems connected to her tragic death. Throughout his adventure, Mahito forms a new connection with his mother, while steadily growing to accept Natsuko as his stepmother.\n\nNatsuko is trapped in this world, but also seems free to express her own repressed resentments toward Mahito—the boy isn’t the only one grieving Himi, and struggling to process the speed of change.\n\nThe other world is soon revealed to be an island, surrounded by an infinite ocean. The source of the island’s magic was an accident, seeded by a mysterious meteor that fell from the sky and allowed Mahito’s great-uncle to build the tower and take control.\n\nWhile the island is a place of miracles and revelations, it's also a prison. Mahito’s great-uncle is isolated from other people, and from reality itself; he spends his days struggling to maintain balance, represented by stacking magical blocks which are said to be tombstones, laced with malice.\n\nThe island is, quite literally, built on a foundation of graves, on the memories of the dead. It seems perpetually on the brink of collapse, and his great-uncle seems to have made many questionable decisions and compromises throughout his reign.\n\nThe Pelicans And The Parakeets\n\nWhen Mahito encounters cute, bubbly souls known as the “Warawara,” who must float to the sky in order to be born in the real world, he is shocked to see them devoured by pelicans.\n\nLater, he learns that the pelicans were brought here against their will and cannot escape. They are simply doing what they can to survive; even in the realm of fantasy, animals must eat.\n\nThe hungriest creatures are revealed to be big, colorful parakeets with goofy faces; they might be the closest thing the island has to human civilization.\n\nThe parakeets are as menacing as they are absurd; when Mahito first encounters them, they hide sharp knives behind their backs, intending to devour him. They are mindless consumers who enthusiastically worship a fascist leader wearing a crown—if the parakeets are meant to reflect humanity, it’s not a flattering comparison.\n\nThe parakeets and their king are the ones holding Natsuko captive, hoping to use her unborn child as leverage to control their world. Mahito’s great-uncle, however, wants Mahito to inherit it all.\n\nThe Ending Of ‘The Boy And The Heron,’ Explained\n\nThe climax of the film sees great-uncle offer Mahito a handful of magical blocks untainted by malice, from which he can build a pure foundation.\n\nEssentially, Mahito’s great-uncle is offering him the opportunity to create a perfect fantasy world, free from suffering.\n\nMahito declines, pointing to the self-inflicted wound on his head; the boy has come to understand that suffering is essential to life, and rejects the lie of perfection.\n\nAt this point, the parakeet king seizes control and steals the magical blocks, stacking them hastily and unevenly. When the parakeet king sees that the blocks will collapse, he strikes the stack with his sword—violence is the only language he understands.\n\nWith the blocks shattered, the world collapses into darkness. Mahito manages to escape the island with his stepmother, bidding farewell to Himi, who must return to her own time and become his mother. As the parakeets follow them into the real world, they shrink to ordinary birds, losing their intelligence and their bloodlust.\n\nThe island was a magical world of miracles and horrors, but now, it’s just a memory. Before he departs, the heron tells Mahito that even his memory of the island will fade, in time. Maybe it's for the best.\n\nThe Boy and the Heron emphasizes the inevitability of death; of people, institutions and entire worlds. The weight of tradition becomes a burden, beautiful things turn to rot and everything ends.\n\nSomething new must emerge from the ashes, but Miyazaki doesn’t pretend to know what it might be. When the legendary director was asked about the answer to the Japanese title of his film, How Do You Live?, he responded:\n\n“I am making this movie because I do not have the answer.”"
