        "text": "01 of 20\n\nBlack Christmas (1974)\n\nThis slasher classic still holds up as one of the most chilling horror films of all time. A group of sorority sisters' good tidings of comfort and joy are interrupted by repeated profane phone calls, leading to one of them being murdered in the attic. This kicks off a horrifying series of events as they try in vain to get the police to determine the source of the call while they are picked off one by one. There have been two attempts at remaking Black Christmas in the 21st century, but neither has approached the level of paranoia and dread of the '70s original. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch Black Christmas: Peacock\n\nDirector: Bob Clark\n\nCast: Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon\n\n02 of 20\n\nBlue Valentine (2010)\n\nThere's depressing cinema, and then there's Blue Valentine, a bleak yet powerfully performed drama about the highs and lows of a marriage. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams star as Dean and Cindy, a couple raising their young daughter in New York while trying to reconcile their fractured relationship. Flashbacks to their courtship reveal the magnetic romantic charge that brought them together, while also demonstrating how that intensity would ultimately curdle into acrimony. As EW's critic writes, \"Blue Valentine is lushly touching and gorgeously told. By the time the film is over, you may feel that you know every inch of these lives.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Blue Valentine: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Derek Cianfrance\n\nCast: Ryan Gosling, Michelle Williams\n\n03 of 20\n\nBridesmaids (2011)\n\nWhen Annie (Kristen Wiig) learns that her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is getting married, what's already wrong in her life goes even more haywire — and the comic hijinks surrounding Lillian's bridal party become the stuff of legend. What kind of stuff? Well, how about the ladies trying on their dresses for the ceremony, only to be collectively struck by explosive diarrhea? Or Annie nervously combining sedatives with whiskey to create an outrageous midair incident that gets the entire crew booted from the plane taking them to Lillian's Vegas bachelorette? Throughout, Bridesmaids balances its gross-out laughs with a sentimental streak and commentary on what friendship is really about, particularly between women. \"Wiig never lets you forget that Annie is crumbling inside,\" writes EW's critic, \"so the comedy has a painful bite.\" Now, cue the Wilson Phillips! —Johnny Loftus\n\nWhere to watch Bridesmaids: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul Feig\n\nCast: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd\n\n04 of 20\n\nClueless (1995)\n\nAs if we wouldn't recommend this '90s favorite whenever it shows up on any streaming service. Amy Heckerling cleverly adapted the story structure of Jane Austen's classic novel Emma and updated it with a Beverly Hills high school setting. In her most iconic role, Alicia Silverstone plays Cher Horowitz, a fashion-forward popular student who enjoys tending to her projects, by which we mean playing with people's lives, from becoming a matchmaker for her teachers to giving new student Tai (Brittany Murphy) a makeover. But Cher's pampered world is thrown into chaos when Tai takes a liking to the boy she might be totally crushing on. While EW's critic initially gave Clueless a C+, the film has since been regarded as a modern classic and one of the best high school movies of all time. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Clueless: Peacock\n\nEW grade: C+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nCast: Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Donald Faison\n\n05 of 20\n\nDead Ringers (1988)\n\nDavid Cronenberg further established himself as the master of body horror with this disturbing horror-thriller. Jeremy Irons plays twin gynecologists Elliot and Beverly Mantle, who own a fertility clinic that Elliot uses to woo his female patients. Taking advantage of their identical appearance, Elliot allows Beverly to take over with the women, who are none-the-wiser. Their routine is interrupted when Beverly falls in love with their latest patient, an actress played by Geneviève Bujold. What follows is shocking and disturbing in classic Cronenberg fashion, accurately described by EW's critic as \"a slow, inexorable descent into madness, drugs, and death.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Dead Ringers: Peacock\n\nDirector: David Cronenberg\n\nCast: Jeremy Irons, Geneviève Bujold\n\n06 of 20\n\nDjango (1966)\n\nOnce you've surrendered to its magnificent soundtrack (scored by the brilliant Luis Bacalov), you'll be randomly belting out Rocky Roberts' infectious \"Djangooooo.\" Sergio Corbucci's quintessential spaghetti Western follows its namesake, an ex-Union soldier who roams the arid Mexico and U.S. borderlands, and his fugitive companion, Maria. Together, they tumble into a cutthroat feud between the Ku Klux Klan and Mexican revolutionaries. The film's unapologetic brutality led to bans in several countries and kept it from the U.K. until 1993, a testament to its visceral impact. It's no wonder Quentin Tarantino drew inspiration here for his own revisionist Western, Django Unchained (2012). —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch Django: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sergio Corbucci\n\nCast: Franco Nero, Loredana Nusciak, José Bódalo, Ángel Álvarez, Eduardo Fajardo\n\n07 of 20\n\nDo the Right Thing (1989)\n\nSpike Lee's examination of bristling racial tension during a particularly scalding summer day in New York City's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood is one of the most important films of the 1980s and an eminently rewatchable treasure. Do the Right Thing offers real-time debates over race and class as its characters interact throughout the day, often in the context of Sal (Danny Aiello), an Italian American who lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, owning and operating a pizza joint in a largely Black neighborhood. Tempers flare, trouble brews, and tensions boil over, all of it witnessed by a chorus of finely wrought supporting characters. Do the Right Thing netted Lee a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination, and Aiello a nom for Best Supporting Actor; it also won the coveted Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. —J.L.\n\nWhere to watch Do the Right Thing: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nCast: Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro, Rosie Perez, Bill Nunn, Richard Edson, Martin Lawrence, Samuel L. Jackson\n\n08 of 20\n\nFahrenheit 9/11 (2004)\n\nMichael Moore, known for his award-winning documentaries Roger & Me (1989) and Bowling for Columbine (2002), delivered another cinematic juggernaut with this audacious and controversial documentary. Fahrenheit 9/11 — crowned with the Palme d'Or and holding the title of America's highest-grossing documentary — fearlessly scrutinizes the Bush administration's exploitation of post-9/11 paranoia to advance unjust wars in Afghanistan and Iraq instead of seeking the terrorist attack's true perpetrators. As EW's critic notes, \"Fahrenheit 9/11 offers a catharsis for the audience. Dazzlingly assembled, at once reckless and insightful, the movie filters the actions of the Bush administration through a nose-thumbing outrage that might have been irresponsible if Moore's own words weren't girded by images that spoke 1,000 more.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Fahrenheit 9/11: Peacock\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Moore\n\n09 of 20\n\nHalf Nelson (2006)\n\nAmid the wellspring of heartwarming student-teacher tales where educators often shepherd their scholars (think 1989's Dead Poets Society or 2017's The Edge of Seventeen), Half Nelson flips the script. Earning his first Oscar nod, Ryan Gosling shines as Dan Dunne, an adored history teacher and girls' basketball coach bottling up a life of vices. When troubled student Drey catches him using drugs, an unexpected bond forms as they navigate their tumultuous lives together. To quote EW's critic, \"Half Nelson conspicuously offers no tidy resolution or concluding uplift, which only makes the movie that much more trustworthy, and the unflashy, documentary-style filmmaking more artful.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Half Nelson: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck\n\nCast: Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps, Anthony Mackie, Monique Gabriela Curnen, Denis O'Hare, Starla Benford\n\n10 of 20\n\nHell or High Water (2016)\n\nAs the mind behind Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan has been hailed as one of the kings of modern Westerns, and this propulsive crime thriller is one of his essential watches. Written by Sheridan and directed by David Mackenzie, Hell or High Water centers on Texas brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) whose family ranch is being threatened with foreclosure. Desperate, the brothers resort to going on a bank-robbing spree, which becomes a game of cat and mouse as they are tracked by a pair of Texas rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham). Entertaining in nature while also delving into themes of economic instability, Hell or High Water \"has an undeniably resonant sense of small-scale justice,\" writes EW's critic. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Hell or High Water: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Mackenzie\n\nCast: Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Gil Birmingham\n\n11 of 20\n\nM3GAN (2023)\n\nThis campy sci-fi spooker doesn't take itself too seriously, even if the titular doll is a serious threat to those who cross her owner. After robotics expert Gemma (Allison Williams) develops an artificial intelligence-powered doll named M3GAN for her grieving niece, Cady (Violet McGraw), the dangerously smart humanoid starts to exhibit possessive qualities. And God forbid anyone who poses even a minor threat to Cady. EW's critic calls M3GAN \"a scampering Blumhouse caper that turns out to be blithely self-aware, negligibly jump-scary, and mostly very fun,\" and audiences seemed to agree — the film grossed nearly $100 million at the U.S. box office, leading to an announcement of a sequel, M3GAN 2.0, coming in 2025. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch M3GAN: Peacock\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\n\nCast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Ronny Chieng, Jenna Davis, Amie Donald\n\n12 of 20\n\nMeet the Patels (2014)\n\nRavi Patel is a thirtysomething Indian American actor who recently parted ways with his white girlfriend, Audrey. Now single (much to the dismay of his family), Ravi feels the pressure to find a wife from his first-gen immigrant parents, who've mastered both the art of traditional matchmaking and ragging on his lack of love life. Struggling to scale the towering walls of cultural expectations while nursing the wounds of a romance gone sour, Ravi embarks on a quest to decipher his heart's desires. Along for the ride is his sister and partner in singlehood, Geeta, who serves as co-pilot in this lighthearted documentary. Sure, it might take some conventional routes via your favorite rom-coms, but Meet the Patels is nonetheless a side-splitting yet profound exploration of love, family, and sheer chaos mixed in a cross-cultural blender. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Meet the Patels: Peacock\n\nDirectors: Geeta V. Patel, Ravi V. Patel\n\nCast: Ravi V. Patel, Geeta V. Patel, Champa V. Patel, Vasant K. Patel, Audrey Wauchope, Chandar Abboy, Chirag Patel, Renita Abboy, Rali Amin, Sunkrish Bala\n\n13 of 20\n\nMonkey Man (2024)\n\nDev Patel's auspicious directorial debut is an ultraviolent action thriller with a lot on its mind. Patel stars as Kid, an underground fighter who sports a monkey mask in the ring. Haunted by his childhood, where he witnessed his mother's death by a police chief, Kid is determined to exact his revenge on the spiritual guru who ordered the hit. Gloriously stylized with a highly committed, John Wick-esque performance by Patel, Monkey Man also comments on India's caste system with refreshing directness. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Monkey Man: Peacock\n\nDirector: Dev Patel\n\nCast: Dev Patel, Sikander Kher, Sharlto Copley, Pitobash, Vipin Sharma\n\n14 of 20\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nWith a budget just over $100,000, George Romero's indie horror masterpiece transformed the zombie genre, reshaping these once-subjugated creatures into autonomous, flesh-craving fiends while forever etching them into pop culture (and paving the way for future undead favorites like The Walking Dead). Revolving around a group of unlikely survivors holed up in an abandoned farmhouse, this film unravels as they fend off an onslaught of ravenous ghouls storming the area. Night of the Living Dead didn't just make cinematic history; it gnawed its way into the collective consciousness, birthing a thriving franchise with five sequels from 1978 to 2009, which all carry Romero's iconic directorial touch. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Night of the Living Dead: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: George Romero\n\nCast: Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, Judith Ridley, Keith Wayne, Kyra Schon\n\n15 of 20\n\nOffice Space (1999)\n\nThe cultural success of Office Space all these years later is a great argument for why initial box office failure and mixed audience reception aren't everything. While the satirical comedy barely outgrossed its $10 million budget in 1999, it has since become a cult classic for its resonant perspective on how the average office worker relates to their job. Ron Livingston stars as Peter, a programmer bored with his job at a software company whose two co-worker friends are laid off, leading them to take revenge via a scheme that spirals out of control. With numerous memorable moments that have penetrated pop culture (Gary Cole's hilariously dry micromanager; Milton's red stapler), Office Space is one of the best comedies of the modern era. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Office Space: Peacock\n\nEW grade: C (read the review)\n\nDirector: Mike Judge\n\nCast: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root, Gary Cole\n\n16 of 20\n\nOther People (2016)\n\nThis underrated dramedy centers on David (Jesse Plemons), a writer working in the entertainment industry who comes back to his hometown to care for his mother (Molly Shannon), who is dying of cancer. As David copes with the impending loss of his mother, he is also reeling from a recent breakup with his boyfriend while his father still struggles to accept David's sexuality. Other People deftly balances the heaviness of David's situation with well-observed comedy, with EW's critic calling it \"a cancer comedy that makes you both squirm and sniffle.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Other People: Peacock\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Chris Kelly\n\nCast: Jesse Plemons, Molly Shannon, Bradley Whitford, Maude Apatow, Madisen Beaty, John Early, Zach Woods, Josie Totah, June Squibb\n\n17 of 20\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\n\nSequels released more than a decade after the first film are always a gamble, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was one of multiple films from 2022 (Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way of Water) that actually improved upon its predecessor. Eleven years after the first Puss in Boots, the eponymous rascally cat has now burned through eight of his nine lives on his various adventures, reteaming with Kitty Softpaws in pursuit of the Last Wish, which would restore his lives. Along the way, he tries to outrun Goldilocks — hoping to attain the Last Wish for herself — and a menacing wolf who mysteriously stalks Puss. Like other DreamWorks films post-Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the blend of 2-D and 3-D is striking in its visual texture, particularly in action sequences, but its darkly authentic themes of anxiety and the value of friendship resonate most of all. —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Puss in Boots: The Last Wish: Peacock\n\nDirector: Joel Crawford\n\nCast: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Wagner Moura\n\n18 of 20\n\nShort Term 12 (2013)\n\nPenned and helmed by Destin Daniel Cretton (who drew from his own experience working at a teen group facility), Short Term 12 unfolds within the titular foster home for troubled youth. Grace, a supervisor harboring her own hidden wounds, sees herself in Jayden, a newcomer grappling with self-harm, which catalyzes a reckoning with her past. Though anchored by standout performances from then-rising stars like Rami Malek and LaKeith Stanfield, it's Brie Larson's first leading film role as Grace that leaps off the screen, radiating an acting wisdom beyond her years as she embodies raw vulnerability and understated strength. With dialogue as realistic as the characters themselves, this indie gem — which snagged SXSW's Grand Jury and Audience Awards for a Narrative Feature — immerses you so deeply that you'll briefly forget you are merely a spectator. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Short Term 12: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Destin Daniel Cretton\n\nCast: Brie Larson, John Gallagher Jr., Kaitlyn Dever, Rami Malek, LaKeith Stanfield, Kevin Hernandez, Melora Walters, Stephanie Beatriz\n\n19 of 20\n\nShrek (2001)\n\nOnce upon a time, in a swamp far, far away, Mike Myers graced us by voicing DreamWorks' misanthropic ogre. He was living the dream, basking in the solitude of his boggy sanctuary, until a horde of storybook creatures — a talking donkey, three little pigs, seven dwarves, and more — decide to crash the party after being ousted from the kingdom by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). To reclaim his peace and quiet, Shrek must rescue a certain red-haired princess, all for the sake of Farquaad's romantic fantasies. A fairy tale that brims with unexpected friendships, laugh-out-loud moments, and enough layers to rival an onion, Shrek is an animated delight you just can't ogre-look. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Shrek: Peacock\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson\n\nCast: Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, Vincent Cassel, Conrad Vernon\n\n20 of 20\n\nZodiac (2007)\n\nWho is the Zodiac Killer? It's a question that has haunted both professional detectives and amateur sleuths for decades, as depicted in this chilling masterpiece from director David Fincher. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Robert Graysmith, the real-life political cartoonist who attempted to decode the infamous serial killer's messages and went down numerous rabbit holes for years. Detectives eventually identify one man as a likely suspect, though he is ultimately not charged, resulting in ambiguity that continues to this day. \"Explaining a mystery is an act of reassurance,\" writes EW's critic, noting that Zodiac \"offers no such soothing closure, and that’s part of what’s haunting about it.\" —K.J.\n\nWhere to watch Zodiac: Peacock\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Edwards, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, John Carroll Lynch, Dermot Mulroney"
