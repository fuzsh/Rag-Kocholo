        "text": "And did you know that young boys used to wear dresses?\n\nPink for boys and blue for girls used to be the fashion rule.\n\nBut when did that switch?\n\nAnd when did young boys stop wearing dresses?\n\nIf you want some to hear something a little confusing to modern sensibilities, an 1893 article in the new york times gave the rule of thumb to quote \"always give pink to a boy and blue to a girl.\"\n\nWhich to put it mildly, would make all those gender reveal parties a little confusing.\n\nBut although today we take it for granted that blue is the color for boys and pink is the color equivalent of all things feminine, when did we first start making that assumption?\n\nAnd why pink and blue?\n\nWhy not green for girls and lilac for boys?\n\nWhat is it about these two hues that cornered the market on infant fashion?\n\nWell it seems like the answer to this puzzle lies somewhere in 19th century style guides, our old friend advertising and the advent of modern ultrasounds.\n\nBut before we get into all of these important questions we should first ask ourselves: What were babies wearing before pink and blue?\n\nWell the perhaps unexpected answer to this question is that before babies were being outfitted in gender specific pastels they didn't wear colors at all.\n\nIn fact most babies in the US and Europe were sporting unisex white gowns and dresses or gowns that were simply the color of the fabric that they were made from.\n\nPastels didn't even play a part.\n\nAnd with these gowns it was a convenience more than gender that was dictating the getups since dresses without fitted bottoms made it easier for parents to change a child's soiled diapers and underclothing.\n\nAlso white wasn't just a matter of style, but a question of practicality.\n\nWhite clothing could be cleaned more easily either by using stronger soaps and bleach or outside, without having to worry about maintaining and preserving their distinct colors.\n\nSo not only did babies rock a surprisingly colorless wardrobe, they also were pretty much uniformly rocking dresses, a look that we now associate very strongly with femininity, girls, and women.\n\nBut after checking out this picture of a young Franklin Roosevelt rocking a dress circa 1884, you have to admit that if even future presidents were wearing white dresses then it wasn't just an anomaly.\n\nIn fact, it was the fashion that young boys should wear dresses until they were about 6 or 7, when they would also receive their first hair cuts.\n\nSo through much of the 19th century, babies looked pretty indistinct, at least along gender lines.\n\nAnd this wasn't thought of as an issue at all.\n\nAll children wore the same clothes and that was thought of as the norm.\n\nBut that brings us to our next question: When did colors come into play?\n\nWell the idea that colors could be added to baby clothing in the US wasn't introduced in popular culture until the mid 19th century, according to Professor Jo B Paoletti at the University of Maryland.\n\nBut even then, colors weren't always so closely aligned to gender.\n\nThat didn't come into play until after World War 1.\n\nAnd when they did start getting lined up to certain baby genders it wasn't always blue equals boy and pink is for girls.\n\nIn fact sometimes it was the opposite.\n\nPaoletti argues that in order for clothing to assume a certain \"gender identity\" or association, the pattern of use has to line up with concepts and cultural norms that we assume are unambiguously connected to a specific gender.\n\nAnd some of these assumptions are based on the \"pattern of use\" of a particular garment.\n\nTake for example the plain white t-shirt.\n\nIn the 1940s plain white t-shirts were considered a masculine garment because it was primarily circulating on men and being worn by men.\n\n(Think back on some of the plain white tees sported by Marlon Brando and James Dean).\n\nBut as time progressed fashions changed, and now both men and women wear plain white tees regularly.\n\nSo someone today wouldn't necessarily assume that this garment signifies a specific gender.\n\nThis was the same for infant dresses and colors throughout the 19th century.\n\nBecause the plain dresses were thought of as children's clothing more broadly, there wasn't a concern that they should wear distinct outfits based on whether they were boys or girls.\n\nAnd even as colors were introduced into the baby fashion lexicon, there wasn't a clear cut formula down gender lines.\n\nFor example a June 1918 article in Earnshaw's Infants' Department publication, stated: \"The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys and blue for the girls.\n\nThe reason is that pink, being the more decided and strong color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.\"\n\nSounds strange now doesn't it?\n\nAdditionally according to the Smithsonian magazine, some sources note that blue should be for blond and blue eyed children, while pink was ideal for brown eyed babies and brunettes.\n\nIn 1927, Time magazine had a style chart that suggested gender appropriate colors for children, and department stores across the country suggested boys wear pink including Filene's, Best & Co, Halle's and Marshall Field.\n\nSo choosing colors based on gender was a fairly recent phenomenon.\n\nBut if baby colors weren't always pink and blue, that leads us to the next question: When did pink become a color for girls and when did blue get assigned to boys?\n\nWell it seems that assigning pink and blue had a lot to do with manufacturers around the time current baby boomers were children.\n\nBecause even though we've listed that some style guides suggested pink for boys, others argued for boys wearing blue and girls in pink.\n\nIn the 1940s, manufacturers began making clothing that color coordinated for young boys and girls, dividing the population between blue and pink color assignments based on what they believed the public would like and what they would buy.\n\nAnd eventually the gendered color codes we know today won out.\n\nBut as Paoletti argues, \"It could have gone the other way.\"\n\nThere's really no dedicated logic behind the assignment of these colors to feminine and masculine qualities in the US.\n\nIn fact, if you look around the world colors can come to signify multiple meanings and rituals across cultures: For example red in South Africa can stand for mourning, whereas in China red can be a harbinger of good luck.\n\nIn Germany and France yellow can be a signifier of jealousy.\n\nIn Japan yellow can be used for \"bravery, wealth, and refinement.\"\n\nAnd blue can be seen as a sign of different religious practices, and carries special significance in Judaism, Catholicism in Latin America, and in Hinduism.\n\nSo colors are up for grabs as cultural markers and the designation of pink and blue to certain genders was as much about the marketing choices at the beginning of the 20th century as it was about preferences believed to be tied to masculine and feminine traits.\n\nIn fact, even though pink and blue color codes, boys wearing pants to emulate their fathers and infant girls wearing dresses to mirror mom, saw a rise in popularity at the beginning of the 20th century, it somewhat waned in the 1960s.\n\nWith the rise of the women's liberation movement, there was some easing in the manufacturers' push of color coded and gender specific clothing, with unisex clothes seeing some popularity again.\n\nSo even though there still remained pink clothes for girls, there was a wider range of outfits designed to give young girls more freedom of movement and activity than the more standard dresses.\n\nBut by the 1980s we see the cementing of color coded clothing for infants with specific gendering.\n\nAnd that may be related to the improvements in ultrasound technology.\n\nAround 1985 when ultrasounds were getting clearer and clearer, parents were able to ask their healthcare provider the big question at the heart of every gender reveal video: \"Are we having a boy or a girl?\"\n\nAnd that's when products for infants geared towards a specific baby outcome increased in demand and popularity.\n\nNow affluent parents (and parents in general) could design their nurseries and baby wardrobes around gender, and were urged to buy new sets of items for different genders instead of reusing unisex clothing and gear.\n\nThis spread to all parts of the baby domain, from clothing, to diapers, toys, and furniture.\n\nAlso the idea that a person should be able to distinguish a baby's gender as soon as you see them stood at the heart of many pushes to dress children in noticeably different clothing that would distinguish them one from another, whereas prior to the 20th century this wasn't considered a pressing concern of most parents looking for baby attire.\n\nSo how does it all add up?\n\nWell it seems like through most of the 19th century US babies all wore dresses and those dresses were almost always white.\n\nAnd parents, while still concerned with the identity of their babies, weren't as anxious to distinguish them from each other in infancy through their attire.\n\nIn fact children's clothes were designed with ease in mind, more so than displaying masculine or feminine traits.\n\nBut as we got into the 20th century style guides and companies started pushing particular colors for particular genders.\n\nIn part because they were able to capitalize on parents' need to buy new clothing according to the gender of their child instead of reusing or handing down unisex clothes.\n\nAnd although gendered colors were waning by the 60's & 70's, improvements in ultrasounds allowed parents to make predictions (and nursery design plans) around the gender of upcoming babies.\n\nSo even though pink and blue could easily be reversed, it might not have changed how we conceive of gender in the popular domain, but rather how we draw associations and assumptions about gender based on certain color schemes.\n\nSo what do you think?"
