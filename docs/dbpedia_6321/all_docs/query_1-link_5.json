        "text": "Django Unchained 2012\n\nThe western was the film genre that\n\nbrought the heroic figure together\n\nwith the overwhelming yet splendid\n\nlandscape. This case study looks at\n\na subversion of that cinema genre\n\nthrough an unlikely relationship:\n\nEnglish portrait and landscape\n\npainter Thomas Gainsborough\n\n(Blue Boy, 1770) and American\n\nfilmmaker Quentin Tarantino (Django\n\nUnchained, 2012).\n\nQuentin Tarantino has often\n\nbeen referred to as the archetypal\n\n“postmodern” filmmaker. His films\n\nbear the hallmarks associated\n\nwith postmodernist approaches:\n\nappropriation of ideas, images,\n\nand texts from different sources;\n\nreferencing other movies, books, and\n\nart; pastiching established genres;\n\nconflating popular culture and high\n\nculture. In his later films, Tarantino\n\nsubverts existing genres, including\n\nestablished trash and schlock genre\n\nforms, and through the process of\n\nsubversion seeks to make a serious\n\npoint.\n\nThomas Gainsborough, the\n\neighteenth-century portrait and\n\nlandscape painter, could not be\n\nfurther apart from Quentin Tarantino\n\nat first glance. Yet Gainsborough\n\nwas subversive in many ways. Like\n\nTarantino, he broke new artistic\n\nground and challenged established\n\nartistic forms. However, until Django\n\nUnchained, it would have been\n\nridiculous to imagine a comparison\n\nbetween Gainsborough and\n\nTarantino, or even to discuss them\n\nwithin the same sentence. But in that\n\nfilm, Tarantino and his design team\n\n(J. Michael Riva and Sharen Davis)\n\nappropriate a key element of one of\n\nGainsborough’s most popular and\n\nmost widely distributed painting,\n\nThe Blue Boy. It is from this starting\n\npoint that we will look at this case\n\nstudy of Django Unchained and\n\nGainsborough’s Blue Boy.\n\nThe Blue Boy was painted before\n\nGainsborough moved to London.\n\nBorn and raised in a lower-middleclass\n\nfamily in rural Suffolk, he\n\nmoved to the spa town of Bath as\n\nhis portrait practice developed.\n\nThe problem for Gainsborough was\n\nthat he preferred landscapes. He\n\nliked painting people—skin tones,\n\ndrapery, and costume—but, with the\n\nexception of certain female clients,\n\nhe disliked painting portraits of the\n\ntype of people who commissioned\n\nhim. We know this because in his\n\nletters he complains about his rich,\n\narrogant, empty-headed clients, and\n\nsays many times over that he wishes\n\nhe could just go to the countryside\n\nand spend the rest of his life painting\n\nlandscapes and common folk. (His\n\nown favorite was The Woodsman,\n\n1788, a portrait of a poor forest\n\nworker.)\n\nIt is not unusual for people\n\nto dislike their day job and wish\n\nto be doing something else. But\n\nGainsborough’s ability to create real\n\nlikenesses of his subjects made him\n\nsuccessful. He rejected the current\n\nfashion of painting his subjects\n\ndressed up as mythological beings;\n\nhe wanted to paint people in their\n\nown clothes, looking as they would if\n\nyou met them. One of the trendiest\n\nfashions in mid-eighteenth-century\n\nEngland was to be painted wearing\n\nthe court costume of the previous\n\ncentury, in the style of Dutch painter\n\nAnthony Van Dyke at the court of\n\nKing Charles I. Van Dyke’s paintings\n\nwere widely copied; all decent\n\npainters understood that they should\n\nbe able to make a Van Dyke to order.\n\nVan Dyke painted his aristocratic\n\nsubjects wearing elaborate silk and\n\nlace suits, one of the most influential\n\nbeing Lord John Stuart and His\n\nBrother, Lord Bernard Stuart (1638).\n\nIn the painting, Bernard Stuart is\n\nwearing a fabulous pale blue satin\n\nsuit, though most of it is obscured by\n\na heavy silver cape.\n\nNormally this is the kind of\n\nportrait that Gainsborough would\n\nhave scoffed at replicating. But\n\ntwo years previously he had been\n\nelected a founder member of the\n\nRoyal Academy of Arts. It was never\n\nan easy relationship; Gainsborough\n\nfelt like an outsider with something\n\nto prove. He decided to challenge\n\nthe claim of the Academy’s head, Sir\n\nJoshua Reynolds, that blue colors\n\nshould be used only as accents, not\n\nin the main mass of the picture. He\n\npainted a mass of blue, an exercise\n\nin color and light reflecting on\n\nsilk, using layers of different blue\n\npigments: lapis and indigo, cobalt\n\nand turquoise, together with charcoal\n\nand creamy white, and sent The\n\nBlue Boy to the Royal Academy’s\n\n1770 Salon.\n\nBut who was the blue\n\nboy? He was not an aristocrat or\n\ntheater celebrity who would normally\n\ncommand an Academy-level portrait.\n\nHe was Jonathan Buttall, a good\n\nfriend of Gainsborough and an iron\n\nmerchant in London. It was not a\n\ncommissioned portrait: Buttall posed\n\nfor Gainsborough as a friend. Buttall\n\nwas far outside the circles of power;\n\nhe could never have worn court\n\ndress. Therefore, The Blue Boy is a\n\nsubversion. It is not only a painting\n\nof an eighteenth-century man in\n\nseventeenth-century dress; it is an\n\naristocratic portrait that portrays a\n\nmiddle-class man.\n\nThe painting became the talk of\n\nthe Academy, and its success spurred\n\nthe painter to move to London two\n\nyears later. He was commissioned\n\nby the royal family, and his success\n\nenabled him to take more time out\n\nto paint his beloved landscapes.\n\nBut it was not that simple. Soon after\n\narriving in London, Gainsborough\n\nfell out with the Royal Academy and\n\nspent the rest of his life in rivalry with\n\nJoshua Reynolds. He would probably be\n\nsurprised to know that The Blue\n\nBoy remains his most popular and\n\nmost influential painting—though\n\nnot his best—while to him, it was\n\na caprice. While Jonathan is not\n\nportrayed heroically, he stands\n\nfor the bourgeoisie, excluded at\n\nthat time from political power and\n\ninfluence, which was still in the hands\n\nof the aristocracy. Dressing him in\n\nVan Dyke costume must have been a\n\nbit of a joke, a subversion to slip into\n\nthe heart of the Establishment, the\n\nRoyal Academy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century,\n\nThe Blue Boy was an internationally\n\npopular print and is said to have\n\ninspired the 1919 film Knabe in Blau\n\nby F. W. Murnau (now thought to\n\nhave been lost). Quentin Tarantino\n\nand costume designer Sharen Davis\n\nlikely first came in contact with\n\nthe picture as a kitsch print; it was\n\nubiquitous throughout the 1970s,\n\nappearing in many inexpensively\n\nprinted versions. Blueboy was also\n\nthe name of a US gay porn magazine\n\nof the 1970s.\n\nTarantino, like Gainsborough,\n\nstarted as a rank outsider. He has\n\ntalked many times about his lack\n\nof any insider connections to the\n\nmovie business, his total lack of\n\npower or influence when he started\n\nhis career. It was hard. “Pauline Kael\n\nused to say that Hollywood is the\n\nonly town where people ‘can die\n\nof encouragement’ and that kind\n\nof was my situation,”5 he says.\n\nLike Gainsborough, Tarantino has to date\n\nshown no intention of following an\n\nestablished career path. Despite his\n\nlove of popular culture, he has not\n\nmade a studio franchise picture.\n\nHe regularly takes a drubbing from\n\ncritics, who decry his unabashed\n\nlove of trash cinema, and those who\n\ncriticize his films for violence.\n\nDjango Unchained is in part a\n\nroad movie; as production designer\n\nMichael Riva says, it is Django’s\n\npsychological journey, but it is also\n\na geographical journey through\n\nlandscape. Django and Schulz\n\narrive in Tennessee and head to\n\na haberdashery, where Django is\n\ninvited to pick out a costume in order\n\nto play the part of Schulz’s valet.\n\nThe next shot is of Django wearing\n\na bright blue suit, styled in a vague\n\npastiche of seventeenth-century\n\nfashion, the archetypal Blue Boy.\n\nThe connotations are rife: The Blue\n\nBoy is a well-known kitsch print, but\n\nthe painting resides in the important\n\nHuntingdon Museum in Los Angeles.\n\n“Boy” was a condescending term\n\nused to address all African American\n\nmales regardless of age, particularly\n\nin the South.\n\nWe first see Django in his blue\n\nsuit from the side, riding a horse\n\nthrough a landscape, a cotton field.\n\nThe composition of this shot is\n\nitself a nod to the subgenre of the\n\nequestrian portrait.\n\nVan Dyke made a\n\nfamous equestrian portrait of King Charles\n\nI, which was repeatedly copied, and\n\nGainsborough made variations on\n\nVan Dyke (as exercises, or simply to\n\npay the bills). And the David portrait\n\nof Napoleon is an equestrian portrait.\n\nEquestrian connotes aristocrat and\n\nhero. But in that costume? Not yet.\n\nThe blue suit makes Django stand\n\nout, command attention, and is\n\nineffably striking. Riva notes that\n\n“color is a really important to me,\n\nit’s a mood establisher.”7 The intense\n\nblue (much brighter than The Blue\n\nBoy’s silk) acts paradoxically as a\n\nred flag to the white supremacists\n\nhe encounters. But both Jonathan\n\nButtall and Django are in costume;\n\nJonathan could never dress like that\n\nto do his daily business as an iron\n\ndealer. Django soon equips himself\n\nin what Riva calls “warm nicotine\n\ncolors,” in more practical—and\n\nstereotypically “western”—garb.\n\nThe Blue Boy motif is incongruous\n\nin a western. Yet, as Tarantino\n\npoints out, “One of the things\n\nthat’s interesting about Westerns in\n\nparticular is there’s no other genre\n\nthat reflects the decade that they\n\nwere made and the morals and the\n\nfeelings of Americans during that\n\ndecade than Westerns. Westerns\n\nare always a magnifying glass as far\n\nas that’s concerned.” He notes that\n\n“Westerns of the ’50s definitely have\n\nan Eisenhower birth of suburbia and\n\nplentiful times aspect to them. . . . the\n\nlate ’60s has a very Vietnam vibe to\n\nthe Westerns leading into the ’70s,\n\nand by the mid-70s, you know, most\n\nof the Westerns literally could be\n\ncalled Watergate Westerns because\n\nit was about a disillusionment and\n\ntearing down the myths that we\n\nhave spent so much time building\n\nup.”\n\nDjango is a western that\n\nsubverts the dominant white male\n\nhero in a wish fulfillment revenge\n\nfantasy that forces the audience\n\nto confront race and slavery. It is\n\nprobably too much to consider The\n\nBlue Boy as a wish fulfillment class\n\nfantasy. Perhaps we should consider\n\nDjango Unchained’s Blue Boy motif\n\nto be a parody, with its political\n\nconnotations, while Gainsborough’s\n\nBlue Boy is an apolitical pastiche.\n\nYet Gainsborough’s own letters bear\n\nwitness to his private discomfort with\n\nthe upper class.\n\nTarantino and Gainsborough share\n\nthe status of being both insider and\n\noutsider. Neither man belonged to an\n\ninfluential coterie or was a member\n\nof an art or film dynasty. Both gained\n\nsuccess on their own terms, even if\n\nGainsborough sometimes whined\n\nabout his clients."
