This was like a dream come true.\n\nA certain someone didn‚Äôt realize why he was calling her Buxbaum until like halfway through the book‚Ä¶ and then they realized that‚Äôs her last name‚Ä¶ totally not me\n\n~cons that I remember~\n\nUnfortunately I think this book just spoiled the entire plot of The Great Gatsby‚Ä¶\n\nAlso, I wish the characters could stop thinking \"what the hell\", please. That phrase can get annoying after a while. Maybe change it up each time or just say something like \"why not\".\n\nSometimes I don't understand how Liz thinks because I can't connect with her. But I guess when the supposed 'love of your life' is standing in front of you, it's hard to always act rationally. She might seem a bit 'not like the other girls', but that's part of who she is and I like her for it. She could be a little slow and oblivious sometimes (especially when it comes to her love life‚Ä¶)\n\n~pros that I can think of right now~\n\nI know it'll never happen to me, but the story actually sounds realistic. Some girl who's been unlucky all her life turns out to be not so unlucky after all‚Ä¶ *continues to daydream*\n\nWhen they were stargazing and eating s‚Äômores in his backyard, OMG IT WAS SO CUTE!\n\nI love the quotes at the beginning of each chapter. The rom-com references also fit in very nicely, although i never seen/read any of them.\n\nHelena is my favorite character in here. She's such a cool and chill person, yet she was treated so unfairly for something she can't even change. She seems more like a good friend than a mom. I wish I have a friend like her‚Ä¶\n\nI was really shipping Wessy and Libby so the minor flaws doesn't really affect me. It shows how much I liked this story :)\n\nRecommend to everyone!! Especially fans of Tweet Cute! (not to be that person, but this reminded me of it)\n\nOverall, an amazing rom-com that made me cry and laugh and smile. A cute book with a cute cover. This book is now my favorite rom-com ever. :)\n\n03/12/21\n\nare rom-coms supposed to make you cry? or am i just too emotional while reading‚Ä¶?\n\ni‚Äôm genuinely curious üëÄ\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‡ºª‡ºª‚ùÅ‡º∫‡º∫‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\nif only my life were better than the movies...\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\n‚Äî 5 stars ‚ú∞\n\n‚Äúshe‚Äôs not you.‚Äú\n\n‚Äúwhat?‚Äù\n\n‚Äúshe. isn‚Äôt. you.‚Äù\n\nthis was my first lynn painter book and i‚Äôm honestly shocked to say that i ended up LOVING this book. i mean hello?? i thought i was over highschool romances but she really did an amazing job with this ya novel because istg i couldn‚Äôt stop giggling. she really made me feel like a middle-schooler again because i caught myself grinning like an idiot like.. a bunch of timesü´°\n\nbetter than the movies is about liz buxbaum. a seventeen year-old teenager, a hopeless romantic and a daydreamer through and through. when her childhood crush michael returns to their town, she wants to impress him big time. for the better or worse, it seems like her archenemy next door, wesley bennet, is hitting it off with her beloved crush. with the help of wes, she hopes to win michael over and go to prom with him.. what could go wrong, right?\n\n‚Äî liz is a hopeless romantic, everything that happens in her life ‚Äî she compares it to a movie, a romcom. she seeks that picture perfect love story but sometimes she is chasing something that isn‚Äôt really worth it. i had my problems with liz in the beginning, but she definitely grew on me. while i was mad at her for lying to her best friend, i kind of understood where it was coming from and as we follow her through her story, we see her growth and development.\n\n‚Äî wes-my-beloved-bennet. i love him, you love him, everyone loves him. charming, witty, funny, athletic. yes, he is all that. liz never really looked at him like that tho, for her he was just the annoying neighbor who teased her. but slowly she notices why everyone loves him and that is the moment we, as a reader, fall in love with him as well. the banter between him and liz was incredibly cute and SO swoon-worthy. the way he remembered all the small details about her, i literally died dead. üíóüíïüíûü©∑\n\n‚Äúyou look best when you‚Äôre you.‚Äù\n\ndid i mention the tension? god, the tension in this book üòÆ‚Äçüí®\n\nwe really get everything in this book ‚Äî childhood nemesis, drama, lots and lots of jealousy, friends to lovers but, some more drama. but overall just an amazing comfort read. this is just a book i will get back to when i need something cute to lighten up my mood, make me blush and giggle. maybe even make me scream into my pillow.\n\nwes bennet, I LOVE YOU !\n\nAugust 6, 2023\n\nLiz and I could never be friends‚Ä¶\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nWhen I picked up better than the movies, I was expecting a very clich√© and predictable YA book with plot lines I had read before. Everything was going great until we got introduced to ‚ú®Lying Liz‚ú®\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt have issues when characters lie in books but at some point I think to myself ‚Äúwill this character ever experience consequences and will she learn?‚Äù\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSpoiler warning:\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe won‚Äôt.\n\nIn the beginning I was fine with Liz but over the course of the book she couldn‚Äôt stop lying to her best friend. At first she felt bad, but after the first time, she just continued lying with ease.\n\nWith every lie, I hated her more and more\n\nI don‚Äôt understand why you have to lie about everything. And yes I get the entire ‚Äúwell she was scared to trust her best friend‚Äù I GET IT OKAY BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THE EXACT SAME THING BUT WHY LIE ABOUT GOING TO A FUCKING PARTY????\n\nLet me put you into her friend‚Äôs perspective:\n\nImagine you ask your best friend if you want to hang out, but she can‚Äôt because she has to study.\n\nThen imagine that you find out that she didn‚Äôt actually have to study but that she went to a party. How would you feel? Probably not that good.\n\nThese are the lies I don‚Äôt understand. Liz could have just said she was invited to a party instead of lying because now her best friend feels like absolute shit.\n\nYet again maybe I am too sensitive because this exact same thing happened to me but wtf.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to lie about who you hang out with. I promise it‚Äôs fine to hang out with other people just don‚Äôt fucking lie.\n\nYet, I still had hopes for the book. I was anticipating the moments all her lies blew up into her face and that she would have to deal with the consequences.\n\nI was disappointed.\n\nAlso my prediction for the future is that ‚ú®Lying Liz‚ú® will return to the dark side and Wes and her will break up in college.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd those, my fellow readers, are the reasons why Liz and I could never be friends.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis book gets a whopping 3 stars\n\n(Also for people that that this is bad, it really isn‚Äôt. This book was okay but had lots of faults)\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\n4/5\n\nLook at me falling in love with YA book, never thought it would happen, but here I am. Better Than the Movies was just utterly adorable and I couldn't put this book down. Even though the plot was predictable, this story gave me so much happiness that I smiled throughout the entire book. When I finished reading, I was sitting in the car waiting for my mom to come back from shopping ‚Äî which I was supposed to go with her but didn't because of this book ‚Äî and I literally cried. They were tears of joy, but I CRIED.\n\n\"Sometimes we get so tied up in our idea of what we think we want that we miss out on the amazingness of what we could actually have.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word.

I'm obsessed. The characters, the plot, the romcom references, the romance. Every aspect was so good and so well written. Once I hit the middle I stayed up super late and read the whole second half of the book in one sitting. What I would give to read this book for the first time again.\n\nDecember 26, 2021\n\n(2.5/5)\n\nTo say that I disliked this book would be somewhat of an understatement.\n\nMy first problem with this book was that Liz, the main character, was absolutely infuriating. The writing read like it was a not-like-other-grills YA contemporary romance from 2010, which, honestly, except for the year, is exactly what this book is.\n\nEver since her mother died when she was young, Liz has been obsessed with rom-coms and finding her movie-worthy happily-ever-after. Enter Michael, the neighborhood boy she was (and still is??) in love with when she was literally in kindergarten, and Wes, the infuriating boy-next-door. One of them is going to help her get the other. You know where I'm going with this.\n\nHonestly speaking, it was painful to see Liz adamantly going after Michael even after a) it seemed like fAtE wAs TrYiNg To KeEp ThEm ApArt, and b) his most appealing trait was his SoUtHeRn DrAwL. Like, umm, no thank you? And then there's the fact that Liz hadn't actually seen him or talked to him since elementary school, but was still in love with him. Seriously. Liz is better at romanticizing her life than me when I have six assignments to finish for school and three hours to do them all.\n\nIt was even more painful to see how she was slowly isolating herself from everyone around her, except Wes, and how somehow, in some way, most of her problems stemmed from the fact that she never really got any closure from her mother's death. That part might have actually been tragic, but it wasn't addressed very well until the end, and everything else was annoying.\n\nSpecifically, all of her gushing over Michael was just not it. I was disgusted and cringing every five minutes, to the point where I had to pause the audiobook and do history homework to attempt to burn the scenes from my mind multiple times. It was not fun, to say the least.\n\nThat being said, the audiobook was actually quite good. I think I would have jumped out a window if I was actually reading this book in text format, but somehow, the audiobooks narrator's ability was enough to keep me from taking such drastic methods of escape. The narrator was magically able to keep me at least somewhat interested in the happenings of the book, and their voice is one of the two saving graces of my reading experience.\n\nThe only character I could really tolerate was Wes. Poor, poor Wes. I'm going to say it right now: Wes did not deserve everything that Liz made him go through. The dude has been simping after her since they were children, and agrees to help her get another dude just because he likes spending time with her?? Get this man a medal. And maybe a back brace for carrying the entire book on his shoulders.\n\nI won't deny that Wes and Liz's relationship was cute, but at the same time, while it was developed a lot throughout the course of the book, I never felt that we were given the outcome of that development. It was always very two steps forward, three steps back with them.\n\nThere were a lot of tropes both used and spoken about in this book, and I felt that they were alright, but nothing too special. The plot in general was actually quite nice, the only thing that really ruined this book for me was Liz's character herself, and her inability to communicate with literally anyone in her life.\n\nOverall, I felt that this book had a lot of potential to actually be a cute and interesting, light-hearted story. Unfortunately for us, the main character makes you want to tear your hair out and then set it on fire, even if her love-interest is the human equivalent of cotton candy. I'll be honest and say that I was expecting more, especially from the MC, but if you're able to ignore that sort of stuff, I'd definitely recommend this as a sweet, quick romance if you're looking for one.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\n4.5 stars‚ú®\n\n\"Enemies-to-lovers- it's our trope, Buxbaum.\"\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Enemies to lovers\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Fake dating\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Slow burn\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Banter and cheesy vibes\n\nY'all am so glad I started 2024 reading this book. It's everything I could have asked for. I loved how cliche and cheesy it was. The whole idea of pretending to date someone to get the other guy but falling for your fake date isn't something new yet it was the writing that brought life to this idea.\n\nLiz and Wes had such good banter and chemistry. Their slow burn was worth sticking around. As individuals? I would prefer Wes over Liz. While Liz is a fun fmc, she is kinda too into fantasy world and delusional üòÖ Whereas Wes grounded her a bit and he was making me giggle so much. Michael wasn't a bad side character at all but I loved Helena more. Liz's dynamic with Helena brought more depth to Liz, and I appreciated that.\n\nThe cheesy rom com quotes were a plus. I would have preferred if the chapters had been a tad shorter, especially chapter six- why was it 60 pages long is beyond me. Also, a thing that icked me was the smoking scene, it's just a \"me issue\" but wasn't a fan of it.\n\nOther than that, I had an amazing time with it and would totally recommend it, despite some of the things that I wasn't really appreciative of.\n\n~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~\n\nThanks everyone for voting on the poll. Will be kickstarting the new year with this one and hopefully I will love it as much as you all did ‚ù§\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nThis book, guys, why did I wait so long to start this book?\n\nThe rom com movie references felt like such a nostalgic hug and ode to rom coms It genuinely felt like I transported back to being a teenager reading this with the way it had me smiling and laughing like a fool besides reliving some teenage angst and awkwardness I felt then. Each chapter began with a quote from all the rom coms I grew up on as a kid and believe they were integrated seamlessly into each chapter. This was super cute, somewhat cheesy yet fluffy but very much like a love letter to rom coms which was also obvious from the animations on the cover\n\n4.5 stars\n\nTo me, this particular YA book was portrayed incredibly realistic with certain scenarios and I was somewhat nervous to read this given mixed reviews but I‚Äôm glad I took a chance on it\n\nWES BENNETT. The famous Wes I‚Äôve been hearing about for months didn‚Äôt disappoint. Where was he when I was 17?? I‚Äôm well into my 20s but life then would‚Äôve been less stressful trying to understand boys lol he was so attentive, caring, funny & charming. I swooned, I was grinning, and I‚Äôd very much like an adult Wes my age thank you. His attention to detail and care, the maturity he exemplifies, seeing Liz for who she was, effortlessly just knows how to divert a negative into a positive when she‚Äôs having a bad moment/day, calls her out on her bs and is low key a rom com lover!? I could go on but ultimately he was too adorable for words and such a book bf\n\nLiz was.. a teenager and a hopeless romantic like some of us. I adored her love for music and the playlists and her love for rom coms and how it solidified the bond she had with her mom as it reminded me of mines in doing so. But, I do have to mention being annoyed with her during certain points. delusional (aren‚Äôt we all) & oblivious at times with pent up teenage angst is how I‚Äôd describe her and while it bothered me at times‚ÄîI understood her. Her unresolved grief and fear of things changing molded her into how she was which isn‚Äôt an excuse but I get it. Thankfully she was self aware enough to acknowledge how wrong her words and actions were and worked to change that bc she could be so petty. When she wasn‚Äôt doing the most, her delusions had me cracking up bc I somehow related to them years ago lmao. I also tried to put myself in her shoes and remember being horrible at communicating my feelings at her age so I hope the character development shown is expanded on further in the sequel\n\n‚ÄúDo you realize we could‚Äôve been doing this for years if you weren‚Äôt such a pain in the ass?‚Äù\n\nwesliz- all the teasing on Wes‚Äô end, the phone call scene, the late night talks in his backyard, the car scene (I screamed here) and confessing their feelings was the sweetest. They weren‚Äôt remotely close to enemies to lovers but who really is lol I overall found them adorable together and I wish Liz realized that sooner. idk if they‚Äôre gonna last going to college but I cannot wait for more of them and can‚Äôt help but hope they do so don‚Äôt mind me if you seeing me reading all the extra chapters as I simply want more of Wes and his pov ü§≠ anyways this was fun! and what I needed & I‚Äôm hoping this is one day adapted as a movie since it read like one\n\nsome quotes\n\n‚ÄúEnemies-to-lovers- it's our trope, Buxbaum.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe universe likes Wes better.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWow. That dress is so Liz Buxbaum.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBuy the dress Liz, I‚Äôm begging you‚Äù after she sends him a picture of her prom dress ü•π\n\n‚ÄúShe's not you.\" ‚ÄúWhat?\" ‚ÄúShe. Isn't. You‚Äù I‚Äôve seen this quote so much and now I get it üò©\n\n‚ÄúI could say these unfiltered things to him because he didn‚Äôt care. Wes Bennett knew what a mess I was underneath it all, and there was a little bit of joy in knowing he saw the real me. Freedom.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt run through a train station for Michael. But I would do it for Wes. Holy shit.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word. Then I fell in love with you.‚Äù\n\n-\n\nIn need of a rom com that‚Äôs cute and cliche? and that‚Äôll make me feel like a teenager again lol I‚Äôm excited to meet the famous Wes\n\nMarch 4, 2022\n\nTHE MC WAS ACTUALLY INSUFFERABLE. SOMEONE PLS TELL HER SHES NOT A VICTIM.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nUrgent question ‚ÅâÔ∏è WHERE CAN I FIND A WES?? (asking for a friend)\n\nAfter reading this, I got myself every single book Lynn Painter has ever written. I think that says a lot about how much I loved this book.\n\nI‚Äôm a fan of romance books (how Wes would say it, I‚Äôm a love lover) in theory, but in reality, they rarely satisfy my needs. So, you don‚Äôt have to trust my other reviews that much, but my reviews of romance books‚Ä¶ I CHOOSE MY 5 STAR READS CAREFULLY IN THAT GENRE.\n\nThis is considered a YA romance, characters are in their final year of high school, the events are set a few days before prom (15 if I‚Äôm correct). It‚Äôs very clean, our main couple shares a kiss or two. BUT, your needs will be satisfied. It‚Äôs all cute all fluff, the banter between Liz and Wes is written so well. The book is extremely funny, had me highlighting these little corny jokes (I laughed at them).\n\nEverything is told from the perspective of our main girl, Liz. She‚Äôs a lover of old romantic movies, which is a trait she got from her late mother. She rewatches her romcoms almost every day to sort of keep the memory of her mother. So, before every chapter, there‚Äôs a quote from one of those movies I used to obsessively watch when I was younger. Chapters were kinda long, ngl, I think the totality of this book (almost 400 pages) has less than 20 chapters (keep in mind that the last 2 were very short) + epilogue. Aside from these long chapters, there‚Äôs not a single thing I found uninteresting or dragging or cringe in this book. Reading some of the reviews for this book, I stumbled upon Liz hate. BUT I can‚Äôt really see why, to me, she was so adorable and relatable. Some of her weird behavior is easily justified by the situation she found herself in, the grief she‚Äôs going through. Both our love interests, Wes and Michael (a love triangle, not really, just read it), were very loveable. MICHAEL LOVES BRIDGERTON BOOKS, C‚ÄôMON! INSTANT HEART EYES FOR THAT BOY. And Wes has everything else. He‚Äôs funny, he‚Äôs supportive (that‚Äôs his best trait), he‚Äôs humble about his achievements, truly a superior male protagonist. BOOK BOYFRIEND OF THE WEEK! Even though Liz makes that joke a couple of times throughout the book, I still wouldn‚Äôt call this the enemies-to-lovers trope. There was this tiny fight around THE parking SPOT in the beginning, but it wasn‚Äôt that serious (especially considering the explanation we got at the very end of the book). So every little bad thing Wes has potentially done was for the banter, but definitely nothing major, this man is a WALKING GREEN FLAG (can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying that).\n\nYeah, they couldn‚Äôt stay friends tho, never beating those allegations!!! üíï\n\nMarch 24, 2023\n\n2nd Read\n\nI love this book sm and I think it got me out of a reading/mental slump and I'm so grateful. This was the first book I've ever annotated and it was pretty great, I just need more and better supplies.\n\n(edit: it didn't get me out of my slump, i'm still sick of everything so that's fun. but i still love the book <3)\n\nI will forever be jealous of Wes and Liz's love as I curl up into a ball and cry myself to sleep while listening to The Soundtrack of Wes and Liz\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><>\n\n‚ÄúEnemies-to-lovers‚Äîit‚Äôs our trope, Buxbaum.‚Äù\n\nAND ENEMIES TO LOVERS IS MY FAVORITE TROPE, WHAT A PERFECT MATCH.\n\nThis is one of my comfort reads now, it was so freaking adorable and fluffy ü•∞ I now want to go and rewatch rom-coms all day\n\nAlso, I made it my mission to finish this book in July, and I DID. I feel very accomplished now.\n\nThis book was basically everything I wanted: A book about rom-coms (there were quotes from rom-coms at the beginning of each chapter !!), an ENEMIES TO LOVERS, FAKE DATING, sooo much denial, and drama, drama, DRAMA.\n\nLiz is relatable in the sense that she's just trying to live life and garner the courage to ask out her life long crush and also she LOVES listening to music, something I relate to on a spiritual level. Also, you bet that I'm gonna be making a playlist of the Wes and Liz playlist shown in the back of the book. And she also loves rom-coms and SO DO I.\n\n‚ÄúI fell in love with teasing you in the second grade, when I first discovered that I could turn your cheeks pink with just a word. Then I fell in love with you.‚Äù\n\nNow. Wes. I loved him so much, and he had me screeching MULTIPLE different times. He's the bad boy next door but he's also so sweet and kind, and not really a bad boy at all, it's just that he's portrayed that way because Liz despised him. I love him so much and I want him for myself.\n\nI also really loved the family connections in this. Liz had a slightly rocky relationship with her step-mom Helena, but I love that they were able to connect, and talk, and really get the chance to learn more about each other.\n\nThe friendships in this were also GOLD. Joss seems like a great friend, and I can understand her frustrations when Liz was being a neglectful and sucky friend. Wes's friends were also really nice and sweet to Liz.\n\nNow, it was pretty chill through the book, but near the end, the drama just came pouring in and then I was reminded: Rom-coms are filled to the brim with drama. That's why I love them, besides the cute romances and cliche tropes that I just so happen to love.\n\nAlso, Wes's 'big hands' were mentioned a lot. I mean, I don't mind but it was a little repetitive, if we're gonna get nit-picky.\n\nLiz's internal denial of her feelings was hilarious, and it just had me shouting at the book, telling her to just kiss him already!\n\nAlso, I screamed at that moment in Wes's car.\n\nThis book was also funny too: a lot of the lines made me laugh, and though it could be cheesy, cringey, and cliche, isn't that what you want out of a rom-com?\n\nI loved Wes from the beginning, and while Michael seemed like a great guy, Wes was just better.\n\nI will definitely be rereading this when I am either sad or want something cute, or just want to reread this.\n\n5 stars\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe. Isn‚Äôt.

I have a feeling I'm going to spend the rest of my days waiting for my own Wes Bennett who's never going to show up. *peers across the street to the house that's on sale*\n\nI'm dramatic, I know. I can't help it.\n\nAlso, did I mention that I freaking LOVED this book??? It was everything I expected it to be (and my expectations were high)\n\nBetter than the Movies is adorable, funny, entertaining, and had me furiously reading until the last sentence. The writing style for contemporary romances can be crap (*cough* the summer I turned pretty *cough*) but Lynn Painter's writing is actually so well done!! The story never felt cheesy or forced, it all just flowed together so well.\n\nAND THE CHARACTERS ARE SO CUTEEE. I loved Liz, and I loved how she was 'different', but not in the cliche way. It really felt like she had her own personality, not a copy and paste from every other cliche main character. AND WES. I mean, come on! He was the best part of the book fr. Like... do I need to say more? ü§≠\n\nAnd I'm SO glad I bought a physical copy because I'm obsessed with the movie quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Lynn Painter is a genius, really. This book is just unbeatable.\n\nThis book made my heart happy. If you haven't already, please do yourself a favor and read this book.

Isn‚Äôt. You‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùEnemies-to-lovers‚Äîit‚Äôs our trope, Buxbaum.‚Äù\n\nas my first ya rom-com, i‚Äôm disappointed. i‚Äôd rather watch a live action movie abt all my childhood favorite cartoons than have to endure liz being annoying again (this is me being dramatic). i loved this book when i first finished reading but that was when i loved to ignore red flags. i need to learn to stop ignoring red flags in boys too but i‚Äôm much less lenient and feel like speaking my mind so be prepared!!\n\n‚Äúthis book was so cu-‚Äù until liz ruined it!! i had such high expectations after the praise this book got. but i‚Äôm not gonna lie and say this book didn‚Äôt get boring. i did like the ending tho. throughout the book, i became unsure i was gonna like it but the ending did raise my standards. the ending was the only part i liked abt this book. the rest was mediocre hence the rating. however i did find the meager taylor swift references to be cute. this is a sign to never read books purely for the taylor swift references.\n\ni had mixed feelings about liz. she is a strong, independent woman who knew she shouldn‚Äôt change for a man. however, she was still willing to do it to get what she thought was her happily ever after by chasing michael. one thing you should know abt me is that i am a hard core feminist. and i strongly believe that u should not go after a man and change yourself just to get him to like you. she made me mad at times when she wanted to hurt the people around her since she was so hurt. she also acted like the ‚Äúquirky main character‚Äù and i found her to be so annoying at times. idk how ppl can stand her bc she was the most infuriating fmc i have ever read abt.\n\nlisten to me: i love wes but he wasn‚Äôt as memorable. he was so easily forgettable imo and before u come for me, this does not mean that he‚Äôs at the bottom of my list. he was willing to sacrifice what he wanted when liz was given the opportunity to go to prom with her crush. now that‚Äôs pure selflessness on his part. he looked out for her all the time and i appreciated him. he‚Äôs an absolute sweetheart and, in my opinion, deserves so much better than liz.\n\nthis book eventually started to get boring towards the middle. there were these cute moments between liz and wes where she slowly realized he wasn‚Äôt bad and i just got bored. afterwards, it did pick up a bit and the cute moments were everything. but honestly this book was so sad? this book reminds me of miraculous ladybug and how cat noir loved ladybug for so long knowing she liked someone else. it gave off those vibes almost\n\nslight spoilers ahead from this point on !\n\ni didn‚Äôt enjoy liz and joss‚Äô friendship that much. joss was just careless about liz‚Äôs feelings. however i do think that liz triggered that whenever she decided to open up to wes rather than joss, who was her best friend. joss also completely dismissed the way liz might‚Äôve felt about going prom dress shopping and her view of life. she seemed annoyed with how liz was a hopeless romantic and her sense of style which i didn‚Äôt like considering how they‚Äôre supposed to be ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. i got the sense that their friendship was lowkey toxic..\n\nnoah and adam are probably some of my favorite side characters. even though noah hit liz in the face with a basketball, i loved noah‚Äôs humor and his sarcastic remarks. he was an awesome character and he was so considerate about liz and her feelings. adam was also funny with the way he encouraged liz to make fun of noah. overall i would not recommend this book. pls don‚Äôt come for me <3"
