        "text": "Stay Away, Joe (1968)\n\nELVIS PRESLEY - Stay Away, Joe ( New Edit ) 4K\n\nThis one hasn't aged well, mainly due to its portrayal of Native American people and culture, including Elvis in Red Face.\n\nIt revolves around Elvis as Joe Lightcloud, returning to his reservation in the American Southwest as he tries to save his tribe from poverty.\n\nSaying that, Elvis is charming as ever, but it didn't have any memorable songs.\n\nClambake (1967)\n\nClambake ≣ 1967 ≣ Trailer\n\nThis was Elvis Presley's least favourite of his own films.\n\nThe story follows Elvis as Scott, the heir of an oil company, and his hopes of escaping his privileged lifestyle.\n\nHe swaps identities with a ski instructor, and falls in love with a woman in need of money. Not a bad plot, but it's obvious Elvis's heart wasn't in this one.\n\nKissin' Cousins (1964)\n\nKissin' Cousins (1964) Official Trailer - Elvis Presley, Arthur O'Connell Movie HD\n\nThis film's title makes it sound far dodgier than it actually is, but it's still not one of Elvis's best.\n\nDirected by Star Trek's Gene Nelson, it's actually about Elvis as two cousins who face off against each other, against the backdrop of the US government building a missile launch facility in the mountains. Not one of the easiest ones to follow!\n\nTickle Me (1965)\n\nTickle Me (1965) Official Trailer - Elvis Presley, Julie Adams Movie HD\n\nYou've got to love Elvis film titles.\n\nHow Elvis Presley made the biggest-selling Christmas album of all time\n\nElvis plays a cowboy who finds a treasure map with his love interest Pam, and he;s particularly flirty in this one.\n\nSadly, it's a relatively generic film that doesn't quite get going.\n\nHarum Scarum (1965)\n\nHarum Scarum Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1965) HD\n\nFor this film, Elvis plays actor Johnny Tyrone, who gets kidnapped in the Middle East, as his adventure movies are taken seriously by his captors, who need someone to assassinate their king. It's all a bit Tropic Thunder.\n\nIt's a romp of a film, even if it's perhaps a bit too silly at times.\n\nEasy Come, Easy Go (1967)\n\nEasy Come, Easy Go (1967) Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie HD\n\nThis film featured a few cameos including Mickey Rooney, and features Elvis as a Navy officer who decides to swim down to a sunken ship to find a fortune of gold.\n\nHe has great chemistry with his opposite number as ever, but it's not one of his best soundtracks (which amazingly didn't feature a ballad, shock horror).\n\nLive A Little, Love A Little (1968)\n\nElvis Presley - A Little Less Conversation (Album Master)\n\nThis musical rom-com shows the struggles of a working-class photographer called Greg, as he works two jobs, as well as the growing love of a troubled young woman, Bernice.\n\nBernice's pursuit of Greg hasn't aged well either, but the film did include the classic Elvis tune 'A Little Less Conversation'.\n\nFun In Acapulco (1963)\n\nElvis - Fun in Acapulco\n\nHere, Elvis plays a suave lifeguard who overcomes his fear of heights.\n\nShot on location, it's a relatively generic musical, but Elvis is on fine form. It just needed a better script to elevate it.\n\nIt Happened At The World's Fair (1963)\n\nIt Happened at the World's Fair Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1963) HD\n\nThis musical comedy starred Elvis as crop duster Mike, who loses his plane in a gambling bet gone wrong.\n\nHe travels to Seattle's World Fair in hopes of changing his financial situation, and he helps a child find her uncle, while also finding love with a nurse.\n\nNo classic tunes within, but it at least showed Elvis's ability to deliver a decent dramatic performance.\n\nDouble Trouble (1967)\n\nDouble Trouble Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1967) HD\n\nThis was a much-needed lift for Elvis after a series of generic movies. He plays the cheeky Guy Lambert who tries to woo the aristocratic Jill, before finding himself in a British jewel heist.\n\nIt's one of his more fun films of the era, and features one of his best movie soundtracks.\n\nParadise, Hawaiian Style (1966)\n\nParadise, Hawaiian Style - Trailer\n\nElvis is particularly up for it in this underrated film. He plays Rick as a flirtatious helicopter pilot looking to start up a business with his pal.\n\nWhile it's still pretty simple Elvis film fodder, it does have some surprisingly excellent cinematography, including the aerial shots.\n\nGirls! Girls! Girls! (1962)\n\nGirls! Girls! Girls! - Trailer\n\nThis is another musical comedy which is bound to bring a smile to your face.\n\nElvis plays a sailor who finds himself in a love triangle with two opposing women.\n\nIt also featured one of his biggest hits of the 1960s: 'Return to Sender'.\n\nSpeedway (1968)\n\nTrailer | Speedway | Warner Archive\n\nElvis stars opposite Nancy Sinatra in this film, as car racer Steve who enters various races to gamble enough money to keep his friend Kenny out of jail.\n\nSadly, there's not too much chemistry between the pair, but Elvis puts in one of his most entertaining performances.\n\nChange Of Habit (1969)\n\nChange of Habit (1969) ORIGINAL TRAILER [HD 1080p]\n\nHere is Elvis Presley's final feature film as an actor. He plays a doctor in a poor area, who falls in love with one of the nuns who works for him.\n\nIt is one of Elvis's best dramatic performances, and co-stars TV icon Mary Tyler Moore. Not a bad way for Elvis to bow out.\n\nCharro! (1969)\n\nELVIS PRESLEY - Charro! (New Edit) 4K\n\nShock one: Elvis with a beard! Shock two: he doesn't sing!\n\nElvis attempted to go straight on this film, which is a western trying to copy Clint Eastwood with various action scenes and long scripts.\n\nWhile not perfect, it was great to see Elvis going darker than usual and allowed to act without singing for once. If only he was given more of those opportunities.\n\nSpinout (1966)\n\nSpinout Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1966) HD\n\nBefore Speedway, Elvis united racing and rock in this film, while being the object of desire of three women.\n\nHowever, Mike refuses to commit to any of them in this comedy, which is a generally likeable film.\n\nBlue Hawaii (1961)\n\nBlue Hawaii - Trailer\n\nPerhaps one of Elvis's more famous films, it follows Chadwick from the military, returning to Hawaii after his discharge.\n\nHere, he meets his love interest when he starts working as a tour guide. It was the first to start off a series of beach-themed musicals, and arguably shows Elvis at the peak of his career.\n\nBlue Hawaii is second only to the soundtrack of West Side Story as the most successful soundtrack album of the 1960s in the US.\n\nFollow That Dream (1962)\n\nElvis Presley - Follow That Dream\n\nIn this comedy film, Elvis appears alongside a group of orphans and their guardians who aim to build a home on a Florida beach.\n\nThe author of the book didn't want Elvis to be in the film, but changed his mind once he saw how good his performance was as Toby.\n\nFrankie and Johnny (1966)\n\nFrankie and Johnny (1966) - Frankie and Johnny Scene (12/12) | Movieclips\n\nFor this western comedy, Elvis played a gambler who works at a riverboat casino with his girlfriend.\n\nWhen a fortuneteller says he'll get lucky with a red-headed woman, his girlfriend isn't happy. Cue a love triangle.\n\nGirl Happy (1965)\n\nGirl Happy Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1965) HD\n\nThis film is centred a young woman named Valerie (Shelley Fabares), who is being followed by singer Rusty Wells (Elvis), because her father paid him to look out for her.\n\nOf course, he falls in love with her, and helps her run away from her father's control.\n\nIt had some great songs in it, including the hit 'Puppet on a String', and one of his best films of the mid-60s.\n\nThe Trouble With Girls (1969)\n\nThe Trouble With Girls Trailer 1969\n\nTowards the end of his film career, Elvis put in a brilliant performance as Walter, a manager of an entertainer group.\n\nThe film takes on subjects like murder and politics, and has gained a cult following over the years.\n\nRoustabout (1964)\n\nELVIS PRESLEY-ROUSTABOUT (MOVIE TRAILER)\n\nFor this film, Charlie (Elvis), is an unemployed singer who runs away to sing for a traveling circus, opposite Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nIt was one of the more successful box office hits of his career, and the soundtrack isn't half bad either.\n\nWild In The Country (1961)\n\nElvis Presley - Scene from the movie Wild in the Country (1961) HD Part 3\n\nThis romantic film follows the story of Glenn, a man who needs help after starting a fight with his brother.\n\nWhat could have been a brilliant dramatic film for Elvis was somewhat dampened by the placing of musical numbers, but he's still great in it.\n\nLove Me Tender (1956)\n\nElvis Presley -Love Me Tender (Movie Trailer)\n\nElvis's film debut was as a supporting star in this romantic drama.\n\nThe film centres around a group of confederate soldiers who decide to rob a Union train.\n\nIt was obviously helped by the title track 'Love Me Tender', and was one of his most memorable films.\n\nKid Galahad (1962)\n\nKid Galahad 1962 Original Trailer\n\nElvis put in an acclaimed performance in this boxing musical. He starred as Walter, a broke man who takes on the job of a sparring partner to make money.\n\nCharles Bronson also stars in the film, and while Elvis was perhaps not quite the right actor for the role of a boxer, it is perhaps his greatest dramatic performance.\n\nFlaming Star (1960)\n\nElvis Presley Flaming Star original trailer\n\nThis drama sees Elvis playing a man named Pacer Burton, who lives on the Texas Frontier with his white father and Kiowa mother.\n\nRacial tension rises after a group of racists stop Burton's mother from getting medical care, resulting in her death.\n\nIt was just the kind of dramatic role that Elvis was searching for, and he had a great partnership on screen with Steve Forrest as his brother.\n\nLoving You (1957)\n\nElvis Presley - Loving You 1957 -Trailer\n\nThis was Elvis Presley's first major role in a film, and he puts in a great performance as Deke, a working-class man who is discovered by musical talent agents.\n\nThe romcom also features big hits including '(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear' and the title track.\n\nG.I. Blues (1960)\n\nG.I. Blues - Trailer\n\nIn this memorable film, Elvis plays Tulsa McLean as a soldier who hopes to open a nightclub after he leaves West Germany.\n\nElvis had himself just finished his military career when he starred in the musical, which certainly helped his performance.\n\nThe musical also featured 'Blue Suede Shoes' and 'Wooden Heart', and was a big success.\n\nJailhouse Rock (1957)\n\nJAILHOUSE ROCK (1957) - Elvis Presley - Classic Movie Musical Numbers\n\nPerhaps his most iconic film? The musical drama follows Vince Everett's wrongful arrest and prison stay, as he meets a man who says he can be a music star.\n\nIt was arguably the ultimate Elvis film at the peak of his powers, and the set designs and musical numbers are fantastic.\n\nViva Las Vegas (1964)\n\nViva Las Vegas Official Trailer #1 - Elvis Presley Movie (1964) HD\n\nIf you're looking for the ultimate Elvis Presley movie experience, look no further.\n\nThe musical stars Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret, and the two are excellent opposite each other.\n\nLucky Jackson (Elvis) goes to Vegas hoping to win enough money to buy a car that will help him win the Grand Prix. Classic.\n\nIt was a box office hit, and has become one of his Elvis's most loved films. It's gorgeous to look at, has some cracking songs, and is one of the most underrated films of the decade."
