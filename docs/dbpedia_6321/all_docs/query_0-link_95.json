        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThe \"To All the Boys\" series ended with \"Always and Forever,\" but fans might also enjoy these films.\n\nTry watching other Netflix original rom-coms, like \"Set it Up\" and \"The Perfect Date.\"\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"Love, Simon\" have similar vibes to the Netflix trilogy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Set It Up\" (2018) may have revitalized the romantic comedy.\n\n\"Set It Up\" stars Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell as two overworked assistants who set up their overbearing bosses so they can live their lives.\n\nTheir scheme to keep the seemingly perfect-together couple together begins to go awry, but they end up growing closer themselves.\n\nDavid Dims from The Atlantic wrote that \"Set It Up\" might just be, \"the start of a genuine realignment within the [rom-com] industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018) is a rom-com with an all-Asian cast.\n\nThe authors of both \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before\" revealed how Hollywood was intent on whitewashing their lead actresses in the film adaptations.\n\nIn the end, Kevin Kwan and Jenny Han prevailed and were able to bring the representation problem to the foreground in Hollywood.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians\" features an all-Asian cast that follows Rachel, played by Constance Wu, as she butts heads with her fiancé's exorbitantly-rich mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Love, Simon\" (2018) is a coming-of-age story and a romantic comedy all in one.\n\nThis delightful high-school rom-com follows the online romance of Simon, played by Nick Robinson, and the mysterious \"Blue.\"\n\nThe titular character is getting tired of hiding his identity from his friends and family when suddenly his letters to Blue go viral.\n\nHe navigates this unplanned and emotional coming-out process while also trying to find out Blue's true identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ultimate rom-com, \"When Harry Met Sally\" (1989), should be on your viewing list.\n\nThe iconic 1977 film, which tells the story of \"enemies to lovers,\" is one of the most beloved romantic comedies ever made.\n\nIt's based on Nora Ephron's real-life experience, and the goofy, natural conversations between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal's characters lead to dynamite chemistry for a couple you'll be rooting for the entire movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sixteen Candles\" (1984) is Lara Jean's favorite movie, though it hasn't exactly aged well.\n\nThis 1980s coming-of-age classic — which happens to be Lara Jean's favorite movie — follows Molly Ringwald's character's quest for love in the shadow of her sister's wedding.\n\nThe film made this list because it played such an important role in shaping Lara Jean's ideas about love, but it has become outdated.\n\nIt, unfortunately, contains a racist depiction of an Asian character, which Lara Jean points out herself, and Ringwald has also admitted that some of the film's lines are particularly troublesome in the light of the #MeToo movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Friends with Benefits\" (2011) also shows what happens when two people vow not to fall for each other.\n\nIn \"Friends With Benefits,\" Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis' characters decide to start casually hooking up, but they promise not to fall for each other.\n\nObviously, feelings emerge, and the two struggle to figure out a way to make a real relationship work after their farce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Cusack's character in \"Better Off Dead\" (1985) has a similar character arc to Peter Kavinsky.\n\nIn this offbeat teen comedy, John Cusack's character can't get over his popular ex-girlfriend.\n\nLike \"TATBILB,\" \"Better Off Dead\" also happens to feature a high-stakes ski trip, and Cusack's character develops a new crush right when his ex comes crawling back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Pride and Prejudice\" (2005) is about the courtship of two extremely stubborn lovers.\n\nPeter and Lara Jean have trouble admitting their feelings toward each other, much like Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy in \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\n\nAnd if Peter valued his popularity more, it would be similar to the class difference that Elizabeth and Darcy face.\n\nThe 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen, is a great place to start if you're new to the story. But if you're looking for more, the 1995 miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth is a great option as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFake-to-real love is also the plot of \"10 Things I Hate About You\" (1999).\n\nThis rom-com, based on Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" features an abrasive teen, played by Julia Stiles, who falls for the high-school bad boy, played by Heath Ledger — but she doesn't know that her sister's love interest is paying him to take her on dates.\n\n\"10 Things I Hate About You\" also features an iconic scene on a sports field, like \"TATBILB.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Saving Face\" (2004) is an adorable movie about bucking social expectations.\n\nTwo Chinese-American women, played by Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen, fall in love years after a childhood encounter in this sweet romantic comedy.\n\n\"Saving Face\" examines the multi-generational and cultural norms of the main character's family as she and her mother both enter uncharted territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a lot of scheming in \"Easy A\" (2010).\n\nIn \"Easy A,\" Emma Stone's character fuels the fake rumors of her sleeping around by branding herself with an \"A\" for adulterer, like Hester Prynne in \"The Scarlet Letter.\"\n\nInitially done to protect a friend, Stone knows when she's gone too far in her fake scandal — much like when Lara Jean has the revelation that she loves Peter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"13 Going on 30\" (2004) begins with a game of seven minutes in heaven.\n\nLike the spin-the-bottle game that foreshadowed the relationship between Peter and Lara Jean, seven minutes in heaven serves as the life-changing event that sparks the romance for Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo's characters in \"13 Going on 30.\"\n\nBoth couples also bond over one character's craving for a favorite snack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nMovie Movies\n\nAdvertisement"
