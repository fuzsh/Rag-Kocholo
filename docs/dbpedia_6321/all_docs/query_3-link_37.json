        "text": "The RunPee app tells you the best times to\n\nrun & pee during a movie\n\nso you don't miss the best scenes.\n\nMovie Review – The Forge\n\nI love it when I’m dreading a movie and it turns out to be outstanding. That is precisely what happened with The Forge. What a strong, powerful, heartwarming story. Luckily, my granddaughter was there to see it with me, and it reached her. She could see what hard work, determination, and the right attitude can […]\n\nMovie Review – Blink Twice\n\nBlink Twice was so-so. It had the potential to be really good but the lack of chemistry between the characters annoyed me to the point of disrupting the entire flow of the movie. The story was good. There were cool plot twists, surprises, and even a few chuckles. Sadly, that wasn’t enough to make the […]\n\nIs there anything extra during the end credits of The Crow?\n\nNo, there are not any extra scenes during, or after, the end credits of The Crow. View details and movie information…\n\nMovie Review – The Crow\n\nThis is not a movie review. This is a warning. There’s nothing worth seeing in this movie. If you’re a big fan of Bill Skarsgård, do yourself a favor and watch Boy Kills World. (Streaming on YouTube | Amazon for $5.99). There are spoilers ahead because… Why not. If you haven’t seen this movie yet […]\n\nTV Series Review – Shōgun\n\nThere is a lot to love about Shōgun. It has amazing sets Fantastic cinematography Brilliant acting Compelling story But to me, the thing that stands out the most about Shōgun is the character building. Bad writers create one-dimensional characters that are likeable or unlikable. Good writers create characters that are unlikable but become likable, or vice […]\n\nMovie Review – Alien: Romulus\n\nThis movie was clearly made to appeal to the Gen-Z generation. And if it fails we’ll be able to say: Gen-Z exterminated the alien threat. Every character, save one, is in their 20s. The cast is a collection of young adults trying to escape a life of servitude. The good If you’re a lifelong Aliens […]\n\nThe brother and sister team behind the Peetimes\n\nA RunPee fan recently commented that he thought the RunPee app was just another app created by an app farm to make money. He was delighted to discover that it’s a bootstrapped company created and maintained by a small family. RunPee: A Brief History You can read the details here, but the idea for the […]\n\nMovie Review – It Ends with Us\n\nIt Ends With Us was phenomenal. Blake Lively gave this character her all, you felt every little emotion she felt, her chemistry made the screen spark. I love her, I don’t think she’s ever done anything under exceptional. This role was no different, she owned it. I did not know anything about it when I […]"
