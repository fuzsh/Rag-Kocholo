        "text": "Seven of the 11 top-grossing films of 2017 were superhero movies, based on characters first introduced in comic books.\n\nThe top two grossing films so far this year have been “Black Panther” and “Avengers: Infinity War.” “Deadpool 2” is in theaters, and “Ant-Man and the Wasp” opened on Friday. None of these are minor productions.\n\nWe are living in Hollywood’s Comic Book Age. A global obsession, superhero movies are seen by hundreds of millions, arguably the most consumed stories in human history.\n\nFilms reflect the tastes and values of the period in which they are made. We can trace the changing status of women, evolving ideas about masculinity, war, crime, journalism, the C.I.A. or anything else by Hollywood treatments over the decades. So when historians look back at this glut of superhero flicks, what will they say about us? What are they about?\n\nThere is no rule, of course, that says films have to be about anything. One way of looking at comic book movies is to see them simply as mental popcorn, meant to be rapidly consumed and forgotten — this may be precisely why so many people love them. They are harmless. Armies of Hollywood professionals get paid, megamillions enjoy them and nobody gets hurt. Even snooty critics have fun inventing clever ways to slam them.\n\nMost fail to make sense even within the fantastical logic of their own worlds — why, for instance, do superheroes and villains persist in hurling large objects at each other long after it is clear this has no effect? They showcase beautiful bodies in well-choreographed combat augmented by ear-blasting pseudo-Wagnerian music and dazzling special effects. Plot lines are an afterthought, and dialogue is often breezily incoherent (particularly when trying to impart deeper meaning). They are formulaic, completely driven by commercial calculation, largely written by committees under strict studio supervision (which is not to say that committees are incapable of writing great scripts — see the amazing Pixar oeuvre). They are full of sound and fury — imaginatively costumed, star-studded, often well acted, stunningly crafted — signifying nothing, at least on purpose.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
