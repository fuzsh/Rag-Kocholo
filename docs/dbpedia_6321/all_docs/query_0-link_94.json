        "text": "Featured Image: Moonlight, ©2016, A24.\n\nAlex Ackerman\n\nThe question of representation and stereotypes in Hollywood has long affected film criticism and how scholars approach their analysis. When one considers the history of black cinema and its relation to mainstream media, one can see the only-recent trends of black filmmakers using their voices to relate different lenses of their experience, rather than being portrayed stereotypically by and for a white audience. With the growing prominence of black filmmakers and narratives, the issue of masculinity and its portrayal on-screen has raised certain criticism from those who perceive this depiction to be feeding into stereotypes of black hypermasculinity, as well as a white cinematic paradigm (Wiegman 164). One film that subverts this traditional representation of masculinity within the black experience is Barry Jenkins’ film Moonlight. Moonlight challenges the notion of black hypermasculinity into which white stereotypes often force black men, as Jenkins constructs and develops the relationship between two black men.\n\nMasculinity, though not inherently harmful in and of itself, has played a critical role in the manifestation of misogyny, and the “distortion of [traditionally ‘masculine’] traits in the masculine norm and the exclusion of other traits (associated with femininity) are oppressive and destructive” (Kaufman 2). As such, hypermasculinity is the culmination of gendered masculine traits, resulting in a limited ability to express one’s emotions and an increased likelihood of relating to others through aggression. As it relates to black manhood, hypermasculinity stands out as a prominent means of defining what a ‘man’ is within the black community, serving as both a product of and a response to white stereotypes based on justifying racial violence.\n\nMoonlight, ©2016, A24.\n\nIn response to this narrow confinement of black manhood, Jenkins, as both screenwriter and director, offers a counter-narrative that subverts white projections of black manhood that can be visualized in black cinema as well. Crucial to this discussion is intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, professor of law at Columbia Law School and the University of California, Los Angeles. Chiron’s race and sexuality, and their portrayal within the film, are key to Moonlight and inform the viewer’s understanding of its meaning. Therefore, when discussing and dissecting the film, one cannot separate the two from each other, especially relating to Chiron’s journey and his relation to manhood and masculinity.\n\nWithin the narrative, Jenkins relays the reality of the effect of living as a black man in the context of a poverty and violence-filled environment. Chiron, also known as Little and Black in the triptych-structured narrative, transitions from a young boy, innocent and mocked by his peers, to a grown man who is now a drug dealer, similarly to his father figure, Juan, who is revealed to be killed in the second part of the narrative.\n\nIn the midst of his tumultuous adolescence, Chiron, performed by Ashton Sanders, experiences small moments of intimacy that enable him to question the dominant mode of masculine expression in his environment. Though Chiron’s characterization alone encapsulates the subversion of and adherence to traditional masculinity, the moment between Chiron and Kevin on the beach is key to addressing the intersection between race and sexuality, as the two characters explore how they and others navigate their roles and genuine identities in their daily lives.\n\nWithin the scene, Chiron and Kevin sit beside each other on the sand, and the camera captures their interaction in a series of over the shoulder shots. This use of the shot and the cut contributes to the sense of intimacy between the two in the moment, especially since on the periphery of the frame, the character not in the center can still be seen.\n\nThese over the shoulder shots work in conjunction with the dialogue, further emphasizing the intimacy between the two characters and offering a moment of vulnerability that contradicts the stoicism typical of hypermasculine expression. For example, in a crucial moment of tenderness, the two adolescents discuss what it means to cry and how they are able to express their emotions. In responding to Kevin’s question of “What you cry about?” Chiron answers, “Shit, I cry so much sometimes I feel like I’ma just turn into drops” (Moonlight). In response, Kevin responds, “Think you can just roll out into the water right? Roll out into the water like these other [people] trying to drown they sorrows” (Moonlight). This use of dialogue subverts traditional masculinity in the vulnerability and openness of their conversation concerning an action characterized as feminine. In this moment of genuine connection, Chiron expresses his emotions rather than maintaining a façade of confidence that hypermasculinity requires. Furthermore, this expression is particularly important due to the intersection of race and sexuality. As a black man, Chiron is expected to conform to hypermasculine roles, but his difference in sexuality complicates his ability and desire to do so. Thus, this scene, through its construction of the shot and the cut and the dialogue, reveals Jenkins’ commentary on the necessity of intimate and genuine moments such as these for men in the black community, especially in environments portrayed in the film.\n\nAnother key aspect of the scene is the symbolism of water, both in this scene and others. In the dialogue, water is used as a vehicle of giving voice to the pain and other emotions that Chiron feels, including the vulnerability expressed about crying. The use of blue lighting and the background noise of the surf emphasize the role of water in this crucial moment of intimacy, further contrasting this important moment with how society forces men in vulnerable positions to be hypermasculine. The presence of water in moments where Chiron is most human and able to be himself illuminates Jenkins’ subversion of traditional masculinity, enabling a more fluid understanding of manhood and identity.\n\nMoonlight is a film that illuminates the “complex cultural codes” of the experience of a black, gay man, operating within the reality that many face in order to offer a new perspective on what it means not only to be part of a specific identity but also what it means to be human (Wiegman 159).\n\nBibliography\n\nBond, Margot. “‘Moonlight’: The Problem with Boys Being Boys.” Gender and Diversity in Film ENGL 359. 8 March 2019.\n\nCrenshaw, Kimberlé. “Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics.” University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1989 , Article 8. https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclf/vol1989/iss1/8\n\nHarris, Liz. “The ‘Real Indian’ Man as Constructed through a Real Indian’s Stereotype.” Gender and Diversity in Film ENGL 359. 8 March 2019.\n\nJenkins, Barry, director.
