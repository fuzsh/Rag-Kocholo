        "text": "The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan issued or announced sanctions targeting Russia and the Russia-backed separatist regions of Ukraine known as the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic. The United States took the first step by issuing broad jurisdiction-based sanctions on the two regions, similar to the existing sanctions on the Crimea region of Ukraine, and followed up with additional sanctions targeting Russia’s financial system. NATO allies also announced sanctions—including targeted designations by the United Kingdom and a sanctions package by the European Union—and non-NATO allies promised tough sanctions in close coordination. As tensions continue to rise, we will likely see more series of tools from the NATO countries and their allies to exert economic pressure on Russia to deescalate the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and withdraw its army from Ukraine’s borders.\n\nHear from our experts about these developments and how companies should proactively assess their exposure to the sanctions and export controls measures being discussed.\n\nView Slides (PDF)\n\nMODERATOR:\n\nJudith Alison Lee is a partner in the Washington, D.C. office and Co-Chair of the firm’s International Trade Practice Group.
