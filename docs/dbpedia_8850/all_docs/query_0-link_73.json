        "text": "| Updated: Dec 16, 2021, 09:54 PM IST\n\nMoscow has cultivated close ties with pro-Russian rebels controlling swathes of the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine but denies being a party to their seven-year war with Ukrainian government forces.\n\nHere are some examples of how the two rebel-controlled areas, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, have grown closer to Russia since the conflict erupted in 2014.\n\nRussian passport\n\nA Russian lawmaker said in July that Moscow had issued more than 600,000 Russian passports to Donbass residents since President Vladimir Putin signed an order in April 2019 allowing them to apply for citizenship under an expedited procedure.\n\nThe European Union at the time said the measure was an attack on Ukrainian sovereignty, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for more sanctions against Moscow.\n\nZelenskiy in May described Moscow's initiative as a first step towards annexation of the region.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\nRussian ruble coins and banknotes\n\nA former senior official from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic said in 2016 that Russia directly finances pensions and public sector salaries in eastern Ukraine's two separatist regions.\n\nAfter war broke out, Kyiv stopped paying public sector wages to people registered as living in separatist-controlled areas. Much of the heavy industry on which the Donbass depends for revenue has stopped operating.\n\nMoscow says it does not bankroll the separatist administrations.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\nSchoolchildren in the bastion of Ukraine's pro-Russian rebels\n\nBoth separatist regions have abandoned the Ukrainian hryvnia in favour of the Russian rouble as their official currencies.\n\nLocal schools now follow the Russian national curriculum instead of that taught in Ukraine.\n\nLast year, the Donetsk People's Republic marked Russia Day on June 12, which is a national holiday in Russia to commemorate Russia's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.\n\nSchoolchildren in the bastion of Ukraine's pro-Russian rebels say they risk forgetting their country's official language after years of war and an onslaught of Kremlin propaganda.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\n\nPutin last month ordered the government to lift curbs on exports and imports of goods between Russia and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian authorities said the move was designed to compensate for the economic blockage between those regions and the rest of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry said the Putin's decree amounted to \"gross interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine\" and sent a protest to the Russian foreign ministry.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\n;\n\nUnited Russia party\n\nUnited Russia, the ruling party that supports Putin, campaigned in eastern Ukraine on territory controlled by Moscow-backed separatists ahead of parliamentary elections in September.\n\nWhile Kyiv cast the initiative as a form of \"Russification\", Moscow said there is nothing unusual about people with dual Russian and Ukrainian nationality voting in a Russian election.\n\nThe Russian electorate in Donbass overwhelmingly supports the ruling party.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\nUkraine-Russia conflict\n\nLocal authorities in Donetsk said in January this year that Russia had begun supplying its Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19 to rebel-controlled Donetsk despite a ban by Kyiv.\n\nUkraine, which prohibits the use of Russia's Sputnik, said at the time it had been expecting a shipment of Western-made vaccines.\n\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets the Sputnik vaccine abroad, said it did not supply the Donetsk or Luhansk breakaway regions.\n\n(Photograph: AFP )\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\n\n(Photograph: AFP )"
