        "text": "Foreign Secretary announces 178 new sanctions, coordinated with the EU, targeting those who prop up Russian-backed illegal breakaway regions of Ukraine\n\nUK announces sanctions targeting oligarch family members, close associates, and employees\n\nsecondary legislation to be laid this week banning the import of steel and iron products and export of luxury goods\n\nThe UK government is sanctioning 178 individuals in coordination with the EU – targeting those who prop up Russian-backed illegal breakaway regions of Ukraine.\n\nThis comes after multiple reports last week that Russia was barbarically targeting civilians in those regions.\n\nIndividuals sanctioned include Alexander Ananchenko and Sergey Kozlov, self-styled Prime Minister and Chair of Government of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.\n\nFurther family members of Russian oligarchs have been targeted today as the UK government sanctions Pavel Ezubov, cousin of Oleg Deripaska, and Nigina Zairova, Executive Assistant to Mikhail Fridman.\n\nIn total the government is sanctioning 206 individuals today, including the 178 separatists, six oligarchs, close associates and employees, and an additional 22 individuals through the urgent procedure. Since the unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine began in February, the UK has sanctioned over 1,400 individuals and businesses – including over 100 oligarchs and family members.\n\nToday’s announcement comes ahead of the laying of secondary legislation in Parliament tomorrow (Thursday 14 April), which will ban the import of iron and steel products as well as the export of quantum technologies, advanced materials and luxury goods. These new measures target key revenue sources for Putin’s war machine and thwart Russia’s military ambitions.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss said:\n\nIn the wake of horrific rocket attacks on civilians in Eastern Ukraine, we are today sanctioning those who prop up the illegal breakaway regions and are complicit in atrocities against the Ukrainian people. We will continue to target all those who aid and abet Putin’s war.\n\nFrom tomorrow, we are banning the import of Russian iron and steel, as well as the export of quantum technologies and advanced materials that Putin sorely needs. We will not rest in our mission to stop Putin’s war machine in its tracks.\n\nThe UK has led the international sanctions effort, cutting off whole sectors of the Russian economy by targeting its defence companies, its trade and transport sector, and working with allies to exclude Russia from the SWIFT financial system.\n\nSanctions imposed by the UK and its international partners are having deep and damaging consequences for Putin’s ability to wage war. Analysis shows Russia is heading for the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union with £275 billion – 60% of Russian foreign currency reserves – currently frozen.\n\nBackground\n\nAsset freeze\n\nAn asset freeze prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources which are owned, held or controlled by the designated person and which are held in the UK. It will also prevent funds or economic resources being provided to or for the benefit of the designated person.\n\nTravel ban\n\nA travel ban means that the designated person must be refused leave to enter or to remain in the United Kingdom, providing the individual is an excluded person under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.\n\nTransport sanctions\n\nRecently introduced powers make it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft to fly or land in the UK, and give the government powers to remove aircraft belonging to designated Russian individuals and entities from the UK aircraft register, even if the sanctioned individual is not on board. Russian ships are also banned from UK ports.\n\nIndividuals and entities sanctioned\n\nStandard designations:\n\nNigina Zairova, Executive Assistant to Mikhail Fridman.
