        "text": "Inside the city council chamber in Donetsk, the head of housing was reassuring his colleagues about the state of the municipal drains. Outside the door was a less ordinary scene.\n\nMasked men armed with clubs, old shotguns and a Kalashnikov assault rifle were standing guard.\n\nThe city hall did its best to continue business as usual after pro-Russian separatists occupied the premises. A few dozen grimly silent men, clad in black balaclavas, faded camouflage fatigues and bullet-proof vests, took over without any violence or opposition.\n\nThey have already proclaimed the birth of the “Donetsk People’s Republic” in this eastern Ukrainian city of one million people. In theory, a “People’s Council” now rules Donetsk and the surrounding region, with a population of 4.5 million. The city hall has become the latest public building to fall to the “People’s Republic”.\n\nIts self-styled representatives demanded a referendum on whether their new state should follow Crimea’s example and abolish itself by joining Russia.\n\n“We are carrying out the will of the people,” said a member of the group’s coordinating council, who gave his name as Denis. “Over 90 per cent of the people of Donetsk region are supporting separation from Ukraine because Ukraine wants to control all our factories and businesses for the benefit of oligarchs.”\n\nThe post-revolutionary government in Kiev, he added, was “killing our people, including a pregnant woman”. The “mass media” was deliberately ignoring the atrocities perpetrated by Ukraine’s new pro-Western rulers, he said.\n\n“We ask for a referendum on the status of Donetsk region,” added Denis, surrounded by masked comrades. If such a contest were held, he personally would vote for union with Russia.\n\nUkraine’s government and Western leaders say that Russia has organised the occupations in Donetsk region, including by deploying special forces in the area. The men in the council building, however, appeared to be locals, not Russian soldiers. Amid the baseball bats and shotguns, the only military-grade weapon at their disposal was a single Kalashnikov.\n\nThe takeover did not exactly proceed with military precision. A few hours after Denis and his accomplices had entered city hall, they were threatened with attack by a different pro-Russian faction.\n\nArmed pro-Russia activists stand guard on April 16 (AFP)\n\nAbout 30 men wearing miners’ helmets and armed with clubs marched on the building, apparently convinced that the occupiers were not pro-Russians at all, but supporters of Right Sector, a radical Ukrainian nationalist movement.\n\nDenis and his friends had to point out that they were all on the same side.\n\nAlexander Lukyanchenko, the mayor of Donetsk, appeared for an afternoon council meeting.\n\nWithout mentioning the armed men outside the chamber, Mr Lukyanchenko declared: “The heads of the departments of housing and residential affairs are here with an agenda of 19 items. Are there any changes? No. The speeches will last for seven minutes each.”\n\nHe then handed the floor to the head of housing, who declared that Donetsk’s drains were in excellent condition after the recent expenditure of £500,000.\n\n“Notwithstanding the political, economic and social conditions, the condition of our infrastructure is fine,” said the official.\n\nHaving taken over the city hall, its new masters began to fortify the building against any attempt by Kiev to restore central control."
