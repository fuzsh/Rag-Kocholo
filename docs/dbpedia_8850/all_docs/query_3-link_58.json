        "text": "In response to the Russian Federation’s (Russia’s) further invasion of Ukraine and to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, the Department of Commerce established highly restrictive license requirements for certain transactions involving Russia and Belarus under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). To recognize partner countries implementing similar export controls on Russia and Belarus, the Department of Commerce published a list of countries excluded from certain U.S. export controls related to foreign-produced items.\n\nIn this rule, the Department of Commerce added Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland to the list of excluded countries.\n\nOFAC issued a new FAQ regarding credit card system operators and the Russia and Belarus sanctions:\n\n1030. What obligations do operators of credit card systems have under the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 587 (RuHSR), and the Belarus Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. part 548 (BSR), with regard to payment cards issued by sanctioned Russian financial institutions?\n\nAnswer\n\nPursuant to the RuHSR and BSR, U.S. persons, including U.S. operators of credit card systems and U.S. acquirers, are prohibited from processing transactions involving certain sanctioned foreign financial institutions, unless exempt or authorized by OFAC. Non-U.S. operators of credit card systems whose payment cards are issued by sanctioned foreign financial institutions may also be in violation of OFAC-administered sanctions regulations if they allow those cards to be used in the United States.\n\nOFAC encourages U.S. persons, including U.S. operators of credit card systems and U.S. acquirers, to exercise caution and due diligence in dealing with non-U.S. operators of credit card systems that are known to host payment cards issued by sanctioned foreign financial institutions and whose payment cards are accepted in the United States. Examples of due diligence measures may include requesting Bank Identification Numbers (BINs) associated with sanctioned foreign financial institutions, disabling those BINs from operation in the United States, and requesting that non-U.S. operators of credit card systems prevent the use of payment cards issued by sanctioned foreign financial institutions in the United States at the network level.\n\nOFAC issued General License 31 authorizing certain transactions related to Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights including (1) the filing and prosecution of IP applications; (2) the receipt of IP protection; (3) the renewal or maintenance of IP protection; and (4) the filing and prosecution of any opposition or infringement proceeding with respect to IP, and entrance of a defense to any such proceeding.\n\nOFAC also issued FAQ 1009.\n\n1009. Does Executive Order (E.O.) 14065 block the entire Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts?\n\nAnswer\n\nNo. E.O. 14065 targets the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine or such other regions of Ukraine as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State (collectively, the “Covered Regions”). In determining whether a location is within the regions subject to sanctions, U.S. persons may reasonably rely on vetted information from reliable third parties, such as postal codes and maps.\n\nU.S. persons engaging in activity that does not involve the Covered Regions are not subject to the prohibitions in E.O. 14065. Please see FAQ 1006 for what prohibitions apply to the Covered Regions.\n\nIn March 2022 BIS created the Supplement No. 4 list in Part 736, to prohibit the export, reexport, or in-country transfer to or within Russia of specified items included on the list. Effective May 9, BIS added hundreds of new items to the Supplement No. 4 list through the addition of 478 ten-digit Schedule B codes and 205 six-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (“HTS”) codes.\n\nThe HTS and Schedule B codes “are only intended to assist exporters with their AES filing responsibilities and does not indicate that all items classified under those HTS Codes or Schedule B numbers are subject to § 746.5(a)(1)(ii)’s restrictions.” Rather, only those items described under the “HTS Description” column are controlled by the strict liability provisions of the Russian Industry Sector Sanctions.\n\nBIS noted this approach is consistent with comparable controls imposed by the European Union.\n\nAdditions to the list include, but are not limited to, building materials, machinery, engines, industrial tooling, cooling and ventilation equipment and a variety of other items. All license applications for exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items “subject to the EAR” and listed on the Supplement No. 4 list will be reviewed by BIS under a presumption of denial license review policy.\n\nOFAC amended the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515 (CACR) to further implement portions of the President’s foreign policy toward Cuba.\n\nOFAC also published a number of new and updated Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nNEW FAQ – Cuban Assets Control Regulations\n\n1056. What does the June 9, 2022 amendment to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) do?\n\nAnswer\n\nEffective June 9, 2022, in consultation with the Department of State, OFAC amended the CACR to implement elements of policy changes announced by the Administration on May 16, 2022 to increase support for the Cuban people.\n\nProfessional meetings and conferences in Cuba: Effective June 9, 2022, OFAC amended 31 CFR § 515.564(a) to include a general license authorizing, subject to conditions, travel-related and other transactions incident to attending or organizing professional meetings or conferences in Cuba, such as professional meetings or conferences to support expanded internet access and remittance processing and to provide additional support and training to independent Cuban entrepreneurs. OFAC also amended and added cross-references to § 515.564(a) in notes to §§ 515.534, 515.542, 515.547, 515.572, 515.577, and 515.591.\n\nGroup people-to-people and other academic educational activities: Effective June 9, 2022, OFAC amended § 515.565(a) to remove certain restrictions on authorized academic educational activities. OFAC also amended § 515.565(b) to authorize group people-to-people educational travel conducted under the auspices of an organization that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and that sponsors such exchanges to promote people-to-people contact, provided such travelers are accompanied by an employee, paid consultant, or agent of the sponsoring organization. Travel-related transactions authorized pursuant to § 515.565(b) must be for the purpose of engaging, while in Cuba, in a full-time schedule of activities that are intended to enhance contact with the Cuban people, support civil society in Cuba, or promote the Cuban people’s independence from Cuban authorities; and will result in meaningful interactions with individuals in Cuba. This amendment does not authorize individual people-to-people travel. Travel for tourist activities is not permitted.\n\nRemittances: Effective June 9, 2022, OFAC amended § 515.570(a) to remove the $1,000 quarterly limit on family remittances to Cuban nationals who are close relatives. OFAC also added § 515.570(b) to authorize donative remittances to Cuban nationals who are not prohibited officials of the Government of Cuba, prohibited members of the Cuban Communist Party, or close relatives of a prohibited official of the Government of Cuba or prohibited member of the Cuban Communist Party. Finally, OFAC added a general license in § 515.570(h) authorizing the unblocking and return of previously blocked remittances, provided they would be authorized under the revised § 515.570(a) or (b).\n\nUpdated FAQS – Cuban Assets Control Regulations\n\n695.

What constitutes generally authorized travel-related transactions for “professional research and professional meetings” in Cuba?\n\n702. What constitutes “educational activities” for generally authorized travel and other transactions?\n\n704. Can travelers engage in “people-to-people travel” to Cuba on an individual basis or as a part of a group?\n\n770. What types of goods and services produced by independent Cuban entrepreneurs are authorized for importation into the United States from Cuba pursuant to 31 CFR § 515.582?\n\n732. What types of remittances are allowed to be made by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to persons in Cuba? What are the applicable conditions and requirements?\n\nOFAC published new Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nRussian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions\n\n1067. Do the prohibitions imposed by the determination made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14071 on May 8, 2022, “Prohibitions Related to Certain Accounting, Trust and Corporate Formation, and Management Consulting Services” (“the determination”), prohibit U.S. persons from providing software related to accounting, management consulting, or trust and corporate formation to persons located in the Russian Federation?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe determination does not prohibit U.S. persons from exporting, reexporting, selling, or supplying, directly or indirectly, software to the Russian Federation, nor does the determination prohibit U.S. persons from providing services associated with the export of such software, such as software design and engineering, provided that such associated services do not fall within the categories of management consulting, accounting, or trust and corporate formation.\n\nFor example, the following scenario describes activities that would not be prohibited under the determination:\n\nA U.S. software company signs a contract with a company located in the Russian Federation (“Russian company”) for design, engineering, licensing, and delivery of software that the Russian company uses to perform its internal accounting. As part of the contract, the U.S. company provides continuing updates and technical support services related to the software (setting up new users, troubleshooting errors, etc.).\n\nThe following scenarios illustrate activities that would be prohibited under the determination:\n\nA U.S. management consulting company signs a contract with a Russian company to assist the Russian company in selecting a new enterprise application software. This contract includes assessing the needs of the Russian company, providing a list of possible software choices to the company, and providing continuing advisory services on the implementation and use of the software to optimize the Russian company’s profits.\n\nRussian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions\n\n1066. Do the prohibitions imposed by the determination made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14071 on May 8, 2022, “Prohibitions Related to Certain Accounting, Trust and Corporate Formation, and Management Consulting Services,” prohibit the provision of educational services, such as online university courses, on the subjects of accounting, management consulting, or trust and corporate formation to persons located in the Russian Federation?\n\nAnswer\n\nNo, provided such services do not evade or avoid the prohibition on providing the underlying services to persons located in the Russian Federation.\n\nRussian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions\n\n1058. For the purposes of section 1(a)(ii) of Executive Order (E.O.) 14071, what is meant by the term “person located in the Russian Federation”?\n\nAnswer\n\nFor the purposes of section 1(a)(ii) of E.O. 14071, OFAC interprets “person located in the Russian Federation” to include persons in the Russian Federation, individuals ordinarily resident in the Russian Federation, and entities incorporated or organized under the laws of the Russian Federation or any jurisdiction within the Russian Federation.\n\nPlease note that section 1(a)(ii) of E.O. 14071 prohibits the direct or indirect exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of such services determined pursuant to E.O. 14071. For the purposes of E.O. 14071, OFAC interprets the “indirect” provision of such services to include when the benefit of the services is ultimately received by a “person located in the Russian Federation.” Please see FAQ 1059 for more information."
