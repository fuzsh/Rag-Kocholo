        "text": "5.1. Payments Generally.\n\nEntering into a Transaction, or using other features of our Platform, may require you to pay fees and/or may result in compensation for Flywire for currency conversion or other services Flywire provides. Flywire reserves the right to charge higher prices and fees if your Transaction requires additional manual processing or if Flywire must incur additional costs to process it for any reason, including, but not limited to, cases where a payer creates and/or processes more than 10 payments on our Platform during any 12-month period. In all cases, the total Transaction amount displayed will be inclusive of any fees (including foreign exchange fees charged by us and our Service Providers) applicable to the Transaction. However, the total Transaction amount displayed will not include any fees that may apply to any refund Transactions. By continuing with the Transaction, you agree to pay the total Transaction amount requested by Flywire. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any fees or charges for the Transaction that a financial institution (such as your bank) or other payment provider, including Service Providers, may impose. We are not responsible for any charges for insufficient funds, chargeback fees, international wire fees, or other, similar charges that any other party might impose on you. We are not responsible for any taxes, duties, levies, withholdings or other liabilities that may be imposed on your Transaction (collectively, \"Taxes\"), and we are not responsible for any penalty, fine, surcharge, interest, charges or costs relating to such Taxes. You agree to provide Flywire with proof of payment of any Taxes or proof of exemption, as Flywire may reasonably request from time to time.\n\n5.2. Flywire’s Role.\n\nYou acknowledge that:\n\nFlywire is a third-party service provider facilitating payment processing. Except in the case of Direct to Designated Entity Payments or payments for which Flywire acts solely on your behalf (“Specified Payments”), Flywire acts as agent of, and on behalf of, the Designated Entity.\n\nThe Designated Entity, not Flywire, determines the amount you owe the Designated Entity. Flywire is not responsible for any mistakes in the invoices or other notifications you receive that indicate the amounts you owe the Designated Entities.\n\nFlywire does not determine the payment terms governing your obligation to pay the Designated Entity. These payment terms, including, but not limited to, the payment due date, the amount owed, and the number of installment payments in any payment plan the Designated Entity offers to you, are agreements between you and the Designated Entity. Flywire is not a party to such agreements and has no role in setting the terms of such agreements.\n\nThe payments you make to a Designated Entity are Transactions between you and the Designated Entity and satisfy all or part of your payment obligation to the Designated Entity.\n\nFlywire does not hold any funds on your behalf and, except in the case of Specified Payments, Flywire does not process or transfer any funds on your behalf.\n\nIn the case of Specified Payments, you authorise Flywire to make payments on your behalf.\n\nFlywire is not responsible if you do not complete a payment to a Designated Entity.\n\nSpecific terms apply to health insurance products.\n\n5.3. Payments to Designated Entities.\n\nYou agree to pay the amount you indicated when you booked the Transaction. If additional charges apply to the processing of the Transaction, we will notify you. Payment is due to the Designated Entity through Flywire at the time you submit your Transaction through Flywire. If, as a result of your Transaction, we are charged insufficient funds fees, chargeback or reversal fees, or other similar fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees. In some instances, for Transactions funded from the sender’s bank account, you agree that we or our Service Provider may charge your bank account for less than the amount of the transfer as part of our effort to confirm ownership of the account.\n\n5.4. Payment Instructions.\n\n5.4.1. Transaction Booking.\n\nA Transaction can only be processed to a Designated Entity if a booking is created through the site, through the website of a Service Provider, or through another arrangement that the Designated Entity has established with Flywire. In the event that a booking is not created, Flywire will be unable to process a Transaction until a booking has been created. Additionally, we will not be responsible for any delays in processing or additional charges that may occur, such as, but not limited to, when we receive a payment with no booking or due to movements of the currency market, which may, or may not, result in a payment losing value.\n\n5.4.2. Wire Transfer/Direct Debits.\n\nIn order for us to process a payment to your Designated Entity in a timely manner, you must diligently follow instructions. These instructions: (i) are contained in your invoice from your Designated Entity and/or (ii) are sent to the email address you provided on the Platform or on the website of a Service Provider to which you were referred by Flywire. You must either take the instructions to your financial institution or, if available, process the wire transfer or direct debit via your financial institution’s online portal. Our Service Providers may make available additional options for you to initiate a wire transfer/direct debit through their services. If your payment fails or if you have insufficient funds, you must resubmit the payment. You agree that, when you book a Transaction to a Designated Entity through the Platform, if you will be initiating a payment from your bank account, your account must be denominated in the same currency as the Transaction booking information. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A PAYMENT TO ANY ACCOUNT NUMBER OTHER THAN THE ACCOUNT NUMBER PROVIDED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS. DO NOT MAKE ANY PAYMENTS IN CASH; FLYWIRE DOES NOT ACCEPT CASH.\n\n5.4.3. Credit and Debit Card Payments.\n\nFlywire may make available to you the option to pay the Designated Entity by credit or debit card. If this option is available, your card will be charged in the currency you select during the payment process by Flywire on behalf of your Designated Entity for the amount of the payment and any applicable fees or charges. Such fees or charges will be disclosed to you before you initiate the Transaction and they are non-refundable. The merchant of record for such transactions will be a Flywire affiliate, such as Flywire Payments Canada, Inc., Flywire G.K., Flywire Payments Corporation, Flywire Payments Limited, Flywire Europe, UAB, or Flywire (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n5.4.4. Representation & Warranty.\n\nYOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE, OR ARE OWNER OF, AS APPLICABLE, ANY BANK ACCOUNT, CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD USED TO INITIATE A PAYMENT THROUGH FLYWIRE.\n\n5.5. Effective Date of Payment to Designated Entity.\n\nWhen Flywire receives your funds on behalf of the Designated Entity, your obligation to pay the Designated Entity is discharged. You will receive a payment confirmation email. This will constitute proof of payment for your Transaction to the Designated Entity. Please note that the Designated Entity may take three or more business days to reflect payment in its student, patient, or customer account system.\n\n5.6. Foreign Exchange Fees.\n\nThe exchange rate applied to a particular Transaction is effective only for the period of time stated in the instruction, only for that Transaction, and only for the Designated Entity that you indicated you will pay. The payment amount received from the payer, excluding applicable fees and prior to any foreign exchange conversion for the Designated Entity (the \"Amount Received\"), will be the only amount processed by Flywire on the Designated Entity’s behalf. If you wish to make additional payments, a different exchange rate may apply.\n\n5.7. Material Currency Fluctuations and Other Extraordinary Events.\n\nFlywire may cancel a booked Transaction due to the following circumstances:\n\nmaterial changes in exchange rate fluctuations;\n\ntypographical, pricing, or other errors (regardless of whether such errors are caused by Flywire); or\n\nother circumstances beyond our control where Flywire deems it necessary to conduct such cancellation due to its legitimate business interests.\n\nIn such instances, you will be provided reasonable notice of the cancellation and have the option to rebook a Transaction at a newly quoted rate.If delivery of the funds you have paid has been initiated, you will receive a refund of the amount sent to us. The refund will be delivered to your originating payment account as soon as is practicable.\n\n5.8. Delays; Availability.\n\nAlthough we make reasonable efforts to ensure that Transactions are processed in a timely manner, we make no representations or warranties regarding: (i) the time needed to complete processing of a Transaction or (ii) whether we will be able to complete processing of a Transaction. Our ability to complete processing of Transactions depends on many factors outside our control. Your payment may be delayed or canceled, among other reasons:\n\nin the course of our efforts to verify your identity, validate your Transaction instructions, contact and locate you, and otherwise comply with internal protocols of verification of identity against government-issued sanctions or watch lists, or any other applicable international, national, federal, provincial, or local law.\n\nif you engage any third-party service provider that Flywire has not designated or approved to process, transfer, and/or settle funds on your behalf. In such situations, Flywire needs to exert additional efforts to verify your service provider’s identity, validate Transaction instructions conducted through such service provider and contact and locate such service provider to ensure that Transactions comply with applicable international, national, federal, state, provincial, or local law.\n\nBusiness hours and currency availability may also cause a delay.\n\nThe Platform may not be available to all users at all times. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse Transactions that are funded from certain payment instruments.\n\nNevertheless, you may be entitled to a refund in certain circumstances, at our discretion, as described in these Terms.\n\n5.9. Refunds.\n\nWe are not responsible for refunding payment Transactions made through Flywire to a Designated Entity, unless agreed between Flywire and such Designated Entity. The Designated Entity to which you have made a payment will determine your eligibility for a refund. You, therefore, should contact the Designated Entity directly for further details on obtaining a refund.\n\nSubject to limited exceptions, Flywire will return all refunds that it processes to the originating account in the originating currency.\n\nWe have no control over, and are not responsible for, any fees or charges that a financial institution (such as your bank) or other payment provider, including Service Providers, may impose in connection with your refund.\n\nFlywire will determine the applicable rate and other fees applicable to your refund based on prevailing market rates. The amount you receive back may be less than the amount you paid in the original Transaction. Subject to applicable regulations and policies of our banking and payment partners, we may not be able to refund to you an amount that exceeds the amount paid in the original currency.\n\nWe may charge additional fees, including a 1% refund processing charge, that apply to the processing of your refund request. In the event that you receive more than the amount you paid in the original Transaction due to a mistake by your Designated Entity, Flywire, or a Service Provider, you agree to return the excess amount (as determined by Flywire in its sole discretion) to Flywire.\n\nIn the event that you receive more than the amount you paid in the original Transaction due to a mistake by your Designated Entity, Flywire, or a Service Provider, you agree to return the excess amount (as determined by Flywire in its sole discretion) to Flywire.\n\n5.10. Verifying Information; No Changes.\n\nYou authorize us, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate the information you have provided to us. This may include asking you for additional information, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. We do not let you change the details of your payment once you have submitted such payment details to us. It is your responsibility to make sure your payment details are accurate before you submit them.\n\n5.11. CANADA: Additional Terms for Payments to or from Canada.\n\nFlywire Payments Canada, Inc. operates the Platform for Payers located in Canada, both when they are making payments to Designated Entities in Canada and Designated Entities outside of Canada.\n\nFor Payers outside of Canada, an affiliate of Flywire Payments Canada, Inc., such as Flywire Payments Corporation, operates the Platform. The specific Flywire entity that will accept your payment on behalf of your Designated Entity in Canada will be disclosed to you during the payment booking process and/or on your bank and card statements.\n\n5.12. CHINA: Specific Terms for Payments Made from China.\n\nThe following terms apply to users of the Platform in China, and supersede any other terms in these Terms which conflict.\n\nThe Platform is made available to users in China in order for such users to initiate payment orders (“Orders”) via Flywire’s locally licensed payment partners in China (“Payment Entities”), to enable users in China to pay invoices they receive from education institutions and businesses.\n\nYou acknowledge that Flywire does not provide any payment or foreign exchange services in China, and that any payment in foreign exchange you make associated with an Order initiated on the Platform is received, processed, and converted by a Payment Entity or its cooperative bank. Flywire may charge you a fee associated with your use of the Platform (“Platform Fee”). You acknowledge that any Platform Fees charged are not in return for any payment or foreign exchange services provided by Flywire on your behalf.\n\nThe rate applied to any payment in foreign exchange made from China will be quoted by a qualified banking institution in China. By applying for or using the Platform, you agree to accept such rate as the relevant banking institution publishes from time to time, regardless of whether it represents the latest or the most favorable foreign exchange price or rate. You further agree and acknowledge that any difference between the quoted rate and the rate implemented at the time of settlement or payment will not be borne or claimed by you.\n\n5.13. INDIA: Additional Terms for Payments made from India.\n\n1. Declarations relating to the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (“LRS”) prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India:\n\nYou declare that the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during the financial year including this application is within the overall limit of the LRS, and you certify that the source of funds for making the said remittance belongs to you and the foreign exchange will not be used for prohibited purposes.\n\nThe total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through, all sources in India during this financial year including this Transaction is within the applicable annual limit prescribed by Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India’s FAQs on LRS can be accessed at: https://www.rbi.org.in/\n\n2.

You also hereby agree and undertake to provide to us (or our banking or payment partners in India) any information and documents that are required to validate the truthfulness of the above declaration.\n\nYou also undertake that, if you refuse to comply with any such requests to provide information or documents or provide only unsatisfactory compliance with such requests, Flywire’s banking or payment partners in India shall refuse in writing to undertake the Transaction. In addition, if our banking or payment partners in India have reason to believe that you have engaged in, or are contemplating any, contravention or evasion of FEMA, the partner shall report the matter to the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n3. The Government of India has amended section 206C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act), pursuant to which, effective from October 1 2020 foreign remittances made under LRS will require Tax Collection at Source (“TCS”). You acknowledge and agree to the following in connection with Transactions subject to TCS:\n\nFlywire is not responsible for determining, calculating, collecting or paying the TCS amounts applicable to your Transaction; instead this will be the responsibility of our banking and payment partners in India.. For some of our banking and payment partners in India, the TCS amounts that they have determined to be applicable to your Transaction will be added to the total booking amount due to be paid by you. Flywire shall not be responsible or liable for ensuring that the TCS amounts so determined or calculated are in compliance with the Act.\n\nAs part of the TCS calculation and payment process, our payment and banking partners in India may require certain documents from you to confirm your source of funds. Failure or any delay in provision of sufficient documentation by you may delay your booking or may cause a Transaction to be cancelled or may result in our banking or payment partners in India applying a higher TCS rate to your Transaction. Flywire shall not be responsible or liable for any such delays, cancellation or higher rate of TCS as applicable.\n\nIn order to ensure the correct calculation of TCS, our banking and payment partners in India have requested that only one booking or payment per payor (based on the relevant PAN number) shall be made per day. You hereby undertake that you shall not make multiple bookings or payments that are subject to TCS on the same day, through Flywire or other payment service providers. Flywire is not responsible nor liable for any losses or penalties suffered by you in connection with TCS amounts collected and paid as a result of multiple bookings or payments made on the same day by you, through Flywire and/or through other payment service providers.\n\nThe applicable TCS amounts, once deducted by our banking or payment partners in India, cannot be refunded to you by our payment or banking partners even in the case of any return or refund Transaction. You can approach your tax authority or consult your tax advisor to enquire about any refund/adjustment.\n\nOur banking and payment partners in India shall be responsible for providing you with certificates for the TCS collected based on the e-mail contact information you have provided. Flywire is not responsible for any delay in your receipt of a TCS certificate as a result of any incorrect or outdated contact information provided by you.\n\nIf “Education Loan” is selected as a source of fund for a transaction, you confirm with respect to any documents or evidence submitted with respect to such transaction:\n\nthat the evidence submitted is an unaltered original and authentic document that was executed with the financial institution (as defined in section 80E of the Act) and for the purpose of availing education loan for pursuing further education; and\n\nthat the aggregate of all past and present payments made under the LRS of the RBI is within the aggregate loan(s) obtained for the said purpose, and accordingly, you confirm that you are entitled to avail the lower rate of TCS of 0.5% on aggregate of amounts, in excess of Rs 7 lakhs in a financial year, remitted outside India from the amount of education loan taken as mentioned in the above paragraph.\n\nYou further declare that you have the authority to provide the declarations and undertakings under this Section 5.13 of the Terms.

IRELAND: Additional Terms for Payments to Designated Entities in the Republic of Ireland; Visas.\n\nIf a student requires a visa to study at certain Designated Entities in the Republic of Ireland, Flywire must confirm that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (\"INIS\") has approved the visa application before delivering the funds to the Designated Entity. To facilitate this process, Flywire will collect certain information from you or from the Designated Entity, such as the visa application number, at the time you submit your Transaction (if available) or after the Designated Entity informs Flywire that the INIS has made a decision on the visa application. If the INIS approves the visa, Flywire will deliver the funds to the Designated Entity. If the INIS rejects the visa application, then the refund process set forth above shall govern.\n\n5.15.

If you are in the United States and making healthcare-related payments via credit or debit card or eStore payments (regardless of payment method) to a Designated Entity in the United States, your payment will go directly to your Designated Entity (collectively, “Direct to Designated Entity Payments”). With respect to all Direct to Designated Entity Payments, Flywire does not serve as agent of the Designated Entity, and your Designated Entity maintains its own card or direct debit processing facilities. With respect to such payments, the Designated Entity will be the merchant of record. Flywire may impose fees or charges on such payments, and one of the Flywire affiliates listed in Section 5.4.3 above will be the merchant of record for these fees or charges.

WORLDFIRST (Alipay): Specific Terms for Payments Made Through WorldFirst (Alipay).\n\nThe following terms apply specifically for payments made to your educational institution via WorldFirst:\n\n1. Flywire has partnered with WorldFirst (a subsidiary of Alipay) to facilitate the collection of certain payment amounts due to educational institutions in China (the “Ultimate Beneficiaries”). For the purpose of Transactions processed for WorldFirst, you acknowledge the following:\n\nWorldFirst is a Designated Entity for the purpose of these Terms, and Flywire is a third-party service provider acting as agent of, and on behalf of, WorldFirst. Flywire has no contractual or any other relationship with the Ultimate Beneficiary.\n\nThe Ultimate Beneficiary, not Flywire, determines the amount you owe to such Ultimate Beneficiary.\n\nFlywire does not determine the payment terms governing your obligation to pay the Ultimate Beneficiary. These payment terms, including, but not limited to, the payment due date, the amount owed, and the number of installment payments in any payment plan the Ultimate Beneficiary offers to you, are agreements between you and the Ultimate Beneficiary. Flywire is not a party to such agreements and has no role in setting the terms of such agreements.\n\nThe payments you make to an Ultimate Beneficiary are Transactions between you and the Ultimate Beneficiary and satisfy all or part of your payment obligation to the Ultimate Beneficiary.\n\nFlywire is not your financial institution and is not acting as a money transmitter. Flywire does not receive, hold, process or transfer any funds on your behalf.\n\nFlywire is not responsible if you do not complete a payment to an Ultimate Beneficiary.\n\n2. When Flywire receives your funds on behalf of WorldFirst, as a Designated Entity, Flywire shall assume your obligations to pay the Ultimate Beneficiary. When WorldFirst receives the relevant funds from Flywire, WorldFirst shall assume your obligations to pay the Ultimate Beneficiary. You acknowledge that once Flywire has settled your funds with WorldFirst, WorldFirst shall be responsible for onward remittance of the funds to the Ultimate Beneficiary and Flywire will have discharged its obligations to settle with the Designated Entity. You will receive a payment confirmation email once your funds have been received by WorldFirst. Please note that the Ultimate Beneficiary may need additional time to reflect payment in its student account system once funds have been received from WorldFirst.\n\n3. To comply with WorldFirst’s requirements, Flywire will only process Transactions for WorldFirst from payers or from financial institutions in countries or territories which are subject to, and supervised by, authorities with oversights of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism requirements (“AML/CFT”) that are consistent with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”), which is in a jurisdiction that is a member of the FATF or a FATF-Style Regional Body or not identified as high risk subject to increased monitoring by the FATF for compliance with AML/CFT requirements (“Supported Jurisdictions”). Any bookings you make that are indicated to be from a jurisdiction that is not a Supported Jurisdiction will be rejected by Flywire or WorldFirst during the booking process. All bookings will be subject to further verification by Flywire and/or WorldFirst for this purpose before they are fully confirmed and booked and Flywire may reach out to you to request further information if needed. If upon review any actual payments for a particular booking made from you is paid was through a financial institution from a jurisdiction that is not a Supported Jurisdiction, or if Flywire or WorldFirst is unable to verify the original of the actual payment for whatever reason (including by not limited to not receiving adequate information from the payor as requested during the booking review process), Flywire and or WorldFirst will cancel such booking. If the booking is cancelled by Flywire before funds have been settled with WorldFirst, Flywire will arrange for a return of the funds to you. If at the time the booking is cancelled by WorldFirst for any reason including but not limited to for the reason that the funds did not originate from a Supported Jurisdiction, and the funds have already been settled with WorldFirst, Flywire will only be able to return the amounts to you only after we have receive the relevant return of funds from WorldFirst, which may significantly delay the timing of such return of funds.\n\n4. To comply with WorldFirst’s requirements, Flywire shall not process any refunds for Transactions originally made through Flywire to WorldFirst which have settled with the Ultimate Beneficiary. The Ultimate Beneficiary to which you have made a payment will determine your eligibility and method of payment for the refund. You, therefore, should contact the Ultimate Beneficiary directly for further details on obtaining any refund.\n\nBack to top.\n\n19.1. Generally.\n\nIn the interest of resolving disputes between you and Flywire in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Flywire agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FLYWIRE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n19.2. Exceptions.\n\nDespite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable national, federal, state, provincial, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\n19.3. Arbitration.\n\nAny arbitration between you and Flywire will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Flywire.\n\n19.4. Notice; Process.\n\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or other similar courier service or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\"Notice\"). Flywire’s address for Notice is: Flywire, Attn: Legal Department/Terms, 141 Tremont Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02111 U.S.A. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Flywire may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Flywire must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Flywire will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Flywire in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.\n\n19.5. Fees.\n\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Flywire will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address or as determined by the AAA if your billing address is outside the United States. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Flywire for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.\n\n19.6. No Class Actions.\n\nYOU AND FLYWIRE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Flywire agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\n19.7.

Enforceability.\n\nIf Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\n\n19.9. Complaints Resolution for Payors in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have dispute resolution processes in place to address enquiries and complaints.\n\nOur Compliance Team upon receipt of your complaint will ask you to set out your complaint in writing, providing as much detail as possible so that it can fully investigate it.
