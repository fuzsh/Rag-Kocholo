This action was taken by the PSA Board of Directors to combat some of the rising costs seen by the citizens of Carroll County.\n\nThe Carroll County Board of Supervisors, during their August 8, 2022, meeting, approved to decrease the Personal Property Tax Rate on the new classification of motor vehicles and those similar as described in the Code of Virginia from $2.30 per $100 to $2.15 per $100. This action was taken to lessen the burden on citizens of the County due to the drastic increase of NADA values. The Board also approved an emergency ordinance to change the collection date of vehicle license fees. The new collection date for vehicles owned on January 1, 2023, will be December, 2023. The individual vehicle owner will not receive the annual $25.00 license fee on their 2022 personal property tax ticket as in previous years. The Board of Supervisors wishes to thank the Commissioner of Revenue and her staff for working with them to review and implement these changes."
