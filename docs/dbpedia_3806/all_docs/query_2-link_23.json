        "text": "The Neighbors\n\nThere are two complementary measures for understanding the income of a neighborhood's residents: the average and the extremes. While a neighborhood may be relatively wealthy overall, it is equally important to understand the rate of people - particularly children - who are living at or below the federal poverty line, which is extremely low income. Some neighborhoods with a lower average income may actually have a lower childhood poverty rate than another with a higher average income, and this helps us understand the conditions and character of a neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the Fairfield Plantation neighborhood in Villa Rica are upper-middle income, making it an above average income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 76.6% of the neighborhoods in America. In addition, 2.8% of the children seventeen and under living in this neighborhood are living below the federal poverty line, which is a lower rate of childhood poverty than is found in 72.1% of America's neighborhoods.\n\nThe old saying \"you are what you eat\" is true. But it is also true that you are what you do for a living. The types of occupations your neighbors have shape their character, and together as a group, their collective occupations shape the culture of a place.\n\nIn the Fairfield Plantation neighborhood, 47.3% of the working population is employed in executive, management, and professional occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 24.4% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in manufacturing and laborer occupations (18.3%), and 9.6% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is shared learned behavior. We learn it from our parents, their parents, our houses of worship, and much of our culture – our learned behavior – comes from our ancestors. That is why ancestry and ethnicity can be so interesting and important to understand: places with concentrations of people of one or more ancestries often express those shared learned behaviors and this gives each neighborhood its own culture. Even different neighborhoods in the same city can have drastically different cultures.\n\nIn the Fairfield Plantation neighborhood in Villa Rica, GA, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Irish (11.0%). There are also a number of people of German ancestry (10.4%), and residents who report English roots (10.2%), and some of the residents are also of Canadian ancestry (7.1%), along with some Dutch ancestry residents (3.6%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nHow you get to work – car, bus, train or other means – and how much of your day it takes to do so is a large quality of life and financial issue. Especially with gasoline prices rising and expected to continue doing so, the length and means of one's commute can be a financial burden. Some neighborhoods are physically located so that many residents have to drive in their own car, others are set up so many walk to work, or can take a train, bus, or bike. The greatest number of commuters in Fairfield Plantation neighborhood spend between 15 and 30 minutes commuting one-way to work (44.5% of working residents), which is shorter than the time spent commuting to work for most Americans.\n\nHere most residents (82.7%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
