        "text": "Carroll County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 census, the population was 172,891. Its county seat is Westminster.\n\nCarroll County is included in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MD Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area. While predominantly rural, the county has become increasingly suburban in recent years.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to European colonization, the land that now makes up Carroll County was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Numerous Native American archaeological sites and archeological artifacts have been located across the county. Native Americans used the land for permanent settlements, seasonal visits and journeys, and as hunting grounds. At the time of European colonization, the Susquehannock and the Lenape were the predominant indigenous nations in the area. What is now the city of Manchester was inhabited by the Susquehannock nation until around 1750 and was the location of the intersection of two important Native American trails. An ancient trail that was used by Algonquian and Iroquois nations, named the \"Patapsco-Conewago (Hanover) Road\" by colonists, stretched from the Susquehanna River to the Potomac River. Main Street in Westminster was built over a portion of the trail between the two rivers. By the end of the 1700s, most roads in Carroll County were trails established by Native Americans. Maryland Route 26 (Liberty Road) was built over top what was originally a Native American trail. This trail passed through the Freedom area of southern Carroll County and was used by Native Americans to travel from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay. The trail was transformed into a road and renamed \"Liberty\" by an act of the Maryland General Assembly in the early 1800s. The land of what is now Sykesville was used by the Susquehannock and the Lenape as hunting grounds. Taneytown was inhabited by the Tuscarora people during the early to mid-1700s. The Tuscarora hunted deer, wolves, wildcats, and otters in the woodlands of what is now Taneytown. Due to the Six Nations land cessions, the Tuscarora were expelled westward across the South Mountain of the Cumberland Valley.\n\nCarroll County was created in 1837 from parts of Baltimore and Frederick Counties, see Hundred (division). It was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737â€“1832), signer of the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe earliest European settlers in Carroll County were predominantly Pennsylvania Dutch from southeast Pennsylvania and English from the Tidewater region of Maryland. German was the predominant language of Carroll County until the Civil War. German was most heavily spoken in the northern and western parts of the county. The towns of Hampstead, Manchester, and Taneytown had German majorities. English-speakers were a minority and were concentrated in southern Carroll.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy. In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the Gettysburg campaign. On June 29, 1863, the cavalry skirmish known as Corbit's Charge was fought in the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General J.E.B. Stuart.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Carroll County was a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan and the Klan regularly held rallies and cross-burnings. The KKK held rallies and handed out leaflets on Main Street in Westminster and in Manchester until the late 1980s. In 2012, two minors were charged for a cross-burning in Westminster. In 2018, the KKK distributed fliers in southern Carroll County.\n\nIn 2013 the Carroll County Board of Commissioners voted to make English the official language of the county. In 2018, the Carroll County Public Schools announced that Confederate flags and Nazi swastikas would be banned from Carroll County schools, along with Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation symbolism and other messages that promote hatred or intolerance.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 453 square miles (1,170 km2), of which 448 square miles (1,160 km2) is land and 5.1 square miles (13 km2) (1.1%) is water.\n\nTopographically, Carroll County is located within the Piedmont Plateau region, with characteristic upland terrain of rolling hills and deciduous forest. The most prominent relief is Parr's Ridge, which bisects the county from southwest to northeast. The highest point is an unnamed 1,120-foot (340 m) hilltop a half-mile south of the Pennsylvania state line in the northeastern part of the county off Harvey Yingling Road.\n\nCarroll County is bordered on the north by the Masonâ€“Dixon line with Pennsylvania, and on the south by Howard County across the South Branch of the Patapsco River. About half of the eastern border, with Baltimore County, is formed by the North Branch of the Patapsco River and by Liberty Reservoir, though the northern half near Manchester and Hampstead is a land border. Carroll County is bordered on the west by Frederick County, across the Monocacy River and Sam's Creek. Other major streams in the county include Big Pipe Creek, Little Pipe Creek, and Double Pipe Creek, Bear Branch, and the headwaters of the Gunpowder Falls. The Piney Run Reservoir is in the southern part of the county.\n\nThree railroad lines cross Carroll County. The old Baltimore and Ohio (B&O) Old Main Line crosses the southern part of the county from east to west, with former stations in Sykesville and Mount Airy. The original Western Maryland Railway (WM) main line track runs southeast to northwest through Carrollton, Westminster, New Windsor, and Union Bridge. The old Baltimore and Hanover Railroad (later acquired by WM) runs further to the east through Hampstead, Millers, and Lineboro. Two of these railroad lines are now operated by CSX Transportation; the former WM main line is now operated by Maryland Midland Railway.\n\nCarroll County has two water reservoirs at present, Liberty and Piney Run; the county has also proposed a Union Mills Reservoir and Gillis Falls Reservoir.\n\nClimate\n\nThe county is divided by the January freezing isotherm into a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) The hardiness zones are 6b and 7a.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nYork County, Pennsylvania (northeast)\n\nBaltimore County (east)\n\nHoward County (south)\n\nFrederick County (west)\n\nAdams County, Pennsylvania (northwest)\n\nMontgomery County (southwest)\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %Â± 1840 17,242 â€” 1850 20,617 19.6% 1860 24,533 19.0% 1870 28,619 16.7% 1880 30,992 8.3% 1890 32,376 4.5% 1900 33,860 4.6% 1910 33,934 0.2% 1920 34,245 0.9% 1930 35,978 5.1% 1940 39,054 8.5% 1950 44,907 15.0% 1960 52,785 17.5% 1970 69,006 30.7% 1980 96,356 39.6% 1990 123,372 28.0% 2000 150,897 22.3% 2010 167,134 10.8% 2020 172,891 3.4% 2023 (est.) 176,639 5.7% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1790-1960 1900-1990\n\n1990-2000 2010 2020\n\n2020 census\n\nCarroll County, Maryland â€“ Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

Bank Clothiers has its headquarters in an unincorporated area in the county, near Hampstead.\n\nCarroll County Public Schools is the largest employer in Carroll County.\n\nTop employers\n\nAccording to the county's comprehensive annual financial reports, the top employers by number of employees in the county are the following. (\"NR\" indicates the employer was not ranked among the top ten employers that year.)\n\nEmployer Employees\n\n(2020) Employees\n\n(2011) Board of Education of Carroll County 3,334 3,769 Carroll Hospital Center 1,995 1,804 Springfield Hospital Center 833 833 McDaniel College 800 623 Penguin Random House 755 800 Integrace Fairhaven 700 700 Carroll County Government 628 656 Carroll Community College 580 509 EVAPCO 440 NR Carroll Lutheran Village 425 NR Jos.

Bank Clothiers NR 576 General Dynamics Robotic Systems NR 490\n\nTransportation\n\nMajor highways\n\nBus\n\nCarroll County operates its own bus public transit system, known as the Carroll Transit System. After 40 years of service, the Carroll Area Transit System (CATS bus) ended its transportation services in the county at the end of July 2016. CATS was replaced by the Carroll Transit System, which is operated by Ride With Us. Carroll Transit Service offers five fixed-deviated routes that were previously operated by CATS, as well as demand-response, door-to-door service.\n\nThe Owings Mills station of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink in nearby Owings Mills, Baltimore County, is a short drive by car from Carroll County and provides subway access to downtown Baltimore. Due to longstanding opposition to mass transit from local residents and politicians, there is no inter-county bus or rail transit linking Carroll County to nearby suburban communities of Baltimore County. Due to a resolution passed by the Carroll County Board of Commissioners, the Carroll Transit System is prohibited from offering bus services into or out of the county. The Baltimore Sun editorial board has condemned Carroll County's \"transit phobia\" and excoriated the mass transit resolution as \"thinly veiled racist provocation.\" The Baltimore City Paper declared the resolution \"racist\" and suggested adding toll booths for cars entering Baltimore County from Carroll County.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Carroll County Public Schools School system is the ninth largest school district in the state of Maryland.\n\nMcDaniel College, a small private liberal arts college, is located in Westminster.\n\nCarroll Community College is a two-year community college serving the residents of Carroll County. It is located in Westminster, Maryland.\n\nMedia\n\nThe newspaper of record is the Carroll County Times. Carroll County has one AM radio station, WTTR, located in Westminster.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nLaw enforcement services for the county are provided by the Carroll County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police, as well as several municipalities having their own police forces. In addition to providing police services, the Sheriff's Office also acts as an agent of the courts: serving warrants, enforcing child support laws, ensuring courthouse security, transporting prisoners, etc. On October 4, 2007, the County Commissioners voted to create a police department for the county. The police department would handle primary law enforcement duties while the Sheriff's office would continue to act under the arm of the courts. This move would give the Commissioners power to appoint or fire the chief of police instead of having a popularly elected Sheriff being in charge of all law enforcement. This move falls in line with Maryland's more populated counties who have such a dual system of law enforcement (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Howard and Baltimore Counties), as Carroll County has begun to have a population increase. Municipal departments, such as Westminster Police, would be unaffected by the change.\n\nFamily support services\n\nFor more details, see Family and Children's Services of Central Maryland\n\nCommunities\n\nThis county contains the following incorporated municipalities:\n\nCities\n\nWestminster (county seat)\n\nTaneytown\n\nTowns\n\nManchester\n\nMount Airy (partly in Frederick County)\n\nNew Windsor\n\nUnion Bridge\n\nHampstead\n\nSykesville\n\nCensus-designated place\n\nEldersburg\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\nNotable people\n\nFrancis Scott Key, author of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", was born at his family plantation of Terra Rubra, in what is now northwestern Carroll County\n\nWhittaker Chambers, former communist spy, testified against Alger Hiss\n\nIsaac Roop, first elected (provisional) governor of the newly proposed Nevada Territory; born in Carroll County\n\nKyle Snyder, Olympic, World, NCAA wrestling champion\n\nBand Half Japanese was founded in Uniontown, Maryland by Jad and David Fair.\n\nSee also"
