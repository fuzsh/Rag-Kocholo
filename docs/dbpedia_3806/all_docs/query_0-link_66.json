        "text": "Paulding County is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. Part of Metro Atlanta, it had an estimated population of 168,661 in 2020. The county seat is Dallas.\n\nHistory\n\nPaulding County was created from Cherokee County by an act of the Georgia General Assembly on December 3, 1832. In 1851, a portion of Paulding County was used to help create Polk County. Other portions of Paulding County were annexed to neighboring counties (Campbell, Carroll, Cobb, Douglas, Haralson, and Polk) between 1832 and 1874. Between 1850 and 1874, Paulding County was expanded through annexation of parts of Carroll, Cobb, Douglas, and Polk counties.\n\nThe county is named after John Paulding (October 16, 1758 – February 18, 1818), who was famous for the capture of the British spy Major John André in 1780 during the American Revolution. André was on a mission carrying secret papers from Benedict Arnold when he was captured.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 314 square miles (810 km2), of which 312 square miles (810 km2) is land and 2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) (0.7%) is water. The Tallapoosa River originates in Paulding County.\n\nThe county is mainly located in the Piedmont region of the state, with a few mountains located in the county that exceed elevations of 1,000 ft. The highest point in Paulding county is a small, unnamed hill located in Yorkville with an elevation of 1,410 ft (430 m) above sea level, However it is located on already elevated base and therefore cannot be considered a true mountain. The highest true mountain in Paulding County is Vinson Mountain with an elevation of 1,330 ft (405 m) above sea level, although much of the mountain's base is not entirely within the county. These mountains are considered to be part of the southernmost extensions of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThe southeastern portion of Paulding County, from just north of Hiram to north of Villa Rica, is located in the Middle Chattahoochee River-Lake Harding sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin). The very western portion of the county, centered on State Route 101, is located in the Upper Tallapoosa River sub-basin of the ACT River Basin (Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin), with the majority of the central and northern portions of Paulding County located in the Etowah River sub-basin of the same ACT River Basin.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nBartow County – north\n\nCobb County – east\n\nDouglas County – southeast\n\nCarroll County – south\n\nHaralson County – southwest\n\nPolk County – west\n\nTransportation\n\nMajor highways\n\nSecondary highways\n\nPedestrians and cycling\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1840 2,556 — 1850 7,039 175.4% 1860 7,038 0.0% 1870 7,639 8.5% 1880 10,887 42.5% 1890 11,948 9.7% 1900 12,969 8.5% 1910 14,124 8.9% 1920 14,025 −0.7% 1930 12,327 −12.1% 1940 12,832 4.1% 1950 11,752 −8.4% 1960 13,101 11.5% 1970 17,520 33.7% 1980 26,110 49.0% 1990 41,611 59.4% 2000 81,678 96.3% 2010 142,324 74.3% 2020 168,661 18.5% 2023 (est.) 183,164 28.7% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1790-1880 1890-1910\n\n1920-1930 1930-1940\n\n1940-1950 1960-1980\n\n1980-2000 2010 2020\n\n2020 census\n\nPaulding County racial and ethnic composition Race Num.
