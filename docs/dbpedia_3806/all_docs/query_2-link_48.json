        "text": "The Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the Villa Rica / Chatham Hills neighborhood in Boca Raton are middle-income, making it a moderate income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 58.2% of the neighborhoods in America. With 33.6% of the children here below the federal poverty line, this neighborhood has a higher rate of childhood poverty than 84.4% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nWhat we choose to do for a living reflects who we are. Each neighborhood has a different mix of occupations represented, and together these tell you about the neighborhood and help you understand if this neighborhood may fit your lifestyle.\n\nIn the Villa Rica / Chatham Hills neighborhood, 50.1% of the working population is employed in executive, management, and professional occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants, with 28.1% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations (12.8%), and 9.0% in manufacturing and laborer occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is shared learned behavior. We learn it from our parents, their parents, our houses of worship, and much of our culture – our learned behavior – comes from our ancestors. That is why ancestry and ethnicity can be so interesting and important to understand: places with concentrations of people of one or more ancestries often express those shared learned behaviors and this gives each neighborhood its own culture. Even different neighborhoods in the same city can have drastically different cultures.\n\nIn the Villa Rica / Chatham Hills neighborhood in Boca Raton, FL, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as Asian (16.6%). There are also a number of people of German ancestry (15.1%), and residents who report Mexican roots (10.4%), and some of the residents are also of Italian ancestry (10.0%), along with some Irish ancestry residents (8.6%), among others. In addition, 20.8% of the residents of this neighborhood were born in another country.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nEven if your neighborhood is walkable, you may still have to drive to your place of work. Some neighborhoods are located where many can get to work in just a few minutes, while others are located such that most residents have a long and arduous commute. The greatest number of commuters in Villa Rica / Chatham Hills neighborhood spend between 15 and 30 minutes commuting one-way to work (37.4% of working residents), which is shorter than the time spent commuting to work for most Americans.\n\nHere most residents (65.5%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In addition, quite a number also bicycle to get to work (8.9%) and 6.1% of residents also carpool with coworkers, friends, or neighbors for their daily commute. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
