The purpose of Carroll County’s Floodplain Management Program is to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize future damage, and to protect water supply, sanitary sewage disposal, and natural drainage.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll County achieved Good Standing in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is a program that allows residents to purchase federally supported flood insurance policies. In October of 2007, Carroll County was accepted into FEMA’s Community Rating System (CRS) with a CRS rating of 8, which means that residents with eligible flood policies in unincorporated areas of Carroll County received a 10% reduction on insurance premiums. In 2018, Carroll County was upgraded to a CRS Class 7 which allows residents to receive a 15% reduction on flood insurance premiums. Click here to see progress on mitigation projects as part of our Hazard Mitigation Plan (CRS Activity 510). Carroll County will be upgraded to a Class 6 in the fall of 2023 saving residents up to 20% on their flood insurance premiums.\n\nOn October 2, 2015 new FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps became effective for Carroll County.
