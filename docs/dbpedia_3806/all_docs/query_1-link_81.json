She educated us on things and was very knowledgeable about her information.\n\n- Dante M.\n\nOur agent managed to coordinate the sale of this home, the purchase of our new home and working with the sellerâ€™s agents to make sure the timeline of everything lined up correctly, since there were four deals relying on the sale of my home. I think he did an outstanding job for us and went over and above several times to make it all work. Not sure how he managed it all, but he did and that kept everything smooth and stress free!\n\n- Dana E. of Covington, GA\n\nOur agent was great! She was very helpful and seemed just as excited about us getting our first home as we were! From searching to closing, she was very helpful and understanding of how many questions we had, and was excellent at preemptively telling me what I was about to ask.\n\n- Chelsea S. of Clarkdale, GA\n\nAlthough this process was very trying at times, our agent always reassured, guided and helped us through this whole process. She made this an enjoyable process and we have already recommended her to our friends.\n\n- Maggie M. of Dallas, GA\n\nIf you are looking for a realtor STOP and look no further. I was really nervous about using a realtor to sell my house, I told the agent all my concerns and she was so understanding and patient. She gave me great advice and my house was under contract in less than 48 hours. I was so impressed with her. Everything she promised, she delivered.\n\n- Kelly C"
