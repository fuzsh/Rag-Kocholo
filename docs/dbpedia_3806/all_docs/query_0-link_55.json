Volume VII, Number Olle\n\nFEBRUARY 1971\n\nBy Jimmy Carter Governor of Georgia\n\nTravel investors, industrialists, and conservationists will all find a warm reception awaiting them in my office during the next four years. As Governor, I intend to take an active part in the development of our natural resources. I believe it is very realistic to assume that we can preserve what God has given us, and at the same time, enjoy it. Therefore, one of my primary goals will be to establish and maintain a favorable relationship between conservation, purity of air and water, and the development of industry and tourism. My program for tourist development calls for a complete inventory of existing and potential tourist attractions, the re-establishment of Georgia's natural beauty by eliminating dilapidated buildings, junkpiles, and destruction; expanding the state-wide advertising program, encouraging the development of at least one advertisable tourist attraction in every Georgia community, and locating one new major destination point, tourist attraction-such as Six Flags, or Stone Mountain Park-in Georgia each year. My program for industrial development includes helping individual communities seek the highest level industry they can adequately support, taking necessary action to meet increasing competition from other states, improving international trade and commerce and developing and establishing international industries in Georgia, and assisting Georgia's existing industries in their efforts to expand. I look forward to being able to implement these programs through the Department of Industry and Trade, the state agency charged with the development of industry and tourism, and with other industrial development agencies in Georgia. With all of us coordinating our efforts in behalf of the entire state, I am confident Georgia will experience continued success in the field of industrial and tourist development during the coming years.\n\nPage 5\n\nMeet The, Board\n\nThe Board of Commissioners of the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade is composed of 20 Georgians representing the state's ten congressional districts. \"Meet the Board, \" a special feature designed to introduce each of these men during the coming year, will spotlight five board members each quarter.\n\nJULIUS F.

IR.\n\nmeasuring Up moving on...\n\n100 YEARS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN GEORGIA\n\nB Wade Roy ton Georgia Department of Education\n\nThe primary information source for this article is an unpublished doctoral dissertation entitled, A Historical Study of Selected Aspects of the Equalization of Educational Opportunity in Georgia: 7937-7968, by James Hilliard Broughton.\n\nA century is marked in time and mea ured in milestones.\n\nFor the Georgia Public School System, the past 100 years have, indeed, been a eries of significant milestones of human endeavor.\n\nIn October of 1871, the Georgia General Assembly passed a bill providing for a State Board of Education and a State School Commissioner, and thus brought a system of public education to Georgia for the first time.\n\nSince that historic signing, change and the compelling need to equalize educational opportunity, have dominated the public education scene in Georgia.\n\nDuring its first quarter century, public education was largely a local, rather than a state, responsibility, with state funds being provided only for elementary schools. At that time the tate constitution permitted only 'cities to levy a tax for the support of high schools.\n\nA special constitutional provIsion allowed certain counties to tax for the support of high schools, but the overall effect of the state's first educational legislation led to a tradition of unequal educational opportunity for children in rural areas of the state.\n\nAs early as 1900, however, steps were begun to alleviate the conditions caused by the work of the previous 30 years. In 1911, the State Board of Education took high schools under its wing. County boards of education were simultaneously given the right to consolidate local schools and to provide for transportation of students.\n\nOther legislative acts to improve education came rapidly so that by the early forties the number of school teachers with college degrees had increased substantially, a visiting teacher program was in fullswing, high school counselors were being certified, and the twelfth grade had been established.\n\nThe most radical reorganization of the system was still to come, however, bringing, in 1964, a dramatic new program of education which was to do much to stabilize the industrial revolution in Georgia.\n\nCalled a program of vocational technical training, the new legislation was\n\ncontained in the second of two Minimum Foundation Programs for Education (M FPE).\n\nUsed primarily as a means of distributing state school funds, the first MFPE, passed in 1949, lengthened the teacher employment year to ten months, required equal recognition for all teachers, and prohibited certification of teachers with less than two years of college.\n\nThe second MFPE, passed in 1964, called for, in addition to vocational education, an improved plan of teacher allotment, a minimum salary for teachers, support for educational television to provide state-wide coverage, increased funds for school construction, provisions for students to cross county attendance lines, the establishment of the Governor's Honors Program for gifted students, more leadership personnel in school systems, and aid for lunchroom and 12 month school programs.\n\nThe only precedent for vocational education in Georgia, prior to the 1964 ruling, was the federally sponsored Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, which provided for funds for instruction in high schools and for work in agricul ture, home economics, trades, and industrial subjects.\n\nPage 7\n\nmeasuring up moving on...\n\nIn the past 100 years, Georgia public education has progressed from the \"3 R's\" taught in the clapboard schools of yesteryear to the more sophisticated social and technical teachings of the present century. Page 8\n\nThe conditions which prompted the new program were not unique to Georgia, but were generally characteristic of the South in the years following World War II. Urbanization and industrialization were rapidly changing the economic patterns of the region. Agricultural mechanization released a surplus of farm workers who looked to the cities for employment, but had few saleable skills. Those who found work at all often had to settle for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs.\n\nSimultaneously, industries were finding that the lack of properly trained workers and adequate training facilities hampered expansion. Continuous changes in industrial methods and technology further compounded the problem, along with thousands of high school seniors who were graduating with no plans of going to college.\n\nGeorgians recognized that conservation of these precious human resources could only be accomplished through a training program which offered every citizen the opportunity to equip himself for a useful, productive life.\n\nVolumes of research and planning went into the 23 vocational schools that were designated for construction in the initial concept of the program. Today, that original design has come to fruition. By embracing the two original state vocational schools that were in existence at the time of the passage of the legislation, the entire vocational system has attained a value of some $60 million. Total cost of building the 23 schools, plus the two state schools at Americus and Clarkesville, is $27 million. Local education systems have invested approximately one million dollars in school sites, while the Georgia State Board of Education has committed expenditures of $21 million on instructional equipment.\n\nThe schools offer day and evening classes in machine shop practice, mechanical technology, data processing, aviation mechanics, appliance repair, sheet metal working, welding, practical nursing, various construction trades, chemical technology, industrial electricity, business education, and\n\nother subjects. The success of the program to date has been phenomenal.\n\nIn 1970, alone, the state's industrial and technical education system boosted the quality of labor by some 14,000 full-time students and more than 100,000 participants in shortterm job enrichment courses.\n\nEnrollment figures also attest to the success of the system. In 1964, 9,000 students took part in technical training programs. In 1970, the number was increased by almost 500 percent to 43,000. By 1980, the 130,000 graduates of the system will collectively earn more than a billion dollars a year.\n\nA unique feature of the state vocational program is a pre-employment training called \"Quick Start\", which is designed to provide industry with employees who are productive from the first day on the job.\n\nQuick Start works this way: When a company selects a Georgia plant site, industry special ists from the Department of Education work with company officials analyzing training needs, formulating recruitment, and carefully scrutinizing each job to determine the training required and the time needed. The employees are then recruited and trained by the state, at no cost to the industry, to fill the special demands of their specific jobs.\n\nAlready recognized as a national forerunner in vocational education, the unique Quick Start program and the vocational program which fostered it, have earned a high place as one of the most significant milestones during the first century of public education in Georgia.\n\nPage 9\n\nPage 10\n\nFrom its strategic location on the periphery of Atlanta, the city of Newnan is in an enviable position as far as industrial and tourist development is concerned.\n\nA 3.9 mile thoroughfare connecting this progressive west Georgia community with the newly completed\n\n1-85 link with Atlanta has already stimulated considerable commercial development.\n\nA four-lane highway which was completed only last August, the 3.9 mile strip will soon have a multi-\n\nmillion dollar shopping center called Newnan Mall. The new construction, which covers 33 acres, is\n\nscheduled to house 12 large business establishments. At the end of the new thoroughfare, in the heart of the city, the hustle and bustle of growth continues\n\nto race with the resources of man.\n\nnelVno\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nWhile over half of Georgia's 159 counties lost population in the last decade, Coweta, of which Newnan is the governmental seat, has gained. In 1960, the county's population was listed as 28,893.\n\nBy 1970 it had increased to 30,144. An even greater increase is expected in the next 30 years when the population is projected to reach 100,000.\n\nThe area's rate of growth can be partially measured by the total dollar value of building\n\npermits issued. In 1969, building permits totaled $1,644,000, including $1,217,000 of commercial construction. A total of 995 building permits were issued and a total of 40 substandard structures were demolished. During the first seven months of 1970, 560 permits\n\nwere issued with a total value of one million dollars. This includes a $121,500 department store to be located in the Newnan Shopping Center. With\n\nseveral large projects still being planned, total value of building permits for 1970 will be several\n\nmillion dollars, greatly surpassing last year's mark of $1,644,000.\n\nLike most rapidly growing communities, Newnan has had its share of problems, particularly in housing and parking.\n\nThe city's first Urban Renewal Project, completed last year at a cost of two million dollars, covers a 128 acre area.\n\nneUJnan ON THE MOVE\n\nA second renewal project, slated to cover 75 acres at a cost of $1,250,000, is in the planning stages. If the project is approved, Newnan will be among the first of several southeastern cities to implement a mobile home park concept in public housing.\n\nPrivate enterprise is also making an effort to alleviate the local housing situation. One development consisting of 100 town house units is under construction at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Built under the Federal Housing Program 236, these units will be available for low and moderate income families. Another-West Gate Park-consists of 363 sites and includes apartment units, parks and commercial establishments.\n\nTo solve internal parking and traffic problems, Newnan enlisted the assistance of the Chattahoochee-Flint Area PI anni ng and Development Commission. Detailed off-street parking studies have been completed and plans for several hundred new parking spaces are now being prepared. The Chattahoochee-Flint Area Planning and Development Commission has also submitted a proposal to the Economic Development Administration requesting that Newnan be designated as a secondary EDA growth center within\n\nthe Chattahoochee-Flint area and thus make the city eligible for governmental supported loans and grants for development.\n\nTourism and recreation also thrive in Coweta County. Four Seasons of Georgia, built at a cost of $20 million, is a year 'round paradise nestled in 1,400 acres of scenic land near Newnan. This beautiful resort, now under construction, will provide several hundred home owners with virtually all recreational activities including an 18 hole golf course, 250 acre lake, riding, fishing and swimming, all in the mode of leisure country living.\n\nThe local economy that supports developments like Four Seasons is derived from a strong, diversified industrial base.\n\nIn 1965, Newnan became the first city in the state to receive the Georgia Certified City Award and went on later, in 1970, to become the only city in the state to receive the award twice.\n\nAmong other things, the designation \"Georgia Certified City\" means that the city has carefully and meticulously taken the necessary steps to overcome deficiencies and obstacles which could seriously inhibit growth, progress, and\n\nattraction of new business and industry. Certification of a Georgia city is recognition of overall superiority as a prime location for new industry.\n\nSince 1968, four new industries have located in Newnan. Since 1965, 15 existing industries have expanded operations in Newnan.\n\nRepresented in this variegated galaxy of industry are such firms as American Optical Company, manufacturers of industrial goggles; Beavers Packing Company, meat products; Bibb Manufacturing Company, wood and synthetic blend blankets; The William L. Bonnell Company, aluminum extrusions; R. D. Cole Manufacturing Company, elevated pressure tanks; Colorcraft Printers, Inc., screen printing, towels, rugs; U. S. Chemicals Division of U. S. Steel Company, molded plastics; General Tire & Rubber Company, polyurethene foam; Grantville Mills, Kingtex Fabrics Division of Genesco, cotton yarn; International Playtex Corporation, brassieres; Marathon Division of American Can Company, sanitary food containers, bread wrappers; Royal Molded Products, Inc., toilet seats; Secret Charm Bra, brassieres; Weston Homes, Inc., manufactured housing; Douglas Battery Company, batteries.\n\nPage 12\n\nAN\n\nRT\n\nPROGRESS\n\nThe Federal Census just completed shows that Georgia's population has grown by approximately 14 percent in the last ten years. This 14 percent population growth is greater than the national average and indicates that Georgia has more to offer and is developing at a fa ter rate than most of the United States. This population growth is also indicative of a change in Georgia's pattern of development.\n\nBefore this decade, Georgia lost many of its brighter minds to other states wh ich offered better opportunities. By retaining its people and attracting others, however, Georgia has now earned the title of an \"immigration\" state.\n\nPopulation growth, on the other hand, is only one indication of the total development of a state. There are many other significant factors that show the tremendous progress being made here in Georgia.\n\nThe school systems offer a better education to all and there are better health facilities, improved roads, improved state and local governments, improved municipal services, better utilities, and more importantly, a better image based on real fact-not mere fantasy.\n\nThese and many other improvements have all made contributions to Georgia's outstanding growth, and their value is reflected in the overall economic picture.\n\nTake the tourist industry, for example, and how it prospered in the decade of the 60's.\n\nEXECUTI VE DI RECTOR Louis W. Truman\n\nLt. Gen. U. S. Army (Ret.)\n\n.. ~\n\nbatteries, and automobile accessories, automobile repairs, and other travel related operations, and, as a whole, account for over 20 percent of the total state revenue.\n\nTax dollars resulting from other forms of development are not as readily measured as those resulting from the touri t industry. However, there are other means whereby industrial development and overall economic development can be measured.\n\nChart One shows that in 1961, 3,328,300 Georgia residents traveled in Georgia to Georgia destinations and that by 1970, the number had increased to approximately 13 million. The chart also shows a similar gain for out-ofstate travelers who were simply passing through Georgiathe percentage gain for both of these categories of visitors to Georgia was approximately the same-112 and 109.\n\nThe tourist industry put $216 million into the tax treasury in 1970, as compared to $114 million in 1961, for an 89.4 percent gain. These tax dollars came from hotels and motels, eating and drinking establishments, recreation facilities, gasoline service stations, sale of tires,\n\nFinally, the chart shows that .336,900 out-of-state travelers came to Georgia as a destination point in 1961 and that this number had grown to 800,000 by 1970. In this category, Georgia gained approximately 500,000 out-of-state visi tors in 1970 over 1961 for an increase of 135 percent. Almost 13 million Georgians and out-of-state people selected Georgia as the place to spend a vacation or visit.\n\nThe significance of new or improved places to visit and stay in Georgia can easily be seen. It appears that attractions in Georgia are not only better known now, but are attracting people for a second and a third time,\n\nPage 14\n\nAN UAL REPORT\n\nor perhaps even more, and that accommodations are such as to make visitors want to return. The 135 percent gain in out-of-state travelers shows that the word about what Georgia has to offer is reach ing out-of-state.\n\nThe bottom chart show that visitors to Georgia destinations are spending their money here. Total travel expenditures in Georgia reached over one billion dollars in 1970 for a gain of 146 percent over 1961. Tourist travelers alone spent $780 million in 1970 compared to\n\n297 million in 1961. This was an increase of 149 percent. What these visitors spent helped to swell the tax cofers of the state considerably.\n\nThe chart on page 16 show the capi tal investment for new and expanded indu tries from 1961 through 1970. In 1962 there was a drop from 1961 but all other years surpass the previous year. An increase in capital investment each year is a very desirable goal, and one which the Department of Industry and Trade fully endorses and attempts to achieve.\n\nIn 1970, announced additional jobs by new and expanded industry amounted to 18,869. At the end of 1970,446,900 individuals were directly employed by manufacturing establishments in Georgia. Direct employment i ignificant, but so are manufacturing related jobs. In 1970, manufacturing related jobs alone exceeded 335,000.\n\nVACATION/RECREATION TRAVELERS I~ GEORGIA\n\nOUT OF STATE\n\n14\n\nWITH GEORGIA DESTINATIONS 13\n\nPASS-THROUGH TRAVELERS\n\nGEORGIA RESIDENTS WITH GEORGIA DESTINATIONS\n\nPERCENTINCREASE1961-1970 Georgia Residents With Georgia Destinations Out of State Pass-Through Travelers Out of State With Georgia Destinations\n\n109% 112% 132%\n\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n\n9\n\nVzl\n\n8\n\n0\n\n..J ..J\n\n7\n\n::E\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1-\n\n2\n\n0 1961\n\n1970\n\nTRAVEL EXPENDITUFE\n\nTOTAL TOURIST INDUSTRY TAX\n\n$1,100 $1,000\n\nTOTAL TOURIST EXPENDITURES\n\nTOTAL TRAVEL EXPENDITURES\n\nPERCENT INCREASE 1961 THROUGH 1970\n\nTotal Travel Expenditures\n\n146.4%\n\nTotal Tourist Expenditures\n\n149%\n\nTotal Tourist Industry Tax\n\n89.4%\n\n$ 900\n\nVl\n\n~\n\n<!\n\n$ 800\n\n..J\n\n..J $ 700\n\n0\n\n0\n\nu.\n\n$ 600\n\n0\n\nzVl\n\n$ 500\n\n0 $ 400\n\n..J\n\n..J $ 300\n\n::E\n\n$ 200\n\n$ 100\n\n$0\n\n,-\n\n1961\n\n1970\n\nPage 15\n\nAN\n\nRT\n\nTOTAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT\n\n700\n\n612\n\nr-----.\n\n60\"\n\n500\n\n-527\n\n554\n\n....-\n\nMILLIONS OF DOLLARS\n\n400\n\n379\n\n....-\n\n422\n\n....--\n\n\"\n\n300\n\n314\n\n....-\n\n,\n\n..~\n\n.'\n\n\"-\n\n1'-\n\nI;\n\n:~.-\"\n\n200\n\n-225\n\n..-\n\n..

Credit for this achievement must be shared by all of the tate developmental organizations. The Department of Industry and Trade and state-wide developers such as utilities, banks, railroads and universities generated the initial interest and brought corporate officials to the state. Local developerschambers of commerce, APDC's, development authorities, and many public and private citizens then helped finalize the plans for new and expanded facilities in their towns.\n\nThe Industry Division has the primary responsibility for promotion and attraction of new industry and business to Georgia. The underlying objectives of all programs are to increase the per capita income of the state, and to improve the state and local governmental revenue situation by spreading tax revenues over a larger base.\n\nThe division program of developing stronger relationships and maintaining continual contact with the national firms in those industries having the most rapid growth has become increasingly effective. This long range programcoupled with the newer information programs provided by the Research Division, the increased capability of the division staff members, and the inherent advantages Georgia offers-is making greater impact on the minds of\n\nindustry management, and Georgia is receiving more consideration than ever in capital expansion projects.\n\nThe increase in activity in the international trade area has spiralled during 1970, and will certainly increase again in 1971. More and more Georgia companies are using the Industry Division's expertise in the field of international trade as their stepping off point toward expanding their sales into international markets. From the other side, an increased number of foreign companies are becoming aware of the advantages offered in Georgia.\n\nClose liaison with the new foreign consulates established in Atlanta is resulting in numerous contacts with foreign companies, many of which are coming to Georgia for a firsthand look. The shrinking size of the world from a transportation standpoint, plus the tremendous potential of the U. S. market, portends another giant step in international activity during 1971.\n\nEven though 1970 was a banner year, the Industry Division staff members cannot help but be optimistic about the decade ahead, believing 1971 will open up further opportunities to place Georgia in the forefront in industrial and commercial growth.\n\nPage 16\n\nAN\n\nRT\n\nRESEARCH DIVISION\n\nAs the infOrmation center of the department, the Research Division maintains an exten ive library and prepares a number of industry related publications.\n\nFor the industrial prospect, a pecial package of tatitical and socio-economic information designed to meet the specific requirements of each individual i prepared upon request.\n\nInformation on individual Georgia communities is disseminated through a four-page fact sheet called an \"Economic Development Profile\". Available for over 400 communities, these fact heets are produced a are ult of a computerized ite selection program which contains basic tatistics on local economic conditions.\n\nThe community data base has been expanded during the past\n\nyear to include recruitable labor estimates for each of the communities in the data bank. Developed with the aid of the Georgia Department of Labor, this new service presents, on a quarterly basis, estimated recru itable labor within a 15, 25, and 35 mile radii of each community.\n\nThe following statistical reports were published during the year: A Survey of Weekly Earnings, Non-Production Occupations; Electronic Potentials in Georgia, Locational Potential for the Chemical Industry in Georgia, 7970 Georgia Mobile Home Manufacturing, Statistical Introduction to Georgia, Georgia, an Economic Development Editorial Survey; 7970 Georgia Statistical Abstract, 7977 Georgia Manufacturing Directory, Georgia Directory of Architects, Contractors and Engineers; and 7969 Georgia New and Expanded Industries.\n\nAVIAliON DIVISION\n\nIn order to assist local communities qualify for construction or improvement funds under the 1970 Airport/Airways Act, the department entered into contracts with several consulting engineers to prepare local airport layout plans. The department's share of the $35,300 planning cost was 30,500.\n\nWith the cooperation of the Federal Aviation Administration, a series of meetings was conducted to explain the new Federal Aviation Administration Airport Development Aid Program to those charged with the responsibility of constructing airports.\n\nA total of $256,020.50 in state funds was spent on the Georgia Airport Development Program, a special project\n\nsponsored by the department To complement the program, the division conducted a revalidation course for 186 flight instructors. The course was taught by a flight instructor team from the Federal Aviation Administration Academy at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nOther activities included sponsoring exhibits at the annual meetings of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Convention, and the National Business Aircraft Association Convention assisting with the dedication ceremonies of the Camilla-Mitchell County Airport, the CuthbertRandolph County Airport, and the Washington-Wilkes Airport Terminal, and distributing the 7970 Georgia Aeronautical Chart and the 7970 Georgia Airport Directory.\n\nPage 17\n\nAN\n\nRT\n\nTOURIST DIVISION\n\nGains of approximately nine percent were made in the Georgia travel industry in 1970, while travel expenditures by vacation and recreation travelers reached approximately $790 million.\n\nConstruction projects begun by travel serving firms in Georgia last summer were valued at more than $24 million, an increase of 217.5 percent over the same period in 1969. The value of construction started by lodging establishments alone was set at $19,417,000.\n\ntour for 12 of the country's leading travel editors, continuing to take an active role in the Southern Travel Directors Council and the Discover America Travel Organizations, and supplying stories and pictures for newspapers and magazines across the country.\n\nSummer sales by all travel serving firms increased by 9.2 percent to make a total of $518.3 million in 1970. Over 11 million persons visited Georgia's vacation and recreation areas during the three month period, an increase of 11 percent over the same period in 1969.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Georgia led the nation in the number of welcome center visitors. More than two-anda-half-million people stopped at the eight Georgia Welcome Centers from January through October. The arrival of the ten millionth visitor in July marked another milestone in growth of the eight-year-old program.\n\nAnd, for the fourth consecutive year, Georgia's Tournament of Roses float was viewed by millions as it passed the television cameras along the parade route in Pasadena, California New Year's Day. The float, which received the Sweepstakes Award, was singled out as the most beautiful non commercial float entered in the parade.\n\nA new tourist promotion, \"VI V Passport to Georgia\", was begun this year in an effort to make a \"Very Important Visitor\" out of every traveler to the state. The passport, produced in cooperation with the Georgia Travel Attractions Council, offers discounts and/or gifts to visitors when they visit participating attractions.\n\nThe first phase of an active Travel Development Program was also launched in the form of a 32 page color supplement in the 1971 edition of Travel Investment Magazine. The purpose of the project is to stimulate the interests of investors through a comprehensive report on travel opportunities in Georgia.\n\nOther tourist activities included participating in five major travel shows in the eastern United States and Toronto, Canada; conducting a \"Fly Around Georgia\"\n\nThe growing travel industry in Georgia inspired the residents of the orth Georgia town of Helen to completely renovate their busines area to re emble a Bavarian Alpine village. Thousand of tourist dollars have already been generated for the area as a result of the \"new look\".\n\nPage 18\n\nAN UAL REPORT\n\nECO o CS OF G OWTH\n\nTotal development of Georgia, which is vitally dependent on the tourist and manufacturing indu trie ,can best be shown by the per capita income increases that have occurred since 1961. In 1961, Georgia's per capita income was $1,677. By 1970, this figure is e timated to be 3,258. During this period the southeast outstripped the nation as a whole in gains in per capita income and Georgia outstripped the sou thea t. However, even with the great advance made, Georgia's per capita income is still ju t over 82 percent of the national per capita income.\n\nClosing the gap on personal income is an attainable goal, but even before reaching a par on per onal income it houtd\n\nbe realized that Georgia is already clo e in real purchasing power. The fact that Georgia' co t of living is comparatively low give a real asset in the competitive world of development.\n\nAn Atlantan has only to spend $90 for the same things that would co t him $120 if he lived in New York. The Atlantan' cost of living is 75 percent of that of the ew Yorker. The man living in non-metropolitan Georgia has an even lower cost of living-71 percent of that of the New York r.

The answer, on the other hand, is decidedly more complicated, and brings on a good deal more talk.\n\nThe mere statement, \"hunting's good\" is far from adequate because, as every dedicated sportsman knows, the term \"good hunting\" has a different meaning for different people.\n\nOne reliable hunting index, however, which measures up to just about everybody's standards, is based on the abundance of game animals, or those species which are hunted exclusively for sport.\n\nGame animals annually produce a surplus of young to insure an adequate breeding stock for the next mating season. It is this surplus which the\n\nhunter harvests, and depends on for his sport, and according to this measure, the State of Georgia definitely has good hunting.\n\nThere are plenty of natural resources in Georgia which produce an abundant supply of game each year, and these resources are quite capable of producing an enviable variety of different types of game.\n\nOne of the brightest spots in the Georgia hunting picture is the deer distribution map. Because deer were hunted heavily with dog packs, and at night with lights, the white-tail deer was virtually extinct in Georgia at the turn of the century.\n\nAn attempt to restore the animal in 1928 was moderately successful, but the most effective restoration came in\n\n1947, when the Georgia Game and Fish Commission began a concentrated effort in this direction. The result is that today all 159 counties in the state have deer populations, and 145 of them permit hunting.\n\nDeer season opens as early as October in some of the southern counties of the state, but for most of Georgia, November is the traditional deer month. In some areas special either-sex hunts are used as management tools to control the rapidly expanding deer population. The state limit is two deer per hunter.\n\nMiddle Georgia is the favorite deer hunting area. Because of exceptionally good living conditions, the deer in this part of the state seem to grow bigger, and in larger numbers, than in other areas of the state.\n\nPage 21\n\nhunting is good in Georgia.\n\nLate March and early April find the Georgia hunter stalking the elusive wild turkey, which has been steadily losing ground in the last few years in his competition with man.\n\nThis wilderness bird, which has a very low tolerance for human neighbors, needs extensive stands of mass producing timberland. If the large tracts of land now being managed for timber were also managed to take wildlife values into account, there is a good chance that this grand gamebird wou Id stage a stunning comeback.\n\nAs for now, there are relativel y few areas in the state where turkeys are present in huntable numbers. Most are found in the southern part of the state, where the land is privately owned. Securing permission to hunt is sometimes a problem. There is a fall turkey season in the southwest corner of Georgia, but for the most part, turkey hunting is done during the spring gobbling season when the males are seeking mates.\n\nGeorgia's most popular game-the squirrel-is also supersensitive to its surroundings. To the delight of squirrel hunters everywhere, the increase of Georgia forest land is causing an increase in the squirrel population.\n\nIn fact, a special early squirrel season has been declared for north Georgia, in August, in addition to the regular October-February season in the rest of the state. A liberal bag limit of ten a day gives the adept squirrel hunter plenty of sport for his day afield.\n\nPage 22\n\nTwo other significant small game species are Georgia quail and rabbit. Unfortunately, changing land use patterns are proving detrimental to both. The disappearance of the small farm concept of agriculture, and its replacement by forest land or extensive clean farming operations represent deterioration of habitat for both species.\n\nThis is not to say that there are no areas which produce farm game any longer, but quail hunting in uncontrolled areas is not what it used to be. Since the quail, known affectionately by some as the beloved bobwhite, needs agricultural and open land, he is usually found on private land. And here again, for the outsider, obtaining permission to hunt is often difficult.\n\nThe quail hunter planning a short-term trip would be wise to investigate one of the commercial shooting preserves operating in the state. These facilities virtually guarantee a successful hunt for quail instead of \"a hunt for a place to hunt.\" In addition, the preserve season lasts from October through March, more than two months longer than the regular quail season which begins in November and ends in February.\n\nThe rabbit hunter has an easIer time, particularly in south Georgia, where the surplus bunnies are regarded as pests, and the season begins in late November and continues through February. In the northern part of the state, the season only lasts through January.\n\nAs indicated earlier, the location of a place to hunt poses a problem for Georgia small game hunters. The largest blocks of public land in the state are the Chattahoochee and the Oconee National Forests managed by the U. S. Forest Service. There are 780,000 acres open for public hunting. Three hundred thousand additional acres make up part of the state's 27 wildlife management areas.\n\nUnder strict superVISion by the Georgia Game and Fish Commission, the wildlife management areas are designed to produce good conditions for wildlife. They cover a total of more than 600,000 acres of land which, .because of strict control, produce high quality hunting for the sportsman.\n\nAdditional public land is available at Fort Stewart near Savannah, where 279,303 acres are open for public hunting.\n\nBy far, the greatest amount of hunting land-300,000 acres-in Georgia is privately owned by timber companies, many of which allow hunting, sometimes imposing a fee which is used to further improve wildlife conditions on the property.\n\nOverall, the Georgia hunting picture is encouraging, both now and for the future. If the current interest in conserving the environment continues and begins to playa decisive role in current legislation, it is reasonable to predict that hunting will be a challenging and exciting Georgia recreation for many years to come.\n\nI\n\nCONTROL TOWER\n\noMNI Makes It Easier\n\nA new very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) facility, the first of this particular type to operate in Georgia, has been installed at the Emanuel County Airport in Swainsboro at a cost of $29,177.\n\nDescribed as a \"rather simple little device which has revolutionized general aviation inflight navigation,\" the omni nearly supplants the old low-frequency radio ranges.\n\nAccording to general aviation experts, the omni makes an easy matter of\n\nflying a course directly to a station, flying a course directly away from a station, and determining the direction of the aircraft from a station.\n\nThe key to the instrument's success is the combination of ease of use, instantly meaningful communication of information, and reliability.\n\nFor identification purposes the VOR station broadcasts a three letter code continually. On some stations the code\n\nis supplemented by a recorded voice which recites the name of the installation, and broadcasts weather conditions at 15 mimttes past every hour within 150 miles and at 45 minutes past the hour from stations within 400 miles.\n\nAll totaled, there are three VOR receiver components for the pilot to use including a course selector, a left-right needle which deflects according to the location of the omni radial from the airplane, and a \"to-from\" indicator.\n\nPage 24\n\nGEORGIA WINS\n\nSWEEPSTAKES\n\nConsidered the top honor in float competition, the Sweepstakes is awarded to the most beautiful noncommercial entry in the annual Tournament of Ro es Parade in Pasadena, California. Georgia's 7977 parade entry, Wonderland of Fun, competed with 46 noncommercial floats to win this year's Sweepstakes A ward.\n\n----....,, :; :::::::::::===----\n\nPage 26\n\nThe fact th~t the State of Georgia won the 1971 Sweepstakes Award in the 82nd Annual Tournament of Roses Parade is, old news to most Georgians by now.\n\nBut for at least three Georgia beauties, the thrill and excitement of that big win will be the current topic of conversation for many months to come.\n\nThe girls-Nancy Carr of Columbus, the reigning Miss Georgia, Amy English of Hawkinsville, the current Miss See Georgia First, and Devony De Pew, Queen of Georgia's own Festival of Roses in Thomasville-represented Southern beauty and congeniality on the 1971 award winning float.\n\nNot only were the three girls given their first exposure on nationwide and satellite television-the float was seen by over two million people as it passed the reviewing stand-but, as Georgia tourist ambassadors they also made debut appearances at several local tourist attractions including Disneyland and Universal Studios.\n\nAt Disneyland, the girls were in the company of such delightful characters as Pluto and the Three Little Pigs.\n\nThe trip to Universal Studios was highlighted by visits to the sets of Land of the Giants and Marcus Welby, M.D. and an interview on KMPC, Radio, one of Los Angeles' leading stations.\n\nMoments before the parade, the girls, clad in the traditional hoop-skirted costumes, were int~rviewed by a CBS News correspondent, and watched as last minute touches were added to the Georgia float.\n\nNancy Carr\n\nAmy English\n\nPage 27\n\nCG@rt'rgn@\n\n~@jp)\n\nnews at a glance\n\n1911\n\n6EOR61A MANUFACTURIN6 DIRECTORY\n\nPage 28\n\nState Issues\n\nManufacturing\n\nDirectory\n\nSome 5,600 manufacturing firms are included in the new edition of the Georgia Manufacturing Directory being distributed this year by the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade.\n\nThe 1971 directory, which will serve as the state's major industrial reference for the next two years, lists complete and current information on each entry, including vital statistics such as individual mailing addresses, company officials, parent companies, nu mber of employees, and products.\n\nThis year marks the seventh time the biennial p,ublication has been compiled. Typeset by computer, the new directory features a four-column page format and three separate indices based on alphabetical, geographic, and product standard classification groupings.\n\nThe information included in the directory was compiled and edited by members of the Research Division of the Department of Industry and Trade from data submitted by industry personnel across the state. Members of the area planning and development commissions, Georgia Tech Industrial Development Division offices, and local chambers of commerce also assisted in the project.\n\nCopies of the new directory may be obtained by sending a $5.00 remittance to the Directory Section, Georgia Department of Industry and Trade, Post Office Box 38097, Atlanta 30334, or by visiting the department offices on the sixth floor of the TrinHy-Washington Building, Atlanta. No C.O.D. orders can be accepted.\n\nTHE BEKAERT EMPIRE\n\nFive months prior to the completion of its first United States facility, Bekaert Steel Wire Corporation announced plans to expand.\n\nThe Belgium based company, the world's second largest producer of drawn steel, was in the process of completing a modern, 120,000 square foot cord plant in Rome when officials announced that they would break ground this spring for a $10 million expansion at the plant site.\n\nScheduled for completion in November, the addition is to be a steel cord production plant employing some 100 people. The original plant, dedicated last November, employs 60 people, and produces steel cord for use in the casing of vehicle tires.\n\nThe Rome operation is one of 15 Bekaert factories located in eight countries. Founded in 1880, Bekaert has been in steel wire manufacturing for 90 years and has been shipping steel wire and steel wire products to\n\nthe United States for more than 40 years.\n\nBekaert products range from steel surgical sutures to springs and heavy duty fences, and from hair pi ns and mousetraps to wire for bridges, roads, a\"d tires.\n\nBekaert accounts for more than 14 percent of the Common Market's drawn wire production and produces ten percent of the western world's wire fencing, while Bekaert factories in Belgium, France, and Italy fabricate more than $20,000,000 worth of furniture. Plants in Belgium and England produce more than 1,200,000 car seats and backs annually with sales in England alone accounting for some 25 percent of the market.\n\nSwevegem, Belgium is the nucleus of the Bekaert empire. Although the little town was isolated from mines and other industrial centers near the end of the 19th century, Leon Leandre Bekaert found it a fertile source of\n\nindustrious workers and decided to build his first barbed wire plant there. By 1886, the plant area had more than doubled and the production line had been expanded to include bedsprings and clamps. In 1893, the first machine for making three stranded wire was installed, marking the beginning of a series of prosperous years for Bakaert.\n\nWorld War I brought near disaster, however, and the company had to be completely rebuilt following the German retreat. Maurice and Leon Bekaert began this tremendous undertaking in 1919. Within two years, production had reached 275 tons per month. During the next decade, additional factories were acquired in France, Vielsalm, Ruisbroeck, L'Esperance, Sheffield, and Wolverhampton.\n\nWith the death of Leon in 1936, Leon-Antoine Bekaert fell heir to the steel empire and under his guidance the firm became an international factor in the manufacture and marketing of wire and wire products.\n\nPage 29\n\nrr\n\nTHE NEW WELCOME LOOK\n\n.. ~~\"-\"\"\n\nMary Jean Geer, manager at the Atlanta Airport Welcome Center, models the various ensembles that go together to make up her new 1971 wardrobe. Created by Career Fashion of Georgia, the new Georgia Welcome Center uniform are designed to enhance the warm hospitality, friendly conversation, and helpful travel information that radiate from each of the state's eight welcome lations. The new fashions will be worn year 'round at the centers, which are located on the periphery of the tate at Augusta, Columbus, Lavonia, Sylvania, Ringgold, Savannah, and Valdosta, and operated by the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade.

G. Rhodes Home on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, the Georgia Archives now sits between the State Capitol and the Atlanta Stadium on a neatly manicured knoll overlooking the apex of the state's busy interstate highway system.\n\nThe six million dollar building, designed by Bradbury and Associates of Atlanta and dedicated in August of 1965, is an impressive architectural feat which has drawn a good deal of attention from state governments across the country.\n\nStretching toward the sky line a mysterious space-age monolith, the concrete building, with its exquisite facade of Georgia marble, is an intriguing invitation to the passerby.\n\n\"A place for everything and everything in its place\" might well be the motto of archivists who oversee the various manuscripts, official documents, and artifacts that have found their way to the state archives since it was first establ ished over 50 years ago, in 1918.\n\nThere is a floor reserved especially for memorabilia and pension records from the Civil War, there's an area filled with old wills, family Bibles, land titles and other documents necessary for establishing one's family tree, and there are stacks and stacks of statistics, maps, and valuable letters patiently waiting the day when an enterprising young high school student, PHD candidate, or author will give them their rightful place in history by including them in a term paper, dissertation, or book.\n\nAll of these records-which are included in what is known as research areas of the archivesare available to the public upon request.\n\nOther historic artifacts-including a will that dates back to 1733, the original stained glass windows and winding, mahogany staircase from the home that housed the archives from 1930 until 1966, and a valuable contemporary copy of the Royal Charter establishing the Colony of Georgia-are on display for the public to view at its leisure.\n\nConducted tours of the four research areas and main floor, including a slide documentary of the building are available for groups by appointment. A special guide sheet for individual, unconducted tours of the main floor of the building is available at the reception desk upon entering the building.\n\nPage 3\n\nJIMMY CARTER Governor of Georgia\n\nGEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE\n\nLT.

Volume VII, Number Two\n\nMAY 1971\n\nII\n\nBy Harold A. Dye\n\nDeputy Director\n\nGeorgia Department of Industry and Trade\n\nGeorgia's industrial development really began in the fifties, largely as a result of legislation equalizing freight rates and a new awakening by Georgians to the need for a more balanced agricultural industrial economy. The old agriculture of the pre-World War I I years could no longer support the population increases and the demands for a better life. The benefits and profits of industry had to be integrated into what had been almost a pure agricultural economy.\n\nThe change to a more balanced economy did not just happen-the state government started it with new legislation and the formation of a state department, now known as the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade, specifically designed to promote industrial development and tourism. Vocational-technical schools were also established and a new emphasis given to industrial development at all levels of education.\n\nThe local governments and local people began literally paving the way for industrial development. Industrial sites and parks were created. The comml:!nities looked at themselves and began to make the changes that would make them even better places to work, play, and live. And the progress already made shows that most of them succeeded.\n\nFinancial institutions, railroads, development authorities, chambers of commerce, garden clubs, and many other organizations joined in their efforts to help Georgia move forward. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce, the Georgia Power Company, and other state-wide organizations also joined the effort.\n\nEven though these groups made significant individual contributions, their combined efforts have only begun to bear fruit in the last few years. One organization which helped create a spirit of co-operation which was needed on a state-wide basis is the Georgia Industrial Developers Association (GIDA).\n\nThe GIDA had its foundation just as the equalization of freight rates was beginning to be felt. In 1959 a small group of state-wide developers informally met for lunch at the old Davis Brothers Cafeteria on Forsyth Street back of the Atlanta Public Library.\n\nInformal sessions continued to be held at various places-banks, Gas Company, Power Company, etc., until 1963 when the first president of the group was elected. Seventeen state-wide development agencies were represented in the election.\n\nIn 1966 the group was reorganized into a \"formal\" organization with Adrian Norton of the Citizens and Southern Bank in Atlanta as the first president.\n\nIn 1967 Ross Hammond of the Georgia Tech Industrial Development Division was elected president. In that year the GIDA made \"recommendations to the Honorable Lester G. Maddox, Governor of Georgia, relating to Improving Georgia's Economy\". Many of these recommendations were put into effect during the next few years.\n\nIn 1968, Nip Galphin of the First National Bank was elected president, followed by Harold Diffenderfer of the Citizens and Southern Bank in 1969, and in 1970 by Hearn Lumpkin of the Georgia Power Company. Dave Morgan of Georgia Tech is the current president.\n\nFrom a beginning of 17 members all from Atlanta, to a present roll of nearly 200 representing almost every community and development agency in the state is quite an accomplishment in so short a time. But the growth in numbers is nothing in comparison to the services rendered by GIDA to the development of Georgia.\n\nGIDA is only an example-there are many other equally effective industrial development agencies in Georgia. Such organizations, in concert with state and local governments, are helpil1g Georgia to move forward in a way that could have never been accomplished by individual.actions alone.\n\nPage 5\n\nMeet The Board\n\nThe Board of Commissioners of the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade is composed of 20 Georgians representing the state's ten congressional districts. \"Meet the Board,\" a special feature designed to introduce each of these men during the coming year, will spotlight five board members each quarter.\n\nAlex S. Boyer, Screven County's Man of the Year, 1970, is a native of Millen. He attended the public school system of Jenkins County as a youngster, then completed his education at Marion Military Institute and received a bachelor of science degree from Midwestern College.\n\nThe father of three, Boyer has been active in farmi ng, cattle raising, and forestry in the Jenkins-Screven County area most of his life. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Screven Cou nty Industrial Corporation and has served in city government in Sylvania some ten years.\n\nWilliam Talmadge Roberts, a Montezuma attorney, attended Biarritz American University and graduated with a law degree from the University of Georgia. He is a Mason, and a member of Phi Delta Theta social fraternity and Phi Alpha Delta, legal fraternity. Roberts has served as Solicitor, City Court of Oglethorpe, since 1953.\n\nConrad J. Sechler is the organizer, chairman of the board, and member of the executive committee of Tucker Federal Savings and Loan Association. He is also president of Empire Mortgage and Investment Company, founder of Delco Finance Company, president of Commercial Securities\n\nPage 6\n\nCorporation, and president of Central Underwriters.\n\nThomas J. Wesley, Jr., a prominent Atlanta real estate developer, is chairman of the board of Allan-Grayson Realty Company, a position he assumed in 1966 prior to serving as the company president for four years. Wesley is former president of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Atlanta, former director of the Atlanta Real Estate Board, member of the Georgia Real Estate Board and National Real Estate Board, and serves as Southeastern Representative of Agency Management Committee, of the National Association of Building Workers and Managers.\n\nFormer Cochran Mayor Buddy M. NeSmith serves as president of four oil companies, including the Boddy NeSmith Transport Company, the Buddy NeSmith Oil Company, the Ace Oil Company of Eastman and the Firebird Airline, Incorporated. As president of the Buddy NeSmith Oil Company he is the Union 76 jobber for 16 middle Georgia counties.\n\nNeSmith is also president of the Cochran Industrial Park, immediate past president of Georgia Oilmen's Association, and serves on the board of directors of the Cook Banking Company and the State Bank of Cochran.\n\nAlex S.

The rest, a refreshing blend of charm and good look, is what Six Flags spoke men de cribe as \"the basics.\"\n\nThe first of the three baSICS greets the visitor upon his arrival at the entrance to Six Flags a one price admission ticket to cover all rides, show, and attractions.\n\nThe remaining basics 1,500 personable young ho ts and hostesse who refer to each and every visitor as a \"special guest\" and impeccably clean thoroughfares and exquisitely laid landscaping- are sprinkled generously throughout the park.\n\nOfficially, Six Flags is classified as a \"historically themed family entertainment center,\" deriving its modus operandi from the flags of six governments-Great Britain, France, Spain, the Confederate States of America, the State of Georgia, and the United State -which have flown over the state at one time or another.\n\nSix Flags is divided into six different theme sections which detail, even down to the architecture and cotuming, each period in Georgia's hi tory.\n\nFrom the rustic setting of Jean Ribaut's river ride in the French section, to the ante-bellum elegance of the Crystal Pistol Music Hall in the Confederate section, the mood is set for fun, staged in history.\n\nThe Crystal Pistol has the same rollicking entertainment that made its 19th century counterparts a gathering place for local villagers and farmers. A soft drink saloon, the music hall features talented young entertainers from throughout the Southeast performing nostalgic melodies and unbeat hits with equal zeal.\n\nShows scheduled for this year are \"Pistol Packers on Parade,\" a lively revue full of slapstick and song, and \"Roman Romp,\" a good natured spoof about some characters the ancient history books forgot to mention. Both shows feature versatile, wholesome entertainment backed by a 12 piece orchestra.\n\nThe spinning satellites of the park's USA area are as modern as the latest moon shot, while the Krofft puppets, also a USA feature, are bringing yesteryear to life again this year with Follies, their most elaborate production to date.\n\nFollies will star a miniature Pearl Bailey, supported by a cast of more than 100 gorgeously costumed dolls, some constructed and outfitted at a cost of $2000 each. Lavish settings such as fireworks, dancing water, and a stage-turned-to-ice will provide appropriate background for the Krofft version of Vaudeville's splendid Ziegfield era.\n\nPage 9\n\nJ\"oaring, J\"plaJ\"hing, whirling . .through four centuries\n\nTwo other playful entertainers are back thi year at Six Flags. Porpoi e Skipper and Dolly are ensconsed in their regular niche the pool near the Spanish fort -after learning a whole new bag of tricks during winter camp in North Carolina.\n\nAnd, as in past years, vocal and instrumental grou ps are entertaining throughout the park, along with Papa Bear, Harvey the Rabbit, and H. R. Pufnstuf, who are always strolling through the park in search of a welcome hand to shake, or an inviting pigtail to tweak.\n\nThere's fantasy in Georgia's heritage as well, and it too, is on display, evoking\n\nPage 10\n\nmany happy Uncle Remus memories with \"Tales of the Okefenokee.\"\n\nShops, stores, restaurant, and exhibits at Six Flags are designed to reweave the fabric of history, al o. Naler's Plantation, specializing in southern fried chicken, is a replica of the Lacey Hotel in Big Shanty, the start of the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nTondee's Tavern in the British area recreates the Savannah pub where Georgia patriots first erected a liberty pole during the Revolutionary War.\n\nA stark and fragrant candle hop adds to the gothic austerity of Castillo de Soto, the mas ive Spanish fort, and\n\nrough hewn benchcs and a pot-bellied stove arc authentic at Clcm Green's School house, a replica of Fulton County's first school built In 1847.\n\nTravel high or low, sit and watch, stand and walk the fun, and thc history that have given it color during the past four centuries, are at Six Flags Over Georgia again this year.\n\nLocated on Interstate 20 west of downtown Atlanta, Six Flags operates daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. June 4 through August 31, and reverts to a weekend operating schedule of 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. during September, October and November.\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nLocated at the head of navigation on Georgia's longest river-the Chattahoochee-Columbus is, and always has been, a natural setting for industry.\n\nAs early as the War Between the States, Columbus was a bustling center of industrial activity, ranking second only to Richmond, Vi rginia, as a war production center.\n\nDuring that crucial period, The Columbus Iron Works was manufacturing guns, the world's first breechloading cannon, and armor for ironclad ships, Haiman's Sword Factory was producing sabers by the hundreds, and Empire Mills was weaving enough cotton goods to literally clothe an army.\n\nIn Columbus, the only Confederate Naval Museum in the world now houses the gunboat Muscogee which was salvaged from the bottom of the Chattahoochee where it had been buried after it was set afire while under construction at the city docks.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Columbus is said to have furnished more troops to the Southern cause, in proportion to population, than any other city, the West Georgia community rapidly recovered the ravages of war.\n\nIn 1872, the world's first ice factory, using Columbus Iron Works machinery, opened. In 1909, the Eagle and Phenix Textile Mill in Columbus\n\nbecame the first in the world to use hyd roelectric power for lighting. About the same time the Lummus Cotton Gin Company manufactured the first gins equipped with an air blast feed system, the most revolutionary improvement in cotton gins since their invention by Eli Whitney.\n\nIn the ensu ing years, the national and international firms of Royal Crown Cola, Tom Huston Peanut Company, Schwobilt Clothes, American Family Life Assurance Company, Martin Theatres, Burnham Van Service, and Golden's Foundry have joined establishments like Columbus Iron Works and Lummus Cotton Gin, to make their home offices in Columbus.\n\nThe city, which serves as the home of Fort Benning, the free world's largest infantry training center, is also nationally known as the second largest textile manufacturing center.\n\nToday, almost a century and a half since it was first carved out of the wilderness, the City of Columbus is about to embark on yet another grand era of development.\n\nWith the construction of a modern state port facility and terminal, the city is on the brink of a new era of water-borne commerce. A recently completed Chattahoochee-Appalachicola-Flint River project now provides a nine-foot navigable channel all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and gives Columbus access to the Gulf Intra-\n\nPage 11\n\nON THE MOVE\n\nColumbus division of the Georgia Power Company\n\n2.5 million government building under con truction\n\nPage 12\n\nOne of Georgia's eight welcome cen\n\nrat d by the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade, in Columbus.\n\ncoastal Waterway and major industrial centers along the eastern seaboard.\n\nLess than six months ago, the city became the choice of the Deuterium Corporation for the location of the company's $88 million heavy water using facility.\n\nThe Deuterium announcement came on the heels of a referendu m consolidating the local county and city governments, making Columbus the first city in the state to take what has been termed a giant step in local government administration.\n\nEffective last January, the newly formed government superseded the previous governments of the City of Columbus and Muscogee County. Based on a mayor-council-manager form of government, the new administration will be housed in a handsome, 13 story $2.5 million structure being built in the business district of downtown Columbus.\n\nOther local improvements, which are now underway and are expected to have a tremendous effect on the city's ability to attract industry in the future, include a computer-oriented police information system, a new traffic helicopter patrol, provisions for quality housing, a beautification program, additional recreation facilities, and upgrading the public transportation system. All totaled, these improvements, and the desire on the part of local citizens to see that they are carried out efficiently, are eloquent expressions of Columbus's achievement as a Georgia community \"on the move\".\n\nPage 13\n\nA spectacular \"living sea\" exhibit to be called \"Sea World\" is to be built on a six-acre beachside tract on Jekyll Island. First of its kind in Georgia, it will be a major year-round tourist attraction. When Sea World opens to the public, trained porpoises, seals and, possibly, penguins will be featured in shows to be presented several times daily, and an array of other marine life, from small colorful tropical fish to ponderous sea turtles and vicious sharks, will be on view at all times. The facility will overlook the ocean from a garden of subtropical flowers, shrubs and trees. Sea World is the second major development for Jekyll announced this year. Plans for construction of an amphitheater for an outdoor historical drama were revealed earlier.\n\nPage 14\n\nANOTHER LOCAL\n\nWELCOME\n\nCompleted this spring, the Macon Tourist Information Center on Interstate 75, is Georgia's fourth locally owned and operated welcome centerothers are located at Dublin, Brunswick, and Darien. Built and operated by the Macon Chamber of Commerce, the Macon center participates in a relatively new program of funding sponsored by the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade. First funded in 1969 by the Georgia General Assembly, the local welcome center program provides appropriations for use in connection with the operation of local welcome centers which amount to 50 percent of the operational budget, not to exceed $5,000 for a year'round center, and not to exceed $2,500 for a center operating on a seasonal basis.\n\nPage 15\n\nISLES\n\nOF\n\nPROMISE\n\nLODGE &\n\nThis time last year, Georgia's Lake Lanier, with nearly 11 million recreation visitors, was sweeping popularity honors among the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 189 man-made lakes and navigational pools across the nation.\n\nThis year, four wooded islands in the center of the 40,000 acre lake are making headlines.\n\nThe four islands, one-half mile offshore with a commanding view of the distant mountains and unseasonably cool weather in summer, are ripe for development.\n\nAnd members of the Lake Lanier Island Development Authority, an autonomous arm of state government, have come up with a plan that promises to turn them into one of the most farsighted, best conceived and most ably managed recreation developments in the country.\n\nMaj. General William A. Cunningham, U.S.A. (Ret.), executive director of\n\nthe authority, explains the philosophy for the development plan this way: \"It is recognized that success of the Lanier Island venture depends upon the provision for the visitor, of a total experience that is pleasing and satisfying. From the time the visitor enters the complex until he leaves, every event, activity, service and facility contributes to the total experience.\n\n\"One bad experience with one small facet of the whole complex can mean, for a particular visitor, a total experience that is unsatisfactory. This means that the projects must be planned, structured and managed as an entity. \"\n\nConstruction has already begun on three million dollars worth of facilities which will provide the nucleus of the complex.\n\nIncluded are basic utilities, roads, administration buildings, and other infrastructure investments, and a one-\n\nhalf-mile long swimming beach, with a bathing pavilion and picnic area, an 18-hole championship golf course, 450 picnic sites, the first 200 of 800 planned campsites, and a harbor bul khead and an esplanade for a planned village area which will be the port of call for the islands. Finally, there are possibilities for an amphitheater, a Japanese Tea House, boat rides, boat rentals, float plane rides, a \"flotel,\" and an adult activities center for arts, crafts, and sports.\n\nTh e initial investment of three million-which came from a grant from the Economic Development Administration and local matching funds-is expected to generate a considerable amount of private investment in hotels, restaurants, cabins, campgrounds, and other service facilities, and provide a strong foundation for a recreational complex that will continue to keep Lake Lanier on the top in popularity throughout the nation.\n\nPage 17\n\nTHE\n\nBECKONING LAND\n\nA group of paintings now on exhibit at the Atlanta High Museum of Art are a graphic illustration of the fact that at least one segment of the American population was showing concern for ecology long before non-returnable bottles and pop-top cans came into the picture.\n\nThe paintings, 74 landscapes and seascapes by noted American artists, have been lent to the High Museum by museums and private collectors throughout the country for a special showing entitled, \"The Beckoning Land. \"\n\nChosen for exhibit because they give a .nostalgic view of the unspoiled out-ofdoors that artists of the 19th century captured on canvas over a century ago, the paintings are accompanied by an exhibition of contemporary photo.graphs of Georgia.\n\nThe contemporary photographs, assembled by Stevens and Wilkinson Architects, the Georgia Conservancy, the High Museum Members Guild, and the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade, are presented alongside the beckoning land of the 19th century to draw attention to the loss Georgians would suffer if abuse of the land is allowed.\n\nEight of the photographs being exhibited are actually advertisements from the current state advertising campaign administered by the Department of Industry and Trade.\n\nPage 18\n\n-\n\nIt's not just somethmg lhdl hclp:> C\"drf) Ions of conlamcnzt:d CtttgO from maJOr d~ water ports C\\Cr')' day.

III\n\n-\n\nNew\n\nConstruction Component\n\nAn unusual new building product will become available to Georgia architects, engineers and builders when a two million dollar plant now under construction at Jonesboro begins operations this summer. The new construction component is Houdaille-Span, a prestressed and machine-extruded hollow-core concrete slab that has gained increasingly popular acceptance in Florida and other southern areas. Its primary use is in floor and roof systems, as well as some wall applications, in commercial and residential construction of both high and low-profile design.\n\nIt is a product of HDW Houdaille, a division of Houdaille Industries, Inc., of Buffalo, N. Y. HDW Houdaille has similar plants at four Florida locations, and one at Houston, Texas, in addition to the plant under construction at Jonesboro.\n\nThe Jonesboro plant will feature two casting beds each 600 feet long, completely enclosed under a single roof to permit all-weather operation. It will have a capacity of 10,000 square feet per day of concrete plank, in varying thicknesses of 4, 6, and 8 inches.\n\nHoudaille Industries is a diversified company with divisions in the automotive, machine-tool and plastics fields in the Northeast, Midwest and Far West, as well as construction and construction materials in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\n((1(Q)Iq~n@ ~(Q)jp)\n\nnews at a glance\n\nPage 21\n\nI\n\nCDNTRDL TDWER\n\nONE WAY T~\n\nGAINESVILLE AIRPORT INDUSTRIAL PARK\n\nPage 22\n\nGAINESVILLE MIDLAND RAILROAD\n\nCDNTRDL TDWER\n\nOWER THE RENT\n\nIt's true. High rental costs often discourage new industry. But, as one North Georgia community recently discovered, there are ways of lowering the rent.\n\nNine times out of ten, the best way is to acquire a tract of land, have a local, non profit organization develop it into suitable industrial sites, and then offer to lease it at an attractive price.\n\nAt least that's one method that has passed the test in the City of Gainesville, bustling community of 16,000 people which supplies the country with a million pounds of poultry and 500,000 dozen eggs a year and is recognized as the \"Poultry Capital of the World.\"\n\nSaturated with the lucrative poultry business, the city began looking around two years ago for avenues of diversification and discovered that there were no desirable, low cost, sites available for new industry.\n\nThe search finally ended with the local airport-where the city owned a large tract of acreage-and the Economic Development Administration-where there was financial assistance for developing the propert)-\\\n\nNow, two years later, all of the sites are complete with water, sewerage drainage, cleared streets, electricity,\n\nand natural gas, and the city is negotiating with prospective tenants of the Gainesville Air Industrial Park.\n\nThe end result, hopefully, will be the location of a number of small business establishments which pay higher than the minimum wage-such as metal working and electrical industries-and will absorb a surplus of workers now available in the Gainesville area.\n\nLocated two miles southeast of downtown Gainesville, the new airport industrial park is accessible to 1-85 or downtown Gainesville via a new four lane highway called the \"Queen City Parkway.\"\n\nThe Gainesville City Commission, which created and developed the park, lists a number of special features including long term leases, high quality standards, land use restrictions, landscaping, and set back requirements.\n\nThe adjacent airport, built in the early forties as a naval air training station, has two runways, one 4,000 feet and one being extended to 5,200 feet. It also features a rotating beacon, runway lighting and an approved instrument approach facility. Aircraft fueling, parking, hangar and maintenance services are provided by the fixed base operator.\n\nPage 23\n\nGROWING GEORGIj~\n\nTODAY'S NEWS TOMORROW'S EGG CARTON\n\nMrs. Knauer went on to say that last year, Americans threw away 48 billion cans, 26 billion bottles, and 40 million tons of paper.\n\n\"Each urban American generates seven pounds of garbage a day, of which an average of four-and-a-half pounds is collected. We spend $4.5 billion a year to get rid of our wastes, and unless we are content to wallow in our own trash, we have to spend an additional $835 million a year just to keep up.\n\n\"Clearly, answers to these massive problems have to be fou nd, and that is why your experiment here in Athens is so important.\"\n\nThe Athens project actually consists of collecting old newspapers and turning them over to the Loef Company, a local scrap metal firm.\n\nFred Loef, an official of the company, explained his part in the project.\n\nGeorgia's first major waste recycling program, begun this winter in Athens, has been hailed by the President of the United States.\n\nThe President's reaction to the program was delivered by Mrs. Virginia Knauer, special assistant for consumer affairs.\n\nMrs. Knauer, in Athens for the project\n\nkick-off, told sponsors of the program-city officials, members of the Athens Consumer Council, and officials of a locaL scrap metal company-that before she left Washington she informed the President of the program.\n\n\"He is very pleased about your exciting experiment. He realizes the importance of your efforts and he hopes your project is a success.\"\n\n\"What we do is accept the paper that the city, the University of Georgia, and the surrounding counties who are participating in the project are collecting.\n\n\"Then we sort it-eliminating anything that is not newsprint, such as magazines, bale what is left, and store it until we find somewhere to ship it for reprocessi ng.\"\n\nLoef said his company, which is primarily dealing in metal reclamation, is not equipped to reprocess paper.\n\n\"There was a time when we re-\n\nPage 24\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _.......\n\n=\n\nGROWING GEOR~...\n\nMrs. Virginia Knauer and Athens Mayor Julius Bishop, participants in the city's r ~ '~\".,g program\n\nprocessed corrugated cardboard. However, after working with it about five years, I finally gave up because I couldn't find enough material to keep the business profitable. At that time, the city was burning all of its paper, and there just wasn't enough interest in collecting it for reclamation.\n\n\"Then, too, there is the added factor of a profit margin. The scrap metal that I deal with brings in more per pound, than the paper I was dealing with before, and believe it, or not, with my cranes, it takes less man hours to handle a ton of lead, than it does to handle a ton of paper, especially with the sorting that is necessary.\n\n\"When the Consumer Action Group approached me about participating in this particular project, I agreed to accept the paper and find a market for it. \"\n\nAt last report, Loef was negotiating with several Georgia firms who process paper.\n\nOne, in Macon, will probably make egg cartons out of any that they buy.\n\nLoef said initial response to the project has been overwelming.\n\n\"In the first 60 days, we had received some 50 tons of newspaper. We got 6,000 pounds in one ten day period from the University of Georgia, alone,\" he added.\n\n\"I think the project is well worth the effort. It shows what people can do if they are made aware of the problems of their environment, and it shows that they are willing to be inconvenienced to clean it up. Some people had to go six, eight, or ten blocks out\n\nof their way to take their paper to a collection point,\" Loef said.\n\nHe said the project, which originally started on a 30 day trial basis, was extended for another 30 days.\n\n\"I recommended that it be extended. During the first 30 days, there was only one trash container at which to dump the paper. I felt we needed more containers across the city, and, wher:l we set more up, we began to get more paper,\" Loef said.\n\nHe indicated he would like for the project to be continued, indefinitely.\n\n\"However, I'm afraid it's all a question of education. As long as the Consumer Action Council can keep the idea in front of the public, the project will be successful. So far, the publicity and advertising has been grand, but you can get just so much space.\n\n\"Naturally, since metals are more my line of business, I'd like to see the project expanded to this area, too. I don't mind admitting that I am a bit selfish in this aspect, but you have to agree that the environment considerations are even greater.\n\n\"J ust this week, I went out and spoke\n\nto a group of Cub Scouts who are interested in collecting metal items that they find littering the landscape.\n\n\"I'm going to provide them with the trucks, and they are going to provide some manpower. Together, I think we can make some more visible progress in cleaning up our country.\"\n\nPage 25\n\nP.O. Box 38097 Atlanta. Georgia 30334\n\nBULK RATE U. S. POSTAGE\n\nPAID\n\nATLANTA, GA.

Volume VII, Number Three\n\nAUGUST, 1971\n\nBy Athens Mayor Julius F. Bishop Chairman, Board of Commissioners Georgia Department of Industry and Trade\n\nMost Georgia cities and those throughout the nation are in dire financial straits-a situation wh ich has come about through a dramatic change in our country during the last 30 years. The State of Georgia, particularly, has experienced a tremendous change as the economy has become more industrial and less dependent on agriculture for its well-being.\n\nThe resulting influx of people into our cities has strained the resources of the cities to\n\ntheir utmost. The cost of utilities such as water mains, sewers, streets, and drainage\n\nI\n\nproblems must be recovered over a number of years, therefore, the increased revenue derived through an increase in population does not satisfy the capital cost of providing\n\nthese facilities. There is a seemingly never ending demand for more money for increasing\n\nthe number of policemen, firemen, and other city employees brought about by increased\n\nneed for their services.\n\nPresently, most cities are earnestly attempting to cope with the strong emphasis nationally on improving the ecology of our country, involving smoke abatement, sewerage treatment, and other measures that will improve our surroundings.\n\nTo clear up the streams of our state by building more and better sewerage treatment plants will cost many millions of dollars. Many miles of truck sewer lines will be needed both inside our cities and also in the unincorporated subdivisions surrounding our cities if we are to effectively restore our streams to their desired state.\n\nI have mentioned only a few of the reasons that our cities are having financial problems, but I believe these are sufficient evidence that our cities desperately need economic relief from federal and state sources if these two entities are going to impose strict requirements in relation to improving our ecology.\n\nIndustry location and increased tourist trade can do much to solve the financial plight of our cities. In the Department of Industry and Trade, we are very much aware of our obligation to the cities and the entire state to help toward locating the right type of industry in the right community. We also accept our responsibility of promoting the tourist business so as to encourage even larger numbers of tourists to visit Georgia.\n\nBefore attempting to attract new industry, each city should be sure that all of the pertinent information needed to supply an industrial prospect is available. After it has been determined that the necessary information is on hand, the matter of presentation of the material should be thoroughly reviewed.\n\nIn attempting to solicit more tourist business it must be realized that every Georgia city has points of interest to the tourist. Even though the Department of Industry and Trade spends many thousands of dollars through television, radio, newspaper, and magazine advertisements promoting tourism, this is not enough.\n\nEach city, if it is to reap the full benefit from state advertising, must make many of its citizens such as service station operators, restaurant employees, motel and hotel employees, and many others aware of the points of interest in their cities. If tourism is promoted to its fullest potential, it will bring in the most revenue for the least capital invested of any major source of revenue.\n\nI fully believe that we have the professional competence in the Department of Industry and Trade to compete favorably with any similar development agency in the country, and we will be extremely pleased and more than willing to lend our services toward furthering the location of industry and in helping to promote tourist activity to communities which request our assistance.\n\nPage 5\n\neet The Board\n\nThe Board of Commissioners of the Georgia Department of Industry and Trade is composed of 20 Georgians representing the state's ten congressional districts. \"Meet the Board,\" a special feature designed to introduce each of these men during the coming year, will spotlight five board members each quarter.\n\nA native of Savannah, W.
