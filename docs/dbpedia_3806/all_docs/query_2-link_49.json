However, little attention has been paid to circumstances specific to SCI that may negatively affect sleep, or to consequences of poor sleep in this population. The objective of this study was to examine the experience of sleep among individuals with SCI. Secondary analysis using thematic coding of qualitative data from an ethnographic study of community-dwelling adults with SCI was conducted. Sleep-related data were found in transcripts for 90% of the sample. Participants described diminished sleep duration and irregular sleep patterns. Several factors contributing to poor sleep were identified, including SCI-related circumstances and sleep environment. Participants also discussed how poor sleep affected occupational engagement. This study highlights the extent of sleep disturbance experienced after SCI and the subsequent impact on occupational performance, and provides direction for clinical practice.\n\nSainburg, R.

We conducted a qualitative pilot study with 11 Latinos in this demographic group to develop a foundational schema for the design of health promotion programs that could be implemented by occupational therapy practitioners in primary care settings for this population. One-on-one interviews addressing routines and activities, health management, and health care utilization were conducted, audiotaped, and transcribed. Results of a content analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following six domains of most concern: Weight Management; Disease Management; Mental Health and Well-Being; Personal Finances; Family, Friends, and Community; and Stress Management. A typology of perceived health-actualizing strategies was derived for each domain. This schema can be used by occupational therapy practitioners to inform the development of health-promotion lifestyle interventions designed specifically for late-middle-aged Latinos.\n\nClark, F.

However, in order to achieve holistic well-being, these individuals may need to pursue life management approaches beyond the requisite coping strategies at the level of the physical (protoself) and the narrative (autobiographical) self. When viewed through the lens of neuroscientist Antonio Damasio's three-tiered framework, it is clear that future conceptualizations of the cancer survivor's unique self within occupational science must transcend Cartesian dualism by turning to a third level—the core self—that acts as a bridge between the physical body and the conscious mind. Ultimately, the authors suggest that through mindful engagement in everyday occupations, cancer survivors may unlock the core self and enjoy enhanced quality of life.\n\nWilcox, R. R., & Clark, F.

A simple strategy is to use an extension of Dunnett’s T3 procedure, which is designed to control the probability of one or more Type I errors. However, this method and related techniques fail to take into account the overall pattern of p-values when making decisions about which hypotheses should be rejected. The paper suggests a multiple comparison procedure that does take the overall pattern into account and then describes general situations where this alternative approach makes a practical difference in terms of both power and the probability of one or more Type I errors. For reasons summarized in the paper, the focus is on 20% trimmed means, but in principle the method considered here is relevant to any situation where the Type I error probability of the individual tests can be controlled reasonably well.\n\nGhaisas, S., Pyatak, E.

We conducted a secondary cross-case analysis of treatment notes of 47 PUPS II participants and identified four patterns relating PrU development to lifestyle changes: positive PrU changes (e.g., healing PrUs) with positive lifestyle changes, negative or no PrU changes with positive lifestyle changes, positive PrU changes with minor lifestyle changes, and negative or no PrU changes with no lifestyle changes.

In this article, we describe the methodology we used for the first phase of a project for the implementation and outcomes assessment of an occupational therapy pressure ulcer prevention intervention for people with spinal cord injury in the Veterans Health Administration. This first phase of the project was guided by practice-based evidence research methodology and resulted in an intervention manual tailored to meet the needs of Veterans and the establishment of a system for documenting and monitoring care processes, patient characteristics, and intervention outcomes. This system, in turn, will provide the data-gathering template for the next phase in which the beneficial effects of the intervention will be assessed. We conclude by recommending that clinicians explore the utility of this approach for the implementation of other novel interventions.\n\nWilcox, R. R., & Clark, F. (2014).

The primary sample included 149 African American and 92 Hispanic men and women aged 60 to 95 years, recruited at senior activity centers and senior residences. Chi-square and logistic regression procedures were undertaken to examine study-based, psychosocial and health-related predictors of retention at 18 months following study entry. For both African Americans and Hispanics, intervention adherence was the strongest predictor. Retention was also related to high active coping and average (vs. high or low) levels of activity participation among African Americans and high social network strength among Hispanics. The results suggest that improved knowledge of the predictors of retention among minority elders can spawn new retention strategies that can be applied at individual, subgroup, and sample-wide levels.\n\nWilcox, R.

While theoretical integration has progressed, much less attention has focused on analytical strategies and tactics. The statistical literature warns that common methods for comparing groups and studying associations can have relatively poor power compared to more modern robust techniques. Here we illustrate, in secondary data analyses using the USC Well Elderly II study (n=460, age 60-95, 66% female), that modern robust methods make a substantial difference when analyzing relations between salivary analyte and behavioral data. Analyses that deal with the diurnal pattern of cortisol and the association of the cortisol awakening response with depressive symptoms and physical well-being are reported. Non-significant results become significant when using improved methods for dealing with skewed distributions and outliers. Analytical strategies and tactics that employ modern robust methods have the potential to reduce the probability of both Type I and Type II errors in studies that compare salivary analytes between groups, across time, or examine associations with salivary analyte levels.\n\nClark, F., Pyatak, E.

Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 84(7), 1543-1551. https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2012.754026 Show abstract\n\nThe most common strategy for comparing two independent groups is in terms of some measure of location intended to reflect the typical observation. However, it can be informative and important to compare the lower and upper quantiles as well, but when there are tied values, extant techniques suffer from practical concerns reviewed in the paper. For the special case where the goal is to compare the medians, a slight generalization of the percentile bootstrap method performs well in terms of controlling Type I errors when there are tied values [Wilcox RR. Comparing medians. Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 2006;51:1934–1943]. But our results indicate that when the goal is to compare the quartiles, or quantiles close to zero or one, this approach is highly unsatisfactory when the quantiles are estimated using a single order statistic or a weighted average of two order statistics. The main result in this paper is that when using the Harrell–Davis estimator, which uses all of the order statistics to estimate a quantile, control over the Type I error probability can be achieved in simulations, even when there are tied values, provided the sample sizes are not too small. It is demonstrated that this method can also have substantially higher power than the distribution free method derived by Doksum and Sievers [Plotting with confidence: graphical comparisons of two populations. Biometrika 1976;63:421–434]. Data from two studies are used to illustrate the practical advantages of the method studied here.\n\nCarlson, M., Park, D. J., Kuo, A., & Clark, F. (2014).

In this paper, we aim to provide a theoretical synthesis by explicating the unique properties of occupation in relation to the self within social science discourse. Occupations relate to other social science constructs in three ways: (a) they recruit a set of associated changes into a person's life; (b) they serve a person's ability to achieve important goals; and (c) they act as a mirror by reflecting multiple dimensions of the self. Key characteristics of occupation such as its experiential salience and its repetitional flavor powerfully amplify its significant role in affecting self-relevant outcomes. Occupation represents a crucial playing field that profoundly affects the unfolding of human lives. Therefore, the continued pursuit of occupational science is warranted and can uniquely contribute to an improved understanding of the self.\n\nWilcox, R. R., Vigen, C., Clark, F., & Carlson, M.

Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods, 12(2), 20-34. https://doi.org/10.22237/jmasm/1383278520 Show abstract\n\nIt is well known that when using the ordinary least squares regression estimator, outliers among the dependent variable can result in relatively poor power. Many robust regression estimators have been derived that address this problem, but the bulk of the results assume that the dependent variable is continuous. It is demonstrated that when there are tied values, several robust regression estimators can perform poorly in terms of controlling the Type I error probability, even with a large sample size. The presence of tied values does not necessarily mean that they perform poorly, but there is the issue of whether there is a robust estimator that performs reasonably well in situations where other estimators do not. The main result is that a modification of the Theil–Sen estimator achieves this goal. Results on the small-sample efficiency of the modified Theil–Sen estimator are reported as well. Data from the Well Elderly 2 Study, which motivated this study, are used to illustrate that the modified Theil–Sen estimator can make a practical difference.\n\nCarlson, M.

Participants were 460 community-dwelling older adults who responded to (1) global activity evaluations, (2) activity participation frequency scales, and (3) indices of life satisfaction, depression, and physical and mental health-related quality of life. Regression analyses indicated that global activity evaluations had a stronger relationship to psychosocial outcome indices than did participation frequency ratings, although both measurement approaches were associated with statistically significant predictions. However, global evaluations and participation frequency ratings were approximately equal in their ability to predict physical health-related quality of life. These relationships were fairly consistent across ethnic groups. Overall, the results suggest that ideally the two strategies for assessing activity should be incorporated in future research on activity and occupational therapy practice.\n\nPyatak, E.

However, the rigorous and highly controlled conditions of RCTs can be difficult to attain when conducting research among individuals living with a confluence of disability, low socioeconomic status, and being a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, who may be more likely to have unstable life circumstances. Research on effective interventions for these groups is urgently needed, because evidence regarding approaches to reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes is lacking. In this methodologic article, we discuss the challenges and lessons learned in implementing the Lifestyle Redesign for Pressure Ulcer Prevention in Spinal Cord Injury study among a highly disadvantaged population. These issues are discussed in terms of strategies to enhance recruitment, retention, and intervention relevance to the target population. Recommendations for researchers seeking to conduct RCTs among socioeconomically disadvantaged, ethnically diverse populations are provided.\n\nClark, F. A., Park, D. J., & Burke, J. P. (2013).

This article examines the transition from research to implementation in the context of the dissemination of A. Jean Ayres' sensory integration procedures and of the challenges currently facing the University of Southern California Well Elderly Studies research team. Drawing from the emerging field of implementation science, this article discusses how researchers can develop an implementation plan to more easily translate evidence into practice. Such plans should address the intervention's reach (i.e., its capacity to penetrate into the intended target population), the settings for which it is applicable, the leaders who will encourage practitioner uptake, stakeholder groups, and challenges to dissemination. By taking action to ensure the more effective dissemination of research-generated knowledge, researchers can increase the likelihood that their interventions will lead to improvements in practice and more effective care for consumers.\n\nWilcox, R.

In the statistics literature, hundreds of papers make it clear that under general conditions the answer is yes and that routinely used strategies for dealing with violations of assumptions can be unsatisfactory. Moreover, a vast array of new and improved techniques is now available for dealing with violations of assumptions, including more flexible methods for dealing with curvature. The paper reviews the major insights regarding standard methods, explains why some seemingly reasonable methods for dealing with violations of assumptions are technically unsound, and then outlines methods that are technically correct. It then illustrates the practical importance of modern methods using data from the Well Elderly II study.\n\nClark, F. A. (2012).

Toward the latter end, intervention manuals are essential for ensuring trustworthiness and replicability of randomized controlled trials that aim to provide evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy. In this article, we review the literature on the process of intervention manualization. We then illustrate the prescribed steps through our experience in implementing the University of Southern California/Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center's collaborative Pressure Ulcer Prevention Project. In this research program, qualitative research provided the initial foundation for manualization of a multifaceted occupational therapy intervention designed to reduce the incidence of medically serious pressure ulcers in adults with spinal cord injury.\n\nWerner, J.

In this study, the objective was to examine possible psychometric inadequacies of reverse-scored items on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) when used to assess ethnically diverse older adults. Using baseline data from a gerontologic clinical trial (n = 460), we tested the hypotheses that the reversed items on the CES-D (a) are less reliable than nonreversed items, (b) disproportionately lead to intraindividually atypical responses that are psychometrically problematic, and (c) evidence improved measurement properties when an imputation procedure based on the scale mean is used to replace atypical responses. In general, the results supported the hypotheses. Relative to nonreversed CES-D items, the 4 reversed items were less internally consistent, were associated with lower item-scale correlations, and were more often answered atypically at an intraindividual level. Further, the atypical responses were negatively correlated with responses to psychometrically sound nonreversed items that had similar content. The use of imputation to replace atypical responses enhanced the predictive validity of the set of reverse-scored items. Among older adult respondents, reverse-scored items are associated with measurement difficulties. It is recommended that appropriate correction procedures such as item readministration or statistical imputation be applied to reduce the difficulties.\n\nClark, F. A. (2011).

The innovative qualitative methodology used blended elements of the anthropological tradition of life history ethnography, ethnomethodology, the naturalistic methods used by Mattingly and Schön to study practice, and especially narrative analysis as described by Polkinghorne. The bulk of the paper is presented in the form of a narrative analysis that provides an account of a stroke survivor's personal struggle for recovery, a story that emerged from transcription, coding, and analysis of transcripts from approximately 20 hours of interview time. First, this narrative analysis provides an example of how the occupational science framework can evoke a particular kind of storytelling in which childhood occupation can be related to adult character. Storytelling of this kind is later shown to be therapeutic for the stroke survivor. Next, the narrative illustrates how rehabilitation can be experienced by the survivor as a rite of passage in which a person is moved to disability status and then abandoned. Finally, a picture is given of how occupational story making and occupational storytelling embedded in real life can nurture the human spirit to act and can become the core of clinical practice.\n\nClark, F.

Zero-order correlations consistently demonstrated meaningful relationships between the MAPA and scales of psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life. Results from multiple regression analyses further substantiated these findings, as greater meaningful activity participation was associated with better psychological well-being and health-related quality of life. The MAPA appears to be a reliable and valid measure of meaningful activity, incorporating both subjective and objective indicators of activity engagement.\n\nEakman, A. M., Carlson, M.

The EMAS evidenced moderate test-retest reliability (r = .56) and good internal consistency (α = .89). Exploratory factor analysis (principal components) discerned a two-component structure within the EMAS, indicative of Personal-Competence and Social-Experiential meaning. The EMAS demonstrated theoretically predicted zero-order correlations with measures of meaning and purpose in life, depressive symptomology, life satisfaction, and health-related quality of life. Regression analyses discerned that purpose and meaning in life consistently predicted the EMAS and its components. Furthermore, individuals reporting greater levels of Social-Experiential relative to Personal-Competence meaning had the lowest levels of physical health-related quality of life. This study offers initial evidence in support of the EMAS as a valid measure of meaningful activity in older adults.\n\nJackson, J. M., Carlson, M. E., Rubayi, S., Scott, M. D., Atkins, M.

Data from a subset of these individuals are described; each of these stories contains a pressure ulcer risk episode related to wheeled mobility or cushion use. Identified risk episodes were associated with wheelchair selection, wheelchair adjustment, habituation to new equipment, lifestyle choices, and challenging life contexts. Examples highlighted the crucial relationship between individuals’ minute-to-minute decision-making and pressure ulcer risk.\n\nDunn, C. A., Carlson, M. E., Jackson, J. M., & Clark, F. A. (2009).

Full text Show abstract\n\nDuring the past century, numerous researchers and theorists have argued that human lives are largely shaped by the nonreflective realm of habit. Beyond this observation, however, scholarly conceptualizations of habit are widely divergent, ranging from neural-level to culturally saturated macro-level constructs. To clarify the multiple ways that habit has been construed and is related to rehabilitation, the authors present a typology of nine categories of habits: habit as tic; habit as neural networks; habit as conditioned responses; habit as addiction; habit as single, everyday activities; habit as routine; habit as custom, ritual, rite, or ceremony; habit as character; and habit as habitus. Although these categories overlap and share common properties, their conceptual features differ along several dimensions. Each category offers a distinct perspective from which to understand the role of habit in the lives of clients undergoing rehabilitation, which the authors illustrate using examples from the Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study (PUPS), a qualitative study on the contextual factors that lead to serious recurrent pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injuries. The authors argue that habit is a ubiquitous, protean force that presents itself in many interlinking forms, steering the course of human lives in both health-promoting and destructive directions. To have the greatest effect on health and participation, rehabilitation professionals must examine the nuanced ways that habit may operate both in the lives of clients and in professional practice.\n\nXie, B., Chou, C.

However, to continue to thrive, the discipline must remain responsive to the changing times and environment. This paper assesses the current health of occupational science based on the plight of other academic disciplines such as sociology and geography whose future is presently threatened. The intellectual vitality of occupational science is strong, yet the discipline must continue to solidify its interdisciplinary commitment, increase the number of publications, and expand its research scope. Beyond this, strategic planning to keep occupational science alive and well in the future will require nurturing the symbiotic relationship between the discipline and the occupational therapy profession. To the extent that occupational therapy thrives, occupational science must be better positioned, with the resource base and links to practice it needs to flourish. Finally, viewing occupational science as a kind of living organism whose survival can be described through principles of evolutionary biology can also help with the formulation of strategic initiatives. In this paper, I use this framework to identify long-term survival strategies for occupational science. I then present an heuristic model for developing customized survival plans for occupational science programs within the US and for the discipline in general. The occupational science program at the University of Southern California is used to illustrate the implementation of the heuristic model in terms of: national and global priorities; university/institutional culture, mission and values; university colleagues, networks, and programs; and departmental research and education programs. I believe occupational science will thrive in the future if occupational scientists develop and implement customized survival plans for their educational programs that are responsive to the opportunities and challenges present in their respective settings.\n\nXie, B., Chou, C.

Although pressure ulcers are often assumed to be preventable, research suggests that more than three fourths of individuals with an SCI will develop a pressure ulcer over the course of their lifetime. The total annual cost to treat these ulcers is nearly $1.5 billion. Not only can pressure ulcers be potentially life-threatening, but they can also impede the rehabilitation process and significantly disrupt the quality of life of persons with an SCI.\n\nBecause the pressure ulcer problem among persons with an SCI is so severe, it is important for clinicians to develop a full understanding of the underlying contributing factors in attempting to reduce pressure ulcer risk. Research has demonstrated that in the realm of lifestyle choices, factors such as poor fitness, inadequate nutrition, unemployment, decreased social involvement, substance abuse, and emotional stress can increase the risk for developing pressure ulcers. By focusing on generalizable quantitative relationships between variables, these researchers have demonstrated that, on average, individuals with an SCI who manifest a particular risk factor have a greater likelihood of developing a pressure ulcer.\n\nClark, F.

In the city of Los Angeles, thousands of young people come under the influence of gang culture and in turn, lead lifestyles destructive to themselves and society. This paper begins with a few statistics which paint a grim picture of the existence of street gang members and the impact of street gang involvement. Following, there is a story of one youth’s path from immigration to the United States to his involvement with a street gang which eventually led to his participation in the New Occupations for Life Program. This pilot program, developed by the University of Southern California Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, targeted the harmful occupations of 100 Hispanic and African-American teenagers at-risk for gang involvement. The program provided a safe context for disestablishing gang allegiances, building community, and exploring socially acceptable, productive occupations. In this liminal space, these at-risk youth were given the opportunity to experience other “modes of being” within the context of meaningful and enjoyable occupations. Clark and her colleagues offer their interpretation of this transformative process and share their optimism about the power of occupation to change the lives of at-risk youth.\n\nCarlson, M.

In this paper, the importance of occupation as providing a fundamental, personally relevant context for the enactment of sustainable lifestyle choices that foster successful ageing is described. This stress on the significance of occupation is supported by the successful outcome of an experimental test of a preventive occupational therapy intervention designed to promote health and psychosocial well-being in community dwelling elders. Based on the theory and research that is discussed, a practically oriented synthetic overview is provided of the conditions conducive to successful ageing.\n\nJackson, J. M., Carlson, M.

In this article, the philosophical background, manner of development, topical content, methods of program delivery, and mechanisms underlying the program's positive effects are discussed, along with implications for occupational therapy practice. The treatment was based on application of occupational science theory and research and emphasized the therapeutic process of lifestyle redesign in enabling the participants to actively and strategically select an individualized pattern of personally satisfying and health-promoting occupations.

In this paper, I reflect upon two aspects of the human as an occupational being: 1) the biological need for occupation, and 2) tempo and temporality as a way of beginning to generate a blueprint for global health. Wilcock’s theory on the human need for occupation proposes that people living in post industrial nations are diverted from engagement in occupations that function to meet biological needs. The theory largely addresses the issue of what kinds of occupations are likely to be health promoting, given a set of assumptions about the history of humans as occupational beings. On the surface it would appear that occupations that resemble those of prehistoric men and women would be optimal for promoting health and wellbeing, but these kinds of occupations are largely unsuitable for incorporation into contemporary lifestyles. Yet, there are elements of prehistoric occupations that can be recaptured in contemporary activity, and I speculate on the form such occupation might take as a way of addressing the general question of what kinds of occupations are likely to be health promoting . The beginning blueprint for global health through occupation must also take into account the nature of occupational beings in relation to tempo and temporality. I argue that there is an intersection between tempo and temporality. The tempo of occupation is simply defined as its pace and rhythm. Temporality, in contrast, has to do with how we understand occupation in relation to past, present, and future events. When life is rushed as it is in the fast lane of modernity, the result can be the forgetting-ofbeing, or stated otherwise, doing without being. I suggest that healthier people and a healthier world could result from a blueprint generated through occupational science research that identifies the patterns of occupation that are likely to be maximally health promoting and the pace at which they should be undertaken.\n\nClark, F.

American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 50(2), 99-108. https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.50.2.99 Show abstract\n\nOlder adults are at increased risk for a variety of physical and functional limitations that threaten their ability to lead independent and fulfilling lives. Consequently, they stand to benefit from personalized strategies of adaptation that enable them to achieve successful outcomes in their daily activities and desired goals. In the current investigation, a qualitative descriptive methodology was used to document the perceived life domain of importance and associated strategies of adaptation of 29 residents of Angelus Plaza, a federally subsidized apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles for low-income, well older adults. On the basis of interview data, 10 life domains were identified, and within each domain, a typology of adaptive strategies was derived. The domains were activities of daily living (ADL), adaptation to a multicultural environment, free time usage, grave illness and death–spirituality, health maintenance, mobility maintenance, personal finances, personal safety, psychological well-being and happiness, and relationships with others. Although the typology should not be generalized to a geriatric population, therapists may wish to refer to it to gain a sense of the extent to which certain adaptive strategies may be applicable to the lives of particular older adults to whom they deliver services. The teaching of these adaptive strategies could then be incorporated into an individualized treatment plan.\n\nThe typology also provides a broad picture of the kinds of adaptive strategies used by the older adults as a way of coping and adapting to their setting. Although some of the domains do not differ from those typically addressed in occupational therapy textbooks on geriatric care (e.g., ADL, health maintenance), others seem uniquely tailored to the specifics of the Angelus Plaza context (e.g., personal safety). Finally, certain domains emerged that may be highly relevant to older adults in most settings but are not typically the focus of occupational therapy programs (e.g., grave illness and death–spirituality, relationships with others). The emergence of these domains from our data suggests that therapists may wish to consider them more in treatment if they are convinced that they possess local relevance.\n\nCarlson, M.

A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the degree of effectiveness of occupational therapy for older persons. For a sample of 15 distinct tests of occupational therapy, a positive unweighted mean effect size of .51 (54 when corrected for instrument unreliability) was obtained, along with a highly significant cumulative result for treatment success (p < .001). Beneficial treatment effects extended to activities of daily living—functional and psychosocial outcomes. The results for physical outcomes suggested a beneficial effect, although not every meta-analytic test yielded significant results. It was concluded that factors such as publication bias or poor study design are incapable of accounting for the positive meta-analytic result and that occupational therapy represents a worthwhile treatment option for older persons.\n\nZemke, R., & Clark, F.

Since the time of occupational therapy's founding, the term occupation has been used to refer to an individual's active participation in self-maintenance, work, leisure, and play (American Occupational Therapy Association [AOTA], 1993; Bing, 1981; Levine, 1991; Meyer, 1922). Within the literature of the field, however, the meaning of occupation has been ambiguous because the term has been used interchangeably with other concepts. This paper's intent is to distinguish the term occupation from other terms, to summarize traditional beliefs about its nature and its therapeutic value, and to identify factors that have impeded the study and discussion of occupation.\n\nClark, F.

The innovative qualitative methodology used blended elements of the anthropological tradition of life history ethnography, ethnomethodology, the naturalistic methods used by Mattingly and Schön to study practice, and especially narrative analysis as described by Polkinghorne. The bulk of the paper is presented in the form of a narrative analysis that provides an account of a stroke survivor's personal struggle for recovery, a story that emerged from transcription, coding, and analysis of transcripts from approximately 20 hours of interview time. First, this narrative analysis provides an example of how the occupational science framework can evoke a particular kind of storytelling in which childhood occupation can be related to adult character. Storytelling of this kind is later shown to be therapeutic for the stroke survivor. Next, the narrative illustrates how rehabilitation can be experienced by the survivor as a rite of passage in which a person is moved to disability status and then abandoned. Finally, a picture is given of how occupational story making and occupational storytelling embedded in real life can nurture the human spirit to act and can become the core of clinical practice.\n\nClark, F.

A doctoral program in occupational science has been established at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. With its emphasis on the provision of a multidimensional description of the substrates, form, function, meaning, and sociocultural and historical contexts of occupation, occupational science emphasizes the ability of humans throughout the life span to actively pursue and orchestrate occupations. In this paper, occupational science is described, defined, and distinguished from other social sciences. A general systems model is presented as a heuristic to explain occupation and organize knowledge in occupational science. The development of occupational science offers several key benefits to the profession of occupational therapy, including (a) fulfillment of the demand for doctoral-level faculty members in colleges and universities; (b) the generation of needed basic science research; and (c) the justification for and potential enhancement of practice.\n\nCarlson, M.

The criteria of genuineness and trustworthiness are proposed as crucial for the evaluation of the soundness of available research methodologies for the extension of occupational science. Next, exemplars of research methodologies that meet these criteria are described. In the conclusion, the role that nonscientific ways of knowing, such as art and literature, may play in the understanding of human occupation is discussed.\n\nDanner, P., & Clark, F. A. (1991).

Although Dr. Cohen is to be applauded for providing an excellent review of some aspects affecting the testing of pure vestibular responses and for attempting to educate therapists on the validity of a widely used test, she has failed to recognize the distinction between the testing of pure vestibular responses and the purpose of the Southern California Postrotary Nystagmus Test (SCPNT) (Ayres, 1975).

Sixteen subjects participated in the program. A cost-benefit questionnaire was completed by the program participants to examine whether the availability of such a maternal preparation program would influence future selections of a hospital for delivery. Our occupational therapy maternal role preparation program was provided to the subjects in four sessions. The program included material on physiological changes in the new mother, orchestration of activities of daily living, infant development and individual differences, and the mother-infant relationship. Results were statistically significant only for the factor of the mothers' satisfaction with their obstetric care and preparation for the maternal role, in favor of the treatment group. In addition, all 8 members of the treatment group reported that they thought the program was helpful and would recommend it to other mothers.\n\nClark, F., Mailloux, Z., Parham, L. D., & Bissell, J.

The questionnaire was conceptualized as an extension and application of sensory integrative theory into the domain of maternal role preparation. The instrument assessed (a) a mother's knowledge of the sensory capacity of the newborn and (b) a mother's perception ofher ability to influence tbe development of her child. The subjects were 55 primaparas of newborn infants who responded to the questionnaire within 3 days postpartum. The findings demonstrated that the questionnaire measured tbe two traits reliably. Additionally, they indicated that knowledge of the sensory capacity of the newborn correlated positively with perceived influence on deuelopment. Maternal age did not correlate with tbe mothers' knowledge of the sensory capacity of tbe child, but did correlate with perceived influence of mothers on development. Educational level of the respondent correlated with scores on both subscales. With further research, it is foreseen that this questionnaire may be used by occupational therapists as a part of a screening interview for identifying mothers who may be at risk for failure to provide adequate sensory experiences for their children.\n\nClark, F.

Full text Show abstract\n\nSuggests that educational planning for autistic children has yet to undergo significant change as a consequence of findings that link autism to an underlying neuropathophysiological substrate. With occupational therapy's emphasis on the neurobiologic substrates of functional performance, it may be that researchers in this profession can, based on the current etiologic breakthroughs, develop new theories of practice, or refine existing ones, pertinent to autism. The author reviews recent research on the etiology of autism and discusses educational assessment and programming in light of the neuropathophysiology of autism. It is recommended that occupational-therapist involvement in autism be expanded through instrument development and refinement of theories used in clinical practice. Through this enterprise, occupational therapy may further establish its role in the educational management of autistic children, clarifying its relationship to special education.\n\nClark, F. A.

Full text Show abstract\n\nThe psycholinguistic model of learning disabilities and with it the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), are in widespread use in the fields of special education and speech pathology. As occupational and physical therapists have become more involved in sensory integrative procedures, they are sometimes expected to interpret the Southern California Sensory Integrative Tests in relation to results on the ITPA. This paper provides an overview of the ITPA, describing the psycholinguistic model from which it was developed and the research on its usefulness, reliability and validity. Since the majority of studies suggest that the validity of the ITPA is questionable when it is not used in conjunction with other tests and since the tests may not be sensitive enough to therapeutic changes as a consequence of therapy, a recommendation is made that therapists exercise considerable discretion in using this test for research purposes. At the same time, the test may be a useful supplement in clinical evaluation.\n\nBenson, J., & Clark, F. A. (1982). A guide for instrument development and validation.

Therapists will need to construct new or refine existing instruments to satisfy the requirements of third-party payment. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a new instrument is planned, developed, and validated. A sequential step-by-step process is illustrated with a flowchart and applied in the hypothetical construction of an attitude scale to assess school administrators' valuing of the role of occupational therapists in the schools. This example is provided to show how general psychometric principles are applied within an occupational therapy context.\n\nClark, F. A., Gabrielli, W. F., Mednick, S. A., & Venables, P. H. (1982).

While their research question is of obvious interest to speech pathologists, its relevance to occupational therapists is not readily apparent. Without such a linkage, one could take the stand that there is insufficient justification to warrant publication in The American Journal of Occupational Therapy. However, we believe that a potential relationship between occupational therapy and language acquisition has been established by several empirical theoretical works discussed below. Further support for the relationship between occupational therapy and language acquisition derives from PL 94-142, and two frames of reference in occupational therapy practice.\n\nShuer, J., Clark, F.

Full text Show abstract\n\nThe expertise of speech pathologists and occupational therapists was combined to compare the relative effectiveness of an operant approach, a modified sensory integrative approach, and a combination of both methods in eliciting vocalization on other developmental skills on a sample of 27 profoundly retarded, minimally vocal, institutionalized adults. The combined results indicated that the therapy programs promoted significant gains in frequency of eye contact, frequency of vocalization, and quality of postural adaptation. There were no differences in the effects of the respective therapies. The fact that the more controversial sensory integrative procedures elicited comparable gains when compared with the more widely recognized operant method lends credence to the viability of sensory integrative methods."
