This contains some rich stories about the development of French Post Park, the Wabash and Erie Canal, Potowatomi Trail of Death, and other Wabash River related items. Stuart was instrumental in developing French Post Park and is laid to rest in Seceder Cemetery in Adams Township.\n\nCarroll County, Indiana Postal History; Rural Settlement; Towns, Development of Modes of Travel; Townships by Dora Thomas Mayhill, 1954 Published by Banner Publishing Company; Knightstown, Indiana; Reprinted by the Bookmark, Knightstown, Indiana with some additional pictures and additional notes by Dora Thomas Mayhill on pg. 155.
