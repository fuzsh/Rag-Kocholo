Portugal is not the largest coffee producer in the world, as the title belongs to Brazil, Colombia, or Ethiopia. However, it is undeniable that Portugal possesses a robust coffee culture. Portuguese coffee‚Äôs consumption stands at 4 kg per person annually. Moreover, the one of the two coffee plantations in Europe is located on the island of S√£o Jorge in the Azores. The Polish coffee culture is still developing. The value of the market is estimated at 7 billion PLN annually. Expert forecasts underline the growth of the specialty coffee market, which in Poland stands at 2% of the total Polish coffee market value. Portugal plays an important role in this process, since Poland is one of the fastest-growing export markets for Portuguese coffee. According to the estimation of Observatory of Economic Complexity - OEC, Portugal only exported 98,684 kilograms of coffee to Poland between the years 2021 and 2022. Is it time for a short coffee break? ‚òï #PPCC #summerpost #coffee #coffeemarket #coffeeculture #Portugal #Poland\n\nThis week's translation was an agreement of a product with a denomination of origin. Do you know what this means? ü§î üëâ According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), geographical indication is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin. üëâ An appellation or denomination of origin is a special kind of geographical indication generally consisting of a geographical name or a traditional designation used on products that have a specific quality or characteristics that are essentially due to the geographical environment in which they are produced. Usually, it refers to a locality, city, country, or region where the product has been collected, transformed, or manufactured. They both protect the product name from misuse or imitation. üíØ üåè The names of certain beverages, such as Tequila, Champagne, or Pisco are typical examples of these specialized brands, which are recognized worldwide for their particular characteristics. üá¶üá∑ In Argentina, we can mention YERBA MATE, SALAME DE TANDIL, and CHIVITO CRIOLLO DEL NORTE NEUQUINO as denominations of origin. üßâüòäüîñüòã\n\nYesterday we had a very insightful panel discussion in the main auditorium of Semana Internacional do Caf√© in #MinasGerais, #Brazil. First, Marcos Jank gave us a very interesting overview of Brazil¬¥s path for commodity success over the last 20 years. Coffee is just one of the many commodities where Brazil¬¥s impressive productivity growth (both in total factor productivity and on yields per hectare, averaging 2,57% per year over the last 45 years) has made this country one of the main sources of calories for the whole world. Among the challenges for the future, professor Jank highlighted the need to improve Brazil¬¥s image as a source through, among others, added value programs and differentiation in a similar way that Colombian coffee or Australian beef has done. Then Priscilla Lins from Sebrae-MG presented her views on the role specific origins can address this challenge, adapting the differentiation narrative to specific market and consumer requirements prevalent in the modern world. Lastly, I had the opportunity to share some aspects of the Colombian coffee experience and the road ahead of documenting differentiation through deeper product knowledge, which is an integral part of any #geographicalindications project. Looking forward to my next trip to Minas Gerais, hopefully in the near future.\n\nAt the 15th edition of the Cocoa and Chocolate Fair in Lima (Peru), Switzerland was the partner country, chosen for its tradition and importance in the global chocolate industry. For this reason, it organised an important delegation with various activities with companies, experts and SMEs, led by the Swiss Embassy and #SECO. In addition, the Swiss Chamber of Commerce organised the Swiss Pavilion for visitors. A delegation of Swiss experts was in Lima to participate in conferences, field visits, business meetings, exhibitions, seminars and tastings for buyers and producers. These activities included the participation of #SIPPO with #Swisscontact and other Swiss cooperation partners such as SECO, #SWISSCO, the Swiss Chamber of Commerce, Helvetas, etc. The Swiss delegation was led by the Swiss Ambassador to Peru. SIPPO was present to support its partners, #PROMPERU and #Agromercado (formerly SSE), with its international consultant, Jeroen (Jerome) Kruft, on cocoa markets and trends, and its local expert, Vilsic Bocangel who developed a sensory map and offered a tasting of Peruvian chocolates to buyers attending the business roundtable organised by Promperu and other sessions for exhibitors organised by Agromercado_MIDAGRI. This roundtable addressed key questions about chocolate production: ‚ñ∂ How do European chocolate manufacturers address business sustainability? ‚è© Which sustainable cocoa and chocolate production practices have proven to be the most effective? ‚û° How are new regulations affecting the cocoa and chocolate supply chain? The cocoa tasting made the business roundtable more effective and, according to Promperu, has a projected turnover of 7.2 million dollars over the next 12 months. ‚èπ As a next step, SIPPO has developed a set of strategic recommendations for the positioning of the event, that will be delivered by SECO to the Peruvian association of cocoa producers #APPCACAO, the leader of the Cocoa and Chocolate Show.\n\nüá≠üá≥ Read our latest blog post and explore the Journey of Honduran coffee from the perspective of our Chief Coffee Officer, Jorge Cuevas üå± In this post, Jorge shares his thoughts on the development and evolution of the coffee-growing industry in Honduras after his recent trip to the country; he talks about the changes and improvements he's seen over the years, as well as the most recent and pressing challenges coffee producers face in Honduras. ‚òï So go grab a cup of coffee, click the link below, and give the blog post a read! https://bit.ly/3xhipBE\n\nThe social and economic impact and the boom of specialty coffee production in coffee growing communities and in Colombia.

For a long time, coffee was cultivated in the country solely for domestic consumption, but in 1776, an important milestone occurred: the first seeds were planted in the Southeast region, specifically in Rio de Janeiro, which brought more prominence to the product. However, it was in the 19th century that things really began to change. Coffee consumption was on the rise, and Brazilian producers saw a unique opportunity amidst the gold crisis in Portugal and the intense competition for sugar. üí∞ Coffee was the obvious choice, and its production quickly began to grow. üåç With increasing demand, attractive prices, and lower costs, coffee soon became Brazil's main export product. The country's economy revolved around coffee plantations, especially between the regions of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo. Coffee became the backbone of the Brazilian economy, but the challenges faced deeply shaped its trajectory. What else is yet to come? üå± Keep following our posts to discover how coffee has endured tough times and become the driving force of a nation. ‚òï #BrazilianCoffeeHistory #AtlanticaCoffee #CoffeeHistory #BrazilianCoffees #CoffeeInBrazil"
