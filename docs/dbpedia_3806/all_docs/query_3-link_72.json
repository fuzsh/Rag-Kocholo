        "text": "HISTORY OF PUBLIC LANDS\n\nThomas Jefferson was involved in the creation of the public land measurement system. Land description that we use today is possible because of this rectangular measurement system.\n\nThe measurement system went through a 21-year trial and error period mainly in Ohio. The system was found workable and adopted as the U.S. Land Measurement System in 1805."
