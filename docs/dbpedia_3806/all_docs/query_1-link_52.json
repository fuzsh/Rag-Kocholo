        "text": "Verida to Open New Headquarters Office\n\nSept 1, 2022 | Atlanta, Georgia\n\nAs Verida shares the news of its new name, another major milestone for the company is underway. President and CEO Steve Adams announced that the company will be moving into a new headquarters building this fall in Villa Rica, Georgia roughly 30 miles west of Atlanta.\n\nThe new state-of-the-art energy-efficient building was designed with employees in mind, It has two large breakrooms with several seating areas. On nice spring days, employees will be able to open large garage-style doors in the break room on the terrace level to a connected outdoor space.\n\nThe building has collaborative, open spaces throughout the three floors for comfortable meeting spaces or individual working areas. The new headquarters is surrounded by a wooded area with a walking trail around the building.\n\nOutside the office, Villa Rica is located right off Interstate 20 West, providing easy access to and from Atlanta. It’s only 15 minutes from Douglasville and convenient to the University of West Georgia and West Georgia Technical College. It has an active downtown with unique shops, a variety of restaurants and bars, and even an amphitheater where local free concerts and art shows are held. The “City of Gold” was once a mining town and boasted the first gold strike in Georgia. There is a gold museum with tours, a train, and various children’s activities!\n\nWelcome to Verida."
