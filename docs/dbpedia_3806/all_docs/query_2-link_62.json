Click Here\n\nThe field of geographic sciences takes many forms and has been continuously evolving over the years. Physical geography specifically deals with aspects of climate, weather, wind currents, and aquatic movements. A subfield of physical geography is the field of climatology. As a recently established field under the umbrella of geographic sciences, climatology aims to address the continuous damage mankind is inflicting upon the earth’s natural atmosphere, weather, and climate by studying its causes, effects, and practical mitigation techniques.\n\nDevelopments in the field are becoming increasingly needed by the day, as the devastating effects of climate change take hold, and are unleashed upon cities, and human settlements. The biggest offender that contributes to the threat of climate change is the consumption of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources of energy, namely to meet the rising demand for energy in urban environments. In pursuit of technological advancement, economic prowess, and global success, many cities have turned a blind eye to the harmful effects of unsustainable practices in urban development. These practices cost the world, and the cities, their respective livability, habitability, and continuity. They are short-term solutions to long-term problems.\n\nWhile the spotlight is often shed on urban environments when it comes to the discussion of climate change, the environment that takes on the brunt of climate change’s detriments is the rural counterpart. Isolated from the interconnected network of cities, rural areas suffer the most due to physical isolation, limited access to infrastructural services, economic stagnation, and a reliance on natural habitats and environments such as rivers, lakes, fertile land, and wildlife. The sustainability of natural habitats and ecological structures is of utmost importance for the flourishing of rural environments, and climate change poses a direct threat to them. The livelihoods of people in rural areas are in danger due to climate change, which causes degradation of coastal areas effectively inhibiting fishing activities, floods and droughts that limit agricultural developments, and so on.\n\nGeographers and climatologists have been sounding the alarm about climate change for several years, presenting undeniable evidence of mankind’s undue influence on the climate, marine and land life, as well as the topography of Earth’s crust. Urban environments are the locus of discussion when it comes to climate change mitigation, due to housing a vast majority of humanity’s population, and the requirements of meeting the demands of a dense population. Perhaps furthering the detrimental effects of climate change, the degradation of rural areas causes migration waves to urban environments, further exacerbating climate-impacting activities, and hindering adaptation capabilities in rural environments. Sustainable techniques that aim to lessen the acceleration of climate change include shifting away from automobile dependence, the inclusion of green public spaces, incorporating energy-saving techniques in cities, and the utilization of renewable energy.\n\nThe first international conference on “Geographic Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation in Urban and Rural Environments” will highlight advancements and innovations in geography and climatology, and their role in climate change mitigation and adaptation techniques in urban and rural environments.\n\nScope\n\nThe first edition of the Geographic Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation in Urban and Rural Environments conference aims to discuss and elaborate on topics pertaining to climatic mitigation in urban and rural environments in nations and cities, specifically in a geographic context. These geographic contexts include Hydrology, Climatology, Digital Geography, and more. The conference will aggregate research that innovates and disseminates upon topics pertaining to climatic mitigation in urban and rural environments, weather forecasting, atmospheric pollution, governmental policies affecting climate change, geographic cultural shifts due to climate change, sustainable transit systems, and more.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe first edition of the Geographic Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation in Urban and Rural Environments conference will raise awareness of the impacts of climate change on rural and urban environments. Not only does the conference aim to shed light on this critical issue, it looks to seek out geographic solutions to this problem, discussing the contribution of hydrology, climatology, geomorphology, and many more fields of geography to this ever-emerging problem.\n\nHighlights on \"Geographic Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation in Urban and Rural Environments” conference!\n\nIEREK exerts efforts in continuous pursuit of your utmost satisfaction, the CEO has recently been to Lecce, Italy, for a meeting with Professor Fabio Pollice, the chair of the \"Geographic Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation in Urban and Rural Environments\" conference. Professor Fabio Pollice also serves as the Rector of Salento University. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss strategies to enhance the overall experience for conference attendees.\n\nDuring the meeting, it was decided to:\n\n- Engage prominent institutions and geographical societies to participate in the conference, aiming to maximize the benefits for all involved.\n\n-Professor Fabio Pollice took the initiative to use the Castello Carlo V for the opening session venue. This magnificent castle, constructed in the 12th century AD, provides a captivating setting for our event.\n\n-Monastero Degli Olivetani is secured as the venue for the parallel sessions. The Monastero, built between 1171 and 1174 AD, offers a serene and historically rich environment for our conference.\n\nWe are truly excited about these arrangements, as they will undoubtedly contribute to the success of the conference and create a memorable experience for all participants. To accommodate the inclusion of these institutions and secure the booking of these remarkable buildings, the university Rector has proposed extending the conference dates to June 25-27, 2024. Consequently, the deadline for abstract submission has been extended to February 29, 2024.\n\nPublication Information:\n\nVolume 1: Pre-conference publication:\n\nFor authors who have submitted their full papers, the publication process and peer review will commence this week for (Volume 1).

Currently, the Company's activity is mainly concentrated on the promotion of scientific research and dissemination activities, which are carried out through study and research 192_4programs on the territory and the environment, a lively editorial activity, the organization of conferences and studies, and through close collaboration with associations and institutions with similar interests and with other geographical, Italian and foreign societies.\n\nAGeI:Associazione Geografi Italiani\n\nThe A.Ge.I. has set itself the task of giving proactive and innovative responses to the increasingly complex qualitative and quantitative demand for information, updating, and production of geographical knowledge with strong social motivation and particular attention to the Italian space. In this framework, the A.Ge.I. maintains relations with the MIUR, the CRUI, and the CUN for the redefinition of the declarations for competition purposes; expresses opinions regarding the redefinition of the SSD (Scientific Disciplinary Sectors); provides information to public administrations regarding the training requirements necessary to access selections and competitions for archivist positions in the public sector. Through the revision of concepts and methods, thanks to a broad interdisciplinary opening and international collaborations, geographers have developed research apparatuses that are increasingly more concretely oriented toward the needs of contemporary society. Therefore, the A.Ge.I. supports with incisive action the inclusion of the geographer in the management and organization of the territory. The Association also intends to enhance the image of geography externally, indicate what contribution it can actually make, and above all encourage the exchange of experiences and information with other operational research bodies and bodies, defining a common intervention policy with them.\n\nAIIG: Associazione Italiana Insegnanti di Geografia\n\nFounded in 1954 by Elio Migliorini, it has had 6 national Presidents so far: Elio Migliorini (1955 – 1976), Aldo Sestini (from 14 October 1976 to 25 October 1977), the beloved Giorgio Valussi, unforgettable protagonist of our Association for 13 years ( 1978 – 1990), Peris Persi who boasts a series of three consecutive mandates (1990 – 2002) and Gino De Vecchis, the first university professor of Geography Education in Italy, in office continuously with great consensus for 16 years (2002 – 2018).

It has many breathtaking views and tourist attractions from museums to churches and palaces.\n\nThe following are some suggestions of places to visit while you are in Lecce, Italy:\n\nRoman Amphitheatre in Piazza Sant’Oronzo\n\nThe highlight is the large Roman amphitheatre which once seated 14,000 spectators on its two tiers, although only the lower tier remains. Sometimes concerts still take place here.\n\nIn the piazza, you can also see the column of Sant’Oronzo and an unusual 20-meter-high bronze clock, the Orologio Delle Meraviglie, created in 1955 on the wall of the Banco di Napoli.\n\nLecce Cathedral\n\nLecce’s Cathedral is on one of the most beautiful squares in Lecce, the Piazza del Duomo.\n\nPiazza del Duomo has a more intimate feel and is enclosed by ornate buildings including the bishop’s residence and seminary.\n\nThe Cathedral was originally built in 1144 and was rebuilt in the 17th century by architect Giuseppe Zimbalo in the decorative baroque style that now characterises the city.\n\nLecce’s Portas\n\nThe three remaining city gates of the previously walled city are useful landmarks for navigating the city, and all are decorative and worth seeing.\n\nOnce you pass through the gates, you leave the historic centre behind for the modern part of the city which is less attractive, but it does have some good restaurants and shops.\n\nThe main city gate is Porta Napoli built in 1548 for a state visit from Charles V and modelled on a Roman triumphal arch. Just outside the arch is the obelisk and beyond this is the university area.\n\nBasilica di Santa Croce\n\nLecce’s most extravagant baroque church is Santa Croce, also designed by Zimbalo. If you only visit one church in Lecce, make it this one.\n\nThe facade features intricate carved figures and a rosette window, and inside are ornate columns and a decorative ceiling, next to Santa Croce is another Zimbalo creation, the Palazzo dei Celestini, now the seat of the local government.\n\nAfter admiring the exterior, you can walk through the courtyard and out the archway to reach Lecce’s park, just beyond the church and palace is a lovely little street full of wine bars—perfect for a light lunch or aperitivo.\n\nBy Train\n\nYou can reach Lecce easily by direct Trenitalia train from cities such as Brindisi (30 minutes), Bari (1.5 hours), Rome (5.5 hours), and Bologna (7 hours). From Naples you’ll have to change trains at Caserta (5.5 hours total).\n\nYou can check timetables and book tickets in advance for the best rates from the Trenitalia website. You need to use Italian place names (i.e. Torino not Turin).\n\nThe Bari to Lecce Trenitalia train stops at a number of places in Puglia including Polignano a Mare, Monopoli, Cisternino, and Ostuni.\n\nBy Plane\n\nThe nearest airport to Lecce is Brindisi (30-minute drive), while Bari airport is a 2-hour drive away.\n\nYou can rent a car at Brindisi airport or take a shuttle bus from the airport to Lecce (40 minutes).\n\nBy Car\n\nFrom Bari (150Km), via a freeway. Just follow the signs to Brindisi-Lecce. Rental cars are available in the main Italian airports, including the airports of Brindisi and Bari.
