Distinguished as one of the earliest railroad centered towns in Georgia, the city retains many cultural icons of the past, which form a mosaic of a distinctive history. It is the character of this distinctive history that defines the community’s identity. Many of Villa Rica’s families have resided here for generations instilling a deep sense of community. In addition, Villa Rica’s traditional churches and historical structures strengthen the community bonds. This combination of physical assets and an active community provide an excellent foundation for invigorating economic growth in Villa Rica. The immediate purpose of the redevelopment plan is to make the area eligible for publicly assisted acquisition of vacant commercial and residential properties. Properties would be acquired, assembled and conveyed to community-based and private organizations prepared to establish new businesses and rehabilitate existing homes. In the long term, this eligibility can be useful to various community and economic development initiatives, namely those brought forth as a result of the inter-municipal planning effort and the concepts discussed in this report. The Villa Rica Urban Redevelopment Plan encompasses the City’s entire central business district, adjacent residential and industrial areas. The plan’s boundary contains the City Hall Complex, Holt-Bishop Justice Center, Police Department, professional offices and new small businesses that have committed themselves to the improvement of Downtown, a solid foundation for any revitalization initiative. Although specific sites have been referenced in detail, the intention of this redevelopment area plan is to encourage housing renewal, commercial and industrial investment, improved pedestrian and vehicular circulation, signage, appeal, and general revitalization applicable throughout the entire area. There are numerous historical buildings remaining, but times have taken a toll on several areas within the City where there is a concentration of low-income population. As a result, these communities are subject to depreciating property values, low owner occupancy rates, higher crime rates, and general blight. Many owners will not or cannot afford to repair their homes, resulting in dilapidated structures being used for rental property and elderly homeowners watching their life’s investment fall apart before their eyes. Private investment in these areas is curtailed by their condition, and when investment is made it is often incompatible with the existing character of the neighborhoods. This redevelopment plan also acknowledges both the physical decline that was the result of deindustrialization, and the significant resources and hopeful future the City can celebrate. Because the future for many of Villa Rica’s older and often historic neighborhoods as well as industrial areas are growing dim, the City Council is adopting this Urban Redevelopment Plan (URP) in accordance with the Georgia Urban Redevelopment Act (O.C.G.A. 36-61-1 et. seq.) and the adoption and implementation of Enterprise and Opportunity Zones where applicable.\n\n5. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 2 Purpose of a Redevelopment Plan The Urban Redevelopment Act (O.C.G.A. 36-61-1 et. seq) was adopted in 1955 by the Georgia General Assembly as a powerful, flexible and easy-to-use legislative tool to support successful public/private revitalization partnerships. The Urban Redevelopment Act gives cities and counties in Georgia specific powers to rehabilitate, conserve, or develop any defined geographic area that is designated a “slum area” per O.C.G.A 36-61-2 (18). As a prerequisite to exercising these powers, the City Council must adopt a resolution finding that the area constitutes a “slum area” as defined by the Act and that redevelopment of the area is “necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, morals, or welfare” of the residents of the jurisdiction. In addition to designating by resolution an “urban redevelopment area” appropriate for a redevelopment project, the Act requires adoption by the local government of an urban redevelopment plan for the target area. The Urban Redevelopment Act can be used alone, or in combination with many of Georgia’s other legislative redevelopment tools to support local comprehensive planning, revitalize faltering commercial and industrial corridors, recruit and nurture small businesses, rehabilitate older homes and neighborhoods, ensure architecturally compatible infill development, and generate new adaptive reuses for old industrial and agricultural facilities. The Urban Redevelopment Act offers solid support for innovative and thoughtfully crafted development strategies needed to solve the problems of these designated target areas. Promising Uses for the Urban Redevelopment Plan • Deteriorating or underutilized sections of downtowns • Declining commercial corridors • Deteriorating neighborhoods Advantages and Power of the Act OC.G.A. 36-61-1 et. seq. expands the normal powers of local governments in important ways, specifically adopting the required resolution and a qualifying urban redevelopment plan. • Provides a detailed blueprint of the public sector’s vision and goals for a mapped defined urban redevelopment area. • Allows the implementing entity to attach design and use requirements or limitation to specific parcels as covenants which run with the land • Provides multiple options for designating the appropriate implementing entity. A local government may implement the plan directly, or assign to a Development Authority, a Housing Authority, or a created Urban Redevelopment Agency appointed by the local government. • Simplifies the assembly (and possible replatting) of large enough tracts of land to attract private developers. • Protect the rights of private property owners to participate in and benefit financially from the redevelopment strategy. • Permits the local government or its designated redevelopment agency to issue tax exempt bonds for redevelopment purposes. These may be secured by loans, grants, leases, and other development revenues and do not count in the local government’s general indebtedness cap.\n\n6. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 3 • Helps local governments plan, prioritize, and publicize local government infrastructure investments that will help to provide support for the revitalization of designated urban redevelopment areas. • Allows a community to make exceptions to its development ordinances in order to achieve state economic and aesthetic outcomes in the redevelopment area. • Expands access to some state grant and loan programs and allows the community to expand investors. • Provides a legal framework for binding intergovernmental contracts in which communities elect to delegate redevelopment powers to separate redevelopment agencies. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan In order to ensure that the URP maintains compatibility with the City of Villa Rica 2026 Comprehensive Plan, components of the plan were used to guide the development of this Plan. The Vision Statement provides a general framework for the Comprehensive Plan; therefore, specific concepts from the Vision Statement were used to steer this URP. These concepts are: • Villa Rica is embracing the growth that has propelled it into the 21st century as much as it embraced the gold rush that created it in 1826. • Villa Rica builds upon its fortune of being located 30 miles outside of the world class city of Atlanta, yet surrounded by natural beauty and bucolic offerings. • Villa Rica seeks to become a unique blend of small town and suburbia that offers its residents and visitor’s ample recreational opportunities and refreshing green vistas, all while having ready access to necessary goods and services. • Villa Rica is working towards providing citizens of all ages an array of housing choices, a diverse economic base, and a quality of history and life that exceeds what could be provided in a typical suburb or a typical small town. “Recognition of problems in its older neighborhoods, indicating current efforts to address these problems, and planning for increased efforts to alleviate deteriorating and substandard housing conditions” • Villa Rica would like to continue to conserve, protect, and promote its historic resources and protect scenic and natural features that define the City’s character, while encouraging new development compatible with the traditional features of the City. • Villa Rica would like to promote its unique past and historic resources to promote and encourage tourism to the City. • Villa Rica would like to achieve economic growth that equitably benefits all segments of the City by identifying and implementing quality economic growth policies. • Villa Rica would like to take measures to strengthen and diversify the economic base. • Villa Rica would like to provide opportunities for quality, affordable, safe, and sanitary housing to all residents. In addition, the City would like to maintain quality housing and a range of housing sizes, costs, and densities, to make it possible for all who work in the City to also live in the City.\n\n7. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 4 • Villa Rica wishes to continue to promote traditional neighborhood development patterns, as well as mixed use developments that encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment. • Villa Rica would like to assure its residents availability to adequate, safe, and convenient housing opportunities. One way to assure quality workmanship in construction is to increase the building standards. • Villa Rica would like to use the following tools for planning City facilities: according to need, population density, land use continuity, natural resources suitability, compatibility with historic resources, user safety, neighborhood policies, and the optimum allocation of public funds. • Villa Rica would like to maintain a balanced sustainable land use pattern which accommodates projected growth while fostering City vitality, encouraging employment opportunities, and economic development, while maintaining or improving the quality of life for the City. • Villa Rica would like to mitigate land use transitions to ensure that agricultural, industrial, residential, commercial, and environmental lands can serve their intended functions and are compatible with adjacent land use. • Villa Rica would like to encourage high quality residential development and limited support businesses and institutions where adequate infrastructure and services are available. • Villa Rica would like to encourage a mix of zonings, capital investments, and other growth management techniques to increase downtown economic activity and residential development. • The transportation network should support planned development patterns to maximize the capacity of the existing and planned transportation network. • Villa Rica would like to expand and encourage alternatives to automobile transportation, such as transit, bicycle routes, and pedestrian facilities. • Villa Rica would like to preserve the traditional downtown areas and encourage the development of newer activity centers which serve as City focal points. These activity centers should be attractive, mixed use, pedestrian friendly places where people choose to gather for shopping, dining, socializing, and entertainment. “Housing Development Strategy“ • Traditional neighborhood development patterns should be encouraged, including the use of more human scale development, compact development, mixing of uses within easy walking distance of one another, and facilitating pedestrian activity. • The traditional character of the City should be maintained through preserving and revitalizing historic areas of the City, encouraging new development that is compatible with the traditional features of the City, and protecting other scenic or natural features that are important to defining the City’s character.\n\n8. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 5 • A range of housing size, cost, and density should be provided to make it possible for all who work in the City to also live in the community, thereby reducing commuting distances, to promote a mixture of income and age groups in the City, and to provide a range of housing choices to meet market needs. “Provide opportunities for quality, affordable, safe, and sanitary housing” • Eliminate substandard housing in the City of Villa Rica. • Stimulate infill housing in existing neighborhoods. • Create housing through adaptive reuse of existing buildings. • Create affordable housing opportunities to ensure that all who work in the City of Villa Rica have a viable choice or option to live in the City. • Enhance the City’s existing supply of housing by promoting conservation practices, supporting rehabilitation programs, and encouraging the replacement or restoration of dilapidated structures. • Identify and encourage new and innovative approaches to quality residential development, which expand housing opportunities and minimize public and private costs. • Change land use and development regulations (such as zoning and subdivision regulations) to allow or promote accessory apartments, “granny flats,” and carriage houses as alternative affordable housing; zero lot line or cluster housing development to achieve higher and more affordable densities of residential development; and creation of mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhoods and/or the creation of housing within walking distance to employment and commercial centers. • Take advantage of existing state and federal housing programs that address the identified housing needs and goals of the City of Villa Rica. • Preserve stable residential neighborhoods throughout the City and initiate actions to enhance the character of the historic homes located in and around the downtown area. • Ensure a licensing and certification program for buildings and developers and assure that all new construction meets minimum building code requirements, is energy and water efficient, that all materials meet quality standards, and that standards for material are equal to or better than the standards set by the manufacturer. • Strengthen local building code. • Ensure that building inspectors are thoroughly trained and supervised. “Promote traditional neighborhood development patterns, as well as mixed use developments that encourage a pedestrian friendly environment” • Change land use and development regulations (such as zoning and subdivision regulations) to allow or promote accessory apartments, \"granny flats,\" and carriage houses as alternative affordable housing; zero lot line or cluster housing. • Create mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhoods and/or the creation of housing within walking distance to employment and commercial centers.\n\n9. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 6 “Minimize the conversion of undeveloped land at the urban periphery in order to maximize the use of existing infrastructure” • Take advantage of existing state and federal housing programs that address the identified housing needs and goals of the City of Villa Rica. • Preserve stable residential neighborhoods throughout the City and initiate actions to enhance the character of the historic homes located in and around the downtown area. • Maximize the use of existing infrastructure by encouraging development or redevelopment of sites closer to the downtown or traditional urban core of the community. “Achieve a growing economy that equitably benefits all segments of Villa Rica” • Designate and develop sufficient economic development sites to accommodate long-term employment growth. • Coordinate the location and development of new housing and infrastructure with the city’s economic development planning. • Support local workforce training programs. • Encourage regional commercial development to occur within close proximity to freeway interchanges to promote regional commerce. • Strengthen the City’s ability to identify potential interjurisdicitional impacts and input from its development authorities and other affected parties. • Market the City for industry and businesses that pay above average wages. • Encourage a greater variety of businesses. • Support initiatives to provide jobs for residents with limited education. • Support entrepreneurial training and local business development. • Participate in county and regional initiatives to provide new quality businesses. • Promote businesses that complement other businesses in the region. • Encourage businesses with prospects for future expansion and for creation of higher skill job opportunities. • Encourage commercial /retail development that will be compatible to existing land uses • Promote downtown initiatives that support aesthetic improvements and the redevelopment of obsolete buildings. • Analyze all financial resources and opportunities and identify an overall economic development strategy for Villa Rica.\n\n10. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 7 Urban Redevelopment Area Boundaries of Urban Redevelopment Area Areas within the City of Villa Rica were evaluated for having the greatest potential for urban redevelopment. Staff from the Villa Rica Community Development Department conducted a survey and compiled poverty statistics and geographic information of the proposed URA to verify existing land use, identify environmental factors, and assess building occupancy and conditions in order to determine those parcels in greatest need of rehabilitation, redevelopment and to identify tracts of land classified as Brownfield or Greyfield. The survey was enhanced by comparison of tax information and property ownership as derived from the Carroll County Tax Assessors’ databases. The survey provided further support for the delineation of the URA and prompted a resolution by the Mayor and City Council declaring the need for this URP. The survey results, along with demographic, economic, social, and development data, were collected, analyzed, and integrated into the written narrative of the URP. The boundary area of the URP was selected and is included on the URA Map in Appendix A. The entire URA comprises approximately 239 acres and 361 individual parcels and roughly follows a boundary from Highway 78, Maple Street, Cheeves Street, Westview Drive, Church Street, East Gordon Street, East Montgomery Street, Thomas Dorsey Drive and Conners Road. Appendix B shows the percentage of persons below the poverty level in the City of Villa Rica. Major Concerns The boundaries of the redevelopment area are vast. The residential properties, included in the redevelopment area, surround the core business areas. A windshield survey of the property conditions was conducted of the property parcels within the redevelopment area. Evidence of the windshield survey and housing conditions survey indicated that negative conditions, as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Law, exist within the redevelopment area. The following conditions of the redevelopment area meet the statutory definition of “slum area” as defined in 36-61-2 of the Urban Redevelopment Act. • Property Maintenance: The community is concerned about the lack of home and property maintenance. Many residents feel this is the result of a high vacancy rate, irresponsible landlords, and non-conforming uses for properties. The community is also concerned that the low-income and senior populations are not able to afford the upkeep of their properties. There is also the concern that the senior population is physically unable to maintain their properties without assistance. Due to the lack of property maintenance in the area there is the overall concern that home sales and property values in this area will remain lower than any other area of the City.\n\n11. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 8 • Vacancy Rate: There are many vacant lots and units on the north side. Many of the vacant units are not maintained by the property owners and are consistently reported by neighbors complaining of overgrown grass and broken out windows. Some of the vacant units are older housing units needing to be demolished. The southern portion of the URA is in dire need of redevelopment. Many of the structures are vacant historic properties not properly maintained. The community is concerned that the presence of vacant lots and homes will give the perception of crime and unsafe conditions. The community believes that home sales and property values within this area will remain lower than other areas in the City. • Since 2009 the downtown has seen a decline in its vacancy rate from the upper 90% range to 83%. The City has a strong desire to support local restaurants and shops by promoting an environment conducive to “foot traffic” and maintaining a healthy employee base. It will be critical in the up coming months and years to develop a strategy to recruit businesses and development in these empty spaces. • Brownfields: The term “Brownfield” describes land that has the potential to be contaminated by hazardous substance or pollutants due to its previous industrial or commercial use. The expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of Brownfields may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of such contaminants. There appears to be no such sites in the redevelopment area. • Design: The area of South Carroll Road is located within the Historic District of the city of Villa Rica. Many of the residential units along this street have been converted to offices. The renovations of these properties have not kept with the architectural style of the original building. Much of the character of the properties has been lost. The overwhelming majority of the structures located on the north side are residential units. These homes were not built as a planned development, but can be seen as a mix of various housing styles • Crime: This is a major concern for residents. City Officials and the Police Department have worked with residents to create a Neighborhood Watch Programs, safety classes for business owners and employees and many other initiatives to combat the safety concerns of the residents. • Economic or Social Liability: The deteriorated, dilapidated, and/or vacant properties located within the redevelopment area present various safety concerns, are substantially underutilized, and contribute to the overall degradation of the community. These conditions do not promote a healthy, vibrate, and economically flourishing community. This does very little to contribute to the economic vitality of Villa Rica as a whole. • Detrimental to Public Health, Safety, Morals and/or Welfare: The conditions of the blighted structures in the area are detrimental to the public health, safety, moral and overall welfare of the community. The vacant and abandoned properties have lead to crime, vagrancy, and rodent and vermin infestation.\n\n12. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 9 Explanation of Negative Conditions The following negative conditions are characteristic of several or all neighborhoods found within the boundaries of the URA. These conditions cause the area to meet the statutory definition of “slum” as defined in the Section 36-61-2 of the Act, and will be described in detail below. • Broken and uneven sidewalks • Building interiors and exteriors in need of repair • Unkempt yards • Abundance of trash or junk items stored on properties • Low rates of home ownership • Higher occurrences of vacant structures, which are often left unsecured • Instances of faulty or nonconforming lot layout • An existence of criminal activity • Higher rates of condemnation • Yards experiencing soil erosion issues • Neighborhood commercial centers with limited parking and low grade signage • Disinterest of private residential and commercial investment • General property distress • Contiguous poverty block groups (See Appendix B)\n\n13. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 10 Constitutes an Economic or Social Liability In general, the deteriorated, dilapidated, and/or vacant or abandoned properties located within the URA represent an economic and social liability to the City, as these parcels are a public safety concern, substantially underutilized, and contribute to poor City morale. These blighted properties do not promote business growth and retention or provide decent housing. Additionally, the blighted properties contribute little to the tax revenue of Villa Rica due to their poor condition and underused state. Slum and Blight A property survey indicated that the URA contains numerous deteriorated structures and several dilapidated structures that quality as slum and blight under the Act. Specifically, three dilapidated structures were identified in the survey, all being residential. Dilapidated structures are those that are obsolete and/or visibly decayed due to age, wear, and neglect. Dilapidated buildings usually require major repair, or are structurally unsound to the point of being a threat to public safety, therefore resulting in demolition. The URA also includes numerous deteriorated structures, of which all were residential in use. Deteriorated structures may also be considered obsolete if the structure is over 40 years old. These structures are those that require minor repairs and/or standard maintenance in order to restore them to sound condition. While conducting the survey, several properties were identified as being either unoccupied or abandoned. In addition, several of these structures were in a dilapidated or deteriorated state. Vacant structures can present a threat to public health and safety if not properly maintained. Dilapidated and deteriorated structures are interspersed throughout the URA. Specifically, they are located on Thomas Dorsey Drive, Candler Street and East Gordon Street. In particular, all neighborhoods in the URA contain high percentages of deteriorated structures. Detrimental to the Public The blighted properties within the URA are detrimental overall to public health, morale, and welfare, as they do not contribute to the well-being of the City; instead, the distressed state of these structures detracts from it. The unoccupied status of several houses and large commercial buildings is also detrimental to the public’s safety. The prevalence of vacant structures has led to problems with vermin harborage, garbage dumping, and occasionally arson. Deteriorated or Inadequate Infrastructure A few infrastructure deficiencies were noted during the survey of the City. In general, the URA is lacking in pedestrian and bicycle access. Sidewalks and possible bicycle lanes are needed where residential and commercial areas are closely joined. In addition, some of Villa Rica’s downtown streets such as East Temple Street, East Gordon Street, North Candler Street and Cheeves Street are in need of repair and/or repaving due to wear and tear. Furthermore, the addition of curbs and gutters along local and collector roads in residential areas could enhance these roads, as well as offer stormwater relief. Infrastructure improvements are currently being planned by the City.\n\n14. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 11 Redevelopment Authority and Function Designation of Redevelopment Entity It is the desire of the City Council to utilize the current development authorities to oversee implementation of the Urban Redevelopment Plan (URP). The Council feels this role would be best fulfilled by Villa Rica Downtown Development Authority, the Villa Rica Housing Authority and the Villa Rica Development Authority to be known as the Villa Rica Urban Redevelopment Commission. The Villa Rica Housing Authority is committed to be a leader in providing affordable housing for very-low, low and moderate-income persons through effective management and wise stewardship of public funds, partnerships with our residents and others to enhance the quality of life in our communities. The Villa Rica Development Authority offers financing and other services that promote the establishment and growth of businesses and institutions - from small enterprises to major corporations and institutions. They would also go the extra mile to help clients understand financing, the intricacies of government permitting and the advantages of doing business in the City. The Downtown Development Authority is a public entity with a specified set of powers and a specific purpose and mission to revitalize and redevelop the downtown business district of Villa Rica, develop and promote for the public good and general welfare, trade, commerce, industry, and employment opportunities and promote the general welfare of the city and state by creating a climate favorable to the location of new industry, trade and commerce within the downtown area and finance projects within the downtown business district that will develop and promote the public good and general welfare. Urban Redevelopment Commission: • Villa Rica Development Authority • Villa Rica Downtown Development Authority • Villa Rica Housing Authority The Agencies will annually present a report to the City Council prior to March 31. These reports will be prepared in accordance with the O.C.G.A. 36-61-18\n\n15. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 12 Land Acquisition, Construction, Demolition and Rehabilitation Through reasons of condemnation and failure to pay taxes, the City sometimes comes into possession of properties within its limits; some of these also fall within the borders of the URA. The City envisions using the URP as a mechanism by which to relieve it of these properties while bringing them into a safe condition and/or place them back on the tax roster. In order to accomplish this, the City would grant the appropriate properties to the redevelopment agency. The agency would then bid these properties to private builders or contractors, who would acquire greatly reduced or free property in exchange for construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing that is architecturally compatible with the neighborhood in question. Once the property is sold, the builder/contractor would receive the cost to rehabilitate or construct the home plus some portion to be determined. All parties involved would conceivably benefit from this arrangement: the City accomplishes its goal of having properties returned to the tax roster, the agency is facilitated in accomplishing the purposes of the URP, and private builders/contractors benefit financially. In order to accomplish the goals of the URP, property may need to be acquired by other means than those described above. While there are currently no plans for acquiring specific parcels of land, future acquisition is not outside the realm of possibility. Consequently, the City Council is bestowing the agency with all powers legally viable under the Urban Redevelopment Act that will enable the agency to acquire, receive, or otherwise obtain property. These powers include eminent domain; however, any use of eminent domain must be approved by the City Council prior to execution. Should circumstances change making property acquisition probable or necessary, this plan will be amended to reflect such changes. During the creation of the URP, no structures in the URA were identified to be demolished, relocated, or rehabilitated. Should the demolition, relocation, or rehabilitation of buildings be required in future phases of the URP, these activities may be carried out by the agency, have been approved for use by the City Council, and the Plan will be amended to reflect those changes. At present, the City of Villa Rica actively enforces the International Property Maintenance Code. For substandard structures within the Historic District, a historic building assessment is conducted before a building is demolished. When feasible, buildings considered contributing to historic resources are rehabilitated according to the Historic District’s guidelines. Displacement and Relocation of Residents The City of Villa Rica has determined that the development of a relocation strategy is not necessary at this time. Redevelopment efforts are currently focused on unimproved lots, city-owned property, and vacant and blighted structures. Rehabilitation on occupied buildings is also a possibility. However, the manner of rehabilitation is not presently anticipated to displace occupants. Therefore, no relocation of residents is expected to occur. In the event displacement of residents becomes necessary, the URP will be amended to incorporate a plan for relocation in accordance with all local and state statutory requirements.\n\n16. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 13 Through its existing substandard building remediation and condemnation program, the City of Villa Rica currently relocates residents living in unfit conditions through assistance from local agencies such as the Villa Rica Housing Authority.\n\n17. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 14 Local Objectives and Suggestions Relationship to Local Objectives No current land use objectives are known to be inconsistent with the purposes of the URP. The redevelopment area contains a mixture of land uses within the Downtown District and the Downtown Overlay District; however, the existing land use is primarily residential. The overlay sub-areas in the URA are CBD, CMU, COM, MFR and SFR. Each sub- area found within the redevelopment area is listed below and is accompanied by a description of the district taken from the City’s Zoning Ordinance. These categories were: DT – Downtown District The district is intended to promote residential and commercial infill development in the same building or same development in the town center. District standards are intended to encourage flexible and creative design and development of commercial and residential uses in the existing downtown historic area and in new, walkable, mixed- use development in other parts of the City of Villa Rica. The specific purposes of this district include: a. To encourage residential uses in conjunction with commercial activities to foster an active downtown and enhance the vitality of businesses; b. To promote the adaptive reuse of older structures for the purpose of stabilizing and improving property values; c. To encourage sense of community and to foster civic pride in the beauty and accomplishments of the past; d. To retain and enhance the character and vitality of the city’s downtown and attract residents, tourists and visitors; and e. To strengthen and help diversify the economy of the city. Downtown Overlay District The DO District is intended to regulate development in the City’s downtown core and to encourage compatible development therein and Downtown Overlay District sub-areas are summarized below: CBD (Central Business District) Permits a mix of retail, office, and residential uses in mixed-use buildings. CMU (Commercial Mixed-Use) Permits a mix of retail, office, and residential uses in mixed-use buildings at a scale and intensity greater than that permitted in the CBD. COM (Commercial) Permits a mix of uses that are a scale and character compatible with regional serving and highway-oriented developments. MFR (Multi-Family Residential) Permits medium-density residential for multi-family and two-family residential uses. Maximum of eight (8) dwelling units or single-family lots per acre.\n\n18. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 15 Using appropriate public and private resources, the objectives of this URP related to the local objectives as follows: • The plan revitalizes blighted, deteriorating areas within the City of Villa Rica. • The plan allows the City of Villa Rica to reduce or abate local property taxes and regulatory fees (through use of an Enterprise Zone). • The plan expands the City of Villa Rica’s access to job credits (through the use of an Opportunity Zone. • The plan encourages compatible infill development and defines architectural character. • The plan facilitates affordable housing. • The plan allows for sidewalks, safer streets, and improved pedestrian accessibility. • The plan allows for the creative financing of public facilities and infrastructure. • The plan adaptively reuses vacant and/or historic structures and obsolete facilities. • The plan revitalizes declining commercial strip centers, abandoned industrial sites, or Greyfields. • The plan supports the effective enforcement of Villa Rica’s existing nuisance ordinances in order to facilitate conditions favorable for redevelopment. The City’s future development goals were examined to ensure that this URP complies with other existing regulations. Public input on the URP was solicited and comments and recommendations were incorporated as appropriate. Historic Preservation Considerations Incorporated in 1830, the City of Villa Rica contains a wealth of late nineteenth, early twentieth, and mid- twentieth century architectural resources. The City values its historic resources, and protects them through implementation of its historic preservation ordinance by the City of Villa Rica Historic Preservation Commission. Reflecting the City’s diverse architectural heritage are the seven historic districts in Villa Rica which are designated as: • North Villa Rica Commercial Historic District • North Villa Rica Residential Historic District • South Villa Rica Commercial Historic District • South Villa Rica Residential Historic District • West Villa Rica Commercial Historic District • West Villa Rica Residential Historic District • Fullerville Historic District The North Villa Rica Commercial Historic District was designated in 2002 by the National Register of Historic Places, and contains approximately 16 contributing structures. Contributing structures are those that are 50 years of age or older, possess historic and/or architectural integrity, and are characteristic of the City’s heritage and developmental history.\n\n19. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 16 During the URA survey, many deteriorated structures were identified in all the historic districts. It is recommended that any contributing structure within those district that has been identified as deteriorated be rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation is feasible. Rehabilitation of contributing historic properties should be undertaken through both voluntary actions and the existing regulatory processes. Both public and private rehabilitation efforts should follow the design guidelines for each historic district and the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. Furthermore, historic buildings should not be altered in a manner inconsistent with the technical standards for rehabilitation, nor should historic buildings be demolished unless their reuse is found to be unfeasible. Where vacant lots exist where the URA and a Historic District overlap, infill structures should be compatible with historic buildings by following the standards set forth in the design guidelines. Finally, all exterior material changes to buildings within the historic districts should follow the standard design review process established by the Historic Preservation Ordinance, Design Guidelines and be issued an approved Certificate of Appropriateness application before work proceeds. It is important to note that rehabilitating historic structures may have tax advantages for the private property owner. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Historic Preservation Division, currently offers both an income tax credit program and a local property tax abatement program for qualified rehabilitation expenses for historic buildings. Additionally, a federal income tax credit program for qualified rehabilitation expense is offered through the National Park Service and Internal Revenue Service. Information about these programs and applications can be found on the Historic Preservation Division’s website at http://www.gashpo.org. Planning, Zoning and Building Regulations Zoning is an integral part of redevelopment. The City of Villa Rica will maximize the benefits of redevelopment under this URP. A current zoning map of Villa Rica can be found in Appendix C. A benefit of using an URP for redevelopment is the ability to alter some existing zoning and development requirements, in accordance with Section 36-61-8 of the Urban Redevelopment Act, for the purpose of achieving the optimum economic and aesthetic results in the redevelopment area. It is likely that some change or mitigation in existing zoning and development regulations will be essential and/or beneficial. The City Council is the agency with the authority and option to pursue all legal changes to existing zoning and development regulations as they are reasonable and necessary. No covenants or restrictions will be placed on properties by the City of Villa Rica at this time. Should property covenants and/or restrictions be adopted in the future, this plan will be amended to include such covenants and restrictions.\n\n20. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 17 Opportunities and Strategies Opportunities for Improvement Several projects are currently underway or anticipated in the near future that will dovetail with redevelopment efforts to benefit the URA. Each of these projects is described in more detail below: • City of Villa Rica Main Street Program • City of Villa Rica Historic Preservation Program • Intergovernmental Coordination • Public Infrastructure Improvements • Transportation • Utility • Recreation • Aesthetic • Sidewalks • Lighting • Streetscapes • Parking • Atlanta Regional Commission • Three Rivers Regional Commission While significant strides have occurred in addressing Villa Rica’s affordable housing needs, continued neighborhood revitalization efforts cannot become a reality without anticipated HUD funds. The City has limited resources available to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing to very low income residents, many of whom are elderly and live on fixed incomes. To help increase property values in neighborhoods within the city, the City of Villa Rica supports the construction of new owner-occupied infill housing. Additionally, the City will continue to support the rehabilitation of older urban homes by non-profit and for-profit developers who agree to sell the houses at affordable prices to low income households. The City should push for sensible relaxation of underwriting criteria used by banks and other financial institutions that participate in the housing partnership. Other barriers will be identified, analyzed, and where appropriate, changed. The City will work with local financial institutions to encourage activities that contribute to federally mandated Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) activities. Strategy for Implementing Implementation of the URP is expected to occur over several phases, as deemed necessary by the Mayor and City Council. The phases are described below: • Phase I: Formal adoption by resolution of the URP and Enterprise Zone; and organization and adoption of the Urban Redevelopment Commission and coordination of the URP’s administration. In addition to adopting the URP and Enterprise Zones, the Mayor and City Council will create an Urban Redevelopment Commission, an advisory board charged with the responsibility of overseeing the URP’s implementation. The Mayor and City Council will create and adopt by resolution a Villa Rica Urban Redevelopment Commission (See Appendix H). Members comprised of the Housing Authority, Downtown Development Authority and the Development Authority. Responsibilities of urban redevelopment agencies can be found in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, Sections 36-61-17 through 36-61-19, which is included as part of the Urban Redevelopment Act in Appendix D.\n\n21. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 18 Next, the City of Villa Rica will apply for Opportunity Zone designation through the Department of Community Affairs (DCA). This process is anticipated to take approximately 30 days. Once DCA approves the Opportunity Zone designation, the City will be able to offer qualifying businesses in these zones the maximum job tax credit allowed by law. The Villa Rica Urban Redevelopment Commission will also create an information package for prospective new businesses. Ideally, this would be available in multimedia format, such as a print brochure, compact disc, and/or website, and will detail the incentives available for businesses that locate or expand in the Enterprise Zone and Opportunity Zone areas. Additionally, other redevelopment projects that the City is coordinating should be highlighted in the information package. Press releases, public service announcements, and other forms of mass media communications should be pursued by the Commission in order to communicate the benefits of the Enterprise and Opportunity Zones to prospective businesses. • Phase II: After completion of Phase I activities, the Villa Rica Urban Redevelopment Commission should focus on preparing a detailed and prioritized list of properties to be redeveloped. These “targeted redevelopment properties” may encompass empty lots, or parcels containing vacant or dilapidated structures and are those identified as adversely affecting the tax base and being uninhabitable, unsafe, and unworthy of rehabilitation. At a minimum, this list should contain the following information about each property: Property Address, Property Map and Parcel Number, Property Owner Name, Property Owner Address (if different from property address), Current Assessed Value, Condition, and Zoning District. The survey conducted for the URP should aid in preparing such a list. The purpose of the targeted redevelopment properties list is to facilitate the orderly redevelopment of those properties having a negative impact on the surrounding area. It is important that redevelopment plans for vacant lots and properties with dilapidated, unoccupied buildings are addressed before any occupied structures. Future phases for the purpose of redevelopment as stated within this plan may be undertaken as the Mayor, City Council, and Urban Redevelopment Commission deem feasible. Additionally, this URP may be amended or modified at any time by the Urban Redevelopment Commission through use of the Amendment Worksheet provided in Appendix I, and adopted by a formal resolution of the Mayor and City Council. Furthermore, this plan is able to be expanded into areas outside the city limits of Villa Rica via an intergovernmental agreement with Carroll or Douglas Counties, if such a need arises.\n\n22. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 19 Opportunity for Private Enterprise Many opportunities exist to encourage private investment within the URA. The City Council is encouraging and allowing the Agency to utilize whatever tools and powers are legally possible and will be most beneficial for this cause. Therefore, the Agency will have the ability to implement or cause implementation of Opportunity Zones, which, along with this URP, includes State Enterprise Zones and Job Tax Credits. Additionally, a Bond Allocation Program may also be utilized. These programs may provide for state job tax credits, reduction or exemption of ad valorem taxes, and/or waiver or reduction of local regulatory fees, such as occupation taxes and license fees. Tax incentives are also available for historic preservation, which many of the properties within the URA are located. Building inspection and/or permitting fees may also be an option. The City Council has expressed a desire to see the agency dispose of residential property that it may acquire by bidding said property to private contractors. Any private contractor who acquires such property will be held to certain conditions to ensure affordable, architecturally compatible housing. To the largest extent possible, the City Council wants development to occur by private investment. In order to maximize development, a Land Bank Authority could be created which would allow the bidding of larger groupings of land and/or structures to be rehabilitated, which may be more attractive to private contractors. Enterprise Zones: Ad valorem property tax abatement is possible for both commercial and residential properties (minus taxes imposed by school districts and for general obligation debt). Local government may abate or exempt local taxes and fees (minus sales and use taxes) and may waive ordinances. Job Tax Credits: These credits provide a tax credit on Georgia income taxes for eligible businesses that create new jobs in less developed areas. Benefits are increased with inclusion within and Opportunity Zone. Opportunity Zones: These are a combination of 3 programs: Enterprise Zones, Urban Redevelopment Areas/Plans, & Job Tax Credits. Alone, each of these programs provides strong incentive for local economic development that is good for business and good for the neighborhood. Historic Preservation Tax Incentives: • Federal Income Tax Credit Program • Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit Program (RITC) • Georgia Preferential Property Tax Assessment Program for Rehabilitated Historic Property • Georgia State Income Tax Credit Program for Rehabilitated Historic Property\n\n23. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 20 Any tool that the Agency wishes to use to promote private enterprise will require City Council approval. Bond Allocation Program: For businesses and individuals seeking long term, low-interest rate financing for the construction or improvements of single and multi-family housing projects, tax exempt financing is available both at the state and local level. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs is responsible for implementing a system that allocates the use of private-activity bonds, in order to further the provision of safe, sanitary, and affordable housing. This program is applicable to some commercial endeavors as well. Tax Allocation Districts (TAD): TADS help local governments in constructing certain public facilities and infrastructure improvements in association with business development projects in deteriorating areas of a community. It allows the costs of these improvements to be charged directly to the businesses that use them, rather than to the public at large. In return, the businesses benefit from the construction of facilities that otherwise might not otherwise be available to them.\n\n31. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 28 Appendix H: Urban Redevelopment Act The Urban Redevelopment Act (the “Act”) renders to cities and counties in Georgia specific powers to rehabilitate, conserve, or redevelop any defined geographical area that is designated as a “slum area.” As a prerequisite to exercising these powers, the municipality must adopt a resolution finding that the area constitutes a “slum area” as defined by the Act and that redevelopment of the area is “necessary in the interest of public health, safety, morals, or welfare” of the residents of the jurisdiction. In addition to designating by resolution an Urban Redevelopment Area appropriate for redevelopment projects, the Act requires adoption by the local government of an urban redevelopment plan for the target area. The Act is applicable to, and especially useful in, very small rural communities and even suburban settings. In fact, rural counties were among the first governments to use the Act for the purpose of the rehabilitation of deteriorating neighborhoods or increasing their supply of affordable housing. This Act should not be confused with the similarly titled Urban Redevelopment Powers Act (O.C.G.A. 36-44-1), which authorizes tax allocation districts. Although both acts have community development as the primary goal, the Urban Redevelopment Powers Act is more procedurally complex, more difficult to implement, and has a much narrower focus and applicability. The Urban Redevelopment Act is relevant for a variety of reasons. First, some sectors of the population (especially aging baby boomers, younger singles, and couples without children) are becoming increasingly interested in moving from the suburbs, which require long commutes to work, back into neglected sections of large cities or relocating to small, charming towns. Real estate prices in urban areas are appreciating and housing demand is strong near reinvigorated town centers and village commercial nodes. Second, the supply of affordable housing is aging and shrinking while the population needing this type of housing is growing. Many governments are seeking to provide moderate income residents with viable options other than manufactured housing. Third, at the state policy level, legislators and state agencies are encouraging cities and counties to be more strategic and creative in combining the state’s wide array of legislative, programmatic, and funding tools for community revitalization. Accordingly, adopting an urban redevelopment plan has now been added as a threshold criterion for accessing for important redevelopment incentives. Communities have been encouraged to focus multiple resources and tools in economically disadvantaged target areas or in the areas that are held back by impediments that discourage private sector investments. Changes to Georgia’s Brownfield regulations and new streamlined programs created by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) now reduce liability for innocent investors (private or governmental) seeking to redevelop Brownfield sites and offset site cleanup costs through tax incentives. These proactive changes should help Georgia attract private investors to sites that were previously not economically viable, many of which are in or near downtown and older neighborhoods. The Act is a promising tool for Brownfield redevelopment because it simplifies land acquisition and allows the public sector to help finance infrastructure or related improvements.\n\n32. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 29 Several programs created or administered by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) have been modified based on refinements to state planning statutes. Progressive communities that adopt URPs (especially in combination with other innovative redevelopment tools) may now be eligible for incentives such as higher job tax credits. These program initiatives were designed to enable both urban and rural communities to create more effective strategies to address pockets of poverty. Compared to Georgia’s other planning and community development statutes, the Act is straightforward and flexible. It also does a good job of balancing the community’s need to remove the barriers to its overall economic development created by slum and blight with the protection of the rights of property owners and low income residents in particular. This URP is a first step towards revitalizing specific areas within the City of Villa Rica. The URP will serve as valuable tool that, in conjunction with City of Villa Rica 2026 Comprehensive Plan, the Villa Rica Downtown Master Plan, and other State legislative redevelopment tools, can be used to revitalize faltering commercial corridors, recruit and nurture small businesses, rehabilitate older homes and neighborhoods, ensure architecturally compatible infill development, and generate new adaptive uses for old commercial, industrial, or agricultural facilities. Healthy neighborhoods consist of good quality housing and viable community businesses. The URP is required to address many components of Villa Rica’s plan for renewal. These elements include, but are not limited to: 1. Designation of a redevelopment entity. 2. Indication of consistency with the City of Villa Rica’s Comprehensive Plan. 3. Definition of boundaries of the area to be redeveloped (need not be contiguous) which qualify as “blighted” as defined by the Urban Redevelopment Act. These areas are designated as the Urban Redevelopment Area (URA). 4. Explanation of the negative conditions in the redevelopment area that cause it to meet the definition of “slum” and make redevelopment necessary. 5. Indication of any land acquisition, demolition, redevelopment, improvement, and rehabilitation proposed to be undertaken in the area. 6. Indication of any changes to planning, zoning, and building requirements. 7. Description of a feasible method for the relocation of families who will be displaced from the area into decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings within their means and without undue hardship. 8. Indication of the URP’s relationship to definite local objectives. 9. Indication of the maximum opportunity for rehabilitation and redevelopment of the area to be undertaken by private enterprise. The URP is written broadly concerning many of these components. This is intentional in order to allow the redevelopment entity (as defined in the following section) the capacity to retool the plan as necessary once a more specific plan of action is known, which would be done in accordance with all applicable laws concerning amendments to URPs and allow appropriate public notification of any changes to the plan.\n\n33. Urban Redevelopment Plan 2 0 1 2 30 Appendix I: Resolution of Necessity WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia find that there exists within the corporate limits of said city one or more urbanized or developed areas in which the structures, buildings and improvements, by reasons of dilapidation, deterioration, age or obsolescence, inadequate provision for ventilation, light, air, sanitation or open spaces, and the existence of conditions of disease, infant mortality, high unemployment, juvenile delinquency and crime and detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and welfare; and WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia find that there exists within the corporate limits of said city one or more urbanized developed areas which by reason of the presence of a predominant number of substandard, slum, deteriorated, or deteriorating structures, inadequate parking, faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility, and usefulness, unsanitary and unsafe conditions, deterioration of site and other improvements, tax delinquency exceeding the fair value of the land, diversity of ownership on defective or unusual conditions to title which prevent or encumber the free alienability of land, and the existence of conditions which endanger life and property by fie and other causes, substantially impair and arrest the sound growth of the community, retard the provision of housing accommodations and employment opportunities, and constitute an economic and social liability and is a menace to the public health, safety, morals and welfare in their present condition and use; and WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia find that there exists within the corporate limits of said city one or more open areas located within urbanized or developed areas which because of the presence of factors enumerate in the first two paragraphs hereof, substantially impair and arrest the sound of growth of the community; and WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia find that there exists within the corporate limits of said city one of more urbanized or developed areas which are substantially underutilized by containing open lots and parcels of land or by containing a substantial number of building or structures which are 40 years old or older or by containing structures or buildings of relatively low value as compared to the value of structures or buildings of low and moderate income which the Mayor and Council designate as appropriate for community development; and NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, by the Mayor and Council of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia in a meeting duly assembled, pursuant to the authority granted by Official Code of Georgia annotated Section 36-61-5, that the following described areas are hereby found and declared to the urban redevelopment areas as defined by the Office Code of Georgia annotated Section 36-61-5: That certain area lying within the corporate limits of the City of Villa Rica and being enclosed by the boundary indentified in Exhibit “A” City of Villa Rica, Georgia Urban Redevelopment Area.
