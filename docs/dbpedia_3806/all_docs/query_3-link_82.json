As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 20,306.[1] The county seat is Delphi.[2]\n\nCarroll County is part of the Lafayette, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn 1787, the fledgling United States defined the Northwest Territory, which included the area of present-day Indiana. In 1800, Congress separated Ohio from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the Indiana Territory.[3] President Thomas Jefferson chose William Henry Harrison as the territory's first governor, and Vincennes was established as the territorial capital.[4] After the Michigan Territory was separated and the Illinois Territory was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography.[3] By December 1816 the Indiana Territory was admitted to the Union as a state.\n\nStarting in 1794, Native American titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty. The United States acquired land from the Native Americans in the treaty of St. Mary's in 1818, which included most of the future county, and in 1826 the Treaty of Mississinewas made more area available for settlement. These two treaties resolved the occupation issue for the future Carroll County.\n\nWhites had been living in the future Carroll County area since 1824[5] and their numbers increased rapidly in the next few years. Accordingly, Carroll County was authorized by the state legislature on 17 January 1828; it was named for Charles Carroll, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, who died in 1832.[5][6] The first commissioners began organizing the county government on 28 April of that year, and determined to site the county seat at land donated by William Wilson. The name 'Carrollton' was first suggested for the new community, but at the suggestion of General Samuel Milroy, 'Delphi' was selected instead.[5]\n\nThe Wabash and Erie Canal, built through the county in 1840 and operating until the early 1870s, is among the county's most significant historical legacies.\n\nCourthouse[]\n\nThe first county courthouse was built in 1831. It was replaced by a brick structure in 1856. The 730-pound bell from the first courthouse was made in Cincinnati in 1836 and given by Sheriff Samuel Davis Gresham, and was used in the second courthouse until 1916. While the bell was in transit to Lafayette by boat, the boat sank. The bell was recovered from the Ohio River, and was sold, but was returned to Carroll County in 1967.[7]\n\nThe current Carroll County courthouse was designed by Jaxson Cowell of Indianapolis, who also designed the Spencer County courthouse. It was constructed by A. E. Kemmer at a cost of about $250,000 from 1916 to 1917. The exterior is understated, but the interior is surprisingly elaborate, including a stained glass dome over a mosaic tile floor.\n\nGeography[]\n\nThe Wabash River flows southwestward from Cass County through the upper part of Carroll County, exiting into Tippecanoe County. The Tippecanoe River flows southward through the county's upper west edge, also exiting into Tippecanoe County, where it merges with the Wabash shortly after leaving Carroll County's border. Wildcat Creek drains the south part of Carroll County, flowing westward into Tippecanoe to merge with the Wabash there.\n\nThe terrain of Carroll County was heavily wooded at the start, but now the flat areas are cleared and devoted to agriculture or urban development, with only the drainage areas still wooded.[8] The highest point on the terrain (830 feet/253 meters ASL) is the county's SE corner.[9]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 375.02 square miles (971.3 km2), of which 372.22 square miles (964.0 km2) (or 99.25%) is land and 2.80 square miles (7.3 km2) (or 0.75%) is water.[10]\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nCity[]\n\nDelphi (county seat)\n\nTowns[]\n\nBurlington\n\nCamden\n\nFlora\n\nYeoman\n\nUnincorporated communities[]\n\nTownships[]\n\nMajor highways[]\n\nRailroads[]\n\nNorfolk Southern Railway\n\nWinamac Southern Railway\n\nClimate and weather[]\n\nClimate chart for Delphi, Indiana JFMAMJJASOND\n\n1.99\n\n33\n\n17\n\n1.94\n\n39\n\n21\n\n2.94\n\n51\n\n31\n\n3.45\n\n64\n\n40\n\n3.90\n\n74\n\n50\n\n4.07\n\n83\n\n60\n\n4.16\n\n86\n\n63\n\n3.98\n\n84\n\n61\n\n2.94\n\n78\n\n53\n\n2.70\n\n66\n\n42\n\n3.10\n\n51\n\n33\n\n2.68\n\n38\n\n23\n\ntemperatures in °C • precipitation totals in mm\n\nsource: The Weather Channel[11]\n\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Delphi have ranged from a low of 17 °F (−8 °C) in January to a high of 86 °F (30 °C) in July, although a record low of −25 °F (−31.7 °C) was recorded in January 1963 and a record high of 107 °F (42 °C) was recorded in July 1954. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 1.94 inches (49 mm) in February to 4.16 inches (106 mm) in July.[11]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nSee also: Government of Indiana\n\nThe county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code.\n\nCounty Council: The legislative branch of the county government; controls spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected to four-year terms from county districts. They set salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.[12][13]\n\nBoard of Commissioners: The executive body of the county; commissioners are elected county-wide to staggered four-year terms. One commissioner serves as president. The commissioners execute acts legislated by the council, collect revenue, and manage the county government.[12][13]\n\nCourt: The county maintains a small claims court that handles civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.[13]\n\nCounty Officials: The county has other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. These officers are elected to four-year terms. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare a party affiliation and to be residents of the county.[13]\n\nCarroll County is part of Indiana's 4th congressional district and is represented by Jim Baird in the United States Congress. It is also part of Indiana Senate district 7[14] and Indiana House of Representatives district 24.[15]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Carroll County, Indiana[16] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 7,086 74.48% 2,224 23.38% 204 2.14% 2016 6,273 72.10% 1,892 21.74% 536 6.16% 2012 4,999 64.01% 2,635 33.74% 176 2.25% 2008 4,858 55.61% 3,736 42.77% 142 1.63% 2004 5,868 67.93% 2,689 31.13% 81 0.94% 2000 5,102 61.71% 2,965 35.86% 201 2.43% 1996 4,062 50.58% 2,747 34.20% 1,222 15.22% 1992 3,800 44.38% 2,561 29.91% 2,201 25.71% 1988 4,981 62.54% 2,952 37.07% 31 0.39% 1984 5,528 66.09% 2,774 33.17% 62 0.74% 1980 5,262 60.49% 2,966 34.10% 471 5.41% 1976 4,797 56.48% 3,606 42.46% 90 1.06% 1972 5,885 72.32% 2,214 27.21% 38 0.47% 1968 4,796 56.19% 2,816 32.99% 923 10.81% 1964 3,896 44.71% 4,789 54.96% 29 0.33% 1960 5,411 61.88% 3,299 37.73% 34 0.39% 1956 5,748 63.26% 3,312 36.45% 26 0.29% 1952 5,902 64.31% 3,208 34.95% 68 0.74% 1948 4,597 53.99% 3,845 45.16% 72 0.85% 1944 4,872 57.28% 3,578 42.07% 55 0.65% 1940 5,012 54.05% 4,214 45.44% 47 0.51% 1936 4,426 48.28% 4,676 51.01% 65 0.71% 1932 3,853 43.79% 4,866 55.30% 80 0.91% 1928 4,780 59.54% 3,182 39.64% 66 0.82% 1924 4,543 53.52% 3,660 43.11% 286 3.37% 1920 5,006 53.92% 4,186 45.09% 92 0.99% 1916 2,468 49.09% 2,401 47.75% 159 3.16% 1912 1,467 30.03% 2,275 46.57% 1,143 23.40% 1908 2,546 47.46% 2,590 48.28% 229 4.27% 1904 2,671 49.96% 2,420 45.27% 255 4.77% 1900 2,585 47.59% 2,690 49.52% 157 2.89% 1896 2,546 47.43% 2,764 51.49% 58 1.08% 1892 2,230 44.43% 2,361 47.04% 428 8.53% 1888 2,607 48.96% 2,560 48.08% 158 2.97%\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1830 1,611 — 1840 7,819 385.4% 1850 11,015 40.9% 1860 13,489 22.5% 1870 16,152 19.7% 1880 18,345 13.6% 1890 20,021 9.1% 1900 19,953 −0.3% 1910 17,970 −9.9% 1920 16,315 −9.2% 1930 15,049 −7.8% 1940 15,410 2.4% 1950 16,010 3.9% 1960 16,934 5.8% 1970 17,734 4.7% 1980 19,722 11.2% 1990 18,809 −4.6% 2000 20,165 7.2% 2010 20,155 0% US Decennial Census[17]\n\n1790-1960[18] 1900-1990[19]\n\n1990-2000[20] 2010-2020[1]\n\n2010 census[]\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 20,155 people, 7,900 households, and 5,678 families in the county.[21] The population density was 54.1 inhabitants per square mile (20.9 /km2).
