        "text": "üáÆüá© Indonesia, with its extensive coastline, embracing a warm tropical climate year-round, and a population rich in traditional knowledge, is very well positioned to stand as one of the top aquaculture nations in the world. ü¶ê UNIDO's Global Quality and Standards Programme (GQSP Indonesia UNIDO) Phase 2 aims to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of the Indonesian selected aquaculture value chains through innovation, diversification, quality improvement, and standards compliance for livelihood improvement. üí¨ \"Around 80% of the shrimp farming ponds in Indonesia is traditional farming with limited production inputs and highly dependent on natural resources. GQSP Indonesia phase 2 focuses to improve the productivity and sustainability of traditional shrimp farming - ultimately improving the livelihoods of small holders and coastal communities.\" shares Sudari Pawiro, National Chief Technical Advisor at UNIDO GQSP. Learn more about the initiative on seafoodmap.org üëá https://lnkd.in/exJgZzCz\n\nIndonesia has the potential to become the country with the largest aquaculture in the world because of its significant production, which is expected to continue to increase along with world population growth. So in 2050, the world population is expected to increase, which will cause an increase in demand for animal protein. Aquaculture is one of the sectors with the fastest growth over the last 40 years, with potential aquaculture production in Indonesia reaching 12 billion. The commodities with the highest production in Indonesia are tilapia, catfish, and shrimp, which contribute 19.5% of the total production. So, let's start learning and developing the aquaculture sector with Aquarev! ü¶ê üåä source: Kementrian Kelautan dan Perikanan Republik Indonesia #Aquarev #Aquaculture #Shrimp #ShrimpFarming #Startup #Sustainabillity #FoodProduction #FreshProduce\n\nüö® New Article Alert! üö® Dive into our latest publication: \"An Economic Analysis Ecoshrimp White Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) Concept on Shrimp Culture with Plastic Pond, Indonesia\" This comprehensive study explores the economic aspects of white shrimp farming using different pond sizes. Key highlights include: üìä Significant Differences in Biological and Economic Variables: The study found substantial variations between small and large ponds, with small ponds outperforming large ones in terms of the benefit-cost ratio. üåê Global Shrimp Trade Insights: Shrimp remains the most traded seafood globally, with Indonesia playing a pivotal role thanks to the introduction of Litopenaeus vannamei. üîç Detailed Methodology: Conducted in the Pacitan district, East Java, the study used structured questionnaires and multivariate statistical analysis to assess profitability, production costs, and input intensity across 40 farms. üìà Key Findings: Small ponds had higher stocking densities and survival rates. Large ponds incurred higher costs for seed, feed, labor, and electricity. Principal component analysis highlighted significant cost variations between the two pond sizes. This study offers valuable insights into the economic feasibility and management of white shrimp farming in Indonesia.

CAHAYA 89 BY BRANCH OF PT PELNI LUWUK Hi, #TemanPelni On May 26-29, 2024, the agency team of PT PELNI Luwuk Branch serves the agency of MT ships. Cahaya 89 is in the form of Clearance in/out and Load 1,800 MT/CPO at Luwuk Port. The ship that previously left Bitung Port and Bersiap returned to Bitung Port. All parties of the ship and branches are very cooperative so that the service of documents and unloading goods can run well. The MT Cahaya 89 ship has a GT of 1,139 Luwuk is a city in the province of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. As a city located in an area rich in natural resources, there are several commodities that are generally related to the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sectors. However, specific information regarding commodities in Luwuk can change over time, and can be affected by factors such as seasonality, market changes, and government policies.Some commodities that are commonly found in areas such as Luwuk, Central Sulawesi, may involve agricultural products such as coconut, oil palm, rice, coffee, cocoa, and spices. In the fisheries sector, fish and other marine products can also be the main commodities. In addition, timber and other forest products can also be part of economic activities in the area. The agency of PT. PELNI is supported by 45 branches and 116 terminal points throughout as well as human resources with experienced shipping backgrounds.

However, the reality remains that Indonesia‚Äôs fishery production is still below that of other countries. Since 2018, Indonesia has been striving to increase its fisheries exports, recognizing the immense potential it holds. Data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) shows that crustaceans are the largest contributors to Indonesia‚Äôs fisheries exports. Among these, vannamei shrimp accounts for a total of 60.17 percent of the overall exports. Up to this point, Indonesia‚Äôs exports have relied on comparative factors to maintain its competitiveness, especially in pricing. However, many countries now rely on technology and specialized expertise concerning environmental issues, sustainability, health, safety, and social concerns. So, what are the obstacles and challenges of Indonesian shrimp export that need to be addressed to achieve the expected increase in exports as envisioned by the government?

Consider Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) ‚Äì which raises multiple organisms from different rungs of the food chain farmed together in common environments to complement one another to reduce waste and improve growth efficiency. #Aquaculture is a key component in addressing global #foodsecurity and continues to grow in Thailand and throughout Asia. As the global population grows and prospers, and the demand for protein grows with it, it is important to remember the advantages of #USSoy. In Asia and elsewhere, U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC) is ready with a uniquely high-quality, sustainably grown and versatile product. https://lnkd.in/eZJRiVmf\n\nüì¢Q&A Series On The Shrimp Industry ü¶ê We're excited to introduce our new series of Q&A where we dive into questions inspired by our exchanges at seminar and exhibitions, our technical managers or the news, and share insights about the aquaculture landscape! üîç Question 1: Which country has the highest salinity level for aquaculture? üìå Answer Of Christian Yu-Hsiang Chen, Aquaculture Division Manager: ‚ÄúAll of the Top 10 shrimp-producing countries boast extensive coastlines, offering a diverse range of saline aquaculture environments. üåè For instance, in the Machala area of Ecuador where I was stationed, near mangrove aquaculture islands, the salinity is typically 32-34 ppt. However, there are also lower salinity levels closer to inland areas. It's worth noting that after China's Hai Da Group established a factory in Ecuador in 2020, they expanded slightly inland aquaculture with experiences from China, with salinities ranging from 10-20 ppt, resulting in a significant increase in national production. But this may also bring risks due to the high-density aquaculture of other shrimp-producing countries. In addition, in cooperation with customers in Indonesia, such as Situbondo in East Java, Purworejo in Central Java, and Anyar in West Java, there are many saline aquacultures. However, salinity levels can range from 7-10 ppt near inland areas. In the collaborative field trial site in Penang, Malaysia, the salinity is 7 ppt, while in Yongzhou, Zhouzhuang, it's 11-13 ppt, and in Jin'an, Fujian, customers are accustomed to levels above 30 ppt. In short, except for the Middle East, the salinity levels for aquaculture vary in each country. ‚Äú Stay tuned for more insights in our upcoming Q&As, delving deeper into the shrimp industry!
