        "text": "Welcome to biking in Carroll Countyâ€¦ where 10 loop tours, consisting of over 150 miles of cycling, offer varying degrees of difficulty. Our bike tours provide the recreational cyclist a unique view of scenic back roads while highlighting scenic stops and historic attractions.\n\nCyclists are encouraged to assess the relative physical conditions of the roads for safety. Furthermore, traffic volume and speed can vary greatly with time of day and day of the week. Therefore, these factors must be evaluated by each cyclist when determining route safety.\n\nAnd, if you want to explore our County further, consider an overnight stay at one of our quaint B&Bs or our reasonably priced hotels. When you finish your ride or need a break, stop by one of the many restaurants, coffee shops, or bakeries along our Main Streets for a relaxing meal or a take-away lunch."
