        "text": "Flora, Indiana – Childrens Garden, a new childcare provider, celebrated a significant milestone last Friday as they broke ground on their new facility located in Flora, IN. The event marked the commencement of a project aimed at addressing the critical need for accessible childcare services in the region.\n\nThe new childcare center will offer 85 additional seats, providing much-needed relief to families seeking quality childcare options in Carroll County. The goal of the new facility would be to obtain a level-4 Paths to QUALITY designation, Indiana’s statewide quality rating and improvement system for early care and education. It will be one of the first facilities in Carroll County to obtain this designation.\n\nThe realization of this project was made possible through a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders. Childrens Garden extends its gratitude to the Carroll County Economic Development Corporation, Purdue University, and the generous support from Lilly Endowment Inc. Their partnership and contributions have been instrumental in bringing this initiative to fruition.\n\nWe are excited to see this important project move forward. Accessible childcare is vital for the economic growth and well-being of our community. We commend Childrens Garden for their dedication to addressing this need and are proud to support their efforts.\n\nJacob Adams\n\nExecutive Director of the Carroll County Economic Development Corporation\n\nCarroll County has long faced challenges in accessing adequate childcare services, as highlighted by Early Learning Indiana’s report ranking it 91st out of 92 counties in terms of childcare accessibility. The establishment of this new childcare center represents a significant step forward in addressing this critical issue. By providing more families with access to high-quality childcare, the project promises to be a game-changer for the community, supporting both working parents and the early development of children.\n\nWe are thrilled to embark on this journey towards enhancing childcare accessibility in Carroll County, Our new facility will not only expand capacity but also elevate the standard of care available to families. We are deeply grateful for the support of our partners and look forward to making a positive impact in the lives of children and parents in our community.\n\nSamantha Miller\n\nDirector of Childrens Garden\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony signifies the beginning of construction, with the new childcare center expected to open its doors to families in Spring 2025. Childrens Garden invites the community to join them in celebrating this milestone and looks forward to serving the childcare needs of Carroll County for years to come.\n\nFor media inquiries or further information, please contact:\n\nJacob Adams, executive director | 765-432-4224 | jadams@carrollcountyedc.com\n\nSamantha Miller, director | info@childrensgardencc.org | www.childrensgardencc.org\n\nAbout Childrens Garden:"
