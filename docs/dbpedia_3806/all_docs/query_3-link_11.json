        "text": "Carroll County was created in 1842 by carving out a section of Grayson County.\n\nThe choice of the county's name reportedly was affected by a personal rivalry between two local members of the General Assembly, John Carroll and James Blair. John Carroll got the bill passed to create the new county, and wanted it to be named after himself. His political rival, James Blair had the bill amended to state that the name honored a Maryland official, Charles Carroll of Carrollton.\n\nWhen Charles Carroll died in 1832, he was the last person who had signed the Declaration of Independence. Carroll and Pulaski counties are the only Virginia counties named after a Catholic.\n\nJohn Carroll tried again two years later. The General Assembly renamed the county seat as \"Carrollton,\" but everyone continued to call it by the traditional name of \"Hillsville.\"1\n\nThe most famous house in Carroll County was owned by Sidna Allen. In 1912, Allen's brother was being tried in the county courthouse in Hillsville when a gun battle erupted inside the courtroom. It resulted in the death of the judge, commonwealth's attorney, sheriff, and two others. The event known by the Allen family as the Hillsville Massacre, and by others as the Carroll County shootout.\n\nIn a subsequent trial, Sidna Allen was sent to jail and his brother executed for his role in the shootout. In 2014, the house was donated to the Carroll County Historical Society and it assumed responsibility for maintaining the wooden structure.2\n\nLinks\n\nCarroll County\n\nAppalachian Regional Commission\n\nBlue Ridge Music Center\n\nBlue Ridge Travel Association of Virginia\n\nCarroll County Digital Heritage Scanning Website\n\n1912 Carroll County âHistorical Courthouse Tragedy\n\nCarroll County Historical Society and Museum\n\nThe Carroll News\n\nCensus Bureau\n\nCarroll County\n\nThe Crooked Road\n\nEncyclopedia of Virginia\n\nFloyd Allen\n\nFriends of Southwest Virginia\n\nGalax\n\nGO Virginia\n\nRegion 1\n\nHillsville 1912: A Shooting in the Court (video)\n\nLibrary of Virginia\n\nHillsville Massacre/a> (March 14, 2012)\n\nLove Carroll County\n\nMount Rogers Planning District Commission\n\nNew River Notes\n\nCarroll County\n\nIndustrial Survey - Carroll County (1929)\n\nOld Fiddlers Convention\n\nParks/Forests/Lakes/Refuges\n\nBlue Ridge Parkway\n\nCrooked Creek Wildlife Management Area\n\nHawks State Forest\n\nLovill's Creek Lake\n\nNew River Trail State Park\n\nStewart's Creek Wildlife Management Area\n\nThe Roanoker\n\nHillsville Massacre\n\n'Round the Mountain\n\nSouthwest Virginia Cultural Center and Marketplace\n\nSouthwest Virginia Heritage Guide\n\nSouthwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium\n\nTowns:\n\nHillsville\n\nTwin County Chamber Of Commerce\n\nVirginia Economic Development Partnership\n\nI81-I77 Crossroads\n\nVirginia Employment Commission\n\nCarroll County\n\nReferences\n\n1.
