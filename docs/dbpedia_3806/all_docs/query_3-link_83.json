        "text": "Today (Thursday), the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced its new Behavioral Health Service District Map, effective July 1, 2025. This map defines seven geographic service and planning areas to ensure resources are effectively allocated to support Iowa’s behavioral health needs. The districts were created following the passage of new legislation during the 2024 Iowa Legislative Session and involved a data-driven approach and extensive stakeholder engagement, with over 1,000 providers, patients, and other stakeholders providing feedback. Factors such as high-need areas, access to care, and city and county boundaries were considered when designing the districts. According to HHS staff, these new districts will distribute resources equitably, minimize service disruption, enhance access to quality care, and address the specific needs of different populations. The new map shows Carroll and Crawford counties in the northwest district, Sac and Calhoun counties in the north-central district, Greene County in the central district, and Audubon and Guthrie counties in the southwest district. HHS will host a Virtual Behavioral Health Service System District Launch on Tuesday, Aug. 6, from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. to discuss the new map and its implications. To learn more about the process and the new district map, visit the Iowa HHS website. Links to their page and details on how to attend the virtual meeting are included below.\n\n_____\n\nBehavioral Health Service System District Virtual Launch\n\nTuesday, August 6\n\n12:00–1:00 p.m."
