        "text": "Native Plant Names: Is It a Weed or Not?\n\nNative plants are those that occur historically in an ecosystem and have thrived without help from humans. Native plant names can be confusing. Sometimes the common name may include the term \"weed\" in it. For example, \"Joe-Pye Weed\" or \"Butterfly Weed.\" Even though they have \"weed\" in their name, they are still essential for providing habitat and food for migratory birds, butterflies, pollinators, and other wildlife. New Jersey has more than 2,000 native plants that are a beautiful addition to any landscape.\n\n*Note that some historically used common names may be considered culturally insensitive. Where possible, we have listed alternative names or, in some cases, eliminated references to a country of origin. The part of the name that refers to the country of origin has been replaced with the term \"Invasive.\"\n\nSummary\n\nMany of the familiar plants we see in our woodlands, along roadsides, and in fields are not native to New Jersey and cause ecological harm. These \"invasive species\" grow out of control because they have no diseases or predators controlling their spread, and deer generally don't eat them. It's tempting to think that all green plants are good, but that would be a mistake when it comes to invasive plants. We can all help stop the spread of invasive plants by not planting them in our landscapes and by replacing existing invasives with native plant species. This fact sheet focuses on invasive plants that cause ecological harm to New Jersey's natural areas and native alternatives for landscaping and gardening. Tables 1–4 include lists of invasive plant species and suggested native alternatives.\n\nWhat Are Invasive Plants and Why Are They a Problem?\n\nInvasive species are defined as species that are non-native to an ecosystem and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm, or harm to human health. Invasive species can be plants, insects, animals, fungi, pathogens, or diseases. Some invasive plant species remain commonly available in the nursery and landscaping trade. Due to browsing by an overabundant deer herd and habitat fragmentation, these invasives are outcompeting native plant populations, and are spreading quickly throughout New Jersey.\n\nUnchecked invasive plants rapidly invade natural areas, often forming monocultures (communities of just one plant), and outcompete diverse, native plant communities. For example, an upland Oak-Hickory forest of northern New Jersey with an intact native plant community can support dozens of species, including herbaceous plants (i.e., Mayapple, Wood anemone), understory shrubs (i.e., Viburnums, Spicebush), and trees (i.e., Red oak, Black cherry, Red maple, Pignut hickory). These forests offer flowers, fruit, and seeds from different species throughout the year, which in turn provide food and habitat for wildlife, including pollinators, songbirds, and small mammals. When that community is invaded by an invasive plant, for example, Burning bush (Euonymus alatus, a widespread invasive shrub), native plants are pushed out and biodiversity decreases. As there are no natural biological controls (insects or diseases) to keep the invasive population in check, one species dominates, leading to limited food and habitat for wildlife. The result is a 'broken food web.' In other words, plants form the basis of the food web, and populations of native insects and birds decline when invasive plants dominate the landscape.\n\nIn addition to the impacts to wildlife, homeowners have to spend time and money removing invasive plants. Staff time and money are diverted to managing invasive plants in parks and public lands. Scenic vistas change as invasive vines smother natural features and girdle trees. Forest succession is impacted as young tree saplings are smothered by invasive shrubs and vines. Lakes and ponds are clogged with aquatic invasives, changing water chemistry and impacting boating and fishing.\n\nWhat Causes Invasive Plants to Spread?\n\nHabitat fragmentation and disturbance are part of the reason for the invasive plant problem. Another major cause is the increase in white-tailed deer populations, which have skyrocketed in New Jersey from a normal average of 10-20 per square mile to more than 100 per square mile, in some cases (NJDEP, 2019). Deer rarely eat invasive plants, which leads to heavy browse pressure on their natural diet of native plants. Under historic deer abundance or within deer exclosures (areas fenced off from deer), native plants compete well with invasives for space and light. However, few native plants can grow to maturity when they are continually browsed, giving invasives an added advantage.\n\nInvasive plants are not a new problem impacting our natural resources. The first notable invasions occurred in the 1950s but began to rapidly increase over the last 50 years, coinciding with the rapid increase in deer abundance starting around 1970. But from nature's perspective, 50 years is just a blink of the eye. More common invasives, such as Berberis thunbergii (*Invasive barberry), Rosa multiflora (Multiflora rose), Wisteria sinensis, and Wisteria floribunda (two invasive Wisteria species) have been present for decades. These species are considered widespread and can only be controlled locally, on a site-by-site basis.\n\nNon-native species that are showing signs of spreading but have yet to become widespread are called emerging species of concern. An effective approach to prevent new, emerging species from becoming widespread is known as \"early detection/rapid response\" (ED/RR). This approach is supported by the invasion curve (Figure 3), which indicates that eradication is only feasible at the earliest stages of invasion.\n\nHow Can You Avoid Invasive Plants in Yards and Landscapes?\n\nMany of the attributes the public looks for in commercially available garden plants might also make them candidates to become invasive species. These attributes include adapting to many different site conditions, tolerance of poor soils, abundant flowers and fruit, fast growing, and insect and deer resistance. Many states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Delaware, have banned the cultivation and sale of certain invasive plants. These include more widespread species, such as *Invasive barberry (Berberis thunbergii) and Burning bush (Euonymus alatus).\n\nLandscapers, property managers, and residents can have an impact on the spread of invasive plants by choosing native plants that support habitat and replacing known invasives. A few of New Jersey’s invasive species of concern and native plant alternatives are listed in the Tables 1–4. In addition to this list, native plant nurseries carry a wide selection of native plants and can provide recommendations on alternatives to invasive species.\n\nHow Can You Start Removing and Replacing Invasive Plants?\n\nIf the decision is made to remove invasive plants in a yard, it is important to plan for species replacements.\n\nStart by making an inventory of the current species and research which are invasive (see below for resources). Determine best removal methods and best timing for species removal. Removal and replacements can happen in stages.\n\nManual or mechanical removal is recommended for small populations when the entire plant, including the root, can be removed, or when an area can be repeatedly cut/mowed to remove re-sprouts and deplete the plant’s resources.\n\nIf using herbicides to remove invasives, make sure to follow the directions on the label to determine if it is appropriate for the target plant. An excellent method for treating woody invasive plants (vines, shrubs, or trees) is to cut the plant at the base and then treat the remaining stump to prevent re-sprouts. A paintbrush can be used to apply the herbicide directly to the stump. This \"cut-stump\" method minimizes the use of herbicides and directly targets the invasive plant.\n\nSince many invasive plants are prolific seed producers, it will be necessary to monitor the area and remove seedlings until the seed bank is exhausted.\n\nWhen choosing plant replacements, remember to select the right plant for the right place. Choose native species that are appropriate for your local site, including light conditions and soil type. Tables 1–4 provide some of this information.\n\nHow Can I Learn More about This Issue?\n\nHow can an individual make decisions about invasive plants? Knowing whether the plant is invasive in the region is the first step. In addition to contacting your local Extension office, a few reliable resources are below:\n\nPlant Invaders of the Mid-Atlantic Natural Areas is a field guide for both novice and expert. It is available online and provides information on 92 aquatic and terrestrial invasive species, control methods, effects of climate change, explanations and maps of ecoregions and physiographic provinces, and suggestions for native plant alternatives.\n\nEDDMapS (Early Detection Distribution Map System) is a web-based mapping system for documenting invasive species and pest distribution. It includes species information and distribution maps, and was developed by the Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health at the University of Georgia. An app is available for mobile phones.\n\nUSDA PLANTS Database provides standardized information about the vascular plants, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, and lichens of the U.S. and its territories. It includes names, plant symbols, checklists, distributional data, and species abstracts, and identifies those states that list any species included on their invasive species list or law.\n\nThe New Jersey Invasive Species Strike Team monitors emerging species and works cooperatively with state agencies and local environmental groups to list invasive species in the state as well as control recommendations.\n\nThe New Jersey Native Plant Society is a statewide non-profit dedicated to the appreciation, protection, and study of the native flora of New Jersey. Its website has valuable information about native species and where they can be purchased.\n\niNaturalist is one of the world's most popular nature apps that can be used on a mobile device or computer. It is a tool anyone can use for identifying, recording, and sharing information about plants and other species around the world.\n\nInvasive Ornamental Plants and Suggested Native Replacements\n\nThe following lists include both emerging species of concern and widespread invasive plants. The lists were generated based on local state bans, the USDA 2018 report: \"New Invaders of the Northeast and Northcentral United States,\" the Mt. Cuba Center 2017 report: \"Native and Invasive Plants Sold by the Mid-Atlantic Nursery Industry,\" and data gathered by the New Jersey Invasive Species Strike Team (NJISST). Suggested native replacements were determined based on similar characteristics and habitat preferences.\n\nReferences\n\nCoombs, G., Gilchrist D. Watson, P. 2017.
