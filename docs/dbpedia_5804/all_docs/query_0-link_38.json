        "text": "Quick facts\n\nCommon buckthorn is a Restricted noxious weed. It is illegal to import, sell or transport buckthorn in Minnesota.\n\nCommon buckthorn is found in oak forests, savannas, prairies and riparian woods.\n\nIt completely eliminates plant diversity in the understory over time.\n\nIt thrives on well-drained soils.\n\nPlants leaf out early and hold their leaves late into the fall, creating dense shade.\n\nSeeds have a laxative effect on birds, aiding in seed dispersal.\n\nCommon buckthorn is the overwintering host for the soybean aphid.\n\nCommon buckthorn should be reported. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources provides detailed recommendations for reporting invasive species.\n\nHow to identify common buckthorn\n\nCommon buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is a tall understory shrub or small tree up to 25 feet high.\n\nSpreading, loosely branched crown.\n\nOften multiple stems at base.\n\nFemale and male plants.\n\nStem\n\nShiny gray to brown bark with light-colored lenticels (corky projections).\n\nNative plums and cherries have similar bark.\n\nBranches\n\nCut or stripped branch exposes orange sapwood.\n\nTwigs often end in stout thorns.\n\nTerminal buds and thorn often look like a hoof.\n\nLeaves\n\nOften sub-opposite, sometimes opposite.\n\nBroadly elliptic, pointed tip, smooth, dark glossy, small-toothed.\n\nStays green late into fall.\n\nFlowers\n\nInconspicuous, clustered in the axils of leaves.\n\nBlooms May or June.\n\nFruit and seeds\n\nClusters of black 1/4â€“1/2 inch fruit ripen on female plants only in August and September.\n\nFruits contain 3 to 4 seeds that are viable for 1 to 2 years in the soil.\n\nRoots\n\nExtensive fibrous root system.\n\nBuckthorn serves as a shelter for soybean aphid eggs to overwinter. It also disrupts the balance of our natural world, pushing out desirable native understory plants and creating a dark, dense thicket.\n\nThe following videos show how to identify buckthorn and practices for protecting both crops and the environment.\n\nThese Extension videos were produced with support from the Minnesota Soybean Research and Promotion Council.\n\nBuckthorn\n\n3-D image: Use your cursor to move the image.\n\nOpen in new tab to use with VR Headset\n\nAuthors: Angela Gupta, Amy Rager and Megan M.
