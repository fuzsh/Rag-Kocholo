        "text": "Wieseler (1999) states that, \\\"R. cathartica is a dioecious plant, meaning that each plant produces only male or female flowers and fruiting trees are always female. Most of the fruits fall directly beneath the shrubs, creating a dense understory of seedlings characteristic of R. cathartica stands. The plentiful fruit is eaten by birds and mice and is known to produce a severe laxative effect, helping distribute seeds through birds, often far from the parent plant. R. cathartica often establishes beneath trees at the edges of forests and fields.\\\"\n\nConverse (1984) states that, \\\"Natural reproduction is primarily sexual; asexual means are absent or insignificant. R. cathartica reaches seed bearing age quickly (Godwin 1936). Flowers of R. cathartica may be polygamous, but are usually dioecious (Barnes and Wagner 1981) and bloom May through June during leaf expansion (Fernald 1950). The globose black drupes of R. cathartica ripen in August through September, and each contains three or four grooved seeds. They ripen in July through August and have two or three ungrooved seeds (Fernald 1950). Fruit production of both species is abundant each year (Hubbard 1974). Fruit is efficiently dispersed usually by starlings, blackbirds, woodducks, elk, mice (Ridley 1930), cedar waxwings, robins and blue jays. Mice are also seed predators (Godwin 1936). Apparently, few bird species readily tolerate the anthranquinones (emodin) present especially in the immature fruit, preventing premature dispersal (Trail and Dimond 1979). R. cathartica retains fruit into, or throughout, the winter. Because R. cathartica fruit is retained on the plant longer and is therefore more visible to birds, seeds may be dispersed more frequently over long distances.\\\" The authors continue on to state that, \\\"The importance of water dispersal is unknown, but dry fruit of R. cathartica can float six days and seeds float three days before sinking\\\".\n\nPhysical: Heidorn (1990) states that, \\\"Fire is very effective in controlling R. cathartica and is the preferred method whenever feasible. Regular prescribed fire will kill seedlings and shrubs of these species in fire-adapted upland and wetland (e.g. fens, sedge meadows, marshes) sites. Some control usually will be evident after the first burn. However, for complete control in established stands of R. cathartica, burning yearly or every other year may be required for 5-6 years or more. In wetlands, where the water table has been artificially lowered, restoration of water levels often will kill R. cathartica. When burning is not feasible, larger trees can be cut or girdled and re-sprouts clipped as they occur. In upland areas where burning is not feasible, cut stumps can be treated with Trimec or Roundup to prevent re-sprouting.\\\"\n\nODNR (2003) states that, \\\"Prescribed burning has been used to control R. cathartica in some natural areas. Fire will top kill stems, however re-sprouting will occur and seed germination may increase. Several years of burning may be necessary to control these species and may not be appropriate in some natural areas. Hand pulling may be successful in small infestations, although several seasons may be required, as re-sprouting will occur if part of the root is left behind. This method also disturbs the soil, increasing seed germination. Repeated mowing has been reported effective in maintaining open areas and preventing seedling establishment.\\\"\n\nChemical: Gale (2000) states that, \\\"The best time of year to use herbicides on i>R. cathartica is just after the native grasses and wildflowers have gone dormant (Boudreau and Wilson 1992, in Gale 2000). Herbicide applications may be done early in the season just after the trees have leafed out and before the trees have begun to bud, but those conducted in the fall or early winter appear to be the most effective (Aho 2000, Bohnen 2000, Solecki 1997, in Gale 2000).\\\"\n\nODNR (2003) states that, \\\"Control of R. cathartica with systemic herbicides has been successful in many situations. Application of Roundup®, Accord®, Glypro® or Garlon 4® to cut stumps during the growing season and in warm days of winter has proven to be effective. Other application methods may include basal bark and foliar application. A foliar application of Garlon 3A® in dense thickets may be very effective in the spring and fall. Without treatment, stems will re-sprout vigorously after cutting due to the extensive root system.\\\""
