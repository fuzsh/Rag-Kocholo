        "text": "1. Description\n\nRhamnus species are shrubs or small to medium-sized trees, with deciduous or rarely evergreen foliage. Branches are unarmed or end in a woody spine. The leaf blades are undivided and pinnately veined. Leaf margins are serrate or rarely entire. Most species have yellowish green, small, bisexual or unisexual, rarely polygamous flowers; which are produced singly or in axillary cymes, cymose racemes, or cymose panicles containing a few flowers. Calyx tube campanulate to cup-shaped, with 4 or 5 ovate-triangular sepals, which are adaxially ± distinctly keeled. Petals 4 or 5 but a few species may lack petals. The petals are shorter than the sepals. Flowers have 4 or 5 stamens which are surrounded by and equal in length the petals or are shorter. The anthers are dorsifixed. The superior ovary is free, rounded, with 2-4 chambers. Fruits are a 2-4 stoned, berrylike drupe, which is obovoid-globose or globose shaped. Seeds are obovoid or oblong-obovoid shaped, unfurrowed or abaxially or laterally margined with a long, narrow, furrow. The seeds have fleshy endosperm.[1]\n\n2. Distribution\n\nRhamnus has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution,[2] with about 150 species which are native from temperate to tropical regions, the majority of species are from east Asia and North America, with a few species in Europe and Africa.[1]\n\nNorth American species include alder-leaf buckthorn (R. alnifolia) occurring across the continent, Carolina buckthorn (R. (F.) caroliniana) in the east, cascara buckthorn (R. (F.) purshiana) in the west, and the evergreen California buckthorn or coffeeberry (R. (F.) californica) and hollyleaf buckthorn (R. crocea), also in the west.\n\nIn South America, Rhamnus diffusus is a small shrub native to the Valdivian temperate rain forests of Chile.\n\nBuckthorns may be confused with dogwoods, which share the curved leaf venation; indeed, \"dogwood\" is a local name for R. prinoides in southern Africa. The two plants are easy to distinguish by slowly pulling a leaf apart; dogwoods will exude thin, white latex strings, while buckthorns will not.\n\n3. Classification\n\nThe genus has been divided into two subgenera, which are increasingly treated as separate genera:\n\nSubgenus Rhamnus: flowers with four petals, buds with bud scales, leaves opposite or alternate, branches with spines. Species include:[3]\n\n19th century illustration of Rhamnus frangula\n\nRhamnus alaternus – Italian buckthorn\n\nRhamnus alnifolia – alderleaf buckthorn, alder-leaved buckthorn[4]\n\nRhamnus arguta – sharp-tooth buckthorn\n\nRhamnus bourgaeana (unresolved species)[5] – endemic to Mallorca\n\nRhamnus cathartica – common buckthorn,[4] purging buckthorn (orth. var. R. catharticus)\n\nRhamnus crocea – redberry buckthorn (ssp. crocea), hollyleaf buckthorn (ssp. pilosa)\n\nRhamnus davurica – Dahurian buckthorn\n\nRhamnus diffusa\n\nRhamnus globosa – Lokao buckthorn\n\nRhamnus ilicifolia – hollyleaf redberry\n\nRhamnus japonica – Japanese buckthorn\n\nRhamnus lanceolata – lanceleaf buckthorn\n\nRhamnus libanotica (unresolved species)[3] – Lebanese buckthorn\n\nRhamnus ludovici-salvatoris – endemic to Mallorca\n\nRhamnus lycioides\n\nRhamnus palaestina (unresolved species)[3] – (endemic to Eastern Mediterranean)\n\nRhamnus pallasii – Fisch. & C.A. Meyer, (grows in Iran)\n\nRhamnus persica – Persian Buckthorn, Boiss.& Hohen, (grows in Iran)\n\nRhamnus petiolaris (unresolved species)[3] – (endemic to Sri Lanka)\n\nRhamnus pirifolia – island redberry buckthorn\n\nRhamnus prinoides – shiny-leaf buckthorn\n\nRhamnus pumila - dwarf buckthorn\n\nRhamnus saxatilis – rock Buckthorn, Avignon buckthorn, Avignon berry (syn. R. infectoria, R. infectorius)\n\nRhamnus serrata – sawleaf buckthorn\n\nRhamnus smithii – Smith's buckthorn\n\nRhamnus staddo – Staddo (syn. R. rhodesicus)\n\nRhamnus taquetii – Jejudo buckthorn\n\nRhamnus utilis – Chinese buckthorn\n\nSubgenus Frangula: flowers with five petals, buds without bud scales, leaves always alternate, branches without spines. Species include:\n\nRhamnus betulaefolia (Frangula betulifolia) – birchleaf buckthorn\n\nRhamnus californica (Frangula californica) – California buckthorn, coffeeberry\n\nRhamnus caroliniana (Frangula caroliniana) – Carolina buckthorn, Indian cherry (orth. var. R. carolinianus)\n\nRhamnus frangula (Frangula alnus) – alder buckthorn, glossy buckthorn,[4] breaking buckthorn, black dogwood\n\nRhamnus glandulosa – sanguino\n\nRhamnus hintonii – M.C. Johnst. & L.A. Johnst.\n\nRhamnus purshiana (Frangula purshiana) – cascara buckthorn (orth. var. R. purshianus)\n\nRhamnus rubra (Frangula rubra) – red buckthorn\n\n4. Ecology\n\nSome species are invasive outside their natural ranges. R. cathartica was introduced into the United States as a garden shrub and has become an invasive species in many areas there. It is a primary host of the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), a pest for soybean farmers across the US. The aphids use the buckthorn as a host for the winter and then spread to nearby soybean fields in the spring.[6] Italian buckthorn (R. alaternus), an evergreen species from the Mediterranean region, has become a serious weed in some parts of New Zealand,[7] especially on Hauraki Gulf islands.\n\nBuckthorns are used as food plants by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species.\n\nThe American species are known to be hosts for the oat fungus Puccinia coronata. In a 1930 study, both kerosene and salt were employed for eradication of R. Lanceolata and both proved to be less expensive than felling these bushes.[8]\n\n5. Uses\n\nThe fruit of most species contain a yellow dye and the seeds are rich in protein. Oils from the seeds are used for making lubricating oil, printing ink, and soap.[1] Many species have been used to make dyes. R. purshianus bark and fruit yield a yellow dye and, when mixed with alum, a green dye that has been used in art.[9] R. utilis provides china green, a dye used to give a bright green color to silk and wool.[10] Another species, Avignon buckthorn (R. saxatilis) provides the yellow dye Persian berry, made from the fruit.\n\nSome species may cause demyelinating polyneuropathies.[11]\n\nThe purging buckthorn (R. cathartica) is a widespread European native species used in the past as a purgative. It was in mid 17th-century England the only native purgative.[12] It was also known pre-Linnaeus as Spina Cervina.[13] The berries of Spina Cervina are black and contain a greenish juice, along with four seeds apiece; this serves to distinguish them from those of the black alder and dogberry, which contain only one or two apiece. Its syrup is said to be churlish.[14] Its toxicity makes this a very risky herbal medicine and it is no longer in use.\n\nR. prinoides is known as gesho in Ethiopia, where it is used to make a mead called tej."
