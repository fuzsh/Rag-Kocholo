        "text": "This is the official Minnesota noxious weed list. All species on the Minnesota noxious weed list include all hybrids, cultivars, and varieties unless specifically exempted.\n\nMinnesota noxious weeds are annual, biennial, or perennial plants that the commissioner designates as having the potential or are known to be detrimental to human or animal health, the environment, public roads, crops, livestock, or other property. The Commissioner of Agriculture designates noxious weeds, under M.S. 18.771, into five categories. Descriptions of each category are included on this page.\n\nThe list is current and will be updated every three years, with the exception of an emergency listing. The most recent update was January 2023 and the next update will be in January 2026.\n\nProhibited Eradicate Noxious Weeds\n\nThe \"prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds\" category includes noxious weeds that must be eradicated on all lands within the state. Transportation of the propagating parts of prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds is prohibited except as allowed under section 18.82. Prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds may not be sold or propagated in Minnesota. Noxious weeds that are designated as prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds and placed on the prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds list are plants that are not currently known to be present in Minnesota or are not widely established in the state. All prohibited-eradicate noxious weeds must be eradicated.\n\nCommon Name Scientific Name Year added to list 1. Black swallow-wort Cynanchum louiseae Kartesz & Gandhi 2013 2.

Transportation of the propagating parts of prohibited-control noxious weeds is prohibited except as allowed under section 18.82. Prohibited-control noxious weeds may not be propagated or sold in Minnesota. Noxious weeds that are designated as prohibited-control noxious weeds and placed on the prohibited-control noxious weeds list are plants that are already established throughout the state or regions of the state. At a minimum, these species must be controlled in a way that prevents spread of these species by seed or vegetative means.\n\nCommon Name Scientific Name Year added to list 1.

Noxious weeds that are designated as restricted and placed on the restricted list may be plants that are widely distributed in Minnesota and for which a requirement of eradication or control would not be feasible on a statewide basis using existing practices.\n\nCommon Name Scientific Name Year added to list 1.

Plants designated as specially regulated have been determined to pose ecological, economical, or human or animal health concerns. Species-specific management plans or rules that define the use and management requirements for these plants must be developed by the commissioner of agriculture for each plant designated as specially regulated. The commissioner must also take measures to minimize the potential for harm caused by these plants.\n\nCommon Name Scientific Name Year added to list Special regulation 1. Amur corktree Phellodendron amurense Rupr. 2023 Only sales of named male cultivars permitted. Sales of all other Phellodendron amurense are prohibited.

Each county board must submit newly proposed County Noxious Weeds to the Minnesota Department of Agriculture for review. Approved County Noxious Weeds shall also be posted with the county’s general weed notice prior to May 15th each year. Counties are solely responsible for developing County Noxious Weed lists and their enforcement. Contact your County Agricultural Inspector or County Designated Employee for more information or see a current listing of County Noxious Weeds.\n\nFederal Noxious Weeds"
