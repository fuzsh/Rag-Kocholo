Common Buckthorn

Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) is a woody shrub that can be found in any disturbed or undisturbed area including old fields, along roadsides, woodlots, and pastures. Common buckthorns can be up to 25 feet tall and is deciduous. Leaves are slightly toothed, dark green, and oval shaped. In the spring it sprouts yellow flowers in small clusters at the base of leaves. Berries are similar to those on glossy buckthorns, they are small and ripen to a dark purple color and appear in the fall. Twigs may have sharp thorns on the tip and there is a distinctive orange inner bark color.

Glossy Buckthorn

Glossy buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) is a woody shrub that is often found in wetlands, along fence rows, open woods, and along roadsides. Glossy buckthorns can either be the size of a large shrub or a small tree and are typically no larger than 18 feet. They have simple alternate leaves, with no teeth, and are shiny. White flowers bloom between May and September and small dark purple berries are visible from June to September. They have a distinctive orange inner bark.

Environmental Effects

Seeds are distributed through birds and wildlife. Both glossy and common buckthorn can form dense thickets that can prevent native species from growing underneath them. Which ultimately harms the native plant diversity present. This can also reduce the food availability to wildlife that depend on berries throughout the year.

Treatment

There are multiple treatment options for both common and glossy buckthorns. These include both chemical and non-chemical options.
