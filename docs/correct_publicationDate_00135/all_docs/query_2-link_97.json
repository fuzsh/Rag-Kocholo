Reading science fiction enables us to reflect on the ways people interact with each other, with technology, with our environment. At the same time, it gives us enjoyment and cultivates our imagination. Without exaggeration, a good science fiction book can be life-changing. If you are looking for your next sci-fi must-read,here are the top 10 classic science-fiction masterpieces that you should get started with.\n\n1. What is Sci-Fi Book and Why are They So Fascinating?\n\nSci-Fi, short for science fiction, tells a story that came from the authorâs imagination. Science fiction is imaginative writing with a scientific basis. The plot is mainly about space travel, alien beings, technology, scientific experiments, and future society, etc.\n\nWhat distinguishes Sci-Fi from other kinds of fiction is that science fiction contains unreal things that could be real in our world in the future. The unreal things in science fiction could be those amazing spaceships or robots or aliens or time machines or any other kind of technology or discovery that just maybe possibly could happen. A lot of imagination goes into writing science fiction and building a world of possibilities. Thatâs why itâs so fun to read.\n\nScience fiction is typically set in the future. There will be new technology or scientific discovery that makes things possible that would be impossible in the present. Itâs full of unreal things that could be real in our world or a similar world in the near or distant future. Sci-Fi authors write about what if and what could be, and that helps us think about whatâs happening right now and how our choices affect the future and the world.\n\n2.
