Includes the original collector's notes and COA (Certificate of Authenticity) by the publisher. No dust-jacket as issued.\n\nDan Simmons, a full-time public school teacher until 1987, is one of the few writers who consistently work across genres, producing novels described as science fiction, horror, fantasy, and mainstream fiction, while winning major awards in all these fields. His first novel, Song of Kali, won the World Fantasy Award; his first science fiction novel, Hyperion, won the Hugo Award. His other novels and short fiction have been honored with numerous awards, including nine Locus Awards, four Bram Stoker Awards, the French Prix Cosmos 2000, the British SF Association Award, and the Theodore Sturgeon Award. In 1995, Wabash College presented Simmons with an honorary doctorate in humane letters for his work in fiction and education.\n\nAbout the book\n\nThe Rise Of Endymion is a 1997 science fiction novel by American writer Dan Simmons. It is the fourth and final novel in his Hyperion Cantos fictional universe. It won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1998.\n\nThe magnificent conclusion to one of the greatest science fiction sagas of our time\n\nThe time of reckoning has arrived. As a final genocidal Crusade threatens to enslave humanity forever, a new messiah has come of age. She is Aenea and she has undergone a strange apprenticeship to those known as the Others. Now her protector, Raul Endymion, one-time shepherd and convicted murderer, must help her deliver her startling message to her growing army of disciples.\n\nBut first they must embark on a final spectacular mission to discover the underlying meaning of the universe itself. They have been followed on their journey by the mysterious Shrike--monster, angel, killing machine--who is about to reveal the long-held secret of its origin and purpose. And on the planet of Hyperion, where the story first began, the final revelation will be delivered--an apocalyptic message that unlocks the secrets of existence and the fate of humankind in the galaxy.\n\nReviews\n\n\"One of the finest achievements of modern science fiction.\"\n\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"The Rise Of Endymion, like its predecessors, is a full-blooded action novel...distinguished from formulaic space opera by the magnitude of what is at stake--which is nothing less than the salvation of the human soul.\"\n\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"A novel rich with power and passion, and an enormously satisfying conclusion to one of the major works of modern science fiction.\"\n\n--Locus\n\nFrom the Publisher\n\n\"One of the finest achievements of modern science fiction.\"\n\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"The Rise Of Endymion, like its predecessors, is a full-blooded action novel...distinguished from formulaic space opera by the magnitude of what is at stake--which is nothing less than the salvation of the human soul.\"\n\n--The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"A novel rich with power and passion, and an enormously satisfying conclusion to one of the major works of modern science fiction.\"\n\n--Locus\n\nDan Simmons\n\nDan Simmons (born April 4, 1948) is an American science fiction and horror writer. He is the author of the Hyperion Cantos and the Ilium/Olympos cycles, among other works which span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres, sometimes within a single novel. Simmons's genre-intermingling Song of Kali (1985) won the World Fantasy Award. He also writes mysteries and thrillers, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.\n\nDan Simmons was born in Peoria, Illinois, in 1948, and grew up in various cities and small towns in the Midwest, including Brimfield, Illinois, which was the source of his fictional \"Elm Haven\" in 1991's SUMMER OF NIGHT and 2002's A WINTER HAUNTING. Dan received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970, winning a national Phi Beta Kappa Award during his senior year for excellence in fiction, journalism and art.\n\nDan received his Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis in 1971. He then worked in elementary education for 18 years -- 2 years in Missouri, 2 years in Buffalo, New York -- one year as a specially trained BOCES \"resource teacher\" and another as a sixth-grade teacher -- and 14 years in Colorado.\n\nHis last four years in teaching were spent creating, coordinating, and teaching in APEX, an extensive gifted/talented program serving 19 elementary schools and some 15,000 potential students. During his years of teaching, he won awards from the Colorado Education Association and was a finalist for the Colorado Teacher of the Year. He also worked as a national language-arts consultant, sharing his own \"Writing Well\" curriculum which he had created for his own classroom. Eleven and twelve-year-old students in Simmons' regular 6th-grade class averaged junior-year in high school writing ability according to annual standardized and holistic writing assessments. Whenever someone says \"writing can't be taught,\" Dan begs to differ and has the track record to prove it. Since becoming a full-time writer, Dan likes to visit college writing classes, has taught in New Hampshire's Odyssey writing program for adults, and is considering hosting his own Windwalker Writers' Workshop.\n\nDan's first published story appeared on Feb. 15, 1982, the day his daughter, Jane Kathryn, was born. He's always attributed that coincidence to \"helping in keeping things in perspective when it comes to the relative importance of writing and life.\"\n\nDan has been a full-time writer since 1987 and lives along the Front Range of Colorado -- in the same town where he taught for 14 years -- with his wife, Karen. He sometimes writes at Windwalker -- their mountain property and cabin at 8,400 feet of altitude at the base of the Continental Divide, just south of Rocky Mountain National Park. An 8-ft.-tall sculpture of the Shrike -- a thorned and frightening character from the four Hyperion/Endymion novels -- was sculpted by an ex-student and friend, Clee Richeson, and the sculpture now stands guard near the isolated cabin.\n\nDan is one of the few novelists whose work spans the genres of fantasy, science fiction, horror, suspense, historical fiction, noir crime fiction, and mainstream literary fiction . His books are published in 27 foreign counties as well as the U.S. and Canada.\n\nMany of Dan's books and stories have been optioned for film, including SONG OF KALI, DROOD, THE CROOK FACTORY, and others. Some, such as the four HYPERION novels and single Hyperion-universe novella \"Orphans of the Helix\", and CARRION COMFORT have been purchased (the Hyperion books by Warner Brothers and Graham King Films, CARRION COMFORT by European filmmaker Casta Gavras's company) and are in pre-production. Director Scott Derrickson (\"The Day the Earth Stood Stood Still\") has been announced as the director for the Hyperion movie and Casta Gavras's son has been put at the helm of the French production of Carrion Comfort. Current discussions for other possible options include THE TERROR. Dan's hardboiled Joe Kurtz novels are currently being looked as the basis for a possible cable TV series.\n\nIn 1995, Dan's alma mater, Wabash College, awarded him an honorary doctorate for his contributions in education and writing.\n\nLiterary references\n\nMany of Simmons's works have strong ties with classic literature. For example:\n\nHis 1989 novel Hyperion, winner of Hugo and Locus Awards for the best science fiction novel, deals with a space war and is inspired in its structure by Boccaccio's Decameron and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.\n\nThe Hyperion Cantos take their titles from poems by the British Romantic John Keats.\n\nThe title of Carrion Comfort, as well as many of its themes, derives from the poem \"Carrion Comfort\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\nThe Hollow Man (1992) is a novel influenced by Dante's Inferno and T. S. Eliot\n\n\"The Great Lover\" (1993) is a short story inspired by the World War I War Poets\n\nSimmons's collection of short stories, Worlds Enough & Time, takes its name from the first line of the poem \"To His Coy Mistress\" by English poet Andrew Marvell: \"Had we but world enough, and time\"\n\nThe detective in Flashback is named Nick Bottom after a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream\n\nFeatures"
