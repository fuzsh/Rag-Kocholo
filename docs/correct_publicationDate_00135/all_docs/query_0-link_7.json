        "text": "In my review of Hyperion, I mentioned how I wasn’t the biggest fan of the ending, because in the context of that book alone, it seems a bit unfinished and just it doesn’t seem like an ending at all. But after reading the sequel, Fall of Hyperion, it makes more sense. I have no complaints about the ending of Hyperion at all anymore, because this whole book is basically the ending of that story\n\nSo yes, this is basically Hyperion part II. It starts immediately after Hyperion ended. And yes if you haven’t read Hyperion, check out my review of it to know why you should read it, and then read it, and go back here.\n\nAnyway, here are the things that I loved about this book:\n\nThe way the PoV works.\n\nWhile in the first book the PoV was quite standard, this book does something really interesting with it. So it starts off with standard 1st person POV, but then it seemed to randomly switch to 3rd person omniscient POV, and later it’s revealed that it’s not actually that, in reality, because of some scifi shenanigans, it’s actually still the same 1st person POV. It’s just really new to me and I love the creativity. So yes, the way the POVs intertwine with each other is really really interesting and the content within the POVs itself are also exciting because a lot of them are further explorations of concepts that are already touched upon in the first book. Which is a perfect segue to number two…\n\nSomehow it’s more high concept than the 1st one\n\nOne of my favorite things about the first one is how high concept it is, especially considering when it was written. And yet, this book somehow managed to top that, by doing what I just mentioned before. It takes all the foundation that Hyperion already laid down, and built upon that in a very satisfying way, so that it’s not ONLY high concept, but it also uses its high-concept-ness as a way to build a great thematic base for the book. And while I wouldn’t call these the “theme” exactly, the two things that are explored a lot in this book are religion or more specifically, the concept of deity or godhood, and the second one being poetry, or more specifically, the roles of poets in the grander scheme of things. And the way these two things are portrayed are just so masterful and everything about it is really fascinating especially the way the book combines those two things. The whole thing just made me realize why the book is called Hyperion and the series is called Hyperion Cantos. The first book also made me realize that but only superficially, while this book, made me realize that in a deeper and more meaningful way. This book just works thematically. Like it’s concise about it but doesn’t leave too much unclear and most importantly, despite the heavy emphasis on theme, it does something really well, which is my number 3…\n\nThe characters.\n\nOften in these stories that rely heavily on its themes, the characters are treated as secondary. Or as vessels to deliver whatever thematic stuff the author wants to say, but fortunately, that’s not the case here. The characters are still as interesting and engaging as they were in the first book. And what’s even better is the fact that the book also explored a lot of characters or sides of the story that didn’t get much spotlight in the first book. My favorite being Meina Gladstone, the CEO of the Hegemony. But she’s not the only one, there are multiple characters from the Hegemony, the Core, and the Ousters that got their chances to shine, where in the first book, it’s mostly just the Hyperion Pilgrims.\n\nOkay, now that I’ve talked about the good stuff, I wanna talk about the things I didn’t like. Fortunately, there aren’t that many of them.\n\nThe revelation. There’s this revelation, it’s not even a twist really, at the end that I feel a bit iffy about. Like… it makes sense based on all the crumbs of foreshadowing that have been given before that, but those things still feel a bit forced and yeah I’m just not the biggest fan of that I guess. Like I would like the story a lot more if this part wasn’t included in the book.\n\nThe writing, especially in the second half. I like the writing for the majority of the book. But at some point in the second half, when the book delves into the more high concept parts of it, the prose became a bit tiring to read and so I just kinda took a while to get through those parts. While I do like the actual content of those parts, I don’t like the way it’s delivered because it’s just so bland and exhausting to go through.\n\nBut other than those two things, I really like this book. One of the things about sequels that I like is if it expands upon what is already being setup in the original, instead of just carving a new path. And that’s exactly what The Fall of Hyperion did. I’m giving this book a solid ⅘."
