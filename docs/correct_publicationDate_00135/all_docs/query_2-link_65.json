Writing was the air in Sarah’s lungs until the baby came along and took her breath away. Now she’s juggling motherhood, the novel, work-work, her husband and geriatric French Bulldogs, and has accepted that she’ll never sleep again.\n\nView Posts →\n\nRachel Barenbaum\n\nRachel Barenbaum is the author of the critically-acclaimed novels Atomic Anna and A Bend in the Stars.
