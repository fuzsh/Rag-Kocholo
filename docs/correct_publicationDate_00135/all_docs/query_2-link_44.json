Life is unpredictable, filled with hurdles and setbacks that knock us down. However, what truly matters is our ability to rise from those falls and keep moving forward. Whittaker suggests that the number of times we stumble is inconsequential compared to our unwavering spirit to get back up, learn from our mistakes, and continue striving for our goals. This quote serves as a reminder that success and growth are not measured by the absence of failure but by our resilience in overcoming obstacles.",
