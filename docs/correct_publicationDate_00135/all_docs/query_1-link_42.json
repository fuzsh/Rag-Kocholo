        "text": "This will spoil you for anything less\n\nI don't write separate reviews for books in a series. Especially here, where Hyperion has been called the prologue to the Fall of Hyperion (FoH), it's been intimated that the former cannot stand on its own and I agree. Some have compared and contrasted the two connoting that there is perhaps a lack of cohesion and that they are very dissimilar. To that end, I disagree. The \"prologue\" smoothly transitions into the main body of the work and feels completely natural. Taken together, the two seem very much a part of a cohesive whole.\n\nI was skeptical that the stellar cast of narrators of Hyperion could be equaled by a single actor, albeit Victor Bevine in FoH. Mr. Bevine was phenomenal and I never, at any point in the listening, felt like the work was diminished.\n\nIt is good that I have listened to this author later in life. Having been brought up reading the classics of all genre of literature, it is often difficult to appreciate lesser works after having experienced the masters. Dan Simmons is a master when compared to authors of any genre. I have heard Simmons compared to Dickens. Truly in his development of characters, the comparison seems a fair one. It would be hard to compare the plot of this work to that of any other.\n\nOften fraught with and characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtapositions, the work is almost too much to be believed. But somehow Simmons makes it all believable for some time in the future. Unlike some classic, older SciFi which seemed futuristic when it was written but then later became seemingly dated, this piece is fresh, modern or hopefully even timeless. There's religion, technology, philosophy, excitement, a great deal of love and caring among seven pilgrim strangers and funny, now that I think about it, only one real villain in a world that is more vast than I can even imagine. This is truly a magnum opus in every sense of the word.\n\nSuperb story!\n\nThis sequel to Hyperion neatly wraps up the adventures of our intrepid pilgrims as they face up to the future unknown being deposited at their feet, willing or not. Simmons keeps the listener glued to the book as the story unfolds and all the threads come together in a brilliant climax.\n\nDefinitely one of my best in a long history of science fiction reading. Characters with enormous development, technology and time shifts to spin the mind and a brilliant story to bind it all make this a \"cannot press pause or stop\" book.\n\nHyperion leaves you on the edge, thirsting for more. The Fall of Hyperion drowns you in the scale and breadth of the sequel.\n\nA brilliant book with brilliant narration make this a modern day classic equal of the best in any genre.\n\nJust as good as when I read it years ago\n\nI tend to consider this book and Hyperion as a single book. Broken in two because it would be too heavy as a single book, or too intimidating for many people. So, my review for Hyperion is also my review for Fall of Hyperion.\n\nI first read this book years and years ago. One of my first forays into \"hard\" sci-fi. I loved it. I've revisited many books I read way-back-when, and sometimes find myself disappointed. Not Hyperion or Fall of Hyperion. Still as good. Still as thought provoking. I liked how each character had their own voice, it was well done. Very smooth transitions, voices at the same volume. Not at all like the \"dramatic readings\" I've listened to before. I did not like the voice of Martin Silenus, the poet. He annoyed me. But maybe that was the point of casting that particular voice actor, Martin Silenus is a very annoying character.\n\nFantastic Resolution to Hyperion!\n\nWould you listen to The Fall of Hyperion again? Why?\n\nMaybe, but not before I listen to Endymion and The Rise of Endymion the nest 2 books in this great, great series. Best series I have read since Dune. Mind blowing!\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of The Fall of Hyperion?\n\nThe story arch and resolution of the Rachel story was very memorable, especially in the way it linked back to the other pilgrims. Not only well written but on the level with other great Sci Fi and Fantasy classics I have enjoyed over the years such as Lord of the Rings and Dune. Truly memorable.\n\nWhat does Victor Bevine bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nThis is a complex story rich in detail. Victor does such a good job (glad he is the reader on the next 2 books in the series) that he keeps you engaged throughout. Frankly if I read the book I might have missed some of the detail that he brought to life. Great job, on a par with Scott Brick who I also enjoy very much.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nThis is a relevant book, that is provocative and thought t provoking. It will make you re-consider politics, religion, technology, the environment, myth making and the quality and meaning of life itself. It is also the only Sci Fi I have every read that is so heavily poetry and literature referenced. I found that unique and compelling. As a lover of literature for many years, Simmons has almost created a new genre by referencing ideas and stores that are not typically part of Sci Fi. A very complex and multi-layered story on many levels.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI am not sure I would recommend this book to my friends who are of an unquestioning religions mind and belief. I found the religious elements to the story very thought provoking but others may find it off putting, if they have never been asked to question their religious beliefs. I think ti is true with many elements of art, but some readers should just be aware of this before beginning the Hyperion Series. However if you have eve questioned history or the myths we all live with you will find this story fascinating and unique. I cannot recommend it highly enough! Enter the Time Tombs, Beware the Shrike!\n\nRequires thought and compassion\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nI would recommend this book to friends that enjoy philosophy, theology and literature.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nThe Consul. The tragic hero in a very Greek way.\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nI loved the depiction of the hybrid Severin's last days on the Hidden Earth.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nIt made me think, and pity.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nMakes you want to go back and read Keats where the first book of the series makes you want to read Chaucer."
