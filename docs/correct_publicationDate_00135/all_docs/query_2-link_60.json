His first novel is entitled The Lake, The River & The Other Lake.\n\nAmick holds an M.F.A. from George Mason University and has been a college instructor, playwright, copywriter, songwriter and musician. He lives in Michigan, dividing his time between his hometown, Ann Arbor, and a family cottage on a famously clear lake along the northern edge of the Lower Peninsula.\n\n\"The last writer to celebrate the charms of rural Michigan with equal panache was probably Ernest Hemingway.\"\n\n--Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Amick's thrilling first novel The Lake, The River & The Other Lake, offers an entertaining look at people who 'have a lot of junk going on.' Set in the upper Michigan lake town of Weneshkeen, where tourists mix with locals in a series of clashes that move from the hilarious to the heartfelt ...Amazingly rich and colorful, the writing flows so smoothly that one's only regret might be that the novel has to end. Highly recommended.\"\n\n--Library Journal\n\nSteve Amick's website\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nSpecial Collections' holdings of Amick's work\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nFebruary 3, 2006\n\nMichael Rodriguez interviews fiction writer Steve Amick\n\nFiction writer Steve Amick reads from his award winning book, \"The lake, the river & the other lake : a novel.\"\n\nCharles Baxter is the author of the novel The Feast of Love, which was a finalist for the National Book Award.

He now teaches at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"Watch out for the 'quiet Midwestern' tag on [Baxter's] writing: That's the iceberg you will strike. There is nothing simple in his universe, and nothing solely on the surface. Baxter's intelligence and humor are submerged, and dangerous.

Carey became a Waldenbooks best-selling novelist with her lively novelization of the TV series, Harem, then went on to revolutionize the licensed line of Star Trek novels with her ground-breaking adventure Dreadnought!, which took the line to the New York Times Top Ten Bestseller List. Later Diane was asked to write the first original novel for Star Trek: The Next Generation. Several of Carey’s Star Trek novels thereafter went straight to the Upper NYT Bestseller list, including the Hardcover Top 15 novel, Best Destiny. Carey remained Pocket Books’ most dependable “anchor” author for many years, often asked to launch or bracket whole series-within-series. Carey has written two Civil War novels, Distant Drums and Rise Defiant, and a Young Adult series called Distressed Call 911.

After receiving B.A. degrees in psychology and English literature from Lake Forest College, she took part in a work exchange program and spent six months working in a bookstore in London. While living abroad, the desire to write professionally emerged as a driving passion. Upon returning, she embarked in earnest on a writing career, which came to fruition a decade later. During this time she worked at the art center of an area college, gaining a strong background in the visual arts. She currently lives in west Michigan.\n\n\"The promise of Kushiel's Dart, the first volume of Carey's immense trilogy set in a skewed Renaissance world, is more than realized in this splendid conclusion…Effortlessly rich in adventurous incident, with a huge cast of well-defined characters, this poignant and robust story will appeal to both fantasy lovers and fans of erotic romance.\"\n\n--Peter Cannon, in a Publisher’s Weekly review of Kushiel’s Avatar\n\nJacqueline Carey's website\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nSpecial Collections' holdings of Carey's work\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nNovember 7, 2003\n\nLeslie Behm interviews essayist and fantasy writer Jacqueline Carey\n\nEssayist and fantasy writer Jacqueline Carey reads excerpts from her book \"Godslayer\" at the Michigan Writers Series\n\nWriting partners Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. have co-authored numerous box office hits over the past 20 years.

In Patricia Clark's North of Wondering, with its ambitious allusion to Robert Frost's first collection North of Boston, place, culture, and climate intersect with reasoning and emotions to map the contours of wondering, as if the word itself were a small town, or a particular region, somewhere, that she wanted us to experience in all its complexity, from the nuances of questioning to marveling\"\n\n--Mary Stewart Hammond\n\nPatricia Clark's website\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nSpecial Collections' holdings of Clark's work\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nMarch 18, 2005\n\nMichael Rodriguez interviews poet Patricia Clark\n\nPoet Patricia Clark reads her selected works at the Michigan Writers Series\n\nSince its publication midway through 2005, Clemens’s Made in Detroit has received much attention, and created some controversy. Made in Detroit is the story of a young man’s education in social and racial realities most writers would rather avoid. But it is also the story of a literary apprenticeship in the classic American mold. In addition to his youthful Catholicism, Clemens acquired another belief–in reading and writing–and he embraced the writer’s vocation with the enthusiasm that only those raised in a household devoid of books can. Yet, in coming to grips with Detroit, and race relations in America in general, he discovered that there are places–geographic, mental, emotional–where even literature cannot help.\n\nPaul Clemens grew up in the northeast corner of Detroit, just south of the city’s famed 8 Mile border. In his moving and affectionate memoir, Clemens, born the year Detroit’s first black mayor (the legendary Coleman Young) was elected, tracks his own growth to maturity against the background of the city’s long decline during Young’s twenty years at the helm.\n\n“In Made In Detroit, Paul Clemens tells a personal account of the life and death of an American city. Love among the ruins is never easy, sweet, comfortable, or without a sense of injury, and so it proves here. With clarity, courage, and a deep familiarity with his literary predecessors—from James Joyce to James Baldwin—Clemens has written a book as riven, wounded, and yet surprisingly durable as its subject.”\n\n--Jeffrey Eugenides, author of The Virgin Suicides and Middlesex\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nMarch 31, 2006\n\nMichael Rodriguez interviews author Paul Clemens\n\nAuthor Paul Clemens reads from his book \"Made in Detroit\" at the Michigan Writers Series\n\nSteve has been writing horror/fantasy for most of his life.

His first two poetry collections, Places/Everyone and Punching Out, set in Detroit neighborhoods and factories, have been described as realistic, gritty, and sometimes violent, but were praised for their tough, spare style and unsentimental portrayal of working people's lives. His third book, M-80, centers on urban violence and its after-effects, while his more recent books, Niagara Falls, Blessing this House, and Blue Jesus changed course with their issues of faith. He has edited or co-edited four anthologies of poetry, including Letters to America: Contemporary American Poetry on Race, and American Poetry: The Next Generation. Daniels also wrote the screenplay for \"No Pets,\" an independent feature film directed by Tony Buba, and wrote \"Heart of Hearts,\" a one-act play produced at the 13th Street Repertory Theater in New York. His most recent works include: Street, a collection of poems paired with the photos of photographer and Carnegie Mellon professor Charlee Brodsky; and Dumpster, an independent feature film Daniels wrote and produced, both of which appeared in 2005.\n\nHe is the author of eight books of poems, including Show and Tell: New and Selected Poems, which was a finalist for the 2004 Paterson Poetry Prize. Daniels' second book of short stories, Detroit Tales, received a bronze medal for the 2004 ForeWord Book of the Year in the fiction-short stories category. Places/Everyone won the Brittingham Prize for Poetry from the University of Wisconsin Press. Daniels' other awards include two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and two from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts.

Like a nightmarish daydream or a hazy trip through a carnival freak show, Ditchoff's book suggests that its pages are mirrors and the reader should think again before deciding which images are truly monstrous.

Since the appearance of his first novel, The Oklahoma Punk in 1976, Loren D. Estleman has written 53 books and hundreds of short stories and articles. An authority on both criminal history and the American West, Estleman has been called the most critically acclaimed author of his generation.

For all the close focus of the individual poems, Brace's Cove expresses an entire contemporary American life over the last 20 years. The collection's title--an Atlantic cove to the north of Gloucester, Massachusetts--points to Featherstone's grounding in particulars, especially his painterly love affair with landscape, nature, and the animal world. Featherstone is that great rarity, a poet completely accessible to new readers of poetry who also gets the highest praise from veteran poets who prize craft and workmanship.\n\nHe served as an editor of the New Republic from the middle 1960's to the 1980's, when his literary criticism, his political journalism, and his writing on education made him one of the country's best-known critics. (Education Week recently listed him as one of 100 notable figures who influenced US education over the course of the last century.) He has taught at Harvard, Brown, and Michigan State. He has also spent the last two decades as an educational practitioner--first as headmaster of the Commonwealth School in Boston, and then as one of the founders and faculty leaders of an acclaimed teacher education program at Michigan State.\n\nFeatherstone was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Japan. He now lives with his wife, Helen Featherstone, and their 3 daughters in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and East Lansing, Michigan.\n\n\"Brace's Cove is a remarkably beautiful first book of poems. These poems are unembellished, permeable, musically sweet, riddled with necessity.

She is a retired MSU professor of English who has now devoted her life to creating message-oriented art. The Dead Are So Disappointing is her first collection of poetry.\n\n\"The Dead Are So Disappointing is a daughter's unflinching meditation on the days immediately preceding and following her father's death-and an interrogation into the lasting impact his life has had on her own. This collection stands revealed as an integral part of a long-delayed mourning process as the daughter struggles to reconcile the competing emotions of anger and grief, betrayal and loyalty, that surfaced after her father's death. ... Katherine Fishburn's first collection of poems is truly moving. As she probes 'the grief of time,' she rehearses the complexities of life in families, with families and without them, easily taking us with her into the private tangles of contemporary relationships.\"\n\n-- Linda Wagner, Martin Hanes Professor of English, UNC, Chapel Hill\n\nKatherine Fishburn writes: \"In one way or another I have always been a poet-in the way I see the world and in the way I write about it. From both my parents I learned early the habit of words. I learned to look up their meaning, follow the path of their usage, revel in their sound and construction. The unabridged dictionary has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. One might even say it elevated my thoughts. For, not only did my family consult it regularly, we also used it as a booster chair to help young children reach their dinner.\n\nFrom both my parents, but most particularly my father, I learned the art of seeing nature-comets in their orbits, spiders at their webs, beetles in their astounding numbers (weighing in at a quarter million species), birds in residence and in migration. Nothing was too small or insignificant to examine for hours on end. Everything must be accounted for, identified, researched, and understood. Only then could I say that I had truly seen an assassin bug, a garter snake, a snapping turtle.\n\nFrom my mother, herself an English teacher, I learned to hear the poets sing and note their patterns. Be they from Chaucer, Shakespeare or Tennyson, the poets' words thundered and echoed throughout my childhood and in conjunction with my father's scientific training helped to shape my relationship with the world-be it the relationship I have had with canines, amphibians, arthropods, or humans.\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nMarch 31, 2000\n\nJane Arnold interviews poet Katherine Fishburn\n\nPoet Katherine Fishburn reads her selected works at the Michigan Writers Series\n\nCarolyn Forché's first poetry collection, Gathering The Tribes, won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award from the Yale University Press.

Born in Detroit, she graduated with a B.A. in 1972 from Justin Morrill College, a residential college at MSU devoted to the liberal arts.\n\n\"The voice we hear in Blue Hour is a voice both very young and very old. It belongs to someone who has seen everything and who strives imperfectly, desperately, to be equal to what she has seen.

His novels and novellas--including Wolf, A Good Day to Die, Farmer, Legends of the Fall, Warlock, Sundog, Dalva, The Woman Lit by Fireflies, Julip, The Road Home, and The Beast God Forgot to Invent--have been published in twenty-two languages, and many of them have been adapted to the screen as feature motion pictures.\n\nHis nine volumes of poetry include Plain Song, Locations, Letters to Yesenin, The Theory and Practice of Rivers, After Ikkyu, and The Shape of the Journey.

A French film documentary about Harrison and The Hour of the Wolf was released in Europe in 1993.\n\nHarrison received B.A. and M.A. degrees in English and Comparative Literature from Michigan State University in 1960 and 1966 respectively. Born in Grayling in 1937, raised in Reed City and Haslett, he is the son of a county agent who moved the Harrison family to the East Lansing area so his children could attend Michigan State University.\n\n\"The novella all but boils over with dreams -- dreams of literature, love, loss, of all those epic L-words that too few writers seem brave enough, in these chilly times, to address on anything but ironic terms. \"I Forgot to Go to Spain\" is imbued with all the gravelly melancholy of a Tom Waits ballad, but it never once, despite that swarm of L-words, forces sentiment; the autumnal passion that drives the tale is never less than tactile. I could go on -- about the casual lack of geometry and astounding texture of Harrison's prose, about the delicacy of his characterizations -- but why? \"I Forgot to Go to Spain\" is above my twerpy praise. It's simply thrilling to see a writer reach for the sky and actually grab it.\"\n\n-- Jonathan Miles\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nView Special Collections' holdings of Harrison's work\n\nAmy Hassinger is the author of two novels.

She was the winner of a 1997 Hopwood Award, and has also served as a judge for the Hopwood Awards.\n\n\"Deanne Lundin's The Ginseng Hunter's Notebook is an authentic poetic harmonium, blending a probative and anxious post-modernism with a nearly primitive lyric sensibility. I am struck and pleased by her lucid sense of the present, clarifying the moment as we live it, but equally awed by the transformations of her fractious narratives, wrung from her wide and wild historical flair. Hildegard of Bingen meets the Internet, indeed! Here are potions, conjurations, folkloric remedies, like voices from a vexing past–are they our real parents? are they our demons? –as acrid, as overwhelming, as they are brilliant and healing. The Ginseng Hunter's Notebook is a marvelous debut.\"\n\n--David Baker\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nView Special Collections' holdings of Deanne Lundin's work\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nFebruary 7, 2003\n\nMichael Rodriguez interviews poet Deanne Lundin\n\nPoet Deanne Lundin reads her selected works at the Michigan Writers Series\n\nThomas Lynch is an essayist, poet and funeral director.

Her stories are greatly influenced by her experiences in small Midwestern towns, where everybody knows somebody who knows somebody, and the natural splendor of all four seasons and freshwater lakes shapes character like the glaciers once shaped this land. Her stories have appeared in StoryQuarterly, River City, Hayden’s Ferry Review, South Dakota Review, Elysian Fields Quarterly: The Baseball Review and other places, and she has been nominated twice for Pushcart prizes.\n\nShe received her B.A. in journalism from Michigan State University, where she proudly contributed to The State News and helped the newspaper earn two consecutive Pacemaker awards-one while serving as Editor-in-Chief.

Raphael taught at the university level in New York, Massachusetts and Michigan for 13 years and the first course he designed was a multi-disciplinary study of the Holocaust. He left teaching over a decade ago to write and review full-time.\n\n\"Lev Raphael's stories are as thrilling as his thrillers, but for an entirely different set of reasons: the psychological perspicacity, good humor and deep empathy with which he approaches all the secret anniversaries of the heart—his lovely title—that make up his characters' wonderfully flawed humanity.\"\n\n--Jonathan Wilson, author of A Palestine Affair\n\nLev Raphael's website\n\nMichigan Writers Collection\n\nView Special Collections' holdings of Raphael's work\n\nMichigan Writers Series\n\nJanuary 22, 1999\n\nJane Arnold interviews mystery writers Lev Raphael and Loren D.

In 1996, The Carnegie Foundation named him Michigan Professor of the Year.\n\nRidl grew up in the worlds of big time sports and the circus; his father coaching basketball at Westminster College and the University of Pittsburgh. Ridl was a point guard and a shortstop. He also spent a lot of his time with his cousin who was a circus man. Jack's poems often reflect these influences, as does his teaching.\n\nRidl lives along Lake Michigan with his wife, Julie. He has been a member of the Hope faculty since 1971, and is also the founder of Hope College's The Visiting Writers Series, which, since 1985, has brought more than 150 writers to campus.\n\nOf his poems, U.S. Poet Laureate Billy Collins wrote: \"Against Elegies arises from a sense of curiosity about life in both its plain and puzzling aspects. These poems feel their way forward and are attentive enough to the reader to make us feel included--happy accomplices to his search.\" And Naomi Shihab Nye has written, \"Jack Ridl gracefully renders all realms of experience in a voice that is brave, compelling, and true; anyone who still has a glimmer of thought that poetry is two steps removed from life would do well to read his poems.\"\n\nJack Ridl's website\n\nMichigan Writers Coll"
