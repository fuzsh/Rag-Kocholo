        "text": "With some of the best world-building in sci-fi, Simmons tells a story of humanity struggling to find meaning in violence and helplessness as it conquers the stars. God does not answer. Hyperion’s demon awaits.\n\nHyperion begins the journey of seven pilgrims chosen to confront the Shrike, a monster or maybe god which is mysteriously connected to the beginnings of the first interplanetary war in four hundred years. The Shrike is on the planet Hyperion, on the outer edges of the Hegemony’s empire, almost under threat from the space-dwelling long-limbed Ousters who roam the area around the Hegemony, and this murderous armored scalpel-handed monster makes Arrakis’ sandworms seem cute by comparison. Fall of Hyperion picks up where Hyperion left off. The two books are more like halves of the same book than consecutive novels, and I haven’t read the other two books in the Hyperion Cantos yet. I don’t know if I want to—they take place hundreds of years after the events of the first two.\n\nHyperion isn’t an easy or light read. On top of that, it throws in the most horrifying, brutal death of any character in any book in any genre I have ever read, before the book is even half over. But it does that for a reason. Just, you know, be prepared.\n\nThe Hyperion Cantos echoes the warning from Dune “thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man’s mind.” It pulls in heavy inspiration from Neuromancer in creating the alternate reality of the Hegemony’s artificial intelligences. But after taking inspiration from Herbert and Gibson, Simmons brings something all his own.\n\nI don’t like religious imagery or allegory—I would rather books tackle religious questions head on. The Hyperion Cantos does this really well. Was the God of Abraham an immoral God? Can God demand the sacrifice of children? Why does God allow suffering? Why do humans think they deserve suffering? Why do humans worship vengeful gods? Can gods evolve? Would the ability to evolve make them less or more god-like? Do artificial intelligences have gods? If humans create AIs, and the AIs create a god-like ultimate intelligence, will that intelligence be obligated to its creators? Is the intersection of human and artificial intelligence in a “cybrid” similar to the intersection of the human and divine? Can a god empathize with mankind? Can humans achieve immortality without selling their immortal souls?\n\nSimmon’s characters grapple with all of these questions and more. As a non-believer, religious discourse is honestly about as foreign to me as life on Mars, but I really enjoyed the themes explored in the Hyperion Cantos, and I didn’t feel like my lack of religious background made it difficult for me to understand. I’m glad that Simmons didn’t discuss only one religion. His characters are Christians, Jews, Muslims and members of futuristic religions and cults.\n\nOf course, the Hyperion Cantos can’t answer all of the questions it raises. If it satisfactorily answered the question of why a benevolent god would allow suffering, then it would’ve won a lot more than the Hugo Award."
