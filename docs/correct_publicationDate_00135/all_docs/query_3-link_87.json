        "text": "I read Illium, and have got Olympos on my to-read list.\n\nLoved Illium. Its a very clever re-write of the Illiad, and also enjoyable even if you've never the original either. The pretext for the book is a little confusing, though I imagine it will become clearer in Olympos, about which I have heard only good things. Ainu has recently read Olympos, I believe, so will no doubt have something useful to contribute\n\nPurchased Illium and have it signed from when he was in town promoting it a couple of years back. Haven't read it yet though. He was an extremely friendly and down-to-earth guy.\n\nFunny you mention - Dan Simmons is coming to my local bookstore this Sunday for a book signing. I'll be there to hear him talk, and possibly get my Hyperion books signed. I've just read this series and I was really impressed. Most likely I'll purchase Olympos while I'm at it, so I'll have yet another book in my reading queue....\n\nI found Ilium very confusing to get my head around, especially at the start.\n\nIt wasn't well explained IMO what was going on. Was this a time traveller? What'shis motivations/reasons for going to this time period?\n\nA chapter of character/plot introduction would have been helpful to get me in the mindset. I felt a bit thrown into the story, rather than drawn into it.\n\nI much preferred other Trojan setting books I've read (Vengence of Orion by Ben Bova comes to mind). I haven't read the follow-up book, Olympos.\n\nI get easily put off when authors don't 'start' a story - merely carry on as if you've missed a chapter.\n\nEriksson gave me similar problems in Gardens of the Moon, and it really puts you off continuing to read the book when you aren't give time to 'settle in' to a story."
