(compared to other similar books I don't think this is the case)\n\nDid the change in writing styles prompt this decision?\n\nWas it to make the authors contract easier to fulfill?\n\nI'm particularly annoyed because there is absolutely no mention in the blurb of the book that if I wanted ANY kind of answers to the story I'd have to invest in the sequel, or even that the book is a two parter.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the books, imagine going to the cinema to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey and the film abruptly ends with the scientists staring at the monolith on the moon, or Rocky ends with his training and you'll have to go back to watch the fight.\n\nNow I appreciate that part of the strength of great storytelling is how a tale is told as much as where the story takes us but that's not really my point.\n\nI would appreciate it if any answers were supported by evidence rather than supposition."
