        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've just started reading Dan Simmons's \"Hyperion\". In researching the series (to see if the sequels were as good) I began reading the first sentence in the Amazon description of the third book in the series (Endymion). I'm wondering if, after having read that sentence, I have irreparably spoiled a significant part of the plot for myself. If you haven't read through the end of \"The Fall of Hyperion\" and don't want to see spoilers, STOP HERE.\n\nWhat I read was \"274 years after the fall of the WorldWeb in \"The Fall of Hyperion...\" I stopped after I realized what I was reading. So, is Hyperion worth reading now that I know that the WorldWeb eventually falls? (to whom or what, I have no idea at this point, I'm only 20 pages in to Hyperion) What about \"The Fall of Hyperion\"?\n\nThanks!\n\nShort answer. Yes!\n\nThe only way Endymion could seriously spoil the Hyperion novels for you is by Simmons retconning most of the explanations given in Fall of Hyperion. This is the reason why I have never read the Endymion series. Read Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion and leave well enough alone.\n\nThanks, Av! I'll stick to the Hyperion novels as you say. Just to clarify: I did get the sense from the sentence I quoted that I've at least become privy to the ultimate ending of Fall of Hyperion. The Amazon description that I foolishly started reading was setting up the blurb about Endymion by saying that it takes place \"274 years after the fall of the WorldWeb\", which it says took place in Fall of Hyperion. Knowing that the WorldWeb \"falls\" means I know (or at least have some knowledge about) the outcome of whatever conflict occurs in that book. From the reviews I've read, it seems that it doesn't matter much for reading Hyperion, as that book is focused on the people on the pilgrimage. But from the bit I've read about Fall of Hyperion, that book seems to be significantly more focused on the big war that is being foreshadowed in Hyperion. So you're saying that my knowledge that the WorldWeb eventually \"falls\" is not a big deal and I've not spoiled some masterkey in the plot?\n\nThanks again!\n\nShort answer. Yes!\n\nThe only way Endymion could seriously spoil the Hyperion novels for you is by Simmons retconning most of the explanations given in Fall of Hyperion. This is the reason why I have never read the Endymion series. Read Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion and leave well enough alone.\n\nJust genuinely curious here, but if you've never read the Endymion novels how can you be sure of the above?\n\nThe first one has style and serious atmosphere. It is just masterfully crafted, and somehow adds up to more than you could possibly expect from the outline of the plot. The second book is missing the style and atmosphere, and felt like a random sci-fi novel to me. It wasn't bad, and maybe it was even passably good, but it just isn't remotely comparable. I stopped there, disappointed, and knowing that the third and fourth books receive weaker reviews.\n\nHyperion, Fall of the Hyperion, and the Endymion books are ultimately, 2 different trains of thought. Both function as 2 part novel series. I liked the whole saga. Fall of the Hyperion, for my money is the best installment of the 4 books. I did read them all in order. Hyperion does not work without reading Fall of the Hyperion for me. It's essentially lots of heavy lifting in the character development department. Seems like an extended setup.\n\n*edit* typo -called it the Fall of the Endymion. That's not right!\n\nHi all, I just finished The Fall of Hyperion. I found it to be just as compelling as Hyperion. This is the book where most of the \"true plot\" takes place, with Hyperion being an extended (and brilliant) prologue. I will likely go through the Endymion books, though I think I'll do some other reading for a bit and let myself reflect on these first two novels."
