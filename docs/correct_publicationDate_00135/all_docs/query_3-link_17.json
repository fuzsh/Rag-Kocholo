        "text": "Hyperion by Dan Simmons is the first book in the 4 book series, Hyperion Cantos. It’s one of those sci-fi classics that is included in every single “Classic Sci-Fi Stories You Must Read” list along with things like Dune and Hitchhiker’s Guide. Because of that, I actually have read this book before, in 2015 according to goodreads. And it’s weird because it’s one of the few books I’d read that I didn’t really remember the plot of, I didn’t even remember whether I liked it or not, even though (weirdly enough), I still remembered all of the main characters’ names somehow.\n\nHyperion tells the story of a group of people who are going on a pilgrimage to this mysterious place called the Time Tombs, which is a monument centered around the mysterious creature known as The Shrike. On the way to the Tombs, they tell each other the stories of why they are there and how they are connected to the Shrike.\n\nMeanwhile, as this was happening, the Hegemony (which is like the biggest collection of humanity I guess) is kinda preparing for a war against the Ousters, a smaller faction of humanity that seceded from the Hegemony hundreds of years ago and is seen by the people of Hegemony as a group of barbarians.\n\nI feel like there are so many things about this book that I want to talk about, I had so many notes and bookmarked pages from this book. So here goes nothing…\n\nThe Structure\n\nThe first thing I want to touch on is the structure. Because of the premise, the story is often compared to Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, which I think is fair enough. Both stories are big stories containing smaller stories from many pilgrims who are on a pilgrimage to some sort of areligious site.\n\nBecause of this, I thought the way Hyperion is structured is very interesting, and it has both good things and bad things. I wanna mention two things about the structure that didn’t work for me, at least not to the extent the rest of the book did. And honestly, these might just be the only two things about the book that didn’t work, the rest are just phenomenal.\n\nOkay so, first, because of the way the book is structured:\n\npresent day story -> Main Character #1’s flashback -> present day story -> Main Character #2’s flashback and so on.\n\nThere isn’t really any momentum that drive the “main” story forward, most of the time, the main story is just not that engaging and feels like a distraction from the amazing flashbacks. Sometimes, some weird unexplainable thing happens (which is an extension of the style of worldbuilding) and like, sure it pushes the story forward, but other than that, it’s kinda bland.\n\nWhat’s not bland are the individual flashbacks, which I’ll get to later. And another thing about the structure that feels off to me is the way the book ends. I feel like it ended a bit too early. It felt like the ending lacks the necessary punch for it to be a satisfying ending.\n\nSimilar to how I felt when I was watching the penultimate episode of a season of my favorite show, but then realized that’s the end of the season because the final episode’s shooting was canceled because of COVID and will have to be rolled into the beginning of the next season.\n\nBut then again, with the lack of momentum and buildup before it, maybe it would’ve been weird if it ended more conventionally, I dunno, I’m just not the biggest fan of the momentum-less main plot and somewhat unsatisfying ending. But, honestly, these two things don’t really detract from my enjoyment much, probably because the things that the book did well, it did very well.\n\nThe Worldbuilding Style\n\nNext I want to delve a bit into the style of worldbuilding used in this book, because I think it’s interesting. So, at the beginning it almost felt like the worldbuilding style is similar to that of Malazan. And what I mean by this is that you are just dropped into the world straight away, then you get bombarded with terms and information without context, all of which has no meaning to you because you have no idea what they are and what their relationships with each other are.\n\nIt’s like you are shown a lot of meaningless dots with nothing you can use to connect them. And at first I didn’t like this, similar to how I didn’t like Malazan’s worldbuilding, it just doesn’t feel engaging to me, how am I supposed to care about a bunch of things I have no idea about?\n\nBut I think there’s a difference between this book and Malazan in that aspect, and that’s with the fact that in this book, you quickly get more and more information and context so you can more easily connect the dots (which also grew more meaningful overtime) that were just thrown at you at the beginning. I think Malazan did that too, but it just took so long, by that point I already gave up on the series entirely (though I might try again someday, who knows).\n\nHyperion hits the perfect balance of worldbuilding that I think is very difficult to get right. Sometimes you’d end up on one end of the spectrum like Malazan, and sometimes you’d end up with clunky expositional dumps on the other. While Hyperion is perfectly in the middle of that.\n\nEven though at first you barely know anything, it doesn’t take too long before you know enough about the world to be invested in it, and yet at the same time, nothing is over-explained so there are still gaps that you can fill in using your imagination, which I think is good.\n\nThe Character and Their Stories\n\nI don’t think I have any favorite character here, at all. And that’s a good thing because it means all of the main characters are about equally as compelling as the rest. What that means is that there isn’t really any boring flashbacks or anything like that. All of the flashbacks are really compelling in different ways (some are mystery, some are drama, some are romance, etc.) and it just shows how versatile of a writer Simmons is.\n\nWhich leads me to possibly my favorite aspect of the book, the one thing that ties all the flashbacks together, which is…\n\nThe Shrike and Everything Surrounding it\n\nSo, the Shrike is a ten-feet-tall, four-armed creature made out of sharp metal with big, blazing red eyes that can seemingly move without moving, just design-wise, it is very very cool. To add to that, I feel like I’ve seen and read so many science fiction stories where the final boss character is just characterized as being stronger than everyone else, to the point where it’s just kinda boring.\n\nTo some extent, The Shrike is exactly that, it is a creature more powerful than everyone else, but that’s barely scratching the surface of how interesting it is (yes, the Shrike’s pronoun is it/its). So, at the beginning, all we know about it is that it (and along with the Time Tombs) is something from the future that is constantly traveling backwards through time for some possibly nefarious purpose.\n\nThat in itself I think is a very interesting concept that I haven’t really seen explored elsewhere. But added on to that, is how it affects people all over the Hegemony. There’s an entire religion built around it, and the worldbuilding surrounding it (at least from what little we got) is very interesting and adds insight into how different people perceive it.\n\nBut while the societal impacts of the Shrike are fascinating, by far the most impressive thing is just how The Shrike affects the main characters individually. I just think that it is very impressive for the different stories to all be so vastly different and yet there is this one thing that left such a huge impact on everyone here. I think this part of the book is basically peak science fiction storytelling.\n\nYes, the main (or rather, present day) plot is a bit meh, but this is really the heart of the book anyway. The way these characters are affected by this incredibly unique world and everything in it. The way their stories arc and the characters themselves change in such a short amount of pages. The way Simmons uses such a wide range of science fiction tropes and elements to craft these amazing, compelling, emotional stories for these flawed, truly human characters. It’s all just so marvelous.\n\nPretty much all the stories here moved me, some more than the others, sure, but it’s an incredible achievement to be able to do all of that in such a (relatively) short story. So, individually, these stories are little masterpieces on their own, and collectively, they all help each other to paint a clear (but not too clear) picture of the Shrike, who is at this point just one of the most interesting characters I have ever read in any science fiction story.\n\nKeats\n\nOne final tangent I want to get into is the book’s overarching connection with the poet John Keats and his poem, Hyperion. It’s been a while since I read Keats’ Hyperion and studied about Keats, so I can’t say I fully grasped the extent of the connection between this book and the dead poet and his really long poem. But I have to say, I think it’s incorporated very well into the book, and the book literally cannot exist without the poem.\n\nWhile usually things that try to do this usually fails and gets preachy instead, but this book doesn’t do that. It just seems like Simmons has some interesting observations about Keats and/or the poem Hyperion, and he managed to make them an integral part of his own story. Also, the thought of a poem from the 1800s still affecting the world in like 1000 years (I don’t remember the exact timeline) is just very amusing to me and I’m glad this connection is here.\n\nConclusion"
