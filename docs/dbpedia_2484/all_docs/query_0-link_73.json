        "text": "The fashion business is nothing if not brand-dependent. And because preferences are so fickle, companies compete rigorously for customer attention and loyalty.\n\nOnce a brand is established, it must continue to innovate and promote, otherwise it risks the worst fate: fading from consumer consciousness. So the question of brand familiarity has huge marketing and financial implications, not to mention bragging rights.\n\nSince 1993, WWD has been tracking consumer awareness with surveys that reveal the most recognizable names in fashion among American consumers. The current poll is WWD’s eighth in the series, and, as in the past, brands are ranked against each other to select the top 100.\n\nTo conduct the national survey, WWD commissioned Synovate, an independent marketing research firm based in Tarrytown, N.Y.\n\nThe sample for the study was selected from the Synovate Consumer Opinion Panel to represent a cross section of women 18 to 64 with household incomes of $35,000 or more. It also broke out single women with household incomes of $75,000 or more and women from dual-income households with income over $100,000. Other demographic breakouts included girls 13 to 17, Hispanic women and African-American women.\n\nParticipants were sent an eight-page questionnaire containing 745 prelisted brands of apparel and accessories in 12 market segments, like sportswear, swimwear or accessories. Some brands were listed in more than one category.\n\nOf the 5,700 respondents selected, 2,384, or 42 percent, returned a completed questionnaire. The margin of error for the survey was 2 percent.\n\nRespondents were asked how familiar they are with each brand listed. The possible responses were “very familiar,” “somewhat familiar” or “not at all familiar.” The results are a straightforward list ranking brands based on the percent of women who said they were very familiar with each brand.\n\nThere are several brands that appeared on the prompt list in more than one category and had high awareness in more than one category. Brands are included only once in the overall WWD100. But in the top 10 lists by category, brands are listed in comparison to other labels in that category, based on their scores in that category only.\n\nThere were six ties, bringing the total number of brands listed in the top 100 to 106.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nAll volume figures listed are wholesale unless otherwise stated.\n\nHANES\n\nProduct: Hosiery, shapewear and hosiery-inspired ready-to-wear.\n\nVolume: $340 million (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.), Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nHanes has maintained its top spot on the WWD 100 survey for three years running, a testament to the brand’s vast distribution, widespread advertising and continuing emphasis on introducing innovations in legwear. The brand was founded over 100 years ago by John Wesley Hanes, who started making men’s socks in Winston-Salem, N.C. Hanes expanded into women’s socks in 1918 and by the mid-Sixties, the company was a major pioneer in seamless hosiery. Today, the company makes body-friendly tank tops, tummy-toning hosiery and enhancers that can be worn underneath jeans and capris. Last fall, it launched the Silk Reflections Luxury Collection of supersheer hosiery made from a new yarn blend that is designed to conform to the shape of the body.\n\nTIMEX\n\nProduct: Watches\n\nVolume: $600 million\n\nOwner: Timex Corp., Middlebury, Conn.\n\nTimex steered itself into haute territory this year through its partnership with Versace. The Italian fashion house and the all-American watchmaker unveiled their collaboration, called Vertime, at the 2005 Basel Watch Fair, in Basel, Switzerland. Timex projects sales of the Vertime to reach $17.9 million this year and expects to double its volume in 2006. The Versace deal, along with Timex’s release of its limited-edition, high-end XFactor collection, has helped to cement the company’s presence in fashion watches, which is in step with the company’s initiative to be more design-forward. Timex also plans to launch a series of national promotions this year to support the introduction of its Color Indiglo collection, which features illuminating, brightly colored night-lights.\n\nL’EGGS\n\nProduct: Hosiery and enhancewear.\n\nVolume: $370 million (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.), Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nLike other players in the legwear arena, L’eggs is no longer known just for its hosiery. These days, the brand has embraced avant-garde technologies, such as incorporating anticellulite treatments into a pair of pantyhose. It also has added luxurious touches like real lace edging on thigh-high stockings. The new Sheer Vitality Anti-Cellulite range, which launches this fall, is designed to help diminish fatty pockets on the body. And the L’eggs Lace Thigh High features waistband-free ease for top-selling stockkeeping units like Silken Mist and Sheer Energy.\n\nHANES HER WAY\n\nProduct: Full-figure and average-figure bras, sports bras, shapewear, daywear, underwear, casualwear, socks, shoes.\n\nVolume: $1.8 billion to $2 billion (est., excluding private label)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.) Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nHanes Her Way is one of the most powerful brands within Sara Lee Branded Apparel’s portfolio of blockbusters, which generates total wholesale annual revenues of $4.5 billion in the U.S. It is part of a spin-off strategy of turning Sara Lee’s branded apparel business into an independent, public company. Since 1986, Hanes Her Way has expanded its once-small line of panties by adding an innovative collection of seamless bras and shapers such as Hanes Her Way enhancers. Starting with spring 2005, Sara Lee changed the name of the brand to Hanes, for a more unified strategy. It has launched Hanes Perfect Panty and Hanes Authentic, which includes intimate apparel and sleepwear, and Body Creations, a line designed to show off curves. Hanes last month began a multimillion-dollar national print campaign for fall with actress-singer Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nNIKE\n\nProduct: Activewear, athletic footwear, accessories, sporting goods, personal electronics, retail.\n\nVolume: $13.7 billion\n\nOwner: Nike Inc., Beaverton, Ore.\n\nIt’s been a busy year at Nike, which held on to its fifth-place ranking for the third consecutive WWD100 survey. Co-founder and chief executive Phil Knight stepped down, and successor William D. Perez began as president and ceo last December. The brand has been building its global business, and now generates more than half its sales from international markets including Asia, Europe and South America. Nike continued to push into the women’s market with new initiatives, including the Fitness Dance Collection that launched this spring, and a women’s-only Nike catalogue. In a move that was welcomed by labor and human rights groups, the company disclosed its list of factories worldwide. The company also acquired Official Starter Properties to help facilitate its move into the discount channel and build its subsidiaries.\n\nLIZ CLAIBORNE\n\nProduct: Apparel, licensed dresses, innerwear, outerwear, footwear, sleepwear, children’s wear, swimwear, home.\n\nVolume: $1.4 billion (Claiborne brand)\n\nOwner: Liz Claiborne Inc., New York\n\nWhile the $4.6 billion Liz Claiborne Inc. now owns and operates 38 different brands ranging from Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand Jeans to Monet Jewelry and J.H. Collectibles, it’s still the core Liz Claiborne brand that’s the single biggest contributor to the company’s overall sales and profits. Products sold under the label accounted for 28 percent of revenues in 2004, and that’s not just clothes. Liz Claiborne is a true lifestyle brand, offering merchandise in more than 19 product categories including apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry and eyewear. Its home collection has been of major focus, with expansion beyond bedding and rugs. Today, that category is increasing to include home office products, bath furniture and home storage.\n\nCALVIN KLEIN\n\nProduct: Designer, bridge and better sportswear, underwear, jeans, fragrance, accessories, home, licensing, retail.\n\nVolume: $3.3 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., New York\n\nSince acquiring Calvin Klein Inc. in 2003, Phillips-Van Heusen has worked to integrate Calvin Klein into its operation. PVH successfully realigned the brand architecture of the three tiers — the designer tier Calvin Klein Collection, the ck Calvin Klein bridge label and the core Calvin Klein better-priced label. In 2004, Collection raked in $200 million in worldwide retail sales in all categories; ck Calvin Klein did $300 million, while the core Calvin Klein label rang up $2.8 billion. Fragrances have seen new momentum with the launches of Eternity Moment, Obsession Night and a new version of ck One. CKI is now embarking on an aggressive growth plan that could nearly double the brand’s retail sales in five to seven years. Among the plans are expanding into new divisions, such as Calvin Klein Casual and Choice Calvin Klein and global markets. In the past year, it opened flagships in Milan and Rome.\n\nVICTORIA’S SECRET\n\nProduct: Bras, panties, daywear, sleepwear, loungewear, robes, casualwear, shoes, dresses, fragrance, body care.\n\nVolume: $4.23 billion ($3.11 billion at retail; $1.1 billion catalogue and e-commerce)\n\nOwner: Limited Brands Inc., Columbus, Ohio\n\n“Sexy, Powerful, Glamorous, Innovative.” This slogan represents Victoria’s Secret, the leading specialty retailer of lingerie in America. It was acquired by Limited Brands in 1982 from its original founder, the late Roy Raymond. Limited chairman and ceo Leslie H. Wexner continues to keep the spotlight on Victoria’s Secret and its subbrand, Pink, which is being expanded after a successful fall launch throughout Victoria’s Secret’s 1,001 stores. Pink will emerge as its own store in 2006. With stores averaging sales-per-square-foot of $648 and a mail-order business reaching 403 million clients yearly, the key to Victoria’s Secret is personalized service and fashion product like bras by Very Sexy and the Body By Victoria collection. The highly publicized IPEX Bra is being marketed with this tag line: “The World’s Most Advanced Bra.”\n\nFRUIT OF THE LOOM\n\nProduct: Underwear, daywear, casualwear, T-shirts.\n\nVolume: $1.5 billion (est.)\n\nOwner: Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Omaha, Neb.\n\nIn 2002, Wall Street guru Warren Buffett bought Fruit of the Loom, a commodity-driven, unglamorous underwear company, for $835 million while the company was operating in bankruptcy protection. Since then, Fruit of the Loom has regained its status as one of the world’s largest makers and marketers of men’s, women’s and children’s underwear, as well as printed T-shirts for the activewear industry. Executives are known to be tight-lipped about the company’s business model and marketing strategies. But they did say there is a new back-to-school initiative that will tap into the heritage of its long-established Fruit of the Loom mascots, who have begun to appear in national print and TV ads. New underwear programs will include Fit for Me with the tag line “Underwear That Moves With You.” New styles are also being added for 2006.\n\nLEVI’S\n\nProduct: Jeanswear\n\nVolume: $2.9 billion (Levi’s brand)\n\nOwner: Levi Strauss & Co., San Francisco\n\nDespite posting its eighth consecutive year of sales declines, Levi Strauss & Co. returned to profitability in 2004. Sales of Levi’s held steady at $2.9 billion, representing 70.2 percent of corporate net sales. However, sales of the Levi’s brand in the U.S. fell 9.2 percent to $1.25 billion from $1.38 billion. Following year-end results, Phil Marineau, president and ceo, said paring down the company’s more than $2 billion in debt would remain a top priority. The sale of the company’s Dockers unit, announced in May 2004, was to be a key element in putting the focus back on the company’s core 152-year-old brand and would have reduced the company’s size by about a quarter. After six months on the block, Dockers failed to attract a high enough bidder and the sale was called off. The company will introduce Levi’s branded men’s and women’s underwear, daywear, sleepwear and loungewear for fall.\n\nOLD NAVY\n\nProduct: Value-oriented casual merchandise for men, women, children, maternity and plus-size.\n\nVolume: $6.7 billion\n\nOwner: Gap Inc., San Francisco\n\nIn 2004, this family-friendly, lower-priced division of Gap Inc. celebrated its 10-year anniversary, expanded its clothing for women by launching Old Navy Plus Sizes (sizes 16 to 26) in 50 stores initially, rolled out Old Navy Maternity to 160 stores and extended its reach in Canada by opening seven stores in Quebec. The brand is also dismantling its New York design team and relocating it to its San Francisco headquarters, citing “speed to market” with new product and proximity to senior staff members as the reasons. Old Navy, which has about 900 stores in North America, plans to add another 200 to the roster by 2007. First-quarter net sales for 2005 were $1.6 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2004.\n\nGAP\n\nProduct: Casual apparel for women, men and children, intimate apparel, maternity, body care, accessories.\n\nVolume: $7.2 billion (Gap brand)\n\nOwner: Gap Inc., San Francisco\n\nThis iconic retailer hit some bumps around 2000 that led to the highly publicized departure of chief executive Millard “Mickey” Drexler and the appointment in 2002 of former Disney executive Paul Pressler to that role. Efforts to regain its footing have been mixed. While the company increased net earnings 12 percent in 2004 and delivered healthy operating results, it has continued to struggle to find the right balance of fashion and basics. Former Gap brand president Gary Muto was reassigned as president of Forth & Towne, the new division aimed at women 35 and older. It is scheduled to launch this fall. Cynthia Harriss, formerly president of the Gap outlet division, stepped into Muto’s role in April. The Gap brand expanded its maternity line to more stores. There are 1,641 stores under the Gap banner in the U.S., U.K., Japan, France and Canada, and plans call for 60 more units by 2007.\n\nTOMMY HILFIGER\n\nProduct: Sportswear, jeanswear, athletic wear, children’s wear, accessories, fragrances, home furnishings.\n\nVolume: $1.8 billion\n\nOwner: Tommy Hilfiger Corp., Hong Kong\n\nTommy Hilfiger Corp.’s year has been mixed. Poor sales of its better-priced sportswear line, H Hilfiger, drove the maker to take it back in-house for repositioning. It will become a retail concept, with four H Hilfiger stores slated to bow by next February. Hilfiger himself launched a reality TV show, “The Cut,” on CBS. The year also brought two new fragrances, True Star Women and True Star Men. Perhaps its biggest news came with the acquisition of the Karl Lagerfeld brand. A capsule collection of Lagerfeld women’s and men’s wear will bow next spring, followed by a full rollout in fall 2006. In legal matters, the company is in talks with tax authorities in New York and New Jersey to settle issues regarding royalties for a subsidiary, Tommy Hilfiger Licensing Inc. There’s also an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office into Hilfiger’s buying office commissions.\n\nADIDAS\n\nProduct: Activewear, athletic footwear, accessories, sporting goods.\n\nVolume: $8.3 billion (total company volume)\n\nOwner: Adidas-Salomon AG, Herzogenaurach, Germany\n\nAdidas has stepped up its presence in the U.S. with a new 30,000-square-foot sport and performance flagship in Manhattan’s SoHo district. The German athletic giant continues to develop lines with designers and celebs, including a new activewear line with Stella McCartney that sold out in its first weeks at retail this spring. Its new Adidas 1 sneaker with a microchip is pushing the limits of technology in footwear. Adidas also recently announced plans to sell its Salomon division to Finnish sports equipment firm Amer Sports Corp. for $625.6 million to focus on its core Adidas brand. Adidas’ integrated marketing campaign based on the theme “Impossible Is Nothing” is continuing this year. The brand also opened more stores for its Originals division, to build its U.S. business. It is also building its golf division, and has been expanding its presence in areas such as Latin America and Asia.\n\nREEBOK\n\nProduct: Activewear, accessories, footwear.\n\nVolume: $3.8 billion (total company volume)\n\nOwner: Reebok International Ltd., Canton, Mass.\n\nWhile Reebok’s apparel business has been difficult the last few years, the company is beginning to see improvement in the category. Apparel sales grew 13 percent by the end of the first quarter this year, driven largely by licensed merchandise. The athletic company recently sold its Ralph Lauren footwear license back to Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. for $110 million to focus on its company-owned brands, which include Reebok, Greg Norman and Rockport. And while Reebok didn’t renew its five-year contract with tennis star Andy Roddick, the company has lined up such stars as Allen Iverson, Christina Ricci and John Leguizamo for its “I Am What I Am” campaign, which is the biggest marketing expenditure for Reebok in nearly a decade — a 30 percent increase over last year. The brand has also been building categories like running apparel and hockey and developing new performance footwear technology.\n\nLEE\n\nProduct: Jeanswear\n\nVolume: $1 billion (est.)\n\nOwner: VF Corp., Greensboro, N.C.; Lee headquarters, Merriam, Kan.\n\nExecutives from corporate parent VF Corp. weren’t overly concerned by a slight sales decline in the Lee business during a conference call with analysts in April. Mackey McDonald, VF’s chairman and chief executive, described the overall jeans market as “quite stable,” but acknowledged that sales of Lee in midtier stores like Sears, J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Mervyn’s were down slightly. Despite this, Lee ranked ninth among women’s jeans brands in a survey conducted by NPD Group and the Lee brand inched up two spots on the WWD100 from last year. In May, the 116-year-old company began testing e-tail waters, launching Lee1889.com to sell its junior apparel line. “Lee1889.com is our first e-commerce effort, but we don’t anticipate it being our last,” said Liz Cahill, director of advertising and public relations for Lee.\n\nPLAYTEX\n\nProduct: Full-support bras, average-figure bras, shapers, panties.\n\nVolume: $1 billion (est.)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.), Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nAcquired by Sara Lee in 1991, Playtex is another blowout brand that Sara Lee intends to spin off into a separate public company. As Sara Lee Branded Apparel’s chief executive officer put it, Playtex, along with the Hanes, Champion, Bali and Just My Size brands, have “tremendous brand equity and growth potential. We are confident we can accelerate our growth curve as an independent enterprise.” Another plus for Playtex is its distribution to diversified channels, from mass merchants to department stores. One successful idea took off for spring 2005: an ad campaign for the Playtex 18 Hour Bra, which stimulated consumer interaction with a tag line asking, “What would you do in 18 Hours?” Other hits include the introduction of the 18 Hour Comfort Lace with Airfoam bra launched last year, which has been “hugely successful,” according to Sara Lee executives.\n\nRALPH LAUREN\n\nProduct: Designer, bridge and better sportswear, jeans, fragrance, accessories, home, licensing, retail, media.\n\nVolume: $10 billion at retail (Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.’s net revenues for the year ended April 2, 2005 were $3.31 billion.)\n\nOwner: Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., New York\n\nRalph Lauren’s reach is expanding. In the last year, the firm launched Rugby, a retail concept aimed at 18- to 25-year-olds, with first stores in Boston, Chapel Hill, N.C., and Charlottesville, Va. This spring, it launched a high-end Black Label men’s line priced between its Purple Label and core Polo label. Last fall, it opened a massive Milan flagship as part of its strategy to add 20 stores globally each fiscal year. There are now 278 company-owned Ralph Lauren stores worldwide. The company hopes to make a strong push into luxury accessories, and in May bought its global footwear license from Reebok International for $110 million in cash. Polo also inked a four-year deal with the U.S. Tennis Association and is now the official apparel sponsor of the U.S. Open tennis tournament.\n\nNO NONSENSE\n\nProduct: Legwear\n\nVolume: $220 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Kayser-Roth Corp., an affiliate of the Golden Lady Group, Mantova, Italy\n\nNo Nonsense, with more than three decades in the business, is a pretty ubiquitous presence in food, drug and mass retailers with its line of women’s hosiery, tights and dress socks. This year, however, the company is making a bid to expand its customer base by introducing numerous product lines, including panties, sleepwear and sports socks. Among these is the Soft & Sensible collection of supersoft white socks and Super Breathables, which provide ventilation in socks. Also bowing this summer is the first-ever breathable control top pantyhose, which is considered a major innovation in hosiery. The brand is revitalizing itself with fresh packaging and displays, a revamped Web site and a new campaign that is being billed as “Real Good Stuff.”\n\nWRANGLER\n\nProduct: Jeanswear\n\nVolume: $1.9 billion (est.)\n\nOwner: VF Corp., Greensboro, N.C.\n\nIt’s been a quiet year on the denim front for Wrangler. By yearend, however, Wal-Mart, Target, J.C. Penney and Sears will have a Wrangler fragrance to complement the Wrangler jeans. In May, Western jean brand signed a licensing deal with Boom LLC for several Wrangler fragrances. First up is a signature men’s scent, with a women’s scent and home fragrances to follow. Wrangler cologne will launch in August and roll out to 15,000 stores by the end of the year. Wrangler continues to make headway in the premium jeans arena as well. At European denim shows in January, Wrangler introduced a subbrand called “BY,” which stands for “Blue and Yellow,” with targeted retail prices of around 120 euros, or about $156. The line fills the gap between core Wrangler jeans that sell for 90 euros, or $117, and its more premium Blue Bell line at 150 euros to 199 euros, or $195 to $260.\n\nGUESS\n\nProduct: Jeanswear, sportswear, accessories, licensing.\n\nVolume: $729.3 million\n\nOwner: Guess Inc., Los Angeles\n\nGuess continued to expand with the 2004 debut of its Marciano stores, a more upscale contemporary concept. The company opened five Marciano stores last year and introduced a Guess accessories concept store. Guess also completed a deal to purchase its European jeanswear license in 2005, and it hopes to add nearly $100 million in revenue for this year. The brand also signed a license with Marc Fisher LLC to develop, manufacture and distribute fashion footwear under the Guess brand. It will sell the footwear at its own stores as well as through other retailers. While it said that it was still experiencing challenges in the wholesale department, revenues for this category increased 9.4 percent. As of January 2005, Guess was carried in its own shops, totaling 157, and at over 940 other stores in the U.S.\n\nL.L. BEAN\n\nProduct: Outerwear, sportswear, children’s wear, travel gear, accessories, home furnishings.\n\nVolume: $1.3 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: L.L. Bean Inc., Freeport, Maine\n\nStill mostly a catalogue company with an online presence, L.L. Bean was founded in 1912 by Leon Leonwood Bean and is still owned by his descendants. The company’s headquarters remains in Freeport, Maine, where the original store still stands. Besides its regular catalogue offering, Bean also produces about 10 catalogues that specialize in categories like travel and fly-fishing. This year, it launched a women’s-only yoga and fitness catalogue featuring fleece jackets, Polartec pants, padded bike shorts, moisture-wicking tank tops, cropped yoga pants and hiking boots. “We think we are targeting an underserved customer,” said Fran Philip, Bean’s chief merchandising officer. “Our target customer is a 50-year-old woman Baby Boomer. She is well-educated and is definitely getting into wellness. Our goal is to offer a one-stop place for her to find apparel and footwear.”\n\nJOCKEY\n\nProduct: Underwear, sleepwear, loungewear, daywear, bras.\n\nVolume: $130 million to $140 million (est., women’s innerwear); $15 million to $20 million (licensing)\n\nOwner: Jockey International Inc., Kenosha, Wis.\n\nThought of as being a genuine, consistent and personal brand, the 129-year-old Jockey is famous for one reason — comfort. A privately held company, executives rarely reveal details of business and marketing strategies. But while the company continues to rely on the ongoing success of its basic underwear business, it also has embarked on two forward-thinking initiatives over the past year. First is applying for a patent for a new line of bras based on body-imaging technology, which company officials describe as providing enhanced comfort through engineered-fit cup design and shape. Second is the relaunch of the Jockey Bra Collection, based on an imaging research survey. The research analyzed “10,000 bodies, half of which were women, and captured about 200 different body measurements,” said Donna Hunter, Jockey’s vice president of women’s merchandising.\n\nNINE WEST\n\nProduct: Accessories, footwear, legwear, apparel.\n\nVolume: $1 billion, (40 percent of which is retail)\n\nOwner: Jones Apparel Group, Bristol, Pa.\n\nNine West’s fashion footwear business continues to boom, especially with the introduction and expansion of the higher-end Nine West Studio collection. But the sportswear business isn’t that far behind. This year, Nine West sportswear nearly doubled its door count to over 685 misses’ and more than 225 units for special sizes. Nine West luggage, launched in March, joins the brand’s extensive array of lifestyle categories, which, in addition to footwear, handbags and apparel, now includes jewelry, sunglasses, hats, outerwear, cold weather accessories, legwear, belts and eyewear. Next up, the company is planning the launch of a suit collection and a children’s footwear line. Nine West is sold in over 60 countries in Nine West specialty shops and department stores.\n\nDOCKERS\n\nProduct: Sportswear, accessories, outerwear, innerwear, hosiery, licensing.\n\nVolume: $764.2 million worldwide, fiscal 2004\n\nOwner: Levi Strauss & Co., San Francisco\n\nIn 2004, a steep revenue decline led parent company Levi Strauss to explore the possible sale of Dockers as a way to pay down a chunk of the corporation’s $2 billion debt. But ultimately, the brand remained at Levi’s. The company cited Dockers’ significant contribution to the company’s bottom line and cash flow, and said that it was unwilling to sell it at a bargain price simply to enhance shareholder value. Meanwhile, in May, Dockers tapped John Goodman as president of its U.S. business. Goodman was senior vice president and chief apparel officer since December 2003 at Kmart Holding Corp. Goodman replaced Bobbi Silten, who stepped down in June.\n\nGUCCI\n\nProduct: Luxury ready-to-wear, leather goods, accessories, cosmetics.\n\nVolume: $1.94 billion, or 1.59 billion euros at current exchange, Gucci division 2004 revenue\n\nOwner: PPR SA, Paris\n\nIf change fuels fashion, than Gucci has a full gas tank. In March, Gucci brass promoted accessories designer Frida Giannini to the post of creative director for women’s wear. She succeeded Alessandra Facchinetti, who held that position for a mere two seasons in Gucci’s post-Tom Ford era. Giannini, who is still overseeing the women’s and men’s accessories business, will show her first rtw collection in September. If her accessories are any indication of what’s in store, she might opt to revive archive designs like the horse bits and bright florals she worked into bags and shoes. This spring, the company outlined plans to expand its core accessories category with a new line of logo-embossed leather items dubbed “Guccissima.”\n\nSEIKO\n\nProduct: Watches, clock movements.\n\nVolume: $2 billion (worldwide, wholesale and retail)\n\nOwner: Seiko Corp., Tokyo\n\nSeiko prides itself on having invented the quartz watch as well as the Kinetic — a human-powered quartz watch — and continues to propel itself through innovation. After much success with the Arctura Kinetic Chronograph watch, which retails for $675 in stores like Zales, the company will launch two watches, the Sportura and the Spring Drive, in October. The Sportura will be a limited-edition, four-eye kinetic chronograph, of which only 200 will be available in the U.S. The Spring Drive is a mechanical watch featuring technology that was 28 years in the making; it delivers one second per day accuracy and a power reserve of 72 hours, among other features. Seiko’s women’s collection includes 17 new styles, featuring the company’s new diamond-setting technique, enabling the company to use larger, higher quality stones in its watches, which range from $375 to $695 at retail.\n\nEDDIE BAUER\n\nProduct: Outerwear, sportswear, accessories, home, travel gear.\n\nVolume: $1.2 billion\n\nOwner: Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc., Redmond, Wash.\n\nSince the first Eddie Bauer sporting goods store opened in Seattle in 1920, the company has been sticking to its roots while modernizing its merchandise. Today, there are more than 400 Eddie Bauer stores and about 95 million catalogues in distribution throughout the U.S. and Canada, and through joint venture partnerships in Germany and Japan. This year, the company has been working to expand its product categories, looking for licensing partners for textiles and garden and decorative accessories. In addition, this year has been one of restructuring internally, since the company’s official emergence from Chapter 11, under which it had been operating since March 2003 when it was owned by Spiegel. It recently hired Stephen Cirona, who joined the company as vice president of design. Cirona was an executive at Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nLANDS’ END\n\nProduct: Sportswear, outerwear, accessories, home.\n\nVolume: $1.6 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: Sears Holdings Corp., Hoffman Estates, Ill.\n\nEstablished in 1963, Lands’ End, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Holdings Corp., continues to be a sportswear leader as a direct merchant offered to customers through regular mailings of its catalogues and online at landsend.com. A selection of Lands’ End Best Sellers is also available exclusively at select Sears stores. Lands’ End offers clothing for women, men, children and infants, as well as home goods. Last March, Lands’ End was fully acquired by Sears Holdings Corp., the publicly traded parent of Kmart and Sears stores. Sears Holdings is now the nation’s third-largest broadline retailer, with approximately $55 billion in annual revenues and about 3,800 full-line and specialty stores through the U.S. and Canada.\n\nSPEEDO\n\nProduct: Swimwear, activewear, accessories.\n\nVolume: $1.2 billion (retail, worldwide)\n\nOwner: The Warnaco Group Inc., New York, under license for NorthAmerica from Speedo International Ltd., owned by Pentland plc, London\n\nWarnaco continues to make big moves to build the Speedo brand outside of swimwear. The company launched a national ad campaign for Axcelerate Engineered by Speedo, a fashion-forward activewear line, marking Speedo’s first consumer campaign in six years. Axcelerate began in activewear and will bow for fall into innerwear. It will launch for cruise 2006 in swimwear. Speedo Platinum, a big fashion launch for the brand last year, was discontinued, owing to a disappointing response from consumers, the company said. The brand is pumping up its offerings of technical apparel with an expanded line of triathlon products and racing styles. The company also recently named Sheree Waterson as president of Speedo North America, a new position, to help guide the brand’s development.\n\nROLEX\n\nProduct: Timepieces.\n\nVolume: $2 billion retail sales (est.)\n\nOwner: Wilsdorf Foundation, Geneva\n\nFounded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf, Rolex, which provides little financial information, remains one of the most coveted, recognizable and enduring symbols of status. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey, retailers said the brand was one of their top three performers, along with Cartier and Omega. The majority of retailers added that they expected Rolex to surpass Cartier as their best-selling brand. Lusty demand has led Rolex to be bullish about the future. Allen Brill, president and chief executive officer for the American division, said the company was on track for double-digit gains in the U.S. this year. Meanwhile, Rolex continues with its Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, which started in 2002. Designed to aid emerging talents in dance, literature, music, theater and the visual arts, the program teams budding talent with renowned artists in each field for a year.\n\nDISNEY\n\nProduct: Sportswear, activewear, footwear, sleepwear, accessories, toys, retail.\n\nVolume: $2.5 billion (consumer products, retail)\n\nOwner: The Walt Disney Co., Burbank, Calif.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Disney has high recognition. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom was, yet again, the world’s most visited theme park last year, with estimated attendance of more than 15.2 million. Disneyland, the second-most visited theme park, with 13.4 million people last year, is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and retailers were quick to cash in on the hoopla with exclusive products. Disney signed licensing deals with contemporary clothing lines such as the British line Religion and Toyko-based Hysteric Glamour to produce Tinkerbell T-shirts. The company partnered with Jem Sportswear for its Walt Disney Collection, feeding off retro mania with its worn and distressed T-shirts featuring Disney characters and with junior resource Mighty Fine for a Bambi Couture line. The company is also exploring a line based on ABC’s hit TV series “Desperate Housewives.” Disney owns ABC.\n\nNEW BALANCE\n\nProduct: Footwear, apparel, accessories, socks, exercise equipment.\n\nVolume: $1.5 billion\n\nOwner: New Balance Inc., Boston\n\nWhile best known for its footwear, New Balance has been expanding into new categories and has ramped up apparel, now produced in-house after having been licensed. The company recently named Nancy Coons general manager of apparel, a new position. This year, the apparel focus is on performance pieces with water-resistant and moisture-management properties. New Balance is also growing on the retail front, having opened 13 stores last year. The company operates 118 stores, and a new retail concept has begun rolling out. A recent ad campaign based on the theme “For Love or Money” encourages athletes to play for passion. New Balance has been adding licenses, and recently inked a deal for sports bags and watches. And after collaborating with equipment maker Warrior Lacrosse on a lacrosse shoe, New Balance acquired the company last year to build its business in new categories\n\nCHRISTIAN DIOR\n\nProduct: Couture, ready-to-wear, fragrances, cosmetics, accessories, jewelry.\n\nVolume: $740.1 million, or 595 million euros at current exchange, including sales of fashion and accessories\n\nOwner: Christian Dior SA, Paris\n\nThis year, the house of Christian Dior is celebrating the centenary of its founder’s birth. But while Dior is proud of its heritage, it is zooming into the future. It has set a goal to achieve 1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion at current exchange, in sales in fashion and accessories by 2007. (The perfume and fragrance business, integrated as part of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stable, already makes more than that.) With John Galliano creating blowout collections for women and Hedi Slimane building a strong men’s identity for Dior Homme, the house appears to be on the right path. Its operating income grew 25 percent to 50 million euros, or $60.5 million, in 2004, while sales rose 14 percent on a reported basis. On the retail front, the house expected to open about 20 units in 2005, adding to the 184 boutiques it ran at the end of 2004.\n\nLONDON FOG\n\nProduct: Rainwear, outerwear.\n\nVolume: $296 million\n\nOwner: London Fog Industries Inc., New York\n\nLondon Fog Industries has a new president and resolve. Its aim is to tighten and focus its fashion brands and stores to be more competitive and have broader mainstream appeal. In January, it named Len Abrams president. In this role, Abrams is focusing on sales and merchandising as well as overseeing the retail division and Homestead Fabrics, which it acquired in December for $100 million. Abrams is based in New York and reports to David Greenstein, chief executive officer of London Fog Industries, whose brands include London Fog, Pacific Trail, Black Dot, Moonstone, the Dockers licensed brand and the London Fog Factory Outlet Store division. London Fog’s fashion outreach includes expanded price points and a wider array of styles to attract new business.\n\nCHANEL\n\nProduct: Couture, ready-to-wear, fragrances, cosmetics, accessories, jewelry.\n\nVolume: $2.8 billion, or 2.3 billion euros wholesale at current exchange, combined fashion and fragrance sales\n\nOwner: The Wertheimer family, New York and Geneva\n\nWhen Karl Lagerfeld visited Tokyo last fall to fete the opening of Chanel’s largest store in the world, fans mobbed him. One woman was so moved she wept on his Dior Homme peacoat. Such emotional attachment to Chanel and Lagerfeld’s association with it has made it one of the world’s hottest fashion businesses. To wit: Bergdorf Goodman in May generated a record-setting $5.6 million in sales during a three-day Chanel trunk show. In beauty and fragrances, last year, a splashy ad campaign with Nicole Kidman fueled sales of its mythical, best-selling No.5 scent. Meanwhile, the house remains committed to couture and its rarefied craft. This spring, it purchased Robert Goossens, the Paris-based gold- and silversmith that had collaborated with Gabrielle Chanel from 1955 until her death in 1971. Chanel controls five other specialty ateliers, including Lesage embroidery and the Massaro cobbler.\n\nDANSKIN\n\nProduct: Dancewear, activewear, legwear.\n\nVolume: $211 million\n\nOwner: Danskin Inc., New York\n\nDanskin, which leaped more than 30 spots on this year’s list, might still be best known for dancewear, but the company has been aggressively building its activewear business, too. The company’s newest fitness apparel combines performance fabrics like Tactel and Supplex nylons with bright colors and fashion-forward styling and direction. Yoga apparel continues to be an area of growth, and Danskin is also building its stable of sports bras. The 123-year-old firm now has deals for exclusive Danskin lines with Target and Wal-Mart to increase its business in the fast-growing mass channel. Danskin is the sponsor of all-women mini triathlons and will sponsor eight races this year around the country. The series is Danskin’s largest marketing initiative, and the company sells its triathlon and other apparel on-site prior to the races.\n\nNAUTICA\n\nProduct: Men’s sportswear, outerwear and jeans, women’s sleepwear and swimwear, accessories,\n\nhome, fragrances.\n\nVolume: $550 million\n\nOwner: VF Corp., Greensboro, N.C.\n\nNautica still racks up strong brand recognition, even though it primarily sells men’s sportswear, home goods and fragrances, which it has been strengthening since it was acquired by VF Corp. two years ago. The company shut down its women’s jeans business last summer and women’s merchandise is restricted to two licenses, for swimwear and sleepwear. Nautica’s sole regular-priced freestanding unit, in New York’s Rockefeller Center, closed this year, though there is still a network of 115 outlets. The company named Denise Seegal president and ceo, replacing Nautica’s founder, David Chu. Seegal, who came from her post as president and ceo at Sweetface Fashion Co., is overseeing a master plan to strengthen the men’s business and to expand its presence throughout Europe.\n\nLIMITED\n\nProduct: Wear-to-work, casual apparel for young men and women.\n\nVolume: $577 million (Limited Stores)\n\nOwner: Limited Brands, Columbus, Ohio\n\nAfter a challenging 2004 marked by a 5 percent slide in comp-store sales, executives say turnaround efforts at Limited have been working. According to Leslie H. Wexner, Limited Brands chairman and chief executive officer, inventories are being tightly managed, the real estate portfolio is in the best shape in years and a profitable year is expected. Fashion improvements include an emphasis on sexy camis, modern pants and tiered skirts, and an overall more sophisticated approach to design and fashion. This fall, denim in five styles and three washes will be introduced to further establish the store as a destination for fashion pants. Speculation the division could be sold has been dismissed by Wexner. Jay Margolis, formerly president of Reebok, last January was named group president of apparel, including Limited and Express divisions, to help the turnaround.\n\nPOLO JEANS CO.\n\nProduct: Jeanswear\n\nVolume: $400 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Polo Ralph Lauren Corp., New York\n\nLicensed to Jones Apparel Group Inc., Polo Jeans Co. continues to give denim a new spin each year without forsaking the principal philosophy of Polo Ralph Lauren — youthful, authentic, American. This year, the company enhanced its denim assortment by offering several unique washes for jeans, as well as hand-tooling techniques. Staying at the forefront of denim trends, it also recently started a limited-edition program. This spring, the company offered one-of-a-kind hand-painted artisan denim as well as a limited-edition denim ballgown. Polo Jeans plans to continue this initiative. Among its marketing efforts, the brand holds interactive events nationwide where consumers can individualize their jeans with various trims, embellishments or embroidery.\n\nCONVERSE\n\nProduct: Athletic footwear, accessories.\n\nVolume: $220 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Nike Inc., Beaverton, Ore.\n\nAfter being acquired by Nike Inc. in 2003, Converse was rescued from its financial troubles and is now being revived and updated. Best known for its lace-up Chuck Taylor canvas style, it was founded in 1908. Under Nike’s direction, the brand has expanded with a wider selection of colors and more products for children. Recently, Converse has teamed up with Hurley, another brand owned by Nike, to create Hurley footwear for next spring. It is also launching extensions to the original Chuck Taylor this fall, including Premiere All Star, which is a streamlined, dressier version of the original shoe. Converse One, an online customization program that allows customers to design their own pair of Chucks, is another new initiative. And just in time for the summer blockbuster season, Converse inked a licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Consumer Products to release a limited-edition Batman Boot.\n\nJOE BOXER\n\nProduct: Underwear, loungewear, sleepwear, bedding, watches, accessories.\n\nVolume: $500 million to $600 million (est., worldwide retail)\n\nOwner: Windsong Allegiance Group LLC, Westport, Conn.\n\nThe brand, once as in-your-face as its ebullient founder, Nicholas Graham, and as eye-catching as its brilliant yellow smiley face, is still coasting on cachet amassed from public relations stunts years ago. Now sold exclusively at Kmart in the U.S., the retailer has scaled back Joe Boxer in recent years, including pulling out of most home decor. (One exception is bedding, which the brand still produces.) Will Joe get a chance to grow? Possibilities have emerged. Following Kmart’s merger with Sears, Joe Boxer potentially has access to 1,100 full-line Sears stores in the U.S. In Canada, the underwear brand is already sold in Sears. A Kmart spokesman kept mum on specifics, saying only that executives are “looking at crossbranding and evaluating those opportunities.” Joe Boxer’s parent company, Windsong, has begun using the brand’s Web site to sell the Joe Boxer K-O men’s and boys’ underwear.\n\nMAIDENFORM\n\nProduct: Full-figure and average-figure bras, panties, shapers.\n\nVolume: $300 million to $325 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund LLP, Los Angeles\n\nMaidenform, which turned 84 this year, might be considered the grande dame of the bra industry, but she hasn’t lost her youthful luster. Maidenform started out as Enid Frocks in 1930, was later renamed Maidenform Brassiere Co., and after years of battling retail and industry consolidation, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999 as Maidenform Inc. In May 2004, Maidenform was acquired by Ares Corporate Opportunities, a unit of Ares Management LLC, from Oaktree Capital Management and Maidenform shareholders for about $215 million. In April, Maidenform notified the Securities and Exchange Commission it would be filing for an initial public offering to raise $172.5 million. Part of Maidenform’s success has been the ability to reinvent itself with ideas such as a successful bra franchise called One Fabulous Fit. In May, it introduced The Dream Bra.\n\ncK CALVIN KLEIN\n\nProduct: Bridge sportswear, accessories, watches, fragrance, licensing, retail.\n\nVolume: $300 million (retail)\n\nOwner: Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., New York\n\nCK Calvin Klein is back. Shuttered in the U.S., Europe and the Mideast in spring 2001, the bridge apparel collection was relaunched in the U.S. at retail last holiday. The brand is licensed to G.A.V. and manufactured by Kellwood. In May, Calvin Klein Inc. signed a licensing deal with an affiliate of Italian manufacturer Fingen SpA to reintroduce cK Calvin Klein apparel and accessories in Europe and the Mideast. It plans more than 50 cK Calvin Klein boutiques over the next five years there — in addition to a growing Asian market. Currently, cK Calvin Klein products are distributed by Onward Kashiyama in Japan, and CKI has a deal with Club 21 for the brand in Southeast Asia, where 15 stores are slated by yearend. CKI executives expect the full cK Calvin Klein business, including licenses, to generate global retail sales between $420 million and $580 million over the next five to seven years.\n\nVANITY FAIR\n\nProduct: Bras, panties, daywear, shapers, sleepwear, robes.\n\nVolume: $120 million to $130 million (est.)\n\nOwner: VF Intimate Apparel Coalition, Alpharetta, Ga., a unit of VF Corp., Greensboro, N.C.\n\nThe Vanity Fair brand is the crown jewel of the Intimate Apparel Coalition of VF Corp. It’s a long-respected mainstay of intimate apparel areas at department stores nationwide. And it’s come a long way from 1911, when John E. Barbey created a resource for silk tricot lingerie that was later followed by the Vanity Fair Corp. in 1914. In 1968, Vanity Fair’s parent, VF Corp., was created. In VF’s 2004 annual report, Mackey McDonald, VF’s chief executive, noted, “Our Vanity Fair brand capitalized on its reputation for great style and fit with the launch of its Body Sleeks collection in 2004. Contributing to the success of the launch was our national print campaign that showcased our new, updated look and tagline, ‘Sense and Sensuality.'” The latest introduction is the 2005 Body Breathe Collection, which offers a line of antimicrobial bras.\n\nRAY-BAN\n\nProduct: Sunglasses and ophthalmic eyewear.\n\nVolume: $400 million (est., retail)\n\nOwner: Luxottica Group, SpA, Agordo, Italy\n\nThis American brand that dates to the Thirties is keeping its edge. This year, it built upon its classic Ray-Ban and aviator shapes with the introduction of updated variations, many of which highlighted fashion-forward colors like optical white, pastel green and candy pink. It also hired Italian Paolo Monico to direct a short film for its new “Change Your View” ad campaign. The campaign featured models climbing atop the buildings of Buenos Aires in the brand’s most stylish frames. Ray-Ban further supported its brand by working directly with Hollywood, providing the specs sported by Matthew McConaughey and Penélope Cruz in Paramount Pictures’ 2005 action flick “Sahara.”\n\nDKNY\n\nProduct: Bridge sportswear, accessories, jeans, fragrance, home, licensing, retail.\n\nVolume: $2 billion (est. retail for all Donna Karan brands; $1.7 billion est. retail for DKNY, including licenses)\n\nOwner: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Paris\n\nDKNY is in turnaround mode. Under the direction of president Mary Wang, the 17-year-old DKNY has reinstated some of its core values: It has improved quality and fit, using more luxurious materials and working with more upscale factories in Asia and Italy. As the average retail prices were raised from $50 to $200, the company minimized distribution with lower-tier retailers, which had hurt DKNY’s image. About 75 percent of DKNY’s wholesale business is through department stores, but the company is building its specialty store retail network. The brand is sold in about 300 stores worldwide, and the U.S. market represents about 45 percent of DKNY’s business. Categories include DKNY Active, DKNY Jeans, DKNY Juniors and City DKNY, all of which are licensed to Liz Claiborne Inc., as well as other licensed categories like watches, sunglasses, underwear and fragrances.\n\nTIMBERLAND\n\nProduct: Footwear, apparel, accessories.\n\nVolume: $1.56 billion\n\nOwner: The Timberland Co., Stratham, N.H.\n\nTimberland is on a roll, with apparel and accessories its biggest growth categories, followed by footwear. Company officials say they plan low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit gains in earnings per share in 2005. International sales are being fueled by Asian markets, especially Japan. Jeffrey Swartz, president and chief executive, has described the company’s Asian customer as a distinctly “younger and more fashion-forward.” The company has said that its principal strategic goal is to become the world’s authentic outdoor brand of choice. Timberland’s strategy also includes diversifying its footwear, especially the new Timberland PRO series of work boots for professionals, tapping into the trend for outdoor-inspired apparel. It plans to merchandise the styles prominently in stores and on its Web site and to extend the Timberland brand through licensing agreements.\n\nANNE KLEIN\n\nProduct: Bridge and better sportswear, accessories, retail, licensing.\n\nVolume: $500 million, including licensing\n\nOwner: Jones Apparel Group, New York\n\nJones Apparel Group bought Anne Klein in 2003 from Kasper ASL, and the parent is slowly but seriously working to rebuild the brand and reinstate its core value. At Anne Klein, which is often considered one of America’s most significant and storied labels, key themes of sophistication, wearability and the clothing’s significance to women’s lives now drive the collection. Jones has done away with Anne Klein runway shows and instead is investing in the business. In the past year, the company began to distribute to Nordstrom doors nationwide, while building its international business with department and specialty stores. It has also been strengthening its accessories, and opportunities include opening freestanding accessories stores globally. Jumping on the craze for vintage and capitalizing on its own archives, Anne Klein is in the midst of developing a collection of limited-edition vintage pieces.\n\nJORDACHE\n\nProduct: Jeanswear, licensing.\n\nVolume: $500 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Jordache Enterprises Inc., New York\n\nAs it closes out its 25th-anniversary year, Jordache is making headway in its campaign to recapture the popularity it enjoyed in the early Eighties. Jordache crept up eight spots from 57 in last year’s survey and recently introduced a premium line of jeans inspired by the classic Jordache look. An ad campaign shot by fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier and featuring Brittany Murphy will give a new look to the traditional horse head logo and should appeal to a retro-craving consumer. The ads will hit national publications beginning this fall and run through next spring. The brand has survived through the years by broadening beyond jeans. Jordache Enterprises Inc. controls labels such as Fubu Ladies and Kids, Gasoline and U.S. Polo Association. Jordache jeans are sold at more than 3,000 domestic Wal-Mart stores, and last year expanded to Wal-Mart stores in Canada, Mexico, China, Korea and Japan.\n\nABERCROMBIE & FITCH\n\nProduct: Apparel for teens, young adults, adults and kids.\n\nVolume: $2 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: Abercrombie & Fitch, New Albany, Ohio\n\nA&F took a new turn when Michael Jeffries became chief executive in 1992. He was hired by Leslie Wexner, Limited’s chairman, who liked his idea to bring sex and sizzle to the brand. The plan worked, and A&F was spun off from Limited Brands in 1999. The preppy, hip clothes are coveted by young adults, while A&F’s racy ads are reviled by their parents. The company has posted profit gains for 48 quarters, excluding a one-time charge last year. Jeffries’ plan now is to develop more age-specific brands. Within the past year, he launched Ruehl, a more expensive concept for those who’ve graduated from A&F. Already there’s an A&F kids’ line, and Hollister Co. for young teens. A fifth concept is in the works. Still, helming A&F hasn’t all been a smooth ride. The company was accused of racial discrimination in the workplace and paid about $50 million to settle three lawsuits last year.\n\nCHAMPION\n\nProduct: Activewear, innerwear, legwear, accessories.\n\nVolume: $500 million (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.), Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nChampion, best known for sweats and sports bras, is dealing with parent Sara Lee’s decision this spring to spin off its branded apparel division to focus on food, beverages and household products. The spin-off is expected to be completed between March and July 2006, resulting in the loss of about 350 jobs in Sara Lee’s branded apparel division, which includes Champion. The 86-year-old activewear stalwart is holding on, though. The company has partnered with Cotton Inc. to introduce “Double Dry Cotton,” an athleticwear technology cotton fabric that wicks away moisture. The fast-growing C9 by Champion activewear line, sold exclusively at Target, is leveraging the Champion name into new distribution segments.\n\nOP\n\nProduct: Sportswear, swimwear and accessories.\n\nVolume: $210 million\n\nOwner: The Warnaco Group Inc., New York\n\nAt 33 years old, Op is seeking to avoid the pitfalls of impending middle age. To stay young, the surf-inspired line, based in Irvine, Calif., is reinventing itself with the help of new owners Warnaco Group. Op wants to shift from a licensing company to the role of manufacturer. Also on the hunt for high-end consumers, Op is abandoning its three-pronged distribution strategy in favor of one aimed at the best stores with enhanced product launching for next spring. In the past, Op has had a tough time breaking into preferred retailers, who shied away from a company also selling to Mervyn’s and Kohl’s. But president Dick Baker, who helped orchestrate Op’s original comeback when he and investment firm Doyle & Boissiere purchased the foundering Op from Berkeley International Capital Corp. in 1998, is confident that the reengineering will take hold.\n\nARIZONA JEANS CO.\n\nProduct: Jeanswear.\n\nVolume: $1 billion (retail 2004)\n\nOwner: J.C. Penney Co. Inc., Plano, Tex.\n\nWith a blend of retro styling and fast-forward trends, the Arizona Jeans Co. private denim brand at J.C. Penney Co. is successfully chasing fickle 17-to-24-year-olds with streetwise and price-right jeans.

After being acquired by The Hanes Co. in 1970, which was renamed Sara Lee in 1985, Bali maintained its original design concept of flattering women with comfortable, figure-enhancing garments. Bali continues to be a leader in technology, producing luxury bras that fit and look beautiful. Last September, Bali launched its third Double Support Style, the Double Support Spa Closure bra. It became an instant hit at department stores and national chains as the seventh-best-selling bra style at department stores, according to NPDFashionworld data. This September, Bali will launch the latest in the Double Support series: the Double Support Lightly Lined Wire-Free bra, which features a proprietary Stretch Perfect lining for comfort and modesty.\n\nBULOVA\n\nProduct: Watches, clocks\n\nVolume: $167 million\n\nOwner: Loews Corp., New York\n\nBulova continues to expand its range with sport, fashion and casual offerings. More specifically, the company saw significantly increased sales for its Accutron, Wittnauer and Bulova brands, with Accutron’s sales increasing 30 percent. Bulova also became a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corp. in 2004, when the company bought back Bulova’s outstanding shares. Bulova also holds the license for Harley-Davidson watches. The company is celebrating its 130th anniversary this year. Bulova was founded by Bohemian immigrant Joseph Bulova in 1875 as a small jewelry shop in New York City.\n\nAMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS\n\nProduct: Casual apparel and accessories.\n\nVolume: $1.88 billion\n\nOwner: American Eagle Outfitters Inc., Warrendale, Pa.\n\nTeen retailers are having a great year so far, and this retailer of jeans, cargo pants, outerwear and graphic T-shirts is no exception. In the first quarter of 2005, American Eagle netted a same-store sales increase of 27.1 percent compared with the prior year. Roger Markfield, president, said he will step down next year and will transition to an advisory role to help the brand develop its new retail concept, which will hit the market with three to five test stores during fall 2006. Markfield will also develop other growth initiatives, as well as give counsel on the direction of the namesake brand. Susan McGalla, the company’s current chief merchandising officer, has been promoted to president of the American Eagle brand. In other news this year, American Eagle became the exclusive apparel sponsor of MTV’s “The Real World: Austin” series, which began airing in June.\n\nBILL BLASS\n\nProduct: Designer ready-to-wear, licensing.\n\nVolume: Collection: $20 million (est. wholesale); licensing: $750 million (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Bill Blass Ltd., New York\n\nChange is in the air at Bill Blass, including a possible sale of the company. In April, the firm reportedly was approached by a potential buyer and is said to be considering its options. Bill Blass continues to evolve under creative director and designer Michael Vollbracht, a longtime associate and friend of the late Bill Blass, who died in 2002. Vollbracht is taking the design direction back to the company’s roots of elegant, sophisticated and sporty styles with a feminine sensibility. First Lady Laura Bush was recently seen stopping by the Blass showroom in New York, and former first lady Barbara Bush is a long-time client. The Blass brand has been licensed in many categories, including women’s sportswear, suits, coats, fragrances, watches, swimwear, activewear, men’s wear, neckwear and home furnishings. The company is reexamining its licenses for a more cohesive licensing program.\n\nSWATCH\n\nProduct: Timepieces, jewelry.\n\nVolume: $500 million (est.)\n\nOwner: The Swatch Group Ltd., Biel, Switzerland\n\nBest known for its plastic watches, Swatch has been a mainstay in the industry, with edgy ads featuring funky designs. Swatch will open six stores by the end of this year in top retail locations, including Mall of America in Minneapolis, the Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, Grand Central Terminal in New York and Harbor Place in Baltimore, bringing the brand’s U.S. store count to 45. The Swatch Bijoux jewelry line has doubled in sales this year in the U.S. and now includes stainless steel styles with colored stones and moving parts for kaleidoscopic effects.\n\nCITIZEN\n\nProduct: Watches, printers, small electronics.\n\nVolume: $3.4 billion\n\nOwner: Citizen Watch Co. Ltd., Tokyo\n\nAlthough Citizen has always incorporated trends into its looks, it has gone a step further this year with the new Heart Charm bracelet watch and Lobella, a floral-inspired collection with Swarovski crystals. The company still promotes its Eco-Drive technology, featuring batteryless watches that are powered by light. A print and TV ad campaign features athletes such as skater Sasha Cohen, pro golfer Luke Donald and NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip. The company launched the Calibre 8651 with moon phase indicator, an expansion on its Calibre series launched this spring, and men’s titanium flight watches and 300M dive watches this year. Citizen has signed a new six-year marketing partnership with the U.S. Tennis Association for the U.S. Open and the U.S. Open Series. It remains a USTA Corporate Champion and a sponsor of events like the World Figure Skating Championships.\n\nESPRIT\n\nProduct: Sportswear, footwear, outerwear, accessories, swimwear, sleepwear.\n\nVolume: $3.5 billion (including licenses)\n\nOwner: Esprit Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong\n\nAsian powerhouse Esprit had just about disappeared from the U.S. market, but last year a 10,000-square-foot store opened in New York’s Flatiron District, and this spring the brand opened a shop in the Time Warner Center. Another location in SoHo is slated to open this year, and as five more stores opened last fall, there are currently seven stores in New York and New Jersey. Esprit’s EDC junior collection, which targets 15-to-25-year-olds and does about $300 million in annual sales in Europe, bowed in the States this year. In Esprit stores, about 25 percent of the selling space is devoted to EDC, which is priced about 5 to 10 percent cheaper than the Esprit collection. The company projects that about two dozen stores will be operating in the New York-New Jersey area by the end of 2005. Then, the company expects to start expanding to other parts of the country, including the West Coast.\n\nCASIO\n\nProduct: Watches, digital cameras, musical keyboards, consumer electronics.\n\nVolume: $5 billion, or 559 billion yen at current exchange (est.)\n\nOwner: Casio Computer Co. Ltd., Tokyo\n\nCasio’s lineup is long, running from calculators and keyboards to cellular phones (currently only available in Japan and Korea). The company launched a higher-end watch brand called Oceanus in May to expand into a better market. The brand’s watches use an Atomic Solar movement, making for what the company claims is perfect time, and retail from $400 to $700 at stores like Torneau. The company is expanding its popular Baby G line to an older demographic with its Sweet Poison line of watches and is partnering with sportswear company E.vil to create Baby E.vil, a limited-edition watch that will be exclusive to Federated Department Stores. One of Casio’s strongest categories, though, is digital cameras. In June, the S500 was launched in fashion colors of pumpkin, metallic gray and arctic white.\n\nCOLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR\n\nProduct: Outdoor-inspired apparel, accessories and footwear, licensing.\n\nVolume: $1.1 billion (net retail sales, 2004)\n\nOwner: Columbia Sportswear Co., Portland, Ore.\n\nColumbia Sportswear Co. posted record first-quarter results in March, reflecting the strong growth agenda at the 67-year-old company. Columbia, which went public in 1998, has licenses for products such as watches, socks, eyewear and, most recently, bicycles and bike accessories. Columbia also acquired Sorel and Mountain Hardware to expand its product offerings and its portfolio. Fiscal 2005 net sales are estimated to increase about 5 percent, said company officials. The brand leapt from 93rd place in last year’s survey, perhaps owing to the buzz from the recently published autobiography of company ceo Gertrude Boyle, who is 81. “One Tough Mother” (West Winds Press, $19.95) chronicles Boyle’s unlikely rise to the top of Columbia 35 years ago when her husband, Neal Boyle — the company’s founder, president and ceo — died of a heart attack.\n\nOSCAR DE LA RENTA\n\nProduct: Ready-to-wear, accessories, licensing.\n\nVolume: $100 million collection (est. wholesale) and $650 million licensing (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Oscar de la Renta Ltd., New York\n\nThere’s no slowing down at Oscar de la Renta, with plans to triple the company’s domestic and international volumes within the next three to five years, according to Alex Bolen, president and ceo. Last year, sales jumped 15 percent, and the company is on track to exceed that in 2005. Bolen’s plan includes building sales in existing retail accounts, playing up sportswear and accessories, staging at least 100 trunk shows a year and opening more freestanding stores. De la Renta has three stores, all opened within the last year. A 2,100-square-foot unit in Manhasset, N.Y., is slated to open next month, and the company is considering stores in Chicago, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Miami, Dallas, Costa Mesa, Calif., Madrid, Moscow, Paris and London. De la Renta’s Madison Avenue store in New York, opened last November, is already beating plan, with sales of $2,500 a square foot.\n\nGLORIA VANDERBILT\n\nProduct: Sportswear, jeanswear, handbags, footwear, swimwear, intimate apparel, watches.\n\nVolume: $400 million\n\nOwner: Jones Apparel Group, Bristol, Pa.\n\nGloria Vanderbilt is moving forward in the most fashionable way it knows how. The company made a major marketing move this year to launch a fall 2005 consumer ad campaign featuring a trio of fashion’s “It” girls — Kate Moss, Gisele Bündchen and Daria Werbowy. Besides attracting new customers, adding this marketing flash to the moderate label is a way of paying homage to the brand’s roots as a pioneer of designer denim in the Seventies. In 2006, lovers of the Gloria Vanderbilt brand can expect the introduction of higher-priced Gloria Vanderbilt Couture jeans, retailing from $120 to $150-plus. “Sometimes where you start is where you finish,” said Jack Gross, chief executive of Gloria Vanderbilt.\n\nANN TAYLOR\n\nProduct: Updated sportswear classics.\n\nVolume: $1.85 billion (retail, all divisions)\n\nOwner: Ann Taylor Stores Corp., New York\n\nComing off a disappointing 2004, Ann Taylor Corp. enacted a series of actions to turn around the Ann Taylor division, which has been a drag on the corporation, while the Ann Taylor Loft division continues to fly. Among the big changes, Kay Krill, who built Loft into a specialty powerhouse, officially becomes chief executive in October. As of June, Ann Taylor operated 771 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The women’s retailer has gone from one platform — Ann Taylor — to three: Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft and Ann Taylor Factory. Ann Taylor’s mission is to provide its customer with updated classics that are feminine, stylish, versatile and polished.\n\nL.A. GEAR\n\nProduct: Footwear, apparel, accessories, eyewear.\n\nVolume: $200 million\n\nOwner: ACI International, Los Angeles\n\nThe brand that was once beloved by aerobics-obsessed young girls, and by kids who adored the shoes with blinking lights that bowed in the Nineties, has joined Eighties comeback kids like LeTigre and Penguin in its resurrection efforts. Founded in 1979 by Robert Greenberg, now ceo of Skechers, the company peaked in the Eighties with sales of about $1 billion. In 2001, ACI International purchased the then-bankrupt brand, and the company has since been focusing on retro-chic footwear, licensing of footwear, apparel and watches. Kidfusion produces swimwear and apparel for kids, and Nouveau Eyewear does eyewear. Lavitt Mills will do hosiery, set to launch this holiday. The company also hopes to sign an apparel licensee this year, and it will launch its Springz technology for holiday. Last year, L.A. Gear began outfitting the Laker Girls.\n\nCOACH\n\nProduct: Handbags, luggage, small leather goods, footwear, scarves, watches and sunglasses.\n\nVolume: $1.7 billion (total global revenues, including wholesale and retail)\n\nOwner: Coach Inc., New York\n\nCoach is sizzling, and it shows in its 16-position leap this year in the WWD100. “The industry has been very strong,” said Andrea Shaw Resnick, vice president of investor relations. “The company has benefited from the increase in spending in the handbag and accessories category.” The firm, with sales up 29 percent, also has benefited from expanded distribution and an emphasis on luxurious product at more affordable prices. Coach recently opened a shop in Palm Desert, Calif., expanded its factory store at Woodbury Common in Central Valley, N.Y., and opened a flagship in Nagoya, Japan, for which the it sponsored a UNICEF tsunami benefit concert. As of April 2, Coach counted 186 full-price North American stores, 80 U.S. factory stores, 1,000 department store doors and 103 company-operated stores in Japan. New initiatives include an evening collection, more weekend styles and the “scribble” logo line.\n\nSAG HARBOR\n\nProduct: Sportswear, dresses, suits, accessories.\n\nVolume: $600 million, including licensing\n\nOwner: Kellwood Co., St. Louis\n\nIn the past year, Sag Harbor has been updating its product to make it more relevant and modern, said Stephen Ruzow, president of Kellwood Womenswear. Previously, the brand was known mostly for its wool and linen jackets, which garnered 80 to 90 percent of the label’s business. Today, 60 percent of sales are from sweaters. This year brings a new ceo for Sag Harbor, Paul Robb, who succeeds Martin Brody, a founder and ceo of the brand, who retired. Robb, a 30-year veteran of the apparel industry, was most recently president of Kellwood Menswear. Sag Harbor recently liscensed Accessory Network Group to produce career and casual hats. The line will bow this fall and will be designed, produced and marketed by ANG. This license is part of Kellwood’s plan to expand Sag Harbor into all major categories. The brand’s existing licenses include handbags, eyewear, footwear and slippers.\n\nLANE BRYANT\n\nProduct: Plus-size women’s wear.\n\nVolume: $974 million (2005 est. retail)\n\nOwner: Charming Shoppes Inc.\n\nMaking its WWD100 debut, Lane Bryant is America’s biggest plus-size retail chain, with nearly 750 stores in 46 states that cater to women ages 25 to 45 who wear sizes 14 to 28. It sells discreetly trendy apparel, accessories, hosiery and innerwear. Stores average about 6,000 square feet and continue to expand in malls and strip shopping centers across the U.S. The brand’s popular Web site continues to grow as well, as Lane Bryant successfully taps the fashion needs of plus-size women. In May, parent Charming Shoppes said it would pay $218 million for Crosstown Traders Inc., a catalogue company based in Tucson, Ariz., so that it can launch a Lane Bryant catalogue division by 2007. Crosstown Traders is owned by JPMorgan Partners, a private-equity division of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Last year, Crosstown Traders sold $460 million worth of women’s apparel, footwear and gifts.\n\nBANANA REPUBLIC\n\nProduct: Men’s and women’s apparel.\n\nVolume: $2 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: Gap Inc., San Francisco\n\nFor much of its existence, Banana Republic was known as a safari and travel outfitter, and then, the career-oriented sibling of Gap. That began to change last year when Banana upped its fashion quotient and staged a runway show for its fall collection. Banana has ventured to esoteric spots for inspiration, including “Brideshead Revisited” for fall, which featured chunky knit cardigans with floaty florals. To spread the word about its renewed fashion focus, Banana Republic became a lead sponsor of last season’s “Project Runway” reality series on Bravo. The company is segmenting its business and expects to have five freestanding petite units open by the end of the year. Banana also is building its international business. In August, four stores are expected to open in Quebec and three will be unveiled in Tokyo in the fall. Banana’s domestic store count totals 450.\n\nWONDERBRA\n\nProduct: Bras, panties.\n\nVolume: $200 million (est.)\n\nOwner: Sara Lee Branded Apparel (a unit of Sara Lee Corp.), Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\nWonderbra celebrated its 10th anniversary in the U.S. in 2004 by unveiling its new face, Maja, as well as its multimillion-dollar ad campaign at an event that literally stopped traffic in Times Square. Wonderbra continues to build on the momentum created during its introduction in 1994, when Wonderbras were delivered to department stores in armored Brinks trucks and helicopters. Now, the brand has taken on a quieter, more sophisticated image with styling and marketing that has more of a global appeal. The Extravagance Collection introduced last year is being expanded with several key introductions: In November, Extravagance II will launch its richly embroidered push-up bra, the new Strapless Wonder. June saw the debut of a design called Sultry Stripes, lightly lined bras rendered in men’s wear-inspired pinstripes.\n\nLooney TUNES/WARNER BROS.\n\nProduct: Character-driven apparel, accessories, home products, footwear, toys.\n\nVolume: $6 billion (global retail for consumer products)\n\nOwner: Time Warner Inc.\n\nLike many other entertainment marketers, Warner Bros. Consumer Products is working to revive its franchises, especially Looney Tunes, to rekindle interest among adults as well as to court a new generation of kids. Among its characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Tweety Bird, the canary takes the spotlight. Going higher-end, a Tweety collection bowed in May at Kitson in Los Angeles and Scoop, including Swarovski crystal-detailed cashmere sweaters by Cake Couture and Delman ballet slippers. A new Tweety girl-centric publishing program is slated to launch next year. This year, Looney Tunes and DC Comics, also a Warner Bros. property, signed on with cashmere sweater maker Raw 7 for a line of upscale knits. Brad Globe, the division’s executive vice president and general manager, will succeed founder Dan Romanelli, who will step down as president in July 2006.\n\nEXPRESS\n\nProduct: Wear-to-work and casualwear for young men and women.\n\nVolume: $1.91 billion (retail)\n\nOwner: Limited Brands, Columbus, Ohio\n\nExpress, with more than 800 stores, slipped in the WWD rankings to 70 this year from 50 last year, reflecting fashion misses’, color and fit issues and a tough year. In 2004, comparable-store sales fell 8 percent, and in the first quarter of 2005, comps fell 21 percent, with casual bottoms having particular difficulty. Markdowns have been higher recently. However, the division remains a mainstay in malls and expects improvements by the fall. Hopes lie in a new management structure that established ex-Reebok president Jay Margolis as group president of apparel, including Express and The Limited. There’s been speculation that Limited’s apparel businesses are up for sale so the company could focus on the more successful lingerie, beauty and personal care businesses, but top officials have flatly denied any such intentions.\n\nGIORGIO ARMANI\n\nProduct: Designer ready-to-wear, leather goods, accessories, cosmetics.\n\nVolume: $1.56 billion, or 1.30 billion euros at current exchange, consolidated 2004 revenue, including sales through directly owned stores, franchisees and royalties.\n\nOwner: Giorgio Armani SpA\n\nWhether he’s expanding into new markets like China or branching into new ventures like hotels, Giorgio Armani is always on the move. In the last year, the company opened 16 directly operated stores and renovated another 20. In May, Giorgio Armani and EMAAR Hotels & Resorts finalized their pact to create hotels and resorts bearing the designer’s name and stylistic imprint. EMAAR will invest $1 billion to open seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts over the next decade. The first two are slated for Dubai and Milan. Late last year, the designer invited the public to a massive fashion show in New York, a testament to his desire to reach an even broader clientele. Armani is also pushing its accessories and home furnishings businesses to generate more revenue.\n\nPUMA\n\nProduct: Athletic footwear, apparel, accessories.\n\nVolume: $1.99 billion\n\nOwner: Puma AG, Herzogenaurach, Germany\n\nPuma is taking a number of steps to expand its business, particularly in lifestyle apparel. The brand recently opened its first store designed to showcase its collaborative fashion collections in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, and similar stores are planned for other American cities. Among the labels showcased are 96 Hours, designed by Neil Barrett, and Nuala by Christy Turlington. “We’re always intertwining sport, lifestyle and fashion into our brand,” said Puma U.S. president Jay Piccola. The German sport-fashion company also recently announced a footwear collaboration with designer Alexander McQueen that will bow during London Fashion Week this September. In a bid to strengthen its business on the West Coast, Puma also plans to open a 3,500-square-foot corporate showroom at the California Market Center in Los Angeles.\n\nCANDIE’S\n\nProduct: Footwear, apparel, accessories, fragrances.\n\nVolume: $350 million (2004 retail for Candie’s and Bongo)\n\nOwner: Candie’s Inc., New York\n\nCandie’s successfully completed its mission of becoming a licensing and marketing company this year, and will finish the year with a new name. On July 1, the company changed its name to the Iconix Brand Group Inc. Last year, the firm bought Badgley Mischka from Escada USA. It also announced a deal with Kohl’s, under which, by January 2007, Candie’s brand footwear, handbags and apparel will be sold exclusively at Kohl’s, which has 670 doors in 40 states. The company licenses the Candie’s, Bongo and Badgley Mischka trademarks for footwear, apparel and other fashion products. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Brightstar Footwear, arranges for the manufacture of private label footwear for mass and discount retailers. Hilary Duff was added to the list of celebrities, including Kelly Osbourne, Ashanti and Kelly Clarkson, to be the face of Candie’s for its fall ad campaign.\n\nFOSSIL\n\nProduct: Watches, accessories.\n\nVolume: $960 million\n\nOwner: Fossil Inc., Richardson, Tex.\n\nFossil continues to expand and grow through numerous acquisitions. With DKNY and Burberry on the company’s roster of high-end licensees, Fossil has also signed a deal with Marc Jacobs for men’s and women’s fine and fashion watches to be produced under the Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs labels, respectively. This deal follows Fossil’s acquisition of Michele, a fine watch company, as well as its license with Michael Michael Kors. The company makes watches for many other fashion companies, including Emporio Armani and Diesel. Besides its fine jewelry, Fossil also introduced a Palm OS wristwatch this year. On the corporate side, Harold Brooks was named president of Fossil’s fashion watch division in late 2004, succeeding Richard Gundy.\n\nTOTES-ISOTONER\n\nProduct: Umbrellas, rainwear, rubber rain boots, gloves, slippers.\n\nVolume: $250 million\n\nOwner: Totes-Isotoner Corp., Cincinnati\n\nThis is a company that likes a rainy day, as sales of its umbrellas continue to remain strong. To freshen its umbrella assortment, Totes-Isotoner this year introduced the Auto Brella, part of its Brella franchise that features a four-section construction to reduce its size when not in use, a casing clip to attach the Brella to the outside of a bag and an automatic open-and-close feature. The Auto Brella is offered in a number of colors and prints to enhance its positioning as a utilitarian as well as a fashion item. The company is seeing success with its pillow step slipper, reporting a 50 percent increase in sales, fueled in part by the introduction of a microterry fabric this spring. Totes-Isotoner, which was formed in 1997 through a merger of the Totes and Isotoner brands, is distributed in mass-market chains like Kmart; Wal-Mart, where it will soon expand distribution, and, starting this fall, Target.\n\nKENNETH COLE\n\nProduct: Shoes, women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, eyewear, other accessories, children’s wear, fragrance.\n\nVolume: $516 million (wholesale and retail)\n\nOwner: Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc., New York\n\nKenneth Cole is in the process of elevating the anchor Kenneth Cole New York label in fabric, styling and price, positioning it for contemporary sportswear departments. The firm is also expanding its Kenneth Cole Reaction brand, having inked a licensing deal in June with Bernard Chaus for Reaction women’s sportswear. Other Reaction categories are shoes, bags, eyewear, fragrance and outerwear. The company recently opened boutiques in El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. In the Middle East, it already operates stores in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait City, and there are plans for a Tel Aviv unit this fall. In October, it will open an accessories-only store in Thailand. Asia, particularly China, presents a key growth opportunity, with plans for full lifestyle stores in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Taipei.\n\nCHEROKEE\n\nProduct: Licensed men’s, women’s, kids’ wear.\n\nVolume: $2.4 billion\n\nOwner: Cherokee Inc., Van Nuys, Calif.\n\nCherokee’s run as a licensed brand has generated healthy retail volume, but hasn’t hit the $3 billion target predicted by president Howard Siegel two years ago. After Cherokee’s conversion into a licensing company in 1995, it signed a deal with Target in 1997 for exclusive distribution rights in the U.S. But brand competition and changes in Cherokee’s store placement have dented sales, which fell by 4.9 percent to $1.8 billion at Target in fiscal 2005. Although Target elected to renew the deal last February through Jan. 31, 2007, the licensor isn’t taking chances. Cherokee expects international markets to drive growth, including expansions with Tesco in the U.K. In the meantime, its parent company has had a busy year, signing deals with Sears and Latina magazine for misses’ products, and with Essence magazine. Cherokee might be looking to align itself with a buyer, with Tesco said to be a leading candidate.\n\nFREDERICK’S OF HOLLYWOOD\n\nProduct: Bras, panties, daywear, sleepwear, dresses, fragrance, cosmetics, bath and body products.\n\nVolume: $200 million\n\nOwner: Mellon HBV Alternative Strategies LLC and Tokarz Investments, New York\n\nIn 1946, Frederick Mellinger, founder of Frederick’s of Hollywood, had one purpose: to design sexy lingerie “that could make a woman feel beautiful from the inside out.” As one of the leading trendsetters in lingerie retailing, with 150 stores, part of Frederick’s of Hollywood’s claim to fame is the new definition it has given to sexy lingerie, with provocative push-up and front-hook bras, colorful fashion bustiers and crotchless panties. Frederick’s also prides itself with the “Rio-style” thong, which is the specialty retailer’s top-performing thong, selling at a rate of 40,000 per week. The newest initiative is to relocate the Hollywood flagship, which, after 60 years, will be moved from near Hollywood and Cahuenga Boulevards to a building at Hollywood and Highland Avenue, near Grauman’s Chinese Theatre and the Kodak Theatre, home of the Academy Awards.\n\nDONNA KARAN\n\nProduct: Designer ready-to-wear, accessories, fragrance, home, licensing, retail.\n\nVolume: $2 billion (est. retail, including Donna Karan New York, DKNY and licenses; $300 million, est., for Donna Karan Collection)\n\nOwner: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Paris.\n\nDonna Karan’s last few collections should silence any critics who had claimed the designer had turned her back on the core Karan woman. Karan is back in top form, and her fall collection, called Manhattan Rush, was full of men’s wear details and ultrafeminine draping. Karan’s current work also should please top brass at parent LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which bought Donna Karan International in 2000. LVMH has had to deny rumors that it was looking to offload DKI for its supposed weak performance, where in fact things seem to be on the rise. In March, the company rehired Carole Kerner, who had left DKI in 2002 for Abercrombie & Fitch, as president of the Donna Karan New York collection. Karan is also aggressively building her accessories assortment.\n\nSWISS ARMY\n\nProduct: Watches, apparel, multifunctional tools and cutlery.\n\nVolume: $150 million (est., excluding licenses)\n\nOwner: Victorinox AG, Ibach-Schwyz, Switzerland; Swiss Army headquarters: Shelton, Conn.\n\nExpanding way beyond its signature pocketknives, Swiss Army has significantly stepped up its apparel and accessories offerings for both men and women. In fact, 40 percent of the company’s sales are generated from watches alone. Keeping in step, Swiss Army recently unveiled the ST 5000, a navigation watch with a built-in lighting system and directional compass. On the technology front, the Victorinox SwissMemory and SwissMemory Flight multitools, which serve primarily as portable data storage devices, were updated this year. In terms of expansion, Victorinox opened a store in Tokyo this year that will sell items from the Swiss Army product lines. David McTague was named president of global apparel, wholesale and retail, a new post.\n\nJONES NEW YORK\n\nProduct: Sportswear, outerwear, eyewear, innerwear, accessories.\n\nVolume: $1 billion\n\nOwner: Jones Apparel Group, Bristol, Pa.\n\nAlready with tons of real estate in department stores, the main focus for Jones New York has been to bring the brand to life on the selling floor with special events that help the customer build her wardrobe and polish her personal style. Some of these events include “JNY Style” with style guru Lloyd Boston and “Signature Style” with lifestyle experts like interior designer Michael Moloney, who teaches shoppers how to carry their style into their home decor. The year also brought the debut of Jones New York Sport in denim. Hitting retail this fall, the line features fashionable treatments with a fit for Baby Boomers. Also looking into more charitable activities, Jones New York has created the Jones New York in the Classroom initiative, supporting teachers and students by raising funds and awareness for nonprofit organizations dedicated to teachers. The program launches in October.\n\nPIERRE CARDIN\n\nProduct: Couture, ready-to-wear, fragrances, cosmetics, accessories, licensed products.\n\nVolume: Beauty and fragrance, about $100 million (est.). All other Cardin-branded goods: $1.5 billion (est. retail)\n\nOwner: Pierre Cardin, Paris\n\nThe 83-year-old maverick couturier continues to shop around his business. He says he’s been offered as much as 500 million euros, $607 million at current exchange, for his far-flung tangle of some 800 licensed products. But he continues to hold out for more money. “I know what I’m worth,” he told WWD this spring. In any case, Cardin is keeping himself busy. This spring, he organized an exhibition of his furniture designs in Paris, and in the summer he opened a restaurant in his Espace Cardin to spotlight a recently launched line of Italian products under his Maxim’s label. A new fragrance, Pierre Cardin for Women, was expected to ring up sales of $2 million in its first year. Still, few know the details of Cardin’s financial situation, especially since he insists on running all of the business himself. A handful of recent reports suggested Cardin was heavily in debt, a scenario he firmly denies.\n\nLIMITED TOO\n\nProduct: Tween fashion and accessories.\n\nVolume: $686 million\n\nOwner: Too Inc., New Albany, Ohio\n\nLimited Too became an independent company in 1999 in a spin-off to shareholders of Limited Brands. The company, now called Too Inc., sells jeans, tops, jewelry, hair accessories, T-shirts, wallets, backpacks, and swimwear targeting tween girls ages seven to 14. It also operates Justice, a chain with budget-priced apparel, accessories, hats, belts, socks and lifestyle items for girls in the same age group. Too competes with Wet Seal and Abercrombie & Fitch, but skews younger and eschews those chains’ emphasis on sex, opting instead for cute styles and girly accessories such as initial pillows and Furreal Friends stuffed animal toys. Too’s net sales in the first quarter ended April 30 rose 7 percent to $164.4 million. Too operates 575 stores in 46 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nSPALDING\n\nProduct: Sporting goods, apparel, accessories.\n\nVolume: $400 million (including licensing)\n\nOwner: Russell Corp., Atlanta\n\nSpalding, the iconic basketball and sports brand, is being revived and revamped. New owner Russell Corp. said recently it is seeking to build Spalding into a billion-dollar megabrand. While many of its categories are licensed, Russell is now going to be making Spalding apparel and footwear in-house, and it plans to upgrade the image of the brand as well as the quality of the products. The world’s largest supplier of basketball equipment has been growing internationally, and non-U.S. sales account for about half of its total volume. Spalding also plans to launch a marketing campaign and step up its presence in sporting goods stores, said Scott Creelman, president. He added that the company is targeting such sports as football, volleyball and baseball for additional growth.\n\nLOUIS VUITTON\n\nProduct: Ready-to-wear, accessories, jewelry.\n\nVolume: $3.72 billion (est.), or 3.06 billion euros at current exchange\n\nOwner: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Paris\n\nThe crown jewel in Bernard Arnault’s LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, Louis Vuitton remains on the upward curve. And Arnault thinks the brand still has plenty of “extremely strong” growth potential in the cards. To wit: Long waiting lists are the norm for products such as the new denim handbags. Under the savvy style guidance of designer Marc Jacobs, the brand undoubtedly is hot. Many of the monogrammed leather goods customized with smiling cherries by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami sold out this spring. New products are also a priority, including jewelry and watches. Building on its watch offering, Vuitton introduced the Speedy in January. The brand’s goal is to have watches contribute 5 percent of Vuitton’s sales in five years.\n\nTIFFANY & CO.\n\nProduct: Jewelry, watches, tabletop items, giftware and other accessories.\n\nVolume: $2.2 billion\n\nOwner: Tiffany & Co., New York\n\nThe 168-year-old jeweler is continuing in expansion mode. In the last year, it opened five boutiques in the U.S., plus stores in Brisbane, Australia; Shanghai; Marunouchi in Tokyo, and Osaka, Japan. Three more U.S. stores are expected to open in the coming year, upping Tiffany’s total count to about 150 in 17 countries. The firm introduced its pearl-focused Iridesse specialty chain in The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and Tysons Galleria in McLean, Va. Two more Iridesse shops will open in the next year. The company remains primarily a destination for diamonds. This year, Tiffany & Co. built on its diamond presentation with the introduction of the Atlas collection of 18-karat white gold and diamond pieces, 18-karat yellow gold and sterling silver. Earnings for the year have risen 41 percent, aided by a gain from the sale of its equity stake in the Aber Diamond Corp.\n\nGIVENCHY\n\nProduct: Couture, ready-to-wear, accessories, fragrances, cosmetics.\n\nVolume: $450 million (est.)\n\nOwner: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Paris\n\nThis spring, Givenchy tapped Riccardo Tisci as its fifth women’s wear designer in 10 years, hoping the relatively obscure Italian would finally give direction to what has been a topsy-turvy image. As part of his three-year contract, Tisci agreed to shutter his own Milan-based signature collection to focus on Givenchy. But the question remains: Will he be able to build on the house’s Audrey Hepburn heritage, while finding a relevant contemporary voice? Tisci showed a promising couture collection for the LVMH-owned house at a show in Paris this month. Meanwhile, the house turned to British sartorial whiz Ozwald Boatang to boost its men’s wear division. It is expanding its beauty offerings: In May, it introduced Very Irresistible Givenchy for Men, a follow-up to the Very Irresistible Givenchy women’s scent it launched in 2003. Industry sources estimated it could generate $70 million in first-year retail sales.\n\nB.U.M. EQUIPMENT\n\nProduct: Licensed active and casual apparel, sleepwear, footwear, outerwear, hosiery, watches, accessories.\n\nVolume: $620 million (retail)\n\nOwner: SOS Management LLC, Mendham, N.J.\n\nB.U.M. spent the first half of 2005 reembracing the Eighties look that spurred its popularity. In February, the licensing firm launched a “Things you miss” ad campaign, featuring contemporary people in retro settings — eating at a drive-in, hula-hooping and roller skating on the boardwalk. It was the first ad campaign under B.U.M.’s new executive team, SOS Management, which bought B.U.M. in December 2002. Stephen Wayne, chairman and director of licensing, said the timing was right to go retro, given the resurgence in popularity of brands like Lacoste and Le Tigre. A second flight of ads, shot in Hilton Head, S.C., will soon hit the pages of such magazines as Seventeen, Cosmopolitan and American Idol. The company will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2006.\n\nMUDD\n\nProduct: Jeanswear, accessories, swimwear.\n\nVolume: $500 million, including licensing\n\nOwner: Mudd USA LLC, New York\n\nA survey conducted by market research firm NPD Group ranked Mudd sixth among the top women’s jeans brands of 2004, beating out prominent names like American Eagle, Gloria Vanderbilt and Abercrombie & Fitch. Mudd will take its first steps toward expanding beyond its core juniors market this fall with the introduction of Piama, a line targeting 21- to 25-year-olds. Named after chief executive and company founder Dick Gilbert’s daughter, Piama will feature stretch denim made from ring-spun cottons in Mexico and intricate pocket stitching. The line will retail between $88 and $94 — just under the unofficial $100 premium denim boundary — and is expected to generate approximately $5 million in first-year sales. The company is also preparing to launch Red Mukk, its first men’s line. Mudd stores are next on deck, with plans for three in the U.S. and more than 50 in Asia.\n\nIZOD\n\nProduct: Sportswear, jeans, intimates, swimwear, children’s wear, golf apparel, accessories.\n\nVolume: $625 million (retail)\n\nOwner: Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., New York\n\nIt may have established itself as a men’s line, but Izod is now clearly just as much a women’s brand, too. With the help of Kellwood Co., which holds the license for Izod sportswear, the line has been doing well and continues to sell its staple polo shirts at a fast pace. “We are clear on our key items, but we realize there is a need for these items to be updated each season,” said Suzanne Karkus, president of Kellwood’s Izod Womenswear division. “After a year of having the denim in stores, we realized we didn’t need to overhaul the fit, but we did need to update our washes. Same with the polos. We didn’t need to change the slim fit, but we did need to look at special buttons, new trims, embroideries to keep the customers interested.” Under the ownership of Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., which also owns the Calvin Klein business, Kenneth Wyse, president of licensing for PVH, believes Izod’s women’s business will eclipse the men’s.\n\nCHLOE\n\nProduct: Ready-to-wear, accessories, fragrances.\n\nVolume: $303.8 million (est.), or 250 million euros, wholesale, including licensed products\n\nOwner: Compagnie Financière Richemont, Switzerland\n\nWith Phoebe Philo in the design cockpit, the Paris house of Chloé has hit a groove. Philo has delivered a streak of winning collections comprising cool, “It”-girl clothes, and Chloé’s parent, Compagnie Financiere Richemont, has pledged to build on her success by investing “tens of millions of euros” to expand the brand. Besides more than doubling the communication and advertising budget, the house’s plans include moving into costume and fine jewelry, watches, lingerie and baby apparel. The fragrance business and Chloé’s diffusion line are also to be rejuvenated. Retail expansion is another priority, with a raft of new addresses — including Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo, as well as a larger Paris store — slated to open in the second half.\n\nPERRY ELLIS\n\nProduct: Men’s and boy’s wear, fragrances, women’s licensed product, licensing.\n\nVolume: $656.6 million\n\nOwner: Perry Ellis International, Miami\n\nThe year can at best be described as tumultuous for Perry Ellis International. In spring 2004, the company relaunched its women’s sportswear in a license with Public Clothing Co. The collection, designed by women’s wear creative director Patrick Robinson, was met with much praise, but the designer and his bosses clashed over his vision for the house: Robinson saw it as a contemporary collection, while the company wanted a better-priced line. Robinson quit in November and the women’s sportswear venture was put on ice. It remains to be seen if the company ever plans to venture into the area again. For now, Perry Ellis is luckier in men’s, which continues to grow.\n\nFOSTER GRANT\n\nProduct: Sunglasses, reading glasses, optical frames.\n\nVolume: $300 million (est.)\n\nOwner: FGX International, Smithfield, R.I.\n\nAAi.FosterGrant Inc. recently changed its name to FGX International to better reflect its acquisitions of the Magnavision, Gargoyles, Anarchy and Angel brands, as well as the sunglass licenses for Ironman, Champion, Body Glove, Levi Strauss and Club Med. The 76-year-old Foster Grant brand, however, continues to be the company’s cornerstone and workhorse. It maintains a 30 percent share of the mass market sunglass business in the U.S. and a 20 percent share of lower-priced sales overseas, according to FGX chairman and chief executive John R. Ranelli. This year, Foster Grant opened a new showroom at 390 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. It also is working toward a relaunch next spring of its “Who’s behind those Foster Grants?” ad campaign.\n\nCAPEZIO\n\nProduct: Dancewear, footwear, legwear, skatewear, accessories.\n\nVolume: $75 million\n\nOwner: Capezio/Balletmakers, Totowa, N.J.\n\nCapezio, the iconic dance brand, is best known for functional offerings like leotards, tights and performance shorts but has made recent moves into the fashion and lifestyle arena. It recently launched its Red Label division, featuring sophisticated design elements and premium fabrics. Capezio’s Mandara collection of yoga products is also set to launch at retail this fall. Capezio has been stepping up its performance footwear designed for ballet, jazz and tap dancing, as well as fashion-forward messenger bags and dance bags for kids. Salvatore Capezio founded the company in 1887 in Manhattan; his family still runs the company today.\n\nVERA WANG\n\nProduct: Bridal, ready-to-wear, fragrance, fine jewelry, china, crystal, silver flatware, eyewear, footwear.\n\nVolume: $300 million (est. retail), of which about $200 million is generated by licensing\n\nOwner: Vera Wang Ltd., New York\n\nVera Wang is known for her upscale bridal, ready-to-wear, sportswear and fragrances, but the brand is found on a medley of products, including new licenses for fine jewelry, lingerie and dresses. Three overseas bridal shops are opening, and the company is considering a diffusion sportswear line. Wang’s Madison Avenue store in New York generates $15 million in annual retail sales, and the company is considering a rollout plan that might include markets such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Bridal accounts for 40 percent of the $100 million apparel business, ready-to-w"
