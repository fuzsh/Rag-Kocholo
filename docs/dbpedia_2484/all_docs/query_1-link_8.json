        "meta_description": "Heer im Focus is a series of publications compiled by a team of renowned experts on the German Army. The aim of this series is to focus on those battles, vehicles, equipment and soldiers neglected by the literature until now. As with the Luftwaffe im Focus and U-Boot im Focus series, thorough research will take precedence over speed of publication. You will read accounts from us that are described in a completely different way elsewhere. Trust our articles, we get to the bottom of the issues. This is exactly what we are about, researching the history of the German Army in a way that you will not find elsewhere. It should also be noted that we will cover all the forces that saw action on land. This includes Luftwaffe units such as paratroopers, Luftwaffe field divisions and anti-aircraft units. For the illustrations, we will make use of unique original Agfa Colour slides from private collections as well as photographs which have never been shown before and which illustrate the events in a completely different light. But this publication is not intended just for historians and army enthusiasts. Modelers will get their money's worth too, as the series will be excellent reference source for the construction of accurate models (profile drawings and B/W + colour photos). Diorama makers will also find it a useful reference. The new series thus differs from other publications that also deal with this subject. The editions will vary in size depending on the articles they contain. This means that there will be no uniform price. Price will be based on the size of each issue. However, no issue will exceed the price of 28.80 euros. Heer im Focus will be published at irregular intervals. In each edition you will find about 60 to 80 unpublished photographs from private collections with detailed captions in German and English as well as articles on special Army topics. Each volume will contain articles drawn from the following list of topics: • Tanks in Focus • Holders of the Knight’s Cross • Wehrmacht Vehicles • Photos with a Story • Documents • Unknown Emblems • Camouflage Schemes • Emblems • Sign Jungles • Fates • Background • Motorcycles • Camouflage • Scenery • Propaganda Companies • Parachute Troops • Weaponry • Combat Reports The illustrations will be printed in the highest quality on glossy paper. A publication for those interested in history and for modelers.",
