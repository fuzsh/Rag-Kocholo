        "text": "Joseph Michael Bauer\n\n“Joe”\n\n01/16/1954 - 03/03/2024\n\nIt is with great sorrow that we announce the passing of Joseph Michael Bauer, of Westbury NY. Joseph or ‘Joe’ as most of you knew him, was born in Evanston, IL to Kathleen & Robert Bauer; who later moved to Merrick, NY to raise their family. Out of seven kids, although Joe was the second oldest, he was often seen as a figure of guidance for his younger siblings. Joe is survived by his loving wife of nearly 35 years, Christine, his two daughters Katie & Gabrielle, his mother Kathleen, and his three siblings: Jennifer, John, & Dan Bauer.\n\nJoe Bauer served in the U.S. Air Force, and after receiving his honorable discharge, he began a career in aviation; working his way up (& following his father’s footsteps) to become the Chief Flight Engineer of Atlas Air. Something his family was and will always be extremely proud of him for. He was somewhat of a wild card in his earlier years, riding his motorcycle through Europe, running marathons, traveling with his Wife Christine while he worked for Pan Am Airlines, visiting his sister Jeanne in the Florida Keys, building rockets with his youngest daughter Gabrielle, and sharing a love of praying mantises and insects with his oldest daughter, Katie. Joe had an extensive love for exploring the world, he traveled to over 30 different countries and had a heightened interest in outer space, as it was his dream to one day make it to the moon.\n\nMost of you knew Joe as a kind, humble, and patient person, who was always willing to share a funny story or some friendly advice. Over the years he was a good friend to all, and was always there when you needed him. To say we will miss him incredibly would be an understatement, and we are forever grateful for the 70 long years he was on this earth.\n\n“Heaven is goodbye for ever, it's time for me to go\n\nI was born under a wandrin' star\n\nA wandrin' wandrin' star”\n\n-Wand’rin’ Star by Lee Marvin"
