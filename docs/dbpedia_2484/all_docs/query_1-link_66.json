        "text": "Pyrbaum, Germany – With the summer transfer window in full swing, several of our last season Pro IFX players in Germany were taken on soccer trials with higher division German soccer clubs. One of our latest success stories is that of Tyriq Umrani. After Umrani's first season in Germany bearing the Gutenstetten jersey in the Bezirksliga and fast adaptation to the German soccer game, the native of Columbia successfully transfers to SV Seligenporten to play in the Landesliga Bayern Nordost for the upcoming season 2022-23. This puts Umrani on a solid trajectory into the top German semi-professional soccer divisions.\n\nTyriq's success in Gutenstetten, becoming an integral part of the team as a regular starter and showing his dangerous offensive ability, attracted “Die Klosterer” as part of their rebuilding process after Gerd Klaus’ departure as the Head Coach. In addition to adding Umrani for the new campaign, SVS management has signed several newcomers and built a solid roster under former pro player and new SVS Head Coach Bernd Rosinger.\n\nLed by interim coach Michael Görlitz and Bernd Rosinger, Die Klosterer had their first tests playing friendly matches against various soccer German clubs such as BSC Woffenbach e.V. (from the Bezirksliga) where Tyriq contributed scoring 2 goals (49’ 70’) with a final score of 7:0. Other successful results were against Altenfurt (0:12) playing away and facing Kareth Lappersdorf (4:2) last weekend in a home game. The winning streak was interrupted when they had to face recent promoter into Regionalliga SpVgg Ansbach. It was a tough test since “monks” had to face some ex professional soccer players and they were defeated 6:0 in a match that exposed defensive line.\n\nWe at IFX Soccer are happy to see Tyriq’s soccer development in Germany. Tyriq's creative and effective abilities on the pitch will be critical to his success this coming season. IFX will continue supporting Tyriq as an education / soccer agency in Nürnberg, where Tyriq and other Pro IFX players live in our fully furnished apartments in Nürnberg, study German language at our partner language school and compete with a German football club while supplementing with our IFX training sessions at our soccer academy in Fürth.\n\nIf you want to open doors in German soccer or you dreamed to play soccer abroad, let’s talk about your next step to achieve a career in soccer +1 510-599-4625!"
