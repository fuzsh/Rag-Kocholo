        "text": "Michael R. Bauer was born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, and later relocated to Athens, Georgia, where he went on to receive his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Georgia in 2006. After graduating, Michael attended John Marshall Law School, where he received his J.D. in 2009. While in law school, he was highly involved with Moot Court and worked tirelessly to hone his advocacy skills, while also serving as a research assistant to his Constitutional Law Professor. As a result of his efforts, Michael placed first in his 1L Intra-school Moot Court Competition and was a member of the first Moot Court team from his law school to advance to the semi-final round at the Georgia Intrastate Competition.\n\nAfter law school, Michael began his legal career working as a Special Prosecutor at the DeKalb County District Attorney’s Office. He then branched out into private practice and started his own law firm, with a focus on advising clients on estate planning and probate matters. At the same time, Michael continued to sharpen his advocacy skills by working alongside a consumer defense firm to represent a host of clients in cases involving abusive and unlawful collection activity, unfair business practices, and wrongful foreclosure. Michael also spent several years serving as an Adjunct Professor of Advocacy at John Marshall Law School, where he (among other things) led workshops on appellate brief writing for the Moot Court competition teams and spearheaded an advanced legal writing workshop that was offered to the entire student body. Michael has spent the last five years of his practice working with a law firm in Cartersville, Georgia, focusing primarily on personal injury litigation, while also overseeing the firm’s general civil litigation and probate administration and litigation divisions.\n\nADMISSIONS\n\nGeorgia State Bar, 2009\n\nSupreme Court of Georgia, 2009\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, 2010\n\nEDUCATION"
