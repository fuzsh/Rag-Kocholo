        "text": "In Loving Memory of Todd Michael Bauer Jr. (TJ) – November 19, 2023\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the sudden passing of our beloved TJ, a bright and loving 14-year-old who brought so much joy and laughter into our lives. TJ was taken from us far too soon, leaving behind a void that can never be filled.\n\nBorn on August 14, 2009, TJ was a cherished son, brother and friend. He was a remarkable individual, known for his unwavering passion for football and his deep love for farming; his dream was to live and work on a farm. When Todd’s life ended tragically last week, he took those dreams with him.\n\nLeaving behind to mourn and forever miss him is his Grandmother Barbara Primeau of Champlain and Latham, NY whom he lived with most of his life, Father Todd Bauer Sr. of Averill Park, NY, his additional parents Michael and Lisa Maynard of Schaghticoke NY, and siblings Eric M. Bauer (Lindsey), Cassie P. Bauer and Emily E. Bauer. He is also survived by his Aunt Michelle Rathbone (Andrew) and Uncles Michael Bauer (Sharon) and Scott Bauer (Cheri) along with his godfather Jason Bauer (Sam), Great Aunts Elizabeth Murphy, Brenda Premo and Great Uncle Raymond (Barbara), Larry and Diane Wolff, devoted friend and mentor Scott Decker, many cousins and the Maynard’s.\n\nHe was predeceased by aunt Marilyn Bauer and great aunt Bernice Primeau, great uncle Ronald Premo, uncles Eric and Jason Coker and his cousin Jaydn Bauer.\n\nTodd was a student at Northeastern Clinton CSD (NCCS) high school. He enjoyed being outdoors whether it was doing yard work, working on the farm, fishing, riding four wheelers or just tromping through the woods. TJ loved to work and would volunteer to help with jobs most kids would shy away from; he even helped his Uncle Rick build a fence for his farm. TJ developed a profound respect for hard work. He was just the most helpful boy; no job was too big for him.\n\nTJ had a deep love for his family, and cherished the time they would spend together. He loved to play practical jokes, games like backgammon, family trivial pursuit and card games. TJ loved to go to work with his father and ride in the dump trucks. His passion and love for football was evident and anyone who knew him knew how much he loved the Giants. TJ lived with his grandmother, his smile lit up her life and his loss will be immeasurable to her. TJ was loved and cherished by many and he returned that tenfold.\n\nA gathering to honor TJ’s life for friends and family will be held on Tuesday November 28, 2023 from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm with a service beginning at 1:00 pm the Wynantskill Funeral Home, 294 Whiteview Road, Wynantskill, NY 12198. In lieu of flowers, our family kindly requests donations to be made to The American Farmland Trust https://farmland.org/donate/ or the Wounded Warrior Project https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/donate, as he deeply cherished his time on the farm and felt moved to donate to the wounded warriors himself.\n\nAs we say our goodbyes to TJ, let us remember the light he brought into our lives. May his passion and kindness inspire us all to embrace the things we love and to live each day to the fullest. Rest in peace, dear TJ. You will forever be in our hearts. With immense love and sorrow, Todd’s loving family. Please visit www.wynantskillfh.com."
