        "text": "After some really strong showings during the time he has spent under the supervision of our IFX Ballistic coaches, Zaky is set to try out for the latest franchise to play in the NASL, the San Francisco Deltas. A San Francisco boy through and through even though he was born in Egypt, Zaky has improved himself considerably over the years. After playing Under 14 and Under 16 football for the Egyptian national team, he went to the City College of San Francisco, leading their team to the national championship. Following a one-year sojourn with the Southern Polytechnic University where the soccer team lost the semifinal of the conference, he transferred to the University of Texas where he helped the team to an undefeated record of 24-0.\n\nAs someone who literally lives, eats and sleeps the game in every sense of the word, Zaky is a player to watch out for and we’re confident that following some really promising signs during his time at the IFX Ballistic Amateur team from Pleasanton, CA, this amazing footballer with seemingly endless potential is bound to impress the coaches of the NASL franchise."
