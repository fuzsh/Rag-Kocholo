        "text": "This summarizes the opportunity that outdoor brands have to span their reach to the fashion conscious consumers: ‚ÄúIn this industry, if you can make a credible, functional product that is accepted by the fashion consumer you couldn‚Äôt be in a better spot.‚Äù As one that spends a fair amount of time challenging the limits of my own outdoor gear, the ability to wear it more often rationalizes the high price point in costs per use.\n\nChampion is one of America's original sportswear brands, and it has experienced moments of enviable popularity during its history spanning over a century. With its origins in college sports uniforms back in the 1920s, the brand claims to have invented the hoodie and the sports bra. It even manufactured the official jerseys of NBA players, as well as for NFL and US Olympic teams. In the late 80s to early 90s, a series of hip-hop artists began wearing Champion garments, blurring the lines between sportswear and streetwear. It was then that the brand gained mainstream status and became incredibly popular amongst everyday consumers. By the early 2000s, however, big name brands such as Nike, Adidas and New Balance began to saturate the market. These juggernauts gained popularity due to their sneakers, and stole the hearts and budgets of those who had previously favoured Champion. Today, HanesBrands‚Äîthe parent company of Champion‚Äîis considering selling Champion \"to ensure HanesBrands is best positioned to grow and create value for shareholders.\" Learn more about Champion's rise and fall in a recent article by Jennifer Ortakles Dawkins, published on Business Insider, via the link below. https://lnkd.in/gNfFVFJB At YOZO, we're driven by a passion for small business.

At $1.092 billion, the #footwear firm‚Äôs second-quarter revenue was up 25% and easily beat the consensus forecast of $961 million.

JD Sports is a British company that's one of the biggest sports retailers in the world, but has a much less dominant presence in America. JD already owns Finish Line & Shoe Palace but the new acquisition gives JD 1,169 new Hibbett owned stores across the US, which pits them directly against rivals like Foot Locker and Dick's. Sneaker retail has constantly been looked down as a flailing market. While brands like Foot Locker and JD Sports have struggled over recent years, there will still be a place for physical retail stores and the current industry trends might lead to more competitiveness between these companies. https://lnkd.in/dpMJZKyp #retail #footwear #sneakers #shoes #jdsports #fashion\n\nLast week, Authentic Brands Group has agreed to acquire the Champion brand from Hanesbrands Inc. for over $1 billion ü§ë This acquisition marks a notable expansion in ABG's already impressive portfolio, which includes prominent names like Reebok, Vince, Eddie Bauer, Brooks Brothers, and Forever 21. Champion has a rich history, and it's interesting to see how it got to this next step! Champion, a brand synonymous with athletic apparel, has a history that traces back to its start in 1919 when it was established as Knickerbocker Knitting Company in Rochester, New York. Over the decades, Champion has carved out a formidable reputation in the sportswear industry, not only catering to sports teams but also serving as supplier for the US Military. Some notable achievements include.... üß• They invented the hoodie in the 1930s ü™° Created a new type of shirt with shrink-resistant tech called Reverse Weave in 1938 ü¶∫ Introduced mesh jerseys for football athletes in 1967 üëô Created the first sports bra, called the the Jogbra¬Æ This move is also significant in the broader context of the apparel industry's dynamics, where heritage brands are increasingly seen as valuable assets that offer stability and a loyal customer base. As ABG continues to build its empire, integrating Champion's distinctive identity and extensive reach will likely serve as a catalyst for future expansions and collaborations. https://lnkd.in/e_tSFW26\n\n\"HanesBrands said on Wednesday it would sell its sportswear brand Champion to Authentic Brands Group in a deal valued at $1.2 billion, as the company looks to streamline business and focus on its innerwear categories. Shares of HanesBrands surged 15.6% in premarket trading. The deal could reach up to $1.5 billion through an additional contingent cash consideration of up to $300 million based on achievement of performance thresholds. The acquisition of Champion, known for its athletic tops and hoodies, would help Authentic Brands to foray into the fast-growing sportswear business, as customers increasingly look to fill their wardrobes with casual and athleisure clothing that tends to be more comfortable and stylish.\" #authenticbrands #hanes #retail #mergersandacquisitions #finance #corporatefinance #equipmentfinance #financialservices #equipmentleasing https://lnkd.in/gfXqSFQd\n\nI have questions. 1. Does Under Armour have a clear vision and is this choice aligned to who they wish to be and to whom? Hope it‚Äôs not the other way around (designer shaping brand‚Äôs dna) 2. Is this all a (brilliant) PR stint, meant to galvanize the stock market, investors, media? Hope not. 3. Is the right choice to win with women (white space that many sportswear brands are failing to crack)? Hope I‚Äôm wrong but my gut feeling tells me it might not be. Hopefully, Under Armour got it all sorted out. As they say, ‚ÄòHope is last to die‚Äô. #sportswear #retail #merchandising #sales #brandstrategy #turnaround #fashiondesigner"
