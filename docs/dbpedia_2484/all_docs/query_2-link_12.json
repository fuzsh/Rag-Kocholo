        "text": "Micheal (Mike) Frederick Bauer, age 62, of San Francisco, California passed away on July 31, 2020 after a short battle with cancer.\n\nMicheal was born on August 9, 1957. He was the only child of Dorothy and Merle Bauer.\n\nHe graduated from Carrington High School and Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota followed by Southern California College of Optometry at Fullerton, California.\n\nUpon graduation, Micheal decided to make California his home. His decision to move to San Francisco was based not only on his love for the beauty of the city but also his respect for the diverse population.\n\nMicheal worked in the interior design industry for 36 years. Based in San Francisco, he worked in sales on a national level and traveled throughout the United States and Canada. He attended trade shows on a regular basis, including the annual show in Paris and textile mills in France, Switzerland and Italy.\n\nHis most recent employment was with the highly respected Glant Textiles, where he served as the company’s National Sales Manager. Throughout his career, Micheal was a natural mentor to many and was highly respected in his field. His ability to relate to all he met and instantly gain their trust was a gift he was well known for.\n\nMicheal, along with his partner of 21 years, Mario Herrada, shared a great passion for international travel, art exhibits and music. Traveling to countries around the world enabled them to make friends across foreign borders, especially Italy. His music taste included his love for David Bowie and the Rolling Stones as well as season tickets to the San Francisco Opera.\n\nMicheal followed politics closely on both the local and national level and proudly supported the Democratic Party. His love for nature led him to become a member of the World Wildlife Fund and the Wilderness Society.\n\nMicheal is survived by his mother, Dorothy Bauer, and his life partner, Mario Herrada. He was preceded in death by his father, Merle Bauer.\n\nMicheal touched the lives of many with his smile and trademark sense of humor. He truly cared about people and had a heart of gold. God bless his memory."
