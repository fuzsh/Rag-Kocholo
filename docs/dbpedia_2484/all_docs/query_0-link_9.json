        "text": "In 1971, at the early age of 24, LARRY AASHEIM and his friend Dick Harte boldly set out on a new business venture. The partners wanted to provide high-quality, specialty sporting goods for Montana’s young athletes. With little resources and manpower, they began driving around the state of Montana trying to get sporting goods orders from high school and college athletic programs.\n\nForty-five years later, that “backseat” startup has become Universal Athletic Service, a regional sporting goods company headquartered in Bozeman, Montana that calls on and provides services to every school and college in nine states in the Western United States. Universal Athletic is considered the largest independent team dealer in the country.\n\nAasheim was officially the first employee of the company, making the very first sale. In the early years, he worked in all facets of the company but emphasized school sales. As the company grew, he took on management duties, and in 1989 he took over as company president and chairman of the board.\n\nFor 45 years, Aasheim worked out of the same building on Main Street in Bozeman and watched his company grow from two employees and $100,000 in sales to more than 250 employees and $50 million in sales. Universal now operates 13 retail locations and staffs 50 wholesale salespeople.\n\nThroughout the years, Aasheim has been actively involved in the Bozeman community. He has been president of the Bozeman Little League, Hawk Boosters, Montana State University Quarterback Block and Bobcat Boosters. He has also received several prestigious awards, including the Bozeman Area of Commerce Community Service Award, the North Dakota Coaches Association Service Award, the Montana Coaches Association Service Award and the T.A.B. Award.\n\nFor anyone who has been fortunate enough to work with Aasheim, they would say no one has cared about their employees quite as much as he. Aasheim is like family to many former and current Universal employees. He creates an atmosphere of comfort and fun and he is the first to acknowledge when great work is done by an employee. The numerous employees who have been with Universal for 10-, 15- and 20-plus years are a great testament to Aasheim as a leader and a person and the culture he has created within the Universal family.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nBILL BATTLE is not just the founder of the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), he is arguably the founder of the concept of collegiate licensing itself. In 1981, upon signing legendary University of Alabama coach Paul “Bear” Bryant to a licensing agreement, Battle had to first help the school make a licensing department in which to work. From there, the CLC was born. Battle was a visionary who understood strength and efficiency in numbers. Using a model similar to the NFL’s, Battle went door-to-door convincing administrators of a vision where all trademarks were regulated and available in one place. According to Battle, schools, licensees and retailers would all benefit if they just joined together.\n\nBattle’s vision became a reality and collegiate licensing became a $4.3 billion industry. He was able to develop the first label that signified “officially licensed collegiate products.” Under Battle’s guidance, the CLC grew to represent more than 200 schools, conferences and bowl games, as well as NASCAR and the PGA Tour. However, he never strayed from his passion for college sports, because Bill Battle also made himself famous as a college head coach. At 29, Battle was the youngest college head coach in the country while at the University of Tennessee from 1970-1976. He is now the Athletic Director of Alabama, where he once played football and was an assistant coach under “Bear” Bryant.\n\nBattle has been recognized for his tremendous leadership capabilities, and the large impact he had on all facets of the sporting goods industry, by several organizations throughout his career. He received a National Football Foundation award in 2008 for Outstanding Contributions to Amateur Football. In 2010, Battle was inducted into the National Association of Collegiate Marketing Administrators’ (NACMA) Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame and received its Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. Battle remains one of the most quietly influential figures in college athletics today. Working as CLC’s chairman and adviser at the age of 70, Battle is still essential to client relations. In fact, athletic directors still respect and call upon him, whether they have a question about business or they’re looking to hire a position, because Battle is the go-to guy.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFootwear entrepreneur Glenn Barrett revolutionized that segment of the sporting goods industry from the inside out. Most public attention is paid to the style of footwear on the outside but OrthoLite, which Barrett founded in 1997, focused on the inside and the importance of comfort and performance.\n\nBarrett introduced a new open-cell PU foam insole technology that led OrthoLite to become recognized as the world leader in branded footwear component technologies. OrthoLite partners with more than 500 of the world’s leading footwear brands – including adidas, ASICS, Timberland and Under Armour – who trust OrthoLite to elevate the comfort, performance and sustainability of their footwear.\n\nOrthoLite has provided athletes with another tool they need to succeed and Barrett’s products can be found in more than 600 million pairs of footwear a year. Because OrthoLite is U.S.-owned and operated and has production facilities in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Spain, India and Brazil it can work alongside its brand partners wherever they manufacture shoes.\n\nBarrett is also a longtime supporter and member since 1980 of the non-profit Two Ten Footwear Foundation. Two Ten is a national organization which helps people in the footwear industry with professional development and assistance if they are going through hardships or crises. In 2022, Barrett received the A.A. Bloom Award (named after one of the founders of Two Ten) honoring an individual who has given greatly to Two Ten through initiatives, hard work, dedication and unselfish actions.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFRED BEAR (deceased April 27, 1988 at age 86) was directly responsible for the development of design and manufacturing processes used by all present-day manufacturers of high-quality archery bows. He was the first to make possible mass production of bows and arrows and held several patents relating to the manufacture of archery equipment. Born in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, Fred Bear started the Bear Products Company in 1933. In 1946 the company was incorporated and re-named Bear Archery Company, with Fred Bear as President. That same year the plant was moved from Detroit to Grayling, Michigan, where it continued to flourish.\n\nBowhunting is a recognized sport today largely as a result of Bear’s legislative efforts by personal appearances before state commissions and committees and his continuing attention since 1927. Favorable action was based to a great degree on his personal bowhunting success and his dedication to the principle that hunting with a bow has a definite place in sound conservation policy. Before 1935, bowhunting was not recognized by any state. When a ban was placed on the discharge of firearms in the vicinity of the Lumberman’s Monument in Tawas, Michigan, Bear and fellow bowmen hunted in this area. Following his successful experiment, Bear helped present the case for legislative approval, with the result that two Michigan counties were opened to bowhunting in 1937.\n\nToday’s recognition of bowhunting by Conservation Departments and Game and Fish Commissions of many states is a result of Bear’s appearances, correspondence and devotion. Fred Bear, at his own expense, undertook the task of popularizing bowhunting by utilizing photography. He authored 14 films with international distribution to both private and television audiences. The films were on bowhunting for big game, archery instruction and manufacturing processes. They were without advertising of any kind, carrying only the legend, “Presented in the Interest of Good Hunting by the Bear Archery Company.” The archery industry admittedly rose to its present multi-million dollar position because of bowhunting. The success of the industry can rightly be attributed to the pioneering efforts and the continuing attention it received from Fred Bear.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nIn 1971, DAVID BECKERMAN, a former basketball player for Southern Connecticut State University, founded Starter. Based in New Haven, Connecticut, Starter is an American manufacturing company of sporting goods apparel, footwear and accessories, made famous for its authentic team satin jackets. Beckerman was quickly able to turn his small business into one of the most successful sports and athletic apparel merchandisers in the world. At its peak in profits, Starter grossed more than $750 million a year.\n\nStarter owes its success directly to Beckerman, who dedicated his life’s work to creating authentic apparel that capitalized on the emotional bond fans have to a sports team and/or individual players. Beckerman accomplished this by successfully being the first to enter into licensing agreements with professional sports leagues for the right to manufacture and market replicas of professional team apparel and later, to supply clothing worn on the field by professional players. Beckerman got his first big break when, in 1976, he was able to obtain non-exclusive licensing agreements with a number of Major League Baseball (MLB) teams for the right to manufacture and market authentic replicas of MLB team jackets, jerseys and shirts. Shortly thereafter, Beckerman expanded into headgear, active-wear and accessories.\n\nThe company Starter truly took off in 1979 after Beckerman was able to obtain licenses to sell apparel worn by professional players during games. Starter instantly became famous for its satin jackets worn by MLB players. By 1983, Starter was developing clothing with the NBA, NFL, NHL and the Canadian Football League (CFL). It was not long before Starter became a household name. Beckerman capitalized on the success with aggressive marketing strategies that lifted the brand of Starter to new heights. For example, Beckerman intentionally placed the Starter logo on the back of his baseball caps so that when fans fashionably wore the hats backwards the Starter logo was front and center. As a result, consumers would see the Starter logo before even knowing what team the wearer was representing. His marketing strategies led to instant brand loyalty and escalated the Starter name into a fashion status symbol among fans.\n\nBeckerman sold Starter in 1999. He is currently the chairman of Acorn Group, a real estate management and investment company. Beckerman gives back to the community through The David A. Beckerman Foundation and the Beckerman Family Pace Funds. He also continues to partake in his first passion, basketball, by coaching the Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Hamden Hall in Connecticut.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWorking in a hardware store gave ERIC BEZANSON some of the necessary tools for long-term success in the sporting goods industry.\n\nOne of Bezanson’s first jobs was a buyer for the sporting goods section of T.B. Calkin Ltd., in the Canadian maritime province of Nova Scotia. Bezanson became manager of Calkin’s first sporting goods store in the mid-1960s and that led to his purchase of Cleve’s Sporting Goods in Halifax in 1972.\n\nHis involvement in the formative years with the Sports Distributors of Canada (SDC) helped Bezanson grow Cleve’s Source For Sports to 18 retail locations, two team/institutional locations and a seasonal ski hill in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Bezanson’s success and devotion to the industry made him an ideal choice for the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame Class of 2021. He joins retired SDC president Randy Hooper (2012), John Forzani of The Forzani Group (2010) and Jack Cooper of Cooper International, Inc., (1979) as Canadian members of the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame.\n\n“Congratulations to Eric on your induction to the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame joining the late Jack Cooper, the late John Forzani and myself as the four Canadians to be so honoured as members of this prestigious Hall of Fame,” Hooper said. “Your vision and relentless work ethic built the Cleve’s organization from a single store in Halifax to dominating sporting goods retail and team sales on the east coast of Canada. Your support of the Source for Sports group of retailers contributed strongly to the success and respect the group enjoys today.\n\n“I have thoroughly enjoyed our relationship over the many years participating together on the boards of Sports Distributors of Canada and the Canadian Sporting Goods Association. A visit to Halifax always included a sensational lobster feast with the Bezanson family and a friendship I will always cherish.”\n\nBezanson played baseball and hockey as a kid but had a larger interest in business and sales. His timing for moving his family to Halifax could not have been better as the sportswear market and fitness boom took off in North America. Bezanson transformed Cleve’s focus from hunting, fishing and traditional sports to include more emphasis on athletic shoes and clothing that customers need year-round.\n\nOne of the keys for Cleve’s growth was Bezanson making sure he fought for his business but also understanding the best deal was a win-win for both parties. Bezanson’s organizational skills let brands know their products would be well-represented in Cleve’s stores.\n\nBezanson also devoted a lot of time back to the sporting goods industry. He served on the Board of Directors of the Canadian Sporting Goods Association (CSGA) from 1979-89 and received the CSGA Award of Merit in 1989. He also served on the SDC Board of Directors from 1989-95.\n\nSupporting local sports has been a big part of Cleve’s success as it has outlasted challenges from other chains in its territories. Cleve’s has been a sponsoring partner of Sport Nova Scotia almost since the organization started. Cleve’s is also a title sponsor for the Sport Nova Scotia Athlete of the Month program, which rewards male and female individual athletes and teams with gift certificates to its stores and a framed certificate.\n\nCleve’s also supports KidSport™, a Sport Nova Scotia program that helps youth in need participate in organized sports. Cleve’s also sponsors Run Nova Scotia and donates prizes to almost any sports team or association that asks for fundraising help.\n\n“Eric hasn’t built a business; he’s built an institution deeply rooted in empowering the communities in which they live,” said Ed Kinnaly, CEO of Bauer Hockey. “The business that Eric and his family have built reflect their values as people who genuinely care about doing good for the long-term. We’re incredibly fortunate to have an organization like Cleve’s in our industry.”\n\nBezanson’s success led to recognition in 1997 from the Maritime Sporting Goods Association and as the Atlantic Canada Entrepreneur of the Year in the retail category. Cleve’s also received a Snowsports Industry Association (SIA) Canadian Retailer of the Year honor in 2013.\n\nThousands of employees have fueled Cleve’s success and that includes members of Bezanson’s family. His wife Anne did the bookkeeping when they bought the store. His three sons are also involved in the company – Kevin is the president and also serves on the National Sporting Goods Association Board of Directors, Peter is a buyer and Gregory operates a cresting business on the team/institutional side.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFRANK WILLIAM BRADSBY (Deceased on May 10, 1937) was born in 1885 in Lebanon, Illinois, and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended elementary school and high school there. His business career began when he took the position of stock boy with the Simmons Hardware Company in St. Louis in 1894. He advanced to traveling salesman selling fishing tackle, then to selling guns and ammunition and finally was put in charge of the sporting goods department. Simmons was at that time the largest hardware house in the world and handled by far the greatest volume of sporting goods.\n\nMr. Bradsby’s next advance was in 1911, when he left Simmons to become sales manager at J.F. Hillerich & Son. Two years later he became Secretary and Treasurer of the firm. In 1916, the firm name became Hillerich & Bradsby Co., and the company expanded operations from making Louisville Slugger bats to the manufacture of golf clubs. Bradsby was in charge of sales and distribution of the new line.\n\nIn the ensuing years, responsibilities to the industry grew as he took an active part in forming and supporting various organizations. In 1928, he organized the National Association of Golf Club Manufacturers and served as its president for six consecutive terms. He also assisted in the formation of the Congress of Athletic and Sporting Goods Manufacturers and was elected to the presidency October 10, 1931, an office which he held until his death.\n\nHe was instrumental in the formation and growth of the Athletic Institute and was president and director when he died. He also interrupted his 19 consecutive terms as president of the Athletic Goods Manufacturers Association. His devotion to the affairs of the sporting goods industry was untiring. He made every effort to carry through causes which he considered beneficial not only to his own business but to the industry as a whole. His contribution was in providing the leadership that is always needed in the competitive struggle of business and at the same time supporting the finer aspects and moral values of the sports world.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nThe groundwork for JOHN M. BROWNING’s (Deceased November 26, 1926 at age 71) accomplishments in firearms development was laid while he was still a boy. His father was a successful inventor and owner of a small repair shop in Ogden, Utah. John helped his father with gun repairs from the time he was 10, and before he was 20 he had made his first gun from the scrap he found around the shop. Mr. Browning acquired his first patent in 1879 when he was 24. The model became the famous Winchester Single Shot Rifle.\n\nAbout this time, John and his brother Matthew established the Browning Brothers Sporting Goods store in Ogden. The store was the forerunner of today’s Browning Arms Company. Since the day of the first patent, John Browning developed and made available to sportsmen and the industry 21 distinct firearms models, including rifles, shotguns, and pistols. Many of these were the first of their type, and most were considered the best available. The impact of Browning’s work in the sporting arms industry can be appreciated when one realizes that many present-day models are basically Browning designs.\n\nThe discoveries he made were not restricted to his own company but were made available to the industry as a whole. As a result, the majority of his inventions have been manufactured by many companies. Upon his death, the Honorable Dwight F. Davis, Secretary of War at that time, paid tribute to Mr. Browning’s work in the development of automatic firearms and attributed much of the army’s military efficiency to the excellence of his work. Modern sportsmen enjoy the use of equally efficient firearms that pay tribute every day to the ability of John M. Browning. Perhaps he would enjoy this more than the compliments paid him by Mr. Davis, since his first love was the sport of shooting and hunting. Only in time of necessity did he turn his efforts to weapons of war.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nThough not a native of the United States, OLE EVINRUDE (Deceased July 12, 1934 at age 57) certainly contributed to the American way of living. Born in Norway in 1877, Ole arrived in America in 1880 with his family and grew up in Wisconsin. Though his education only went through the third grade, apprenticeships with Fairbanks-Morse and Fuller and Johnson, supplemented by many night courses in engineering and related subjects, prepared him for his career in motor mechanics.\n\nThough many credit him with it, Mr. Evinrude did not invent the outboard motor. Such motors had been made in Europe and America, but had proved to be heavy, complicated, and generally impractical. They did not sell well and few companies were willing to make them. Evinrude’s contribution was the refining and simplification of outboard motor design, making it practical, saleable and useful. This was the foundation of a major phase of the sporting goods industry. In 1909, he entered the outboard motor manufacturing business, in partnership with Chris J. Meyers. The advertising slogan of the Evinrude Detachable Rowboat Motor Company was “Throw the Oars Away.” It opened a new era in water travel.\n\nAfter selling out to Meyers in 1914, he re-entered the industry in 1921 by incorporating the Elto Outboard Motor Company. The Elto was the first successful twin outboard. Some 13 “firsts” in outboard motor construction and design are credited directly to him. They range from the first motor he built in 1909, which provided the basis for permanent standards in design and construction, to development of the first unit made especially for use in weedy, shallow water in 1931. He continued to be active in outboard engineering and production until his death. Besides the obvious uses of the outboard motor in sports, its development contributed materially to the improvements of commercial fishing, lumbering, construction and other industries where there is a need for economical boat power.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJAMES HEDDON (Deceased December 7, 1911 at age 66) was born on a farm in eastern New York in 1845 and became an instrumental figure in the fishing tackle business. His family later moved to Michigan, first living in Keeler and settling in Dowagiac in 1860. His father, Richard Heddon, had kept an apiary in Keeler, and the family continued in the bee business in Dowagiac. James came to be well-known for his knowledge of apiculture and his apiary at one time was among the largest honey producers in the United States. He also served for a time as president of the American Beekeepers Association. The Heddon bee strain was developed in the family apiary at Dowagiac.\n\nJames Heddon took a prominent part in the affairs of Dowagiac, serving as mayor and encouraging the development of civic improvements such as waterworks and installation of an electric light system for the town. He purchased the Dowagiac Times in 1885 and published it until a few years before his death in 1911. The Democratic weekly kept up a lively interchange with the Dowagiac Republican, in good old-fashioned style.\n\nHeddon’s active interest in the world around him carried over into sports and resulted in the development of the first topwater bait to be made commercially in the United States. He never stopped pioneering new ideas and from his enterprise and inspiration came many important developments in the fishing lure business. The company named “James Heddon’s Sons” began as a local lure business in a single room in Dowagiac under Mr. Heddon’s direction. His sons continued to develop new ideas and gradually built the company to its present major position in the tackle industry. The company’s success may well be attributed to Mr. Heddon’s attitude toward his small business in its early days. He said, “Let’s don’t try to make the most tackle in the world, just the best.”\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nALBERT GOODWILL SPALDING (Deceased September 9, 1915 at age 66) crowded many things into his life. He was born in Byron, Illinois, in 1850. In 1863, the family moved to Rockford, where he finished his schooling in a commercial college and got his first job in a grocery store. Spalding’s interest in baseball stemmed from his contacts with the Forest City Club of Rockford. His skills as a pitcher got him many well-salaried offers from major ball clubs, but since he was only 17, his mother advised him to continue his business career.\n\nHis efforts to stay in the business world and away from baseball earned him seven successive connections with firms that failed. Although he had nothing to do with the failures, he was mortified by the experience and returned to baseball. The rest of his life and business was sports-related. From 1871-75 he pitched for Boston, and during that time he toured England with two teams of picked ball players. In 1876, he went into business with his brother, J. W. Spalding, on a capital of $800. By 1898 the company had gone into the wholesale business and was building a chain of retail stores.\n\nIn 1900 the purchase of the Lamb Mfg. Company of Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts put Spalding in the manufacturing field. A.G. Spalding and Bros. was now established as a major sporting goods house, both making and retailing merchandise, in foreign counties as well as in the United States. The Spalding Company pioneered in the manufacture of many sporting goods items that had formerly been imported.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of Mr. Spalding’s activities in the sports world was the Grand World Tour he made with the Chicago baseball club and an All-American team made up of chosen members of National League teams, which introduced America’s own game to 14 countries and five continents. At the time of his death in 1915, A.G. Spalding was president of a company that was spoken of as “the most famous of its kind in the world, and the dominant factor in that business on the American continent.” He is remembered as a man who contributed immeasurably to the development of baseball on a legitimate business basis as well as a sport fair to both participants and spectators.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJOHN T. RIDDELL (Deceased July 3, 1945 at age 60) was a native of Michigan and born in Georgetown in 1885. He was an honor graduate at Bethany College in West Virginia and did post-graduate work at Yale, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. His college work was aimed at preparing him for teaching and coaching, and he was quite successful at it, becoming athletic director and football coach at Evanston High School in suburban Chicago in 1913, where he remained until 1927.\n\nIt was this early interest in sports that led him to the development of the removable football cleat and later into manufacturing athletic shoes. In February 1929, John T. Riddell, Inc., was formed. The company soon expanded into the manufacturing of other athletic supplies. In the mid-1930s, Mr. Riddell developed a molded leather basketball, with a process, which soon revolutionized that phase of the sporting goods industry.\n\nPerhaps his most important contribution was the development of a helmet suspension and rigid shell just before World War II began. It was originally designed for use in football, but the government found the suspension was practical for use in steel helmets. Mr. Riddell relinquished his patent rights so production could begin immediately and the suspension was put to use in the war effort, protecting thousands of soldiers. As soon as wartime need for the suspension was passed, Mr. Riddell resumed work on the helmet. Universal adoption of the principle was a significant advance in the elimination of head injuries in football. Mr. Riddell’s contributions to the industry, particularly in the development and refinement of athletic equipment, have led to widespread growth and participation in sports.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWILLIAM J. VOIT (Deceased March 17, 1946 at age 65) was born November 6, 1881 in Worthington, Indiana. Mr. Voit developed and patented the first full-molded, all-rubber, inflatable ball in the late 1920s. Shortly thereafter, he developed and patented one of the first needle-type air retention valves. The next step was the making of the sporting goods industry’s first all-rubber athletic balls (footballs first, then basketballs) in 1931. Though these first balls did not approach the high quality of today’s product, they began the revolution in the making of inflated athletic balls. They were immediately accepted by school purchasing people for their performance.\n\nMr. Voit’s ideas, patents and products revolutionized institutional equipment, made possible greatly increased athletic and recreation activity in the school systems by economies inherent in the type of products and led to universal use of a “new type” product which now dominates sales in its field. Further, this “new type” of athletic balls helped to increase participation in active sports by youngsters in backyards, vacant lots and streets, by providing high-quality, lasting, sports equipment which performed to official standards and yet sold at low prices. Thus, everyone could now afford balls that “performed right,” a standard once limited principally to high-priced team equipment.\n\nMr. Voit’s business philosophy was one of deliberately avoiding the production of any item simply because it might be popular, and therefore profitable, if someone else was already making it. Instead, his products had to involve some new idea and be designed to do a new job, fill a new need, or do some old jobs better or more economically. This philosophy resulted in a continuing flow of innovations useful to the athletic world.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nKnown throughout the sporting goods industry as “Bud,” J.A. HILLERICH (Deceased November 28, 1946 at age 80) created one of baseball’s most famous trade names – the “Louisville Slugger” bat. He was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. Soon after completing grade school, he started as an apprentice in his father’s woodturning shop. Mr. Hillerich was a lover of baseball from his boyhood. He played on local semi-professional teams and was a star hitter himself. When he was 17, in 1884, he turned out the first “Louisville Slugger” bat. At the time, his father could see little future in baseball or baseball bats.\n\nSo Bud took it upon himself to develop and sell the bat that was to find high favor with professional baseball teams because of its design and high quality. Almost single-handedly, he guided the bat end of the business for 20 years until 1911. During that time, the effectiveness of his efforts and his enthusiasm convinced his father that a great future for the company lay in the manufacture of baseball bats. He became his father’s partner in 1899 and president of the company when his father retired in 1911.\n\nTwo years later, the name of the firm was changed to Hillerich & Bradsby when Frank Bradsby became secretary. To Bud Hillerich alone goes the credit for creating one of the most familiar products known to the American sporting goods industry – the “Louisville Slugger.” But he made another outstanding contribution – 60 years of fine example. The integrity of his product and his policy served as a model to follow and a standard to meet.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nBy making it possible for coaches and trainers to purchase training supplies through sporting goods retailers, CHARLES (Chuck) CRAMER (Deceased August 15, 1984 at age 91) and FRANK CRAMER developed a new branch of the sporting goods industry, which added millions of dollars to the sporting goods business. The Cramer story actually began in 1912 when Chuck, then a student at the University of Kansas, sprained his ankle while practicing pole vaulting and was ordered to return home. While sitting around with another pharmacy student, Chuck decided they could mix a liniment that would help the ankle. The mixture worked so well that Chuck was able to compete and win this pole vault event the following weekend.\n\nSix years later, while working in a drug store, Chuck remembered his liniment and wondered if there was a market for it. He made a batch and approached the athletic people in his area. Quite a few coaches and trainers tried it and all become enthusiastic about it. The liniment became a good seller, and Chuck began sending quantities of it to Frank, who was selling building materials in Detroit. It sold well in the East, too, and a business was born. The company was incorporated in 1922, with Frank staying in Detroit to handle Eastern sales. In 1928, at the suggestion of Charlie Bachman, football coach at Kansas State College, Chuck visited Knute Rockne, famed head football coach at Notre Dame, and he tested the material and became a big supporter of the Cramers.\n\nIn addition to starting a whole new branch of the sporting goods industry, the Cramers and their company have performed many continuing services for their industry, including such activities as their “Student Training Course” and “First Aider,” which educated the athletic world to better care of and treatment for athletes.\n\nThree Cramer books are used as basic texts for courses in athletic training in more than 680 colleges and universities. In 1950 Chuck and Frank organized the National Athletic Trainers Association, and for four years they underwrote the expenses of this group, which now has more than 800 members. Dating to 1936, Frank was a member of the committee for the selection of trainers for the Olympic Games and the Pan-American Games.\n\nOf all their accomplishments, Chuck and Frank were most proud of their participation in the National Sporting Goods Association. Chuck attended the organizational meeting in St. Louis in 1929 and at least one of the brothers was at every annual meeting since. They supported NSGA year after year and were wise counselors to many young firms starting in business.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nBy making it possible for coaches and trainers to purchase training supplies through sporting goods retailers, FRANK CRAMER (Deceased May 12, 1971 at age 82) and CHARLES (Chuck) CRAMER developed a new branch of the sporting goods industry, which added millions of dollars to the sporting goods business.

Knight, a General Electric engineer. In 1920, after 10 years of unsuccessful efforts to manufacture the item, he sold his patent to the Horton Manufacturing Company. The Treadway family at the Horton Company knew HERBERT LAGERBLADE (Deceased January 6, 1976 at age 85) and agreed that he would be able to help in promoting the new shaft, so he joined the Horton firm in 1920.\n\nA year later the shaft was put on the market. All went well for a while, until the United States Golf Association (USGA) and the Royal and Ancient Golf Association in England barred the shaft from championship competition in 1923. Then began the struggle to get the ban lifted, a ban imposed out of fear that the shaft would be a mechanical aid. Mr. Lagerblade arranged for a test of the shaft with the Western Golf Association, which gave its approval after seeing it in action at the Edgewater Golf Club in Chicago. Later, the Canadian Golf Association gave its approval.\n\nThe following year, the USGA withdrew the ban. Then there was only one golf body withholding approval of the shaft. Lagerblade went to Europe to submit samples to the Royal and Ancient Golf Association of St. Andrews. With the aid of one of the leading steel tube producers of Great Britain, he soon succeeded in getting the steel shaft sanctioned, giving it worldwide approval. The uniformity made possible by the steel shaft led Herbert Lagerblade to the idea of the matched set of golf clubs, the first of many refinements he introduced.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nThe contributions of the 1964 Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame award honoree to the sporting goods industry over a period of 33 years of active association are widely recognized. They cover almost every facet of the industry. In the field of manufacturer-dealer relations, the efforts of the winner have been particularly noteworthy. It was S. ROBERT PLETZ (Deceased) of the Converse Rubber Company who, in 1949, first introduced the Fair Trade Policy at the NSGA Show in Atlantic City. Through this move, the entire industry benefited materially as proper profit margins were for the first time assured to the sporting goods retailer. The stabilizing effect of this act upon both retailer and manufacturer set the stage for the greatest period of growth and prosperity that this industry has even know.\n\nThroughout his career, he was a vital force in promoting close cooperation between manufacturer and retailer. His unselfish and untiring efforts to build better business for the sporting goods dealer long have been acknowledged by the trade. He served 18 years as a director of the Athletic Institute and 10 years on the Executive Finance Committee of the Institute. In athletic footwear, Pletz, a devotee of and expert at hunting and fishing, has been a guiding force. His ideas on the styling and comfort of outdoor footwear are incorporated today in much of the sports footwear manufactured by his firm.\n\nWorking closely with another Converse leader and Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame, Chuck Taylor, and other basketball pioneers, he correlated the famous Chuck Taylor program of educational promotion with Converse sales procedures, thus giving practical dollars and cents vitality to a great educational crusade on behalf of the game of basketball.\n\nRobert Pletz wrote a seldom-paralleled chapter in the history of America’s sporting goods industry. He, quietly and without fanfare, affected changes for the better throughout the industry. Beyond duty, his conduct as a gentleman, concern for his fellow man and his generous giving of himself to the welfare of the industry, combine to distinguish Bob Pletz as a most worthy and illustrious addition to the Hall of Fame.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nThe contribution of HOWARD HEAD (Deceased March 2, 1991 at age 76) to sports is the metal recreational and racing ski, the most popular type by far for serious skiers throughout the world. With the exception of several companies engaged in the manufacture of wood, fiberglass and epoxy resin skis, the rest of the world has followed Head’s lead and gone heavily for the metal ski. During the early 1950s, Mr. Head fought to win skiers’ allegiance over to metal skis. There had been earlier attempts, all unsuccessful, to make metal skis, and Head had to overcome the resistance and prejudice built up against them, at the same time establishing a new tradition of durability, excellence of performance and unparalleled factory warranties and service.\n\nHoward Head instituted a development program to create the world’s finest racing ski as a complement to the world’s most popular recreational ski. The advanced engineering techniques that put Head in the forefront earlier served to accelerate the competition ski research program. By 1961, a workable ski was in production and gained limited acceptance among professional and amateur racers. At the 1976 Winter Olympic Games at Innsbruck, Austria, 25 of the world’s 150 top Alpine racers used Heads in at least one event.\n\nHead served as chairman of a subcommittee for a national ski manufacturers association, which raised and contributed more than $58,000 in funds and equipment to send America’s greatest Alpine ski team to the Olympics. Howard Head began peddling his skis in a station wagon, selling to anyone who would take them. At the time of his Hall of Fame induction there were more than 1,100 authorized outlets in America alone and 2,500 more clamoring for a franchised dealership. He also got a lot of letters of thanks from individuals, thanking him for the skis he built for them.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFRED BEAR (deceased April 27, 1988 at age 86) was directly responsible for the development of design and manufacturing processes used by all present-day manufacturers of high-quality archery bows. He was the first to make possible mass production of bows and arrows and held several patents relating to the manufacture of archery equipment. Born in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, Fred Bear started the Bear Products Company in 1933. In 1946 the company was incorporated and re-named Bear Archery Company, with Fred Bear as President. That same year the plant was moved from Detroit to Grayling, Michigan, where it continued to flourish.\n\nBowhunting is a recognized sport today largely as a result of Bear’s legislative efforts by personal appearances before state commissions and committees and his continuing attention since 1927. Favorable action was based to a great degree on his personal bowhunting success and his dedication to the principle that hunting with a bow has a definite place in sound conservation policy. Before 1935, bowhunting was not recognized by any state. When a ban was placed on the discharge of firearms in the vicinity of the Lumberman’s Monument in Tawas, Michigan, Bear and fellow bowmen hunted in this area. Following his successful experiment, Bear helped present the case for legislative approval, with the result that two Michigan counties were opened to bowhunting in 1937.\n\nToday’s recognition of bowhunting by Conservation Departments and Game and Fish Commissions of many states is a result of Bear’s appearances, correspondence and devotion. Fred Bear, at his own expense, undertook the task of popularizing bowhunting by utilizing photography. He authored 14 films with international distribution to both private and television audiences. The films were on bowhunting for big game, archery instruction and manufacturing processes. They were without advertising of any kind, carrying only the legend, “Presented in the Interest of Good Hunting by the Bear Archery Company.” The archery industry admittedly rose to its present multi-million dollar position because of bowhunting. The success of the industry can rightly be attributed to the pioneering efforts and the continuing attention it received from Fred Bear.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nMILTON B. REACH (Deceased in 1961) was born in Washington, D.C. in 1878 and graduated from Asheville, North Carolina high school. In 1915 he married Edith Royce of Springfield, Massachusetts. His career in the sporting goods industry began some time prior to 1895 with a brief association with the A.J. Reach Company in Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter he moved to Chicopee, Massachusetts, to join the Lamb Manufacturing Company.\n\nIn 1895, also in Chicopee, he became connected with A.G. Spalding & Bros., working with that firm until 1944, when he retired. He continued to work as a developer of sporting goods items until a short time before his death. He was a force in the sporting goods field for 65 years. Some of his developments are still widely utilized. With Spalding, his constant flow of ideas for better sporting goods equipment quickly brought him to the attention of his superiors and he rose to department head, and in 1914, to general manager of the Chicopee factory. In 1926 he was named company vice-president.\n\nAuthor of nearly 100 patents, innovator of countless other improvements in product and manufacture, Mr. Reach combined the creative inventiveness of the artist with the practical know-how of the production executive. His most notable inventions were the cushion cork center baseball, which was adopted by the major leagues around 1927, and the molded, stitchless basketball, which replaced the stitched panel, bladder inflated ball in the late 1930s.\n\nMr. Reach was not only a prolific inventor himself but consistently nurtured and supported an atmosphere for creativity and constant improvement at the Chicopee factory. No list of the Chicopee attainments is available but among the contributions during the period under consideration were: Numbered golf irons, registered irons, cushion-neck irons, flange-sealed irons, constant improvements in golf and tennis balls, the Top-Flite and Kro-Bat racquets, synthetic shuttlecocks, synthetic softball centers and concave golf woods. It is safe to say that no company enjoyed a superior reputation for equipment during this era.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJOHN A. SAND, JR. (Deceased) gained his experience previous to starting his own business in his father’s knitting mill. After three years of making sweaters, Sand entered the athletic clothing industry under the trademark Sand-Knit and continued as president of the firm until 1963. In 1961, he sold his business to Medalist Industries and continued as a consultant.\n\nAmong his more renowned innovations are: the UCLA insert in football jerseys; the V-neck football jersey; no-fly football and baseball pants; the boxer-style basketball pants which comprise over 75 percent of all basketball pants today; the 2 x 2 ribbed-knit waistband, which not only allowed for greater stretch but enabled the waistband to have knit stripes. Some of Sand’s technical innovations include: development and use of ribbed-knit cloth in athletic uniforms. Ribbed-knit cloth allows for stretch without the use of stretch yarns.\n\nSand developed the first two-way stretch football pant by knitting first rubber and rayon together and then rubber and nylon. Stretch cloth allows for a better-fitting football pant not only for greater freedom of movement, but also for added safety in holding the pads in the proper position. John Sand was the first to successfully use stretch nylon in athletic uniforms. He disclosed this method to other athletic clothing manufacturers in order to promote the use of his yarn so he could realize its great potential. Today, more stretch nylon is used in athletic uniforms than any other yarn.\n\nWorking with several suppliers, Sand helped develop and was the first to use covered Spandex in athletic uniforms. Covered Spandex provides a controlled amount of stretch nylon football pant. This type of pant is now used by well over 50 percent of all high schools and colleges in the country. Besides his specific contributions, John Sand’s imaginative designs, his bold use of stripes and colors, and his daring to experiment had a profound influence on the entire athletic uniform industry.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nR.D. HULL’s (Deceased in 1977) invention and development of the spincast fishing reel revolutionized the sport. When Hull was first learning to fish as a youngster in a small Texas town he had trouble. But so did veteran fishermen who spent more time unsnarling backlashes than fishing. Having his younger brother take the plug and run around to the other side of a small pond and drop it in was one temporary solution. But it worked only until his younger brother wised up.\n\nAs a watchmaker in the late 1940s, Hull continued to relax by fishing. And he continued to suffer a backlash with existing reels. How he adapted a grocery boy’s fixed spool of string into a workable spinning reel is a classic and the spark of today’s spincast fishing reel. Hull was in a supermarket and happened to watch a packing boy peeling cord off the end of a fixed spool. He suddenly had a thought: fishermen got backlashes because the line was attached to a drum. When the drum revolved faster than the line was playing out, the line snared. Attached to a fixed spool, backlash would be impossible.\n\nHull developed 15 models in more than two years, each getting smaller and all uncovered. Finally he utilized the cover to prevent the line from tumbling off the spool. The Texas watchmaker decided to sell his invention. He quit his job, piled his family into their car and took off. When he pulled up in front of the Zero Hour Bomb Co., in Tulsa, Oklahoma, little did he know that his invention eventually would propel the Tulsa company into an industry giant, better known as Zebco Industries. In the 26 years Hull worked for Zebco, a division of Brunswick Corp. since 1962, he introduced 26 models of his reel. Currently 16 are in full production with two more in the prototype stage. Zebco grew from a tiny Tulsa manufacturer to a company making more than 30,000 reels daily.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nEDWARD C. HOUGH (Deceased January 24, 1959 at age 86) was introduced to the sporting goods industry in 1899, when he joined the Plymouth (Michigan) Iron Windmill Co. as a tester and packer of rifles. In 1894 the company was reorganized as the Daisy Manufacturing Co. When Hough first became involved with air rifles, he was aware of the potential of the product as a source of recreation for American youth. He also was aware of the dangers air rifles could present if used improperly.\n\nHough’s awareness paid off for America’s young sportsmen since a shooting education program was developed at Daisy under Hough’s guidance. This program led to similar nationwide programs with the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, U.S. Jaycees and other groups. During his years at Daisy, Hough held several executive positions. His first was secretary – a post to which he was elected in 1894. In 1902 he was named Daisy’s treasurer, and in 1915 he was elected vice president and treasurer. Hough assumed the company’s presidency in 1956, succeeding Charles H. Bennett, and held that position until his death.\n\nBorn March 17, 1872, Hough was a lifetime resident of Plymouth. He married Louise Sheffield in October 1896, and raised a family with one son and two daughters. His son, Cass S., kept up the family tradition in the sporting goods industry by being elected president of Daisy and the Victor Recreation Products Group.\n\nHough’s wide-ranging business and civic interests led him to become founder and first president of the Plymouth Telephone Co. in 1901; an organizer and founder of Plymouth’s Mayflower Hotel; a member and one of the developers of the Meadowbrook Country Club in Detroit; and a member of the Plymouth City Council. He was also a member and former president of the Plymouth School Board; a charter member and second president of the Plymouth Rotary Club; a member of the Detroit Club; and a member of the Plymouth Rock Lodge AF & AM.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nG. MARVIN SHUTT (Deceased November 7, 1979 at age 61) guided the tremendous growth of the National Sporting Goods Association as executive director for 31 years. Joining NSGA in April 1948, Shutt was recognized as a major contributor to the development of the sporting goods industry into the $17 billion business it is today. He was largely responsible for bringing stature and strength to the industry during its spectacular growth of the past three decades. His development and expansion of NSGA services sustained support of industry promotional organizations and helped achieve his goal.\n\nShutt brought NSGA from a three-person operation and a miniscule budget in 1947 to its present position featuring a staff of 44 full-time professionals, a Chicago headquarters building, five regional offices and a multi-million dollar annual budget. NSGA has been based in the Chicago area since 1956, owning and operating each of its three headquarters buildings. Shutt’s influence on the industry and the Association are in evidence annually at the NSGA Convention and Show, the nation’s largest sporting goods trade event. During NSGA’s 50th Anniversary, in 1979, the NSGA Convention & Show attracted 1,675 exhibitors and 50,000 industry members. In 1947, this trade event drew only 300 exhibitors and 3,600 attendees.\n\nBorn on March 23, 1918, in Auburn, Illinois, a small farming community south of Springfield, Shutt worked his way through Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois. From there he went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in journalism from the University of Illinois in 1939. He earned a master’s degree in economics in 1941 from Illinois. A few of his contributions to the industry would be the fostering of the dramatic growth of the Chicago Convention and Show and the Anaheim Fall Market, Memo to Management, Cost-of-Doing Business Survey, The Sporting Goods Industry Annual Market Report, Billiard Congress of America, Billiard & Bowling Institute of America, Ski Retailers International, The Sports Foundation, Inc., Gold Medal Awards, The Compass Program and Industry Product Fact Books. He was voted into the Medalist Industry Hall of Fame and cited by the United States Chamber of Commerce.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJAMES M. LONG (Deceased) was Senior Vice President of Spalding Sports Worldwide, Chicopee, Massachusetts. Long was an integral part and driving force in the sporting goods industry for more than 50 years. He joined the Engineering Department of Spalding on February 23, 1932, and has served the company as an Engineer, Engineering Manager, Vice President, President of Engineering and Product Design, President of Spalding International and Senior Vice President of Manufacturing Operations for Spalding Worldwide.\n\nLong assisted Milton B. Reach in the design of the Last Built laceless basketball and developed the equipment to manufacture it. Laceless basketballs could be made perfectly round, which made for better passing, dribbling and shooting and the resulting increase in scoring led to a dramatic rise in the game’s popularity. He made a major contribution to the sport of golf by spearheading the transition from hickory-shaft golf clubs to steel shafts, designing the first matched golf clubs, assisting in the development of methods for testing the flexibility, durability and matching of steel shafts, and assisting in the development of a golf club grip foundation which led to the current totally molded rubber grips.\n\nHe is credited with developing the production line conveyor process for making fully finished golf club heads, developing the first automatic finishing process for iron club heads and assisting in the development of the process for the first polyurethane topcoat for golf balls. Thus, because of James Long, the sporting goods industry has new products to sell, better products to sell and more products to sell. He built two factories for Spalding in the U.S. and supervised the building of factories in Italy, Spain and Japan. He supervised worldwide operations for Spalding for more than 30 years throughout Canada, Australia, Europe, India, Pakistan, the U.S.S.R., Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the Republic of China. He was among the first in the sporting goods industry to go to the Far East to set standards for product improvements.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWALTER MONTENEGRO (Deceased November 3, 2009 at age 100) spent more than 45 years in the manufacture and distribution of tennis and squash racquets and equipment. During that time, he became dedicated to the improvement of racquet sports, especially through the ownership with his son of the Cragin-Simplex Corporation. Mr. Montenegro also was active in the affairs of service organizations and he helped found and manage that association’s Manufacturing Division.\n\nIn 1961, he was instrumental in changing the nature of squash and increasing participation in it by developing and producing a new ball known as the “Green Diamond.” The “Yellow Diamond,” developed soon after, helped make squash a year-round sport for the first time by making it easier to play in the summer months. Mr. Montenegro also published a precedent-setting magazine devoted to squash, which was distributed monthly and was free. Prior to it, there was no publication dedicated to publishing current news about the sport.\n\nMr. Montenegro served as treasurer for the World Professional Squash Racquets Association and starting in 1947 donated its annual championship trophies. He was honored many times for his contributions and service to racquet sports. In 1974, he was honored with a testimonial dinner for 42 years of service to racquet sports. He has been named “Man of the Year” by the North American Squash Racquets Association and presented with its Ketcham Trophy.\n\nThe Tennis Foundation of North America, which he helped to found in 1973, named him its first Honorary Lifetime Member in 1983, when he retired from active participation. He also held Lifetime Honorary memberships in: the U.S. Professional Tennis Association, U.S. Squash Racquets Association, World Professional Squash Association and Mexican Squash Racquets Association. His contributions and service led to the increased enjoyment by many of racquet sports.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJACOB S. OSHMAN (Deceased April 30, 1965 at age 64), an immigrant boy who arrived in America at age 11, started learning the retail business in 1919 working in his aunt’s dry goods store. In 1931, he purchased the bankrupt stock of a surplus store in Houston. While liquidating the inventory he was intrigued to see sporting goods sold the fastest. The spark was lit and Jake Oshman’s extraordinary love story with the sporting goods business began.\n\nFrom that liquidation sale until his death in 1965, he was obsessed with a dream to create a business that would live after him. The success and leadership he provided during those 33 years are both an inspiration and a legacy. A superior merchant, he possessed a rare sense of what people wanted. He greatly admired major department chain stores and applied their ideas and techniques of “open merchandising” to the sporting goods business.\n\nHe knew customers wanted to touch and feel the merchandise, so he gave them direct access to it. He organized Oshman’s stores into departments, with department identification and department heads. He positioned Oshman’s among the first sporting goods stores to offer charge accounts. From that credit list, he developed mailing lists that led to the development of Oshman’s direct mail catalog, which became a model for the industry. He was one of the nation’s first merchants to combine sportswear with sporting goods.\n\nOf singular importance was his willingness to graciously share his knowledge, experience and understanding. His counsel was sought by the National Sporting Goods Association and its directors for the betterment of the industry and the benefit of other retailers. He shared Oshman’s Christmas catalog experience with NSGA members who could not have otherwise produced one individually. Most of Mr. Oshman’s philosophies on merchandising, service and quality in the sporting goods business were so sound that they are as applicable today as then.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nDWIGHT C. HAUFF (Deceased July 24, 2009 at age 104) was part of the sporting goods industry for 65 years at the time of his induction. He graduated from Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1926, where he lettered in basketball and baseball and was on the all-conference team. After graduation, he returned to his hometown of Merrill, Iowa, as a teacher and coach. From 1929-32, he worked as a salesman for the A.G. Spalding & Bros. Company. Then, in 1933, he and Evelyn Peterson opened Dwight Hauff Sporting Goods, which he continued to operate until his death.\n\nSince that time, Hauff saw his company grow to include three other retail sporting goods stores in the Midwest: Hauff Sporting Goods of Omaha, Nebraska; Iowa Sports Supply of Cedar Falls, Iowa; and Dakota Sports, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Always going the extra mile, Mr. Hauff unselfishly helped many others get a start in the industry, both as dealers and factory reps. His dedication and support to the young never stopped. Each year, he printed a track schedule of all the area meets. In addition, he wrote a monthly newsletter, which he mailed to surrounding schools, covering area news and providing words of praise and congratulations to area teams and coaches. He also used the newsletter to point out rule changes and list teams that need games. He spoke to area college classes and helped Morningside College students for years with part-time jobs.\n\nHauff served on the advisory board of the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) since its inception and his idea for voluntary funding by the helmet manufacturers continues today. He was also a member of the Athletic Institute-Sports Foundation Interscholastic Steering Committee to promote participation in athletics and to combat curtailment of athletic programs. Closer to home, he was inducted into the Northwest Iowa Coaches’ and Officials’ Hall of Fame and was a member of the Greater Sioux City Athletic Association and Tri-State Coaches’ and Officials’ Association.\n\nHauff served as President (now known as Chairman) of NSGA in 1960 and also served two terms on the board of directors. He was member of the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame Committee as well as former president of The Sports Foundation. Dwight Hauff continued to support NSGA and the sporting goods industry. He attended the first NSGA Chicago Show and missed only a couple in the last 65 years.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFRED W. SINGTON (Deceased August 20, 1998 at age 88) had a deep-rooted love of sports that began during his college days at the University of Alabama where he was all-American in football in 1929 and 1930 and all-American in baseball in 1931. It seemed inevitable that he would seek a career in athletics, and from 1931-1934, he was a member of the football coaching staff at Duke University. He played professional baseball from 1931-1940, starting in the minor leagues in Atlanta, and then spending six years in Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators and Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Sington opened his first sporting goods store in his native Birmingham, Alabama in 1947. Steady expansion followed, and the first branch store was opened in Homewood, followed by the opening of stores in Huntsville and Gadsden. Over the next four decades, his business grew to become one of the leading retailers and team distributors in Alabama and the Southeast.\n\nSington was always conscious of his obligations to his community. He was the founder and director of the Metropolitan Youth Football League, chairman of the Birmingham Athletic Affairs Committee and founder of the All-American Bowl played in Birmingham. He also was a Southeastern Conference football referee and president of the Football Officials Association. Sington was a member of the Southeastern Sporting Goods Dealers Association and former president of the Alabama Sporting Goods Dealers Association. He served as president of NSGA in 1966, was a member of the board for six years and served as chairman of the Hall of Fame Committee.\n\nHe was a member or former member of many other sports-related and civic organizations. As a result of his many outstanding achievements, numerous honors came to Sington in the area of athletics. He is a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, National Football Hall of Fame, Softball Hall of Fame and Southern Football Hall of Fame and was named to the All-Time University of Alabama Football Team.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nDR. SUREN M. SERON (Deceased January 1987) was a man of many talents, both inside and outside the sporting goods industry. He entered the sporting goods business in 1952, when he invented the “Glass-Gard” eyeglass holder, patented in 1958. This eyeglass holder was the first fully adjustable model of its kind, fitting and holding to all temple sizes without slipping off. For the first time, eyeglass wearers had something that would easily fit their glasses and keep them in place comfortably. Over the years, the Glass-Gard enabled millions of eyeglass wearers to achieve greater excellence and perform to their full potential as they participated in sports of all kinds with confidence.\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Seron and his wife, Blanche, Seron Manufacturing Company successfully marketed the Glass-Gard to worldwide distribution and acceptance, both as a sports accessory as well as an accessory for industrial safety glasses. In 1959, Dr. Seron received a patent on the “Tip-Gard” Whistle Mouthpiece Cover, which protected thousands of coaches and referees from damaged teeth while also allowing metal whistles to be used comfortably in cold or freezing weather. Dr. Seron also received a patent on a new type of whistle lanyard and manufactured many specialty lanyards.\n\nWhile his company continued to produce many fine products used by athletes all over the world, his accomplishments could be felt in other areas as well. He received his Doctor of Dental Surgery Degree from the University of Illinois College of Dentistry in 1932, was on the staff of Silver Cross Hospital for more than 25 years and served various terms on the Joliet Township, Illinois and Board of Education. Dr. Seron was president of Seron Manufacturing Company until his death.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJESS HEALD was still active in the sporting goods industry, serving as chairman of Worth, Inc., in Tullahoma, Tennessee, at the time of his Hall of Fame induction. His career has focused on baseball and softball, where he holds several patents:\n\nIn 1971, he patented the first one-piece aluminum bat, which proved more economical for youth, high school, college and amateur baseball and softball programs. By 1974, Worth was the largest aluminum bat manufacturer with more than 30 percent of the market.\n\nIn 1975, he patented the first polyurethane cores for softballs. This was well-suited for the demands of slow-pitch play and created greater durability and consistency of performance.\n\nIn 1979, he patented the polyurethane core for baseballs and in 1984 developed the Reduced Injury Factor (RIF) baseball and softball. The development of the RIF ball led to the establishment of the NOCSAE standard for balls and the creation of a new safety baseball industry.\n\nIn 1980, Heald developed the ball liveliness standards that are used today by all major softball associations. He also developed a swing weight standard that offered baseball and softball players a more precise method of determining bat selection.\n\nIn 1986, Heald developed the first graphite composite bat in the United States and the manufacturing process that reversed the trend to go offshore for composite structures. He also invented and trademarked the modern batting glove, adapting golf glove and handball glove patterns.\n\nHeald graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1957 with a B.S. degree in general engineering with honors, and he earned his master’s in aerospace engineering in 1964 from the University of Virginia. He also has advanced aerospace engineering credits from the University of Tennessee Space Institute. He was appointed to President George Bush’s New American Schools Development council in 1987 and received special honors from the Boy Scouts of America in 1974 and 1987.\n\nHeald served as chairman of the SGMA baseball/softball technical advisory board from 1984-89 and won a meritorious service award in 1992 from the American Baseball Coaches Association. He was elected a member of the Tullahoma City School Board in 1991, served as president of the Highland Rim Business Roundtable starting in 1988 and is active in many other local civic organizations.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJAMES L. EASTON (Deceased December 3, 2023 at 88) worked diligently on behalf of the sport of archery since entering the sporting goods business in 1960. He was one of the first commissioners named to the Olympic Games held in Los Angeles, chosen for his business experience and background in archery. He worked full-time for the 1984 Olympics from mid-1983 and was both Archery Commissioner and Mayor of the Athlete’s Olympic Village at UCLA. His contributions to the International Archery Association (FITA) have been many: He organized the 1983 World Archery Championships in Long Beach, California, was Development and Technical Assistance Committee Chairman and served as FITA President. When he was elected to this position in 1989, FITA had 71 member countries and he grew membership to 100 by 1994.\n\nEaston also helped develop an exciting new match competition format for Olympic archery in cooperation with Barcelona RTO and NBC. As part of the 1984 Olympic Games involvement, Easton developed and supported three archery ranges in the Los Angeles area through the Easton Sports Development Foundation. He sponsored the Olympic Training Center in San Diego and supported sports in a variety of other ways: through the Communication & Marketing Committee (promotion of archery) and the New Olympic round task force (to develop a format more interesting to archers, spectators and media). This was done in consultation with the heads of NBC Sports & ESPN, and archery was covered for the first time in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics).\n\nThere were 71 associates when he became FITA President in 1989 and by 1994 there were 93. He committed $500,000 to the Olympic Training Center in San Diego. He has supported sports in a variety of financial ways such as the I.B.A. Founders Club, NAA Sponsor and has built scoreboards for archery tournaments that are available on loan to tournament organizers. He was named Executive of the Year by the U.S. Baseball Association in 1986, and in 1988, he was named to the Archery Hall of Fame. He won the ABA Coach’s Honor Award in 1991. In 1989, Mr. Easton was named UCLA Engineering Alumnus of the Year.\n\nOther honors include the Gold Plaquette (highest honor) from FITA and the Thompson Medal of Honor (highest honor) from the National Archery Association. In addition to his affiliation with FITA., Mr. Easton was on the International Relations Committee of the U.S. Olympic Committee and a member of the National Archery Association Foundation. In 1991, He served on the Board of Directors of the U.S. Olympic Festival.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWILLIAM D. MODELL (Deceased February 14, 2008 at age 86) was the Chairman of Modell’s Sporting Goods, a 105-year-old family-owned sporting goods retail operation established in 1889, a chain of full-line stores based in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nUpon his return from World War II (9th Air Force, 1943-45), Bill Modell and his father Henry, created a veteran’s job training program, which was designed to help train and prepare thousands of young, unskilled and unemployed veterans for futures in the retail field. The headquarters for this training program was at the Modell’s store located at 280 Broadway in New York City. Many of these trainees worked in various parts of the Modell organization. Some of Modell’s finest executives and store managers went through the training program.\n\nBill Modell’s contributions to the sporting goods industry are exemplified by his desire and success in taking Modell’s from a handful of stores to a regional chain of more than 50 locations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Modell organization employed more than 1,500 people in three states. Such growth was accomplished in part by acquiring and revitalizing sporting goods chains in deep financial trouble (Davega in 1963 and Polly Brothers in 1987). In 1955, he founded Modell’s Shoppers World, one of the original mega-discount department store chains.\n\nBill Modell’s most important contribution to the sporting goods industry was the close relationship he developed and has maintained with: Sporting goods vendors because of Modell’s industry-admired timely payment policy; helping and encouraging start-up manufacturers and reps with their first purchase orders and seed money; Modell customers by traditionally passing on good values and an innovator of customer service; and the extensive number of sporting goods salespeople and executives who were trained by Modell’s and who then moved on to become some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the industry.\n\nHe had a long and distinguished career in philanthropy. He was a founder of the Long Island Chapter of the Young Presidents Organization; a founder of the Crohn & Colitis Foundation of America; a founder of the American Digestive Disease Society; co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation for Immunological Research and the Gilda Radner Foundation. He was founder of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation; a founding patron of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; a founder of the Seawane Country Club; and a member of the Friars Club and The 100-Year Association. He also served as Commissioner for the Distinguished Guests Commission for the City of New York by appointment of Mayor Abraham Beame and on the negotiating committee for the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Modell was an alumnus of New York University.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nFollowing World War II, BILL YARRINGTON made a conscious decision to redirect the focus of Yarrington Mills toward the manufacture of trimmings for athletic uniforms. All indications are that he was the first independent manufacturer of trimmings to identify athletics as a significant market and the company became the largest manufacturer of striped rayon braids for Little League through Major League Baseball. He established the custom program so that specialty color combinations could be ordered in single small lots, which was essential for team athletic requirements.\n\nIn the early 1960s, with the advent of double-knit stretch fabrics, Mr. Yarrington bought his first braid-knitting machine. The Dallas Cowboys wanted a side braid for stretch fabric that was not layered. The Cowboys complained that layered trims were cutting off circulation at the knees. He worked with Lamb Knitting Machine Co. to develop its first five-stripe knitting machine. Additionally, he expanded the small quantity program to a 36-yard knit program for the sporting goods trade. This allowed team dealers to offer custom striping programs for their customers without a serious delay in shipment.\n\nMr. Yarrington’s next contribution was stretch-nylon, double-knit fabrics, again in single-piece lots specifically for team requirements. All was done with the highest quality in mind as he had a genuine interest in the end product and how it was going to perform on the field. Through the years, Mr. Yarrington was directly involved in a number of organizations geared to assisting, improving and working for the athletic industry. For about 15 years, beginning in the 1960s, Mr. Yarrington wrote a column for NSGA in The Sporting Goods Dealer, commenting on athletic uniforms. He obtained his information from dealers, retailers, coaches and other manufacturers. This was an effort to gain insight as to changes in styling, manufacturing methods and improvements and direction of the industry. It was from these articles he received the nickname “Mr. Braid.”\n\nMr. Yarrington was an active member of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and was on the committee that established the SGMA color standards. Throughout his career, Mr. Yarrington continued to pursue the highest standards for himself, his company and the industry, which it serves. His focus on the athletic industry, specifically on quality team uniforms, helped to establish numerous innovations for trims and fabric and also for methods of servicing the industry. Mr. Yarrington is a 1940 graduate of the University of Miami, Florida. He is a past member of the Board of Directors of Pop Warner Football. In addition to his membership in NSGA and SGMA, he was a member of the Athletic Institute and the Northern Textile Association. He also is active in church affairs.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nJOHN MOSES BRUNSWICK (Deceased July 25, 1886), founder of the company that ultimately became known as Brunswick Corporation, is the only person whose name has become synonymous with not one, but two, of the world’s major sports – billiards and bowling. A Swiss immigrant woodworker, Mr. Brunswick launched his fledgling company in 1845 by manufacturing his – and America’s – first billiards table. Moreover, the words Brunswick and bowling have been virtually interchangeable among sports enthusiasts worldwide for more than a century. The company he founded has continued to evolve into the most recognizable name in bowling.\n\nWithin two years of the introduction of his first billiards table, orders were arriving from across the country. His tables were outrageously ornate by today’s standards, but the best of them could be called works of art. Sensing the need to expand the company, he sent for his half-brothers from Switzerland, and as early as 1848, a sales office was established in Chicago.\n\nAs John Brunswick’s company grew, it underwent several name changes. By 1884, after successive mergers with Julius Balke’s Great Western Billiard Manufactory and Hugh Collender’s Phelan & Collender Company, it had become the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company (a name it retained until becoming Brunswick Corporation in 1960). Over the years, Brunswick grew and diversified within the sports and recreation business. The Brunswick family currently includes such well-known names as Mercury engines, Bayliner and Sea Ray boats, Zebco fishing tackle and Brunswick Golf; and at one time, MacGregor also was among its members.\n\nAmong its many distinguishing characteristics, Mr. Brunswick’s company was one of NSGA’s most loyal and long-standing supporters. In that regard, 1992 marked a significant milestone, the 50th consecutive year Brunswick was an exhibitor at NSGA trade shows. The 1995 Hall of Fame induction ceremonies were an especially timely tribute to Mr. Brunswick, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of his company’s founding. Already recognized as the oldest continuously independent public company in Chicago, the arrival of its 150th year was honored by the Illinois State Historical Society, which presented Brunswick with the very first Sesquicentennial Business Award the society ever conferred. Mr. Brunswick’s achievements continued to be recognized in modern times even though he was gone for more than a century when he was inducted into the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of Fame. He was admitted to the Billiard Congress Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nCLIFF DICKMAN served as president of Kesslers Sport Shop, Inc., in Richmond, Indiana. After Cliff purchased the business from Phillip “Whitey” Kessler in 1957, sales in this single location were approximately $100,000 per year. With one full-time salesman calling on area schools, the business steadily grew.\n\nIn 1983, a second store was opened in Richmond. Kesslers’ also purchased Indiana stores in Fort Wayne (1985), Indianapolis (1987), Kokomo (1989) and Terre Haute (1992) and opened a cycling and fitness store in Richmond in 1993 to bring the total stores to seven in five cities. The team sales division had six full-time salesmen, covering approximately half of Indiana. There is also one full-time salesperson in the corporate sales division and it employs approximately 70 people. Kesslers Sport Shop, Inc., was family owned and operated. Cliff and his wife Martha Jane worked many hours per week. Sons Bob and Phil were active in the business, as was a son-in-law. Cliff and Martha Jane have eight children and 18 grandchildren.\n\nCliff was a high school football official for 36 years and a basketball and track official for 20 years. He officiated three Indiana state football championship games. From 1992-94, Cliff participated in the Indiana State Park Games and won the gold medal in the shot put in the 60-and-over age division each year. He also played and coached in an “old-timers” basketball tournament, which his team won three years in a row.\n\nCliff was president of the local Boys Club and a Director for 23 years, past president of the local Kiwanis Club, past president of the Downtown Merchants Association, Mayor of Richmond for two terms, County Commissioner for three terms, past president of the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, member of Holy Family Church, former Director of local Jaycees, was chosen Boss of the Year by the American Business Women’s Association (1980) and Boy Scout board member for 23 years. He is a 1953 graduate of Earlham College, where he is the only athlete to earn 16 varsity letters, with four each in football, basketball, baseball and track. He was inducted into the Earlham College Athletic Hall of fame in 1992.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nE. CLAUDE MANNING (Deceased January 19, 2005 at age 97), a native of Ft. Worth, Texas, is the founder and retired Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Nation’s Best Sports, formerly known as the National Buying Syndicate. NBS is one of the world’s largest sporting goods buying organizations, with more than 665 stores in 47 states, which contributes close to $2 billion to retail business annually.\n\nManning, a major in the Air Force in World War II, was in the war surplus business from 1946-56, when he founded the National Buying Syndicate in Fort Worth with eight stores in three states and served as its president for many years. He also was founder and president of Manning’s Sports Centers, a six-store retail operation, for 30 years. He served two terms on the NSGA Board of Directors, was a bank director, past Exalted Ruler of the Elks, was an amateur radio operator and was a Mason and Shriner. He was listed in Who’s Who in Commerce and Industry and Who’s Who in the South and Southwest.\n\nManning received awards from the Governors of Louisiana and Kentucky as well as from Mayors of Louisville, Kentucky and Fort Worth for his leadership of the National Buying Syndicate. In 1929, he graduated with honors from Texas Christian University, where he was president of his class. A scholarship was established in his name. He was one of the founders and an officer in the Alumni Club. He was honored by the Sportsman’s Club of Fort Worth and Ducks Unlimited. He was honored by The Sporting Goods Dealer with its Spinks Leadership Award, “for services of the highest order to the sporting goods industry.”\n\nManning, 87 at the time of his induction, was in merchandising/retailing for more than 65 years. He and his wife have been married for 62 years and have three daughters and four granddaughters. His legacy to the sporting goods industry is his original vision to form a buying group many years ago to concentrate buying power and the exchange of merchandising ideas among independent sporting goods retailers. Today, buying groups are an accepted fact. When Mr. Manning started NBS in 1956, this was an original, new idea that required years of hard work before group buying became recognized as a major part of the sporting goods industry. Many small retailers who have joined buying groups owe their success to the vision of this man. Those who knew and worked with him over the years were enriched by his impeccable character, high integrity, vision and warmth.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWhen BEN PEARSON (Deceased in 1971) was a young man in Little Rock, Arkansas, he read a Boy Scout article by Dan Beard that gave instruction on how to make a bow. Using a piece of hickory and a drawknife, he patterned his first bow. This one simple project became Pearson’s passion and would eventually lead to the industry’s first mass production of archery sets beginning in the late 1930s.\n\nAfter opening a small shop in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in 1932, Pearson and two helpers began making bows and arrows. His dream was to mass produce affordable archery tackle. A short time later, Pearson met Oklahoma oilman Carl Haun, who recognized Pearson’s talents and advanced him $10,000 to equip the kind of plant needed to begin mass production of archery sets. The first real factory for the newly formed Ben Pearson, Inc., was an old brick sorghum mill. Pearson engineered, designed and patented most of the machinery to mass produce the first archery tackle. He then innovated the molded fiberglass bow that was sturdy and economical, because it was produced on multiple presses many times faster than wood or laminated bows.\n\nWithin a few years, the sign over the building read, “World’s Largest Manufacturer of Bows and Arrows of Excellence.” The facility had grown to 10 buildings, employing more than 260 people. By 1945, archery sales had reached a peak of $1.7 million, and the number of employees had grown to more than 600. Ben Pearson and his dreams of mass-producing archery gear eventually brought archery to the every-day consumer through stores like Sears & Roebuck, the neighborhood variety store, sporting goods stores and general merchandise stores. Pearson tackle was also introduced in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and China.\n\nHis interest in developing archery equipment continued over the years. Other products included the “Dead Head” broadhead, target and blunt points, fishing points/arrows and various take-down bows, including his last, a customized three-piece take-down designed from his Bush Master line. Often referred to as the “father of the modern archery movement,” Pearson is credited with designing or directing the development and application of archery manufacturing machines, including the wing trimmer, splice machine, barrel shaft sanding machine, handle wrapper, tiller machine, bow sander, cresting machine, knurling machine and target machines.\n\nHis love of archery and bow hunting was as apparent in the design and production of archery tackle as it was in the area of promotion. Pearson’s outgoing personality and gifted shooting skills made him a favorite at competitive events and exhibitions. He traveled the U.S., Mexico and Canada to promote archery through films, hunts and exhibitions. Called the “master of the moving target,” he shot for audiences from 10 to thousands, including TV viewers, civic groups and the Boy Scouts. In two of his famous hunts, Pearson was filmed shooting an 800-pound grizzly bear and a short time later, a 1,500-pound polar bear. At that time, both bears were the largest ever taken with a bow and arrow.\n\nBen Pearson had many diversified interests beyond archery. He was on the Pine Bluff school board, active in the Rotary Club and was on the Salvation Army board of directors. He also was involved with the successful development and manufacture of cotton harvesting machines that were widely distributed around the world.\n\nPearson’s appreciation of history and architecture was expressed through his support of restoring a block of homes in Pine Bluff, where four of the homes now are on the National Register of Historic Places. Ben was a recipient of the Chief Compton Medal, the highest award given by the National Field Archery Association. He also received a national award from the American Legion Roll of Honor for Industry. In 1972, Pearson was inducted posthumously into the National Archery Hall of Fame and in 1992 was inducted into the Arkansas Outdoor Sportsman’s Hall of Fame. In 1995, he was inducted into the National Bowhunters Hall of Fame.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nLEN STEINLAUF (Deceased December 30, 2016 at age 91) started his sporting goods career working part-time while attending high school and college. His early days included stock work, sweeping and errands at Herman’s, a two-store “chain” with locations on Nassau Street and 42nd Street in Manhattan. After graduation from New York University’s School of Commerce and Retailing in 1947, Len joined his father Edward and uncle Herman Steinlauf at Herman’s, primarily spending his time selling on the floor and as an apprentice assistant buyer.\n\nIn the period from 1916-48, Herman’s was one of many sports retailers in New York City, where the old Davega chain was the most prominent player. In 1949, at the urging of young Leonard and with great resistance from his dad and uncle, Herman’s started to promote in the New York papers with half- and full-page ads, a great departure from the norm at that time. The immediate results were phenomenal – a quiet retailer became the major force in the New York City market by 1955. Len, by that time, was buying and merchandising all categories except guns and tackle, as well as supervising the two retail stores.\n\nIn 1957, Herman’s moved across 42nd Street to a location almost three times larger than the old store. It was by far the largest sports store in New York and won the Sporting Goods Dealer’s Retailer of the Year Award in 1965. Volume in the two stores exceeded $3 million, certainly a gigantic number at that time for two stores. The New York business continued to prosper, and Len Steinlauf was elevated to the role of Chief Operating Officer and General Merchandise Manager in 1966.\n\nIn the fall of 1967, Herman’s became a three-store chain with the opening of a 20,000-square foot store in Paramus, New Jersey, which at that time was perhaps the largest sporting goods store in the nation and was the forerunner of today’s “big box” stores. Paramus was an immediate raging success, and Herman’s had discovered the suburbs. Some of the innovations in Paramus set the stage for the mega-stores of today. Steinlauf felt that the suburbs would draw droves of women shoppers, and with this in mind, a woman store designer was hired to do the plan. Design features such as carpeted floors, separate men’s and women’s dressing rooms and special lighting were included in the design plan, along with special graphics and colors never before used in a sports store. Paramus had a 1990s look in 1967 and dealers from America and around the world came to see this revolutionary “new look.”\n\nSeveral years before Paramus opened, Herman’s media plan expanded from newsprint into radio and then television. They became one of the most prominent sports retailers in the country and caught the eye of W.R. Grace and Company. Grace purchased the $12 million Herman’s chain in 1970 and immediately embarked on a tremendous expansion plan, spearheaded by Len Steinlauf. By 1978, when Steinlauf, then CEO, resigned, Herman’s had 65 stores doing a volume of more than $100 million in nine states and Washington, D.C. Steinlauf also served the industry as a consultant for retailers and manufacturers.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nIn 1979, PAUL FIREMAN secured the U.S. distribution rights to three running shoes produced by the British company, Reebok International Ltd. Reebok was the successor company to the venerable J.W. Foster & Sons, custom maker of athletic footwear since the 1890s. Fireman introduced the first women’s athletic shoe (for aerobics) in 1982, spurring a revolution in fitness and fashionwear that made Reebok one of the fastest growing companies of all time. The company’s sales grew from $13 million in 1982 to $1.8 billion in 1988. Sales in 1996 approximated $3.5 billion.\n\nFireman bought out the parent company in 1984 and arranged the first public offering of stock in 1985. Under his leadership, the company expanded rapidly in Europe and throughout the world. The Reebok brand is now available in approximately 140 countries. In 1992, Reebok, primarily a fitness brand, ventured into untapped sports categories such as baseball, football and soccer, challenging well-entrenched competitors. Reebok now has growing businesses in these and other new categories and a reputation as an authentic sports brand among young people around the world. Some 3,000 athletes competed in the 1996 Olympic Games wearing Reebok footwear or apparel.\n\nFireman identified his company strongly with the human rights movement through sponsorship since 1988 of the Reebok Human Rights Award, honoring young people around the world who risk their lives in the cause of human freedom. Through 1998, 56 individuals from 28 countries have been honored. In 1994, Fireman and Reebok received the Human Rights Award of the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights. In 1993, Reebok instituted a formal diversity management program, involving educational sessions and recruitment of minorities and women for decision-making positions and employee action teams. Before purchasing Reebok, Fireman was an officer in an outdoor sports distributorship owned by his family. He attended Boston University and is a graduate of Tabor Academy. Paul and his wife, Phyllis, live in Newton, Massachusetts, and have three children.\n\nPlease note: This biography was produced from the nominating materials in the candidate’s nominating year, so the information is not current.\n\nBack to Inductees\n\nWhen CURT MUELLER (Deceased October 19, 2019 at age 85) began hi"
