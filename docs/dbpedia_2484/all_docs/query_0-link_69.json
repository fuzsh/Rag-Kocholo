I am looking for a good friend, by the name of Tim Waters, he was stationed at Pinder Barracks, sometime in the 1980’s, around 1985 or so. I don’t remember what company he was with, I think it might have been, HHC. He use to love to shoot pool, at a little bar across from the Green Goose. He also married a german girl, by the name of Sabina. I would love to find him and see how he has been doing. There was also another guy by the name of Donald Dufour that I knew. I am sure there were others I have just forgotten their names. If anyone remembers either one of these guys please e-mail me or if you remember me.\n\nThanks, Cindy199) George Koonce gtkoonce@yahoo.comLocation:\n\n– Saturday, 23.

December 2007 22:06 IP: 10.251.126.70 Assigned to ‘A’ battery, 2/14th (4th AD)in Oct. 1969, which was at Merrill at that time. We moved to Pinder sometime in 1970. It was strange going from Nurnberg to a country town like Zirndorf. We used to go back to Nurnberg on our off times; but then we discovered that sitting on a haystack drinking liebfraumilch, smoking, and listening to CCR was a pretty good time too. I was a 13A10 but I was the Battery Commander’s driver for 6 months. I used to take the jeep out for a ride in the country with my buddies too. It was a great gig. The countryside around Pinder was beautiful. I was also in special weapons. And then I went to a gun section as the ammo carrier driver. The 4th Armored Division Headquarters was right next to our rooms. Our Division commander, Patton’s son (who was also a George) used to be driven in his open jeep, in the cold of winter, playing the role. But I know he never had to walk down on a Sunday night to get a greasy slice or two of pizza because every candy machine on post was empty and he was starving, or had to break into the ‘C’ ration storage bin because he had the munchies. OK, I admit we had it pretty good there; especially since no one was shooting at us. I actually had more fun there than I knew I was having at the time. I remember I couldn’t wait to get to zero days and be done with my two years but when that day came, it was tough leaving my friends there at Pinder. I left Pinder (and the army) in March 1971.185) Darren Stevens es2fire@comcast.netLocation:\n\nVirginia Monday, 24.

Brantley cause he was the first 1st. Sgt. I had. I can’t remember that man ever smiling. As for Batoolouwick he was old timer when I got there in Nov. 74 but I’m sure I have a picture of him in a payday formation. I couldn’t remember Capt. Hubbards name a couple years ago, because he’s the guy who let me go home and get married in May,75. He wanted me to bring a piece of wedding cake back for him,but I didn’t. So when my 30th anniversary came I was wanting to send him a piece of cake. Here’s some names you might remember, Jon Smith, Gary Ruckman, Joe Montgomry, Ssgt. Joiner, Willie Deed, Couto, Sgt. Cook, Brice, Goud, Addison, Ssgt Frank, Fred Shannon. My fisrt Section Chief was Ssgt Hosler.Well got to go.Mike Rogers:\n\nHell Yea Cartwright, I remeber you, didn’t you hit a white rat over the head and then stuff it? I was in A battery 6th section with Jon Smith and Beutuliwick, then got moved over to B battery when I was caught with a hash pipe at NATO 23, hey I was there for the party!!Rick Cushion:\n\nHey Mike, Are you the Mike Rogers that loved the Rolling Stones and had a girlfriend back in the world named Judy? If so, I still have the picture you sent me of her on your lap when you got out of the service. Nice to hear from you.Kermit Cartwright:\n\nActually, It was a white guinea pig instead of a rat. I taught myself enough German so that I could ask for a dead guinea pig at the pet shop in Zirndorf if one ever died. After getting out of the Army I took taxidermy in college. I found this website and started trying to locate Lt. Paul Rines. His daughter later contacted me and informed me that her father had passed away from cancer. I’m still looking for other friends like James Batoolewick. I know that he was from Detroit and I think that his family was in the mafia. If anybody knows him tell him to call me at 423-697-7433. After eighteen years I found Rick Deridder.He lives in Bridgewater, New York I think that he was in Service battery.He was a mechanic. That was above A battery in the new barracks on the back side near the ball fields. The last night that I was at Pinder barracks Rick and I climbed that big tower on the back side of Pinder and hung my boots up there. I thought that I had done something big. It’s a wonder that I didn’t get killed or worst thrown in the brig. Does anybody remember First Seargent Brantley, Supply seargent Miller. Sgt Miller was always playing his guitar and singing , “You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille.” Would love to hear from anybody that was at pinder, especially A battery1/22 Fld Artillery. 1974 to 1976123) SP4 Alan Watson harveyman@charter.netLocation:\n\nNewton, NC.

Had a great time as long as I was in the field, or else downtown after evening formation. Spent most of my time at the big Pizzeria with Octavio, Mama. Loved their pizza and their version of lasagna in a stoneware dish. Loved their venersnittzel as well. Of course the Zirndorfer Bier washed it all down well. We used to hang in the summer at the swimbat with the young german chics and the army brats. Spent alot of money on music, Rock concerts, film, and good smoke. Had some rough times in Nurnberg at times with the nationals who didn’t dig americans, but had alot of friends who took me places I otherwise would have never visited while there. Sad to see the barracks torn down too, but I believe the reason was because we just had too good of a time there in Zirndorf you know? God bless all you gunbunnies, medics, cooks, officers, nco’s, and shithead enlisted men.
