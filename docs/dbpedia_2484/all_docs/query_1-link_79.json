From 2009-2010, I was an active member of the AUTOSAR mode-management working group and I made contributions to the AUTOSAR 4.0 specification. I received the BaCaTec scholarship and was part of the research group of Prof. Michael Franz and Andreas Gal (compiler squad) at the University of California, Irvine (USA) in 2005/06.
