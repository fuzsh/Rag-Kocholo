        "text": "September 9, 2021\n\nCHARLOTTE – Michael Bauer Miller, age 45, died peacefully at home on Thursday, September 9, 2021 surrounded by his family. Mike survived childhood cancer and recently battled a four-year fight with colon cancer. He was an inspiration to so many people who were amazed at how he stayed positive and maintained a never give up attitude as he faced cancer related medical challenges throughout his life.\n\nMike was born near Toledo, Ohio and lived in Brighton, Michigan until the family moved to Charlotte in 1985. Mike had a passion for sports and was a die-hard fan of the Michigan Wolverines and all teams Detroit: Lions, Tigers, Pistons and Red Wings. He was a graduate of Charlotte Catholic High School and received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree and a Master of Accounting degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and became a CPA. He started his career with Arthur Andersen and later joined Deloitte. In 2011, Mike joined Food Lion/Ahold Delhaize and most recently served as Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis for Retail Business Services until his passing.\n\nMike also had a passion for supporting families navigating the challenges of childhood cancer. He was involved with Charlotte based Camp C.A.R.E. (Cancer Ain’t Really the End) an organization that provides a week of camp and other year-round activities for children with cancer. He started as a camper at age 10, served as a camp counselor for over 20 years and ultimately served as the volunteer Chairman of the Board of Directors for many years before his passing.\n\nMike is survived by his loving wife, Jada, and faithful dog, Eli; his parents, Paul and Diane Miller of Charlotte; his siblings, Mark and his wife, Susan of Winston-Salem and Matt and his wife, Shelly of Charlotte and Amy Walters of Charlotte. He is also survived by his nephews and niece, Nick and Katherine Miller and Alex, Kyle, Kevin and Luke Walters and in-laws, Roger and Shirley Watkins of Bostic, NC. He was preceded in death by his maternal grandparents, Louis and Alice Bauer, and paternal grandparents, Dr. Ernest and Leone Miller.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to all who have prayed and cared for Mike over the years. The family extends a special thank you to Dr. Kunal Kadakia and Dr. Joshua Hill with Levine Cancer Institute. Mike really enjoyed and appreciated all the visits from friends during his last couple of weeks. We will miss Mike’s enduring quick wit, love of family and friends and courage to embrace life to the fullest.\n\nMike will be remembered with a memorial service to be held at 3:00 PM Friday, Sept. 17, 2021 at Myers Park United Methodist Church, 1501 Queens Road, Charlotte, NC 28207. The family will receive friends at the church from 1:30 to 2:30 PM. The service will be livestreamed at https://livestream.com/mpumc/funeral. Per Mike’s wishes, a reception will be held at Sir Edmond Halley’s, 4151 Park Road in Charlotte following the service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Mike requested memorials be offered in his memory to Camp CARE, in care of The Mike Miller Memorial Fund, PO Box 35072, Charlotte, NC 28235 or at www.CampCARE.org."
