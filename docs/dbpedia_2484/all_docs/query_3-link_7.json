Education: University of Queensland, B.A. and Dip.Ed., 1977.\n\nADDRESSES: Home—Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Agent—c/o Author Mail, Omnibus Books/ Scholastic Australia, 335 Unley Rd., Malvern, South Australia 5061, Australia.\n\nCAREER: Writer and educator.

The novel's main character is a fourteen-year-old boy named Joseph. A talented artist, Joseph is asked by the woman who lives next door to paint a portrait of her brother Tom, a withdrawn, unsociable man who is known around town primarily because of his status as a Vietnam veteran. Behind Tom's constant scowl and dark moods is an even darker history that Joseph must unlock in order to clearly capture the man on canvas. Joseph's quest to make sense of his older neighbor despite his own shyness also helps the teen deal with his own childhood turmoil and help him avoid the scars that have so clearly damaged Tom.\n\nBauer studied English at the University of Queensland, and now teaches English and economics on the secondary-school level in the city of Brisbane, where he was born and still lives with his wife and two children. Discussing his second career as a writer on the Scholastic Australia Web site, he noted: \"I have always been interested in writing and over the years have dabbled in song lyrics, short stories and poetry with no real thought of ever being published. For quite a few years I kept diaries where I would write about my experiences and innermost feelings in verse heavily disguised by symbols and images. Looking back I think this was probably a good way of developing and improving writing skills without realizing it.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nMagpies, November, 2004, Jo Goodman, review of The Running Man, p. 39.\n\nONLINE\n\nAustLit Web site, http://www.austlit.edu.au/ (September 26, 2005).\n\nCurriculum Materials Information Services Web site, http://www.amlib.eddept.wa.edu.au/ (December 19, 2005), Les Strong, review of The Running Man."
