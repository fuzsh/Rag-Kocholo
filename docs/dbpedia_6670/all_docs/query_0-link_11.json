When it is stolen, it’s up to 4 smart, savvy kids to get it back. They’re aided by characters that have been displaced from the book and magically brought to life – Cinderella, Captain Hook, some of Peter Pan’s Lost Boys, several Fairies and many more. Will they be able to recapture the book and return the magic of reading to the world? Come and find out, and bring the whole family along to this delightful comedy, full of catchy, memorable songs and characters that are laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nBook by: DAVID SIMPATICO, Songs by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil; Ray Cham, Greg Cham and Andrew Seeley; Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn; Andy Dodd and Adam Watts; Bryan Louiselle; David N.

Basketball team captain and resident jock, Troy, discovers that the brainy Gabriella, a girl he met singing karaoke on his ski trip, has just enrolled at East High. The couple cause an upheaval when they decide to audition for the high school musical. Although many students resent the threat posed to the \"status quo,\" Troy and Gabriella’s alliance might just open the door for others to shine as well.\n\nBook by: Michael Stewart Music and Lyrics by Jerry Herman Based on the play: The Matchmaker by: Thornton Wilder Original Production Directed and Choreographed by: Gower Champion, Directed by: Kevin Dutcher\n\nThis musical adaptation of Thornton Wilder’s hit play, “The Matchmaker” bursts onto the stage with humor, romance, energetic dance numbers and some of the greatest songs in musical theatre history. It’s the story of Dolly Levi, a strong-willed matchmaker, as she attempts to find a match for the miserly \"well-known unmarried half-a-millionaire\" Horace Vandergelder. Along the way she also succeeds in matching up the young and beautiful Widow Molloy with Vandergelder’s head clerk, Cornelius Hackl; Cornelius’ assistant, Barnaby Tucker, with Mrs. Molloy’s assistant, Minnie Fay; and the struggling artist, Ambrose Kemper, with Mr. Vandergelder’s forlorn niece, Ermengarde.\n\nMrs. Levi tracks Vandergelder from his hay and feed store in Yonkers to Mrs. Molloy’s hat shop in New York, out onto the streets of the city and finally to the most elegant and expensive restaurant in town.
