        "text": "You’ll emerge humming the clothes from “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,” the crude, overlong, fantastically colorful musical that opened Monday night at the Palace Theatre. You want your costume pageants served up with wit and genuine emotion? For that, check out “Hairspray” or “La Cage Aux Folles,” two competing West End musicals that couple drag with a direct appeal to the heart. “Priscilla” has its sentiment-laden passages that turn decidedly sticky toward the close of a show clocking in near the three-hour mark. By that point, however, you may be too overcome by dancing paintbrushes and cakes, not to mention headgear reaching straight to the roof, to care. Let’s put it this way: when one character shows up wearing leather fringe, the sartorial simplicity comes as visual respite.\n\nThat the show isn’t more satisfying on other levels is both a disappointment and a surprise, given the enduring appeal of the 1994 Australian film from the writer/director Stephan Elliott and a British stage debut of real panache from Tony Sheldon, a musical theater star Down Under who skillfully inherits the part of Bernadette, formerly known as Ralph, played by Terence Stamp in the film. (Mr. Sheldon has been with the stage adaptation since its inception.) Advising at one point, “Never forget the cost of our choices, my friends,” this Bernadette serves as a reminder of the not inconsiderable price paid by those who live outside the mainstream, as all three of the drag artists at the show’s lavishly appointed core do. And yet, barely have we had time to take in the remark before Simon Phillips’s production is off once more, lurching from outrageousness to camp and back again, a bit of audience participation thrown in for those spectators who are keen to, as they say, get down. (If that isn’t you, sit well away from the aisles.)\n\nThe narrative itself is the inverse of “Mamma Mia!,” to cite the mother ship of jukebox musicals to whose global success this show presumably aspires. Whereas that ABBA-scored musical tells of a young woman on the eve of marriage who is keen to discover the identity of her father, “Priscilla” sends Jason Donovan’s pinched-looking Tick, aka Mitzi, on a bus journey across the Australian Outback in search of his 6-year-old son. Their encounters along the way throw homophobes, rednecks and a kindly mechanic in their path. In the end, of course, a spirit of tolerance prevails, alongside an eclectic potpourri of numbers that you probably never expected to hear in the same evening: “Both Sides Now,” for instance, followed some while later by “MacArthur Park.”\n\nThe hard-won wisdom of Mr. Sheldon’s Bernadette aside, the material doesn’t offer the characters much to actually act, and one quickly yearns for some relief from the braying laugh of Oliver Thornton as Adam, otherwise known as Felicia, the part so winningly played by Guy Pearce on screen. (Adam, we’re told early on, has a “body by Baywatch,” and the show affords ample opportunity for theatergoers to decide for themselves.) Long after the “whore moan” (get it?) double entendres have palled, what you remember are the set designer Brian Thomson’s evocatively simple suggestions first of Sydney Harbor, then Ayers Rock, and costumes from the Oscar-winners Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner of almost overwhelming profligacy. Therein, I suppose, lies the ultimate joke of a musical that plunders pre-existing songs and a superior film without bringing much new to the party. Even as the stage “Priscilla” is marking time, the clothes rock.\n\nThe women in “Madame de Sade,” at Wyndham’s through May 23, really are women, though several of Richard Mawbey’s wigs might give the “Priscilla” crew pause. The sight of Judi Dench sporting a ’do that wouldn’t look out of place in the finale of “Hairspray” is one of the enticements of this third out of four consecutive productions at the same address from the director Michael Grandage, who has followed such relatively safe choices as Chekhov’s “Ivanov” and that Shakespearean evergreen, “Twelfth Night,” with a Yukio Mishima rarity. Those who go to the theater expecting lots of movement and animation are advised to stay on the “Priscilla” bus.\n\nThe fact is, “Madame de Sade” is static but never boring, at least not with a cast that includes the redoubtable Dame Judi, now 74, in her first London theater appearance in three years. The choice of play on her part honors a commitment to adventuresome repertoire shared by her friend and exact contemporary Maggie Smith, who was herself last seen in London several years ago in an Edward Albee play, “The Lady From Dubuque,” that divided opinion as “Madame de Sade” is sure to do. Some early commentators have seemed personally affronted by the absence from a play informed by the misdeeds of the Marquis de Sade of the very miscreant who allowed the word “sadism” into the language. Well, Beckett’s “Waiting For Godot,” due for a return West End go-round in May, similarly keeps the elusive Godot well off stage: someone doesn’t have to be front-and-center, in either art or life, to leave a lasting impression on those in his or her midst.\n\nAnd it’s nice, given the all-male world of so much drama, to find a play that really does give six actresses a chance to shine; between this venture and the Old Vic’s female-dominated “Dancing At Lughnasa,” women are doing very well at the moment on the London stage. The problem lies with a text, at least in Donald Keene’s translation from the Japanese, that redefines the word overripe. “Your breasts, your belly, your thighs, were plastered like an octopus all over the usages of society,” Rosamund Pike’s Renée, the ornately spoken Madame de Sade of the title, remarks late on to her mother, Madame de Montreuil, whom Ms. Dench plays with her singular mixture of asperity and wit. (The Oscar-winning actress missed several performances last weekend because of an ankle injury but is due back in the production this week.) For all the talk of whips and restraints, bloodletting and orgies, the script itself often sounds like phone sex as it might have been practiced in the pre-electronic early days of the French Tricolor.\n\nMs. Pike, in particular, spends much of the play impressively aquiver, as if erotic shock waves were coursing beneath Christopher Oram’s richly pleated costumes; Mr. Oram, too, designed the silvery, sparsely furnished chamber that is the single location, its shimmering surfaces glisteningly lit by the excellent Neil Austin. Some might suppress the odd giggle at the various set pieces where the stage darkens, Lorna Heavey’s projections go into overdrive, and one or another of these human repositories of guilt and lust has something resembling a seizure. (On more than one occasion, the ladies fall to the floor in what can only be called a crise de crinoline.) But I was impressed by the sustained elegance of what is on view set against the moral and physical filth and squalor just beyond the play’s borders. If only Renée and her Revolutionary set could have met up with Bernadette and that lot: girls, both shows tell us, though with wholly different results, do just want to have fun."
