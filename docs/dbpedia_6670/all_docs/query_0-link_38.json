        "text": "Know Theatre is thrilled to announce the regional premiere of COCK by Mike Bartlett as our next mainstage production. This will be only the second American production following its premiere at the Royal Court Theatre, London. COCK opens April 12, 2013 and runs through May 11, 2013. Brian Robertson, who currently teaches in the Theatre and Dance Department at Northern Kentucky University, will direct this production. Some of his past directing credits include Camelot at the Carnegie Visual and Performing Arts Center and A Flowering Tree at Cincinnati Opera. COCK features performances from Darnell Pierre Benjamin, Kevin Thornton, Danielle Knox, and George Alexander.\n\nIn this tense comedy about sexual identity, COCK explores one man’s choices about which path of love to pursue. When John takes a break from his longtime boyfriend, the last thing he expects is to fall in love with a woman. Trapped between two lovers, John feels the physical and emotional tug of both, and neither party wants to lose the battle for his heart. John has a choice to make as he navigates his sexuality, selfhood, and the intersection of the two.\n\nWithout scenery or props, COCK allows the audience to focus on the relationships between the characters and opens a dialogue about what we’re physically attracted to and why. This feisty and energizing piece is an exercise in emotional carnage with quick-paced dialogue that suggests to-the-death battle of the characters. Each character, with the exception of John, knows what he or she wants and is willing to fight to get it.\n\n“I had the chance to check out this production while visiting New York for the American Theatre Wing award ceremony, and I loved it,” says Eric Vosmeier, Producing Artistic Director. “It’s a kind of pansexual love story that’s told very simply without all of the trappings of a traditional production. A very simple set, no props, minimal lighting and sound all conspire to allow the actors and Mr. Bartlett’s text to truly take center stage and to shine.”\n\n“This is one of the first victories of Know Theatre’s new scheduling model. Rights for this production have only just become available and because we’ve created a schedule that can bend and flex, we’ve been able to schedule a production almost immediately. We’re thrilled to be one of (if not the) first post-New York production of this work.”\n\nCOCK made its world premiere at the Royal Court Theatre, London in November 2009. In May 2012, COCK made its US premiere at The Duke, New York.\n\nAll tickets are $15 in advance and $18 on the week of the show, beginning Mondays at noon. Tickets can be purchased by visiting knowtheatre.com or calling 513.300.5669. Flex-passes are valid for this event. This production features bleacher style seating.\n\nIf you are unable to print the title of the play, we suggest “Cockfight Play.”\n\nProduction Team\n\nDirector – Brian Robertson\n\nScenic & Lighting Design – Andrew Hungerford\n\nCostume Design – Noelle Wedig\n\nSound Design – Doug Borntrager\n\nProduction Dates\n\n8pm: April 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, May 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 & 11 3pm: April 28 & May 4\n\nAdditional Information\n\nMike Bartlett (Playwright) – Mike Bartlett is currently Associate Playwright at Paines Plough.
