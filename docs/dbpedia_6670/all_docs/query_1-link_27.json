        "text": "I understand that you’ve\n\nhad a very varied stage career, including a long stint in drag,\n\nhaven’t you?\n\nWell, yes. I’ve done Les\n\nMiserables, Chicago, Rent\n\nRemixed and Phantom in the West End and\n\nStarlight Express on tour, but I also did\n\nPriscilla, Queen of the Desert for three years as\n\nwell. Can you believe that?\n\nSo you’re no stranger to\n\nappearing on stage in lingerie then!\n\nNo. I vowed, when I finished\n\nPriscilla, that I was going to go into something\n\nvery serious and not put the fishnets and heels back on – but I got\n\noffered the role and I just couldn’t say no. I just felt I had to\n\ndo it. It really has such a draw.\n\nI have to say that I really surprised\n\nmyself because I very much like my home comforts and the thought of\n\ngoing out on such a huge tour terrified me but, again, the draw of\n\nFrank pulled me out of that comfort zone as well. I think it’s just\n\none of those roles that, if you are lucky enough to get offered it,\n\nyou just have to say yes.\n\nAnd, of course, you’re\n\nfollowing in some mighty footsteps!\n\nOh no, please don’t say the “T”\n\nword!\n\nWell, I wasn’t just\n\nthinking of Tim Curry, but David Badella has had the part for a\n\nwhile now as well.\n\nYes, he did it for four years. I went\n\nto see him doing it and he was just superb. I suppose that the thing\n\nis, I mean, of course I’m completely terrified – who wouldn’t\n\nbe – but I really believe in Chris Luscombe, our director. I\n\nthink he is just fantastic.\n\nWhen I met him, after he called me to\n\nask if I would be interested in doing it, I knew after just five\n\nminutes of being with Chris that I would be in good hands. He’s\n\nfantastic and I really respect the fact that he’s taking it\n\nseriously as well because I think that it’s what this show needs.\n\nIt’s for the audience to enjoy but\n\nfor us to – kind of – take seriously, in terms of telling the\n\nstory and all of those things that come with putting on a good\n\nproduction. So I trust that he saw something in me to make him think\n\nI could do it and I trust that it will be a fantastic version of the\n\nshow and I’ll do my very best to do it justice.\n\nChris’s last two\n\nproductions – Dandy Dick and Blue/Orange\n\n– were just spectacular.\n\nI went to see his production of\n\nSpamalot this week and it’s a great show, but\n\nthe thing that I loved so much about it was that the direction was so\n\nefficient. There was nothing in there where you felt like maybe they\n\ndidn’t know what they were doing. It was all so clear.\n\nEverything\n\nwas “bang on the money” and I think that’s where he really\n\nsucceeds. There’s nothing in there that you, as an audience member,\n\nmight feel was lost. Chris has got a really clear vision and\n\nthat’s what we need as actors. We need the director to come to the\n\ntable with a really strong vision of what he thinks, and what he\n\nwants, and then we create it around that.\n\nSo, you’re not worried\n\nabout popping the high heels back on again then?\n\nWell, after three years it’s nothing\n\nnew to me so I’m giving Ben Forster (Brad) lots of lessons. When\n\nI first did Priscilla, I was completed terrified\n\nabout wearing them. I had never ever done any form of… well\n\nactually Rocky Horror isn’t drag, whereas\n\nPriscilla is much more along those lines. I had\n\nnever put on high heels or lingerie or any of that, but I have to say\n\nthat I think it stood me in good stead. I feel a lot more confident\n\nabout doing it.\n\nI am a little concerned\n\nthat, as someone is going to spend the entire production in lingerie,\n\nyou don’t regard this as drag!\n\nI think the thing is that they are two\n\ndifferent things. In Priscilla the part is much\n\nmore of a “showgirl” and was drag in a very traditional\n\nAustralian sense. It was a different thing because it was more about\n\nwanting to look like a woman with very feminine gestures, those kinds\n\nof things, whereas I think Frank is much more sexually ambiguous and\n\nI think that is incredibly important."
