        "text": "As an ardent fan of Rocky Horror, I was delighted to learn that the 40th birthday tour would be a new production – the previous tour was excellent, but an anniversary tour deserves its own revisions.\n\nThe keystone for any such new production lies in the casting of Dr Frank N Furter, and publicity began with a ‘Who’s Frank?’ viral campaign leading into the eventual announcement that Oliver Thornton was to be our new mad scientist. This was great news for many, not least since he’d already demonstrated an ability to play flamboyant maniacs in killer heels in his last major outing as Felicia in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\nThe enthusiastic and costumed crowd were whipped up into a frenzy before the show even began. The Usherette appeared in front of an old blood red cinema curtain to set the mood with Science Fiction/Double Feature, then sweeped the curtain back to reveal new staging that embraced the show’s B-movie roots. The inital scenes were filled with cartoonish innocence as Brad & Janet pledge their love for one another and set off on their journey; after a flat tyre they find Frank’s castle and before long we’re all doing the Time Warp in a grand and gothic ballroom. The attention to detail is pleasing – mounted trophies adorn the walls, but of dodo not deer – feeding Brad’s suspicion that this is probably some sort of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.\n\nWe jump left and step right, and are then sat down in antici…pation for the arrival of Frank. He bursts on stage and is at once athletic and naughty, gymnastically parading around the stage with legs that Ann Miller would eat her heart out for. Before Sweet Transvestite has even ended, the crowd have welcomed Oliver to the Rocky family with fevered screams of approval which go on for minutes. He laps them up and purrs “I could do this all night!” before inviting us up to his laboratory.\n\nThe lab looks great with remnants of previous experiments hanging on the slab. The birth of Rocky feels much more like a mad scientist’s creation here than the previous tour’s building of an airfix plaything. I was initially surprised at the casting of Rhydian in the role, but he was actually one of the better Rocky’s I’ve seen, with good comic timing and a great voice. A strip of celluloid tops the stage from which Magenta and Columbia later observe the bedroom scenes, during which Brad’s facial expressions are so hilariously exaggerated that they could even be seen clearly from the Upper Circle.\n\nPhilip Franks is an excellent Narrator and is well-versed in the audience participation callbacks, which still manage to surprise many of the audience. The ‘adult panto’ aspect of Rocky Horror means the audience themselves can often affect the mood of a performance; thankfully ours were more restrained during the more tender moments of the show such as I’m Going Home, delivered by Oliver Thornton perched at the edge of the stage in full torch song diva mode.\n\nThis is definitely one of the greatest Rocky Horror casts and productions I’ve seen. Even a fluffed line as Frank mistakenly refers to Riff Raff as Rocky was dealt with in character – “I care so little about you I can’t even be bothered to get your name right!”\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show is on tour across the UK throughout 2013. We’ll definitey be going again for more, more, more!\n\nCast:\n\nThe Narrator – Philip Franks\n\nFrank – Oliver Thornton\n\nBrad – Ben Forster\n\nJanet – Roxanne Pallett\n\nRocky – Rhydian\n\nRiff Raff – Kristian Lavercombe\n\nMagenta – Abigail Jaye\n\nColumbia – Ceris Hine\n\nEddie/Dr Scott – Joel Montague\n\nMale Phantoms – Christos Dante, David Gale\n\nFemale Phantoms – Maria Coyne, Rachel Grundy\n\nSwing – Andrew Ahern"
