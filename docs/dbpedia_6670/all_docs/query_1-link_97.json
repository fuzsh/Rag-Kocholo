        "text": "Last week we went to see the Rocky Horror Show in the New Theatre in Cardiff. Well, it was an experience! I have seen the film a couple of times but have never been to see the musical that I had heard such good things about. So when I saw an advert for it coming to Cardiff, I immediately booked tickets!\n\nI dragged along my boyfriend, who was a little apprehensive at first, especially when I told him that most of the audience will be dressed up. He also looked slightly worried when I told him that most of the men would be dressed in drag – this was primarily down to the fact that he thought he was going to have to dress up in a leather corset and fish net stockings – however I put his mind at rest when I told him he didn’t have to.\n\nSaying that, the amount of effort that had gone into the costumes of audience members was brilliant and we actually looked like the silly ones not in fancy dress!\n\nHere are a few of my personal favourites:\n\nThe performance was what I thought – fun, fun and more fun! The audience plays such a huge part in making this musical like no other with dancing, singing along and heckling at the stage a common theme throughout. I loved the hard core fans of this show who not only sung along but knew the play word for word.\n\nI loved Philip Franks as Narrator who made lots of local references to Cardiff and demonstrated brilliant heckle handling skills and comic timings.\n\nMy personal favourite however was Welsh actor Oliver Thornton who played transvestite Frank-N- Furter. All I can say is, what incredible legs. He rocked the fish net stocking and garter look better than most women! In addition to that, he put on a brilliant performance.\n\nFor my boyfriend who had no idea what the Rocky Horror Show was about, well he was gob smacked, but found it thoroughly entertaining. He was even on his feet during the Time Warp!\n\nThere wasn’t an empty seat in the house and the atmosphere definitely made it a night to remember."
