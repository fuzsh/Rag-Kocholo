Gale was born and raised in St Louis, Missouri, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BA in Cinema from the University of Southern California in 1973, where he met and began his association with his longtime collaborator, Robert Zemeckis.\n\nGale has written or co-written over 30 screenplays and his other film credits include 1941, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Used Cars, Trespass and Interstate 60, the last of which he also directed. In addition to his film and television work, and being the ‘Gatekeeper’ for the BTTF franchise, Gale has written comic books including Spider-Man, Batman and IDW’s Back to the Future title, thus proving to his father that he did not waste hours and hours reading comics in his youth. He has given talks on screenwriting in colleges across the USA, and enjoys meeting fans at comic conventions and Back to the Future events. He has also served as an expert witness in over 25 plagiarism lawsuits, even though this has occasionally required him to wear a suit and tie. When he’s not in production, writing, or wasting time on the internet, he actually does take out the trash, even when his wife doesn’t ask (well, sometimes he does). Gale lives in California with his wife and dog. Back to the Future the Musical is his first foray into writing for the stage.\n\nROBERT ZEMECKIS won an Academy Award©, a Golden Globe and a Director’s Guild of American Award for Best Director for the hugely successful and popular Forrest Gump. The film’s numerous honors also included a Best Picture Oscar and for Tom Hanks, a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nEarly in his career, he co-wrote with Bob Gale and directed Back to the Future, which was the top-grossing release of 1985, and for which Zemeckis shared Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Original Screenplay.

With a credit list of over 100 films, Silvestri has composed some of the most recognisable and beloved themes in movie history. His efforts have been recognised with two Oscar® nominations, two Golden Globe nominations, four Grammy® awards, two Emmy® awards, and numerous International Film Music Critics Awards, Saturn Awards, and Hollywood Music In Media Awards.\n\nBorn in New York City and raised in Teaneck, New Jersey, Silvestri first dreamed of becoming a jazz guitar player. After attending the Berklee School of Music in Boston, he hit the road as a performer and arranger. Landing in Hollywood at the age of 22, he found himself successfully composing the music for 1972’s The Doberman Gang which established his place in the world of film composing. The 1970s witnessed the rise of energetic synth-pop scores, establishing Silvestri as the action rhythmatist for TV’s highway patrol hit CHiPs. This action-driven score caught the ear of a young filmmaker named Robert Zemeckis, whose 1984 hit film, Romancing the Stone, was the perfect first date for the composer and director. Its success became the basis of a decades- long relationship that continues to this day. Their numerous collaborations have taken them through fascinating landscapes and stylistic variations, from the Back to the Future trilogy to Toontown in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, the tension of What Lies Beneath and Death Becomes Her, to the cosmic wonder of Contact; the emotional isolation of Castaway, to the magic of The Polar Express, to Zemeckis’ 1994 Best Picture winner, Forrest Gump, for which Silvestri’s gift for melodically beautiful themes earned him an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination. This 38-year, 21-film collaboration includes such recent films as Flight, Allied and The Witches based on Roald Dahl’s 1973 classic book. Zemeckis and Silvestri are currently working on Walt Disney’s Pinocchio starring Tom Hanks, which is scheduled for release in September of 2022.\n\nThough the Zemeckis/Silvestri collaboration is legendary, Silvestri has scored films of every imaginable style and genre. His energy has brought excitement and emotion to the hard-hitting orchestral scores for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, James Cameron’s The Abyss as well as Predator 1 and 2 and The Mummy Returns. Alan’s diversity is on full display in family entertainment films such as The Father of the Bride 1 and 2, The Parent Trap, Stuart Little 1 and 2, Disney’s Lilo and Stitch, The Croods as well as Night at the Museum 1, 2 and 3 while his passion for melody fuels the romantic emotion of films like The Bodyguard and What Women Want.\n\nIn 2018-19 Alan composed the music for Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. These films are the culmination of a partnership with Marvel that began in 2011 with his dynamically heroic score for Captain America: The First Avenger followed by The Avengers in 2012. Alan’s collaboration with Marvel helped propel The Avengers: Infinity Saga to spectacular worldwide success.\n\nSilvestri’s success has also crossed into the world of song writing. His partnership with six-time Grammy Award-winner Glen Ballard has produced hits such as the Grammy-winning and Oscar- nominated song ‘Believe’ (Josh Groban) for The Polar Express, ‘Butterfly Fly Away’ (Miley Cyrus) for Hannah Montana The Movie, ‘God Bless Us Everyone’ (Andrea Bocelli) for A Christmas Carol and ‘A Hero Comes Home’ (Idina Menzel) for Beowulf. In addition to Back to the Future the Musical, Alan and Glen continue their long collaboration with new songs for the upcoming Robert Zemeckis production Pinocchio for Disney, scheduled for release in September 2022.\n\nSix-time Grammy Award®-winner Glen Ballard is one of popular music’s most accomplished producers and songwriters, whose records have sold more than 150 million copies worldwide. In 2023 Ballard was selected to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Through his Los Angeles-based production company, Augury, Ballard is developing a diverse slate of projects in which music plays a central role. Ballard’s most recent project is Netflix’s The Eddy: a music-driven multicultural drama about a jazz band trying to survive in chaotic modern-day Paris, which debuted in May 2020. Ballard wrote and composed original songs and music for the limited series and served as an executive producer, alongside Damien Chazelle, Jack Thorne, and Alan Poul. Augury is a producer of the stage adaptation of 1985’s Back to the Future having worked on the project’s development for more than 14 years\n\nBallard wrote original lyrics and music for Ghost the Musical, which debuted in 2011 and has since been touring worldwide. Ballard is writing songs for the stage version of the 1979 movie The Rose, to be produced by Gail Berman, Michael Gorfaine and Sam Schwartz in association with Augury. Ballard produced and co-wrote Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill (33 million worldwide, four Grammys, and named Best Album of the Decade by Billboard magazine), and in 2019 a musical called Jagged Little Pill featuring all of the songs from the album debuted on Broadway. Directed by Diane Paulus with a book by Diablo Cody, the musical Jagged Little Pill was nominated for 15 Tony Awards in 2020.\n\nBallard has written and produced songs for Quincy Jones, Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand, Dave Matthews, Shakira, Katy Perry, Idina Menzel, George Benson, Ringo Starr, George Strait, Wilson Phillips, Van Halen, Chaka Khan, Patti Austin, Al Jarreau, Andrea Bocelli and many others.\n\nHis production credits include producing and arranging records for Annie Lennox, No Doubt and POD. Ballard co-wrote and arranged ‘Man in the Mirror’ for Michael Jackson and co-wrote and produced the Grammy winning and Oscar-nominated song ‘Believe’ (Josh Groban) for the feature film The Polar Express. His work in film includes writing original songs for Charlotte’s Web, Beowulf, The Croods, The Mummy’s Return, and Disney’s live-action Pinocchio.\n\nOlivier Award winning producer Colin Ingram has worked in the theatre industry for 28 years with some of the world’s leading producers, directors, designers and writers.
