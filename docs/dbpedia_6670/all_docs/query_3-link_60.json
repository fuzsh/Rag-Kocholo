        "text": "Vivian Thurman and I attended the opening night performance of Ed Sylvanus Iskandar’s bold new interpretation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, featuring the music of Duncan Sheik, at Shakespeare Theatre Company’s Sidney Harman Hall in Washington D.C. on May 24, 2016.\n\nThe all-male cast includes Maulik Pancholy (Broadway: It’s Only A Play) “Weeds,” “30 Rock”) and Peter Gadiot (“Once Upon a Time in Wonderland”) as Katherina and Petruchio, and features two-time Tony nominee André De Shields (Ain’t Misbehavin’, The Wiz, The Full Monty, Play On!) as Gremio/Curtis/Vincentio; Oliver Thornton (West End: The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables) as Bianca; Drew Foster (Doctor Zhivago) as Biondello; Rick Hammerly as Widow; Telly Leung (Allegiance, Godspell, Rent, Pacific Overtures and Flower Drum Song) as Lucentio; Gregory Linington as Grumio; Matthew Russell as Tranio; Tom Story as Hortensio; Bernard White as Baptista; with James Crichton, Stephen Elrod, Jamison Foreman, Jackson Knight Pierce, Brian Reisman and Nicholas Yenson rounding out the Ensemble.\n\nSpilling from the stage into the lobbies and the street, director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar’s production presents a provocative new approach to The Taming of the Shrew and an utterly unique audience experience.\n\nNoted for his epic and immersive style, Iskandar extends the world of the production beyond the stage, creating a deeply engaging experience for audience members. In line with this vision, STC invokes the atmosphere of an Italian piazza (the Piazza d’Amore) in the Harman lobbies and offers audience and community members the opportunity to engage with the performers of The Taming of the Shrew off-stage preshow, during a musical intermezzo and postshow.\n\nPRESHOW\n\nTHE MUSICAL INTERMEZZO\n\nVivian and I got a glass of prosecco from the minibar and headed onstage to enjoy the musical intermezzo with other audience members.\n\nPOSTSHOW\n\nAfter the curtain call, audience members had the opportunity to mingle with the actors in the lobby.\n\nThe creative team includes Scenic Designer Jason Sherwood, Costume Designer Loren Shaw, Lighting Designer Seth Reiser, Sound Designer Jeremy S. Bloom, Choreography by Chase Brock, Music Supervisor/Arranger David Dabbon, Music Director Jody Schum, Associate Costume Designer Dana Burkart and Assistant Lighting Designer Jimmy Lawlor. Iskandar is supported by Voice and Text Coaches Gary Logan and Ellen O’Brien, and assisted by Production Stage Manager Joseph Smelser and Assistant Stage Manager Robyn M. Zalewski. Craig Baldwin serves as Immersive Designer and Iskandar’s Assistant Director.\n\nOPENING NIGHT PARTY\n\nAndré De Shields as Vincentio. Costume Design by Loren Shaw.\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew began preview performances on May 17, and continue through June 26 at STC’s Sidney Harman Hall (610 F Street NW) in Washington D.C.
