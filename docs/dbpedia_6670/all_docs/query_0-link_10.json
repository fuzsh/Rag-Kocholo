        "text": "Q: Where are you from?\n\nA: I’m originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. I have also lived for many years in New York City, as well as in Chicago and Los Angeles for brief periods.\n\nQ: What made you become interested in theater?\n\nA: My family. When I was a child, my parents were great devotees of the theater, especially of musicals, so I grew up going to see shows with them in New York and Boston, even Washington DC. Later on, for a period in the 1980s my folks were theater critics, so we went all around the greater Boston area seeing various professional productions. My mother is also a performer and so I became immersed in the practice of theatre both onstage and off at school and in local productions for as far back as I can remember.\n\nQ: Where are you from?\n\nA: I’m originally from British Columbia, Canada - the Pacific Northwest region - a supernatural and most beautiful part of the world!\n\nQ: What made you become interested in theater?\n\nA: The inclusive, collaborative, and creative community of the theater. It provided (and still provides) me with a great sense of belonging - a sense of making the world a better place. I think that is what theater and the arts are meant to do for our society.\n\nQ: What aspect of theater intrigued you the most?\n\nA: My love of musical theater. I’m a song & dance man for sure! I spent many years singing, dancing, and acting in summer stock and loved every moment of it.\n\nThe arts and entertainment showcase in the Northwest Corner will continue its tradition of pairing extraordinary talent from Broadway and television with talented local actors from the Litchfield, Dutchess, Westchester, and Columbia county regions.\n\n“We’re incredibly excited for our 2023 Season lineup with two sought-after musicals, two thought-provoking plays, and four inspiring youth theater productions. The Sharon Playhouse truly has something for everyone!” – Managing Director, Rod Christensen\n\nThe 2023’s Summer/Fall lineup will include the playhouse premiere of the musical comedy Something Rotten by John O’Farrell, Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick (June 23-July 9); the iconic musical classic Oliver! by Lionel Bart (August 4-14); the timeless tale Our Town by Thornton Wilder (Sept. 15-24); the clever, Broadway hit, The Lifespan Of A Fact by Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell (Sept. 29-Oct. 15); and during the Summer, four undeniably fun youth theater productions: Peter and the Starcatcher, A Year With Frog and Toad, Kids, and Disney’s Newsies JR., and Sharon Playhouse Stars.\n\nAnd back by popular demand are the Playhouse's innovative and provocative staged readings, which, like last season’s The Scarlet Letter by Kate Hamill with Gretchen Mol and Tim Blake, and Marie Antionette by David Adjmi with Lauren Ambrose, will be sure to engage and delight its audiences.\n\nIn addition to the mainstage productions, reading series, and youth theater programming, the Playhouse plans to bring even more special events, cabarets, concerts, and community engagement to the town of Sharon and beyond - making this arts & cultural hub a year-round theater for all!\n\nEncore Corner is a special recurring section of The Sharon Playhouse Newsletter where we will list things we need other than money.\n\nThese things may be as small as a pencil sharpener or as big as a used car or the temporary loan of an unused room in your home or guest house. We are always looking for housing for our performers. It could include specific supplies for our offices, props for a production, accessories or necessities for use by the actors and crew members who live in our dorms. It could be a request to help fill a need we consistently have. For example, we can always use copy paper, scotch tape, and bottled water.\n\nIf you are decluttering, reorganizing, downsizing, simplifying your life, and looking for a place for things you no longer want or need -- think of us, check out this Encore Corner! And then call Wendy, our Business Manager at 860-364-7469 X100 or write to her at Business@sharonplayhouse.org. You can drop stuff off or for bigger things, we can schedule a pick-up.\n\nAnd remember -- The Sharon Playhouse is a non-profit 501(c)(3) arts organization. Your donation is tax deductible to the full extent of the law. We will provide you with an acknowledgement of your gift for tax purposes along with the statement that no goods of services were provided to you in exchange.\n\nThank you in advance!"
