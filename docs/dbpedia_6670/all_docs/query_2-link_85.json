        "text": "Jazz is all about the contrast between the individual and the collective, and few recordings embody that as beautifully as \"Stolen Moments,\" the opening track from Oliver Nelson's 1961 hard-bop record The Blues and the Abstract Truth.\n\nOn this episode, Kirk dives deep into Nelson's classic tune, starting with his dense horn arrangement, then considering the three improvised horn solos as distinct creations that reflect the at-times wildly different ambitions of each individual player. Also, there's jazz flute.\n\nWritten by: Oliver Nelson\n\nPerformed by: Freddie Hubbard (tpt.), Eric Dolphy (alto/flute), Oliver Nelson (tenor), George Barrow (bari), Bill Evans (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), and Roy Haynes (drums).\n\nAlbum: The Blues and the Abstract Truth (1961)\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Amazon | Spotify\n\nALSO FEATURED/DISCUSSED:\n\n“Moanin” by Bobby Timmons, played by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers on Moanin', 1959 (rec. 1958)\n\n“So What” by Miles Davis from Kind of Blue, 1959\n\n“Hoe Down” and “Butch and Butch” by Oliver Nelson from The Blues and the Abstract Truth, 1961\n\n“Hyperballad” by Björk from Post, 1995\n\n“Tutti Frutti” by Little Richard, 1955\n\n“Kiss” by Prince from Parade, 1986\n\n“Give Me One Reason” by Tracy Chapman from New Beginning, 1995\n\n“Blue 7” by Sonny Rollins from Saxophone Colossus, 1956\n\n“Giant Steps” by John Coltrane from Giant Steps, 1960\n\nOUTRO SOLOIST: Kirk Hamilton\n\nKirk is the host of Strong Songs.
