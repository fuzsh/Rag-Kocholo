        "text": "I would like you to meet the one and only Carrie St. Louis! Carrie will be reprising her role of Annette Hargrove (played by Reese Witherspoon in the Film) in the upcoming Cruel Intentions in Concert on Sunday December 19th at The Bourbon Room in Los Angeles (A role she also played in the sold-out Off Broadway run in 2017). Carrie has performed on Broadway in Wicked, Rock of Ages, and Kinky Boots and on TV in series such as Younger, Blindspot, and Elementary. The 90's kid in me loves everything that is (you guessed it) 90's, so to feature a talent such as Carrie is a true joy. Having seen her perform in the past on several occasions, I can strongly attest that this concert is one you don't want to miss. I am so happy to feature Carrie St. Louis!\n\nHow old were you when you knew you wanted a career in the performing arts?\n\nI was in my first musical when I was 7 which was Oliver!. I played the highly coveted role of Singing Milkmaid #2 and was hooked right from the start. I thought if you did the choreography faster than everyone else, it meant you were the best, so I was on and off that stage before my parents could even catch a glimpse of me!\n\nWhere did you study? Are there any mentors or teachers who truly helped you become the amazing artist you are today?\n\nI studied classical voice in high school at Boston University and then went to be an opera major at USC's Thornton School of Music. I had so many impactful teachers! Three months out of college, I got Sherrie in Rock of Ages and had a month to get my voice ready for a rock musical 8x a week. My voice teacher in Los Angeles, Rachael Lawrence, got me in tip-top shape, and I will forever be grateful for her guidance.\n\nThe 90s kid in me is very excited for your upcoming concert of Cruel Intentions: The 90's Musical. What about this show appeals most to you?\n\nOh, it's just so much fun!! Every time a song starts, a new wave of nostalgia comes flooding back. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. Grab a cocktail and sing along to your favorite 90's jams-- my ideal escape!\n\nYour career has been wonderful and so inspiring. Are there any shows, performances, or moments that stick out and will always be near and dear to your heart?\n\nThat is so sweet! Thank you! I feel very lucky. Anytime my parents and/or grandparents are in the audience, it feels very special. I still have pinch-me moments daily. Performing \"For Good\" for First Lady Michelle Obama at the 2016 United Nations conference was a huge highlight for me. I was geeking out.\n\nWhat advice would you give any young performers who want a career in the performing arts?\n\nI would say to put yourself in class, always be studying, and always be learning. Go in for everything even if you don't think you're right for it or it will never happen. You never know, and no matter what, you'll get practice! My favorite quote is \"Luck is opportunity meeting a prepared mind.\" Stay ready, stay prepared.\n\nCruel Intentions in concert will reunite multiple original cast members from the LA & Off-Broadway productions of the musical, including Carrie, Constantine Rousouli, Janel Parrish, and Frankie Grande. The concert which features the show’s beloved 90’s songs by such artists as No Doubt, Counting Crows, R.E.M. Christina Aguilera, Goo Goo Dolls, and *NSYNC, will be performed for an in-person audience while also streaming worldwide on Stellar.\n\nCheck out Carrie singing Jewel's \"Foolish Games\"."
