The latter will appear as a singing Sarah Palin. Show time each night is 7:30 PM. Steven Brinberg has performed his Streisand impersonation on stages in Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Houston and the U.K. He recently completed a sold-out tour of the U.K. and the West End, following record-breaking runs at London's Playhouse and Jermyn Street theatres. Brinberg is the winner of the MAC Award and the Bistro Award for his Simply Barbra performances. He also appeared in the workshops of Ken Page's musical Nightlife and can be heard on \"Simply Barbra Duets.\"\n\nBrinberg will also perform at The Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona Oct. 24 and 25. Stateside, he will be seen in Asbury Park, NJ (Dec. 4) and at a gala holiday benefit at Symyphony Space in Manhattan (Dec. 20).\n\nFor more information visit www.theshawtheatre.com or www.simplybarbra.com."
