        "text": "Your serious theatre chums might be busy discussing Dido, Queen of Carthage at the National, but you're more interested in real West End royalty. Joseph himself, Jason Donovan, is back in Theatreland: corseted, bell-bottomed and sequined in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Strewth!\n\nIf anyone raises an eyebrow at your exultations, remind them that the musical, although \"gaudy, garish and loud\" (according to a slightly deafened Michael Billington), is based on a film with \"a touch of the art house about it\" (thanks, Charlie Spencer). Add, as Spencer does, that it's \"10 times more enjoyable than the screen version\".\n\nYou always meant to see the movie, of course, but somehow never quite got around to it. So beware the bluffer's pitfall: Donovan, despite playing a drag artist, isn't the Priscilla of the title. The eponymous hero is in fact a bus that takes Tick (Jason's character) and his glam pals (Tony Sheldon and Oliver Thornton) from Sydney to Alice Springs. The journey serves two purposes: a grand casino show at their destination and a reunion for Tick and his estranged son.\n\nYou may wish to agree with Michael Billington that the show is \"as much about costumes as content\". Expand on these outrageous outfits by detailing – as the Evening Standard Nicholas de Jongh does – the \"ridiculous belle epoque corseted dresses and hats variously piled heavy with fruit, flowers and feathers\". All of this, you explain, \"artfully exploits the fact that drag queenery relies on excess and exaggeration\". There are so many feathers, in fact, that you share the Telegraph's \"fear for the survival of the ostrich as a species\". After those ornithological observations, you can't help but swipe a line from Benedict Nightingale in the Times: \"The most outrageous swirl of costumes that I, who have seen La Cage aux Folles and even boggled at Ian McKellen's Widow Twankey, have yet encountered.\"\n\nNext, you are \"delighted to report\" – like Charles Spencer – that \"insanely euphoric and wildly contagious vulgarity prevails\". Express wonder, as the Independent's Michael Coveney does, at lyrics that manage to rhyme \"hormone with whore moan and demands that somebody shuts his von Trapp\". But agree with the FT's Ian Shuttleworth that the book \"almost seems intent on stomping on every brain cell in the film and replacing every iota of sentiment with cheap schlock\".\n\nNow move on from the original songs to the jukebox hits the show rolls out. Marvel at the opening number, Downtown, which impressed Nicholas de Jongh with \"three divas suspended high above a silver-spangled bridge\". Take your cue from De Jongh that it was a sensible move to exchange \"the Abba songs used in the film for mainly gay disco and glam rock hits\".\n\nForget the songs and the costumes, though – what about Our Jase? You're torn here between Michael Coveney and Charles Spencer's verdicts. Coveney says Donovan has \"lost what little stage personality he had developed as Joseph … and turned, well, rancid\". Spencer reckons Donovan is \"engagingly gauche and touching as a gay man facing up to the responsibilities of fatherhood\". Perhaps the best solution lies in Michael Billington's cautious praise: \"Jason Donovan lends Tick the right air of paternal longing,\" you offer. Or you may decide, as the Stage does, that \"the star of this show is Tony Sheldon as the classy, aging transsexual Bernadette\". And Priscilla herself, so says Benedict Nightingale, is a knockout: \"wheels turning, steel body swivelling, innards a weird mix of rainbow chairs and model flamingos\".\n\nQuip that the musical \"makes Mamma Mia! seem like something by Chekhov\" (Spencer), but before your friends get carried away with disco fever, end on a serious note (stolen, naturally, from Billington). \"Given the unexplored richness of Australian theatre,\" you declare solemnly, \"it is a pity that this artistically buoyant country should now be represented in the West End by this garish throwback, in which camp is determinedly overpitched.\"\n\nDo say: Putting the out into outback\n\nDon't say: Desert storm"
