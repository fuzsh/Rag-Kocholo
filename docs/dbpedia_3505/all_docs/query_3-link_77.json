        "text": "Those who have seen the first season of Bridgerton will know that in addition to love, drama, costumes and settings, it offered unforgettable characters, such as the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page), whose love story with Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor) was at the center of the story. Since March 25, the second will focus on the adventures of Viscount Anthony (Jonathan Bailey), determined to find a wife. But his feelings confuse him and slide him into a triangle with the young woman he is courting, Edwina (Charithra Chandran) and her sister Kate (Simone Ashley).\n\nThey are two of the new characters that bring the long-awaited chapters of the creation of Shonda Rhimes (Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, Inventing Anna). What I Can See selected the top 10 of season 2, some of which are recurring but will reveal new facets.\n\n1. Kate Sharma\n\nKate is the main character in this Bridgerton cycle. Lady Mary Sheffield Sharma's stepdaughter returns to London, from India, with her family. His immediate goal is to look for a good match for his sister on the part of his father, Edwina.\n\nIt is not a future she imagines for herself: her idea is to establish herself as a single woman, since she has great autonomy and mistrust men. Her strong will — sometimes stubborn — made her refuse the services of Lady Danbury, her sponsor in London society who hoped to marry her. Instead, as the guardian of her sister, she has become the filter of candidates.\n\nHowever, it was enough for Anthony Bridgerton to start courting Edwina for his emotions to disrupt his plans. Even with his family's interest as a north, he can't ignore how he feels about the viscount.\n\nBefore being Kate, Simone Ashley, 26, worked on Sex Education and Pokémon Detective Pikachu, among other titles.\n\n2. Anthony Bridgerton\n\nThe eldest of the Bridgerton brothers inherited the title of viscount after the tragic and untimely death of his father, Edmund. While he looks ambivalently at his patriarchal position, he is in charge of family business and during season 1 he did his best to control the prospects of his sister Daphne. His feelings for opera singer Siena Rosso were opposed to his duties as a viscount: to find a wife and to have an heir to the title.\n\nThis “libertine with a capital L”, according to the literary saga by Julia Quinn on which the series is based, left his lover to meet the family, but soon regretted it and tried to recover it. Since he couldn't, he is now willing to settle down. The prospect of Edwina being his viscountess seems fine to him, until his dog-and-cat relationship with Kate begins to transfigure.\n\nJonathan Bailey is known for his roles in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Jack Ryan and Crashing. He has also worked in musical theatre (he won a Laurence Olivier Award for his work in the play Company) and has been a jury member of RuPaul's Drag Race: UK vs the World.\n\n3. Edwina Sharma\n\nKate's younger sister is her soul mate: one of the strongest streams of love this season will be the brotherly one that unites them. Ever since Queen Charlotte called her “the diamond of the season”, Edwina can't wait to go to all the dances and evenings and shine in London society. She also feels particularly safe with Kate by her side.\n\nHis engagement to Anthony Bridgerton seems to be exactly what he wanted, until things turn upside down. Your good heart will play an important role in the development of events.\n\nCharithra Chandran began acting while studying philosophy at Oxford University, and joined the UK Youth Theatre. Her first role was in the series Alex Rider, and Edwina is the second.\n\n4. Lady Mary Sheffield Sharma\n\nHis parents, Lord and Lady Sheffield, from an old English aristocratic family, made him choose between family and love, and Lady Mary chose her feelings. This is how she married an ordinary man who had a daughter from her first marriage, which is why she lost her high place in London society. He moved to India with his new family, in the middle of a scandal. After the death of her husband, Kate and Edwina's father, she returns to London so that the youngest of the girls can find a good husband.\n\nKate arranges with Lady Mary's parents — who for all intents and purposes abandoned her after their marriage — that they will give their daughter a large amount of money if their granddaughter Edwina marries someone they approve of. But the Sheffields hold a deep grudge and the deal with Kate will be affected by that.\n\nLady Mary is played by Shelley Conn, whose previous work includes the series Liar, The Lottery and Strike Back.\n\n5. Newton\n\nHe doesn't say a word all season 2, but he will steal the hearts of audiences: Newton is Kate's dog, who will shine much brighter than Queen Charlotte's Pomeranians in the first. In the novel he is described as “a corgi somewhat overweight”, but this representative of Queen Elizabeth II's favorite breed is in admirable shape.\n\nAs he rushes to welcome visitors, he is the first to form an opinion, and in general Kate usually agrees with him. Despite its small size, it takes the protection of its owner very seriously.\n\nAustin, a Welsh Corgi Pembroke, plays Newton.\n\n6. Penelope Featherington\n\nSpoiler alert if you didn't see the first season of Bridgerton!\n\nA new social season begins and a new stage of gossip columns begins by Lady Whistledown, the alter ego of the innocent Penelope Featherington, whose voiceover is played by Julie Andrews. The secrets of London's high society will reoccupy the double life of the young woman, whose secret identity is in danger: Queen Charlotte investigates who Whistledown really is.\n\nThe youngest daughter of Lady Portia Featherington and the troubled (and dead at the end of the first season) Lord Archibald Featherington was introduced into society earlier than he would have wished and hides his crush on Colin Bridgerton. Although he gets bored at parties, he has turned them into a lucrative news and secrets business. Her best friend is Eloise Bridgerton.\n\nNicola Coughlan, the Irish star of Derry Girls, plays Penelope.\n\n7. Theo Sharpe\n\nThe young apprentice knows nothing about London's high society until Eloise Bridgerton shows up at the print shop where she tries to master a trade and asks about Lady Whistledown, whom she has denounced — not knowing that she is her friend — at the women's rights meetings she attends. The two young people come together for the research and discover that they have a lot in common, at least when it comes to radical ideas.\n\nCalam Lynch is Theo. Her previous works include roles in the films Dunkirk and Benediction, and an appearance in the series Derry Girls.\n\n8. Lady Danbury\n\nShe led her godson, the Duke of Hastings, in his courtship of Daphne and is now mediating the love of another Bridgerton, as the sponsor of the Sharma. In fact, he did much more for Simon: as he was a dear friend of his mother, he cared for and educated him after her death and the father's rejection. While there is a big heart beating in his chest, his words can hurt like bullets.\n\nShe is played by Adjoa Andoh, whom audiences have known since Liar, The Witcher, Invictus and Doctor Who.\n\n9. Eloise Bridgerton\n\nThe feminist of the family will also be presented in society during this season, something she considers ridiculous. However, the passage also worries her. He nearly discovered Whistledown, and in the new chapters he will restart the investigation together with the printer's apprentice Theo Sharpe.\n\nClaudia Jessie plays the daring and witty Eloise, and makes her dream that she is up for better plans than getting married. She previously wore models from the regency period in the Vanity Fair series. He also starred in Lovesick, Call the Midwife, and Doctor Who."
