        "text": "In \"Sunset Boulevard,\" faded movie star Norma Desmond laments that she is still big, it's the pictures that got small.\n\nThey have gotten even smaller since then, until today people watch movies on cellphone screens.\n\nYet film directors flock to shows like \"Treme,\" \"Dexter\" and \"The Killing\" because they can take the sorts of creative chances that can be too risky to take on more expensive theatrical films.\n\nThis TV season, \"Milk\" director Gus Van Sant directs the first episode of Kelsey Grammer's political series \"Boss\" on Starz; and earlier this year \"I'm Not There\" director Todd Haynes directed the HBO miniseries \"Mildred Pierce.\"\n\nEven Martin Scorsese, a giant of American cinema, has migrated to TV. On Sunday, he won an Emmy Award for directing \"Boardwalk Empire.\" Season 2 of \"Boardwalk,\" the gangster series set in Atlantic City, N.J., during Prohibition, returns to HBO on Sunday.\n\n\"Living in the Material World,\" Scorsese's two-part George Harrison biography, premieres Oct. 4 on HBO.\n\nBut Steven Spielberg is the fairy prince of all screens, big and small.\n\nHis career began in 1971 with the TV movie \"Duel,\" and he later produced such series as \"Amazing Stories\" and \"Tiny Toons.\" Years ago, when he produced the NBC series \"seaQuest DSV,\" I visited Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment on the Universal Studios lot and remember - perhaps fancifully - that the offices resembled a treehouse.\n\nMonday, Spielberg returns to prime-time network TV with one of the most anticipated shows of the new season: \"Terra Nova,\" on Fox. He is the show's executive producer, but everything about it - from dinosaurs to time travel - feels sprung from Zeus' head.\n\nWith their re-imagining of the B-movies of their youth, Spielberg and George Lucas are credited and blamed for creating the blockbuster syndrome that dominates the multiplex each summer.\n\nBut while Lucas' \"Star Wars\" was a nostalgic nod to the Saturday matinee serial, Spielberg films like \"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" took the sci-fi genre to infinity and beyond.\n\nAlthough Spielberg has released three slightly different versions of \"Close Encounters\" over the years, he hasn't otherwise digitally tinkered with it, something Lucas continues to do with the \"Star Wars\" films. The Milwaukee Film Festival will have a rare 35-millimeter screening of \"Close Encounters\" next Friday at the Oriental Theatre, with the film's Oscar-winning cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, in attendance and at a question-and-answer session.\n\nThe knock against Spielberg has always been that, while his films are visually unparalleled, the storytelling is juvenile and the characters wooden. This holds as true for \"Close Encounters\" as for \"Terra Nova.\"\n\nThe show is set in a dystopian future so polluted that people wear masks to breathe and so overpopulated that families are limited to two children. So when a cop, played by Jason O'Mara, and his wife, played by Shelley Conn, have a third child, he is imprisoned.\n\nBut when his wife and kids are selected to travel through a \"Stargate\"-like device and start a civilization 36 million years in the past, he escapes prison to join them. The cumbersome setup leads to predictable set pieces in lush prehistoric surroundings, controlled by a military governor, played by macho graybeard Stephen Lang from \"Avatar,\" who may be a benign ruler or crazed despot.\n\nHere, the \"Swiss Family Robinson\" vibe (also found in the Spielberg-produced cable drama \"Falling Skies\") surrenders to the darker, conspiracy-themed visions of \"Lost,\" with the revelation of armed \"others\" living outside the outpost's walls and mysterious markings in nearby caves, and Spielberg's own \"Jurassic Park,\" as digital dinosaurs have their prehistoric way with everyone.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon. Because dinosaurs aside, without mystery and conflict, \"Terra Nova\" feels like \"Lost in Space\" in reverse.\n\nWITI-TV (Channel 6) photojournalist Clinton Fillinger was issued a citation by Milwaukee police Sunday at a house fire.\n\nAccording to www.mediabistro.com, Fillinger \"was shooting video behind police tape when an officer requested he turn off the camera; Fillinger refused resulting\" in a scuffle. He was cited for resisting and obstructing a police officer.\n\nThe Radio Television Digital News Association expressed \"profound dismay\" at the citation, and asked that the charges be dropped. Fillinger \"was doing nothing more than his job, on a public street, behind police and fire lines, within his rights and within reason,\" according to a letter the RTDNA sent to the MPD.\n\nSal Dimicelli of Lake Geneva has been named one of CNN's 10 heroes of 2011. Dimicelli was chosen from more than 10,000 applicants. His nonprofit group, The Time Is Now to Help, buys food and pays bills for about 500 people a year.\n\nThe hourlong premiere of \"Modern Family\" Wednesday beat the much-hyped premiere of Fox's reality talent show \"The X-Factor.\" \"Modern Family,\" produced by University of Wisconsin-Madison alum Steve Levitan, earned a 6 rating among viewers 18 to 49, vs. 4.2 for \"X-Factor.\""
