        "text": "Shelley Conn of Mistresses fame plays a pregnant career woman in the haunting new ITV drama Marchlands. She tells Kate Whiting why the role made her broody at a time when she’s taking on Hollywood\n\nShelley Conn’s star is on the ascent.\n\nThe actress best known for her role in BBC drama Mistresses has been hand-picked by Steven Spielberg to star in his latest TV project Terra Nova and, at the end of the month, she’s appearing as Paul Rudd’s girlfriend in romcom How Do You Know?\n\nBut if Hollywood’s calling has gone to her head, she’s not showing it. Instead, she’s incredibly down-to-earth, apologising for being forgetful.\n\nShe’s just returned from Australia where she’s been filming the pilot of Terra Nova and she’s a little jetlagged.\n\n“It’s lovely to get the tick from Steven Spielberg,” she concedes, quickly adding: “I’ve been very lucky.\n\n“I still feel like I’m play-acting really – every day in Australia I’d wake up and think, ’I cannot believe I’m doing this’. I never forget how fortunate I am.”\n\nBarnet-born Conn, who’s strikingly pretty with sparkly dark eyes and long glossy hair, is back in Britain to promote her new drama for ITV, Marchlands.\n\nIt’s a ghost story set across three time periods, following different families living in the same house in the 1960s, 1980s and present day.\n\nThe drama unfolds through the eyes of Nisha, a high-flying and pregnant career woman, who moves into Marchlands with her partner to prepare for the birth of their first child.\n\n“There’s a lovely connection to Mark’s past because he grew up in the village, but there are spooky things that keep happening in the house,” says Conn.\n\n“At first Nisha’s quite bewitched by them, she finds it quite enchanting, almost as if the past is speaking to her, but very quickly it becomes unsettling and she’s not sure if she’s going mad.”\n\nThe star-studded cast includes Anne Reid, Alex Kingston, Jodie Whitaker and Dennis Lawson, with Whitaker playing a mum in the 1960s who’s grieving for the death of her little daughter Alice.\n\nIt soon transpires it’s Alice’s ghost that’s haunting the house – and who appears to be an imaginary friend of Alex Kingston’s character’s daughter in the 1980s.\n\nAlthough Conn, 34, didn’t get to work with most of the actors, she says she felt “privileged” being the character who takes the audience on a voyage of discovery.\n\nAnd, while it was a challenge, she enjoyed playing a pregnant woman. “I started to get used to my bump – it was very much a part of my character,” she says, smiling.\n\n“At the time I had two pregnant sisters, one at the later stages of pregnancy, like Nisha, and the other sister was at the very early stages of pregnancy – we weren’t really supposed to know she was pregnant.\n\n“My elder sister who’d already had a child said, ’I really don’t like the way pregnancy’s often portrayed on TV, so I really hope you get this right’, so it was like, ’Oooh, pressure’, but it was really helpful because I had these two great points of research.”\n\nTo prepare for a scene where she’s in labour, Conn did some research online and was surprised by what she found.\n\n“I’m amazed at how many people put their home births on YouTube, but it was great for me. I put all the links on an email and sent them all to Elliot Cowan who’s playing Mark, so he could get an idea and one morning he arrived and was traumatised by having seen these home births!”\n\nLuckily the experience hasn’t put off Conn, who’s dating actor Jonathan Kerrigan, from having children. In fact, it had the opposite effect.\n\n“It made me quite broody actually, especially being around all those newborn babies!”\n\nBut with the first series of Terra Nova due to start shooting in the spring, thoughts of having a family may have to be put on hold for the time being, as Conn “commutes” to Australia.\n\n“It’s a concept I’m still trying to get my head around,” she admits. “It’s a long way away, but it’s also a nice place to be.”\n\nContracts for US TV shows tend to be longer than those in the UK, and actors can often be tied in for as many as seven years before the first show has even aired.\n\n“You have to view it as a win-win situation,” says Conn. “If it doesn’t go down well or it’s no good, then obviously the show is cancelled and you’re free, but if it’s good then you want to do it, so I feel you can only benefit from those kind of contracts.”\n\nTerra Nova is a sci-fi drama centred around the Shannon family, who are sent back in time 85 million years from an apocalyptic 2149 to join a colony trying to give civilisation a second chance.\n\nConn, who auditioned and was “overwhelmed” to get the part, plays mum-of-three Elizabeth, who is selected to join the colony because, as a doctor, she has key skills.\n\nWhile she can’t give away too many details, she does say: “85 million years ago there were quite a lot of dinosaurs, so it’s good to have Steven Spielberg on board!”\n\nIt’s clearly a dream come true for the London girl, who always knew she wanted to be an actress. “There was nothing else I could imagine doing.”\n\nShe studied drama at university and then went to drama school, before landing TV roles in shows including Merseybeat and Casualty, both of which also starred her boyfriend Jonathan.\n\nIn 2009, she flew to Philadelphia to film her brief but pivotal role in romcom How Do You Know?\n\n“I dump Paul Rudd, but I free him up to have the relationship story with Reese Witherspoon, so I see myself as doing a good deed,” she jokes.\n\nShe’s keen to do more film: “I’ve had small parts in larger scale films and big parts in smaller films, so I’d like to explore, definitely.”\n\nBut she’s also aware that her profession comes with its drawbacks. “It comes with its compromises, you do have a bit of a nomadic life, and it takes its toll - I feel like I’ve missed so many family occasions and I miss my partner terribly, but you make up for it.\n\n“You travel, and that’s a privilege to be able to see as much of the world as I have. I know I wouldn’t have been able to do that if it wasn’t for the job. And I think it’s quite nice if you get to miss people, it makes it more special when you do see them.”\n\nEXTRA TIME – SHELLEY CONN\n\nShelley Conn was born in Barnet in 1976.\n\nShe doesn’t think of herself as famous, but that could change with her role in Terra Nova.\n\nHer first screen role was as ’Nurse 2’ in 2000’s adaptation of Ben Elton’s Inconceivable, Maybe Baby, alongside Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson.\n\nLike her character in Marchlands, she believes in ghosts and says in one old house she shared with her partner in Bristol, she felt somebody “hit me on the back”.\n\nShe thinks we’re in a golden age of drama in the UK, thanks to recent US imports making us “up our game”.\n\nMarchlands begins on Thursday, February 3 on ITV1"
