Instead of some lame disease, or a runaway, or murder because of a gambling debt of all things, we got a genuine conflict between the Sixers and the colony as well as a definite look at how deadly the land they live in can be. Something that […]Read On »\n\nCast: Jason O’Mara, Christine Adams, Byron Brockmann, Shelly Conn, Stephan Lang, Simone Kessell, Landon Liborion, Allison Miller Director: Nelson McCormick Writers: Paul Grellong Network: Airs on Fox, Mondays @ 8pm Original Telecast: Oct. 31, 201 Adultery and crimes of passion … is this really what TERRA NOVA should be focusing on five episodes into its 13 episode run in the first season? I don’t think so as the show has already struggled with finding its core mythology and sustaining entertaining ideas and storylines in the first few episodes. Instead shouldn’t we be learning more about why the Sixxers are banished […]Read On »\n\nCast: Jason O’Mara, Christine Adams, Byron Brockmann, Shelly Conn, Stephan Lang, Simone Kessell, Landon Liborion, Allison Miller Director: Jon Cassar Writers: Barbara Marshall Network: Airs on Fox, Mondays @ 8pm Original Telecast: Oct. 17, 201 So, hey, when are we getting some dinosaurs in your dinosaur TV show? TERRA NOVA was billed as a JURASSIC PARK meets LOST with a dash of AVATAR, yet for the most part this show has been dinosaur-free instead focusing on lame storylines involving the Shannon family, troubles teens have with girls (and boys), rebellious moonshine making other teens and a whole host of plotlines […]Read On »\n\nCast: Jason O’Mara, Christine Adams, Byron Brockmann, Shelly Conn, Stephan Lang, Simone Kessell, Landon Liborion, Allison Miller Director: Nelson McCormick Writers: Byrnn Malone Network: Airs on Fox, Mondays @ 8pm Original Telecast: Oct. 10, 201 I really thought the dinosaurs in the pilot episode of TERRA NOVA were pretty good, well, as long as they didn’t move and just sat there looking big and dumb, but these last two episodes, wow, the special effects have gone from SyFy Channel quality to a notch above Ray Harryhausen. OK maybe that’s a bit harsh. Much like the special effects, the storylines in […]Read On »\n\nCast: Jason O’Mara, Christine Adams, Byron Brockmann, Shelly Conn, Stephan Lang, Simone Kessell, Landon Liborion, Allison Miller Director: Jon Cassar Writers: Rene Echevarria, Brannon Braga Network: Airs on Fox, Mondays @ 8pm Original Telecast: Oct. 23, 2011 So I missed last week that TERRA NOVA doesn’t necessarily take place on our Earth’s past. It actually is a similar past, but in a somewhat alternate reality of our own. That’s why the dinosaurs are very similar, but different as well as the other plant and animal life. That’s especially funny given the opening animation for the show depicts all of Earth’s […]Read On »\n\nCast: Jason O’Mara, Christine Adams, Byron Brockmann, Shelly Conn, Stephan Lang, Simone Kessell, Landon Liborion, Allison Miller Writers: Kelly Marcel, Craig Silverstein, Brannon Braga, David Fury Director: Alex Graves Network: Airs on Fox, Mondays @ 9pm Original Telecast: September 26, 2011 Many of you probably never watched the BBC science fiction series OUTCASTS, if you had, you’d know the eerie similarities that it shares with the premise of TERRA NOVA, Fox’s new science fiction/action show. In OUTCASTS, the world has gone so much to hell that they made the choice to abandon the planet in favor of a new habitable […]Read On »"
