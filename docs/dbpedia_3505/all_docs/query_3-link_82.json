        "text": "Spoilers ahead for Season 2 of Good Omens on Prime Video.\n\nGood Omens returned in the 2023 TV schedule to quite literally go off-book, as the plot continued past the events of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's original novel. This involved a big expansion on Beelzebub's story, and not just because Bridgerton alum Shelley Conn stepped in to play the Lord of the Flies. Conn got a fittingly gruesome debut as Beelzebub in the first episode of the season, which involved \"vomiting\" flies all over David Tennant as Crowley.\n\nShelley Conn spoke with CinemaBlend at the Good Omens Season 2 press junket prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike. After she explained what shocked her about her transformation from Bridgerton's Lady Mary into the Lord of the Flies, I asked the actress about her reaction to seeing the finished product of Beelzebub once this visual effects of the flies were added. Conn explained:\n\nShelley Conn's incarnation of the character certainly got a memorable introduction! Beelzebub dropped in uninvited on Crowley while he was sitting in his car, fresh off a fight with Aziraphale about what to do with the amnesiac Gabriel. Fittingly, the Lord of the Flies' arrival was preceded by flies swarming in the Bentley, before Beelzebub turned up, entirely made up of flies. In fact, Conn herself was hardly recognizable until the scene switched to Hell, and David Tennant was apparently \"very gracious\" about the actress pretending to vomit on him. All in a day's work on Good Omens!\n\nOf course, Beelzebub wouldn't have been entirely recognizable without the flies and Crowley helpfully pointing out that the Lord of the Flies was sporting a new face. Scheduling prevented original actress Anna Maxwell Martin from returning for Season 2, and Good Omens acknowledged the switch by stating that Beelzebub was ready for a face change. Gabriel noted the change as well when he didn't even realize who he was speaking to in the pub in Scotland, but it clearly didn't stop him from falling in love with his Hellish counterpart, with a little help from Buddy Holly and \"Everyday.\"\n\nOddly enough, Gabriel and Beelzebub got the happiest ending of any Good Omens pairing in Season 2, although it happened in a way that may mean that Jon Hamm and Shelley Conn wouldn't reprise their roles even if the show is renewed for Season 3. The Good Omens Season 2 ending saw the former representatives of Heaven and Hell disappear off into the stars together, with the understanding that they would never be able to return. Neither one was unhappy about that, but I know I'd be happy to see them back again!\n\nUnfortunately, there is currently no news of whether or not Prime Video subscribers will actually get a third season from Neil Gaiman and the cast members whose characters are still in the mix. The Season 2 finale of course ended in a painful cliffhanger for Crowley and Aziraphale with the latter returning to Heaven and the former refusing to go with him, with Muriel – who had not been entirely prepared for Crowley and Aziraphale's shenanigans – in charge of the bookshop."
