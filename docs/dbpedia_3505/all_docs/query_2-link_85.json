        "text": "\"My best present that I received last year was from Simone. We both have dogs, and she had the exact lid for a can of dog food that would fit on my cans of dog food. So, she brought it into work,\" Andoh told Insider ahead of the season-two premiere on March 25.\n\nThe actress said she reacted as though Ashley, who portrays Kate Sharma, had presented her with a \"diamond bracelet.\"\n\nUp to that point, Andoh \"hadn't been able to find anything that fit so perfectly.\"\n\nAnd the gifts kept coming. While Conn, who plays matriarch Mary Sharma, was getting to know Andoh during filming, she noticed that vodka seemed to be her costar's alcohol of choice. So, the \"Good Omens\" star found an \"obscure\" bottle of the liquor (one that Andoh had never come across herself, she noted to Insider) and surprised her with it on set.\n\n\"It's just little silly things like that,\" Andoh said, adding, \"They're generous, thoughtful women.\"\n\nThe \"Bridgerton\" cast gift exchange extended beyond the trio, according to Ashley.\n\nThe season-two lead previously told Glamour UK that she and her costar Jonathan Bailey, who reprises his role as Anthony Bridgerton this season, regularly swapped small presents. He sent flowers to her trailer ahead of her first day on set, and she reciprocated the gesture by buying him his favorite snacks.\n\n\"We had a very unspoken rhythm going on in that sense, leaving gifts in each other's trailers,\" she told the publication.\n\nRelated stories\n\nConn, Ashley, and Chandran joined the ensemble cast ahead of the hit show's sophomore season, which loosely follows the storyline in author Julia Quinn's 2000 novel \"The Viscount Who Loved Me.\"\n\nBefore making their debut on the Shondaland sensation, Ashley was known for her role in Netflix's \"Sex Education,\" and Conn appeared in the series \"Terra Nova.\"\n\nAs for Chandran, she landed her role as debutante Edwina Sharma early in her career. In 2021, she earned her first on-screen credit on the show \"Alex Rider.\"\n\nAccording to Andoh, the 25-year-old is \"unbelievably smart\" and showed up to the \"Bridgerton\" set eager to learn the behind-the-scenes intricacies involved with filming a large-scale TV series.\n\n\"She could have done anything she wanted. This is quite early on in her acting career, but she just grabs everything. She wants to know everything,\" Andoh told Insider, continuing, \"She wants to know about camera angles and lighting. She thinks deeply about everything.\""
