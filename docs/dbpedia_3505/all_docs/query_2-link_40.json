        "text": "Actress Shelley Conn first hit our screens more than a decade ago, in shows such as Down To Earth and Mersey Beat. But it was as Jessica in BBC1's Mistresses – Britain's answer to Sex And The City – that she really came to prominence.\n\nSuch was the success of the series that the bright lights of Hollywood soon beckoned for the London–born actress.\n\nShortly after Mistresses ended in 2010, she received the offer of a lifetime from legendary film–maker Steven Spielberg, who invited her to take on the female lead in his new US fantasy drama Terra Nova. Shown on Fox and on Sky1, it only ran for one season, but it marked a turning point in Shelley's career.\n\nSince returning to the UK, she's had parts in hit British shows such as Silent Witness and Heading Out, and this week stars in new BBC1 crime drama By Any Means.\n\nHowever, as she chats to Saturday magazine about the gritty six–parter, she reveals that, as well as professional success, there have been exciting developments in her personal life, too.\n\nAfter much speculation in the press as to whether she would marry her partner of 12 years, Jonathan Kerrigan, she tells us that she has indeed tied the knot, and that the low–key ceremony – kept under the radar until now – happened nearly two years ago.\n\nNot only that, but the 37 year old is now a mother to the couple's 16–month–old son, Oscar. By Any Means, she says, was her frst acting job afer giving birth.\n\n\"I was based in Birmingham for filming, in a fat close to the set, and Jonathan and Oscar both came with me for the duration,\" she says. \"But it was a big adjustment. Oscar would be up at 5am and I'd be trying to get a feed in before I had to be in a car at 6.20am.\"\n\nShe reveals that the other difficulty was trying to keep a lid on her emotions. \"When you're breast–feeding, it messes you up a bit,\" she says. \"I stopped halfway through filming, and I felt so much better.\n\n\"Learning lines and getting into character was the easy part. It was a break from all of the madness!\"\n\nBy Any Means is certainly worlds away from her home life. As straight–talking Jessica Jones, she's a member of an undercover police department willing to go to any length to bring the criminal elite to justice.\n\n\"We catch the criminals who have slipped through the net,\" adds Shelley. \"The ones who found themselves a fantastic lawyer, for example, or who have managed to frame someone else. We are told to get them by any means, and often that's by using the law against itself to execute justice.\"\n\nProduced by the team behind BBC1's Death In Paradise, the series also stars Luther's Warren Brown and Primeval's Andrew Lee Pots, with guest appearances from Amy Nutall (Downton Abbey) and David Harewood (Homeland).\n\n\"Jessica can be ruthless and she relishes the process,\" says Shelley. \"The fun of the show comes in with the plans that they come up with, and Jessica is often a character within a character, going undercover and becoming someone completely different to entrap the criminals. One minute she's a sympathetic shoulder to cry on, the next a seductress.\"\n\nIn the first episode, the team, led by Jack Quinn (Brown), are brought on board when crooked businessman Nicholas Mason (Keith Allen) is acquitted of robbery and murder. But their job is made difcult when it's revealed that a police officer appears to be feeding Mason information.\n\nNow back to being a full–time mum, Shelley is looking ahead to her next project and wouldn't rule out another move to America.\n\n\"I'll go wherever the work takes me,\" she says. \"If something comes along that feels right, the family will come with me.\n\n\"After playing someone so committed to serving justice, I'd love to play a baddie next.\n\nThat would be amazing.\"\n\nBy Any Menas, Sunday, 9pm, BBC1"
