        "text": "Starz’s upcoming supernatural spy thriller TV series The Rook has added two additional actors to its cast. Per Deadline, Shelley Conn (Liar) and James D’Arcy (Dunkirk) are set to star in recurring roles for the series alongside the previously announced Emma Greenwell, Joely Richardson and Olivia Munn.\n\nBased on the novel by Daniel O’Malley, The Rook is adapted by Sam Holcroft and Al Muriel. Greenwell stars as Myfanwy Thomas, a young woman who wakes up in a London park suffering total amnesia and pursued by shadowy paranormal adversaries. Grappling with supernatural abilities of her own, she must fight to uncover her past and resume her position within Britain’s secret service, the Checquy, before the traitors who stole her memory can finish what they started.\n\nConn will play Danielle Wulff, classified as a Chevalier within the hierarchy of the Checquy. Wuff is a high-level operative responsible for creating elaborate cover stories to obscure her agency’s role in shaping geopolitics. Her uncanny ability to synthesize huge amounts of data to control public perception will be tested as the agency’s secrecy comes increasingly under fire.\n\nD’Arcy will portray Dr. Andrew Bristol, an agency operative in forced retirement who holds a key to Myfawny’s past."
