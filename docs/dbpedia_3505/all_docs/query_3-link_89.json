        "text": "Good Omens is back for a second season on Prime Video as Heaven and Hell do battle once more.\n\nAiring from July 28, the return of the fantasy drama sees angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) and demon Crowley (David Tennant) steeped in a perplexing mystery when the Archangel Gabriel (Jon Hamm) turns up naked and very confused at Aziraphale’s bookshop. Although he has no idea about his own identity, he warns of danger. As Aziraphale and Crowley try to find out more, they realise they need to keep him hidden from the forces of good and evil or face terrible consequences.\n\nBut angel Saraqael, Heaven’s head of internal security played by former Silent Witness star Liz Carr is determined to track Gabriel down, as is Hell’s overseer Beelzebub, played by Bridgerton’s Shelley Conn, who takes over the role from Anna Maxwell Martin.\n\nHere, Liz Carr and Shelley Conn talk exclusively to What to Watch about Good Omens season 2…\n\nGood Omens is back! Did you watch the first season?\n\nLiz Carr: “I was aware of the show, but I hadn't watched it. So getting the role, obviously, then I was like, ‘OK, better see what this is all about.’ And it really made me laugh. I didn't imagine it would be as funny as it was, I think there was something where one of Crowley’s acts of demonism was creating the M25. That's really evil! I was sort of hooked with that kind of comedy, I loved it.”\n\nShelley Conn: “I hadn't seen it but I knew of the book. And when I became involved, I did a quick binge of the first season and absolutely loved it. It was really funny, really irreverent and just so creative. It felt like such a gift to be able to join.”\n\nWhat can you tell us about your characters?\n\nShelley Conn: “I play Beelzebub, Lord of Hell. They are obsessed with power and doing whatever is meant to be done at any given moment as hellishly as possible. But there's more intrigue this season. And that was really fun to delve into.”\n\nLiz Carr: “Seraqael is a superior angel, or at least they think they are! They have been around a long time and are very cynical and sarcastic, but also very on it if they have to be. But they are jaded with the world — Seraqael is easily irritated.”\n\nHow do they both react to the fact that Archangel Gabriel has gone missing?\n\nLiz Carr: “This mystery of Gabriel is something we are all trying to solve, and it's a race to get there. Heaven feels like they need to get there first!”\n\nShelley Conn: “Well, Hell needs to get there first! But that's the kind of conflict within this season, which is great. There's the power play that happens between the ranks on each side, which is always hilarious to see people trying to pull status, and then that gets pulled away from them.”\n\nWhat did you make of your costumes?\n\nLiz Carr: “I felt with Seraqael’s costume, because we filmed in Scotland, I was channelling the Bay City Rollers slightly but also Evel Knievel with my zip-up suit! And some of the authority and status is also echoed in areas that are very clever. That's great.”\n\nShelley Conn: “I loved mine! It was inherited from season one and that for me felt like a sort of carrying on of the spirit. And it fitted perfectly, which was a ‘good omen’! There were little touches that were slightly different, I get a hat, I got some gloves, and a little brooch. But for Beelzebub, what's lovely, particularly for fans, is that you can actually make a version up from a charity shop. People do like to dress up as Beelzebub!”\n\nWhat was it like working with David and Michael?\n\nLiz Carr: “They're brilliant. Because they're such good friends and have done many things together, it's like they are just playing, and in between shots, you are just watching them play, and they don't exclude anyone, you can be part of that too. It's just a lovely environment.”\n\nShelley Conn: “Yes it is a joy to work with those two and everybody in the cast who are just at the top of their game. It makes for a delightful job, you bring your creativity and you have to match theirs. For an actor, that's just a gift.”\n\nFinally, why do you think people have taken Good Omens to their hearts?\n\nLiz Carr: “I think the storytelling is just so brilliant. It’s got good stories and such heart, it’s silly and it's fun. It’s a really good show!”\n\nShelley Conn: “I think there's an inclusivity as well. It's come from brilliant minds, and every department is able to bring their 'A' game, from the acting to the set design and the costume and then it's handed to fans and an audience that can really appreciate it on a very heartfelt level. I just think it's got such a universal appeal.”"
