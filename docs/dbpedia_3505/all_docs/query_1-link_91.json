        "text": "When her estranged father dies suddenly, feisty young Indo-Scottish woman, Nina Shah is forced to return home to Glasgow and run the Family-owned Curry House. This reunites her with her childhood friend Bobbi, a Bollywood drag queen and brings her face to face with Lisa, a charismatic young woman to whom Nina’s father sold 50 percent of the restaurant.\n\nAs Nina embarks on a personal mission to win the ‘Best of the West’ curry competition, a highly coveted prize in the world of Indian cuisine, her feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises that she is falling in love with Lisa. Can she win both prizes? If we’re measuring ingredients by heart, this queer Bend it Like Beckham is just right."
