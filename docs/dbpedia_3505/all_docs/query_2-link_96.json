        "text": "Actress Shelley Conn, 36, was in Mistresses and currently stars in BBC series By Any Means. She once wore a pirate costume while working as a children’s entertainer.\n\nHow does this stand out in the crowded cop show marketplace? It’s not really a cop show. We’re not cops, we’re a team who catch the criminal elite by playing them at their own game. We’re clandestine, no one knows about us. So it’s an alternative cop show, I suppose.\n\nDo you have to beat people up? There’s a bit of that. Warren Brown is a world champion Thai boxer so it’s a shame not to use his skills. He’s not only good at the real stuff but he’s really good at doing it for the camera. If I had to do anything physical I’d always check it with him to get his opinion as to how to make it look real.\n\nDo you have anything in common with your character? Not really. She’s much cooler than I am.\n\nWhat inspired you to become an actress? It was something I’d always done. It goes back to playing as a child – my favourite games were role-playing games and using my imagination. I took part in school plays, started studying the literature side of things and just caught the bug. It just felt right.\n\nWhen did you start to pursue it seriously as a career? I did a practical theatre degree, which I took seriously and then told my parents I wanted to go into acting – because up until that point you could still say you were going to become a teacher. So I told my parents and they said: ‘But of course, that’s what we always thought you were doing to do.’ Until then I was still in the acting closet. Then I moved to London and it all started to happen.\n\nDid you get work straight away? Yes. I had periods when I was out of work and I still do – I just don’t worry about them as much any more. My first job was playing ‘Nurse 2’ in a film by Ben Elton called Maybe Baby, and the first actors I worked with professionally were Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson. I was totally star-struck. I got that job on my final day of drama school so it was a nice bridge into the professional world. It was one day on set and I probably wasn’t very professional but people were patient with me.\n\nWhat role has had the biggest impact on your career? Every role has some sort of impact. The two recent ones were the role in Terra Nova, a production for Fox TV in the US – that was a big part, the female lead in a big show like that – and Mistresses was a pivotal moment in my career. It was a great role and created a bit of profile.\n\nWere you surprised when Terra Nova, despite its huge budget, got axed after one series? No. For me it was a win-win situation. I was pregnant and we were shooting it in Australia. The idea of having my baby out there would have been fine but I wanted to be close to my family at the same time. It was a great experience and the show did well, but for whatever reason it didn’t go again.\n\nHas it put you off doing US TV again? No, work’s work. You have to be clear if something like the location of where you’re working doesn’t appeal to you but I’m up for it. As long as it’s an interesting role and somewhere I could live for a while, that’s fine by me.\n\nHave you had any onstage mishaps? I forgot my lines at the end of All’s Well That Ends Well about ten years ago. I remember looking upstage and saw everyone else looking at me and trying not to laugh while I was stumbling my way through it in made-up iambic pentameter. Doing so many performances, I ended up getting stage fright, which is a mishap in itself.\n\nWhat happened? I got to know the piece so well I started to fear it. I didn’t know how to keep it fresh. It’s a terrible feeling to get stage fright.\n\nHave you got over it? I’ve only been on stage a couple of times since then and I remembered that feeling but managed to get though it. If I’m honest, I’d say I’ve slightly avoided theatre since then and need to jump back in.\n\nIs that a bit of a bizarre thing to happen? It’s not as bizarre as you might think – stage fright is a well-known phenomenon. I wouldn’t say it’s an epidemic but acting is an emotional and psychological process which is often a fragile place to put yourself.\n\nWhat’s the worst job you’ve had? When I was studying I was part of a children’s entertainment company and I’d have to dress up as a pirate or fairy and go to corporate parties and entertain the children. I will never, ever do that again. The worst was the demanding children – I’ve never been so exhausted doing a job as that one.\n\nHave you got any unfulfilled career ambitions? I’d really like to play an out-and-out baddie. We’re essentially goodies on this show, so playing someone who isn’t would be fun. I was fascinated by Judi Dench in Notes On A Scandal. She’s an actor who you always get a sense of truth and rightness from but in that film she snuffed that out. There was something rotten in there and I really enjoyed her performance.\n\nBy Any Means is on BBC1 at 9pm on Sundays."
