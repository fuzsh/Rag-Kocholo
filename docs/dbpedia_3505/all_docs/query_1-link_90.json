This time it's set around a curry house in Glasgow, where the lovely Nina (Shelley Conn) has returned for her father's funeral, having fled the city and an arranged marriage three years before. Andrea Gibb's script gestures at the cultural issues that animated East is East, but the way this Scots-Indian family's secrets come tumbling into the open only provokes ridicule. How many bombshells can a mother take from her children in an afternoon? Marrying \"out\", lesbianism and - lawks-a-mercy! - Scottish country dancing. The poor mother remains upright, which is more than I could manage sitting down.",
