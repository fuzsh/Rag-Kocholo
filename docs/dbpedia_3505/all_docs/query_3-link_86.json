        "text": "Turning our attention today to a family comedy mixed with adventure, we look to the Tim Burton directed movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005). Based on the 1964 book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by British writer Roald Dahl, the movie by the same name also is predated by the movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). Dahl received screenwriting credit for the 1971 film, though not the 2005 film direct by Burton.\n\nThe movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory introduces the audience to the underprivileged Bucket family. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter portray the parents to young Charlie Bucket, as portrayed by Freddie Highmore. Four of Charlie’s grandparents lived with his parents and him, with a special connection for Charlie with his Grandpa Joe. David Kelly portrayed Grandpa Joe.\n\nBefore heading deeply into the nature of Charlie’s connection to a chocolate factory, the connection one Willy Wonka has with candy as an adult and into his childhood is introduced. Dr. Wilbur Wonka, dentist, takes a dim view of the confectionary arts for his one and only son. The vocational paths for father and son, as portrayed by Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp, gain voice in their early interactions. Years later, the circumstances for a contest with five prized tickets for entry is hatched.\n\nThe intrigue in for who goes to the chocolate factory stands well in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, functioning as the character introduction needed to learn of the five kids and their accompanying parent or grandparent. For those familiar with the 1971 movie, the sweetness of Charlie is slightly less drawn here. The playfulness rests a bit more with Willy Wonka at this early stage, with the feel of intrigue and charm updated with a more modern sensibility.\n\nThe hallmarks of the chocolate factory are presented with a directness that bespeaks actors defining themselves in their roles with distinctions from the precursor movie. The musical interludes and storytelling capture not so much an air of cautionary tale in parenting style or manner of behavior within the kids. The aim is more for wisecrack and explication of trouble for one Willy Wonka back to childhood. We get a clearer sense of the leading Oompa Loompa. Deep Roy portrayed multiple iterations of an Oompa Loompa in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nThe payoff for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory rests on a handful of factors. First, this movie is more faithful to the source book than it is to the source movie. Second, the sensibility felt heavier and more adult in focusing less on the imaginary and aspirational and more on the notions of different and odd. Finally, getting into the familial for Willy Wonka was an unexpected turn for many, adding a dimension that I found had its own charm. I grant Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as directed by Tim Burton 3.75-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, November 13, 2021"
