Burrow Beaufort, S.C. James “Red” Glover Hampton Ivan E. Morley Elizabethton Photo by Suzanne Whitehead Snow closes Hwy. 143 Saturday THP Trooper Greg Marlowe is pictured on Highway 143, which was closed most of the day Saturday. Traffic was stopped after an 18-wheeler, trying to bust a trail across Roan Mountain, lost traction at the one-mile marker just below the top when the snow became too deep to travel in. The road was snow covered, beginning about 4 miles from the top of the Roan at Carvers Gap. A “C” class wrecker with snow chains was called to help pull the semi-rig to the top, where the driver would have a downhill grade into North Carolina. This photo was taken at mile marker 3, where snow is piled over the guardrail. Marlowe said he hoped to open the road around 3 p.m. after TDOT worked to remove more of the snow. “Even then, the road is not recommended for travel. Only 4-wheel drives or vehicles with chains are recommended, and then with caution,” Trooper Marlowe said. He noted that the beauty of the Roan in any weather is hard to ignore for some. Also, cross country skiing conditions are great right now, and the snow draws many hikers to the Appalachian Trail, located nearby.

Race to the Top is a $4.35 billion federal grant program to help states enact reforms in four areas: adopting standards and assessments that prepare students to succeed in college and the workplace and to compete in the global economy; building data systems that measure student growth and success and inform teachers and principals about how they can improve instruction; recruiting, developing, rewarding and retaining effective teachers and principals, especially where they are needed most; and turning around lowest-achieving schools. Opie outlined the nuts and bolts of the program, which promises to provide $485 million over a four-year period to Tennessee if the state is one of the first five to be selected to receive the funding. Half of the grant would go directly to the schools, while the other half would be retained by the state, some of that to be used to provide further assistance to the schools. Carter County’s estimated share would be about $1.6 million, while Elizabethton would receive about $737,800. Opie said a 15-member advisory committee would be established to advise the state education board on decisions regarding yearly evaluations of n See EDUCATION, 12A Rachel S.
