He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, matriculating there in 1575 at the age of 18; scholar that year; fellow 1576; BA 28 May 1576; MA 16th May 1579. Resigning his fellowship the following year. He arrived at Douay College Reims 20 November, 1581. The aim of the College was to gather together some of the many English Catholics living in exile in different countries of the continent and provide them with facilities for continuing their studies (in what was effectively a Catholic University of Oxford in exile), thus producing a ready-made stock of educated English Catholic clergy ready for England's re-conversion to Catholicism. Thomas was ordained a catholic priest at Laon, March, 1583, and joined the English Mission that year. He was arrested soon after, and banished; but returned almost immediately. He was again arrested early in March, 1586-7, and imprisoned in Dorchester Gaol to stand trial with his great friend Jessop and in the fortnight between committal to prison and condemnation converted thirty persons. He was executed on 21 March 1587 and had been so cruelly drawn upon the hurdle that he was fainting when he came to the place of execution. When the rope was cut, being still alive he stood erect under the scaffold. The executioner, a cook, carried out the sentence so clumsily that the victim, turning to the sheriff, exclaimed \"Is this then your justice, Mr. Sheriff?\" According to another account \"the priest raised himself and putting out his hands cast forward his own bowels, crying 'Miserere mei'\". Father Warford says: \"There was not a priest in the whole West of England, who, to my knowledge, was his equal in virtue.\" Jessop died in Dorchester Gaol one year later.\n\nSources: Catholic Encyclopedia 1913 by John Bannerman Wainwright; OXA Vol III page 1164;Review of Fox's Book of Martyrs Vol 3 by Wm Eusebus Andrews.The undiscovered Country Journeys among the dead by Carl Watkins?\n\n20 July 1614 Thomas DOWRIDGE Giles ORCHARD of Chideock fisherman in £20.

They were mainly Dorchester and Weymouth men although it has not been possible to identify all of them. The number of names that appear in the Petty Customs lists for less than two years is very considerable. the total is 141 men and 2 women having some share in a cargo, and it is not claimed that this is a complete list. As will be shown later the Petty Customs returns do not exactly tally with the port book returns.\n\nThe man who dominates the shipping seems to have been William BLACKFORD (i.e. BLACHFORD) merchant clothier of Dorchester. In 1625 55 cargoes of cloth left Weymouth and he had a share in 36 of them with John his son having a share in 7. The next largest exporter was Richard SAMBOURNE another Dorchester man, with 18 loads. Other Dorchester Merchants who were exporting were J GOULD; with 8 loads; J COOTHES with 5; and W WHITEWAYS with 3 loads. Compared with these Dorchester shipments the Weymouth merchants had many fewer loads. Henry Waltham sent 10; Thomas Waltham and James James 4; Henry Mitchell 3 and T Rose, H Russell D Gier and R Maior [Major] 2 each. The import figures for the same year show J BLACKFORD with 24; James GOULD 17, R SAMBOURNE 16, J COOTHES 14 with four other Dorchester also receiving loads. However the Weymouth import cargoes were much larger----\"\n\n---\"In the same way the Dorchester family of BLACKFORD confined themselves mainly to cloth but also shared in the Newfoundland trade\". ---The Newfoundland trade was in oil and fish which came in dried from the banks and on which no duties were paid. One cargo noted in the 1625 port book was of fish and oil received in September for William DERBY and Company. Darby was a Dorchester merchant. In 1628 John BLACKFORD imported fish.\n\nSource: Pages 35, 39 & 40 Extract from Studies in a Dorset History by Maureen Weinstock M.A..,F.R..Hist.S.

In January 1625 Sir Walter ERLE and Company (Erle was one of the local members of Parliament) sent out in the 'Fellowship' 8 hundredweights of meal, 40 quarts of malt for the provision of the Christians planted in New England. On 27th February he sent more meal, malt and 6 cattle in the 'Amnity'. 1625 - Two ships returned later in the year, the 'Fellowship' from Virginia carrying 300 beaver and other skins for William DARBY and the 'Amnity' with 7 hundredweight of dried fish, 8 tons of trayne oil, 141 fox skins, 14 racoon, 25 martin, 5 otter, 8 beaver, and 1 muskrat skin for Richard BUSHROD another Dorchester merchant\n\n[Note:- These ships are also referred to on page 33 where Maureen is talking about the turnaround time of ships arriving at Weymouth mainly to do with trade with Norman and Breton ports but she also made the following reference to trade with new England. This makes it clear that :- ] ---On January 23rd 1625, the 'Fellowship' left for New England and landed cargo again in Weymouth on September 11th; the 'Amnity' sailing on February 27th was back on August 31st. The Fellowship is also listed in the survey of ships belonging to Weymouth taken on 11th March 1628 on page 32 when she is said to have been of 40 tons with 3 guns and may bear 2 more which was 20 years old and owned by Richard Berry [i.e. Richard Bury of Dorchester one of the investors in the Dorchester Co.]\n\nSource: Pages 32, 33 and 40 Extracted from Studies in a Dorset History by Maureen Weinstock M.A..,F.R..Hist.S.
