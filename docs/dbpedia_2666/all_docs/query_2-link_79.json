Much has happened here in the four hundredyears since the first Europeans arrived. Events that reflect not only the story of New York City but the story of the United States as well. Events as varied as the first exhibition of an elephant in the New World to the last known sightingof Judge Crater. Much of this history is not so easy to see. In Manhattan, the remindersof the past are often torn down andreplaced with somethingnew. New Yorkers,who are always striving “toget ahead,” rarely have time to look back. Thisbook is a look back, a record of an assortment of Manhattan sites where history happened, a compendium of facts, history, birthplaces, and “firsts.” More than a thousand entries, arranged by their street address, were culled from many sources-histories, biographies, newspapers, guidebooks,and maps. They range from amusing anecdotes to familiar historical events and from the Dutch New Amsterdam period to the present day. The entries are arrangedby today’s street addresses. Manhattan is divided into four sections: W Downtown: all addresses south of and including ChambersStreet and the\n\nBrooklyn Bridge. W The Village (which includes the Lower East Sideand Soho):all addresses north\n\nof Chambers Street to and including 14th Street. W Midtown: all addresses north of 14th Street to andincluding 59th Street. W Above 59th Street: the rest of Manhattan.\n\nWithin each of these sections, the alphabetical streets arelisted first, followed by the numbered avenues and then the numberedstreets in sequence. Last, each xi\n\nstreet or avenue is then arranged by individual address or house number. For example, 137 McDougal Street would be in the Village section, listed alphabetically under thestreet name, McDougal, then in order at 137. The entry for 124 West 55th Street would be in the Midtown section, listed in numerical order under 55th Street, both East and West, then in order at 124. The major parks are arrangedby name in the alphabetical street section. Streets are arranged by their most commonusage. A streetwith several different names will be listed under each name. An address on East 59th Street will be listed with the numbered streets, while a Central Park South address will appear with the alphabetical streets. Proper names appearin italics, and an asterisk marks what is currently at a site. An asterisk at an address denotes the structure is the same as referred to in the entry.\n\nxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmm DOWNTOWN\n\nm.\n\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\n\nBARCLAY STREET\n\n22 Barclay Street St. Peter’s Roman Catholic Church*-The serene Ionic temple churchon this site is the secondSt. Peter’s.The firstwas consecrated on November4,1786,and was the first permanent Roman Catholic parish in New York State. The oncesurrounding burial ground was the first Roman Catholic cemetery in the state. The current churchwas built in 1836 to replace the original, whichwas severely damaged in the GreatFire of 1835.\n\nBATTERY PARK\n\nCastle Garden*-The U.S. government built this one-time fort in 1807 on what was originally an artificial island about three hundred feet from shore. Constructed along with four other new fortifications in anticipation of the War of 1812,the West Battery, asit was called,never fired a shot defense. in Renamed Castle Clinton, itwas vacated by the U.S. Army in 1823,and the fortwas turned over to the city, which used it as an official greeting site. The Marquis deLafayette in 1824,President JohnTyler in 1843,and Hungarian patriotLouis Kossuth in 1851 were all welcomed here. One rather unceremonious welcoming was for President\n\nCastle Garden was still an island attached by a causeway at the tipof Battery Park in thls vlew of 1830. The popular waterfront park was later expanded with landfill, whlch connected the oldfort to Manhattan in the 1850s. (Library of Congress) DOWNTOWN\n\nH\n\n3\n\nAndrew Jackson on June12, 1833. The timber bridge from the fort to the battery collapsed from the weight of the president’s procession, dumping a number of men andhorses into the harbor. The president was slightly ahead of the crashand unhurt. Jenny Lind, the “Swedish Nightingale,” had her tumultuous American debut concert here in the now-roofed-over converted theater on September 11, 1850. More than six thousand musiclovers paid atleast three dollars seat, a a major coup for master showmanP. T. Barnum, who convinced her to perform. From 1855 until Ellis Island opened in 1890, seven and a half million immigrants passed through this buildingwhile it was the country’s premier immigrantlanding depot. The fort’s last incarnation was as the city’s aquarium, from 1896 until 1941. It was the largest aquarium in the world when it opened, andits tanks were stocked with exotic fish from aroundthe world collected by local sea captains. It was popular with several generations of New Yorkers. Robert Moses,who forced the aquarium tomove to Coney Island, tried to have the old fort removed for his proposed Brooklyn-Battery bridge.A public outcry stopped the bridge and the demolition of the fort. It was declared a National Historic Monument in 1946.\n\nBATTERY PLACE AT THE HARBOR\n\nPier A*-Recently restored, this pier has served asthe gateway for manycelebrities upon theirarrival in New York City: Charles A. Lindbergh‘s triumphal return after the first transatlantic flight on June 13, 1927; “Wrong Way” Corrigan Douglas for his off-course Atlantic flight on August 5 , 1938; and King George VI on June 10, 1939, are among many. But one visitor stands above all the rest: it was here that the legendary elephant Jumbo arrived on the Assyrian Monarch and first stepped on American soil with all the fanfare P. T. Barnum could muster, on Easter Sunday, April 10, 1882. Barnum had recently purchased the elephant from the LondonZoo for $10,000, much to the disappointment of English children, who started a letter campaign asking Queen Victoria to intervene and save the pachyderm.Nevertheless, Jumbo came to the United States to be the star attractionin Barnum’s circus. Ever after his death three years later in a trainaccident, Jumbo’s fame lived on. No otheranimal’s name has been so widely adopted into theEnglish language. 4\n\nALL AROUND THE TOWN\n\nP. T.

The truthremained hidden for more than twenty-five years, long after keeper of twentyyears. The pair became inseparable when Cleveland's death. Scott nursedthe sick baby elephant back to health. (Frank Leslie's, April 22, 1882) DOWNTOWN\n\nw\n\n5\n\nBEEKMAN STREET\n\nBeekman Street and Nassau Street, Southwest Corner Beekman (Chapel) Street Theater-The earliest New York performance of Harnlet took place here on November 26, 1761. Twenty-one-year-old Lewis Hallam Jr. played the title role. Hallam wasthe first star knownto Colonial audiencesand the first leading actor whose debut and early experiences were American. The theater was closed down by a riot over the StampAct controversy on May 5 , 1766. 101 Beekman Street The fourteen-year-old aspiring artistBen Shahn was apprenticed to Hessenberg’s Lithography Shop atthis address from 1913 to 1917. The Lithuanian-bornteenager was attending high school at night.\n\nBOWLING GREEN\n\n1 Bowling Green between State and Whitehall Streets A small clearing in the primal forest, thisarea of lower Manhattan was the likely site of Peter Minuit’s celebrated exchangewith the indigenous “Indians” in the late spring of 1626. The end of an age-old Native American trail that began north in Westchester, this is the beginning of today’s Broadway, or “Breede Wegh” as the Dutch called it. Minuit, the French-born director-generalof the Dutch colony of New Netherland, metwith the natives and“bought” the island for sixty guilders, or twenty-four dollars, worth of beads and tools. Fort Amsterdam-Early Dutch settlers built this fort,designed in 1626 by Kryn Frederycks. It wasa four-bastioned compound that contained governor’s the house, the officers’ quarters, the barracks, the prison, and a church. The fortwas the site of the first recorded murder in New Amsterdam, when Gerrit Jansen, a gunner, was stabbed to death in front of the gate in May of 1638. The murderer, JanGysbertsen, quickly fledthe settlement,never to beseen again. The fortwent through several name changes and additionswith each succeeding tenant-the Dutch, the English, and theAmericans-until it was torn down in 1790. Government House-An impressive two-story porticoed mansion was built here as a home for the presidentof the new country, but by the time it was completed the newly formed federal government had left for Philadelphia.The house then served asNew York‘s Governor’s Mansionuntil thestate capital left for Albany 6\n\nAALRLO U N D\n\nTHE T O W N\n\nin 1797. It wasduring this period thatGovernors GeorgeClinton andJohn Jay lived here. The mansionwas demolished in 1815 and replaced by a row of smallertownhouses. As business droveout residences in lower Manhattan in the mid-nineteenth century, these townhouses eventually became headquarters for the leading shipping companies, and theblock became known as “Steamship Row.” Alexander HamiltonUnited States Customhouse*-In 1907 the country’s largest and most profitable customhouse occupied this site. The elaborate building was designed by Cass Gilbert and decorated with sculpture by Daniel Chester French. After the Customs Service moved to the World Trade Center in 1973, the building stood emptyfor more than twenty years.As a fitting memorial, this spot-long ago a meeting ground between the native population, the ancestors of the Delaware Nation, and the first European settlers-is now the New Yorkbranch of the National Museum of the American Indian. TheDelaware people calledthe tipof lower Manhattan hay-la-py-ee chen-quay-hee-laas,“the place where the sunis born.”\n\nBOWLING GREEN PARK\n\nA Dutch cattle market from 1638 to 1647, this spot was later the city’s first park. In 1732, whileunder British rule, it was fenced i n and rented to Frederick Philipse, John Chamber, and JohnRoosevelt, local merchants, foruse as a bowling area. The ten-year lease was for one peppercorn peryear “for the recreation and delight of the inhabitants.” It was here that American patriots pulled down a gilded-lead equestrian statue of George 111 on July 9, 1776. They melted down the statue and used the lead for musket balls to shoot at theBritish.\n\nBROAD STREET 8 Broad Street New York Stock Exchange*-This current homeof the exchange dates from 1903. All great booms andbusts in the market will be measured against what happened here during the Stock Market Crash of 1929. The great boom of the 1920s ended here on “Black Thursday,” October 24, 1929, when thirteen million shares were traded. Within a week, the losses totaled $26 billion. One of the reasons for the crash was that speculators had bought stock on margin, paying only a portion of the price, then borrowing therest and using the stock as security for further loans. DOWNTOWN\n\nrn\n\n7\n\nThis continued tofuel the boom as long as the market rose. But when prices fell, the borrowers needed more moneyto back up the drop in the value of their collateral. This forcedpanic selling. Later, one of the reforms in the marketwas to have the Federal Reserve Board fix margin rates.\n\n15 Broad Street This wasthe address ofthe law offices of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy and MacVeagh. President Grover Cleveland accepteda jobhere after losing the election of 1888to Benjamin Harrison.Cleveland livedin New Yorkuntil he returned Washington to after winning thepresidential election of 1892. 26 Broad Street The first Latin school inNew York wasestablished at thisaddress in the summerof 1659. Alexander Carolus Curtius, aprofessor from Lithuania, was hired as headmaster. He didn’t last verylong. He was unhappy abouthis salary, and parents complained he was a poor disciplinarian. Dutch governorPeter Stuyvesant closed the school two years later, and Curtius sailed back to Europe. The school reopened a year later with a new teacher.\n\n38 Broad Street When theFire of 1845 reachedthe warehouseof Crooker and Warren on the night of July 19, a tremendous explosion shook the city. The saltpeter stored hereblew up with such force that the entire building was blownaway, except for somebricks. The blast was feltin Brooklyn and JerseyCity and heardas far away as SandyHook. 44 Broad Street Woodhull, Clajin e$ Company-On February 4,1870, investors, traders, and the curious crowded the sidewalk at this address, straining to see something never before seen on Wall Street, the country’s first brokerage firm operatedby women. Victoria C. Woodhull and hersister Tennessee Clafin opened their companywith the aid of their patron Commo. Cornelius Vanderbilt, a client from Victoria’s earlier career as a clairvoyant. This officealso served ascampaign headquarters for Woodhull’s candidacy for theU.S. presidency, forty-eight years before women couldvote. 60” Broad Street This office building was once the headquartersof Drexel Burnham Lambert, one of the country’s largest brokerage firms. On December 21, 1988, the company 8\n\nAALRLO UTN THD OEW N\n\npleaded guilty in federal court to insider trading and stock manipulation and agreed to pay penalties of $650 million. The chairmanof Drexel, Michael “Junk Bond King” Milken,and his friend and fellow trader Ivan Boskey both received jail terms for theirinvolvement in the scandal. The firm, which closed in February of 1990, came to symbolize the worst excesses of WallStreet during thefreewheeling and freedealing of the Reagan era.\n\nBroad Street and Beaver Street In the headydays leading to the Revolutionary War, this intersection marked a milestone on the road to war for American independence. On June 6 , 1775, British soldiers garrisoned in the city were about to embark on the frigate Asia to join their fellow troops in a more receptive and safer Boston. They were stopped at this spot by Marinus Willett, an officer in the New York militia, who seized a cart full of their weapons. Willett, actingunder local authority that had permitted the troopsto depart but with only their own personal arms, insisted they leave the cart of weapons. The showdown ended with the British leaving peaceably without the additional weapons. These confiscated arms were later used by the first American troops raised in New York under the ordersof Congress to fight the British. Willett served with distinction in the war and later served as mayor of the city. Broad Street and South William On the night of February 28, 1741, a chain of events began here that became known as the “Great Negro Plot,” one of the saddest chapters in race relations in the city’s history. On that winter night, someone broke into the homeof Robert Hogg, who lived at this corner. Some of Hogg’s stolen linens later fell into the hands of John Hughson, the shady owner of a tavernthat catered to slaves. Within the next few weeks, Fort George burned to the ground, and therewere several more mysterious fires.Determined to make a connectionbetween the robberyand the fires, authorities arrested and questioned Hughson’s young servant girl, Mary Burton. Offered money and threatenedwith damnation, Mary spun tale a of a plot to burn the city and kill allthe white people, except her boss Hughson,who would then be crowned “King of New York.” The rumoredslave revolt inflamed the White colonists, whose resulting rampage ended with the execution of thirty-one African Americans, many of whom were burned at thestake. Another 154 were cast into prison, and 71 were transported to the West Indies. John Hughson and his wife were executed. DOWNTOWN\n\n9\n\n101 Broad Street The German-bornC. T. Pachelbel, son of the renowned Johann, performed thefirst documented concertheld in the city at this site, the house of Robert Todd, a vintner, on January21,1736. The programwas ofinstrumental music for harpsichord, flute, and violin. The Anglers’ Club ofhrew York*-A lunchtime blast on January24,1975, rocked this club, an annexof nextdoor’s Fraunces Tavern, killing four people. The F.A.L.N., a Puerto Rican nationalist group, claimed responsibility for the bombing.\n\nBroad Street West of Water Street The ExchangeBuilding-Besides being the first capital of the United States, New York City was also the first capital of New York State. The statelegislature’s opening session took place in this buildingin January of 1784.The senatorsand assemblymen continued to meet here until 1796, when the new capital was moved to Albany. On November 3, 1789, the U.S. District Court convened here. Established under the JudiciaryAct of 1789, it was the first federal court organized under the new Constitution. President Washington appointed James Duane, former mayor of the city, to be the First District U.S. Judge.

The narrow21 %-feet-wide,thirteen-story building that once stood at this location was the first to use this innovation,albeit only partially. The first seven floors were built with thenew method, an iron armature supporting the weight of each floor. The top floors were constructed with the usual load-bearing walls, so those walls had to be increasingly thicker to support the weight of higherones. This key development allowedarchitects to build higher into the sky and notwaste valuable lowerfloor space to thick exteriorwalls. One problem yet unsolved washow to reassure the public thatthese tall buildings wouldn’t fall down. Bradford Lee Gilbert, the architect,solved this dilemmaby putting his own office on the topfloor to prove it was safe. This innovative monument was torn down in 1914 with littlefanfare to make way for an even taller building.\n\n57 Broadway On September 7,1879,two days after returning homefrom atrip abroad, Stanford White started his first day asa new partner with Charles McKimand William Mead.

The replacement and current structure with more than 1.2 million squarefeet of floor space was the world’s largest office building when completed in1915. The overwhelming bulkof this edifice rising forty-two stories straightup from the narrow streets confirmed the need for the long-proposed zoninglaws.

Roebling. He was one of the first to use steel cable on such a colossal scale in a suspension bridge. Roebling, who died while working on the project, was replaced by his son Washington. While working in the caissons on theriverbed, Washington was disabled by the pressure, what is now understoodas the “bends.” It took fourteenyears to complete the world’s longest suspension bridge, aproud symbol of the Industrial Age. Its Gothic towers strung with harplike cables towered over the city. During opening-day ceremonies,on May 24,1883, New York-born President ChesterA.

This barricade was intended to prevent citizens from returning to their homes andbusinesses in lower Manhattan.

The paintings of Thomas Cole, John Trumbull, Samuel F. B. Morse, and Asher Durand were exhibited along with Vanderlyn’s own panorama of the Gardens of Versailles. The space beneath the dome served as a viewing room for the elaborate painted panorama. Guests, who stood in the center on an elevated platform, were surrounded by the painted garden. The venture was a financial failure. The city took over the building, and it housed government offices until it was demolished in 1870.\n\nn ~ o ~~ e~s e ~ ~ n~ ~ancient yr - A nEgyptian-style reservoir topped with a reclining statue of Aquarius, the water-bearer, stood at this spot. Aaron Burr founded this enterprise, called the Manhattan Company, in 1799. It supplied the growing city with fresh water from pine-wood pipes coated with tar for tightness and longevity. An unusual charter from the state legislature allowed the company to engage in banking activities. (The company was an early parent of the Chase Manhattan Bank.) One vocal critic of this reservoir company’s involvement in the banking business was Alexander Hamilton. This disagreement between Burr and Hamilton was the first of many that eventually led to their fatal duel in 1804.\n\npened by Signor Ferdinand0 Palmo in 1844, this small theater was built to bring Italian opera to New York on a permanent basis. Palmo lost his opera house and all his money within two years. It later reopened as Burton’s Chambers Street Theater. It was the first theater in the city to sell numbered seats, and late theater-goers were assured of an empty seat. This theater was one of many that staged risquk “artist model shows” in the middle of the nineteenth century. A contemporary account of the show described “living men and women in almost the same state in which Gabriel saw them in the Garden of Eden on the first morning of creation,”The shows were eventually outlawed. 26\n\nALL AROUND THE TOWN\n\n~e~ Y o r ~~n s ~ ~ ; i t u t i o n ~ r i g i the n a lcity’s l y second almshouse in the park, this building was set aside for a variety of other benevolent purposes in 1816, when the poor were moved to Bellevue. It was an early home to the New-York Historical Society, the New York Society Library, and the American Academy of Fine Arts. Another early tenant was the Bank for Savings, the first savings bank in the United States. It opened for business on July 3,1819, in the Institution’s basement. ~our;it~ouse*-The “Tweed” Courthouse has come to symbolize the most corrupt era in the city’s government. A bill in 1858 set aside $250,000 for construction of this Victorian pile. But when it was completed in 1872, the total cost to the taxpayers came to more than $12 million. The difference ended up lining the pockets of Boss William Tweed and his cronies. The eventual cost for New York‘s new courthouse was twice the price the United States had paid for Alaska just five years earlier. This courthouse served as a fitting stage for Judge Samuel Seabury’s investigation into city corruption. On May 25, 1932, Mayor Jimmy Walker took the stand and confirmed what even his admirers suspected-that the popular “Night Mayor”wasn’t very honest, even by New York standards. The mayor was summoned to Albany by fellow Democrat Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to face charges.

(fPC)\n\nt From April 23,1789, until February 23,1790, President George Washington lived at this address in a red brick mansion owned by Walter Franklin. De Witt Clinton occupied the same house in 1817 before he moved to Albany to be governor of New York,\n\nDOWNTOWN\n\n27\n\nThis address was once the home of John Hancock. It was later the birthplace, on April 3,1823,of New York City’s most notorious politician, William Marcy Tweed. Tweed’s father ran his chair-making business from his home at this address. This entire stretch of Cherry Street no longer exists; it was replaced by the Manhattan approach to the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nNew York City’s answer to Betsy Ross, Samuel Chester Reid, lived in a house that once stood at this address. Reid, who was a naval officer in the War of 1812,is credited with designing the U.S. flag in its present modern form, the thirteen stripes with a varying number of stars. The first flag of his design, sewn by his wife, Mary, in their dining room, was raised over the U.S. Capitol on April 12,1818.\n\ntree In 1859 this intersection was part of the wharf district where George H. Hartford and his partner, George E Gillman, began their small tea company. This fledgling enterprise, which sold tea directly from ships arriving from Asia to their New York City c ~ s t o ~ e rwould s , grow to be one of the largest companies on earth, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, commonly known as A 8r P.\n\nThis address was once the home of John Wesley Jarvis, an i ~ p o r t a nearly t American portrait painter. His friend, the writer Thomas Paine, lived with him here for six months in 1806.\n\nere was the first permanent home of King’s College, which was renamed Columbia College after the RevolutionaryWar. Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Robert Livingston, Gouverneur Morris, and De Witt Clinton, all leaders of the newly independent nation, studied at this campus.

For almost 190 years it has been a focal point for the city’s triumphs and tragedies. It has been a site for the mourning of fallen leaders and heroes who lay in state: Henry Clay on July 3, 1852; John Quincy Adams on March 8,1858; and Uysses S. Grant on August 5,1885. Abraham Lincoln’s body was placed on the circular staircase.

The front steps have been a stage for mayoral inaugurations, protests, and speeches. These steps often serve as the finish line for Broadway ticker-tape parades honoring foreign dignitaries, winning athletes, politicians, and explorers. City Hall Subway Station*-After an hour and a half of speeches above ground, newly inaugurated Mayor George B. McClellan, the sonof the Civil War general, and other dignitaries made theirway down to this station underneath the drive in frontof City Hall to officially open thesubway on October27, 1904. This beautifully tiled station, unfortunately now closed to the public,was the start of that first ride at 2:35 p.m. With the words “I now, as Mayor, in the name of the people declare the subway open,” McClellan pulled the Tiffany-made solidsilver control handle, and the train lurched uptown. The enthusiastic mayor refused to relinquish the controls, as planned, and continued in hisrole as conductor. He overshotseveral stations andjerked afew ofhis notable passengers off their seats. Despite the mayor’s unsure hand, that first subway arrived at the last stop at 145th Street, twenty-six minutes later. At 7:00, the Interborough Rapid Transit, or IRT as it became known, was opened to thepublic. By the end of the day, more than 110,000 passengers had entered the system. CLIFF STREET\n\n97 Cliff Street An eighteen-year-old Samuel Clemens worked at this address in1853 as a journeyman printer. Hewas living in a boardinghouse on DuaneStreet. CORTLANDT STREET\n\nCortlandt Street and West Street This spot-now covered by the World Trade Center-was the landing dockof the world’s first steam ferryboat. On July 2, 1812, the Jersey carried the first passengers from here to New Jersey just south of Hoboken. Designed and operated by Robert Fulton, the innovativeall-wooden ship was 118 tons, 30 feet wide, and 80 feet long. The open double-endeddesign made it unnecessary to come around180 degrees before or after each landing, enablingwagons to disembark from the same direction inwhich they had boarded. Thissaved time andeffort on every crossing and docking.Before steam,ferries were powered bydraft horses harnessed to treadmills connected to the paddlewheels.\n\n30\n\nA LAL R O U N TDH TEO W N\n\nDEY STREET\n\nDey Street and Greenwich Street During an excavation at this intersection in 1916, the earliest known artifacts of European explorers in New York were discovered: the charred timbers of the Dutch ship theTiger. The ship’s captain, AdriaenBlock, and his men were forced to camp on ManhattanIsland for the winter of 1613-14. The Tiger burned, and the crew built a new, smaller ship. This part of lower Manhattan, rich in early New YorkCity archaeological history,is buried beneath the present World Trade Center.\n\nDOVER STREET\n\nDover Street and Pearl Street Cornelis Dircksen established the first ferry to Long Island around 1640 at thissite on what was then the East River shoreline. The passengers signaled Dircksen and his rowboat with a blow on a conch shell horn hung ontrees on each side of the shore. These passengers, the earliest recorded New York City commuters, were Dutch planters who farmed small plotsin Brooklyn. The land, justrecently purchased from Native Americans, was still the property of the Dutch West Indian Company and leased to the planters until their debtwas paid. This arrangement gave the boroughits name: theword Brjikenleen is derived from two Dutch words, Brjiken for “use,” and leen for “loan.”\n\nFRANKFORT STREET\n\n39 Frankfort Street George B. Smith, a member of Engine CompanyNo. 12, placed the first modern fire hydrant in New York City at this address in 1817. Mr. Smith installed the hydrant, an octagon-shaped wooden enclosureheld together with iron straps, in front of his own house at his own expense. Unfortunately, low pressure in the water main reduced the effectiveness of the new device, and it wasn’t until the 1840s that hydrants becamewidespread.\n\nDOWNTOWN\n\n31\n\nFRANKLIN SQUARE\n\nNow replaced bythe anchorage to theBrooklyn Bridge, this squarewas at the end of Cherry Street. It was the location for a public demonstration of the city’s first gas street lamp on June 11, 1824. Two years later these new gas-burning lamps were lighting up Broadway from theBattery to Grand Street.\n\nFULTON STREET\n\nFulton Street at the East River The Fulton Ferry Company, headedby engineer and businessman Robert Fulton, began the first steamboat ferryservice to Brooklyn on Saturday, May10,1814. The ship, Nassau, made the trip in about eight minutes at a speed of five miles per hour. Fulton’s ferry hastened the developmentof Brooklyn as a residential community, the nation’s first suburb. The ferry landings were later honored and renamedFultonStreet,one in NewYork and the other across the river in Brooklyn. Now further inland, the ferry landingsite is currently the South Street Seaport. The Nassau, after many years in service, was converted into a floating chapel tied to a New York wharf. 71 Fulton Street Situated in a courtyard at the back of this lotwas the city’s first recorded permanent fire station. Built in the early 1820s, this “Fireman’s Hall” served as both a headquarters and social club for the volunteer fire fighters. Priorto construction of this structure, crude neighborhood sheds filled with ladders, hand engines, and buckets were the only meansof defense againstfire in the predominantly woodencity. 148 Fulton Street On October 25, 1857, Joseph Wedemeyer, afriend of both Karl Marxand of New York. His club, which met Friedrich Engels, founded the Communist Club at this address, was the first Marxist organization in the Western Hemisphere. 168-1 72 Fulton Street Opened in 1795, this was the warehouse, workshop, and showroom of America’s leading furniture craftsman, Duncan Phyfe. He lived across the street at number169. 32\n\nA LAL R O U N TDH TEO W N\n\n252 Fulton Street Jimmy the Priest’s Saloon-This building, with a saloonon the groundfloor and a flophouse above, was often home to sailors in town between voyages. One of those long-ago sailors was Eugene O’Neill. It was here, upstairs in his room, that the future playwright attempted suicide in December of 1911. The saloon, complete with an old mahogany bar and sawdust on the floor, served as a model for his plays The Iceman Comethand Anna Christie. The World Trade Center replaced this literary landmark.\n\nGREENWICH STREET\n\nGreenwich Street from Battery Place to Cortlandt Street This length of Greenwich Streetwas the test section of the world’s first elevated railway. The inventor, Charles T. Harvey, rode the cable-driven car on its initial run onJuly 3,1867. Theline was built on a row of iron supports andconsisted of a single track. Steamengines housed in underground vaults supplied thepower to pull the continuously moving three-quarter-inchsteel cable. The car edged forward when the driverengaged a clamp that extendedbelow the wooden car and gripped the cable. Repeated cable breakdowns doomed the system until locomotive power replaced the cable system in 1871. Harvey’s mass-transit innovation evolved into the NinthAvenue Elevated Line. 82-84 Greenwich Street These two lots extending throughto Washington Street were once the site of one of the earliest circuses in America. Scottish showman John Bill Ricketts put together some equestrianacts, an acrobat, and a ropewalker, called his show a circus, and brought his troop up from Philadelphiain 1793, first to asite on Broadway and Exchange Alley, then to thissite in 1797. It was here that President John Adams watched the showon October 24 of that year.\n\nHANOVER STREET\n\nHanover Street and Beaver Street Comstock and Adams Dry Goods Store-The fire, caused bya gas-pipe explosion, that startedin this storeon December 15, 1835, wasthe origin of the Great Fire of DOWNTOWN\n\n33\n\n1835. This conflagration burned for two days and engulfed the heart of the business section, everything south of Wall Street and east of Broad Street. More than six hundred buildings were totally consumed. In addition to the enormous loss to the financial community, nearly all the city’s fire-insurance companies were destroyed or ban~upted-which left their clients with no possibility for compensation. Yet for all the destruction, there was ~iraculouslyno loss of life.\n\nThe greatest amount of property damage in the history of the city occurred during the Great Fire of 1835. This engraving by William Bennett records the scene on\n\nWall Street. The building with the columns, left, was the new Merchant’s Exchange at 55 Wall Street. ~~~~r~~of\n\nne of the earliest theaters built in New York, the John Street Theater stood here from its opening on December 7, 1767, until 1798. The building was described as “principally of wood; an unsightly object, painted red.”\n\nCongress)\n\n34\n\nALL AROUND THE TOWN\n\nen~ravin~ is based on a Smith of 1768.

It introduced the character of Jonatha~,the stereotypical rustic Yankee. President and Mrs. Washington, who had their own box, were welcomed each performance with the “President’s March,” later known as “Hail Columbia.” Washington’s attendance here helped mollify local ~eligiousopposition to the theater.\n\n*-This is the site of the oldest Methodist Society in A ~ e r i c aPhilip . Embury preached at the dedication service here at a small ‘“WesleyChapel” on October 30,1768. The current church, the third on this site, was erected in 1840.\n\nThe Battle of Golden Hill was fought on this spot on January 19,1770, shedding the first blood of the ~ ~ e r i c Revolution, an several weeks before the Boston Massacre. The Sons of Liberty and their sympathizers rioted on this site of a British Army barracks, outraged by the British removal of their liberty pole and over the issue of quarter in^ British soldiers in their homes. One patriot was killed, and several were wounded. DOWNTOWN\n\n35\n\nThis address was once the office of J. L. Haiger. In 1877 he became the first paid telephone subscriber in the city. A five-mile-long wire was laid across the half-finished Brooklyn Bridge, connecting this office to his steel-wire plant in Brooklyn.\n\n~ ~ ~Sugar ~ House-A ~ g warehouse s ~ o once ~ on this spot served as a British military prison for American Revolutionary War soldiers from 1776 until 1783. The British commonly used sugar houses as jails. Built of stone walls, with small windows and low ceilings, they were adept at holding prisoners as well as sugar. This is now the site of Chase Manhattan Bank Plaza.\n\nI\n\nhe current co-operative apartment house was once the twenty-ninth-~oor headquarters of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company run by Harry Sinclair. In the early 1920s U.S. Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall secretly transferred government oil lands here to Sinclair’s company. The deals, exposed by the end of the decade, became known as the “Teapot Dome” Scandal and resulted in prison terms for both Sinclair and Fall. Franklin I>.Roosevelt had a first-floor office here in the mid- 1920s. He was then vice president and New York representative of the Fidelity and Deposit Insurance Company of Maryland.\n\nIn the early 1870s Charles Guiteau had a struggling law practice in a building that once stood at this address. Guiteau become infamous about ten years later for assassinating President James A. Garfield on July 2, 1881, in a Washington, D.C., train station.\n\nJames Madison was living in Elsworth‘s Boarding House, which once stood at this address, in 1787. It was here that the future president of the United States co-wrote The ~ e ~ e ~essays a ~ explaining ~ s ~ , the new Constitution and advocating its adoption. 36\n\nALL AROUND THE T O W N\n\nAfter moving to the city in 1790, as the country’s first secretary of state Thomas Jefferson wrote, “My first object was to look out a house on the Broadway as being the centre of my business. Finding none there vacant for the present, I have taken a small one in Maiden Lane, which may give me time to look about.’’ He lived here three months, in a house that stood at this address until 1929.\n\nIt was near this spot, in an orchard once owned by Mr. Cook but long ago replaced by modern office buildings, that a group of twenty-five African American and three Native American slaves met after midnight on April 7, 1712, to plan an insurrection against their white masters. They waited until the moon was setting at two o’clock, and then their leader, a slave named Coffee, set fire to the outhouse of his owner, Peter Van Tilburgh. The plotters watched and waited as a crowd gathered, drawn by the blaze. The slaves attacked, killing nine people and wounding six others. The local militia caught and killed some of the insurrectionaries within hours. The rest were rounded up and brutally executed-most burned alive-as an gruesome example to the colony’s slaves.\n\nwas used as a prison and riding school for the British during the Revolution. On April 29, 1839, the city celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the inaugural of George Washington here. The guest of honor was sixty-nine-year-old ex-president John Quincy Adams, who spoke for two hours. Mr. Adams shared the stage with a chair used by Washington at his inauguration. In 1845 the building was leased to the federal government as a post office. It was here, in a second-floor office, that the first US. stamps were issued on July 1,1847. The stamps, a five-cent issue with Benjamin Franklin’s image and a ten-cent issue with George Washington’s image, were a new innovation: prepaid postage. Prior to this, all letters were delivered with postage due.\n\nange-The Bell Company opened the first telephone exchange here in March of 1878. Later, in October, the city’s first telephone directory, with 252 names, was issued on a small card. In the early days, there DOWNTOWN\n\n37\n\nwere no telephone numbers.Calls were made by asking the operator for the name of the person being called.\n\n115 Nassau Street Currier 6 Ives Shop-The offices and salesroom of America’s foremost lithographic team were at this address inthe 1880s. Nathaniel Currier started his print shop in1834. For the next seventy years he and James Merritt Ives, his partner after1857, produced thousands of cherished prints. These prints, whose subject matter range from domestic scenes to disasters, arean important visual record of nineteenth-century America. 126 Nassau Street A boardinghouse at this address was once home to Mary Cecilia Rogers, a beautiful young woman who sold cigars and tobacco on Broadway near Duane Street. Shewas a familiar andbeloved figure in the neighborhood. Her disappearance on July 28,1841, and the finding of her strangled body floating in the Hudson River shocked the city. Her murder was never solved. Edgar Allan Poe, an admirer who frequented her shop, later based his “Mysteryof Marie Roget” on this case. TwoCurrier & lvesemployees pose in front of the shop at 115 Nassau Street in August of 1885. The firm is displaying portraits of Ulysses s.

The two brothers were thecountry’sleadingproponentsandpractitioners of phrenology, the artof analyzing character from the conformation of the skull. The “head reading” fad swept the nation in the mid-nineteenth century. As with many pseudo-sciences, phrenology had many unshakable devotees, including Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe. This address served as the Fowlers’ base of operations, with examination rooms, a museum, a lecture hall, and publishing center for their numerous books and journals. W\n\nA L L AROUND THE T O W N\n\n140” Nassau Street Morse Building-This twelve-story structure, now converted to an apartment house, was once home to oneof the world’s earliest film studios, the American Vitagraph Company. Founded by two English vaudeville performers, J. Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith, the company made silent motion pictures here from 1897 until 1903. The roof served asa studioto take full advantage of the sunlight needed forearly cameras. Vitagraph‘s first feature, aptly named The Burglar on the Roof; was a sixty-second melodrama starringBlackton as the burglar.\n\nNassau Street and Spruce Street, Northeast Corner Tribune Building-It was from here in a rented office in the building of a competing newspaper that the young millionaire William Randolph Hearst set up shop after buying the New York Journal on October 7,1895. He spent muchof his own fortune to boost the readership of this paper. Hearst then launched acirculation war with the powerful Joseph Pulitzer’s World. This rivalry spawned the era of yellow journalism in America. Both papers’ sensational coverage of the conditions in Spain’s colony, Cuba, helped push the United States into the SpanishAmerican War. Nassau Street and Frankfort Street, Southeast Corner This was the first permanent home of Tammany Hall, which opened in 1812. Founded as a fraternal society in 1789, it became the DemocraticParty organization in the city. It grew in political power with the arrival of Irish immigrants. The party supplied the jobs, and the Irish supplied the votes. By the 1880s it had become completely corrupt.\n\nN E W STREET\n\n7 New Street Exchange Buflet-Opened on September 4, 1885, this was the world’s first selfservice restaurant. 34 New Street On July 19, 1845,at 3:OO a.m., a fire began at this address, then the spermwhale-oil shop of J. L. Van Doren. Before it was extinguished twelve hours later, three hundred buildings were destroyed and thirty people died. There was also more than DOWNTOWN\n\n39\n\n$6 million in property loss, due largely to the destruction of the imported goods stored in the warehouses. The extent of the damage was almost as severe as that from the earlier GreatFire of 1835. These two blazes virtually destroyed the last remnants of seventeenth-century Dutch Colonial architecture in the city. 58 New Street New York Gold Exchange-The building that once stood at this addresswas the center of a financial whirlwind surrounded by anxious brokers on September 24, 1869, later to be knownas Black Friday. It was herein the Gold Room, where gold was sold as a commodity, that traders began tofeel the effects of Jay Gouldand Jim Fisk‘s attempt to corner the market. Gould and his partner had hoped to buy all $15 million worth of gold then in circulation and thus drive up its price. President Ulysses S. Grant prevented this by allowing the U.S. Treasury’s gold to be sold in the market. However, Gould’s Washington spies, including Grant’s brother-in-law, leaked him the news of Grant’s decision, and Gouldwas still able to make an $1 1 million profit.Many brokerage firms and individual speculators were financially ruined.\n\nPARK R O W\n\n21-25 Park Row Park Theater-The theater that once stood on thissite opened on January29, 1798, with a performance of As You Like It. It was also the site of America’s first grand opera ever presented in full in its original language,Rossini’s The Barber of Seville, on November 29, 1825. On the night of February 14, 1842, 2,500 guests attended the “Boz Ball” in honor of English author Charles Dickens’s first visit to America. The stage and orchestra pitwere covered over to accommodate the crowd. Between the cotillions and waltzes, a curtain would rise revealing a small stage with tableaux vivants from thestoryteller’s writings. Violinist virtuoso Ole Bull made his American debut on this same stage on November 25, 1843. 31 Park Row New York World Newspaper OfFces-A World reporter, Nellie Bly, returned to this addressafter her journey around theworld on January 26,1890.Bly, the nom de plumeof Elizabeth Cochrane, was hoping tobeat the record set by Jules Verne’s 40\n\nAALRLO UTNTHD OEW N\n\nBefore federal government regulations, the nmeteenthcentury stock exchanges were susceptible to rogue traders.

The mayor was only grazed and escaped serious injury, but an aid was hit in the mouth. Theattacker, Michael Mahoney, was declared insane and sent to an asylum. Ironically, five years earlier, Mitchel, whowas then the president of the boardof aldermen, was made actingmayor during the previousmayor William J. Gaynor’s recuperation from an attemptedassassination. Mayor Gaynor resumed his duties but died three years later as a result of his wound.

His mother, Maria, was the only daughter of the Revolutionary War hero Gen. Peter Gansevoort, and his father, Allan, was in the import business on the nearby docks. The future authorof Moby Dick lived here until 1824. Pearl Street and Whitehall Street This was the site of the first market in the city for the townspeopleto buy country produce. Governor Peter Stuyvesant and the city council established the weekly Saturday marketon September 12,1656.\n\n39 Pearl Street Under the director-general of New Netherland, Wouter VanTwiller, the first building solely dedicated to religiouspurposes was built here in 1633.

TheNew York State Chamber of Commerce was founded here on April 5, 1768.But this tavernisbest knownfor its connectionstoGen.George Washington. It served for ten days as his last residencewhile general of the American Revolutionary forces. He delivered his famous farewell speech to his officers here on December 4,1783. Thenewly formed government’s Departments of War, Treasury, and Foreign Affairs, which were later combined as the State Department, were quartered here while the city served as the nation’s capital. The current building, completed in 1907, is not the actual tavern but an educated guess as to what the buildinglooked like. This reconstruction served as the locale for a special breakfast on April 30, 1989, celebrating the two hundredth anniversary of George Washington’s inauguration. The invited guests were all descendants of former U.S. presidents, from Lacey Washington, thefirst president’s sixth great-niece, to Karen Denis, President Reagan’s third cousin.\n\n61 Pearl Street The deed for this propertywas the first to be recorded in the Register’s Office of New York County. Dated October 12, 1654, it documents that Cornelius Van Tienhoven sold this address and 26 Stone Street to Jacob Hendricks, oneof the first surgeons in New Amsterdam. The doctordidn’t own this real estate long; he resold it the sameday to Jacob Steendam. 66 Pearl Street This address sits on a portion of the city’s earliest landfill project. In 1684 this property across from the Stadt Huys was created with earth and debris from nearby hills. Called “water lots,” this landfill was the first of many devised by generations of Manhattan developers and city bureaucrats who sought to add more land to sell and tax. A small, gabled, Dutch-style house that was the first built on this lot was owned by Peter and Mary Jay, who were most likely living here when their son, John, was born on December 12, 1745. John Jay went on tobecome the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. 71-73 Pearl Street Stadt Huys-Rising above the neighboring Dutch gabled homes, this five-story stone buildingwas a prominent landmarkalong the shoreline when it was built by DOWNTOWN\n\nW\n\n43\n\nGovernor WillemKieft. On NewYear’sDayof 1642,itwasleased for a Stadt Herbergh (Public Inn) to Philip Gerritsen for three hundred guilders a year. For the next several years, outlying Dutchsettlers sought refuge here from Native American raids during Governor Kieft‘s War. In 1653the building becamethe Stadt Huys (City Hall), New York City’sfirst. A cupola was added, and its entrance, which had faced Fort Amsterdam, was changedto face the East River. It served as the seat of government until 1699. In 1979 excavations revealedthe foundation,only 42 feet by 52 feet, of the old Stadt Huys. Archaeologistsfound many colonial artifacts, including fragments of Dutch and English pottery andeven some Native Americanwampum.\n\n81 Pearl Street This was the site of the first printing press in the New York colony. William Bradford was appointed public printer onApril 10, 1693. He was involved in several firsts in the history of printing in America: the first legislative proceedings published, the first New York paper money, and the first newspaper to appear in NewYork, the New York Gazette, on October 16, 1725. Bradford is buried in Trinity Churchyard. 119-21 Pearl Street On May 16, 1691, Capt. William Kidd, the shipowner and sea captain, married Mrs. Sarah Oort, whowas probably the richest widow in New York at the time. The happy couplemoved into her mansion,which once stood approximately in the rear of this lot. The captainlived here foreight years, then sailed for the Indian Ocean. It was at this point that Captain Kidd began his infamous career as a pirate. After he was hanged in London on May 12, 1701, rumors spread that he had buried his plunder along thecoast near the city. 218 Pearl Street This site once held the home of Hercules Mulligan, a member of the Sons of Liberty andanIrish-born secretagentfor the Americans duringthe Revolutionary War. On November 25, 1783, when the British left the city, George Washington and four of his officers visited this house to pay their respects to Mulligan for helping the Patriot cause. 255-257 Pearl Street The two dilapidated buildings that once stood at thissite, in what was then a rundown section of the waterfront, were home to Thomas Edison’s first commercial 44\n\nALL AROUND THE TOWN\n\nelectric generators. At exactly 3 p.m. on September 4, 1882, the Pearl Street Station started supplying fifty-nine downtown customerswith electricity.Edison had chosen this location, paying little for the two buildings at a time when his capital was low, because he wantedto be near the financial section and potential investors.\n\n326 Pearl Street Walton House-Built in 1752, a four-story house on thissite was considered “the most beautiful home in America.” The extravagant parties held here during Colonialrule were referred to in the British Parliament as proofthatthe Americans could afford to pay higher taxes.By the end of the Revolutionary War, Pearl Street was turning morecommercial.

The departureof this 424-tonvessel with two decks and three masts marked a high point in the economic development of New York City. What made this sailing a historic improvement was that the ship sailed on the very day her owners had said she would sail. The James Monroe inaugurated the first regular dependable shippingservice to Europe. Prior to this, ships left only when they were full and the weather was good. Now,full or not, sun or snow, the Black Ball ships would guarantee merchants the delivery of their goods. The journeywas also the first transatlantic scheduled departure for the eight pioneer passengers on the ship.

Governor Peter Stuyvesant ordered the barricade built by all male residents “without exception” as a defense against the British colonists of New England and not, as is widely believed, as protection against the indigenous people.
