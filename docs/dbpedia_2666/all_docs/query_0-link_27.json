        "text": "With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?\n\nThe amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Mister Universum (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Kaktus Jack (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).\n\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan, der Barbar (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan der Zerstörer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Phantom Kommando (1985), Der City Hai (1986), Predator (1987), Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins - Zwillinge (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nRemarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Versprochen ist versprochen (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days - Nacht ohne morgen (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage - Zeit der Vergeltung (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIt was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rebellion der Maschinen (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.\n\nSchwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.\n\nIn October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.\n\nSchwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Welcome to the Jungle (2003), In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator - Genisys (2015).\n\nActor, producer and humanitarian Danny Glover has been a commanding presence on screen, stage and television for more than 35 years.\n\nGlover was born in San Francisco, California, to Carrie (Hunley) and James Glover, postal workers who were also active in civil rights. Glover trained at the Black Actors' Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. It was his Broadway debut in Fugard's Master Harold...and the Boys, which brought him to national recognition and led director Robert Benton to cast Glover in his first leading role in 1984's Oscar®-nominated Best Picture Places in the Heart.\n\nThe following year, Glover starred in two more Best Picture nominees: Peter Weir's Witness and Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple. In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels. Glover has also invested his talents in more personal projects, including the award-winning To Sleep With Anger, which he executive produced and for which he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor; Bopha!; Manderlay; Missing in America; and the film version of Athol Fugard's play Boesman and Lena. On the small screen, Glover won an Image Award and a Cable ACE Award and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the title role of the HBO movie Mandela. He has also received Emmy nominations for his work in the acclaimed miniseries Lonesome Dove and the telefilm Freedom Song. As a director, he earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Showtime's Just a Dream.\n\nGlover's film credits range from the blockbuster Lethal Weapon franchise to smaller independent features, some of which Glover also produced. He co-starred in the critically acclaimed feature Dreamgirls directed by Bill Condon and in Po' Boy's Game for director Clement Virgo. He appeared in the hit feature Shooter for director Antoine Fuqua, Honeydripper for director John Sayles, and Be Kind, Rewind for director Michel Gondry.\n\nGlover has also gained respect for his wide-reaching community activism and philanthropic efforts, with a particular emphasis on advocacy for economic justice, and access to health care and education programs in the United States and Africa. For these efforts, Glover received a 2006 DGA Honor. Internationally, Glover has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program from 1998-2004, focusing on issues of poverty, disease, and economic development in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and serves as UNICEF Ambassador.\n\nIn 2005, Glover co-founded Louverture Films dedicated to the development and production of films of historical relevance, social purpose, commercial value and artistic integrity. The New York based company has a slate of progressive features and documentaries including Trouble the Water, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, Africa Unite, award winning feature Bamako, and most recent projects Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, and The Disappearance of McKinley Nolan.\n\nA blond-haired, fair-complexioned actor with a toothy grin and capable of an unsettling glint in his eyes, Gary Busey was born in Goose Creek, Texas, and was raised in Oklahoma. He is the son of Sadie Virginia (Arnett), a homemaker, and Delmar Lloyd Busey, a construction design manager. He has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry. He graduated from Nathan Hale High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1962 and for a while was a professional musician. A talented drummer, he played in several bands, including those of country-and-western legends Leon Russell, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson.\n\nBusey's first film appearance was as a biker in the low-budget Angels Hard as They Come (1971) and, over the next few years, he landed several film roles generally as a country hick/redneck or surly, rebellious types. His real breakthrough came in the dynamic film Die Buddy Holly Story (1978), with Busey taking the lead role as Buddy Holly, in addition to playing guitar and singing all the vocals! His stellar performance scored him a Best Actor nomination and the attention of Hollywood taking overcasting agents. Next up, he joined fellow young actors William Katt and Jan-Michael Vincent as surfing buddies growing up together in the cult surf film Tag der Entscheidung (1978), directed by John Milius. However, a string of appearances in somewhat mediocre films took him out of the spotlight for several years, until he played the brutal assassin Mr. Joshua trying to kill Los Angeles cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the runaway mega-hit Lethal Weapon - Zwei stahlharte Profis (1987). Further strong roles followed, including alongside Danny Glover once again in Predator 2 (1990). He was back on the beaches, this time tracking bank robbers with FBI agent Keanu Reeves, in Gefährliche Brandung (1991) and nearly stole the show as a psychotic Navy officer in league with terrorists led by Tommy Lee Jones taking over the USS Missouri in the highly popular Alarmstufe: Rot (1992).\n\nThe entertaining Busey has continued to remain busy in front of the cameras and has certainly developed a minor cult following among many film fans. Plus, he's also the proud father of accomplished young actor Jake Busey, whose looks make him almost a dead ringer for his famous father.\n\nBahamian-born Calvin Lockhart first caught moviegoers' attention in the supercharged urban films Wenn es Nacht wird in Manhattan (1970) and Halls of Anger (1970) before becoming a fairly steady fixture in the \"blaxploitation\" movies of the early-to-mid-1970s.\n\nBorn Bert Cooper to a large family in Nassau on October 18, 1934, he was raised there before moving to New York in his late teens with initial designs on becoming a civil engineer (Cooper Union School of Engineering). Dropping out after a year to pursue an acting career, Calvin worked as a carpenter and construction worker, among other odd jobs. He first studied with legendary coach Uta Hagen and then hit the New York theater boards. The story goes that he was discovered by playwright Ketti Frings while working as a taxi driver. She was so impressed with his arrogance that she cast him in her play \"The Cool World\" in 1960. From there Calvin drummed up interest via a bit of controversy on Broadway when he played a sailor in love with a white girl in the racially-themed \"A Taste of Honey\" starring Angela Lansbury.\n\nSerious film and TV roles for black actors were scarce at that time, so Calvin moved to Europe. In Italy he owned a restaurant and formed his own theater company, serving as both actor and director. He also lived in Germany before settling in England. He starting building up film credits with minor work in such British movies as Todestanz eines Killers (1968) and Nur über eine Leiche (1968). He made news in another racially-motivated project entitled Joanna (1968), which centered around a \"mod\", interracial romance with 'Genevieve Waite'.\n\nReturning to the US with a stronger resume, he made a distinct early impression as a slick preacher bent on fraud in the hip cop flick Wenn es Nacht wird in Manhattan (1970) and as an English teacher in the inner-city potboiler Halls of Anger (1970). He also involved himself in such black action features as Melinda (1972), Honeybaby, Honeybaby (1974) and The Baron (1977). Similar in charismatic style and intelligence to Sidney Poitier, the famed actor-director was impressed enough to cast Calvin in his broad comedy vehicles Samstagnacht oben in der Stadt (1974) and Drehn wir noch'n Ding (1975). Calvin could also play fey upon request, camping it up briefly in Myra Breckinridge - Mann oder Frau? (1970). During this rich period he also became an artist-in-residence with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford (the first black actor so honored) and appeared prestigiously in such productions as \"Titus Andronicus\" (1972).\n\nCalvin's career grew lackluster, however, by the end of the decade, resorting to trivial guest parts in such TV shows as Good Times (1974) and Get Christie Love! (1974). He landed a recurring role on the nighttime soap Der Denver-Clan (1981) in the early '80s.\n\nIn 1974, Calvin married a woman also from the West Indies and had three children. After his career subsided, he decided to return to his homeland in the mid '90s and resettled in Nassau with his fourth wife, Jennifer Miles. There he involved himself with the Freeport Players Guild as a director. He also returned to films after a 15-year absence, completing Rain (2008), a movie shot in the Bahamas, shortly before he suffered a major stroke. Calvin died of complications on March 29, 2007, and his family is in the process of establishing a scholarship fund in his name for Bahamian student pursuing an acting or filmmaking career.\n\nEngaged on the big and small screen, he has always dedicated his energies to social commitment. The role played in Capitano Ultimo is the one he is most attached to. He supported Sergio De Caprio in the creation of a non-profit foundation and the Casa Famiglia Capitano Ultimo, in the Parco della Mistica, on the south-eastern outskirts of Rome, with the aim of defeating the culture of ethnic, religious, social or physical diversity by welcoming underprivileged minors who are given education and training that allows them to undertake honest work. He works alongside the Io Ci Sono association for the reconstruction of multifunctional centers in the areas of central Italy hit by the earthquake in 2016. In 2010, during the World Food Day ceremony, he was appointed FAO Good Will Ambassador. In 2005 he decided to research and produce stories in which he could express himself freely on an acting, creative and productive level, creating his own Film Production Company. The intent is to give space to projects with social value, which can, through cinema and television, spread messages that lead to reflection. He produces Sbirri, a docu-film on the world of police and drugs, which has enjoyed considerable success with audiences and critics both at the cinema and on TV. He presents the short film 15 Seconds in Brussels, against the death penalty, sponsored by the European Parliament, the Presidency of the Republic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Education. He co-produces Io, l'altro which talks about racism and preconceptions and how the way of seeing others has changed after September 11th. With MediaFriends he produced two social shorts: Graffiti and Amore nero, the latter shot as a manifesto against violence against women, starring Michelle Hunziker and the directorial debut of Raoul himself. The short receives an official commendation from the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano. He works with some of the most influential names in the national and international film industry. In collaboration with Mediaset he produces successful television series such as Fuoco Amico Task Force 45, Come un Delfino with the music of Ennio Morricone and Come un Delfino-La serie. His debut as an actor took place in Una storia italiana directed by Stefano Reali, since then he has acted alongside Anthony Quinn, Sophia Loren, Giancarlo Giannini, Michele Placido, F. Murray Abraham, Sylvester Stallone, Carole Bouquet, Diane Lane, Sarah Jessica Parker, Angelina Jolie and many others. Protagonist of some of the most successful television series, such as the most recent Buongiorno mamma and Don Matteo (he recently finished filming its second season), and the recently aired I Fantastici 5, where the theme of youth disability is addressed, while we will soon see him on the big screen in the film Greta e le favole vere."
