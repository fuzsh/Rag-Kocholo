        "text": "§ The Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (Mr. William Rodgers)\n\nI beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.\n\nThe origins of the Bill, which we are discussing this afternoon, go back a good deal further than October, 1964, when the present Government took office. There has been a growing awareness over the past decade or more—not merely in this country but in most parts of the world—that some positive policy is required if a proper relationship is to be secured between movements of incomes and movements of national productivity and if inflation is to be avoided.\n\nThis is not to suggest that there is no longer any need, by the proper use of fiscal and monetary weapons, to regulate the level of demand in the economy. The important point is that this alone is not enough. A policy bearing more directly on negotiated increases in pay and on movements in prices is now widely accepted to be necessary in partnership with a fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nI shall not recall in detail the various stages with which we have developed this policy over the past two years or so. The House does not need reminding that we started with a joint Declaration of Intent—a document which, like any other statement of broad principles, was necessarily phrased in general terms. Perhaps for that reason right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the House have sometimes seemed to treat the Declaration, as they appear to be doing now, as a subject for amusement. All that I can say is that all those who signed it—representing both sides of industry and the Government—did so in all seriousness, 1719 and I think that the country as a whole believed at that time that it was an historic step forward.\n\nOne thing that has become increasingly clear over the years is that it is not enough in this field—and I willingly concede this, not for the first time—to reach agreement simply on statements of principle, however important these are and however great an advance they represent. It is also necessary to create the procedures and machinery necessary to secure their application.\n\nFor that reason, we allotted the general task of keeping an oversight of the policy to the National Economic Development Council. For the independent consideration of particular cases, we set up, as the House well knows, the National Board for Prices and Incomes. The Board was appointed last summer, and I think that in all our discussions, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee upstairs, it is agreed that the Board has since made its mark upon the economic field with a series of reports which have made a major contribution to the understanding of many economic problems.\n\nThe only argument that we have had is how far the Board's sphere of operations might be extended and how far, for example, as the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) suggested last night, we might call upon it to fulfil functions which are not at present encompassed by its responsibilities.\n\nIt might have been suggested, in these circumstances, that there was no need to change the Board's status. We took the view, however, that since it is clear that the Board can be regarded as part of the established economic machinery of the country, it would be preferable to reconstitute it on a statutory basis. That does not mean, though I am sure that this is clear in the House, that the Board's findings or recommendations would have the force of law. That is certainly not our intention. The intention is to give the Board the status of a body appointed on the authority of Parliament with statutory power to secure the information which it requires in order to carry out its work. This is the thought lying behind Part I and the First Schedule to the Bill.\n\n1720 The new status which we are giving the Board under the Bill does not mean any substantial changes in its method of working. The initiative for referring cases to the Board will continue to lie where it has hitherto, with the Government, although, naturally, we shall keep in close touch with the chairman of the Board in considering its programme of work. In this, as in so many other fields, the more consultation and the more dialogue we have, the better.\n\nSimilarly, the responsibility continues to lie with the Government, working, as we have throughout, in consultation with industry, to lay down from time to time the appropriate criteria to guide the Board in its work. We thought it right, despite all our debates on the Bill, to reproduce in the Second Schedule the original criteria set out in the White Paper of April, 1965, since there is much in that White Paper which is of lasting validity.\n\nOn the other hand, in the circumstances of the prices and incomes standstill, we shall need to give the Board new criteria to govern its work in the year ahead. We explain in paragraph 25 of the standstill White Paper that we shall be discussing with the T.U.C., the C.B.I. and other organisations concerned, the form which the criteria should take in order to secure the exceptional measure of restraint for which we have called next year.\n\nAs my right hon. Friend the First Secretary explained earlier in our debates, having said that we would undertake these consultations, it would not be right if we were to try to anticipate them by suggesting what the outcome might be. On the other hand, there are two particular points of interest which have been the object of concern to hon. Members on both sides throughout our discussions, and it may be helpful if I just take a moment to say a word about them.\n\nThe first point is the position of the lower-paid workers. I hope that the House will remember that general recognition that existing wage and salary levels too low to obtain a reasonable standard of living represented one of the circumstances which it was admitted in the White Paper of April, 1965, might justify an exceptional pay increase. That was one of the exceptions set out in paragraph 15 of that White Paper.\n\n1721 I cannot conceive that either side of industry, or, for that matter, either side of the House, would wish that revised and more stringent criteria should fail to recognise the validity of that consideration. But, having said that we recognise the special position of the lower-paid workers, one must also recognise that it is not always easy to identify the lowest-paid groups of workers or to know where to draw the line. Moreover—and this is very important—there is a natural tendency for any special treatment in these circumstances to spread to other groups whose case may be less well founded. Whatever view we may take, particularly on this side of the House, about where social justice lies, we must acknowledge that through a large part of industry the same view is not taken about what the proper differentials ought to be.\n\n§ Mr. Rodgers\n\nI hope to make quite a short speech so that hon. Members on both sides of the House may take part in the debate. I am sure that every hon. 1722 Member will have an equal opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, if he is in the Chamber at the time.\n\nAnother point which has been made many times in our debates is that of the rôle within the prices and incomes policy and under the Bill of productivity improvements or productivity bargaining. Here again, the White Paper which we agreed with industry in April last year was clear in accepting that genuine productivity bargains represent valid candidates for special treatment.\n\nBut we must be realistic. If those workers who happen to be in a position to increase their productivity claim the whole fruits of that increase, there will be nothing to spare for other groups of workers, many in the public services, who have little or no such opportunity. Moreover, experience so far has shown all too clearly how great are the pressures to extend improvements in pay or conditions, which may have been negotiated in return for increased productivity, into other areas of employment where the same scope for productivity improvement does not exist. That is why we feel that a simple-minded approach to this question of productivity, as also to the question of lower-paid workers, is bound to be misleading.\n\nUnless we can find a way of distinguishing those productivity bargains which are genuine—and I think that there was a large measure of agreement in our debates about how often so-called productivity agreements are bogus—and unless we can find a way of securing that the community, as well as the parties primarily concerned, receive some share of the benefits, the whole policy could be quickly undermined. That is why, in the special circumstances of the standstill, though again with reluctance, we have felt bound to resist suggestions, however superficially attractive they may sound, that a general exception should be made in favour of productivity bargains.\n\nWe hope that all those who are involved in a reference to the Board will reflect carefully on its recommendations and seek to carry them out. The hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Pardoe) had down an Amendment in the early hours of this morning, and I had a great deal of sympathy with the spirit of that Amendment. His proposal was that there should be a further standstill 1723 period of a month after the Board has reported so that the parties involved could reflect upon its recommendations and reach wise decisions. For reasons which I then gave, it was not possible for us to accept that Amendment. Nevertheless, I hope very much that when the Board reports the parties involved will reflect carefully and will seek to carry out its recommendations.\n\nObviously, in the circumstances in which references are made, public attention is bound to focus at first on the immediate consequences of a report, whether it be on prices or on incomes. But the Board will be very much involved in productivity. I repeat this because at one stage, apparently, it was not wholly clear to the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph). The Board's success in the long run may be best judged by the extent to which it helps to overcome obstacles to efficiency in industry of all kinds.\n\nThe second major development of the policy, which is reflected in Parts II and III of the Bill, was the institution last autumn of the early warning system. The origins of this are quite simple. It became clear at an early stage in the policy that, however well conceived it might be and however well devised the machinery set up for its implementation, it could never be successful if all the various parties concerned continued to keep their intentions strictly to themselves. This is, of course, particularly true in respect of references to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.\n\nThe selection of cases for reference has been and remains the responsibility of the Government, and it is a responsibility which needs to be undertaken, as I think it has been undertaken, with discrimination and after due thought. But if the Government know nothing about an increase in pay or an increase in prices until it has taken place, they can do no more than chase after events. All our experience now shows that the best hope of influencing these decisions and of ensuring that they conform with policy requirements lies in catching them at a very early stage indeed, and it is for this purpose that the Government need advance warning of what is in mind in respect of both pay and prices.\n\n1724 That is why we called on both sides of industry almost a year ago to co-operate in instituting an early warning system for prices and incomes. At that time we called for co-operation in these early warning arrangements on a voluntary basis. I would make it quite clear that we appreciate greatly the response of the T.U.C. and of the C.B.I. to our request at that time. The T.U.C. responded in a quite remarkable way by instituting a vetting system of their own, which, though still in its early stages, represents an important base for the further development of central leadership and influence in the trade union movement.\n\nThis is one of the benefits peripheral to the policy itself, which, looking back over the events of the last year, we can see. On the management side, individual companies and their representative organisations, their trade associations, have shown themselves generally understanding of the Government's needs and intentions and have co-operated in making these arrangements work.\n\nBut we were faced with a decision whether to let these arrangements remain indefinitely on a purely voluntary basis or to fortify them with statutory powers which could be used if need arose. This was not an easy decision. This has been made clear throughout our discussions. At no stage has it been an easy policy to develop. There have always been difficulties to be overcome and a balance of advantages to be weighed.\n\nThe point has often been made—it has been made by some of my hon. and right hon. Friends—that if you ask someone to do something on a voluntary basis, you run the risk of losing his support if subsequently you take compulsory powers. It is a fair point which we did not lightly dismiss. But our conclusion was that in the circumstances, given the importance to our economic life of making this policy effective, it would be right to seek and to hold in reserve limited statutory powers to fortify the voluntary co-operation which we were already receiving.\n\n§ Sir K. Joseph\n\nOf course, we have always stood for competition.\n\nThe second snag to the First Secretary's policy is that we believe that it is just not right for the Government to bully people into not acting as the law allows them, as their own interests dictate, and as the market permits. No doubt people do not mind a certain amount of bullying by the Government when it is only the chairmen of great public companies who are on the receiving end.\n\nHowever, under the Bill, under the voluntary policy of the Government behind the Bill, and under Part IV if it is activated, it is to be everyone who is to be on the receiving end of the bullying, be it voluntary at the beginning or statutory if Part IV is activated.\n\nWe on this side want to draw attention to a very improper use of the word \"patriotic\" which is creeping into Government habits. Even so sensible a Minister as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour has begun to use the word \"patriotic\" in a thoroughly wrong sense, we think. Which is patriotic—to break a moral or legal contract, or to carry it out? Which is patriotic—to hold prices down and to cut quality or investment, or to let prices rise to their proper level and continue with investment? I find it very hard to choose. It is certainly wrong for the Government, because they have chosen one horn of this dilemma, to call the other horn of the dilemma unpatriotic.\n\nThe third damaging feature of the First Secretary's policy is that the consequence of interfering with the economy will soon begin to be visible. Prices 1737 may or may not be held; but taxes, rates, and the deficits of nationalised industries will steadily rise under this policy. More and more, as time passes, if the First Secretary continues to meddle with the economy, there will be a breakdown in the delicate machinery of supply and demand. There will be grave damage to investment, with consequent hurt to our competitive position, and ultimately to jobs. If the Government activate the lunatic Part IV of the Bill, these objections to the voluntary phase will be multiplied 100-fold.\n\nThese are the reasons why we believe that, even if the attitude of the Government has for the moment some public support, it is a very waning asset in the Government's hands. Disillusion and disenchantment will set in rapidly.\n\nWe are faced as a result of the Bill with a number of consequences to which I want to refer briefly. We are an economy of choice. Freedom of choice is taken for granted by our citizens. I accept that there is a small but vital proportion of wage earners who receive too little to have any effective freedom of choice. They should be dealt with; and we have urged it, just as hon. Members opposite have urged it, on the Government. But if they number 3 per cent. of the population, vital though they are, that is, I think, a fair estimate. For the other 97 per cent. of the population, freedom of choice, to a greater or lesser extent, is taken for granted. We expect to find the goods of the world in our shops. We are not a seige economy.\n\nThe biggest assets of a choice economy are invention and enterprise. We believe that the biggest victims of the Bill and of the voluntary policy behind it, if allowed to continue for more than a very short time, will be just those two—invention and enterprise. They will be crippled and shackled.\n\nThe Government themselves recognise that there must be redeployment of labour. If skilled men and women are to be redeployed—there will be a shortage of them, even in the new deflation—there must be, as one hon. Member from the Liberal Benches said so well yesterday, signals. There must be differentials which attract skilled men and women to where they are most needed.\n\n1738 How can there be those signals and differentials, unless there is freedom to move up prices and pay to attract resources and skilled labour to where they are most needed to satisfy the demands of the market? These, therefore, are a Bill and a policy deeply damaging to our choice economy. \"To our economy of choice\" would perhaps be less ambiguous.\n\nWe also believe that this whole policy concentrates on the wrong target. In its focus on incomes it ignores unit costs, which are the real measure of our competitive efficiency. We believe that restrictive practices should be the real target of Government policy. Of course there would be difficulties. Of course, we agree with the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) that age-long, deeply dug, restrictive labour practices are not knocked over by one blast, even from Mr. Aubrey Jones's trumpet. But we believe that here is a battle worth fighting, whereas the battle represented by the Bill is not worth fighting, because it is not the right battle.\n\nWe criticise the Bill and its consequences because still the Government are trying to squeeze and be loved. We prove that because they are controlling prices for one reason, namely, that only in that way do they think that they can make wage control palatable. We do not think that it will make wage control palatable.\n\nPrice control may defeat the whole economic operation. Pay will inch up—I do not think anyone would deny that—even over the next few weeks and months. Prices may move slightly less. To the extent that they do, purchasing power will increase and sq will imports. The end result will be a waste of all the efforts and the passion in the Bill.\n\nWe believe, too, that the Bill and the policy behind it will deeply damage investment. I do not think that the Government pretend that this is a danger lightly to be dismissed. I remind the Government that in France, where this sort of policy has been invoked for some years and where they have a great bureaucracy controlling prices, although in the last few years price increases have been reduced from 6 per cent. average to 3 per cent. average, investment is 1739 dead; investment is stagnant, and the national plan authorities in France are deeply worried.\n\nOur next quarrel with the Bill and the policy behind it is the abrogation of contracts, moral and legal, which it wishes to impose upon employers. We believe that this will discredit the whole system of bargaining. We agree with the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), who asked what would happen if the railwaymen were asked once again to Downing Street. We think that here again the Prime Minister has discredited yet another instrument of Government. No longer will the meeting in Downing Street represent the credible ultimate in any industrial dispute. After what has happened to the railwaymen, I cannot imagine that people will ever want to visit Downing Street for that purpose under this Government.\n\nThen we quarrel with the whole practicability of this operation, including the Bill. At the moment there is a voluntary price notification policy, which is to be widened by the new White Paper to cover all goods, except those made in workshops or establishments—we do not know which—containing fewer than 100 workers.\n\nI do not wish to take up too much time, but contemplation of the torrent of people wishing, for one reason or another, even in a deflation, to alter prices, leads one to wonder whether the First Secretary has visualised what he is undertaking. There will be such a torrent of letters to him and his colleagues that we can only ask whether it is intended to have a great bureaucracy or to have great delays. Probably the answer is that there will be both.\n\nSo we regard the Bill as impracticable. We believe that the Government do not have the information to judge whether and when they should move from the voluntary to the statutory system, and we do not think it possible that the Government could really assess the merits of particular price increases, because the First Secretary has asked that each should be accompanied by a mass of statistical data which would absorb the attention of an investment analyst, let alone busy Ministers.\n\nI come now to the unfairness and contradictions in the Bill. I can dispose of 1740 the contradictions in a sentence. In one month the Government introduce the regulator and the Selective Employment Tax to increase prices and to mop up demand. In the next month they introduce the Prices and Incomes Bill, which will penalise anyone who puts prices up. What a contradiction. What Government policy!\n\nPart IV, however, with all its iniquities, is conceived in an attempt to produce fairness. I think we can give credit to the Government for that objective. However, I ask the Government: which is the greater evil—to infuriate all the 6 million with agreements in order to comfort those without agreements; or to let those with agreements have their bargains adhered to and to ask those who have not agreements to stay longer in the queue? I can see that there could be two answers to this question, but I cannot see that the Government can establish that their answer is infallibly the right one. All we know is that either solution will produce an intolerable number of grievances among the people.\n\nNow I come to another aspect of unfairness which has not so far been brought out. This Bill and the voluntary principle of the Bill will hit hardest at the most scrupulous of businessmen, the producer of engineering goods, each carefully specified, and each price on a price list, will be absolutely caught. Even if he wanted to avoid it, which in 99.9 cases out of 100 he will not, he would not be able to do so. Who is going to measure the exact portion of candyfloss that is served at the end of a stick? Who will gauge whether the coconuts in a coconut shy have been fastened just that shade more fixedly to their stands? I do not want to use the Prime Minister's obsolete vocabulary, but all those which are commonly regarded as the frivolous activities of the people will be those that most easily escape from either the voluntary or the compulsory freeze, whereas the people serving the export needs of this country will suffer.\n\nI need only remind people of the consequences for the trade unions. This voluntary policy will be the apotheosis, the heyday of the militant and the martyr. Here we agree with hon. Members below the Gangway on the Government side who spoke on this matter.\n\n1741 I now come to the question of timing. The Government laid great emphasis on the fact that the Bill lapses after 12 months. We do not doubt it. That is in the Bill. It lapses after 12 months; but the Government can legislate again. We believe that such is the clumsy touch of this Government that more evils may well beset the country and they will find it hard when the 12 months are up and will want to come to the House again for these draconic powers.\n\nThere is a further hurdle before the 12 months are up. The First Secretary is already dressing up as Santa Claus for the end of the first six months. He is promising to look kindly on the lower-paid workers. No doubt, there are other people at whom, in private conference if not in this House, he is promising to look kindly in their interests at the end of six months. There will be a flood of expectations building up for the end of the first six months. But at the end of the first six months the deflation introduced by the Government will be beginning to bite severely. Will there be a will to increase wages when the time comes? Even if the First Secretary decides that it is consistent with the national interest for him to wave the magic wand, will he find employers, in the new deflation introduced by this Government, so ready as they have been up to now? The economy seems to lurch from crisis to crisis. We have doubts whether the Government will catch up sufficiently under control to be able to avoid coming back to the House in 12 months for further new powers.\n\nIt is a sad commentary that the First Secretary, even himself, cannot pretend to look 12 months ahead. He has had the honesty not to try to tell us what the state of play will be in 12 months. Yet the same right hon. Gentleman is going to make another National Plan for the next five years.\n\nWe believe this is an evil and an unnecessary Bill, and I hope the Under-Secretary, if he has misinterpreted the solid series of votes that this side of the House cast against all stages of the Bill except Part I, will not misinterpret what I am now saying. Had the Government acted earlier to deflate far less severely than they now have, the economy would have been far healthier and the Bill would not have been required.\n\n1742 We have been told that the Bill is an alternative to deflation. The country has got deflation. Government spokesmen try to pretend that we want more deflation in place of this Bill. That is untrue. We do not. We wanted less deflation than the Prime Minister has inflicted on the country, but we wanted it sooner, when it would have been effective. Under any Government with a reasonable name for consistency and efficiency, the deflation introduced by the Prime Minister three weeks ago would have been more than enough. If the Government's creditors and the country's creditors asked for this Bill they should have been told that the Bill is not the remedy for our troubles. They could only have been told so by a Government who had performed their first duty to their citizens by getting the level of demand right. If our creditors needed to be placated, the Government should have thrown them a change of policy on steel, and not the liberties of the people.\n\nWe want a high-earnings low-cost economy. This Bill and the Government's policy are the antithesis of our needs and aims. We take no delight in the fact that we and the Labour rebels at least agree in hating the Bill, because we agree in so little else. The Labour rebels' paradise is full of controls, and their proposals would waste and ravage what prosperity this country has. They would tie up enterprise in shackles and divide a wealth that would dwindle and not grow. The Government should know better. They should know that enterprise, investment and choice are the life blood of this country. That is why we condemn this Bill, except Part I, so absolutely. It will achieve nothing that their own deflation, excessive and belated though it was, will bring about. We pray that the Government will never activate the infamous Part IV. There can be no doubt that they know the views of all parts of the House on this part of the Bill. If the Government have, as we believe, put the country into so desperate a plight that foreign advice has to be accepted, however unsuitable and intolerable, the sooner the Government go the better.\n\n§ Mr. J. Grimond (Orkney and Shetland)\n\nThe Government have told us this afternoon that they regret the necessity for 1743 this Bill. So, I should hope, they do. It is incredible to me that as mild a word as \"regret\" should be used about a Bill which carries a description opposite Clause 30 which reads: Authority for employers to disregard pay increases in existing contracts. Then the Government went on to say that it had been fully discussed. So it is quite sufficient to have 25 Members of this House sitting all night in an upstairs Committee room and then to say that it is an adequate forum for removing from people liberties which no other Government have ever thought of touching in peace or war. I wonder what the Minister thinks the House of Commons is for. Perhaps he thinks that the whole assembly could be reduced to 25 people and that they could sit through the night in a Committee room upstairs considering whatever business the Government like to put before them.\n\nIn any case, is it a good thing that the Government should regret it? Is it a virtue on the part of the Government that they introduce an economic policy which they regret? The truth is that they now go from crisis to crisis on a purely tactical exercise with no long-term economic strategy whatever. I for my part would make my view clear as to the general purpose which the Government claim is behind this Bill. I certainly regard inflation as serious. It may so far have been contained for many people to a degree which is tolerable, but for many other people it is already intolerable. Many of the people who suffer from it most are the most deserving members of the community. Further, it has made the economy extremely difficult to manage. Should it accelerate, it might turn into a general distrust of money and we could have an unmanageable situation such as has not been unknown in Europe in the last 40 or 50 years.\n\nFurther, I regard it as serious that there has been a steady decline in the position of this country relative to the rest of the world. The Prime Minister used to be a great one for quoting the league tables. He must now be haunted by his own speeches, when he considers that under his leadership we have dropped entirely out of the top division altogether and are now fifteenth in the world for output per man.\n\n1744 Certainly we need a policy which will check inflation, as well as a policy to increase productivity. We need a policy to relate incomes more closely to the goods and services available. But our case is that this cannot be done by the incomes and prices policy of the sort attempted under this Bill. The Government themselves never thought that it could be done in this way. As the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) said, they told us at one time that the Bill would be the alternative to deflation, but now we have both.\n\nWhat is the position of the National Board for Prices and Incomes? The incomes and prices policy must pull with and not against the other policies of the Government, but while calling on everyone else to restrain their expenditure the Government have increased their own. It has gone up by £1,200 million since the Labour Government took office. The Board may be able to give us some guide lines about fixing rates of remuneration in, say, the public sector, it may be able to have a marginal effect if it is moving in the same direction as the Government, but it cannot be expected to dam a running tide of inflation propagated by the Government themselves. The nationalisation of steel is extremely inflationary, and this at a moment when the Government are appealing for an all-round standstill.\n\nWhat is the position of the Prices and Incomes Board now? The Bill has produced a curious pantomime monster of which the head is the First Secretary and the hind legs are Mr. Aubrey Jones. As I understand it, the Board has nothing to do with the statutory freeze which may now be enforced. This might have had something to be said for it if the Board had been used for the long-term job of working out standards and priorities in the incomes structure and doing a task of education. But it has not been used for that purpose. It has been flung into the gap again and again to stem the tide of new demands for pay increases.\n\nThis having been done, it would be more reasonable to use the Board as the instrument for deciding whether action need be taken against any increases in the six months period rather than to entrust this task, as, apparently, it will be entrusted to a heterogeneous collection of 1745 Ministers and civil servants who have no experience in the matter whatever.\n\nOne of the many impractical parts of the Bill is revealed the moment one asks who is to decide whether action is to be taken. Who is to decide whether the price of screws is to go up a .d., who is to decide whether the \"Bunny\" clubs are entitled to increase the pay of their bunnies, and so on? If the machinery is worked in this way, it will either employ an army of civil servants or it will become a farce. This is one of the main objections to the Bill. It might be tolerable to have a Measure which brought about such flagrant infringements of personal liberty and well established customs and standards of industrial behaviour if it was workable, but to have an unworkable Measure which does that is more than the House should tolerate.\n\nThat is by no means the only contradiction between different aspects of Government policy introduced by the Bill. In the autumn, the new graduated contributions will come in. How far are employers to be allowed to raise prices or employees to demand extra pay? As for the Selective Employment Tax, the First Secretary himself said in the Budget debate that, although he hoped that a great deal of the extra cost would be absorbed, some of it would no doubt be passed on in higher prices. What about the additional charge for petrol? What about the regulator? Are these measures intended to put prices up or to put them down? It is no good saying that the costs can all be absorbed because if they were all absorbed the purchasing power in the hands of the public would increase and the amount available for investment would decrease. We must at least give the Government credit for not having that as their policy.\n\nWhat about the contradiction between freezing council tenancy rents and trying to keep down rates? It is absurd to expect local authorities to keep down rates if we do not allow them to put up rents. In Glasgow the situation has reached such a pitch that if rates go up further they will unquestionably drive employment out of the city.\n\nThe most damaging charge against the Bill is that its provisions are entirely related to the short term. In the 20 months of Labour Administration, we 1746 have never got away from the short term. It is almost admitted in the Bill that, once the 12 months period is over, it will be in order to put in the usual round of price increases and pay demands. If that happens, we shall be back to inflation as before.\n\nThere is talk in the White Paper of productivity catching up—that is the phrase—but why should it catch up? It is not catching up. It may be rising slightly, but it is not rising nearly enough, and there is nothing in the Bill to encourage productivity to rise further. On the contrary, there will be the opposite result. The effect of the freeze will almost certainly be to reduce it. This was pointed out very forcibly by the Prime Minister himself in the days when he was critical of the sort of policies he now puts into effect.\n\n§ Mr. Grimond\n\nI am at the moment explaining the absolute uselessness of this Bill, and that, if I may say so, is a legitimate point on Third Reading. I said earlier that I did not deny that the problems with which the Bill is supposed to deal are real problems. What I am saying—I am trying to build up a reasoned case, unlike the case to which we have so often listened recently—is that the Bill will not achieve its supposed object. This is widely accepted now not only on this side of the House but by Members on the same side as the right hon. Gentleman himself.\n\nDoes the First Secretary of State think that the Bill will increase mobility? Up to now, it has always been believed that the way to increase mobility was to offer inducements to people to move, to make it easier for them to move by having retraining schemes adequate to meet the need. But we have no such thing. It was always believed that mobility would be greater in a time of expansion, not contraction. If we have a total freeze like this, whether it be necessary or not, it must have the effect of encouraging employers and labour to dig in and remain where they are, and this will be all the more so if we hold prices level 1747 and there is a severe deflationary situation next year. It will favour the unenterprising employer and the one who hoards labour.\n\nFurthermore, I am given the impression all the time that the Government believe that this is a battle which can be won in six or 12 months. I do not believe that for a moment. It is a long-term battle, and I deeply regret that there is in the Bill no sufficient attention to the long term. Its provisions are wholly negative. Once again we are told that these measures are the price we must pay for time. We have been told that again and again in the last ten years, that we must do something which in the short run may be damaging and unpleasant, but we shall gain time. The truth is that we have never used the time we gain, and the painful events of the past three weeks give the answer all too clearly to what has happened in the last 20 months.\n\nLet us hope that the Bill does succeed in buying time. I suppose that everyone in the House, however critical we may be of the Government's methods, must hope that we do get inflation under control, that we get productivity agreements, that we hold the £, and that at some period this country is able to expand. I am not in the least attacking the First Secretary of State for his objectives. I attack him for his methods, which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do in the House, as he appreciates.\n\nAs I say, whatever we may feel about the chances of our buying time by the Bill, we must hope that time will be gained, but what are we to do during that time? We must not emerge from this period with a helter-skelter rush of wage demands. I think that this has been accepted by the Government. I hope very much that they will allow the Prices and Incomes Board to gel down to its proper longer-term job of working out the priorities between the demands which may arise and establishing standards by which pay rises in the public sector are to be geared. I fully agree, as I have said, that it is essential to allow productivity agreements offering higher pay for better production, but it is essential also not constantly to allow the public sector in all its forms to fall far behind, thereby making it difficult for us to recruit to the police, for instance, 1748 and creating extreme dissatisfaction in various sectors of the economy which are of great importance although not directly engaged in exporting or manufacture.\n\nOn the question of productivity, I do not believe that it is possible for the Government to conduct our affairs at the centre by trying to control every agreement, every price and every wage structure in the country. They have to decentralise it. They must keep control over the climate to ensure that their own policy is not inflationary but is geared to the general needs of the country, and then they must encourage productivity agreements to be reached industry by industry or even plant by plant. One of the faults of the present incomes policy is that it is too centralised.\n\nFurther, the Government, in matters which lie directly under their hand, must show that they intend to pursue a policy which will contain inflation not merely for a year or so but much longer. The crunch will come at the end of the current period of cuts when we may be in not only a deflationary situation ourselves but a deflationary world. What do we do then? The great danger is that we may fail to raise productivity and get back to expansion, but still have to maintain controls on prices and incomes. To me, this will be a disastrous ending to the exercise, but one cannot rule it out. Just as I hope that the Prices and Incomes Board is working out priorities, so I hope that the Government, when they can tell local authorities that there is more money to spend, will be able to give a much better direction than has been given over the last ten years about the priorities that they should be pursuing.\n\nI finish by saying that I believe that this is a misconceived Bill. It is a Bill which, by its attack on the good faith of employers who have come to agreements with their workers, may do very long-term damage not only to Britain as an industrial nation but also to the credit of the Government themselves. That having been said, no one should be under any misapprehension about the need for the country to take steps to deal with inflation, raise productivity and improve industrial relations. If we are to have any hope for the future, we must soon have from the Government a much clearer and more convincing account of their 1749 long-term strategy than we have had up to now.\n\n§ Dame Irene Ward (Tynemouth)\n\nThe speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir. K. Joseph) magnificently and adequately expressed my own views about the Bill and I need not add anything, although I want to ask one or two specific questions for clarification and enlightenment.\n\nI am sorry that the Under-Secretary did not see fit to give way to me. I would never bear him any malice for that, because I think that he is very young and I think that his political success has come a little too quickly. When he has lived a little longer and knows a little more about industrial problems, he will improve. I often disagree with right hon. and hon. Members opposite, but the way in which the hon. Gentleman dealt with the traditions of the trade union movement and the way in which the words tripped so eloquently and quickly from his lips showed that he did not know very much about the struggles of the past.\n\nHe will never be the success that he probably thinks he will be if he does not learn a little more about some of the motives to be found in the speeches of hon and right hon. Members on both sides of the House, whether one agrees with them or not. One has to accept tradition and one has to pay respect to tradition. Having struggled a long time in my part of the world, I think that perhaps I know a little more about the difficulties of ordinary people than the hon. Gentleman does. However, I bear him no malice, because I think that he will learn.\n\nHe spoke of the problem, and a serious problem it is, of the lower-paid workers. There are many lower-paid workers, as we very well know. I did not expect the suggestion which I intended to make would be of any benefit to the hon. Gentleman, but when we have the opportunity we ought to pool our 1755 ideas, whether they come from my side of the House, or from any of the divisions on the other side.\n\nAs the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it is difficult to define lower-paid workers, but there is one category which can be easily defined. It is only a very small section of the problem, but there are about 200,000 people who are excused paying National Insurance contributions because their incomes are too small to carry the burden. That might be the category from which the Department which the hon. Gentleman serves so well might proceed in order to try to find a solution to this problem. Coming from the part of the country which I represent, it is with great regret that I have to say that it will be those who can least afford to meet the obligations of the Bill who will be dealt with most hardly. That is why I disliked the slick attitude of the hon. Gentleman, because he does not know very much about lower-paid workers or people who live on small fixed incomes.\n\nI did not serve on the famous Committee. I am sorry about that, because I would have liked the fight. However, I sat here most of last night and listened to most of the debates on the Bill, particularly on Part IV. What is to happen to that section of the community who are not to be allowed wage and salary increases to be put into operation at the expected time? I am thinking of the railwaymen and policemen as examples of a whole list. They will be badly hit by the Bill. What will be their position when the time comes to implement wage agreements for which a hard fight has been won?\n\nHow will their pension position be affected? I asked a Question about this the other day when I asked whether their pension position would be safeguarded. The deferment of wages and salaries for six or 12 months is reflected in pensions, and I asked whether that aspect of the situation would be protected. I was very perturbed to find that the answer was \"No\". I cannot believe that that was the whole answer. If it was, will have to co-operate in the national interest for the rest of their lives. I cannot think that that would be a fair those who co-operate in the national interest and whose pensions are affected 1756 interpretation of a fair share of the burden of co-operating in the national interest.\n\nThere may have been another explanation which I have not heard, but if what I was told reflects the true position, then it should be put on the record so that everybody who reads the debate, not least the trade union representatives of those who will be affected by the deferment of increases, will know exactly what the position is. For instance, the pension of a doctor reflects the amount of time he has spent in the National Health Service and the amount of pay which he has received.\n\nIt is absolutely essential that we should have this point clarified. There is also the matter of increments. There are various categories of people who receive yearly increments added to their salaries or wages. Will those people be allowed to accept the increments, or are these frozen, too? A great many people would like to know this. It is not only these people who are affected, but all of those who receive annual increments. Will they be paid or not? It may have been made perfectly clear, but I have never heard it being so made and it is very important that it should be.\n\nLast night an hon. Gentleman opposite made an intervention during the speech of a Front Bench spokesman, who said that the hon. Member's point would be dealt with. I have tried to find the reference in HANSARD, but I am unable to do so because HANSARD only goes up to half-past ten in the evening. I listened to the right hon. Gentleman when he wound up, but I did not hear any reference to the point raised by the intervention. At four o'clock in the morning it is easy to miss something, but I would like to know the answer to this question, which dealt with the position of the public service pensioners and those who come under the Royal Warrant—Service pensioners, officers and other ranks. These are people who have already served their country.\n\nI noticed that when we entered on the final discussion of this Bill the right hon. Lady the Minister of Social Security said that there was going to be no hold-up over the wage-related benefits. Everyone was very glad about this, but that only refers to those who are in employment, although a lot of these will be deprived 1757 of it when deflation sets in and the target figure of unemployment which the Government have set has been reached. What will be the position of a public service pensioner and those who are covered by the Royal Warrant? Although there are some who have a better pension than others, the vast majority of them are very badly-off indeed. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman, who I always find is a very sympathetic character and who, I think, knows a great deal more about life than his Parliamentary Secretary, will be able to answer this question.\n\nI hope that he is not going to say, as has been said by Governments of both Parties, that the best that can be done for these people is to curb inflation. That is true, but one can curb inflation for those with higher wages and higher incomes, and one can curb inflation for people who have not got enough to live on anyhow. I want to know whether these people have to wait indefinitely. I have noted the intervention made by the right hon. Gentleman about nurses. That is something else which he has just thrown off the cuff. The nurses had the thick end of the original pay pause. I admit that because I addressed them at the Albert Hall, when I spoke in support of them. I do not always agree with my own Government. Why should I? I am free, much \"freer than the Under-Secretary. From the way the right hon. Gentleman made his intervention about the nurses, one would have thought that we would have been able to solve the whole problem. I hope that he is not thinking that he is going to solve the problem, because it will be very hard on the nurses if he is.\n\nThe Government have imposed enormous burdens on the Royal College of Nursing, the General Council of Nursing and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists through the S.E.T. These are all bodies which serve the public devotedly. It is all very well when it suits the right hon. Gentleman to throw out these words, but he did not convince his own Cabinet of the need to support these bodies. He has made them pay, so let us have no more argument from the right hon. Gentleman about what the Conservatives did about the nurses. What we did—[Interruption.] It is no good trying to do this, What we did for the country was to give it a much better position, without 1758 imposing increased taxation or curtailing liberty. There is no argument about that at all. [Interruption.] Hon. Gentlemen opposite mumur away like a lot of horses snorting in horse-boxes.\n\nI am asking the right hon. Gentleman, when he winds up, to deal with the points that I have raised about those who are dependent on their pensions and their increments for preserving their living standards, because they have to meet inflation. I want to know how these people are to be affected. All I can say is that I hope I shall live long enough so that in about six months or twelve months' time I shall be able to challenge the Treasury Bench, speaking with many of the facts produced so excellently by my right hon. Friend, and hear it say that it wished that it had taken my advice at the appropriate time.\n\n§ Mr. Michael Foot (Ebbw Vale)\n\nI will try to speak for a very few minutes, because I understand that many of my hon. Friends wish to contribute to the debate.\n\nSince one of my own principal objections to the Bill was that I did not believe that the House had been provided with a proper opportunity for debating the essential Part IV, it is only fair to acknowledge that the debate which we had on many of these provisions on Report is one which hon. Members will agree was a full and extensive debate and one of the best debates that I have heard in the House. It is a small mercy which the Government have given us that they listened with great patience to what we had to say on that occasion, and certainly I acknowledge that fact.\n\n1772 However, my objection on that score still remains. The exclusion of a Second Reading debate on Part IV of the Bill means that the House is deprived of doing exactly what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that he wanted it to do; that is, to state our alternatives. Some of us have a whole list of alternatives to this Measure which we would have wished to discuss as an alternative set of propositions for dealing with the country's difficulties, but we were denied the right to do so by the choice of the Government.\n\nSecondly, there is a most curious feature of the Bill. As far as I can recall, it is the only Bill I have ever heard presented which is recommended chiefly on the ground that its principal features will never be applied. That is an astonishing proposition. I am sure that it is sincerely made. My right hon. Friend says that he wishes to carry out all these measures by voluntary means. The method he adopts to carry it through by voluntary means, however, is government by minatory exhortation and that is not a good way of governing. Minatory exhortation, whatever it may be, is not the same thing as the purposeful planning which I thought we were elected to execute.\n\nMy right hon. Friend says that his purpose and desire is to carry through these propositions by voluntary means, but he is still introducing, as an addition to the original Bill, a whole series of further measures and the House must consider the possibilities of those measures being put into operation and the consequences if all the eventualities foreseen by the Government were to develop. It is when we look at these consequences that many of us find the strongest objections.\n\nWe had deep objection to the proposition in the original Bill that certain penalties could be imposed upon trade unionists for activities they might carry out. But the offences for which these penalties can be applied have been greatly extended by Part IV. I have given a specific example before and I apply it now but in slightly different terms. It is the case of the railwaymen.\n\nMy right hon. Friend says that he hopes to carry out this Measure by voluntary means. But is the withholding of a wage increase from the railwaymen a 1773 voluntary act? It is not voluntary on their part. If we asked them, they would say, \"Let us have it\". Indeed, I have a message from the National Executive of the N.U.R. supporting what I have said. The Government are, presumably, saying to British Railways that it must not pay. That is not a voluntary act for those who will not get the money.\n\nAlready, there are features of compulsion in the Bill although my right hon. Friend says that he wants to rely on voluntary means. Presumably, the sanction is that if British Railways paid what it is committed to pay under bargain to the rail way men, or if the railway men accept the increase, my right hon. Friend would invoke his powers and recall Parliament to put into operation the sanctions contained in the Bill.\n\nIn that sense, although I am sure that my right hon. Friend is sincere in wishing the Measure to be carried through voluntarily, the element of compulsion is already present and is applied in circumstances and with results which to me are highly objectionable. The most serious feature of the Bill is the broken bargains, the broken promises to the railwaymen and many others. Once we break bargains we will not be able to make such bargains so readily or advantageously for the community in future. In any case, we have no right to break these bargains and Parliament should not be a party to it. Yet that is what we are doing, and I object.\n\nThe proposition that the House should agree under a wage freeze to break bargains with the railwaymen and others involved, totalling about 6 million workers—[An HON. MEMBER: \"Including the doctors.\"] I include doctors among these workers—has never been accepted by any representative body of the Labour movement either within or without this House. It was never put to the electorate at the General Election. Had it been, most of us would have strongly repudiated it. When the right hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) implicated the then Government in the breach of such bargains, my right hon. Friend and the rest of the Labour Party protested most strongly. So now I protest on the same ground that the objections were made in 1961.\n\nWhat makes my heart sink most about the policies which the Government are 1774 following is that we are embarked on a deep, savage and, I fear, long-term deflation in defiance of all the doctrines that we have preached about the proper measures for dealing with our economic difficulties. On all previous occasions when Governments have embarked on deflationary measures, one of the remedies has been that the increases in wages prevented the worst effects of the deflation. That happened in 1961 and 1957 and on earlier occasions. But not on this occasion.\n\nIf the Government are successful in carrying through the wage standstill successfully they will be depriving themselves of the kind of protection against the worst effects of deflation which have operated on previous occasions. I am bitterly sorry to see a Labour Government embarked on a course upon which I never thought to see it embark. We are on the wrong course. Some of us have tried to get this through to the Government and maybe some members of the Government themselves may think that we are on the wrong course. We want to get them on to a different course.\n\nI cannot expatiate on alternative measures which can be taken, but they are available. Solutions are within our grasp. We can have full economic independence if we have the courage and determination to grasp it. But this Measure will not secure it for us. Speaking for myself, I find this proposition of the Government deeply objectionable, partly because of the essence of the Measure and partly because of the manner in which it has been presented for my approval. The Government have, in effect, thrown it at me and said, \"Gulp this down, or else\". But I am not prepared to do it.\n\nI do not believe that if I did I would be properly discharging my obligations to those who sent me here. In my belief, my primary concern as an M.P. must be, in the open, on the Floor of the House, to discharge as best I can the obligations I have to those who sent me here. I am sure that all members of the Government are seeking to discharge their responsibilities as best they can—I make no accusation against their motives or intentions. But I demand the same right to be able to say and speak and vote in the House according to what I believe to be right for the nation and in conformity 1775 with the undertakings and policies I declared at the General Election.\n\nI do not believe that it is good for the health of politics that politicians should stand on their heads and pretend that they are doing nothing of the sort. Politicians must say in the House what they say in the country, and that is what I propose to try and do to the best of my ability.\n\n§ Mr. Maurice Macmillan (Farnham)\n\nIt is a pleasure for me to speak following the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), particularly since he finds himself in this debate in a similar position to that in which I found myself in 1961. I have been induced to intervene having listened to the speeches of a number of hon. Gentlemen opposite. Their arguments—and I refer to the remarks of many hon. Gentlemen opposite, and not only those from below the Gangway—and the arguments adduced from the Treasury Bench have strengthened my conviction that this is a bad and dangerous Bill.\n\nThe Measure is bad for the country and dangerous to liberty. In the manner in which it is being brought before Parliament, it is derogatory to the whole concept of parliamentary government. It is bad and dangerous not only because of what it will do now, but because of the implications it has for the future, for the Government are giving themselves and any future Administration, by the Bill, the Industrial Reorganisation Bill and parts of the Iron and Steel Bill greater economic powers and greater powers of potential direction than any previous Government in Britain have ever taken, in time of peace or, I believe, in war.\n\nThe Bill is also bad and dangerous because, as the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Party pointed out there is no prospect of productivity catching up, to use one of the First Secretary's phrases. And, as usual with this Government there is nothing in the Bill except for the short-term, along with their usual willingness to sacrifice our long-term prospects for a superficial and doubtful short-term gain. The country will, therefore, depend on a degree of governmental 1776 control and persuasion which, I believe, is totally unworkable.\n\nThe Bill is bad and dangerous at this moment and for the immediate future because the Government have slid into a sort of neo-syndicalist policy, both in their economic and political approach, for they are prepared to damage liberty and harm industrial relations by trying to induce trade unionists to cut their own throats and, if they refuse the knife, to force it into the hands of management.\n\nIn what I admit was a wonderful, almost convincing, speech yesterday, the First Secretary really only made my case stronger. He admitted that his previous policy for voluntary incomes restraint had failed—failed as it did in the days of Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr. Dalton, who had greater apparatus of centralised control than ever before—that is, until this Measure was introduced. Indeed, it did not even have the limited success which the Day pause of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) had.\n\nSometimes, when listening to the First Secretary, I thought that the voice was that of Belper but the words were those of Wirral. I attacked them in 1961, but at least my right hon. and learned Friend achieved a limited degree of success, which is more than this policy has any hope of doing. Now the First Secretary still hopes that a voluntary policy will succeed. But how can a policy be described as truly voluntary if, behind it, is the threat which we are being asked to put into the Bill and which the right hon. Gentleman is seeking to disguise as an appeal to the national interest?\n\nThe First Secretary calls it a \"national emergency\". It is, in fact, a situation created by a Government who lacked the courage to act in time, who refused even to consider the smallest restraint of demand and who are now faced with a degree of deflation which makes the deflation policy of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral look like a modest and minor effort indeed. In this emergency, which the First Secretary has himself helped to create, the right hon. Gentleman is hoping to force people other than the Government to accept the main responsibility for the action that is needed.\n\n1777 Not least of the dangers in the Bill is the political danger. The Government are shelving their proper responsibility while seeking, at the same time, to increase their powers. They are disclaiming in advance the blame for any failure on the part of those on whom they are seeking to place this responsibility. According to the Government, the T.U.C. and the C.B.I., the trade unionists must create the conditions in which a voluntary policy will work—and if they do not do that, then it will be their fault that compulsion is introduced—remembering that it will be introduced if necessary, regardless of its effect on industrial relations.\n\nOn the T.U.C. and the C.B.I., according to the Government, will rest the main responsibility for implementing stage two of this policy, regardless of the effect that will have, the conflict of loyalties and the almost intolerable position in which it will place both management and labour. The issues are blurred by the Government's attempt to create a sort of false consensus of opinion, and it means that the incomes policy is becoming less under the control of the Government while the penalties are there for those to whom they have passed this responsibility.\n\nNo wonder Parliament is declining in importance in the eyes of the country when we see the contempt of Parliamentary procedure and practice—contempt of the rights of hon. Members—which the Bill, especially Part IV of it, entails. This is a pretence at policy; trying to justify a centralisation of power which is irrelevant and dangerous and which will not even work as well as Danegeld worked. The greatest threat of all is the threat to liberty and, in threatening liberty, there is no doubt that the unions and workpeople in combination will be affected the most.\n\nIt is no good the Under-Secretary saying that a prices and incomes policy is just as important as the conventions established in a previous era. What were those conventions? They represented the absolute freedom to bargain; the right to sell or withhold one's labour. These are fundamental rights in this country and the sole basis on which a system of free enterprise can be erected. The private sector of our free enterprise economy can, no 1778 doubt, survive any attempts by the Government at price fixing or dividend limitation, but not without causing damage to investment and distorting the capital market. It is bound to have some evil effects, although it will not go to the root problems we face in our system of free choice which depends on the effort and reward of individuals. This attempt to interfere with the most fundamental rights of free men to sell or withhold their labour is bound to have evil effects.\n\nThe hon. Member for Poplar (Mr. Mikardo) and the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale made it clear—and, without appearing to be impertinent, I believe they are right—that there is a case for having some greater control than I would like to see if there is to be a centralised economy, with control of wages, in a centrally planned Socialist economy. However, the hon. Member for Poplar pointed out that that was intolerable in a market economy, and he was right. No one would seek to argue that in the great trade union movement there is not implied a responsibility on those unions in this matter. If Britain and the union movement is to survive, the unions must co-operate to a reasonable degree with management and Government.\n\nI still think that when it comes to restrictive practices it is the primary responsibility of management to cope with the situation that we now have, no matter how it may have arisen. That is what those in management are hired to do. But how can they do it if the Government are to forbid them to buy the rule book? Why should people accept the dislocation of modernisation, and give up the soft option of protection for higher productivity if there is no benefit for them now or in the future?\n\nI have no doubt that the First Secretary's voluntary system is the end of the effectiveness of the free-choice economy, that it cripples investment—and all for nothing, because in the end it will lead only to stagnation and, I fear, unemployment, especially if we are moving to a more deflationary situation in the world as a whole.\n\nIf I may say so, I thought that the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Iorwerth Thomas) showed some of the same illusions that have already corrupted clear thinking on both sides of 1779 the House, and have done even in the past: that the only alternative to a bad policy is to let things stand as they are. It is not. As the hon. Member said, one could put forward a perfectly good policy—though not in this debate. Although I agree with what the hon. Gentleman had to say this time, I do not suppose that our ideas of a suitable policy to get the country out of its difficulty would be precisely the same.\n\nIn 1961, I begged the then Chancellor of the Exchequer not to take short-term measures that damaged our long-term prospects. I fear that it is now too late to plead with the First Secretary, who has even forgotten his own child's first name; he referred to his prices and incomes policy, and left out productivity until reminded of it from this side of the House. The position is not improved by the Under-Secretary's rather patronising reference and comparatively short attention to expansion or productivity as against his emphasis on restraint.\n\nWe on this side can argue a strong case for the free-enterprise system, and there is a wrong but equally powerful intellectual argument for the sort of State socialism recommended by the hon. Member for Poplar, but there is nothing to be said for this bastard brand of State capitalism and centralised control which the First Secretary is putting forward, and which has nothing but restriction. There is nothing about incentives and investment—only negative thinking.\n\nLip service is paid to people's standard of living, but so little is said about raising it, and so little is said about opportunity. It is not Part IV that I resent so much as the rigidity of the ideas in the rest of the Bill, the lack of clarity about what we do when we start up again. There may be priorities in taking off restriction, but nothing is said about how we are to increase the effort or stop the freeze, and nothing about where we go from here.\n\nI was, perhaps, a little unkind in 1961 to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral. The words I used about the then Government were harsh, but many hon. Members would agree that, applied to the present Government, they are a gross understatement. I then said: 1780 … I do not believe they have.. a definite idea of what their objective should be. We all accept the need for occasionally turning off the main road and, so to speak, making a detour because of necessity and then coming back when we can to the main road, but the Government are wandering about in the highways and byways and lanes without even knowing where the main road is.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th February, 1961; Vol. 634, c. 89.] The presentation of this Bill, and the manner of its presentation, have made that clearer to the House and, I hope, to the country than anything that the present Government have yet done.\n\n§ Mr. Peter Hordern (Horsham)\n\nI am sure that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) will forgive me if I do not follow him too closely, particularly in his criticisms of economists, because my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is an economist and he is to wind up the debate on behalf of the Opposition. My hon. Friend is well able to defend himself.\n\n1785 The Bill marks the end of confidence in the Government's credibility both at home and abroad, for the stronger the powers they take—they are very considerable powers in Part IV—the less confidence they engender in their capacity to control the economy. It also marks, although this is not such an important point, the end of a myth held by the Labour Party, namely, that it can, by planning, by talk of collusion or consultation with both sides of industry, avoid any semblance of stop-go. This is how the Prime Minister described it on so many occasions in glittering phraseology. For 13 years, while the Labour Party was in Opposition, Labour Members held this myth very true and very dear to their hearts, that it was possible by planning—by purposive planning, whatever the adjective was which was used at that time—to avoid the series of stop-go that every economy in the free world had experienced. This was the idea that Labour Members had had very firmly implanted in their own minds by the Prime Minister himself.\n\nThis is the end of that myth. It is the end of a period of 13 years of fractious and irresponsible opposition led by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition. Hon. Members opposite now know that the whole rationale behind their so-called policies has completely disappeared. The promised land of the Prime Minister has turned out to be nothing more than a mirage. Labour Members know that for them things will never be quite the same again. So much for the Labour Party.\n\nThe economy will perhaps never be quite the same again so long as this Labour Government are in power. Hon. Members opposite know that they are now adopting measures in the Bill—or proposing to adopt measures, if Part IV should be invoked—which every Labour Member must have described at the election as Tory Measures. There have never been so many conversions since the early days of Christianity, nor quite so quickly.\n\nWhat is more important is that hon. Members opposite are now beginning—or at least the Treasury Bench is beginning—to wake up to the reality of the situation into which they have pitched the country. It is against this sombre background that 1786 we must now view the Bill, and in particular Part IV.\n\nWhat are the circumstances against which the Bill will operate? We on this side recall very well that before the election the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke in terms of no severe increases in taxation. We recall how the Chancellor aimed at three objectives in his first post-election Budget, when he introduced the Selective Employment Tax as an alternative to hire-purchase controls and the regulator. Now, as the House knows, we have both those things.\n\nOne objective was growing industrial strength. We now have stagnant production and an actual decline in the rate of investment. Full employment was another objective. Now the Prime Minister has said that a rate of 1.6 per cent. is acceptable—that is, 480,000 unemployed.\n\nThe Chancellor's third objective was a strong £. Sterling is now constantly at the support level and War Loan is at its lowest level ever. It is no wonder that the Chancellor is looking with hungry eyes at the Foreign Office. As far as one can judge, the sooner he is off on some form of trade delegation to South America the better.\n\nThe Bill must be considered against the background of the Chancellor's and the Government's refusal to regulate the level of demand. This is why the Bill has had to be introduced. The Government no longer has the status to call for voluntary agreements. In any case, a voluntary wage freeze cannot work with unemployment at its present level. In Committee we were told that 6 million workers—that is, one-quarter of the labour force—have some form of contract of employment. Yesterday, the First Secretary expressed the hope that there would be voluntary restraint; he hoped that both sides would, in the period of voluntary restraint, consult and agree to defer increases which have been awarded under a contract signed between employer and employee. The First Secretary expressed the hope that the employee would postpone his right to his side of the contract.\n\nI do not suppose that the trade unions have missed the replies which were made and the further questions which were then posed to the First Secretary. We asked what would happen in the event of an employee suing his employer at that stage? The First Secretary said that in 1787 that event the employer must pay up in order that he should not be found liable to legal action. This was the only thing the First Secretary could say.\n\nTherefore, with 6 million workers involved, what real chance is there of a voluntary system working, when a trade union has only to threaten legal action for employers—quite rightly, according to the First Secretary—to say straight way, \"We must honour our legal obligations\"? This is quite apart from the points which have been made about the sanctity of contracts entered into by individuals, a matter where the Government have no right to interpose themselves.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, is it right that the economy should be so frozen and, as it were, put into a deep freeze? Is it right—is it possible—in this present state of full employment, to prevent firms from offering inducements in kind, not necessarily in wages, to other workers to draw them into their factories where they can perhaps use them better? Is it right that trade union leaders should be asked not to do what they were elected by their own members to do? We on this side do not think that it is right.\n\nI believe that Part IV will have to be introduced. It will have to be introduced at the very time when unemployment will begin to rise.\n\nAlthough I do not think that the voluntary part of the Bill will work at all, there will nevertheless be some effect on the level of prices. Because the level of prices will perhaps be moderately reduced from what it would otherwise have been had there been no price freeze, it will undoubtedly have an effect on the total level of investment.\n\nI believe that that is why the First Secretary tendered his resignation. It was not just because he saw that the framework of the National Plan was to be demolished, but because he saw what the trend of investment was likely to be. The impact, if a price freeze should actually work, is likely to be even worse than the right hon. Gentleman feared. Because it will work pretty quickly, the effect on profits will be such that there will not be any money available for investment.\n\nTherefore, the effect of Part IV, which in my view will have to be invoked, will 1788 begin to be felt precisely at the time when firms are already reducing their investment plans. Therefore, Part IV will take effect at the worst possible time.\n\nWe on this side want to be sure that the price freeze, if it is to work voluntarily, will at least be operated voluntarily by the nationalised industries, too. Can the Under-Secretary explain why the South-West Gas Board, in an announcement dated 29th July——\n\n§ Mr. John Biffen (Oswestry)\n\nThe hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Park) has made a powerful contribution to the debate this evening as he did on Second Reading. I was in the Chamber for the Second Reading of the Bill and I enjoyed his speech then and was even accused by one of his hon. Friends of nodding in agreement with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. I did not nod in much agreement with the second half of his contribution this evening, but by rather different methods we may have arrived at limited agreement in our conclusions.\n\nWhat interested me very much about the hon. Member's speech was that coming at what is normally a dead hour in a debate, at twenty minutes past eight on the Third Reading of a Bill at this stage of the Parliamentary year, there was an extraordinary number of Members in the Chamber to hear it. That is Parliament's way of expressing its conviction that this is one of the most important 1802 Bills likely to come before the House during this Session. This is Parliament's way of asserting that it agrees that an incomes policy is central to the Government's entire economic policy and that the Bill is the legislative embodiment of that incomes policy.\n\nAt the outset, it is necessary to define one or two terms, because the expression \"incomes policy\" has been thrown around fairly liberally. Last night, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, the hon. Lady the Member for Hitchin (Mrs. Shirley Williams), speaking with the enthusiasm of a detergent salesman saying that no decent household was without one, said that not one industrial community in the Western world was without an incomes policy. That statement needs examination.\n\nThe hon. Lady quoted the Three Wise Men, as they were in the days of Mr. Peter Thorneycroft, and the example of Germany. This is a novel interpretation as to what constitutes an incomes policy because what goes on in Germany and what was provided by the Three Wise Men is in no sense consistent with what we see as the developing policy that reaches its culmination in this Bill. Whereas many of us may support bodies which seek to illumine and inform us on the workings of a complex modern industrial society, and we argued in that light on Part I of the Bill, the real nature of a Labour incomes policy is that it seeks to give to a central power the capability of identifying, and of selecting and then instructing.\n\nThat is what the Bill is all about and that is why there is repeatedly reference to the Secretary of State; \"The Secretary of State and another Minister acting jointly may refer …\"; or \"The Secretary of State may by order apply this section …\" The whole of Part II, Clauses 7 to 8, is concerned to give to a central power, to the First Secretary of State and those who are associated with him, a limited power of price and income control. There can be no doubt about this and my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Kenneth Lewis) must take all of this into account, because I agree with the hon. Member for Lewisham, North (Mr. Moyle) when he said that in certain instances Part IV and Part II were not altogether dissimilar.\n\n1803 In both instances, they seek to give to the First Secretary certain powers of intervention. There are penalty Clauses, arising from failure to carry out parts of the Bill. There were other very considerable differences between the parts, but there are certain similarities. My fear is that we are only seeing the beginning of this process. At the moment, the provisions of the Bill lay down a four-month standstill, a four-month price and income control. This is made up of one month during which the price or income is notified to the First Secretary so that he may decide what he is going to do, and three months thereafter while it is with the Prices and Incomes Board. There are already signs that this will drift into something much more than a four-month standstill. Many of our discussions, upstairs and here, on Report, have been concerned with mortgages.\n\nI would like to remind the House of what the Minister of Housing and Local Government said yesterday. He said: In the Government's view, the national interest will best be served if increases in interest rates notified to existing borrowers, but not yet effective, are not implemented until the National Board for Prices and Incomes has reported on this subject. This report should be available towards the middle of October.\"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th August, 1966; Vol. 733, c. 1396.] What the Minister is suggesting is not that the price should be fixed, controlled, until three months after the reference to the Board, but until the Board has reported. The reference was made on 20th May and three months afterwards will be 20th August. We are now informed that the report is not likely to be available until mid-October.\n\nVery well, today it is the building societies, today it is someone in the dock who, in a sense, is a fairly obvious object of political pillory. But the time will come when it will be a manufacturer, the time will come when it will be a trade union leader—doubtless a small group of trade union leaders, perhaps politically motivated and tightly-knit. I have no doubt on the existing evidence of the way that the Government has behaved that what is good for the Minister of Housing and Local Government with the building societies today can be good over a much wider range of 1804 manufacturers and trade union leaders in the months to come.\n\nBecause this incomes policy is discriminatory and interventionist and is acknowledged to be such by Members on the Treasury Bench and by supporters such as the hon. Member for Lewisham, North, it is not just going to be concerned with fact-finding. It will want to look for sub-contractors.\n\nThere is nothing in the Bill which leads us to believe that the administrative machine is anything like capable of dealing with the quantity of price notification and income notification that will come its way. Therefore, it will seek, naturally, to operate through bodies like the T.U.C. and the C.B.I.\n\nI ask the House to consider the implications in Clause 16, as it affects incomes increases. If this is to be operated substantially through available organisations, what I would call die sub-contracting agencies, which must be the trade unions, then one must take note of the fact that less than 50 per cent. of workers are members of unions. If one is in a union one will feel that one is much more likely to be affected by the incomes policy than a fellow worker who is non-unionised. This is a perfectly natural conclusion and reaction to provisions of this kind.\n\nWithin the whole spectrum of employment incomes it is bound to touch the wage-earner more than the salary-earner. I say this, again on the same question of organisation, and I have a little evidence to support this. From the Census of Population I have a calculation that 31 per cent. of those receiving employment incomes were salary-earners. I asked the Ministry of Labour if I could be told the figures known to it of salary and wage-earners who had received increases of income during 1965.\n\nThe figures given, when broken down, reveal that of the total number known to the Ministry to have received increases, only 11 per cent. referred to salary-earners. No one in the House believes for a moment that the salary-earners have not been receiving rates of increase any less than wage-earners. It is widely known that they are in step. Yet we know that there are roughly 30 per cent. of salary-earners as a percentage of total employment incomes and only 11 per cent. are known to have received increases.\n\n1805 On the simple question of practicability, the way in which this will be administered, it is bound to be seen to be likely to affect wage-earners rather than salary-earners. This is particularly true of Clause 4. When I hear talk about social justice being enshrined in the operation of Part IV of this Bill I begin to have very serious doubts. I talked to one employer and his reaction was, \"I suppose that this covers centrally negotiated wages?\" I said, \"No, it covers everything.\" He said, \"We are going to have very great difficulty in keeping our key salaried staff, They are the people going off to America and we cannot afford to see them go. The cost of replacement of these people is considerable.\"\n\nMake no mistake, while Part IV may be invoked successfully against people in the £15 to £25 bracket, above that range the sheer market forces will still operate, whatever may be said. To suggest otherwise is to delude the House. The railwayman who finds he is not to get his 3½ per cent. increase cannot \"up sticks\" and practise his skills in North America. But this is undoubtedly true of many professional people on contracts with salaries of £2,000, £3,000, £4,000, £5,000 and more a year. That is the reality of the situation. I only ask that we accept it and realise it. It is not right that the House should be told that social justice will be protected by the operation of Part IV.\n\nI turn to the operation of the Clauses relating to prices. Prices affecting goods are much more readily known that prices affecting services. This is a sheer administrative factor. The Government will know much more about price movements of physical goods than they know about the price movements of services. Much of the argument we have heard about the Selective Employment Tax relationship between services and manufacturing industry will be inverted. It will be stood on its head in the next few months and under the longer term provisions of Part II.\n\nThe argument which I have sought to deploy substantiates the almost pedantic concern which a number of my hon. Friends and myself have expressed about Government statistics over the past few months. The whole purpose was merely 1806 to demonstrate that once we place these levers of power in Whitehall to be pulled by the First Secretary, or whoever the Minister might be, the information available is the real point of power. Knowledge is power. Certainly, the limitations of knowledge available to the central machine reveal the limitations, arbitrariness and unfairness of this policy.\n\nThe Bill is a vindication of the scepticism expressed from these benches from the very early days of this Labour Government. The Parliamentary Secretary said, \"Twenty months ago we did not think that we should have to introduce a Bill of this kind\". But some of us did. We argued that there would be a drift from the voluntary system to elements of compulsion. We are not sure that we have yet come to the end of the drift. I am not sure that the Government will not after a year say, \"we were blown off course\". The Prime Minister, at the airport on his return from Washington, said that we had been blown a bit off course. It may take a little longer to get back on course than we realise.\n\nThe right hon. Gentleman will say, \"Sacrifices are being made\". I can imagine that we shall be asked perhaps not to invoke Part IV, but to adjust the standstill periods in Part II. It was said that the Government would try to operate the freeze through Part H. Then we should not had had this rubbish, almost this obscenity, about breaking contracts under Part IV. We thought that we would go a long way towards getting a freeze under Part II. This fear is still with us.\n\nThe incomes policy of the Government has been presented as an exercise in national co-operation. It is absolutely nothing of the sort. It is an exercise in Whitehall discrimination. The Bill is a greater testimony to that than any of the powerful doubts expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell). Those of us who have criticised the Bill and the policy have argued with restraint and, I hope, some degree of responsibility. But make no mistake: we regard the Bill as unacceptable under two broad and, I think, fundamental heads. First, it is a token of lawless Government, and I cannot do more than echo the words of the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot). Secondly, 1807 I believe that it still represents an escape from economic realism.\n\nNo more foolish words were spoken than those uttered by Mr. Clive Jenkins, of the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians, when he said that the Bill should not have been published in English because it was intended for a continental audience. No banker would care a ha'porth for the Bill; it means nothing. The hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Roebuck) talked about the Bill having some effect on inflation. I do not think that that is a story which would win the heart of a single banker. He is looking at the £500 million deflation which the Prime Minister has already produced, superimposed on the many other measures. I at least have the courage of the Prime Minister's convictions. I think that deflation was necessary and should be allowed to work, but, believing that, I regard the Bill as a totally irrelevant nonsense.\n\n§ Mr. Eric G. Varley (Chesterfield)\n\nI hope that the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) will forgive me if I do not follow him in all the details of his speech, because I wish to be brief and to put on record some of my objections to the Bill. I was not successful enough to be called on Second Reading, I did not have the honour to be a member of the Standing Committee, and I would not like the Bill to pass without at least stating briefly, probably exclusively from the trade union point of view, some of my objections to the Bill.\n\nI have been a relatively short time in the House of Commons, and naturally from time to time Measures come before the House which require a certain amount of digesting. I have found that I could digest every piece of legislation introduced by the present Government except, possibly, for this one. No Measure has stuck in my throat more than this one. If Clause 16 and Part IV of the Bill are activated, I think that there will be considerable industrial unrest throughout the country.\n\nOnly this morning I had a letter from my constituency, from a joint shop stewards' committee, from which I would like to read an extract. It states: We have already felt the effect of this\"— that is, the Bill— in our factory, as a domestic agreement signed by the shop stewards for some increases in pay for a section of our members, signed 26th June, to operate on 1st August, is now proclaimed by the management to be illegal under the terms of the new Bill. My correspondent goes on to say that managements are able to sit back and refuse everything on the plea of being loyal to the Government and that frustration and disillusionment will spread through the movement. I am assuming that the chairman of the joint shop stewards' committee was referring to the Labour movement.\n\n1809 I know that shop stewards' committee. They are very hard bargainers. They are shrewd men. The factory in which they work is reasonably well equipped, reasonably modern and efficient. The profits are reasonably high. Labour relations have been reasonably good, and I understand—I have lived in the Chesterfield constituency all my life—that there has been no unconstitutional action at this factory. I know, however, that if the full terms of the Bill are applied, as I think that they will be, unofficial action is likely.\n\nMy right hon. Friend the First Secretary has said throughout the stages of the Bill that he hoped to maintain the voluntary system and voluntary agreement. As a consequence of these statements, some of us have watched the deliberations and reports of the Trades Union Congress. I have certainly formed the opinion—and I know this goes for quite a few of my hon. Friends—that the T.U.C. is only half-hearted about this Bill. In a phrase, we could probably say that it is acquiescing to it.\n\nThere is no doubt that in the T.U.C. there is a tremendous amount of good will for this Government. It wants the Government to succeed. Of this I am absolutely sure, as many of us on this side want them to succeed, but there are some members of the General Council, I am sure, who are not carrying their rank and file or individual unions with them on this Measure. I can think of my own union in particular. I do not think they are necessarily carrying their own members with them. There are those trade unionists, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Cousins) who will have nothing at all to do with this Bill. There are many secretaries of trade unions who have said precisely the same thing, and they will refuse to cooperate.\n\nThis brings me to my point about the maintenance of the voluntary principle. What happens to the voluntary principle if it is breached by my right hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton on behalf of the Transport and General Workers Union, or if it is breached by some other union? What happens to the loyal section of the T.U.C. General Council? What will they do? It is my view that they will probably totter along to the First Secretary and say, \"Really, First Secretary, you ought to introduce the compulsory 1810 part very quickly and protect us\", because I am suggesting to the House that it is very difficult for a trade union leader to tell his members to hold back on a wage claim when those very same members see people in similar occupations, and being represented by a different trade union, winning a wage award and getting the policy breached. So it is my opinion that the First Secretary will be asked in some cases to bring the compulsory part of the Bill into operation as soon as possible.\n\nThen I think we have to ask ourselves this question, too: is it a good law? By a good law I mean one which is enforceable. I do not think this is enforceable. My mind begins to boggle when I look at some of the consequences which could arise for an individual trade unionist and certain trade unions. I was brought up, and have lived nearly all my adult life, in a mining village, and I know that in a mining village there is a tremendous amount of solidarity; they stand together in a case of industrial dispute. If the compulsory part of this Bill is put into operation and certain trade union leaders have to go to gaol or are fined as a consequence of it, there will be absolute chaos, and the Government should remember that we still need a fair bit of coal yet if we are to achieve all of our objects. I know that the coal industry, to some extent, is running down, but, nevertheless, if the Government understand this we should ask them to look at it again.\n\nI have a great deal of respect for my right hon. Friend the First Secretary,—for his tenacity, and for his zeal, and for the method in which he tries to pursue the things in which he believes. However, I feel that this Bill is constructed in a manner which is likely to cause a great amount of industrial unrest. I hope it does not, but I think that it is highly likely that it will. It will most certainly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Park) said, injure this unique Labour Party-trade union relationship, and I think that time will prove that this Bill is both unwise and unnecessary and ought not to have been introduced.\n\n§ Sir Cyril Osborne (Louth)\n\nI entirely agree with what the hon. Member for 1811 Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) has just said, and with the burden of his argument that the Bill will be unenforceable. On that ground alone, I think that it ought to be withdrawn. I think it fair to say that the Bill gives pleasure to nobody. No one loves it. It is a tragedy for the Labour Party, for the Labour Government, and for the whole country.\n\nFour and a half months ago, we came back as a new Parliament, and hon. Members opposite assembled with great glee, almost equal to that in 1945, thinking that the new Jerusalem was just round the corner. Not one of them would have believed last April that a Bill of this nature would be brought into the House by their own Government. It is a greater tragedy for them than it is for us, but it is a tragedy also for the nation.\n\nThe country is asking what has gone wrong in the past four and a half short months to cause the Government to bring in a crazy Bill like this. What justification is there for it and for trying to ram down the throats of trade unionists what obviously they will not accept? The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Hugh D. Brown) revealed the crisis within the crisis when he said that he was not aware that there was a crisis. He asked: why bring in a Bill like this? In his innocence, he wanted to know what is wrong with the country.\n\nMay I make three quick comments in reply to the hon. Gentleman? The Prime Minister's policy will deliberately create an unemployment figure of 460,000. That, to me, is serious. By next February, unless we are lucky, it may roll on to 1 million. The problem that we are facing is a worldwide one. There is a world deflationary wave collecting force now. In my worst moments, I feel that it could engulf us all, as it did in 1931. During the last two or three years, though no fault of their own, the Government have had to borrow about £1,200 million from abroad. Our total reserves are £1,134 million. We have not a brass farthing in the \"kitty\"; it is all borrowed, and in three years' time we have to repay it. We have to earn £1,200 million to keep our promise. That is the crisis. Going round the country, and talking to the men with whom I work, the problem as I see it is that they do not realise it.\n\n1812 The charges which I bring against the Government are, first, that the Bill will not work. It has not a hope in you-know-where of working. The second charge is that the Government have never convinced all sections of the nation of the gravity of the situation. The real problem before the nation is that we are living beyond our means, and the Bill does nothing to cure that basic fault. It does nothing to increase the productivity of the nation or to increase our industrial efficiency, and those are the two things which are needed. The simple fact is that we are fooling ourselves.\n\nHon. Members who have been here for many years know that I have pleaded hard for a prices and incomes policy. Such a policy, on a voluntary basis, is not only necessary and just, but inevitable. It is in everyone's interest to keep prices down. However, if we are to do that, in the same way we have to keep incomes down, because the two must march together.\n\nThe policy is right, but the Government are going the wrong way about it to achieve their end. The hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Iorwerth Thomas) referred to the fear of unemployment, and the debates that we had in 1947. He quoted the circular written by the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot"
