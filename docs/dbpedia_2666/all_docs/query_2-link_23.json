Very few weeks remain before 1 984 will become \"Once\n\nupon a time. \"\n\nIt was 132 years ago last July 4th when Jacob McQuillan nailed a coffee mill t o a tree in Racine Township.\n\nThis marked the first homestead claim in Mower County. There have been thousands of epic happenings in our\n\ncounty since that date in 1852. In 416 pages we have tried to provide an overall verbal picture of the years. We\n\nare grateful for the many stories and pictures which have been volunteered to make this book possible.\n\nThere was a common thread which ran through the histories of churches, schools, farms, businesses and\n\nvillages. They were begun with strong faith and then over the succeeding years they endured hardships. Now\n\npresent generations look back over the past with gratitude and anticipate the future with confidence. We have a\n\ndeep respect for the character of those who began and for those who carry on the heritage of Mower County.\n\nWe have leaned heavily on many during the months we developed this history. The A ustin Daily Herald\n\nallowed us to dig into their old files and to reprint the stories we found. Mrs. Harold J. Davison, Vern Judd, the\n\nMower County Historical Society and others let us borrow many historic photos. Harold Rochford furnished us\n\nmuch material and assistance. In over four score years Harold has acquired a broad knowledge of Mower\n\nCounty history and the acquaintanceship of hundreds of individuals . His memory of events was infallible and his\n\ncooperation was invaluable.\n\nFour hundred plus pages seemed a huge obstacle as we compiled our material. Then, during the final\n\nmonths, the number of pages available became inadequate. Regretfully, there were biographies and stories for\n\nwhich we could not find space.\n\nThe people of Mower County are fond of many sports. To do justice to the county sports history we would\n\nhave required another hundred or more pages. We bequeath the opportunity for a history of Mower County\n\nsports to a future historian.\n\nThough we have tried very hard to be accurate, we know there will be errors and omissions. We apologize for\n\nthe defects and thank the many people who have cooperated with us so freely.\n\nMower County has a fine heritage with people of character and a future to anticipate.\n\nRichard Stive1'8\n\nRichard Stivers\n\nDeanne Aherns\n\nArlene Bonnes\n\nMike Chaffee\n\nRobert Foss\n\nEleanor Foss\n\nMrs. Margaret F .

In another part of this book a section on\n\nTownships will include the histories of towns and villages . Much of the specialized history on farms will be in the Agriculture\n\nsection. Therefore, this section covers the stories and photos which are of general interest to all readers.\n\nMany times the newspaper editors of the early days wrote in a direct and comfortable style. It might be called journalism\n\nwith the shoes off. We have adopted this style with the hope that reading it will be like a trip back to the old homeplace.\n\nSection I covers a period of years into the 1 870's . This provides the background for the remainder of the story. The\n\nfocus of our history is on the period beginning in 191 1 . For this reason there is a lapse between the 1870's and 191 1 .\n\nA thousand pages would not furnish a complete history of Mower County. We know that when this volume is finished\n\nwe will have omitted more than we have inserted. This leaves an opportunity for the next individual or group to add to\n\nthe chronicle.\n\nPrevious historians have been lavish in their praise of this county and the people in it. We, who have written these\n\npages have developed a new respect for the thousands of people who have made Mower County a good place to live. '\n\nE. N. J.\n\nOUR LAND HAD A WILD BEAUTY\n\nIt would be difficult to improve on the description of\n\nthe area which we call Mower County, as given in the\n\n1 9 1 1 Mower County History.\n\n\"The buffalo, the elk and the deer, for centuries\n\nroamed the wild prairies and woodlands. Fishes basked\n\nin its rippling streams ; the muskrat, the otter and the\n\nmink gamboled upon the ice in winter. Ducks, geese and\n\nother aquatic fowls, in countless numbers, covered the\n\nstreams in summer. The prairie wolves howled upon\n\ntheir hillocks. Cowardlike, they were always ready to\n\nattack and destroy the weak and defenseless . Pocket\n\ngophers went on their interminable underground operations.\n\nGrouse and prairie chickens cackled, crowed and\n\nstrutted in all their pride. \"\n\n\"Blizzards and cyclones swept unheeded across its\n\ndomains. The autumnal prairie fires, in all their terrible\n\ngrandeur and weird beauty, lighted the heavens by night\n\nand clouded the sun by day. Age after age added richness\n\nto the soil and prepared it to be one of the most productive\n\nfields of the world. \"\n\nThose Who Claimed-and Those Who Possessed\n\nThere were nations which claimed the area which\n\nembraces Mower County from the time of Christopher\n\nColumbus . Yet the actual use and possession of this\n\nregion was by various tribes of Indians .\n\nOn May 4 1493, Spain made a papal grant, making\n\nindefinite claims to lands north and northwest of her\n\nsettlements in Mexico, Florida and the West Indies.\n\nWith the arrival of the English, Mower County was included\n\nin their claim to the lands west of their Atlantic\n\ncoast settlements. Likewise, France claimed this region\n\nas a part of the lands south, west and southwest of their\n\nCanadian settlements.\n\nThe first definite claim to this territory was made by\n\nLaSalle at the mouth of the Mississippi on March 8,\n\n1682, in the name of the king of France. Even more\n\ndefinite was the French claim made by Perrot near the\n\nsite of Trempealeau, Wisconsin, on May 8, 1689.\n\nIn 1 763 France turned her authority over to Spain.\n\nOctober 1, 1 800, Spain ceded the tract to France. France\n\ndid not take formal possession until November 30, 1803.\n\nPreviously, on April 30, 1803, the United States had purchased\n\nthis territory from Napoleon in the Louisiana\n\nPurchase. The transfer from France was completed on\n\nDecember 20, 1 803.\n\nIn succeeding years this region was part of Indiana, a\n\npart of the Louisiana territory, part of Missouri territory\n\nand then June 1834, to April 1836, it was a maverick,\n\nassigned to no territory but under jurisdiction of Congress.\n\nFrom 1836 until June 12, 1838, Mower County was a\n\npart of Michigan territory, then a part of Wisconsin\n\nterritory. The territory of Iowa next claimed jurisdiction\n\nuntil December 28, 1846, ;nd was included in the first\n\nproposal of the boundatii':'> ',;.hen Iowa applied for statehood.\n\nAgain, from December 1846, until March 3 , 1849,\n\nMower County was a land without an official proprietor.\n\nThe Minnesota territory was established in March,\n\n1849, and finally on May 1 1 , 1858, Minnesota became a\n\nstate. Mower County now had formal recognition and a\n\npermanent legal status.\n\nIndians Leave Their Hunting Grounds\n\nThe area in Southern Minnesota which included\n\nMower County was familiar ground to all the Sioux\n\nIndians living along the Mississippi River. Their annual\n\nhunting parties visited the region.\n\nMany battles were fought here. The Sacs and the\n\nFoxes were not far away, and the Chippewas occasionally\n\nbraved the wrath of their enemies and came here for\n\ngame.\n\nThe first negotiations with the whites was in 1 824. A\n\ndelegation of Sioux and Chippewas went to Washington\n\nto see the \"Great White Father,\" President James\n\nMonroe.\n\nThe decisive treaties were the Traverse des Sioux, July\n\n22, 185 1 , and the Treaty of Mendota, amended and\n\nsigned by President Fillmore on February 24, 1853.\n\nUnder the Mendota treaty the tribes received\n\n$1 ,410,000, which included funds for the settling of\n\ndebts, educational funds, and funds for opening farms\n\nand for goods and provisions. The balance of $ 1 , 160,000\n\nwas to remain in trust with the United States at 5 %\n\ninterest. This provided for an annuity paid annually for a\n\nSO year period beginning July 1 , 1 852.\n\nThe removal of the Indians in the lower counties began\n\nin 1853. The Indians went up in detachments to one of\n\nthe reserves, usually the Redwood Reserve. Some returned\n\nto their old hunting grounds in southern Minnesota,\n\nonly visiting their reservation at the time of\n\nannuity payments.\n\nEARL Y HISTORY OF MOWER COUNTY\n\nAs far as can be determined the first history of Mower\n\nCounty was published in 1876. It was titled \"Early\n\nHistory Of Mower County. \" This book gives a listing of\n\nmany \"first events\" in the county. One event they missed\n\nwas that of Jacob McQuillan as first settler. However, it\n\ngives a concise picture of these earliest days. Excerpts\n\nfrom this early history follow.\n\nIn the fall of 1852 the first claims in the county were\n\ntaken by some hunters and trappers from Iowa, along\n\nthe Cedar River, near where Austin now stands, but they\n\nleft during the winter.\n\nThe first permanent settlers in the county were Hunter\n\nClark, Austin Nichols, Chauncey Leverich, John Tiff, A .\n\nB . Vaughan, Woodbury, George Squires , Moses Niles\n\nand others in 1853 ; R. B. Foster, L. Ebbin, Mary and\n\nOrlando Wilder, Robert Dobbins, S. P. Bacon, John\n\nRobinson, Lewis Patchin and many others in 1854.\n\nThe first settlements were made on the Cedar, Upper\n\nIowa and Root rivers. In the year 1855 a tide of immigration\n\nset in, and the population of the county began to\n\nassume proportions of some magnitude. The prairies\n\nbecame dotted in every direction with claim shanties .\n\nClaimants often joined in building a home, locating it\n\nwhere the corner of their lands joined. In this manner\n\none building would answer and hold four claims, as the\n\nlaw required that a building be on each.\n\nThe first house built in the county was a log cabin built\n\nby Hunter Clark in the fall of 1853, near the bank of the\n\nCedar River and north of the cemetery.\n\nIn the fall of 1 853 Austin Nichols took a claim and\n\nbuilt a log house on the east bank of the river, near where\n\nEngle Mill once stood. The next year he improved the\n\nwater power and built a saw mill. This he sold with his\n\nclaim to Chauncey Leverich. For a long time Austin was\n\nknown as Leverich's Mill. His was the first house within\n\nthe limits of the city of Austin and the first mill in\n\nthe county.\n\nIn 1854 Robert Dobbins took a claim and built a log\n\nhouse where the brewery now stands, and broke some\n\nland. This was the first land broken in the city of Austin.\n\nThe first deed recorded in the office of Register of\n\nDeeds is from Alexander Nigus to B. J. Brown dated\n\nMarch 14, 1856, conveying 31/2, NP14, Section 21 , Town\n\n102 Range 18: consideration $125.\n\nThe first bill allowed by the County Commissioners\n\nwas to Lewis Patchin for four days services as Commis-\n\n2\n\nsioner on the Rochester and Iowa State line Territorial\n\nroad, amount $ 19.00.\n\nThe first Territorial road laid in the county was from\n\nWinona to Austin, striking the county at Frankfort and\n\nterminating at Austin. This is the road which furnishes a\n\ncrossing over the railroad track south of the depot, and\n\nintersects Bridge St. (2nd Ave. N . E.) at its terminus on\n\nthe west side of the track in the city of Austin. The road\n\nwas laid in 1856.\n\nThe first death in the county was Mary Robinson, aged\n\ntwo years, in 1855. The first marriage was Caleb Stock to\n\nMiss Watkins. The second that of David Aultfather to\n\nMiss Phelps, both in 1 856.\n\nThe first four births in the county were Mary E. Patchin,\n\ndaughter of Lewis Patchin, March 13, 1855; Annette\n\nPowers , daughter of Calvin Powers, Sept. 22, 1 855;\n\nColbert H. Lott, son of Abe Lott, Oct. 10, 1855; Austin\n\nBemis, son of Geo. H. Bemis, Dec. 17, 1855.\n\nThe first school in the county was taught by Miss\n\nMaria Vaughan, in the town of Austin, in 1855.\n\nThe first person murdered was Chauncey Leverich, in\n\n1856. He was attacked by two men, Silvers and Oliver, in\n\nhis own saloon. He ordered them out. They went, and\n\ndared him to come out. Just as he stepped out of the door\n\nSilvers struck him over the head with a steel wagon\n\nspring, from the effects of which he died.\n\nThe first church in the county was built at Frankford.\n\nThe first service preached was by Rev. Mr. Holbrook, of\n\nIowa Conference, M. E. Church, at the house of Samuel\n\nClayton, one mile north of Austin, in the winter of\n\n1854-55.\n\nCedar Valley U Diversity\n\nMay 23, 1 857, the Territorial Legislature passed an act\n\nincorporating the Cedar Valley University, to be established\n\nat Austin. A. B . Vaughan, J. F. Cook, V. P .\n\nLewis, R . L. Kimball and sixteen others were the incorporators.\n\nThis institution has not gotten under way yet.\n\nAlso, the same date, an act to incorporate the LeRoy\n\nAcademy, to be established at LeRoy, in the County of\n\nMower, was passed. The incorporators were N. P. Todd,\n\nWm. Caswell, Wentworth Hayes, S. P. Bacon, W. B .\n\nSpencer and George Peck Jr. What became of this institution,\n\nwhose object was to \"promote the elevation of the\n\nyouth,\" we know not.\n\nEarly Mills\n\nThe first mill was of the primitive kind made and used\n\nby the Indians . It was located on the west side of the\n\nCedar River, about twenty rods above Engle & Co. 's\n\nmill. A white oak stump was hollowed out in the shape of\n\na mortar, and with a wooden pestle the grain was\n\npounded fine. The first steam mill was built by Asa\n\nMarsh and J. Bougard in 1 857.\n\nLoyalty and Patriotism\n\nThe loyalty and patriotism of Mower County has never\n\nfor one moment been doubted. Ever since its first settlement\n\nthe people have not forgotten the noble example of\n\ntheir ancestry, and have never failed to observe the Anniversary\n\nof the National Independence. The first celebration\n\nof our National holiday in this county was held at\n\nAustin, July 4th, 1857. Ormanzo Allen delivered the\n\naddress . From this time until the present, each return of\n\nthe day has been observed in some appropriate manner.\n\nJuly 4th, 1 859, D. B. Johnson Jr. , was the orator of the\n\nday and David Blakely (now ofthe St. Paul Pioneer Press\n\nand Tribune) was the reader. I am told he became so\n\nstrongly enthused with the spirit of 1 776, that he read the\n\nConstitution of the United States instead of the Declaration\n\nof Independence, without discovering his mistake\n\nuntil the next day, when informed by some of his comrades.\n\nWhen the dark clouds of civil war passed over our land\n\nin 1 86 1 , and the first call for troops came, Mower County\n\nvery nobly and cheerfully responded. At that time the\n\ncounty was very sparsely settled by men of moderate incomes,\n\nwho were just commencing to build and secure\n\nthemselves homes in this new country. As evidence of\n\ntheir patriotism it is only necessary to refer to the official\n\nrecords, showing a credit of 401 soldiers to Mower\n\nCounty, which offered a bounty of fifty dollars, afterwards\n\nincreasing it to one hundred dollars, to all volunteers\n\nwho had or should enter the service, also an additional\n\nhundred dollars to all veterans enlisting.\n\nThe noble women of Mower County were true and\n\nloyal. As a token of their love and fidelity to this noble\n\ncause, they presented the first company of volunteers a\n\nbeautiful silk flag, which afterwards waved over many a\n\nhard fought battlefield, from Lookout Mountain,\n\nthrough Georgia to the sea. The remembrance of this\n\n\"dear old flag\" will ever live embalmed in the memories\n\nof the few who yet remain of the first company of volunteers\n\nfrom Mower County, and will be treasured up as a\n\nrelic, to descend to their children who come after them.\n\nIts faded folds, now bullet pierced, are carefully preserved\n\nby Lieutenant George Baird.\n\nMOWER COUNTY NAMED FOR JOHN EDWARD MOWER\n\nJohn E. Mower\n\nThe second Minnesota territorial Governor Willis A .\n\nGorman signed the act organizing Mower County on\n\nMarch 1 , 1 856. At the same time the county was named\n\nin honor of John E. Mower, a member of that territorial\n\nlegislature.\n\nMower was born in New Vineyard, Maine, in 1815. He\n\nwas of English heritage. The family left Maine and\n\nsettled in St. Louis, Missouri. He married Gratia A .\n\nRemick there.\n\nIn 1843 he and his brother, Martin, acquired a large\n\ntract of forest land at St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, establishing\n\nthemselves in the lumber business.\n\nIn 1845 Mower moved to Stillwater, taking his family\n\ndown the river on a raft of lumber, which was to build\n\ntheir home. It was the second frame building in that\n\ntown.\n\nThe Mower brothers built a large house at Arcola in\n\n1847. This house, of Greek architecture, has been accepted\n\nin the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nJohn Mower was elected to the fifth and sixth Territorial\n\nCouncils, and again in 1875, was a member of the\n\nMinnesota State Legislature. He was a Democrat\n\nrunning in a largely Republican territory.\n\nJohn Mower died June 1 1 , 1 879, and is buried in Fairview\n\nCemetery, Stillwater, Minn.\n\nR esearched by Mildred Malone\n\nORIGIN OF THE NAME MOWER\n\nThe following is given in the book of English Surnames\n\nby Mark Anthony Lower.\n\n\"In the life of Hereward the Saxon, who flourished\n\n3\n\nabout 1070, an opponent of William I in England, one of\n\nthe last of his race who withstood the Norman conquests,\n\nare found several names as Laefrick the Mower, from his\n\nhaving overcome 20 with a scythe etc. It would appear\n\nthat the earliest Mower ancestry were of the old Saxon\n\nrace. \"\n\nFrom the book \"Mower Family History \"\n\nby W. L. Mower\n\nORGANIZATION AND BOUNDARY LINES\n\nMower County was included in the original limits of\n\nWabasha County (then spelled Wabashaw) , which was\n\none of nine counties created by the first territorial legislature\n\nin 1849.\n\nGovernor Alexander Ramsey, the first territorial governor,\n\ndivided the Minnesota territory into three judicial\n\ndistricts. Mower County, then unpopulated, was included\n\nin the third judicial district. Court for this district\n\nwas held at Mendota, with Judge David Cooper on the\n\nbench.\n\nWabashaw County comprised practically all of the\n\nsouthern part of Minnesota. Its northern boundary was\n\nthe parallel running through the mouth of the St. Croix\n\nand the mouth of the Yellow Medicine rivers. Its\n\nsouthern boundary was the Iowa line, its eastern the\n\nMississippi and its western the Missouri River.\n\nIn 1851 the territory was divided into 9 counties.\n\nWabashaw County then had a western border just west of\n\nAustin, approximately where the Mower County border\n\nis today. The county to the west was Dakota. This west\n\nborder line was defined as \"a line running from Medicine\n\nBottle's village at Pine Bend, due south to the Iowa line.\"\n\nThe exact line was impossible to verify as Medicine\n\nBottle tepees were differently located at various times,\n\nalways, however, being within a few rods of the bend in\n\nthe river.\n\nRice County was created in 1853 and included the\n\npresent Mower County and also a part of the present\n\nRice County, a portion of Waseca County, most of Freeborn\n\nCounty and Steele County, about a third of Dodge\n\nCounty and small portions of Fillmore and Goodhue\n\nCounties.\n\nFebruary 20, 1856, the legislature created Mower\n\nCounty together with 10 others . March 1 , 1856, Governor\n\nGorman, \"agreeable to the act ofthe legislature, and\n\nupon representations made to him that Mower County\n\nwas sufficiently populated to warrant its being duly furnished\n\nwith county government, organized the county,\n\nand appointed a temporary board of county commissioners,\n\nconsisting of George White, Philip Howell and\n\nWilliam Russel!. \"\n\nThese commissioners met April 7, 1 856, in the village\n\nof Frankford, and presumably located the county seat\n\ntemporarily in that place.

It was the 4th of July,\n\n1852.\n\nJacob McQuillan Sr. was 60 years old . His party included\n\nhis wife, Maria, nine of their younger children, a\n\ngrown son Jacob Jr. and their eldest daughter together\n\nwith her husband, Adam Zadyger.\n\nThe family had been a long time on the trail from their\n\nformer home in Delta, Ohio. The previous night had\n\nbeen spent beside a spring at a site which would later\n\nbecome the town of Spring Valley. There had been one\n\nsettler at that place, a bachelor who lived in a crude\n\ncabin beside the spring.\n\nThe land in Minnesota territory was not yet officially\n\nopen for settlement. The Indians had signed a treaty in\n\n1 85 1 , but the U . S . Congress had not yet approved it. The\n\nofficial survey would be made in 1853.\n\nTraveling westerly through the prairie grass, the\n\nMcQuillans came to a valley with a beautiful spring of\n\ngood water and groves of trees. Mrs. McQuillan made\n\nthe decision, \"We will go no further. \" They were on a\n\nsite just across the line from Fillmore into Mower\n\nCounty. It was in the area of the future village of Hamilton.\n\nBefore he unhitched his oxen, Jacob McQuillan Sr.\n\nnailed their coffee mill to a tree. It was their symbol of\n\n\"squatters rights\" to land, the first claim by a white\n\nsettler in Mower County. When surveyed the homestead\n\nwas at Section 1 , Township 103, Range 14, Racine\n\nTownship .\n\nThe details o f that day were given i n a 1 935 letter from\n\nFranklin P . McQuillan to a nephew in 1 935. He said,\n\n\"We prepared camp for the night, and Father was going\n\nto get some firewood from an oak that seemed to be\n\npartly decayed at the bottom. When he struck it with his\n\naxe a piece came out and it proved to be a bee tree. From\n\nthat time on we had plenty of honey. \"\n\n\"The coffee mill, which was all iron, had a hopper\n\nwhich would hold one large teacup of unground coffee.\n\nLater we had it fastened to the window casing in the\n\nkitchen. When grinding, you had to hold a cup or bowl\n\nunder the mill to catch the coffee. I was only three years\n\nold at that time.\"\n\nThe continuing story of the McQuillan experience in\n\nHamilton is given in \"A Letter To My Daughters, \" the\n\nstory of Lucinda McQuillan Eppard as prepared by May\n\nBenson in 1978. Lucinda was a daughter of Jacob\n\nMcQuillan Sr. , and was 10 years old at the time the\n\nfamily arrived by the spring in Hamilton.\n\n\"The McQuillan clan set to work immediately to build\n\npoplar log shelters on their claim. They then began to\n\nbreak the rich, dark loam , which was 12 to 40 inches\n\ndeep. With their simple implements and oxen the\n\nplowing was not easy.\n\n\" Lucinda's father and brothers hunted the abundant\n\ngame, fowl and elk. She learned the necessary skills of\n\npioneer women: spinning wool, knitting socks and caps,\n\nsewing woolsey-linsey shirts, dressing and curig old\n\ngame, gathering and preserving fruits, nuts and berries.\n\nJacob and Marla McQuillan\n\n5\n\nThe first spring they found maple groves where the\n\nfamily tapped the syrup.\n\n\"The land was surveyed and the McQuillans moved\n\nacross the line into Fillmore County in 1854. Two parcels\n\nof land totaling 600 acres were 'proved up' by Jacob Sr.\n\nand Jacob Jr. in Sumner Township.\n\n\"Unfortunately, two months after the younger\n\nMcQuillan claim was filed, the same land was listed to a\n\nDaniel T. Booth . This later entry provides verification of\n\nthe land dispute between the McQuillans and Booth. At\n\none time friends of each prepared to meet in an armed\n\nconfrontation, until a scout from the McQuillans found\n\nout the Booth forces outnumbered them. \"\n\n\"The continuing land disputes over the years are said\n\nto have ruined both the old man and his son, and in the\n\nend Booth kept possession. \"\n\nWe conclude the McQuillan story with excerpts from a\n\npaper titled \"Local History-Hamilton Village\":\n\n\"McQuillan Sr. , 'Old Pap' as the newcomers called\n\nhim, was a wonderful singer and quite religious in his\n\nway. When the Methodist Church was established he\n\ntook a prominent part in the music.\"\n\n\" During their stay on the farm a great misfortune\n\noccurred. Their youngest daughter, a girl about 14 years\n\nof age, suddenly disappeared. No trace of her was ever\n\nfound. This may seem strange, but local government was\n\npoorly organized. Hunters, adventurers and the Indians\n\nwere on the constant move along Bear Creek. They were\n\nnot hostile to the settlers; only a constant annoyance with\n\ntheir begging and stealing. She may have been stolen by\n\nthe Indians. Her brother, Franklin, later spent considerable\n\ntime going back to Ohio to see if any trace could\n\nbe found, but without any result. \"\n\n\"Old Pap went back t o Ohio on a visit when h e was 75.\n\nWhile he was there he was crushed to death by some\n\nbarrels of syrup. Mrs. McQuillan went to live with her\n\nson in Aitkin, Minn. \"\n\nAfter Jacob McQuillan Jr. lost out in the lawsuit over\n\nhis land, he made application for the position of postmaster.\n\nThe source of mail and supplies was from\n\nDecorah, Iowa. The post office was called Elkhorn,\n\nbecause he had an elk head over the door of his cabin .\n\nLater he sold out to Mr. Corey, who took in travelers . He\n\ncharged 40 cents per night for a room and two meals.\n\nLucinda McQuillan Eppard\n\nDaughter of Jacob and Marla\n\nThe late Ed Plantikow of Austin was a grandson of\n\nLucinda McQuillan Eppard . Two of his children, Margaret\n\nPlantikow Bjork and John Plantikow are Austin\n\ncitizens. They are great-great-grandchildren of Mower\n\nCounty's first settlers, Jacob and Maria McQuillan.\n\nVILLAGE OF HAMILTON, ITS THIEVES AND VIGILANTES\n\nThis village was situated in the southwestern part of\n\nSumner Township, Fillmore County. It lies on the north\n\nbank of the middle branch of Root River. Adjoining the\n\ntown are the \"Hamilton springs\" that continues boiling\n\nup, fresh , clear and sparkling water at the rate of 1 , 500\n\ngallons per minute.\n\nIn location it can truthfully be said the village of Hamilton\n\nwas a success, and the non-arrival of the hoped for\n\nrailroad alone blasted its prospects.\n\nThe first house erected was put up in 1 853 by Adam\n\nZadygar. In 1855 Daniel Booth, from the New England\n\nstates, arrived and had the village of Hamilton platted\n\nand recorded.\n\nImmediate steps were taken to secure a post office,\n\nand in 1856 an office was established under the name of\n\n\"Elkhorn. \" Jacob McQuillan Jr. was appointed to\n\nhandle the mail.\n\nHamilton, in the year 1856, was metropolitan as far as\n\na gang of organized thieves were concerned. They were\n\nbound together by an oath that they would support,\n\nstand by, and defend each other. They would steal anything\n\nthat could be carried off but made horses a\n\nspecialty.\n\nThe gang was made up almost entirely of home talent.\n\nIt was with the utmost difficulty that the honest members\n\nof the community ridded themselves of the pests . They\n\norganized what was termed a \"vigilance committee. \"\n\nUpon one occasion this last mentioned association\n\nturned out, and after collecting the population of the\n\nvillage together, made the announcement that, as they\n\nhad received sufficient evidence, they were now prepared\n\nto \"lynch\" those who had committed the depredations.\n\nAt this, one hundred shooting irons were brought into\n\nview. Imagine their surprise when a number of the most\n\ninfluential citizens broke from among the crowd and\n\nmade for the woods as fast as boots and hair standing on\n\nend would take them.\n\nThis matter involved not only Hamilton and the town\n\nof Sumner, but also this entire portion of the county.\n\nFillmore County History\n\nTHE DRAGOONS CAME FIRST\n\nEven before Austin Nichols there were expeditions\n\nrecorded into and thru the Austin area. The first was in\n\n1835 when a detachment of United States Dragoons\n\nmarched from Fort Des Moines through Mower County\n\nand on to Wabashaw's village. These were U . S . soldiers\n\nassigned to guard the frontier. On their return trip they\n\ncamped on the banks of the Cedar River, near the\n\npresent site of Austin.\n\nIn the winter of 1836-37 a group of military from Fort\n\nSnelling were on a hunting expedition. They camped in\n\nthe area which was years later known as Horace Austin\n\nState Park. This was a 55 acre tract located across the\n\nriver and west of Hormels, at the south end of Main St.\n\nThe hunting party from Fort Snelling included Dr.\n\nJohn Emerson, the post surgeon. His negro slave was\n\nDred Scott. It is interesting to note that 20 years later, a\n\nSupreme Court decision regarding Scott's status as a\n\nslave was one of the factors leading to the United States\n\nCivil War.\n\nFebruary. 1912-A ustin Daily Herald-Freeborn County\n\nhas a miserable case before it.

Their\n\nobjective was to get skins for the American Fur Co. The\n\nIndians built a stockade, the first structure to be erected\n\nin Mower County. Their hunt was successful. At the\n\nseason's end they had more than 2,000 deer, 50 elk, 50\n\nbear, five panthers and some buffalo hides.\n\nIn addition to Austin Nichols, another white settler\n\ncame to this area in 1853. \"Hunter\" Clark staked a claim\n\nand built a log house on a piece of land which is within\n\nthe present boundaries of Oakwood Cemetery. William\n\nBaudler arrived before Austin was platted, and he lived\n\nin the cabin with Clark. Later Baudler acquired the farm\n\nsouth of the cemetery.

It's generally the lawless\n\nelement that adopts the lawless method of visiting\n\npunishment upon offenders.\n\nNOW AND THEN A PANTHER\n\nStep back in time 131 years so that you can have a different\n\nlook at this land which we now call Austin. The\n\nfollowing is the story of a 14-year-old boy who hunted on\n\nthis site in 1 853. His name was S. D. Mead.\n\n\"The first white man to come to Austin was Austin\n\nNichols, who came as a hunter in 1 852. He built a cabin\n\nnear the mouth of the Dobbin creek and hunted until\n\ncold weather came on. He then returned to his home in\n\nClayton County, Iowa. \"\n\n\"In the fall of 1853 he came back, and I came with\n\nhim. I was then 14 years old. \"\n\n\"That winter w e took nine buffalo skins and many\n\ndeer, mink, otter and beaver. What I killed, Nichols gave\n\nto me. When I reached home I sold them for $190 in\n\ngold. \"\n\n\" I got one elk near where the C . M . & St. Paul depot\n\nnow stands. It measured nine feet from tip to tip.\"\n\n\"I have never again hunted in a place where game was\n\nso plentiful, and where such a great variety was to be\n\nfound. At that time we could go out and kill a deer in an\n\nhour any time of the morning or evening. Prairie\n\nchickens were plentiful. Geese and ducks could be found\n\nany place in the river. Now and then a panther was to be\n\nfound. Prairie wolves were everywhere . \"\n\nIn 1 855 Mead and his father moved t o Austin with\n\nfour other families, Robert Autis, Lynn Gifford, Wilson\n\nKing and Widow Lockwood. His story continues .\n\n\"0. W . Shaw's residence stands o n the east side o f the\n\nfirst 20 acres of land ever broken in Austin. \"\n\n\" A little south of where the packing house now stands\n\nthere was a maple sugar camp where Indians made\n\nsugar. The Sioux Indians had their village on the bank in\n\nfront of the O . W. Shaw residence, a little to the south. \"\n\n(In 1 984 that would be approximately where children\n\nslide on sleds in winter, near the lagoon. )\n\nI n the winter o f 1 855 and '56 there were 200 Sioux who\n\nwintered in the bottom lands back of the Gibson Hotel.\n\nThere was heavy timber there then. The whites and\n\nIndians were always friendly. \"\n\nThere was a Mr. Solner who ventured into this land\n\nabout the same time. His description follows.\n\n\"The Indians were here in large numbers. A camp of\n\nthe Winnebagos was not far from Six Mile Grove, while\n\nthe Sioux were near Deer Creek. As each camp numbered\n\nfour or five hundred Indians, it looked as if there\n\nmight be trouble. Afterwards we learned that this was\n\nneutral ground.\"\n\n\"We saw one buffalo in the section known as the Towhead,\n\nand a herd of two or three hundred elk and deer. \"\n\nThe above narratives were taken from a column of\n\n\"Reminiscences\" which ran in the Austin Daily Herald\n\nin a half dozen chapters during 1908.\n\nSETTLERS LOSE PERSONAL PROPERTY IN 1854 FLOOD\n\nIn 1 854 a few settlers came from Wisconsin. John\n\nRobinson settled at High Forest; A. B . Vaughan at\n\nLansing; and a Norwegian, whose name is not remembered,\n\nat Brownsdale.\n\nJohn Robinson had built a cabin. Into this building,\n\nnot larger than 12 x 14 feet, four families moved and\n\nlived with him until they could build houses for themselves.\n\nThus far, everything had moved along without accident\n\nor incident worthy of note. In July of this year there\n\nwas a heavy rainstorm. Root River, swollen by the rain,\n\noverflowed its banks and deluged the surrounding\n\ncountry. It came about three o'clock in the morning, so\n\nsuddenly that the settlers had barely time to save their\n\nlives. They did so by wading through the water, in many\n\nplaces up to their waists, and carrying their children to\n\ndry land.\n\nThey lost nearly all their household goods, which at\n\nthat time, were almost impossible to replace. At the end\n\nof a few days the settlers, who had been living in a cellar,\n\nreturned to their desolated cabins.\n\nAs an evidence of the suddenness of the storm, it may\n\nbe in taste to remark that C. F. Johnson, afterwards\n\nproprietor of the Johnson House, did not have time to\n\nsecure his pantaloons. They were borne away by the\n\nturbulent flood, the only pair he possessed at the time.\n\nIllustrated Historical A tlas.\n\nState of Minnesota. 1874\n\nIMMIGRANTS INCREASE IN 1855\n\nIn 1855 the popUlation of Mower County began to\n\nassume proportions of magnitude. During this year the\n\nimmigrants poured in so rapidly from other states that by\n\nthe beginning of the next year the county contained\n\nabout 500 inhabitants . At the end of 1956 there were\n\n600.\n\n7\n\nWith this great influx of settlers, towns became necessary.\n\nAustin, High Forest, Frankford, LeRoy, Hamilton\n\nand Brownsdale sprang into existence in rapid succession.\n\nMany of the lots were sold before the towns were\n\nplatted, thus laying the vendors liable to a fine of $25.00.\n\nTHE CITY ON A HANDSOME PLAIN\n\n\"Austin is on a handsome plain, gradually rising from\n\nthe Cedar River. In the center it is quite elevated, affording\n\nfine views and excellent drainage. Numerous fine\n\ngroves checker the near and distant landscape, but\n\ntimber for fuel is not plentiful.\"\n\nThe quotation above comes from a paper bound\n\n\"Early History of Mower County, Minnesota,\" by R.

The paragraphs which follow\n\nhave been taken from Paden's history.\n\n\"The original claim on which the city of Austin is\n\nlocated belonged to Austin Nichols, after which the town\n\nis named. He took the claim in 1853, and in 1854 sold it\n\nto Chauncey Leverich, who entered the land September\n\n14th, 1855.\"\n\n\"At the time these plats were recorded there were\n\nthirteen houses in Austin. The location of the county seat\n\nat this place gave it a decided advantage over other towns\n\nin the county, and since that time it has had a steady\n\ngrowth . The population at the present time is 3,000.\"\n\n\"The city is well supplied with hotels, there being at\n\nleast five others besides the one at the depot.\"\n\n\"The Cedar River furnishes good water power within\n\nthe city limits, on which the first mill of a primitive kind,\n\nwas made and used by the Indians. It was located on the\n\nwest side of the Cedar about twenty rods above Engle &\n\nCo. 's mill. A white oak stump was hollowed out in the\n\nshape of a mortar, and with a wooden pestle the grain\n\nwas pounded fine.\"\n\n\" In November, 1858, they started up a water mill for\n\ngrinding corn, and attempted to grind wheat but made\n\nrather poor flour. The first wheat ground was for Mr.\n\nRose, of Rose Creek. At that time there was no other mill\n\nnearer than thirty miles. \"\n\n\" A . B . Vaughan built the first store in June, 1855, and\n\nwas the first merchant. Yates & Lewis were the second\n\nmerchants. The first building erected for a hotel was in\n\n1855, built by C. Leverich on the present site of the\n\nGrand Central Hotel. In 1856 the hotel was purchased by\n\nSolomon Snow and Geo. E. Wilbour. It was afterwards\n\nknown as the \"Snow House. \"\n\n\"The first public school was in the winter of 1855-56,\n\nin a log house on Water Street (4th Ave.), taught by a\n\nMr. Sweton. The first sermon was preached in the old\n\nLeverich house, October 26, 1 856, by the Rev. Stephen\n\nCook.\n\nCHAUNCEY'S PLACE\n\nThe Queen City Flour MIlls was an original location of Chauncey\n\nLeverich's sawmUl, 70S 4th Ave. N.E., Austin\n\nAustin Nich9ls sold his land claim to Chauncey Leverich\n\nin 1 854. For a year or two the emerging settlement\n\nwas known as Chauncey's Place or the Leverich Mill.\n\nChauncey Leverich was the founder of Austin. He was\n\na young man, under 30 years of age, tall and powerfully\n\nbuilt. He came from Vinton, Iowa, with his young wife,\n\nHannah.\n\nWith a sharp eye to business, he pre-empted 160 acres\n\nupon which he selected a site for a sawmill. By early 1855\n\nhe had completed the mill at a place which would now be\n\n8\n\nat 70S-4th Ave. N . E. The vacant site adjoins the dam\n\non the Cedar River. This land was later to become the\n\nlocation of the Campbell Flour Mill. The Hormel Co.\n\nalso owned the property at a later date. In the 1960s\n\nClifford Greenman operated his heating and refrigeration\n\nbusiness there. Now the site of Chauncey Leverich's\n\nmill is owned by HUD.\n\nAustin was laid out in the fall of 1855 by Leverich ,\n\nA. B . Vaughan and G. W. Mason. They also platted it\n\nthe next spring, but did not immediately take the plat to\n\nbe recorded\n\nA Race To the County Seat\n\nIn 18561. B . Yates solicited the help of County Supervisor\n\nM. K. Armstrong in a secretive plan. Armstrong\n\ntold this story in his personal history of Mower County. It\n\nwas retold in the 1956 Centennial edition of the Austin\n\nDaily Herald.\n\n\"Mr. Yates called on me at High Forest, on the 14th of\n\nApril and wished me to proceed with him speedily and\n\nsecretly the next day to Austin. By arriving in the night\n\nhe could lay out his property to enable him to get his plat\n\non record first, as the only village of Austin. \"\n\n\"We started next morning o n horseback. The distance\n\nwas 30 miles, untraveled and uninhabited. The rain had\n\nbeen falling almost incessantly for the last week, and it\n\ncontinued to storm heavily throughout the day. We\n\nreached the Cedar River at nightfall, as wet and hungry\n\nas wolves. \"\n\n\" Here we stopped and I packed my papers and instruments\n\nin my carpet bag to prevent them from being seen\n\nand to give the appearance of a traveler. Yates secreted\n\nthe tripod in an old hollow tree to avoid carrying it into\n\ntown. We swam the river and went into the village.\"\n\n\"That night I examined the ground in order to make a\n\nplat for them to take and record in case of emergency.\n\nYates recrossed the bridge and brought the tripod into\n\ntown unseen. \"\n\n\"The next morning, when w e were seen staking out\n\nlots nearly half a mile from the town, the old proprietors\n\n'Smelt a rat.' Vaughan and Mason started on foot, with\n\ntheir plat for the county seat of Frankford. They had\n\nbeen gone two hours before Yates and Lewis saw the mischief,\n\nwhereupon they immediately started on horseback\n\nwith their plat.\"\n\n\"Yates and Lewis arrived at Frankford 20 minutes in\n\nadvance of their fellow racers. Judge Felch was sent for\n\nthree miles distant, to come and take acknowledgement\n\nof the plats. When he got in town, Vaughan and Mason\n\nhad arrived. They slipped their plat into his hands first.\n\nHe, however, considered himself employed by the other\n\nparty first, and accordingly did so.\"\n\nHence the Yates and Lewis map was filed for record as\n\nAustin First, at 7 o'clock p.m. The other as Austin\n\nSecond at 7 o'clock and 30 minutes.\n\nTragedy Stril{es\n\nChauncey Leverich had erected the first frame\n\ndwelling in Austin. The dwelling was also used commercially.\n\nThere is a question whether it was the hotel,\n\nsaloon, grocery store or a combination of the three. The\n\nlocation is known. The building was on the southeast\n\ncorner of the intersection of 2nd Ave. N.E. and 1st St.\n\nN .E. This was formerly the corner of East Bridge St. and\n\nChatham Sts . Most recently the Austin Hotel was on the\n\nsite.\n\nIt is ironic that the man who initiated Austin was also\n\nthe victim of the county's first murder. There are three\n\nversions of how this happened. We will give the one most\n\nfrequently told.\n\nAccording to M. K. Armstrong, Leverich had just\n\nopened a saloon and was entertaining friends. Two\n\ntownsmen, Horace Silv.er and William Oliver, too boisterous. Leverich put them outside, whereupon\n\nthey began pounding the side of the building. As Leverich\n\nstepped outside, one of the men struck him in the\n\nforehead with a heavy object and he fell to the ground,\n\nhis skull fractured. This happened in August, 1856.\n\nLeverich lived for a few days. Silver and Oliver had\n\ntime to plead guilty to assault and battery. They were\n\nfined $20 and $10 respectively. They then left town\n\nbefore Leverich died. They escaped the murder charge.\n\nLeverich was buried on the south side of his building.\n\nLater his body was moved to Oakwood Cemetery. The\n\nplace he was buried was unmarked. In the Centennial\n\nyear, 1 956, a trace of records located the site. A marble\n\nslab was placed with the following inscription,\n\n\"Chauncey Leverich.\" \" Here I Will Pitch My TentHere\n\nI Will Found A City.\" Another plate reads,\n\n\"Austin, Minnesota Centennial, July 4, 1 956.\" Just\n\nbelow this inscription, in smaller lettering, \"Open Time\n\nCapsule In March, 2056.\"\n\nChauncey Leverich's tumultuous two year career in\n\nAustin had a positive impact.

A rustic trail came into the\n\ntown from the east and then swerved north through the\n\ncenter ofthe little village of Austin, Mower County, Minnesota.\n\nJim Ackley was hacking down the weeds and\n\n9\n\nbrush on the trail which the villagers called Main Street.\n\nL. N. Griffith, the new postmaster, was urging Ackley to\n\nhurry. The stage coach was due.\n\nGriffith's little frame post office had just been completed.\n\nJonas Haney was busy installing boxes for individuals.\n\nA newly posted sign announced that the box\n\nrental would be ten cents for three months . Complaints\n\nhad been heard about the high cost. Cash money was not\n\neasy to come by in 1857.\n\nFinally there was the sound of wheels and hooves as\n\nthe stagecoach came down the Territorial road. (2nd\n\nAve. N . E . , formerly East Bridge St.) The stage driver,\n\nN. M. Wilder, carried the mail pouch into the post\n\noffice. Griffith unlocked the pouch, took out the Austin\n\nmail, stuffed in the outgoing mail and relocked the\n\npouch. It was ready for Wilder when he would pull out\n\ntoward the north. (The old Territorial road went on 1 st\n\nDrive N . W . , previously called Lansing Ave.)\n\nMeanwhile the stage coach passengers had a story to\n\ntell. Early that morning the trail had passed through a\n\nswampy area. Unable to get through with his burden of\n\npassengers, Wilder had requested the tired travelers to\n\nwalk. After a one mile hike they had been able to climb\n\nback aboard.\n\nWas this the Snow House?\n\nIt was an early Austin hotel\n\n(Ven! Judd Photo Collectioll)\n\nThe dusty and travel worn stage riders headed for\n\nAustin's one hotel. The Snow House was operated by\n\nSolomon Snow and George Wilbour, who claimed that it\n\nwas a \"first class hotel. \"\n\nFour lodging rooms held the normal register of guests.\n\nWhen pressed by an increase in guests the \" school section\"\n\nwas opened. This would accommodate a number\n\nwilling to occupy the eleven beds with hay filled mattresses.\n\nA total of forty could be taken care of in the Snow\n\nHouse.\n\nThe breakfast bill of fare was pork, biscuits and dried\n\napplesauce. For dinner there was fried pork, biscuits and\n\napplesauce and supper was more of the same. Occasionally\n\nthey had beef, which qualified their \"first class\"\n\nstatus.\n\nWaiting For the Wagon\n\nThe people of Austin were awaiting another arrival on\n\nthat July day. Aloysius_ Brown, the storekeeper, was\n\nexpected back soon. Two days before he had left for the\n\nmill at Chatfield to renew his supply of cornmeal and\n\nflour. Supplies in the village were running low. It was\n\n10\n\n(Vern Judd Photo Collection)\n\nThese Austin CItizens may have been waiting for a supply wagon\n\npast midday when Brown's ox drawn wagon moved into\n\nsight.\n\nBrown was assured of payment for the supplies he\n\nwould bring back. On deposit in the store were a number\n\nof sacks. Each sack had the name of a resident, the\n\namount of meal or flour needed and gold coins to cover\n\npayment. Sometimes the requests exceeded the supply\n\nreceived. Then Brown would distribute as judiciously as\n\npossible.\n\nBrown was respected as an honest man by his customers.\n\nThe first services ofthe Catholic Church were held in\n\nhis home.\n\nThere was a regular supply of beef for the little town.\n\nW. A. Woodson took care ofthis need from his farm two\n\nmiles out of Austin. He brought in dressed beef and\n\ndrove from house to house to make his sales. Steak was\n\nselling for 25ft per lb .\n\n(Ven! Judd Photo Collectioll)\n\nHeadquarters building Is on left above\n\nAustin citizens took a special pride in a new two-story\n\nframe building. Located about 50 yards south of Brown's\n\nstore, this unpainted structure had an important status\n\nin the community. It was called \" Headquarters. \" Most\n\nof the social and official functions of the village took\n\nplace here.\n\nThe town's first concert was to be held at Headquarters\n\nthe next Sunday. Lyman Sherwood and his brother\n\nwere to sing, accompanied by John Hallot. Already the\n\nCongregational and Methodist churches were holding\n\nSunday meetings at the new building. The Baptists were\n\nalso making plans to meet there.\n\nThere was a rumor that a man named Blakely wanted\n\nto have space at Headquarters to start a newspaper. The\n\nlower floor of the new building was not yet in use, but\n\nGeorge Hayes was considering establishing a mercantile\n\nbusiness there.\n\nAustin Grew Rapidly\n\nAfter just two years Austin had over 100 citizens. Two\n\ndoctors had come in 1856. Dr. Olenzer Allen was the\n\nfirst and was also the first druggist. Dr. J. N . Wheat\n\ncame shortly thereafter. Life for a pioneer doctor required\n\na rugged routine in keeping with the lifestyle of\n\nthese early day Mower County inhabitants.\n\nAt dusk of this summer's day we look back down the\n\nstreets of the little town. Mrs. Sarah Bemis is closing her\n\nmillinery shop, as is George Mitchell at his new furniture\n\nstore. A clanging can still be heard at Winfield Loveland's\n\nblacksmith shop.\n\nThe kerosene lamps are lit. Thanks to Aloysious\n\nBrown there will be fresh bread on the tables of Austin\n\nvillage tonight.\n\n(Names and many pertinent details were takenfrom\n\nthe Mower County Histories of 1 884 and 1 9 1 1 .\n\nE. N. J. )\n\nDOCTOR RECALLS WINTER OF 1856\n\nThe romance of pioneer life is probably often overstated.\n\nThe following account, given by one of Austin's\n\nfirst doctors gives a realistic picture of early pioneer life.\n\nThe doctor's reminiscence was given at a Centennial\n\nevent held on Washington's birthday, Feb. 22, 1 876.\n\n\" Dr. J . N . Wheat responded by telling a little of his\n\nown experience in the winter of 1 856. The snow was four\n\nfeet deep on the level and drifted badly in places. The\n\nsnow was so crusted that a man could walk upon it\n\nwithout difficulty, only breaking through occasionally.\n\n\" He was called professionally to attend a patient in the\n\nVanderwalker neighborhood, a settlement some 4 or 5\n\nmiles northwest of Austin. Here he found 23 persons:\n\nmen, women and children, inhabiting one log house,\n\n14 x 16 feet, without floor or windows, unless the two\n\nsmall lights of glass framed in the logs might be called\n\nsuch. With stools for chairs and a box-like manger filled\n\nwith dried prairie grass for bed, and without bread or\n\nvegetables for food.\n\n\" Here were three persons dangerously sick. In order to\n\ngive them proper attention he found it necessary to make\n\nthe journey every other day on foot, often breaking\n\nthrough the snow crust and sinking to the body. He was\n\nin great discouragement.\n\n\"Sometimes, though starting from home early in the\n\nmorning, he would not reach his destination until near\n\nnoon. Then he would dine with the family on slapjacks\n\nand molasses, the doctor being company and expected to\n\npartake.\n\n\" It is but justice to the doctor's perseverance, if not to\n\nhis skill, to say that the patients recovered. The inmates\n\nof the log house swarmed the next spring as soon as the\n\nsnow melted and houses could be built. They found\n\nhomes in about the same neighborhood.\"\n\nSHOWDOWN AT PATCHEN'S INN\n\nForty mounted men rode into Frankford on a Monday\n\nafternoon in mid-January, 1857. Though tired frQm two\n\ndays of travel, they were grim faced and determined.\n\nArmed with an assortment of revolvers, knives and rifles,\n\nthey rode past the cemetery, a log schoolhouse and up to\n\nthe log structure which was Lewis Patchen's hotel.\n\nFacing them were an equally grim group of armed\n\ncitizens of Frankford. The forty from Austin had arrived\n\nto attempt the rescue oftheir sheriff, and a homesteader,\n\nnamed Bemis.\n\nHow had this confrontation of settlers in Mower\n\nCounty developed? Ever since, and even before the\n\norganization of the county, there had been a division of\n\ntwo county factions. On the east was Frankford. Thirty\n\nmiles to \" -,e west was the Austin area, the other population\n\ncenter. The struggle for political control of the\n\ncounty had stirred the wrath of the two sides. The immediate\n\nbone of contention now was the location of the\n\ncounty seat.\n\nThe following paragraphs tell the events leading up to\n\nthe showdown.\n\n1 1\n\nGeographic Division Caused Political Split\n\nMower County, in the territory of Minnesota, was very\n\nyoung in January, 1857. Just four and a half years earlier\n\nthe first county settler, Jacob McQuillan, had established\n\na land claim by nailing a coffee mill to an oak tree\n\na half dozen miles north of Frankford. In 1854, Lewis\n\nPatchen had been the first settler in Frankford.\n\nIn the west of Mower County a frontiersman named\n\nAustin Nichols had established a claim in late 1 853 or\n\nearly 1 854. Later in 1 854 this claim was purchased by\n\nChauncey Leverich. Austin was laid out in 1 855 but was\n\nnot platted until the spring of 1856.\n\nDuring the years of 1 855 and 1856 settlers were rapidly\n\nestablishing their claims in the Frankford area and the\n\nAustin area. Between the two were miles of prairie.\n\nThe geographic division became a political split in\n\n1855 at the time of the first Minnesota legislative election.\n\nThe candidate for the Republicans was A. B .\n\nVaughan, the first Austin storekeeper and postmaster.\n\nHis opponent was W. B. Covell, a Democrat and Frankford's\n\nfirst lawyer.\n\nFirst Legislator-Vaughan Won Polls, Covell Won\n\nCertification\n\nIn October, 1 855, the polls for the Mower County\n\nlegislature were located in High Forest. A board with its\n\nends on two barrel heads was placed, under an oak tree.\n\nThis was the judge's desk. Ninety-seven votes were polled\n\nand Vaughan received a majority. However, Covell\n\nquickly went to Houston, received a certificate of election,\n\nand reported in at the legislature. Vaughan reported\n\nin too late. Covell was qualified as the first legislator\n\nfrom Mower County. These events may well have\n\nbeen the first major reason for the dispute between the\n\neast side and the west side of Mower County. All of the\n\npolitical assignments went to the east side. Frankford\n\nwas designated as the county seat. No doubt this was a\n\nnew irritant to the people around Austin.\n\nWest Side Won 1856 Election\n\nOn October 14, 1856, the west side of Mower County\n\nproved their numerical superiority. The Peoples Party\n\nrepresented the west side and the Union Party chose candidates\n\nfrom the east side. Out of 374 votes cast the\n\nPeoples Party had a majority of forty-six votes. Only the\n\nposition of surveyor went to the east side.\n\nThere is little doubt that at this time the west side\n\nrejoiced in their newfound political strength. The new\n\ncommissioners were George Bemis, the Austin homesteader;\n\nWilliam Spencer, LeRoy and Horace B.\n\nBlodgett. There was pressure on the commissioners to\n\nmove the county seat. They were aware that this could\n\nnot be done legally without a countywide election.\n\nBlodgett found a technicality to circumvent the law. His\n\nresolution said in effect that the April 7, 1856, county\n\nboard proceedings had not properly recorded their action\n\nto situate the county seat in Frankford. He, therefore,\n\nproposed that the county seat should be located in\n\nAustin until otherwise provided by law. Bemis and Blodgett\n\nvoted for this resolution and Spencer was opposed.\n\nThis action was taken on Monday, January 7, 1857.\n\nThe Plot Thickens\n\nThe removal of records is based on an old letter written\n\nby Mrs. Charles Lamb, Frankford. \" Not in the still of\n\nthe night, but at noonday when the officers were taking\n\ntheir dinner and smoking their pipes in quietude, they\n\ncame, stealing noiselessly into their vacant rooms and\n\nsilently marched away with what comprised our county\n\nseat. \"\n\nThe action which followed reads like the plot for an\n\nearly day silent movie. Jesse Yates, A. B. Vaughan and\n\nGeorge Bemis were the villains. All were newly elected\n\nofficials. Yates was yet to be sworn in as sheriff and\n\nVaughan was to be probate judge. Bemis had already\n\nacted in the capacity of chairman of the county board.\n\nThese were the three who took the little tin box and the\n\nbook of county board proceedings. They climbed in a\n\nsleigh and headed for Austin. That night they stayed at\n\nthe Tattersoll House, in High Forest. Bemis kept the\n\nrecord book under his coat and Yates gave the little tin\n\nbox to the landlord, Mr. Tattersoll, for safekeeping.\n\nThe history book record of the chase reads as follows:\n\n12\n\nTin Box Was Elusive\n\n\"In a short time Sheriff Sherman arrived with a posse\n\nfrom Frankford. Yates, Vaughan, Bemis and the landlord,\n\nTattersoll, were arrested for grand larceny. He then\n\nposted guards around the hotel and went to obtain a\n\nsearch warrant, as the landlord would not give up the tin\n\nbox. \"\n\n\"While the sheriff was gone, Yates made a bargain\n\nwith a W. Sykes to remove the tin box from the hotel.\n\nThe reward to Sykes was to be $20, with $5 down.\n\n\"The evening was cold and Yates soon induced the\n\nguards to come in to take a drink, and they became quite\n\nconvivial, and supposed as long as they watched the\n\npersons under arrest, that their duty would be performed.\"\n\nTo make a long story short, Yates soon walked out of\n\nthe hotel, eluded the guards who followed, and got the\n\ntin box from Sykes. After hiding the box outside, he gave\n\na diagram of the location to John Patterson and C. C.\n\nHatchett. The tin box was carried back to Austin and\n\nhidden in the R. L. Kimball hardware store. Frankford\n\nofficers arrived in Austin with a search warrant, but the\n\ntin box was secure in the basement under a few bushels\n\nof potatoes.\n\nThe next morning Yates and Bemis evaded detection\n\nlong enough to hide the county's record book in the snow.\n\nThe spot was marked \"by a certain process more effectual\n\nthan elegant. \" The book remained there a short\n\ntime and was taken back to Frankford and carried by\n\nMr. Bemis during the time of his arrest, closely guarded\n\nbeneath his coat and vest.\n\nArrest of Yates and Bemis Angers Austin\n\nIt was not until the following Saturday that the Austin\n\ncitizens heard of the arrest of Yates and Bemis. It was\n\nthen that the forty armed men lit out for Frankford,\n\narriving on Monday, January 14. People from the east\n\nside rushed into Frankford prepared for war. For a long\n\ntime a collision was feared and a guard was placed over\n\nthe prisoners at night.\n\nAt one point during the legal proceedings an offer was\n\nmade by the west side to return the tin box and record\n\nbook if Yates and Bemis would be released. The east side\n\nrefused.\n\nPeace Prevails\n\nYates and Bemis were bound over to appear at the\n\nnext term of the Fillmore County Court. They were\n\nreleased on the payment of a $3,000 bond.\n\nThe location of the county seat at Austin was decided\n\nby a vote of the people on June 1 , 1857. Yates and Bemis\n\nmade their appearance at the next session of the Fillmore\n\nCounty Court, where the case was dismissed.\n\nIn that June election the citizens of Frankford voted\n\nfor Brownsdale as county seat in one final attempt to displace\n\nAustin.\n\nWas the loss of the county seat eventually responsible\n\nfor Frankford becoming a ghost town? All we know is\n\nwhat is recorded. By 1870 Austin had a population of\n\n2,040. Frankford's population increased to a maximum\n\nof about 300.\n\nIn September, 1867, the first railroad engine to\n\noperate in Mower County reached Austin from\n\nOwatonna. Shortly the two were connected.\n\nThe coming of the railroad had a great impact on the\n\nsmall towns of Mower County. Many of those towns\n\nwhich had railroad connections grew. Some of the towns\n\nwithout the railroad declined . Rail lines never came to\n\nFrankford. The final question remains. If Frankford had\n\ncontinued as a county seat, would its population have\n\nincreased to a level which would have insured a rail line?\n\nThere is no answer.\n\n9TH REGIMENT VOLUNTEERS ENTERTAINED\n\nThose of the Mower County volunteers who are in the\n\n9th Regiment have been spending a few days with their\n\nfriends before going South. They left yesterday for\n\nWinona where they will take the boats for Dixie.\n\nOn Saturday a sumptuous supper was gotten up for\n\nthem at the Lacy House, which was furnished them free\n\nof charge by the citizens of this part of the county. After\n\nthe supper the boys repaired to the new building of Mr.\n\nLewis' and there tripped the fantastic toe until near\n\nSunday morning.\n\nJust before leaving a barrel of apples was rolled out to\n\nthem and they departed in good spirits, all well satisfied\n\nwith the treatment they had received from the good citizens\n\nof Austin and vicinity.\n\nMinnesota Courier.

They are scattered all through the\n\nwoods, and dead horses lay thick around them.\n\n\"Our battery was taken and retaken two or three\n\ntimes. They charged upon our battery, coming on the\n\nrun and yelling at the top of their voices. The Fifth North\n\nCarolina Regiment was at the head.\n\n\"The Fifth Wisconsin Regiment was deployed as skirmishers\n\nin front. When the Fifth fell back on the reserve,\n\nthey thought they had us certain. But we came up in line\n\nand poured into them when only 10 rods from us.

Davison Photo CollectiorZ>\n\nAustin's Main Street rebullt after 1869 fire\n\nlst National Bank on right across Courthouse Square\n\nIt was the night that Main Street burned. A northwest\n\nwind had brought subzero temperatures, and most of\n\nAustin's citizens were asleep. At 1 1 :00 P.M. one person\n\ncame down Main Street, glanced in the window of Case\n\nand Shepley's Store, saw flames and raised the cry of\n\n\"fire . \" From house to house the call was relayed, and\n\nmen, women and the older children rushed out to battle\n\nthe flames.\n\nMost of the people carried buckets and a few had tubs.\n\nA line was formed and the bucket brigade went into\n\naction. The water came from partially filled basements of\n\nbusiness buildings. Seepage of water into these cellars\n\nhad formed natural cisterns.\n\nIt was soon apparent that the fire in the Case and\n\nShepley Store was out of hand. The strong wind was\n\nsteadily increasing the danger to all of Austin. One band\n\nof workers tore down the building belonging to J. F.\n\nAtherton, and this prevented the spread of flames in a\n\nwesterly direction.\n\nThe fire swept into the brick building on the corner of\n\nMain and Bridge Streets, which had just been purchased\n\nfor the First National Bank. The danger to East Bridge\n\nStreet (2nd Avenue N . E.) increased. To save buildings\n\non the street it was necessary to tear down the frame\n\nbuilding which was occupied by Friedrich and Sammans\n\nMeat Market.\n\nThe heat on the west side of Main Street was so intense\n\nthat it scorched the fronts of buildings from J. Levy's\n\nStore to Headquarters. G. Schleuder and Woodward &\n\nDorr began to move goods from their buildings, but the\n\ndanger passed and the west side of Main Street sustained\n\nno further damage.\n\nFinally the disastrous fire of March 3, 1869 was\n\nbrought under control. Years later, Tom Dugan, the\n\nchief of the volunteers , said, \"Everything was destroyed\n\nin the path of the fire except Bill Simpson's Saloon, and I\n\ndon't suppose we should have saved that.\" C. N . Beiseeker\n\nadded, \"The water froze in the tubs as we emptied\n\nthe buckets. \"\n\nI n the wake of the fire the town surveyed its damage.\n\nThree two-story brick buildings and two frame buildings\n\nwere destroyed. The $50,000 loss was only partly insured.\n\nInjuries were relatively minor. George Bishop had one of\n\nhis hands frozen. Alex Fleck had one of his toes frostbitten\n\nand Major Van Valkenburgh jammed one of his\n\nbig toes in his hurry to help somebody move a heavy box.\n\nF ACTS ABOUT AUSTIN AND VICINITY\n\n1870\n\n( Vern Judd Photo Collection)\n\nAustin school building bullt In 1865\n\nThis was the first permanent school, later sold to the Methodist\n\nChurch\n\n15\n\n(Harold 1.

Mostly of American descent with a sprinkling of\n\nan excellent class of Norwegians and Germans. There are\n\nsix churches in town,and eight church organizations.\n\nThe Baptists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Episcopals,\n\nLutherans and Catholics each have quite good\n\nchurch edifices in which to worship.

About one-fifth of this acreage was timber and\n\noak openings, four-fifths was high, rolling prairies,\n\nabounding in springs and streams of living water, but no\n\nlakes.\n\nIn 1 984, Carroll Plager, Austin, prepared a somewhat\n\nsimilar analysis. Now Mower County is known to have\n\n708 square miles, which breaks down to 453 , 120 acres.\n\nOf that total 10,000 acres are occupied by municipalities,\n\n15,000 by roads and streets, 380,000 is cropland and\n\nsome 50,000 acres for wooded areas and unimproved\n\nland.\n\nCOUNTY BASEBALL HAD HEAVY HITTERS-1871\n\nI\n\nA match game between the State Line Club of LeRoy and\n\nthe Austin Baseball Club was played on the common in\n\nAustin, on Monday afternoon last. It was an exciting\n\ncontest, and some good playing was made. The Austin\n\nclub won by a score of 49 to 36 . A fuller report of the\n\ngame is crowded out. Each ofthese clubs have now won a\n\nmatch game over the other. A third game is to be played\n\nin a few weeks.\n\nA ustin Register. July 13. 1871\n\nPIONEER FARM LIFE-1874\n\nThe following items tell something of the difficulties\n\nencountered by the farmers in the early days. They are\n\nreprinted from issues of the A ugust. 1874, A ustin Register.\n\n\"About one year ago a financial panic was in order,\n\nand things looked pretty blue. If another horse disease,\n\nfinancial panic or something else doesn't turn up before\n\nlong, people in this section will be pretty well fixed.\n\n\"One of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer\n\nfarmer came under our observation one day last week. A\n\nfarmer residing 1 5 miles from Austin, started with a load\n\nof hay drawn by one yoke of oxen. He came to market his\n\nhay in this city.\n\n\" After getting along pretty well on his road, in turning\n\nout for another team, the hayrack struck a burr oak,\n\nbreaking the reach of his wagon. The hay had to be\n\nunloaded in order to repair the broken reach. Then it\n\nwas again pitched on and the farmer proceeded on his\n\njourney.\n\n\" He reached Austin some time after dark, where he\n\noffered his load for sale. With a painful scarcity of\n\nbuyers, he finally sold his load for four dollars, two in\n\ncash and two in trade.\n\n\" Upon driving to the barn to unload, the farmer found\n\nthat he had lest his pitchfork. Here was another dilemma\n\nnot anticipated and one that might disgust any man. Not\n\na whimper of complaint issued from the lips of this\n\npioneer farmer. If this is not Christian forbearance we\n\nare no judge of the article. \"\n\nNOTES FROM \"MIDDLEMAN,\"\n\nTHE LYLE CORRESPONDENT\n\n\"After careful examination we think the small grain\n\nwill yield better this season than many anticipated a few\n\nweeks ago. Grain has matured well under the circumstances,\n\nand come to reaping, we find that it stands\n\nthicker on the ground than expected.\n\n\"We were surprised to see so many Sabbath breakers\n\nyesterday. We counted five machines at work within an\n\narea of three miles. We think if those gentlemen have no\n\nrespect for themselves, they ought to have for their\n\nneigh bors. \"\n\nRATTLESNAKES NEAR LYLE-1874\n\n\" While binding oats on Thursday last, we were all at\n\nonce induced to get around a little livelier than usual by\n\nthe sight of a rattlesnake, which was crawling out from\n\nbetween my feet. I had just raked up the bundle, put the\n\nband under it, bound it and threw it aside, when I was\n\nastonished at the sight of the miserable reptile. I at once\n\ntook revenge by setting my heel over his head . \"\n\n\" We served another likewise the same afternoon. The\n\nthird one made his disappearance by way of it hole.

Go where you may\n\nand you will see acres upon acres of land newly turned\n\nover, new fences built etc. It is safe to say that Mower\n\nCounty is improving fast. \"\n\n\"Barley i s about all stacked and a portion of it\n\nthreshed . Everybody now is busy at work cutting their\n\nwheat and oats. Another week hence, fine weather will\n\nsee the greater portion of small grain in the shock.\n\n\"Everything seems to go smoothly. The beautiful\n\nweather, who could even wish it more favorable, it being\n\nso cool and mild . Although at the beginning of harvest it\n\nwas severely hot. The mercury stood at 108 degrees in the\n\nshade on the 25th of July.\n\n\"Help is plenty. Notwithstanding the crowds of people\n\nthat come from the grasshopper country, and also from\n\nWisconsin, they command their regular $3 per day. We\n\nthink if our brother Grangers would take this matter into\n\nconsideration they might reduce harvest wages to its\n\nactual value. Farmers can't afford to raise wheat at 75\n\ncents and pay such enormous prices for help.\n\n\"If they would agree on one price reasonable for both\n\nparties, say about $2.00, which they would pay, and no\n\nmore, they would get just as much help as they do now.\"\n\nWOLVES AND SNAKES IN BROWNSDALE\n\nJ. M . Weiser was the Brownsdale correspondent to the\n\nAustin Register. The following two items were in the\n\nissue of June 3, 1875:\n\n\"On Saturday night this village was regaled with the\n\nfiercest wolf music it has ever been our fortune to hear.\n\nSome ofthe howlers passed through Main Street and the\n\nrow which they raised amongst themselves and the town\n\ndogs was fearful to hear.\"\n\n\"On Sunday W. T. Setzer and N . R. Pal meter captured\n\nseven young ones on the prairie near Waltham.\n\nThe demand for them as pets or curiosities is likely to\n\nprove as remunerative to the captors as though there was\n\na bounty on their scalps.\n\n\"Mrs. Amos Colby, last Sunday morning, while in the\n\ncellar picking up potatoes for breakfast, brought her hand\n\nunwittingly too near a massasauga, who took her by the\n\nhand savagely and then tried to bite her a second time.\n\nHis length was about ten inches with no rattles . An\n\noutside application of tobacco, and internal use of\n\nalcohol counteracted the effects of the poison.\n\n\"Mr. Reuben Rollings, living half a mile from the\n\nColbys, had one of his cattle bitten about the same time,\n\nwhich we learn has since died .\"\n\nThe above items were reprinted in the A us tin Daily\n\nHerald in June, 1975. Within a few days a letter was\n\nreceived from Mrs. Harry Skov, Dexter, with a sequel to\n\nthe item about Mrs. Colby. Her letter follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Amos Colby was my grandmother. My mother\n\nwas Grace Colby Tanner. I well remember my mother\n\ntelling about that snake bite and how my grandma\n\nscreamed . Grandpa ran down into the cellar, saw what\n\nhad happened and killed the snake. He sent my Uncle\n\nGeorge who was a small lad then, for help. No telephones\n\nthen.\n\n\"There was a small bottle of whiskey kept for just such\n\nthings, but the chew of tobacco was furnished by a neighbor.\n\n\"Another time grandma had just taken a large pan of\n\ncornbread from the oven. She heard sounds and looked\n\nup to see three Indians by the window. Quickly she put\n\nher two small daughters under the dining room table,\n\ntelling them to be very very quiet. She then returned to the\n\nkitchen, cut three pieces of cornbread and handed each\n\nIndian a piece. After they had eaten the pieces one\n\npatted his stomach and pointed at the rest of the cornbread.\n\nGrandma quickly handed it to him and they left,\n\nmaking a sign of friendship.\n\n\"There were many trying times in those days also. \"\n\nBAD ROADS\n\nPathmakers in every direction are at work on the highways.\n\nFor the present such highways are a terror to frail\n\nvehicles . If our road workers would not heap the dirt so\n\nhigh, and make their roads so narrow, they would have\n\nbetter roads.\n\n\"As most of the roads are constructed there is a\n\nnarrow track in the center with sides so steep that a\n\nwagon driven outside of the track is in danger of up-\n\n1 8\n\nsetting. The consequence is deep ruts and mudholes do\n\nthere abound . If the same amout of dirt were piled half\n\nas high and twice as wide, allowing some escape from a\n\nsingle track, the hole would be packed hard and\n\nsmooth and ample drainage effected. \"\n\nJ.

The coal, it is said, resembles\n\nthe soft coal of Iowa, and burns clear and bright. \"\n\n\"The place of discovery i s o n the ridge running north\n\nand south through the eastern part of Pleasant Valley. It\n\nis about half a mile east of E. R.

Our\n\nboys have had similar experience, heretofore, and lost no\n\nlaurels by it. They came on the field confident in their\n\nability to sustain the name they have chosen. And well\n\nthey did, snatching victory from almost certain defeat.\n\n\"At the end of eight innings it was 8 for the\n\nChampions and 1 1 for Mourners.

It is one county-wide event which is\n\nlooked forward to and enjoyed by almost everyone; town\n\nor country. Anyone who grew up in Mower County can\n\nrecall events at the Fair which were special.\n\nThe Mower County Fair has a story which goes back\n\n120 years. Citizens began to talk about this need early in\n\n1863. County Commissioners R. C. Heath, A. Beach and\n\nG. T. Angell called a meeting on September 22, 1863 to\n\ndiscuss the formation of a County Agricultural Society.\n\nThis was the first step toward getting a fair, as the\n\nSociety would then be recognized by the Minnesota State\n\nFair. Also, the Society would receive books, agricultural\n\ndocuments and other items of interest.\n\nThs Society's purpose was to improve agriculture,\n\ncreate new ideas, develop the county and educate young\n\nfarmers.\n\nThe Society was officially formed at the Austin post\n\noffice on September 22, 1863. Officers and directors\n\nwere elected and a formal constitution was drafted .\n\nUnder this constitution any family could have an annual\n\nmembership for $ 1 .00 or a lifetime membership for\n\n$10.00.\n\nThe first fair in Mower County was held in Lansing on\n\nOctober 1 1 and 12, 1 864. Every village in the county had\n\nthe opportunity to offer a premium and the highest\n\nbidder would have the privilege of hosting the fair. Much\n\nto the disgruntlement of Austin citizens, Lansing offered\n\nthe highest premium. They hosted the first fair.\n\nPeople from the surrounding counties were invited to\n\nthe Mower County Fair. The $ 1 .00 membership to the\n\nsociety entitled the family to admission to the Fair, and\n\n21\n\nalso allowed the holder to enter livestock and goods. Individuals\n\nwere admitted for 2516 .\n\nOfficers of the Society said that the first fair was a\n\nsuccess, and began planning for the following autumn.\n\nThe 2nd Mower County Fair was held October 10 and\n\n1 1 , 1 865. The grounds were improved to provide a place\n\nfor exhibiting. A track was added for a women's\n\nequestrian display and for exhibition of trotting horses.\n\nPublic officials addressed fairgoers on agricultural\n\nconcerns.\n\nIn spite of all efforts to encourage participation, the\n\n1865 fair was not a success and the Agricultural Society\n\nwas dissolved.\n\nThe revival came in 1 868. A meeting for all interested\n\ncitizens was held in Austin's brick school house on July 3 1 ,\n\n1868. The new Agricultural Society was formed with a\n\nconstitution and by-laws which promoted agriculture,\n\nhorticulture, stock raising and the mechanical arts. A\n\ncounty resident could again become a member for $1 .00.\n\nThe new Society made sure that agriculture was the\n\ndominant part of the revived fair. They offered $400 in\n\npremiums. A race track was provided for the speed trials\n\nof \"fast nags,\" but it was strongly stated that the races\n\nwould not monopolize the fair.\n\nThe new society held its first fair on October 14 and\n\n15, 1868. Owing to the short time the society had for\n\npreparation, the bad state of the weather, and the exciting\n\npolitical times, it was feared the fair would be a\n\nfailure. However, the clouds cleared away and the\n\nofficers prepared temporary grounds on the. public\n\nsquare. Then some splendid cattle were brought together\n\nwith horses, hogs, machinery, wagons, buggies and other\n\nproducts.\n\nThe Austin Democrat said, \"The fair may be\n\nconsidered as a perfect success. The fact was plainly\n\ndemonstrated that we can have one of the best fairs in the\n\nState next season. Success will attend the Mower County\n\nAgricultural Society. \"\n\nInterest in Fair Again Declines\n\nFor several years the Mower County Fair continued\n\nsatisfactorily, but then interest faded. Then, in 1882,\n\ncitizens urged the Agricultural Society to join with the\n\nFarmers' Alliance. This was a progressive group which\n\npromoted farmers' interests.\n\nAt a meeting of the Farmers' Alliance on July 5, 1882,\n\nthe committee voted to aid the Agricultural Society in\n\nsoliciting funds to purchase permanent grounds for the\n\nCounty Fair.\n\nFair Grounds Purchased\n\nEarly in 1 883 the Agriculture Society purchased the\n\nAustin Driving Park for use as a county fairgrounds. The\n\ncost was $ 1 , 800. Plans were made to improve the fairgrounds\n\nby repairing the floral hall, dwelling house,\n\nstables and judges stand. They also hoped to erect a new\n\ngrandstand and 90 rods of board fence. The Society\n\nbegan the sale of membership tickets early to finance the\n\n$600 of improvements. A $2.00 family ticket entitled\n\nfreedom of the fairgrounds during all the days of the fair.\n\nFamily members also could enter goods and livestock\n\nwithout further fees.\n\nSuddenly, on September 3, 1883, the Basford block in\n\ndowntown Austin crumbled . The premium list was being\n\nprinted by Mr. Basford, and the type was destroyed .\n\nThere was not enough time to reprint the 40-50 page\n\nbook before Fair time. Officers of the Fair decided that\n\nthis loss, together with accompanying circumstances, required\n\nthat they cancel the Fair.\n\n1884 Fair was Successful\n\nFinally, in 1884, Mower County's first successful fair\n\nwas held on the grounds of the former Austin Driving\n\nPark. This was the first of a succession of prosperous\n\nCounty Fairs to be held at that location.\n\nEntries at the Fair during this period were in Flowers\n\nand Vegetables, Grain, Flour and Seeds (wheat, barley,\n\ncorn, peas, clover, timothy, buckwheat, flax and hops) ,\n\nDairy and Household Articles (butter, cheese, honey,\n\nmolasses, baking and canning, wine-blackberry, grape,\n\ngooseberry, strawberry, raspberry, currant, rhubarb,\n\ntomato) .\n\nAlso in Plowing, Horses, Cattle, Poultry, Domestic\n\nManufactures, Farm Implement (democrat wagon,\n\nplows, bob sleds) , Dairy Household (churn, brooms,\n\ncistern pump, washing machines) , Furniture, Leather\n\nGoods (boots, harnesses, saddles) , Carriage and Buggies\n\nand Fine Arts (painting, photos, ambrotypes, penmanship,\n\nneedlecraft) .\n\nThrough the succeeding years the fair changed in\n\norganization, length, style and format. The fair\n\nbroadened its scope to include commercial . and trade\n\nconcessions. Forms of entertainment were added to\n\nbroaden interest for the entire family. Circuses, carnivals,\n\nrodeos, zoos and other professional entertainment\n\n22\n\nand novelty items became a part of the Mower County\n\nFair.\n\n1940 Officers\n\nA . O . Starks served as president and Ben Huseby as\n\nsecretary at the 1 940 annual meeting of the Mower\n\nCounty Agricultural Society. Elected to the board then\n\nwere Herman Lerud, William Murphy, Russell\n\nThompson, Ormanzo Peterson, Gunner Youngdahl,\n\nOscar Erickson, N. C. Goodwin, Alvin Baudler and\n\nRichard Rahilly. Alvin Baudler was then elected president;\n\nGoodwin, vice president; P. J. Holand, secretary;\n\nLerud, treasurer, Murphy, Thompson, Peterson,\n\nErickson, Youngdahl and Rahilly, directors.\n\nDuring 1941 a number of improvements in the fairgrounds\n\nwere made with the help of the NY A. A fire\n\ndestroyed one of the exhibition buildings in 1 942, and it\n\nwas replaced the following year.\n\nGrounds Expanded and Crane Pavilion Dedicated\n\nThe original fairgrounds was 25.6 acres. The Galloway\n\npit was added in 1948 with 5.6 acres, the Dee property in\n\n1949 with 7 . 1 acres, the city pit in 1 951 with 9.4 acres,\n\nthe Zerkel property, across the street to the south with\n\n5.0 acres and the Mickelson gravel pit of 2. 1 acres.\n\nThe livestock exhibit building on the fairgrounds was\n\ndedicated in August, 1948 and named the Crane Livestock\n\nPavilion. It became the home of the National Barrow\n\nShow and of other livestock exhibitions. The\n\nbuilding burned in 1955 and was replaced. It continues\n\nto be the home of the National Barrow Show and other\n\nevents.\n\n4H has been a part of the Fair's cooperation with\n\nyouth for many years. In 1945 the FFA (Future Farmers\n\nof America) was invited to participate with livestock exhibits.\n\nThese programs for the youth continue to be an\n\nimportant part of the fair. The Children's Farm Yard is\n\nanother feature for the young.\n\nIn cooperation with the Hormel Company the Midwest\n\nSteer Show, Midwest Market Hog Show and, earlier, the\n\nFat Lamb Show, have been an integral part of the fair.\n\nThe Best County Fair Plant in the State\n\nP. J. Holand, secretary ofthe Fair for 34 years, wrote a\n\nnews article for the Austin Herald in 1953, Mower\n\nCounty's Centennial year. An excerpt follows:\n\n\"It is no wonder that the Mower County Fair is a big\n\ninstitution. The preparations for the exposition are in\n\nprocess all year around . The physical plant is by far the\n\nfinest county fair plant in the state. Our people have seen\n\nto it that it is and what's more-they want to keep it that\n\nway.\"\n\nMany Dedicated Fair Board Members\n\nAs previously mentioned , P . J .

Civil War\n\nveterans and the pioneers of Mower.\n\nThe Mower County Pioneer and Historical Society had\n\nan unusual beginning. It came about because of an idea\n\nsuggested at an honorary dinner.\n\nIn August, 1 947 the Mower County Fair acknowledged\n\nand honored the farmers who had resided on their farms\n\nin the county for a half-century. Portraits were taken of\n\nthese fifty-two farmers, men and women. Then they were\n\nthe featured guests at a dinner. Minnesota's Govenor\n\nLuther Youngdahl was the main speaker.\n\nDuring the course of the dinner the suggestion was\n\nmade that a pioneer association be organized . This idea\n\nwas then presented to the honored guests, and they enthusiastically\n\nendorsed it.\n\nOn September 30. 1 947 a grou p of half-century farmers\n\nand Austin businessmen met at the Crane Pavilion on\n\nthe fairgrounds. At that meeting they formed the Mower\n\nCounty Pioneer and Historical Society. They also discussed\n\nthe possibility of erecting a pioneer building.\n\nThose at the meeting were Richard Rahilly, John Skinner,\n\nMrs. Clara Sayles, J. H. Aultfather, Mrs. S. H .\n\nWarrington, Jay Daane, George Reppe, Guy Wold,\n\nRobert Bagley, Nels Goodwin, Gunnard Youngdahl,\n\nCharles Fox, N. F. Banfield, Leonard Decker, Will\n\nPhillips and P. J. Holand .\n\n25\n\nA committee was appointed to draft by-laws, make\n\nplans for a pioneer building and to work out membership\n\nplans. This group included Richard Rahilly, chairman;\n\nN. F. Banfield, Mrs. Clara Sayles, J. H. Aultfather and\n\nMrs. S. H. Warrington.\n\nBetween the years of 1945 and 1947 the historical\n\nmementos were displayed in a large tent at the east end\n\nof the fairgrounds.\n\nOn October 8, 1 947, in the Austin High School auditorium,\n\nRichard Rahilly was elected temporary chairman\n\nand P. J. Holand, temporary secretary. George Reppe\n\nwas appointed finance chairman and instructed to begin\n\nplans for a membership and fund drive. The goal was\n\nconstruction of a pioneer building on the fairgrounds. As\n\na result there were soon 900 names on the active and\n\nhonorary membership roll.\n\nIn 1 948 GAR funds were contributed to the building\n\nfund through McIntyre Post #66, W.R.C. Judge Martin\n\nA. Nelson was instrumental in arranging this gift.\n\nBids were let for the Mower County Pioneer and\n\nHistorical building on April 26, 1949. The building was\n\ndedicated August 9, 1949. Present at the dedication were\n\nJudge Nelson, Governor Youngdahl, former governors J .\n\nA. A . Burnquist and Hjalmer Peterson. Father D . A .\n\nCunningham gave the dedicatory address. A dinner\n\nfollowed at the Queen of Angels hall. Speakers were Will\n\nPhillips, a 50 year farmer, J. H. Skinner for the pioneers\n\nand Roy T. Anderson, who represented the war veterans\n\nof the county.\n\nThis new Historical Building fulfilled a dream for the\n\nhalf-century farmers and was also a Minnesota Territorial\n\nCentennial project for Mower"
