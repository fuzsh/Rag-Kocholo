(To the Editor of the Twillingate Sun) Sir, -- Can you tell your readers why the Polling Station has been removed from the Congregational School to some other place farther down the South Side? We have long been hearing that Mr. LETHBRIDGE means to know how his dealers vote, and we were told he was taking steps to secure his party, but as this was to be an election by Ballot, we thought we were safe from any merchant control. Now, at the last moment, we are told we must go and vote in some place where the agents of Messrs. LETHBRIDGE or OWEN will be present in large numbers. How can a poor man, whose living depends on these merchants, give his vote, in their presence as he would wish? Sir, it means starvation for himself and family this winter, if he will not vote with these merchants. It is an outrage of the secrecy of Ballot, to remove a polling station from the only place where a free and independent vote could be given, to another place where we shall be forced to vote against our convictions. It does not show any wish to consult the convenience of the voters, for what could have been more central than the Congregational School, for persons who had to come from Tickle Point, the Point or Bluff Head Cove?\" Sale of Works The Sale of Work for the purpose of defraying the cost of renovating and furnishing the Methodist parsonage, is announced to take place on the 19th, 20th and 21st of November. Ship News The \"\"Fleta\"\" with the two government candidates, Messrs. GOODRIDGE and KNIGHT, arrived from the North side of the district on Tuesday night, and left for the Cape Shore on Thursday. Departure W. WATERMAN, Esq., of Poole, England, who has been spending a few months with his friends in this Bay, left for St. John's on Monday last in the fine schooner \"\"Portland\"\" en route for England. Mrs. WATERMAN who was visiting with him, went by last \"\"Conscript\"\" and both will leave St. John's in the first Allan boat. We wish them a safe and speedy passage across the Atlantic. Bazaar The bazaar in connection with St. Andrew's Church was opened on Tuesday last and continued the following days. A fine display of fancy and useful articles was exhibited which met with a ready sale, and the undertaking all through, was a decided success. A full report which was promised has no yet been furnished, but we hope to be able to give it in next paper. Nominations Wednesday last, the 30th ult., being Nomination Day, the candidates for our district were duly nominated at the Court House. The Hon. A.F. GOODRIDGE, Messrs. Smith, McKAY and M. T. KNIGHT were put in Nomination as Government candidates, and Messrs. Thomas PEYTON, E.R. BURGESS and J.P. THOMPSON for WHITEWAY party. There were no speeches on the occasion and everything passed quietly. Ballot Papers The action of the Government with respect to the printing of the ballot paper, should be sufficient of itself to open the eyes of our people as to the meanness and contemptability of the Government. The ballot papers could have been printed at the Sun Office, but because our political views are adverse to the Government, they prefer sending a printer from St. John's to do them, at five or perhaps ten times the cost that they could have been printed at the Sun office; but then they are running the Government on \"\"Sound Commercial Principles!\"\"\" Politics The \"\"Hiram Perry\"\" arrived here noon on Tuesday, bringing the three WHITEWAY candidates also Mr. F. WALSH of Little Bay. After leaving Little Bay, several places were visited, and a public meeting held. The one at Little Bay Island was well attended and much interest was manifested by the electors present. The conduct of the Government in the public affairs of the colony, was reviewed by the candidates, and at the close of the meeting, the candidates were loudly cheered. Our meeting at Fortune Harbor was an immense success. Mr. Francis WALSH of Little Bay Mines, was present and in an able and eloquent speech, reviewed the history of the Government during the past four years. His explanation of Railway matters whereby the support of the Liberal Party was purchased; his though explanation of working of the Bait Act; his bitter condemnation of the monopoly of mining and timber lands were clearly explained. He was listened to attentively and loudly cheered during his able address. Mr. WALSH is a young man of considerable talent and will no doubt in the near future take a prominent part in the public affairs of his native land Ballots \"\"Secrecy of the Ballot Vote.\" The voting by ballot is perfectly secret and no one need fear it being discovered as to how he may vote. Those who are attempting to do so are misleading the people, and are liable to the penalty of the law. We were informed by a very intelligent laborer on one of the city wharves yesterday, that many of the uneducated people of the city are still under the impression that it is possible for it to be known for whom a man votes. For the information of every one having doubts on this subject, we say, emphatically, that it cannot be known to any one, how a man places his cross, except in the case of a man not being able to read or write, in which event it is known only to the returning officer who is sworn to secrecy. Should the latter, despite his oath, betray the secret (which is highly improbable) he will, on being convicted of the offence, be subject to twelve months imprisonment. The ballot is the poor man's safeguard, he can vote according to his conscience and no one will be the wiser. -- St. John's Daily Colonist. By Telegraph (Special to the Sun) Little Bay, Oct 29. - GOODRIDGE and KNIGHT held a public meeting here last night. They were contradicted in many statements and could not give satisfactory answers. WHITEWAY and party were cheered throughout the meeting Voting CAUTION! As everything is being done by the Government agents to mislead the public in voting, in the hope of counteracting their base designs, we print, for the information of the public, the following rules, to guide them on Polling Day. We also append a form of ballot paper, made out for the district of Twillingate. The ballot paper shows that the voter has voted the straight ticket for BURGESS, PEYTON and THOMPSON. Form of Ballot Paper after voter has marked his cross on it, 1. BURGESS, Edward R. Burgess of Little Bay, Contractor, X. 2. GOODRIDGE, A.F. Goodridge of St. John's, Merchant. 3. KNIGHT, M.T. Knight of St. John', Gentleman. 4. McKAY, Smith McKay of St. John's, Gentleman. 5. PEYTON, Thomas Peyton of Twillingate, Surveyor, X. 6. THOMPSON, J.P. Thompson of Twillingate, Editor, X. Rules: 1st - Each Elector when he enters the booth shall give his name. 2nd - He shall then receive a ballot paper in the above form (without the crosses). 3rd - The voter can only give as many votes as there are members required for the district. 4th - After receiving a ballot paper the voter going inside marks a cross in the division on the ballot paper containing the name or names of the candidates for whom he intends to vote, thus: - X. 5th - The voter will then hand the ballot paper folded up, to the returning officer who will drop it into the ballot box. It must be so folded as to show the initials of the returning officer, which is on the back of it. 6th - If the voter spoils a ballot paper he may get another one. 7th - If the voter votes for more than the number of members he is entitled to vote for, his ballot paper is void and his vote of no use. The above are the principal rules. If a man is blind or cannot read, the returning officer marks his ballot paper for him in the presence of an agent of each candidate, all of whom are sworn. If any one divulges for whom a voter voted, he is liable to be sent to the penitentiary. So no one need fear discovery. Politics (Part 1) Political Meeting At Herring Neck. On Monday evening last a public meeting was held at Salt Harbor, Herring Neck, though under somewhat adverse circumstances. It was generally known there that the Editor of this paper, one of the Whiteway candidates, would be there, at the solicitation of some of the supporters of the party, to address there, for the second time during the campaign on election matters. But on arriving late in the evening, it was found that the school house had been engaged by a few supporters of the Government, with the intention no doubt of preventing our meeting from being held in the building, and the idea of holding a meeting that evening was abandoned. After tea, however, large numbers commenced to crowd toward the school, thinking that the meeting was to be held, and we were summoned to put in an appearance. Great indignation prevailed among the assembled crowd, nearly all of whom were determined supporters of the Whiteway candidates Politics (Part 2) The door was forced open and lights put in for the purpose of holding the meeting, but without the consent of the members of the Board, who were opposed to us in politics, we did not deem it advisable to enter the building, and addressed the large and enthusiastic crowd at some length under the broad canopy of Heaven; and although human nature appeared to conspire against us, Providence smiled upon us, for the moon in all its grandeur luminated the settlement, making it almost impossible to witness a finer night any time through the year. Added to this we were in close proximity to the parish lamps, which have recently been erected there. The audience listened with rapt attention, and the orderly conduct maintained throughout under the excited state of feeling, in consequence of not having the school, was most commendable, and reflects the highest credit upon the good people of Herring Neck. Politics (Part 3) When it was found that a dodge had been worked to prevent a meeting being held in the interest of the Whiteway party, it was decided by the people that no other should take place there that night, and two or three of the sturdy electors guarded the door until half past twelve, and kept any of the opposite party from entering, as they intended holding a political committee meeting there. This is not the only place where such contemptible meanness was shown to the Whiteway party during their canvass, by what are looked upon as the leading men of the settlements, and is a specimen of the adverse circumstances under which the canvass had to be carried on, and the disposition that existed to grind out every spark of independence in the breasts of the electors. With regard to not having the use of the school at Herring Neck, however it is only right for us to exonerate the Rev. G.S. CHAMBERLAIN from any blame in the matter, as he had nothing to do whatever in withholding its use, as can be seen from a note over his own signature in another column. The following evening (Tuesday) another meeting was held in the Methodist school, Greens Cove, which was largely attended, and great interest appeared to be manifested by all present. The meeting was also addressed by Mr. F.W. COAKER and the WHITEWAY candidates were loudly applauded. A Disclaimer (To the Editor of the Twillingate Sun) Sir, -- Permit me through the medium of the Sun to repudiate any connection in withholding the School House in this settlement from you, for the purpose of your public meeting on Monday last. The whole episode has occasioned me deep pain. I am Yours faithfully, G.S. CHAMBERLAIN, Chairman C.E.Bd. Education, Herring Neck, St. Mary's Parsonage, Nov 5 Letter to The Editor From A Herring Neck Planter. (To the Editor of the Twillingate Sun) Dear Sir, -- please insert the following in behalf of the people of herring Neck, who I must say are rejoicing over the New Party's success at present. On Monday the 4th inst., a meeting was announced to be held in St. Mary's school at 7.30 p.m. at which Mr. THOMPSON was to address the people. At the time appointed a large crowd gathered, but to their amazement they could not get the school, Messrs LOCKYER & Co. of the Old Party, had worked a disgraceful scheme to try to put down Mr. THOMPSON. He had obtained the key of the school by force, and had claimed the possession of the school, without the consent of the Chariman, Rev. G.S. CHAMBERLAIN, to whom much credit is due, insomuch as that he declared before a large mass of people that they (Messrs. LOCKYER & Co.) had ignored him the right of the position of Chairman, and taken the key of the school without his consent, also declared himself neutral in Politics, and showed the people that he was no tool of the slave-driving merchants, at the close of which he was cheered to the utmost, and the people felt that they owed to him a place in their hearts that could never be taken again, and as long as life lasts he will have the best sympathies of the people of Herring Neck. And, Mr. Editor, we as the people of Herring Neck, will no more be ruled by the staving power of merchants. This event of Messrs. LOCKYER & Co., will forever be a blank in the Merchant's Books. The people are determined that they will in future, have the control of the school which they built and paid for, also that never again will they allow such a tyrant as LOCKYER to rule their private affairs. Trusting I have not taken too much of your valuable space, I am, on behalf of the people, Yours etc., A.H.N. Planter\" Ship Arrival The steamer \"\"Walrus\"\" arrived here noon to-day with the ballot boxes, &c., and counting commenced this afternoon. Ship Departure The steamer \"\"Conscript\"\" left St. John's about noon yesterday for the Northern ports of call, and may be looked for here to-morrow.

BLANDFORD, Mrs. T. BLANDFORD, Mrs. W. MURCELL, Mrs. HINES and Mrs. REX. Diphtheria Within the past few weeks there have been several cases of Diphtheria in this community, but we are happy to say that the disease has not increased to any great extent, and has been confined to a few families only. We are not aware that any fresh cases have broken out lately. Visitors During the past week or two, a good many of our old friends from various parts of the bay have been here transacting their Fall's business. Among the number we were pleased to see Mr. W. ROUSELL of Leading Tickles and Mr. James PARSONS of Lushes Bight, the latter we regret to know being in a delicate state of health. Politics A Lying Telegram. On Wednesday afternoon Mr. KNIGHT received a telegram from a Mr. MARCH who is in Little Bay, saying that Mr. BURGESS, the local Whiteway candidate of that mining settlement, had been soliciting support for himself and the Government candidates, which is one of the greatest falsehoods ever invented. No doubt it was intended to get here early in the day, but providentially it was not received until the afternoon, a little while before the polls closed. the intention was to damage Mr. BURGESS and the party here, which would have been the case had it come along in the early part of the day, and particularly would it have affected our Little bay Colleague. This was a most malicious and dastardly attempt to ruin a political opponent and no language can be employed that would too strongly condemn such political rascality Election Returns \"\"By Telegraph\"\".

Sick Fishermen (Part 1) Sick Fishermen Badly Treated on Labrador. Instances have been brought to our notice within the past few weeks, which show that sick fishermen are very badly treated on the Labrador, by those in charge of the steamers, that are employed by Government to convey mails and passengers up and down the coast. During the past season, one of our fishermen was overtaken by sickness while on the coast, and feeling so poorly, he decided on coming home. When a passage was applied for, the sick man was refused because he did not have the full fare, and consequently he was denied the privilege of embarking on board the steamer and returning home, and had to remain on the Labrador in his enfeebled condition, and run the risk of his life, which was greatly imperiled by the inhumane act of the commander in charge of the ship Sick Fishermen (Part 2) We hardly know who is at fault in a matter of this kind; whether it is optional with the Captain to deal with such cases, or whether orders are given to this effect by the Government, but it is certainly a most arbitrary rule, and one which subjects a poor sick fisherman to severe hardship. When we consider that these steamers are largely subsidized out of the public funds of the colony, it appears decidedly wrong that a poor fisherman, when overtaken by sickness, should be refused to be brought home in one of these steamers. By not being able to leave the coast it might be the means of losing his life, and the craft with which he would be connected missing a voyage of fish. There are very few fishermen who take money with them to Labrador, in fact thousands seldom see a shilling in the early part of the summer especially, let alone being in a position to take money enough with them to cope with such a contingency as we have alluded to Sick Fishermen (Part 3) It is the fishermen of the country who principally pay the taxes, and the least that could be done for any who may unfortunately be overtaken by sickness on the Labrador or elsewhere while prosecuting the fishery, is that a passage should be secured for them to their homes in the coastal steamers. It is hoped that this matter will be investigated so that in the future our poor suffering fishermen will have no need to complain further of the bad treatment that they have received when applying for passages homewards. At the same time we would call the attention of the authorities to the way in which our fishermen were served the past summer with respect to their letters. Some of them who were fishing in harbors long distances from where the mail steamers used to call, took the trouble to row in their boats some miles from their craft in order to meet the steamer to put their letters on board, and although they were near the ship the captain did not pay the slightest attention to them, and passed along without waiting a moment to take the letters from the fishermen, and consequently they were denied the privilege of sending them home. It made no difference how important such letters were, they could not be forwarded which might mean a serious loss to the parties concerned Death of Mrs. BERTEAU We regret to have to record to-day the death of Mrs. BERTEAU, wife of F. BERTEAU, Esq., Stipendiary Magistrate, which sad event took place yesterday afternoon. For several months the deceased had been subject to a severe attack of illness which not only prostrated her bodily but likewise affected her mind; and for the greater part of her illness she was apparently insensible to even her nearest relations. During the summer Mrs. BERTEAU was removed to St. John's with the hope that the change and additional medical attendance would prove favorable to her recovery, but such however was not the result, instead of which she seemed to be getting worse, and she was brought back. Since then the deceased has been gradually sinking, until yesterday afternoon, when the death visitor appeared and she passed calmly and peacefully into rest. Mrs. BERTEAU was a very kind and charitably disposed lady, and in her the poor ever found a real friend, and many will miss a true heart that always beat towards the poor and who was ever ready to administer to their wants. The bereaved family have our heartfelt sympathy. Letter A Letter From Mr. CARELY. Herring Neck, Nov 18th. (To the Editor of the Twillingate Sun) Sir, -- Having been informed that my name has been used around this settlement in connection with the scurrilous attack made upon Mr. LOCKLYER, in a letter lately published in your paper over the signature of \"\"A.H.N, Planter\"\", permit me to say that I had nothing whatever to do with the letter in question, or knew anything about it until shown me in print. I may say that I express the general opinion of the planters of this settlement (both Now and Old Party) in saying that they very much regret any person should have written such deliberate untruths from this settlement over the signature of \"\"A.H.N. Planter,\"\" and I can assure you, Mr. Editor, that the imputation cast upon Mr. LOCKLYER of scheming to put you down, and taking the key of the schoolroom by force, is and uncalled for and untruthful statement. Yours Truly, Joseph CARELY. Ship Arrival The steamer \"\"Conscript\"\" arrived at Greenspond at 9.30 this morning. Subscriptions We are thankful to subscribers who have already sent in their subscriptions and would feel obliged if others would do so at an early date, particularly those living at a distance Ship Arrival/Departure The little steamer \"\"Matilda\"\" belonging to R. SCOTT, Esq., came here from Fogo on Thursday and returned the following day. The \"\"Portland\"\" arrived from St. John's on Thursday afternoon with a general cargo of merchandise for Messrs. W. Waterman & Co. Mail The English mail was late in arriving at St. John's this time and the \"\"Conscript\"\" did not leave for Northern ports until midnight Thursday. She may be expected here to-night. Meeting Companions of the R.S.C. Edward 7th, Chap. No. 3, will meet in the Hall on Saturday, 14th December, for the election of officers. Also, there will be some important business to transact which calls for the attention of all Companions. -- Advt Visiting Clergy On Sunday last, the Rev. W. HARRIS of St. Anthony who is spending a few days here, preached in the South and North side Methodist churches, morning and evening, alternately, delivering earnest discourses on both occasions to the congregations to whom he formerly expounded the Word. He leaves by this \"\"Conscript\"\" for his mission. Firewood With the exception of a few days, this has been a delightful Fall for getting about on the water, and it has been taken advantage of the past few weeks by a large number of craft that have been frequenting the bays for firewood. A good many are still engaged in this business, and some will be going until Christmas unless the weather should set in very severe in the meantime. Sale of Work The sale of work in aid of the Methodist parsonage, as announced the previous issues, was opened in the South Side school house on Tuesday afternoon, and continued the two following evenings. The room was nicely decorated for the occasion and the display of goods very attractive, and met with ready sales. Between two and three hundred dollars were realized Visiting Clergy The Rev. Mr. SNOW of Exploits and Leading Tickles mission, spent a few days in town the early part of the week and preached in St. Peter's Church on Sunday morning last, giving a fine discourse. Mr. SNOW has only been a few weeks in the mission, and the esteem in which he is held by the flock under his charge, many of whom we have had personal intercourse with, augers well for a successful ministry while laboring in that parish New Schooner \"\"A Splendid New Craft.\" Another excellent schooner which was recently launched at Rabbit's Arm for the firm of Messrs. Waterman & Co., arrived in port the early part of the week. She was built by Mr. Francis WARR, whose reputation as a master-builder is so favorably known and who has turned out so many fine craft in the past. The \"\"Canford\"\" adds one more to the many superiorily built vessels that he has put out of hands, and is one of the largest that has been built at Rabbit's Arm for sometime. She has not yet been measured, but is supposed to go about ninety-six tons. A more strongly or faithfully built craft could scarcely float on the water, while her model is such as to command the admiration of all who are competent to form opinions respecting the same. An immense quantity of iron has been utilized in her construction which is an evidence that she has been firmly and strongly built, and without due regard to economy, the true object being to have her thoroughly well fastened so as to make her suitable for contending with the mighty elements with which she will be brought into contact during her existence. The Canford is adapted for the Bank fishery or the general trade of the Colony. She will do credit to her builder wherever she goes and it is hoped that a long and prosperous existence awaits this fine craft\" Died Yesterday afternoon after a lingering illness, Mary, beloved wife of F.

However, there was a little stir Monday, November 5th for early in the morning, guns heavy guns, disturbed the sleeping village.

Fogo News Dec. 4th a capital concert was held in the Fishermen's hall towards the debt on the Methodist parsonage. Though the night was exceedingly cold the large hall was full, and $25.85 were realized, out of which the hall expenses, $5, had to be deducted. It was hoped the society would have charged less for the building, it being for a charitable object. Mr. STONE, one of the performers at the concert and secretary of the society, considering it was too high a charge, gave a subscription to help pay for the building. It is thought the hall would be much oftener hired if the charge were reduced. It was a capital concert and the audience was delighted for the three hours. Among the performers were Dr. MALCOM, Mr. STONE, Messrs. J. SCOTT and F. SCOTT, Mr. STEPHENSON and Rev. A. SKINNER and Mr. J. HODGE. Mrs. ABRAHAM, Miss ROSS, Miss KIROY and Miss SCOTT. On Dec. 23rd. a Xmas Tree will be held in the Methodist school house. But for these and a few other diversions we should be asleep nearly all the time. It is feared there will be much poverty here this winter. The cases of diphtheria at Seldom-Come-by are fast dying out. Mr. T.C. DUDER has gone to St. John's for the winter and Mr. EARLE is at present in England. Mr. FITZGERALD is now quite well. Seals A few seals have been captured in nets within the past week or ten days Ship News Several craft returned from St. John's the early part of the week. The \"\"Mary Parker\"\" sailed for there this morning. Meeting A meeting of the Patriotic Club will take place in the Hall next Friday evening at eight o'clock when all the members are requested to attend Meetings Interesting Church of England Missionary Meetings have been held this week. On Tuesday evening one was held in St. Peter's Church and the following evening in St. Andrew's, report of which will be found in another part of this paper. Meeting We are requested to announce that a meeting of the Dorcas Society will be held at the Court House on Wednesday evening next at 3 o'clock. This is the first meeting for the season and it is desired, that if possible, all the members will be present. Meeting Companions of the R.S.C. Edward 7th, Chap. No. 3, will meet in the Hall this (Saturday) evening at 7.30 sharp, for the election of officers. Also, there will be some important business to transact which calls for the attention of all Companions. -- Advt. Drunkenness It is said that the scene on the coastal wharf on Sunday night, while the Conscript was in port, was somewhat disgraceful. Some parties were under the influence of strong drink, but whether it was procured on board or ashore we cannot say. However, the authorities should be vigilant on such occasions Burglary at the Army On Sunday night week, between nine and ten o'clock, the house occupied by the Captain and Cadet of the Salvation Army, on Tickle Point, was burgularously entered by the back door, a cash box broken open, and some twenty-one or twenty-two dollars stolen therefrom. No clue to the miscreants has yet been discovered. Death News was received here the early part of the week, of the death of Smith McKAY, Esq., who has been ill for some time past. For fourteen or fifteen years he represented this district and for the past two terms he occupied the position of Chairman of the Board of Works, giving general satisfaction. The intelligence of his death will be received with regret by his numerous friends far or near The Law We have received a communication from a \"\"Sufferer\"\" about the negligence of the authorities in not bringing to justice guilty parties who have been violating the law, but we consider it rather personal and pointed, for a place in our columns. The writer says the \"\"past twelve months there have been no less than six shops, offices or dwelling houses burgularized and no trace has yet been found of the perpetrators.\" This certainly is an unfortunate and unsatisfactory state of things, yet we do not know whether any blame can be attached to our police officers for not ferreting out the guilty parties. In reference to the last burgulary that has been perpetrated, however, it is only right to say that Constable BURT was suffering from an attack of illness at the time and has scarcely been able to perform duty since Ship Arrival The coastal steamer \"\"Conscript\"\" arrived Sunday night. She goes as far as Griquet and is expected here to-day. Appended is the list of passengers: -- Bay de Verts - Mrs. MURRAY, nine steerage. Trinity - Constable WALSH and wife, Messrs.

Indeed, at no time has there been more interest evinced in this important department of Christian work than at the present. Throughout the day the churches were filled to their utmost capacity, and the collections taken at the various services bore ample testimony to the great liberality of the congregations. The sermons preached by Rev. Dr. LATHERN, of Halifax, were eloquent and effective. Not only is he an able speaker, but, in addition to this great and powerful characteristic, the Reverend gentleman possesses a venerable and commanding exterior, well calculated to favorably impress an audience. A meeting will be held in George Street Church, this evening, at which the Rev. Dr. LATHERN will again speak. The service tomorrow evening will be conducted in Cochrane Street Chruch. Evening Telegram, Dec 2. Ship Grounding \"\"Ashore At Chain Rock.\" A vessel named the \"\"Hyacinth,\"\" belonging to Mr. J. MANUEL, of Exploits, and commanded by Capt. A. LILY, went ashore at Chain Rock, yesterday, whilst beating the Narrows. Another vessel was beating in at the time and the Hyacinth would have collided with her had she not gone ashore. Notwithstanding her being a new vessel, her bows were badly broken and the two pumps have to be kept continually working to keep her free. She is a substantially built vessel of eighty tons, and had on board at the time of the accident eight hundred quintals of fish and two hundred barrels of herring. The fish is damaged very little. She will go on dock after the cargo is discharged. -- Colonist, Dec. 2. Died On Nov. 30th, at Friday's Bay, Julia daughter of Thomas and Ellen GOSS, aged 5 years.
