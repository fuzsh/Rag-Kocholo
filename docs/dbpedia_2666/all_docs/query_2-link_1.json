        "text": "Governor, 1876-1881, 1883-1885\n\nGlover was born in Yateley, Hampshire, England on February 24, 1829. His began his naval service in 1841 and, early in his career, survived a shot that entered under his right eye and passed through his left ear. Glover worked on surveying ships in the Mediterranean, Africa and Burma until 1862 when he joined the colonial service. He started as an administrator in Lagos in 1863 and the following year became its colonial secretary. In 1873 he led a campaign that suppressed the Ashanti tribe. For his success, Glover received thanks from the British parliament and was knighted.\n\nGlover was made governor of Newfoundland twice. His first term lasted from 1876 to 1881; the second was for a few months in 1884. Premiers Frederic Carter and William Whiteway, both talented and prominent men, guided Glover in his administration. They wanted less British influence in Newfoundland and, for the most part, Glover stayed out of the way. He worked to maintain good relations between the colony and Britain. Glover was the first governor to travel most of the island. He and his wife visited fishing outports and inspected work places and mines all over Newfoundland. Glover supported calls for a cross-island railway.\n\nHis first term ended when he accepted the Leeward Islands' governorship in 1881. He stayed there for two years, leaving to recover from malaria. While recuperating he was asked to return to Newfoundland after Governor Henry Maxse's death. He served in Newfoundland for several months before ill health forced him back to England. He never fully recovered from malaria and died on September 30, 1885 in London. Glover was commemorated in Newfoundland with a monument in the St. John's Anglican Cathedral. Glovertown was also named in his honour."
