[Note now Shrewsbury in Shropshire]\n\n[Entries 85 and 84 in listing] [MR] Charles & Lawrence ADYN [ADIN] I have not so far located an Adyn family in Shropshire at this date so cannot at present see a connection with those in Dorchester.\n\nAccording to David Underdown in 'Fire from Heaven' the family of ADYN had been prominent in Dorchester for over a century in the early 1600's. 'Families like the Adyns occupied civic offices more or less in rotation but took little part in the affairs of the country': William Adyn was MP for Dorchester in 1571. As Country Gentlemen I did not expect to find them being educated at Oxford or Cambridge and they do not appear in the Alumni records. They were Maltsters and the 2nd fire of Dorchester broke out in John Adyn's Malt house on 30 Jan 1623. John died in Dorchester in the summer of 1626. Whilst the Adyn family was well known to the Rev. John White it is unlikely they shared his vision. Robert ADYN for example was a catholic recusant and despite his father & brother holding high civic office he spent most of his life in Dorchester Goal because of his outspoken religious views. MR. ALDEN . Robert Alden one of those who sold their right to the Plymouth Planters in 1626.

His shop was near the East end of St. Peter's Church. Bur. 12 Feb. 1637/8.\n\n[Entry 26 in listing] Matthew BONGER [or BONGIER or BONIOUR] (c1580 - 1637/8 or after 1645?)\n\nVery little is known about Matthew BONGER's life. The earliest record I can locate about him is his marriage to Margery HARDYE in the church of Holy Trinity in Dorchester on 26 Oct 1607 when he would have been married by the newly arrived Rev. John WHITE. The average age for marriage for a male in 17th Century Dorchester was 27 so I have had to assume birth circa 1580. There is an early record which may apply to the 18th year of the Reign of James I [1619/20] which suggests that Matthew Bonger obtained a lease from the burgesses of the town for the term of his natural life for the 'Sheep market' for which he agreed to pay the Mayor and Burgesses £10 per annum.\n\nOn 2nd Nov 1621 he was formally admitted as a member of the Company of Freemen when his occupation was recorded as that of a baker. He also of course invested in the Dorchester Company in 1624. At a special court of the Governor, assistants, and Freemen of the Borough held on 24th day of September 1630 it was agreed that the tradesmen and handicraftsmen of the borough be divided into five companies each of which was to be governed by a warden. One of these was the 'Company of Fishmongers' which despite it's title covered 19 diverse trades one of which was 'bakers' and another the 'butchers'. Matthew Bonger was appointed the first ever warden of the Fishmongers Company and his role was to attend the Governors Court and report all abuses of trading within his area of responsibility by foreigners or freemen. He was clearly therefore of some standingg in the community.\n\nOn 1st June 1632 we also know that he had a servant called William Douche as he gave evidence against a number of townspeople for playing 'nine holes' on the Sabbath day. Rose Troup refers to his burial on 12 Feb 1637/8 but I have yet to confirm this and there is the following entry in the Municipal Records which may suggest otherwise. He did however marry in 1607 so its possible that this is his son who perhaps became a member of the Company of Freemen after 1635 when the records cease.\n\nA feature of the town were the butchers shops (or standings) and shambles situated near the east end of St Peters church which were town property. On 22 July 1640 it was agreed, at the motion of Matthew Bonger, that the sergeants at Mace would on St James day next proclaim in the fair that if the country men will bring in their sheep and cattle on any market days, provision shall be made for penning of the sheep that shall be brought to the market to be sold. There were two rows of butchers shops, east and west, and on 10 June 1645 one in the west row was leased by a Matthew Bonger.\n\nGenealogical Notes:-\n\n[FFH] page 133: Phillimore's Marriage Registers, published in 1909: [MRD] Pages 403, 422, 494, 502, 664, 698: [HACD] p 339 [RT] p451 Note:- A Matthew BANGER was buried at powerstock dorset 1657 see NBI?

As such by law Richard had to be a householder and at least 24 years old so he was born prior to 1595 and later information places this nearer to 1584 or perhaps slightly earlier. In 1624 he was one of the 119 investors in the 'Dorchester Company', and when there were difficulties in 1627 he was one of the main supporters with John White to reform the company. In the Survey of ships belonging to Weymouth his name appears as Richard BERRY as the owner of the 'Fellowship' the first of the ships bought by the Dorchester Company. Between 1619 and 1633 the municipal records show that he took on five apprentices in all, the fourth being a William White the son of a widow Anne on 25 June 1632.\n\nNote:- William White (1617-aft 1684) was the nephew of Rev John White by his elder brother Josias who died in 1622/3 leaving 4 children, the third son being called William. Although his widow Anne remarried to a Francis Drake in Surrey he also died on 17 March 1633 and like many others in the White family Anne moved to live in Dorchester close to the patriarch and her son. We know her son William became a merchant trading in Dorchester and married Dorothy one of Richard Bury's daughters before removing to live in London.\n\nRichard Bury, a staunch puritan, was first elected Constable of Dorchester for a year on 2 Oct 1626, a post he also held during 1629-30. In 1627 he and another constable Richard Williams were required to press men for Buckingham's ill fated expedition to the Isle of Rhe. On 6 Oct 1628 he was elected Governor of the Company of Freemen filling the role of Assistant Governor the following year and again in 1632-33. As such his name appears in the Charter granted to Dorchester by Charles I which was dated 22nd Sep 1629 where he is listed as one of the original 24 members of the Common Council of Freemen. He was also elected as a Capital Burgess of the town on 2nd January 1632/3 when he took over from John Long who had recently died. He was elected Bailiff of Dorchester on 30 Sep 1633 (and again in 1638 and 1647) and County Treasurer in 1635. He first became Mayor of Dorchester in 1640, being appointed a second time on 4 Oct 1650. Another role he was elected to was that of feoffee of the Dorchester Free School on 24 Mar 1640/1. He lived in a house that he had purchased from a Charles James in 1637 for £190 called 'Foxwell's tenement'. It was situated between houses owned by James Gould a merchant of Dorchester and the widow Elizabeth Cundytt on the east side of South High Street Dorchester.\n\nHe was one of the few that did well very out of the civil war (1642-1651) and an indication of his wealth is given in Charters 691/2 where he leased 'Court farm' in the parish of Buckhorne Weston Dorset for £1,100 and many other lands for 99 years.\n\nHe married a Dorothy and they had at least 3 sons Phineas, John & Thomas BURY and 4 daughters, these being Dorothy the wife of William White; Sarah the wife of Samuel Clarke (who was one of the witnesses of Richard Bury's will); Mary the wife of Samuel Cromleholme and Elizabeth the wife of Michael Watts. Its possible that he had a 4th son Nathaniel as he was admitted to the Company of Freemen in Dorchester on 03 Jan 1632/3 an apothecary apprenticed to his father. nathaniel married in Wiltshire in 1639 but is not listed in Richard Bury's will.\n\nPhineas Bury (1634-1678/9) is recorded as a scholar of Dorchester, presumably of the 'free school' there as his father was feoffee. Phineas was educated at Wadham College Oxford where he matriculated 2 Apr 1652 at the age of 18. Obtaining his BA in 1654, became a Fellow 1656, and received his MA in 1657. He was a sub warden in 1662, proctor 1665, and became Canon of Chester in 1670, and Rector of Southrop Gloucestershire in 1675. He died in London on 28 Jan 1678/9.\n\nJohn Bury (c1636) married Ann Bascombe, both described as being from Weymouth, at St Peters Church in Dorchester in August 1657. They had a son Richard Cromleholme Bury who was born on 24th Oct 1664 baptised at St Peters on 8th Nov 1664.\n\nIn 1648 he was made an officer of the new volunteer force & on 15th July marched on Shaftsbury. Municipal Records in Dorchester show that he was elected as an Alderman of the town on 29th October 1652 but was living in London in 1656 and in 1659 was described as being well into his 70's. He wrote his will on 20th March 1660 when he simply gave his residence as London. He died in 1661 his will being proved on 25th October that year. Link to Transcription of his Will. In Dorchester he was replaced as Capital Burgess because he had died on 14 Apr 1662.\n\nSources:-\n\n[FFH] pages 122, 180, 208, 212, 214/5, 217, 223, 233: [HD] page 129: [MRD] : [RT] Pages 93, 101, 263, 457: [WW] pages 85, 99, 106/7, 125, 127, 134, 157,174: Phineas OXA.

From there he went to Dorchester arriving in 1620 to become an assistant to the charismatic Rev. John WHITE the rector of Holy Trinity Church(2) . Through John White he met the Rev. Edward PELE (1582-1643), the vicar of nearby St Georges Church in Fordington and was introduced to the influential PELHAM family. Herbert PELHAM, the head of the family, unfortunately died shortly after his arrival on 21st April 1620 and the following year on 2nd May Edward CLARKE married Anne the daughter of Herbert PELHAM by his second wife Elizabeth(3) . Anne PELHAM had been baptised in Hellingly Sussex 22 Mar 1601/02 before the family moved to Fordington and was a younger sister to Thomas PELHAM listed below(4). She also had a younger sister Elizabeth (Bap Hellingly Sussex 27 apr 1604) that married in Salisbury on 4 Sep 1621 to become the 2nd wife of John HUMPHREY of Chaldon Herring(4) . He was also active in promoting the settlement of New England, where he arrived with his wife in May, 1635 to become Deputy Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nEdward and Anne had three children baptised in Fordington : (1) Elizabeth 10 months after they married on 17 Feb 1621; (2) Anne baptised 23 Nov 1623; and (3) Edward baptised 19 Jun 1625(3) . Both Edward CLARKE and Anne's brother Thomas PELHAM invested in the Dorchester Company and on 3rd March 1623/24 he was one of the 12 members elected to serve under the Govenor Sir Walter Erle on the New England Committee. On Sunday 18th July 1624 Edward baptised Margaret (Margery) the daughter of William WHITEWAY the diarist, another member of the committee.\n\nIn July 1625 he removed his family to Taunton(2) presumably as curate to the church of St Mary Magdalen as he was formally instituted as rector there on 1st April 1628(5) . He was succeeded in his post as assistant to John WHITE by Ferdinando NICHOLLS. Edward CLARKE's death is recorded in William WHITEWAY's Diary as 31st December 1630 which also shows that his wife died on 17th of the same month.(6) Genealogical Notes:-\n\n(1) [OXA] : (2) [WW Pages 61, 64, 75, 114, 129, 174]: (3) Bishops Transcripts Fordington: (4) DV & DV2 Pelham pages 53/54: (5) [CCED] (6) [PRO] Will of Edward Clarke, Clerk, Vicar of Taunton, Somerset; Probate date 18 Apr 1631; Name of Register: St. John Quire Numbers: 1 - 68 Ref PROB 11/159 (7) FFH Pages 63,258,453.\n\nROBERT COKER - [Goldsmith] Son of Thomas Coker of Dorchester; born c1579. Bur. (St Peter's) 4 Jan 1654/5 [Source Rev.RG Bartelot] He or his son must have been the goldsmith from whom captain Sydenham \"borrowed\" plate in his raid on Dorchester 1644 [Page 313]\n\n(Entry 17 in listing) Robert COKER (1579-1654/5) of Ashbosam was a goldsmith by trade and like his father lived in Dorchester. His grandparents were Thomas COKER of Ashbosom and Alice the daughter of Peter STANTER of Hornesham in Wiltshire. His father, their fifth son, was also named Thomas COKER and his mother Joane (nee HALLETT).\n\nThis family should not be confused with the Coker's of Mappowder many of which went to university, and may well have been related. See the 1677 Visitation of Dorset pages 14/15 for their pedigree - in particular Robert Coker of mappowder who died 24 Feb 1625 and is mentioned in William Whiteways diary.\n\nRobert COKER married into the Chubb family (circa 1603) when he wed Martha the daughter of William CHUBB of Frome Selwood in Somerset. According to the 1623 Visitation of Dorset they had seven children:- (1) Mathew 1604; (2) Robert 1607;(3) Margaret 1609 who married William PATY 6 Oct 1628; (4) Joane 1612; (5) John 1618; (6) William 1620; and (7) Martha in 1622. Robert became a close friend to another goldsmith Matthew CHUBB (the elder) who was bailiff of Dorchester 1593, 1602 and in 1610. Matthew was authorised by the King on 12 Nov 1613 to advance £1,000 for the rebuilding of Dorchester after the great fire that year. The richest man in Dorchester he rebuilt the George Inn and with his wife Margaret endowed an almshouse for women. Matthew died in 1617. By the time his widow Margaret CHUBB died in 1628 her only son and heir Matthew CHUBB junior was still under age (who William Whiteway in his diary refers to as a 'little boy') so she left in her will dated 18 April 1625 all her lands and goods to Robert COKER on the condition that his 2nd daughter Joan COKER married her son. This clearly happened as Charter 636 (item 9) refers to Joane CHUBB the widow of Matthew CHUBB conveying the premises back to her parents on 23 Jan 1633.\n\nThe municipal records show that one month before the great fire of Dorchester (1613), which burnt down half the town, Robert COKER took on an apprentice Jasper ARNOLD for 10 years.

Died 5 idus Feb.1666 aet 78 (Tomb) [Source Rev RG Bartelot] , bur 14 Feb. 1666, Trinity Church, Dorchester.\n\n[Entry 8 in listing] Edmond [Edmund] DASHWOOD (1588-1643) (1) Baptised 6th July 1588, the son of John Dashwood of West Stafford Dorset(2), a mercer by trade; a puritan sympathiser and friend of the Rev John White. David Underdown places him in Dorchester as early as 1599(7). He married Thomasine the daughter of John HENNING Esq of Poxwell by his wife Dorothy Wareham. John Henning was High Sherrif of Dorset in 1610(9). Edmund is recorded as a witness on Charters in Dorchester in 1611 and was elected a Capital Burgess on 29th Sep1620 (3) also serving as Bailiff of Dorchester in 1619/20; 1625; 1633; 1636; 1639;1641(5). The Charter signed by Charles I on 22nd September 1629 names him as one of the first Aldermen of the City. He was also appointed Mayor of Dorchester on 1st October 1632(2b) and became an active supporter of John Whites schemes for example contributing towards the cost of the Hospital. The family traded with France as apart from being a mercer his son Francis Dashwood followed his fathers trade and married a french woman in Caen on 27th July 1634 (although William Whiteway does not record her name). A Thomas Dashwood recorded as landing at Rye from France and being on his way to Dorchester in 1636(6) is likely to be another of his sons involved in the family business. His name appears on the petty customs records for the port of Weymouth in 1637 as does that of his father. Edmund himself was named by John White as one of the original 119 investors in the Dorchester Company (formed in 1624) and cited with others in the court case which came to trial in 1636(2) He died in 1643 and left £50 from which the interest was to be distributed annually to the poor.(8)\n\nEdward DASHWOOD (d1666/7)\n\nProbably a third (and possibly eldest) son of Edmond Dashwood above. He was elected Constable of Dorchester 6th Oct 1623 and reconfirmed in the post for another term on 4th Oct 1624(4). A clothier by trade he was also named in Charles I's Charter of 1629 as one of the first 24 members of the Common council of Freemen of Dorchester. Business prospered with him taking on an apprentice in 1631 and being elected as one of the feoffees of All Saints in 1633, the year he was elected Governor of the Company of Freemen. He also acted as Assistant to the Governor in 1629-30 and 1634-5. With this background it is understandable that when Sir Francis Ashley died he replaced him as a Capital Burgess of Dorchester (on 4th May 1636) . He was an ensign in the parliamentary forces of the borough in 1643 and held the tenure of a property on the north side of High East street in 1646 when Richard Bury acquired the tenure of the property next to him. The following year he married Joane HYATT in West Stafford on 3rd Feb 1647/8(7). He was elected Bailiff of Dorchester 1649/50; 1651/2 and 1658/9(5) and first became its Mayor when the incumbent John Allambridge died in 1642. He was returned the following year and twice more in 1653 and 1662. He was buried at Holy Trinity church Dorchester on 14th February 1666/7 and his will proved 20th May 1667. From the way his will is written his daughter Sara Somers nee Dashwood may have been from an earlier marriage. His wife Joane was buried at Holy Trinity on 24th March 1675/6 and her will proved 10 May 1676. See also Memorials for HT Church.

He clearly became an important member of the Corporation in Dorchester as evidenced by a deed relating to a plot of land commonly known as 'East Walls Town Land' which survives in the Municipal Records of Dorchester. This is dated the 13th November in the 39th year of the reign of Elizabeth I (1596) and refers to a plot on the east side of South Street and provides for John Watts and William GOLSEY who in order to repay a debt of £150 to Mathew CHUBB the richest man in Dorchester (who often financed the towns development) enclosed, divided and sold off strips of this arable land to five individuals, retaining some portion for themselves.\n\nHis Will suggests that he was only survived by his widow Anne and a young son also called William GOLSEY, whose education and religious instruction was committed under the will to Robert CHEEKE the Master of the Free School in Dorchester (where he served until 1627). Robert Cheeke was a great puritan, friend and supporter of Rev John White and one of the main architects behind the formation of the Dorchester Company so its not suprising to find one of his earlier students investing in the company. William Golsney the son, after instruction by Robert Cheek, went onto Brasenose College in Oxford where he matriculated in 1616 and was awarded a BA degree in 1620. The entry on the left gives RG Bartelot as the source. He was a great historian and genealogist and his extensive records are at the Dorset History centre to which I do not have access. He attributes him to Holnest a small parish 5 miles south east of Sherborne. Certainly there was a family there by that name in the 1640's but it would be necessary to consult his notes at the DHC for more background. He was one of 4 witnesses in Dorchester to an indenture dated 22nd July 1625 (See Charter 712). According to William Whiteways diary William GOLSNEY was appointed undersheriff for the year at least twice. Firstly on 4th Oct 1624 and secondly on 4th Oct 1627. The Undersherrif for Dorset appointed for the year on 6 Oct 1629 was Robert Goldsborough & on 4 Oct 1630 Henry Arnold Junior so the reference to 1630 does not seem to be correct.\n\nSources:- HACD; MRD; OXA; PCC Wills PROB 11/111; WW\n\nEDWARD GOULD of Staverton, Devon.

His elder brother John Gould was heir to his fathers estate who by 1620 had married Sarah the daughter of Eatrey of Colhay in Devon and had a daughter Joane. James GOULD was baptised in St Peters Church Dorchester on 21st July 1593 (Source RG Bartelot) and was followed by a sister Joane who eventually married the wealthy woolen draper Dennis Bond (1588-1648) also an MP who became Mayor of Dorchester in 1635 and was another investor in the Dorchester Company. James was also the nephew of Thomazine GOULD (d1613) the wife of William WHITEWAY (1532-1614) of Denburie in Devon whose grandson William WHITEWAY (1599-1635) was the famous diarist. Both the diarist and his father William WHITEWAY (1570-1639) also invested in the Dorchester Company.\n\nJames Gould a clothier by trade was elected to serve as assistant governor of the Company of Freemen in Dorchester on 30 Oct 1622 and Alderman of the town on 26 Dec 1623. When they formed the 'New England Parliament' on 24 Mar 1624 he and William Whiteway the diarist were two of the 12 members elected to sit on the committee. He married Margery the daughter of George SAVAGE Esq in her home parish of Bloxworth on 28 Apr 1624. There was a dowry of £500 and he brought her to Dorchester to live the following day. In July she was godmother to William Whiteway the diarist's daughter Margery who was named after her. On the 1st Oct 1627 James was elected Bailiff of Dorchester and on 24th February following became godfather to the diarists son John Whiteway. By a new Charter issued to Dorchester by Charles I on 22 Dec 1630 he was listed as one of the Capital burgess of the town and its 1st Alderman under the new charter. On the 30th December 1633 he was one of the 3 main traders to suffer substantial losses when the 'Mary of Morlaix' which was laden with '120 fardles of derbys' destined for Dorchester ran aground and broke up on Portland beach.\n\nIn 1636 he was elected Treasurer of Dorset's Western Divison, a task he does not seem to have been very diligent at, as the court had to order production of the accounts by mid summer 1637. It did him no harm however as he was elected Mayor of Dorchester that year. A benefactor of the town he was a Royalist during the Civil War and removed as burgess. At times he lived in France. He was buried at St Peters Church in Dorchester on 15th Feb 1675/6 and his will proved on 10 May 1676. He had a son James:-\n\nJames GOULD (1624-1707) The History of Parliament States 'He was elected an Alderman of Dorchester in 1676, and became its Mayor 1677-78 and a second time 1696/97. He was Sheriff of Dorset 1687-88 and Freeman of Poole in 1689. The Goulds had a strong local interest in Dorchester, and James followed his father as Member for the Borough but took little part in proceedings in the House. Returned for Dorchester again in 1690 he was classed as a Whig by Lord Carmarthen (Sir Thomas Osborne) in a list of the new Parliament. His activities in this session cannot be distinguished from those of his cousin Nicholas and in any case both were inactive Members. He was listed by Carmarthen in December 1690 as a probable supporter in case of an attack against him in the Commons by Robert Harley as a Country supporter in April 1691, and by Grascombe as a placeman in 1693. The death of his cousin in 1691 allows him to be more easily identified in the Journals. He did not stand after 1695, and was buried at St Peters Dorchester 11th Aug 1707. His only daughter married first Charles Churchill brother of the Duke of Marlborough (John Churchill) and secondly the 2nd Earl of Abingdon (Montague Venables-Bertie) (4) Sources:- (1) HACD John Hutchins (2) MRD (3) History of Parliament The House of Commons 1690-1715 Cambridge Press (4) DV2 page 132 (5) WW 13 ref to him page 56 says aged 30 in 1624, incs pedigree of William Whiteway page 170/1 (6) OPC Marriage 1624 (7) PRO John Gould of Satverton Devon proved 28 Mar 1606 Ref 11/107; John Gould of Dorchester Merchant proved 10 Nov 1630 Ref 11/158.

His father was one of the original 15 Burgesses of the town named by Charles I in the charter signed 26 June 1610. When his father died in 1614 he left John White a gold posy ring and 40 shillings towards the 're-edification of his house' which had just been destroyed in the great fire. Its not suprising therefore to find Giles as an investor in the Dorchester Co. Gile's sister Sarah Green married another succesful merchant in Dorchester called Thomas Davidge who also died in 1614 by which time he left Sarah a widow with 4 children. She re-married to John Hill the Mayor of Dorchester.\n\nGiles lived at Afflington within the parish of Corfe Castle on the Isle of Purbeck and married Elizabeth Hill of Poundsford Park in Somerset. They had a daughter Sarah who married John Bland of London as she named her son Giles Bland after her father (bap St Olave Hart St Ldn. 26 Oct 1647). Giles Green was MP for Weymouth & Melcombe Regis 1621, 1626 and Corfe Castle 1625,1628. The Visitation of Dorset in 1623 however disclaimed him at Dorchester where he is listed as having \"usurped the name of Gentleman without authoritie\". According to William Whiteway's diary he moved to Dorchester to live 24 Sep 1634 because of his own and his wife's sickliness. He became Receiver of Yorkshire, and from 1645 was a Commissioner of the Navy. However, in December 1648 Green was one of the MPs excluded from Parliament in Pride's Purge. His son later became clerk of the New River Company and his daughter, Katherine, married another Dorset MP, Roger Hill, in 1635. He died at Motcombe leaving a Will which was proved on 20 May 1656. A Giles Green was also buried at Melcombe Regis on 20 Aug 1662 which may be his son.

The source for the original information shown left and recorded by Rose Troup in her biography of Rev John White is given as being from the genealogist Rev R.G.BARTELOT (1868-1947) the Rector of St Georges Church in Fordington. His research papers were deposited at the Dorset History Center to which I do not have access so it may be possible to get confirmation of his sources at the DHC. My own research brings into question some of the information he provided. He gave Humphrey's birth year as 1583. The Oxford Alumni however refers to a Humphrey Jolliffe from Dorset, a plebeian, who matriculated at Magdalen Hall Oxford on 7th February 1588/9 at the age of 13. Given that he became an attorney of some standing in the community it is likely that he had a university education and there are no other applicable entries at Oxford or Cambridge and thge name is unusual so I have used this source to estimate his actual year of birth as 1575/6.\n\nThe average age at which men married in Dorchester was around the age of 26 but I cannot locate evidence of Humphrey being in Dorchester prior to the great fire of 1613. In his book Fire from Heaven David Underdown refers to \"John Watts, hitherto a prosperous merchant and member of the Corporation was 'much impoverished' by the fire and his house behind South Street, adjoining the Antelope yard or backside was in ruin for 2 years before he eventually sold it to a lawyer named Humphrey JOLIFFE. Jollife claims to have spent the improbable sum of £1000 on rebuilding it.\" By 1615 Humphrey was clearly a wealthy man and now aged 40 likely to have been married. There is a burial in Holy Trinity Church of an Amy the wife of Humphrey JOILIFFE being buried there on 2nd April 1624, but no direct evidence of children.\n\nRGB (see left) also states that he married 'Christian' the daughter of John FRY but gives no background. There is indeed an entry in the registers for the parish of Cattistock on 11th January 1626 of a Humphrey JOYLIFFE a gentleman from the parish of Dorchester marrying a Christian FFOY [not FRY] and this appears to be the entry that RGB is referring to as Christian is brought to Dorchester and they raise a family of 9 children in Holy Trinity parish between 1628 and 1641.\n\nThere is no doubt that Humphrey JOLIFFE was an active and well respected lawyer regularly used by members of the Corporation and to aid research I have listed below references to him that I have located in various surviving documentation.\n\n(1).

His father Marshall Maber married his mother Marie MITCHELL in St Mary's church in Charminster Dorset on 17 Nov 1577. He had an older brother William (1580) and two sisters Mary (1583) and Elizabeth (1585). A clothier by trade the Municipal Records show that he took on 4 apprentices in Dorchester (in 1623, 1629, 1631 and 1634) for 8 or 9 year terms to help in his business and learn the trade. He was elected constable of Dorchester on 2nd Oct 1626 and again the following year. He was appointed under the Charter of Charles I issued on 22 Sep 1629 as one of the original 24 members of the Common Council of Freemen and re-elected, in 1630 and 1633. He was also elected receiver of the company of Freemen in 1629 and Governor 1632-33. In 1629, whilst still a constable of Dorchester, he was accused of poaching by a local gentleman called John Williams the heir to the Herringstone estate and keeper of the King's game for the Royal Manor of Fordington. John Williams had himself stabbed a tapster to death at the George in 1623 but Maber was duly summoned to Whitehall. No formal complaint was made however so he returned home.\n\nHis father, also a clothier by trade was admitted Freemen of Dorchester 26 July 1632.

John WHITE (1574/5-1648) matriculating at New College Oxford on 31st Oct 1606 at the impressionable age of 19. John White had probably only just left Oxford when Matthias arrived, leaving behind him a considerable reputation at the university as a charismatic puritan preacher. Matthias was awarded a Bachelor of Canon Law on 5 May 1614 and must have been befriended by the Patriarch's father (also John WHITE 1550-1618), as he was a witness to his will which was written at Staunton St John on 30 Sep 1616. It is not surprising therefore to find him following in the patriarch's footsteps receiving a licence to preach in 1619 and being presented to the living at Mells in Somerset on 14th January 1620 after the death of the previous rector William HILL. He did not stay long however as a new rector Henry Ancketill was appointed on 27 Feb 1621 shortly before Matthias was awarded his Bachelor of Divinity on 11 July 1621. He then, according to his will, seems to have become a \"Preacher of God's word\" in Plymouth Devon.\n\nHe married a Martha and is said to have had the following children all baptised in St Andrews church Plymouth John (bap 20 Mar 1621 -bur 14 Sep 1631) Joanna (bap 24 Sep 1623); Matthias (bap 29 Mar 1626); Samuel (bap 17 Jul 1628) and Hanna (bap 15 Dec 1631). Matthias remained throughout in close contact with John WHITE supporting his schemes for emigration and becoming one of the 119 investors in the Dorchester Company in 1624.\n\nHis younger brother Ferdinando NICHOLLS (1598-1662) became assistant to Rev. John WHITE from 1625 to August 1627 and according to Rose Troup in her book on John WHITE, Ferdinando 'advanced to a form of Puritanism of a more violent character'.\n\nIn March 1630 Matthias greeted passengers of the \"Mary & John\" (the ship chartered by John WHITE) just before they set sail for New England. They assembled together with John WHITE in Plymouth for a farewell service in the \"New Hospital\", evidently known as the Hospital of the Poor Portion, a recently founded Puritan institution on the lines of the Hospital in Dorchester, a place for 'setting children to work' and for 'aged people to inhabit'.\n\nMatthias died in Plymouth on 15 July 1631 leaving a Will which was proved on 10 October that year in which he left money to puritan charitable institutions in Plymouth and £13 'unto the common stock for New England, towards the advancement of that plantation'. On 12th April 1634 his widow Martha was another of those that settled in Dorchester seeking the comfort and protection of John White.\n\nGenealogical Notes:-\n\nSources: CCED; CLDS members entry: OXA; PRO Ref Prob 11/160: RT23,199 411,453; WW 117,143,180; EDWARD PELE - Of Compton Valence.
