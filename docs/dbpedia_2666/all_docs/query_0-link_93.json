        "text": "North Central Idaho Stage Lines\n\n(part 3) Buffalo Hump, Idaho County\n\nMap of Area covered\n\nLink to larger size\n\nsource: “Mineral Resources of the Gospel-Hump Wilderness, Idaho County, Idaho”\n\nU.S. Geological Survey Bulletin # 1812 1990\n\nBy Karen Lund, U.S. Geological Survey and Leon E. Esparza, U.S. Bureau of Mines\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nBuffalo Hump\n\nThe discovery of rich quartz at Buffalo Hump in August 1898 created an immediate need for adequate transportation routes. Miners and suppliers had the choice of a few pack trails for reaching the area, but a passable wagon road wasn’t forth coming until 1900. The inaccessibility of the district and long winters hindered the growth of the area and the efforts of stage companies to adequately service the various mining communities.\n\nBuffalo, Callender, Concord, Hump, and Laketown at one time competed for the business of the miners. A telephone service was extended into the area in 1903 and proved a valuable link to outside communities. The long winters made it difficult for supplies and mails to reach the district, and more than a few miners found themselves running short of supplies every spring.\n\nIn the winter and early spring packers and mail carriers found it necessary to equip their horses with snowshoes in order to reach the camps. The horse snowshoe was made eight inches in diameter and circular in form by placing two-inch boards with the grain at right angles, which increased its strength. Tenents were cut in the top surface, into which calks were fitted. Bolts then passed through the boards on each side of the hind calks to which a strap was connected that passed over the front of the hoof. The strap could be tightened by means of nuts on the under side. The Free Press noted: “When first these snowshoes are put on it is an amazing sight to watch the maneuvers of the horse; it takes some little time for him to get used to them. But it is surprising to note the effect it has on the ordinary animal. He walks along with as much confidence as the average Norwegian would on his skees, and really lifts his foot to have it put on, seeming to understand the necessity of their existence. With these shoes good loads can be packed over quite soft snow.”\n\n(January 2, 1902, p. 2, c. 1)\n\nIn February 1899 the Genesee News reported: “Dick Ruddy plans to put in an extensive stage line this summer. He says it is all nonsense for people to rush in before May as the mountains are covered with 6 or 8 feet of snow.”\n\n(Idaho County Free Press, February 24, 1899, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nFrank Coston, owner of the Grangeville-to-Florence stage lines, started a line to the Hump in July 1899. His stage made tri-weekly trips and took a day and a half each way. “The first day, starting from the general stage office at the Jersey House [Grangeville] at 5 a.m., Slate Creek is reached about 3 p.m. transfer of passengers and baggage is made to horses and a short ride of 8 ½ miles brings both to Kunz’s station on Wind river. Express and baggage are carried for 7 c a pound and passengers for $10 single and $18 round trip.”\n\n(Ibid., July 21, 1899, p. 2, c. 6)\n\nThe Free Press on February 3, 1899 (p. 3, c. 2) made note of the new stations being built along the route, “The Florence-Buffalo Hump trail will soon be supplied with plenty of stopping places. Chris. Arnold, Frank Kunz and Henry Ruff are putting up cabins at the foot of Umbrella butte, and Tom Hopwood has established a camp at Anchor Meadows.”\n\nA regular mail service was granted on December 1 when the postal department created route 70,283 between Florence and Buffalo. The mail left Florence on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 6 a.m. and arrived in Buffalo the same days at 6 p.m. The return mail left Buffalo on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 6 a.m. and arrived in Florence the same days at 6 p.m. Mail service between the two points had previously been a special, operated by Frank Coston. Stages were not utilized on the route until a year later when a wagon road was opened. Mail and passengers reached the Hump country by saddle horses until that time.\n\n(Ibid., November 10, 1899, p. 5, c. 2)\n\nIn January 1900 the mail contract was let for $900 a year but the contractor made no effort to fulfill his obligation and the service was relet.\n\n(Ibid., January 12, 1900, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nBy March tri-weekly service was once again available for the residents in the Hump country. However, it was not a direct service as the mail went first to Florence, and Hump residents soon began petitioning for direct delivery.\n\n(Ibid., March 30, 1900, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nBy June the people of Stuart (Kooskia) had raised enough funds by subscription to start an independent tri-weekly stage line between Stuart and Buffalo Hump by way of Clearwater, Harpster, Newsome, and Elk City.\n\n(Lewiston Tribune, June 28, 1900, p. 3, c. 2)\n\nBen Dowell of Stuart, became the proprietor of the line and in July ran his stages by way of Elk City and the Badger mine to Buffalo Hump. Until the completion of the road into Buffalo Hump, the Badger mine remained the terminus of the line. The fare between Stuart and the Badger mine was six dollars, one way.\n\n(Idaho County Free Press, July 6, 1900, p. 3, c. 3)\n\nIn August the Free Press noted: “A tri-weekly stage will begin running Monday [September 3] from Stites, the present terminus of the Clearwater Short Line to Callender, the Charles Sweeney syndicate town at Buffalo Hump. The Idaho, Nevada and California Stage Co. will operate the new line. The company now has six day service between Grangeville and Stites using six-horse Concord stages. They also have a daily service from Grangeville to Florence, a saddle horse line three times a week between Adams Camp and Buffalo Hump and a tri-weekly between Grangeville and Elk City.”\n\n(Lewiston Tribune, August 29, 1900, p. 3, c. 5)\n\nBy the following month two lines were running into Buffalo Hump, one by way of Elk City and the other from Grangeville. On the latter route, the stage went as far as Moore’s and from there saddle horses were used the rest of the way. Stages, though, were able to reach Callender by way of Elk City over the recently completed wagon road constructed by Charles Sweeney, the main Buffalo Hump promoter.\n\n(Idaho County Free Press, September 22, 1900, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nOn October 15 the first wheeled vehicle arrived in Hump over the just-completed Grangeville and Buffalo Hump road.\n\n(Ibid., October 19, 1900, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nIn August 1902 tri-weekly service was still available; the stage left Grangeville on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 6 a.m. and arrived in Buffalo Hump the next day.\n\n(Ibid., August 7, 1902, p. 3, c. 3)\n\nOn Saturday, September 5, 1903, the stage was robbed at Moore’s Station while the driver and passengers were at dinner. The house was about one hundred yards from the barn, and when the driver returned to the coach, he found the registered mail pouch cut open and the contents missing.\n\n(Ibid., September 10, 1903, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nBy the spring of 1900 J. C. Moore was operating his station, which was located halfway between Adams Camp and Buffalo Hump.\n\n(Ibid., May 18, 1900, p. 3, c. 3)\n\nAfter the excitement of the robbery subsided, Moore put his teams back to work procuring an extra supply of hay and grain to meet the heavy demands of travelers during the winter season, when horse feed was scarce.\n\n(Ibid., October 29, 1903, p. 4, c. 3)\n\nIn December Moore found it necessary to temporarily vacate his station on account of ill health. He spent a few months in Missouri and then returned to his place in April 1904.\n\n(Ibid., December 17, 1903, p. 4, c. 4; April 14, 1904, p. 4, c. 1)\n\nIn September 1904 J. F. Ruckman, of Stites, leased the stage route between Adams Camp and the Hump from the California, Idaho, and Nevada Stage Company, which continued to provide stage service between Grangeville and Adams Camp.\n\n(Ibid., September 1, 1904, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nIn the spring of 1906 the mail contract between Elk City and Concord via Orogrande was awarded to U. G. Kinkaid of Elk City. The contract took effect on July 1, and after that date the route between Adams Camp and the Hump was discontinued.\n\n(Ibid., April 26, 1906, p. 4, c. 2)\n\nThe initial rush into the Hump area provided some excitement for a few years, but as the value of the ore diminished miners began looking elsewhere for new bonanzas. Hump miners came to realize that it was impossible to make any profits with low-grade ores and high transportation costs. A few miners stuck it out until around 1920, but the majority left before 1910. The district eventually produced about $540,000, but not much of this figure can be considered a profit due to the high operating costs.\n\nsource: Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series, Number 143, 1971\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nThe Buffalo Hump\n\nBuffalo Lake and Buffalo Hump\n\nBuffalo Hump, the most prominent of the peaks of the Clearwater Mountains, rises in the center of a triangle formed by the three mining towns of Warren, Elk City and Florence, mining camps which in the 1860’s produced something over $100,000,000 in placer gold. This high mountain peak can be seen to the southeast of St. Gertrude’s Convent, snowcapped much of the year. Buffalo Hump takes its name from a prominent intrusive into the Idaho granite batholith rising to an elevation of 8,926 feet in the form of a recumbent buffalo and is a prominent landmark of the central Idaho region.\n\nSpeaking of the gold discoveries in Idaho during the early 1860’s, James H. Hawley stated:\n\nOf the thousands who came into the new camp of Florence during the summer of 1862, nearly all stopped for a short time at least. The limited area of place [sic] ground, however, in that vicinity, soon became apparent and prospecting parties started in all directions. As usual in all mining camps the unfounded reports of rich discoveries soon became circulated among those remaining in the camp, and it was early in the summer of 1862 that a rumor became current there that rich mines had been discovered at the base of the mountain known as Buffalo Hump, a well known mountain, situated about forty miles northeast of Florence, and to the new El Dorado went practically all of those who had come into the new section; they packed their scant amount of provisions and blankets on their backs and started for the new El Dorado, but only disappointments awaited them there, as they soon ascertained. There was no placer gold and the gold-bearing ledges cropping out in many places were of a low grade and could not be profitably worked at that time.\n\n(“History of Idaho, Vol. I, 1920)\n\nSome years later, Buffalo Hump mines began to prosper in 1898.\n\nNo one had any idea of the enthusiasm that the Buffalo Hump strike has aroused. It is all and even more than the locators claimed for it. The assays run to phenomenal values and none of the returns have been low. The strike itself is one of the most phenomenal geological freaks ever discovered. It consists of a huge vein of ore thrown up on the face of the plain and for five miles one can ride along beside it on horseback. In its course the vein runs straight through the Salmon River.\n\nFor two weeks past men have been flocking from all directions to the camp. At night the camp fires resemble those of an army; for miles around they leap heavenward. More than two hundred prospectors were living in tents along the vein when I left Grangeville. Florence and the other camps are almost depopulated; men threw up good jobs to get to the strike; you meet them on foot, huge packs on their backs; on horseback, two men on a horse . . . all with but one thought — to stake out a claim before all are gone.\n\nFor years trained and veteran prospectors camped beside it, and climbed over and around to get into the renowned diggings in Boise Basin, in the Florence district, in the northern counties, into the Seven Devils country and to dozens of other localities long since forgotten.\n\nFrom “Illustrated History of North Idaho,” quoting a man named Attorney Nash.\n\nsource: Idaho County GenWeb – ©pbc 2004-Present – Keeping Genealogy Free\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nPost Offices:\n\nBUFFALO\n\nEstablished\n\nApril 4, 1899 Richard Henley\n\nDiscontinued\n\nNovember 15, 1900 Mail to Hump\n\nApproximately 60 miles S.E. of Grangeville\n\n—\n\nHUMP\n\nEstablished\n\nNovember 23, 1899 Frank Brown\n\nJanuary 3, 1901 Boyd Phelps Quivery\n\nOctober 23, 1901 Albert Sifton Jr.\n\nNovember 29, 1902 D.

Oftentimes sleds and toboggans were pulled by horses that were fitted with snowshoes. Rawhiding was another method used to transport supplies over snow. Supplies were wrapped in a green cow, elk, or deer hide and dragged over the deep snow. The rawhide was pulled by man or horse equipped with special snowshoes.\n\nA packstring pulling a toboggan on the Elk City Wagon Road, circa 1929.

Esparza, U.S. Bureau of Mines\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nGrangeville – Elk City\n\nMiners rushed to Elk City in 1861 when news of a rich strike became known. Express lines and pack trains soon serviced the district and continued in operation until the completion of a wagon road in 1895. Trails and roads into the district often became impassable for wheeled vehicles and horses during the winter and early spring, and mail delivery was made by the determined efforts of hardy men who traveled over the snow-covered trails on snowshoes. Residents found it necessary to purchase enough staples in the fall to last until supplies could reach the community in the spring. The growth of the area experienced peaks and valleys, but the population remained constant enough to warrant regular stage and mail service for many years.\n\nIn December 1888 Elk City received a regular mail service when A. T. Reynolds was granted a government contract. He began service around the 21st and made the trip between Clearwater and Elk City once a week.\n\n(Idaho County Free Press, December 14, 1888, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nIn the spring of 1893 the Free Press noted: “Ezra Baird has joined with Felix Warren to establish a stage line and saddle train between Grangeville and Elk City. From Grangeville, passengers will take the stage to Silverwood’s across Clearwater, and from thence by saddle train into Elk City. They have eight horses at Silverwood’s and will make their first trip as soon as the trail is passable for horses. They will extend the stage line into Elk City when the wagon road is completed. Frank Coston is in charge of the line and head quarters have been established in Grangeville.”\n\n(May 12, 1893, p. 4, c. 1)\n\nOn May 20 Frank Coston reached Elk City with the mail, and his arrival was heralded as the earliest that anyone had brought horses over the trail.\n\n(Ibid., May 26, 1893, p. 4, c. 2)\n\nThelbert Wall refuted Coston’s feat in a letter to the editor of the Free Press on June 9, 1863 (p. 1, c. 6). He claimed that he had crossed the mountains to Newsome Creek on April 26, 1893, with a pack train loaded with 200 to 250 pounds of freight and a five-gallon keg of whiskey. Woodtick Williams went one better than Wall when he wrote that he came over the stated trail he had 120 white mules loaded with flour, 102 black mules loaded with whiskey, and 85 Cleveland bay mules loaded with general merchandise. He further claimed that all the old-timers would remember him and vouch for his veracity.\n\n(Ibid., July 7, 1893, p. 4, c. 3)\n\nPack trains continued to supply the district until July 1, 1895, when an Elk City correspondent to the Free Press wrote: “Great rejoicing in town. Saturday about noon a party of three men rode in with a cart, coming through by the trail. First buggy in Elk City. Having horse races this afternoon. The cart left Grangeville Tuesday and arrived in Elk City Saturday at noon sharp. The parties owning the rig intend locating here. They are Barney McCabe, Dr. Maynard and L. H. Barrie, from Tekoa, Washington.”\n\n(July 5, 1895, p. 4, c. 3)\n\nIn August stages began to travel over the route and passengers could at last reach Elk City in the comfort of a coach. The stage left Grangeville every Tuesday and Friday at 5 a.m. and arrived in Elk City at 4 p.m. the next day. Travelers spent the night at the stage company’s new station on the summit of Baldy. Fare for the round trip was six dollars and a one-way ticket cost four dollars. Freight charges ran 1 ½ cents per pound.\n\n(Ibid., August 9, 1895, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nTravelers over the new road praised it as one of the very best they have traveled. The maximum grade did not exceed ten per cent and the ascent of Baldy was reported as being so gentle that travelers could trot their teams to the summit without realizing they were climbing a big mountain.\n\n(Ibid., August 29, 1895, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nIn November the Free Press published the winter schedule of the stage company, which ran from December 1 to April 30. “From Grangeville, by Harpster, Clearwater and Elk City, to Raymond, 68 miles and back, twice a week. Leave Grangeville Monday and Thursday at 6 a.m. Arrive at Raymond Wednesday and Saturday by 6 p.m. Leave Elk City Monday and Thursday at 6 a.m. Arrive at Grangeville Wednesday and Saturday by 6 p.m.”\n\n(November 29, 1895, p. 4, c. 3)\n\nIn the spring of 1896 the stage company initiated a tri-weekly service and the stage left Grangeville on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings.\n\n(Ibid., March 20, 1896, p. 1, c. 6)\n\nIn May 1897 Jacob Tippery, the mail contractor, established a way station about five miles west of Baldy Mountain summit. He and his family moved into the new quarters the following month.\n\n(Ibid., May 18, 1897, p. 1, c. 5; July 11, 1897, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nWithin a year, Tippery decided the station was too remote for his family and sold out. He thought it best for his children to be near a school and moved to Grangeville.\n\n(Ibid., May 13, 1898, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nBy February 1899 James and Thomas Surridge ran the Elk City line and reported their operation was doing a land-office business. The increased business prompted the men to purchase a new coach and improve the facilities along the route.\n\n(Ibid., February 3, 1899, p. 2, c. 5)\n\nThe brothers, prior to becoming proprietors of the stage line, laid out the town of Bridgeport on October 1, 1898. In March the Free Press reported: “Surridge Bros. have temporarily raised the rate of fare over their Elk City Stage Line to $7 for the single and $12 for the round trip. The increase will remain in force during the period of bad roads. The snow is getting soft and they have had snow shoes made for their horses in order to keep passenger rigs going as long as possible. They have just completed a new 40 x 60 barn at the new town of Bridgeport.”\n\n(March 17, 1899, p. 4, c. 1)\n\nBy July the California, Idaho and Nevada Stage Company had obtained the mail contract and was preparing to operate a line of stages over the route. The Free Press praised the service provided by the Surridge brothers and remarked that they never missed a trip during the winter months.\n\n(Ibid., July 28, 1899, p. 3, c. 6)\n\nIn June the outfit of the California, Idaho and Nevada Stage Company, running into Elk City, was attached for debt. The problems of the line were attributed to the poor condition of the state road and the inability of the company to use coaches along the route. The roads were in such bad shape that the mail had to be carried into Elk City on horseback.\n\n(Ibid., June 29, 1900, p. 2, c. 1)\n\nRoad conditions improved and the stage company once again regained respectability with its creditors. On August 11, 1902, a daily mail service was inaugurated between Stites and Elk City and the future of the district never looked better.\n\n(Ibid., August 14, 1902, p. 3, c. 3)\n\nIn the fall of 1905 J. C. Yandell, proprietor of the Mountain House, reported business booming due to an increase in traffic along the road.\n\n(Ibid., November 23, 1905, p. 6, c. 2)\n\nThe California, Idaho and Nevada Stage Company continued to run the Elk City route until about 1906. At that time the line became the property of Nathaniel B. Pettibone, one of the founders of Stites. In June 1909 Pettibone sold the line to Alec Clitsome of Spokane for $15,000.\n\n(Ibid., June 3, 1909, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nIn August the Elk City mail route from Grangeville was changed to connect with the stage at Clearwater. “This change will abolish the Grangeville and Stites line. J. W. Wilkes, who had been conducting this line, has the contract for carrying the mail over the new route. The stage now leaves Grangeville daily and connects at Clearwater with the Elk City and Stites stage. The Grangeville stages leave at 5 a.m. each morning except Mondays when the start will be at 10 a.m. Returning leaves Clearwater daily at 4 p.m. except on Tuesday when the departure occurs at 11 a.m.\n\n(Ibid., August 5, 1909, p. 1, c. 1)\n\nIn the fall Clitsome abandoned the line, leaving Elk City without a stage line. He claimed there was too much factionalism among the businessmen of Stites, which made it impossible for him to earn a living. Apparently some would boycott him while others lent their support.\n\n(Ibid., October 28, 1909, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nPettibone soon came to the rescue of Elk City residents and once again took charge of the line. He continued to run the line until selling out to Frank Hye in 1914. In the spring of 1910, L. Williams, owner of the Grangeville-Clearwater stage line, was awarded a four-year contract to carry mail between Grangeville and Clearwater, where connections could be made with the Elk City stage.\n\n(Ibid., May 26, 1910, p. 8, c. 4)\n\nDuring the summer of 1911, John Jack and R. Cote undertook an automobile trip into the upper south fork country. “The trip is a hard one and no doubt the party will have some thrilling experiences before the return to Grangeville. This is the first car to go into the Elk country, the roads to the camp being in such a condition that people have not cared to hazard such a journey.\n\n(Ibid., August 24, 1911, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nIn the spring of 1913 Mrs. I. R. Wisner, wife of the proprietor of the Halfway House, found a gold watch in a sack of flour. The makers of the flour had placed watches in a number of sacks as a promotion to attract buyers.\n\n(Ibid., May 22, 1913, p. 5, c. 3)\n\nIn the fall of 1914 the people of Elk City were stunned upon learning that Frank Hye had shot and killed his wife and Hugh Kennedy, one of his drivers. Hye had suspected that the two had become lovers and returned home early from a trip in an attempt to confirm his suspicions. Upon entering the house, he discovered his wife in bed and Kennedy disrobing. He quickly drew his revolver and shot them both. He then picked up his little girl and took her to a friend’s house. He next searched for the sheriff and turned himself in for the recently committed crime. His trial was held in February and March 1909. The jury found him guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced him to ten years to life. After serving just over two years, he was granted a full pardon in September 1917. He returned briefly to the Elk City area and, after attending to some business matters, left for the state of Washington.\n\n(Ibid., October 8, 1914, p. 1, c. 1-2; trial, February 22, 1915, p. 1, c. 1-4, and March 4, 1915, p. 1, c. 1-4; convicted and sentenced, March 11, 1915, p. 1, c. 1-3; pardoned, September 27, 1917, p. 8, c. 3)\n\nSoon after the arrest of Hye, N. B. Pettibone was placed in charge of the prisoner’s interests and the residents of Elk City continued to receive their mail with out any interruption.\n\n(Ibid., October 15, 1914, p. 8, c. 4)\n\nIn May of 1915 the Stites-to-Elk City mail contract was relet to O. A. “Ole” Johnson and John Phillips for a flat rate of $14,000.\n\n(Ibid., May 13, 1915, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nDuring the same month, Henry Foulks, proprietor of the Switchback Station, returned to his business after a visit to San Francisco.\n\n(Ibid., May 27, 1915, p. 2, c. 4)\n\nIn the fall of 1917 the snow was reported to be six inches deep on the switchback on the road to Elk City. The Free Press noted: “Mr. Johnson last Thursday drove an automobile through the snow from Elk City to Stites.”\n\n(Ibid., November 1, 1917, p. 1, c. 5)\n\nThe introduction by Johnson of a motorized vehicle along the route would soon bring an end to the days of the four-horse stages rolling on the road to Elk City. In the summer of 1918 Phillips and Johnson began operating a motor truck over a portion of the stage route. “They make two trips a day by motor from Stites to Switchback. The truck is used at times to haul passengers and mail to Newsome and Elk City. They recently made a trip to Red River, taking in a number of men to fight forest fires. They have stated that the truck greatly reduced the cost of operating the stage line by eliminating the need for horse feed and care of the animals.”\n\n(Ibid., July 25, 1918, p. 6, c. 4)\n\nIn June 1918 James C. Safely, editor of the Free Press, took a leisurely trip along the route and found the hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Yarbrough at Newsome first class. He reported the structures “Built entirely of logs, the tavern at Newsome and the adjacent buildings are entirely in harmony with the natural scenic beauty which exists here, for we are virtually surrounded by mountains heavily covered with timber. . . .”\n\n(Ibid., June 6, 1918, p. 6, c. 1)\n\nIn the summer of 1919, the stage was upset about five and a half miles west of Elk City when the tongue of the four-horse stage broke. The driver, John Waymire, and a passenger, Mrs. Miller, suffered some injuries but were able to proceed when a replacement arrived.\n\n(Ibid., July 3, 1919, p. 1, c. 4)\n\nThe following summer Ole Johnson announced that motor trucks would be placed on the entire route and the trip would be made in a day instead of a day and a half. He reported “Trucks are now on the line between Stites and Switchback and Newsome and Elk City, but it is necessary because of snow and mud to use horses and wagons between Switchback and Newsome.”\n\n(Ibid., July 1, 1920, p. 1, c. 5-6)\n\nOne-day service became a reality on July 5 when the auto stage arrived in Elk City after leaving Stites earlier in the day.\n\n(Ibid., July 8, 1920, p. 5, c. 3)\n\nOn the 10th O. A. Johnson and William Sutter sold the Stites-to-Elk City line to R. H. Chase and C. L. Fletcher, who intended to continue the operations in the same efficient manner as the previous owners.\n\n(Ibid., July 20, 1920, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nHorses continued to be used when the roads were in bad shape, but for all practical purposes the day of the four-horse stage became only a memory. The introduction of motorized vehicles not only eliminated horse-drawn stages but also created the need for better roads. Miners and residents of the Elk City country had long clamored for the construction of a road up the South Fork of the Clearwater River. They proclaimed a river grade road would be much easier to keep open during the winter months and would also considerably shorten the distance. In September 1909 a trail was completed up the South Fork and many soon called for its expansion into a wagon road.\n\n(Ibid., September 16, 1909, p. 1, c. 1)\n\nIn the summer of 1919 voters of the Grangeville Highway District approved a $50,000 bond for their share in constructing a South Fork road.\n\n(Ibid., July 10, 1919, p. 1, c. 1; August 14, 1919, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nShortly thereafter, W. J. Hall, Commissioner of Public Works reported that the South Fork road would be designated a state highway known as the Elk City Highway. He went on to note that a survey would soon be started and actual construction of the road would follow.\n\n(Ibid., July 24, 1919, p. 1, c. 1; August 14, 1919, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nIn October W. E. Adamson, highway engineer, began work on the final location of the road. There was $185,000 available for the construction: $135,000 from the Forest Service and the $50,000 bond.\n\n(Ibid., October 30, 1919, p. 1, c. 6)\n\nShortly after arriving on the job, Adamson accidentally shot and killed himself and a replacement had to be found.\n\n(Ibid., November 13, 1919, p. 1, c. 5-6)\n\nOn July 20, 1920, a contract for the construction of the first link of the road, an eleven-mile stretch between Rocky Point and Castle Creek Ranger Station, was let to Otto Hanson of Spokane for $187,000. This was $2000 above the allotted amount, but the government agreed to cover the excess.\n\n(Ibid., July 15, 1920, p. 1, c. 1; August 5, 1920, p. 1, c. 3)\n\nIn February 1921 an additional $20,000 was let by the government and the actual cost for construction of the entire forty-eight miles was estimated at $800,000.\n\n(Ibid., February 10, 1921, p. 1, c. 6)\n\nBy 1929 the road had reached Golden and late in 1932 the highway was finally opened all the way to Elk City.\n\n(Sister M.

This extensive plan for road building has been mapped out to complete the good roads system in the national forest reserve and connect such roads up with other roads. A total of 1161 miles of road are to be constructed. Of this number 464 miles are within forest reserves and 697 on the outside.\n\nThe roads to be constructed vary in width from nine feet up to 16 feet on the main state highways. These roads are to be constructed from federal aid and the money derived from the 10 per cent of the grazing receipts.\n\nThe following table gives the list of national forest roads in the order of their importance, which are proposed for construction from the federal aid and 10 per cent appropriations in southern Idaho during the next ten years, in co-operation with the state and various counties concerned, together with certain data on each road;\n\nName of project – Total Estimated Cost\n\nWarm River to Yellowstone … $90,000\n\nNoble to Montana line … 70,000\n\nBanks to Lowman … 94,000\n\nOakley to Rogerson … 45,000\n\nKetchum to Clayton … 500,000\n\nLowman to Stanley … 75,000\n\nHorseshoe Bend to Smith’s Ferry … 135,000\n\nMcCall to Warren … 62,000\n\nSoda Springs to Freedom … 90,000\n\nKnox to Edwardsburg … 60,000\n\nParis to Preston … 30,000\n\nBoise to Atlanta … 140,000\n\nOakley to Rogerson … 75,000\n\nClyde to Gilmore … 60,000\n\nMackay to Clyde … 50,000\n\nKetchum to Mackay … 102,000\n\nTotal … $1,633,000\n\nSurveys have been made of portions of the Warm River – Yellowstone, the Noble – Montana line, and the South Fork of the Payette river road projects. Approximately $64,000 has already been spent on the south fork of the Payette river road, and $2000 on the Warren wagon road.\n\nThe minimum widths proposed vary from nine feet on the south fork of the Payette river road to 16 feet on the main state highways, as the Warm River – Yellowstone project. The maximum grade varies from 8 per cent on the laterals to 5 per cent on the main lines.\n\nsource: The Emmett Index.

This would take in the Warrens, Chamberlain Basin, Marshall Lake, Edwardsburg and Thunder mountain sections of Idaho county. As this territory is tributary to New Meadows and other towns south of it and the travel and trade naturally goes in that way it is generally understood there is little if any objection to the slicing off of this section by people in other sections of Idaho county, providing the people in the affected territory desire to go.\n\nsource: Idaho County Free Press.

January 18, 1917, Page 1\n\nThe North And South Highway\n\nScurrilous Resolutions of Caldwell Commercial Club Rouse Ire of Emmett Club – False and Misleading Statements Exposed and True Facts Set Forth\n\nThe resolutions of the Caldwell Commercial Club, opposing the route of the north and south state highway from Boise to New Meadows by way of the Payette river and Long valley, which appeared in Wednesday’s Boise papers, contain statements that are so false and misleading, so evident of a selfish animus behind them that takes no thought of the public’s good, that the Emmett Commercial club deems it its duty to make reply and set forth the true facts.\n\nThe fundamental objects of national and state highways is service to the public, not pleasure seekers; to make accessible the vast timber, mineral and agricultural resources of the states, not to promote the selfish ambitions of any town or community; to open for travel those regions that are not at present provided with rods, thus inducing the investment of capital to develop the resources of the state and attract settlers; to co-operate with the National government in developing the vast timber resources that are now ripe for the factory and the rich mines that are already being developed but lack means of transportation to make them profitable to their owners or to enrich the state. Such a country is that through which it is desired by the advocates of the Payette valley route to construct the southern end of the north and south highway. This route has been signified by the National forest service as preferable to any other because it will more completely accomplish the fundamental objects of national and state highways as set forth above.\n\nIt is 40 miles shorter from Boise and all points east than the Weiser valley route.\n\nIt starts from the center of population of the state and is the only practical north and south road through the central part of the state when the topography of the country is considered.\n\nIt is a route that is a never-ending panorama of scenic beauty, and comfortable for travel either in summer or winter.\n\nThe heaviest construction work on the route lies through the National forests and the Forest Service has signified its willingness to construct this portion of the rod.\n\nIt serves as an outlet for three big road projects which the forest service has approved for construction across central Idaho, which at present contains an area larger than the state of Connecticut and that is without any means of transportation except by pack horse. These projects which have been approved by the Forest service are:\n\nThe McCall – Warrens road to open up the undeveloped timber in the Idaho forest and the rich mineral resources of the Warrens and Marshall Lake districts.\n\nThe Cascade – Knox – Edwardsburg rod to make accessible the timber and grazing resources of the forest and the mineral resources of the Big Creek and Thunder Mountain Districts.\n\nThe Banks – Lowman – Stanley Basin Highway which connects with the Montana State Highway system by way of Gibbonsville and passes trough the beautiful Sawtooth Park country.\n\nThe Weiser route does not form a single connecting link with any other highway and has no feeders.\n\nIt is a direct route to the Payette Lakes, one of Idaho’s most beautiful resorts, and taps the large land holdings of the state around the lakes, comprising 32,000 acres of fine timber lands.\n\nIt possesses no difficult construction or engineering feats as is a natural water grade route from Emmett to Payette Lakes.\n\nInstead of costing some $300,000 more to build than the Weiser route, it can be built cheaper, mile for mile of the same class of road, than the Weiser route. The soil is granite sand, a composition that makes hard, smooth rods at all seasons of the year, and reduces the cost of maintenance, as well as construction, to the minimum. The soil of the Weiser, Price and Meadows valleys is a dobie [sic] and is almost impassable during the wet season; a condition that is expensive during construction and costly to maintain. The best road is the one that is easiest traveled wet or dry, winter or summer.\n\nThe weather records show that neither route has any advantage as regards snow; that the fall is practically the same and remains as long on one route as on the other. There is very little, if any, difference in the altitude.\n\nOne of the uses of these highways is for post roads. That part of the Payette valley route between Boise and Emmett is used daily for mail service between the two points.\n\nThe Caldwell Commercial Club’s resolutions contain false and misleading assertions in that —\n\nThe Payette valley route does not have “steep and difficult grades.”\n\nIt is not “closed for traffic a considerable portion of the year.”\n\nWill not cost any more, and quite probably less, than the Weiser valley route.\n\nIt is true that the Payette valley route is not so thickly populated as the Weiser valley route; but it is not also true that the sparsely settled and undeveloped sections should be favored over those more thickly settled and in full development, especially when, as in this case, the country traversed is so rich in resources that it needs only the means of transportation which this highway will give to unlock the gates that will pour forth a flood of riches that will rival the dreams of a Croesus and be of benefit to the entire state of Idaho? That, we take it, is, or should be, the object of both state and national highways. Sections that already possess good roads and the means to build others – whose resources are already developed – will acquire not a fraction of the benefit to either the individual or the state that those undeveloped and sparsely settled sections will reap when provided with means of transportation though state and government aid. He who is rich needs no financial assistance. He who is well fed needs not the friendly proffer of food.\n\nThe insinuation in the Caldwell article that the route is being advocated for the benefit of certain lumber interests is an appeal to raise the scum of popular prejudice that could only be conceived in the miasma-clouded intellects of such a swamp bred community. The state’ development has long been retarded by such infamous tactics. When the truth is known, the public will probably give the same consideration to this statement as the Caldwell Commercial Club has in the past given to its agreements with neighboring communities.\n\nThe proposition to consider the Boise – Payette Lakes route for the North and South Highway was laid before the first highway commission appointed, by the citizens of Emmett and Long valley before any route had been officially decided upon. This was four years before lumbering operations began on the Payette river on a large scale, and one year before the consolidation of the large lumber interests in southern Idaho. The matter as brought before the commission through the efforts of the Emmett Commercial Club. At that time there was not one timber operation on the membership roll of the club. There never has been a representative of any timber interest to appear before this organization to advocate the project. For every acre of private timber land that will be benefited by the Payette River route the State of Idaho owns one and the National Government one hundred; for ever prospect hole contiguous to the Weiser route there are ten well developed properties that will be given transportation by the Payette route and its feeders, and yet the State Mining Association, at its recent meeting, was deluded into endorsing the Weiser River route.\n\nAll the advocate of the Payette River route have ever asked is that a fair examination and estimate of the cost and benefits to the state be made. This has not been accorded by the Highway Commission. This request was laid before the commission before any route had been selected. The resolution adopting the Weiser River route was passed as soon as the Emmett Committee left the room. Since then repeated efforts have been made to get the Highway Commission to make an official examination of the Payette route. No such examination has ever been made to the knowledge of anyone in this locality. Last autumn the Boise county commissioners succeeded in getting the state highway engineer to go over a portion of the proposed road. The expenses were paid by the county. One member of the state highway committee has always been located at Weiser.\n\nDuring the past four years these high commissioners have expended hundreds of thousands of dollars of state money on highways. All of this has been spent on existing roads connecting thriving communities like Wallace and Coeur d’Alene, Pocatello and Weiser. Almost invariably the roads projected lead to or through the communities in which the members of the commission reside. Not one mile of new road was built by this commission to open up new territory or develop dormant resources of the state. We ask our road committees in the legislature to investigate this assertion and see if it is not true.\n\nDuring the next ten years under the Federal road act Idaho will receive millions of dollars from the National government for the building of roads. Are the people, through their legislature, going to demand that the money be expended to open up transportation facilities to the undeveloped parts of the state, or are they going to let a partisan board continue to use it for their own selfish interests to the detriment of the whole commonwealth?\n\nWe have tried to get a fair consideration of this matter from the highway commission for the benefit of the whole state as much as for our own interests. We have failed to get such consideration from this board. We are now ready to put the matter up to any fair minded nonpartisan committee. If the road committee of our present legislature, or any committee they will appoint, will make a careful personal examination and appraisal of the two routes and these statements and find the facts not as here stated, the Emmett Commercial Club will pay the expenses incurred by this committee.\n\nSigned, Emmett Commercial Club,\n\nBy E.

The last supplies have been sent out and by this time all of the special messengers dispatched early last week should have arrived at their destinations. There are just fifty precincts in Idaho county and to reach some of them requires a journey of several hundred miles, the trip being most hazardous and a portion of it requiring snow shoes. However, Sheriff Yates and Auditor Eimers, realizing the condition, have worked night and day to see that the law would be carried out and now announce all machinery is in place, oiled up and ready for business.\n\nNo Way to Beat the Law\n\nLast week this paper published complete information as to answering the questions which will be asked, etc. and does not feel it is necessary to go into details again. However, one fact should be impressed upon every male inhabitant of Idaho county between the ages of 21 and 30, inclusive and that is this: If you fail to register the penalty for violation is plain as well as severe. A year in prison and then out and into the army. There is just one thing to do and that is go and register like a man. No quibbling and no evasion. Step up and do your duty or suffer the penalty. No local officers, political pull or influence can save you.\n\nWho the Registrars Are\n\nWe publish below a list of the registrars of the various precincts of the county who will be found in most instances at the regular polling places:\n\n[partial list]\n\nWarm Springs – S. E. Gerber\n\nWarren – Geo. L. Patterson\n\nEdwardsburg – W. A. Edwards\n\nJohnson Creek – Albert C. Behne\n\nIn its campaign to stimulate interest in registration the war department has issued a memorandum emphasizing the seven cardinal points to be remembered particularly by men between the ages of 21 and 30 inclusive, who will be required to register. The memorandum follows:\n\n1 – There is only one day for registration – June 5, 1917.\n\n2 – Every male resident of the United States who has reached his 21st and has not reached his 31st birthday must register on the day set, June 5, 1917.\n\nDoesn’t Affect Enlisted Men\n\nThe only exceptions are person is the military or naval service of the United States, which includes all officers and enlisted men of the regular army, the regular army reserve, the officers’ reserve corps, the enlisted reserve corps, the national guard and national guard reserve, recognized by the militia bureau of the war department; the navy, the marine corps, the coast guard and the naval militia, the naval reserve force, the marine corps reserve and the national volunteers, recognized by the navy department.\n\n3 – Registration is distinct from draft. No matter what just claim you have for exemption, you must register.\n\n4 – Registration is a public duty. For those not responsive to the sense of this duty the penalty of imprisonment, not fine, is provided in the draft act.\n\nIllness is no Excuse\n\n5 – Those who through sickness shall be unable to register should cause a representative to apply to the county or city clerk for a copy of the registration card. The clerk will give instructions as to how this card should be filled out. The card should then be mailed by the sick person, or delivered by his agent, to the registrar of his home district. The sick person will enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope for the return to him of his registration certificate.\n\nGet Registration Card\n\n6 – Any person who expects to be absent from his voting precinct on registration day should apply as soon as practicable for a registration card to the county clerk of the county where he may be stopping, or, if he is in a city of over 20,000, to the city clerk. The clerk will record the answers on the card and turn it over to the absentee. The absentee should mail this card to the registrar of his home district so that it will reach that official by registration day. A self-addressed, stamped envelope should be enclosed with the card to insure the return to the absentee of a registration certificate.\n\n7 – Registration booths will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on registration day, June 5, 1917.\n\nsource: Idaho County Free Press.

Eldridge, Edwardsburg From Valley County 1940, Idaho\n\n————–\n\n1917 Valley County Created\n\nIdaho State Historical Society Reference Series Number 342 September 1996\n\nBefore its creation by a legislative act of February 26, 1917, lands that became Valley County had, at one time or another, been included in Alturas (only a very small portion), Boise, Idaho, and Lemhi counties. With a number of mountains and valleys remote from settled areas, much of Valley County’s geography was not understood at all accurately, so some of its antecedent boundaries were rather strange. An early general plan to place Upper Salmon areas (along with Upper Boise drainage) in Alturas County, but assign all Upper Payette streams to Boise County, and Lower Salmon territory to Idaho County, had some exceptions. These lasted until a considerable transfer to Lemhi County affected later Valley County, January 10, 1873. But by January 21, 1885, practically all of Valley County’s later area was in Idaho County. Then Boise County regained its Payette territory, January 15, 1887. That general pattern continued until Valley County came three decades later. A series of four maps, however, is required to indicate those changes following an initial Idaho and Boise County split (44°30′) that Idaho’s legislature retained, February 4, 1864. (An 1885 error in county boundary codification accounts for a statutory transfer of all Boise County’s portion. That blunder doubtless was ignored until it was corrected two years later.) Continued inclusion of remote areas including places like Payette Lake in Boise County after Long Valley was settled and developed, clearly was inappropriate, but reasonable adjustments came slowly.\n\nsource: Publications — 450 N. 4th Street, Boise, ID 83702-\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\n1864 Idaho Territory Map\n\n1895 State of Idaho Map\n\nLink to large size 1895 Map\n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nHistory of Valley County\n\nLink to Valley County Official Website\n\n—————\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (Part 1) 1909-1911\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (Part 2) 1912\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 3) 1913\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (Part 4) Jan-June 1914\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 5) July-Dec 1914\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 6) 1915\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 7) 1916\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 8) 1917\n\nLink to Edwardsburg News (part 9 of 9) 1918-1925\n\nLink to Big Creek / Edwardsburg History Index Page\n\nLink to Valley County Centennial\n\nOffsite:\n\nLink to Metsker Maps Maps of Valley County 1940\n\nLink to Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

The Clover office has no service and mail for that section is being stored at the Edwardsburg office. The Profile contract was advertised in the fall but no contract let, although it is generally believed mail for Edwardsburg will come that way as soon as the wagon road is completed. That would give a much quicker outlet to the camp and be of inestimable benefit.\n\nThe Seattle Co. that has the Hanson-Call Antimony mine under bond has a crew of men getting out ore for shipment to Chicago. This antimony runs sixty per cent and is a paying proposition from the outset.\n\nChas. Mahan and L. L. Rice of Spokane have organized the Ramey Mining Co. and Mr. Mahan has a crew at work driving a long tunnel to tap the ore exposed on the surface. Mr. Mahan is a capable mill man as was demonstrated last summer when he with W. A. Edwardsburg and Theo. Van Meter made a test run on the Sunday mine and shipped concentrates to the Salt Lake smelters.\n\nMitt Haney a well known trapper has caught a genuine black fox and now the Chamberlain country is looking for that kind of fur.\n\nJohn Routson Jr. has killed eleven bear and DAve Lewis will get out in the early spring to see wht he can do in his section. The bear were very plentiful last fall and were killed around many of the ranch houses in the lower Big creek country.\n\nFreeman Nethkin is at work on his ground up Logan creek and the first of Feb. will return to his cattle ranch on Middle Fork.\n\nWilliam Mitchell who has given up mining for ranching spent a few days at Profile the first of the year.\n\nTheodore Van Meter and Crosby Brewer have been at work at the Copper Camp and will be joined by Wm. A. Edwards in a few days. This famous old mine is showing up high grade ore in the Black Bear tunnel and will be a producer yet. Copper continues to soar and this gives renewed hope to the owners of this mine who have, in spite of difficulties continued to develop their property. With the completion of the long tunnel the numerous ore bodies will be tapped and enormous tonnage assured.\n\nThe Edwardsburg wagon rod is in need of repair especially the bridge near the summit. Seven miles of this road were built some years since by William A. Edwards for the Eagle Mining Co. and in one place cuts through forty feet of solid rock. If the county will accept this road and put in in repair or even help to do so the mail contractor will consider putting on an auto truck for the parcel post and the camp will, at least, have good mail service to say nothing of the prospective buyers who would be attracted to this rich section by the easy access this road would furnish. Moneyed men don’t like or will they often take these long, hard trips over the summit but they will consider investing in a section where they are able personally investigate their holdings.\n\nFor the hunter or the fisherman this is paradise and during the run of salmon there could be no more delightful sport than to spear them on the riffles. At the head of Big Creek they spawn, then die and the gardens of this section are enriched by the decaying flesh that is packed on burroughs [sic] for that purpose. When hard head cabbage were in abundance the South Fork gardens were in their infancy and yet there they have almost perpetual summer in comparison to the long, snowy season of the hills. In spite of the deep snow and the hanging icicles there is a touch of spring in the air today and already the dreariness of the winter is forgotten in the thought of the open season when they days are long and the nights all too short for the sleep that comes to us who travel the trail over the hills for work or pleasure.\n\nsource: Idaho County Free Press.

Laufer arrived at Asotin last week from the Big Creek mining district near Edwardsburg in the Salmon river country in the southern part of Idaho county, after an absence of 21 months from Asotin. He reported that there is much activity in the mines in that section and that many important developments will take place during the next year, as rich deposits and prospects are being discovered in several places. He said that the Ramy [sic] Ridge Mining company will put in a smelter and milling plant this year and that Charles Mahan will put in a mill this summer which will employ between 40 and 50 men. He sated:\n\nBoom in Mining\n\n“The Big Creek district is on a creek tributary to the south fork of the Salmon river and is mountainous, having for its principal industries those of stock raising and mining. Mining has taken on a boom lately and such places as Warren’s camp and Marshall Lake are once more presenting the lively appearance of the olden times when the big rush into the Salmon river country for placer claims was at its high tide. Nowadays, there is still a little placer mining done but the larger part by far is the quartz mining.\n\nHas Big Vein\n\n“The value of the ore in this section is variable and I will quote the figures from our own prospect rather than from any other because I have seen and have samples of the ore. The ore for the entire width of the vein, which is 200 feet, with country rock between several layers of quartz, averages $5 to the ton. On spur veins we ran into some ore which was worth $250 per ton and both gold and silver were prominent in it. When a spur vein of this character was opened, we selected chunks of the ore, hammered them into small pieces, put them in sacks and sent them to the smelter to obtain money for a grub stake and running expenses. We had no trouble in opening enough of these spur veins, or grub stakes as we called them to supply us. Our property is called the ‘Way Up Mine,’ as it is high upon the mountain, having an elevation of 8500 feet.\n\nHundred Miles on Skis\n\n“We had a fair winter with no unusual weather. There is 7 feet of snow at the mine and 12 feet 2 or 3 miles away. These depth were the average and are attained every winter, which makes it necessary for everyone to travel on skis or snowshoes. I traveled 100 miles on skiis [sic] when I came out, starting from Edwardsburg and going to the south fork of the Salmon, traveling down it to the Big Salmon and the town of Lucile. I then came to Grangeville, a distance of 40 miles.”\n\nsource: The Wallace Miner. (Wallace, Idaho), 06 April 1916.\n\nChronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.

The contractor on the McCall-Warren line is supposed to carry parcel post all the year round but early in the winter the trails were so blocked by the snow that for one month there was no letter mail from the outside world and there was something of a food famine. B. O Dustan with the exception of one trip when the snow was cracking everywhere and the carrier did not dare risk his life delivered the mail on time. This is a wonderful record and the department should bear in the future. The chief handicap the Edwardsburg office has is in the small limit allowed for the weekly winter mail. Starting with 100 pounds from Warren the carrier delivers about fifty at the terminus of the line. It was intended when the contract was let that Edwardsburg should have one hundred pounds per trip but the wording of the contract is such that we get just about fifty. This under ordinary conditions gives us our letters, papers, magazines and an accational [sic] small package. With the awakening of this camp this summer something will have to be done about better mail facilities for the men who are opening up this great undeveloped district.\n\nNews Notes of District\n\nChas. Mahan is in Spokane relative to his Ramey Ridge Mining Co. Mr. Mahan intends erecting a mill, saw mill and doing extensive development work on his property on Ramey Creek.\n\nD. C. McRae who is working the old Dewey mine at Roosevelt is spending a few days at Edwardsburg.\n\nJacob Janson who was critically ill during the early part of February has recivered [sic] sufficiently to make his monthly trip to Edwardsburg for mail. Messrs Eric and Jacob Janson have a small mill upon their Crooked Creek property and will become one of the Big Creek producers. This property is ideally situated as the altitude there is considerably lower than Edwardsburg and all kinds of garden stuff is grown, this would be quite an item in the economical working of this mine.\n\nTheo. Van Meter who has been spending the greater portion of he winter at Edwardsburg has returned to Yellow Pine. In May he will resume work at the Copper Camp where he is driving the Black Bear tunnel.\n\nChas. Ellison who spent the winter with William A. Edwards is at work on the famous Red Metal Mine at Profile where he will resume his shipments of high grade ore as soon as the trails open. There were more ounces of silver shipped from this property last summer than from the balance of Idaho County combined but the State Mine Inspector failed to make note of this producer.\n\nJoe Davis is spending the spring with Tom Carrey on his South Fork ranch.\n\nFrank Smith one of the original settlers of the Warren, South Fork country has sold his ranch to Mr. Miller of Oregon. Mr. Smith will be greatly missed by his friends for he is one of the most substantial men of this entire section, unswervingly loyal to his friends and a man to be depended upon at all times. Since Mrs. Smith’s tragic death last winter Mr. Smith has spent little of his time at his home but has lived iwth his daughter in Oregon.\n\nWilliam A. Edwards is spending a short time on the South Fork with Crosby Brewer.\n\nEarl Willson who spent the winter visiting his relatives in Oregon and California has returned to his mine at Profile. Mr. Willson is the postmaster at Profile and hopes to see that office with a regular service this fall. It would be a great convenience to have that line extended to Edwardsburg for it takes as long to send a letter around by Warren to Profile as to the European war zone. Under the existing conditions a letter to Boise takes over 30 days in transit and we are blessed to have it go at all.\n\nO. M. Abel and his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Bellingham who have the greater portion of the Caswell ranch at the lower end of Big Creek are doing extensive cultivating of their place. Mr. Abel has been greatly handicapped by the persistent efforts to contest his patent but the matter seems now to have died a natural death as such things generally do and it is to be hoped he and Mrs. Bellingham will be let alone to develop their property as quickly as possible for it is hard enough to have to live in these hills without any hindrances put in ones way.\n\nJohn M. Condon who has built a cabin at the upper end of the Big Creek flat has been in Warren all winter.\n\nChas. Sackett has gone to Boise on business but will return early in July to drive out his cattle. Mr. Sackett is giving up his ranch in Chamberlain.\n\nW. A Gaines has taken up the ranch on Disappointment Creek and last fall brought in cattle from Montana. He had wonderful luck considering he had no hay but his place lies to the south and the snow quickly goes even in the depth of winter. That Chamberlain country will be a great cattle section in time when [?] better known by those who are willing to endure the hardships of such a life.\n\nBert Stump who some years ago lived at what is now the Dave Lewis place is wintering on the breaks of the Salmon river. Mr. Stump like all these who come to the hills for a while, then leave, vowing never to return, has found his way back, this time to remain.

August 10, 1916, Page 3\n\nGreat Mining Activity In South Part Of Idaho County, Says R. N. Bell\n\nPoor Roads Greatest Drawback to Progress in That Section, He Says in Statement\n\n“Greater mining activity is at present apparent in the southern part of Idaho county than at any time in years,” says Robert N. Bell, state mine inspector, who is just home from a tour of inspection through western and northern section of the state. “The greatest drawback to the progress of the mining district in the county is the poor roads,” he added.\n\n“Activity in mining development was seen throughout the entire region visited on my trip. At Logan creek between the Moscow and the Independence groups B. F. Goldman has recently financed the development of the “Gold King Group” of claims owned by himself and Dan MacRae [sic]. He is now working a force of six men.\n\n“The Allison group at Profile creek has a small shipment of 400 ounces of silver ore ready for the market, and several other local operators, including the veteran “Profile Sam” Willson are busy with assessment development work.\n\n“At Rainey [sic] Ridge the Mattey Mahan group is working a small crew and the company operating it is reported to have purchased a small quartz mill to be installed this season.\n\n“The big Independence lode has been bonded to New York capitalists. An expert engineer is due to arrive there shortly for a thorough investigation of its possibilities.\n\nFull Crews Working\n\n“At Warrens the Standard Mining company is working a crew of 20 men and crushing about 20 tons of ore a day from Rescue vein.\n\n“The Unity Mines company, also at Warren, is working a crew of six men by hand on a 2000 foot tunnel that will tap the Little Giant vein below the old works. An up-to-date plant of air drilling machinery has been purchased for this work and is now en route to Idaho. When the machinery has been installed it is the purpose of the company to double the size of the crew and push the tunnel through to an early completion.\n\n“A deal has recently been consummated for the Virgin areas of the Warren Creek Meadows, and I am informed that the ground is shortly to be redrilled with a view of installing a 2000 yard dredge.\n\n“Drilling is also reported in progress at the lower Grouse Creek Meadows. Drilling there is being done for the purpose of determining whether or not a dredge can be profitably installed.\n\n“At Bear Creek 12 miles north of Resort, the Fox & Brigg mine is working a crew of 30 men on road construction and foundation work preparatory to the building of a saw mill and a good sized quartz mill. This mine has a splendid resource of high grade gold ore already developed and awaiting reduction.”\n\nThe mine inspector believes the entire mining district in the southern part of Idaho county is being held back because of poor roads. The forest reserve officials are doing all they can to open up better highways through that section of the state, he says, in addition to keep up a telephone line through Chamberlain Basin.\n\nSnow Almost Gone\n\n“Five thousand dollars,” said the inspector, “would make the road from McCall to South Fork passable for automobiles, while $25,000 would transform the present road from McCall to Edwardsburg into a boulevard with a very easy grade.”\n\nThe snow, he added, was almost all gone in that section, even from the highest summits.\n\n“The Edwardsburg road passes through a most picturesque, heavily timbered canyon and one of the best game countries of the state, rich in a variety of promising mineral that must eventually result in material advantage to the business interests of southwestern Idaho,” Bell declared. “The state can well afford to improve this road and make the country especially on the north shore of Payette lake, where it is the principal land owners. The state holdings embrace the most difficult portion of the entire road.”\n\nInspector Bell’s trip took him to one of the most remote sections of the state. It was made at the request of and at the expense of James F. McCarthy of Wallace, president of the Idaho Mining association, which is attempting to divert the attention of some responsible capital to the central Idaho mining district. Bell has at different times called attention to the opportunities for some big gold mining development in that section, and because of his knowledge of the country was asked to guide a party through the district.\n\nGreat Possibilities\n\nThis section when opened up, the mining inspector says, is going to prove a stimulating factor in the commercial advancement of Boise and other towns in southwestern Idaho.\n\n“The primary object of the trip was the sampling and valuation of the Moscow group of claims on Logan creek, near Edwardsburg, and the Mammoth group of claims at Copper Camp and Big creek, 20 miles further east. The visit to that district embraced a review of the more interesting development north of the Moscow group, including the Laufer & Davis, Gold King, Fairview, Independent [sic] and Blaine mines.\n\n“I accompanied Paul Billingsly, examining engineer, who had full charge of the party. He is an active and practical mining geologist attached to the staff of the Anaconda Copper company at Butte. He was assisted during our trip by George Fowler, also of the Anaconda company’s engineering staff.\n\n“The Moscow group of claims covering a lode, or zone, of gold ore 200 feet thick with 600 feet of underground development, was thoroughly sampled and its geological environments and relations studied and platted in close detail with a view of reporting on the feasibility of its extensive development and equipment. The average values of this great body of mineral is believed to run about $3 in gold to the ton. This ore is susceptible to cheap reduction on the ground by modern cyanide and other milling methods.\n\n“The rugged nature of the country and its remoteness from railroad transportation are the principal drawbacks to the successful treatment of low grade ore values in this region. But the advantages of gravity handling, abundance of water power sites and the magnificent resources of timber are a material offset to the isolation of the region. If the detailed analysis we made of the properties indicate a reasonable margin of profit in prospecting on a large scale, some extensive developments will probably be made for the purpose of determining the staying qualities of the gold values at a further depth. A larger tonnage capacity would necessarily have to result to make such low average values warrant the installation of expensive milling machinery.\n\n“Billingsly and his assistant made the trip from Butte to Boise in an automobile. We went by the way of the Payette lakes after leaving Boise. From the lakes we drove with a team to South Fork and Horseback, and then continued into the Big Creek country. En route we investigated the copper ore deposits in the Mammoth and Black Bear groups located 12 miles below Edwardsburg. We extended the trip on down to Crooked creek opposite Monumental, where our party was entertained by the Janson brothers and shown by them over their recent new strike a rich gold ore. Their holdings embrace a persistent fissure vein in basic granite ranging from six inches to a width of several feet and a mile in length, which exhibited some splendid specimens of gold ore in one tunnel at a face depth of 100 feet. Selected samples from this tunnel run several thousand dollars to the ton, while a two-foot pay streak gave an average milling test of $100 a ton when run through a stamp prospecting mill.\n\nSurveys Made by Men\n\n“A hurried survey was made of the most rugged and isolated section of central Idaho we covered on the trip by Billingsly. During our investigations we were led through the wildest expanse of the great Idaho granite batholith. The engineer carefully platted the immediate drainage and geology of the route we took. The most striking feature of his work was the discovery of the thickest cross section of a typical Prichard slate formation ever mapped or recognized.\n\n“This is the basal member of the Coeur d’Alene series of ancient pre-Crambrian [sic] sediments which have cut such an economic figure as an ore carrier and divided producer in our northern district during the past two years. These highly alteed [sic] states standing at a very steep angle extend from Edwardsburg to Copper Camp, 12 miles below. They are bounded to the east and west by ore bearing granite, and exhibit a structural cross section of between 15,000 and 20,000, and are worthy of a more detailed areal survey to determine their economic possibilities as a probably source of profitable ore.”\n\nsource: Idaho County Free Press.

Lafe has not visited the section for some years and met old friends and acquaintances whom he had not seen for years. He was also much impressed with the marked improvement in the conditions in that section which of late years has been wrought by the miners and settlers on homesteads in the battles to reclaim the wilds.\n\nThe people are alive to the great present and future possibilities of the section, Mr. Yates states, and their every plan is to hasten the day when the future will repay them for the hardships they have endured, remote and removed from transportation as they are at present. And all that hinders [?] rapid progress and improvement, which is first grasped by the visitor, and as Lafe stated, is lack of good roads and appropriations for good roads. And the first step to help in this direction would be the building of the north and south highway, which in itself would tend to stimulate the building of tributary roads that will connect up with this highway.\n\nThose who have homesteads in the section and others who have invested time, money and labor in the mining projects of the country have devoted every resource in their power for the building of roads and trails to facilitate transportation, carrying of the mails and communication with outside points. The burden is more then they alone can bear and they need other assistance from the state and county at large. Lafe’ travels in the mountains have converted him into a live good-roads enthusiast.\n\nIn the way of news of the sections visited by Sheriff Yates, he states that there is considerable activity in all the mining camps, and at Edwardsburg he found Mr. and Mrs. Edwards comfortably located on their homestead. Development work is going ahead on the properties of the district. Andy Cavanaugh [sic], an old timer, is doing work on this property on Logan creek. The owners of the Independence are also developing their property. Others are equally active in that district.\n\nAt Warren the camp is very active at the present time, the only properties being worked being the Rescue, which is working about thirty men, and the Little Giant, which is working a small crew, under the direction of its manager, Jay Czizek. Others are doing extensive development work in the Warren district and a boom is on there.\n\nAt Resort a crew is busy on the Mt. Marshall property pushing development work. The old Fox property, which was bonded for $25,000 some time ago, is being developed under the direction of the new owners, with a purpose of soon installing a mill and commencing active operations. They have $200,000 of high grade ore blocked out at the present time. Holt, who has charge of the old Fox property, has also been busy putting the road in shape from Meadows to McCall which will facilitate the transportation of mining machinery which is to be installed.\n\nsource: Idaho County Free Press.

Under the present law, as we understand it, the canvass must begin within eight days from date of election. While the returns are not all in yet, the Edwardsburg precinct not having yet been heard from, the count was commenced at proper date under the law, and will be closed as soon as the returns have been canvassed, which will probably be this evening. (Thursday.) So far nothing startling in the way of mistakes will in any way change the general results reached by the unofficial returns.\n\nsource: The Grangeville Globe.
