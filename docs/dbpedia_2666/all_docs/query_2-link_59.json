The attorney-general had advised the house that enrolling and engrossing must, under the law, be done at 25 cents and 13 cents a folio, instead of $3 a day, but there was a sentiment in the house in favor of having the work done in the latter way, and Mr. Rohrbaugh introduced a resolution authorizing the chief enrolling clerk to employ a sufficient number of clerks to do the work .\n\nMr. Benedict fought the resolution as extra va rant and said that the eighty persons who were waiting for places ought to be sent home forthwith. Mr. Benefit, with some heat, challenged the statement of Mr. Benedict, and Mr .\n\nBono followed in the same line of argument. The debate continued with a great deal of feeling and some offensive allusions, but the friends of the resolution were in the majority, and the roll call resulted: Ayes, 8i); noes, 80. Just before noon Mr. Miller, chairman of the committee on elections, attempted to make a verbal report in the case of Glenn against Wightman, but Newman (pop.) objected.
