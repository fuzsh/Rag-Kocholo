It was soon obvious that the subject could not be examined in vacuo, for the influence of the colony of Newfoundland became increasingly apparent, changing what began as an international problem between Britain and France into a triangular conflict involving severe strains on the imperial connection, and on the colony's relations with Canada. If Newfoundland can be called the Cinderella of the Empire, then certainly Canada was one of the notorious step-sisters, and very often the United States took on the appearance of the handsome prince. The story of the Anglo-French fishery at Newfoundland falls easily into three phases. The first was from Cabot's voyage in 1497 to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, a period when both countries manreuvred for control of this strategically located island, with victory finally going to Britain. During the whole of this time it can be said with much truth that Newfoundland as a colony did not exist even though several settlements were established during the seventeenth century. By the Treaty of Utrecht the French accepted British sovereignty over the island, and the British recognized that the French possessed certain fishing and territorial rights. These rights underwent complicating changes by subsequent treaties in 1763 and 1783, but even up until the latter date the control of the treaties with France (and after the latter date, with the United States) lay completely with the Imperial government. However, Britain's wars with France between 1793 and 1814 created conditions in which Newfoundland emerged as a distinct colony, no longer wishing to be a submissive ward of the Admiralty, or just a fishing station during the summer months for fishermen from Europe. The third period began with England's recognition of a colony where she had wished no colony to be. It continued with the grant of representative government in 1832, responsible government in 1855, and ended in 1904 after fifty years spent by colonial governments endeavouring, and with a large measure of success, to persuade England to dissolve her treaties with France made at Newfoundland's expense, by new arrangements made at her own, and Africa's. The story of the French shore problem is, then, not merely concerned with international treaties which both Britain and France interpreted to their advantage, but it is also much of the story of Newfoundland's emergence from Imperial proscription.

The cod fishery of the northwestern Atlantic never became the monopoly of one country. Whether the credit for having first successfully exploited this fishery belongs to the Portuguese or the French is a moot point, but that the latter were fishing at Newfoundland in 1504 seems certain. There are records of English attempts to fish, trade, and settle in the island during the first half of the sixteenth century, but formidable participation did not come until fifty years after Cabot's voyages, and particularly during the reigns of the later Tudors. Spanish interest dates from about 1540, but rapid growth was followed by gradual decline, and Portugal, falling under the thrall of Spain, disappeared as a serious rival, so that at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War France and England were the chief contenders for the Newfoundland fisheries. England's growing interest in Newfoundland was reflected in the visit of Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1583. In agreement with certain adventurers of Southampton he sailed for the island, claimed it for the Crown of England, and made laws for the governance of all in Newfoundland and of all who were to settle in his colony, a nucleus of which he left to govern during his absence. It was here that antagonism was first aroused between those who intended to establish permanent settlements in the island and the adventurers who preferred only occupation during the summer fishery . Caught unawares, the shipmasters within Gilbert's reach had to submit, but fortunately for them the little colony grew discouraged when their guardian sailed for home, and soon they too departed. So far England had done nothing new in Newfoundland, for in asserting English sovereignty Gilbert did no more than had been done by Jacques Cartier, who in 1535 \"hissa le drapeau frarn;ais sur les cotes de Terre-Neuve,\" 2 and in 1540 went to Newfoundland with a number of colonists. A comparison of Gilbert's short-lived efforts on the east coast with the fearless explorations of Cartier some fifty years before on the west reveals the folly of dating sovereignty from 1583. The nearest England came to sovereignty in the sixteenth century was in the overlordship exerted by her shipping captains in the harbours visited during the summer, and in the consolidation of the English fishery on the east coast south of Cape Bonavista which tended to deflect the French to more distant parts of the island. Gilbert found no French fisherman in St. John's harbour\n\n4\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nwhen he visited it, but they were in nearby harbours such as Renewse, along the south coast towards Cape Breton, at the Magdalen Islands, and on the more northerly shores, and during the last quarter of the sixteenth century they took an increasing interest in the Banks. The concentration of English fishermen (largely from Somerset and Devon) on the eastern shore was partly dictated by a shortage of salt, which forced them to seek drying areas adjacent to the fishing grounds and to develop the dry fishery, which required less salt than the green generally practised by the French. A greater supply of salt and a more extensive domestic market encouraged the French to exploit a larger area. Thus, although European nationalism may be blamed for the establishment of two separate fisheries, the variation in method encouraged the English to limit, and the French to extend, their areas. But it would be wrong to assume that these divisions were distinct, or that a monopoly was established by either power in its respective sphere. During the seventeenth century the English fished north of Bonavista and lived in French harbours, and their sack ships visited fishermen there; at the same time Frenchmen despatched sack ships to the English shore often before the English could arrive. The shores which each controlled represented the minimum with which each would be content, but the full ambition of French and English during the seventeenth century was the monopoly of the Newfoundland trade and fishery. As a means of establishing a monopoly the two countries carried out schemes of colonization. It is not sufficient to consider only the projected settlements in Newfoundland when tracing this policy. The great fisheries along the coast and about the island were only parts of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence system, and the strategy of the north Atlantic must be considered as a whole. Suffice it to state here, however, that the French seem to have assessed the strategic value of Newfoundland better than the English: they realized that Newfoundland is an integral part of the north bank of the St. Lawrence River, and invariably treated it as such, seizing the south shore, fortifying Placentia and keeping it in close communication with Quebec. 3 The English attitude to the island was more complex. The merchants of England's West Country, dependent on the summer fishery, waged almost ceaseless efforts to prevent Newfoundland from becoming a plantation, while merchants of Bristol, London, and Southampton supported colonists, who would carry on trade through them. The government approved several early efforts to establish a colony, and before the Interregnum several charters of settlement had been granted. Those to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, to the Earl of Northampton and others in 1610, to Sir George Calvert in 1628, and to Sir David Kirke in 1638 are among the better known. None of the attempts can be considered a success, but judging by later colonial development in Newfoundland, there seems little doubt that those early attempts would have led to more satisfactory results had they not been opposed by the West Country merchants. After the failure of Sir David Kirke's enterprise, moreover, the English government gradually became first an ally of these merchants, then a prime mover in anti-settlement policy. The West Country merchants and the English government had different reasons for their parallel policies. These merchants, independent traders, had motives\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n5\n\nof prudence and profit to encourage them, and from a commercial point of view their designs were not adverse to the economic prosperity of England. By real or specious arguments they sought to promote legislation which would prevent the Newfoundland fisheries from falling into the hands of colonists. A real argument which appealed to the English government was that if the residents were encouraged they would dispossess the transients and place the fishery beyond imperial control. A specious argument which still persists was that the severity of the climate, the paucity of good places to settle, and the infertility of the soil rendered Newfoundland an unfit place to establish permanent communities. France's attempts to establish colonies in Newfoundland during the seventeenth century were aimed at bringing her parts of the island under more direct control. In 1604 the first French establishment was begun at St. Pierre and Miquelon and in 1627 Newfoundland was included along with Hudson Bay in the charter of Louis XIII to the Associates of New France. Real interest in colonization, however, appears to have begun with the official establishment of Placentia on the south coast, which in 1662 was settled, fortified, and garrisoned. The French controlled a greater part of the Newfoundland shore and consequently there was little jostling between the transient and the settler. Even though the French fishery was largely a ship fishery, with some residents and byeboat keepers at Placentia, St. Mary's and St. Pierre, quarrels did arise, but these were kept at a minimum by the presence of a royal governor at Placentia after 1672, who was able to settle disputes on the spot with the backing of royal authority. Enormous catches were made by the French on the banks, which was a year round fishery, and on the shore north of Cape Bonavista. Besides, the French fishing industry at Newfoundland had a considerable edge over its English counterpart in its control of the home market, quicker despatch of a superior product to Spain, Portugal, and Italy, cheaper provisions and production, and the fishery's sounder financial basis, which obviated the necessity for merchants to mortgage their ships before sending them to Newfoundland. In some respects the English navigation acts even operated to French advantage. The act of 1660 prevented foreign ships from engaging in the fishery trade if their cargoes were bound for England, but not if the cargo went to a foreign market, which was the usual thing in the Newfoundland trade. An act of 1663 did not change that situation, but added a further foreign advantage when it allowed the free importation of salt into New England and Newfoundland. Salt ships that had called at ports in France and Spain were able to smuggle many goods into these areas in the guise of salt, to the detriment of the English merchants who sought a monopoly of the provision trade. Even today the full story of the French in Newfoundland has not been revealed, and it is not surprising therefore, to find in the English Court in the seventeenth century considerable ignorance of the true situation. Naturally enough the government was dependent to a great extent for information on the reports of those engaged in the Newfoundland trade and fishery. These reports do not speak with one voice, for much depended upon whether or not the authors favoured colonization in the island. In 1666, for example, certain complaints reached England about the forceful removal of an Englishman on the south coast, and the refusal of the French to pay the 5 or\n\n6\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\n10 per cent levy which the English from time to time sought to impose upon the French as an act of sovereignty. These actions alarmed the pro-colonials, who argued that effective measures should be taken by the English government to offset the fortified garrison at Placentia, and that the levy should again be forced upon the French because in the days when Kirke had done so the English fishery had prospered. If the French succeeded in controlling Newfoundland, it was argued, they would be in a position to offer the Atlantic colonies serious menace. ' On the contrary, the West Country merchants informed the government that the French had not trespassed on the English zone, and that the fortifications at Placentia were not for offensive purposes but merely to protect the French from encroachments by the English, and to safeguard their fur trade. It is not definitely known whether the West Countrymen really believed this, or whether they preferred to face French competition rather than suffer the presence of colonists in the best harbours, backed by their commercial rivals. Lounsbury has suggested that to gain favour with the government they may have capitalized on the \"pro-French leanings of the Court of Charles II during those years.\" 4 Innis seems to suggest that the difficulties of the West Countrymen were many, and that they endeavoured to remove the settlers because the French were more completely beyond their influence: The Newfoundland fishery as conducted by the English had been handicapped by competition from France, New England, and the carrying-trade, by wars, and-scarcely less serious-rumors of wars. It had borne grudgingly the tax of impressed sailors levied on an area favored by legislation as \"the nursery for seamen\". An absence of military defense because of a policy imposed in the interests of the navy involved serious burdens incidental to the destruction wrought by wars. The support given by the fishing ships to the navy weakened the position of settlements and the development of military defences. The prosecution of the settlements by land defense was neglected because of reliance on naval defense, and because the additional taxes would sap the strength of the English fishery in competition with the French. On the other hand the growth of settlements in spite of restrictions involved exposing them to attack from the French and disastrous losses. Settlements and the growing importance of the sackship trade, and of London interests fostered by New England support, necessitated greater attention to land defense which called for a type of government other than that provided by the admirals of the fishing ships. The burden of naval defense strengthened New England and weakened the fishing ships of the West Country. 5\n\nAfter the third Dutch War in the 1670's, when Holland's power was considerably diminished, France loomed larger in official opinion as a rival to England's trade and fishery. Anxious to secure more reliable information concerning French activities in Newfoundland, the Lords of Trade thus recommended that the commodores who convoyed the fishing fleets should make investigations and report their findings. The influence of the West Countrymen prevailed, despite reports -some from merchant groups favouring colonists, and others from commodoresthat any serious attempt to force out the planters would only send them fleeing to the French for protection, whose fishery under official protection was prospering to an alarming degree. The full danger of French competition was lost amid the monopolistic endeavours of the West Countrymen, the controversy between them and the planters, and the London merchants' lack of influence in official places. Nevertheless the accession of William III was followed by a policy for both the suppression of settlement in Newfoundland and the circumscription of the French fisheries. In his declaration of war, May 7, 1689, Wil-\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n7\n\nliam III complained that it was \"not long since the French took licences from the English Governor of Newfoundland, to fish in the seas upon that coast, and paid a Tribute for such Licences, as an Acknowledgement of the sole Right of the Crown of England to that Island and yet of late, the encroachment of the French upon Our said Island, and our Subjects Trade and Fishery have been more like the invasions of an Enemy, than of becoming Friends, who enjoy the advantages of that Trade only by Permission.\" This appears to be a determination to enforce by war a state of things which inconveniently had not existed prior to French expansion. The War of the League of Augsburg brought no such enforcement, and the French continued at Placentia and fished as before in their accustomed places. Yet William preferred not to relinquish his assumed sovereignty over Newfoundland. In 1698 Parliament passed a famous, or infamous, act (10 and 11 Will. III, c. 25) which the West Country merchants hailed with joy because it marked the triumph of their anti-colonial policy, and which the pro-colonials considered impolitic as well as unjust. The act declared that \"no Alien or Stranger whatsoever (not residing within the Kingdom of England, the Dominion of Wales, or Town of Berwick-upon-Tweed) should at any Time hereafter take any Bait or use any Sort of Trade or Fishing whatsoever in Newfoundland, or in any of the Islands or Places above-mentioned.\" A Foreign Office memorandum of 1889 claimed that it \"is difficult to imagine any more formal assertion of the sovereignty of the English Crown,\" but in the light of subsequent events it would be difficult to imagine a more ineffective assertion of sovereignty over Newfoundland. Though the act remained in force for well over a century, the settlements it purported to discourage increased, the trade it was designed to aid declined, the navy it was framed to strengthen received little benefit, and the French it forbade to fish continued to do so long after the measure was repealed. Between 1699 and 1713 the commercial competition and active enmity of France were in large measure responsible for discouraging the English overseas fishery. The French were accused of pursuing a policy of expansion on the north Atlantic fishing grounds in order to gain commercial and naval supremacy. It was variously estimated that France, between 1699 and 1713, had four to eight hundred ships, and sixteen to thirty thousand men occupied in the fisheries of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, the Banks, and the Gulf, while England sent only about five thousand men, not including the New Englanders, whose settled fishery was in competition with that of the mother country. The desire to have France completely removed from the fishery gradually increased during the period of the War of the Spanish Succession. It became a matter of imperial importance instead of merely a fishery interest though a reservation must be made in the case of the West Country merchants, since they appeared unmoved over the settlement achieved at Utrecht that closed the war in 1713. The British government received ample advice from merchants on the best ways of dealing with Newfoundland in the negotiations with a defeated France at Utrecht. Opinion was heavily in favour of completely excluding the French from the Island, for if they were enabled to maintain their former position on the south coast, they would have the best fishery and if a French prince were also to rule over Spain, Naples, and Milan the dangers to English trade would\n\n8\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nbe startlingly apparent. If they were removed from Placentia, but allowed to fortify St. Pierre, the English defences at the former place would be rendered impotent. To send them to Petit Nord would give them control of the short route to Canada and put them dangerously in touch with Canadian Indians. Another serious objection to re-admitting the French was revealed in a letter to the Duke of Shrewsbury, the plenipotentiary in Paris, from Queen Anne, on December 11, 1712, which indicated the threat to any future Anglo-French amity consequent upon permitting the French to fish and dry on the shores of Newfoundland alongside the English. Queen Anne and her memorialists were disappointed, however, for although France secured the exclusive use of Cape Breton, England had to share the Newfoundland fisheries with her late enemies. M. Torey had protested that those fisheries were indispensable to French economy, and Louis XIV intimated that he was prepared to fight another war rather than surrender all claims to them. By article 13 of the Treaty of Utrecht, 6 France recognized the sovereignty of England over Newfoundland. She yielded Placentia and all other places which she had held, although her fishermen were to be allowed to fish and dry on the coast from Cape Bonavista passing by the north to Point Riche on the west coast. It was this article which legally established the dominion of England over Newfoundland, and which formed the true basis of British sovereignty, not the claims of 1497 or the largely unsuccessful attempts at charter settlement between 1578 and 1637-not to mention ineffectual clauses in imperial legislation. The treaty plainly indicated the growing strength of Great Britain in North America. Still, all the victories of Marlborough had not sufficed to exclude the French from Newfoundland completely, though they had been transferred to what was thought the least important part of the coast for the fishery and defence. To the English merchants, other than those of the West Country, this provision of the treaty was a great disappointment; a true mercantile policy for the fisheries had been sacrificed to procure a speedy peace with France. Yet West Country merchants were not overly disappointed with the settlement, for they had long held that the French menace was exaggerated, and, not yet aware of the value of the west and northeast coasts, they were at least glad the French had been removed from the south, forbidden on the east, and packed away to the north. Better the French at Petit Nord than their London opponents, with their settlers, engaged in establishing a resident fishery. After the peace, old habits prevailed as French fishermen continued to visit the south coast. These encroachments were checked, but only by a relaxation of the prohibition against settlers, for otherwise later French visits could not have been detected and discouraged. More serious trespass was committed upon the west coast south of Point Riche, where the French, despite naval and gubernatorial information to the contrary, fished for cod and salmon, trapped for fur, occasionally stayed the winter, and sometimes \"lost\" themselves in the woods to escape the reach of the law. The French surreptitiously appropriated an extra two hundred miles of coastline, and when later challenged on the encroachment, denied British assertions that Point Riche was located at 50° 30' north latitude, and put forth a contention for 47° 40', which was really the position of Cape Ray.\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n9\n\nOf the coasts of Newfoundland none was more neglected than the west coast between Cape Ray and Cape Norman. Until the survey of James Cook later in the eighteenth century, the British government were not well informed about the west coast, and in a sense it was French territory in spite of the surrender of 1713. Numerous French names prove the consistency of French visits, but until the last quarter of the seventeenth century settlement was improbable there, and no less on the northeast. Added to the rigours of long winters and icebound harbours were dangers from Indians and Eskimoes, both of whom frequented Petit Nord at this time. No English records exist of French settlement on the west and northeast coasts from 1680 to 1713, but as the Treaty of Utrecht forbad French settlements it is probable some had been established. By this period the Beothuk Indians had driven the Eskimoes to Labrador, from where they never returned, and had themselves retired to the interior of the island. Danger of raids was thus removed from the Petit Nord. The establishment of a fortified settlement at Placentia in 1662 probably encouraged permanency in other French regions, and as the fishery increased in all areas there arose a more urgent need for some fishermen to remain behind to protect property and prepare for the next season's fishery. These developments, of course, were hindered by the arrangements of 1713. The history of Newfoundland during the first century of recognized British sovereignty was one of official opposition to permanent settlement, with intervals wherein the force of circumstances compelled the establishment of institutions indispensable to settled communities. From 1699 to 1708, under the terms of 10 and 11 William III, c. 25, the administration of justice was left to the tender mercies of .t he fishing admirals, men well versed in the ways of fish, ignorant of the law, quick to judge in their own interest, and little stirred by affection for the settlers. In 1708 an order-in-council placed supreme command on shore iD the hands of the commodore of the Newfoundland convoy, \"a shift fro:-n the superlative to the comparative degree of badness,\" which command began with the arrival and ended with the departure of the commodore, leaving the settlers during the winter months to their own devices. The industrious were at the mercy of the idle, those who attempted to retain a semblance of Christian society were offended by the profligate, and any hope for a law-abiding community was mocked by the ease in which the most heinous crimes were committed without retribution. Armed with a sizable list of grievances West Country interests sought to prevail with the British government to prevent an endorsement of civil government: they declared that a permanent community was an encouragement to smuggling, a convenient location for the abduction of experienced seamen by New Englanders, and a threat to the transient fishery (so important to the navy) because the planters pre-empted the available fishing rooms. Newfoundland's unhappy situation reflected the British government's uncertain state of mind. Settlement should have been discouraged, but it increased; settlers should have been removed, but it was never expedient. For the attainment of a minimum of order while the government evolved a satisfactory policy, certain temporary prerequisites of ordered society were established. These by their very nature, despite their inadequacy, gradually gave permanence to the community which was officially opposed. In 1728 Captain Osborn of H.M.S. Squirrel was\n\n10\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\ncommissioned governor and commander-in-chief of Newfoundland; he was allowed to appoint justices of the peace and various other officials to aid in the administration of the island's affairs. The chief weakness of this innovation was its seasonal character, for the settlers were still left largely without legal government when the governor departed at the end of the summer. Even in summer its operation was hindered by the deliberate obstruction of the fishing admirals, representing the West Country merchants, who openly asserted that the power of the justices was based only on the King's Commission while theirs rested firmly upon Imperial statute. None the less the development was a slight improvement for the settlers. A court of vice-admiralty was established in 1737; four years later a naval officer was appointed to collect clearance fees from vessels engaged in the fishery. The clause in the act of 1698 whereby criminals were to be taken to England for trial had proved hopelessly inadequate, and to make the execution of justice in serious crimes more effective, the commission of Governor Drake in 1750 included power to appoint commissioners of oyer and terminer. In 1762 a custom house was established in St. John's. The shore assigned to the French had been chosen, among other reasons, because it was little known and appreciated by the British negotiators, and because it was rarely visited by British fishermen. To place the French there meant a continuity of two separate fisheries and the prevention of frequent quarrels. For forty years after 1713 the British contented themselves generally, though not entirely, with the traditional shore between Cape Bonavista and Cape St. Mary and the newly acquired shore westward from Placentia. Hence the French enjoyed a virtual monopoly of their shore, particularly north of Cape St. John, and exercised extra-territoriality. The first fishing captain to arrive became admiral for the season under a French naval ordinance of 1681, and French naval vessels came to enforce regulations of French making, and to expel, by force if necessary, all British intruders. Whatever the \"true\" interpretation of the treaty of 1713, custom at least persuaded the French that the fishery on the treaty shore was theirs alone during the season. The question of the nature of French rights came into prominence in the mideighteenth century, not merely as an academic discussion, but because certain factors arose which permanently altered conditions in Newfoundland, and made the \"French shore\" problem a topic of public and diplomatic discussion for one hundred and fifty years. War has its favourites, and during the Seven Years' War the settlers profited at the expense of the transient and the French fishermen. Along the British shore were established the main concentrations of illegal settlers.7 Each new resident was anxious to secure an unoccupied cove, and gradually all available places were filled. Wherever possible the \"liveyers\" encroached on French preserves-where they remained if they escaped the vigilance of French naval authorities-or ingratiated themselves into French favour. This process alone would not have precipitated the problem into the arena of diplomatic quarrels, were it not that as the British transient fishermen found themselves shut out from the traditional shore, they too moved northwards to the emptier regions beyond Bonavista. Slowly it became known that the French had good fishing grounds, and this, linked with the need for fishing space, prompted the pressure which the West Country interest brought to bear on the British government to support a concurrent fishery. In the absence of the French, the\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n11\n\nsettler and those transients not impressed by the navy moved freely on the treaty coast. Hence when negotiations were begun for a peace, most urgent representations were made to the government to eliminate French rights and give the whole island into the hands of the transients. Once again those interested in the Newfoundland trade and fishery raised their voices during the negotiations to insist upon a British monopoly. Mingled with the familiar cry that French naval power was nurtured upon the Newfoundland fisheries was the economic undertone that the fish procurable at Petit Nord was particularly acceptable to British Mediterranean markets. William Pitt, probably urged by City merchants, supported the complete exclusion of France from the fishery, and considered the consummation of such a policy worth \"another campaign or two.\" But France was not easily overcome, for following the resignation of Pitt in October 1761, and the entry of Spain into the war early in 1762, the French showed how deadly serious they were about the Newfoundland fisheries. When the loss of Louisburg was accepted and only St. Pierre and Miquelon offered upon very strict terms as a shelter for French fishermen, a determined attempt was made in the summer of 1762 to seize Newfoundland. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful, but it impressed the opponents of Pitt, emphasizing what they already suspected, that a maritime power like France could never willingly give up the source of her naval strength. The argument for the inclusion of France in the Newfoundland fisheries was supported by a clear statement of the Board of Trade which contended that the present war was not caused by French encroachments in the fishery, and further military engagements to exclude France would probably arouse European fears of a British monopoly of the fish trade. With France expelled from Canada her participation in the fisheries would be much diminished, and in any case a British monopoly would not open the lucrative French market. Further weight was added to these points by the Duke of Bedford, the ambassador in Paris, who attempted to put the subject on an ethical plane by asserting \"that it was unnatural to expect a maritime country like France to cede her rights to the fishery . .. and that England should recognize that France had a right to develop.\" Prudence, then, determined that by article 5 of the Treaty of Paris, February 10, 1763,8 French participation in the Newfoundland fisheries on the terms granted in 1713 should be confirmed except that it was conferred as a \"liberty.\" Although it could be said, from a strictly literal reading of the text, that France, by accepting the term \"liberty,\" had renounced her claim to a residual right in favour of one conferred by Britain, any further comment upon the use of the term would be futile. It had little effect upon later developments, and the French gave no importance to it. Once the French had surrendered their North American empire Great Britain felt it safe to allow them to return to the waters south of Newfoundland, from which they had been ousted in 1713. Article 6 of the Treaty of Paris9 ceded the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon for service as a shelter to French fishermen. They were not to be fortified. These islands, comprising about one hundred square miles, formed of solid masses of granite with a few lakes and streams, a thin covering of soil, and scanty vegetation, must have looked microscopic to a nation once well on the way to supremacy in North America. In 1536 Cartier\n\n12\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nfound French ships at these islands; by the seventeenth century the French were predominant; in 1700 they were fortified against the British into whose hands they fell in 1702. After 1713 British fishermen from the West Country, Jersey, and Guernsey, who had lost their fishery on the east coast, resorted to the islands to fish and trade. It was not without protest, therefore, that in 1763 St. Pierre and Miquelon were returned to the French. The physical proximity of the islands to Newfoundland, and the humiliation caused France by the alarming diminution of her North American empire, created a condition fraught with hazard. On March 15, 1763, the Board of Trade advised the British government that because there were not enough resources in the islands for them to be a base for a resident fishery, and because French rights on the northeast coast of Newfoundland afforded better facilities for drying their Bank-caught fish, the first danger to be apprehended from St. Pierre and Miquelon was that of illicit trade with North America. Aware of the danger, the British government interpreted article 6 in its narrowest sense. To deprive the French of cheap materials for their boats and to prevent an effective competition in the fishery, contact with Newfoundland's timber and bait resources was discouraged. Concern too for the British monopoly of the Newfoundland provision trade was embodied in this policy of isolation. France also executed her plan. The islands became a centre of the French fishery, a shelter and gathering place for fishing ships, and an entrepot for supplies, and they provided natural flakes for the drying of some of their catch. French warships which convoyed the fleet made their rendezvous at the port of St. Pierre; the settlers practised a modest shore fishery, and not least, an extensive trade was created with North America. In view of the developments on the treaty shore during and after the Seven Years' War, it is evident that French fishermen were in need of more support than they themselves could muster. Upon their return to the shore after the conflict, they found many of the best rooms between Cape Bonavista and Cape St. John occupied by settlers. Added to these intrusions were those of the British transients who had learned the value of the \"French shore\" and were unwilling to deprive themselves of a share in it. In support of their action, these men invoked the authority of 10 and 11 William III, c. 25, to support their claim that all the coasts of Newfoundland were open to them. It would be difficult, therefore, to counter the French argument that a concurrent fishery meant a decreasing participation, and ultimately a negation of their treaty claims. The French knew that many of the British transients came to the treaty shore because they had been excluded from the east coast by the settlers; that some settlers, ousted by the returning transients, had moved north to Bonavista; and that in certain cases collusion took place between transient and settler to pre-empt suitable places on the treaty coast. It was convenient therefore, for reasons of their own, for both settler and transient to believe in the existence of a concurrent fishery, and it was natural for the French to deny it. At this low ebb of French imperial forhme their attempts to seek recognition of an exclusive fishery could be considered as a defensive action to preserve without diminution undefined rights conferred by treaties. The inability of _the British government to preserve an exclusive fishery for the English transients on the eastern shore was an object lesson to the French authorities. In 1764 the French ambassador threatened war unless his country\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n13\n\nreceived satisfaction on the subject of exclusive rights, and when his threat was verified in Paris the British government became more conciliatory than hitherto, but little was accomplished except to instruct naval officers on the Newfoundland station to make every effort to prevent trouble. Shortly after the peace the French government granted a bounty on their Newfoundland fishery to encourage extended operations on the treaty shore. Ulterior motives have been read into this act: and the charge is true, if the French effort to hold the whole shore against British encroachment can be called an unfriendly act. In 1770 Captain Palliser reported that the French fishery on the treaty shore was greater than the British, the latter making use of harbours not frequented by the French. While this report proves the existence of a concurrent fishery, the French bounty given to those who used new harbours showed that the presence of Englishmen was not to the French taste. The effectiveness of bounties is seen in a Board of Trade report in 1770, which blamed these subsidies for the increasing number of incidents between English and French fishermen, and though it was recognized that the bounties were a French privilege, it was hoped the practice would be discontinued. In answer to a French complaint against the trespass of settlers, the Board stated that residents were discouraged for the benefit of the French and English fishery, but there were no legal means to prevent their advance along the coast. It is hardly surprising then, in the face of such a policy, that the French should devise measures for the maintenance of their own rights as they saw them. After twelve years of uneasy peace in Newfoundland and ineffective protest by the residents, the transient fishery received a new lease on life with the passage in 1775 of Palliser's act (15 Geo. III, c. 31). The West Country merchants were once more confirmed in act their pre-eminence. The fishery which Palliser wished to continue was the ship fishery-the nursery for seamen. He despised the shore fishermen, and considered the men who followed it neither good fishermen nor good seamen. Reasons for the lack of official support for settlers in Newfoundland are varied. There is the argument that \"British policy towards Newfoundland had been founded upon the supposition that a fishery carried on from English shores would benefit seapower.\" 10 An American historian, R. G. L. Lounsbury claims that the British government's support of the western adventurers was \"not because (they) admired their methods more than those of others, but rather because they feared that the erection of colonial government and any encouragement to the Newfoundlanders would result in making the island a second New England ... [and the] British government had always before its eyes the horrible example of New England and the other 'bread' colonies of the north, which were included in the plantation system, but whose products were never suited to a regulatory system designed to promote Virginia tobacco and Barbados sugar.\" 11 Seamen and fishermen who stayed behind in the island were beyond the impressment officers, and too often Newfoundland was but a gateway to overly independent New England. One aspect of Newfoundland history during the eighteenth century can be seen in the alliance between settlers and New Englanders, to whom settlement was a mutual advantage in trade and fishery, and the association of the West Country merchants with the Royal Navy, the former seeking a monopoly of trade, the latter of sailors.\n\n14\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nIn spite of a legally supported transient fishery, a settled fishery of British subjects gradually established itself on sections of the coast. They settled on the south coast after the removal of the French, though progress in that region was for some time hindered by pirates. The coast between Trepassey, south of St. John's and Cape Bonavista held most of the settlers, but long before the period under review they had spilled beyond English limits. Apart from the natural increase of settlers who remained despite the failure of chartered colonies, growth in population was to a large degree due to those who were most vociferous against colonization. Contrary to law some fishing captains encouraged fishermen to remain during the winter to protect property, repair boats and gear, and gener-ally prepare for next season's fishery; shipowners could not resist the temptation to use their ships for carrying passengers to North America, many of whom got no further than Newfoundland; it was also contrary to law for shipmasters to pay their crew and fishermen more than half their wages in advance of the voyage, a ruling which offered the temptation of abandoning men to save payment of the remaining wage. Further, the harshness of conditions in the Royal Navy encouraged desertions and avoidance of impressment officers. The social and legal implications of official and mercantile anti-colonialism, and connivance at \"settlement,\" have bequeathed an excellent opportunity to study the theory and application of mercantilism in Newfoundland.12 During the American Revolution, dissatisfaction with arrangements on the treaty coast, as well as at St. Pierre, influenced the French in their decision to support the American rebels. Article VI of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and the belligerent colonies contained a renunciation by the former of any claims to conquest on the North American continent, and a recognition by the latter of the claims of France to an exclusive fishery on the treaty coast of Newfoundland. No detailed apportionment of the north Atlantic fisheries was made by the allies, but it is significant that the first plan of campaign prepared by the French in January 1778 included a naval attack on Newfoundland. The omission of the fisheries from the Franco-American treaty may not have been an indication of their insignificance, but of their great importance; for both France and the American colonies, particularly the New England group, had a serious interest in them, and neither was likely to make any commitments regarding the price until the war was won. The treaty of friendship has generally obscured the evidence of keen rivalry which existed between the old and the new antagonists of Britain. The exclusive position in Newfoundland which Britain had not achieved in 1763 certainly could not be consummated in 1783. Therefore the French again returned to Newfoundland at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. The British, however, drew strength during the peace negotiations from the proclivity of her enemies to nullify their alliance by clandestine parleys with their common foe. Previous to formal bargaining, the French government told Mr. Fitzherbert, the British ambassador, that it would require \"the full and entire sovereignty\" of the late Newfoundland treaty coast and in addition \"the entire and exclusive\" use of the fishery within the same limits. At their first conference the French Foreign Minister endeavoured to forestall the Americans\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n15\n\nby insisting upon the surrender of a large extent of the Newfoundland shore as a French reserve. An old argument was raised to support French demands for the inclusion of the whole west coast in the original treaty shore. Point Riche, the southerly limit by the treaties of 1713 and 1763, was placed by Vergennes, on the basis of Herman Moll's Map, at a point where Cape Ray is situated. Reference was also made to the quarrels between British and French fishermen which had occurred on the shore between Capes Bonavista and St. John. To obviate the clearing of this portion of the coast (which by now, owing to the complete absence of the French since 1780, was more thickly settled), it was proposed \"comme un moyen possible de compenser a la France\" for \"la perte de la peche et de la secherie\" previously possessed, Great Britain should relinquish to France \"toute la cote depuis le Cap Saint-Jean, en tournant par le nord et le nord-ouest, jusqu'au Cap May.\" Vergennes did not request that France should have full and entire sovereignty over the region, but only that French fishermen should have exclusive rights within the limits. By this moderation he hoped to make his demand more acceptable to the British, while simultaneously acquiring an advantage over France's late confederate, \"for if Britain retained sovereign power over the whole of Newfoundland, the Americans would not be in a position to embarrass their French ally with a request for participation.\" The implications of the French demand for an increased share in the Newfoundland shore fisheries were not lost on the British government. George III wrote to Grantham that France must be satisfied with a smaller share \"unless America is not permitted to have much of that Island; otherwise between the two poor England must have the worst share.\" Similar opinions were held by Shelburne, who decided that France should have the northeast coast and as far as Cape Ray on the west, which was still rarely visited by British fishermen and had few settlers. Even this decision was contrary to mercantile demands, for the merchants of Poole now petitioned for the exclusion of France from Newfoundland. When the French demands were again repeated by Rayneval on his first visit to England in September, Shelburne agreed to the wisdom of separating the French and British fishermen to avoid quarrels, and went so far as to appreciate \"the logic of that position and agreed that the French should have the sole and undisturbed use of their new inshore fishery.\" He would not, however, accept the word \"exclusive\" which would raise awkward issues. Pursuant to his instructions, Fitzherbert, during further discussions at Paris in September, informed Vergennes that Cape Ray was to be the limit of the French shore on the west coast. This limit at first displeased the French minister as \"being so considerable a defalcation of his original demand.\" La Poile was then suggested as the limit of the French shore on the south coast, but when Vergennes learned from Fitzherbert that the British government would not go beyond Cape Ray \"he finally acquiesced.\" A few days later Fitzherbert was instructed that the southern coast \"was possessed of great advantages in point of harbours and fisheries, and was not, therefore, to be given up,\" advice which reveals the influence of the petition from the merchants of Poole. Despite further pressure during the formal negotiations to modify the decision to include a portion of the south coast in the French treaty shore, article 5 of the Definitive Treaty of Versailles, September 3, 1783, confined the French between Cape St. John by the north to Cape Ray.\n\n16\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nThe demarcation of the geographical limits of the French shore was relatively easy compared with the attempt to define the nature of the French rights which were to operate there. No serious dispute arose from the former question, but the latter furnished over one hundred years of wrangling. On October 28, 1782, Fitzherbert reported \"that M. de Vergennes was not disposed to insist very strenuously upon the point\" of the exclusive right. Eight days later he reported that Vergennes insisted upon it emphatically, bringing forth all his former arguments in favour of the concession. This volte-face was probably the result of intelligence that Great Britain was about to give the Americans a right to participate generally in the Newfoundland fishery along with British subjects. If such were to be the final agreement with the Americans, France could hope for no more than a concurrent fishery to be shared with new friends and old enemies. Fitzherbert endeavoured to dissuade Vergennes from insisting on the exclusive right, but \"finding that what he had said had not made the desired impression, he at last ventured to propose, as a mezzo termine (taking care, however, to add that the proposition came from himself), that the said exclusive right should not be mentioned in the Treaty, but that Great Britain should promise 'Ministeriellement', to secure it to the French fishermen by means of proper instructions to that effect to the Governor of Newfoundland, an expedient which M. de Vergennes came into readily, saying that such a Ministerial assurance would fully satisfy him.\" This idea of Fitzherbert appears to have caught on, though official approval cannot be ascertained from government correspondence. Lord Shelburne suggested something very similar to Rayneval on November 13 when he promised that as \"to the droit exclusif you can count on it, apart from the actual word, for we will give our Governors the most positive orders to safeguard the thing itself from interruption by the subjects of Britain.\" Referring to the preliminary articles in the course of preparation, the Secretary of State advised Fitzherbert that \"great pains had been taken to avoid mentioning the fishery as exclusive, and that the third Article had been cautiously worded for that purpose .. . [and that] it was very desirable ... that it should be left entirely out, and that the French should be contented with as strong assurances of not being molested as could be given them in the King's name.\" The third article of the preliminary treaty signed in January 1783 did not contain any reference to the nature of French rights in Newfoundland, but limited itself to a delineation of the new treaty shore. The \"strong assurances of not being molested\" were conveyed to the French in a note from Lord Grantham to Fitzherbert with the injunction that the ambassador could \"assure the French minister of the punctuality with which this engagement will be observed.\" In the course of negotiations for a definitive treaty the French attempted to have the term \"exclusive fishery\" inserted in the British declaration. When these attempts failed another tack was taken to achieve the same purpose. On June 18, 1783, the draft of the French counter declaration was sent to the British government which included the words \"la peche exclusive sur Jes cotes de Terre-Neuve.\" Instructions were then sent to the Duke of Manchester to insist upon the omission of the word \"exclusive,\" and if he failed, to present another British declaration in answer to the French counter declaration \"that the King of England did not mean to grant an exclusive fishery any otherwise than by\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n17\n\nordering his subjects not to molest by concurrence.\" The French government were dissuaded from this proposed counter declaration, and agreement was reached upon the wording of the final documents, which were signed on the same day as the Definitive Treaty of Peace, September 3, 1783. The question naturally arises at this point: What did the two declarations mean in relation to the nature of French rights on the treaty shore, and the extent of British responsibility to maintain them? All arguments, official and private, have been as attempts to force a large inflated balloon in too small a box. The British and French declarations represented, essentially, a compromise, and inherently such arrangements are dangerous. For their maintenance compromise was constantly necessary, which in this case meant repeated readjustment to changed circumstances. The most serious results of these declarations did not arise until after 1815, when for over seventy years the two governments sought to substitute further compromises in the form of less equivocal agreements. At the discussions of August 21, 1782, Vergennes informed Fitzherbert that France would not be satisfied with the restitution of St. Pierre and Miquelon because St. Pierre harbour was not commodious enough for the fishermen and warships of France. The islands were too far from the Gulf, and too small to support a large colony. If the west coast were ceded to France it would serve her fishermen as a base for the Gulf fisheries, but if the south coast were to remain British the value of St. Pierre would be diminished. Whatever island was ceded to France it must be in full sovereignty, and such a transfer would be regarded \"in the light of a conditio sine qua non.\" Vergennes suggested Belle Isle off the northeast coast, which \"directly opposite the scene of the Grand Bank fisheries could be a rendezvous for the French ships and a centre from which effective protection could be given.\" French experts quickly put Vergennes right in the matters of geography and strategy: Belle Isle was not opposite the Grand Bank fishery and suitable neither as a base for fishermen nor for naval vessels to protect them. He did not seem, therefore, very perturbed when Fitzherbert told him that the British government were finding great difficulty in accepting the idea of ceding an island other than St. Pierre, but he hoped that the restitution would not be burdened with the restrictions applied in 1763. British knowledge of certain parts of Newfoundland had considerably increased during the past twenty years. Captain Cook had made important surveys of the island, and one of the officers who accompanied him, a Lieutenant Lane, was sent for by Shelburne to give advice on the question of island strategy around Newfoundland. Lane stated that only Fogo Island was suitable for the purposes required by the French, but any possibility that this island would be ceded was dropped when the officer indicated that it could be effectively fortified and St. Pierre could not. Further, if it were decided to begin the treaty shore at Cape St. John, Fogo Island's proximity to the British coast would create another disadvantage. The sequel to these negotiations was the restitution of the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon to France. From this settlement the problem of St. Pierre and Miquelon takes on added complications. Article 6 of the Treaty of Paris, 1763, was definite that the islands were ceded only as a shelter for French fishermen, and were to remain unfortified. In 1783 these limitations were not renewed, for article 4 stated that \"The Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon ... are ceded in full right, by the present\n\n18\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nTreaty to His Most Christian Majesty.\" Had the matter ended there, the future colony of Newfoundland would have been relieved of an additional pretext for complaint. Unfortunately the last paragraph of the declaration asserted that \"the King of Great Britain, in ceding the Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon to France, regards them as ceded for the purpose of serving as a real shelter to the French fishermen, and in full confidence that these possessions will not become an object of jealousy between the two nations and that the fishery between the said Islands, and that of Newfoundland, shall be limited to the middle of the channel.\" This rider conferred upon posterity two exasperating riddles: What constituted a real shelter for French fishermen? And at what phase of development would the island colony become an object of jealousy? When the pertinent treaty stipulations were debated in Parliament violent arguments ensued. In support of the government some reasoned \"that peace on any terms, by breaking the powerful confederacy that was against us, and giving us time to recruit our wasted strength, was preferable to a continuance of the war,\" others that the peace needed no defence, its terms were \"fair and honourable\" and \"adequate to the just expectations of the nation.\" Notwithstanding the official view towards the declaration, Parliament believed that it implied an exclusive right for the French. The concession was defended on the grounds that simultaneously Great Britain had maintained for herself \"an exclusive right to the most valuable banks,\" and had obviated a further outbreak of unpleasant incidents by the policy of separate fisheries. The opposition were not persuaded to accept these justifications. They countered that from France had come the idea of exchanging part of the northeast coast for an extension on the west, and therefore, \"it was absurd to suppose that she had chosen for herself the worst stations.\" The west coast had the best fishing grounds and \"the concession was of a new and important nature, the consequences of which it was not easy to foresee.\" 13 After 1783 the French made every effort to exploit the fishery on the new shore. In 1785 the bounty system was reintroduced to encourage participation and offset the losses incurred by the industry and trade during the late war. The practical monopoly of the French West Indian trade was placed in Frerich hands by the grant of a bounty, and trade with Europe was encouraged by a bounty on dried fish sold in European markets and carried to the ports in French vessels. In view of the dangers present on the west coast, which had very few convenient and safe harbours, and to promote an interest in the newly acquired regions south of Point Riche, a special bounty ·was granted to all crews of ships fishing about the Bay of Islands. Abetted by these bounties the French soon secured a predominant position on the northeast and west coasts. Reasons for the reintroduction of the bounty system are to be found in the French government's concern for the welfare of their fishing population, and also in the continued survival of the idea that the fisheries about Newfoundland, particularly on the Banks, were the chief nursery for the seamen required for the navy. Notwithstanding these bounties and the monopoly of their home markets the French failed to maintain large numbers upon the treaty coast. Apart from the influences of extraordinary French domestic politics, and the gradual deteriora-\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n19\n\ntion of Anglo-French relations, there were certain other disadvantages native to the Newfoundland fisheries which contributed to a progressive diminution of French participation. Weather conditions and navigation on these northern and western shores were far more difficult than those experienced by Englishmen on their coasts, and by Frenchmen in their home areas and on the Banks. Furthermore, wages and provisions were not attractive enough to entice men to the distant regions of Newfoundland. Complaint was also made by the backers of these annual voyages that the skill of the French fishermen enlisted under the above conditions was not sufficient to enable them to secure a catch large enough to make their risks worth while, and under the terms of the treaty the French were not permitted to remain after September, a prohibition which hindered them in making necessary repairs on hshing rooms and gear during the winter in readiness for an early start the next season. Further, the presence of British transient fishermen on the treaty coast, and the pre-emption of the best fishing places by the settlers despite the periodic visits of British men-of-war, added to the annoyances endured by the French. Complaints from both sides poured into official ears, and there were enough valid ones to warrant an investigation by the Committee of Trade in 1786 at a time when the whole question of the Newfoundland fisheries was under review. 14 Unfortunately, before new instructions could be completed for Governor Elliot in accordance with the Committee's suggestions, the French had taken matters into their own hands by hustling British fishermen and merchants off the treaty coast. In certain of these actions the French navy was assisted by British naval officers; nor did Governor Elliot protest. His instructions left much to his discretion when they ordered him to assure to the French the full use of the fishery; and though they contained no committal by the British government to an exclusive fishery for the French, Elliot's failure to support the British fishermen's demand for a concurrent fishery appeared to endorse the claim of the French to fish there exclusively, to remove by force all British subjects found fishing, trading, sealing, or trapping there, and to order the removal or destruction of fixed settlements of all kinds whether or not they were erected for fishing purposes. Forcible removal of the English transient fishermen had its risks for the British government. It was considered directly contrary to 10 and 11 William III, c. 25, which guaranteed a free fishery to them at Newfoundland. Since 1720 settlers had gradually deflected the transients either to the Banks or Labrador, and in 1786 the French were forcibly moving them from their coasts where they tried to fish either on their way to or from Labrador. Under the direction of Pitt in 1788 an act (28 Geo. III, c. 35) was passed dealing with the problem of French participation. It did not declare France to have an exclusive fishery, nor make the visits of British fishermen to the treaty coast unlawful, but it did permit the King-in-Council to authorize the governor, or his officers, to suspend 10 and 11 William III, c. 25 and prevent where necessary the visits of British fishermen to French preserves. However, the act emphasized that only British naval officers had the right to compel British subjects to leave the French limits. New instructions were issued to the governor, to use force if necessary when recalcitrant British fishermen flouted his orders. At the same time Elliot was\n\n20\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\ndirected to prevent the French from salmon fishing beyond one-half mile up river mouths, and to enforce against the French the limitations imposed upon them by treaty. Notwithstanding its de facto support of nearly all their claims, and its obvious disadvantages to the British transient and settler, the French were far from overjoyed with the act. They could claim that by the actions of their naval forces in 1786, and largely without British support they had virtually created an exclusive fishery; the act, therefore, only confirmed the status quo. As for the stipulation that only British officers could exercise jurisdiction on the treaty shore, it crimped the ambition of the French to obtain for their officers an extra-territorial authority, for by 1788 it was obvious that France desired to exercise sovereignty over her shore. Time was too short. Within five years France was again at war with Great Britain, French fishermen were driven from Newfoundland, St. Pierre and Miquelon were seized in a raid from St. John's, and their colonists despatched to France. Often more interesting than wars are their by-products. To a considerable degree the settled colony in Newfoundland was an incident of the imperial wars between Great Britain and France. Especially is this the case in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic struggles. Legally the fishery remained circumscribed by King William's law until 1824; professedly the governors, merchants, judges, magistrates, and naval surrogates practised their vocations to maintain the sacrosanct transiency of the fishery; but practically the press gangs and the innumerable risks of war gradually transmuted Newfoundland, a \"fief of the admiralty,\" a \"fishing ship anchored off the banks,\" into a number of communities which the return of peace could not dislodge. French rights and French fishermen disappeared from the shores of Newfoundland and the isles of St. Pierre and Miquelon, leaving the north Atlantic fisheries in the hands of the island-based Englishmen and New Englanders. Before peace returned in 1815 the Mediterranean markets were wholly supplied by the Anglo-American merchants, by and large the provision trade to Newfoundland had become a monopoly of New England, and the centre of resistance of French ambitions had moved from the English West Country to the street which ran along the north side of St. John's harbour. An imperial act (31 Geo. III, c. 29) was passed on May 26, 1791, to establish a Court of Civil Jurisdiction in Newfoundland. This was achieved by Lord Thurlow against mercantile opposition, but with the support of Sir Archibald MacDonald, the attorney general, who felt that the small fishermen needed an impartial court to save them from the domination of the merchants still backed by 10 and 11 William III, c. 25, the embodiment of summary justice. The act was an experiment to endure for a year only. It came up for review in 1792 when certain reforms were put forward by John Reeves, the first chief justice, and incorporated in a new act (32 Geo. III, c. 46). Pitt had found it convenient during the course of the debates on the second bill to promise the merchants a parliamentary enquiry into the Newfoundland trade and fishery. At the enquiry in 1793 the merchants urged their old arguments against the courts and prophesied a decline of the fishery. In their unshakable opposition to settlers they were supported by Sir Hugh Palliser and William Knox, who tenaciously clung to the argument that a colony could endanger Newfoundland's usefulness as a nursery\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n21\n\nfor seamen, and loosen imperial control over the fishery. It was further urged that the new court, instead of simplifying the course of justice, would in time complicate it by encouraging a permanent population which in due course would advance claims at variance with the principles of a transient fishery. No tangible conclusions came from the enquiry, but a great deal of evidence was placed before the committee in favour of a settled community. Any changes contemplated had to be postponed upon the outbreak of war with France in 1793, but the Court of Judicature remained. Though created as a bulwark of the ancient fishery, as epitomized in William Ill's law, it also supported, albeit unintentionally, the feeble structure of a colony. The chief weakness of the new system was that it only operated during the presence of the governor, which was for about two months during the summer. When the United States entered the war in 1812, the resident fishery largely managed its own affairs, for all three rivals, embroiled in war, were unable to prosecute the trade and fishery, or to dominate the destiny of the island. The population increased from between ten and twenty thousand to between sixty and seventy thousand; and the extent and value of the fishery increased enormously, so that in the season of 1813-14 it reached close to £3,000,000. Following the submission of the French, Newfoundland was drawn into the economic depression which became general in Europe, and one hundred bankruptcies occurred in St. John's alone between 1815 and 1817; a Europe impoverished could no longer pay high prices for dried cod, hence the Mediterranean markets shrank alarmingly; and the state of the colony was not improved when the peace treaties of 1815 15 brought back to the islanders their recent enemies, the French and Americans. In 1817 the plight of the colony was brought to the notice of Parliament. A select committee were given several reasons 16 to account for the chronic state of the colony: Spain and other Mediterranean countries had increased their import duties upon dried cod, and France, to encourage her fisheries for the benefit of the navy and trade, had reintroduced large bounties not only on ships and men employed in the industry, but also on dried cod exported from France to other countries. These bounties enabled French merchants to undersell their Newfoundland rivals, and to regain their Mediterranean markets. Several witnesses complained that in total disregard of requests from merchants engaged in the trade France had been restored to her west coast fisheries by the treaty of 1815, \"by far the most favourable part of the whole island, for the prosecution of the fishery.\" As there was no going back upon the treaty with France, therefore, the only remedies suggested by the witnesses were the forcible removal of between five and ten thousand distressed people (who were mainly Irish), and the restitution of bounties to British fishermen to offset the advantage gained by the French with their own bounty-fed fishery. It is not difficult to see the influence of the West Country merchants in this report. As one would expect they tried to recover control of the fisheries, but the attempt was luckless and the governmental policy which in the eighteenth century had supported their ambitions was not revived. The British government's refusal to grant a bounty on their exertions spelled doom to their direct participation, though they made an appeal to the hoary sentiment that the fishery was a nursery of seamen, an appeal considered by one member of Parliament as \"an\n\n22\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nargument that had borne on its back the impolitic regulations of centuries, and that was always at hand to sanction every unwise measure proposed for extending our commerce.\" Whether they would have been more successful if the British government had not been engrossed in continued crisis is a moot point, and perhaps impossible to resolve. Gradually West Country competition in the fishery and its collective opposition to settlement became negligible factors. Fortunately domestic and world conditions improved, and though the colony for the next few decades could not be called a roaring success, important steps were taken to consolidate the advantages secured by the residents since 1791, among them the repeal of all legal obstructions against settlement, especially 10 and 11 William III, c. 25. Any hope that the French would be satisfied with a concurrent fishery was soon dispelled. After the war the British Newfoundland squadron was considerably reduced in the name of economy, an action which could not but benefit the French whose fishing industry was generously aided by a deliberate and determined policy formulated by their government. Frenchmen, wherever they were, on land or sea, were considered to be subject to French laws made to regulate \"juge de paix\" among themselves. In the case of Newfoundland these laws purported \"to restrict the liberty of British subjects in British waters,\" and the naval forces of France were used to enforce them. The treaty of 1713 had laid down the restrictions which were to circumscribe the building activities of the French on the shore, but these restrictions had been early and openly circumvented, not merely upon the whim of the fishermen, but according to mandate from France. It is possible the French considered they had good reason for disregarding the letter and spirit of the treaties, for between 1793 and 1815, when the French were completely excluded from the fishery, a number of British settlers ensconced themselves within the former French limits, so that when the French resumed their fishery in 1815 a new system had arisen, entirely at variance with the declaration of 1783. The real determination of the French to make a success of their north Atlantic fishery is seen in their system of bounties and tariffs, which after 1815 was revived and extended. It was against these bounties and tariffs that complaints were raised as long as a French problem existed in Newfoundland. In 1814 a tariff of 40 francs per 100 kilos imposed upon foreign fish imported into France gave the French fishery a monopoly of the home market, and a bounty of 50 francs per man was granted in 1816 for three years to vessels engaged in the fishery at St. Pierre and the treaty shore. On the fish trade itself there were the following bounties: 24 francs per quintal upon dried cod exported to French colonies in French vessels; 12 francs per quintal for dried cod similarly shipped to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and the Levant from French ports, and 10 francs if sent to these countries direct from the fishing grounds. In 1818 the bounty on fish shipped to the colonies was increased to 40 francs per quintal. The Bank fishery benefited in 1816 by a bounty of 15 francs per man to vessels engaged in it, increased in 1822 to 50 francs if the fish caught were dried in Newfoundland, and in 1829 to 30 francs if the catch were dried in France. Whereas in 1817 the bounty payments amounted to 365,000 francs, in 1829 they reached 4,400,000. One estimate of the French north Atlantic fishery in 1830 shows there were three to four hundred vessels, amounting to about 50,000 tons, employing some 12,000 men. The\n\nANGLO-FRENCH FISHERY IN NEWFOUNDLAND BEFORE\n\n1832\n\n23\n\naverage catch for five years previously was 245,000 quintals of which 27,000 went to the French West Indies, 17,000 to Mediterranean ports, and 160,000 to the French home market, from which 29,000 were re-exported. This burst of energy and an increased fishery alarmed the Newfoundlanders, particularly when following the peace of 1815 the British government substituted vascillation for their traditional opposition to settlement. There was no doubt about the French interpretation of the treaty. Without British warships on the coast there was no deterrent to their assertion of sovereign rights, which took the form of ordering British settlers from places they had occupied before French rights had been restored. Nor did the governor possess any instructions to prevent such action. In 1822 Governor Hamilton acted upon his own initiative and issued a proclamation that the French were \"to have full and complete enjoyment of the fishery within the limits and boundaries in the manner they are entitled to enjoy the same under the said Treaty of Utrecht.\" Legal or not, this proclamation was to be a source of embarrassment to British governments throughout the century. The French government, and French historians, have repeatedly referred to it as definite proof that the British government acknowledged the establishment of an exclusive fishery for the French. Perhaps it was not so far from the official British sentiment in the matter, because no angry letter reached Hamilton from his superiors demanding an immediate abrogation of the proclamation. This supposition appears to have some support in an act (4 and 5 Geo. IV, c. 51) passed in 1824, which recognized a settled colony in Newfoundland, prohibited aliens from fishing in her waters (except the French and Americans), but by section 12 empowered the British government to issue instructions to the governor to put into effect the terms of 28 George III, c. 35, and legalized Hamilton's proclamation of 1822. On the Newfoundland claim for a concurrent fishery Huskisson declared in 1827, \"it had been judged expedient, for the purposes of avoiding the risk of unpleasant collision to abstain from acting upon a claim which may yet be considered as open to be enforced.\" For the time being Newfoundland was to be a colony in irons; it could move its head and arms, but it could not walk about, least of all in the direction of the French limits. Thoroughly exasperated with the French, the St. John's Chamber of Commerce formulated their own interpretation of the treaties, and decided to put the matter to test. They told Governor Cochrane of their intention to send a fishing ship to the French limits and asked for protection, which he refused. A direct appeal was made to Sir George Murray, the colonial secretary, in which the hardships imposed by French intransigence were carefully emphasized, and the intention to despatch a ship was made known. Murray made no reply. Undeterred, in 1829 the Hannah was sent on her way to Quirpon with orders to assert the British right to a concurrent fishery. French reaction to this crusade was immediate and unmistakable. The crew of the Hannah were treated courteously by the French commander of the naval schooner Philomele-but under no circumstances would he permit them to fish on the treaty coast. M. Seyers, a French armateur with an establishment at Croque, informed them (no doubt for the benefit of the Chamber of Commerce) that on the treaty shore the French had an exclusive right, the Americans had no rights, British subjects were encouraged on the shore only when French property required a winter caretaker, and if necessary force would be\n\n24\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\napplied to evict either British or American fishermen caught trespassing on French preserves. Governor Cochrane concluded that with so many Frenchmen on the shore it was unwise to allow a concurrent fishery, for no Britisher could fish without interfering, and even if a concurrent fishery were legal, interference was not. Though he protested to the French against their claim to use force in an area undex British sovereignty, his computation of the number of French ships and fishermen on the treaty coast led him to endorse the wisdom of two separate fisheries as the only way to avoid repeated provocations. Meanwhile in the House of Commons, Lord Howick, the under-secretary for the colonies, announced the govemment's dilatory dictum: \"It should be recollected that the right to fish [on the treaty shore] was disputed by the French, and the treaty of 1783, and the declaration which was made subsequently, in consequence of that treaty, rendered it extremely doubtful that the English possessed any such right. At all events, the question was still a matter of doubt; and while it remained undecided, the Government could not act as ... desired.\" 17 Such counsel afforded no backing to the colony, and without physical and moral support it did not possess a ghost of a chance to assert a concurrent fishery in the face of French fishermen, who filled all the worth-while harbours and fished all the possible fishing grounds. For the nonce the initiative was with the French. Slightly more than a month before Lord Howick's statement in the House of Commons, Talleyrand had written to Loi d Palmerston claiming that \"la France a un droit de pecherie dans un espace determine des cotes de l'isle de Terre-Neuve, que ce droit est exclusif et que par consequent ii ne peut eprouver aucune concurrence de la part des armateurs Anglais ....\" 18 Thus, by 1832 when Newfoundland was granted representative government, the right which Vergennes had coveted, and against which Pitt had thundered, was appropriated by French armateurs. Like it or not, the treaty coast had become the \"French shore.\"\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nTHE FRENCH AND A NASCENT COLONY BY THE BEGINNING of the nineteenth century the settled parts of eastern Newfoundland had experienced a struggle of two centuries between the resident and the European transient, a contest which took place within the larger conflict among the powers of Europe for control of this cod-bound island. In 1815 all but the formalities were over, and under the British Crown the settlers' triumph was conceded. The transient did not completely disappear, but he was no longer the favoured ward of official policy; law, order, and good government were introduced in the place of naval feudalism. Those who owned or rented small boats fit only for the shore fishery could not each autumn return in them to Europe; therefore they remained and gradually inherited the island and the adjoining sea. Between Cape St. John passing by the south and Cape Ray, the coast and the settlers were subject to the undisputed sovereignty of Britain, but soon Englishmen, Irishmen, Scots, and French called themselves Newfoundlanders. The victory of the colonists was geographically limited, and the mark of circumscription was set upon all their progress throughout the nineteenth century. From Cape St. John, passing by the north to Cape Ray, according to article 13 of the Treaty of Utrecht, the coast was also British, but in practice this sovereignty was hedged about by concessions imposed by agreements with France and the United States of America. Squatters, unwanted by Britain and France, came to live upon that long shore, where for decades they had no government, law, or organized social life. In fact, as far as different times and divergent circumstances allow, the old contests began all over again. Population on the treaty shore, during the period of this chapter, increased steadily until it was considerable enough to alter fundamentally the course of history envisaged in the agreements between Britain and France. For the full maintenance of French rights, and for a minimum of diplomatic friction between the two powers, an empty shore was a necessity, but the virtual absence of British authority, and the temporary absence of the French annually, allowed a persistent encroachment upon a coast which possessed several natural advantages. There were no organized scrambles for territory, no steady columns treking from the east, nor any railroads to rush the homesteaders to the empty places. The Newfoundlanders did not think in terms of waggons, horses, or steam trains, but in terms of boats and schooners. They did not move from valley to valley until the westward shore was reached but went bv sea in their craft and landed in convenient places, where they stayed if not molested. To the few trappers, Indians and odd men out, they bequeathed the interior, for they preferred to live mainly with their faces to the sea. Most of the western liveyers were born in Newfoundland, either on the treaty shore or in the older settlements of east and south. The remainder, like the older colonists, were a mixed lot from England, Ireland, Scotland, the Channel Islands,\n\n26\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nNova Scotia, Quebec, St. Pierre, France, and even the American republic. Many of French stock have their descendants in the west today: the Blanchards, Le Blancs, Landrys, Benoits, and Cormiers. By the 1880's it was difficult to find on the entire shore an empty harbour, cove, bight, or arm in which there was not at least one family, but the greater concentrations grew on the west coast, along the Codroy Rivers, about St. George's Bay, among the Bay of Islands, up the reaches of the Humber River, and at Bonne Bay. At these places a new society began, developed, and reached its climax not as an Anglo-French condominium, nor as a colony independent and self-contained, but as an integrated part of the established colony of Newfoundland, although for a very long time the residents on the northeast coast, which was most frequented by the French, remained little more than winter keepers of French property. A glance at a late nineteenth-century map of the treaty coast will show how thoroughly the shore was settled, and reveal its Anglo-French legend. 1 At the turn of the English constitutional tide in 1832 the level of Newfoundland's government was raised and an assembly was granted; though perhaps the decline of her importance in Imperial considerations contributed to this more than the steady pressure of local interests. For a generation the advocates of constitutional change had argued and pamphleteered in favour of a local legislature, and against the diarchy of naval and mercantile administration. It was claimed that representation ought to be coexistent with taxation, a resident community could no longer be accommodated by laws devised for a transient fishery, and only a local parliament could adequately frame laws to meet the island's needs. The existing system of government denied to the colonists a voice in their welfare and the spending of their taxes; roads and bridges were needed to connect the outports with each other and St. John's, and lighthouses were needed to make coastal navigation safer; an increasing population required more than a fluctuating cod fishery to support it, and therefore agriculture and other resources in the island ought to be exploited. 2 The proclamation for summoning the assembly specified the several electoral districts but no part of the treaty coast was mentioned, though Cochrane's Commission and Instructions included the whole island and its dependencies. Two years later a local bill was passed to allow increased representation wherein one member was to be provided for the St. George's Bay area, but royal assent was withheld ostensibly because the British government wished to await the figures of the next census. The real reason, however, was Imperial objections to any representation of the treaty shore; this decision was concordant with the indeterminate British policy towards the nature of French rights between Cape Ray and Cape St. John, but so early in the legislature's existence it was not a pressing inconvenience. However, the new assembly did not suffer from many doubts about the Anglo-French treaties. Though legally obliged to recognize them, physically compelled to submit to French interpretations and suffer British vacillation, from the beginning it held to a policy which reduced French rights to a minimum. It was not long before that minimum was expressed in the words of Reeves, the first chief justice of Newfoundland, a man much honoured for his early espousal of the colonial cause, that the French had \"nothing more than a license to come and go during the fishing season.\" A great deal of time passed before the new legislature spoke in an authoritative tone to the commissions ap-\n\nTHE FRENCH AND A NASCENT COLONY\n\n27\n\npointed at intervals to seek a compromise, but the existence of a legislature was in itself a great advantage to the colonists. It was a centre around which opposition was rallied, and a meeting place in which views were expressed often unflattering to France and England. This sort of organized opposition, absent when the West Countrymen were the chief protagonists, was used with gradually increasing power and skill, though frequently without finesse. Guichard, in summing up his survey of the Newfoundland fisheries since the fifteenth century, declared that: \"Cependent l'ile de Terre-Neuve prenait de jour en jour un plus grand essor. Sa population, accrue clans de notables proportions, se montra bientot exigeante: elle reclama du gouvernement britannique l'institution d'un Parlement, ce qui lui fut accorde en 1832. A partir de cette epoque commence une nouvelle phase de la question de Terre-Neuve.\" 3 Consequent upon questioning in the House of Commons in June 1832, Poulett Thomson, treasurer of the navy and vice-president of the Board of Trade, promised to take the opinion of the Law Officers on the subject of French rights in Newfoundland, but first the Board of Trade were consulted. Their conclusions, and consequent counter-opinions upon them, reveal the wavering condition of the British offical mind. Referring to the crucial negotiations for the agreements with France in 1783, the Board averred: \"The fact seems scarcely disputable that, at that period of almost unexampled depression, Great Britain was induced to concede a very popular and favourite privilege, but that, shrinking from a public avowal of their own act, the British negotiators took the course of substituting an explanatory Declaration for an express Article in the Treaty.\" The Board's interpretation of the act of 1788 left no doubt about their views upon the nature of French rights. It \"authorised his majesty to give such orders as he should deem necessary to fulfill the purposes of the Treaty and Declaration, and, if necessary to that end, to remove any works, for the purposes of the fishery, erected on that part of the coast . . . in question, and all ships and vessels belonging to the King's subjects to depart from thence.\" Further the \"enactment was considered as a parliamentary command upon the Treaty and Declaration, and as affording evidence that the real meaning was to give to the French an exclusive right of fishery in which the British could not participate.\" Finally, the Board suspected that the government's reason for supporting the American contention of concurrent right to fish on ,the west coast was an attempt to secure a release from the promise which gave France the exclusive claim, because the American concurrent right, once recognized by France, would inferentially confer it on the British by reason of the wording of the Anglo-American treaties. In October 1836, the French ambassador in London, Count Sebastiani, again raised the claims of his government. He reminded Lord Palmerston of Talleyrand's letter of May 19, 1831, which contained earnest entreaty \"contre la violation de notre droit exclusif de peche sur une certain portion de la cote de TerreNeuve,\" stated categorically that concurrence \"est formellement interdite par la texte meme de la declaration annexee au traite du 3 Septembre 1783,\" and called for an immediate settlement. Once more the Foreign Office placed the problem before the Law Officers because \"all the circumstances necessary for forming a conclusive opinion upon the question were not brought sufficiently under [their] notice ... upon the occasion on which the previous report was made.\" \"All the circumstances necessary\" referred to a thirty-two page memorandum of close\n\n28\n\nTHE FRENCH SHORE PROBLEM IN NEWFOUNDLAND\n\nreasoning prepared by Hertslet of the Foreign Office, and based on official correspondence concerning the several peace treaties with France dealing with the Newfoundland fisheries. Hertslet argued that the Board of Trade and the French ambassador had based their arguments on the interpretation of the Treaty of Versailles and the declaration of 1783, and not upon the intention of the British government at the time (which still remained the opinion of the Foreign Office), which was to give the French an uninterrupted fishery without specifically denying the concurrent right of the British, obviously implicit in Britain's sovereignty. For France to assert that Britain had granted her an exclusive right in 1783 was to accuse her of bad faith with the United States, for on the same day that France supposedly received exclusive rights, the Americans were granted concurrence on a similar shore alongside British subjects. The French had the shore practically to themselves, and so far their treaty rights had not been called in question, so why not remain quiet? \"The reason is obvious. They think that the moment is favourable for obtaining a recognition of their pretention, and they fear that there may be a danger in delay.\" The British government, he went on, had themselves to blame for the \"favourable moment,\" because every occurrence in England which had a bearing on the question had encouraged French confidence; the continuation of restrictions against British subjects on the treaty coast after 1815 even though the declaration of 1783 and the act of 1788 were annulled by war; the repeated refusals given to applications to allow British subjects to fish on the shore; the act of 1824 which virtually resurrected the act of 1788; the debates in the Commons from which it was inferred the British government declined to accede to the above applications because compliance might be incompatible with French engagements; and finally the tacit submission to French assertion of legal authority within a territory under British jurisdiction. Hertslet concluded that France had never been given an exclusive right, though a concurrent fishery might be impracticable. The influence of Hertslet's reasoning was revealed in the second report of the Law Officers, sent to Palmerston on April 17, 1837. This admitted that the previous report had gone beyond the point warranted by circumstances, and repeated the opinion that Great Britain, on the basis of past treaties and acts of Parliament, was bound to permit the French to fish on the treaty coast without interruption; but the following awkward qualification was added: \"If there were really good room within the limits of the District in question, for the Fishermen of both Nations to fish without interfering with each other, then we do not think that this country would be bound to prevent Her subjects from fishing there. It appears, however . . . that this is hardly practicable, and we are of the opinion that according to the true construction of the Treaty and Declaration, British subjects are precluded from fishing, if they thereby cause any interruption to the French fishery.\" By implication this report seemed to support the policy of separation, which if put into effect would endorse French claims to an exclusive fishery in practice if not in principle. Yet, with one hand on the Law Officers' report and the other on Hertslet's memorandum, Lord Palmerston delivered to France the least indefinite pronunciamento upon the nature of French and British rights on the treaty coast that had thus far come from the pen of a responsible minister:\n\nTHE FRENCH AND A NASCENT COLONY\n\n29\n\nIt is true that the privilege secured to the fishermen of France by the Treaty and Declaration of 1783, a privilege which consists in the periodical use of a part of the shore of Newfoundland, for the purpose of drying their fish, has in practice been treated by the British Government as an exclusive right during the fishing season, and within the limits prescribed; because, from the nature of the case, it would scarcely be possible for British fishermen to dry their fish upon the same parts of the shore with the French fishermen without interfering with the temporary establishments of the French for the same purpose, and without interrupting their operations. But the British Government has never understood the Declaration to have for its object to deprive the British subjects of the right to participate with the French in taking fish at sea, off that shore, provided they did so without interrupting the French cod fishery; and, although in accordance with the true spirit of the Treaty and Declaration of 1783, prohibitory proclamations have been from time to time issued, on occasions when it has been found that British subjects, while fishing within the limits in question have caused interruption to the French fishery, yet in none of the public documents of the British Government, neither in the Act of Parliament of 1788, passed for the express purpose of carrying the Treaty of 1783 into effect; nor in any of the instructions issued by the Admiralty and the Colonial Office; nor in any proclamation which has come under my view, issued by the Government of "
