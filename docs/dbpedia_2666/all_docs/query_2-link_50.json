Faith is a good thing usually, but Guiteau's faith that he will not be hung is liable to be rudely shaken soon.

It is destroying the Republican Weekly. Many gubernatorial booms have expired .\n\nIt is believed that his Decoration day in New York Bob Ingersoll will \"tread apon somebody's toes.\" Very likely. It will aot be the first either.

It gives them some valuable advertising. Some politicians lie awake nights devising schemes to keep their names before the public. Senator Crowley of Middlesex paid a fine tribute to General Butler in the Legislature yesterday when he said: \"'The image of Ben Butler is before the eyes of some legislators who would otherwise vote for increasing galaries and who actually needed more pay.\" Now that is handsome.

A New York State man who recently tried a Hiving machine of his own invention had no advice to give to those who crowded around. All he said was: \"Work in 'durned fool' somewhere on my tombstone!\" Strikes involve a tremendous waste of money and of productive power, which must be felt sooner or later in the general condition of business .\n\nIf it is disheartening now, we may be very sure that a waste of several millions each week by idleness of workmen will not make it better.

I don't believe Mrs. Spriggins will mind.\" This remark did not seem to encourage or soothe constable, but he made no remark. He went into the house, and Mrs .\n\nSprigging followed him when he came out. Tarbox,\" she said, \"vou're real mean to get my husband into trouble.\" \"How have I got him into trouble demanded Tarbox doggedly. \"You want to get him into a fight a giant. He ain't fit to wrestle with any one, bein' in poor health, least of all a giant.\" he a officer of the law? That's what I want to know,\" said Tarbox, \"Why, yes.\" \"Then let him do his duty. I've put a warrant into his bands, and Squire Price and I expeat him to execute it.\" \"Suppose he's killed?\" suggested Mrs .\n\nSpriggins. Her husband looked nervous at the possibility hinted at, but Tarbox was inexorable. \"Then you can be proud of his dyin' while doin' his duty. Come, constable, I've no time to waste. Come along!\" \"You're real mean!\" ejaculated Mrs .\n\nSpriggins, teartully. Tarbox deigned no answer, but strode out of the yard, followed by the reluctant constable. Few words were said, but when they were half way to the circus grounds a bright idea struck Spriggins. \"I say, Mr. Tarbox,\" he said, eagerly, \"can't we compromise this thing?\" don't know what you mean.\" \"You might authorize me to say to the giant in a friendly kind of way that your feelin's are hurt, that it's probably all a misunderstandin', and propose to make up.\" \"Spriggins, are you 8 fool? Do you think I'm goin' to compromise after I've been shaken almost to pieces and my dog has been kicked to death?\" \"He might agree to buy you a new dog, if it was properly set before \"A new dog wouldn't make up for Bruiser .\n\nHe scared all the children in the neighborhood. I shan't see his like again.

At length they came in sight of the circus grounds. Around the big tent were congregated a crowd of men and boys, and a stream of people was already marching up to the DOX office to buy tickets, while hitched to trees and posts were carriages and wagons of all descriptions which had been employed to convey intending spectators from the town about. Nothing draws like a circus in the country, or perhaps we may add in the city also. goin' to be a crowd,\" remarked the constable .\n\n\"Yes; fools tand their money are soon parted.

Instead of going up to the ticket office to purchase tickets they passed and reached the doorway where stood a man to receive tickets. Where's your tickets?\" demanded he of Spriggins and his companion. Mr. Sprigging turned to Tarbox expecting him to explain .\n\ndon't need no tickets,\" said he in an impressive manner. man in an officer of the law.\" \"No deadheads- -no free list,\" said the tickettaker shortly. \"Stand don't understand me,\" said Tarbox. is Constable Spriggins, and he demands admission in the name of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\" United States don't own this show, nor yet the State of Massachusetts.

He can't get in without a ticket.\" see how 'tis,\" said Spriggins, cheerfully. can't get in.\" your way in!\" said Tarbox, indignantly. \"You've got the law on your side.\" This the constable positively refused to do .\n\n\"Then buy a ticket and go in. The State will pay you back.\" no call to do it, and I don't believe I'd get my money back.\" refuse to do your duty, do you?\" \"No, I don't. I've tried, and I can't. You know how it is yourself.\" Mr. Tarbox was nonplussed .\n\nHe didn't like to give up his cherished scheme of vengeance, yet how was he to carry it out? \"I'll tell you what I'll he said, buy you a ticket, and trust to the State to pay me.\" \"You can't collect it of me,\" said the constable, \"even if the State don't pay you.\" You can buy me a ticket if you want But Tarbox was seized with a sudden suspicion. Spriggin might go in and see the show at his expense, and leave his duty unperformed. There was nothing to do but to go in with him, and that would involve the purchase of two tickets, and the expenditure of an entire dollar, which Tarbox, who was a close man, could not think of without mentally groaning. Nevertheless, his soul thirsted for revenge, and it was clear that revenge could not be had without expense. \"Spriggins,\" he said, \"I'll buy two tickets, and we'll go in together.\" The constable would bave preferred to go in alone .\n\nHe wanted to see the show, and if he had been unaccompanied he could have done so without any troublesome duties disturbing his enjoyment. \"Jest as you say,\" he answered, a little nervously. Mr. Tarbox joined the line, and gradually worked his way to the ticket office. couple of tickets,\" he said, banding a dollar bill to the ticket agent .\n\nTwo tickets were linmediately passed to him, and he and the constable entered the tent. Opposed as he was to the circus, Tarbox could not forbear looking about him with considerable curiosity. They were not yet in the main room, the cages animals. Mr. Tarbox started as an but were in, an outer lobby where were ranged African lion, whose cage he was passing, roared, and be regarded with some apprehension the gratings of the cage .\n\n\"It's rather resky,\" he said. \"Suppose the lions or tigers should break out.\" The constable trembled at the suggestion, but still seemed interested in looking about bim. \"Come, Mr. he said, \"let's go and look at the elephants.\" \"Do you think I came here to see elephants?\" he said, sternly. \"Constable, I call upon you to do your duty.\" \"How can' asked the constable; \"I don't see the giant.\" One of the canvas men happened to be passing, and Mr .\n\nTarbox, rightly concluding that he was connected with the show, asked, Enoch?\" \"Enoch!\" repeated the canvas man, staring; guess you're off. I don't know any Enoch.\" \"I mean the Norwegian giant.\" 40h!\" said the attendant, smiling, \"You just follow round to the left, and you'll see him. He's sittin' next to the fat lady.\" \"Constable,\" said Mr. Tarbox, grasping his companion by the arm, \"we are on the scent. Come along, and we'll see what the villain has to say to the law.\" CHAPTER VI .\n\nTARBOX IS DEFEATED. The performance had not commenced- -indeed, half an hour would elapse betore the hour fixedand several of the performers were to be seen among the spectators about the cages of the animals. One of these Tarbox recognized. \"Look at that boy he said, clutching the constable's arm. He pointed to Robert Rudd and Charlie Davis, the two young ridere, who were walking together .\n\nof him?\" asked Spriggins. the young villain that was with Enoch.\" Spriggins inwardly wished that the warrant was for Robert instead of the giant. \"Why didn't you arrest him instead of the he asked. \"Perbaps will yet, for he trespassed on my grounds; but it was Enoch that up and killed Bruiser. Look here, young feller,\" he said, addressing Robert .\n\nRobert turned and smiled as he recognized the farmer. its vou;\" he answered. ex, it's me,\" answered Tarbox, sternly. \"Where's Enoch?\" \"Who do you mean?\" \"That overgrown brute that was with you this Charlie Davis asked a question in a low voice of Robert, and then turning to Tarbox before Robert bad a chance te answer bim asked, '19, you want to buy a dog, mister?\" \"You're too small! I don't want a puppy!\" answered Tarbox, scowling. \"OD, you're too answered Charlie, rather annoyed, perticularly as Robert laughed .\n\n\"Why don't you answer me, boy,\" demanded Tarbox, angrily. I will conduct you 1 to my friend, the Norwegian giant,\" answered Robert, politely. \"Come along, Spriggins!\" said Mr. Tarbox, pulling after him the reluctant constable. Spriggins would have enjoyed a leisurely wild examination of the Albino sisters, the man from Borneo, the living skeleton, and the fat whose soul was fired by the desire for but none of them had attractions for Mr .\n\nlady, All massive too soon dignity they sat reached Anak, the the chair NorAs wegian Anak's rested on the approaching visgiant. eyes itors, he looked amused. \"I'm glad to see you, my friend,\" he called out, in the deep tones natural to him, to Tarbox. \"And I'm glad to see you.\" said Tarbox, spitefully. \"I came here expressly to see you.\" \"You're very kind,\" gaid Anak .\n\n\"Take a good look. There aint so much of me as there is of my Mme. Leonora, with a wave of the band friend, towards the fat ladv. but you can look at me much as you want \"I shall soon see you prison cell,\" said Mr. Tarbox, sternly .\n\nSpriggins, do your duty, sir.\" Poor Spriggins gazed at the immense man before him, with his heart gradually sinking down into his boots. Never in all his life had he been placed in such an embarrassing position. What utter nonsense it was for him to think of leading out such a monster by the collar. Why, he couldn't begin to reach up to Anak's collar. \"Can't we compromise this thing,\" he asked, faintly .\n\nNo, we can't, Spriggins; I insist upon your doin' your duty.\" \"What do you want?\" asked Anak, in some curiositv. \"Produce your warrant, Spriggins,\" said TarDox. The constable mechanically drew it out from his inside pocket. Tarbox saw that he must take the initiative, and be was perfectly willing to do so. he said, \"this man is an officer of the law .\n\nHe has a warrant for your arrest.\" \"For my arrest?\" inquired Anak, opening his eyes in amazed surprize. \"Yes, for assault and battery on me, Nathan Tarbox, and the murder of my dog, Bruiser. Such things can be done in Norway, p'r'aps, but they ain't allowed in the State of Massachusetts. Spriggins, do your duty.\" The constable looked at the giant uncomfortably, and edged away a little. said Anak, shaking his sides, \"does he want to arrest me?\" \"Yes,\" said 1 Tarbox grimly .\n\n\"Spriggins, read the warrant.\" it yourself, Mr. Tarbox.\" Tarbox did so with evident enjoyment, but Anak's enjoyment seemed no less. ho, ho!\" he shouted. is a i joke!\" \"You won't find it much of a joke,\" said Tarbox. \"Come, Spriggins, do your duty.\" Enoch,\" said the constable, in a trembling voice .\n\n\"if you'll come with me without making any fuss, I'll see that you are well treated.\" \"Suppose I don't,\" said Anak. Spriggins looked helplessly at Tarbox. That was a question he could not answer. it'll be the worse for you,\" said Tarbox, who was always ready to make up for his companion's deticiencies. \"Can't you wait till the performance is over?\" asked the giant, smiling .\n\nbe sure.\" said Spriggins, quickly. \"Anything to oblige.\" said Tarpox, decidedly. warrant must be served now. You have no discretion.\" like to oblige the gentleman,\" said the constable, who wanted to avoid trouble and see the performance. \"You can't .\n\nIt won't be allowed.\" \"What's the use of losing the benefit of our money, Mr. Tarbox?\" \"That's my consider affair. it I wicked don't want nt. to see the circus. a snare lure souls to Satan .\n\n\"But I don't; you can go, you know,\" suggested Sprigging. \"No; I shall stay here to see that you do your duty.\" \"You have no charge over me,\" said the constable, with some spirit. the same you need looking after. Enoch, if you defy the law you'll find is the worse for you. This ain't Norway.\" we've got no such fools as you in Norway,\" retorted the giant .\n\n\"Tell me what you want.\" Tarbox whispered to Spriggins. The latter in a tremulous voice said, \"Enoch, I arrest you in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I require you to come with Ine once.\" \"Come and take me,\" said Anak, his broad face relaxing with a smile. do you mean?\" asked Tarbox, quickly. mean that I shan't stir from this chair. My contract with this show requires me to sit here .\n\nIf the constable wants me, be must take me by force. He needn't be afraid. If be can take me he may. Even Tarbox looked rather non-plussed. Both he and Spriggins together would have found it impossible to carry off a giant weighing over four hundred pounds .\n\nsee, we'll have to give it up,\" said Spriggins, with evident pleasure. \"You're glad of it said Tarbox suspiciously. \"Yon don't wan't to do your duty.\" tried to do it, and it's no use,\" said the constable with a little show of spirit. I bad the strength of a yoke of oxen, I might do something; as it is. I better come quietly, Enoch,\" said TarDox, his own courage beginning to fail .\n\nA crowd bad collected about the two, and derisive smiles and remarks greeted the lamentable failure of Tarbox's scheme of revenge. a wheelbarrow, mister,\" said a boy, from a neighboring town. you better try a derrick?\" suggested a man beside him. \"You must be a lunatic!\" said another. \"We'd better go, Mr .\n\nsaid Spriggins, uncomfortably. won't stir,\" said Tarbox, looking around him with a scowl, I see that warrant served. I wish I was a constable.\" wouldn't be healthy for you, old man!\" said Charlie Davis, who, with Robert. had been drawn to the scene, and heard the colloquy. \"I'd make you healthy if I bad you with me for a few minutes,\" said Tarbox, scowling .\n\nyou: you're very kind, but my time is too valuable.\" said Charlie. is all this?\" asked a voice of authority. It was the voice of the manager, who had been attracted by the crowd as he was going his rounds. matter is that we've got a warrant for this man's arrest!\" said Tarbox, pointing to the \"Show me your warrant!\" It was handed him. He smiled as he read it, and handing it back remarked, warrant is mere waste paper, \"Why is it?\" asked Tarbox, defiantly .\n\n\"Because there is no such man as Enoch in this show.\" \"Isn't that his name?\" asked Tarbox. \"No, it isn't. If you can find a man by that name you are welcome to take him.\" \"Crushed again,\" remarked Charlie Davis, mockingly. Tarbox made a grab for the boy's collar but failed to secure him. \"Come out, Spriggins,\" he said, in a tone of deep depression .\n\n\"You can go if you like,\" said the constable, independently; going to stay and see the show.\" BE CONTINUED MARINE NEWS.
