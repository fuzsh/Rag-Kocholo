All but one of these essays were first presented at an international conference, The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective/ which met on the downtown campus of the University of Toronto in May 1991. The conference coincided with the landmark publication of a comprehensive three-volume history of pacifism to 1914 by Peter Brock, the doyen of peace history. Opening with an essay entitled Teter Brock as a Historian of World-wide Pacifism: An Appreciation/ this volume honours Brock's pioneering leadership and unmatched scholarly attainments in the field. Since their appearance early in this century, the words 'pacifist' and 'pacifism' have been used with various meanings, some of them contradictory. In the title of this book, 'pacifism' is taken to mean, in the words of Martin Ceadel, a belief that 'all participation in or support for war [isl wrong' (Thinking about Peace and War, Oxford, 1987). But some contributors use it in the broader sense of a 'doctrine that the abolition of war or violence is desirable and possible' (Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, seventh edition, 1982). Together these essays explore the ideas and activities, over two millennia, of persons and groups rejecting war and often urging nonviolent means of settling conflicts. They probe the limits and branches of pacifism and peace history, pacifist pioneering and the relationship of pacifism and internationalism, including its contemporary phase. The essays highlight new interpretations where various of these have emerged in recent studies. They address topics that have been previously neglected such as the role of women in peace thinking and\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\npeace movements and the idea of peace in non-Western thought and religions. Reflecting some of the main areas of contemporary scholarship in peace history, the essays are grouped in four major thematic divisions. The three essays of Part I, 'Approaches to Peace History/ explore conceptual issues and approaches in peace history. The eight essays in Part II, 'Christian Traditions of Pacifism and Non-resistance/ range quite widely from the problem of non-violence and war in the Early Church through the non-resistant traditions of the Mennonites and Brethren from the sixteenth century onwards to aspects of the Quaker peace witness down to the present day. Part III, 'Gandhi and the Indian Tradition of Non-violence/ surveys violent and non-violent impulses in Hindu and Buddhist thought and practice as well as aspects of Gandhi's intellectual and moral formation and outlook. From the emergence of an international peace movement in 1815, the history of pacifism often became closely intertwined with the history of the broader movement advocating world peace. This intertwining is at the centre of the seven essays of Part IV, 'Pacifism and Peace Movements in the Modern World, 1890-1955.' The volume concludes with a bibliography of Peter Brock's scholarly contributions to peace history. There is an introduction to each of the parts that profiles the subjects of the individual essays and their relationship to one another. The idea for an international gathering of scholars working in peace history originated in a small group of University of Toronto faculty engaged in peace history within the Department of History and University College's Program in Peace and Conflict Studies. The organizing committee consisted of Harvey Dyck (co-chair), History, University of Toronto; Ingrid Epp, Library, University College, University of Toronto; William Klassen (co-chair), Principal, St Paul's United College, Waterloo, Ontario; Arthur Sherk, University College, University of Toronto; Thomas P. Socknat, History, University of Toronto; Metta Spencer, Sociology, University of Toronto; and William Westfall, History, Atkinson College, York University, Toronto. The editor and conference organizers thank Peter Brock for his friendly counsel and assistance at every stage of the undertaking. As well, they are grateful to the following individuals and institutions for their encouragement and financial support of the conference and of this publication: Conrad Grebel College, Waterloo, Ontario; Department of History, University of Toronto; Faculty of Arts and Science, University\n\nPreface\n\nX1\n\nof Toronto; Shirley Farlinger, Toronto; Theodore Friesen, Altona, Manitoba; Good Foundation, Inc., Breslau, Ontario; Frieda and Vern Heinrichs, Toronto; Rosemarie and Victor Heinrichs, Toronto; Anne J.

DYCK 1\n\nIt seems to me that the world is faced by three problems: war, overpopulation, and pollution. I can't write the history of overpopulation because I'm not a demographer. Pollution is something new and has a short history. But I feel I can perhaps contribute something to the history of peace. Mind you, I'm not saying that pacifists are the only people who contribute to peace, far from it.\n\nIn the living-room of his midtown Toronto duplex, Peter Brock, widely esteemed as the world's leading historian of worldwide pacifism, reflects on his recent scholarship. He does so typically with a self-deprecating aside. We are joined briefly by his wife, Carmen, a Quaker volunteer involved in the settlement of Central American refugees. The doorbell rings. A colleague deposits luggage for a mainland Chinese student who will live with the Brocks while he seeks permanent housing. An electrician repairs the range in the kitchen, a puzzling contrivance for Peter (who does not drive a car). I have caught the Brocks just before they leave for a month-long indulgence of a shared passion, cathedral hopping, this time in Portugal. Peter Brock has written sixteen noteworthy books and at least fifty major articles, and he has edited several important collections. His scholarship roams, in detailed monographs as well as sweeping syntheses, across a vast terrain of ages and cultures. While he is equally at home among the Fathers of the Christian Church in the early centuries AD and Gandhi's India, his studies are neither episodic nor meandering. They are tightly woven around two major and distinct, though overlapping, subjects. In both he has become a scholar without peer. Peter Brock is a pre-eminent authority on Polish and East European\n\n4\n\nHarvey L. Dyck\n\nhistory. What is remarkable here is that his mastery extends to many different nationalities and that he has become highly respected for work in all of them. He is an historian of Poland but also of the Czechs, Kashubs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Sorbs, and Ukrainians.2 In each case he has been able to ferret out important patterns of their past from the sources. To do this he has also mastered all of their often difficult languages. Brock's writing concentrates on, but is not exclusively about, populist and nationalist ideas and movements. These aimed in modern times at freeing groups from the tutelage and domination of elites and empires. He is inclined to take his stand with the 'little peoples' of the regions, with their underdogs. His writings have often helped to restore to an ethnic community or social stratum part of its memory and its fuller voice. As one of Brock's knowledgeable friends has written, 'Just as he champions the rights of downtrodden peoples to independence and the peaceful enjoyment of their fundamental human rights, so he deplores and condemns any abuse of this freedom to restrict the liberties of others.'3 Eastern Europe, a minefield for less sure-footed scholars, has been Peter Brock's first scholarly love. It has also remained almost the exclusive area of his teaching, and over the years students have acclaimed him as a devoted guide and source of inspiration.4 What elevates Peter Brock from the ranks of fine historians and places him among a handful of the truly exceptional, is his second academic career, as an historian of pacifism. Some eight of his books and many of his smaller publications are about pacifism. These writings cut across the ages and circle the globe. Peter Brock's earliest work on pacifism was about peace ideas and movements among Czechs.5 He then turned to the English-speaking world on both sides of the Atlantic. Pacifism in the United States (1968), a volume of more than a thousand pages, his first major study devoted wholly to pacifism, was a critical and popular success.6 It was described as 'the definitive account' and a 'prodigiously solid and well-based work on a theme that is in an odd way both a marginal and a fundamental aspect of American history.'7 Against a background of the early peace witness of Quakers, Mennonites, and others, Brock traces the development of more widely based peace movements in the nineteenth century. Sensitive to the sovereignty of detail and the need for nuance, he became the first scholar to track the intricate changes that the peace movement underwent in the colonial environment and then in the perfectionist atmosphere of post-revolutionary American reformism. To Peter Brock's surprise, his book on American pacifism appeared at\n\nPeter Brock - Historian of Pacifism\n\n5\n\na fortunate moment, just as anti-Vietnam war sentiment in America was crystallizing into what became, over the next years, a triumphant crusade. Striking a resonant chord, the book was widely read and helped give that movement a distinctively American home-grown pedigree, native roots. To make the study more easily accessible, Princeton University Press reprinted two parts as separate paperbacks.8 Then, in the late 19605 and early 19705, as the number of those keen about war resistance grew further, Peter Brock addressed his next book on the subject to a more general reader and university student. Twentieth-Century Pacifism (1970) examined peace movements globally. It was perhaps strongest on the ideas and fortunes of opponents of war during the First and Second World Wars. One reviewer wrote, The strength of this book is its balanced and analytical framework ... It outlines a program of peace research in modern history.'9 There followed quickly Brock's Pacifism in Europe to 1914 (1972), a work of seasoned learning. It maps a vast terrain from the early Christian peace thinkers through the Anabaptists, Mennonites, and Quakers, to the ideologues and activists who futilely tried to prevent the outbreak of the first global war of this century. As he further broadened his studies, it was almost inevitable that Peter Brock would try also to fathom the ideas and worldwide influence of Gandhi as this century's chief theorist and practitioner of non-violence, and its greatest martyr. After a year of research in India, this round of scholarship appeared as The Mahatma and Mother India: Essays on Gandhi s Non-Violence and Nationalism (1983). Brock's passionate interest in specific forms of peace witness led also to important articles. Invariably grounded in work in original languages, as are all his writings, they examine the peace views of groups like the Quakers, Czech reformers, Hutterites, Dukhobors, Polish Anabaptists, Hungarian Nazarenes, Tolstoyans, and the early Plymouth Brethren. More than twenty-five years ago, at Columbia University, at the start of Peter Brock's work on pacifism, my wife and I first heard about the Brocks from my doctoral supervisor, Henry Roberts. He described an unusual interview he had had with a candidate for a major appointment in East European history. 'Your usual applicants, all fine scholars,' he said, 'invariably asked about salary levels, workloads, sabbatical leaves, and pensions.' After inquiring about students, a certain Peter Brock, however, had put only one question: 'Were there places nearby on Manhattan Island where [he and Carmen] could go for long walks?' I met Peter Brock for the first time, when, now as colleagues at Colum-\n\n6\n\nHarvey L. Dyck\n\nbia, we walked a picket line together at St John's University on Long Island, protesting an odious abuse of academic freedom. It was about then that he and I started talking about Mennonites and pacifism, and I began reading his work. At the time, as a historian of Russia, I was pondering Stalinism and was viscerally attracted to the 'Christian realism' of Reinhold Niebuhr: the lesser evil as a moral choice. I even audited Niebuhr's disquieting lectures and pondered his sermons across Broadway Avenue at Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church. At the time my own commitment to categorical non-resistance was, at best, pretty shaky. Reading Peter Brock's masterfully told and engrossing story of Czech Christian non-resisters braving injustices and daunting political dilemmas was an eye-opener for me. Here was moral courage in the face of huge ambiguities and obstacles. The reading got me thinking further about my own position. In 1966 Peter Brock and I took up appointments in history at the University of Toronto. Since then, over a quarter of a century, I have followed Brock's career closely in several settings: in seminars, a teamtaught course on comparative nationalism, academic planning sessions, lunches (usually with rich, creamy desserts for Peter's sweet tooth), and in shared, sometimes anguished, stands on contentious issues of the day. The author of significant research across a breadth of eras and cultures, Peter Brock seems at first glance difficult to classify as a historian. One asks, What are the links among the foremost strands of his scholarship - populism, nationalism, and pacifism? Several years ago, while getting together a small talk for Peter Brock's retirement dinner, I surrounded myself with his writings. I paused to read a chapter here, to dip into a particularly apt description there, looking for bits of analysis, conclusions, or a revealing dedicatory note among this wonderful body of printed material. I had previously read many of his books and articles, but not nearly all. I was sampling, looking for connections among the main themes of his scholarship. One clue is that Peter Brock's consuming interest is people who take personal stands against injustice, oppression, or war. In his own scale of values, courage, the making of personal choices about significant moral issues, excites his curiosity. He is equally curious about the ideas behind such hard moral stands, ideas, he states in one place, 'in the realm of practical living.' He also focuses on trail-blazers, the pioneers of those ideas, and on the meaning and implications of the texts that they composed. His scholarship is most riveting when it deals with beginnings.\n\nPeter Brock - Historian of Pacifism\n\n7\n\nThese were heroic dawns when choices were made, lines were being drawn, and seminal ideas worked out. Despite Peter Brock's undeniable identification with the men and women he studies, he writes history with rare detachment, wholly avoiding advocacy or propaganda. The roots of his own pacifism have many ironic and endearing twists. Peter Brock was born in 1920 on the Channel Island of Guernsey, United Kingdom. On both his mother's and his father's side he comes of distinguished military stock. One relation was conspicuously involved in the British burning of the White House in 1812 and another, Sir Isaac Brock, in the Battle of Queenston Heights in the same year. His maternal grandfather was also a British general. Yet, already as a child, he seems to have begun to buck the family tide. A favourite story of his wife, Carmen his loving companion and support for more than three decades - tells how younger members of the family were expected to address grandpapa as 'general/ and regularly did so. Peter Brock, however, always called him simply 'grandfather.' Brock attended Oxford as an undergraduate in the late 19305. This was a time in his life, he recalled, when he was in 'rebellion' against the Church of England, had 'inchoate religious views,' and was quite 'disinterested in sectarianism.' Secular pacifism, however, was then much in the air. So he read into the subject a little, got involved in the peace movement, and joined a pacifist society at Oxford. It was not until the onset of the Second World War, however, that his views began to cohere. This was partly under the intellectual tutelage of a Dutch pacifist, Bart de Ligt. Peter Brock had read a French version of a book by de Ligt, Creative Peace, written in the 19305 on a large scale and with great enthusiasm.10 It traced the history of peace from classical times through the sects to the socialist movements. On re-reading it later, Brock saw that, despite the author's learning, it was a little chaotic in organization and sometimes based on inadequate sources. In 1939, however, it was for him a lx>ok at the right time,' which had a great influence intellectually. It introduced him to sectarian pacifism, sparked his ardour and became a source of his desire one day to write his own synthetic global history of pacifism. When war came Peter Brock persevered in his beliefs and took his stand as a conscientious objector. He was briefly imprisoned and served out the rest of the conflict on alternative service, including work in an English hospital. In the meanwhile he had been strongly drawn to Quaker ideas about war and social justice, although remaining religiously 'a little bit of an outsider.' The war over, he was accepted for\n\n8\n\nHarvey L. Dyck\n\nwork with Quaker relief, first among displaced persons in Western Germany and then in devastated Poland. This was his introduction to Eastern Europe. There followed graduate study at the universities of Cracow, Poland, and Oxford, England, from each of which he holds doctorates in history. Brock first came to the University of Toronto for the one year, 1957-8. He then taught successively at the University of Alberta, Smith College, and Columbia University. He returned to Toronto in 1966, and since then it has been his home. Peter Brock, now well into his formal retirement from the department of history of the University of Toronto, has in recent years completed his most ambitious undertaking to date, a three-volume historical synthesis of worldwide pacifism and war resistance from the Middle Ages to the First World War. The first volume is on sectarian non-resistance;11 the second explores the Quaker peace witness;12 and the third, devoted to non-sectarian pacifism, touches on the ideas of various peace societies, of Gandhi, Tolstoy and the Tolstoyans, and Japanese peace groups.13 The trilogy does no less than define for our generation the subfield of peace history to 1914. It is a significant and sympathetic personal summing up for Peter Brock, though he will, of course, write on this theme again. To celebrate this landmark, a major international conference on the history of pacifism met at the University of Toronto in May 1991. Peter Brock's new three-volume global synthesis is naturally based on research from previous books, but it also incorporates significant new scholarship published in recent years. The synthesis is, for one thing, broader in scope, embracing the experience of groups and lands he has not dealt with very much before. These include Nazarenes, Plymouth Brethren, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Polish Anabaptists, and places like Wales, Canada, Scandinavia, South Africa, and Japan. He touches also, for the first time, on non-pacifist sections of the American peace movement during the decades before 1914, and, generally, he pays closer attention to broader peace movements. How does Brock deal with the recent spate of revisionist writing on pacifism? Is he perhaps himself revising his former views? In detail he is, he says, where new research warrants this, but he has not changed his main conclusions. The possible linkage between social class and pacifism is one new area of current scholarship that interests him greatly. Scholars of Quakerism, he observes, seem to produce a new book every two or three years. A number of these are reinterpretations of the class foundations of Quaker Pennsylvania, and they have pinpointed how that society accepted military measures - more easily than previous his-\n\nPeter Brock - Historian of Pacifism\n\n9\n\ntorians had believed.14 Brock accepts, on the whole, this modified view of Quaker pacifism in that colony. He is more dubious, however, about recent suggestions that the influential British Peace Society in the nineteenth century was essentially class-bound in impulse, promoting peace chiefly as a way of ameliorating class conflicts in England.15 Ever meticulous, his review of the evidence indicates to him that while some members of the society were doubtless socially conservative, many others, keenly sensitive to issues of social justice, fought hard for reform. Brock appears warmly appreciative of some recent reinterpretations of Anabaptist pacifism. He shares, for example, the view of someone like George Williams that the Polish Brethren belonged to the mainstream of Anabaptism, and he treats them accordingly.16 He is not, however, in agreement with everything suggested by the main revisionists on Anabaptism, represented, for example, by James Stayer of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario/7 and his numerous followers. Nevertheless, Brock does find their work solidly based, measured, and well reasoned. He accepts the particular point that Harold Bender, for all his achievement in delimiting and developing the field of Anabaptist scholarship, was mistaken in defining the mainstream of Anabaptism as exclusively peaceable. A balanced understanding must deal with both the peaceable and militant Anabaptists, Brock feels. This he tries to do himself. While Brock is encouraged by the abundance of stimulating new work on Anabaptist pacifism, he laments the serious gaps in the scholarship regarding the Mennonite peace witness across much of Europe. \"For good or bad/ Brock observes, 'Mennonites are very important in the history of pacifism/ On a general level he notes the absence of an allembracing synthetic work on the vicissitudes of Mennonite pacifism. 'With the same idea running through it and the same problems confronting it, it seems to hang together/ he says. He makes an interesting point about sources, commenting that he feels his own writing devotes disproportionate space to the Quaker story relative to that of the Mennonite. 'But this is to some degree the Mennonites' own fault/ he explains. They left many fewer records. For a time they thought it was wrong to leave records. The Quakers were tremendous record keepers, and were also introspective. Literally dozens of them kept personal journals. So there is a vast quantity of Quaker material and, until recently, a meagre amount of Mennonite material.' Over the years Peter Brock and I have often talked about the relationship, and sometime sharp tension, between the moral imperatives of\n\n10\n\nHarvey L. Dyck\n\npeace and of justice. In fact, a recurring theme in his writings is the conflict that often emerged between these two goals. Brock is interested in how some pacifists have tried to reconcile and justify their aspirations for both and how, on occasion, they have achieved neither. For principled pacifists the classical issue is a difficult one: if one rejects the use of force under all circumstances, does one not risk becoming an absolutist in regard to means but a relativist in regard to ends? Crassly put, might not non-resistance as an unequivocal stance embolden the likes of a Hitler, Stalin, or Pol Pot? Ought one then to try to be peaceable only in regard to one's personal relations? Peter Brock, who answers this question with a firm 'no/ continues to wrestle with the implications of his personal convictions in all areas of his life (in recent years he has chosen to become a vegetarian). But he admits to worrying about this dilemma, 'sometimes feeling awkward about it and slightly embarrassed. And yet if one didn't worry one should perhaps be more worried.' The story is told that the child Peter Brock was once asked what he wanted for a birthday present. He replied that he wished to climb the tower of St Paul's Cathedral to look out as far as it was possible for him to see. Figuratively, Peter Brock has taken his worldwide readership by the hand on many such a long climb to share with it the vistas he has uncovered. By mapping the vast terrain of pacifist history, its uplands and watersheds, as well as its wastelands, he has advanced and given the field clarity, coherence, and boundaries. He has also identified grey areas on the map in need of further scouting. As we read his careful but luminous sketches of the heroes great and small of populist, nationalist, and pacifist thought, we recognize that Peter Brock often writes about individuals who have some of the same qualities he has found, or somehow managed to create, in himself. His pacifism, in the absence of anything in his own background pointing in this direction, is a highly personal, lifelong commitment. It has made him highly sensitive to social oppression and war. Peter Brock himself, in a kind of personal credo, puts the matter much more simply. 'I'd like my scholarship to be as impartial as I can make it,' he has said, 'but also that it be something of significance.'

Yet a number of approaches have already emerged, as have differences in regard to such issues as, say, terminology, categories, or parameters. Martin Ceadel in the first essay of this section elaborates ten distinctions he believes will help clarify the content of peace history, giving greater precision to scholarship on its various strands and ideologies. He urges, in particular, greater clarity for such frequently used terms as 'pacifism' and 'peace movement' - and even 'pacificism.' Charles Chatfield carries the argument further in the next essay, which he entitles Thinking about Peace in History.' While supporting the plea for clearer distinctions among intellectual categories and historical traditions, he cautions against overly rigid typologies that might 'compartmentalize and marginalize ideas' about peace. He concludes that 'it is necessary to group peace advocates, but categories apply sometimes more and sometimes less.' Peter van den Dungen discusses two Dutch scholars, Jacob ter Meulen and Bart de Ligt, in a case study in early peace historiography. The two men represented contrasting approaches to the subject. Ter Meulen, who held the post of chief librarian at the Peace Palace in The Hague for many years, was primarily interested in the development of internationalism. It was to this theme that he devoted his magnum opus, a work of profound research in three volumes. If, however, 'for ter Meulen the idea of peace was tantamount to that of international organization,' for de Ligt this idea signified something different. His magnum opus, likewise the fruit of deep learning, was a 'history of ... radical pacifism and antimilitarism,' of civilian resistance and direct action against war, a struggle de Ligt traces from its roots in antiquity to the interwar years of the twentieth century when he composed his major works. Himself a peace activist, de Ligt exercised considerable influence on later students of non-violence. It should be noted that the divergent approaches of these two scholars have continued to recur in the subsequent writing of peace history.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n2 Ten Distinctions for Peace Historians MARTIN CEADEL\n\nNo ideology owes more to one academic than pacifism owes to Peter Brock. That the scope and richness of its historical tradition can now be recognized is largely the result of Brock's sympathetic and dedicated scholarship, which was begun, moreover, at a time when pacifism was an unfashionable subject, particularly when compared with equivalently radical viewpoints in domestic politics. When I started research on the 19305 British peace movement in 1969, just a year after the appearance of Brock's Pacifism in the United States: From the Colonial Era to the First World War, I was struck not only by the lack of published work on pacifism and its related ideologies and movements but also by the lack of interest in such topics.11 remember reading Twentieth-Century Pacifism, the second volume of Brock's remarkable first trilogy, on train trips to pacifist archives in 1970 and discovering guidance that was available from no other source. And I can no less vividly recall reading the third volume, Pacifism in Europe to 1914, soon after its publication in 1972 at a time when I was struggling to write the first drafts of a doctoral thesis that by then had narrowed its focus to the pacifist core of the peace movement. In fact, the direction that my work has subsequently taken has owed much to the typology of six varieties of pacifism with which, albeit somewhat tentatively, he concluded that book.2 Brock, however, has never been particularly interested in categorization: though always clear-minded and rigorous in his definitions, he has concentrated on providing a chronological record of the pacifist tradition and an exegesis of its early texts. Brock's work has thus not principally been designed to dispel the conceptual confusion that irritated me as a postgraduate student. When, for example, I told people who were well informed about Britain in the 19305 that I was working on the paci-\n\n*8\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nfism of that decade, surprisingly few made the correct inference that I was dealing mainly with Canon Dick Sheppard and the Peace Pledge Union. Many more assumed that I was working on the literary reaction against the First World War, on support for the League of Nations and collective security, on the appeasement of Germany, or on some other topic in the general area of attitudes to war. Moreover, in the viva voce examination of my thesis, I was asked by one of my examiners why I had not discussed E.D. Morel. I replied that it was because Morel (who had anyway died in 1924, seven years before my starting date) was not a pacifist, in the absolute sense in which I had defined and used the term throughout my thesis, but what I had called a pacificist. It startled me to have to make such a reply since the examiner in question was the person from whose work I had, with full acknowledgment, borrowed the pacifism-pacificism distinction in the first place, A.J.P. Taylor. While working on Britain's tradition of 'dissent over foreign policy' Taylor had suddenly, it seems, realized that this was not the same as pacifism. To a sentence commenting that John Bright did not wish to leave England defenceless even though he 'was sometimes nearer to pacifism' than Richard Cobden, Taylor therefore tacked on the following footnote: 'By \"pacificism\" I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by \"pacificism\" (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrines of nonresistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative to it, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.'3 This footnote was typical of Taylor. It combined brilliant analysis with memorably expressed prejudice. It also, however, carelessly implied that 'pacificism' was an older and different word instead of an etymologically more correct4 variant of 'pacifism' that entered the language at the same time. And it inappropriately presented a crucial point of definition as a belated (and apparently never internalized) aside, instead of being included in the introductory discussion of other central concepts, such as radicalism and dissent, both of which are treated with greater sensitivity. I make these comments not to belittle Taylor, an historian whose strengths enormously outweighed his idiosyncrasies and to whom I was personally indebted for a number of kindnesses, but to illustrate what seemed to me a reluctance on the part of even the finest academics at that time to devote the same academic precision they were lavishing on domestic political subjects to issues connected with the prevention of war. In recent years peace-and-war studies have started to boom, largely in\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\nX\n\n9\n\nresponse to the 'Second Cold War' of the late 19705 and 19805 and its attendant peace activism, and perhaps also in response to the overgrazing of social and domestic fields by the academic herds of the 19605 and 19705. As a result, scholars have become increasingly aware that what they once lumped together under the heading of 'pacifism' is an assortment of distant ideologies, and some have begun to debate how best these should be distinguished and labelled. Even so, I am convinced that students of the history and politics of peace movements - peace historians as I shall call them for short - still lag behind, say, the students of the history and politics of labour movements in the precision with which they disentangle different stands. Labour historians agree not only on key distinctions (for example, between socialist and non-socialist viewpoints), but also on a vocabulary for making refinements within each of these categories: they therefore are able to distinguish precisely among Marxist, Fabian, Christian-socialist, anarcho-syndicalist, and other types of socialism, and among liberal, social-democratic, labourist, and other types of non-socialism. They are aware, moreover, that such distinctions are important not only in their own right but also, since each strand flourishes in different political conditions, for any rigorous explanation of a labour movement's development. They are also alert to the importance of dogs that do not bark: they regard the absence of a strand from the labour movement of the country on which they are working - for example, the weakness of Marxism in Britain compared with continental Europe - as a significant fact and not an indication that the distinction between Marxist and non-Marxist socialism is invalid or unimportant. Peace historians, in my view, are inclined to be vague. For example, an informative and otherwise sensitive book on Canadian pacifism5 states on the opening page that 'pacifism is basically a Christian phenomenon/ but soon identifies a 'quite different' sort of opposition to war (a 'pacifism in the liberal tradition'), while nevertheless retaining the term 'pacifism' for both. The result, in my view, is a loss of clarity in the analysis of the various stands within the Canadian peace movement. Similarly, an innovative article entitled The Social Origins of Victorian Pacifism'6 uses lists of early members of the London Peace Society and lists of petitioners to the House of Commons in support of an arbitration motion as if they were evidence of the same phenomenon, even though the former was a society which, though imposing no creed on its members, was known to be formally committed to pacifism, and the latter a pacificist motion worded as an anodyne, which virtually anyone other than a militarist could support. In my view, both these works lump together dis-\n\n2O\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\ntinct phenomena - pacifism and pacificism - that require distinct analyses. They are, of course, often intertwined within the same movement and sometimes coexist uneasily within the thinking of cross-pressured individuals, but peace historians should recognize that separate elements tangled together and in tension with each other are in fact more common than undifferentiated syntheses or hybrids. Peace historians are also too inclined to reject distinctions that do not apply to the countries they study - in other words, to consider only dogs that do bark - thereby inhibiting the development of a comparative approach to the subject. I hasten to admit that I have been as guilty as anyone of this failing: as will be noted later in this essay, I have failed to make use of the distinction, borrowed form the sociologist Karl Mannheim, between 'utopian' and 'ideological' pacifism, because it is of little use in analysing the British peace movement, forgetting that this fact is itself significant. But others working on countries, such as Germany, in which it is more applicable, have gone to the other extreme, and have implied that it is 'the central distinction'7 that peace historians need to make, forgetting the different needs of those studying other countries. Even when undertaking single-country studies, peace historians should remember the longer-term goal of constructing a set of categories robust enough to permit cross-national comparison. In this essay I offer a list of ten distinctions on which such a set of categories can be founded. I adopt this format for reasons of clarity, despite the impression it may give of un-Brock-like dogmatism. I must make clear that it is not my intention to assert or imply the ethical superiority of any of the viewpoints identified. The aim of the distinctions is analytical utility alone. They are necessary to define what peace historians write about: what exactly do they mean when they use 'pacifism' and 'peace movement' in the titles of their books? And they are necessary to distinguish what must be explained separately: for example, during the nineteenth century support for arbitration was generally a by-product of political liberalism, whereas support for pacifism depended heavily on certain Christian traditions. I must also point out that my interest is in the period since approximately the late eighteenth century, when a political debate about peace and war, and with it a peace movement, first developed. What Brock calls 'sectarian pacifism' originated in a pre-modern context that my distinctions are not designed to elucidate, although, since it survived to play a role peas the modern peace movement, I shall attempt to apply my distinctions to it so far as is possible.\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n21\n\nDistinction i\n\nDistinction i is between absolutist and what for want of a better word I shall call reformist positions. Absolutist positions are those defined by their rejection of a particular activity - for example, force, killing, war, the use of nuclear weapons - as impermissible. (As we shall see, pacifism is an absolutist position, or rather a cluster of absolutist positions, but not the only one to be found in the peace-and-war debate.) It is, however, wrong to regard absolutist positions as necessarily negative: they can form part of more positive ideologies such as the spiritual conception of socialism or anarchism. It is not, however, unfair to describe them as apolitical in the normal sense of that word. Reformist positions are those which seek the abolition of war through a restructuring of the political order - for example, by transferring sovereignty to supranational bodies, by ending capitalism, by introducing greater democratic accountability within states, or by curbing patriarchy - rather than by rejecting a particular activity. (As we shall see, pacificism is a reformist position, but not the only one.) Reformist positions are thus essentially political: it is through the creation of new political structures, domestic or international, that war will be abolished. Much of the history of peace movements - and indeed of other philanthropic movements - can be explained in terms of the struggle by organizations and individuals to combine absolutist and reformist approaches: a good example is provided by Britain's First World War peace society, the No-Conscription Fellowship, which attempted to reconcile the pacifist and pacificist versions of socialism.8 But it should be recognized that they are fundamentally different. I must here anticipate an objection to the hard-and-fast distinction I have drawn between absolutist and non-absolutist positions. What, it might be asked, about contingent positions? Not all pacifists make the unqualified assertion that all war is wrong; some admit the theoretical possibility of a justifiable war. For example, as my recent research on the origins of the British peace movement has taught me, a number of early nineteenth-century peace activists conceded the theoretical possibility of a truly defensive (and therefore justifiable) war, though they were convinced that they had never met it in practice. And, more recently, moral philosophers have defined a contingent form of pacifism. How are these to be classified? I believe that they can be treated either as absolutist or non-absolutist, depending on the rule of thumb adopted by peace activists faced with a remote contingency. Those who decide to behave as if\n\nMartin Ceadel there is no chance of a foreseeable war being a justifiable one are absolutists. In other words, the contingent belief 'that while there is in principle the possibility of a war being justified, this is in practice a possibility so remote that we can disregard it'9 results in a pacifism indistinguishable in practice from that arising from an unqualified belief that war could in no circumstances be justified. Peace activists who behave as if there is a significant chance of a foreseeable war being justifiable, and who therefore decide to keep an open mind until it actually breaks out, are not absolutists. They may be pacificists of an extreme kind, but not pacifists. The most difficult case to classify is provided by a pre-modern survival, 'eschatological pacifism/ the belief that true believers should reject all wars for the present but should expect the millennium, in the course of which they may be called upon to fight holy wars. This is number three on Brock's list of six types of pacifism, and he describes it as a 'kind of nonviolent interim-ethic' lying 'in the border zone between a principled and conditional pacifism.' Nevertheless, as Brock implies, a distinction can be made according to the intensity of the apocalyptic expectation. Those who believe the millennium - and consequently the possibility of a holy war - to be imminent are not pacifists in the full sense. But, as Brock notes, 'What begins as an interim-ethic may eventually be transformed into a settled moral code if the expected \"final things\" do not take place.' In other words, those who do not seriously expect the millennium to occur for the foreseeable future, and who therefore take for granted that the next war will be one in which they cannot participate, are indistinguishable from pacifists. In practice, therefore, it is generally possible to distinguish between eschatological sects that have retained their apocalyptic hopes, and with them a barely repressed crusading zeal, and those which have become indistinguishable from religious pacifists. Distinction 2\n\nDistinction 2 is between both absolutist and reformist positions, on the one hand, and the just war tradition, on the other. Just war thinking is an increasingly important source of ethical objections to the practice of modern warfare, as responses to the 1991 Persian Gulf War have reminded us. It is, however, neither a moral theory nor an ideology of peace and war, being instead a set of additional rules to which those whose moral theories or ideologies permit the use of force must also adhere before they can in practice employ that force. It is thus possible\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n2\n\n3\n\nto be a 'realist' supporter of orthodox defence preparedness - in other words, a 'defencist/ to use the term I have had to coin because of the extraordinary lack of an established word to describe this commonest of viewpoints - and still to feel that certain uses of force are impermissible. The just war tradition is thus, I feel, best distinguished from the peace-movement tradition, as is done, for example, by James Turner Johnson.10 Distinction 3\n\nDistinction 3 is between those types of reformism that allow aggressive force and those that do not. Just as in domestic politics some advocates of fundamental change have been revolutionaries prepared to use violence, so in international politics some reformists have been crusaders willing to use aggressive war to impose their ideology and thus hasten the abolition of war. We must distinguish these crusaders from pacificists, who, like the gradualists and constitutionalists among domestic reformers, wish to implement their war-abolishing reforms by peaceful persuasion. Admittedly, this line is sometimes hard to draw. Many nineteenthcentury liberals accepted Mazzini's idea that European peace could be established only on the basis of democratic nation states, and they were thus tempted to view revolutions and wars of national liberation against autocratic dynastic states as steps towards peace. Thus, some European groups that are conventionally classified as peace societies - such as Charles Lemmonier's Ligue Internationale de la Paix et de la Liberte, established at Geneva in 1867 at a meeting chaired by Garibaldi - exhibited a barely repressed crusading streak that unsettled their peace-movement colleagues.11 Distinction 4 Distinction 4 is between intellectual distinctions and labels. The former matter much more than the latter. As long as peaceful reformism is recognized as a category, I do not mind if people cannot bring themselves to label it pacificism.12 Undoubtedly pacificism is etymologically artificial, difficult to pronounce, and visually easy to confuse with pacifism (which is why I sometimes have italicized it, as here, and at other times have written it as pacific-ism). The argument in its favour is simply the absence of any obvious alternative. 'Irenicism' is a possibility that quite appeals to me, though it is a little pretentious. 'Peace advocacy' fails to\n\n24\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nconvey the fact that peaceful reformism is as much an ideology - an 'ism' - as pacifism and is best kept as an umbrella term covering both pacificism and pacifism. Because they dislike pacificism, some writers use the word pacifist to cover the peaceful-reformist position and describe the absolutist view as 'absolute pacifism' or, in the case of writers in France, where this practice is almost universal, 'integral pacifism.' Others have used a qualifying adjective for the broad position too. For example, my understanding of Yvonne Bennett's usage in her dissertation on Vera Brittain and the Peace Pledge Union during the Second World War is that the reformist position is 'low' pacifism and the absolutist position 'high' pacifism (although the latter can be 'broad' pacifism in a particular political orientation).13 One reason for disliking adjectives such as 'low' and 'high' is that they bring value judgments with them. My main reason for disliking the use of pacifism as a label for the reformists position, however, is that it seems odd to describe as in any sense 'pacifist' the League of Nations Union, Britain's largest peace society, when after 1936 it advocated collective resistance to Nazi aggression and opposed the Conservative government's policy of appeasement. It was the body founded as a reaction against this policy, the Peace Pledge Union, which preached pacifism in the sense then understood by most Britons. But this brings me back to a point I have already touched on, namely, that most of us when introducing supposedly universal schemes of labelling and classification are in fact conditioned by parochial concerns. As I have implied, it is because I began my research on 19305 Britain, where the absolutist tradition was strong and the most influential elements within the pacificist tradition came strongly to support collective security, that I have used pacifism in the strict way I do. Conversely, those working on France and Germany have tended to adopt the broader usage of pacifism because of the distinctive characteristics of their countries of study: absolute pacifism has been so much weaker in both countries than in Britain that there seems no point in reserving the more convenient label, pacifism, exclusively for it; and the political culture has been so much less favourable to pacificism in both countries as to make this a more subversive-seeming position than in Britain and therefore deserving of as bold a term as pacifism. Labels are thus a matter of contextual convenience as well as individual taste, and it may be impossible to all agree on a common system. Let us nevertheless agree on substantive intellectual distinctions, such as those among pacifism, paciicism, and the just war tradition.\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n2\n\n5\n\nDistinction 5\n\nDistinction 5 is among the varieties of pacificism, as I shall continue to label it. There are as many of these as there are ideologies. Since ideology is a contentious word that I have already used a number of times here without clarification, I must before going any further explain that I do not use it with the pejorative implication that it is a false perspective that can be contrasted with an objective one. I use it in the neutral sense of a world-view or structured set of beliefs that all of us rely on, consciously or otherwise, to help us to filter out of the enormous amount of information about the world with which we are constantly confronted what is important and desirable. We have been strangely reluctant to recognize the ideological structure of the peace-and-war debate. In domestic politics, by contrast, most of us accept that ideology plays a considerable role; we take for granted that, say, conservatives and socialists take different views not merely of the values that human beings should be promoting but also of the way the world works, and that it makes sense therefore to interpret debates about such issues as the educational system and the economy as being to some extent structured by an underlying ideological dispute. But we have tended to see the peace-and-war debate taking place at the level of policy options - for example, on the merits of detente, disarmament, or international organizations - rather than among underlying positions that carry over from one policy to another. Insofar as we have acknowledged an ideological structure to the debate between the different elements of the peace movement and their various opponents, we have done so in terms of crude dichotomies between hawks and doves, realists and idealists, pacifists and militarists. I have tried in a previous book14 to set out an ideological structure for the peace-and-war debate, dividing the opponents of the peace movement into militarists (advocates of aggression on the grounds that war alone promotes human development), defencists, and crusaders, and the supporters of the peace movement into pacificists and pacifists. More relevant for present purposes is that I have also tried to identify the various ideologies underpinning the variants of pacificism that I have come across in my work on the British peace movement. The most important of these has been liberalism: it has argued that there is no inherent conflict of interests among nations and that only an obsession with state sovereignty has caused people to overlook this fact; and it has a proposed remedies ranging from free trade via international organizations to supranationalism. Liberalism's most conspicuous challenger has\n\n26\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nbeen socialism: this has insisted that it is not nationalism but capitalism that causes war and that only the spreading of socialism can guarantee peace. The third major ideology, less influential than liberalism and less intellectually coherent than socialism, has been radicalism, a left-wing variety of populism: it assumes that left to themselves the people would abolish war and that it has been the machinations of elites (such as diplomats) and vested interests (such as arms manufacturers) that have ensured that this has not been achieved. The first British peace society to be set up during the First World War was called the Union of Democratic Control because it believed that popular control of foreign policy was the way to achieve peace. And, although you will have to turn to my book for illustrations of this point, I believe that radical thinking has also been strongly influential within the nuclear-disarmament movement in Britain. Liberalism, socialism, and radicalism have been the dominant strands of pacificism for much of the history of the British and indeed most other peace movements. In the 19805, however, these were strongly challenged by two other strands. The first was feminism, which often strongly implies, even if it hardly ever explicitly asserts, that patriarchy is the cause of war and that its overthrow can alone bring peace. The second was ecologism, the green ideology, which sees the upsetting of the balance of nature by industrialization as the cause of war. These five, then, are the principal types of pacificism that I have identified, but of course it would be possible to draw ideological lines in different ways. For example, whereas my classification assumes that Christian pacificists have borrowed their thinking about war prevention from the various ideologies just discussed, others might wish to treat Christianity as a pacificism in its own right. Distinction 6\n\nDistinction 6 is between the intellectual content of an anti-war ideology and its sociopolitical context. This distinction is acknowledged, though its implications are not fully recognized, in Roger Chickering's sophisticated and path-breaking study of the pre-1914 German peace movement. Attempting 'to isolate the central distinction among varieties of pacifism' (this last word being employed to cover both pacificism and pacifism), Chickering offers 'a distinction based upon their socio-political context as well as their integrated intellectual content.' To this end he adopts Karl Mannheim's dichotomy between 'utopian' and 'ideological' views. Chickering explains this as follows:\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n2\n\n7\n\nUsing the orientation of a pacifist doctrine towards politics and society as the basic criterion of differentiation, it is useful to distinguish between pacifism as Utopia and pacifism as ideology. Utopian pacifism conceives of war as an inseparable aspect of a social and political order that is utterly corrupt and beyond rehabilitation. Ideological pacifism rejects war because of the threat it poses to a social and political order that is basically sound and praiseworthy. Differences in nuance and emphasis among varieties of pacifism are subordinate to this central distinction.15\n\nThis distinction is also favoured by Norman Ingram in his valuable recent study of interwar pacifism in France, though not to the exclusion of other distinctions.16 The adoption of this terminology in the contexts of Wilhelmine Germany and interwar France suggests that 'utopian pacifism' is a phenomenon found particularly in what I have elsewhere analysed as 'illiberal' or 'non-liberal' political cultures/7 in which the peace movement has been viewed as treacherous and subversive rather than idealistic and legitimate. In more liberal cultures, such as Britain, almost the entire pacificist movement, except perhaps its Marxist fringe, would have to be classified as 'ideological pacifists,' since they have regarded the social order not as 'utterly corrupt and beyond rehabilitation' but as 'basically sound and praiseworthy,' in the sense that they believe it capable by normal constitutional processes of delivering the reforms that would abolish war. That was why I ignored the distinction between 'Utopian' and 'ideological' pacifism when first writing about Britain. As already indicated, however, I now believe I was wrong to do so. The fact that 'utopian' pacifism is a dog that does not bark in Britain is a significant one to which attention should be drawn. By the same token, I feel Chickering is wrong to use it as the central distinction that needs to be made. In particular, there is no justification for believing that it removes the need for the pacifism-pacificism distinction, since there is a significant difference between a pacifist utopian (such as a Garrisonian non-resister) and a pacificist one (such as a Marxist war-resister). The best practice is to use both distinctions, as Ingram does. It is also helpful to take Chickering's distinction between 'socio-political context' and 'integrated intellectual content' even further than he does.1 Whereas Chickering believes that the two can be combined, I believe them to be conceptually separate. Intellectual content alone should be the criterion for identifying the various anti-war ideologies. But in addition, sociopolitical context may be used to explain why the latter differ so considerably in their political implications, and conse-\n\n28\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nquently in their popularity, from country to country. Let me give an illustration. In trying to analyse the major trends of opinion within the nineteenth-century international peace movement, we should begin by considering intellectual content: for example, we should identify a 'Cobdenite' version of radical pacificism by its set of assumptions about aristocratic power, free trade, the reduction in arms spending as part of a general reduction in government spending, and so on. Having done so, however, we may note that such a position was relatively uncontroversial in certain countries, such as Britain and the United States, yet seemed unpatriotic and almost subversive in much of continental Europe. In Mannheim's terminology Cobdenism was relatively 'ideological' in some countries, but almost 'utopian' in others. This shows that Mannheim's distinction has less to say about anti-war ideologies as such than about the political environment in which they operate. The latter is an important subject; elsewhere I have offered a general explanation of the cross-national variations in the acceptability of different anti-war theories with reference to the strength of liberalism within a country's political culture and the measure of security afforded by its strategic situation.19 But before we can study the sociopolitical implications of an ideology, we must first establish its intellectual content. Though complementary, the study of ideologies and of their sociopolitical context must be recognized as distinct tasks. Distinction 7\n\nMy remaining distinctions all have to do with absolutism. Distinction 7 is between pacifism and other, superficially similar, forms of absolutism that, however, fall short of being rejections of all modern war. The latter can for convenience be divided into modern and historic absolutism. Modern absolutisms reject only the use of certain kinds of modern weapons, most notably nuclear weapons, but also chemical or biological weapons. In recent years it has become common to call the first of these positions 'nuclear' pacifism'; but insofar as it does not object to conventional warfare it cannot be recognized as a truly pacifist position. It would be better described as anti-nuclear-weapons absolutism, and the other positions as anti-chemical-weapons absolutism or anti-biological-weapons absolutism. We should note, however, that the view that the use of such weapons in any war is so probable that all future war must be rejected is indeed pacifism. (Because it deals with probabilities rather than certainties, it is a contingent rather than an unqualified position; but, as it\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n2\n\n9\n\nleads to the rejection of all future warfare, it is an absolutist one nevertheless.) It should ideally be described as nuclear-era pacifism, or chemicalor biological-era pacifism, so as to make clear that the absolutist objection is not to the use of particular weapons but to all warfare in an era in which such weapons are available. These modern absolutism present few difficulties. Few scholars would think it helpful to regard nuclear pacifism and the like as a true form of pacifism, and many nuclear pacifists go out of their way to make clear they are not pacifists in the full sense. The historic absolutisms present greater difficulties, however. Though sometimes treated by scholars as legitimate forms of pacifism, I shall argue that they are either forms of 'exemptionism' or secondary characteristics of a pacifism whose primary inspiration must be sought on other grounds. I have defined 'exemptionism' as the view that war is all right for others, but not for members of the elite or the elect. It is best illustrated in pure form by the alleged retort of one young member of Britain's Bloomsbury Group in the First World War to the question why he was not fighting for civilization like most other men of his age: 'Madam, I am the civilization they are fighting for.'20 The secular basis of such a claim has usually been the higher calling of the artist with special creative gifts, while its religious basis has been the higher calling of members of a monastic order or sect who submit to special spiritual disciplines. Brock regards these positions as instances of Vocational pacifism,' the first of his six types of pacifism, which he defines in the following terms: 'Although for the vocationalists nonviolence is absolute in respect to an individual who has accepted it for his own way of life, they make no claim for its integral acceptance by others who have not chosen the same calling. For the rules of one calling are not incumbent on those who have adopted another, even if a less elevated one.' Brock, however, admits that it 'scarcely fits within the definition of pacifism' he has been using. In my view, the key issue is whether vocational pacifists want those others who 'have not chosen the same calling' to espouse pacifism too. If not, they are preaching exemptionism. After all, when churches support a war and wish their ordinary members to fight in it, their simultaneous wish that their monastic orders be especially excused from military service has nothing to do with pacifism. Only if vocational pacifists wish others to take the same position are they true pacifists. And in this case, of course, they must explain why they and others are justified in being pacifists. Vocational pacifism is therefore either exemptionism or a behavioural characteristic - an\n\n3°\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nunpriggish reluctance to point out to others what they themselves regard as correct behaviour - of those who are pacifists on other grounds. It is not itself a form of pacifism. Similar points can be made about 'soteriological pacifism/ another pre-modern position, which is number two on Brock's list and that he defines as 'an objection to shedding human blood (and sometimes animals' as well) because it leads to ritual impurity and thus to the loss of personal salvation, at least until some form of purification is undergone.' As Brock admits, it 'is not easily comprehended within the normative pacifism' he has outlined. Unlike the objection to idolatrous military oaths, which played some part in the early Christian objection to service in the Roman army, it is an objection that goes directly to the heart of war, since the latter cannot be carried on without killing. But it might be exemptionist, if the aversion to shedding blood is regarded as a sign of the heightened fastidiousness of the elect. That this has indeed often been the case is borne out by Brock's observation: 'Vocationally this has been the standpoint of the priesthood in various primitive religions.' I would argue therefore that, as in the case of vocational pacifism, the test is whether soteriological pacifists want others to take the same stand. If not, they are exemptionists, but if so, they are indeed pacifists. In the latter case, however, they still must explain why ritual impurity arises from killing, and in doing so they will presumably show soteriological pacifism to be less a type of pacifism in its own right than one of the many forms that religious pacifism can take. Similar observations apply to Brock's third type of pacifism, 'eschatological pacifism/ to which some attention has already been paid. As we have seen, when apocalyptic hopes are high this is, in Brock's words, too 'conditional' a rejection of war to count as 'principled' pacifism: in the terms used here, it is a temporary exemptionism, valid only until the millennium. But, after such hopes have faded, it may develop into a 'settled moral code' indistinguishable from pacifism. Even if it does so, however, it needs to explain why it rejects war in a world whose spiritual transformation looks increasingly far off, and the answer it gives is usually a religious imperative. Like 'vocational' and 'soteriological' pacifism, therefore, 'eschatological pacifism' can be either exemptionism or a particular form of religious pacifism. Distinction 8\n\nMy final three distinctions are among those types of absolutism that are\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians unambiguously pacifist. In Nevertheless: Varieties of Religious Pacifism, John H. Yoder argued that pacifism should be viewed as 'not just one specific position .. but rather a wide gamut of varying, sometimes even contradictory positions.'21 Warning against the forcing of such positions into 'the ready-made slots of the ethicists/ he gives a long, unstructured list. I believe it is useful to structure these different pacifisms according to three criteria: what it is they object to; what their ethical inspiration is; and what their orientation towards politics is. Distinction 8 is thus among the various things to which pacifism can object. The most extreme is to physical force of any kind: the best known theorist of this view was Tolstoy. Less extreme is the objection to killing, which entails an objection to capital punishment as well as war. Next comes the objection to war as such, which permits forms of killing that do not count as war. At the moderate end are the objections only to modern war or war in the nuclear era, which accept that in past ages wars were sometimes justified. Because different pacifisms thus object to different things, it follows that an argument against one is not an argument against all. Though a 'killing pacifist' could not consistently support a violent revolution, for example, the same would not be true of a 'war pacifist.'22 Distinction 9\n\nDistinction 9 is among the three or four main ethical inspirations for pacifism. The latter must, in other words, be grounded either in a religious faith (usually Christianity), or in a political creed (notably anarchism or the spiritual conception of socialism), or in a philosophical position (such as humanitarianism or utilitarianism). Except that I now would place more emphasis upon the difference within the philosophical strand between the humanitarians, whose ethical position is deontological and unqualified, and the utilitarians, whose approach is consequentialist and contingent, I see little need to change what I wrote about pacifist inspirations in my first book. Indeed my subsequent research has increased my conviction that such distinctions are useful. After all, pacifism as an idea is inexorably linked to the development of three or four ethical traditions, and pacifists spend much of their time trying to persuade those in the same tradition that it entails pacifism. Religious pacifists have sought to so persuade their fellow Christians, political pacifists their fellow socialists, and philosophical pacifists their fellow humanists or consequentialists. To some extent, moreover, the dynamics\n\n32\n\nMartin Ceadel\n\nof the pacifist movement are explained by tensions among religious, political, and philosophical approaches. For example, as a British Christian pacifist observed some years ago of his relations with the rest of the peace movement: 'A question that continually arises but is usually brushed under the carpet is what kind of relationship there can be between Christian pacifists and secular pacifists or those who simply claim to be \"religious\" ... To ignore these differences is to pretend that they don't matter but the Christian cannot honestly behave as if Christianity did not matter without some strain, and the equivalent beliefs of other groups are perhaps comparably important to them/23 Distinction 10\n\nDistinction 10 is among the three main orientations towards politics that pacifists can adopt. This brings me to my original debt to Brock, since it was his fourth, fifth, and sixth pacifist categories that first alerted me to the need to classify pacifism according to its view of politics as well as its ethical inspiration. Brock's separational pacifism was what I now call the pessimistic orientation: in peacetime it adopts a sectarian approach to politics; in wartime it seeks to maintain a quietist witness, often in pacifist communities. Brock's integrational pacifism was what I now call the mainstream orientation: in peacetime it collaborates with pacificist proposals for war prevention; in wartime it mainly attempts to serve society through humanitarian and relief work. Brock's goal-directed pacifism was what I now call the optimistic inspiration: in peacetime it believes that to develop a capacity for Gandhi-style non-violent resistance will be an effective way of deterring invasion; in wartime it attempts to stop the war effort. I am convinced that these distinctions have been useful to the historical analysis of pacifism, and I have been generally unpersuaded by attempts to vary them.24 But I should make clear that there is no implication that these three orientations will be found in every pacifist movement. That the non-violent orientation was not found in interwar France does not, as Ingram implies,25 reveal a weakness of this typology: it is another example of a non-barking dog. I have now set out ten distinctions: between absolutism as a whole and reformism as a whole, between each of these and the just war tradition, between the crusading and pacificist versions of reformism, between substantive intellectual distinctions and descriptive labels, between the\n\nTen Distinctions for Peace Historians\n\n33\n\nintellectual content of an anti-war ideology and its sociopolitical context, among the varieties of pacificism, between pacifist and non-pacifist absolutism, among the things to which different varieties of pacifism object, among the ethical inspirations for pacifism, and among pacifism's orientations towards politics. If these distinctions are conceived as the different axes of a multidimensional grid, then there are sufficient slots to embrace all the many types of anti-war position without straitjacketing. Perhaps I am exhibiting a deformation professionelle in questing for that holy grail of political science, the comprehensive taxonomy. But I am convinced that such a quest is needed if the study of the history and politics of peace movements is to catch up with comparable branches of study, such as that of labour movements, in making rigorous distinctions among, for example, intellectual traditions, ideological structures, political tactics, and contextual factors. Notes\n\n1 This was reflected in the fact that neither of the doctoral theses on aspects of modern British pacifism which I read early in my work had been published: K.G. Robbins wrote books on two other subjects before publishing a revised version of The Abolition of War: A Study in the Organisation and Ideology of the Peace Movement, 1914-19,' DPhil thesis, Oxford University (1964) in 1976; and, so far as I am aware, Joyce A.

Similarly, I do not agree with Norman Ingram (Politics of Dissent, 11) that the non-violent orientation is 'no more than a case of extreme collaboration': the essence of collaboration is that pacifists support non-pacifist measures as a second best but a step in the right direction, whereas non-violence is not a second best and involves pacifists in no compromise with physical force. 25 Ingram, Politics of Dissent, 11.\n\n3 Thinking about Peace in History CHARLES CHATFIELD\n\nThis essay has an intentionally ambiguous title, for it addresses both how we think about peace in historical terms (thinking about peace-inhistory) and how peace has been considered historically (thinkingabout-peace in history). My own thought has been stimulated in each respect by Martin Ceadel's critical analysis of the positions taken in what he has called the war-and-peace debate, notably by the typology he advanced in Thinking about Peace and War and by his subsequent essay, Ten Distinctions for Peace Historians.' In each case Ceadel develops categories for the purpose of offering interpretive distinctions with which to clarify our discourse and enable us to get beyond description. In the first instance he frames his typology in the theoretical context of international relations - how we think about peace and war. In the second he applies his typological distinctions to the history of peace movements - how peace has historically been considered - and he does so in an historically sensitive, nuanced manner. This is not surprising, because Ceadel's earlier Pacifism in Britain, 19141945 was a sophisticated excursion into the consequences of thinking about peace in particular ways.1 The difference between thinking about war and peace, on the one hand, and reflecting on the historical consequences of war and peace thought, on the other, is itself a critical distinction. It is not an absolute one, of course; it is a matter of relative emphasis which, however, establishes parameters of judgment. I would like to reflect a bit on those parameters and then to explore them in terms of some aspects of historic peace thought and organization.\n\nThinking about Peace in History\n\n37\n\nCategories and Characterization\n\nIn his Ten Distinctions' Ceadel distinguishes between the 'intellectual distinctions/ required for understanding, and those 'labels' that constitute a kind of shorthand for schemes of classification. He identifies the threshold of our problem with language when he observes that 'most of us when introducing supposedly universal schemes of labelling and classification are in fact conditioned by parochial concerns ... Labels are thus a matter of contextual convenience as well as individual taste.' They are also a matter of historical context, as I will note below. Labels are a kind of signs that point to generalized classifications. To be sure, there is a difference between descriptive labels and the intellectual distinctions on which typologies are based. Still, words that originate in attempts to free thought from imprecision or stereotyping can be turned into labels that, in turn, compartmentalize and marginalize ideas. The history of the word pacifism illustrates this process. It was created in 1901 in a deliberate effort to distinguish peace advocacy from antipatriotic defeatism and shirking of social responsibility.2 It meant the belief that international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means instead of war. Subsequently, the word was narrowed in common Anglo-American usage to connote the principled refusal to sanction any war or participate in military service.3 Thus, labels do matter because the more they are used, the more they constitute a new language whether technical or political - and the further removed they become from their historic usage. Perhaps it is for this reason, more than difficulties in pronunciation and etymology, that I prefer the phrase peace advocate to the word pacific-ism (although in his own historical writing Ceadel imbues the more technical term with content and context, thus making it more than a typological category). Adding difficulty, labels with contradictory meanings are fixed in the secondary literature. Thus, Roger Chickering and James Turner Johnson use the word Utopian to ascribe opposite characteristics to peace advocacy.4 Each use makes sense within the author's context, but the word cannot be generalized without losing the very distinctions to which each author points. And the substitution of another word does not resolve this problem. The word pacifism itself is a classic example of multiple usage. Peter Brock's historical canon is based on the use of pacifism in the strict sense of the principled refusal to sanction or participate in war, but the word is still used in its original and more general sense of substitut-\n\n38\n\nCharles Chatfield\n\ning peaceful processes for warfare, especially in European writing (and in Sandi Cooper's definitive history of the nineteenth-century European peace movement5). Introducing a new word (such as pacific-ism) does not relieve us of the task of interpreting the existing secondary and primary literature. There is also a subtle difference between definitions and distinctions. By definition we identify a subject of discourse in terms of precise outlines or boundaries, giving it a decisive and exclusive identity. By making a distinction, we use particular qualities to differentiate related subjects of discourse that can be understood only in relation to one another. Thus, having defined 'pacifism' as an exclusive position that rejects warfare altogether, Ceadel makes telling distinctions in relation to the focus, ethical inspiration, and political orientation of that rejection. Specific labels are not essential to the distinctions he makes, but context is crucial to relationships. Clearly defined categories are essential for political and historical distinctions, but analysis necessarily becomes modified in historical interpretation. Otherwise, the intellectual clarity implicit in typological categories would contravene the very ambiguity that is part of real life and therefore of real-life history. Perhaps this is why Peter Brock and John Howard Yoder, among others, willingly acknowledge variations in pacifism but resist rigid, definitive typologies of it.6 Ideas and ideologies interact only through persons and groups. People and organizations may be categorized, and that exercise contributes to our analytical description of their interactions. But this is not to be confused with understanding what they were about or thought they were about, or even what they thought about peace and war. Moreover, since distinctions beget distinctions, types beget types: absolutism, contingent absolutism, exemptionism. This may contribute to clarity of comparative analysis. But thus refined, intellectual distinctions can be misleading insofar as they articulate variations of thought as though they were discrete rather than relative positions, as abstract instead of contextual. In sum, linguistic fine-tuning is most appropriate to thinking about thought. In thinking about peace advocates and movements, though, it must not obscure the ambiguity of purpose that is often a fact of the life we seek to understand. These preliminary reflections on the value and limitations of categorical analysis can be extended in terms of some conventional categories of historic peace thinking.\n\nThinking about Peace in History\n\n39\n\nJust War, Peace Advocacy, and Pacifism\n\nThere is indeed a sense in which just war thought differs from both strict pacifism and peace advocacy in general.7 The just war tradition, although it limits war, accepts warfare as a given fact of social organization. By contrast, peace advocates have held that the abolition of war is possible and desirable, and strict pacifists have repudiated war altogether (although there is within the non-resistance tradition an important line of thought that regards violence as a given for unredeemed society). This distinction holds, however, only insofar as just war thought is understood as an intellectual and political paradigm (a model, for instance, of international relations). Understood as an ethical paradigm, the distinction breaks down.8 The just war tradition is, of course, misnamed, because it has not interpreted war as 'just' per se. It has held, rather, that warfare may be justifiable may constitute an ethical choice - if and only if it meets certain criteria for the authority and conduct of war (jus ad bellum and jus in bello). Insofar as the tradition delineates choices rather than wars, it offers an ethical paradigm. It was as moral philosophy that it was given systematic development by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scholars - notably Franciscus de Victoria and Francisco Suares, William Ames and John Locke, and especially Hugo Grotius. Although they grounded their thought in natural law rather than formal theology, they were concerned with moral theory. Grotius sought an alternative to those who, as he wrote, 'believe that in war nothing is lawful' and those 'for whom all things are lawful in war.'9 That was the objective of St Augustine well before Grotius and of Reinhold Niebuhr long after: to bring warfare within the purview of moral law. Although the moral theory of justifiable war has been interpreted quite differently in various eras, it has consistently been assumed that a choice for or against warfare is relative to and contingent upon political circumstances. As an ethical model, therefore, it could be (and has often been) consonant with peace advocacy in general, insofar as both are moral theories of relative goodness. Limiting the scope of war is consonant with increasing the sphere of peace. In Ceadel's terms, both are reformist. In this respect, the just war tradition has differed from strict, or absolute pacifism, for which war is intrinsically unethical (at least for the pacifist community), but even here one must be careful. In some of its early versions, as again recently, the tradition incorporated\n\n40\n\nCharles Chatfield\n\nthe obligation of conscientious objection to specific wars in the light of just war criteria.10 Moreover, Immanuel Kant framed his views on Perpetual Peace (1795) on the explicit assumption that there is no fundamental dichotomy between practical politics and intrinsic values. Whatever the merits of that position, its meaning derives from an ethical paradigm. Understood as a historical paradigm, too, just war thought has been consonant with general peace advocacy. It is becoming clear, for example, that the medieval formulation of just war codes such as the Peace and Truce of God was part of a vast process of social transformation.11 A similar process seems to have taken place during the Renaissance, when aggressive war was defined and proscribed in recognition of national sovereignty.12 Or, to return to Grotius, his historical context dictated that his exposition of just war thought presaged peace advocacy: why else was he and not his predecessors remembered as 'the father of international law'? It was, as one of his translators remarked, 'that Europe, with feudalism in its death-throes and Church and Empire riven asunder, had urgent need of a general theory of the State, of the nation, and its organization. The contractual theory of government was now rising out of the dissolving feudal system, and here was Grotius frankly developing that theory by a bold assimilation of public powers to private rights. So it was the general course of events, the very atmosphere of a rapidly changing and developing Europe, that determined the reputation and influence that the De Jure Belli was to enjoy and command.'13 As a historical phenomenon, then, the just war tradition has been consonant with the program of peace advocates. Indeed, the internationalism of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries heralded a social transformation on a global scale. One part of this has been the development of the law of war as an encompassing and 'homogeneous body of rules applicable to the modern state of war.' These rules are fully consolidated and codified, and they are now widely acknowledged even when they are violated. The law of war epitomizes the just war tradition. Whether or not it has limited warfare, it has expanded the concept of international community to include protection for individuals, and it has also imposed obligations upon state and non-state groups (both intergovernmental agencies and such non-governmental groups as liberation movements and guerillas), all of which are bound together 'by the reason of equality of belligerence.'14 In this historical context the just war tradition has been not only consonant with peace advocacy but an instrument of it.\n\nThinking about Peace in History\n\n41\n\nIn any case, the relationship of the just war tradition, peace advocacy, and strict pacifism hinges on a distinction between intellectual or political constructs and ethical or historical paradigms. As an intellectual construct or political program, warfare itself is not a justifiable institution for peace advocates or pacifists. In a specific historical situation or in a relative and contingent ethic, however, a war can command the reluctant endorsement of peace advocates as being justifiable, although not the endorsement of strict pacifists (at least not for themselves). Existential circumstances determine to what extent peace advocates respond to political possibilities or a sense of ethical obligation. Moreover, the interplay between these three traditions over time suggests that periods and processes of historical transformation offer categories of peace history as important as specific ideologies of war and peace. Varieties of Peace Advocacy Perhaps it would be useful to redefine the relationship of the three conventional traditions in historical terms. To begin with, we might identify all intellectual positions, organization, and activity designed to limit, eliminate, or reject warfare as forms of peace advocacy. Quite simply, our universe of discourse is that which denies the inherent, positive value of war and seeks alternatives to it.15 It is the alternative to militarism. This definition is not quite arbitrary, since it encompasses all those who historically have claimed to favour and advance peace over war, even if they believed that warfare is in some sense inescapable. It does not include those who have argued that war is inherently good, even if they claimed that it results in some kind of peace. Until at least the later medieval phase of Western civilization, war was indeed regarded as an inevitable characteristic of social organization. That assumption qualified two broad categories of peace advocacy: efforts to limit and control warfare, and refusals to participate in it. The first was developed in the diplomacy of the Greek city states and the rules of warfare assumed by the Roman empire. It was articulated by St Augustine and others in terms of moral criteria, which in conjunction with codes of chivalry, custom, and canon law, evolved into the just war tradition. The second was institutionalized in the early Christian church. It was periodically "
