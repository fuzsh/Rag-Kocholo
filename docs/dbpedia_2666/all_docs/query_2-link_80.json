My thanks to Professor Dilys Hill for her editorial and stylistic advice on an earlier draft, to Dr Anne White for her meticulous reading of a later version, to Audrey Daly and Carolann Martin for their expertise with the final copy, and to my editor at I.B.Tauris, Elizabeth Munns. I also wish to thank the anonymous publishers’ reviewers for their advice, which I have attempted, where appropriate or possible, to follow. Above all, I am grateful to my family for their encouragement and support through the years in which I have pursued dietetic heretics. This work is dedicated to them. James Gregory, 2006\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBelieving that their cause was ‘favourable to health, peace, and happiness, and has a tendency to abolish everything that makes us miserable in this world’, a select group of Britons established the first vegetarian society in the modern western world in 1847 and struggled thereafter to reform the diet of their contemporaries. 1 A seemingly marginal phenomenon, vegetarianism actually involved much that was of concern to the culture of Victorian Britain.2 Whilst never a mass movement, and certainly far from attaining the level of support it now enjoys, vegetarianism became a vocal movement which attracted attention that ranged from the serious response of scientific men, the incorporation of vegetarian recipes in cookery books, to the skits on vegetarian dinners, restaurants, animal-free clothing and enthusiasts which appeared in satirical journals and theatrical sketches. The responses to the various challenges vegetarianism offered means that a study of the movement is important for our understanding of Victorian society. Of the challenges to Victorian practices and attitudes, the most obvious were related to food: a subject involving a host of major questions about, for instance, supply and national sufficiency, national and social identity, charity and the working-class budget, and sociability. But vegetarianism also had implications for the relationship of man to animals, and for violence between humans (thus vegetarians were often against war, against capital punishment and violent punishments in general), and also had things to say about the role of women, through claims, for instance, to liberate women from unpleasant kitchen duties. Most Victorians assumed the vegetarians were ‘radical’ in their associations, it being understood that dietetic heresy went with other heresies of bodily self-culture, politics, and religion. However, through its connections to a wider temperance movement (teetotalism) and spiritualism, vegetarianism was actually part of broader movements rather than a fringe concern. In its gender roles\n\n2\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nthis seemingly counter-cultural movement actually reflected Victorian mores rather than fulfilled any radical potential. And like temperance, many contemporary working class and socialist opponents thought vegetarianism played into employers’ hands in its guise as a campaign for thrift and economy, for many advocates saw it as a way of living on small wages (though with the beneficial result of using the savings for selfimprovement), or as a cheap but wholesome form of soup philanthropy. A more general, non-vegetarian ‘food reform’ was concerned with teaching the working classes about food values, economic recipes and substitutes at times of economic hardship. This wider food reform could potentially give the vegetarians a sympathetic audience, and they attempted to attract support through lectures, pamphlets and classes, by addressing the plight of the malnourished poor. Thus, though vegetarianism was far from being a ‘central’ concern to most people, it was not neglected by the mainstream. Many cultural figures commented on the movement when it emerged in the midnineteenth century, and when, revitalized, it returned to prominence in the late nineteenth century. Some leading Victorians indeed, investigated the diet and dabbled in dietetic reform. From the unfamiliar perspective of Victorian vegetarianism, through a study of the movement and its reception, this book provides an entry into a broader world of reform of body and soul, habits and manners, and of society. It is as a movement that this study primarily treats vegetarianism, rather than as an ideology. The latter aspect has been well studied before, in the undeservedly neglected and unpublished doctoral research by Julia Twigg. Although Twigg was concerned primarily with analyzing this ideology (and published two essays which reflected this focus on ideology), the movement’s general history from c.1847-1980 was ably set out as part of a wider ‘field of social relations’ giving meaning to the ideology. Here, whilst building on Twigg’s insightful research, I am keen to study the social history of the movement with the level of detail that her broader canvas made impossible. 3 The study provides an in-depth treatment of the movement as a ‘lived’ experience, and as a campaign. As the latter, British vegetarianism began with the creation of the Vegetarian Society (hereafter abbreviated to VS) by a few hundred men and women who had already been promoting vegetarianism as part of their religious beliefs, hygienic reform or utopian experiments. The transition from private endeavour to public movement in order to further the adoption of their diet led to provincial branches, lecturing campaigns, printed propaganda and a range of alternative commodities. Though the movement lacked a ‘Meat Bill’ equivalent to the prohibitionists’ ‘Drink Bill’ or any likelihood of prohibition it occasionally\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nlobbied government and politicians. This agitation attracted adherents in sizeable numbers by the late-Victorian period, so that by 1899, when several other organizations were also active in Britain, the senior vegetarian society had almost six thousand members and associates. Since one member often represented a family group, and since throughout the period there was an unquantifiable number of experimenting ‘considerers’, the total number of deliberate vegetarians (as opposed to the many thousands practically vegetarian through poverty) was much higher. This book is a study of the movement but inevitably also of vegetarianism itself. Though the primary concern is not to explore ideology, one needs to understand the various elements to vegetarianism to understand its appeal and challenge. Through a study of its hygienic, religious, zoophilist, radical and ‘fadical’ aspects, a study of the diet is a study of Victorian culture. Though some of these aspects have been touched on by historians working in various different disciplines, these themes are brought together here in order to fully understand this polyvalent and multivocal movement. One could open this study out to consider the movement’s associations with what by the late-Victorian period was an international phenomenon, with North American, continental European and imperial connections. Indeed, from its earliest days British vegetarianism was connected to an international elite of ultra-temperance and other reform movements.4 This included Grahamism, an American health movement based on the ideas of Sylvester Graham which incorporated vegetarianism and whose heyday was in the 1830s. 5 The Dutch Marxist historian Jan Romein presented vegetarianism as a component of the ‘little religions’ in his study of the European fin de siècle, and interpreted these as expressive of ‘the bad conscience of a ruling class that was no longer convinced of its divine right to rule but not yet under sufficient threat to take full stock of its shortcomings’. 6 The German ‘Natural Living’ movement and German vegetarianism have been the focus of numerous studies. Attitudes to animals in France, where vegetarianism failed to flourish, have also been examined. The Russian movement has recently been analysed in detail.7 Mahatma Gandhi’s association with the London vegetarians in the lateVictorian period is perhaps the most famous episode in the relationship between vegetarians in Britain and the subcontinent. Not the least of its political aspects was the challenge vegetarianism presented in an empire where ‘British’ food habits encountered the dietetic ‘other’. 8 However, reasons of space prevent any study here of the links between the British vegetarians and others. This study ends in 1901. Apart from the wish as a ‘Victorianist’ to illuminate the nineteenth century and keep the work to manageable length,\n\n4\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nthe twentieth century presents a larger scale movement, though there are often echoes of the Victorian movement in later activities. General histories of western vegetarianism covering the recent past already exist, such as Colin Spencer’s well-known survey history of vegetarianism.9 In the twentieth century developments in food technology and food science, altered attitudes to non-western diet and religion (and general developments in religious belief), mean a different context to vegetarianism: making it, in many ways, an easier practice to follow (through manufactured substitutes, greater understanding of nutrition, proliferation and specialization of food retail and retail of culinary equipment, and the decline in the force of scriptural injunctions for most Britons). The vegetarian movement was a topic of debate and interest in the nineteenth century. Though the British public never became enamoured of the movement to a great extent, or even to the degree that a few of its contemporary reforms enjoyed, its concerns were of relevance in the broader world of reform (partly because vegetarians were often not merely vegetarians), and more generally in British culture. If the movement has been one of the few under-explored British reform movements of the era, and is practically ignored by the popular historiography on the period, this study argues that the movement was a significant phenomenon. In an age worried about overpopulation, environmental catastrophe, and the ethics and health risks of industrialized food production, vegetarianism has acquired an acknowledged relevance in western discourse. Sociologists identify it as one of the components of movements that make non-materialist concerns about ‘personal identity’ and ‘lifestyle’ the focus of politics, the so-called ‘new social movements’ (also including feminism, environmentalism, lesbian and gay movements) that they argue were a development of post-industrial western societies. But concern to reform lifestyle is not a recent or ‘post-modern’ development: for critics have shown that these movements descend from or reiterate nineteenthcentury concerns.10 This book examines the origins of these present day concerns and responses. As a consequence of the diversity of motivations for adopting vegetarianism and the variety of forms vegetarianism took, exploration of the Victorian movement needs to draw on research by scholars working in a number of fields. The most obvious category, histories of western vegetarianism, is an expanding one, which has offered broad narrative, exploration of ideology (in the case especially of Twigg), and sociology, including its gendered dimensions (in the case of Carol J. Adams most famously11). The most recent large-scale study has been Tristram Stuart’s fine cultural history of Western responses to Indian vegetarianism from\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nthe seventeenth century.12 Modern scholarship has also included smaller scale work on the vegetarian-teetotal Cowherdites (or Bible Christians) active in Salford and Manchester after splitting from mainstream Swedenborgianism in 1809, and the progressive press in the Isle of Man which, in exploiting legal loopholes, produced vegetarian periodicals in the 1840s.13 But from the beginning of the movement there was an internal genealogical impulse which demonstrated the diet’s antiquity through essays which constructed a ‘canon’ descending from classical and biblical times.14 This can be explained as a response to the novelty of organized endeavour and anxiety about vigour and reach. Precociously, the vegetarian organ in the 1850s (the Vegetarian Messenger) collected material for a history of the first few years.15 Charles Forward produced Fifty Years of Food Reform for the movement’s jubilee in 1897. This, despite some sketchiness originating from its basis in short articles, was essentially accurate, and candid about the strains between the two major societies of the period, the Manchester-based VS and the new London Vegetarian Society (hereafter abbreviated to LVS).16 As Forward’s history makes clear, vegetarianism frequently positioned itself as ‘ultra temperance’. Like much research on Victorian reform movements, this study is indebted to the work of Brian Harrison who has emphasized the interconnecting reform interests of temperance leaders and rank-and-file, and who uncovered a rich body of material in his study of the temperance press.17 The close study by medical and social historians of hydropathy, medical botany, mesmerism, and other contemporary (and often associated) medical unorthodoxies, also provides this work with a wider context of hygienic reform. Another important area in which vegetarianism has previously been briefly considered is in histories of animal welfare and human/animal relations, vegetarianism being interpreted as an outcome of the growth of ‘humane’ feeling, also reflected in more mainstream zoophilist movements and in antivivisectionism. If many vegetarians were animal lovers, their sympathies were not limited to animals, and the ethical dimension to the movement also involved concern about human suffering and pain. Vegetarians supported campaigns against violent or capital punishment; their organization took off at the same time as a revived anti-capital punishment movement and experienced similar lack of public sympathy.18 Those associated with anti-capital punishment efforts were often radical reformers more generally, and one key area for previous treatment of vegetarianism has been histories of radicalism. Such radicals include the poet Shelley, who saw carnivorism as the ‘root of all evil’ and whose espousal of vegetarianism was shared by others in Romantic circles in the early nineteenth century. Working-class radicals also adopted vegetarians.19\n\n6\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nThis association between dietetic heresy and other radicalisms was also apparent during the next period of radical ferment, the first Victorian decade. The so-called ‘moral radicalism’ of the Quaker Joseph Sturge and his followers provides one middle-class location for vegetarian sympathies, along with other social, moral and ‘physiological reforms’. As this research demonstrates, personal reform can be political, and recent work on radical middle-class women and the private sphere in the early-Victorian period has also emphasized the political nature of health reforms.20 Vegetarians themselves, competing in the marketplace of reforms, stressed their cause’s radical or fundamental implications for society. Advocates asserted vegetarianism’s indispensability for personal and social regeneration. Like temperance, vegetarianism was advocated on the basis of plebeian or lower middle-class self-improvement and self-help in institutions such as mechanics’ institutes from the late 1840s. Another area where the plebeian element to vegetarianism can be seen is spiritualism, a movement with a strong plebeian following. Studies of spiritualism mention the interest in diet as part of a range of concerns for a self-styled ‘advanced’ movement. Historians of late-Victorian esoteric movements which attracted women as members and leaders have also noted the vegetarian dimension. Such associations prefigure vegetarianism’s place in the modern ‘New Age’. Utopia, whether actual experimentation, or fictional and prospective, invariably involves dietetic radicalism. Food reform surfaced in several utopian experiments in England and America in the 1840s. Vegetarianism is an under-explored aspect of the radical world of Owenite socialists, ‘new move’ Chartists and others in the 1840s. It was the community at Alcott House c.1838-49 (which despite its links to Owenism was not Owenite) that coined the word ‘vegetarian’.21 Similarly, a ‘back-to-the-land’ movement in the late nineteenth century (with parallels in continental Europe, North America and South America) provided another location for vegetarian activity combined with social and moral reforms.22 By the 1890s vegetarianism was a cliché of utopian fiction.23 This practical and literary dabbling in dietetic reform by late-Victorians reflected the revival of the British movement from the 1870s and an ensuing vigour and publicity which was unparalleled. It took its place amongst esoteric religions and anti-vivisectionist efforts in the ‘lateVictorian revolt’ (continuing in the Edwardian period) when there was ‘an unusual amount of activity of radical-eccentric nature’.24 In that famous diatribe, Max Nordau interpreted vegetarianism as another sign of fin de siècle degeneracy.25 Vegetarianism was also acknowledged as a feature of the fin de siècle in the classic early studies by R.C.K. Ensor (himself\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nvegetarian) and Holbrook Jackson, though surprisingly it is ignored in more recent work on the ‘Eighteen Nineties’.26 This period also saw the emergence of socialism, and the reformed diet became a topic for debate in the socialist press and clubs, not least because, if some leading socialists were sympathetic, others viewed vegetarianism as a capitalist tool. 27 Fin de siècle efforts to create a new morality involved food reform, and so vegetarianism is occasionally glanced at in studies of, for instance, the early Fabians who included vegetarians such as Bernard Shaw and Edith Nesbit, the writer of children’s literature. One ‘advanced’ location of vegetarian discussion in this period, the feminist and pro-labour journal Shafts, has been studied, and the significance of vegetarianism for some late-Victorian and Edwardian feminists has been recognized.28 Despite vegetarianism’s association with the radical and progressive the transformation it offered was not necessarily liberating. Identified along with other physiological reforms as a form of ‘physical puritanism’ in the 1850s, it can be associated with a more general Victorian ‘puritanism’.29 If plebeian adherents saw it as a means to self-mastery, another interpretation might be that dietary ‘regimen’ was primarily a bourgeois response to urbanization and industrialization: a disciplinary effort especially directed at working-class bodies. Thus the sociologist Bryan Turner, who has proposed a theory of the ‘somatic society’ where personal or political problems are problematized and expressed through the body, has charted changing dietary regimens, from those advocated for the professional and urban classes in the eighteenth century to those stimulated by anxieties about the labouring classes from the second half of the nineteenth century, when working-class diet became a subject of concern through anxieties about public health, urban poverty and national efficiency.30 The first part of this study provides a history of the movement in a single chapter. It first examines the background to the establishment of the VS, through a survey of activity from around 1840-46. It then outlines the Victorian movement, identifying and analyzing some of the main features of the movement in terms of location, institutions and activity, and personnel. Previously this has had no detailed attention, with published work concentrating either on communitarian locations or on activity in Manchester and the ‘industrial north’. The metropolitan and provincial activity across Britain shows the movement’s place in a larger radical or progressive world, but also shows how vegetarianism was applied to social problems as an additional force in mainstream philanthropic dissemination of ‘bread and knowledge’.\n\n8\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nThe second part of this study dissects the movement by exploring and contextualizing the varieties of (or dimensions to) vegetarianism, with a chapter on ‘physical puritanism’ and vegetarianism’s relationship with medical orthodoxy (chapter two); a chapter which examines vegetarianism as an animal welfare movement, its religious dimensions and relationship with spiritualism (chapter three); and a chapter examining its radicalism and ‘anti-everythingarian’ tendency (chapter four). The latter chapter emphasizes how categories were blurred not simply as a propagandist convenience, but because followers were not monomaniacs with a dietetic obsession despite the frequent pejorative labels that also appeared in criticism of other ‘anti’ movements confronting customary behaviour (‘faddish’, ‘crankish’, ‘crotchety’, ‘eccentric’, and ‘sentimental’). The second part then, is an attempt to define the movement, with the conclusion that like temperance and other health reforms, the movement was a personal physiological reform, a moral crusade and social movement, with ‘political’ associations despite a tension between more obviously political movements. The third part is concerned with the vegetarians’ dietetic practice in private and public, the role of a vegetarian press, and the movement’s social base. It begins by considering vegetarians’ own culinary practices and gustatory attitudes, and then explores the movement’s physical manifestation through its own commodities, and restaurants and press (chapter five). The vegetarian press emerges as an important aspect to the movement. The examination of restaurants continues the exploration of vegetarianism’s geographical and institutional locations. Their roles in vegetarian activism and as locations for allied radicalisms are examined. Study of the restaurants’ growth and fortunes provides evidence about the growth of the movement, and also about the social base which is further examined, alongside gender, in the next chapter (chapter six). The relative appeal of the movement to the ‘classes’ of Victorian Britain and the specific attempts to attract plebeian support are considered, by examining the literature which explicitly addressed contemporaries in terms of the dietetic needs of classes, and the response to the movement from socialists and co-operators. The role of women is examined, through study of gender roles in general and consideration of the Women’s Vegetarian Union in particular. Finally the movement’s representation by others (chapter seven) is studied. The chapter is a consideration of literary responses to the diet and its practitioners: the discourse on vegetarianism in a variety of prose works, including works of fiction and in the national or local press, was extensive, and certainly more than one might assume. The ambivalent relationship of the movement to ‘modernity’, which is one\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nof the themes apparent in the discourse on the movement, is considered in the conclusion. Vegetarians, trusting to the power of the printed word, were prolific writers and their journals, books and pamphlets are core material for this study. Apart from the sparse documentation of the early years (1847-55) there are extensive minute books for the VS, the London Vegetarian Auxiliary, and LVS. In addition, there are minutes and related material belonging to the St Pancras branch, the Dundee food reform society and traces of material from the Liverpool Society. Their activities and those of many other vegetarian societies were fully reported in the vegetarian press. Material relating to the Women’s Vegetarian Union is in the British Library, and the John Johnson Collection in the Bodleian Library, which also has other vegetarian ephemera. To assess the status of vegetarianism within a wider reform world, I have also examined periodicals promoting philanthropic or progressive causes in general, and specific concerns such as temperance, anti-tobacco, peace, phonetic reform and spiritualism. Because many who were not simply reforming their diet for purely personal health reasons were concerned with other causes (though being the former did not exclude the latter), the broader survey has been crucial for understanding this particular group of so-called ‘anti-everythingarians’. These ‘ultras’ were not however, merely agitators for a nexus of negatives. This is made clear by studying the lives of prominent individuals such as James Simpson and Arnold Hills, the early and late-Victorian leaders of the movement. Regrettably their papers do not exist, nor are there any papers belonging to William Horsell, the first secretary of the Vegetarian Society. However, privately-owned material does exist relating to the London vegetarian George Dornbusch and the teetotal-vegetarian publishing partner of Horsell, Job Caudwell. A unique view of early vegetarian and associated radical circles in London is provided by the recently discovered papers of the eccentric Pierre Baume. The papers of Thomas R. Allinson, the late-Victorian naturopath, in Edinburgh University, include a rare archive of vegetarian ephemera, as does the archive relating to his contemporary labour activist and vegetarian Joseph Edwards at the Liverpool Records Office. Glimpses of vegetarian activity may be found in the papers of the social and moral reformers Lord Mount Temple and his wife Georgina, at the University of Southampton. This study uncovers the unfamiliar and exploits new material, avoiding a concentration on the activities of the Cowherdites and well-known vegetarians such as the social and sexual reformer Edward Carpenter, the Fabian and playwright Bernard Shaw and those other Victorians whose vegetarianism is identified (or in some cases ignored) in entries in the Dictionary of National Biography. The commitment of the updated [Oxford]\n\n10\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nDNB to broadening national biography has involved the inclusion of others, such as William Horsell. Detailed research on pioneering vegetarians such as Horsell, the poet James Elmzlie Duncan and the grain merchant Dornbusch, underpin this study. A unique glimpse into provincial activity in the early movement was possible through the diary of one mid-Victorian vegetarian in Worcester.31 Apart from this, the close study of obituaries, testimonies and interviews in the vegetarian press and those of other reform movements provides much on the humbler vegetarians, and allows a prosopographical approach to replace the assertions made by the VS through their propaganda (including statistical analyses), with concrete and rich information on the religious affiliations, occupational background, varied motivations and interconnections of adherents and sympathizers. If historians need to relate the movement to larger developments such as urbanization and secularization, we need to know and ask questions about who was attracted to the movement and how they saw their place in the ‘age of reform’. 32 Since vegetarianism often formed a part of an omnium gatherum of radical positions, it offers an entry into that ‘anti-everythingarianism’ which has been noted by historians of Victorian reform, but has not received close treatment. In fact, study of the vegetarians is an especially fruitful means of investigating this phenomenon because, as an extreme, it attracted fewer supporters than more mainstream reforms, and so provides the researcher with a more manageable group to deal with. Also, because what was involved was a reform of life style, the movement’s journalism contains many detailed biographies and membership lists, in contrast, for instance, to the paucity of rank-and-file information for the anti-vivisection movement.\n\nFIGURE 1. The Vegetarian, organ of late nineteenth century metropolitan vegetarianism, promoting a specious origin for the word ‘vegetarian’ (2 May 1896).\n\nSpecialist diets played a part in separating vegetarians into various schools, so that the appropriateness of the word ‘vegetarian’ became\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nquestioned. The commonsense etymology (deriving ‘vegetarian’ from the eating of vegetables) was obfuscated in the 1870s to counter the popular view that the diet was composed of raw vegetables. But as Kenneth Romanes pointed out in the German vegetarian journal Vegetarische Warte, an etymology derived from the Latin for spirit, vegetus, was ‘entirely an after-thought of the scholars and ... had no place whatever in the minds of the originators of modern vegetarianism’.33 Those who wanted to attract wider support also spoke of ‘dietetic reform’. 34 Proponents, like other reformers, used a multitude of justifications, but when one comes to examine individuals, a neat classification into ‘ethical’ or ‘hygienic’ is often unhelpful. But controversies over the name echoed differences of opinion over rationale and emphases, reflecting the sometimes competing ethical, medical and economic motivations. Internal debates about what constituted the best diet, morally or physiologically led to ‘fruitarianism’, a coinage of the later 1870s; and stricter definitions of a bloodless diet brought a few people to a position which, though it was to be distinguished by a separate name only in the 1940s (veganism) existed well before then. Though this necessary excursus on etymology highlights the part specialist diets had in separating out the vegetarians, the study’s primary concern is not the food they promoted but the movement’s social history and connections with other reforms. The reader will find only morsels of vegetarian cuisine, perhaps in keeping with that strand in vegetarianism concerned to divert people from sensuality to higher things. Another reason for not privileging food is that, despite its etymology, vegetarianism was from the start concerned with other forms of consumption. But given that many people took the reform at face-value as an agitation concerned with eating, it makes sense to contextualize this study by a brief consideration of the Victorians and food. Food and the Victorians Moral, religious and political considerations no less than the natural promptings of appetite, influence the individual and community in the preference for certain articles of food and the rejection of others.35\n\nThough their critics often treated their efforts as time wasted on worldly and insignificant matters, to be a committed vegetarian was to engage in debates on food which took in the ethics and economics of its production, its nutrition and aesthetics. Food was a significant and pervasive subject in Victorian culture, offering a ‘culinary nationalism’, signifying the march of ‘progress’, or imperilling it through faulty supply and adulteration,\n\n12\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nfeaturing in the ‘gospel of thrift’, and prominently figuring in social life. The gustatory dimension to nineteenth-century culture, expressed in such diverse forms as the novels of Charles Dickens and the celebrations surrounding all manner of local and national events, was substantial. Examination of ‘foodways’ therefore provides a constituent element rather than a mere ‘flavour’ of the past. Fears of a Malthusian crisis of population outstripping food supply stimulated a great deal of early nineteenth-century writing, with solutions sought in emigration, ‘home colonization’ and the exploitation of wastelands, even (for a few advocates) birth-control. 36 It was a matter of national policy and security. Politics was focused on the ‘staff of life’ during the Corn Laws agitation; conflict between free traders and protectionists concerned ‘taxes on food’, many of which were abolished or lowered. The Irish famine also made food a major question. The imperial dimension was reflected in colonial imports and the export of British foodways. Crises, such as Indian famines, were matters of imperial policy. Always the concern of local authorities (with food riots into the midVictorian period), food was increasingly regulated as health reform, chemistry and food technologies developed. Although food manufacture only became industrialized late in the century, the production and processing of food were major sources of employment throughout the period. Scientists synthesized flavours and explored new ways of preserving and manufacturing foods, such as the ‘extract of meat’ promoted by the chemist Justus von Liebig in 1865.37 Improvements in food production and quality could be identified as ‘keeping pace with the progressive movement of the last fifty years’. 38 Technology was also applied to domestic food production, with the emergence of gas-fuelled fires, refrigerators, cookers and, by the end of the period, electric cookers. By contrast, for social reformers, poor diet was a sign of the failure of modern society, the pursuit of good food a theme in propaganda and part of the vision of a reformed world. Diet was one of the vexed questions to be dealt with by prison and workhouse authorities. The modern age, for reasons of economy or social hygiene, seemed to involve the proliferation of specialist dietaries. Social investigators explored the food budgets and cooking habits of the poor. Following their late-eighteenth-century forebears, Victorian philanthropists and health reformers agitated for cookery classes, cheap utensils and fuel, and alternative foods.39 Working-class self-help and mutuality involved food provision; the ‘movement culture’ of working-class radicalism included the marketing of alternative foodstuffs.40 Dietetic aspirations fed into the programmes of working-class social reformers such as Chartists and co-operators. The\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nearly-nineteenth century radical leader William Cobbett’s oft-quoted remark ‘I defy you to agitate a fellow on a full stomach’ expresses another link between availability of cheap food and the fortunes of radical activity. 41 The opponents of later radicals were acutely aware that food provided ‘excuse for the work of political incendiaries of all kinds, and for the fatal endeavours of democrats’.42 Food was a marker of class, gender and age. 43 The proliferation of domestic and culinary guides reflected both a general growth in the press and revealed the social significance of dining as a way of maintaining appearances and marking membership of the upper and middle-classes, through conspicuous consumption and rules of etiquette that provided pitfalls for the arriviste.44 The working class devoted the largest proportion of their earnings to food; their womenfolk sacrificed health to provide men with a more nutritious meal to fuel their hard and lengthy manual work.45 Men were defined as breadwinners: interference in their right and duty to provide food for their dependents was seen as a violation of the sanctity of the family and a ‘desecration of the freeman’s dignity’.46 Diet was also a marker of nationality, region and locality and helped identify racial and religious differences. 47 It has been argued that ‘after language, food is the most important bearer of national identity’. 48 Certainly the association between roast beef and Englishness was long established, and symbolised ‘manly English virtues’ and the ‘natural’, against the dietetic other of artifice, luxury, the potage maigre, or frogs’ legs of the French. The nation’s wealth was indicated through meat consumption: Britain was the heaviest consumer of meat in Europe. 49 This ‘culinary nationalism’ haunted vegetarians: the anthem created by Fielding and Leveridge in the eighteenth century, ‘The Roast Beef of Old England’, was the hostile chorus to their crusade. A poster condemning the dish, produced by the London Food Reform Society, was one response. 50 In practice most Englishmen ate beef rarely: for the poor, protein came from the sea (as in the Cornish diet), or from pigs, so vegetarians stressed the dangers of eating pork, and the serious problems with the meat consumed by most people.51 In 1863, Professor Gamgee’s researches for the Privy Council revealed that, though only a small proportion of meat was ever formally condemned, over one-fifth of the meat sold was unfit for consumption. The authenticity of meat products was suspect: Bobus Higgins the sausage-maker, in Thomas Carlyle’s Past and Present (1843), and Ford Madox Brown’s ‘Work’ (1852-63), enriched by his adulterations, was not alone in anticipating the French Hippophage Society’s introduction of horse flesh as a cheap article of food.52 Opponents repeatedly assured vegetarians that British pluck was based on beef, and beer. The Morning Chronicle found in 1849-50 that most\n\n14\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nEnglish agricultural labourers rarely ate meat (especially in southern England), and though there were improvements by the 1860s, butcher’s meat remained a rarity. Yet the ‘spare diet’ was stigmatised as a sign of poverty or asceticism. Henry Mayhew observed it was not something that English men liked to admit to: ‘Many a poor untaught Englishman will shrink from speaking of his spare diet, and his trouble to procure that; a reserve, too, much more noticeable among the men than the women.’53 A mixed diet in which flesh meat was a constant element was ‘practically the sort of diet to which all classes aspire’, the late-nineteenth-century vegetarian and former Eton master Henry Salt had to admit.54 The other great culinary symbol of Englishness was the plum-pudding: it was not surprising that vegetarians should publicise their substitute for the suet-based symbol of Christmas conviviality.55 Similarly, ‘porridge and Scotland went together’56: vegetarians gestured to the Scottish diet of oats as proof that national vigour was compatible with vegetarianism. Nutritionally the diet of the poor Scot was probably good, but it may not have been perceived thus, since it may have represented a recent deterioration in the quantity of animal foods available and hence been experienced as a decline. 57 Ireland provided proof too, for vegetarians, that a largely vegetable diet allowed physical efficiency. But many writers on diet believed the Irish dependence on potatoes was a sign of a lower civilization and the spread of potato dependency a mark of pauperization.58 Diet provided a key to the hierarchy of races or nations. Experts on these topics maintained that the British had become civilised, had become modern, through a mixed diet. But diet, or the methods of cookery, needed to be improved to make the most efficient use of the material (whether it was the foodstuffs, fuel, or time required). The journal Food told its readers in 1884 that ‘even now the great struggle for food mainly occupies the thought, the care, and the industry of the nation’. 59 The questions of population and self-sufficiency were certainly integral to vegetarian polemic from the movement’s earliest days. 60 Since meat was deemed to be crucial in the nation’s diet, vegetarianism often surfaced in debates about population and national or European food supply in meetings of savants such as the British Association; usually to be dealt with dismissively. 61 The supply of meat could be disrupted by epidemics as in 1866, when rinderpest threatened livestock; it could also be disrupted by the instability of foreign sources. But Victorians, even when their fears about a Malthusian crisis were calmed, worried about the strategic implications for a nation which depended on foreign food to feed its population. Groups as diverse as Tory anti-free traders and liberal members of the Land Nationalization Society (established in 1881) sought to exploit these fears in linking their\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nreform to concern about dependence on foreign supplies; so too did vegetarians.62 Agricultural improvements helped increase domestic production, and further solutions to potential shortages were advocated, such as the introduction of small proprietors proposed by Joseph Fisher in articles in the Morning Chronicle (1866) or the improvements to soil fertility suggested by the land surveyor and agricultural engineer John Ewart, who argued that increasing and improving the arable pasture would support the additional livestock required.63 Whatever the proposals, increasing the meat supply was seen as a major question. It is not surprising, given these meat-centred anxieties, that preserved meat featured at exhibitions such as the International Exhibition at South Kensington in 1862.64 Stimulated by population growth and the problems with domestic meat supply, new preservation technologies were tested. The Society of Arts established a prize for a method to transport raw meat into Britain. Tinned and salted meat came from Chicago, but its greasiness and stringiness made it unpopular. Meat supplies from Australia and New Zealand were reported in newspapers. In February 1869, Public Health discussed the ‘great Food Question’ in relation to imports of colonial meat, and noted the Duke of Edinburgh’s recommendation that this was sweet, juicy and solid. 65 The journalist and statistician Michael Mulhall thought that New Zealand offered an alternative supply of meat if the Americas were insufficient, demonstrated that the population could not be sustained on the domestic supply of cattle, and remarked that new sources of meat for Britain were a strange outcome of the industry of a small number of settlers who had transformed cannibal islands.66 However, this meat was generally of poor quality and in 1871-72 a couple of workhouses even rioted against Australian meats.67 If the meat had not improved by the 1880s (when preservation by ice became satisfactory), nevertheless the supply came to be depended upon by the working classes by the end of the Victorian era. Entrepreneurs and philanthropists promoted alternative sources of protein, such as fish, or ‘acclimatized’ exotic mammals – whose relocation expressed domination of non-European fauna.68 Hippophagy was perhaps the most controversial alternative, widely discussed in the mid-Victorian press, but on the whole in a bantering tone. Horse-flesh was seen as a solution to a dearth of meat during the cattle-plague of 1865-67; but attempts to emulate the Parisian banquet hippophagique of 1865, itself stimulated in part by official concerns about the low consumption of meat in comparison with the British, were unsuccessful. A ‘Society for the Propagation of Horseflesh as an Article of Food’ hosted a dinner at the Langham Hotel in 1868 to promote the meat. There were lectures on the\n\n16\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nsubject and subsequent French propaganda revived the idea in 1875, but the British response remained unsympathetic.69 Food adulteration was pervasive in nineteenth century Britain due to urbanization, industrialization and the particular circumstances of trades (such as competition in the retail of beer and tea), with profound medical, social and economic effects.70 It became a matter of medical or scientific concern from the early 1850s, for men such as John Postgate, Henry Letheby, John Simon and Arthur Hassall. The findings of analytical chemistry, printed in The Lancet from 1851-54, were widely reported.71 The evidence of widespread adulteration led to the formation of a national society, the Anti-Adulteration Association, and local societies, to agitate for ‘prompt and efficient legislation’. At Birmingham, for instance, six meetings were held and in February 1856 there were resolutions on municipal food and drug tests, and the Home Office was petitioned.72 In parliament the question was treated by radicals and Tories as a test of free trade. Those who called for legislation against adulteration risked being accused of treating the populace as infantile rather than informed and rational consumers free to avoid the patently fraudulent goods. Tory opponents of Free Trade depicted the ‘poor man’ as at the mercy of the retailer.73 Commentators pointed to the implications for national reputation from the wholesale fraud being committed.74 The poor, the main victims of adulteration, whose stomachs were (in the words of the co-operator G.J. Holyoake) ‘the waste basket of the market’, organized to secure the purity of their food through such establishments as flour mills created in the eighteenth century, and in the co-operative movement.75 Holyoake noted that the co-operative People’s Mill in Leeds ‘wisely’ supported the local Anti-Adulteration Society’s efforts in 1855, judging this involvement to demonstrate respect and interest for the community.76 Food supply co-operatives were recommended by philanthropists partly for their protection against adulteration and poor quality. The purity and genuineness of foods came to be stressed in advertisements in the 1850s but adulteration remained a problem even after legislation enabled local authorities to appoint public analysts from the 1870s. Samuel Smiles’s opinion that the ‘spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in the individual; and, exhibited in the lives of the many, it constitutes the true source of national strength and vigour’ received much support. 77 Amongst the virtues retrospectively seen as characteristically ‘Victorian’, thrift has been given prominence, though it was not confined to British culture.78 Part of the ‘hard way’ along with ‘character’, punctuality and duty, thrift helped fuel the Victorian engine of self-help.79 Though thrift was a necessity for middle-class families keen to display their\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nrespectability, discourse on thrift was directed especially at the poor by their betters, in sermon, lecture, tract, newspaper article and visitation. Thrift was about self-sacrifice and abstinence quite as much as it was about recycling and avoidance of waste, to make the poor moral and useful. Poverty and destitution, it was believed by many, could be eradicated partly through thrift. But this virtue was, according to Smiles, ‘the growth of experience and example’.80 The organizations established to exemplify and promote thrift ranged from the local savings clubs to penny banks, the Penny Office Savings Bank (established 1861) and a variety of social reform societies. Edwin Chadwick’s Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain (1842) accounted for poor health partly through domestic mismanagement which amounted to lack of thrift: the ‘huckster dealing’ in an improvident manner, the extravagant purchase of small quantities of food, indulgence in meat and drink. 81 Thrift concerned domestic management in general, not simply advocating foresight in savings. Food was part of the problem, and hence the outrage of food reformers who wanted to eradicate adulteration. Foods made cheap because of adulteration were deceptions, their existence prevented accurate domestic economy. Waste was to be deplored in the kitchen, hence the value placed on equipment such as the ‘digester’, designed to convert all the scraps into nourishing soup, and the stockpot and the eulogising by domestic economists (and early apologists for factory conditions), of the French soup: a ‘potage economy’ where nothing was thrown away. Newspapers and journals reported on schemes for cookery classes throughout the period. Much of the advice on food thrift was irrelevant to the poor however: too expensive in terms of equipment, fuel, and time. The promotion of thrift as virtue and social panacea had its critics. The vegetarian movement’s place in the discourse of thrift is one theme in its dialogue with the working classes, and will be explored more closely in a later chapter. It is sufficient at this stage to point out that some vegetarians found the economic argument offensively selfish and preferred more ‘ideal’ arguments to those of the ‘breech pocket’. But there was a wider attitude towards food which saw pleasure as something to be avoided. Vegetarianism can partly be seen as a dietetic form of puritanism, with the promotion of ‘simplicity of taste’ as a moral rather than aesthetic virtue, though vegetarians were not necessarily ascetics. Old Testament-derived scruples about eating foods with blood or which derived from strangled animals might also figure. In Samuel Butler’s dissection of his evangelical childhood, when Christina Pontifex agitates herself about insufficient spiritual-mindedness, in The Way of All Flesh (begun in the 1870s but\n\n18\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\npublished in 1903) she worries about her past enjoyment of ‘forbidden’ black puddings.82 Evangelical Protestantism with its concern to avoid soul-imperilling sensual gratification might condemn a preoccupation with food after hunger was gratified. Although corpulence was associated with health for most of the nineteenth century, over-indulgence in food represented greed, one of the sins to be combated by evangelical parents. Diet must be seen as part of a regime in which ‘everything was restricted and controlled’. 83 One result of sabbatarian scruples was that Sunday meals were largely cold affairs; in Colin Spencer’s acclaimed history of British food puritanism is blamed more widely for culinary decline. But puritanical response to food was not the only attitude: there are too many contrasting references to enjoying eating.84 One writer who has referred to the ‘horrid little books for the instruction and intimidation of the young… against the sin of gluttony’ also asserts that the sternest Puritans of the early Victorian period ‘felt no sense of guilt in enjoying the pleasures of the table’.85 Moreover, a criticism of asceticism did not necessarily mean a belief that material comfort was enough. Richard Jefferies, for instance, stressed that ‘when the highest wages of the best paid artisan are reached it is not the greatest privilege of the man to throw mutton chops to dogs and piles of empty champagne bottles’.86 The lack of vegetables in the national diet was deplored by nonvegetarian food reformers who appreciated the nutritional value of vegetables, or who wished to see a wider consumption of meat through the wealthier consumers foregoing some of their meat for vegetables. Cookery writers and gourmets also deplored the British habit of overcooking their vegetables. 87 Tom Jerrold condemned the attitude of English cooks and their employers, that except as an accompaniment to meat, vegetables were ‘nasty foreign messes’.88 English culinary antipathy was attacked by other writers on food: Joseph Brown, a Sunderland doctor, condemned John Bull’s hostility towards garden stuffs; the writer of a tract promoting maize deplored the antipathy towards ‘foreigners, vegetable or human’. 89 Significantly, a late-Victorian edition of Mrs Beeton’s Cookery argued that the greatest boon of vegetarianism, its popularization of a wider range of vegetable dishes, brought ‘us more on a level with our Continental neighbours’.90 There were popular and expert prejudices. Vegetable soups were associated with Gallic culinary ingenuity attributed to the low quality of French ingredients or poverty. 91 Scientists revealed that vegetables required more effort to digest than animal foods and argued that in order to obtain an equivalent amount of nutrition large quantities would need to be consumed. Vegetables were associated with certain classes: thus onions\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nwere the staple of the poorest, whose strong and uneducated stomachs required their stimulus; turnips were avoided except in dire circumstances.92 Garlic was obviously foreign. Lentils and pulses, treated today as vegetarian staples, were difficult to get and associated with animal foods. Rice was not commonly used. 93 Fruits were associated with summer diarrhoea and imagined to be dangerous for children. Medical writers stressed the danger of parasites on raw vegetables.94 A major problem (obviously important for vegetarians) involved urban and rural availability. Production for urban markets meant that vegetables might not be cheaply available to the rural poor, so that, as the great chef Alexis Soyer noted, ‘excepting in large towns’ vegetables were scarce.95 But their price for city-dwellers was high, as one newspaper noted in 1875, the monstrous price of fresh vegetables rendered bacon and cabbage, ‘the humble fare of the country’, almost unattainable.96 Tinning of fruit and vegetables, which cheapened them, did not happen until the 1880s. Between 1815 and 1850, Britain was ‘a population existing permanently on the verge of starvation’.97 From the 1870s working-class diets improved, as a result of rising real incomes, cheap imported foodstuffs, and standardised and pre-packaged foods through multiple retailing, which helped reduced food adulteration. Railways made feasible the expansion of the trawling industry to supply urban consumers. Even agricultural labourers’ diets may have improved. No longer was bread the ‘staff of life’: Britain was in the vanguard of a dietetic revolution that saw the democratization of meat and protein in Europe.98 School textbooks of the late-Victorian era presented the pennyworth and ha’porths of meat as a sign of poverty which progress had abolished.99 Macaulay’s dream in 1848 that the twentieth-century artisan would ‘be as little used to dine without meat as they now are to eat rye bread’ was to be realized.100 Made possible by steam-trawling, railway transportation and ice preservation, fish and chip shops were well-established by the late nineteenth century. They were a significant contribution of protein for the working class and an addition to the ‘fast food’ that had always been sold by stalls and street vendors. The adulteration scandals had probably helped to educate people’s tastes towards milder flavoured, less vibrant foods, through the revelations of dangerous substances used to ‘sophisticate’. If adulteration was less widespread by the end of our period, there were new concerns about the use of chemical preservatives and flavourings. For the middle class, the movement was towards a more mixed and lighter diet, possibly influenced by vegetarianism.101 It also represented the trend towards self-control in feeding, which had already been the response of the aristocracy as food supplies became stable and plentiful in the modern era. 102 But if diet generally became more varied and improved in quality, the domestic\n\n20\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\ncookery that began to be taught in some cities ignored the pleasure of food. Victorian cuisine was also less sophisticated than it had been, because of the prestige of French cuisine and the disruption of culinary traditions through urbanization.103 Eating together, as a method of creating sociality, is a sociological truism. Food was publicly consumed in a variety of places, from hotels and public houses, to the restaurants that proliferated during the second half of the nineteenth century. Roast beef, white bait and turtle soup were dishes associated with public dinners for the humble (for beef was commonly given to the poor at feasts marking great occasions such as coronations) to the most exalted civic and government officials. The vegetarian was an intruder who sat at these events eating cold potatoes and, like the teetotaller he or she often was, imbibed water to the dismay of fellow guests. Those observing a vegetable diet had to choose between swallowing their scruples and eating meat in public, thus undermining the cause in the eyes of the more rigid, or consolidating their reputation for eccentricity. Verse in Punch which depicted the vegetarian’s Christmas fare was one expression of the pity or contempt directed at those who, through their dietetic heresy, seemed to be foregoing festive hospitality. It was not surprising, then, that the one vegetarian recipe which London adherents inserted in The Times, was for Christmas pudding! Vegetarians were encouraged to entertain their friends at parties to demonstrate the attractiveness of their new diet: the desire to show its reasonableness could lead to mimicry of meat dishes. What vegetarians actually ate is studied in chapter five, how they campaigned in order to alter the food of the majority is now considered.\n\n1 THE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, c.1838-1901\n\nThe immediate origins of the Victorian vegetarian movement lie in attempts by a few hundred pioneers to encourage the diet as part of their religious beliefs (as members of the Swedenborgian sect of Bible Christians or Cowherdites in Salford and Manchester), or as a result of their temperance beliefs, or compassion for animals, though to be sure, such motivations are not neatly divided. Here the movement’s history is provided, beginning with the nurturing of vegetarianism by another group of people in the 1830s, radical communitarians. This first part concludes with the establishment of the VS. The next section studies the movement’s development in the Society’s first two decades and examines key aspects of vegetarianism as an organized, propagandist and ‘lived’ (that is to say, embodied and enacted) movement, before its apparent eclipse in the 1860s. Aspects of its social base are brought out here and through a study of London vegetarians. The third section studies the movement’s revival from the 1870s through a brief examination of some key areas for activity across Britain, and again through a study of London, which became a centre for vegetarianism to rival its earlier heartlands in the north of England. Before the Vegetarian Society The followers of the failed merchant and theosopher James Pierrepont Greaves provided one highly significant source of vegetarian propaganda through their activity at a community founded in 1838 at Richmond in Surrey, known as the ‘Concordium’ or Alcott House. Greaves’ selfascribed label of ‘sacred socialism’ and the involvement by several Owenites in the community have led to a misinterpretation of the community as an Owenite one.1 For Greaves and many followers ignored contemporary politics and economics, believing individual moral\n\n22\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nreformation and the development of the ‘love-spirit’ (or divine spirit) was necessary before the social reform proposed by Robert Owen. Greaves was transformed by a spiritual experience in 1817, and as a disciple later advised, ‘you must think of him as an inspired man, or at least as a man who truly believed himself inspired’. 2 The New Moral World, reviewing Greaves’ posthumously published letters, spoke of his ‘peculiar philosophy … It was emphatically to live in a new world to hear him talk’.3 Despite his strange phraseology the emphasis on spiritual reformation before any meaningful ‘physical socialism’ is clear. His vegetarianism, from about 1817, was for mystical and moral reasons (he thought the physiological motives had been well-argued); humanitarian concerns joining fears of animalization and sexual stimulation. A celibate, his teachings included expressed anxiety about (as Jackie Latham expresses it) ‘a new kind of original sin’; engendered by unregulated marriage and intercourse without the ‘divine creative love-law’.4 Dietary reform would remove a sexual stimulant and separate man ‘from the animal world’.5 Greaves’ salon at 49 Burton Street, London, from about 1837, was open to all and he attracted radicals and literary figures to weekly meetings of his ‘Aesthetic Institution’. Of his disciples, the most important female follower was Sophia Chichester, a wealthy aristocrat who also gave covert financial support to several other theosophers and radical reformers, such as ‘Zion’ Ward and ‘Shepherd’ Smith. 6 In July 1838 Greaves and Chichester established ‘Alcott House’ school on Pestalozzian lines at Ham Common village, Surrey. A school existed throughout this period, with an average of thirty pupils (a few were day pupils) recruited from radical families and the neighbourhood. Promoted by followers before 1838, and central to the community, was vegetarianism. The prospectus which records the community’s reorganization in 1841 details the diet (oatmeal, porridge, bread, fruit and water), dress and timetable for work, meals, classes and recreation. The ‘Concordium’ consisted of ‘united individuals … desirous, under industrial and progressive education, with simplicity in diet, dress and lodging, etc., to retain the means for the harmonic developement [sic] of their physical, intellectual and moral natures.’7 Graham bread with raisins was baked on the premises, a garden was planted to promote self-sufficiency, and a shoemaker/tailor was recruited. The establishment was open to visitors, especially on Sundays when there were lectures; many hundreds may therefore have become acquainted with the community and its dietetic reforms. To disseminate their philosophy and recruit, a press was established. Tracts, motto ‘wafers’ for sealing letters, and two journals, The Healthian and The New Age, were published. These devoted much space to vegetarianism (a neologism it helped make current). Other physical-\n\nTHE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, C.1838-1901\n\n23\n\npuritanisms discussed included hydropathy (which the community pioneered from late 1841). The Concordium experiment was recorded in the New Age’s ‘Concordium Gazette’. The ‘progressive’ cause of phonetics was endorsed. Works by American transcendentalists were advertised and Graham’s physiology reviewed. America, already a place of physiological reform ideas and the location of the new moral world, was important for sacred socialists (and Owenites). The Concordists printed and promoted American texts in favour of vegetarianism such as William A. Alcott’s Vegetable Diet Defended and Sylvester Graham’s Lecture to Young Men on Chastity, and hoped to raise funds for a visit by Graham. The association of Greaves and his community with the infinitely more talented New England transcendentalists was serendipitous. 8 Greaves’ disciples hoped the educational reformer Bronson Alcott would visit, and run the eponymous school; when he came shortly after Greaves’ death, he was charmed by the community. Greaves had intended to establish a community in America; Alcott brought back three of the Concordists – Charles Lane, his son, and Henry Gardiner Wright – with him in September 1842. Wright found America uncongenial and returned, but Lane stayed with Alcott to establish a short-lived but famous community, Fruitlands, near Harvard. The disaster at Fruitlands did not, at least, shake Alcott’s faith in vegetarianism (he joined the British VS in 1850).9 Despite talk of withdrawal from ‘the external discordance and disagreement of actual society’, there were attempts to connect the diet with the peace movement and attract converts through tours in 1843. Three Concordists went out as missionaries to exhibit their ‘simplicity of living’ in tours of the Midlands, Hampshire and Sussex, and generated discussion by their manner, and costume of white trousers and checked shirt, sans necktie or hat. The New Age thought that the sympathetic response ‘augurs well for humanity’.10 The paper itself was an important means of propaganda but circulation was limited despite advertisements (in the New Moral World and J.E. Smith’s Family Herald). 11 An obvious group to cultivate was ‘advanced’ teetotallers. Whilst the Healthian mystified the Temperance Lancet in 1841 12 , some teetotallers’ sympathies were reflected in a teetotal excursion to the Concordium in July 1843.13 A teetotal reader of the New Age advised linking it as an ‘acceptable journal ... sowing good seed’, to the ‘nine million’ teetotallers and anticipated ‘high patronage’. The journal’s title was altered to The New Age, Concordium Gazette and Temperance Advocate after the sixth number.14 The Concordists also promoted physiological reform societies, beginning with a ‘Health, or Physiological Association’ whose secretary, G.J. Ford, was involved in vegetarianism into the 1860s.15 The Healthian\n\n24\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\napproved its simple, pledge-free rules and reported its intention to hold public and private meetings, print and circulate literature, and offer personal example on health and physiological law. The committee was open to members of either sex.16 Every Monday in October discussions on an ‘interesting topic’ took place at 11, Leathersellers’ Buildings, London Wall. On the 19th of October, a crowded assemblage for the departing Bronson Alcott included the pioneer vegetarian William Lambe who approved ‘the object and the means’. 17 The Association then disappeared from the Healthian which itself folded in February 1843. Another attempt to promote vegetarianism through organized propaganda and missions was launched in mid-October 1843 in the shape of a ‘British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and the Abstinence from Animal Foods,’ to disseminate ‘correct principles of universal peace, health of soul and body, and on the prolongation of human life’.18 The society was to have fourteen officers and members of both sexes. Chichester was made president, perhaps to secure funds from her after Greaves’ death. 19 The few members included a lady of ten years’ vegetarianism who had resisted meat when eight despite her servant’s pressure. One of the few reported meetings debated man’s relationship to the animal world.20 Internal power struggles followed Greaves’ death, with William Galpin, resident from summer 1843, exercising an increasingly bleak rule that repelled many. Recast as the ‘Universal Concordian Society’ the community eschewed animal materials, limited food, and avoided cookery. The Owenite Alexander Campbell, failing to win control, left in 1844, and undeterred, established a short-lived educational and vegetarian community at Hampton Wick. A ‘Fruit Festival’ in summer 1847 demonstrated the waning Greavesian ethos in discussing the ‘Social and Political Condition of Women’. A conference in early July 1847 was an unsuccessful attempt by William Oldham and Charles Lane to reinvigorate the community by associating it with efforts to promote vegetarianism. By 1848 the community had dissolved, the house became an orphanage for cholera-orphaned girls and the grounds became a strawberry garden.21 Although Spencer has described the Concordium as ‘well outside the perimeters of what society in general would have thought acceptable’, there were radicals who supported it. 22 Holyoake, for instance, distinguished between the mysticism that he deplored, and the physiological reform that he admired (he dabbled in vegetarianism). His account in the Cheltenham Free Press was notably appreciative of the health reforms: members looked healthy and appeared happy, the plain vegetable diet was contrasted with the ‘disease-engendering food of the epicure’ and the dress and beards were excused as symbols of independence: ‘We have\n\nTHE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, C.1838-1901\n\n25\n\na strange propensity to ridicule the slightest deviation from custom’s worn and hackneyed way, however harmless in itself that deviation may be.’23 Holyoake, who declined an invitation to teach at Alcott House, was dismayed and exasperated by the Concordist papers which he published in the journal The Movement (1844).24 But though critical of the perversions of Greavesian philosophy by disciples, his later journal, The Reasoner presented Greaves as the ‘great logician of personal reform’, who had originated the ‘personal reforms that are destined to extend their operations over the people’; dietary reform being the most important of those personal reforms that needed to precede public or political reform.25 The debate on vegetarianism involved several other leading reformers. An important contemporary, J.E. Smith, formerly a visitor to Greaves’ salon, devoted The Shepherd to sustained critical discussion of sacred socialism and vegetarianism in 1837. Smith possibly visited the Concordium: he is probably the ‘J.E.S.’ writing to the editor of the New Age pointing out vegetarian inconsistency in 1844.26 From May 1843 Smith edited the weekly Family Herald, a ‘family religious journal’ which in its heyday had a circulation of half a million. In its early years it published and replied to many inquiries on subjects which included Southcottianism, socialism, astrology, phrenology and vegetarianism. In 1843, responding to a letter from Oldham (hoping for publicity for the community), he maintained that a two-year experiment was insufficient and that diet remained a question of individual natures. Vegetarianism, kindred to celibacy and the common life, would be brought forward with the growing influence of ‘Puseyism’ upon an established church which alone made such discussions respectable. 27 In 1844-45, the Herald published an advertisement for New Age and texts associated with the community and Smith returned (not for the last time) to diet in an article on the sixteenthcentury Italian vegetarian Luigi Cornaro.28 Greavesian experimentation attracted the attention of even more distinguished figures. Alcott and Owen were the most important visitors, though (presumably by report) it was known to Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. The New Moral World published a letter from Engels referring to ‘Ham Common folks’: the community must be included in their attack on utopian socialism. 29 Carlyle’s relationship with Greaves, whom he characterized as a ‘blockhead’ and a ‘tail’ of Emerson in England, has been examined.30 Through Emerson, Alcott was received by Carlyle in 1843 and exasperated him with the ‘Potatoe-gospel’ [sic]. One of Alcott’s visits was witnessed by Robert Browning who ridiculed the diet, though he had been vegetarian in the 1830s through Shelley’s example.31 One disciple, Francis Barham, considered Greaves to be greater than Coleridge; Lane described him as a ‘colossus’. 32 Yet his posthumous\n\n26\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nreputation, beyond his followers, was slight. An essay in Westminster Review in 1852 described him as vegetarianism’s modern apostle and identified the poet Henry Septimus Sutton, author of Evangel of Love, as a successor.33 These references apart, Greaves and the community were unknown beyond the small world of (transatlantic) utopian and radical reformers. Hundreds may have boarded with or visited the community, but this generated no public fame. The radical Douglas Jerrold’s Newspaper, reviewing Lane’s vegetarian tract of 1847, demonstrated its previous ignorance of the community. 34 The one satire on Alcott House which might have reached a larger audience, in a novel by Mary Kelty published in 1851, has been entirely ignored. 35 Yet the Concordium’s reputation for ascetic fanaticism was preserved by the memoirs of the radicals Thomas Frost, Holyoake and William Linton.36 Late-Victorian and Edwardian vegetarians, interested in tracing lineages, examined the Concordium and drew on the memories of the few surviving participants.37 The efforts of the Concordists had some resonance with other reformers. Pure diet, good health and physiology in dress were components of the ‘community movement’ central to Owenism.38 Highthinking and plain-living Owenites saw temperance as a virtue and could naturally investigate vegetarianism, especially when the New Moral World which catered to Owenite artisans and advanced liberals discussed the diet. 39 Vegetarianism was promoted by native Owenites and by nonBritish communities reported by the Owenite organ, such as the community planned in Ohio which intended to ‘wholly exclude the animal kingdom’ for humanitarian, physiological and timesaving reasons (the time thus released for mental culture).40 The organ of William Hodson’s breakaway Owenite community at Manea Fen published an account of Alcott House school by John Firmin which supported the diet for socialist children but questioned its suitability for adults. With ‘the assistance of a light trade, well directed and well governed’ it would make children wholly or practically self-supporting. The savings would go to community funds, ‘toil and disagreement’ in food preparation would be abolished and time could be spent in more rational and useful activity.41 The frequency of the discussion explains why, when the projected Norwood Co-operative Industrial Association advertised in late 1843, it eschewed all ‘sectarianism’, including the ‘edible’.42 But the relationship of vegetarianism to Owenism was ambivalent. At the Owenite community of Harmony Hall, vegetarianism was adopted to address financial and organizational deficiencies and partly espoused on principle (indeed one youthful convert, Alfred Slatter, continued to advocate it as a means to social reform into the 1870s). Not all the members relished the diet, although Alexander Somerville said half of the\n\nTHE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, C.1838-1901\n\n27\n\ncommunity were vegetarian.43 One of the governors of the community, James Rigby, was a life-long vegetarian44; his successor John Finch was a teetotaller whose testimony before a Commons committee, that in the rational state of society ‘all those who will eat beef, mutton, veal, and pork, must in turn kill the animals for themselves,’ suggests his vegetarian sympathies.45 Finch’s second governorship inaugurated a spartan regime, with a committee formed to create a ‘cheap and rational diet’ but a lack of consensus led to separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian tables, the former containing the merriest diners according to Holyoake.46 The Owenite relationship with the Concordium was equally ambivalent. Metropolitan Owenites treated it as a radical country resort; the ‘attractive yet convenient position ... made it a good goal for visitors from London, particularly if they could avoid the food’.47 Owen visited thrice, in the summer of 1840, with Lambeth Owenites, in spring and August 1843.48 A rural excursion, during which socialist forms of government were debated, was reported in August 1841. 49 Another Owenite group visited in that year.50 Charles Lane, so important in the Greavesian community, had had an early interest in Owen, attending the first public exposition of his ideas in London, in 1818. 51 A more committed Owenite was Alexander Campbell, one of the Owenite ‘social missionaries’, who was converted by Greaves and joined the community in 1842, but remained an Owenite propagandist. After Greaves’ death he edited some of his letters for publication by the community. The New Age reported Owenite congresses and activity at Harmony, but criticized Owenite ‘sectarianism’, and condemned the use of hired and animal labour at Harmony. Concordists hoped for support from the New Moral World, social missionaries and tracts in the preparation of ‘all’ for the abandonment of meat, ‘injurious and superfluous luxuries’. 52 Some Concordists, for example Wright, lectured to metropolitan Rational Society branches. Wright twice lectured on the ‘advantages of a vegetable diet’ at Goswell Street Road, Branch 16 of the Rational Society, and gave a well-attended lecture on ‘Fruit Diet’ to the Lambeth branch which ‘gave great satisfaction’ according to its secretary John Firmin.53 In 1840 a Mr Body of A1 Branch had presented Harmony with the book Vegetable Cookery, and four years later Campbell gave a lecture on Concordist principles and practice to the same branch.54 The appeal of mysticism, shared millenarianism and the desire for paternal leadership explain the migration of some of the collapsing Harmony Hall’s disillusioned inhabitants to the Concordium. 55 William Galpin, vice-president of the Rational Society, obeying Owen’s call for him to leave Harmony, found refuge there, with disastrous consequences. Hannah Bond, who had taught children at Harmony, joined after its collapse. Samuel Bower of Bradford (who went with Lane, Wright and\n\n28\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nAlcott to America) also joined. For some (like the widow of the prominent radical Richard Carlile, Eliza Sharples), residency was simply an alternative to destitution.56 As the wider Owenite movement dissolved in the mid1840s into a variety of institutions promoting education, self-help, or secularism, for a few it became identified with a ‘new eccentric world where individual self-expression signified the beginning of the supercession of irrational social prejudices’.57 In this context vegetarianism was viewed by critical socialists as a characteristic of less sane, or ‘dissident’ followers. Socialism now harboured ‘moral and intellectual delinquents – empty-headed young men bordering on idiocy, babblers and quibblers, long-haired, bearded and vegetarians, etc.’58 Similar ambivalence can be found in the Chartist movement. The Chartist utopia involved a transformation in diet. For, as the Northern Star, the movement’s leading newspaper observed, those who reared the cattle did not taste flesh food. 59 The paper reported the projected vegetarian conference in July 1847, but printed comments against dietetic totalism.60 Earlier it had favourably reviewed the New Age and described the Concordists as an ‘interesting body of Social reformers, who seem to realize practically (so far as possible) what god-like Shelley only dreamed of in his Queen Mab’.61 A fair review of the Healthian characterized the diet advocated by Concordists and a ‘large number of isolated individuals’ as ‘whole-hog teetotalism and no Mistake!’ 62 Yet vegetarianism attracted some Chartists: and perhaps vegetarianism may be classed as one of the sectional successors to Chartism. 63 The most well-known examples are Charles Neesom and, at least to the extent of writing a vegetarian essay, Robert Gammage. 64 Charles Kingsley’s character John Crossthwaite, in Alton Locke (1850), was an idealistic Chartist and vegetarian, ‘to which perhaps, he owed a great deal of the almost preternatural clearness, volubility, and sensitiveness of his mind’.65 Other Chartists of course, were vegetarian because of their poverty, such as John Bezer, whose published autobiography included the apology to any vegetarian readers for his backsliding from ‘vegetable marrow’.66 The influence of vegetarian believers reached beyond the mainstream to more fringe movements. For example, Concordists published tracts by John Etzler, leader of the ‘Tropical Emigration Society’.67 Etzler, his wife and a disciple, C.F. Stollmeyer, briefly resided at the Concordium, where Etzler delivered a course of public lectures in 1843-44. 68 A materialist, Etzler at least came to share the faith in vegetarianism, claiming that the man of ‘science and reality’ could see no need to butcher animals for food and use, or quarrel and rob fellow man for a living: ‘there is an endless variety of vegetable foods much pleasanter in taste, sight, smell and much more wholesome, than carcasses of animals’.69 The Etzlerite ‘Co-operative\n\nTHE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, C.1838-1901\n\n29\n\nEmigration Society’ endorsed vegetarianism in 1844. Members decided following ‘long and earnest enquiry’ to restrict themselves to a vegetable diet (excepting milk, butter, eggs and other products not requiring killing) for economic, social and moral reasons. The principle was so important that they urged it upon the attention of ‘all advanced reformers’ and made a ‘public declaration of their views on morals, diet, practical measures &c’.70 Etzler’s pro-vegetarian statements appeared in the Etzlerite organ Morning Star which was founded and initially edited by a youthful enthusiast and vegetarian propagandist, James Elmzlie Duncan, connected to the Concordium. 71 Duncan’s mediocre literary output included a chapter of an unfinished novel entitled ‘Edward Noble, or the Utopian’ which featured Greaves and a vegetarian essay which referred to Shelley and the ‘Healthian diet’ of ‘the London Vegetarians’. 72 He advertised a Guide to Health and Longevity in the New Moral World, and in 1848 announced an expanded serialization of his ‘romance of progression’ whose heroes included Greaves, Owen, Etzler, the Unitarian W.J. Fox, the temperance figure Father Mathew, and Richard Cobden. Duncan’s continued interest in physical puritanism is shown by his subscription to William Horsell’s The Truth-Tester and Vegetarian Advocate. Horsell published Duncan’s final journal in 1849.73 Another communitarian experiment which incorporated a school and food reform was promoted by the Barmbys (1843-44). 74 A pioneer communist, John Goodwyn Barmby was influenced by Greaves, the Concordium and White Quakerism. One of the ‘societarian wants’ he listed in The Promethean in 1842 was ‘medicinally prepared diet’; the tenth was common or contemporaneous consumption of food. 75 In 1843 he and his wife Catherine (an Owenite feminist) established ‘Moreville Communitorium’ at Hanwell, Middlesex. His costume and hairstyle at Hanwell were modelled on the Concordists’.76 His dietary rules (reprinted by the New Age) partially promoted vegetarianism.77 A follower of Barmby and Greaves, Henry Fry of Cheltenham, endorsed vegetarianism in his Educational Circular and Communist Apostle. 78 An attack on the Barmbys’ small Communist Church sect (c.1842-49) in the News of the World (1846), treated dietary radicalism as part of the creed.79 The high ideals of such communities are apparent in yet another, established by William Galpin at Little Bentley on the Tytherley estate in 1845, with Isaac Ironside of Sheffield (a visitor to the Concordium). 80 Members of the Rational Society were informed by them ‘that man has a nobler destiny than that of being a mere eating and drinking animal, or one that receives his highest gratifications from sensual objects’.81 They hoped that members of the Harmony community would find refuge from the ‘old world’ here. Members were to abandon worldly ties and\n\n30\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nconnections, ‘That God may be all in all.’ Galpin’s ‘divine message’, to gather a nucleus of the Universal Church before Christ’s second coming, was dutifully, if scornfully printed in the Reasoner. 82 Holyoake rightly identified the ultra-puritanism promoted there as influenced by White Quakerism.83 A newspaper reporter, although spicing his account, wrote that members equalled ‘the most ascetic cynic of old’ in their self-denial.84 It proved too much for many members including Ironside, who felt that Little Bentley involved ‘absurd and repulsive austerities – ridiculous and repugnant fanaticism, little short of insanity’.85 The contentious White Quaker community, established by the schismatic Quakers Joshua Jacob and Abigail Beale, became another location for ultra-asceticism and vegetarianism. Though they rejected Greavesian celibacy, they practised community in goods, wore undyed linen clothing, and the men grew beards and long hair. They were visited separately by reformers such as Barmby, Campbell, Ironside and Owen, and attracted other radicals. 86 Ironside collected sympathizers from Manchester’s branch of the Rational Society, some of whom joined the sect. 87 After Little Bentley’s collapse, Galpin joined, with marriage to Joshua’s sister Mary cementing his ‘Jacobism’.88 Given the sect’s aim to return to primitive values they espoused simplicity in diet: at one community house in a former hotel in Dublin, ‘some twenty or more’ practised vegetarianism. 89 Probably due to Galpin, the community committed itself firmly to vegetarianism. In summer 1847 a visitor saw the dining table at the sect’s new home, Newlands, piled with wheaten bread, butter, cheeses and dried fruits. When the English reformer Joseph Barker visited the sect in 1850 the diet was rigidly vegetarian, with bread and potatoes made available to impoverished visitors. A bleak account in the Family Herald reported the sect’s decline, the correspondent suggesting that Jacob ate secretly since he was thriving despite the diet of ‘half boiled green cabbage, raw corn, and water’.90 Vegetarianism as a result of such experimentation was a familiar topic in journals associated with Owenism and ‘infidelity’, and came to be supported by a number of Chartists. Communitarianism continued to have associations with vegetarianism but from 1847 vegetarians had the wider community of an organized movement for support. Establishing the Vegetarian Society By the late 1840s, vegetarians sought a national association. The VS was founded by remnants of the Concordium, a few advanced teetotallers and the vegetarian Cowherdite sect. Its establishment owed much to the Cowherdite James Simpson, who became the first president. Also among the prime movers was the temperance reformer William Horsell who had\n\nTHE VEGETARIAN MOVEMENT, C.1838-1901\n\n31\n\nbecome vegetarian in 1846 in the process of writing a populist health manual. His journal, The Truth-Tester, presented vegetarianism as ‘the next practical moral subject which is likely to call forth the virtuous energy of society’ and published dialogues, maxims, verse and letters in support of the diet. In April 1847 Horsell printed a letter from a young teetotaller called William Bramwell Withers, of Whitehurst in Hampshire, calling for such a society. Vegetarians met in Alcott House on 8 July to discuss the project. A further meeting on 30 September, at Northwood Villa in Ramsgate, the hydropathic infirmary managed by Horsell and his wife, formally established the VS.91 The rules had already been drawn up by James Simpson, who had corresponded with Horsell to reassure him that his advocacy was worthwhile and that many readers would support him.92 The Cowherdites also sent their endorsement to William Oldham. 93 The Concordist contribution included advertisements for Alcott House, a letter by Hannah Bond, and essays by Charles Lane. Members of Alcott House wanted to be involved in the project, and Oldham invited interested parties to a ‘physiological conference’ (8 July 1847) to publicly initiate preparations.94 The meeting attracted some fifty vegetarians including James Simpson, Joseph Gunn Palmer (a Birmingham Quaker who acted as chairman), and Horsell. Bond’s dishes united ‘the innocence of the hermit’s repast with the refinements of art, and the labours of domestic experiences’.95 In the afternoon the group, which had increased to one hundred and thirty vegetarians and others, congregated in the shade of a large tree in the ‘beautiful and productive garden’. Lectures followed, with Horsell chairing one at Ramsgate Primitive Methodist chapel. He published an address by Simpson and, several weeks before the date arranged, printed a verse ‘Invitation to the Physiological Festival’ by Fanny Lacy, an aristocrat associated with Barmby and the Concordium.96 The establishment of the VS involved the support of a well-known figure, the Cowherdite Joseph Brotherton MP, who presided at the inaugural meeting which included fellow Cowherdites such as James Scholefield and James Gaskill.97 Simpson was elected the VS’s president, Horsell was appointed secretary (a post he held for three years) and William Oldham became treasurer (for a year). One hundred and fifty members were immediately enrolled; in 1848 the VS comprised 265 members spanning the ages 14 to 76, with Cowherdite families providing almost half of the members.98 Although the Cowherdite element to the early movement is a well-known one which need not be examined here, an analysis of the role of one of its members, James Simpson, is crucial to an understanding of the VS from 1847 to 1859.99 Simpson provided it with the necessary financial support for its public activities, and leadership.\n\n32\n\nOF VICTORIANS AND VEGETARIANS\n\nHorsell later acknowledged that the establishment of the society was ‘principally under his own generous and judicious guidance’.100 Given the low profile of vegetarianism in Victorian historiography, it is unsurprising that Simpson has a minor profile as a reformer.101 Yet he was one of those leading provincial citizens so important for reform movements and provincial politics.\n\nFIGURE 2.
