Children:-\n\n(1) Joseph Derby (1616? - Aft 1669? ) Educated at Magdalen Hall Oxford where he matriculated on 29th March 1639 aged 17; May have gone on to Inner Temple 1648; he married Joane COOKE at Thorncombe in Dorset on 1st January 1651/2 and raised a family of six children. He was elected town clerk of Dorchester on 12th Dec 1656. On the 10th May 1660 Charles II was proclaimed at Dorchester and the Mayor John Daniell made a short speech. He was followed by Joseph Derby still Town Clerk. David Underdown in his book about Dorchester 'Fire from Heaven' on page 231 states \" He looked back over the 'world of confusions' from which they had just escaped, the strange and ...unheard of government's that had wasted our treasure and much precious blood in the nation'. He then proclaimed Charles II, adding a prayer that his throne might be 'established in righteousness'. There were loud cheers, and the gathering dispersed. Joseph appears to have been alive in 1669 as a conveyance survives at the National Archives (DD/X/WA/22) regarding his part interest in a copyhold tenement in Brockhampton in the parish of Buckland Abbas [now known as Buckland Newton] Dorset called Bewley Wood where his father William Derby with others had purchased the \"fee simple\" which presumably descended to him on the death of his father in 1649.\n\n(2) Mary Derby (1617 - 1618) baptised at Holy Trinity church Dorchester on 30th Dec 1617 and buried there on 24th April 1618\n\n(3) Elizabeth Derby (1620 - ? ) baptised at Holy Trinity Church on 28th June 1620\n\n(4) Mary Derby (c1622? - ?) according to the 1634 Visitation of Hampshire she married John WHITE (1615-1659/60) the son of Rev. Josias White BD (c.1573 - 1622/3) the brother of Rev John WHITE (1575-1648) . On pages 391/392 of The Rev White's Biography by Rose Troup she states that \" John WHITE, second son of Josias, a \"merchant adventurer\" in Dorchester, married before 1634, Mary, daughter of William DERBY, and removed to London. I have already speculated that Mary's marriage may in fact have been after 1634 as I think Rose Troup, not unreasonably, relied on the date of the Visitation. Regarding her husband Rose Troup refers to \"He brought an action against Robert and John Whetcombe, the former having been a member of the Dorchester Company, for goods supplied while he was a merchant adventurer in Dorchester \". I have not located this case but it presumably confirms that they now live in London.\n\nMarriages Beaminster Dorset Ancestry.com images 435 of 778 01 Aug 1619 MARRIAGE in the Parish Church at Charminster Dorset :\"Anno Domini 1619 : i [1st] of August was married Willm COLLIS of Dorchester in [the] pish [parish] of All Saints & Christian SHERWING his wife [Note:- Other marriages in this parish have the surname spelt differently as [SHERWIN and SHERING] - There is a Will for a Thomas SHERRING of Charminster dated 1660 PROB 11:303] Marriages Charminster Dorset Ancestry.com image 44 of 129 16 Jan 1620 MARRIAGE in the Parish Church at Charminster Dorset :\"Anno Domini 1620 : The 16 of Januarie was Married John BLICKE and Julian LOOIES?

First it marks the official end of the devastating Civil War in Britain which lasted from 1642 to 1651. With many Soldiers settling down or returning home to raise families 1650/1651 saw many marriages of which Adam SMITH's was perhaps typical. Secondly the most likely place they would have married was St Peters in Dorchester where the parish registers were all destroyed during the war, as were those for All Saints church further down High East Street. All we know for sure is that they did not marry in his parish of Holy Trinity (which lies only 4 buildings away from St Peters) on High West Street or St Georges Church in nearby Fordington where records still survive.\n\nAdam SMITH (bur.1708) & Elizabeth SMITH nee Unknown (bur.1701) What we do know is that they raised a family of 5 children on Dorchester's High West Street as listed below. We also know that Elizabeth recorded in the burial register as the wife of Adam SMITH was buried at Holy Trinity Church on 2nd Oct 1701 followed by Adam on 17th Oct 1708. :-\n\n(1) John SMITH (1652- ?) baptised at Holy Trinity Church on 11th Aug 1652, he later married Elizabeth LINDSFIELD at Winterborne St Martin in Dorset on 24th June 1685.

Seems quite likely as just over 4 miles away; the average age for marriage at this time was about 26 which given her baptism in Nov 1663 is right on the average; There are no baptisms in Upwey for anybody with the surname Bartlett prior to 1727.

His actual baptism record states \"Anno Domini 1653: John the sonne of Henry GLOVER Minister of Winford Eagle baptized April 6th \".The small church of St Lawrence at Wynford Eagle was at that date a chapelry of St Basils Church at Toller Fratrum and his father would probably then have been a curate as he went on to become Rector of Iwerne Courtney (alias Shroton) on 30th Aug 1660.\n\nAs an aside there is a nice entry in the Iwerne Courtney Parish Register (image 40 of 183 on Ancestry.com) recording Henry's induction to the church. This is actually quite useful as offical church records about him have generally not survived. He has also signed the parish register at the foot of each page until his own death is recorded there (image 42 of 183) on September 11th 1668 and burial at Toller Fratrum the following day.\n\nAlso there is an entry in the Municiple Records of Dorchester (page 607) which States \" 1656, Apr 18 \"It is ordered that there bee a Conference held with Mr. Glover, of Wynford, either by Mr. Savage or Mr. Whiteway or both of them, concerning his coming hither to bee a Lecturer, whether or no hee will be perswaded to remove to this Towne for 80li, per ann. and a house, or 9[0]/. and a house rather than fayle {fail}.\"\n\nJohn GLOVER married about 1675 to a Susanna, but I have not been able to locate their marriage. They settled in St Peters Parish Dorchester where John Glover worked as an Attorney at law. His name also appears among the list of over 300 people in Dorchester who signed the Corporation's address to King Charles II dated 31st August 1681. They later moved to Holy Trinity Parish which had the same rector. John GLOVER died intestate being buried at Holy Trinity Church on 7th May 1711 with administration of his estate being passed to Lucy their daughter on 21st July 1711. His widow Susanna Glover was also buried at Holy Trinity, on 25th Oct 1716. Known Children:-\n\n(1) Lucy Glover (1675-1713) bap at St Peters Church Dorchester 10th Mar 1675/6 (Note:- Surname wrongly entered in the parish register as Gloser). When her father died her mother renounced administration of his estate passing it to Lucy as their eldest daughter. She was later buried at Holy Trinity Church in Dorchester on 25th Sep 1713.\n\n(2) Susanna Glover (1677- ? ) (probably a twin with Margaret below) bap with Margaret at St Peters Church Dorchester 4th Dec 1677. No further trace, but there is another burial for a Margaret Glover buried at Upway on 24th March 1705 (Link to entry below).
