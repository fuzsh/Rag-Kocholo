This book provides an overview of the origins and meanings of over 2,000 place names in Atlantic Canada. It traces how names were given by early Norse, Indigenous, and Inuit settlers, and later European settlers from France, Britain, Portugal, and elsewhere. The names reveal insights into the region's history and cultures over the past millennium. The book examines names by province based on their historical significance, importance as population centers, or names that provoke questions about their origins. It is the first volume to take a comprehensive regional approach to place names in Atlantic Canada.",
