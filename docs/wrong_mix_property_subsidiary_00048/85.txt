New Routers, Gigabit Ethernet Switch Broaden Solution for Medium-size Enterprises

HILLSBORO, Ore., Sept. 7, 1999 - Intel Corporation today announced the Intel 6000 Series Switch and the Intel Express 9500 and 8200 routers, new products that significantly expanded Intel's network systems offerings. With the addition of these products, Intel has broadened its network systems offering to provide medium-size enterprise customers with more flexible and manageable end-to-end networking solutions.

"The incredible growth of the Internet has fueled the need for more robust access and infrastructure solutions," said John Miner, vice president, Intel Communications Products Group. "Network systems products, including those we're announcing today, are a strategic part of Intel's plan to deliver integrated communications solutions to medium-size enterprises and Internet Service Providers. Networking has become one of Intel's fastest-growing and most successful businesses, one that we will continue to grow through internal development, acquisitions, investments and alliances."

Intel has expanded its network systems portfolio with a variety of acquisitions, including ShivaÂ™ and XLNT earlier this year. The Shiva acquisition enabled Intel to rapidly expand its networking product line to include integrated remote access solutions based on Shiva's direct dial and virtual private networking (VPN) products for the medium-size enterprise market segment. With the XLNT acquisition, Intel gained a technology design center that has enabled it to deliver high-bandwidth, chassis-based switching products for medium-size enterprises.

Combining these acquisitions with internal product development, Intel now offers a full complement of networking systems products for medium-size enterprises. According to Cahners In-Stat Group, the middle market, which accounts for roughly 14% of U.S. employment, represents a substantial revenue growth opportunity for I.T. vendors, as middle market firms are attempting to close the technology gap between themselves and their enterprise competitors.*

High-speed Intel 6000 Series Switch Helps Improve Network Performance

The Intel 6000 Series Switch is a high-performance, modular Gigabit Ethernet switching solution that enables network administrators to aggregate workgroups and servers on their Local Area Networks (LANs). An aggregation switch acts as the intelligent "traffic director" of the network, routing data to and from the central "intersection" where all the segments of the LAN meet.

The Intel 6000 Series Switch is based on a modular form factor design to fulfill the needs of organizations that put a high value on network uptime. Organizations with limited space in the data center can benefit from the switch's high-density 32 Gigabit Ethernet or 96 Fast Ethernet ports in a compact, 10.5" five-slot chassis. Redundant and hot-swappable components make the Intel 6000 Series Switch a highly-reliable system and the switch's high Layer 3 forwarding rate helps ensure that the network backbone won't be a bottleneck.

In 2000, Intel plans to add intelligent networking capabilities to the Intel 6000 Series Switch to support customers' evolving networks. Intelligent networking is the ability of the switch to analyze and forward network data packets based on their contents, enabling the switch to more efficiently manage network congestion through bandwidth reservation, server load balancing and dynamic data filtering.

New Intel Express Routers Help Easily Connect Branch Offices and Regional Sites The Intel Express 9500 and 8200 router families help network administrators connect branch offices and regional sites to each other and to central sites. These new routers, which complement the existing Intel Express 8100 router family, are available in multiple configurations depending on the specific needs of the user.

Available immediately, the Intel Express 9510 and 9520 routers support a broad range of Wide Area Network (WAN) protocols and feature hardware-based compression at speeds up to 2 Mbps on WAN ports to help maximize data throughput on the WAN links and reduce costs. The routers are also flexible, designed to help customers migrate to faster WAN services as their bandwidth needs grow, without sacrificing their original networking investment.

The Intel Express 9500 and 8200 routers automatically default to a backup connection should a user's primary connection fail, maintaining constant, uninterrupted communication. For T1/E1 users, versions of the Intel Express 9500 and 8200 are available with an integrated CSU/DSU with advanced diagnostics capabilities that eliminate the need to purchase and configure an external CSU/DSU.

Intel Device View Helps Simplify Network Control

Intel Device View software - included with the Intel 6000 Series Switch, the Intel Express 9500 and 8200 routers, and other manageable Intel Express networking products - help provide control and greater ease of installation through a single user-friendly interface. The intuitive Windows*- and Web-based tools help network administrators configure and control their network infrastructure. Intel Device View updates, which include support for the products announced today, are available to download free of charge from Intel's website at www.intel.com/network/.

Pricing and Availability

The Intel 6000 Series Switch Chassis and 8-port Gigabit SX Module will be available Sept. 28 and are priced at $13,995 and $18,995 respectively. Additional Intel 6000 Series Switch modules and software enhancements are planned for introduction in the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first half of 2000. Customers can purchase telephone support, parts replacement and warranty packages for ongoing support, including an Installation Service Pack for the Intel 6000 Series Switch that provides on-site installation and two incidents of phone support, for $2,999 (U.S. suggested list).

The Intel Express 9510 and 9520 routers are available immediately and are priced at $1449 and $1749, respectively. The Intel Express 8200 family, as well as additional members of the Intel Express 9500 family, are planned to be available by the end of the year.

All Intel networking products are available worldwide through a network of distributors and value-added resellers. Additional product information is available at (800) 538-3373 for U.S. and Canadian customers; at (44) 1-793-431-155 for European customers; or at (503) 264-7354 for other international customers.
