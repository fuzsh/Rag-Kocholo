        "text": "In 1978, a 14-year-old named V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai developed a computer program, which replicated the features of the interoffice, inter-organizational paper mail system. He named his program âEMAILâ. Shiva filed an application for copyright in his program and in 1982 the United States Copyright Office issued a Certificate of Registration, No. TXu-111-775, to him on the program.\n\nAs required by the Regulations of the Copyright Office, he deposited portions of the original source code with the program. Prominent in the code is the name âEMAILâ that he gave to the program. He received a second Certificate of Registration, No. TXu-108-715, for the âEMAIL Userâs Manualâ he had prepared to accompany the program and that taught unsophisticated userâs how to use EMAILâs features.\n\nRecently however, a substantial controversy has arisen as to who invented email. This controversy has resulted in an unfortunate series of attacks on Shiva. Part of the problem is that different people use to the term to mean somewhat different things.\n\nThe Man Who Invented Email™\n\nShiva envisioned something simpler, something that everyone, from secretary to CEO, could use to quickly and reliably send and receive digital messages. Shiva embraced the project and began by performing a thorough evaluation of UMDNJ's paper-based mail system, the same as that used in offices and organizations around the world.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology highlighted his invention as one among four, in the incoming Freshman class of 1,040 students. His papers, documenting the invention of email were accepted by Smithsonian Institution. These are facts based on legal, governmental and institutional recognition and substantiation, and there is no disputing it.\n\nMisconceptions About Email\n\nStandard histories of the Internet, however, are full of claims that certain individuals (and teams) in the ARPAnet environment and other large companies in the 1970s and 1980s “invented email.”\n\nThe original text message, electronic transfer of content or images, ARPANET messaging, and even the “@” sign were used in primitive electronic communication systems. While the technology pioneers who created these systems should be heralded for their efforts, and given credit for their specific accomplishments and contributions, these early computer programs were clearly not email.\n\nThe Unfortunate Reaction to the Invention of Email\n\nThey enlisted âhistoriansâ who started discussions among themselves to redefine the term âemailâ so as to credit their own work done prior to 1978, as âemailâ. More blatantly, they registered the InternetHallofFame.Org web site, seven (7) days after the Smithsonian news and issued a new award to one of their own as âinventor of emailâ. Through the PR machine of BBN (a multi-billion dollar company), they were proclaimed as the âking of emailâ, and âgodfather of emailâ. These actions were taken to protect their false branding and diminish the accolades and just recognition Shiva was beginning to receive. Shivaâs news likely threatens BBNâs entire brand, which has deliberately juxtaposed âinnovationâ, with the â@â logo, along with the face of their mascot, the self-proclaimed âinventor of emailâ. They have removed damaging references to eminent Internet pioneers of the time such as MA Padlipsky who exposed their lies, and showed that BBNâs mascot, was not the âinventor of emailâ.\n\nSome industry insiders have even gone to the extent, in the midst of the overwhelming facts, to now attempt to confuse the public that \"EMAIL\" is not \"email\". It is a fact that the term \"email\", the juxtaposition of those five characters \"e\", \"m\", \"a\", \"i\" and \"l\", did not exist prior to 1978. The naming of the software program EMAIL in all capitals was because at UMDNJ, the names of software programs, subroutines and variables written in FORTRAN IV used the upper-case naming convention. Moreover, at that time, the use of upper case for the naming of programs, subroutine and variable names, was also a carry over from the days of writing software programs using punch cards. The fact is EMAIL is email, upper case, lower case, any case.\n\nA Time for Reflection\n\nSadly, some of these individuals have even gone further, deciding that false allegations are insufficient to make their case and have resorted to character assassination of the most debased nature including removal and destruction of facts on Wikipedia to discredit Shiva as an inventor of any kind. Threatening and racist emails telling him “to hang himself by his dhothi”, blogs referring to him as a “flagrant fraud”, and comments that EMAIL was “not an invention” are beyond disbelief, and reflect a parochial attitude that innovation can only take place in large universities, big companies, and the military.\n\nAs MIT's Institute Professor Noam Chomsky reflected: “The efforts to belittle the innovation of a 14-year-old child should lead to reflection on the larger story of how power is gained, maintained, and expanded, and the need to encourage, not undermine, the capacities for creative inquiry that are widely shared and could flourish, if recognized and given the support they deserve.“\n\nOf course a claim such as “I invented email” will leave anyone open to criticism and doubt, and as some suggest “hatred”. In this case, the victim has not made a “claim”, but rather been recognized by the government and top educational institutions in the world as an inventor. Regardless of the vitriol, animosity and bigotry by a vocal minority, a simple truth stands: email was invented by a 14-year-old working in Newark, NJ in 1978.\n\nThis is a fact. Innovation can occur, any place, any time, by anybody.\n\nBeyond the invention of email in 1978, Dr. V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, who holds four degrees from MIT, is a Fullbright Scholar, MIT-Lemelson Awards Finalist and Westinghouse Science Talent Search Honors Award recipient, has continued his work as both an inventor and systems scientist across a broad range of fields from media to medicine, art and technology. After inventing email, he went on to create Arts Online - the first internet portal for artists, in 1993. After winning a competition categorizing email for the White House, he started EchoMail, a company that provided Global 2000 companies an enterprise platform for email and social media management. His deep interest in medicine and biology led him to create CytoSolve in 2007, a company dedicated to revolutionizing drug development through in-silico modelling.\n\nHis dedication as an educator at MIT and to the general public led him to create Systems Visualization, a new course he pioneered at MIT, which has now become one of the most popular institute-wide interdisciplinary courses. To educate medical doctors, healthcare and holistic practitioners on the bridge between eastern and western medicice, he created Systems Health™, a revolutionary education program that serves as a gateway for integrative medicine. Dr. VA Shiva, to share his love of systems, developed vashiva.com to serve as an educational source for the general public to learn how systems are the basis of understanding their bodies, their business, and the world around them.\n\nTo support innovation among youth, he started Innovation Corps, a project of his center - International Center for Integrative Systems. In his birthplace in India, he deployed Tamilnadu.com, a portal dedicated to organizing content featuring the arts and culture of the state of Tamil Nadu. More than anything else, as the Inventor of Email, his achievements provide an inspiring message to youth across the world - be it in inner cities or villages."
