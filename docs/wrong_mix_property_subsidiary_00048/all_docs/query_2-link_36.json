        "text": "Can Shiva Grant Moksha?\n\nIn the Mahabharata Anushasana Parva there is a discourse on Yoga by Shiva:-\n\nAt the end he says;\n\nhttps://sa.wikisource.org/s/3bh\n\nमहेश्वर उवाच।\n\nसायुज्यानां विशिष्टं च मामकं वैष्णवं तथा।\n\nमां प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते विष्णु वा शुभलोचने।।\n\nOne attains me (Shiva) or Vishnu and never returns to samsara.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, Ashvamedha parvan, there is a dialogue between Krishna and Yudhishthira on the ‘vaishnava dharma shāstra’:\n\nhttps://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mbhK/unic/mbhK14_sa.html\n\nप्रविशेत्स महातेजा मां वा शङ्करमेव वा | न स्यात्पुनर्भवो राजन्नात्र कार्या विचारणा ||१४-१०३-११७ (९५९६८)\n\nThe person who performs severe austerities, vrata-s, stated herein, and gives himself up in devotion to My (Vishnu’s) form or to the form of Rudra-Dakshināmūrti attains to Me (Krishna) or Shiva and never returns to samsara. There is no doubt at all in this.\n\nThus we have both Hari and Hara making the same statement: - Attaining to either of them Leads to Moksha.\n\nThe Scriptures also mention devotees who worshipped Shiva and Got liberated.\n\nस्तुत्वैवं शंकुकर्णोऽपि भगवंतं कपर्दिनम् । पपात दंडवद्भूमौ प्रोच्चरन्प्रणवं परम् ४५।\n\nतत्क्षणात्परमं लिंगं प्रादुर्भूतं शिवात्मकम् । ज्ञानमानंदमत्यंतं कोटिज्वालाग्निसन्निभम् ४६।\n\nशंकुकर्णोऽथ मुक्तात्मा तदात्मा सर्वगोऽमलः । निलिल्ये विमले लिंगे तदद्भुतमिवाभवत् ४७।\n\n45-47. Thus having praised the revered Kapardin, Śaṅkukarṇa also prostrated himself on the ground and uttered the highest (syllable) Om. At that moment only the great Linga of Śiva appeared there. It was knowledge, joy, and very much like the fire having a crore of flames. Śaṅkukarṇa’s soul was liberated. His pure soul moved everywhere. It merged into that pure Linga. (Thus) a great wonder took place.\n\n~ पद्मपुराणम्/खण्डः ३ (स्वर्गखण्डः)/अध्यायः ३५ || कूर्मपुराणम्-पूर्वभागः/त्रयस्त्रिंशत्तमोऽध्यायः\n\nCausless Love Vs Moksha Fixation\n\nIt must be Added that True and Pure devotees of Shiva do not care about liberation or mukti at all. All they care about is to have unflinching Bhakti for their lord.\n\nSee the words of Maharsi Nandisvara, One of the Greatest Shiva Bhaktas, when Lord Shiva Offered to Give Him any boon be it the position of Devas such as Indra or Brahma, Lordship, Ashta siddhis or even Liberation.\n\n~ Varaha Purana, Chapter 213\n\nSee the Words of The Great Shaiva Sage Upamanyu in the Mahabharata.\n\nअपि कीटः पतङ्गो वा भवेयं शङ्कराज्ञया। न तु शक्र त्वया दत्तं त्रैलोक्यमपि कामये॥ 13-45-170\n\nHey Śakra (indra), I will become either kīṭaḥ (insect) or pataṅgaḥ (A flying bird) with the order of Śaṅkaraḥ (शङ्कराज्ञः), but I don’t desire even if you offer trailōkyam (3 worlds)\n\nश्वाऽपि महेश्वरवचनाद्भवामि स हि नः परः कामः। त्रिदशगणराज्यमपि खलु नेच्छाम्यमहेश्वराज्ञप्तम्॥ 13-45-171\n\nWith the words of mahēśvaraḥ I’ll become a dog if he desires, I don’t desire any bigger than that. In such a way, I don’t desire what mahēśvaraḥ hasn’t ordered for me (for my life)\n\nन नाकपृष्ठं न च देवराज्यं न ब्रह्मलोकं न च निष्कलत्वम्। न सर्वकामानखिलान्वृणोमि हरस्य दासत्वमहं वृणोमि॥ 13-45-172\n\nI don’t want svargaḥ, cities, brahma-lōkaḥ, or even the highest (निर्गुणब्रह्मप्राप्तिः / अद्वैतमोक्षः i.e., निष्कलत्वम्), I reject (I don’t choose) all the desires, I only desire being a hara-dāsaḥ (Servant of Shiva)\n\n~ महाभारतम्-13-अनुशासनपर्व-045 - विकिस्रोतः\n\nSo If Being A Shiva Bhakta is your Goal, You Should emulate the path of the greatest Shiva Bhaktas as mentioned in the scriptures and not care about anything else other than being devoted to your lord. Liberation is Insignificant for a selfless Bhakta, For them only devotion to their Ishta matters.\n\nAs Sri Nilakantha Dikshitar too says in is Ananda Sagara Stava while doing Stuti for Devi.\n\nnāhaṁ sahē tava kathāśravaṇāntarāyam nāhaṁ sahē tava padārcanavicyutiṁ vā | mōkṣaṁ diśaitadaviruddhamidam na cētsyā- nnaivāstu mātarapavarga-mahōpsargaḥ ||\n\nAmba! Mīnākṣi, daughter of Pāṇḍya Bhūpāla, the one whose gaze is sweeter than sweetness, I am told by many that mōkṣa is the goal. Everyone seems to be doing something to achieve this mōkṣa! As for me, I cannot withstand for a minute, not listening to your divine līlā viśēṣa. I cannot bear for a second, separation from the worship of your lotus feet! If this “mōkṣa” that people so desire is something that does not disturb either of these, then give it to me! Else, I do not care for that apavarga which is actually upasarga (misfortune or a great disease)!\n\nThose who worship demigods enter into the darkest region of ignorance.\n\nŚrī Īśopaniṣad Mantra 12\n\nThose who are engaged in the worship of demigods enter into the darkest region of ignorance, and still more so do the worshipers of the impersonal Absolute.\n\nVishnu worship is the religion of Gods while Shiva Worship is the religion of Daityas and Rakshasas.\n\nVaman Purana 11.15-16,26\n\nGods other than Vishnu should not be worshipped\n\nYou alone are the lord of brāhmaṇas. No other god is respectable. O Puruṣottama, those who worship any other god than you, have become impious, and are censured by all the world. You, Janārdana, are alone fit to be worshipped by brāhmaṇas, well-versed in the Vedas. None else among the gods is ever venerable. Brahmā, Rudra and others, mixed with rajas and tamas are not fit to be worshipped. You, having pure sattva, are fit to be worshipped by brāhmaṇas. The water (flowing) from your feet should be resorted to by manes, gods, and all brāhmaṇas. It gives salvation, and destroys sins. Manes, gods, brāhmaṇas should take what is left over after you have eaten, and not what is left over after others have eaten. The food, flowers, so also water of (i.e. offered to) other gods, would all be unfit to be touched. It is useless like liquor. Therefore, a wise brāhmaṇa should constantly worship you, the eternal one, everyday and should take water of (i.e. sanctified by) you and food eaten by you.\n\n65-68. A brāhmaṇa should not see another god; should not worship him. He should not partake of another god’s favour; should not enter the sanctuary of any other (god). (If) a man does not give in this world the food and holy water enjoyed by you in the rite of śrāddha offered to his ancestors, all that would be fruitless. His dead ancestors fall into (and live in) the hell of pus and blood for thousands of crores of kalpas and hundreds of crores of kalpas.\n\nPadma Purana Uttarakhanda Ch 255\n\nShiva is the God of Tamas Guna. Since Shiva is composed of the Hymns of Sama Veda, The sounds of Sama Veda are impure.\n\nMarkandeya Purana 99.19\n\nHindi Translation-\n\nThe Vicious ones worship Shiva as the highest God Which leads to their downfall.\n\nThe lord said: O Rudra, O you of mighty arms, O you best god, for deluding the enemies of gods prepare a course of conduct to be followed by heretics. Narrate to them the dark Purāṇas (i.e. Purāṇas that will take them astray). O you very intelligent one, also fashion confusing holy texts. There will be brāhmaṇas and great sages who have given themselves away to me. 26-33. Approaching them through devotion for me, tell the vicious ones: Kaṇāda, Gautama, Śakti, Upamanyu, Jaimini, Kapila, Durvāsas, Mṛkaṇḍu, Bṛhaspati, Bhārgava and Jāmadagnya are the ten (?) vicious sages. Desiring to do the good of the world, approach them with your power of suggestion (bhāvaśakti?). By your power increased in viciousness infused into them they will be vicious in a moment. There is no doubt about it. Those brāhmaṇas with greater viciousness caused by you, will narrate the vicious Purāṇas and doctrines in the three worlds. O god, you yourself, wearing the marks like a skull, hide, ash, bones, fully delude the people in the three worlds. So also you, Śiva, prepare the Pāśupata order with its divisions like Kaṅkāla, Śaiva, Pāṣaṇḍa and Mahāśaiva; so also properly prepare the doctrine having no particular marks and outside the Vedic fold. All the mean men will wear ash, bones etc. and will be insensible. The vicious ones will describe you as the highest (god).\n\n34-36a. Taking to their doctrine all the ancient demons will be averse to me in a moment. There is no doubt (about it).O very powerful Rudra, in my incarnations I too shall worship you in every age to delude the vicious ones. Having upheld this doctrine, they will undoubtedly fall.\n\nPadmapurana Uttara khanda Chapter 235\n\nWorshippers of Shiva will descend to the standard of atheism and be considered heretics due to the curse of Bhrigu muni.\n\nBy blaspheming the principles of the Vedas, which are the pure and supreme path of the saintly persons, certainly you followers of Bhūtapati, Lord Śiva, will descend to the standard of atheism without a doubt.\n\nSrimad Bhagavatam 4.2.32\n\nThus repudiated by him the (sage) of a great penance remained there, at the door of the great lord, for many days. “Since he, arrogant due to the company of a woman, thinks lightly of me, he shall have the form of clitoris. Approached (i.e. overcome) by vice he slights me, a brāhmaṇa! Reduced to an impious state, he will not be adored by brāhmaṇas. Therefore, all the food, water, flowers and oblations offered to him will undoubtedly be useless.” 35-40. The very lustrous one, having thus cursed Śaṃkara honoured by the world, said to the very fierce attendant, Nan-din, holding a spear, O king: “May Śiva’s devotees, having ash, phallus and bones be impious and out of the Vedic fold.”\n\nPadma Purana Uttara Khanda Ch 255\n\nShaiva puranas lead to hell.\n\n18-22a. Know from me that Mātsya, Kaurma, Laiṅga, Saiva, so also Skānda and Āgneya are tāmasa (vicious). O you of an auspicious appearance, the Purāṇas, viz. Vaiṣṇava, Nāradīya, so also the auspicious Bhagavata, similarly Gāruḍa, Pādma, Vārāha should be known to be sāttvika (or virtuous). Know from me that Brahmāṇḍa, Brahmavaivarta, Mārkaṇḍeya, Bhaviṣya, Vāmana and Brāhma are rājasa (endowed with the quality of passion). The sattvika ones are said to give salvation and are always auspicious. Similarly, O goddess, the tāmasa are said to be the cause of (i.e. lead one to) hell.\n\nPadma purana Uttarakhanda Ch 236\n\nThose Brahmanas who eat food offered to Lord Shiva will be roasted in hellfire.\n\n98-101. Therefore, brāhmaṇas should always eat the remnants of the food offered to Viṣṇu. The remnants (of food offered to other gods) are useless and (therefore) condemned. A brāhmaṇa, weak in knowledge, who even once eats the remnants of food etc. offered to Śaṅkara etc., would certainly be a cāṇḍāla. For thousands of crores of kalpas he is roasted in the fire in hell. O best brāhmaṇas, the remnants of offerings to gods like Rudra, are said to be equal to food offered to demons, yakṣas, goblins and like liquor and flesh. Brāhmaṇas should not eat that food, the offering enjoyed by (these) gods.\n\nPadma Purana Uttarakhanda Chapter 255\n\nEven Shakta Upapurana Devi Purana says Shiva's prasadam is not fit for consumption,only Vishnu's Is.One who consumes Shiva's prasad Faces Vishnu's wrath. Shiva's prasad becomes fit for consumption only when purified by touching it with a Shalgram Shila of Vishnu.\n\nDevi Purana Chapter 81\n\nThose Who Worship Brahma, Shiva etc. undergo great hardhips, calamities and foul diseases like Leprosy or Fistula. Hence, not even in adverse circumstances, Shiva should be worshipped.\n\nGaruda Purana III.1.27-28\n\nThose who condemn the worshippers of False Gods (i.e Gods Other than Vishnu) are truly Good people.\n\nThese mantras are thus explained in the Kūrma Purāṇa:—“Undoubtedly the worshippers of other deities than Viṣṇu go to blinding darkness, but undoubtedly to greater darkness they go who do not censure and condemn such persons (and fail to??????????? their mistakes). Therefore those, who know the Lord Narayana, in His true form as free from all evils and who also condemn the worshippers of false deities, are truly the good people.\n\nKurma Purana, Quoted in Madhvacharya's Commentary on Isopanishad Mantra 11"
