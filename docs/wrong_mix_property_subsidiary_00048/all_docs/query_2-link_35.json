        "text": "Aziz was born and raised in Washington, DC where he was spoiled by free museums, great bookstores, and easy access to Rock Creek Park. He earned a BA with Honors in Chemistry from Oberlin College. During his time at Oberlin, Aziz collaborated with Dr. Matthew Elrod to research the kinetics of organosulfate formation from sulfuric acid and atmospherically relevant alcohols such as glycerol, erythritol, and 2-methyltetrol. He spent his senior year working with Dr. Shuming Chen, using a combination of computational and synthetic methods to investigate instances of multiple products arising from a single transition state, known as post-transition state bifurcations.\n\nAfter four years of enduring Ohio winters, Aziz moved to sunny Southern California in 2023 and joined the Bradforth Lab, where he will use TRPES to study the ultrafast photochemistry of precursors to atmospheric brown carbon (BrC). In his free time, Aziz likes to read, play card and board games, and bankrupt himself by searching for good coffee and bagels.\n\nEmail: azizmoha@usc.edu\n\nWhile born in Los Angeles, Brandon moved at a young age to Atlanta, GA followed soon after to Chicago, IL. There he studied for a Master’s in Inorganic Chemistry under Kyle Grice at DePaul University. Brandon analyzed potential Group 6 and 7 dimer complexes as carbon dioxide reduction catalysts using IR-Spectroelectrochemistry and DFT (Density Functional Theory).\n\nAfterward, Brandon decided to return to the City of Angels to work towards a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry under the tutelage of Dr. Steve Bradforth. Brandon is currently focused on preparing and studying anionic carbon species via TRPES.\n\nOutside the halls of USC, Brandon enjoys playing bass guitar, exploring the various neighborhoods of LA, and reading current neuroscience research in the fields of hearing and learning.\n\nProject: Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Liquid-Phase Carbanions\n\nContact: bmyoung@usc.edu\n\nThabassum grew up in the southern part of India, Kerala. He did his BS-MS from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali (IISER). At IISER, he was mentored by Dr Jino George. As a part of his MS thesis, he studied the modifications of chemical reaction landscapes initiated when the vibrational modes of molecules are coupled to vacuum field modes generated inside optical\n\ncavities.\n\nIn 2021, he moved to LA and joined Steve’s lab for graduate studies. At USC, he will be probing the ultrafast dynamics of photocatalytic systems. More precisely, his studies aim to generate highly tunable, earth abundant photosensitizers to drive photocatalysts more efficiently. Apart from his graduate studies, he enjoys travelling and listening to music.\n\nJosé grew up among the agave-covered valleys and hills of Jalisco, Mexico. At a young age he and his family emigrated to the U.S. After getting used to the endless, flat almond fields of central California, he started his undergraduate degree at California State University Stanislaus, in Turlock, California (also known as Turkey Tech). He graduated from Stan State with a BS in Chemistry in Spring 2019. At Stan State he studied UV-damaged DNA repair mechanisms using single molecule spectroscopy under the supervision of Elvin Alemán.\n\nHe arrived at USC in the fall of 2019 and joined Steve Bradforth’s group the following spring. At USC, his research consists of studying the role that flanking bases have on the ultrafast formation of cyclobutane thymine dimers in DNA, following absorption of UV light. In June 2020, José was awarded a funded one-year National Institute of Health (NIH) fellowship in the Chemistry-Biology Interface (CBI) T32 program.\n\nHis hobbies and interests vary wildly, including (but not limited to) collecting a variety of stuff (from foreign currency to rocks, anything really), hiking (his dream is to hike as many volcanos as possible), eating, reading history and as of now, learning Chinese!\n\nShivalee joined USC in fall 2018 and joined Steve’s lab shortly thereafter. She completed both Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry from Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan (West Bengal) in India. Her master’s thesis was entitled Turn-on luminescence sensing of toxic metal ions by a new manganese complex. After her bachelor’s degree, she undertook a summer internship at IISER, Mohali working under Dr. Arijit Kumar De, publishing work on understanding picosecond solvation dynamics using fluorescent probes with small Stokes shifts. A year before joining USC, she worked as a lecturer in Shyamsundar College, University of Burdwan.\n\nIn her spare time, she loves acrylic painting, travelling places (mostly mountains), enjoys biking trips; she also admits to being fond of doing nothing at all!\n\nWenTing (Wendy) grew up and live in Los Angeles, California where she is currently studying as an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California for a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering. She joined the Bradforth group spring of 2022. She is currently working with Brandon on photoelectron spectroscopy of liquid-phase carbanions and solved electron solutions. She is interested in work relating to pharmaceutical and drug development or synthetic processes for organic material in the future. Apart from her academic studies, she enjoys swimming, going out, cooking, and spending quality playtime with her new kitten, Potato.\n\nChristine grew up in Los Angeles, California and moved soon after to Orange County where she finished her high school degree at Brea Olinda High School. She is currently continuing her academic journey as an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California for a B.S. in Chemistry under the Dornsife School of Letter, Sciences, and Arts.\n\nShe began to attend USC in the fall of 2022 and joined the Bradforth group in the following spring of 2023. She is currently working with José, studying the ultrafast formation of cyclobutane thymine dimers and how it relates to DNA using the absorption of UV light and NMR. Apart from her academics, her interests include golfing, crocheting, cafe-hopping, and eating out.\n\nTommy grew up in the eastern side of China, then after moving to and living in Canada for a few years, went to high school in Boston. He graduated from Brooks School there, and now studies in biological sciences and data science as an undergraduate student at USC.\n\nHe joined Steve Bradforth’s group during his second semester at USC in the spring of 2023. He is currently working on processing the large amounts of data generated by the high repetition rate lasers for the DNA photophysics project. He enjoys reading books and trying new types of food."
