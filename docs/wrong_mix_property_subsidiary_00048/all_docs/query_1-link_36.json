        "text": "Horacio Dante Espinosa is the James and Nancy Farley Professor of Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering, and the Director of the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Program at the McCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern University (NU).\n\nEspinosa is a mechanician and nanotechnologist known for his contributions in the areas of deformation and failure of materials, design of micro- and nano-systems, and microfluidics for single cell manipulation and analysis. He has published over 300 technical papers in these topics. In recognition to his many contributions, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2020. Throughout the years, his work has received broad attention in the specialized media.\n\nNicolas A. Alderete\n\nGraduate student\n\nNicolas is from Buenos Aires, Argentina. He received his Professional Mechanical Engineering Degree (Masters equivalent) from the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology (ITBA) in 2015. After graduating, he worked for two years in the R&D department of Tenaris S.A. working on computational modeling and mechanical testing of fatigue-subject components for the O&G industry. During 2016-2018 he moved to consulting where he led several projects on applied computational mechanics and mechanical design for the Argentine Steel, Aerospace, Nuclear and Automotive industries. He joined Prof. Espinosaâ€™s group at Northwestern University in Fall 2018 to pursue his Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. His research focuses on multifunctional materials, at the intersections of mechanical metamaterials and biologically-inspired materials. When not in the lab Nicolas enjoys reading, road tripping, going to the philharmonic and checking out the Chicago scene."
