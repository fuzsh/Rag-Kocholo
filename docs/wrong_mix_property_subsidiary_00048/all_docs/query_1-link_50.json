However, ShiVa Engine is no longer being developed and supported. After some research, I found out that in order to build a 64-bit game with ShiVa Engine, I need the lib S3DClientNative_Android.a 64bit. However, this lib is only available in ShiVa 2.0. Therefore, I would like to ask everyone: • Does anyone have ShiVa 2.0? • Does anyone have lib S3DClientNative_Android.a 64bit? I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nAdditional information: • I have tried searching for ShiVa 2.0 and lib S3DClientNative_Android.a 64bit online but have not been able to find them. • I am willing to pay for ShiVa 2.0 and lib S3DClientNative_Android.a 64bit."
