        "text": "George Serafeim is the Charles M. Williams Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, where he co-leads the Climate and Sustainability Impact Lab in the Digital, Data, and Design Institute. He teaches the course \"Risks, Opportunities and Investments in an Era of Climate Change\" (ROICC) that he designed for the MBA program. With a focus on operating and business models, ROICC has three tracks, entrepreneurial, managerial and investment, for students developing skills to excel in creating or joining startups, moving to managerial positions, or joining an investment firm. It explores growing opportunities in energy transition (such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, off the grid solar energy systems, green hydrogen, renewable energy generation, and bioethanol for clean cooking), materials and product utilization (such as circular models for reuse or recycle, plant based food, and lab grown agriculture), and enabling solutions (such as energy storage, carbon capture and storage, digital and AI driven models, carbon accounting, carbon credits and markets, risk management, and innovative financing). Professor Serafeim teaches in the school's custom executive education programs for senior leaders of global companies.\n\nPreviously, he taught “Reimagining Capitalism: Business and Big Problems”, which received the Ideas Worth Teaching Award from the Aspen Institute and the Grand Page Prize, \"Financial Reporting and Control,\" and created the Impact-Weighted Accounts Project that designed methodologies, produced large datasets, and incubated dozens of pilot projects globally on impact accounting and valuation. He has presented his research in over 60 countries around the world and ranks among the most popular authors on the Social Science Research Network. His book \"Purpose and Profit: How Business Can Lift Up the World\" explores the challenges and opportunities in building and sustaining profitable purpose-driven organizations that have a measurable positive impact on society.\n\nProfessor Serafeim’s research currently focuses on the intersection between the sustainability transformation and the digital and AI transformation. Specifically, he spends most of his research time on the use of generative AI to study climate solutions products and services. Over the years his research has span four main areas: business strategies in the context of climate change transition risk and opportunities, measuring organizational purpose and analyzing its drivers and consequences, sustainability data analytics and strategies, and the role of leadership and governance in corporate behavior and performance. His research is widely cited, having been published in prestigious academic and practitioner journals, across the fields of accounting, finance, management, and strategy. He has received multiple recognitions, including the Greenhill Award for outstanding contributions to the HBS community, the Pericles Leadership Award in recognition of services to the Hellenic Republic, the Kim B. Clark Fellowship on Responsible Leadership from University of Oxford, the Dr. Richard A. Crowell Memorial Prize, the JIBS Decade Award, and twice the Graham and Dodd Scroll Award.\n\nProfessor Serafeim has held several positions of leadership that allow him to bring, alongside research insights, a wealth of relevant experience to the classroom. He serves on the board of directors of Liberty Mutual, a Fortune 100 company, and on the advisory boards of leading investment firms, Summa Equity, Apax, and Neuberger Berman. He is an academic partner at State Street Associates, where he directs research on climate change-related transition and physical risks and opportunities and human capital factors that are affecting return and risk for institutional investors globally. He has been an investor and advisor to several start-ups over the years.\n\nPreviously, he co-founded the advisory services firm KKS, served on the board of directors of dss+, a leading operations consulting firm, and on the board of directors of AEA-Bridges Impact that combined with Harley-Davidson’s electric motorcycle division to create the first publicly traded electric motorcycle company in the US. Focusing on corporate governance, he served on the steering committee of the Athens Exchange Group, the governance body for both stock and bond exchanges, and as the Chairperson of Greece’s Corporate Governance Council. During his tenure, a new corporate governance code was issued to improve governance practices, investor protection, and business performance. He has contributed in advancing corporate transparency globally, having served on the inaugural Standards Council of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, which created standards for investor relevant sustainability corporate disclosures adopted by thousands of leading companies around the world, and on the Taskforce Working Group on Impact Transparency, Integrity and Reporting established by the UK's Presidency of the G7 nations. He was a member of the first ever decarbonization advisory panel for the New York Common Retirement Fund, one of the largest US pension funds, which offered recommendations on how to identify, assess and manage investment risks and opportunities from the energy transition.\n\nProfessor Serafeim earned his doctorate in business administration at Harvard Business School, where his doctoral dissertation was recognized with the Wyss Award for excellence in research. He received a master's degree in accounting and finance from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where he was awarded the Emeritus Professors’ Prize for best academic performance. He grew up in Athens, Greece.\n\nMBA Course\n\nThe MBA course on \"Risks, Opportunities, and Investments in an Era of Climate Change\" is ideal for students who aspire to become entrepreneurs by starting their own company or joining a start-up that is driving innovation and solving challenges posed by climate change. Additionally, the course will benefit those who wish to lead or advise firms on transitioning their operations and business models to become more sustainable and innovative. Finally, the course will be beneficial to students seeking to understand the full spectrum of climate opportunities pursuing a career in venture capital, private equity, or public markets investing.\n\nCases accompanied by teaching plans for instructors include:\n\n1. Apple's iPhone and developing circular economy models: The trade-in program encouraged customers to trade in their old devices, which were then refurbished and resold, or recycled for valuable components. With about 80% of the second-hand smartphone market comprised of iPhone and an increasing percentage of materials being recycled and reused in manufacturing, Apple was making progress towards circularity. But what was the impact of circularity on revenues, operating profits and carbon emissions?\n\n2. BMW's decarbonization and electrification strategy: automakers, consumers, regulators, and investors were focusing on the transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EV). While this would reduce tail-pipe emissions, the production of EVs—and especially their batteries—increased emissions in the supply chain. BMW was focusing on life cycle emissions and was pursuing a flexible powertrain strategy by offering vehicles with several powertrain options: gasoline and diesel-fueled ICE, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Was this the right strategy to pursue?\n\n3. Galy's efforts in lab grown agriculture: GALY, founded in 2019, aimed to produce cotton and other crops from cells grown in the lab. The company hoped to create 500,000 tons of products by 2030, and by 2023, had produced proof of concepts of cotton, coffee, and cacao. Bueno had a number of decisions to make. How should the company scale? Where should it locate production? Should it build its own production facilities, or license its intellectual property to partner firms? Should the company continue operating an office in Brazil, or centralize operations in Boston? The answers to these questions would point the way forward, but which path was best?\n\n4. Solvay's product portfolio management tool: The case describes the announcement of a new strategic plan to grow the business, increase return on capital, decrease absolute emissions and transition the product portfolio to be a leading environmental solutions company. Were those objectives in conflict or synergistic? Solvay had developed a sustainability tool called Sustainability Product Management to identify promising business applications. How effective was the tool? What business lines should Solvay promote to grow and at the same time be more sustainable?\n\n5. Northvolt's development of a vertically integrated battery producer: Having raised billions of dollars of capital and secured tens of billions in customer offtake agreements, Northvolt was making progress towards building gigafactories to produce batteries and compete with established battery manufacturers. How did the founders succeed to get both the capital and customer agreements? Where should they focus their expansion plans?\n\n6. Itau's offering of financial products that link credit terms to sustainability metrics: Itau BBA had structured dozens of sustainability linked bonds, which made future interest payments a function of the borrower meeting a target for a sustainability metric, and had solidified its reputation as a pioneer of sustainable finance in Latin America. Should Itau expand its sustainable debt business to firms with high ESG risks and if so, what must be done to gain support from Itau executives, investors, and high-risk issuers? What systems should Itau adopt to alleviate concerns and would the transaction costs of these systems, such as enhanced disclosure or monitoring, be too steep to justify underwriting the product?\n\n7. EKI's role as a broker and developer of carbon credits: Within nine months from the time of its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in April of 2021, EKI Energy Services (EKI) shares had increased by more than 8,000%. However, several commentators started doubting the credibility of the carbon credits that firms purchased or developed and sold to customers worldwide. Was this a reasonable price to pay for EKI’s assets and future profitability? How sustainable were the earnings of the company and its stock market valuation in the fast-changing carbon credit market?\n\n8. Neuberger Berman's climate transition investment strategies: While most climate transition strategies almost completely divested from the energy sector and relied on a single quantitative data metric, NB’s approach invested in energy and other high carbon intensive companies, used a plethora of quantitative metrics and qualitative analyst judgments, engaged with management leveraging bottom-up fundamental analysis, and over time re-assessed firm alignment with net zero goals. Given that NB’s climate transition approach included high carbon emitters and its complexity, how could NB communicate its approach effectively to asset allocators? A second question revolved around “how high to set the bar.” Lastly, climate focused funds had seen significant inflows in China and NB wanted to integrate its net zero alignment indicator into the construction of investment products there. Given this, should the net zero transition alignment standards be different across geographies?\n\n9. KOKO Network's biofuelled clean cooking: By August 2023, KOKO served over one million households across ten cities in Kenya and planned to expand further in Kenya as well as build greenfield utilities in Rwanda and other African nations. Yet, the co-founders knew that the road ahead was full not only of opportunities, but also of challenges. KOKO’s approach required the development of new customized policy on standards, regulations, and taxation – within consumer fuel, hardware and carbon credits - and the ability to persuade and inspire the development of this policy at the necessary pace.\n\n10. Elon Musk's entrepreneurial venture at Tesla: This case gives an overview of Elon Musk’s career arc through the lens of the 2003 founding of Tesla and its growth through 2022. The case also contains information on Musk’s early life and endeavors beyond Tesla, with a focus on his management style and the implications for Tesla’s success and his aim to influence human civilization for the better.\n\n11. EU CBAM's policy: a carbon border tax intended to address business competition challenges plaguing EU ETS by establishing comparable carbon costs within EU borders for imports and local goods. The enforcement of CBAM raised several questions for cement and steel producers around the world. First, what would be the impact on their strategies and financial performance? Second, what actions could they take in response? Would CBAM be effective at reducing emissions and addressing emissions leakage? How would other countries respond to CBAM and would the response affect those countries’ carbon emissions reduction efforts?\n\nTeaching plans are under development for other cases in the course.\n\nHow Business Can Lift Up the World\n\nAvailable for order now.\n\nAre purpose and profit substitutes or complementary? What are the technological, societal, and market forces that are reshaping this relationship? What can we all do to reshape the relationship between purpose and profit as entrepreneurs, managers, consumers, employees, and investors? Backed by cutting-edge research, \"Purpose and Profit\" provides answers to these fundamental questions that are increasingly defining the competitiveness of businesses all around the world. Based on more than a decade of field and archival research Professor Serafeim takes readers through a journey to understand:\n\nHow and why environmental and social issues are becoming increasingly relevant for businesses all around the world;\n\nThe ways that companies can design and implement a strategy that has more positive impact;\n\nThe six archetypes of value creation enabled by these new trends;\n\nThe role of investors in supporting companies by recognizing the value of strategic management of material sustainability issues and\n\nHow we can all look at our choices and our careers through the lens of these societal trends to drive impact in our lives and for our organizations.\n\nMBA Course\n\nThe MBA course on \"Risks, Opportunities, and Investments in an Era of Climate Change\" is ideal for students who aspire to become entrepreneurs by starting their own company or joining a start-up that is driving innovation and solving challenges posed by climate change.
