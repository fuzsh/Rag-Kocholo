        "text": "The world is experiencing a powerful and rapid convergence of science, technology and commerce. Great scientific minds are driving awe-inspiring commercial initiatives, and companies around the globe are seeking the insight and competitive advantage that advanced science can provide. EAG is at the forefront of this revolution ⁠that is changing the way products are developed, designed, manufactured and used by millions of people around the planet.\n\nWhether you are seeking to speed time-to-market, solve manufacturing problems or ensure regulatory compliance, turn to EAG. We know how to bring the power of science to every phase of your product lifecycle.\n\nIt was 1978, the dawn of the tech boom, when Dr. Charles Andrew “Drew” Evans arrived in Silicon Valley. An expert in Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Drew recognized the important role SIMS could play in the advancement of integrated circuit technology. He left his faculty position at University of Illinois, taking with him recent PhD student Vaughn Deline. He also convinced Rich Blattner, a financial partner, to join them in what was then a very bold move: to establish a commercial laboratory serving the tech industry. The trio opened shop in San Mateo as Charles Evans and Associates (CEA) with just one Cameca ims 3f SIMS instrument, and quickly became “the place to go” for the likes of Intel and its cohorts.\n\nFast forward seven years to 1985. Steve Jobs unveiled the original Macintosh, Nintendo released its first gaming system and General Electric was about to purchase RCA Corporation. Drew rightly predicted that GE ownership would bring RCA’s demise, freeing up technical talent he needed to support CEA’s first geographic expansion. He began recruiting RCA researchers and former Cornell University classmates, Charles Magee and Bill Harrington, to join forces. In 1987, they, along with SIMS analyst, Ephraim Botnik, were convinced not only to leave their jobs but to invest significant personal savings to establish “Evans East” in Plainsboro, New Jersey. The legacy of Evans East endures today as EAG’s Princeton, New Jersey lab.\n\nWhile building its reputation as a service provider, CEA’s 30-plus employees also acquired a talent for modifying software and hardware to push through analytical limitations. This drive to improve visibility and enhance measurements was the genesis of the CEA Instrument Division in 1987. Lead by CEA hardware pioneers Ron Flemming, David Reed, Robert Oldham and Bruno Schueler, CEA innovated myriad technologies, including a Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) end-station, Light SIMS design microscope, several versions of drift SIMS and Time-of-Flight SIMS—an innovation that earned Schueler an R&D 100 Award. The CEA instrument division was purchased by instrument manufacturer Physical Electronics in 1994. Five years later, Physical Electronics was sold to a High Voltage Engineering (HVE), which was subsequently acquired by private equity firm American Capital Strategies in 2005—and The Evans Analytical Group was born.\n\nSince EAG’s beginnings over 40 years ago, the scientific community has amassed an enormous body of knowledge and analytical know-how. Today, we can see, measure, characterize and evaluate advanced materials and components with a precision and at a scale once unimaginable—and with each day, the pace of innovation accelerates. The materials scientists and microelectronics engineers of EAG take pride in being a part of this revolution, and look to the future with eager anticipation for inventions to come."
