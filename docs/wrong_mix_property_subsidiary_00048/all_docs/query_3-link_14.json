        "text": "Analysis and ProductionInformation collected in the previous ste.docx\n\nAnalysis and ProductionInformation collected in the previous ste.docxnettletondevon\n\nAnalysis and Production Information collected in the previous steps will be analyzed, validated, and fused into intelligence in the analysis process to be included into finished intelligence products. Analysis is defined by the ODNI as “The process by which information is transformed into intelligence; a systematic examination of information to identify significant facts, make judgments, and draw conclusions.” (ODNI, 2013) This transformation occurs when All-Source Analysts use all the Single Source INTs to create a fused intelligence product. Single Source INT We learned about “Single Source INTs” in Module three and they are HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, OSINT, and MASINT. They are referred to as single source because they are derived from a single type of INT. You may hear of a single source SIGINT analyst, who is an expert in signals intelligence collection, or a single source IMINT analyst, who is an expert in imagery intelligence collection. All-Source INT The All-Source Analyst is not an expert in collection of the single sources, but is instead an expert in a region or intelligence function (terrorism, counter-drug, crime, etc.) that is the consumer of the raw single source information from all INTs. Analysts receive incoming information, evaluate it, test it against other information and against their personal knowledge and expertise, produce an assessment of the current status of a particular area under analysis, and then forecast future trends or outcomes. The analyst also develops requirements for the collection of new information. (ODNI, 2013) The All-Source Analyst will learn through experience to validate information using multiple INTs to confirm information collected through a single source INT. For example, if information is collected from a HUMINT source, the All-Source Analyst will look for another HUMINT source to collaborate that information or possibly validate the original HUMINT source through SIGINT sources. Validation Validation is important to also counter an adversary’s attempts to conduct deception; however, the well-organized adversary will release multiple pieces of information through various INTs to mislead All-Source Analysts. A good adversarial deception plan will not only allow deceptive pieces of information to be collected to attempt to fool our intelligence analysts, but will also play into an analyst’s bias. The common biases of an analyst are mirror imaging (thinking the adversary will act the same way Americans do), cry-wolf syndrome (conducting an action multiple times so that when the adversary truly intends to act, our analysts do not take it seriously), and mission-creep/new normal (an adversary slowly changes tactics so that our analysts do not suspect nefarious activities). It is important for All-Source Analysts to be confident in their assessments, but they should be wary of overconfidence Many think that the job of an intelligence analyst is to predict the future. In fact, many early analytic.\n\n· One pageThe Secret Universe of the CellDocumentary - The Hid.docx\n\n· One pageThe Secret Universe of the CellDocumentary - The Hid.docxoswald1horne84988\n\n· One page The Secret Universe of the Cell Documentary - The Hidden Life of the Cell- https://youtu.be/SoIP1_fbNpI • Create a document with 10 bullet point notes Explain- 10 things you learned or find fascinating about •The microscopic universe of the cell •The complexity of cellular life and how it continues to evolve •The epic battle between cells and viruses Explain- Why human diversity & biodiversity in general is a vitally important factor in this ongoing battle between viruses and cells. By now you should have a strong understanding of the history of intelligence in the U.S.; how the intelligence community functions; how intelligence is produced; and the role of local, state and the federal governments in intelligence activities. But, you may still be wondering where does all the information that these entities collect actually come from. And, just as importantly, how is this information obtained. In lesson three, we learned about the intelligence process and used the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA’s) five-phase cycle to examine the various steps. As you recall, in the process, phase two is the collection phase. We briefly also identified and defined the six basic sources of information. These are referred to as “intelligence collection disciples” or the “INTs” 1. Human Intelligence (HUMINT) 2. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) derived from all communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), or foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT). 3. Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) 4. Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) 5. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) 6. Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) These six disciplines are the sources of all the information that is collected to produce intelligence products. Remember, it is a bit of a misperception that secret “movie-like” missions collect all information. While it is true that some is indeed collected in the more classic “spy” type way; a great deal of information is collected by looking at sources that everyone can access. For the purposes of this class, we will use the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) explanations of the first five INTs, which include a high level discussion of which members of the IC use the those INTs. The description of the last INT, GEOINT, remains the same as lesson three and is provided by the CIA. Human Intelligence (HUMINT) is the collection of information from human sources. The collection may be done openly. For example: when FBI agents interview witnesses or suspects, or it may be done through clandestine or covert means (espionage). Within the United States, HUMINT collection is the FBI’s responsibility. Beyond U.S. borders, HUMINT is generally collected by the CIA, but also by other U.S. components abroad. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) refers to electronic transmissions that can be collected by ships, planes, ground sites, or satellites. Communications Intelligence (COMINT) is a type of SIGINT and refers to the.\n\nW4 Lecture 1 The Landscape of Intelligence Criminal Intellige.docx\n\nW4 Lecture 1 The Landscape of Intelligence Criminal Intellige.docxmelbruce90096\n\nW4 Lecture 1 \"The Landscape of Intelligence\" Criminal Intelligence Analysis The Landscape of Intelligence The Intelligence Community So far we have addressed the “intelligence community” in fairly broad terms, making only passing references to its diverse membership and how they might be understood in relationship to each other. We can generally understand the intelligence community as falling into four separate but sometimes overlapping categories with each category approaching intelligence from a different aspect. But before we dive too far into that subject, we need to make a distinction between the “intelligence community” and the Intelligence Community (IC). The IC refers to the formal bureaucracy of organizations under the United States government. Thanks to the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004, which defined all intelligence as national intelligence in order to streamline information sharing (Lowenthal, 2012), it can be difficult to sort out what we mean by “criminal intelligence” when we speak of criminal intelligence analysis. In this lecture we will look at the IC in the broadest sense, interpreting it as involving four key terrrains on which the exercise of intelligence analysis takes place often in striking similar ways: national intelligence, military intelligence, criminal intelligence, and competitive intelligence. National Intelligence When we think of the intelligence community, we usually think of it in terms of national intelligence. National intelligence refers to intelligence about national-level requirements affecting the security of the state. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has jurisdiction over national intelligence inside the United States. All counterterrorism missions, regardless of whether they manage threats to federal, state, or local governments, ultimately fall under the FBI’s purview. The FBI is a component of the Department of Justice, and as such it plays a key role in investigating federal crimes, as well. A close partner to the FBI is the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), although the DHS also have key disaster management responsibilities. The primary proponent of national intelligence in the United States is the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), which was established under IRTPA to coordinate intelligence activities across the various agencies that service the goals of foreign policy and national security. If the job of the DNI strikes you as being redundant to the job of the DCI, then you would be partially correct. Following investigations into the attacks of September 11, 2001, it was clear someone in the intelligence community would have to suffer the consequences for not forewarning the nation against yet another national security surprise. As the head of the agency establish explicitly to prevent that very thing from occurring, the DCI was essentially decapitated in favor of the DNI, a reasonably sensitive subject for the CIA. Beyo.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consists of U.S. Customs a.pdf\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consists of U.S. Customs a.pdfarmcomputers\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consists of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, United States Coast Guard and the United States Secret Service. The DHS strategic plan states: “The Department of Homeland Security’s overriding and urgent mission is to lead the unified national effort to secure the country and preserve our freedoms. While the Department was created to secure our country against those who seek to disrupt the American way of life, our charter also includes preparation for and response to all hazards and disasters.” Explain both data warehouses and data mining and describe how they could be used in the DHS. Solution Data warehouse : In computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence.[DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data and are used for creating analytical reports for knowledge workers throughout the enterprise. Examples of reports could range from annual and quarterly comparisons and trends to detailed daily sales analysis. The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before it is used in the DW for reporting. Data mining : Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science. It is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The ways we can use data mining in DHS is : 1) Evaluating use of credit cards by people working in DHS 2)Evaluating patterns of security issues like cybercrime , any illegal transportation issues , mine details about borde protection people 3)Identifying fraud activities in all departments if any 4)In forecasting of upcoming security issues based on past patterns using data mining 5)In call details analysis , to analyze all the incoming and outgoing calls if they are from people who cause harm to the country 6)For detecting any malicious intrusions 7)Detect Attacks on critical infrastructurs if any Data warehousing in dHS : A data warehouse is a collection of data that\\'s:.\n\nSteps for Effective Case Analysis Adapted from Harvard .docx\n\nSteps for Effective Case Analysis Adapted from Harvard .docxrjoseph5\n\nSteps for Effective Case Analysis Adapted from Harvard Business Publishing It's useful to think of a case analysis as digging deeper and deeper into the layers of a case. You should make sure to follow these general steps in addition to answering the questions from the case. 1. You start at the surface, Getting Oriented and examining the overall case landscape. 2. Then you begin to dig, Identifying Problems, as well as possible alternative solutions. 3. This is the section where you will spend most of your time. Digging deeper, Performing Analyses you identify information that exposes the issues, gather data, perform calculations that might provide insight. \"Analysis\" describes the varied and crucial things you do with information in the case, to shed light on the problems and issues you've identified. That might mean calculating and comparing cumulative growth rates for different periods from the year-by-year financials in a case's exhibits. Or it might mean pulling together seemingly unrelated facts from two different sections of the case, and combining them logically to arrive at an important conclusion or conjecture. Analysis usually doesn't provide definitive answers. But as you do more of it, a clearer picture often starts to emerge, or the preponderance of evidence begins to point to one interpretation rather than others. Don't expect a case analysis to yield a \"final answer.\" If you're accustomed to doing analysis that ends with a right answer, coming up with a possible solution that simply reflects your best judgment might frustrate you. But remember that cases, much like real-world business experiences, rarely reveal an absolutely correct answer, no matter how deeply you analyze them. Typically, you'll do qualitative analysis based on your reading and interpretation of the case. Ask yourself: What is fact and what is opinion? Which facts are contributing to the problem? Which are the causes? Qualitative factors should be prioritized and fully developed to support your argument. Make notes about your evolving interpretations, always being careful to list the evidence or reasons that support them. Qualitative information in a case can be a mix of objective and subjective information. For example, you may need to assess the validity of quotations from company executives, each of whom has a subjective opinion. Reports from external industry analysts or descriptions of what other companies in the industry have done might seem more objective; no one in the case has a vested interest in this information. A company's internal PowerPoint presentation should be considered separately and differently from a newspaper article about the company. Cases mix firsthand quotations and opinions with third-person narratives, so you need to consider the reliability of sources. As in real life, you shouldn't take all case information at face value. Quantitative data—such as amounts of.\n\nSTEPPING INTO MANAGEMENT.Questions 1 to 20 Select the bes.docx\n\nSTEPPING INTO MANAGEMENT.Questions 1 to 20 Select the bes.docxrjoseph5\n\nSTEPPING INTO MANAGEMENT .

Despite the relatively recent and signal contributions of Nehemiah Levtzion I and Richard Bulliet 2 who have advanced inno- va tive classificatory, methodological, and analytical strategies in the framework of comparative and more localized approaches toward Islamization, the complex of problems associated with conversion to Islam still has not drawn sufficient attention from specialists on all \"fronts\" of Islamization to allow a synthetic treatment of conversion to Islam from either a theoretical or historical perspective. 3 If old notions of forced conversion and the choice of \"Islam or the sword\" have been abandoned, at least in scholarly literature, little serious analytical work I. See above all the volume Conversion to Islam, ed. Nehemia Levtzion (New YorklLondon: Holmes & Meier Publishers, 1979), and Levtzion's contributions therein, \"Toward a Com- parative Study of Islamization\" (pp. 1-23) and \"Patterns of Islamization in West Africa\" (pp. 207-216), as well as his bibliography (pp. 247-265), in which Central and Inner Asia are pre- dictably poorly represented; cf. also his \"Conversion under Muslim Domination: A Comparative Study,\" in Religious Change and Cultural Domination, ed. D. N. Lorenzen (Mexico City: El Colegio de Mexico, 1981), pp. 19-38. 2. See his seminal work, Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979), and more recently his \"Process and Status in Conversion and Continuity,\" introducing Conversion and Continuity: Indigenous Christian Communities in Islamic Lands Eighth to Eighteenth Centuries, ed. Michael Gervers and Ramzi Jibran Bikhazi (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1990), pp. 1-12, and his \"Conversion Stories in Early Islam\" in the same volume (pp. 123-133). 3. For important theoretical considerations on conversion to Islam in historical surveys see, for example, Marshall Hodgson's The Venture of Islam, vol. 2 (The Expansion of Islam in the 18 Islamization and Native Religion has been done as a means of replacing older models and assumptions of how Islam was adopted and appropriated in specific contexts; nor, in general, have primary sources been tapped or reevaluated with an eye to the particular issue of Islamization.

The ultimate goal is to provide perfect value to the customer through a perfect value creation process that has zero waste. To accomplish this, lean thinking changes the focus of management from optimizing separate technologies, assets, and vertical departments to optimizing the flow of products and services through entire value streams that flow horizontally across technologies, assets, and departments to customers. Eliminating waste along entire value streams, instead of at isolated points, creates processes that need less human effort, less space, less capital, and less time to make products and services at far less costs and with much fewer defects, compared with traditional business systems. Companies are able to respond to changing customer desires with high variety, high quality, low cost, and with very fast throughput times. Also, information management becomes much simpler and more accurate. A popular misconception is that lean is suited only for manufacturing. Not true. Lean applies in every business and every process. It is not a tactic or a cost reduction program, but a way of thinking and acting for an entire organization. The term \"lean\" was coined to describe Toyota's business during the late 1980s by a research team headed by Jim Womack, Ph.D., at MIT's International Motor Vehicle Program. Mary Wrote: · What is the lean concept and why is it important to study? With fewer resources lean creates more value for customers. The idea of maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. Lean is important to study because there are so many benefits such as through lean there is a cost benefit. we can increase quality and reliability. Reduce operating costs, boost staff productivity and reduce the length of production cycles. · How can lean be applied to manufacturing and service processes? TOYOTA is the best example of a company that use lean processes and implement them. Toyota is the first major company to use lean ideology in their manufacturing processes. They have eliminated wasted and using techniques to get rid of faulty products that do not interest the customers. They use two processes, one is Jidoka and the other one is JIT or just in time. Jidoka is used to check the quality of the product and can stop the machines themselves down when there is an error. JIT/ just in time leads to the next step once the previous step is finished. https://www.lean.org/whatslean/ https://refinedimpact.com/4-good-examples-of-companies-that-use-lean-manufacturing/ Project Management Processes, Methodologies, and Economics Third Edition Avraham Shtub Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management The Technion–Israel Institute of Technology Moshe Rosenwein Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Columbia University Boston Columbus San Francisco New York Hoboken Indianapolis London Tor.\n\nStep 2 Grading Rubric EconomyTask descriptionComponents of .docx\n\nStep 2 Grading Rubric EconomyTask descriptionComponents of .docxrjoseph5\n\nStep 2 Grading Rubric: Economy Task description Components of the task Total points Major economic features Current demographic and economic features: What is the population of your country, its age and gender composition?

Step 3: Review Marketing Information on Consumer Buying Behavior · Read all attached step 3 documents to answer questions in step 4. · As you read through the following materials, begin to think about how this information will apply to the report you will prepare for Erik and Tarek. To successfully complete the report, you'll need an understanding of marketing. You’ll also benefit from a keen understanding of digital marketing, consumer buying behavior, and evaluating business attractiveness. · As you conduct your analysis of ACME's consumer environment, remember that there are two types of market research: primary and secondary research. Both types of research are required in real-life, and each of them has its pros and cons. However, for this Project, only secondary research is required. · Finally, to fully understand ACME's position, read about offerings—what a company provides its customers, be it a product, a service, or a mix of both. Also consider the differences between a product and a service. You know that a product can be more than just a physical good, it can be a service attached to a physical product, a \"pure\" service, an idea, a place, an organization, or even a person. · After you have read these materials, proceed to the next step, where you will begin your analysis of the specified consumer markets Step 4: Conduct a Consumer Buying Behavior Study As previously mentioned, I would like you to conduct an analysis of the consumers in our main markets. Your analysis should consider both current and potential product users and should address the following questions: · What needs are being met by the product purchase? What are the benefits to the consumers? Make sure that you differentiate between features and benefits; go beyond manifest motives and consider latent motives. · Who is involved in the purchase process? Who are the influencers? Who are the buyers? Who are the end users? · Where are the products sold, and what are the distribution channels? · How often are the products purchased? Is there seasonality to sales? I need you to produce a six-page preliminary consumer buying behavior report (excluding cover page, reference list, tables, graphs, and exhibits) explaining your findings on consumer needs, wants, and preferences in these markets. Make sure that your report is specific to consumers of ACME’s potential product and not to consumers in general. Step 5: Complete Your Value Proposition · I wanted to clarify that a customer-focused value proposition explains the reason why a customer purchases a product or uses a service (i.e., the value that a company delivers to its customers). · Deliverable: (complete this part separate from step 2-4) Based on your research of consumer needs in our main markets, describe your value proposition, or the benefits that ACME and its potential new product would provide to customers.
