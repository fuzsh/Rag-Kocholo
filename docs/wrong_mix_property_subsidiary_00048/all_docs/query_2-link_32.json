        "text": "OAK PARK, Mich., July 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Bollinger Motors, Inc., an electric commercial vehicle (\"EV\") manufacturer, today announces it has named former GM executive James Taylor as CEO. He will take over for company founder Robert Bollinger, who will remain on the company’s Board of Directors and a major shareholder.\n\nIn addition, the company promoted Bryan Chambers to President and Chief Operating Officer and Siva Kumar to Chief Strategy Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance.\n\n“The leadership changes position Bollinger Motors for continued success, as these three executives have, and will continue to have, a profound impact on our trajectory,” Bollinger said. “I have benefitted from my collaboration with Jim and his deep industry experience. Now is the right time, and Jim is the right person, to build on our momentum and get Bollinger to its ultimate goal.”\n\nTaylor has worked closely with Robert Bollinger to bring the company’s all-electric Bollinger B4 Class 4 Chassis Cab to market. Taylor is a veteran automotive executive who has held leadership positions with Cadillac and Hummer, and has deep electric vehicle experience with Electric Last Mile Solutions, Workhorse, Karma, SF Motors and Mullen Automotive for the last two years.\n\n“I am grateful and excited for this opportunity to continue moving Bollinger Motors toward a leadership role in the electric vehicle industry,” Taylor said. “Robert and his team have done an incredible job of creating a world-class electric truck with the Bollinger B4, and the upcoming Bollinger B5. The response from the market has been very encouraging and we are well-positioned to disrupt the Class 4 trucking market.”\n\nChambers has over 35 years in automotive leadership and joined Bollinger Motors in 2018 as Program Director and rose to Chief Operating Officer. Prior to Bollinger Motors, Chambers operated Chambers Services, LLC, a manufacturing consulting firm. He also has held positions with Alternative Automotive Technologies, Saleen, MSX International and Allied Signal.\n\nKumar joined Bollinger Motors in 2022 as Chief Financial Officer.

He also has held positions with Skanda Capital, Ford Motor Company, Meritor and Tenneco Automotive.\n\nBollinger Motors plans to launch the Bollinger B4 Chassis Cab in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe vehicle is an all-new, battery-electric, zero-emissions Class 4 commercial truck designed from the ground up with extensive fleet and upfitter input. Bollinger’s unique chassis design protects the 800-volt battery and components to offer unparalleled capability, flexibility and performance in the commercial market. Bollinger Motors recently qualified for federal clean vehicle purchasing incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides $40,000 in refundable tax credits per truck.\n\nBollinger Motors has reached several milestones in recent months, including: receiving the Certificate of Conformity from the Environmental Protection Agency; an 80 vehicle sale to Momentum Groups; a 50 vehicle sale to EnviroCharge; the addition of Nacarato Truck Centers, Nuss Truck & Equipment, and LaFontaine Auto Group as dealers and service centers; Our Next Energy in Novi, Michigan, to supply battery packs; Roush Industries in Livonia, Michigan, to manage vehicle assembly operations; Syncron as its warranty administration partner; and Amerit Fleet Solutions as its mobile service provider.\n\nABOUT BOLLINGER MOTORS\n\nFounded in 2015 by Robert Bollinger, Bollinger Motors, Inc. is a U.S.-based company headquartered in Oak Park, Michigan.
