        "text": "Episode: Shiva, Episode 10.12.\n\nAir Date: January 15, 2013.\n\nThe Victim: Mostly the same as last episode. Except for…well, that would be telling.\n\nEmotionally Traumatized, But Ultimately Irrelevant, Witness Who Finds the Body: Time for a recap…[watches recap]…and now the conclusion…\n\nWe start with a flashback to a young Ziva lighting Shabbat candles and singing the blessing, while a young(er) Eli looks on. A woman and a young boy and young girl can be seen from behind.\n\nWe flash forward to adult Ziva singing the same prayer. She is in a synagogue, talking to God, and asking why she should not be angry with Him. She asks for a sign that she should not lose hope. She senses someone and pulls her gun part way out of its holster. But it’s just Tony. He had McGee track her down since she wasn’t answering her cell. She asks what he wants. He wants whatever she wants and to give her whatever she needs, including a shoulder to cry on. Ziva says she’s done crying, but Tony offers his condolences all the same. She appreciates it but doesn’t want sympathy. Tony steps forward and asks what she needs. She says, “Revenge.”\n\nYeah, he’ll be happy to help with that.\n\nPlot Recap: SecNav is on the phone with the President in Vance’s office. He gets off and reports to Gibbs that State won’t tell Israel what happened for 48 hours and Gibbs can have what he needs to track down the masterminds behind the killing of Eli David and Jackie Vance. Gibbs already has an idea where to start.\n\nSecNav is pissed that he didn’t know Eli was in the US. But Gibbs doesn’t report to SecNav so that’s not his problem. What is his, and everybody else’s, problem, is that if this gets out, there are going to be accusations of murder worldwide and the situation could destabilize quickly and terribly. Gibbs tells SecNav that events will be kept under wraps until the case is solved.\n\nSecNav asks if Gibbs has talked to Vance. Gibbs has not. Gibbs reports that the assistant director is on his way back to the US. SecNav seems uncertain as to whether Assistant Director Craig is up to the task of filling Vance’s shoes. Gibbs thinks he’ll have to be.\n\nIn autopsy, Ducky places Jackie Vance’s body in a freezer and tells her to rest in peace. Gibbs arrives and asks if Ducky is alright. Ducky doesn’t turn and grimly reports that COD was a single gunshot through Jackie’s temporal lobe. Director David is in a separate freezer while Ducky awaits further instructions.\n\nThat’s not what Gibbs asked, though. Ducky has had better days and asks about Gibbs. Gibbs deflects and asks about the shooter. Ducky IDs the COD as the cyanide we saw the perp take last episode. He still has no identification. Gibbs says McGee isn’t having much luck. Ducky wonders if the killer’s medical condition will help: he had numerous liver tumors, wasn’t undergoing treatment, and would have been dead in six months.\n\nVance came to work. SecNav doesn’t think he should be there. But Vance has things he needs to get and…oh…there’s a man at his desk. It’s Assistant Director Craig. There’s some awkwardness, but Craig tries his best to convey his condolences. While on the road in Belgium, he bought some chocolates for Jackie Vance, per her standing request, before he heard she died. He asks about the kids and Vance is a bit of a jerk about it, but you give grieving people a break. SecNav ends the discomfort by diplomatically expelling Craig. Vance does the right thing, though and thanks Craig.\n\nSecNav and Vance argue about whether Vance can keep working. It’s not entirely clear if SecNav is being paternalistic or if there are protocols in place for either benching grieving directors or benching Directors who have a personal stake in the investigation. I mean, yes, those personal interest protocols certainly exist in the real world, but NCIS waives them all the time on this show. Either way, the best SecNav can do is offer to keep Vance in the loop.\n\nCraig, meanwhile, is outside seeking sympathy for his Belgian chocolate bit from Gibbs of all people. Gibbs lets him babble but doesn’t go out of his way to make him comfortable. Even though Craig says that Jackie was always nice to him because she seemed to sense it was challenging working for Vance (translation: I hate my boss) and that he has no intention of taking Vance’s job (translation: I have every intention of taking my boss’s job because I hate him). He also alludes to Gibbs having pre-existing (translation: wholly negative) opinions about Craig’s management style. Gibbs lets that go for now. He says he has Craig’s back and cuts off the weird pity party.\n\nYeah, Craig is one of those permanently socially awkward, passive aggressive guys. This will go well.\n\nTony returns to the squad room and McGee asks after Ziva. Tony says she went home to shower. Gibbs walks by and snaps at Tony for allowing this. He says Ziva is not to be alone until they know she’s not a target.\n\nAlthough, based on the show’s history, she’s safer alone than being protected by an NCIS security detail.\n\nMcGee has managed to ID the shooter through Interpol. He’s Roland Ames, and he’s not Iranian or Palestinian. He’s Swedish and was an officer with the Swedish Special Forces before abandoning his regiment during the Iraq War. He has been a mercenary since 2007, with no allegiances beyond who’s paying the bill. Gibbs details Ames’s health condition and then figures a guy like that doesn’t go for the one last score unless he has someone to leave the money to. McGee goes to work on locating Ames’s nearest and dearest.\n\nGibbs wants them to hold off. They need to locate Kazmi, the Iranian security service head from last episode, who has disappeared from his hotel. But, McGee gave Gibbs a tracking device at one point last year, and Gibbs slipped it in Kazmi’s coat pocket. McGee smiles but Gibbs tempers his elation with a “Damn thing better work.”\n\nLooks like Kazmi is in Georgetown. On foot. Gibbs will handle. He tells the boys to keep tracking the money and to check in with their friends in Israel.\n\nZiva arrives in the lab, and Abby hugs her and gives her condolences. Ziva and Abby commiserate over her father’s death currently being a state secret and the fact that Ziva has to behave as if he is alive and well.\n\nZiva would like to view the evidence, but Abby takes down the screen and invokes the personal involvement protocols that NCIS haphazardly enforces whenever the script calls for it. Or at least operates such that agents are never punished for violating said protocols. Eitehr way, the company line is that Ziva and Vance are not to be involved in the case. But Ziva is asking a favor from a friend. Abby says there’s nothing to tell. The forensics were so unremarkable that the shooter could have gotten his rounds anywhere.\n\nUm…dude had a machine gun.\n\nBack to Gibbs, who is canvassing Georgetown and finds his new Iranian friend. Kazmi is understandably concerned that being seen talking to a US federal agent might not be so great for his health. Gibbs suggests not talking to one also might not be so great for his health. Kazmi subtly waves off his bodyguards. Kazmi at least plays like he doesn’t know about Eli and suggests that Gibbs’s cowboy diplomacy will upset their efforts. Gibbs takes him into an alley, jacks him up against the wall, and pulls his gun. Gibbs pretends like Eli is missing, rather than dead, to keep the secret. But, Kazmi sees that something is being withheld. That stays Gibbs’s aggression somewhat. He says, “Not here.”\n\nSomehow, Gibbs has managed to get Kazmi back to interrogation. Iranian security details must be about as good as NCIS’. They discuss Eli’s death and Kazmi is shocked and vehemently denies involvement. Kazmi says he is the one who approached Eli about peace overtures. Gibbs suggests a set-up. Kazmi is adamant and says he can prove it. He will have Iranian intel sent to Gibbs on any relevant suspects. Kazmi and Eli had too many enemies, and he could be next. Gibbs suggests letting Kazmi walk and doing the world a favor when someone picks him off. Kazmi wonders what choice Gibbs has but to trust him.\n\nIn MTAC, Tony and McGee are talking to Gavriella Adel in Israel. They seem to have a history with her, but we don’t, as this is her first appearance. She likes McGee and calls him “Timmy.” She’s less enthused by Tony, calls him Special Agent DiNozzo, and covers herself more when he appears from the shadows. The boys subtly inquire as to Eli’s whereabouts, but the best Gavi has is the rumor that Eli went to visit Ziva. While Eli is always under threat, the biggest noisemakers right now are a pro-Palestinian organization called First Wave that has had it in for Eli and Mossad for years. It’s funded by a billionaire named Gustafson. McGee notes the Swedish ring.\n\nBack in the squad room, Tony tells McGee that if he doesn’t make time with Gavi, Tony will never forgive him. McGee says she’s a spy and flirting is in the toolkit. Tony thinks it’s the real deal.\n\nGibbs doesn’t care. So, Tony reports that Gavi gave them a lead. McGee reports that the Swedish consulate identified Ames as having an ex-wife and a son living in town in Sweden, and a bank account that got $20 million krona richer three hours after the shooting. Just over $3 million U.S.\n\nTony thinks it could have come from Dwayne Gustafson, the heir to a Texas oil fortune with a lot of Middle Eastern ties. He’s currently in DC meeting with lobbyists. Gibbs says to pick him up.\n\nTony has Gustafson in interrogation. Gibbs and Craig watch in observation. At Gustafson’s request, Tony cuts to the chase. He asks about First Wave and their threats against Eli David. Gustafson says to ask them, and he’s just a loyal contributor. Tony calls him the only contributor and that might be enough to call the shots. Gustafson admits he has business ties in the Middle East. And he admits those ties would be a lot tighter without the Eli Davids of the world slowing progress (whatever that means- sounds vaguely anti-Semitic). But Gustafson denies violence. And also tries to deny anti-Semitism, but in the way that quietly admits it. He claims that his issues with Israel are neither personal nor political and are strictly business and says, “Hell, my own attorney’s a Jew.”\n\nYeeahhh….\n\nAnyway, Gustafson figures he could use his attorney and makes ready to end the interview. When Vance enters, radiating rage. Tony is not comfortable. Vance would like to know how Gustafson feels about collateral damage and, more specifically, how he would feel if his hatred for one person spilled over and cost the life of an innocent person. Gustafson has no idea what Vance is talking about, so Vance takes a step forward. Tony rises to intercept and we see Craig walk quickly out of observation. Craig appears in the door and subtly says he needs Vance’s help with something. He even says “Please.” Vance looks dangerously at Gustafson, but leaves. Tony tells Gustafson to make his phone call.\n\nThen he joins the men in the hall. Craig is excusing the behavior. Vance isn’t buying it. Gibbs wants to move the talk down the hall. But then Craig announces that, per SecNav, he is asking Vance to take administrative leave until further notice. Adding insult to injury, he says that agents will escort Vance back to his hotel. Vance nods, mutely.\n\nZiva is in a darkened autopsy, staring at her father’s drawer. Ducky appears and offers to open the drawer. Ziva declines, but needs her father’s remains released as soon as possible, per Jewish tradition, so she can take him home. Ducky sympathizes, and says he’ll do his best.\n\nGibbs arrives and summarily ejects Ziva. Tony says to go to his place. Ziva says she has her own place, but Gibbs won’t let her go there or stay at NCIS. Until they find out who did this. Ducky takes Gibbs’s side. Ziva thinks she can help and says she’s fine. Gibbs tells her to go be fine elsewhere.\n\nTony lets Ziva into his place. Tony offers to go to Ziva’s place and get her things. Ziva says she is going to bury her father in Israel and thus thinks she won’t be at Tony’s place long. Tony wants her to talk, but she’s not into it. He gives her the bed and he has an inflatable mattress. She asks about the couch, and Tony says it’s occupied. And then Ziva’s friend Shmeil appears from the next room and says, “There’s my Ziva.” She hugs him. And thanks Tony for tracking him down.\n\nAwwwww.\n\nAbby and Ducky visit McGee. McGee says Gustafson has lawyered up and Gibbs’s gut doesn’t like him as a suspect. McGee doesn’t either.\n\nA man named Ilan Bodnar enters the room. He introduces himself as Mossad’s Deputy Director and he is looking for Ziva and, by extension, Eli. He wants answers. Ducky laughs and tells him to take a number. Bodnar bristles and asks whose grandfather Ducky is. Ducky says, “That depends. Who’s your grandmother?” and swipes this blog’s MVP with such sudden speed that I’m dizzy. If you were thinking Bodnar got lucky enough to encounter the B-Team while all the aggro agents are out, you’re not thinking it anymore. Bodnar decides he doesn’t want any more of that, and asks the location of the man in charge. McGee, taking a cue from Ducky, steps up, and tells Bodnar he’ll have to wait. But Bodnar holds a hole card and says he’s there at the invitation of SecNav. McGee, knowing his pay grade, and being conscientious enough to want to avoid an international incident, tells Abby to call Gibbs.\n\nTony can’t sleep. He gets up to get something out of the fridge and hears whimpering from Ziva’s room. He wakes her from her nightmare, and she wakes aggressively. But she does not try to shoot him. See Recoil, Episode 5.16. She pats him but then asks him to leave her alone.\n\nCraig and Gibbs are meeting with Bodnar and briefing him on Eli’s death. Bodnar thinks that Mossad will handle retribution and that NCIS can get out of the way. Craig breaks the bad news that SecNav, the US President and the Israeli PM have all agreed that NCIS running point on the investigation is the best way to prevent war. Although Israel can prosecute. Gibbs backs Craig’s play. Bodnar makes no promises.\n\nGibbs meets the Vance family at church. Vance sends the kids away. Vance is frustrated that he can’t give his kids the real story. Gibbs, maybe with some perspective in light of his past, says details won’t make it any easier. Vance fishes a little. But Gibbs has nothing to tell.\n\nVance says one thing has surprised him. He now better understands Gibbs’s choices. He says he thought he had a sense of how Gibbs felt when his wife and daughter were murdered. Hiatus, Part One, Episode 3.23. Now he realizes he wasn’t even close. Vance says he never wanted that kind of justice before, but now it’s all he thinks about. He asks Gibbs if it was worth it and says it had to be some relief. Gibbs looks over at the saddened Vance kids. And he doesn’t have to say anything else.\n\nVance leaves it to Gibbs to “Get these bastards.” He says “Jackie wouldn’t have wanted war breaking out over this either. And if we let that happen, she dies in vain.” Gibbs promises, “She won’t.”\n\nZiva is still at Tony’s, working the computer. Tony shuts it and wants to know what she’s doing. Since it impacts his security detail, he feels entitled. Ziva was emailing contacts in Israel, and says Bodnar, whom she describes as her father’s protégé, is in the US looking for her. Tony says that Bodnar knows the truth. Ziva is mad Tony didn’t tell her. They fight over Ziva being kept away from the investigation. Especially because Bodnar is presumptuous about fancying himself a son to Eli and it chaps her ass that Eli’s true blood is not out seeking vengeance for his death.\n\nAt NCIS, McGee tells Gibbs that they’re still tracking Ames’s payment. But Abby is there, and she announces that the bullets Ames used are Russian by way of Sweden. These slugs were taken from a batch seized in Sweden from a smuggler- an Iranian national named Omeed Abbasi and one of the region’s most prolific arms dealer. Gibbs asks if Abbasi is in the intel from Kazmi. He is not. So Gibbs leaves.\n\nSomehow Gibbs has gotten Kazmi back in interrogation. Kazmi knows Abbasi, of course. He has been on the run for years. Gibbs wants to know why Abbasi isn’t in the file. Kazmi calls it an oversight. Gibbs is short on trust. Kazmi claims he has no motivation to protect Abbasi, who has as much motivation to kill Kazmi as to kill Eli. Peace, after all, is bad for munitions smugglers.\n\nGibbs joins Craig in observation. Craig believes Kazmi. Gibbs doesn’t think he’s behind this either. McGee interrupts to say that company is coming.\n\nGibbs and Craig follow McGee back up to the squad room. Bodnar is there. He calls Gibbs and Craig liars for not telling him about the real reason for Eli’s visit. Bodnar thinks Kazmi tricked Eli into believing in a ridiculous pipe dream of peace. Gibbs says he doesn’t discuss investigations with outsiders. Craig fucks up at this point and lets on that NCIS has Kazmi. So now Bodnar is off to call his PM and if NCIS harboring Kazmi means war, then that’s on NCIS.\n\nThat’s supposed to be tense, but even in this show’s less nuanced world, Israel isn’t declaring war on the US. Bodnar’s posturing falls completely flat from a narrative standpoint.\n\nAt Tony’s, Ziva sees that Tony’s computer has, well, what would now be a Zoom call. But what, in 2012, was a weird monitor call that most people only saw on TV and in movies. She answers and Bodnar’s face appears on the screen. Bodnar needs to see her. Ziva has no interest in seeing him and cites the rules (rules she would break if she gave two shits about this dude). So, he threatens to find her. We don’t see her response.\n\nInstead, we head back to Kazmi, who is on the phone in the conference room. He reports that his assistant, whom he trusts, swears Abbasi was in the file. But there was a six-hour time lapse between the file being transmitted and its arrival. So it was intercepted. Gibbs mentions Bodnar. Kazmi is unimpressed and says all Bodnar learned from Eli was how to be suspicious of everyone.\n\nGibbs gets a call and joins McGee. Who reports that the money to Ames’s wife was handled by a bank in the Caymans. The account from which the money was wired is a secure family trust labeled Virtue. Tony calls Ziva and Gibbs asks about “Virtue” and whether it has significance as a proper noun. They go through some permutations and settle on the Hebrew translation, which is “tohar.” And which also happens to be Bodnar’s middle name. Ziva says Bodnar is on his way to Tony’s. Gibbs and Tony get moving while McGee is to go to Bodnar’s hotel with back-up. Tony tells Ziva where he has another gun.\n\nZiva is armed and waiting. Gibbs and Tony crash through the door and almost die. But Ziva restrains herself. She says Bodnar never showed. Gibbs asks Ziva if she is OK, and she doesn’t know. Her father trusted Bodnar. Tony checks in with McGee. Bodnar is in the wind.\n\nSecNav, Gibbs, and Craig brief Kazmi. Mossad says Bodnar acted alone and they’re looking for him too. Bodnar hired the hitman but when Ames killed himself, Bodnar came to finish the job: pin the killing on Kazmi, take out Ziva, take over Mossad. Kazmi knew their meeting could be dangerous. He hopes Eli can be remembered for seeking piece. Craig offers to have a car take Kazmi to the airport, but Kazmi says he will find his way.\n\nAs he exits. Gibbs compliments Kazmi’s bravery. Kazmi says their worlds are different, but their goals are the same.\n\nWe join Kazmi in his car. He is being driven by his detail and talking on the phone. He says he’ll be home soon. He leans back in his seat to ponder while his car is stopped at a red light. Then the car explodes.\n\nIt’s still night, and Ziva is at the airport. Shmeil walks over and reports that they have loaded her father on a plane. She tells Shmeil to board and she’ll be along. Shmeil tells her to take her time. And that someone has come to see her off.\n\nTony arrives. She says he did not have to come. Tony says she always forgets her gum and magazines when she flies. He assures her they’ll find Bodnar. He also tells her not to do this…perhaps because he thinks she’s leaving. She says she is going to her father’s funeral and delivering his eulogy. She says her father was not an easy man to understand, and he says “Complicated” runs in the family. She says, “Tony, I…” then she hesitates. He says, “What?” Then she pulls him into a hug. It looks like a goodbye hug. A real one. You can tell from his face that it feels like one too. He says, “Aht lo leh-vahd,” which the internet tells me means, “You are not alone.” “I know,” she whispers back.\n\nTony watches her walk away. Then he turns and walks away too. And we get an aerial shot of them walking away from each other.\n\nWhich takes us to a cemetery. The team is attending Jackie’s funeral. We see the agents, and Abby and Ducky, and Craig and the Vance family. And we see Gibbs, standing in back.\n\nAn acoustic song by a female vocalist plays. The chorus is “You are not alone.” And we see intercut scenes of Ziva picking olives, presumably in the grove where Eli and Kazim played so long ago.\n\nVance takes his kids over to Jackie’s grave, and they throw roses onto her coffin. He kisses them both and puts his arms around them.\n\nNow we’re at the Wailing Wall in old Jerusalem. Ziva puts a written prayer into the cracks and says her own prayers.\n\nThe funeral crowd begins to disperse, with our friends perhaps thinking they’ve been to far too many of these. Craig and Gibbs are talking and Vance joins. He and Craig shake hands and Craig excuses himself.\n\nZiva appears to be plating an olive tree. Maybe at the Israeli-Palestinian border. We end with her staring off into the distance.\n\nQuotables:\n\n(1) “Pity does not validate cowardice.”\n\n-Ducky is in a mood.\n\n(2) Ziva: You should have knocked.\n\nTony: I live here.\n\nZiva: And you almost died here.\n\n-Ziva is a saucy houseguest.\n\nZiva-propisms: None. That would be insensitive.\n\nTony Awards: Tony keeps a gun in the toilet, Godfather-style. He describes Ziva’s friend as “Shmeil the man of steel,” a reference to Superman. He quotes Frank Sinatra’s My Way.\n\nAbby Road: Abby makes cookies in the lab. The smell cheers people up.\n\nMcNicknames: McBlivious. McFever.\n\nDucky Tales: Ducky lays out a list of cowards who took their lives rather than being captured, including most of the Nazis the average person can name.\n\nThe Rest of the Story:\n\n-The young boy in the flashback is Ari Haswari, dead by Ziva’s hand/gun. Kill Ari, Part Two, Episode 3.2. The girl is Tali, killed as a child in a terrorist attack, first mentioned in Kill Ari, Part Two, Episode 3.2. Tali was last referenced in Shellshock, Part Two, Episode 10.7. I’m not sure how the mom died, but she left ole’ Eli when she realized what a monster he was. See the flashback in Enemies Domestic, Episode 8.9. Point is, Ziva is the last of her line now.\n\n-Ducky is very respectful of cultural funerary rites, as we learned in Tribes, Episode 5.11.\n\n-I can’t track down when McGee gave Gibbs a bug/tracking device. Eagle-eyed viewers will note that Gibbs did hand Kazmi his coat last episode.\n\n-Tony borrowed an inflatable mattress from the woman across the hall “who had the…with…never mind.” He’s referring to the time his father shtupped his neighbor in Tony’s bed. You Better Watch Out, episode 10.10.\n\nWe met the grandfatherly Shmeil in Gone, Episode 10.8. He has known Ziva since she was three.\n\n-As much as American “good guy/bad guy” shows have as a theme the idea that revenge isn’t something the good guys can or should take without consequences, Life Before His Eyes, Episode 9.14 made the point, admittedly somewhat subtly, that Gibbs’s revenge killing of Pedro Hernandez was both right and necessary. Although, since most of the episode happened in Gibbs’s head, there’s an argument that it wasn’t reliably narrated.\n\nMore to the point, Vance isn’t Gibbs. Vance is still a parent. It’s highly unlikely Gibbs would have opened an eternal sunset into Pedro’s spotted mind if Kelly Gibbs had survived her mother.\n\n-Rule #8: Never take anything for granted.\n\n-Ilan Bodnar will return.\n\nCasting Call: Assistant Director Craig is Greg Germann. I barely watched Ally McBeal, but I watched a lot of Ally McBeal commercials during Fox NFL broadcasts in the late 90s, and I will always associate Germann with his role on that show.\n\nMan, This Show Is Old: Nothing stands out.\n\nMVP: Ducky with the shade.\n\nRating: This is a great episode. Even re-reading and editing this entry, I was moved several times. The whole episode feels like an extended funeral. Tony coming up big by delivering Shmeil is a legit tear-jerker moment. Vance getting personal and emotional insight into Gibbs’s past decisions is well-played. Cote de Pablo expertly plays Ziva’s muted but murderous intensity combined with her sadness. And who can’t relate to losing a loved one that one is not even sure one liked. Finally, the ending, flipping between Ziva’s mourning in Israel and Jackie’s funeral, was well developed. Great episode. Nine Palmers.\n\nNext Time: An Abby origin story and some Hatfield/McCoy-style family drama. Or Montague/Capulet-style family drama if you’re fancy.\n\nShameless Plugs:\n\n–A Year of NCIS has a Facebook page.\n\n–If you like what you read, please share with friends.\n\n-If you enjoy this blog, please keep me in mind for contract writing work.
