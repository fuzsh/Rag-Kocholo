        "text": "HP Inc. has announced two new innovations — a high performance AI PC1 and the first integration of a trust framework into an AI model development platform.2\n\nBoth announcements expand HP’s efforts to make AI real for companies and people with new and transformative AI experiences across the company’s PCs, software, and partner ecosystem.\n\nHP is empowering everyone, from corporate knowledge workers to freelancers and students, to unlock the power of AI. Users can connect with anyone in the world with real time translation to 40 languages, become master presenters with their personal communication coach, and quickly create videos like a pro.\n\n“AI is poised to be the most significant driver of change over the next decade, ushering in a new era of innovation driven not just by information, but actionable insights”, said Alex Cho, President, Personal Systems, HP Inc. “HP is making AI real for companies with solutions like Z by HP AI Studio, for places and spaces with our latest hybrid work solutions, and for people with our first HP OmniBook Ultra”.\n\nEmpowering Companies to Build and Use AI\n\nToday, only 33% of data scientists are satisfied with their current AI tools, and 81% lack confidence in their company’s ability to quickly deploy those tools[iii] — underscoring the urgent need for solutions that can rapidly transform business operations.\n\nAnnounced earlier this year, HP is adding new capabilities to the Z by HP AI Studio for faster and safer deployment of AI-powered applications, building trust into LLM development and customization. As the world’s most comprehensive workstation solution for AI development,[iv] Z by HP AI Studio is now empowering data scientists and AI creators to create models they trust with the integration of Galileo into Z by HP AI Studio. Users will be able to detect and correct hallucinations, drift, and bias in their models, while proactively protecting against inaccurate or biased outputs—all within the AI Studio platform. With this added capability, HP is the only manufacturer to develop an AI platform for workstations with built-in generative AI trust for LLM development. 2\n\n“Allowing businesses to leverage their proprietary data without compromising security is critical for AI development, and Galileo is proud to join forces with HP to deliver solutions that add visibility, control, and trust to enterprise generative AI projects”, said Yash Sheth, Co-Founder & COO, Galileo. “By integrating our software and Luna™ Evaluation Foundation Models with Z by HP’s AI Studio, we are delivering unparalleled value for organisations seeking to responsibly harness the transformative power of AI”.\n\nExperiencing AI on HP PCs\n\nAn Unconstrained AI Playground: The HP OmniBook Ultra\n\nAs new possibilities are unlocked daily with AI, consumers on the bleeding edge of AI revolution have a new tool in the toolbox to run workloads faster, customize models, and maintain privacy – all locally on the device.\n\nMeet the first HP OmniBook Ultra 14-inch Next Gen AI PC. This device:\n\nInspires without compromise: Unleash endless creativity with the device’s AMD Ryzen™ AI 300 series processor with integrated AMD Radeon™ 800M graphics.[v] Its powerful NPU[vi] offers unparalleled performance and up to 21 hours of battery life.[vii]\n\nSupercharges productivity: The OmniBook Ultra is co-engineered with AMD to enable up to 55 TOPS of NPU performance. HP AI Companion optimizes the device for greater productivity and brings AI tools and solutions onto the device. [viii] It will soon offer expanded functionality for managing PC settings and troubleshooting HP products.\n\nEnables immersive and seamless collaboration: Experience life uninterrupted with collaboration tools like an AI-enabled, high-resolution 9 MP camera using the Poly Camera Pro app and Windows Studio Effects.[ix]\n\nProtects from threats: Industry-leading protection and capabilities of Wolf Security found on HP’s commercial devices are now available on the HP OmniBook Ultra. The unique security chip allows the PC’s core to self-heal from AI-assisted cyberattacks while keeping data private and users productive.\n\nFuture-proofed technology that’s sustainable: The OmniBook Ultra will have a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available from Microsoft.[x] And the device is designed using up to 90% recycled metals and 5% ocean-bound plastics to help reduce environmental impact.[xi]\n\nAI That Adapts: The OmniStudio X AIO\n\nFor consumers who need a performant all-in-one device for both creation and entertainment, the first HP OmniStudio X 27- and 31.5-inch All-In-One Desktop PCs deliver a sleek modern design with built-in AI features:\n\nProductivity powerhouse: Experience the raw power of the device’s three engines (CPU, GPU, and NPU) to accelerate AI applications. Create and collaborate like never before with up to Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 processors and optional NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4050 GPU (6 GB GDDR6 dedicated) to best optimize intensive workflows like photo and video editing.\n\nAdaptable design: Productivity and entertainment have never been more customizable on the world’s most adaptive AI All-in-One[xii] with its height-adjustable stand and new USB Type-C with DP-in/out. The USB-C connection supports video, audio, data, keyboard, and mouse control, and it can be used as a laptop docking station to take advantage of the large display. Its AI-powered wellness features like screen time and distance reminders help reduce fatigue. Presence sensing adds additional privacy and peace of mind whether working at home or in open spaces.\n\nEntertain and collaborate: With its massive 4K screen, 5 MP camera, Poly Studio audio, and Adaptive audio, the HP OmniStudio X 31.5 is the world’s most immersive experience AI All-in-One[xiii] and the first All-in-One to receive an IMAX Enhanced certification[xiv] for the ultimate visual and sound experience.\n\nSustainability in any size: Little things make a big difference with the OmniStudio X AIO, which uses 25% recycled metals and 35% post-consumer recycled plastics. It also has EPEAT® Gold with Climate+ and ENERGY STAR® certifications.[xv]\n\nExplore the Possibilities of AI with the Latest Software Ecosystem\n\nHP is also working closely with the rapidly growing ecosystem of software developers building powerful AI solutions for consumers and businesses. As part of this effort, Beautiful.ai and Polymer will supercharge productivity, and Luminar Neo will accelerate creative editing – all part of future updates to HP AI Companion. HP is also collaborating with Omnibridge, Loccus.ai, and Virtual Sapiens to deliver easier, seamless, and accessible experiences with AI on HP AI PCs.\n\nFor more information, visit https://www.hp.com/us-en/newsroom/press-kits/2024/hp-imagine-ai.html.\n\n[i] AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series Processor sku 55 TOPS NPU available in September of 2024.\n\n[ii] HP internal analysis based on all Next Gen AI PCs in the market as of July 2024.
