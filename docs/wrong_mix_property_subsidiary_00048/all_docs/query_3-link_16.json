        "text": "537\n\nOn Tuesday, the Richmond City Council voted 5-0 to divest from companies who do business in Israel.\n\nUltimately, Richmond as $600 million to invest and this ordinance would impact about 6.9% of their portfolio. Under the policy, the City of Richmond created a predetermined list of companies that are involved in Israel’s violation of Palestinian rights.\n\nThese include:\n\nAirbnb\n\nCaterpillar and Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation\n\nCisco\n\nDell\n\nFirst Solar Inc.\n\nIntel Corporation\n\nInternal Business Machines Corporation (IBM)\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nMotorola Solutions\n\nWix.com\n\nPrior to the discussion, Mayor Eduardo Martinez shared, “we all have a conscious, for some of us that conscious is activated right away. For the rest of us, it takes time to catch up. I want to honor those who have been resisting this genocide for 29-weeks in Gaza and around the world. So many young people have put their lives, their bodies, livelihood on the line to voice their resistance to what is happening.”\n\nHe shared the city has tools available to them to allow them to act on their conscious, by then sharing stories and accounts of what is going on in Gaza,\n\n“I do not believe our city should profit in any way from companies who facilitate this kind of violence,” stated Martinez. “This is not only in Gaza, but any other place in the world. We need to do ethical investing. We need to be socially conscious in how we spend our money and where our money goes to… our monies should be used to build societies, not destroy it.”\n\nThe council then received its presentation.\n\nRichmond, however, has taken a stance in the past, having an ordinance related to the Apartheid in South Africa and in 1984, created an ordinance not to purchase goods or services from South Africa (Ordinance 10-86).\n\nAccording to staff, the first question they received was could the City of Richmond mimic what the City of Hayward did. Staff explained they Hayward does direct investment, as Richmond does local agency funds and CalTrust, local agencies participate in a State portfolio (a big pool of money) – Richmond is 1 of 475 cities that invest in LAIF .\n\nUnder the proposed Changes:\n\nNew Restriction 1: It is the City’s policy not to invest in a predetermined list of companies and their subsidiaries that are involved in Israel’s violations of Palestinian rights.\n\nNew Restriction 2: It is the City’s policy not to invest in companies and their subsidiaries involved in the development and manufacturing of arms and weapons.\n\nThis restriction would encompass companies involved in the arms and weapons manufacturing industries, who develop and manufacture such items as:\n\nAll forms of munitions.\n\nArtillery systems.\n\nFighter jets, attack helicopters, warplanes, and warships.\n\nFirearms and accessories (scopes, sights).\n\nMilitary robots.\n\nMissiles.\n\nMilitary and commercial drones.\n\nSoftware that supports drones and missiles systems (such as control actuation systems).\n\nTactical body gear/body armor.\n\nTactical, military, and armored vehicles; tank transporters.\n\nNew Restriction 3: It is the City’s policy not to invest in companies and their subsidiaries that are involved in the border and mass surveillance industries\n\nNew Restriction 4: It is the City’s policy not to invest in companies and their subsidiaries that are involved in the mass incarceration and detention industries, nor those companies that use prison labor to manufacture products.\n\nPublic Comments\n\nA total of 34 in person speakers and 30 speakers online given 2-minutes to speak.\n\nCouncil Discussion\n\nMartinez shared he believed this was an item focused on “responsible investment” and they have a president who warned everyone about the industrial military complex which needs war to make profits.\n\n“As long as they continue to promote war, they continue to make profits,” stated Martinez noting a missile costs $20 million to make which does not count the destruction it makes. “We have people who are invested in war and they don’t care about you or me and all they care about is profit. This divestment is to break that chain so we can begin to invest in people and not in war, missiles or destruction.”\n\nCouncilmember Claudia Jimenez called Richmond a diverse city and the council needs to recognize all of the community. Noting that Palestinian residents are experience pain and suffering and they belong in the community.\n\n“We are using the local power that we have to speak up against this horror,” stated Jimenez. “This item is very clear because its about showing with actions and values… we are showing with this local action that we value life, we value immigrant residents, or residents who are coming home or deserve a second chance. We chose to condemn wars. The time is calling us to now not to be complacent with genocide.”\n\nCouncilmember Cesar Zepeda agreed that they should be divesting away from anything war or oppression which all goes counter to what they should be doing as humans.\n\nHe also questioned why the City of Richmond was discussing divesting versus no longer purchasing things.\n\nStaff suggested that Zepeda was essentially calling for a boycott.\n\n“I am trying to figure out if there is no teeth, what is it that we are trying to do at the end of the day,” responded Zepeda while also questioned why not include other countries as well like China.\n\nStaff responded through the direction of the mayor, they are concerned right now about the genocide of the Palestinian people—moral urgency right now and they could think about other human rights abuses in the future.\n\nMartinez interjected saying this is against all governments who promote genocide, oppression, or apartheid.\n\n“I don’t care who they are or where they are. If they are doing harm to the people around them, they are wrong and we need to divest from them,” stated Martinez. “Its really difficult because of the military industrial complex to abort ourselves from it. We would have to stop drinking Coca Cola, stop drinking Pepsi, stop eating Quaker Oats, stop eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. There is so much money going into war, from so many different angles… healthcare is making money off people in prison.”\n\n“It sounds like we may need to edit this to include China and other countries,” stated Zepeda.\n\nShiva Mishek, chief of staff to Mayor Eduardo Martinez, then requested the council to expand the list as this was just a starting place for consideration.\n\n“What many people have found disturbing through this conflict is the extent to which our country supports the violence that is happening in Gaza right now. If you notice, I think all companies on this list is United States Counties,” stated Mishek “I think this list can be expanded, there are so many companies that are intertwined in incarceration, occupations, surveillance, obviously I am not on council, but I think if council wants to expand the list, there is no shortage of villains.”\n\nCouncilmember Soheila Bana shared she was proud to co-sponsor the agenda item.\n\n“This agenda item is about prisoners, about immigrant, is about Palestinians, its anti-apartheid and it is against genocide and war crimes,” stated Bana. “More than anything, fundamentally, it is about us and our humanity. This is to affirm that we do not want to be accomplices in these crimes.”\n\nShe said Richmond did not want to profit from the war or killing of thousands of men, women and children in Gaza who have no place to go. Nor the prison industry industry or slavery practices. Nor handcuffing patients in the healthcare industry.\n\n“Tonight, we are doing what Congress should have done. Our state and federal leaders have let us down and responsibility has fallen on our college students who have stood up that this nation will not be complacent with mass murder and genocide,” stated Bana. “Together, we stand for justice and humanity.”\n\nCouncilmember Melvin Willis shared he didn’t want the city to profit off of other peoples suffering and did not want to enable someone else’s prejudice and hiding behind propaganda that is slaughtering families.\n\n“It’s not okay and we need to start somewhere,” said Willis. “I hope other cities pass a divestment policy like this and that the rest of the national leaders wake up and start to take this seriously. Ceasefire now and free Palestine from genocide.”\n\nCouncilmember Gayle McLaughlin said she was proud to be a co-sponsor of the item noting that if they were the first to call for a ceasefire, but only to then profit from it, they would be hypocrites.\n\n“Unlike our national government who talk out of one side of their mouth saying they are telling the Israeli government that they should do everything possible to avoid civilian killings which of course is not doing an iota of good. Then on the other side of their mouth they approve millions of dollars of war machinery and weaponry to the Israeli government with our tax dollars, they are being hypocritical,” stated McLaughlin. “They are being complicit in genocide.”\n\nShe thanked the young people for opening up their eyes and taking a stand.\n\nCouncilmember Doria Robinson said she was proud of the city and proud of Richmond to take on the issue by being courageous to stand in alignment with their values.\n\nThe motion passed in a 5-0 vote with Councilmember Zepeda abstaining.\n\nStaff Report\n\nRestricted Companies\n\nRelated"
