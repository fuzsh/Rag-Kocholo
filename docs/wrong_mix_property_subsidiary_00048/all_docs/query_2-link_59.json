        "text": "I'd recommend using RemoteSigned as opposed to Unrestricted, and limiting the policy to the CurrentUser if possible.\n\nRun Powershell as Admin, and then:\n\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n\nRemoteSigned: \"The default execution policy for Windows server computers.\"\n\nOther than that, I wouldn't worry about it too much, as it's not intended to be a security mechanism. See this quote from the docs:\n\n\"The execution policy isn't a security system that restricts user actions. For example, users can easily bypass a policy by typing the script contents at the command line when they cannot run a script. Instead, the execution policy helps users to set basic rules and prevents them from violating them unintentionally.\"\n\nThere is no security risk whatsoever associated with allowing remoted signed scripts to run on your local machine. It basically means you can execute local unsigned scripts i.e scripts written by you while scripts from a remote source (nodemon in this case) must be signed by a trusted authority.\n\nP.S: If you're on windows, you can just go to settings >> update and security >> for developers >> check the box beside change execution policy to allow local powershell scripts to run without signing\n\nI've a better solution, just go to the folder where nodemon.ps1 places (path is in error) and delete nodemon.ps1 file.\n\nnow go to the terminal and run nodemon -v, if you get a version then the problem solved.\n\nWhile using npm I recommend to bridge the nodemon command in the scripts section and leave the security settings as they are.\n\npackage.json:\n\n{ \"scripts\": { \"hmr\": \"nodemon index.js\", \"nodemon\": \"npm run hmr\", \"start\": \"node index.js\" }, \"dependencies\": {} }\n\nJust execute npm run nodemon which will run the hmr line behind the scenes.\n\nYou can do this by without changing the policy. C:\\Users\\HP MICROTECH\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\nodemon.ps1 (path is given at error screen)\n\njust go to this path and delete nodemon.ps1\n\nand there your nodemon runs.\n\nThe best way to get rid of this error is\n\nRun the below command in your windows power shell as admin\n\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n\nBasically it will ask you to change the execution policy then type Y .\n\n**OR**\n\nYou can do is without changing your execution Policy\n\nInstall nodemon using this command : npm i nodemon -g\n\nthen type nodemon -v you will see a path in first line of error go to that path then delete that nodemon.ps1 file or filename with.ps1xml extension.\n\nMake sure that you are installing nodemon globally For more details microsoft execution policies docs\n\nGo to this link and then follow the steps.\n\nOpen Powershell as run as administrator and then run the below commands:\n\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned PS> .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded. The file .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed. The script will not execute on the system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. At line:1 char:1 + .\\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess PS> Unblock-File -Path [Your Path where the problem found] PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nnodemon: File C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more\n\ninformation, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.\n\nIf anyone who facing this problem...so my opinion is that just go in file and delete the nodemon.ps1 file and then try use nodemon filename"
