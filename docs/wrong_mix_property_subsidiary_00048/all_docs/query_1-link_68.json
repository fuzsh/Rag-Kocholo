        "text": "SPOILERS FOR FINAL FANTASY 7 REMAKE BELOW\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake introduces some interesting new elements and builds on the base game in peculiar ways.\n\nOne of the most notable shifts from the original is how you unlock Summon materia – some of this can be found out in the wild, as per the original game, but some of it needs to be unlocked via gathering Intel data then challenging the Summon you wish to acquire.\n\nSome of the Summon challenges are trivial, some are quite intense – it depends on how well-equipped you are going into battle.\n\nBut like most Final Fantasy VII Remake fights, if you know the systems and how to exploit them, you'll be in good stead.\n\nHere's what you need to know about combatting Shiva in Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake Hell House Guide | Final Fantasy 7 Remake: How to unlock, beat Fat Chocobo | Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Tips to unlock and beat Shiva | How long Is Final Fantasy 7 Remake? | Final Fantasy 7 Remake Moogle Medals Guide | Final Fantasy 7 Remake Darts Guide | Final Fantasy 7 Remake Whack-a-Box guide | Final Fantasy 7 Remake Download Size | Final Fantasy 7 Remake: How to decorate the Leaf House\n\nHow to challenge Shiva in Final Fantasy 7 Remake\n\nIt’s possible to take on Shiva quite early in the game – as soon as you team up with Aerith and unlock the second set of Battle Intel challenges from the appallingly-named Chadley.\n\nYou will need to be part-way through Chapter 8, Budding Bodyguard, and locate Chadley in the Sector 5 Slums. When you first meet him here, you’ll only be playing as Cloud.\n\nThough it’s possible to complete the challenge with just Cloud, we’d recommend waiting until Aerith rejoins the party.\n\nOnce unlocked, simply press Triangle to talk to Chadley, then navigate to the ‘VR Missions’ option in the menu. You’ll be given the choice to fight Shiva in virtual reality.\n\nConfirm the challenge to start the battle.\n\nHow to beat Shiva in Final Fantasy 7 Remake\n\nShiva is an Ice-type summon and as such is vulnerable to Fire-type magic.\n\nThough this fight isn’t too hard, there are a couple of easy tricks you can use to ensure victory on your first try.\n\nBefore heading into battle, ensure both Cloud and Aerith (or your whole party, if you’re playing later) have a Fire Materia equipped.\n\nIf you’ve found an Elemental Materia, you can slot this into a weapon with two linked Materia slots to make Cloud’s physical attacks infused with Fire. This will up your damage output significantly.\n\nThe vast majority of Shiva’s attacks are ice-based, so if you’ve got Materia you can link to Ice Materia to increase your resistance to the element, equip that too. Shiva will attack with Ice Families, Blizzara, Heavenly Strike and other area-of-effect moves, so keep your heroes apart if possible.\n\nUse Cloud’s physical attacks in the more nimble Operator setting to dish out damage to the Summon and keep an eye on Aerith’s ATB bar. Once she gets a single charge, cast Arcane Ward.\n\nIf you’ve unlocked Fira at this point, make Aerith cast Fira every time her charge hits one bar, and you’ll hit Shiva twice each time, increasing her Stagger bar considerably as you go.\n\nUse Cloud’s ATB meter to heal if necessary (if you’re using curative magic, position Cloud in the Arcane Ward to make sure it lands twice) and as soon as Shiva is pressured, use Focused Thrust to dish out some damage and – hopefully – Stagger her.\n\nOnce staggered, keep up the offensive with Aerith and her double Fire magic, and use Cloud’s physical attacks (including Braver and any other skills you’ve unlocked) to take chunks of Shiva’s life off.\n\nIf you’ve got Ifrit equipped, the bar to Summon him will appear roughly halfway/two-thirds of the way into the fight. Once you can summon him, the fight is more or less certain to be yours.\n\nEnjoy!"
