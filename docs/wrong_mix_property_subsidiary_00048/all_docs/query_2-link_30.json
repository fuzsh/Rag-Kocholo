        "text": "In its early days, the company was primarily focused on the the development of memory chips, until it created the world’s first commercial microprocessor.\n\nIntel went public via an IPO in 1970, and raised $6.8 million in the offering. The company is now worth hundreds of billions.\n\nBy 1972, Intel had created the world’s best selling semiconductor memory chip, but it’s business was focused on DRAM during that era. The company’s microprocessor business would be the one to drive the company to massive growth and notoriety in the 1980s.\n\nIts microprocessor technology enabled IBM to create and popularize the “personal computer” which were almost all powered by Intel’s technology.\n\nPersonal computers represented about half of Intel’s 2017 revenues. Data center revenue has grown to about 30% of the company’s revenue and internet of things devices a small-but-growing 5%."
