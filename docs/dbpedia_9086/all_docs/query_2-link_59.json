        "text": "In 1991 Ukraine became an independent nation. For the first time ever in its long and conflicted history it had finally achieved statehood. Casting aside the yoke of foreign rule led to many changes in the nation, nowhere more so than in Lviv. Soviet symbols were quickly removed. Tourism became one of the major economic engines. The historic Old Town was renovated, along with several other areas in the city. The changes have accelerated since those heady days following the Soviet collapse. The Orange and Maiden Revolutions were acutely felt in the city as citizens spilled into the street, protesting for weeks on end to combat bad governance and corruption. Lviv gained a nickname, “the most Ukrainian city in Ukraine” due to its role as a major force in creating a national identity. One transformation brought about by Ukrainian statehood and that has surprisingly lasted has been street names. The fact that most of Lviv’s streets have kept the same name given them following Ukrainian statehood is characteristic of a degree of stability lacking in other areas of the nation, especially the East. It also just might signal the end of a centuries-long process – accelerated during the chaotic 20th century – where Lviv’s streets underwent a withering number of name changes.\n\nWar Changes Everything, Especially Street Names\n\nIt has been said that war is a great innovator. In the case of Lviv’s street names, war has been both a great degenerator and regenerator (portmanteau words). The degeneration occurred when street names were changed to reflect the heroes of Nazism and Stalinism. The regeneration took place as new names reflecting the dominant Ukrainian presence in the city came to grace the streets. These name changes were far from the only ones. The situation regarding name changes has been fluid over the last couple of centuries as conquerors, whether by treaty or military force, occupied the city and proceeded to put their own superficial stamp on the city. Nowhere has this been as true as in heart of the city center.\n\nProspekt Svobody, the grandest boulevard in Lviv has undergone no less than 17 name changes over the past 200 years. Transliterated the current name means Liberty Avenue which seems appropriate since the boulevard was the setting for mass protests to liberate Ukraine from cronyism and corruption twice in the last twelve years. Yet for thirty-one years (1959 -1990) Prospekt Svobody was named Lenin Avenue, after a man who stood for the opposite of liberty. The same was certainly true of Adolf Hitler. The Nazi dictator’s name was given to the boulevard for much of the German occupation of Lviv during World War II. The names of these blood soaked ideologues were added to the boulevard in due course as a symbolic reminder to Lvivians of the ideological force exercising control over the city. The first German names given to the boulevard following the invasion, Museumstrasse then Opernstrasse, were likely dropped because of their banality.\n\nName Calling – The Forgotten & The Famous\n\nIn prior decades the Polish presence in the city informed two martial names for the boulevard, first Hetmanska then Legionow. While both were serious and forceful names, they were much more ideologically moderate than the names of those tyrants that were to soon follow. The Habsburgs named the boulevard after a lesser light of the ruling family, a figure who today is all but overshadowed by his son. Archduke Karl Ludwig was once a name on the lips of every Lvivan who strolled along Karl Ludwig Strasse. He was the brother of Emperor Franz Josef and for a short time was part of the Galician provincial government that called Lviv home. If Karl Ludwig is remembered for anything today, it is as the father of Franz Ferdinand, the man whose assassination sparked the First World War.\n\nAnother famous street in Lviv has managed to have more name changes than Prospekt Svobody. Ivan Franko Street, including separate parts of it, has gone by no less than 28 names since the late 19th century. Today it is named for one of Ukraine’s most beloved sons. It is fitting that Franko, who was born in Galicia and spent part of his life in Lviv, ended up with one of the city’s most important streets named after him. Less known is the fact that Franko died lonely and impoverished in the city. Interestingly the street was named for him not after Ukrainian national independence, but following the Soviet reoccupation of the city in 1944. Franko was one of the few individuals considered a hero to both the Soviets and nationalistic Ukrainians. The Soviets recognized him for his promotion of socialism and worker’s rights. Ukrainians revere him today because he advocated for their rights, against the oppressive rule of aristocrats, capitalists and Polish elites. He received the honor of having the entire street named for him. This is unlikely to change.\n\nThe Unchanged – A Place & A People\n\nSpeaking of street names unlikely to change, the endurance of Krakivska Street in the Old Town goes against the trend of name changes in Lviv. Despite the virulence of anti-Polish forces during World War II, culminating in the expulsion of ethnic Poles from the city in the war’s immediate aftermath, the street has maintained this name since the mid-15th century. In medieval times, the name denoted that this was the street which led to Krakow. The only changes to the name have been the various transliterations of it into the languages of the ruling authorities. Even the Germans called it Krakauerstrasse.\n\nOne other Old Town Street that has only experienced a bare minimum of changes is the short – both literally and physically – Ruska street, which extends from the southeast side of Rynok Square to Pidvalna Street. The name was first given in 1472. This was the main street going through the Ruthenian (a pre-20th century term for Ukrainians) section of the Old Town. There is poetic justice in the continual use of this name. It staying power is representative of the unbroken presence of the Rus’/Ruthenian/Ukrainian people throughout Lviv’s history and their ability to survive the changes both superficial and geo-political which have transformed the city. Though names, loyalties and identifications have constantly changed in Lviv, the Ukrainian people have always remained.\n\nSeveral years ago I was with an English friend in a small South Dakota town on the Great Plains. These communities are stridently patriotic. It is not uncommon to see a well-kept park with a memorial to the town’s military veterans in the center of town. There are usually several neat and tidy looking churches. At one of these, a Lutheran Church, there was a very large American flag conspicuously rippling in the unceasing prairie wind. My friend paused to look at it. He then said to me “I don’t like that. The church is supposed to keep a check on that. Nationalism has got a lot of good men killed. Churches should not be promoting that.” I often recall this comment when I am in Eastern Europe. I have been in countless churches where the national colors are hoisted close to the main altar or pulpit. Church and state seem to be inseparable. Even where the relationship is not quite as visible, churches and the military, churches and warfare in Eastern Europe are bound by history. This is certainly true for one of Lviv’s most famous churches.\n\nThe Church At War – Jesuits Under Fire\n\nThere is hardly a more appropriate name for a church than the Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church in Lviv. To most Lvivans, it is known as the Jesuit Church, a less than memorable name. The term “Garrison” speaks volumes about the church’s history, both by convention and chance. The name was given a century and a half after the church was first constructed. This happened following the Jesuit Order’s suppression by Pope Clemens II in 1773, as the church underwent a conversion whereby it began to serve the Austrian military garrison that now occupied the city. This was the first of several encounters the church would have with the military, many of these due to unlucky chances of war. During the Revolution of 1848, the Austrian military ended up bombing its own church. The roof and antechamber were damaged when they were struck by artillery shells. Such was Austrian Imperial disdain for the rebellion that their church got caught in the crossfire. This was collateral damage which could be repaired, at least in a physical sense.\n\nWhile the city center of Lviv remained relatively unscathed by bombing during both world wars, the Garrison Church was not so lucky. In the Polish-Ukrainian conflict that broke out in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, the roof of the church was struck. In addition, an area in front of the main altar was hit. Then in World War II, as the Soviets retook Lviv, a bomb went through the church’s roof and struck close to the altar once again. It would be a decade and a half before a new roof was constructed. By this time, the Jesuits had long since vanished from the church as had all worshipers. The church was closed for 65 years. When it finally reopened in 2011, a connection with the military was once again established when the 20th anniversary of the Ukrainian Armed Forces was celebrated. This brought the church’s relationship with the military forward into the present. The word “conflicted” best describes the garrison church’s history since the late 18th century. The time prior to that was less about conflict and more about survival.\n\nThe Miracle Of Survival – Creations & Restorations\n\nPeople have prayed within the Jesuit Church’s walls in search of miracles for centuries, hardly realizing that they were inside a miracle, a miracle of architecture, faith and endurance. The Garrison Church has been an inviting target since the time of its establishment. This was due to both its size and location. These attributes are indicative of the wealth and power behind the movement to build the church. The Jesuits arrived in Lviv during the late 16th century, exactly 50 years after the order was founded. As so often happened in the history of Lviv’s sacral architecture an initial wooden church gave way to a more formidable structure that signified a lasting presence. In this regard the Jesuits did not disappoint. The Sts. Peter and Paul Church took two decades to construct. Master architects were brought in from Italy to build a lasting and memorable structure. The final product was, as it still is today, one of the largest churches in the city, almost half a football field in length, rising eight and a half stories high. It could house up to 5,000 during large masses. The main façade replicated the Church of the Gesu in Rome, the first baroque facade known to history.\n\nThe rest of Sts. Peter and Paul Church did not disappoint either. It was a fascinating integration of late Renaissance and early Baroque architecture. A segue between two disparate styles, that when fused together created a basilica unlike any other. It was located at a prime, but dangerous spot within the Old Town walls, along the western side by the aptly named Jesuit Gate. This made it witness to the many sieges of the city. Yet it was not invaders, but fire that would offer the greatest threat to the church’s survival. A ferocious blaze consumed much of the original structure in 1734. A wealthy female patron and scion of the powerful Potocki family of Polish nobles, Elizabeth Potocki, came to the church’s rescue by paying for its renovation.\n\nSystems of Belief – The Integration Of Church With State\n\nIdeology offered yet another threat to the church from the late 18th century onward, as state trumped church with the onset of modernity. On multiple occasions the Jesuits were banished from Lviv. They were viewed as a threat to state control, whether imperial or communist. The fact that they would not toe the party line brought the order suspicion and suppression. The survival of the church was in doubt numerous times, never more so then during the years of Soviet rule. The church ended up serving as a book depository for several decades. Some of the interior’s sacral artwork degenerated, but it role as a depository saved the church from destruction. It now has been reopened and the tie between church and state is secure once again. The spiritual and political is bound together inextricably in Ukraine, for better or worse. The church does not keep a watch on the state, so much as support it. The difference between the two is blurred. The next time conflict comes to Lviv and threatens the state expect the Garrison Church to be caught in the crossfire.\n\nSometimes just a name is enough to stimulate curiosity. A name that sparkles and shines as it rolls off the tongue, a name that makes a spectacle out of sound. All of this and much more comes to mind when that magically evocative word, Staroievreiska is spoken. This street, only one removed from the southern side of Rynok Square in Lviv, has it owns hidden charms and lost tragedies. It is such a pity that visitors pass by or through it with little more than a glance as they rush forth to the more popular attractions of the Old Town. Staroievreiska demands greater recognition than the indifference done to it by thousands each day. But it is less the name that is special, symbolic and tragic, more so the place. What it has been and what it has become explains Staroievreiska’s deceptive allure.\n\nDisappearing Acts – Hints Of A Different Past\n\nWhile the name may evoke beauty, mystery and tragedy, the street that is now called Staroievreiska had a less than eventful beginning. Its earliest history is a bit downtrodden if not disappointing. The first records documenting the streets existence state that it was home to a cattle market, thus it went by the name of Bydleca Street (Bydleca is the Polish word for cattle). This was the first of many names that would change along with the street’s limits throughout the centuries. Today Staroievreiska runs from Mitskevycha Square to Arsenalna Street, making it one of the longest streets in the center of Lviv. This current length is a relatively recent development. Until the latter part of the 19th century it consisted of three separate streets, that all went by different names. Even after it was turned into a single street the names continued to change. In 1990 Staroievreiska became the ninth and for now, final name of the street.\n\nWhile evocative, the name also has darker connotations. Literally translated it means “Old Jewish Street.” The street was a thread that wove its way through Lviv’s Jewish life for hundreds of years, until that community was destroyed in the Holocaust. The literal translation of “Old” in the name can be interpreted one of two ways, either as nostalgia or recognition that the Jewish presence is a thing of the past in the area. And Jews were not the only people who once called this street their own and then vanished. The lower end of Staroievreiska (below Halytska street) was once intimately connected with Lviv’s Polish community. Evidence of the Polish presence still abounds at the beginning of Staroievreiska. It is there that a three-story building adorned with busts of famous Polish kings and leaders can be discovered on the side facing Teatralna street. A few steps further up the street stands 3 Staroievreiska, displaying a bas-relief medallion of Poland’s most famous scientific figure Nicolas Copernicus. During the 18th century the buildings from 1 Staroievreiska to 24 Staroievreiska were under the ownership of the Roman Catholic Church, the institution most representative of the Polish state. This presence was, like almost everything else in Lviv’s history, fleeting.\n\nThe Past Is About The Present – Degrees of Indifference\n\nBy the end of the 19th century a newly liberated group of entrepreneurs and businessmen had taken possession of these buildings. Surnames such as Laufer, Reischer, Weinbaum, Mehrer and Krebs were typical among these new owners. The street was a thread that connected the old and new of Lviv’s Jewish community, the upwardly mobile enterprising individuals with the traditionally religious. There were areas of commerce, places to call home and sacred houses of worship. The three, four and five story tenement houses that still stand today along the street, once held hundreds of the 80,000 Jewish households to be found in the city prior to the Second World War. The houses would remain, but the inhabitants vanished, into the ghetto, into the camps and into mass graves. The tenements were mere scaffolding that had momentarily held their lives.\n\nThe walls that bore witness to this massive human tragedy were solid, silent and indifferent. Today the housing and walls are much the same, though it is doubtful that their current inhabitants have the time or inclination to take notice. There is a great truth to be discovered in this indifference. For the living the past is rarely about the past, it is almost always about the present, about what or what does not remain. Little more than a beautiful and evocative name recalls Jews on this street, there is little else to remember them by. This is certainly the case with the missing memory of Jewish Staroievriska’s architectural and human history. The Nazis did not just aim to destroy the Jewish people. They aimed to destroy anything that might be part of their legacy, to erase them from memory, and render them invisible to history.\n\nWhen The Magic Of Memory Is Gone – Who Will Remember Them?\n\nEvidence of this erasure can be found further up the street. The part of Staroievriska bounded by Serbska and Arsenala streets is home to places and spaces that deserve imaginative contemplation. This is only possible with knowledge of what has been lost. The interpretation of emptiness begins at the overgrown lot at Staroievreiska 41. For a century and a half this was the site of a Jewish House of Prayer, known as the Beth Midrash, where intense study of the Talmud took place. Through arched windows light flowed into the interior of the modest Baroque-era building, illuminating a contemplative environment where great minds delved into the inner spirits that inform the soul. The trees, weeds and bushes that mark the space today are the opposite of mystical. They are an affront to wisdom and memory, an unkempt marker of destruction. This natural residue is a reminder that hatred leads to obliteration. It is also a reminder that memory and knowledge can lead to re-creation, if for only a moment.\n\nAt 54 Staroievreiska the stardust sprinkled by the street’s name finally disintegrates. The magic is all but gone and only a name remains. This is where the Great City Synagogue was located until it was destroyed by the Nazis in 1943. This was the nerve center for the city’s Jewish religious life in the 19th and 20th century. Today nothing remains of the building. Sometimes the site is covered in tables and chairs for dinnertime revelers, other times it acts as a de facto car park. The open space can be seen as a powerful metaphor of what has been lost, both physically on the site and in human terms along Staroievreiska, namely a vibrant Jewish community. It seems appropriate that the site of the Great City Synagogue comes at the end of the street. This is tragically symbolic for the end of a magnificent culture that influenced life in Lviv for so many centuries. The site, much like the street, demands an interpretation of emptiness and a translation of sorrow, sadly this is lacking. Perhaps that is for the best, some tragedies defy comprehension. Life goes on, people still live and die on Staroievreiska, who will remember them.\n\nJust thirty years ago most of the famous churches in Lviv were either shuttered or utilized as storage facilities. The Dominican Cathedral was a Museum of Religion and Atheism. The Armenian Cathedral housed works of sacral art, not on the walls, but in boxes. The Bernadine Church had been closed for decades and fallen into disrepair. The Church of Sts. Olga and Elizabeth was nothing more than one big Neo-Gothic warehouse where cement and chalk were stored. Meanwhile, the Saints Peter and Paul Garrison Church (Jesuit Church) had become one of the larger book depositories in the Soviet Union with over a million volumes. Today the situation is completely opposite. The churches are revered as architectural monuments that contain some of the most glorious sacral works of art in Eastern Europe. Several are part of the Ensemble of the Historic Center that has made Lviv’s Old Town a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nWhat happened to the churches of Lviv during the Soviet era is rather disgusting. Paradoxically, it must also be said that at least the Soviet administration did not physically destroy the churches. Their neglect was largely benign with the unintentional consequence that the churches could be restored and that is exactly what has happened. On the other hand, a quarter century after the Soviet Union’s collapse Lviv has spent much of that time forgetting the Soviet era. This is due to a combination of factors, including a focus by the city’s tourism bureau on promoting Lviv’s Renaissance, Baroque and Austro-Hungarian past. As well as Ukrainian nationalism and anti-Russian sentiment that has led to the city’s Soviet past being relegated to the dustbin of history. The glorification of physical culture from the Soviet era has yet to happen and will likely never occur.\n\nSocialist Lviv – Blunt & Brutal\n\nAn interesting thought experiment is to try and imagine what Soviet era structures in Lviv might be deemed worthy of protection. The Center for Urban History of Eastern Europe, which is located in Lviv, has a website (http://www.lvivcenter.org/) that acts as a vast storehouse of information regarding the city’s architectural history. A thematic section on the site called “Socialist Lviv” offers a list of the most notable Soviet era structures in the city. The list unfortunately does not include the city’s main bus station, a hideous structure that looks like a reject prop from a 1960’s science fiction B-movie. The list has a total of 31 different buildings and monuments. A handful of these no longer exist, such as the Monument to the Stalin Constitution. In 1940, during the first Soviet Occupation it was placed at an intersection of several streets with the city’s commercial center, what is today Svobody Prospekt. The Nazis destroyed the monument after their arrival in Lviv a year later.\n\nThe Soviets got there chance to build many other monuments after they swept the Nazis out of the city a few years later. Of course, many of these idolized their victory in the so-called “Great Patriotic War.” The list includes the “Monument to the War Glory of the Soviet Army”, the “Monument to the Tank Soldier” and the “Monument to Doctors Who Died in World War II.” There is nothing clever about the names for Soviet war monuments. They reflect the system itself, blunt and brutal, always in your face, leaving no doubt as to what they are meant to convey. At least the names are memorable, if not the sculpture, which like much of Soviet architecture is entirely forgettable.\n\nBuilding A New World – Entertainment, Education & Rigidity\n\nThe Soviet era architecture built in Lviv was less about a building’s aesthetics and more about its utilization. How could it be otherwise? Such terminology as industrial Soviet modernism, monumental modernism and late Soviet modernism do not lend themselves to the imagination. The buildings represented a new world, which at least aesthetically, was certainly a lesser one. Even the names were cringe worthy. For instance, a building constructed as a prototype for the majestically named 700th Anniversary Street was named the Regional Statistics Department. The name was about as inviting as the building, a nine story vertical structure placed atop a two story horizontal one, with each building placed at right angles to the other. It was built with those rare aficionados of slab concrete, rigidity and functionalism in mind. It is not memorable, but it is still standing. An ensemble of like styled structures was planned for 700th Anniversary Street. After only a few were built the project mercifully ended.\n\nThe list of structures for “Socialist Lviv” contains no less than six cinemas. These were important for propaganda. As the decades passed and Soviet rule relaxed, they became a favored form of entertainment. Surely, the movies shown inside were more interesting than the architecture which had nothing in particular to recommend it. Movies could entertain or educate. It is the latter which was communism’s greatest achievement. Mass education is one of the Soviet era’s longest lasting legacies. Perhaps this is why there are three buildings from Lviv Polytechnical National University on the list. It was not so much that they were built to last, as they were built to be used. They are still in use today by thousands of students. Only an architecture buff would find these buildings of passing interest. The important idea behind them is that they have helped provide students with a first class education. During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Second Polish Republic, Lviv had thousands of illiterate and uneducated citizens. The Soviets rectified this problem, but the system exacted a dreadful toll on the people.\n\nCopying the Enemy– Stalinist Designs\n\nSpeaking of dreadful the use of the word Stalin, Stalinist or Stalinism usually has horrifying connotations. Ironically the one building from Soviet-era Lviv worth seeing is done up in the style of Stalinist Neoclassicism. This is the Veterinary Medicine Academy Main Building found on Pekarska Street. Though the building is only three stories high it dominates the immediate surroundings. This is mainly due to its columned portico, which has more in common stylistically with ancient Greece or Rome. The Soviets and especially Stalin were unable to defeat Western Civilization. Instead they stole from it. Unfortunately theft ends up debasing rather than sustaining a civilization. This speaks volumes about the Soviet system’s ideals and mind numbing architectural achievements.\n\nTens of thousands of people visit St. George’s Cathedral in Lviv each year. They marvel at its rich Baroque-Rococo architecture, admire the emotional expressiveness of the sculptures surrounding its portal and sense the pervasive spiritual power of its ornate interior. The Cathedral is one of the most important religious sites in Eastern Europe. As such, the figures dramatized in sculpture and statuary around the cathedral showcase some of the most revered men in church history. They include Saints George, Athanasius and Leo. The latter being the man for whom Lviv was named. There is also a new statue just outside the cathedral gates of Metropolitan Andrei Sheptysky, the man who did more than anyone to keep the cause of Ukrainian nationhood alive during the first half of the 20th century. One person not represented in this pantheon, at least on the surface, was Volodymyr Sterniuk. He was the major figure in keeping alive the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church during the dark days of communism. If not for men like Sterniuk, it is doubtful that St. George’s would be the revered home of Greek Catholicism today. The only place to find Sterniuk there is in the Cathedral’s tomb. This is a bit of historical symmetry, since he spent most of his church tenure working in the underground.\n\nThere are people who are witnesses to history and there are those who make history. There are also those who do both, moving from historical observer to historical actor. In such cases, an event someone has witnessed may have such a profound effect upon them, that they dedicate their life to taking action. This is what happened to Volodymyr Sterniuk, a priest who witnessed a shattering historical event at St. George’s Cathedral. Many decades later he would become one of the main actors involved in reversing this event. Sterniuk’s story is not just a lesson in history, but also in humanity. The story begins in a place few take time to notice as they are gazing at the awe-inspiring beauty of the cathedral’s interior, the choir loft.\n\nA Historic Liquidation – Subterfuge at St. George’s\n\nAt the end of winter in 1946, a synod (assembly of clergy) of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was held at St. George’s. This meeting took place under the watchful eye of the Soviet NKVD (precursor to the KGB). Noticeable was the fact that there were no bishops or other high level officials of the church present. That was because they had all been arrested and sent to gulag camps deep inside Russia or murdered. Ever since the Red Army reoccupied western Ukraine during the latter half of World War II, the Soviets were in the process of implementing hardline Stalinism throughout Ukraine. What this meant in practice was that any institution or person considered a threat to the omnipotence of the Soviet state must be either marginalized or destroyed.\n\nAt this time, the most powerful institution representing Ukrainian national interests was the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC). It was headquartered out of St. George’s. The Soviet authorities had been working to get the UGCC under their control, but it was a delicate matter. Outright destruction was out of the question since the Soviets were already fighting a guerilla war against Ukrainian nationalists. If they were not careful, the entire population could turn against them. They had to be sly, clever, duplicitous and deceitful. In other words they had to be everything their leader, Josef Stalin, was in order to Sovietize Ukrainian society.\n\nLofty Ideals – The Beginning of a Resistance\n\nThe preferred method of Soviet control would be to subsume the UGCC under the Russian Orthodox Church. This meant reversing the 350 year old Union of Brest which at the time had united millions of Ukrainian and Belarussian Orthodox Christians with the Roman Catholic Church. The Orthodox Christians involved had agreed to recognize the Pope’s authority. In return they would continue to perform all the traditional Orthodox rituals and customs. Most importantly, they would no longer submit to the Russian Orthodox Church’s authority. This created what became known as the Uniate Church and turned millions of Orthodox believers to the west. This had been a thorn in the side of the Russian Orthodox Church ever since, but by 1946 Russian Orthodoxy was a shell of its former self. It was totally under Soviet control. The church leadership had been hollowed out and was now staffed by regime loyalists. The same was now planned for the UGCC at the synod.\n\nThat “historic” assembly took place during the second week of March 1946 at St. George’s. The clergy involved did not have any high church officials or real leadership to look toward for guidance. All the archbishops and bishops of the UGCC had been asked earlier by the Soviet authorities to endorse unification with the Russian Orthodox Church. They refused, thus sealing prison or death sentences for themselves. Over 200 handpicked “representatives” of the UGCC were at the synod in St. George’s Cathedral. They were asked to vote by a show of hands on unification. Voldymyr Sterniuk was hidden in the choir loft during the vote. He was a UGCC priest with a conscious, but he could say nothing for fear of arrest. He watched helplessly as a unanimous vote was carried out in favor of unification. The Soviets authorities surely thought this event would mark the end of the UGCC, but Sterniuk along with many others ensured that it was the beginning of a decade’s long resistance. This would not be the last time Sterniuk would be involved in a historic moment in St. George’s, but the next time he would be one of the principle actors rather than a silent witness.\n\nKeeping Faith – From Repression to Resurgence\n\nThe next year Sterniuk was arrested and sent to a gulag camp in northern Russia, where he cut trees in the frozen forests. For five long years he toiled in forced labor, but at the same time his faith never wavered. At one point he was reduced to using bread crumbs for mass. After Stalin’s death, the gulags emptied out and Sterniuk regained his freedom. Unfortunately repression continued. He was not allowed to work as a priest in any official capacity, thus he was forced to find employment in a wide variety of jobs, everything from a janitor to a nurse and even a gatekeeper. Throughout these years he continued working in the underground church. It has been estimated that the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the Soviet Union was the largest clandestine religious organization in the world at the time.\n\nSterniuk lived an austere existence, inhabiting a single small room over a paint shop that was often raided by Soviet authorities. He nonetheless heard confessions and held masses there. Sometimes he was forced to carry out these spiritual services deep in the woods. A little over a decade after he was released from the Gulag, Sterniuk was ordained as a bishop. Then in 1972 he became the UGCC’s leader, a role he would continue to play until the Soviet Union’s collapse and the rise of an independent Ukraine. A year before the collapse he led the first divine liturgical services in St. George’s since before the fateful synod in 1946. Sterniuk acted as an example to all members of the church with his steadfast devotion. He had endured suffering and privation for years on end, yet he continued carrying out the most important spiritual functions in the name of God.\n\nSterniuk turned out to be the atheistic Soviet regime’s worst nightmare. He led by example, an example of hope and faith while the Soviets led by fear and repression. Eventually something had to give and it was not Sterniuk. When Ukraine became an independent state, the UGCC became one of the most powerful institutions in the newly formed nation. Sterniuk and thousands of others had kept the faith alive long enough that a free and independent UGCC could rise again. This resurgence happened in concert with the movement that would establish an independent Ukraine.\n\nA Way Of Life – Sterniuk’s Achievement\n\nIn 1997 thousands marched through the streets of Lviv to St. George’s in a funeral procession for Sterniuk. His life as both an historical witness and actor had come full circle. He had witnessed the UGCC very nearly being destroyed at the infamous synod in March 1946. He then took an active role in the church’s endurance during the darkest years of hard line repression. Later he helped lead it to freedom. The power of belief had won out. There was no longer a need for any member – let alone a priest – of the UGCC to hide in a choir loft at St. George’s, because the Cathedral was now home once again to the church’s bishops, priests and parishioners. More than anything it was a spiritual home to the nation of Ukraine. That was as it still is today, in large part due to the work of Voldymyr Sterniuk.\n\nLviv seems to have everything a visitor could possibly want. A diverse and fascinating history, an Old Town filled with delicious Renaissance and Baroque architecture, cobblestone streets, atmospheric alleyways, pedestrian only areas made for strolling and beautiful urban parks. What more could a tourist ask for? Well there is one blind spot amid all of the city’s historical, cultural and architectural glory. The great unseen happens to be a castle. Of course, there is famed Castle Hill, a lush green space rising above the Old Town. Unfortunately, hardly anything is left of the famed medieval castle that once figured so prominently in the city’s history. The scant ruins consist of a small portion of the south wall and a few humps in the ground. Even the most fertile imagination is unable to conjure much of an image from this residue of royalty.\n\nA fine artistic panorama from the 17th century shows what Lviv (called by its Latin name Leopolis) looked like at the time. A detailed rendering of the Old Town is shown with Castle Hill in the background. Atop the hill soars High Castle, a grand spectacle crowning the highest point in Lviv. Sadly this image only serves to remind what has been lost to history. If it did still exist, it is easy to imagine visitors by the thousands snaking their way up Castle Hill for a visit. Alas, that will never happen, but all hope is not lost. There is a castle to be found in Lviv, quite unlike any other in Europe. A good distance away from Castle Hill, a spectacular discovery awaits those who venture further into the vast cityscape.\n\nA Castle In Kastelivka – Joszef Sosnowski ‘s House\n\nKastelivka is one of the most fascinating neighborhoods in Lviv. Located in the southwestern part of the city, it is filled with wondrous structural concoctions, an exhibition of art nouveau architecture in all its varied iterations. Kastelivka became a trendy area during the latter part of the 19th century. Many of Lviv’s artisans and growing middle class moved into the district. An incredible array of villas and eclectic housing sprung up along it streets. The chief architects behind Kastelivka’s most famous houses were a Ukrainian by the name of Ivan Levynsky working with the famous Polish architect Julian Zachariewicz. These two men brought folk décor, the arts and crafts movement and indigenous forms to bear on their creations. For his part, Levynsky started a firm for construction and buildings materials. The materials company produced such materials as ceramic tiles to would adorn his buildings. He was also a father figure to other aspiring architects. This led him to a role as an adviser in the design of the one structure in Lviv that comes closest to a castle in form and fashion.\n\nStanding at 50-52 General Chuprynky Street is the House-Castle (Joszef Sosnowski House). The main architect, a Pole by the name of Joszef Sosnowski designed the structure partly for himself. He received advice from Levynskyi. The building gives new meaning to the saying, “a man’s home is his castle.” One side – the house – was to be leased by a tenant, while the medieval style castle part would become the Sosnowski family’s home. Because of this, Sosnowski could allow his imagination to run wild and that is exactly what he did. What he created is both shocking and inviting, arresting and alluring, a paradoxical structure that looks part manor, part fortress, all in the midst of a neighborhood environment. Nothing to be found before or after it architecturally on General Chuprynky can quite prepare the viewer for what they are about to see. The building seems to just suddenly appear. The effect is disconcerting, so much so that it is difficult to imagine that the building’s main use is residential. The House-Castle imposes its presence on the immediate area to the point that its surroundings seem mundane by comparison.\n\nA Fantastical Funhouse – Fortress, Castle, Palace, Home\n\nSosnowski’s architectural confection stretches the imagination. It is as though he set out to create the city’s most fantastical funhouse by assembling a range of dramatic styles all under one roof. He integrated Romanesque and Gothic styles in the design. Parts of the House-Castle, including the overhanging balcony, were derived from Venetian palazzo style. The castle tower with its crenellations is reminiscent of a crusader fortress. Who would have imagined that by standing on a sidewalk in an outer district of Lviv, a viewer could be transported to the battlements of Krak Des Chevaliers in western Syria. This is the stuff dreams are made of with one major difference. The House-Castle is now as it was then an unforgettable reality. Sosnowski made the impossible possible and in the process created a home unlike any other in Lviv. It has since been converted into many homes. The House-Castle is architecture at its most transformative.\n\nThe House-Castle can easily be viewed by taking a short 10 minute ride on Tram #2 from Rynok Square to the Hospital #5 tram stop. Better yet, it can be visited along with other hidden wonders on the “Lost Lviv” Kumpel-tour. Those looking for a more intimate experience are now able to enjoy it as an accommodation. A recent, seemingly innocuous advertisement on AirBNB stating “APARTMENT IN LVIV Wi-FI” revealed a remodeled and fully furnished apartment available for rent in the House-Castle for only $24 per night. While castle stays have become increasingly popular with tourists all across Europe, staying in the House-Castle would be an otherworldly experience. A visitor could become king for a day, a night or a week. A traditional touch of Lviv awaits arrivals at the entrance, a stone lion. An added bonus for those who stay for several nights is the opportunity to explore Kastelivka. This architecture rich district is filled with eclectic villas. The houses are expressive of a self-confident and booming Lviv at the turn of the 20th century, an imperial city expanding outward and upward, pushing the architectural and residential boundaries to the outer limits.\n\nIn the late 18th century the nerve center of Lviv began to shift. Rynok Square which had once been the city’s commercial and cultural heart slowly lost its centrality to city life. The elegant baroque tenement houses that proscribed its boundaries were still just as beautiful as they had ever been, but the merchants and guilds that had called them home for centuries, exercising power from their immaculately adorned halls, could only watch helplessly as Austrian officials began to remake the city into a Habsburg one. Most of the city walls which had ringed the old town, segregating the haves from the have-nots, were torn down. Now the city’s expansion could radiate outward, the limits of Lviv (Lemberg to the Austrians) were seemingly limitless, the barriers to growth both physical and mercantile were disbanded. The city was administratively restructured into five districts. The insular, monopolistic special interests that had held the reins of power for so long were disbanded or fell under Imperial control in just a few years.\n\nThe Austrians had a new “enlightened” vision of what Lviv must become. This meant remaking the city in their image. Building projects would now be approved and administered by a centralized bureaucracy. A new center for the city would rise in the area that today is Prospekt Svobody. This area had formerly been used as a city garden and park like green space. Now it would become the chief rival to Rynok Square (Ploscha Rynok), a public space for a growing city, a place for the masses to socialize and speculate, a city that would reflect imperial ambitions. The reach of the Austrian empire would now be extended into the forlorn frontier of Europe.\n\nPromenading the Poltva\n\nThe main focal point for Lviv’s makeover was where the Poltva River ran adjacent to the western side of the city walls. In 1776, a scant four years after Austria took control of the city, these walls were torn down. This area was known as the Hetman’s Ramparts, their destruction opened up new possibilities to expand the city. The ensuing rubble was used to fill in a large defensive embankment that had guarded the area near Saints Peter and Paul Garrison (former Jesuit) Church. This new beginning was not without its problems. The backfill used to fill the embankment proved to be highly unstable and prone to collapse. Such a major public thoroughfare demanded safety and stability. With characteristic Teutonic efficiency the Austrians managed to overcome this problem. Smooth, parallel streets were placed along the eastern and western banks of the Poltva. A promenade akin to the glacis in Vienna was constructed. It was given a thoroughly Austrian name, Karl Ludwig Strasse. Lviv was being westernized, as the Austrians attempted to bring order and structure to what they saw as a quasi-Oriental outpost.\n\nA series of arched bridges soon spanned the Poltva and poplar trees were planted to line the promenade. Lviv now had its own mini Ringstrasse, with it would come a sense of belonging to something greater than weary, downtrodden Galicia. This all sounds positively romantic. It is easy to imagine women in long, colorful dresses covered in floral patterns, strolling along the promenade twirling pastel parasols. While they walk arm and arm with their husbands dressed in their Sunday best suits, carrying brass tipped canes and sporting bowler hats. There was much of this, but the truth was also quite literally messy. The Poltva was fetid, teeming with sewage. The smell could be overwhelming and created a less than healthy environment. Commercial businesses in the area were filled with speculators. Loan sharks and confidence men proliferated.\n\nFalling Upward: Lviv Unlike Itself\n\nBoth the comforts and vices of modernity were on full display. A new city was born as the center of economic and social gravity moved close to the banks of the Poltva. The promenade became the throbbing heart of what was fast becoming a modern city, one whose population would come to be measured in the hundreds of thousands. In 1871, one side of Karl Ludwig Strasse was renamed Hetmańska, in honor of the Polish Great Crown Hetman Stanislaw Jablonowski, while the other side retained its name. Near the end of the 19th century the Poltva would be covered. It was not so much a river anymore as a culvert. The initial reason for the siting of the city was now hidden by concrete. Nature, in the form of flower beds and several species of trees were added to the urban landscape. In one sense, the promenade was nature made over in man’s image. Grand buildings, such as the Skarbek Theater (Maria Zankovetska Theater) and the Museum of Industry (Museum of Ethnography and Arts and Crafts), were constructed.\n\nLviv, as the administrative center for the quixotically named Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, was transformed into a showpiece for the Austrian provincial administration. Here was a vision of Habsburg grandeur that happily promoted imperial interests. This was a representation of industriousness with a human face, an imposition of the Habsburgs enlightened self-interest. Here is what the empire did for its citizens, now all they had to do was believe. On a more troubling note, the new center of Lviv could hopefully obscure the dire poverty and endemic hand to mouth subsistence that was the miserable lot for the overriding majority of the province’s citizens. A smoke and mirror substitute for broad prosperity.\n\nCenter Staged – Where The Heart Beats Strongest\n\nThe destruction of the western side of the Old City Walls and that area’s successful conversion, from ramparts to a public promenade and commercial center, can be seen in the fact that in present day Lviv this is still the city’s heart. It is where locals and tourists intermingle. It is a place where pedestrian and automobile traffic competes most fiercely, thousands jostle each day for urban elbow room. It is a public space where the multitudes come to stroll, while just a stone’s throw away business and commerce carries on. It is the place where Lviv’s major protests have taken place on multiple occasions over the past 25 years, where its citizens have found the courage to confront the Soviet legacy. Prospekt Svobody today, like Karl Ludwig Strasse during the 19th century, is Lviv at its most modern and European, filled with energy and possibility, freedom and dynamism.\n\nAt the intersection of Shevska and Teatral’na Streets in Lviv’s Old Town is Stefana Yavors’koho Square. It does not strike a visitor as a particularly historic place. The square has a couple of cafes, eating establishments and a boutique store. Across the street is the St. Peter and Paul Garrison (former Jesuit) Church, but from the square, only one side of the church can be seen. Parked cars usually line Teatral’na obscuring views in that direction. This area seems like the last place a visitor would come to find a historic first. If they do come looking though, there is nothing left to see. Ghosts rarely leave traces, even those made of bronze and stone. More to the point, conquerors do not leave the monuments and memorials of the previous rulers in place. They carry them off either to storage, to be melted down or shipped to the homeland of the honoree. History is not just written with ink or computer keystrokes, but also sculpted in bronze and stone. Like all history this can be revised, altered or destroyed.\n\nMonumental Feats – Of Icons & Ideologues\n\nStefana Yavors’koho square was once the setting for Lviv’s first secular monument, a monument to the Great Crown Hetman and Polish nobleman Stanislaw Jablonowski. The monument played public peek-a-boo, in a sort of now you see it, now you don’t game for almost two hundred years. It vanished then reappeared only to disappear forever not long after the outbreak of the Second World War. The monument’s checkered past is memorable for two reasons. One is because of its status as the city’s first monument. The Jablonowski monument also has similarities with many other monuments that once stood in Lviv, but can no longer be seen. Public space in the city has been contested space for monuments ever since the first one appeared. These monuments not only honored men, but they were also symbolic of a particular empire, nationality or ideology. The Jablonowski monument was guilty of the latter two. As such it was seen as a threat. It is hard to believe that inert pieces of bronze and stone can cast aspersions on a conqueror’s narrative, but they always have and likely always will. It is as much about what they represent as who they portray. To his proponents and opponents, Stanislaw Jablonowski came to represent one thing in life, but in death he was symbolic of many other ideas that were deemed dangerous.\n\nWarfare, that one word more than any other signifies Jablonowski’s life. He spent forty years engaged in military campaigns across eastern and central Europe, from the plains of Moldova to the Gates of Vienna. One of his martial exploits, defeating Tatar forces in the Battle of Lwow (the Polish name for Lviv) in 1695 and lifting a siege of the city, earned him the undying gratitude of Lvivians. For this feat of arms, Lviv’s wealthy citizens commissioned a statue of Jablonowski by master sculptor Sebastian Fesinger. Fesinger’s sacral works still adorn several churches in Lviv, most prominently the spectacular main altar at the former Jesuit Church. His completed monument of Jablonowski was unveiled in 1754. The Great Crown Hetman was portrayed in full military regalia with a bulawa (ceremonial mace) in his right hand, looking thoroughly royal with a noble air of confidence. The monument first stood in the courtyard of the former Jesuit Church. Despite the reverence shown to Jablonowski in Fesinger’s work, the monument was removed from its original placement when the church underwent renovation. It was then misplaced, disappearing from public view for many years. Only when a journalist rediscovered the deteriorating monument sitting in the backyard of a home was it fully restored.\n\nNow You See It, Now You Don’t – Disappearing Acts\n\nThe monument was then placed on the main city boulevard (today’s Prospekt Svobody), then known as Hetman’s Ramparts, the name also paying symbolic homage to Jablonowski. There it stood in front of the National Museum until World War II. Since the city at that time was part of the Second Republic of Poland and half of Lviv’s citizens were ethnically Polish, having a national hero like Jablonowski displayed in such a prominent place was totally logical. When the Soviets invaded and then occupied Lviv in October 1939 a different type of logic took hold. The Soviets were anti-noble, anti-national and anti-Polish in outlook, especially when it came to Lviv. The Soviets did not believe in building upon the old, they destroyed or looted the past. Their method of creating a new world in a conquered hinterland was through destruction and theft rather than co-option. Due to its prominent location, the Jablonowski monument had to go. Unlike the last empire to occupy Lviv, the relatively tolerant Austro-Hungarians, the Soviets had no use for Jablonowski. He symbolized what they opposed. The monument soon vanished and has never been seen since.\n\nMost likely the Jablonowski monument was melted down. There is a distinct possibility that its remnants were encased in another monument. If that monument happened to be a Soviet one then it too has likely disappeared from Lviv. The ghost of Lviv’s monumental past may be little more than broken pieces of concrete and melted bronze. Most monuments in the city have either been replaced or the spaces they once inhabited remain vacant, only to be surrounded by cafes, restaurants and capitalism. Thousands walk past Stefana Yavors’koho Square and have no idea what once stood in that little square. Neither do they care. Why should they? Life and commerce go on. The past disappears with every new development. Nothing lasts forever. That is certainly true of Lviv’s first monument. It is also true of all the monuments that disappeared during the city’s tumultuous 20th century. And it will surely be true of all the monuments that stand in the city today, but sometime deep in the future will vanish and be relegated to oblivion, In that sense the Jablonowski Monument was is and always will be the most enduring symbol of the inevitable decline of Lviv’s monuments.\n\nIn Lviv’s Pivalna Street close to the Korniakt Tower there is a historic tram. This is the Just Lviv It! tourist information center and souvenir shop. The tram looks to be from the pre-World War II years. It has a nice paint job with a bright shine and looks quite welcoming. The shop inside is neat and tidy, filled with knick knacks sure to get tourists loosening their wallets. This warm and inviting atmosphere is something visitors do not get as often when they ride the 10 different tram lines that weave through the city along 75 kilometers of rails. The Lviv tram system is efficient and reliable as far as timeliness goes, but the experience itself can test the nerves of the uninitiated. Last autumn I picked up Line 7 at the Pidvalna tram stop and rode it ten stops down the line to Yanivskyi Cemetery. The price is so cheap, at 2 hryvna per ride, that only an extreme miser would not use it. The problem is that at certain times of day the tram can be packed. I thought that noontime on a Sunday would see few tram riders, I was wrong.\n\nThe Anti -“Romantic” Lviv Tram\n\nThe tram I took on Line 7 was older, probably from the 1960’s. One of the most endearing and enduring qualities of Lviv’s trams concerns their Soviet aesthetics. Most of them have the look and feel of a workhouse. This is truly mass transportation in the truest sense. The trams are meant to do one thing, move lots of people from place to place. Comfort is lacking. As the tram approached my heart sank. I could see that it was old, rickety and over-packed. When the doors opened a crush of people spilled out. This was followed by a crowd of people entering. Jostling my way into this mass of overheated humanity took a high degree of finesse. Purchasing tickets from the driver and then getting the ticket punched was a paradoxical experience, taking both patience and pushiness. Unfortunately I ended up beside the ticket punch, never where you want to be in an overcrowded tram. At each stop a mélange of arms, elbows and hands came close to assaulting me. Ten stops on Line #7 was ten too many on this day. I have never felt so close to Lvivians in my life. I was within kissing distance of three people at any one time. Perhaps this was what was meant by the so called “romantic” Lviv tram.\n\nEven though it was not inordinately warm outside, the tram felt positively tropical. The smell of humanity was pervasive. Soon the tram got caught up in the snarl of traffic, or more precisely it contributed to that snarl. We inched along. I stared longingly at the mindless, blissful pedestrians who were enjoying fresh air and free space as they strode along sidewalks. There was a considerable temptation to get off at the next stop and walk. I practiced stoicism in an attempt to ignore the hot breath and penetrating stares of my fellow passengers. The idea of personal space had evaporated. Acts of movement were akin to wrestling. When the tram would suddenly break free of traffic, propelling forward at what seemed to be a thousand miles an hour for a few ecstatic seconds, I felt a sense of liberation. This was followed by the screech of brakes and bone rattling jolts. Another stoppage was at hand, but never lasted long enough to get comfortable. The Lviv Trams look like fun, until you get on one at the wrong time. Was this experience really what the Austro-Hungarian administrators had in mind when they made Lviv the first city in the empire to have an electric tram?\n\nFrom Innovation To Degeneration – The Persistence of Lviv’s Trams\n\nThe electric tram came to Lviv in 1894, four years before it was introduced to the imperial capital of Vienna. The arrival of this transport innovation in the largest city of the Empire’s poorest province was not coincidental. It was unveiled while the National Trade Fair took place in the city. The fair was a showcase of the newest scientific and engineering achievements. The first electric tram line went from the main railway station to Lychakivska. By the turn of the century Lviv had three electric tram lines, but the new did not entirely trump the old. For the first decade and a half of its existence the electric trams and the old horse drawn trams both functioned. Natural horsepower was finally phased out in 1912. It has taken even longer for Lviv to phase out its old electric trams. The city still owns several pre-World War I trams that are used for maintenance purposes.\n\nIt seems that when it comes to Lviv’s trams the new can never quite replace the old. This really is living history, with an added modern feature of several hundred thousand more passengers. There have been two changes of late that have increased the comfort of Lviv’s tram rides. One is the replacement of several trams with the sleek Electron trams. There are few things as mesmerizing as watching one of these trams snake its way through the cobblestoned Old City. Renaissance, Baroque and Space Age styles interact and intersect all at the same time. There has also been the rising use of the automobile in Lviv. Tram usage has dropped by over 40% since 1991. Still, 60 million people use the trams on average each year. On Line 7 traveling towards Yanivskyi, I felt the weight of those numbers. I shuttered to think how crowded the tram was during the Soviet era. That was mass movement.\n\nFrom Luxury to Necessity – A Truer Form of Travel\n\nThere comes a point in any less than desirable travel experience that one begins to question why they are doing it in the first place. Was Yanivskyi really going to be worth the bother? Why was I putting myself through this discomfort to visit a cemetery? That question turned out to be beside the point, since what I was really questioning was myself. What was I doing on this damn tram? I could have walked, taken a taxi or skipped the whole thing. In truth as intolerable as the situation was, I think this is what I really wanted. It is what I have always wanted. Travel for me is not supposed to be fair or comfortable or even fun. It enforces tolerance, patience and dealing with an endless litany of minor frustrations. It is a challenge, an affront to my personality. There is something pseudo-sadistic about this form of travel, but it almost always turns out to be enlightening.\n\nI was able to experience Lviv like a local. Life is not easy for those who call the city home. The tram is a necessity rather than a luxury. The one I rode on was also someone else’s car filled with 40 passengers, it was progress inching forward. It was the world of the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s stuck on repeat. It was the future that had barely left the station. It was an experience that was anything, but romantic and for me that made it all the more memorable. When the tram stopped at Yanivskyi, I exploded out the door and into the street. Finally I had arrived. I looked back at the tram, at the mass of humanity squeezed inside and thought to myself, now that was a trip.\n\n“Each moment of the past, after all, is full of what did not happen and what will probably never happen…It also contains what seemed impossible but proved possible.” – Timothy Snyder\n\nThis is about the book I will never write and a film that will never be made. It is about a house that possesses my imagination unlike any other house I have ever seen, a house that in my imagining was home to the greatest assassination plot of the 20th century. This assassination could have happened and should have happened. Yet tragically it did not. The failure to carry out the plot cost millions of people their lives. It could have changed history and by extension the world we live in today. What did not happen is nothing more than history that will never be known, a double negative. Tragically the world never was able to experience the assassination of both Hitler and Stalin on a crisp autumn night in 1939 when they met at the train station in Lviv. Most say they never met that evening, but a few believe they did. I am one of them. No one knows about the plot to assassinate them, other than me. I was not there at the time, I am only here now. I believe there was a plot conceived at the Ostroverkhova Villa in Lviv. The house is still there, but it is empty, as empty as the pages of history that will never mention what did not occur. There is now only silence in that villa where voices once plotted to save one world from another.\n\nA Villa and Villains – The Untold Story\n\nThe Ostroverkhova Villa (also known as the Villa on the Cross because it stands at the intersection of three streets: General Chuprynky, Kyiv and Kotlyarevsky) first came to my attention when I stumbled upon it while wandering around lost in the Kastelivka district of Lviv. It is fabulously situated, placed on a corner separate from any other buildings, surrounded by what are supposed to be gardens. Due to neglect, the grounds have deteriorated. This gives the building a fin-de-siècle look and feel. The villa was constructed right at the turn of the 20th century. Much of its uniqueness comes from the neo-romantic flourishes that are rarely found in such a small scale, single-family structure. It has a six sided tower with tiling. The façade contains ceramic decorative ornamentation. The tower gives it a regal presence, the decorative work a festive folksiness and the slowly degrading exterior a gloomy, ominous feeling. Time passed it by long ago, but the villa managed to spin time backwards for me, taking my imagination back to the latter part of 1939, just after the first act had closed in what was to become the worst war in human history.\n\nMany years ago, in a fit of maniacal egotism I conceptualized what I believed would be the greatest story never told. The stimulus came from a few pages in Edvard Radzinsky’s Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia’s Secret Archives. In those pages Radzinsky replicated a letter from the Director of the American FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, stating that Hitler and Stalin met secretly in Lvov (the Russian name for Lviv) on October 17, 1939. At this meeting they were said to have signed a secret military treaty. The genesis of this story comes from a railroad worker who spoke about it 33 years after the fact. The man might have been a lunatic or a liar, a weaver of outlandish tales. In addition, anything that has Hoover’s name on it is suspect, since he was a man known for deceit, duplicity and innumerable lies. The meeting could not have happened, could it? It seems impossible. Is anything really impossible when it comes to the world of the imagination? Of course they met that evening, their trains pulling into the station under heavy security. A small nation’s worth of men under arms, men who would be killing each other less than two years later, surrounded every nook, cranny and corridor of Lviv’s train station that evening. First Hitler’s train arrived. Then he waited on Stalin. Stalin always made people wait, whether it was Hitler or the rest of the world. His tardiness was as predictable as the German’s punctuality. Stalin’s train finally arrived an hour late. It came to a screaming, steaming halt. A few minutes later, surrounded by armed guards, Hitler and Stalin made their way to a separate, detached train car. After an exchange of laconic and insincere pleasantries the two men got down to making peace so they could prosecute war.\n\nPlot Points – The Moment When There Was Nothing Left To Wait For\n\nLittle did either realize their life should have ended at that very moment. Where did the threat come from? It had been planned and plotted for months by several people working out of the Ostroverkhova villa. There is no documentation of this, there never will be. The conspirators worked in secret, coming and going in seemingly random fashion from the villa. They came and went much like those famous and forgotten, suspected and arrested who had lived there since the villa’s construction. There was the Polish mathematician and academic Zaslav Dzivinsky, there had been a couple of Jewish inhabitants, Shulim Wallach who made his fortune as a merchant and another followed by Leopold Muenzer who gained his fame as a pianist. Then there was the Ukrainian journalist and activist, Vladimir Kuzmovich. The conspirators were a microcosm of these men who had lived there in the years before. They shared their same diverse ethnic backgrounds, their belief in freedom and capitalism.\n\nThey also shared a fear for their lives. As intelligentsia, as anything other than Soviets or Fascists, they were marked men with time a ticking bomb, that was about to explode their lives. They were Poles, Ukrainians and Jews, a motley assemblage of conspirators. Natural and national foes brought together by a common goal, to kill two psychopathic dictators before they murdered even more innocents than they already had. Foresight is a strange gift, to see a future of camps and mass graves, late night knocks on the door, the trusted becoming traitors, and the traitors becoming the betrayed, to see that mass murder will stalk the streets of every village and city, that entire nations will be consumed by flames, takes more than a leap of imagination. It takes a deeply embedded belief that the most horrible things are certain to happen, that they are inevitable and that it is just a matter of time. And that belief propels the will to action. It was time to try to save millions because the point at which it would be too late had almost arrived. The moment had arrived when there was nothing left to wait for.\n\nTo Save One World From Another – Moment Of Surrender\n\nIf only they had not trusted that one man the way they trusted each other. That Nikolai Ostroverkhov was quite the man. He collected so many beautiful works of art. How he managed to acquire all those pieces was always open to question. He was so shrewd, so suave, so sophisticated. It was as though he walked right out of one of those beautiful paintings he had hung on the villa’s walls. He hung those paintings, the same way the conspirators would later be hanged, with savage delicacy. Ostroverkhov was like a force of nature. He always got what he wanted, but no one could ever quite figure out how he got it. Who was he working for? Which side was he on? He had as many sides as that tower which soared above the villa. He also had at least that many contradictions. In that world who could you trust? Ostroverkhov was as good or bad as anyone else or so he made them believe. Right up until the last time they saw him, which was the last time they saw each other.\n\nThey met that evening at the villa. The first time they had all been together in the same room. The plan was sound yet simple. There was a map, there was a bomb. Everyone was dressed in Soviet secret police uniforms. Their documents were correct in their incorrectness. Months of planning would all come down to a few minutes of execution. Execution was the key. This night like so many nights to come in Lviv would be all about execution. They were ready for this and Ostroverkhov made sure the enemy was ready for them. As he bid them farewell, they opened the door, their look of dead seriousness suddenly turned to one of terrifying surprise. They walked right into the outstretched arms of the NKVD. In that moment the possibility of one world ended and a new, more horrible one continued to be born. When it finally came to life, it would mean the death of millions, an impossible thing to imagine. Almost as impossible as the plot to save one world from another that was conceived at an old and crumbling villa in the Kastelivka District of Lviv."
