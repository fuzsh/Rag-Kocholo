        "text": "Historical reference\n\nIn the X century the lands of the region territory were part of the Kyivan Rus’. In 1084, the Precarpathian territory was divided and split into the separate principalities (Peremyshl, Zvenygorod, Terebovlyansky) by Yaroslav the Wise`s descendants. As a result of their reunion in 1141 Volodymyr Volodarovych (Volodymyrko) formed the Principality of Halych (later adopted as Galicia) with its center in Halych.\n\nIn 1199, Roman Mstyslavovych, Prince Volynsky, was invited to the Galician throne.\n\nThis unification gave rise to the mighty Principality of Galicia-Volhynia, which lasted until 1349, undergoing attacks of Hungarians, the hordes of Batu Khan and Poles, and in 1387 it fully passed under the power of the Polish Kingdom.\n\nAt first, the political and administrative division established by the Principality of Galicia-Volhynia was preserved here, in the XV century the Russian Voivodship was formed. The region’s territory was included into the Galician and partially (Dolynsky and Kalush districts) to the Lviv lands of this voivodship. The reinforcement of national and social oppression in 1490 led to a large peasant uprising under the Mukha leadership with more than 10 thousand people participating in it.\n\nIn 1498 the Precarpathian region was attacked by Crimean Tatars and Turks for the first time. On May 7, 1662 the Stanislaviv city received the Magdeburg Law. In the late ХVІІ – first half of the ХVІІI century the region’s territory became the center of the Opryshky movement against Polish domination (at that period Oleksa Dovbush became famous).\n\nDuring the first division of Poland (1772), the lands of Ukrainian Precarpathia retreated to Austria and, together with the Polish territories, were artificially united into the kingdom of Galicia and Volodymyrii, with its center in Lviv city.\n\nTwelve districts comprised the so-called eastern (Ukrainian) part of Galicia. The lands of modern Ivano-Frankivsk region were included into four different districts – Berezhany, Stryi, Kolomyia (since 1811), and Stanislav district. In 1848, during the “spring of nation”, the lands of Stanislav district suffered a wave of massive peasant protest against the Austrian authorities.\n\nOn November 1, 1918, an independent Ukrainian state with a capital in Lviv city was formed on the wreckages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was called the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic (ZUNR). After the capture of Lviv city by Poles, the government of a young republic firstly moved to the Ternopil city, and in late December – to the Stanislav city, which became the capital of ZUNR for 5 months. The Act of Unification between ZUNR and UPR, proclaimed in Kiev on January 22, 1919, was signed exactly here.\n\nThe period of the sovereign Ukrainian state existence was short and changed by new occupation of the Eastern Galicia by Polish troops. Since 1921 the Stanislav city became the center of the Voivodship as part of Poland. It covered the modern territory of Ivano-Frankivsk region, as well as the Zhydachiv and Stryj districts (lands, that belong to Lviv region now).\n\nIn September 1939, the territory of the Western Ukraine was joined to the Ukrainian SSR and on December 4, the Stanislav region was formed in its present-day borders. On November 9, 1962, during the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Stanislav city, the regional center was renamed to Ivano-Frankivsk, and the region – to Ivano-Frankivsk. In August 1995 a monument in honor of Ivan Franko was installed on one of the central city`s squares.\n\nIvano-Frankivsk region is a land with extremely rich cultural traditions. A great contribution to the formation of regional cultural values was made by well-known personalities who lived and worked here: a bishop Andrei Sheptytskyi, writers and poets – Ivan Franko, Adam Mickiewycz, Ivan Vagylevych, Marko Cheremshyna, Vasyl Stefanyk, Les Martovych, Taras Melnychuk, composer Denys Sichynskyi, political activist Stepan Bandera.\n\nMore than three and a half thousand historical and cultural monuments are taken under the state protection on the territory of the region. Among them there are such well-known and valuable monuments as Panteleimon’s Church near Halych (XII century), the Holy Spirit Church in Rogatyn (XVI century), Maniavskyi Skyt (XVII century), Bishops chambers in Krylos (XVIII-XIX centuries).\n\nThe unique Pysanka (Easter Eggs) museum is created in Kolomyia city, where the bright, deep and mysterious art of pysanka painting, reaching by its roots to the pre-Christian times, is presented.\n\nSeveral ethnographic groups of Ukrainians live in the region: boiky, hutsuly, lemky, pokutiany and opiliany. Each of them has their own unique linguistic and musical features, rituals, clothes, architecture, etc.\n\nInternational folk festivals of Hutsuls, Lemkis, “Boykivska Vatra”, “Christmas in the Carpathians” and ethnic music in Sheshory are annually hold in region.\n\nIvano-Frankivsk region is a place of holding the choral music festival named after D.Sichynskyi, piano competition named after Barvinskyi, festivals of puppet theaters and artistic planners.\n\nSince 1939 the stationary Ukrainian Music and Drama Theater named after I.Franko and the Philharmonic have been operating in the Ivano-Frankivsk city. In general, there are 25 museums in the region, including local history and artistic museums.\n\nIn 1940, the first Institute in the region was founded – State Teachers’ Institute, now –Precarpathian National University named after V. Stefanyk. Medical Institute (State Medical University nowadays) was created in Ivano-Frankivsk city in 1954. Ivano-Frankivsk Institute of Oil and Gas, founded in 1966 on the basis of the Lviv Polytechnic Institute branch – is the only university in Ukraine that trains engineers for the oil and gas industry. In 1994 the Institute received the status of Ivano-Frankivsk Technical University of Oil and Gas, and in 2001 the status of the National."
