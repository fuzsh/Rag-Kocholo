        "text": "As Kurt Schneller recollected, it was the policy of the Austrian general staff to avoid overt lies and to prepare the population for bad news when it was known that such news was imminent. Schneller was on duty on the morning of 2 September 1914, and he acted accordingly. He knew that the Austro-Hungarian Second Army had been defeatedFootnote 1 and had already begun to evacuate Lviv, but he received no information about the Russians having captured the city, so he issued a communique that was to become proverbial in Austria: Lemberg noch in unserem Besitz Footnote 2—“Lemberg is still ours.” The Russian army entered Lviv the next day after a delay caused by preparations to attack the city's fortifications, which were in fact already abandoned by the Austrians. Thus began the occupation, which was to last for 293 days.\n\nIn this article I focus on narrative accounts on the occupation by ten authorsFootnote 3 who belonged to the cultural and political elite of the city. Stanisław Rossowski (1861–1940), Jan Zieliński (1862–1919), Maria van Gember (1858–1915?), Józef Białynia Chołodecki (1852–1934), and Stanisław Maciszewski were journalists and literati; Marceli Chlamtacz (1865–1947), a lawyer; Aleksander Czołowski (1865–1944), a historian; and Adolf Beck (1863–1942), a physician, were professors of the John Casimir University in Lviv (in the interwar period Chlamtacz served as Lviv's vice-mayor, and CzołowskiFootnote 4 as the director of the municipal archive and museum); Bohdan Janusz (1889–1930) was an archaeologist, ethnographer, and journalist; and Stanisław Przyłuski (1852–1944) served as a vice president of the Galician higher (appeal) court.\n\nMy selection of authors is limited, but I believe they are representative of the Polish urban intelligentsia of Lviv: the people who considered themselves the true voice of the city, entitled to speak on behalf of the entire population because of their social status, education, and engagement in local politics and various form of social and cultural activism. As I shall demonstrate, one of the aspects of all my selected narratives is precisely that they claim to represent “the city of Lviv,” which was in fact the opinion of its Polish elite. Some of my authors were indeed colleagues, and for men of their status, participation in a number of charitable, cultural, and scholarly public initiatives was a must. Given this, I believe it likely that all of them met at least once.Footnote 5 Maria Gember was probably an exception in this respect, but her account of the occupation is a remarkable fit with the others, making the coherence of their voices even more noteworthy.Footnote 6\n\nThe narratives under analysis belong to a genre that, as far as I know, has no proper name and yet is as old as history itself: descriptions of historical events witnessed firsthand by the authors, who provide accounts of what they believe should be made public and remembered, quite like Thucydides did. The difference between this kind of narrative and so-called ego-documents is thin but not negligible: these superego-documents intend to tell a story that is larger than individual memory, a part of the collective experience—that is, history. And indeed, as I shall demonstrate, my authors’ accounts of the occupation are similar enough to be considered as representative of a collective experience (or, more precisely, the perception thereof) of the educated Polish elite of Lviv.\n\nThe first of the narratives I have selected was published in Vienna in 1915, when Lviv was still occupied; the last was edited in 1935. The idea of commemorating the occupation was partly a response to appeals in the local press, which also resulted in the publication of a selection of documents produced by the occupants.Footnote 7 Lviv was the only major Austrian city occupied by the enemy. In light of all the dramatic events of World War I, however—including the violence that occurred in the Galician countryside—the occupation was a relatively undramatic episode.Footnote 8 Moreover, it was soon overshadowed by the Polish-Ukrainian war of 1918–19 (three weeks of fighting within the city and the subsequent six-month siege by Ukrainian forces)Footnote 9 and the Polish-Soviet war of 1920 (when Polish and Ukrainian forces defended the city against Bolshevik attack). The bloody struggles for the city during that time gave rise to a pan-national Polish myth of a heroic Lviv (Polish: Lwów) that resulted in hundreds of patriotic publications.Footnote 10 The Russian occupation could not be easily incorporated into this national mythology, and this is perhaps why it has been largely forgotten after World War II. However, as my narratives demonstrate, the image of the occupation remained essentially unchanged for twenty years, and its memory was cultivated because it was regarded as constitutive for the identity of the Polish intelligentsia of Lviv. To sum up, my selected narratives, I argue, are quite revealing about the state of mind of this group—their sense of belonging, their morality, and their combination of local and national patriotism, as well as Habsburg loyalties in Austria-Hungary's final years. Of course, they are also telling as far as the realities of this unique occupation are concerned.\n\nThe Russian occupation of Lviv has so far been studied by only a few scholars, most notably Christoph Mick,Footnote 11 Mark von Hagen,Footnote 12 and Alexander Prusin,Footnote 13 and its literary reminiscences by Alois Woldan.Footnote 14 They have all focused on the bitter national rivalries in the city and in Eastern Galicia in general (and the violence and suffering they caused), and the problem of to whom the city and the region should belong: the Austrians, Russians, Poles, or Ukrainians. However, while these studies do make reference to the majority of the narratives under study, in fact their authors regarded such questions—and the experiences of any other national or social group but their own—only marginally, and this is probably why the scholars studying the occupation made limited use of them."
