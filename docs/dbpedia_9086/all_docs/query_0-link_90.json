        "text": "Galicia usually is named together with Lodomeria. The kingdom of Galicia is named after the royal and orthodox archbishops seat Halicz (Galich) on the Dnestr some 100 km S.E. of Lviv. On this kingdom the Hungarian kings had a claim. The kingdom of Ruthenia is a successor of Galicia ruled by the local kings from the House of Rurik. On this part the Polish kings had a claim. The centre of power was in Lviv (Lvov, Lemberg), a Roman Catholic diocese after 1412.\n\nThe principality of Wladimir, (not to be confused with the principality of Wladimir Suzdal east of Moscow) is named after the orthodox seat of the city of Wladimir (Wladimir Volinskij) on about 110 km north of Lviv. In the twelfth century the kingdom itself was at the upper course of the Bug. Wladimir was corrupted to Lodomeria in latin. Lodomeria is a part of the Hungarian royal title since 1235.\n\nThe princes from the House of Rurik and the Polish Kings\n\nIn the early middle ages the territory around the upper course of the Dnjestr belonged initially to the Empire of Kiev. At the end of the 12th century it was a principality called after the capital Galich founded by prince Volodymyrko (1124-'53). Volodymyrko submitted himself to Byzantium to protect his country against the Hungarian attacks. Afterwards the relations between Galicia and Byzantium were always good.\n\nThe grandson of Voloymyrko, Volodymyr, died in 1199 without issue. He was succeeded by Roman of Wolhynia who united Wolhynia and Galicia and the ancestor of the Romanovic dynasty which would rule the united principalities with interruptions until 1323\n\nAfter the death of Roman in 1205 a serious crisis of succession broke out because is two sons were oly three and five years of age. The galician bojars took\n\nthe opportunity to chase away the ruling family and choose princes which they could handle. In 1214 Hungary and Poland interfered in a common action and appointed Koloman, a son of the Hungarian king Andreas as a prince. He had to give way to Mstislav of Novgorod in 1219 but could return after his death in 1228.\n\nIn the Clipearius Teutonicorum the arms of Koloman are described, be it from his first or from his second rule (-1237). The quote reads:\n\nPileus in niveo clipeo rubet estque Rutheni\n\nRegis, gens cuius procul est a littore Reni\n\nwhich can be translated with: A hat (or pilum = spear) shines red in the white shield of the king of the Russians whose people lives so far from the borders of the Rhine. [1]\n\nThis coat of arms disappeared with Koloman.\n\nIn the mean time the oldest son of Roaman, Daniel, was married with the daughter of Mstislav and had started together with his father in law to restore the Galician-Wolhynian empire. In 1237 he succeeded to chase away Koloman and to retake the throne. The Hungarian kings have never abandoned their claims on both principalities and have called themselves always GALICIE LODOMERIE REX (the latin names for Galcia and Wolhynia).\n\nLike the other Russian principalities Daniel had to recognize the suzerainty of the Tatar empire of the Golden Horde, founded in 1241 in spite of that there were no tatar watchers in his country. In 1245 he was summoned to Sarai at the lower course of the Wolga where he was confirmed as the prince of the Galician-Wolhynian principalities.\n\nNevertheless Daniel conducted a policy against the Tatars. Within that framework he fortified his cities in a western fashion. At the same time he founded the new cities of Lviv and Chelm. In the donjon near the last city a large stone was build into on which a large crowned two-headed eagle was carved. About this eagle the Ipatievski chronicle writes:\n\nOn a mile from the city is a donjon of brick on which is a carved eagle; and the height of the eagle is 10 yards with the heads and with its supports 12 yards (1 yard/ell = here about 62 cm.) The chronicle also mentions that a byzantine architect named Audios had built Chelm cathedral. For that reason it is quite possible that he has also built the donjon and is responsible for the two-headed eagle. [2]\n\nIn this quote we are informed for the first time that a Galician prince makes use of a heraldic emblem. In this case it is an emblem which was used by very high-ranking Byzantine officials in particular by Byzantien despots, officials occupying an almost sovereign position but still subordinated to Byzantium. Sometimes the were related by marriage to the emperor. The two-headed eagle of Chelm can be explained by the traditionally good relations of the House of Romanovic with Byzantium to which they were subordinated in any case.\n\nThe relations with the Hohenstaufen had also always been good. Roman had even fallen in a battle when he ran to help Roman king Philip of Swabia against Leszek the White who belonged to the Guelph-papal party. Also the Hohenstaufen were the natural allies against the Hungarians who traditionally belonged to the papal party. At the moment of the appearance of the two-headed eagle in Galicia the emperors Frederick II and John III Vatatzes conducted joined politics to restore the union of the Roman Empire. These were directed against the Latin Empire and its patron the Pope of Rome.\n\nIn his ìnternational politics Daniel took a turn when, after the death of the last Babenberg in Austria in 1246 he presented himself as the rival of Przemysl Ottokar as a candidate for the succession in the duchy. For that reason he made an alliance with the Pope and Hungary against the Bohemian king and his ally Frederick II. In spite of this his policy did not succeed because Hungary quit on the decisive moment.\n\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250 and during the reign of the Roman King William of Holland Pope Innocent IV (1243-54) sent a nuncio to Daniel who crowned him in Dorohychyn a king of the Rus. This would have been the moment for the adoption of a coat of arms of the model of the coats of arms of the western princes with which he had had so much to do in the preceding years. No document however is known proving that that was indeed the case. Its lasts until the reign of his grandson George I (1301-15) before a coat of arms of a Galician prince appeared. It is on his equestrian seal and it is a lion apparently the coat of arms of the House of Wolhynia.\n\nThe Russian territory may have been annexated by king Casimir the Great but it has been very difficult to subjugate the Ruthenes, the more because the king of Hunary was active in the region, referring to the claims dating from the time of Koloman. In 1366 a new campaign was necessary and the successor of Casimir, the son of his sister Elisabeth, Louis of Anjou, had to capture the region all again. After his death in 1382 the region was lost again but it was recaptured by Sigismund of Luxemburg, married with the heiress of Louis in Hungary, his daughter Mary. Sigismund in this way defended the rights of his sister in law Hedwig who had become a queen of Poland in 1384. After Poland and Lithuania had been united in a personal union by the marriage of Hedwig and Jagiello (Wladislaw), Grand duke of Lithuania, Ruthenia was recaptured from Sigismund in 1387. Nevertheless Sigismund maintained his claim on the region and this was continued by most of his successors in Hungary.\n\nBy King Wladislaw II of Poland (1386-1434) the voivodate was abolished. The arms of the territory or merely the arms of his claim on the territory is on his seal dated 1388. It is: Azure, a lion rampant Or against a precipice Argent. [9]\n\nArms of the Heir of Russia (Ruthenia)\n\nOn the seal of King Wladislaw, 1388\n\nArms: Lion rampant and precipice. The corresponding legend reads: ... HES RUSS. (Heir of Russia)\n\nDuring his reign the arms of three territories of Russia were represented in the Bergshammer Armorial. [10] They are the arms of Halics (Galicia), Ruthenia and Lemberg. [11]\n\nWhen exactly Matthias has renewed his claim is uncertain but a coat pf arms for Galicia appears on his seal cut at the occasion of his marriage with a Neapoltan princess in 1475. On this seal are their arms in alliance surrounded by other arms of the territories of the Hungarian monarchy amongst which are the arms with two crowns which can be considered to be the arms of Galicia. Not long afterwards also a version of these arms is represented with three crowns. [15] There is no explanation for the change but probably the arms are meant to be of Galicia and Lodomeria, the thrid crown being for Lodomeria.\n\nAfter the death of Matthias Hungary was ruled by Jagellon Kings until 1526 and the claim on Galicia seems to have been withdrawn. This changed when Louis II was succeeded by Ferdinand I of Habsburg. On his seal, used from 1531 until 1549 there is the coat of arms with two crowns again. Also, a coat of arms for Lodomeria occurs for the first time here. It is [Azure] of two fesses compony [Argent and Gules]. [16]\n\nThe arms with the two crowns were also on the seal of John Zapolyai, rival king of Hungary.[17]\n\nÅ Arms of Galicia.\n\nIn the margin of a manuscript from the 2nd. half 15th cent now in Prague."
