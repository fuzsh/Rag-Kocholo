        "text": "00:04\n\nDirect Talk\n\n00:08\n\nThis is the city of Lviv in western Ukraine.\n\n00:12\n\nPeople are pouring into the city\n\nas fierce fighting with Russian forces\n\n00:16\n\ncontinue in the eastern parts of the country.\n\n00:20\n\nOleksandr Fraze-Frazenko\n\nPoet, Musician, Filmmaker\n\n00:21\n\nOleksandr Fraze-Frazenko is a poet\n\nand a musician who lives here.\n\n00:31\n\nHe started creating rap songs\n\n00:33\n\ncalling for resistance to Russia\n\nwhen the war broke out.\n\n00:37\n\nI don't care what your name is.\n\nPutin Lenin or Stalin.\n\n00:41\n\nI don't care if it's dark.\n\nI don't care if I'm delirious.\n\n00:49\n\nUkraine has historically\n\n00:50\n\nfaced threats from its eastern neighbor\n\n00:53\n\nFrazenko says\n\nthe current struggle with Russia\n\n00:56\n\nis about defending not just his country,\n\n01:00\n\nbut the rest of Europe.\n\n01:04\n\nThe hope is to become visible\n\nfor Europe and for the Western world.\n\n01:11\n\nThey should accept the fact\n\n01:13\n\nthat we are the cradle\n\nof the European culture in a way.\n\n01:24\n\nHe speaks to the world\n\n01:26\n\nfor people to realize more about\n\nwhat is currently happening in Ukraine.\n\n01:31\n\nUkraine as the Breakwater for Europe\n\n01:36\n\nLviv, Ukraine\n\n01:38\n\nAir raid sirens go off in Lviv\n\n01:40\n\nalmost every day.\n\n01:42\n\nOn February 24th,\n\n01:44\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\n\n01:46\n\nannounced the start of\n\na military operation in eastern Ukraine.\n\n01:50\n\nWhen this was announced Frazenko was spending\n\ntime with his family in Lviv as usual.\n\n01:59\n\nThat was a regular day.\n\n02:01\n\nMy son just woke up.\n\n02:05\n\nWe were preparing for the kindergarten.\n\n02:09\n\nThen, we heard the sirens.\n\n02:14\n\nMy feeling was calm\n\n02:15\n\nbecause...\n\n02:19\n\nprediction, it's not the right word,\n\n02:21\n\nbut if you learn history,\n\n02:23\n\nyou know that\n\ncertain things happen at certain times.\n\n02:28\n\nThe time is circular,\n\nso it will happen again.\n\n02:32\n\nI had that feeling that...\n\n02:36\n\nsometime Russia would try\n\nto invade Ukraine\n\n02:41\n\nbecause they already did\n\nduring the First World War,\n\n02:44\n\nduring the Second World War.\n\n02:47\n\nHe says Russians can't tell the difference\n\n02:50\n\nbetween the Ukrainian pronunciation\n\nof strawberry and bread.\n\n02:54\n\nIt's how he expresses resistance.\n\n02:56\n\nKlubnika palyanista\n\n(Strawberry bread)\n\n03:11\n\nKlubnika palyanista\n\n(Strawberry bread)\n\n03:14\n\nShoot my gun\n\n03:16\n\nKlubnika palyanista\n\n(Strawberry bread)\n\n03:18\n\nMy frontline is the different frontline.\n\n03:21\n\nIt's the frontline of ideas.\n\n03:25\n\nIf you are an artist, for example, as I am,\n\n03:28\n\nyou should do art.\n\n03:34\n\nIf you are an artist,\n\n03:35\n\npeople used to listen to you,\n\n03:38\n\nwhat do you think,\n\nwhat do you think about something?\n\n03:40\n\nYou can try to think about stuff\n\n03:44\n\nand make up some ideas,\n\n03:46\n\nsome statements.\n\n03:52\n\nFrazenko was born in Lviv\n\n03:54\n\nthat has various ethnic groups\n\nincluding Jewish and French backgrounds.\n\n03:59\n\nHe loved writing poetry\n\nsince he was a young boy.\n\n04:07\n\nHe became a student of a renowned poet\n\n04:09\n\nand began creating his own pieces.\n\n04:12\n\nIhor Kalynets\n\nPoet\n\n04:16\n\nIt started to build up a friendship between\n\n04:20\n\nthe old classic poet and a young boy.\n\n04:25\n\nFrom that time, I knew that\n\nI want to be in poetry.\n\n04:31\n\nYears after, I realized that\n\n04:35\n\npoetry is the most powerful way\n\nof expressing in art\n\n04:41\n\nbecause the distance\n\nbetween the sparkling idea\n\n04:48\n\nand the realization of this idea,\n\n04:53\n\nthe product, is too short.\n\n04:55\n\nSo short.\n\n04:57\n\nIt cannot evaporate during the realization.\n\n05:01\n\nI thought that that's\n\nthe recipe for the great piece of art.\n\n05:12\n\nFrazenko likes the works of Taras Shevchenko,\n\n05:16\n\nwho is considered a pioneer\n\nin modern Ukrainian literature.\n\n05:22\n\nShevchenko spent 10 years in exile for writing\n\na poem critical of the Russian emperor.\n\n05:29\n\nShevchenko as a figure is\n\nsome kind of a symbol of Ukrainian liberation\n\n05:35\n\nbecause he used to live in the czar's castle\n\nalmost half of his life.\n\n05:43\n\nThe first part of his life, he was a slave.\n\n05:47\n\nThen, he started to write poems\n\nabout Ukrainian liberation\n\n05:54\n\nbased on stories that\n\nhe got from his grandpa,\n\n05:59\n\nbecause his grandpa used to be a Cossack\n\n06:02\n\nand used to fight for Ukrainian liberation\n\n06:05\n\nagainst Russians\n\n06:10\n\nand against Polish people.\n\n06:13\n\nAnd he became the symbol of this liberation.\n\n06:20\n\nHe will always be this\n\nconnection point for Ukrainians.\n\n06:27\n\nFrazenko began writing poetry,\n\n06:30\n\nbut faced a big hurdle.\n\n06:36\n\nI was always fascinated in modernist poetry,\n\n06:43\n\nsurrealist poetry.\n\n06:45\n\nI could not find anything like this\n\nin the Ukrainian poetry.\n\n06:50\n\nI was wondering \"why?\"\n\n06:52\n\nThen, I realized that it was prohibited\n\n06:55\n\nto write something like that\n\nin Ukraine during the Soviet period\n\n07:00\n\nbecause you are going to\n\ngo to jail for that\n\n07:03\n\njust because your thoughts are\n\ntoo dark to the Soviet men.\n\n07:10\n\nI started to look for those guys.\n\n07:13\n\nI found them.\n\n07:15\n\nThose poets that escaped the Soviet Union\n\nduring the First World War,\n\n07:21\n\nand also children of people that escaped\n\nthe Soviet Union during the Second World War,\n\n07:27\n\nand found themselves in the US,\n\n07:32\n\nespecially in New York, in Manhattan.\n\n07:36\n\nYuriy Tarnawsky\n\nPoet\n\n07:38\n\nFrazenko moved to New York in 2015.\n\n07:41\n\nThere he met poets who were\n\nin search of creative freedom\n\n07:46\n\nafter being persecuted\n\nin the former Soviet Union.\n\n07:54\n\nI started to read those poems.\n\n07:59\n\nThey just fascinated me right away.\n\n08:03\n\nThey decided we are not\n\ngoing to write in English.\n\n08:07\n\nThey decided we should build\n\na Ukrainian literature away from Ukraine,\n\n08:13\n\nbecause no one will if we give up.\n\n08:20\n\nFranzeko produced a film about them.\n\n08:25\n\nThe Story of New York Group of Poets\n\n08:31\n\nThe piece depicts the strong feelings\n\nof the poets for their homeland.\n\n08:38\n\nOur culture is very specific.\n\nIt is still shock so to speak\n\n08:43\n\nWe are traumatized by years of thralldom,\n\ncommunism.\n\n08:48\n\nCommunism broke everything.\n\n08:52\n\nThey started to make\n\nsome shows, gigs and stuff,\n\n08:56\n\njust to promote that idea\n\nthat Ukrainian literature is alive\n\n09:01\n\nand it's up to date,\n\n09:02\n\nand it's working.\n\n09:04\n\nWhen I realized that\n\nthose guys made this thing,\n\n09:08\n\nI immediately felt that those are my guys.\n\n09:12\n\nThat that's my roots.\n\n09:23\n\nSo this one is my last one.\n\n09:25\n\nIt's bilingual.\n\n09:26\n\nIt's published in New York Queens.\n\n09:32\n\nFrazenko divides his time\n\nbetween New York and Lviv.\n\n09:37\n\nHe believes the world needs to know\n\nmore about how Russia\n\n09:41\n\nis trying to erase\n\nUkraine's history and culture.\n\n09:46\n\nThey should realize that\n\nyou cannot steal a culture.\n\n09:51\n\nYou cannot steal the name of the country.\n\n09:55\n\nYou cannot steal the heritage and stuff\n\n09:59\n\nand just go away with this.\n\n10:02\n\nPeople will know.\n\n10:05\n\nPeople will understand what's happening.\n\n10:08\n\nRight now, it starts to grow.\n\n10:14\n\nLviv is an ancient medieval city\n\n10:17\n\nthat's also a World Heritage Site.\n\n10:20\n\nIt was ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire\n\n10:24\n\nand Poland.\n\n10:25\n\nand it became part of\n\nthe Soviet Union after World War 2.\n\n10:35\n\nLviv used to be the capital\n\nof the biggest kingdom in Europe,\n\n10:41\n\nGalician kingdom, during the times of\n\nKing Danilo and King Schwerner.\n\n10:49\n\nThen, Lviv used to be the capital of\n\n10:53\n\none of the biggest regions\n\nin Austrian-Hungarian Empire.\n\n11:38\n\nWe used to protect Europe\n\nfrom Eastern invaders\n\n11:42\n\nduring the centuries.\n\n11:49\n\nAll that progress that Europe used to have,\n\n11:56\n\nit's because of us,\n\n11:57\n\nbecause we used to be the border between\n\nEurope and the Eastern part of the world.\n\n12:06\n\nRight now, Europe should realize that\n\n12:09\n\nthis is the time when we need a favor back.\n\n12:16\n\nIn a way, they tried to help us.\n\n12:20\n\nThe focus should be different\n\n12:24\n\nbecause they should understand\n\nthat they don't help us.\n\n12:29\n\nThey help themselves.\n\n12:32\n\nBecause we are a part of them.\n\n12:38\n\nIf they help us,\n\n12:40\n\nthey help themselves\n\nnot to be struck by Russians.\n\n12:51\n\nFrazenko read part of a poem he wrote in 2010\n\n12:55\n\nwhen he traveled to the\n\nsouthern Ukrainian port city of Odessa.\n\n13:05\n\nThis is hunting for tigers you can't see,\n\nThis is a long avenue lined with empty chests.\n\n13:11\n\nI believe in the abyss and am drawn to a country where\n\nthe throats of birds would be full of sand in the summer.\n\n13:18\n\nAnd in the winter rivers freeze to the very bottom,\n\nand fish don't grow old until the spring.\n\n13:30\n\nFrazenko now supports young volunteers who\n\nsend supplies to Kiev and eastern Ukraine.\n\n13:41\n\nHe hopes that the war\n\nwill soon come to an end\n\n13:44\n\nand left us with these words.\n\n13:51\n\nWe are Ukrainians.\n\n13:54\n\nI have too many roots in me,\n\n13:58\n\ntoo many bloods â\n\n14:00\n\nFrench, Jewish, Ukrainian,\n\nGalician, and so on.\n\n14:07\n\nI feel that I am Galician,\n\n14:11\n\nbut I have a Ukrainian passport.\n\n14:14\n\nI am connected to that idea of the country.\n\n14:18\n\nThe spirit of Ukrainians\n\nis the best in hard times.\n\n14:26\n\nIt's because Ukraine was\n\nborn in hard times, right.\n\n14:30\n\nThe best way to activate Ukraine is\n\nto have some problems for them.\n\n14:38\n\nThey just feel so natural in hard times."
