        "text": "Citadel Inn Hotel & Resort was constructed during the historic reign of the United Kingdomâ€™s famed Queen Victoria, who sat on the British throne from 1837 to 1901.\n\nOriginally known as Fort II, Citadel Inn Hotel & Resort truly boasts a vibrant past. The fort was built by the Austrian government at a time when the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire was threatened by the territorial disintegration due to internal revolts. To ensure the security of the empire, the government ordered a citadel to be built in each capital city in hopes to deter any resistance. Lviv's citadel included a structure called Maximilian Tower designed by Austrian arch-duke Maximilian d'Este to increase protection. Its effectiveness was proved during the defense of the new Linz fortress in Upper Austria. Today, the tower is a landmark that greets visitors to Lviv and the best example of military architecture from the 19th century.\n\nCitadel Inn Hotel & Resort today is a revival of the royal hospitality and majestic traditions of the authentic imperial luxury. This amazing historic destination is truly a living reminder of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The hotel allows guests to view Lviv from a unique perspective: a modern city center destination with a 19th century experience."
