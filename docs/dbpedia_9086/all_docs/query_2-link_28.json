        "text": "This is a hand drawn map of Lviv’s city center from 1777. It is one of the first maps of the city from when the city was under Austrian rule.\n\nThe author of the map is Josepho Daniele de Huber.\n\nThe special feature of this map is that it shows the city with the fortifications from the Middle Ages.\n\nLegend:\n\nIn the upper right corner is the name: “Capital or Major City Lviv” (Hauptstadt Lemberg).\n\nIn the upper right corner of the map is a graphic depiction of the map’s scale and a note that 7½ Viennese inches in the map is equal to 150 Viennese fathoms (Masstab von 150 Wiener Klaftern oder von 7½ Ordinäiren Zoll) [12], p. 221; next to that is the wind rose.\n\nIn the upper right corner is information about the author Josepho Daniele de Huber (Leve et Deo Josepho Daniele de Huber) and the year 1777.\n\nCharacterization of the map:\n\nThe map was drawn using ink and gouache.\n\nThe map is on a 140x90 cm. sheet of paper that is glued on a fabric backing. [78], p. 561\n\nThe map contains detailed configurations of some structures and fortifications around the city including: walls, ramparts, towers and gates.\n\nThe map shows how land was parceled out.\n\nMost buildings have their building numbers noted.\n\nBuildings in the city center and in the outlying areas are numbered separately.\n\nDistricts are not demarcated.\n\nAll the wording on the map is in German.\n\nMap's toponymics:\n\nNearly 146 objects are included:\n\nAdministrative buildings (3)\n\nHydronyms (3)\n\nRoads (5)\n\nCemeteries (4)\n\nUnidentified (11)\n\nMiscellanea (41)\n\nOrchards (5)\n\nSacred buildings (33)\n\nMilitary buildings (5)\n\nAgricultural buildings (4)\n\nHills (1)\n\nFortifications (29)\n\nList of publications where the plan appeared:\n\nCzerner Olgierd. Lwów na dawnej rycinie i planie. Wrocław. Zakład Narodowy imienia Ossolińskich. 1997. Il. 108.\n\nNotes from the Shevchenko Scientific Society vol. CCXLIX. Commission of Architecture and Construction. Lviv, 2005. Il. 1, p. 561.\n\nCharacterization of the city:\n\nThe map shows the city center with the defensive walls and parts of the suburbs. In 1772 Lviv became the capital of the new Austrian crown land called the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (Königreichen Galizien und Lodomerien).\n\nObtaining Capital status greatly influenced Lviv’s development. One of the most important catalysts for the urban transformation of Lviv was the demolition of the defensive walls, towers and gates around the city.\n\nThe liquidation of these Middle Aged fortifications started in 1777 under the leadership of Clemence Fesinger. The demolition debris was sold to locals as building material for low prices. This prompted locals to build new structures. [23], p. 64, [77], p. 115\n\nThe map shows the already liquidated segments of the Low (Nyzkyj) wall between the Jesuit gate and bastion I (Hetmanska), separate fragments between bastion II (Hrodska) and bastion III (Krakivska) and a section between the Krakivska gate and Small (Malyj) beluard. [12], p. 221\n\nIn 1773 Pergen, Governor of the crown land ordered that the Jesuit order be liquidated; this started the process of closing most monastic orders in the city. [74], p. 52\n\nVery few buildings for public use were constructed in the 1770. The few that were included the educational establishment Collegium Pijary in the Brodiv suburbs (1776) and the wooden theatre led by Gottersdorf which, from 1775-1785, was located near the Jesuit gate (probably the building numbered 344). [74], p. 69, [77], p. 123\n\nThere were nearly 25 000 individuals living in the city in 1780. [20], p. 113 The population growth can be attributed to an increase in the number of officials who came to work in the capital city of Lviv. [20], p. 35\n\nThe educated traveler Baltasar Hacquet gives an indication that Lviv contained nearly 2759 buildings in 1790. [20], p. 30\n\nIntensification of construction started in 1760 when a 1774 law was revived that exempted newly built or reconstructed buildings from taxes for 10 years. [74], p. 30, [77], p. 117"
