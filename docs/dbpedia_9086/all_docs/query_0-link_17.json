        "text": "Important differences marked the two main regions that found themselves in the confines of reconstituted Poland. Galicia was the less ethnically homogeneous. From the Austrian period, however, the Galician Ukrainians brought a long history of self-organization and political participation and inherited a broad network of cultural and civic associations, educational establishments, and publishing enterprises. And in the Greek Catholic church they possessed an influential national, as well as religious, institution. The population of Volhynia was more heavily Ukrainian; nevertheless, as a consequence of imperial Russian rule since 1795, there was little tradition of organized national life, native education, or political experience. As a legacy of tsarist rule, the dominant Orthodox church was initially a bastion of Russian influence. Still, in the course of the two decades before World War II, considerable national integration between Galician and Volhynian Ukrainians took place, despite Polish efforts to forestall such a development.\n\nAs individuals, all citizens of Poland enjoyed equal rights under the 1921 constitution; in practice, discrimination on the basis of nationality and religion greatly limited the Ukrainians’ opportunities. Although the Allied powers in 1923 accepted the Polish annexation of Galicia on the basis of its regional autonomy, the government in the early 1920s proceeded to dismantle the institutions of local self-government inherited from Habsburg times. Ukrainian Galicia, officially termed “Eastern Little Poland,” was administered by governors and local prefects appointed by Warsaw. A special administrative frontier, the so-called Sokal border, was established between Galicia and Volhynia to prevent the spread of Ukrainian publications and institutions from Galicia to the northeast. In 1924 the Ukrainian language was eliminated from use in state institutions and government agencies. In the face of economic stagnation, scant industrial development, and vast rural overpopulation, the government promoted Polish agricultural settlement, further exacerbating ethnic tensions. As Ukrainian nationalist activities quickened toward the end of the 1920s and in the ’30s, the regime resorted to more repressive measures. Some organizations were banned, and in 1930 a military and police pacification campaign led to numerous arrests, widespread brutality and intimidation, and destruction of property.\n\nMuch of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict centred on the schools. Initially, the government concentrated on establishing a centralized educational system and expanding the network of Polish schools; however, by the 1930s, overt Polonization of education was being promoted. The number of Ukrainian schools declined drastically. In higher education the existing Ukrainian chairs at Lviv were abolished, and a promised separate Ukrainian university was never allowed to be established. An underground Ukrainian university functioned in Lviv from 1921 to 1925.\n\nIn a society where nationality and religion were almost inextricably bound, the church played an extraordinarily large role. In Galicia, under the leadership of the highly revered metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, the Greek Catholic church conducted its religious mission through numerous clergy and monastic orders. The church also ran a network of seminaries, schools, charitable and social service institutions, museums, and publications. Although Catholicism of the Roman rite remained privileged, the Greek Catholic church was made relatively secure from overt state interference by the Vatican-Polish Concordat of 1925; however, it was not allowed to extend its activities beyond the Sokal border.\n\nIn the northwestern Ukrainian areas, Orthodoxy remained the dominant religion. A nationally conscious clergy and lay intelligentsia played an important role in Ukrainian life in Volhynia, although Russian influences continued at the level of ecclesiastical administration. In the 1930s Polish authorities promoted, sometimes by force, the conversion of the Orthodox to Roman Catholicism and, in a campaign that lasted until World War II, seized hundreds of Orthodox churches for closure, destruction, or transfer to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nDespite official obstruction and harassment, organized community life continued to develop on the foundations established in the Austrian period in Galicia. Cultural, scholarly, professional, women’s, and youth associations flourished. In circumstances of economic depression and discrimination in public employment, a large-scale development of the cooperative movement was highly successful. Much progress was also achieved in Volhynia; most difficult, however, was the situation in ethnically mixed border areas in the northwest, where by the 1930s all Ukrainian organizations were suppressed and schooling was conducted exclusively in Polish.\n\nUkrainian political life was dominated by conflict with the Poles. The first elections to the Polish Sejm (diet) and Senate, in 1922, were boycotted by the Galician Ukrainians. In Volhynia the Ukrainians participated and, in a bloc with the Jews and other minorities, won overwhelmingly against Polish candidates. Both Galician and Volhynian Ukrainians took part in subsequent elections, which, however, were increasingly marred by abuses, intimidation, and violence. Of the political parties, most influential in Galicia was the centrist Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance, which tried to extract concessions from the Polish government and to inform public opinion. Left-wing parties (socialists and communist front organizations) had considerably more strength in Volhynia."
