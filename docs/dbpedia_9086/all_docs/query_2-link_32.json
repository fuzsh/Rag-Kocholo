        "text": "Situated in the center of historic Lviv, the Citadel Inn Hotel & Resort features a glorious past. Originally founded as a military fortress known as Fort II, this unique historical destination was constructed by the Austrian government over the course of the 1850s. The citadel was intended to protect the borders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from mounting external turmoil throughout the 19th century. The Citadel Inn Hotel & Resort even features a special structure called the Maximilian Tower, which was designed by the famous Austrian Archduke Maximilian d'Este. Today, the hotel is the true embodiment of the regal traditions that once defined this amazing place. It is a fantastic living reminder of the Austro-Hungarian Empireâ€™s spectacular history.\n\nThe Citadel Inn Hotel & Resort is not currently taking reservations.\n\nCitadel Inn Hotel & Resort has been named to these Historic Hotels Worldwide Top 25 Lists"
