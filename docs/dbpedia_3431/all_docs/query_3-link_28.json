        "text": "Recognizes 109 individuals for being outstanding owner-operators, exemplifying excellence in franchising and service to others\n\nPHOENIX, Feb. 18, 2024 – The International Franchise Association (IFA) today recognized 109 individuals with its 2023 Franchisee of the Year awards, representing IFA member brands across all industries from communities around the country and across the world. The annual Franchisee of the Year award recognizes outstanding franchise establishment owner-operators, honored at the 64th IFA Annual Convention in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n“Franchisees of the Year exemplify what franchising is all about – providing opportunity, serving others, and fulfilling the American Dream,” said Matt Haller, President and CEO of the International Franchise Association. “We are proud to recognize these entrepreneurs with the highest honor IFA awards to individual franchisees, and we thank them for the work they do day in and day out to uplift their communities and all they serve.”\n\nThe Franchisee of the Year Award recognizes leading franchise owners from IFA member brands whose outstanding performance and contributions help protect, enhance, and promote the franchise business model. Nominated by their parent company, individuals are selected for their service to their communities, fostering a strong and vibrant workforce, opening the doors for career growth and entrepreneurship, and supporting their fellow franchisees.\n\nThere are approximately 806,000 franchised businesses across the U.S., providing over 8.7 million direct jobs and generating over $858 billion in economic output. According to Oxford Economics, franchising on average provides higher wages and better benefits than non-franchised businesses, as well as greater entrepreneurial opportunities to minorities, women, veterans, and other underrepresented communities.\n\nThe full list of recipients is below:"
