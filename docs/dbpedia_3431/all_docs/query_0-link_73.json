        "text": "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has kicked off a communication drive, getting in touch with hundreds of benefits recipients due to significant alterations to their payment routines. Those currently on Housing Benefit are the subject of this update as they make the transition to Universal Credit, reports The Express.\n\nLiberal Democrat representative Sarah Olney challenged Whitehall representatives for clarity on the shifting landscape and measures to mitigate associated risks such as increased financial hardship, indebtedness, and potential evictions. Answering the call, Social Security chief Stephen Timms conveyed that notices alerting claimants to these changes commenced distribution from July 17.\n\nCiting safeguarding protocols, he remarked: \"DWP has processes in place within Universal Credit to help reduce hardship, debt and risk of eviction.\" In alleviating transitional pressures, he elucidated: \"For example, people who receive Housing Benefit and then claim Universal Credit will receive a two-week run on of their housing payment while they transition to Universal Credit Housing Payment.\"\n\nREAD MORE DWP claimants urged to check if they could get monthly £198.31 boost\n\nPlus, there's additional support for those adapting to Universal Credit through direct landlord payments termed Alternative Payment Arrangements. Beneficiaries of the migration notice should heed the three-month deadline post-notification to apply for Universal Credit to ensure uninterrupted benefit support.\n\nUniversal Credit is set to gradually phase out a raft of extant benefits:\n\nChild Tax Credit\n\nHousing Benefit\n\nIncome Support\n\nIncome-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)\n\nIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n\nWorking Tax Credit.\n\nFurthermore, the Government is reviewing, with possible overhaul intentions, the work capability assessment which underscores a claimant's employment suitability.\n\nMr Timms offered fresh insights into the forthcoming strategies, emphasising that ministers are forging a solid plan to bolster disabled persons' integration into the workforce.\n\nHe announced: \"We will also give disabled people the confidence to start working without fear of an immediate benefit reassessment if it does not work out.\"\n\n\"More disabled people and those with health conditions will be supported to enter and stay in work, by devolving more power to local areas so they can shape a joined-up work, health, and skills offer that suits the needs of the people they serve.\" He further added: \"These plans are central to our missions of kickstarting economic growth and breaking down barriers to opportunity.\""
