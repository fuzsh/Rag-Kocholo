        "text": "The Virtus Spain, Federation Spanish Sports Disability Intellectual-FEDDI organised Spanish Paddle Championship in collaboration with the Paddle Federation of the Valencian Community last month. This was the second of the championship that concluded with overwhelming success, thus consolidating itself as one of the most outstanding sporting events of the year.\n\nThe competition, which took place from April 12 to 14, brought together more than 161 athletes from 22 sports clubs and 11 different autonomous communities. Figures show that participation continues to grow year after year, reflecting the commitment and passion of athletes for paddle tennis.\n\nFor three intense days, from April 12 to 14, participants enjoyed the best game and an incredible atmosphere of coexistence, accompanied by sun and good weather. Furthermore, it is worth highlighting the great family atmosphere that was experienced, with a notable presence of family and spectators. Proof of this was the joint meal held on Saturday at the Sportcity paddle club.\n\nIn the men’s competition, the unstoppable duo made up of Daniel Sancho and David Abadía, from the Aspadif Club, won the coveted first place. Meanwhile, in the mixed category, the outstanding couple composed of Sara Guasch and Xavier Scarés, from Club Addif, emerged as the undisputed winner.\n\nThe men’s competition was not without emotion, and the No Hay Límite Yecla club saw its representatives, Ramiro Hernández and Adrián Bueno, crowned champions. The mixed adapted category saw Nerea Gallego and Marco Casares, from CD San Cebrián, win the first prize.\n\nFor its part, in the women’s sports skills division, the duo formed by Natalia Reche and Maribel Ros, from Club Aidemar, stood out for their impeccable performance. In the mixed sports skills category, the couple composed of Pablo Torres and Adrián Lapeña, from Unitts, emerged as the undisputed winner. Finally, in the individual divisions, Maider Esandia Aldaya, from El Molino, and Néstor Zoe Fernández Rodado, from Fundación Ser, won first prize in the female and male categories respectively.\n\nThe awards ceremony was the finishing touch to the competition and had the special participation of Ramón Morcillo, president of the Spanish Paddle Federation. Their prominent presence emphasizes the commitment of both federations to the promotion of inclusive sports and equal opportunities in the sporting field."
