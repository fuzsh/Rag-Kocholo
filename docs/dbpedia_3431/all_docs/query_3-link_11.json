        "text": "Introduction\n\nWorldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of diabetes more than doubled between 1980 and 2014, with the greatest relative and absolute increases seen in low-income and middle-income countries.1 Results from a previous large-scale collaborative meta-analysis of prospective studies done mostly in high-income countries showed that diabetes was associated with an approximate doubling in all-cause mortality risk, with the greatest excess due to deaths from occlusive vascular diseases (eg, ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke).2, 3 In those studies, the proportional increase in occlusive vascular risk associated with diabetes was higher among women than among men.3 Similarly, findings from a large Chinese study showed somewhat larger relative risks associated with diabetes for vascular mortality in women than in men.4 However, adjustment for other established vascular risk factors (eg, blood pressure and cholesterol) was not always possible in these studies, so the larger relative risks seen in women could be due to differences in the extent of confounding by these factors. By contrast, in a large study of Mexican adults,5 diabetes conferred a much larger overall proportional increase in mortality risk than had been seen in these previous studies, and this relative risk was identical in men and women.\n\nEvidence before this study\n\nSeveral large prospective studies and meta-analyses of such studies—especially the extensive collaborative meta-analysis by the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration—have shown that individuals with diabetes are predisposed to increased vascular mortality, particularly from occlusive causes, and a higher relative risk exists among women than among men. Despite these studies, reasons for these sex differences are still unclear; however, they might relate to differential confounding by other established major vascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, total cholesterol, body-mass index (BMI), and smoking status.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nUsing individual participant-level data from nearly 1 million adults from the Prospective Studies Collaboration and Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration with complete measurement of established major vascular risk factors, we assessed sex-specific differences in the association between diabetes and occlusive vascular mortality across age groups and established major vascular risk factors. This meta-analysis adjusts for these major risk factors when analysing this association. Even after controlling for total cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, and smoking status, diabetes conferred a doubling in occlusive vascular mortality risk among men aged 35–89 years, but a tripling in risk among similarly aged women. Among women especially, diabetes death rate ratios were higher at younger ages than at older ages, so that at ages 35–59 years, diabetes was associated with a five to six times increased risk of occlusive vascular mortality. Total cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI each had continuous log-linear associations with occlusive vascular mortality that were similar in strength among those with and those without diabetes irrespective of sex. Because those with diabetes were at a much higher risk than those without diabetes, however, the absolute relevance of these risk factors to vascular mortality risk was much greater among those with diabetes than those without.\n\nImplications of the available evidence\n\nPublic health strategies aimed at lifestyle changes (particularly with respect to smoking and adiposity) and wider use of cost-effective drug treatments (eg, statin-based regimens and blood-pressure-lowering drugs) to reduce vascular risks are important among both men and women with diabetes. However, our results suggest that the larger death rate ratios associated with diabetes among women, compared with those among men, do not seem to be explained by these established major vascular risk factors. Future research should consider which emerging risk factors account for the relative excess risk of occlusive vascular disease among women with diabetes.\n\nWe aimed to assess whether differences in established risk factors explain higher relative risks of vascular mortality among women than among men. We used individual participant data from adults included in the Prospective Studies Collaboration and the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration to estimate sex-specific associations between diabetes and risk of occlusive vascular mortality in subgroups divided by age and other vascular risk factors. We also examined whether the relevance of blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and body-mass index (BMI)—factors that might cause or be caused by diabetes—to occlusive vascular mortality risk varied with the presence or absence of diabetes.\n\nResults\n\nFrom 68 prospective studies in the Prospective Studies Collaboration and Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration studies database, individual participant-level data for 1 017 259 participants were obtained, and 980 793 adults (568 525 [58·0%] men vs 412 268 [42·0%] women) were eligible for analyses (8697 were excluded for a history of ischaemic heart disease or stroke and 27 769 for having incomplete information on baseline covariates). The studies were done in 19 countries, and included 516 780 (52·6%) participants from western and central Europe, 271 290 (27·7%) from southeast Asia, 122 330 [12·5%] from North America, and 70 393 (7·2%) from Australasia (appendix). Mean age at recruitment was 46 years (SD 10) for the analysed participants and mean age at occlusive vascular death in the 19 686 participants who died from these causes between ages 35 and 89 years was 66 years (SD 11).\n\nOverall, 42 451 (4·3%) of 980 793 participants reported having diabetes at recruitment (28 450 [5·0%] of 568 525 men, and 14 001 [3·4%] of 412 268 women; appendix). The prevalence of diabetes increased with age, from 2·1% in men and 1·4% in women at age 40 years, to 8·9% in men and 6·0% in women by age 70 years (appendix). Of the 58 700 participants who reported no history of diabetes but who had a measurement of glucose, only 1174 (2·0%) had a glucose measurement that indicated they had undiagnosed diabetes and were counted as having diabetes in the main analyses.\n\nThe prevalence of diabetes increased with increasing BMI, systolic blood pressure (adjusted for BMI), and total cholesterol (adjusted for BMI), and decreased with increasing HDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol was assessed in a subset of 168 341 participants). The prevalence of diabetes was broadly similar irrespective of smoking status (appendix).\n\nDuring 9·8 million person-years of follow-up, in participants who were aged between 35 and 89 years, 76 765 participants died, including 19 686 (25·6%) from occlusive vascular causes, of whom 17 919 (91·0%) died from ischaemic heart disease, 1499 (7·6%) from ischaemic stroke, and 268 (1·4%) from other atherosclerotic diseases. summarises the adjusted age-specific and sex-specific death RRs (participants with diabetes vs those without) for occlusive vascular mortality (stratified by study and adjusted for age at risk, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and smoking status). Overall, at ages 35–89 years, diabetes more than doubled occlusive vascular mortality risk (death RR 2·30, 95% CI 2·18–2·44), but the death RR was higher for women (3·00, 2·71–3·33) than for men (2·10, 1·97–2·24). The death RRs were higher at younger ages than at older ages ( ; p=0·0001 for trend across age groups). This finding was especially apparent among women, for whom the diabetes death RR was 5·55 (95% CI 4·15–7·44) at ages 35–59 years. These higher death RRs in women largely persisted within levels of other vascular risk factors ( ). When we did analyses separately for ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke, the age-specific and sex-specific death RRs were similar to those seen for all occlusive vascular deaths considered together (p<0·05 for the heterogeneity test between men and women for overall death RRs for both ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke; appendix); we did not analyse deaths from other specific atherosclerotic diseases because small numbers precluded reliable analyses. The results were not materially changed after excluding studies that recruited only men or only women (appendix), or when excluding the studies that contributed most to between-study heterogeneity (data not shown). Sex differences in death RRs were also evident among participants who reported a history of ischaemic heart disease or stroke (appendix) and separately within each of the three studied regions (ie, Europe, the USA or Australasia, and Asia; appendix).\n\nThe underlying confounder-adjusted occlusive vascular mortality rates at any given age were higher among men than women; therefore, the age-specific absolute excess occlusive vascular mortality risk associated with diabetes was similar for men and women ( ). At ages 35–59 years, the adjusted excess mortality associated with diabetes was 0·05% (95% CI 0·03–0·07) per year in women compared with 0·08% (0·05–0·10) per year in men; the corresponding excess mortality at ages 70–89 years was 1·08% (0·84–1·32) per year in women and 0·91% (0·77–1·05) per year in men.\n\nTable\n\nDiabetesNo diabetesRate difference (95% CI)Deaths (n)Person-yearsAdjusted rate*Deaths (n)Person-yearsAdjusted rate*Aged 35–59 yearsMen252151 3210·13%45794 168 6600·06%0·08% (0·05–0·10)Women6072 7560·06%4962 878 2950·01%0·05% (0·03–0·07)Aged 60–69 yearsMen39062 6050·52%50961 062 7610·24%0·28% (0·22–0·34)Women13632 5470·28%974720 1440·07%0·20% (0·13–0·27)Aged 70–89 yearsMen46030 4892·05%4473350 7541·14%0·91% (0·77–1·05)Women25213 0011·92%2518267 0990·84%1·08% (0·84–1·32)\n\nFor usual (ie, long-term average level) total cholesterol, usual systolic blood pressure, and baseline BMI, log-linear positive associations with occlusive vascular mortality risk were seen both among participants with and without diabetes ( ). For total cholesterol and BMI, the strength of the associations was similar for participants with and those without diabetes, but for systolic blood pressure the association was somewhat weaker among those with diabetes than among those without diabetes. However, because the absolute risk of occlusive vascular mortality was appreciably higher in participants with diabetes, the crude absolute risks associated with higher levels of all three of these vascular risk factors were much greater among participants with diabetes than those without. These findings were similar when men and women were considered separately (appendix).\n\nFor non-occlusive vascular mortality, the death RRs comparing individuals with and without diabetes were somewhat weaker than for occlusive vascular mortality, but, as for occlusive vascular mortality, death RRs were larger for women than for men ( ). The death RRs for cancer mortality were considerably smaller (overall death RR 1·17, 95% CI 1·10–1·23) than for vascular causes, and similar among men and women. Diabetes was associated with an approximate doubling in the risk of death from the composite of any other medical or external cause (death RR 1·87, 1·78–1·97; excluding 142 deaths attributed directly to diabetes).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this analysis of individual participant-level data from nearly 1 million adults with no previous vascular disease who were followed up prospectively to monitor mortality, we determined that having diabetes at recruitment was associated with a doubling in death rates from ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic stroke among men, but a tripling of these death rates among women. For both men and women, the death RRs for occlusive vascular mortality were greater in early middle-aged (ie, 35–59 years) than in older patients, so that diabetes was associated with an almost six times higher occlusive vascular death rate among women aged 35–59 years, even after controlling for other established major vascular risk factors.\n\nAt any given age, the underlying confounder-adjusted occlusive vascular death rates were higher for men than for women, so despite higher death RRs among women than among men, we estimate that the absolute excess risk of occlusive vascular mortality associated with diabetes was similar in men and women. The adjusted occlusive vascular mortality rates among women with diabetes aged 35–59 or 60–69 years were similar to those among men without diabetes of a similar age ( ).\n\nSex differences in the relative excess of occlusive vascular risk associated with diabetes have been reported in several studies,3, 4, 15, 16 but most have not considered how this relative excess risk translates to absolute excess risk. By contrast with these studies, the main strength of our analysis is the inclusion of studies with complete availability of baseline information on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, BMI, and smoking status in a large number of apparently healthy people (ie, without occlusive vascular disease) followed up prospectively. Underprescription of cardiovascular-risk-modifying therapy among women has been described,17 but since many of the cohort studies included in our meta-analysis were completed before the introduction of statin therapy and widespread screening for high blood pressure for primary prevention, our findings suggest that underprescription among women is unlikely to account for the differences between the sexes in our calculated diabetes death RRs. Indeed, our findings remain relevant, since results from a study of 1·9 million patients in an English primary-care database who were identified and followed up between 1998 and 2010 showed that relative risks for non-fatal ischaemic heart disease were somewhat higher among women than among men, even after adjustment for disease management via antihypertensive medication and statin use16 (which are similarly efficacious in both sexes18, 19). However, sex differences in the management of cardiac disease during and after treatment in hospital might, to some extent, help to account for the higher diabetes death RRs among women than among men.20\n\nSeveral hypotheses that could account for sex differences in diabetes-associated vascular risk remain unexplored. Hormone-replacement therapy has been shown to increase cardiovascular risk,21 and both oestrogens and androgens can affect lipid metabolism;22 therefore, future analyses considering sex-hormone concentrations and subclasses of lipids would be of interest. 23, 24, 25 Sex differences in inflammation might also exist,26 and since targeting interleukin-1β can reduce occlusive vascular risk,27 inflammation should be a focus of future research aimed at devising novel therapeutic approaches.\n\nThe main limitation of this study was the absence of phenotypic information on diabetes and its complications, which have been shown to affect risk (eg, type of diabetes, glycaemic control,3 duration of diabetes,28 and the presence of complications such as renal disease29). Other studies have considered these factors, but rarely are all factors comprehensively measured, and whether sex differences in diabetes phenotype could account for sex differences in the relation of diabetes with occlusive vascular mortality risk is unclear. For example, type 1 diabetes might be associated with high cardiovascular risk,30 but among adults with diabetes the proportion who have type 1 diabetes is usually low in most populations (3–15%) and, if anything, this proportion is higher in men than in women.31 Differences in glycaemic control are also not a clear explanation for sex differences observed in the English primary care study of 1·9 million patients,16 since diabetes was associated with a somewhat higher risk of ischaemic heart disease in women than in men despite similar prescription of diabetes treatments, and glycaemic control being, if anything, slightly better in women than in men.16 However, in a prospective study of 150 000 Hispanic adults from Mexico City, Mexico,5 no difference was seen between men and women in the diabetes death RR for vascular causes (or for all causes combined). Notably, both men and women in that study had a similar duration of diabetes and similarly poor glycaemic control. Additionally, our meta-analysis does not take into account the effects of undiagnosed diabetes at baseline or the development of new diabetes during follow-up. However, among participants with glucose measurements, only 2% of those not reporting a diagnosis at baseline had measurements that indicated the presence of undiagnosed diabetes, and, therefore, if a similarly small percentage of participants developed diabetes during follow-up then the reported death RRs would not be greatly affected since these people would contribute only a very small proportion of those classified as not having diabetes at baseline. Another limitation of this study is that the cohorts were recruited some years ago, with baseline data ranging from 1949 to 1997. Although this aspect of the study also has some advantages (primarily that the participants were recruited before widespread treatment with statins or blood-pressure-lowering medication), we must recognise that treatment of both diabetes and vascular risk factors have changed substantially over the past few decades and these changes might affect the current vascular risks associated with a diagnosis of diabetes. Hence, analysis of recently established and future prospective cohorts is needed to assess whether developments in the treatment of both diabetes and vascular risk factors over the past few decades are having any effect on contemporary diabetes-associated risks and on the age and sex differences in these associations.\n\nOur analyses showed that the strength of the association of total cholesterol and BMI with occlusive vascular mortality risk was similar irrespective of the presence of diabetes, and that at any level of these risk factors, diabetes carries a substantially increased risk ( ). Hence, the absolute relevance of these risk factors to occlusive vascular disease would be greater for people with diabetes than those without. Although the association between systolic blood pressure and occlusive vascular mortality risk was slightly weaker among participants with diabetes, the absolute relevance to risk would again be greater among those with diabetes than those without diabetes.\n\nIn the WHO 2013–20 non-communicable disease global plan targets,32 one of the main priorities is a 25% reduction in the risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes by 2025 relative to 2013. The continuous nature of the associations of conventional risk factors with vascular events among people with diabetes in our analyses supports data from randomised trials33, 34 that suggest that the vascular benefits of intensive versus recommended standard blood-pressure-lowering medications and targets are similar among those with and without diabetes, and support the existing guideline recommendation35 favouring treatment of absolute risk of disease rather than threshold concentrations of cholesterol. Since the relevance of blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and BMI to occlusive vascular mortality risk was broadly similar among people with and without diabetes, the absolute benefits of strategies to achieve effective lowering of these multiple risk factors in both women and men with diabetes will help to achieve global health priorities. However, the use of only these strategies would not be expected to reduce all the relative excess of diabetes-associated vascular risk seen among women, since this excess risk does not seem to be explained by these traditional major vascular risk factors.\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Sarah Lewington, MRC Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK sarah.lewington@ndph.ox.ac.uk"
