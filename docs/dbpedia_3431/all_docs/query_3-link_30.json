She will happily answer your questions and help match you with the best therapist for your needs.\n\n3 Ways to Connect With Us\n\nCall Us | 678-249-0072\n\nEmail Us | clientcare@eccfcounseling.com\n\nUse The Appointment Calendar Below\n\nAppointment Calendar\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nUps and downs happen in every family. If you feel your family is stuck in conflict though or you are concerned whether what your child or teen is experiencing is typical, counseling can help. Don’t worry if you aren’t sure or still have questions though. We offer a free, no-obligation 15-minute consultation call with our Client Care Coordinator.\n\nOur therapists start with an initial session for just parents to discuss concerns and set goals for counseling. Treatment is typically a mix of individual sessions for the child teen, family sessions as needed, and parent sessions for strategies. The length of treatment can vary, and you and your child’s therapist will work together to determine the best plan for your family.\n\nSessions are typically 50 minutes in length with fees ranging from $150 to $190 per session, depending on the therapist you see.\n\nFor small group counseling, sessions are typically 45 minutes with fees ranging from $50 to $75 per session, depending on the group. Groups meet for a set number of weekly sessions, usually 8 to 10 weeks.\n\nCurrent clients receive the following services as part of their session fee:\n\nIndividualized treatment plans that are updated as needed.\n\nOccasional brief phone conversations with your therapist for updates and questions outside of sessions.\n\nAt your request, brief phone communication between your therapist and other professionals caring for your child (doctor, psychiatrist, teacher, school counselor, psychiatrist, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, etc.)\n\nAt your request, letters to other professionals caring for your child regarding treatment goals and progress.\n\nResources to support your family’s goals and progress.\n\nReferral information for other professionals who can support your family’s goals and progress.\n\nBelow are the service codes used most often.

Many insurance companies will offer partial reimbursement of fees through your out-of-network benefits, and we are happy to provide you with an insurance-friendly receipt for this. You are also welcome to use a Health Savings Account or Flex Spending Account for your payment at the time of service.\n\nIf you plan to use insurance, we always recommend calling your insurance company to confirm your benefits and the process for reimbursement.\n\nQuestions to Ask Your Insurance Company:\n\nWhat are my “out-of-network” outpatient mental health insurance benefits?\n\nWhat is my deductible and have I met it?\n\nAre there any limitations on how many services will be covered annually?\n\nIs it possible to meet with a provider that I choose?\n\nWhat is the process for submitting receipts for reimbursement?\n\nWhat is the coverage amount per therapy session? Does this change if we choose an associate-licensed therapist?\n\nHow long will it take to get my reimbursement?\n\nDo I need a referral from a primary care physician?\n\nAre virtual outpatient mental health visits (or teletherapy) covered by my plan?\n\nAs an out-of-network provider, Early Connections has partnered with Mentaya to help families save money on therapy.\n\nUse this tool below to see if you qualify for reimbursement for therapy services.\n\nConvenient Location, calming Grounds\n\nDirections to Our Office\n\nROSWELL OFFICE\n\nHeading west on Highway 92: Go past Target, Wildwood Office Park is on the right just after Laurel Lake subdivision.
