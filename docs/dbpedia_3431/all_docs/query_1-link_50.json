        "text": "Another fulfilling year of teaching at the university ENTI - UB ends this week. Today, I want to pour my heart out and express my deepest gratitude to the incredible individuals who have made this journey so memorable and rewarding during three years. To my exceptional students: Words cannot adequately express the warmth and joy that fills my heart when I think of each one of you. A good example os this is the twitter post that they shared expressing their love and appreciation for the lessons that Fran and myself crafted for all of you. This touched me deeply. It is because of your unwavering dedication, passion, and eagerness to learn that I find myself invigorated and inspired each day. Thank you for embracing the knowledge, for sharing your thoughts, and for reminding me why I am so passionate about teaching. We have made the classroom feel like a family, and witnessing your growth and achievements has been an absolute privilege. An a special shout-out to my wonderful colleague, Fran Ruiz Giménez: Working with you this year has been an absolute pleassure. Together, we formed a dynamic duo that brought new dimensions to our subject, new reflections and we adapt to what will come regarding processes and students needs. Fran, your expertise, creativity, and unwavering support have enriched my teaching experience beyond measure. The collaboration we shared made every moment in the classroom a true delight. Thank you, Fran, for your invaluable contributions and for reminding me of the power of teamwork and shared passion. And thank you Joan Josep Pons López for always trusting in us giving the ownership to us in your departure to your new and amazing role, we learnt a lot from you. To my university: Three years of being entrusted with the responsibility to educate and shape young minds is a true honor. I am humbled by the faith you placed in me, and I am grateful for the support and opportunities you have provided throughout this journey in special Jordi Radev & Richard Hebert. It is through your commitment to fostering a nurturing environment that I have been able to grow as an educator. Thank you for believing in me and for allowing me to make a difference in the lives of these incredible students. When every academic year ends I carry with me a heart full of gratitude, love, and memories. To my students, remember that the lessons we shared extend far beyond the classroom walls, and I have no doubt that you will leave an indelible mark on the industry. To my colleagues, may our paths continue to intertwine, as we support and uplift one another in our pursuit of knowledge. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU #Gratitude #Education #TeachingJourney #LoveInEducation #Inspiration #Leveldesign #Gameindustry"
