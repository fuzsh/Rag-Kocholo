ACTION: Proposed rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: Consistent with the recent changes that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finalized, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the nutrition labeling requirements for meat (including fish of the order Siluriformes) and poultry products to better reflect the most recent scientific research and dietary recommendations and to improve the presentation of nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. FSIS is proposing to update the list of nutrients that are required or permitted to be declared; provide updated Daily Reference Values (DRVs) and Reference Daily Intake (RDI) values that are based on current dietary recommendations from consensus reports; and amend the labeling requirements for foods represented or purported to be specifically for children under the age of 4 years and pregnant women and lactating women and establish nutrient reference values specifically for these population subgroups. FSIS is also proposing to revise the format and appearance of the Nutrition Facts label; amend the definition of a single-serving container; require dual-column labeling for certain containers; and update and modify several reference amounts customarily consumed (RACCs or reference amounts). Finally, FSIS is proposing to consolidate the nutrition labeling regulations for meat and poultry products into a new Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Summary The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) direct the Secretary of Agriculture to maintain meat and poultry product inspection programs designed to assure consumers that meat and poultry products distributed to them (including imports) are safe, wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. The FMIA and PPIA (``the Acts'') also provide that the labels of meat and poultry products must be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, who has delegated this authority to FSIS, before these products can enter commerce. The Acts prohibit the sale or offer for sale by any person, firm, or corporation of any article in commerce under any name or other marking or labeling that is false or misleading or in any container of a misleading form or size (21 U.S.C 607(d); 21 U.S.C 457(c)). The Acts also prohibit the distribution in-commerce of meat or poultry products that are adulterated or misbranded. The FMIA and PPIA give FSIS broad authority to promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Acts (21 U.S.C. 621 and 463(b)). To prevent meat and poultry products from being misbranded, the meat and poultry product inspection regulations require that the labels of meat and poultry products include specific information, and that such information be displayed as prescribed in the regulations (9 CFR part 317 and part 381). The nutrition labeling requirements for meat and meat food products are in 9 CFR 317.300-317.400, and the nutrition labeling requirements for poultry products are in 9 CFR 381.400- 381.500. The nutrition labeling regulations for meat and poultry products include requirements regarding: Location of nutrition information; labeling with number of servings; nutrition label content; reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion; and nutrient content claims. On March 3, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published two proposed rules, ``Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'' (the ``FDA Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule'')(79 FR 11880) and ``Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed at One-Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments'' (the ``FDA Serving Size Proposed Rule'')(79 FR 11989). FDA proposed these rules to update the Nutrition Facts label to reflect newer nutrition and public health research and recent dietary recommendations from expert groups and to improve the presentation of nutrition information to help consumers make more informed choices and maintain healthy dietary practices. On July 27, 2015, FDA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking ``Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels; Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking'' (the ``FDA Nutrition Labeling Supplemental Proposed Rule'') (80 FR 44303) to revise certain provisions of the FDA Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule. On May 27, 2016, FDA published two final rules, ``Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'' [[Page 6733]] (the ``FDA Nutrition Labeling Final Rule'')(81 FR 33742) and ``Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed at One-Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments'' (the ``FDA Serving Size Final Rule'') (81 FR 34000). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis, and to ensure that there is consistency in how nutrition information is presented across the food supply, FSIS is proposing to amend the nutrition labeling regulations for meat and poultry products to parallel, to the extent possible, FDA's final regulations. This approach will clarify information for consumers and improve efficiency in the marketplace. FSIS is proposing to consolidate the nutrition labeling regulations that currently are presented separately for meat and for poultry products (in 9 CFR 317.300-317.400 and 381.400-381.500, respectively) into a single part, 9 CFR part 413. Consistent with FDA's final regulations, FSIS is also proposing to update the list of nutrients that are required or permitted to be declared and to provide updated DRVs and RDIs that are based on current dietary recommendations from consensus reports. For example, FSIS is proposing to remove the requirement to declare ``Calories from Fat;'' require the declaration of ``Added Sugars,'' vitamin D, and potassium; permit the voluntary declaration of vitamins A and C; and update the reference value for the declaration of percent Daily Value (DV) for sodium from the current value of 2,400 mg (milligrams) to 2,300 mg. FSIS is also proposing to amend the requirements for foods represented or purported to be specifically for children under the age of 4 years and pregnant women and lactating women and establish nutrient reference values specifically for these population subgroups. FSIS is also proposing to revise the format and appearance of the Nutrition Facts label. Some of the proposed changes include increasing the type size for ``Calories,'' ``servings per container,'' and the ``Serving size'' declarations, and bolding the number of calories and the ``Serving size'' declaration to highlight this information. FSIS is also proposing to amend the definition of a single-serving container; require dual-column labeling for certain containers; and update and modify several RACCs. These proposed changes will provide consumers information to assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices.

USDA Nondiscrimination Statement X. Additional Public Notification XI. Proposed Regulatory Amendments I. Background The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) of 1990 required the nutrition labeling of most foods regulated by the FDA. Because FSIS is committed to providing consumers with the most informative labeling system possible, FSIS published regulations establishing comparable nutrition labeling requirements for meat and poultry products on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). These regulations required nutrition labels on the packages of all multi-ingredient and heat-processed meat and poultry products, unless an exemption applied. The required nutrition labeling provisions were referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling program.'' The Agency's 1993 regulations also established guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of single- ingredient, raw meat and poultry products, including single-ingredient, raw ground or chopped products. FSIS published technical amendments to the 1993 final rule (August 18, 1993, 58 FR 43787; September 10, 1993, 58 FR 47624; and March 16, 1994, 59 FR 12157), a final rule on the placement of nutrition labeling on meat and poultry products (August 8, 1994), a final rule with additional technical amendments to the nutrition labeling regulations (September 1, 1994; 59 FR 45189), and a final rule to provide codified language for provisions that previously cross-referenced FDA's nutrition labeling regulations on January 3, 1995 (60 FR 174). FSIS also published a final rule to require nutrition labeling of the major cuts of single-ingredient raw meat and poultry products and ground or chopped meat and poultry products on December 29, 2010 (75 FR 82164). Currently, FSIS requires nutrition labels on the packages of all multi-ingredient and heat-processed meat and poultry products, and all ground or chopped products, unless an exemption applies (9 CFR 317.300; 317.301; 381.400; 381.401). FSIS also requires that nutrition information be provided on the label or at the point-of-purchase for the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products identified in 9 CFR 317.344 and 381.444 that are not ground or chopped, except for certain exemptions. The following exemptions in 9 CFR 317.400 and 381.500 from the nutrition labeling requirements apply to the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products and ground or chopped meat and poultry products: Products intended for further processing, provided that the labels for these products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information; Products that are not for sale to consumers, provided that the labels for these products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information; Products in small packages that are individually wrapped packages of less than \\1/2\\ ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information; Products that are custom slaughtered or prepared; and Products intended for export. FSIS also provides the following additional exemptions in 9 CFR 317.400 and 381.500 for ground or chopped products: Ground or chopped products that qualify for the small business exemption in 9 CFR 317.400(a)(1) or 381.500(a)(1); Products that are ground or chopped at an individual customer's request and that are prepared and served at retail, provided that the labels or labeling of these products bears no nutrition claims or nutrition information; Ground or chopped products in packages that have a total surface area for labeling of less than 12 square inches, provided that the product's labeling includes no nutrition claims or nutrition information and provided that an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required information is included on the label; and Ground products produced by small businesses that use statements of percent fat and percent lean on the label or in labeling of ground products, provided they include no other nutrition claims or nutrition information on the product labels or labeling. Generally, ready-to-eat products that are packaged and portioned at a retail store or similar retail-type establishment and multi- ingredient products (e.g., sausage) processed at a retail store or similar retail-type establishment are exempt from nutrition labeling, provided that this exemption does not apply to ready-to-eat or multi- ingredient ground or chopped products described in 9 CFR 317.301 or 381.401. Restaurant menus also do not generally fall within the scope of FSIS's current nutrition labeling regulations (9 CFR 317.400 and 381.500). However, FDA requires that restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items disclose certain nutrition information for standard menu items (see ``Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishments''; December 1, 2014; 79 FR 71155). FDA also requires that operators who own or operate 20 or more vending machines disclose calorie information for food sold from vending machines, subject to certain exemptions (see ``Food Labeling; Calorie Labeling of Articles of Food in Vending Machines''; December 1, 2014; 79 FR 71259). FSIS does not require nutrition information for single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products that are not major cuts and that are not ground or chopped. But, if nutrition information is provided for these products, it must be provided in accordance with the nutrition labeling requirements for the major cuts (9 CFR 317.300 and 381.400). II. The Proposed Rule Nutrition labeling continues to be an integral part of USDA's efforts to educate consumers about nutrition and diet. Since 1980, USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have jointly published the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) every five years. The 2015-2020 DGA provides advice on food choices that promote overall health, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and help individuals attain and maintain a healthy weight.\\1\\ The nutrition labeling information that FSIS is proposing to require in this rule would assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. The information should also help consumers follow the advice in the 2015-2020 DGA. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015--2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 8th edition, Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, December 2015. Available at http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015.asp. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For example, the 2015-2020 DGA concluded that some Americans do not consume enough vitamin D or potassium, and inadequate intake of these nutrients presents public health concerns (pages 60). Vitamin D is important for bone health, and potassium helps to reduce the effects of excess sodium on blood pressure. This proposed rule would require vitamin D and potassium to be declared on nutrition labels, to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Moreover, consistent with the 2015-2020 DGA, the information should help consumers follow the 2015-2020 DGA's [[Page 6736]] advice to select foods that provide more of these nutrients (page 60). Additionally, the 2015-2020 DGA does not consider low intake of vitamins A and C to be a major public health concern (page 60). Currently, vitamins A and C must be declared on the Nutrition Facts label, but this proposed rule would make their declaration voluntary. This proposed rule also proposes changes to the Daily Values for certain nutrients, consistent with the more recent scientific evidence from the 2015-2020 DGA. For example, FSIS is proposing to amend the current DV for sodium of 2,400 to 2,300 mg, which is consistent with the scientific evidence reflected in the 2015-2020 DGA's recommendation to limit intake of sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day and is the upper limit for individuals ages 14 years and older set by the Institute of Medicine. (page 15). Revising DVs to reflect the most current science on nutrient requirements will help consumers choose a better overall diet. The 2015-2020 DGA also supports listing added sugars on nutrition labels. It affirms that poor diet and physical inactivity are primary factors contributing to overweight, obesity, and chronic illness (pages 2-3). Calories from added sugars, solid fats (including saturated and trans fats), and refined grains replace nutrient-dense foods and make it difficult to consume sufficient nutrients while controlling caloric intake (page 14). FSIS is proposing to require that added sugars be listed on nutrition labels to assist consumers in selecting a more nutrient-dense diet while controlling the total number of calories consumed (see section II.E.3 for discussion of the rationale for the proposed changes). Section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(A)) defines serving size as an amount customarily consumed and which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the food. FSIS, consistent with FDA, is proposing to update, modify, and establish certain RACCs and require that packages which contain more than 150 percent and less than 200 percent of a given RACC be labeled as containing one serving, regardless of the RACC of the product. Certain packages that contain at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of a given RACC would be required to include dual column labels that provide nutrition information per serving or per package, as applicable. These changes will ensure that serving sizes are based on current consumption data and will provide consumers with information on the Nutrition Facts label related to the serving size that will assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Finally, FSIS is proposing several updates to the design of the current Nutrition Facts labels, including making the caloric content and serving size declarations more prominent. These and other changes aim to address current public health problems such as obesity, chronic disease, and nutrient deficiency by emphasizing important nutritional information and providing additional information to consumers. A. Consolidating the Nutrition Labeling Requirements Into 9 CFR Part 413 Currently, the nutrition labeling regulations for meat and poultry products are presented separately (in 9 CFR 317.300-317.400 and 381.400-381.500, respectively). FSIS believes that the public would be better served by consolidating these regulations in one part of title 9. Rather than searching through two separate parts of title 9-CFR parts 317 and 381-- to find the nutrition labeling regulations, interested parties would only have to read part 413. Therefore, FSIS is proposing to consolidate the nutrition labeling regulations for meat and poultry products into a single part, 9 CFR part 413. B. Calories FSIS requires the total number of calories per serving of a meat or poultry product to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1); 9 CFR 381.409(c)(1); and proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)). FSIS is not proposing to change this requirement but is proposing changes to the requirements related to ``Calories from fat'' and ``Calories for saturated fat.'' 1. Calories from Fat FSIS currently requires that ``Calories from Fat'' be declared on Nutrition Facts labels (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1)(ii); 9 CFR 381.409(c)(1)(ii)). FSIS is proposing to no longer require, and to not allow voluntarily, the declaration of ``Calories from fat'' on the Nutrition Facts label. Section 403(q)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)(2)(B)) grants the Secretary of HHS (and by delegation, FDA) discretion to remove information relating to a nutrient required to be declared on food labels by regulation if the Secretary determines that it is not necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. FDA considered a number of factors related to the declaration of ``Calories from Fat,'' including dietary recommendations and consensus reports that emphasize intake of total calories and the type of fat consumed, as well as comments from their 2005 and 2007 Advanced Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMS) (April 4, 2005, 70 FR 17008; November 2, 2007; 72 FR 62149) that supported eliminating the declaration of ``Calories from fat'' in order to place greater emphasis on total calories. FDA determined that the declaration of ``Calories from fat'' is not necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33780). Under FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, FDA no longer requires, and does not allow voluntarily, the declaration of ``Calories from fat'' on the Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 33780). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and has tentatively concluded that the declaration of ``Calories from fat'' is not necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. FSIS agrees with FDA that ``the amount of fat being consumed can still be obtained from the total fat declaration elsewhere on the Nutrition Facts label, and consumers can still use the percent DV for total fat to put fat content in the context of a total daily diet, compare products, and plan diets'' (79 FR 11891; 81 FR 33780). 2. Calories From Saturated Fat Under current FSIS regulations, the declaration of ``Calories from saturated fat'' on the Nutrition Facts label is voluntary (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1)(iii); 9 CFR 381.409(c)(1)(iii); will be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(ii)). FSIS continues to believe that ``Calories from saturated fat'' can be declared voluntarily. The amount of saturated fat can be obtained from the total saturated fat declaration on the Nutrition Facts label, and consumers can use the percent DV for saturated fat to put saturated fat content in the context of a total daily diet, compare products, and plan diets (79 FR 11892; 81 FR 33781). Therefore, FSIS does not believe it is necessary to require the mandatory declaration of ``Calories from saturated fat'' on the Nutrition Facts label. But with the revisions to the Nutrition Facts label, FSIS is proposing to require that ``Calories from saturated fat'' be indented when declared under the statement of calories (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(ii)). 3. Two Thousand Calories as the Reference Caloric Intake Level FSIS regulations (9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9)) set a percent DRV for fat, saturated fatty acids, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, fiber, sodium, potassium, and protein, based on a reference caloric intake of 2,000 [[Page 6737]] calories. Just as FDA did not make any changes to the reference calorie intake, FSIS is not proposing any changes to the reference caloric intake currently used to set the DRVs under 9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9) (which will both be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9)). FDA considered a number of factors related to the reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories, including the relevant recommendations from the IOM macronutrient report \\2\\ that provided estimated energy requirements, the IOM Labeling Report,\\3\\ and the comments regarding the 2,000 calorie reference intake level received in response to FDA's 2007 ANPRM (79 FR 11892). FDA decided not to propose changes to the reference calorie intake level (81 FR 33782). ``The IOM Labeling Committee concluded that retaining the current 2,000 reference calorie intake level would be the best approach as it would provide continuity and would not encourage higher calorie intake and overconsumption of energy'' (79 FR 11892). FSIS agrees with FDA and the recommendation of the IOM Labeling Committee. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies. ``Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients), Chapter 5: Energy'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2002. \\3\\ The amount of vitamin D may, but is not required to, be expressed in international units (IU), in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IU must appear in parentheses after the declaration of the amount of vitamin D in mcg. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Percent Daily Value (DV) Declaration for Calories FSIS's current regulations do not establish a DRV for calories and do not require a percent DV declaration for calories. FDA reviewed recommendations in current consensus reports, including the IOM macronutrient report,\\4\\ and comments received in response to their 2005 and 2007 ANPRMs (79 FR 11892, 11893). FDA decided not to require a percent DV for total calories because of a lack of an appropriate quantitative intake recommendation or other data or information on which FDA could rely to establish a DRV for calories (81 FR 33782). FSIS agrees with FDA's conclusion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ 1 mg [alpha]-tocopherol (label claim) = 1 mg [alpha]- tocopherol = 1 mg RRR- [alpha]-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac-[alpha]- tocopherol. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C. Fat 1. Total Fat a. Definition and Mandatory Declaration FSIS is not proposing any changes to its definition of ``total fat'' under 9 CFR 317.309(c)(2) and 381.409(c)(2) (which will both be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2)). FSIS is proposing to define ``fatty acids'' in 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2) as aliphatic carboxylic acids consisting of a chain of alkyl groups and characterized by a terminal carboxyl group to harmonize with FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule and clarify what FSIS considers to be a fatty acid. FSIS is not proposing to change the requirement for mandatory declaration for total fat on the Nutrition Facts label. b. DRV FSIS's regulations 9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9), set 65 grams as the DRV for total fat based on a reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories (i.e., 30 percent of a 2,000 calorie diet). In FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, FDA increased the DRV for total fat to 78 grams, or 35 percent of a 2,000 calorie diet. The upper level of the IOM Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) \\5\\ for total fat for adults is 35 percent and serves as an appropriate basis on which to set the DRV for total fat (81 FR 33784). FDA reviewed new information and evidence that corroborated the position that the types of fats consumed are more important in influencing the risk of heart disease than is the total amount of fat (81 FR 33784). FDA stated that keeping the DRV for total fat at 30 percent of calories could be misinterpreted as advising consumers to limit their intake of total fat to 30 percent or less, and that it is conceivable that consumers could view foods that are good sources of mono and polyunsaturated fats negatively because their percent DV declaration for total fat is high (81 FR 33784). FSIS agrees with FDA's analysis, and is proposing to increase the DRV for total fat from 30 percent of calories to 35 percent of calories for a DRV of 78 grams. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ ``The AMDR for a macronutrient is based on the amount of the macronutrient that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease while providing adequate intakes of essential nutrients'' (79 FR 11886). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Saturated Fat a. Definition FSIS regulations currently define ``Saturated fat'' as the sum of all fatty acids, including stearic acid, containing no double bonds (see 9 CFR 317.309(c)(2)(i); 381.409(c)(2)(i); and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i)). However, in FSIS's 1993 Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products final rule, based on requests from the red meat industry and the scientific knowledge in 1993 that stearic acid did not have the same serum cholesterol-raising effects of the other three saturated fatty acids, myristic, palmitic, and lauric acids, FSIS provided for the voluntary declaration of stearic acid as a subcomponent of saturated fat (58 FR 641). FDA had no similar request for the voluntary listing of stearic acid and did not provide for such listing. In FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule, FDA considered voluntary declaration of stearic acid on the Nutrition Facts label, as recommended by a few comments to their 2007 ANPRM (79 FR 11894). The effects of stearic acid on Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels appear to vary depending on the macronutrient component that is replaced by stearic acid (79 FR 11894). FDA found that moderate evidence indicates that when stearic acid substitutes for other saturated fatty acids or trans fat, plasma LDL cholesterol levels decrease, whereas when it replaces monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, LDL cholesterol levels increase (79 FR 11894). Considering such scientific data, the Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (2010 DGAC),\\6\\ concluded that the potential effects of changes in dietary intake of stearic acid on the risk of CVD remain unclear (79 FR 11894). In FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule, FDA tentatively concluded that the individual declaration of stearic acid is not necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, and proposed to not permit the declaration on the Nutrition Facts label (79 FR 11894). FDA addressed the evidence for a role of stearic acid in human health (e.g., changes in plasma LDL cholesterol levels), which is not well- established, and the fact that there is no quantitative intake recommendation available for stearic acid (Id.) In FDA's final rule, FDA did not exclude stearic acid from the calculation of the percent DV for [[Page 6738]] saturated fat because the scientific evidence supporting the current dietary recommendations for saturated fat does not differentiate among the individual saturated fatty acids (81 FR 33786). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2010) ``Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010'', Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office. Retrieved from http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietary-guidelines-2010. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on this updated scientific information and the fact that few if any companies have included stearic acid as a voluntary nutrient in the current Nutrition Facts label, FSIS is proposing to remove the voluntary declaration of stearic acid below saturated fat. Also, consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to exclude acetic, propionic, and butyric acids from the definition of saturated fat. b. Mandatory Declaration FSIS requires the mandatory declaration of the number of grams of saturated fat per serving (9 CFR 317.309(c)(2)(i) and 381.409(c)(2)(i) will be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2)(i)). FSIS is not proposing to change this requirement because FSIS is unaware of any evidence that supports that this information is no longer needed to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices. c. Dietary Reference Value (DRV) FSIS's regulations 9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9), which will be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9), set 20 grams as the DRV for saturated fat based on a reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories. FSIS is not proposing to change the DRV for saturated fat. FDA reviewed the IOM Labeling Committee recommendation,\\7\\ the comments in response to their 2007 ANPRM, and current consensus reports relating to the DRV for saturated fat, and stated that ``the existing scientific evidence does not support a change to the current 20 g DRV'' for saturated fat (79 FR 11895-11896). FDA determined ``the existing DRV of 20 grams is consistent with the scientific evidence supporting a maximum intake level that covers the general U.S. population.'' (81 FR 33786). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and has tentatively concluded not to change the DRV for saturated fat. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies, ``Dietary Reference Intakes: Guiding Principles for Nutrition Labeling and Fortification'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2003. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Trans Fat On July 11, 2003, FDA published a final rule requiring manufacturers to declare trans fatty acids, or trans fat, on the Nutrition Facts label of conventional foods and some dietary supplements (68 FR 41461). At that time, FSIS published information on its Web site stating that FSIS was planning rulemaking on trans fat label declarations to consider provisions in the meat and poultry regulations that are consistent with FDA's rules.\\8\\ In the interim, FSIS has not objected to the voluntary declaration of trans fat in Nutrition Facts labels on food products under its jurisdiction if the declaration is made in accordance with FDA regulations published in the Federal Register on July 11, 2003, that amended 21 CFR part 101. There are no FDA or FSIS provisions for claims regarding trans fatty acids. Thus, any labeling that includes a statement regarding trans fatty acids that is outside of and in addition to the Nutrition Facts label declaration would need to be submitted to FSIS (the Labeling and Program Delivery Staff (LPDS)) for evaluation. To date, FSIS has not permitted any claims regarding trans fatty acids. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/labeling/labeling-policies/trans-fat-declarations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on FSIS's label review, FSIS believes that the majority of meat and poultry product Nutrition Facts labels voluntarily declare trans fat. However, because FSIS is now proposing major modifications to the Nutrition Facts label, FSIS believes it is time to address the need for trans fat labeling on meat and poultry products. According to FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule, trans fat continues to be a nutrient with public health significance because of its role in chronic disease (79 FR 11896). FDA is unaware of evidence to support a determination that information relating to trans fat on the Nutrition Facts label is not necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (79 FR 11896). FDA tentatively concluded that information on the amount of trans fat in food products allows consumers to reduce their intake of trans fat and thus reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (79 FR 11896). However, in 2013, FDA published a tentative determination that partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the source of industrially produced trans fat, may not be generally recognized as safe (GRAS)(78 FR 67169; November 8, 2013). FDA requested comment on whether mandatory labeling of trans fat would still be necessary if this determination is finalized (79 FR 11896). Per 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(ii), if a food contains less than 0.5 g of trans fat per serving, the content, when declared, is to be expressed as zero. On June 17, 2015, FDA published a final determination that there is no longer a consensus among qualified experts that PHOs, which are the primary dietary source of industrially-produced trans fatty acid are GRAS for any use in human food and therefore are food additives subject to section 409 of the FD&C Act (80 FR 34650). FDA has set a compliance period of three years for companies to either reformulate products without PHOs or petition FDA to permit specific uses of PHOs. Following the compliance period, no PHOs can be added to human food unless they are otherwise approved by FDA. In FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, FDA did not make any changes to the requirement for mandatory declaration of trans fat on the Nutrition Facts label in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(ii), stating ``it is premature to consider removing trans fat from the Nutrition Facts label at this time.'' (81 FR 33786- 88). Although FDA's final determination that PHOs are not GRAS for use in any human food may eliminate the source of industrially produced trans fat, FSIS recognizes that there are trans fats caused by the way that some animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats, digest their food (the ruminating process). Consistent with FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule (81 FR 33786-33787), FSIS is proposing to require the declaration of trans fat in the Nutrition Facts label (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2)(ii)). The mandatory declaration of trans fat will assist consumers in making informed choices and maintaining healthy dietary practices. 4. Polyunsaturated Fat a. Voluntary Declaration FSIS permits the voluntary declaration of the number of grams of polyunsaturated fat per serving (defined as cis, cis-methylene interrupted polyunsaturated fatty acids) on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(2)(ii) and 381.409(c)(2)(ii), which will be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2)(iii)). FDA considered current consensus reports and comments received in response to their 2007 ANPRM when deciding to propose to continue to permit the voluntary declaration of polyunsaturated fat on the Nutrition Facts label (79 FR 11897; 81 FR 33788). FDA recognized that, although polyunsaturated fat is related to public health as a replacement for saturated fat, there is no dose-response relationship between polyunsaturated fat and risk of CHD, independent of saturated fat, and therefore continued to permit the voluntary declaration of polyunsaturated fat (81 FR 33788-89). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and agrees with its conclusion and therefore, [[Page 6739]] is not proposing to make any changes to the voluntary declaration of polyunsaturated fat. Polyunsaturated fat has public health significance because replacing saturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids reduces blood LDL cholesterol levels and in turn the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\\9\\ Polyunsaturated fat is a macronutrient, not an essential vitamin or mineral, does not have a quantitative intake recommendation, but does have public health significance. Therefore, FSIS believes it is appropriate to continue to permit the voluntary declaration of polyunsaturated fat consistent with FDA's final rule. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Retrieved from http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietary-guidelines-2010. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. DRV FSIS's regulations do not provide a DRV for polyunsaturated fat. FDA did not propose a DRV for polyunsaturated fat, tentatively concluding ``that there is no appropriate quantitative intake recommendation to form a basis for setting a DRV for polyunsaturated fat'' (79 FR 11898). FDA did not change its position in the final rule (81 FR 33789). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to provide a DRV for polyunsaturated fat. c. Declaration of Individual Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids FSIS's regulations do not permit the declaration of individual polyunsaturated fatty acids on the Nutrition Facts label. Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to provide for the individual declaration of either n-3 or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids or the declaration of eicosapentaeneoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 33789). 5. Monounsaturated Fat a. Voluntary Declaration FSIS's regulations currently allow the voluntary declaration of monounsaturated fat (defined as cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid)) on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(2)(iii) and 381.409(c)(2)(iii), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(2)(iv)). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to change the voluntary declaration of monounsaturated fat (81 FR 33788). b. DRV FSIS's regulations do not provide a DRV for monounsaturated fat. FDA did not provide a DRV for monounsaturated fat for the same reasons it did not set a DRV for polyunsaturated fat (81 FR 33789). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to set a DRV for monounsaturated fat. D. Cholesterol 1. Mandatory Declaration FSIS's regulations require the amount of cholesterol be declared on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(3) and 381.409(c)(3), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(3)). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing changes to the requirement for mandatory declaration of cholesterol. 2. DRV FSIS sets 300 mg as the DRV for cholesterol based on the reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories (9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9)). FSIS is not proposing to change the DRV for cholesterol. E. Carbohydrate 1. Total Carbohydrate a. Calculation of Total Carbohydrate FSIS requires the number of grams of total carbohydrate per serving be listed on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6) and 381.409(c)(6), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)). Total carbohydrate content must be calculated by subtracting the sum of the crude protein, total fat, moisture, and ash from the total weight of the product (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6) and 381.409(c)(6), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)). FDA considered a citizen petition requesting that dietary fiber be excluded from the calculation of total carbohydrate, comments received on its 2007 ANPRM, and scientific evidence and declined to change the current method for calculating total carbohydrate (79 FR 11899-11900; 81 FR 33794-33795). Just as FDA is not making any change, FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and has decided not to propose to change the current method for calculating total carbohydrate. b. Classification of Carbohydrates Based on a Chemical Definition or Physiological Effect FSIS is not proposing to change its requirements for the classification or declaration of carbohydrates (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6) and 381.409(c)(6), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)). FSIS agrees with FDA that a chemical definition for total carbohydrate is still consistent with the classification and declaration of fat on the Nutrition Facts label (79 FR 11901; 81 33795). It would be difficult to apply a definition for total carbohydrates based on physiological effects because the different components of carbohydrates have different physiological effects. c. Separate Declaration of Additional Individual Types of Carbohydrates FSIS is not proposing to require the separate declaration of additional types of individual carbohydrates (e.g., starch) because, as FDA also concluded, the comments to the 2007 ANPRM did not support the declaration of additional types of carbohydrates, such as starch (81 FR 33795). d. Mandatory Declaration FSIS requires the number of grams of total carbohydrate per serving be listed on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6) and 381.409(c)(6), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)), and has tentatively concluded, that the mandatory declaration of total carbohydrates continues to be necessary to assist consumers in making informed choices. Therefore, consistent with FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, FSIS is not proposing to change the requirement for mandatory declaration of total carbohydrate. e. DRV FSIS sets 300 grams as the DRV for total carbohydrate based on 60 percent of a 2,000 calorie diet ((0.60 x 2,000 calories)/4 calories per gram of carbohydrate = 300 grams) (9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9)). The percentage of calories from total carbohydrate, total fat, and protein must add up to 100 percent on the Nutrition Facts label. Because, as discussed in part (II)(C)(1), FSIS is proposing to increase the DRV for total fat from 30 to 35 percent of calories consistent with FDA's final rule, either the DRV for total carbohydrate or protein must be decreased. As discussed in FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, decreasing the DRV for protein from 10 percent of calories to 5 percent of calories to account for the increase in the DRV for total fat would result in a DRV of 5 grams of protein, which falls below the RDA for protein for children [[Page 6740]] and adults 9 years and older (81 FR 33784). Therefore, consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing to decrease the DRV for total carbohydrate from 60 percent of calories to 55 percent of calories for a DRV of 275 grams to account for the increase in the DRV for total fat. f. Calculation of Calories From Carbohydrate FSIS requires that calories from total carbohydrate be calculated using the general factor of 4 calories per gram total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble dietary fiber (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1)(i)(C) and 381.409(c)(1)(i)(C)). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing a new definition for dietary fiber (see section II.E.5) that only allows for the declaration of dietary fibers that FDA has determined to have a physiological effect that is beneficial to human health. The new definition of dietary fiber includes: (1) Non- digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; and (2) isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health. For the purpose of calculating calories from carbohydrate, all soluble and insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates should be excluded from the calculation, not just those known to meet the definition of dietary fiber. Therefore, FSIS is proposing that all soluble and insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates be excluded from the calculation for calories from total carbohydrate (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(i)(C)). 2. Sugars a. Mandatory Declaration FSIS requires a statement of the number of grams of sugars per serving on the Nutrition Facts label, except for products that contain less than 1 gram of sugars per serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, or sugar alcohol content (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(ii) and 381.409(c)(6)(ii); would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(ii)). FSIS defines sugars as the sum of all free mono- and disaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose) (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(ii) and 381.409(c)(6)(ii)). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS has tentatively concluded that the mandatory declaration of sugars continues to be necessary to assist consumers in making informed choices and maintaining healthy dietary practices. But, FSIS is proposing to replace the declaration of ``Sugars'' with the term ``Total Sugars,'' which is also consistent with FDA's final rule. The rationale for this proposed change is discussed in part K(5). b. DRV FSIS's regulations do not provide a DRV for sugars. FDA did not propose a DRV for sugars because there are no upper limits or set dietary reference values on which a DRV for sugars could be based (79 FR 11902). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing to set a DRV for sugars. 3. Added Sugars a. Declaration FSIS's regulations do not define ``added sugars'' nor permit its declaration on the Nutrition Facts label. FDA is requiring the declaration of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts label and considered, in its review, new data and information from U.S. consensus reports and scientific evidence supporting recommendations related to the consumption of added sugars, a citizen petition, and public comments (79 FR 11902-11906; 81 FR 33799-33851) and FDA's consumer study on added sugars \\10\\ (80 FR 44306). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and is also proposing to require the declaration of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts label to provide consumers with the information they need to make more informed choices and meet the dietary recommendation to reduce caloric intake from added sugars. FSIS is proposing changes consistent with FDA's final rule. FSIS is proposing to require the mandatory declaration of added sugars as an indented line item underneath the declaration of ``Total Sugars'' on the Nutrition Facts label. FSIS is also proposing that the phrase ``Not a significant source of added sugars'' be placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values if a statement of the added sugars content is not required and, as a result, is not provided. FSIS is also proposing that a statement of added sugars content would not be required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, or sugar alcohol content (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iii)). FSIS is also proposing to permit alternative statements for added sugars similar to the current alternative statements for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugars, and sugar alcohol, when a serving contains less than 1 gram of the nutrient. Proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iii) would provide for the alternative statements ``Contains less than 1 gram'' or ``less than 1 gram,'' or, if the serving contains less than 0.5 g of added sugars, the content can be expressed as zero. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Memorandum to the File-- ``Experimental study on consumer responses to Nutrition Facts labels with declaration of amount of added sugars (OMB No. 0910-0764),'' 2015. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Proposed Definition FSIS regulations do not currently define the term ``added sugars.'' Because FSIS is proposing to require the mandatory declaration of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts label, FSIS is also proposing to define the term ``added sugars.'' Proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iii) defines ``added sugars'' as sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such and include sugars (free, mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups, honey, and fruit juice concentrates (see proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iii) for specific requirements for fruit juice concentrates) (see proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iii) for the complete ``added sugars'' definition). Examples of ``added sugars'' added to meat and poultry products include: Table sugar, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, apple juice concentrate glucose, Glucono-Delta-Lactone (GDL), high-fructose corn syrup, invert sugar, lactose, maltose, malt sugar, maple syrup, molasses, raw sugar, turbinado, sugar, trehalose, and sucrose. Sugar alcohols would not be considered added sugars. c. Daily Value FDA established a DRV for added sugars of 10 percent of total energy intake based on new information in the ``Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee'' (the ``2015 DGAC report'' \\11\\) regarding added sugars (80 FR 44308; 81 FR 33842). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing a DRV for added sugars of 50 g for children and adults 4 years of age and older, including pregnant women and lactating women, and that the percent DV for added sugars be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. As discussed in FDA's supplemental proposed rule, the 2015 DGAC report recommended reducing the intake of added sugars, including an added sugars declaration and a percent DV for added sugars declaration in the Nutrition Facts label, and recommended that Americans keep added sugars intake below 10 percent of total energy intake (80 FR [[Page 6741]] 44308). FSIS's proposed DRV of 50 g for added sugars was determined by taking 10 percent of the 2,000 reference calorie intake for adults and children 4 years of age and older (.10 x 2,000 = 200 calories) and then dividing by 4 calories/gram, which provides a 50 g reference amount for added sugars as the DRV. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- d. Compliance FSIS is not aware of an analytical method that is capable of distinguishing between added and intrinsically occurring sugars in a food product, nor did FDA identify such a method (79 FR 11906). Therefore, to verify compliance with the proposed mandatory declaration of added sugars, FSIS is proposing in 9 CFR 413.309(h)(8)(iv) that establishments make and keep certain records to verify the amount of added sugars in the product (see compliance section II.N. below for more details about this requirement). For example, FSIS is proposing that a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of sugars added to the product during the processing of the product and, if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient). FSIS is aware that sugars in some foods may undergo chemical changes as a result of non-enzymatic browning (i.e., Maillard reactions and caramelization) or fermentation during food processing. Some sugars are metabolized or otherwise transformed and converted into compounds that are no longer recognizable or detectable as sugars through conventional analytical methods.\\12\\ As FDA concluded, FSIS expects that the amount of added sugars transformed during non-enzymatic browning reactions in most products is insignificant relative to the initial levels of sugars (81 FR 33830-33831). Unlike browning reactions, fermentation is a process that typically involves the action of desirable microorganisms (e.g., yeasts and lactic acid bacteria) and enzymes that convert organic compounds, especially sugars and other carbohydrates, into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide, lactic acid, and ethyl alcohol.13 14 Fermented sausages are one example of a fermented meat product and include certain types of pepperoni, salami, Lebanon bologna, mettwurst, and certain types of chorizo. Fermentation can affect the flavor, color, and microbiological safety of meat products. Both natural and controlled meat fermentation involve lactic acid bacteria. This type of bacteria converts naturally occurring glycogen and added sugars into lactic acid. This conversion reduces the amount of sugar in a meat product.\\15\\ However, FSIS expects that the majority of manufacturers would be able to use the amount of sugars added as an ingredient as a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of their product. When the amount of added sugars is reduced through non-enzymatic browning or fermentation, FSIS is proposing in 9 CFR 413.309(h)(8)(v) to require: (1) Records of scientific data and information that demonstrate the amount of added sugars in the food after non-enzymatic browning or fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food manufactured; or (2) records of the amount of sugars added to the food before and during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) and in no event shall the amount of added sugars declared exceed the amount of total sugars on the label. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Skibsted, L.H., Risbo, J., Andersen, M.L. ``Chemical Deterioration and Physical Instability of Food and Beverages''.

Similar to FDA, FSIS is proposing that manufacturers may submit a request to FSIS's LPDS to use an alternative means of compliance. The request must provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to have a significant reduction in added sugars compared to the amount added prior to non-enzymatic browning or fermentation. 4. Sugar Alcohols For nutrition labeling purposes, consistent with FDA, FSIS defines sugar alcohols ``as the sum of saccharide derivatives in which a hydroxyl group replaces a ketone or aldehyde group and whose use in the food is listed by FDA (e.g., mannitol or xylitol) or is generally recognized as safe (e.g., sorbitol)'' (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(iii) and 381.409(c)(6)(iii), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(iv)). Consistent with FDA, FSIS permits the voluntary declaration of sugar alcohols on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(iii) and 381.409(c)(6)(iii)). FSIS is not proposing to change the voluntary declaration of sugar alcohols on the Nutrition Facts label, just as FDA did not. a. DRV Consistent with FDA, FSIS does not provide a DRV for sugar alcohols and is not proposing a DRV for sugar alcohols because there is no quantitative reference intake recommendation for sugar alcohols from current consensus reports on which to base a DRV. b. Caloric Value Caloric content for total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble dietary fiber is calculated using a factor of 4 calories per gram (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1)(i)(C) and 381.409(c)(1)(i)(C)). FSIS has reviewed the Life Sciences Research Office reports 16 17 that recommended the following caloric values for sugar alcohols: isomalt (2.0 kcal/g); lactitol (2.0 kcal/g), xylitol (2.4 kcal/g); maltitol (2.1 kcal/g); sorbitol (2.6 kcal/g); hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (3.0 kcal/g); and mannitol (1.6 kcal/g). FSIS has tentatively concluded that the values recommended by the Life Sciences Research Office are closer to the energy contribution of sugar alcohols than the current factors. FSIS also reviewed FDA's analysis for determining a caloric value for erythritol and agrees with the analysis (81 FR 33852). Therefore, consistent with FDA's final rule (81 FR 33852), FSIS is proposing to amend its regulations to establish the following general factors for caloric values for sugar alcohols: isomalt (2.0 kcal/g); lactitol (2.0 kcal/g), xylitol (2.4 kcal/g); maltitol (2.1 kcal/g); sorbitol (2.6 kcal/g); hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (3.0 kcal/g); mannitol (1.6 kcal/g); and erythritol (0 kcal/g). Proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(i)(F) will establish these values, and proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(i)(C) will clarify that the [[Page 6742]] factor of 4 kcal/g does not apply to sugar alcohols. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Life Sciences Research Office. ``The Evaluation of the Energy of Certain Sugar Alcohols Used as Food Ingredients'', Bethesda, MD: Life Sciences Research Office; 1994. \\17\\ Life Sciences Research Office. ``Evaluation of the Net Energy Value of Maltitol'', Bethesda, MD: Life Sciences Research Office; 1999. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Fiber a. Dietary Fiber i. Definition FSIS's regulations do not define ``dietary fiber.'' After considering IOM recommendations, comments received on FDA's 2007 ANPRM, and international guidelines (e.g., The Codex Alimentarius Commission's definition of dietary fiber), FDA adopted a definition of dietary fiber that is equivalent to the IOM's definition of ``total fiber'' and emphasizes the beneficial physiological effects in humans (81 FR 33853). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and is proposing to include a definition for dietary fiber in 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i) that is consistent with FDA's definition. FSIS is proposing the following definition for dietary fiber: (1) Non-digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; and (2) isolated or synthetic non- digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health. FSIS is proposing to include isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates that have been determined by FDA to have a physiological effect that is beneficial to human health in the proposed definition of dietary fiber in 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i). For example, [beta]-glucan soluble fiber and psyllium husk that are added to foods meet the proposed definition of dietary fiber and would be listed in 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i). FSIS would consider amending 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i) to list any additional isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates that FDA determines have a physiological effect that is beneficial to human health. ii. Mandatory Declaration FSIS requires that a statement of the number of grams of total dietary fiber per serving be declared on the Nutrition Facts label, except when a serving contains less than 1 gram of total dietary fiber (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(i) and 381.409(c)(6)(i), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i)). FSIS is not proposing to change the requirement for mandatory declaration of dietary fiber, just as FDA did not. iii. Analytical Methods The amount of dietary fiber may be calculated by subtracting the amount of non-digestible carbohydrates added during processing that do not meet the proposed definition of dietary fiber from the value obtained using AOAC 2009.01, AOAC 2011.25, or an equivalent AOAC method of analysis as given in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International'' 19th Edition. Because an AOAC method would not accurately quantify the dietary fiber that meets the proposed definition if the product contains both non-digestible carbohydrates that meet the definition and those that do not, consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing to require that manufacturers maintain written records to verify the amount of added non-digestible carbohydrates that do not meet the proposed definition of dietary fiber. (See Compliance section II.N. below.) iv. DRV Currently, 25 g is the DRV for total dietary fiber based on the reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories (9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9)). FSIS is proposing to amend its regulations to establish 28 g as the DRV for total dietary fiber (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9)). FSIS is proposing to use 28 g as the DRV for total dietary fiber because: (1) the IOM set an adequate intake level (AI) of 14 g/1,000 kcal for total fiber primarily based on the intake level that was associated with the greatest reduction in the risk of CHD; \\18\\ and (2) FDA now uses 14 g/1,000 kcal as the basis for a DRV for dietary fiber and setting a DRV of 28 g for dietary fiber using a reference calorie intake of 2,000 calories (81 FR 33865-33866). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies. ``Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients), Chapter 7: Dietary, Functional, and Total Fiber'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2002. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- b. Soluble and Insoluble Fiber Soluble fibers (e.g., pectin) dissolve in water and are digested by the bacteria in the large intestine. Insoluble fibers (e.g., cellulose) do not dissolve in water and are not digested by the bacteria in the large intestine. FSIS regulations do not define the terms soluble and insoluble fiber, but provide for the voluntary declaration of soluble and insoluble fiber (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(i) and 381.409(c)(6)(i)), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i)). Consistent with FDA, FSIS is proposing that when soluble fiber or insoluble fiber is declared, the soluble fiber and insoluble fiber must meet the definition of ``dietary fiber'' in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(6)(i) because they are components of dietary fiber. i. Analytical Methods AOAC 2011.25 or an equivalent AOAC method may be used to calculate soluble and insoluble fiber that meet the proposed definition of dietary fiber and can be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. AOAC 2011.25 can measure low molecular weight non-digestible carbohydrates, as well as separately measure soluble and insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates.\\19\\ Consistent with FDA, if a product contains a mixture of non-digestible carbohydrates that do not meet the proposed dietary fiber definition, and the label of the product declares soluble or insoluble fiber content, FSIS is proposing to require establishments to make and keep records to verify the amount of non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the proposed definition of dietary fiber present in the food. (See discussion in compliance section II.N. below.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ McCleary, B.V., DeVries, J.W., Rader, J.I., et al. ``Determination of Total Dietary Fiber (CODEX definition) by Enzymatic-Gravimetric Method and Liquid Chromatography: Collaborative Study''. Journal of AOAC International. 2010;93:221- 233. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ii. DRV FDA did not find a basis on which to derive DRVs for soluble or insoluble fiber. Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is not proposing DRVs for soluble fiber or insoluble fiber. iii. Caloric value FSIS regulations provide that the caloric content of a product may be calculated by, among other methods, using general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for protein, total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble dietary fiber, and total fat, respectively (9 CFR 317.309(c)(1)(i)(C) and 381.409(c)(1)(i)(C)). Soluble fiber, which is included in total carbohydrate, is assigned a general factor of 4 kcal/ g. FDA established a general factor of 2 kcal/g as the caloric value of soluble non-digestible carbohydrates (81 FR 33867). Insoluble non- digestible carbohydrates are not included in the caloric calculation (81 FR 33867). FDA required that calories from carbohydrate be calculated using a general factor of 4 kcal/g of total carbohydrate less the amount of non-digestible carbohydrates, which includes soluble (2 kcal/g) and insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates (0 kcal/g) that do and do not meet the definition of dietary fiber (81 FR 33867). The calorie contribution of soluble non-digestible carbohydrate would be added [[Page 6743]] to that sum to determine the total carbohydrate calorie contribution (Id.). Therefore, in order to harmonize with FDA's regulations, FSIS is proposing the same changes to the caloric value for soluble non- digestible carbohydrates and the calculation of calories from carbohydrate. 6. Other Carbohydrate FSIS's regulations define ``Other carbohydrate'' as the difference between total carbohydrate and the sum of dietary fiber, sugars, and sugar alcohol, except that if sugar alcohol is not declared (even if present), ``Other carbohydrate'' is defined as the difference between total carbohydrate and the sum of dietary fiber and sugars (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(iv) and 381.409(c)(6)(iv)). A statement of the number of grams of ``Other carbohydrate'' per serving may be voluntarily declared on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(6)(iv) and 381.409(c)(6)(iv)). FDA concluded that ``Other carbohydrate'' should no longer be permitted on the Nutrition Facts label because of its lack of public health significance and a quantitative intake recommendation for ``Other carbohydrate'' is not available from relevant consensus reports (81 FR 33867-33868). FDA removed the provision that allows for its voluntary declaration in the regulations (81 FR 33867-33868). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and is proposing to no longer permit the voluntary declaration of ``Other carbohydrate'' on the Nutrition Facts label for the reasons above. F. Protein FSIS's regulations require that a statement of the number of grams of protein per serving be declared on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(7) and 381.409(c)(7), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(7)). The DRV for protein is 50 g and represents 10 percent of the 2,000 reference calories intake level. Consistent with FDA, FSIS is not proposing to change the mandatory declaration of protein or the DRV for protein. 1. Analytical Methods Under FSIS's regulations (9 CFR 317.309(c)(7) and 381.409(c)(7)), protein may be calculated on the basis of the factor of 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by appropriate methods of analysis in accordance with 9 CFR 317.309(h) or 9 CFR 381.409(h), except when the procedure for a specific food requires another factor. According to 9 CFR 317.309(h)(2) and 381.409(h)(2), FSIS determines compliance by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook, or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., to determine compliance with the nutrition labeling regulations. FSIS is proposing to update the version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International referenced in the regulations because more analytical methods for nutrients have been published in later versions. The 20th edition is the most recent edition of the published AOAC methods, so FSIS is proposing in 9 CFR 413.309(h) that the 20th edition be used if no USDA method is available. If a newer version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International is published before a final rule is published for this rulemaking, FSIS will consider using the most recent version of the official AOAC methods in the final rule. G. Sodium FSIS's regulations require the declaration of the number of milligrams of sodium per serving on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(4) and 381.409(c)(4), which would be consolidated in proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(4)). Consistent with FDA, FSIS is not proposing to change the requirement that sodium be declared. FSIS's regulations set a DRV of 2,400 mg of sodium based on a reference caloric intake of 2,000 calories (9 CFR 317.309(c)(9) and 381.409(c)(9)). FDA considered the following options for updating the DRV for sodium: ``(1) A DRV of 2,300 mg which reflects the Upper Intake Level (UL) \\20\\ for individuals aged 14 years and older; (2) An RDI of 1,500 mg which reflects the AI for individuals 9 to 50 years of age; and (3) Alternative approaches such as retaining a DRV of 2,400 mg, using a tiered approach or setting a DRV of 1,900 mg based on the UL for children 4 to 9 years of age'' (79 FR 11915). In FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule, FDA tentatively concluded that 2,300 mg is the most appropriate DV for sodium to ``assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and in understanding the relative significance of the sodium content within the context of a total daily diet'' (79 FR 11917). FDA did not change its view in the final rule that 2,300 mg/day is an appropriate DRV for sodium (81 FR 33874-33880). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis, and consistent with FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule, FSIS is proposing to set a DRV of 2,300 mg for sodium (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(9)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ ``The UL is the highest average daily intake level likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for nearly all people in a particular group. The UL is not intended to be a recommended level of intake. The UL is used to assess the risk of adverse health effects from excessive nutrient intake. As intake above the UL increases, so does the potential for risk of adverse health effects'' (79 FR 11885). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- H. Fluoride FSIS's regulations do not permit the declaration of fluoride on the Nutrition Facts label. FDA amended its regulations to provide for the voluntary declaration of fluoride because fluoride's positive health effects are well established (e.g., reduces the risk of dental caries), but an appropriate quantitative intake recommendation is not available for setting a DRV (81 FR 33880-33884) (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(5)). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and consistent with FDA, FSIS is proposing to (i) permit the voluntary declaration of fluoride on the Nutrition Facts label; (ii) require the mandatory declaration of fluoride when a claim about fluoride is made on the label or in labeling of the product; and (iii) require that when fluoride content is declared, it must be expressed as zero when a serving contains less than 0.1 mg of fluoride, to the nearest 0.1 mg increment when a serving contains less than or equal to 0.8 mg of fluoride, and the nearest 0.2 mg when a serving contains more than 0.8 mg of fluoride, consistent with how FSIS and FDA have approached incremental values for other nutrients that are present in products in small amounts. FSIS is not proposing a DRV for fluoride because an appropriate quantitative intake recommendation is not available for setting a DRV. I. Essential Vitamins and Minerals 1. Updates to Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals and Reference Daily Intakes FSIS currently requires the declaration of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(8)(ii) and 381.409(c)(8)(ii)). Vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, copper, and potassium may all be declared voluntarily on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(8)(iv), [[Page 6744]] 381.409(c)(8)(iv), 317.309(c)(9), and 381.409(c)(9)). FSIS has also permitted the voluntary declaration of nutrients for which FSIS has not codified RDIs, but that are codified in Title 21 of FDA's regulations.\\21\\ These nutrients are vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/labeling/labeling-policies/trans-fat-declarations/trans-fat-declaration. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FDA amended its regulations to: (i) Require the declaration of vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium on the Nutrition Facts label; (ii) allow the voluntary declaration of vitamin A and C; (iii) retain the voluntary declaration of vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride; and (iv) allow the voluntary declaration of choline (81 FR 33884-33897). FDA made these changes based on its analysis of data and consideration of such factors as public health significance, quantitative intake recommendations, and the role of a nutrient in chronic disease risk (81 FR 33884-33897). Consistent with FDA and proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(8)(ii), the vitamins and minerals would be updated in proposed 9 CFR 413.363(b)(4) to replace ``vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron'' with ``vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.'' FDA also revised the existing RDIs for vitamins and minerals after considering the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) \\22\\ set by the IOM that reflect current nutrient requirements (81 FR 33897-33901). Percent DVs for vitamins and minerals that are required or permitted on the Nutrition Facts label are based on RDIs (9 CFR 317.309(c)(8)(iv) and 381.409(c)(8)(iv)). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ A set of reference values that include the Estimated Average Requirement, RDA, Adequate Intake, and Tolerable Upper Intake Level. See 79 FR 11885-6 for more background on DRIs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FSIS is proposing to adopt FDA's list of nutrients as mandatory or voluntary components of nutrition labeling, the definition of those nutrients, and the increments for declaring nutrients, in the interest of harmonizing with FDA (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(8)(iv)). Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is also proposing to update the RDIs for calcium, copper, folate, iodine, iron, magnesium, niacin, phosphorus, riboflavin, thiamin, zinc, and vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E and to establish RDIs for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, and choline (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(8)(iv)) (see Table 2). A more extensive discussion of FDA's list of nutrients and RDIs can be found in the preamble of FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed and Final Rules (79 FR 11918-11931; 81 FR 33897-33901).

Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IU must appear in parentheses after the declaration of the amount of vitamin D in mcg. \\5\\ 1 mg [alpha]-tocopherol (label claim) = 1 mg [alpha]-tocopherol = 1 mg RRR- [alpha]-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac-[alpha]-tocopherol. \\6\\ ``Folate'' and ``Folic Acid'' must be used for purposes of declaration in the labeling of conventional foods and dietary supplements. The declaration for folate must be in mcg DFE (when expressed as a quantitative amount by weight in a conventional food or a dietary supplement), and percent DV based on folate in mcg DFE. Folate may be expressed as a percent DV in conventional foods. When folic acid is added or when a claim is made about the nutrient, folic acid must be declared in parentheses, as mcg of folic acid. \\7\\ These minerals currently have a DRV and we are proposing to establish an RDI. [[Page 6745]] 2. Terms for Vitamins and Minerals FSIS currently allows the term ``Folacin'' to be added in parenthesis immediately following the term ``Folate'' on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.309(c)(8)(v) and 381.409(c)(8)(v)). FSIS is proposing to remove the synonym ``folacin'' from 9 CFR 317.309(c)(8)(v) and 381.409(c)(8)(v) and require that the term ``folate'' be used on meat and poultry products that contain folate, folic acid, or a mixture of folate and folic acid (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(8)(vii)). The declaration must be folate in mcg DFE (when expressed as a quantitative amount by weight) and the percent Daily Value based on folate in mcg DFE, or may be expressed as folate and the percent DV based on folate in mcg DFE. Because of the proposed changes to the units of measure for folate that take into account the differences between folate and folic acid, FSIS is proposing that when folic acid is added or when a claim is made about the nutrient, folic acid must be declared in parentheses as mcg of folic acid after the folate declaration. FSIS's proposed changes are consistent with FDA's Nutrition Labeling Final Rule (81 FR 33909-33912). J. Labeling of Foods for Infants, Young Children, and Pregnant or Lactating Women The general labeling requirements for foods in 9 CFR 317.309(c) and 381.409(c) apply to foods for infants, young children, and pregnant women and lactating women with certain exceptions. For example, meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for infants and children less than 4 years of age are not permitted to include declarations of percent DV for the following nutrients: Total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber (9 CFR 317.400(c)(2)(i) and 381.500(c)(2)(i)). There are additional exceptions to labeling for meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age. For example, these foods are also not permitted to declare calories from fat, calories from saturated fat, saturated fat, stearic acid, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat and cholesterol on the Nutrition Facts label (9 CFR 317.400(c)(1) and 381.500(c)(1)). FSIS regulations do not include DRVs or RDIs for nutrients, generally, for infants, children under 4 years of age, or pregnant women and lactating women. However, there are requirements for a DRV for protein for children 4 or more years of age, and an RDI for protein for each of the following subpopulations: (1) Children less than 4 years of age; (2) infants; (3) pregnant women; and (4) lactating women (9 CFR 317.309(c)(7)(iii) and 381.409(c)(7)(iii)). FDA changed its requirements for the labeling of foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant women and lactating women after considering current consensus reports, changes to the Nutrition Facts label, and comments to its 2007 ANPRM (81 FR 33916- 33932). FSIS has reviewed FDA's analysis and is proposing to make consistent changes to its requirements for the labeling of meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant women and lactating women (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)). 1. Age Range for Infants and Young Children FSIS regulations currently use the age ranges ``less than 2 years of age'' and ``less than 4 years of age'' to establish labeling requirements for meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for infants and young children (9 CFR 317.400(c) and 381.500(c)). FDA amended its regulations so that the age categories were changed to infants through 12 months and young children 1 through 3 years (13 through 48 months) which would be consistent with the age ranges used in the IOM's DRIs for infants and children (81 FR 33916- 33917). FDA's new DVs are also based on these age-specific DRIs (81 FR 33916-33917) Consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing to replace the current category of infants and children less than 4 years in 9 CFR 317.400(c)(1); 381.500(c)(1); 317.309(c)(7)-(8); 381.409(c)(7)-(8); 317.309(d)(1); 381.409(d)(1); 317.313(b)(3); 381.413(b)(3); 317.313(q)(3); and 381.413(q)(3) with infants through 12 months and children 1 through 3 years of age (proposed 9 CFR 413.400(c)(1); 413.309(c)(7)-(9); 413.309(d)(1); 413.313(b)(3); and 413.313(q)(3)). 2. Mandatory Declaration of Calories and Other Nutrients Currently, meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for infants and children less than 4 years must declare certain nutrients, including calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, sugars, dietary fiber, and protein (9 CFR 317.400(c)(2) and 381.500(c)(2)). For meat and poultry products represented or purported to be for infants and children less than 2 years, the declaration of certain nutrients, which include calories from fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, is not required or permitted (9 CFR 317.400(c)(1) and 381.500(c)(1)). a. Declaration of Saturated Fat and Cholesterol Because FSIS is proposing new categories of infants through 12 months and children 1 through 3 years of age, FSIS is considering whether there is a need to require or permit the declaration of calories from fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol in the labeling for foods represented or purported to be specifically for these subpopulations. As discussed in section II.B.1. above, FSIS is proposing to no longer require and not permit the declaration of calories from fat on the Nutrition Facts label (proposed 9 CFR 413.309(c)(1)(ii)). Therefore, if these proposed changes are finalized, the exception in 9 CFR 317.400(c)(1) and 381.500(c)(1) for calories from fat will no longer be needed, and the reference to calories from fat will be removed. FSIS's regulations currently do not require or permit the labeling of any fat, with the exception of total fat, or fatty acids on meat and poultry products represented or purported to be specifically for children less than 2 years of age. FDA considered a recent consensus report suggesting that: Fat intake in infants less than 12 months of age should not be restricted. Fat is still an important source of calories for infants and young children. Evidence suggests a diet with saturated fat of less than 10 percent of calories and cholesterol intake less than 300 mg/d can safely and effectively reduce the levels of total and LDL cholesterol in healthy children, and that the 2010 DGA recommended that Americans 2 years of age and older consume less saturated fatty acids and less than 300 mg/d of cholesterol (79 FR 11934). FDA requires, except for the declaration of calories from fat, the mandatory declaration of statutorily required nutrients under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act that include saturated fat and cholesterol on the label of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and children 1 through 3 years of age (81 FR 33917-33918). Therefore, consistent with FDA's final rule, FSIS is proposing to require the declaration of saturated fat and cholesterol on the label of meat and poultry products purported to be for infants through 12 months and children 1 through 3 years of age (proposed 9 CFR 413.400(c)(1)). [[Page 6746]] Currently, meat and poultry products consumed by pregnant women and lactating women must declare certain nutrients, including calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, sugars, dietary fiber, and protein. As discussed in FDA's Nutrition Labeling Proposed Rule, women of reproductive age consume the same foods as the general population and, in general, continue consuming similar foods during pregnancy and lactation (79 FR 11934). FDA requires, except for the declaration of calories from fat, the mandatory declaration of statutorily required nutrients under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act (81 FR 33917-33918). Accordingly, FSIS is proposing to require the mandatory declaration of calories and the amount of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, and protein on foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age, children 1 through 3 years of age, and pregnant women and lactating women and to permit the declaration of calories from saturated fat such that these nutrients would be subject to the same re"
