        "meta_description": "Author Summary Leptospirosis is the most widespread bacterial infection transmitted from animals to man. Humans are exposed to infection when host animals that harbor the bacteria in their kidneys shed them in their urine. Human infections, caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans, frequently result in a life-threatening illness characterized by liver and kidney failure. In the hamster model of leptospirosis, signs of hepatic and renal dysfunction developed on days 6 and 7, respectively, after intradermal and subcutaneous inoculation of L. interrogans. Renal dysfunction was preceded by the development of inflammatory changes and the appearance of large numbers of leptospires in the kidney on day 5. On day 6, animals began to lose weight, became dehydrated, and had elevated numbers of neutrophils circulating in their bloodstream. Importantly, animals inoculated intradermally had lower numbers of bacteria in their liver and kidneys on day 6 than animals inoculated subcutaneously and lower weight loss and circulating neutrophil levels on day 7. These studies show that the hamster model of leptospirosis is similar to human infection and indicate that the route of infection has significant effects on the course of the illness.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonosis with worldwide distribution caused by spirochetes that are spread by reservoir animals to humans and other accidental hosts. Up to 500,000 severe human infections are documented annually in tropical areas with an incidence of >10 cases per 100,000 population [1]–[3]. Clinical severity ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening disease characterized by hepatorenal failure with or without pulmonary hemorrhage. The mortality rate for severe leptospirosis ranges from 5–40% [4], [5]. Leptospirosis typically occurs in persons living in socioeconomically deprived conditions after exposure to flooding in humid, subtropical regions where conditions are favorable for environmental survival of the bacteria [6]–[8]. Contamination of water or soil occurs through urinary shedding by reservoir host animals. Although rodents are frequently the source of organisms causing human infections, many mammalian species have been found to harbor infection in their kidneys [9].\n\nAcquisition of infection by a new host can occur through several possible routes, with cutaneous lesions as a major portal of entry [10]. The morphology and motility of leptospires and other spirochetes enhances their ability to penetrate across the skin and other tissue barriers, enter the bloodstream and disseminate to various organs via the endothelium [11]–[13]. Leptospirosis occurs as a dual-phase disease with a leptospiremic phase in the first week characterized by fever, myalgias, and other flu-like symptoms [14]. The immune phase begins as antibodies are produced and organisms are cleared from the bloodstream, associated with aseptic meningitis and recurrence of fever. In severe leptospirosis, the two phases may be obscured by the rapid progression of illness from its onset, leading to liver and kidney dysfunction characterized by jaundice and azotemia, respectively [4], [15]. Animal models have been shown to recapitulate the two stages of disease by examining the time to appearance of organisms in various tissues depending on the challenge route [16]–[19]. These initial studies primarily involved microscopic observations and isolation of leptospires from experimentally infected guinea pigs and hamsters, which are highly susceptible to infection with virulent leptospires. More recently, sensitive and quantitative PCR methods have been used to measure the leptospiral burden in various organs after intraperitoneal (IP) challenge [20], [21].\n\nIP inoculation is the most common method employed in animal models of leptospirosis including hamsters and guinea pigs. Although this challenge route has certain technical advantages, it is not a natural route of infection as it bypasses relevant mucosal and cutaneous defense mechanisms. Other routes of inoculation such as epicutaneous, conjunctival, subcutaneous, intradermal, oral, intracardiac and intracranial have been reported [16], [20], [22]–[24], but quantification of leptospiral organ burden has only been described for the intraperitoneal route [20], [21]. Development of animal models that reproduce natural routes of transmission is critical to understanding host-pathogen interactions occurring early in leptospiral infection. In this study, we compared the kinetics of leptospiral infection after inoculation of hamsters via subcutaneous vs. intradermal routes of infection and compared changes in leptospiral burden in target organs with progression of disease as measured by body weight, changes in blood chemistry and vascular endothelial growth factor levels, histopathology, and antibody response.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe hamster is one of most widely used animal models of acute leptospirosis infection because of its reproducibility and the susceptibility of hamsters to a wide variety of pathogenic Leptospira strains [16], [19], [31], [32]. However, little is known about the relative burden of organisms in key organs such as the kidney and liver, and the role of leptospiral burden in disease [20]. For this reason, we were interested in examining the time course of infection relative to an array of disease parameters including body weight, histopathology, inflammatory markers, and markers of renal and hepatic function. Organisms were detected in the kidney by qPCR at levels significantly above background by days 1 and 3 after infection by the SQ and ID routes, respectively. Beginning on day 4 or 5 after infection by either the ID or SQ routes, we observed a major increase in leptospiral burden in the kidney, with the appearance of renal and perinephric histopathology changes on day 5. These histopathology changes were followed one day later (day 6) by deterioration in kidney function, as demonstrated by an elevation in serum creatinine, and the onset of weight loss. The rapid progression from infection to disease that we observed in hamsters mimics the lack of a biphasic pattern of illness seen in severe human leptospirosis. Daily measurement of hamster weight provides a sensitive and objective measure of health, and as in our previous study [26], utilization of ≥10% weight loss from maximum weight as an endpoint criterion completely prevented spontaneous death. Weight loss occurred simultaneously with elevation of total serum proteins, indicating that these changes were due to leptospirosis-induced dehydration and hemoconcentration through decreased fluid intake and impairment of sodium reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules [28].\n\nThe peak in the burden of infection on days 5 and 6, followed closely by or concurrent with the onset of weight loss, elevation of inflammatory markers, and changes in blood analytical chemistry results indicative of renal and hepatic dysfunction, implies a causal relationship. Elevation in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is a typical response to systemic infection that is also observed in human leptospirosis [4]. In our study, the ANC was found to peak at 5- to 6-fold over the normal values for uninfected hamsters (Figure 2). It is unclear what role neutrophils had in the subsequent decrease in the burden of organisms in the kidney and liver. In vitro studies suggest that neutrophils are unable to kill pathogenic leptospires unless specific antibody is present [33], [34]. However, we were not able to detect circulating leptospiral antibodies until day 8 after infection, and only in animals challenged intradermally (Figure 5). It is possible that leptospiral antibodies were not detectable in the serum at earlier timepoints because antibodies were complexed with organisms due to a state of antigen excess. The association between detectable anti-leptospiral antibody levels and lower tissue burdens of organisms in intradermally challenged hamsters is consistent with a known protective role for the humoral immune response in leptospirosis [35].\n\nLevels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were examined as an additional marker of inflammation. Elevated VEGF levels, as documented in our study, have been found to be an important determinant of morbidity and mortality in the mouse model of sepsis [36]. Kidney and liver dysfunction are hallmarks of the severe form of leptospirosis known as Weil's syndrome. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, deterioration in renal function and elevation in liver enzymes mirrored the peak in leptospiral burden in the kidneys and liver. We have previously shown high numbers of leptospires in the glomeruli and hepatic sinusoids during acute leptospirosis [37] and others have shown that leptospiral infection leads to hepatocyte apoptosis as a mechanism of liver dysfunction in the guinea pig model of leptospirosis [38].\n\nThe qPCR approach allowed us to document striking 8- and 13-fold increases in leptospiral burden in the kidney between days 3 and 4 after ID challenge and between days 4 and 5 after SQ challenge, respectively. As shown in Figure 6, these dramatic increases in burden of infection in the kidney are in stark contrast to relatively low rates of change on other days suggesting delivery of organisms to the kidney from the bloodstream and/or multiplication within the kidney. A similar increase in the burden of infection in the kidney between days 5 and 6 after ip challenge has also been reported by Lourdault et al. [20], although in that guinea pig study, qPCR levels were significantly higher in the liver than the kidney. In contrast, we observed a higher burden of organisms in the kidney than the liver. These differences in organ predilection could be due to a variety of factors including the virulence of the leptospiral strain, the host animal species, the route of infection and/or immune-mediated delivery mechanisms.\n\nThe fold change in kidney burden relative to the previous day as determined by qPCR was plotted for animals challenged intradermally (ID) vs. subcutaneously (SQ). There was a one-day surge in the burden of organisms in the kidney several days after challenge that was larger and later in animals challenged via the SQ route as compared to the ID route.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003307.g006\n\nA limitation of this study is that leptospiremia levels were not measured in the blood. However, bacterial burdens were measured in the spleen, and given its role in blood filtration, the spleen can be considered as a surrogate for the blood. Another limitation is that some of the bacterial burden found in organs was due to residual blood, given that animals were not perfused with saline prior to organ harvesting. Nevertheless, bacterial burdens were higher in the kidney than in either the spleen or liver by more than an order of magnitude. These data indicate that leptospires selectively target the kidneys during infection and substantiate the contribution of the higher bacterial burdens to the pathogenesis of kidney dysfunction. The predilection for kidney infection was observed at early time points. Organisms were detected in the kidney by qPCR at levels significantly above background by day 1 and 3 after infection by the SQ and ID routes, respectively. Homing to the kidney by leptospires may be mediated either by leptospiral factors such as kidney-specific adhesins or by production of anti-leptospiral antibodies. Colonization of the lumen of proximal renal tubules has been documented by immunohistochemistry as early as 4 days after intraperitoneal challenge [39].\n\nA novel aspect of our study was the comparison of the SQ and ID challenge routes with the finding of significant differences in the kinetics of infection. The differences in leptospiral tissue burden were most pronounced on day 6, when we observed 31- and 36-fold higher levels of leptospiral DNA in kidney and liver tissues respectively, after SQ compared to ID inoculation. The lower leptospiral burden in kidney and liver was reflected in less weight loss on day 7 and better survival in ID challenged animals. The ID route is of interest because it is a biologically relevant route of infection in individuals with abrasions and cutaneous exposure. An ID challenge model incorporates interactions between leptospires and defense mechanisms of the skin, such as the dendritic cells, that may function as an early warning system for the immune response. Prompt immune activation during the earliest stages of the transmission process is to the advantage of the host if it results in early clearance of organisms and a lower leptospiral burden. The intradermal route may also be of interest as a more reliable way to evaluate transmission-blocking vaccines using surface antigens that are either expressed in the environmental phase or early in infection."
