It provides the flexibility and tool box with which scientists can experimentally manipulate and study behavior as well as gene expression in specific, defined population of cells in their normal tissue contexts. The utility and increasing value of a sophisticated genetic system of flies, the tool box available for studying physiological function, functional imaging, neural circuitry from gut to brain, taste receptors expression and controlling gene expression by determining the specific cells in the intestine, makes fly gut the most useful tissue for studying the regulation of feeding behavior under changing internal state. To understand the intestine and its connectivity with the brain, Drosophila has proved an ideal model organism for studying gut brain axis aspects of human metabolic diseases. Various markers and fly lines are available to characterize the expression of transgenes in the intestine. The newly generated genetic tools aim to streamline the design of experiments to target specific cells in intestine for genetic manipulations based on their type and location within physiologically specialized intestinal regions. This chapter will be useful for understanding post-ingestive sensing system that mediate food preferences and to investigate fundamental biological processes and model human diseases at the level of single cells in the fly gut. Furthermore, the utility of adult fly gut can be extended to the study of dietary and environmental factors relevant to health and disease by screening for cells and micro circuits stimulated by internal state or the consumption of various nutrients.",

        "text": "2.3 The fly intestine functions\n\nLike the regional specialization of digestive functions, the expression of digestive enzymes has also been found to confined to specific segments of the digestive tract in flies [12, 46, 47]. In addition to its roles in nutrient extraction and utilization, the digestive tract responds to the food and bacteria in its lumen. Digestion takes place in fly midgut [48] which can be further modulated by various factors like temperature, redox potential, pH, and intestinal transit [8, 48]. It has been shown that the expression and activity of digestive enzymes are tightly regulated in many insects like enzymes involved in the breakdown of sugars in flies are enriched in anterior (R1/R3) portions of the adult midgut and Peptidase genes express more posteriorly [47].\n\nThe enzymatic activity of the intestine is a key factor determining availability of certain nutrients. A substantial reduction of intestinal digestive enzyme activities (trypsin, chymotrypsin, aminopeptidase, and acetate esterase) has been reported in flies lacking EE cells [49]. Though not extensively investigated in Drosophila, modulation by nutrient quality and quantity, neuronal activity, and endocrine signals has been described in many insects [8, 50, 51]. Models suggesting role of ECs in integrating information about sugar uptake (sensed intrinsically in the intestine by Mondo-Bigmax) and the carbohydrate status of the fat body (relayed by TGF-β/Activin signaling) to modulate expression of the carbohydrate digestive enzymes have been proposed. Repression mechanism involving the TGF-β/Activin ligand Dawdle (Daw) which, upon refeeding with nutritious sugars (but not non-nutritious sugars) after a period of starvation, reduces the expression of carbohydrate digestive enzymes in the adult ECs [52]. Activation of the intracellular sugar sensor complex Mondo-Bigmax promotes the expression of both Daw and the transcription factor sugarbabe (sug) [53]. Sug further repress the expression of amylases. Low cholesterol in the diet upregulate expression of the Hr96 nuclear receptor (homologous to the vertebrate LXR receptor involved in regulated cholesterol homeostasis) [54]. Hr96 binds cholesterol and promotes the expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis and lipid breakdown including Magro (Mag) [54, 55, 56]. Mag plays a dual role in breaking down intestinal cholesterol esters to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. It also enables triacylglyceride (TAG) breakdown, required for intestinal lipid absorption and peripheral fat accumulation [56, 57]. It has been suggested that intestinal mag expression can also repressed by a sugar-rich diet in a foxo-dependent manner [58]. Such a mechanism becomes chronically active in the aging intestine due to disrupting lipid homeostasis and activation of JNK pathway affecting the metabolic homeostasis [58].\n\n2.3.1 Role in nutrients absorption\n\nCarbohydrates: A diverse array of transporters internalizes simple sugars into the ECs for further digestion and absorption [59] in insects like Glucose transporters, the GLUT/Slc2 family of facilitative glucose transporters and the SGLT/Slc5 family of Na+-glucose symporters [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. GLUT-like gene has been described in flies [65]. Drosophila genome harbors homologs of other glucose transporters including a homolog of SWEET family of sugar transporters [66, 67] a disaccharide transporter Slc45–1 [68]; trehalose transporters (Tret1–1 and Tret1–2) [69] and Slc45–1 (can transport sucrose) [68, 70]. The possible intestinal activity of many of these transporters deserves further investigation.\n\nProteins: A mixture of amino acids, di- and tri-peptides are products of protein break down. This chemical diversity is handled by a broad range of apical and basolateral transport systems (many are homologous to known mammalian transporter systems) [59, 71]. Drosophila homologs of cationic amino acid transporters [72], ion-dependent and independent amino acid transporters for neutral amino acids [73, 74, 75, 76] and oligopeptide transporters [77, 78] are some examples. Intestinal expression of amino acid transporters Pathetic [74] has also been reported. Minidiscs [73], NAT1 and other Slc6 family members [75, 79], and the oligopeptide transporters Yin and CG2930, with enriched expression in proventriculus/hindgut and midgut [77, 78] has been shown. The nature, physiological modulation, and significance of many of these amino acid/oligopeptide transporters remains to be investigated.\n\nLipids and sterols: Intestinal lipid transport in Drosophila is still undetermined. Intestinal cells absorb free fatty acids, glycerol, mono- and diacylglycerols, and phospholipid derivatives (products of lipid digestion) along with dietary sterols. Diffusion and emulsification have been proposed for absorption [80]. Vertebrates emulsify by covering lipids with bile salts, but in insects emulsification is achieved by forming fatty acid-amino acid and glycolipid complexes, as well as fatty acids and lysophospholipid micelles [80]. In ECs, the products of lipid breakdown are used to resynthesize diacylglycerols and TAG. They get packaged together with cholesterol and fat body-derived carrier proteins to form lipoprotein particles and trafficked throughout the body [81] ensuring that the products of lipid breakdown are kept at low concentrations inside the ECs, which may facilitate diffusion. Mutants in which lipoprotein secretion from the fat body is compromised has revealed both anterior and posterior midgut regions as sites of lipid efflux [81]. The absorption of sterols is crucial to insects as they cannot synthesize sterols and require a dietary source of sterol for the synthesis of the steroid molting hormone ecdysone. In DrosophilaNiemann-Pick Chomologs-Npc1a and Npc2a are broadly required for intracellular sterol trafficking [82], whereas Npc1b is expressed in the midgut and is required for intestinal sterol absorption [83].\n\nChanges in the expression of p38 kinase or the Atf3 and Foxo transcription factors cause accumulation of neutral lipid in ECs [58, 84]. It has been shown that neutral lipid increase following depletion of the EE hormone Tk [85], or in sterile female flies after mating [86]. It has been suggested that activation of intestinal lipogenesis is key to survival in diet-restricted flies. Indeed, nutrient scarcity induces expression of the sugar sensor transcription factor sug in the intestine which, in turn, promotes intestinal lipogenesis. Internal nutritional challenges may be equally dependent on deployment of these intestinal adaptations [86].\n\n2.3.2 Intestinal pH\n\nMany animals generate localized regions of low pH inside the intestinal lumen to facilitate protein breakdown, absorption of minerals and metals, and limit the survival of ingested microbes. While mammalian digestion takes place in acidic conditions, insect digestion occurs at neutral or basic pH including Drosophila (neutral or mildly alkaline). Luminal pH does, however, display consistent transitions along the length of the intestine and becomes strongly acidic (pH 2–4) in the copper cell region of both larvae and adults [24, 87, 88]. Posterior to this region, the midgut lumen becomes mildly alkaline again (pH 7–9), but is again acidified in the hindgut (pH 5), partly as a result of discharges from the malpighian tubules. Diet affects the acidity of rectal ampulla where final pH adjustments may take place [14]. Copper cells are specialized ECs with a highly invaginated apical membrane, similar to the mammalian gastric parietal cells [89]. During aging in adult flies, genetic interference with copper cell identity or their progressive loss are associated with loss of gut acidity [90].\n\nThe contribution of five ion transporters enriched in the acidic region have been studied [88]. These include: the potassium/chloride symporter Kazachoc (Kcc), a member the Slc12 family of electroneutral cation-chloride transporters (express in intestine) [91, 92]; the Slowpoke pore-forming subunit of a calcium-activated K+ channel (express in neurons, muscles, tracheal cells, and two types of midgut ECs in the copper and iron cell regions) [93]; the ligand-gated chloride channel pHCL-2 which, in addition to regulating fluid secretion in malpighian tubules (express in the copper cell, iron, and large flat cell regions of the midgut) [94, 95]; the carbonic anhydrase CAH1; and the bicarbonate/chloride exchanger CG8177, belonging to the Slc4a1–3 subfamily of anion exchangers (express in a specific midgut pattern similar to that of pHCl-2) [96]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the transport of H+, Cl−, K+, and HCO3− contributes to acid generation in the Drosophila midgut.\n\n2.3.3 Water and osmolytes\n\nFlies extract water from their diet to maintain hydration and ionic balance. This compensates for substantial water loss resulting from metabolic and physiological processes. Although malpighian tubules are important for this process, but intestine also contributes. Water absorption from the food occurs in the insect midgut and in rectal pads of rectum [8]. The rectal pads are also the crucial site for reabsorption of ions. Ions and water can cross the intestinal epithelium through or between cells and their transport play an important role in the maintenance of ion gradients that sustain active transport in the intestinal epithelium. The scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET) provides a way to probe intestinal gradients for ions such as K+, Na+, H+, or Cl− [24, 97]. K+ and Na+ absorption occur largely in the large flat cell and posterior regions of the midgut and, also in the anterior hindgut in the case of Na+ [97]. The two Drosophila Nha members express in intestine epithelia and their ubiquitous knockdown decrease survival, especially under Na+ stress [12, 98, 99, 100]. Including kcc, four different genes encoding homologs of the cation-Cl− Slc12 cotransporters express in osmoregulatory organs (gut, anal pads, and Malpighian tubules) [91, 92].\n\n2.3.4 Metal ions\n\nMetal ions such as copper, iron and zinc are essential micronutrients required for the correct folding and activity of a broad range of enzymes. The contribution of the intestine to metal homeostasis has not been extensively investigated but midgut regions, the Cu cell and Fe regions, are the most proposed sites of metal ion absorption. The Cu cell region turns bright luminescent orange upon Cu ingestion due to the fixation of copper by metallothionein [101, 102], and appears to be an important site of accumulation of ingested radioactively labeled Cu [101, 103]. The Fe cell region in R4a stains by Prussian blue and also accumulates exogenously administered radioactive Fe [101, 104]. Many studies have confirmed the roles for the Cu/Fe regions by exploring the molecular machinery involved in the intestinal uptake, intracellular trafficking, and efflux of metal ions.\n\n2.3.5 Transit and excretion\n\nNutrient extraction and utilization may get affected by the passage of food along the alimentary canal and by its subsequent excretion. Transport of food to travel the entire length of the digestive tract takes less than 1 hour [105] in flies. As suggested, the amount of food retained in the crop is much larger in starved flies then refed flies than in flies fed ad libitum [2, 105]. Starvation also lowers defecation rate long before the gut is emptied [14]. Chronic food deprivation during the larval life has been shown to subsequently increase excretion in adult flies [106]. The hindgut may contribute to the pH adjustment of excreta, which may help offset the excess acid produced [14]. Changes in intestinal fluid retention are likely to involve the distal part of the hindgut (rectum and/or rectal glands), as known for its role in water reabsorption in other insects [8], and may help maximize absorption at a time of high nutritional demand. Such a mechanism is partly mediated by the sex peptide transferred by males during copulation [14, 107], affecting the HGN1 (Hindgut Neuron1) subset of hindgut-innervating neurons [14]. Further investigations are required to clarify the connections between intestinal fluid retention, absorption, peristalsis, and excretion where crop may prove to be a key organ, given that its differential peristalsis and engorgement can determine whether food is temporarily stored or released into the midgut for digestion and absorption [4]. Apart from affecting the nervous system, mutations in the drop-dead gene are also associated with increased crop size, reduced transfer of ingested food from the crop to the midgut, and reduced defecation [108, 109].\n\n3.2 Gut-brain Neural Circuits\n\n3.2.1 Humans\n\nNutrient signaling and sensing are fundamental processes that animals including humans and flies undergo [131]. Proper coordination and communication between gut and brain is necessary to regulate metabolic homeostasis and physiology in all animals. In this regard, many research groups have shown the role of enteric neurons and endocrine signals as important mediators of these processes. The way the enteric nervous system communicates to the brain via neural circuits is a multifaceted question and poorly explored. In mammals such as humans, alterations in neuropeptides and brain – gut hormone levels can derail people otherwise on the path to a healthy life. These changes can also lead to diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndrome and diabetes [132].\n\nGluconeogenesis is a biochemical pathway by which animals make sugars from non-carbohydrate precursors and sources [133]. It is used to regulate homeostasis and a stable internal state in post – fed state [134]. Studies in rats showed that stimulation of intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) sends a signal from sodium – glucose co- transporters present at the intestinal mucosa to the brain, initiating a neural gut – brain axis [135, 136, 137]. Diets rich in protein [138, 139, 140] and fiber [141] promote IGN stressing on the importance of nutrient sensing for initiating several gut – brain axis [137]. It has been found that μ – opoid receptors (MOR) regulate IGN. These receptors (present in the nerves in the portal vein wall) react to neuropeptides to stimulate a gut – brain neural circuit that affects IGN, hunger and satiety mechanisms [141]. Further analysis of MOR deficient mice shows the role of MORs in regulating food intake, referred as “reward” system [142, 143]. Analyses of MOR-knockouts (MOR-KO) demonstrate how they play a role in managing satiety effects of alimentary proteins, through a neural gut-brain circuit [140].\n\nVagus nerve (VN; pneumogastric nerve) is the longest cranial nerve [144] in humans which runs from the medulla oblongata in brain to colon in GI [145]. It innervates other structures as well such as larynx, pharynx, heart and lungs thus affects digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system – all at one [146]. Vagal efferent send down signals from the brain to gut, which accounts for about 10% – 20% of all the nerve fibers. Remaining 80% is accounted for by the vagal afferents carrying information from the gut to the brain [147]. Vagal sensory neurons in the GI keep an eye on stomach volume and luminal contents through different neural circuits [148]. VN contains and branches into several sensory neurons (~2300 in mouse) that further innervate and render support and supply to other internal organs. A variety of sensory neurons, one side facing the brainstem and the terminal one facing the organ such as GI [149] have been revealed. Free terminals of vagal afferents are rooted within lamina propria of intestinal villi [148]. Some mammalian models like in cat and rat, it has been shown how these sensory neurons detect different nutrients in diets with the help of unambiguous and explicit fibers [150, 151, 152]. Vagal afferent endings in the intestine express several mechanosensitive as well as chemical receptors [153]. Glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP1) is a gut hormone receptor that intercedes the nutrient sensing mechanism via VN [154]. GLP1R (GLP1 receptor) is present in many cells [155]. Agonists for GLP1R show how it affects brain further proving its presence in both, gut and brain [156]. Another receptor of vagal afferents, GPR65 near the intestinal villi, plays a role in nutrient detection drawing attention to how these sensory neurons are a part of the gut – brain axis [157, 158]. It detects serotonin and impact gut motility [147]. Such receptors detect several hormones present in the gut, like choleocystokinin (CKK), ghrelin and leptin which play a role in the regulation of hunger and satiety [159, 160, 161]. Because of its role in gut motility and mobility, VN and its afferent neurons present in the gut play a role in Intestinal Bowel Syndrome (IBS) [162] and new treatment plans around the same are being looked at in rat [162] and mice [158] models.\n\nTo take the findings in vagal nerves forward, nerves allowing communication of cNST (caudal nucleus of the solitary tract) with gut were focused on. Information about sugar detection to cNST via gut – brain axis is a topic of research nowadays. In live mice, it is noticed that glucose detection by cNST is robust and VN transaction silences that activation [163]. Nodose ganglion of vagus nerve when silenced prevents the sugar preference of cNST [163] suggesting the presence of a physical gut – brain axis. It has been shown that inactivation of sugar-activated cSNT prevents the mice to choose sugar from water or an artificial sweetener [163]. This study specifically calls attention to how organisms have paths for detecting nutrient signals, sensing them in the diet and also have circuitries to carry forward the signals and communicate with the rest of the body, purposely the brain.\n\n3.2.2 Drosophila\n\nWith the help of several markers and reporter genes, it is found that Drosophila intestine is innervated by neurons- efferent and sensory [14]. Other studies have stated that fly’s gut receives innervations from three regions – stomato-gastric nervous system [164, 165, 166, 167]; the corpora cardiaca, neurosecretory structures [168]; and neurons located in the CNS extending their axons toward three different portions of the digestive tract [14, 169, 170, 171, 172]. The expression of Ret receptor tyrosine kinase in gut innervating neurons in adult fly has recently been shown to contribute to the development of stomato- gastric ganglia in flies [173, 174]. In contrast to mammalian gastrointestinal tracts which are profusely innervated throughout their entire length, the innervation of the fly’s digestive tract is restricted to only three different portions. The first is the anterior-most slice comprising the pharynx, esophagus, crop and anterior midgut. The second is midgut/hindgut junction and third is the posterior hindgut [14, 164, 167, 172]. Muscle valves present in all three regions support and regulate peristaltic regulation and intestinal transit functions of gut-innervating neurons. Most neurites terminate on the visceral muscles and some reach the underlying epithelium, particularly in the esophagus, proventriculus, pyloric valve, and rectal ampulla [14, 175] suggesting neuronal regulation of epithelial properties such as secretion or absorption. In flies, not all innervation is efferent. Gustatory neuron afferents from the pharynx send their axons to the suboesophageal zone (SEZ, the primary taste center of the fly brain), where they target a distinct domain adjacent to the projections of other (leg/labellum) gustatory receptor neurons [176, 177, 178, 179]. Dendrites of peripheral sensory neurons can be seen in the anterior and posterior-most regions of the digestive tract [14], and appear most abundant in the esophagus and anterior midgut.\n\nIn the anterior portion of adult and larval midgut, serotonin positive neurites and various neuropeptides including Akh, Dh44, Myosuppressin, and possibly Allatostatin C and FMRFamide (or an FMRFamide-like peptide such as the NPY-like neuropeptide short neuropeptide F [sNPF]) [131, 168, 172, 180, 181, 182] have been described suggesting chemical diversity of enteric innervation. Four serotonergic neurons are found to innervate the enteric nervous system in fly larva. These neurons project from the antennal nerve (AN) near the SEZ and extend throughout the ENs [14]. These projections end at the anterior region of the midgut and are primarily around the proventriculus region and the foregut. These innervations are considered structurally analogous to the mammalian VN because of similar projections from the brain to the different structures of the foregut. It is yet to be seen if there are functional similarities as well [172].\n\nPigment- dispersing factor (Pdf), Ion transport peptide, and Proctolin positive neurites have been reported in the larval and adult hindgut [169, 183, 184, 185, 186]. All three innervated regions receive insulinergic innervation from the CNS; the pars intercerebralis (PI) insulin-producing cells extend axons beyond the ring gland that innervate the anterior midgut and crop in adult flies (Figure 3), and the insulin-like peptide 7 (Ilp7)-producing neurons of the abdominal ganglion innervate the midgut/hindgut junction and the rectal ampulla [170, 187]. Interestingly, putative dendritic termini of both kinds of insulin-producing neurons have been found in very close proximity in the CNS. This data suggests the release of different insulins to the different portions of the digestive tract may be co-regulated centrally [14].\n\nFunctional studies of insect innervation have primarily focused on the control of peristalsis and peptide hormone secretion so far. Studies of peristaltic regulation in flies have primarily concerned the effects of neuropeptides (Allatostatins, Myosuppressin, or Drosulfakinins) on ex vivo intestinal preparations [188, 189, 190, 191] ascribing distinct roles for these peptides in the modulation of crop or anterior midgut contractions in adults. Both intestinal and non-intestinal roles of Pdf-expressing neurons in the regulation of muscle peristalsis for a set of hindgut-innervating neurons located in the abdominal ganglion of the CNS have been demonstrated [171, 192]. It is found that this neural source of Pdf (a neuropeptide related to mammalian vasoactive intestinal polypeptides, known for its roles in the central circadian clock) promotes peristalsis of hindgut muscles and sustains the defecation cycle in larvae [192]. Pdf can also promote contractions of the muscles of the ureters, the proximal part of the malpighian tubules [171]. Hence, the digestive tract is used by some enteric neurons as a docking site to exert their functions on other internal organs at some distance.\n\nRecently epithelial roles for gut-innervating neurons e.g. role in the control of fluid balance have been revealed by a semi-automated analysis of defecation behavior in adult flies, providing quantitative readouts for food intake, fluid/ion balance, and intestinal transit [14, 193]. The HGN1 neurons (2–5 CNS neurons located in the posterior segments of the abdominal ganglion) innervate the hindgut and the rectum (Figure 3), with a subset of their neurites projecting through the visceral muscles to reach the underlying epithelium [14]. HGN1 neuronal silencing experiments resulted in increased defecation rate. These neurons are shown to be required for the post-mating changes in intestinal fluid retention due to their epithelial innervation. It has been established that HGN1 neurons and the Pdf hindgut-innervating neurons have their direct action on the hindgut and anal sphincter muscles [192]. A role for gut-innervating neurons in the maintenance of epithelial turnover has also been suggested by the finding of anatomical proximity between enteric neurites in the posterior midgut and adult somatic intestinal progenitors, and the reduced ISC to EC differentiation resulting from downregulating Hedgehog (Hh) signaling (albeit pan-neuronally) [194]. The more anterior innervation of the proventriculus may also play a role in maintaining gut permeability. This is inferred from the finding that inactivation of a relatively broad subset of neurons, including a subset of anterior midgut-innervating neurons results in an abnormal proventricular structure, increased permeability of the epithelial barrier, and increased susceptibility to oral bacterial infection: all suggestive of defects in the production of peritrophic matrix [175].\n\nIn adult flies, inactivation of insulin-producing neurons results in contrasting effects on the hyperphagic response triggered by nutrient scarcity. Silencing of the insulin-producing cells of the brain PI that innervates the anterior midgut lowered this response, whereas silencing of the hindgut-innervating Ilp7 neurons increased it, and also resulted in higher circulating glucose [14, 195]. Not much is known about the importance of sparse sensory innervation of the intestine. One remarkable exception are the pharyngeal taste neurons. Pox-neuro (poxn) mutant flies lack gustatory function in the legs and labial palps but retain expression of sweet taste receptors in their pharynx and a preference for sweet compounds, highlighting the pharyngeal contribution to sugar detection [196, 197]. Further understanding of the taste circuit relaying this pharyngeal sensory signal is provided by IN1 neurons (subset of interneurons) receiving input from the pharyngeal sensory neurons. The activity of IN1 neurons is exquisitely dependent on the amount and duration of feeding [198]. Posterior to the pharynx, in the gastrointestinal tract, the contribution of sensory innervation to nutritional homeostasis remains to be investigated.\n\nPost-ingestive sensory feedback from the gut has been assumed to inhibit feeding based on work in other insects for example severing the recurrent nerve or the medial abdominal nerve, which transmit information from the gut to the brain, results in overconsumption in blowflies [199]. Work done in flies lends support to this idea; whereas severing the medial abdominal nerve did not disturb food consumption, severing the recurrent nerve elevated consumption of sucrose but not water or bitter tasting solutions [200]. The existence of neuronal stretch receptors on the gut that monitor the volume of ingested food is supported by both neurophysiological and anatomical data in numerous other insects [4, 80, 199, 201]. However, the existence and molecular nature of these receptors in Drosophila remains to be established. Interestingly, six peripheral neurons on the proventriculus have been shown to express the gustatory receptor Gr43a (function as fructose receptor), which is also expressed by some pharyngeal neurons [202, 203, 204]. These proventricular neurons extend dendritic processes into the foregut lumen, and a subset of their axons innervate the midgut, whereas another subset extends along the esophagus, forming a nerve bundle with axons of gustatory receptor neurons projecting toward SEZ. Hence, they may relay nutritional information back to central/more anterior neurons or act locally on the gut. Establishing their roles will require genetic tools able to target the enteric subset without affecting the central or peripheral Gr43a-expressing neurons.\n\n4.2 Drosophila hormones and neuropeptides\n\nApart from using neurons, fly intestine can also communicate with other organs through systemic signals. Intestinal physiology is modulated by both extrinsic hormonal signals (emanating from endocrine glands, neuroendocrine structures, or organs such as the fat body) and by its own peptide hormones, produced by EE cells. In turn, gut-derived signals such as EE cell-derived peptide hormones can have long-range effects on other internal organs. EE cells accounts for 5–10% of midgut epithelial cells in flies compared to 0.4–0.6% in the mammalian small intestine [217, 218, 219]. Majority of them express peptide hormones, often more than one and with regional stereotypy [219, 220, 221, 222]. The developmental program of EE cells shares similarities with that of neurons, probably reflecting a common phylogenetic origin [223, 224, 225]. Consistent with this idea, all known EE peptide hormones (exception insect CCHamides) [226] are also produced by the brain. Acting through these hormones, EE cells may play “neural-like” roles in regulating intestinal physiology and conveying intestinal as well as nutritional state to other cell types or organs. These roles are particularly prominent in the midgut given the relatively sparse innervation of midgut region. Scute mutant flies lacks all EE cells and show normal food intake and fertility, but are short-lived and display abnormal intestinal homeostasis [49].\n\nA role for EE cells on muscle peristalsis has been suggested by the finding that ablation of Diuretic hormone 31 (Dh31)-expressing EE cells or Dh31 downregulation both reduce muscle peristalsis in the larval anterior midgut, which may function as a valve to minimize mixing of acidified and non-acidified food in the acidic region of the midgut [227]. Adult EE cells produce Bursicon. Signaling through the Bursicon/DLGR2 receptor in visceral muscle, represses the production of the visceral muscle-derived mitogen Vein and, consequently, ISC proliferation. Another study found in scute mutants, depletion on EE cells compromised the nutrient-dependent midgut growth that occurs post-eclosion [49] partly by the lack of EE cell-derived Tk, which normally promotes expression of the visceral muscle-derived Ilp3 insulin-like peptide shown to sustain ISC proliferation and nutrient-dependent midgut growth [49, 228]. A recent comparative fly–mouse–human study has pointed to neurotensin-like signaling from EE cells to ECs in flies, with effects on lipid metabolism and AMPK activation. Indeed, expression of mouse neurotensin from Drosophila EE cells (and possibly also peripheral sensory neurons) promoted lipid accumulation in both standard and high-fat diets in the midgut, fat body, and oenocytes, and also decreased gut AMPK activation [229]. The effect was dependent on expression of the Pyrokinin 1 receptor in ECs, but did not seem to be mediated by EE cell-derived Pyrokinin 1, pointing to an involvement of a different ligand [229].\n\nA high-sugar diet leads to increased midgut EE cell number and enhanced production of EE-derived Activin ligand (Activin-β not Daw) [230] suggesting systemic roles for EE-derived peptide hormones. Mirroring the activin-mediated fat-to-gut signaling involved in sucrose repression, midgut-derived Activin-β binds to the TGF-β receptor Baboon in fat cells which, in turn, leads to enhancement of Akh signaling it the fat body and consequent hyperglycemia [230]. CCHamides are insect hormones [231, 232] and their expression is promoted by nutrient availability and sites of expression include the gut EE cells, a subset of central neurons and, possibly, the fat body [226, 233, 234]. Their receptors are expressed in the nervous system including the insulin-producing neurons, and are absent from the gut [226, 234]. Although not strictly gut-derived, a new peptide hormone produced not by EE cells, but by an adjacent secretory gland may have provided the most compelling example to date of gut-to-brain communication. Indeed, Limostatin (Lst) peptide is produced by the corpus cardiacum: the Akh-producing gland which, in the adult, is found adjacent to the hypocerebral ganglion on the gastrointestinal tract, at the junction between the esophagus and anterior midgut. Lst is released in response to nutrient restriction and suppresses insulin production by the insulin-producing cells of the brain PI. Lst mutant flies accumulate excess fat and display phenotypes associated with insulin excess [235].\n\nIn animals with a vascular system, peptides secreted from EE cells can enter the bloodstream and reach tissues at a considerable distance, ranging from other cells in the digestive tract to brain centers regulating appetite [236]. Nutrient availability can also affect the number of EE cells; signaling through the nuclear hormone receptor Hr96, dietary lipids control EE differentiation during the first few days of adult life, providing another way to couple nutrient availability with tissue architecture and physiology [237]. Modulation of intestinal physiology by systemic signals has also been looked into [220, 221]. Control of epithelial turnover by insulin-like peptides or JH (juvenile hormone), and the coupling of dietary availability of sugars with EC digestive enzyme production via the fat body-derived Activin ligand Daw are some examples. The actions of the diuretic peptide Leucokinin (Lk), secreted into the circulation from CNS-derived nerves that terminate at the abdominal wall [14, 238, 239] is an another example. Downregulation of either this peptide or its receptor leads to abnormal excreta and extreme fluid retention that can rupture the abdominal wall [14]. Finally, a link between energy balance, intestinal permeability, and immunity has been suggested by the finding that sNPF is a target of the Crtc/CREB energy sensing pathway, and functions to maintain epithelial barrier integrity acting through its receptor in ECs [240]. Although the precise source of sNPF remains to be established, tissue-specific genetic and expression data points to roles in neurosecretory cells [240], consistent with roles as a neuroendocrine hormone or in gut-innervating neurons. Gut can also produce long-range signals to affect the physiology of other organs, for example by production of the signaling protein Hh by larval EC. Circulating Hh regulates developmental timing by controlling ecdysteroid production in the prothoracic gland, and is required for mobilization of fat body TAG stores during starvation [241].\n\nOther functions of brain-gut peptides and hormones include detection and utilization of nutrients during hunger, stress or normal conditions. Diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44), a homolog of the mammalian corticotropin –releasing -hormone (CRH) activate by nutritive sugars. Disturbed activity of Dh44 neurons leads to fail to select nutritive sugars [131]. These neurons localized to PI in adult brain, counterpart of mammalian hypothalamus [242] are filled with neurosecretory cells [131]. Dh44 conveys information from Dh44 neurons to Dh44 receptor R1 neurons in the brain and R2 cells in the gut suggesting requirement for nutrient selection. Artificial activation of these neurons causes rapid PER and it has been suggested that Dh44 is necessary and sufficient for gut motility and excretion in flies [131]. Both Dh44 neurons and the gut-innervating insulin-producing neurons of the PI are innervated by Hugin-producing neurons that suppress food intake and induce locomotion, providing a possible link between food-related behaviors and intestinal physiology [243]. It is seen later that Dh44+ neurons rapidly activate during amino acid feeding and are a direct sensor of dietary amino acids [244].\n\nFly gut peptide Dromyosuppressin [181] expresses in the number of cells in central nervous system (CNS) in adult stage, extending into the rectum, near the anus; part of the adult gut. Their immunoreactive fibers also project into the crop and show expression of Dromyosuppressin [172] and crop abundantly expresses Dromyosuppressin receptors (Dromyosuppressin receptor I) [220]. The effects of neuropeptide on neural regulation of crop motility and contractions have been shown [245]. Serotonergic neurons have also been shown to regulate insulin producing cells (IPC) located in the PI of the adult brain of the fly [246]. DILP2, 3 and 5 express particularly in midgut [187, 220, 247] and extend their axons to proventriculus, crop and corpora cardiaca [248]. DILP2 is particularly involved in carbohydrate metabolism [249]. Decreased levels of DILP2 affects stored trehalose as well [248]. IPC knockdown flies show increased glycogen storage, high levels of circulating triglycerides and extended lifespan [248].\n\nMammalian neuropeptide NPY (Neuropeptide – Y- precursor) has an invertebrate homologous peptide called NPF due to characteristic C- terminal F residue [250]. NPF has been shown to co- localize within midgut cells in Drosophila and in brain and it plays a role of co- transmitter in many neural circuits [251, 252]. Its receptors are expressed primarily in the malpighian tubules but also hindgut and midgut [253]. There are some regulatory peptides found in both gut and brain. Small neuropeptide-F (sNPF) is found in the neurons in the hypocerebral ganglion innervating the midgut as well. sNPF gene encodes four kinds of sNPFs and is predominantly found in the central nervous system suggesting it might be directly involved in several neural circuits that affect hunger and feeding mechanisms [254]. The receptor for sNPF is further identified and found to be expressed in the crop, Malpighian tubules, hindgut, and the midgut [253]. Over expression or knockdown of sNPF leads to an increase or decrease in adult feeding respectively [255]. sNPF also directly affects and alters DILPs levels in larval and adult IPCs [254]. RFAmides are a class of different neuropeptides, all containing a common C-terminal RFamide sequence [256]. Using antisera to recognize the gene products of the five genes in Drosophila genome encoding for RFAmides, endocrine cells in anterior, middle and posterior midgut are labeled [220], axons in the midgut and crop as well as hypocerebral ganglion. RFAmides also play a key role in food intake, sensing and feeding mechanisms pointing toward conservation in these pathways from insects to mammals [257].\n\nOther neuropeptides include Allatostatin characterized into three kinds namely Allatostatin A/B/C [258, 259, 260]. The endocrine cells producing Allatostatin are found in the posterior midgut and is innervated by axons from thoracico-abdominal ganglion [220]. Its receptors, DAR1 and DAR2 are predominantly located in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract (including crop, midgut and hindgut) respectively [261, 262]. Allatostain is also present throughout midgut. Another major peptide is PDF. It is expressed in central nervous system [263] and its neurons are also found in thoracico-abdominal ganglion [184]. Axons from these neurons innervate midgut and hindgut and in the crop. These neuropeptides are closely associated to circadian rhythm [264] and locomotor activity as well.\n\n5.2 Neurodegenerative diseases\n\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD): AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques consisting of misfolded β-amyloid (Aβ) fibrils and oligomers [278]. Presence of hyper phosphorylated tau protein in the various regions of the brain including cerebral cortex, locus coeruleus, and hippocampus [279] has also been suggested. Microbial dysbiosis [280], dietary changes [281], probiotics [282], or a variety of other disease conditions [283, 284] results in involvement of the GBA in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple studies have shown an association between gut microbiome dysbiosis and the aggregation of Aβ peptides in intestinal epithelial cells [285, 286] and the CNS [287, 288] after high-fat diet feeding. Many neurodegenerative diseases exhibit accumulation of fibrillary, misfolded proteins similar to the propagation of prionopathies in the CNS [289]. Prionopathy also involves the GBA and the local immune system, where prions accumulate in dendritic cells in the Peyer’s patches and other lymphoid follicles once entering the intestinal epithelium layer [290]. Senescence-accelerated mouse model studies have identified systemic senile amyloid proteins in Peyer’s patches [291]. By interacting with dendritic cells, the misfolded protein may transport to the ENS, and ultimately spread to the CNS compartment [290]. Gut bacteria can affect peripheral nerve functions through the production of neuromodulatory metabolites such as short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) [292]. It has been suggested that Lactobacillus probiotics, given orally through feeding, showed improvement in the rough-eye phenotype, famous of the AD flies [293] and reduces Wolbachia’s presence in the gut, which is known to be associated to neurodegenerative disorders. These studies emphasize on the relation between gut microbiota, GBA and the disorder. Pharmaceutical companies are hence targeting these probiotics and prebiotics in order to treat the disorder.\n\nParkinson’s disease (PD): PD is a progressive brain disorder like other neurodegenerative diseases affects thinking, mobility, walking, balance and coordination. Research on PD using Drosophila has revealed links between gut microbiota composition and PD to one of the major genes parkin, which in an autosomal recessive fashion causes this disease [294, 295]. Both Parkin and PINK1 genes disturb mitochondrial function and integration in PD patients. Parkin mutants shows steep rise in gut microbiota in comparison to control flies. Also PINK1 mutants did not show much of a difference suggesting that gut microbiome gets affected independently in both autosomal recessive genes [294]. It is also found that parkin gene in ECs is required to maintain the microbial load. It has been seen that the microbial composition in parkin mutants is drastically different from those of wild-type flies.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD): ASD is a developmental brain disorder characterized by impaired social behavior and disrupted communication and language. Loss of function mutants of histone demethylase KDM5 in Drosophila show how change in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota leads to impairment of social behavior, characteristic of ASD. Decreased levels of KDM5 cause intestinal epithelium disruption. As opposed to the control flies, the presences of gases produced by the overgrowth of bacteria cause bubble formation in the midgut in mutants [296]. It is found that KDM5 mutant flies has different composition of gut flora than controls [296]. The administered of Lactobacillus plantarum to KDM5 mutant flies rescued social behavior and other intestinal defects. Flies supplemented with L. plantarum also shows 2.3 fold increase approximately in longevity [296]. kdm5JmjC*, another kind of KDM5 mutant displayed impaired gut permeability, intestinal epithelium and microbiota. In this case as well, administration of L. plantarum rescued gut permeability, the defective social interaction and communication. These studies have helped establishing a link between gut microbiota and ASD. The probiotics that rescued ASD flies are good candidates for pharmaceutical companies to be sold as therapeutic. These results can be used for drug discovery and in treatment of these otherwise, untreatable disorders."
