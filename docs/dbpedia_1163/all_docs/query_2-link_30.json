        "text": "The Federal Wage System (FWS) is a uniform pay-setting system that covers Federal appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund blue-collar employees who are paid by the hour. The system's goal is to make sure that Federal trade, craft, and laboring employees within a local wage area who perform the same duties receive the same rate of pay. The FWS includes 130 appropriated fund and 118 nonappropriated fund local wage areas. Successful labor-management partnership is the hallmark of the FWS, with labor organizations involved in all phases of administering the pay system.\n\nUnder this uniform pay system -\n\nYour pay will be the same as the pay of other Federal jobs like yours in your wage area, and\n\nYour pay will be in line with pay for private sector jobs like yours in your wage area.\n\nPay Limitation\n\nOn December 21, 2023, OPM issued Compensation Policy Memorandum 2023-22 (external link) to notify agencies that section 737 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, as extended by the Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024, continues the provisions affecting the determination of pay adjustments for certain prevailing rate (wage) employees in Fiscal Year 2024.\n\nOperating Manuals"
