Click on you wt article oad Click on border to view new company or issue D riving through Chicago recently, I passed a Home Depot megastore. Nailed to the building was a sheet of plywood, spray painted with the following words: \"Now hiring locksmiths.\" No lie. I called this store and a spokesman there told me the following. They have already hired some locksmiths and are seeking more. I asked how many more would be hired, and his response was, \"We'll have plenty.\" Offered in-storeonly, at this point, are a fairly wide range of locksmith services. According to the spokesman, his is only the second Home Depot in the country participating in what he termed a \"rollout\" of locksmith service center in Home Depot. I assume if successful in Chicago it will spread. Although services are only being offered in the store at this point, you never know when they might try the next step of putting trucks on the street. i ou may have noticed the upgraded look and feel of our covers this month. With this issue, we have switched printers, and are now being printed by R.R. Donnelley who is able to U V coat our covers. I hope you like the new look. The production team and I recently had a lunch meeting at the Donnelley plant. Present was their entire executive staff. M y guys and I were way outnumbered. (Plus some of the Donnelley people even had ties!) As I was slicing a few crumbs off a fudge brownie, the plate slipped at the same moment my knife descended into the thick, gooey frosting. Needless to say, the plate flew up into the air, brownies raining down in all directions, naturally most of them landing frosting side down on Donnelley's brand new carpet. Amid gales of laughter, I was trying my best to pick the damned things up as quickly as possible when I noticed that my left boot was grinding one into the carpet. Let's just say that cleaning the chocolate frosting off my boot with a white linen napkin was not a pretty sight. M y apologies to Faye, the cleaning lady at Donnelley!

April 1996 • 5 Click on border to view new company or issue Mango's Message nj Greg Mango Managing Editor The Wonder Pick WOW! What a great pick! Imagine, a pick that can not only pick standard pin tumbler locks, but a particular brand of high security locks as well. Over a year ago, Custom Security Products Inc., began heavy promotion for its new \"Patent Pending\" state of the art \"Tri-Axial\" electronic pick, (Suggested retail price of $250.00 ea., unless you want the high security pick attachments, then it's $499.95 ea.) This pick incorporates features never before available in an electronic pick. After first hearing about, and receiving a faxed flier on the Tri-Axial pick, I contacted Donald Hughes, of Custom Security Products Inc., to inquire about this device. He naturally went into a lengthy description as to the effectiveness and special features incorporated into the Tri-Axial pick. According to H ughes, the unit utilizes a double action picking motion which not only lifts the pins, but also causes a twisting motion on the pins as well. This is accomplished by emulating the horizontal slicing action of a dual blade electric knife (You know, the type your parents use to carve the Thanksgiving turkey) in conjunction with the vertical action of a typical rake pick. The Tri-Axial pick is basically a marriage of the two designs. The dual blade slicing motion is said to pick a certain high security lock by twisting the bottom pins into position to catch the side-bar, then lifting the pin to the secondary shear line. I must admit, this is quite a novel and intriguing idea. The theory sounded logical, so I asked Hughes to send me a sample of his product for review. There was one minor encumbrance preventing him from doing that however; he didn't have any. At the time of our conversation, Hughes said that all he currently had in his possession was a prototype model of the Tri-Axial. The actual device was not yet in production. Hughes said he was waiting for an order of precision machined gears supplied by Boston Gear Company, as well as Swiss made micro-motors, to arrive so he could begin production. Our conversation ended with Hughes assuring me that he would supply me with a sample product to evaluate as soon as he had it in stock. According to Hughes, the projected shipping date was approximately 90-days from the time of our conversation. Meanwhile, Custom Security Products Inc., was aggressively marketing the Tri-Axial pick while accepting full as well as partial payments on a product that was not currently in stock. There also seemed to be some confusion on exactly what to call this new product. In earlier promotional flyers, it was called the Tri-Axial. In later brochures it was referred to as the \"Tri-Axes.\" By now, Custom Security Products Inc., has settled on a confirmed name; Tri- Axes. I called the Custom Security Products 800-number roughly 30-days after our initial conversation. When I did, this is what I heard: \"We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and try your call again. \" Things weren't looking good. A phone number for Custom Security Products was soon reinstated, but it was no longer toll free. Now every time someone called to inquire about the delivery - or status - of their pre-paid product, it was going to cost them. Meanwhile, Custom Security Products Inc., developed and began marketing yet another new pick design, the \"Roller Blade Pick.\" This is basically a mechanical version of the Tri - Axes concept in a more traditional pick form. I received a set of the Roller Blade Picks from Ron Ashley, owner of Ashley's Locksmith, Ron had also ordered the Tri-Axes pick which still had not arrived - after waiting for almost a year. Continued on page 8 6 • The National Locksmith Click on border to view new company or issue 1 n 11 nfTi | ^ -^ I Continued from page 6 The Roller Blade Pick is available in four different versions: Single and double picking blades, and single and double picking blades with deluxe handles. Prices range from $49.00 to $69.00 ea. (See photograph 1) The theory is: by rolling the knurled thumb wheel forward, backwards or back and forth, the pick blade(s), will move in and out, lifting - and twisting - the pins automatically. For the life of me, I was unable to pick a lock with this device. Now, I'll admit, I'm getting a little old, my hands are arthritic, my eye sight is poor, I'm loosing my hair, my skills are a little rusty and I have a touch of mental illness, HOWEVER, after inserting the pick into the keyway and rolling the thumb wheel, the handle would move back and forth more than the pick blade(s). I would have needed a bionic thumb to get any real action going. 1. The \"Roller Blade Pick\" I believe I could have accomplished better results with a simple rake pick and a little in and out motion. But then again, what would a hunchbacked, physically challenged, one eyed, feebleminded individual like myself know? A few days after receiving the \"Roller Blade Picks,\" I received another call from Ron Ashley. \"Hay Greg, I just received something you'll be interested in.\" \"What's that Ron?\" \"Believe it or not, I received aTri-Axes,\" Ron replied. \"I don't believe it. Does it include the high security attachments?\" I inquired. \"No.\" he said. \"Does it work?\" \"Well, it will pick something. You've just got to see it for yourself\" Ron snickered. Not one to pass up an opportunity to indulge into the unknown in the hopes of uncovering a hidden treasure - just once I'd like it to happen - I told Ron to send it on over. (See photograph 2) 2. The $499.00 \"Tri-Axes\" electronic pick. At first glance, the pick is much smaller than expected. That's because in the advertisement, it's oversized just a tad. There are three main components to the unit: The Tri-Axes pick; a battery pack which requires one 9-volt battery, and a connecting wire with miniature RCA jack connectors. Once again, I failed to pick anything with a tool that did have some real bionic action going. Had I attempted any longer, I would have eventually sawed my way through the lock! Both of these products remind me of a pitcher that can't quite make it to the major leagues. They have great form, but the follow through is lacking. Well, I know one thing for sure, either these tools didn't live up to their claims, or it's a good thing I'm sitting behind a desk and not a work bench anymore! P.S. To make matters worse, a couple weeks after receiving the Tri-Axes pick, Ron did receive the ten high security pick attachments he originally ordered and paid for - along with an additional $205.00 credit card voucher. Custom Security Products Inc., double charged Ron for the high security picks with no authorization to add additional expenses to his credit card. I'm sure this was just an accidental oversight on CSP's part! Besides that, The National Locksmith has received 30-40 complaints on Custom Security Products, Inc., via E- M ail, U.S. mail and M o Bell over the last few months EH 8 • The National Locksmith Click on border to view new company or issue Letters APRIL 19 9 6 The National Locksmith \\s interested in your view. We do reserve the right to edit for clarity and length. Straighten the Facts In response to Richard Solomon's, \"Certified Locksmith,\" February 1996 letter, in which the last sentence reads \"certified locksmith tale,\" I would like to say that 's exactly what it is, \"a tale.\" I am the person he spoke so negatively about in his letter. The story at the beginning actually happened; he did call me a few choice names as he describes in his letter ( I assume because I used to operate a tow service.) When he was finished telling me that I wasn't a locksmith, he walked away without even letting me defend myself from what he said. The rest of his story however, never happened. I was not invited out to open his vehicle, and if I had been, I would have had it opened QUICKLY, no matter how he supposedly had his door purposely rigged. It's true he did ridicule me verbally, but it's not true about him tricking me into making a fool of myself. I am a specialist in unlocking vehicles and although not perfect, I believe that I am one of the best in Tte National Lectern* VT 3 3 Bu ^undy Parity Attn: Editor 10 • The National Locksmith this area at what I do. I had opened a towing business and for years unlocking cars was my specialty. I decided to do that full-time as well as replace lost keys for automotive's, so I enrolled in classes and was trained in basic and advanced locksmithing - all aspects of it. I became certified, bonded, licensed and insured. I am an active member of ALOA in good standing and very proud to be a locksmith. I am writing this letter after visiting by phone with the managing editor of this publication to which I am a subscriber, and I am enclosing copies of my credentials for his verification. Thank you. Paul Brown Missouri Editors Note: I did speak with Paul and he did send me certificates from locksmith classes he had taken along with his ALOA membership, bond certificate and business license. Paul was very upset about the false representation of the events as reported, and wanted to verify to me that he was indeed a tow operator at one time but now practices locksmithing full time. There is, unfortunately, a very strong disdain in many locksmiths towards tow truck drivers and operators. We should all be very careful when we spew derogatory statements like Rubbish men and scabs towards any person or profession. As in this case, Rubbish man and scab was directed towards someone who was indeed a locksmith with the credentials to prove it. These references should have been edited out of the letter and I take full responsibility for that oversight. I believe everyone has a right to their opinion, and Letters is a forum to express your views, controversial or not.

The loss of my dad was devastating, but I must keep trudging on guided by the force, that something called HOPE. Hope; that force that keeps a soldier in Bosnia standing guard duty on a cold winter's night. Hope; that force that keeps a trucker guiding his 18- wheeler on some desolate highway 2000 miles from home. Hope; that something which arouses a locksmith at 3 a.m. to help some poor soul locked out of his house or car. As we ring in the New Year, we at BP Lock & Alarm in New Jersey, want to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and Hope. On a personal note, I want to wish Marc and his family a very Prosperous New Year, and may all on the staff of THE NATIONAL Click on border to view new company or issue LOCKSMITH - the best security magazine on this planet - have good health. The very best to Tom Seroogy and to Greg Mango. Bill Paroby New Jersey Licensing Knocks One Down I have been a locksmith for over 18 years. When I was about to retire as a Police Officer some twenty-one years ago, I knew I would need supplemental income and something to do after I retired. I took some locksmith schooling and began purchasing equipment while working on the side to properly learn the trade. In 1991, I did retire from the Police Department and began locksmi thing full time. Nearly all my work is out of my fully equipped van, so I guess you would call me a \"mobile locksmith \". I enjoy locksmithing and I enjoy the challenge. Over the years, I've invested the largest portion of my profits back into the business, in the way of equipment and stock. Now, the State of Illinois has enacted a law regulating and licensing locksmiths. I would have no problem with this, except for the fact that this law, from what I understand, does not include tow truck operators or anyone who does not advertise as a locksmith from doing locksmith work (not just opening vehicles, but lock repairs, rekeying etc.) without a license! Further, the license fee, as I understand, is to be $500.00 the first year, and $400.00+ each year thereafter! Folks, this seems to be just something else to run the small business (one man operation) OUT OF BUSINESS! I am at a loss to understand why all the locksmith publications are applauding this law. The thousands of small operators are what keeps YOU in business. I'm aware that some locksmith associations in the northern part of the state had been lobbying for this law. It's obvious that they lean toward the larger businesses, and that is precisely the reason I have never joined an association. Obviously, this law will discourage individuals from learning the trade and starting their own business. I'm now sorry to say that I'm placing my 12 • The National Locksmith mobile lock business up for sale. I will not expend that much of my profits for this license, and I feel that the very purpose of this law is to put me and other small locksmith businesses, out of business. It worked! Larry Tincher Illinois Editors Note: Larry I'm sorry you have succumb to the pressures of recent licensing requirements and have decided to call it quits. Quitting is not the answer. The answer would have been to get involved in the association and make your voice heard - even if its after the fact. I believe there are many within the industry who share your sediments. On the other hand, had you (and others who share your views) joined the association where you could have expressed your views, maybe the outcome would have been different. Unfortunately, most refuse to get involved, allowing a few (who are willing to get involved) to set the standards and rules for all. Greg Mango Glad He's Not A Doctor I do not normally read the \"Letters\" section too thoroughly, hut I cannot let the unabashed pomposity of Jack (\"No Degree for Me,\" January 1996) go unanswered. Would you send your family to a doctor who last attended a medical seminar in 1981? Curtis L Robison Kansas A Heart Felt Thanks Just a note on the very helpful people at Akron Hardware Consultants. I had a customer call me the other day having a problem with a Russwin panic bar with an interchangeable core. After talking with Tim at AHC, he not only took lots of time with me to help me get the right parts I needed, he sent me some books to help me with my installation of the new parts. With the parts I ordered not being a large order and I not being a regular customer (which I will be now) the time and help was very much appreciated. My hat is off to Tim and all the crew at AHC, thanks. Michael S. Adams Florida Sour Grapes I want to respond to \"Jack,\" who wrote via E-Mail the letter entitled, \"No degree for me.\" You sound like you've eaten a lot of sour grapes Jack. You remind me of something I read in a book about success and goal setting that went something like this: A person who barely makes 20,000 a year is always an expert about why he can't make 50,000 a year. To put it bluntly and painfully, a loser is quick to rationalize his position. Let me tell you a story. Everyone knows that you must pass the BAR exam to practice law and the CPA exam to be a Certified Public Accountant. You also need to pass NASD exams to sell mutual funds and stocks. The BAR associations and NASD are not government entities; they are professional associations that have established rules and qualifications for their members. It so happens that government has decided that these rules and qualifications are the standard by which to regulate those professions, and now everyone who wishes to practice law or sell stocks is required by law to pass those tests. ALOA is a professional association. With the current and welcome trend towards licensing all across the country, it doesn't take a lot of brains to see that it could soon become a requirement to be a CRL to get a license. In my state for example, you must have 5 years of time on the job before you can get a plumbing or electricians license. If these things ever come to pass Jack, you'll be thanking God you only had to pass a test. I don't think the PRP is perfect. I'm not happy with the brand sensitive questions that keep popping up. In spite of that complaint, I still think that the PRP is a good thing. I may never install a vault, but having to learn enough about the subject to pass the elective, can only serve to make me more competent in my profession. It is also a barometer of what I know and of what I think I know. Anyone who thinks he has no need to learn anymore is simply foolish. As for the letters after my name, hey, I earned them and I am as proud of them as I was proud to earn the title Marine after Boot Camp. Tony Wiersielis, CRL New Jersey EH Click on border to view new company or issue SCHWAB CORP r$ STRATTEC A 5 P The JlttkHl O A BIG 1 BROWN ' by Carl Cloud I At first, I wasn't sure what brand safe it was. The handle was spinning freely on the shaft and both relockers were fired. Things were not looking too good. 1. The \"Brown Safe\". It stands 74\" high, 30\" wide and 31\" deep. The door is a solid one and one-half inches thick. 2. A magnetic drill rig poised to drill for the top relocker.

I had received a notice that Brown Safe Company was having a sale of miscellaneous tools and equipment on Friday. I didn't think there would be any-thing of interest for me, but the thought of going to look was still lingering in the back of my mind. Friday morning came and I was still debating the short trip up to San M arcos to the sale, when the phone rang. \"We can't open our safe and our store is due to open within an hour, can you help us?\" The only description of the safe the caller could give me was, \"It is a big brown safe and the handle goes around and around.\" The caller was correct. It was a big brown safe and by the time I arrived the tri-spoked handle had slipped off its shaft, (see photograph 1) It wasn't until later that I realized this was truly a \"Brown\" safe. The safe was seventy- four inches tall by thirty wide by thirty-one inches deep. The door was a left-hand swing. There was no name listed anywhere other than the S&G in the center of the dial. I didn't recognize the safe and had no idea of the manufacturer. The combination lock would run and the dial stopped at the customary ninety-five. This told me the relock trigger (within the lock case) had not fired. Plus, there was the feel of the lock bolt retracting. The combination lock appeared to be operating properly. I clamped a large pair of vice gripes onto the protruding handle shaft. The shaft rotated and the sound of the carriage bar retracting the locking bolts could be heard and felt, but the door wouldn't open! Repeated rotation of the handle shaft to throw and retract the locking bolt were to no avail. Something was not releasing the door. With the locking bolts retracted, there was a slight amount of outward movement of the door. I slid a business card into the door crack on the opening side. The card would catch and stick in some locations. It was hard to determine if it was hitting a locking bolt or not. Guessing that the carriage bar wasn't fully retracting, I computed a location to side drill the safe and push the bar back to its full retracted position. With my business card still in the crack of the door, I turned the handle shaft and moved the locking bolts out to their full thrown position. Sliding the business card up and down near the center of the door, I located the center bolt. When I first slid my business card into the door crack, it butted against the door stop. Measuring this distance told me the door thickness was one and one half inches. I added a half inch for the thickness of the door stop and figured another half inch should be close to the center of the half inch locking bolt. (A perfect measurement would have been 2-5/ 8 inches from the door face) I drilled a hole through the side of the safe at my measurements. A pin light directed into the hole showed a bright chrome locking bolt! By watching the bolt and turning the handle shaft, I could see the bolt move back and forth. A hard rap on a punch against the locking bolt was solid, it didn't move. The bolt was retracted as far as it would go and the door still wouldn't open! The white masking tape seen in photograph 1, show the found locations of the locking bolts. The world's largest producer of automotive locks and keys.

My business card would now slide freely up and down the crack. I found a spot near the top of the door where the business card was hitting something. A pencil mark indicated where the card stopped while sliding the card upward. Coming down from the top gave me a second stop location. The space between the two marks was about 3/8 inches. A quick check at the lower portion of the door gave the same 3/8 inch space. Both spaces were 12-3/8 inches from the top and bottom of the door. Two 3/8 inch diameter pins (relockers) had to be preventing the door from opening! Photograph 2, shows my magnetic drill rig mounted to drill for the top relocker. It was positioned to drill a hole at twelve and three-eight inches down from the top of the door and 2- 5/8 inches back from the door face. The hole gave a great view of the end of the relocker. A second hole at the same measurements from the bottom edge of the door revealed the second relocker. Probing both spring loaded relockers back and nudging the door caused it clear the door frame. Photograph 3, shows the bolt works of the door. Note the smaller relocker pin just above the top locking bolt and the one below the bottom bolt. A thin metal cover encases the two vertical flat bars for their full length. It attached to the door by metal screws, but only on the inside edge. In photograph 4, the outer edge of the cover has slipped away and has released the relocker pin. I don't see how normal use could have caused the cover to move. I suspect, when the door was standing full open, someone had been grasping the cover to pull the door closed. The slamming of the door jarred the loosened cover sufficient to release the relockers. Another spring loaded relocker is positioned along the side of the lock case and fires downward into a notch in the center locking bolt. It is concealed from view by the retaining plate mounted to the back of the lock case seen in photograph 3. I called Fred Brown of Brown Safe Company in San Marcos, California. He said this was an early version of a safe model produced for a chain of jewelry stores. Later production models included wires connected between the spring loaded relockers and the back cover of the safe lock. 3. The cover has been removed to show the carriage bar and bolt guides. Note the small relocker pins above and below the top and bottom locking bolts. 4. The loose cover allowed the relockers to fire. 16 • The National Locksmith Click on border to view new company or issue SECURITY CAFE Cam Handle By Holmlund \"The Cam Handle solves the age old problem all locksmiths face when installing cam locks in wood applications, that being how to hold the body from turning while tightening the nut.

INC STRATTEC hes The JlttkHl General Security Test Article #118 Interchangeable Core Locks- Best Style by Sal Dulcamaro y| t the end of AA part 1, I made reference to three different pinning systems used by Best I C locks: A-2, A-3 and A-4. M ost standard commer- cial pin tumbler locks use .115\" di- ameter pin tum- blers, while Best interchangeable core locks use narrower .110\" diameter pin tumblers. The use of a .005\" narrower pin allows Best locks a closer key cut and pin chamber spacing. A typical commercial pin tumbler lock cylinder has a pin to pin spacing of .155\" or .156, whereas a Best cylinder uses a .150\" spacing pattern. The A-2, A-3 and A4 systems all use the same diameter pins, while each has its own separate increment and pin stack. ■ 1. A gauge decoder for A2, A3 andA4, pinning systems. The different increments used in the A-2, A-3 and A-4 systems have an effect on the master keying capabilities of each system. A-2 uses a .0125\" increment with ten depths. A-3 has an increment of .018\" and seven depths. With an increment of .021\", A- 4 has six depths. Photograph 1, shows a key decoder gauge that works with all three systems. The top slot of the gauge is for A-2 systems. The ten depths run from \"0\" 22 • The National Locksmith to \"9,\" and have the following dimensions: =.318, 1 =.3055, 2 = .293, 3 =.2805, 4 =.268, 5 =.2555, 6 = .243, 7 = .2305, 8 = .218 and 9 = .2055. That slot in the gauge will let you very quickly decode a Best style key on the A-2 system. The gauge's middle slot is made for A-3 system keys. Its seven depths range from \"0\" to \"6,\" with the dimensions: =.318, 1 =.300, 2 =.282, 3 = .264, 4 = .246, 5 = .228 and 6 = .210. The \"0\" cut depth is identical in both the A-2 and A-3 systems, and as you will see, is also the same for A-4 system keys. The bottom slot of the key gauge is used for decoding A-4 system keys. Its six depths have the smallest numerical range of the three, but its increment of .021\" is the largest of them all. Going from \"0\" to \"5,\" the depths are as follows: = .318, 1 = .297, 2 = .276, 3 = .255, 4 = .234 and 5 = .213. Control Lug 1. An inside view of the pin stack with an operating key inserted. (part 2) Master Keying Capabilities There was an earlier reference to master keying capabilities of the three different systems. In the A-2 system, there are ten .0125\" increments. By industry standards, this increment is much too small for a single step progression master key system. As a consequence, master keying A-2 would require a two step progression and would effectively turn ten .0125\" increments into five .025 increments. Reserving one depth in each chamber to the master key, this would leave four depths to progress the change keys. The theoretical changes in such system would approach 4,096 in a six pin chamber lock and 16,384 for a seven pin lock. With a slightly larger increment, the A-3 system was intended to go to a single step progression. Setting aside the one depth for the master key, A-3 (in single steps) would have six depths to pro- gress. In a six pin lock, A-3 should approximate 46,656 theoretical changes. The seven pin version would be nearly 279,936. A-3, in theory, could pro- duce huge master key systems. In practice, its in- crement of .018\" was just a bit too small to avoid lock malfunction pro- blems. With the combination of lock and key wear along with manu- facturing toleran- ces, an .018\" master pin could jam a lock.

INC STRATTEC asp: hes The A-4 appears to be the modified alternative to A-3. It is also designed to use a single step progression when master keying. By increasing the increment from .018\" to .021\", one depth was lost. The seven depth A-3 system gave way to the six depths of A-4. Saving one depth for the master key, five depths would be left to progress the key changes. Using A-4, a six pin lock would have nearly 15,625 theoretical changes and 78,125 changes for a seven pin lock. I -Core Shear Lines Illustration 1, shows a drawing of a cutaway view at an individual pin chamber for a Best style inter- changeable core. In part 1, of this article, photographs provided a detailed view of each of the components of an l-Core. Illustration 1, demonstrates more clearly how it is constructed and how it works. A standard lock cylinder would have the shell and plug as the main components. For a key to operate, it would allow bottom pins (or combinations of bottom and master pins) to be raised even with the top Control Lug surface of the plug or shear line. A Best style inter- changeable core will do that too. In an I -Core, howev- er, there is an intervening com- ponent in between the shell and the plug. That com- ponent is the control sleeve, and its existence creates a second shear line in an I- Core that does not exist in a standard lock cylinder. In illustration 1, an operating key raises the top surface of the bottom pin even with the operating shear line. Pro- viding that the pins in all the other pin chambers were at the shear line, the key would cause the plug to rotate and operate the lock.

INC STRATTEC ©\"\" hes The \\NufASrTj5iNE^ I Locksmith I sleeve. The pin identified as \"B\" is the build-up pin. To someone unfamiliar with Best style l-Core locks, that pin might be guessed to be a master pin. There is no apparent use or purpose for the build-up pin in this illustration, but its use becomes quite apparent in the next one. Illustration 2, shows a control key in place of the operating key. The control key in this illustration has raised the top surface of the bottom pin above the operating shear line. It is obvious that the plug cannot rotate within the control sleeve now. If you look carefully, you will see that the control key has done more than just lift the bottom pin past the operating shear line. It has also lifted the build- up pin far enough up so that its top surface is even with the control shear line. The control shear line is the commonly shared surface between the control sleeve and the shell. If the build-up pins in all the other pin chambers have also been raised to the control shear line, the control sleeve will be able to rotate. Unlike the plug which can usually rotate 360 degrees, the control sleeve for a Best style l-Core is designed to rotate only 15 degrees clockwise. The purpose of that limited rotation is to draw the control lug (which is machined into the control sleeve) inward for the purpose of installing or removing the l-Core. Pin Stacks A Best style interchangeable core lock is considerably more complicated than your standard pin tumbler lock cylinder. In a non-master keyed lock, each pin chamber contains a bottom pin, a build-up pin, a top pin and a tumbler spring. That totals three pins in each chamber. If a cylinder is master keyed, a master pin must be added to each tumbler position where the operating key and master key cuts are different from each other. That makes four pins in each of the pin chambers. With so many pins per chamber, its easy to see why there would be strict rules about the height of the pin stack. The haphazard stacking of pins in each chamber would almost guarantee some kind of lock malfunction. Because of the different depth increments, each system (A-2, A-3 and A-4) has its own pin stack requirements. The A-2 system is by far the most common one found in installed Best style cores. In a properly coded Best style core, the combined stack of bottom, master, build-up and top pins should always be the same combined length. If you added together the numerical value of each pin in an individual pin chamber, for the A-2 system, the total should equal 23. Bottom pins are assigned the values \"0\" to \"9.\" M aster pins, build-up pins and top pins are assigned values \"1\" to \"19\". Some of these sizes are only assigned for use as one or another of those three classifications, while others can be used as two or all three types of pins. Pinning Formula To properly code a particular pin chamber, you must know the depth of cut for that pin chamber for each key that works with the core. Those keys include: the control key, operating key (change key), and master key if that chamber is to be master pinned. I will choose just one position cut for each of the keys as an example, but you can use the same formula to figure all pin positions in a Best style core. For the example, the control key depth will be \"5\", top master key (TM K) will be \"7\", and change key will be \"1\". Using our example, the bottom pin should be the value of the shallower cut of the two operating keys. The two operating keys are the master and change key. The shallower cut belongs to the change key, with the value \"1\". The bottom pin, therefore, is \"1\". Next you must determine the difference between the deep operating cut (in this case, the master key cut \"7\") and the shallow operating cut (the change key cut \"1\"). That number would determine the master pin. The difference between seven and one is six, so the master pin to stack on top of the bottom pin would be \"6\". The purpose of the build-up pin is to raise the stack high enough so that the control key causes the top surface of the build-up pin to be at the control shear line. The difference in height between the operating shear line and the control shear line is .125\", or ten increments of .0125\". Those ten increments become an important part of the formula for determining the size of the build-up pin. It works as follows: the control key value - in this case \"5\" - is added to ten equaling \"15.\" Then A-2 Add Enough to Total 23 Control Key Cut Plus 10 Minus Plug Total Plug/ Total \\ Deep Operating Cut Minus Shallow Operating Cut Shallow Operating Cut Top Pin Build-Up Pin Master Pin (If any) Bottom Pin 3. A simplified formula for an A2 pinning system. A-3 Add Enough to Total 16 Control Key Cut Plus 7 Minus Plug Total Plug/ Total \\ Deep Operating Cut Minus Shallow Operating Cut Shallow Operating Cut Top Pin Build-Up Pin Master Pin (If any) Bottom Pin 4. A simplified formula for an A3 pinning system. the plug total of the bottom pin \"1\" and master pin \"6\" which equals \"7\" is subtracted. Taking \"7\" from \"15\" leaves \"8\" as the value of the build-up pin. The plug total is determined by adding the bottom pin and master pin if a chamber is master pinned, but is just the value of the bottom pin if the chamber is not master pinned. 24 • The National Locksmith Click on border to view new company or issue Imedecol HIGH SECURITY LOG NATIONAL AUTO. GCK SERVICE. INC STRATTEC ©\"\" hes The \\NufASTTjKiNc^ I Locksmith I So that the pin stacks in all the chambers have the same height, Best had determined the value of the total stack to be \"23,\" for the A-2 system. The way to determine the top pin is to Plug/ Total \\ A-4 Add Enough to Total 14 Control Key Cut Plus 6 Minus Plug Total Deep Operating Cut Minus Shallow Operating Cut Shallow Operating Cut Top Pin Build-Up Pin Master Pin (If any) Bottom Pin 5. A simplified formula for an A4 pinning system. add together the values of the bottom pin, master pin - if any - and the build- up pin, and subtract that value from \"23\". For our example, we have determined the following: bottom pin \"1\", master pin \"6\" and build-up pin \"8\". That total comes to \"15.\" When subtracted from \"23,\" we can conclude that our top pin will have the value \"8.\" Illustration 3, shows a diagram that simplifies the pinning formula. You can use it to determine the pinning in each pin chamber of a Best style I- Core. Illustration 4 and 5, has the equivalent diagrams and formulas for the A-3 and A-4 systems. They each have a different value increment and pin stack than the A-2 system. Decoding the Control Key Because Best has strict pinning rules for their cores and specific values for the pin stacks, it is possible to use those rules to determine the key bitting for a control key. You must have the core in your hands to begin the process, but a properly coded core can reveal the control key bitting to someone who knows the formula. The information is partly contained in the assigned value of the top pin. You must know if you are dealing with A-2, A-3 or A-4, because they each have different length pins. For an A-2 system core, you subtract the value of the top pin from \"13\", the resulting number is the depth of cut (in that tumbler position) for your control key. We can use the previous example used for determining the pinning to test the formula. The top pin for that pin chamber was \"8.\" Using the formula, \"13\" minus \"8\" leaves \"5.\" If you check, you will see that the control key cut was indeed the number \"5.\" You can determine the cuts, chamber by chamber, until you decode the entire control key bitting. With that information, you can create a control key to pull other cores in the same group of locks. Since A-3 and A-4 have different pin stacks, they each have a different formula for decoding a control key. Nine minus the top pin value will determine the control key cut in an A- 3 system. For A4, eight minus the top pin will identify the control key cut.

I mean when you have a product that is tough, user friendly and consistently does the job that its supposed to do, why mess with it? Nearly two years ago, I wrote an article about Securitron's DK-25P, a new touch pad and CPU board for single door access control. Securitron had developed the DK-25P to replace their DK-20+. I felt fortunate to be selected to field test the DK-25P, and the article I wrote (The National Locksmith, June, 1994, page 28) compared the DK-25P's, installation and performance characteristics to the older DK-20+. In my opinion, the DK-25P won hands down. Not that there was anything functionally wrong with the DK-20+, mind you (True, the membrane-driven touch pad could collapse prematurely if subject to abuse or chronic hard use,) but Securitron was looking to develop a tougher, more dependable product that would give longer service under the severest of conditions. The DK-25P filled the bill nicely. Even though the DK-25P used the same CPU board that the DK20+used, the life expectancy of the unit under actual use conditions improved dramatically, since the touch pad was definitely tougher and more durable. When Mark Henderson, from Securitron, called me and told me about their new DK-26 touch pad that was to soon be released for field-testing, I was impressed by M ark's description of the radical changes and potential for expansion that Securitron had built into the new DK-26. Of course, I wanted to know if 38 • The National Locksmith 2.

INC ASP I was in line to field test one of the new units, I hung up the phone with a smile on my face. About a week later, the B ig B rown Truck rolled into my driveway and delivered a DK-26 and CPU board. Before the UPS truck had backed out of my driveway, I had the package on my desk and was busily cutting it open with my trusty pocket knife. I was just a tad on the anxious side to see how different this unit really was from the DK-25P. The first thing I pulled out of the package was the touch pad itself. The only notable change seemed to be there was now three LED's rather then two. Securitron had added a yellow LED in the middle (See photograph #1, which shows the DK-26 touchpad on the left and the DK-25P on the right) . 1 VI^L^i^^fe.

More options for auxiliary exit switches are offered. When I lifted the cover off of the housing (See photograph #2,) I noticed the CPU board that you see in the photograph is totally different from the older CPU board of the DK-20+ and the DK-20P (See photograph #3.) The reasons for the re-design of the CPU board is due to several function and expansion changes such as: increased touch pad programming options, system expansion capabilities, and of course, easier installation characteristics. Some system expansion possibilities will most likely include the ability to \"plug-in\" additional CPU modules to allow for multi-door operation, or maybe auxiliary card reading capabilities and expanded user code capabilities. It is not unrealistic to expect that future expansion of the DK-26 could allow for as many as two hundred individual user codes, or possibly designated door user codes for applications requiring multiple door control, and, all of it with audit trail potential!

There are slotted mounting holes for easy mounting to any type of surface. There are tabs for holding the CPU in place once the unit's mounted and a large elliptical shaped knock-out hole at the bottom right hand corner of the housing for wiring. When it comes to wiring the touch pad to the DK-26 over its predecessors, Securitron really simplified the process for the installer. If you'll notice in photograph M, the DK-26 CPU board has colors stamped at each terminal. On the older models, the terminals had a numeric designation and you needed to consult your wiring diagram to put the \"black wire on terminal #26, etc.\" As you can see in this photograph, it's simply a matter of putting the green wire to the \"grn\" terminal and the yellow wire to the \"yel\" terminal until you run out of wires to place on the proper terminals! This feature alone will make the DK-26 more popular with ol' boys like myself who believe in doing it the easy way whenever possible. Photograph #5, shows another change in the DK-26's board over previous DK series CPU boards. The various terminals shown here are for wiring different exit devices to the CPU, such as wiring in extra remote or auxiliary exit switches like the PB2-E shown in photograph #6. Photograph #7 shows the \"P\" button for changing the \"Program Code\" and the \"H\" button for changing the hard code, which can be used as a \"M aster Code\" if there is more than one DK-26 system in a building. It can also be used as a \"walk-a-way\" in instances where one user code is all that is required on the door. User codes are set by utilizing the Program Mode and then entering each user code. By the way, the DK-26 will accept up to fifty-nine separate user codes, and the user codes can be added or deleted right from the touch pad! In fact, the program code can also be changed from the touch pad if so desired. The only reason you need the \"P\" and \"H\" buttons is for your initial programming sequences, or if for some reason the E-PROM memory crashed and was lost. It is also used if the person responsible for the program code lost it. ASP Inc.

Notice that you have an \"AC\" terminal and an \"IN\" terminal. Next to the \"IN\" terminal there is an \"F\" (Free) terminal and the DC IN/OUT terminals. Here again, Securitron has made wiring and set-up, just a little easier for the installer O.K.! Up to this point, you have just seen what I saw when I took the DK-26 out of the package and laid it on my desk. What you can't see is what the DK-26 is capable of that the DK-20, DK-20+and the DK-25 wasn't. What Securitron has done with an already great product is, it took the best of the DK-25P, utilized it in the DK-26 and added more practical features to give the DK-26 the ability to grow as new and better technology comes along. For instance: The DK-26 has a true ten button code capability. The buttons are not sequenced in pairs like the previous DK series touch pads were. With the DK-26, you virtually have millions of possible code combinations. Because there is such a variety of code possibilities, plus the DK-26's ability to accept user codes of different lengths, (two to seven digits) the DK-26 is smart enough to recognize \"subsets\" of other codes. A 'subset' is a series of numbers that are contained in a longer series of numbers. Let's say user one entered \"1-3-3-5-8\" as their code. If user three entered \"3-3-5\" as their code, the lock would release if the DK-26 could not recognize the latter series of numbers as a subset of the former. Or if \"3-3-5\" happened to be a subset of the Program Code, the Program Code could not be entered since \"3-3-5\" would release the door before the Program Code could be completed. The DK-26 avoids this problem by rejecting any code that is a subset of another code in memory! It signals this rejection by showing the single red (error) flash on the LED instead of the normal two flash confirmation Continued on page 45 We have it all Quality, Value, & Service, Click here for more information 42 • The National Locksmith Click on border to view new company or issue Imedeool HIG SECURITY LO NATIONAL AUTO LOCK SERVICE.

To enter a new user code, management enters their Program Code, followed by depressing the \"Bell\" key which will cause the yellow LED to flash rapidly, indicating that the DK-26 is in the program mode. Next, enter the user code prefix, followed immediately by a new two to seven digit user code. Then press the \"Bell\" key. Two red LED flashes will confirm the entry and the raped yellow flash will return. Press \"Bell\" key again, which terminates the program mode. Try the new user code. Once entered, the door should unlock. If management wants to delete a user code, they simply enter the Program Code, call up the users I.D. number (i.e., 01, 02, etc.) and then hit the \"Bell\" key. If they don't depress the \"Bell\" key, as long as they don't enter a new code that would \"overwrite\" the current user code, the unit will time out and delete the code anyway. Hit the Bell key again to exit the program mode. The DK-26 can currently handle up to 59 individual user codes.

Notice the various types of keys in photograph 1. 1 receive a lot of calls to make flat steel keys for chests, money boxes, grandfather clocks, jewelry boxes, suitcases, storage boxes, and padlocks just to name a few. Some of the antique chests use a flat steel key, some use a steel bit key, and some use a steel barrel key. A steel barrel key is one which has a hole in the end to accommodate a post located in the lock. 1. Various steel keys for chests and cabinets. Flat steel keys should only be originated or duplicated on a machine with a steel cutting blade. This cutting blade is flat with no taper like a duplicating or code cutting blade. The cuts can also be filed by hand if one is impressioning or duplicating, but this can be a slow process. To originate or duplicate a bit key or barrel key, there are specialty machines for this or it can be filed by hand. Use a ward file and a calipers to measure the location and size of the cuts.

If the marks are on exact opposite sides, then the cuts will have to be exactly opposite. If you have trouble seeing the marks, the blank can be smoked with a candle, allowing for better vision. When hand filing the cuts, the cuts need to be shaped at a 90 degree angle for a professional look. If you have trouble locating a matching blank, the bows can be slightly <-■ \\< 3.

This months interview is with PeteNeisel, President and CEO of Schwab Corporation. How long have you been in the field of safes or security? 25 years. Can you describe a little of the history on how you came into this field? I served two years in the U.S. Army after graduating from Colgatex University in 1961. I spent several years with Xerox Corp., before joining John D. Brush Company's Sentry Group in corporate marketing. I was Vice President of M arketing for John D. Brush from 1970 until I came to Schwab in 1984, also, as Vice President of M arketing. After a few months, I took over the position of President and CEO, and in 1989 Schwab was purchased by management. What has been the most enjoyable aspect of working in this industry? I've always liked working with dealers and other manufacturers throughout the industry. Recently, I've particularly enjoyed monitoring and being part of the growth and changes that are taking place both in products and in the ways we all service our customers. What has been the most challenging aspect of working in this industry? Actually there are two. M eeting the demand for high quality, lower priced products is always a challenge. I'm sure that will never change. The other greatest challenge for Schwab is getting locksmiths — who are used to selling security — more interested and comfortable in selling fire safes, cabinets and files as another form of security. Locksmiths' unique influence with their commercial customers can open doors to many companies in need of record protection. There is tremendous business opportunity out therefor those who do. What changes have you seen take place in your industry? Why? Consumers are demanding more sophisticated, better quality, less expensive products that are delivered on shorter lead times than at any time in recent history. Increased Pete Neisel President and CEO of Schwab Corp. competition is requiring manufacturers to find new ways to meet these demands without driving up the dealers' cost of doing business. What direction do you think this industry is taking? Why? Locksmiths are now being encouraged to become \"security professionals.\" More and more, they will be asked to provide everything from keys, locks, safes, and alarms to consulting services to top management. While national credentials and certifications are useful, the locksmith industry must understand the long term profit opportunities in meeting all the security needs of the communities they serve. How do you think these changes have affected the locksmith? These changes are already pushing those who can't adapt out of business and those who can adapt to look for new ways to service consumers and maintain profitability. In what is already a specialty field, the dealer or locksmith cannot afford to limit business opportunities by specializing in a single aspect of their business. What changes do you see necessary if the locksmith is to be successful in the future? As I mentioned, the \"locksmith\" of today needs to become the \"security professional\" of tomorrow. They need to market themselves and their products with this in mind. What do you feel the future holds for the locksmith and his role in security especially relating to your field? Locksmiths can use their unique position and credibility to learn how everyone from corporate America to homeowners are vulnerable and at risk. With this information they can then offer profitable solutions to these problems including, of course, fire protective products. How do you think the locksmith can best serve his customer? The locksmith can best serve customers by catering to all of their security needs. Ask questions, probe, educate. Determine all of the security problems that customers face and offer quality solutions and products from those manufacturers who are prepared and able to support your (the locksmith's) marketing initiatives.

Carden, president, Alyn Corporation today announced the receipt of a United States patent for its boron carbide metal matrix composite known as Boralyn. The patent covers sporting goods, commercial and industrial applications. Boralyn is a miracle material that is revolutionizing fabricating methods. Developed and supplied by Alyn Corporation of Costa Mesa CA, Boralyn is an advanced metal matrix composite proven to be stiffer and lighter than aluminum, harder than steel, extremely fracture resistant, and much more predictable than carbon fiber or ceramic composites. Alyn Corporation is the major world supplier of boron carbide, a key ingredient in the production of Boralyn, the hardest man-made substance on earth. Robin Carden, Alyn's president and an authority on advanced ceramics and metal composites, left the defense industry in 1989 to found the company for the purpose of developing boron carbide derivatives. Commercial, industrial and consumer products can all be improved with the use of Boralyn. Carden points out that Boralyn is environmentally safe, efficient to make, available in castable ingots and in extrusion forms, and is easily welded with conventional equipment. The raw materials that comprise Boralyn are plentiful and cost efficient. The world market for Boralyn is endless.

GCK. SERVICE. INC STRATTEC fc™ hes The jNrinnal \"The Finish That Lasts A Lifetime' The Challenge: To tarnish, pit, flake, corrode, or discolor. The Challengers: Photograph 1, L to R - Weiser, Schlage, Titan, M aster, and Baldwin. The Claim: That the products could stand up to the worst abuse mother nature could muster without adverse effects being noticeable to the finish. Our Attitude: Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that. A claim like that cannot go unchallenged. Salt, heat, humidity, perspiration, rain, chemicals; all have long been the nemesis of brass or brass finished hardware, especially bright brass or polished brass. Take a look at any bright brass hardware product that is exposed to the elements for any length of time and you will find a tarnished, pitted, discolored product. Some products will almost turn black with discoloration over the years. The challenge for manufacturers has been to produce a bright brass product that would repel such effects, enhancing not only the beauty of the product, but the desirability as well. There are now several manufacturers that say they can turn back the hands of time, eliminating the unsightly hardware of yesteryear that will shine a lifetime. W eat The National Locksmith, opened our torture chamber once again (the in- house testing laboratory) draped on laboratory coats, slipped on playtex gloves, garnished glasses, and proceeded to indulged in some maliciousness. The Finishing Process Each manufacturer in our test uses a slightly different manufacturing process to produce their own unique finish, but the standard is called \"vapor deposition.\" This process is unlike the typical lacquer or plating process that has been used over the years in which the product is dipped into a chemical solution to produce and maintain the finish of bright brass products. The vapor deposition process is accomplished by producing an electronic arc created from a metal electrode inside a vacuum chamber. When this is accomplished, gas - such as oxygen or nitrogen - and a finishing material - usually a zirconium nitride mixture - is released in the chamber. The electrons flowing within the chamber cause the vapor particles to propel against the surface of the hardware condensing as a film and bonding like armor. The result is a tough durable shell - about the thickness of a human hair -that is then polished to a jewel like finish. Various types of vapor deposition methods have been used for 1. The participants in our test are from left to right; Weiser, Schlage, Titan, Master, and Baldwin. over 20-years, this is not a new technology. Chemical vapor deposition was initially introduced and used in the late 60's on metal-working tools. The process was said to increase the life expectancy of a cutting tool for example, two to ten fold. Historically, vapor deposition processes have been relatively expensive to perform as a result of slow deposition rates and expensive vacuum equipment. I n recent years, the use of vapor deposition methods has expanded at an extremely rapid rate due to the reduced operating costs and increased demand for high-performance materials and coatings. The vapor deposition process is also said to be environmentally safe because there are no volatile compounds used and no hazardous or toxic waste produced. Warranty Warnings Each manufacturer's finish is referred to by a different name. For Baldwin its \"Lifetime Finish;\" for Titan there is no particular name reference; for M aster there is no particular name reference;\" for Schlage its \"U Itima\" and for Weiser its \"Brilliance.\" All offer a Lifetime Warranty -with some restrictions -to its finishes. You should however, be aware of the limitations and restrictions in each manufacturer's warranty. For example, some manufacturers provide their particular finish only to the exterior portion of the hardware and not to the interior. As an example: On a double cylinder handleset, the interior deadbolt will not have a lifetime warranty on the finish. Others only offer a lifetime warranty to the finish when the product is used in a residential application, not commercial. Be aware of these restrictions some manufacturers offer and inquire about it when using a particular product. Your customer should also be made aware of any warranty restrictions, especially if they are purchasing a product based exclusively on - and because of - the finish warranty. Also be aware that the lifetime warranty is not available on all manufacturers products, and those that do offer it, do so on selected items only.

On With The Tests Saline Abrasion: Photograph 2 Salt can have a devastating effect on metal, especially porous metal like brass. Salt can literally eat its way through a hunk of metal in time. The first in our battery of tests was a salt immersion. With a really nasty gleam in our eyes, your team of mad scientists, bedecked in lab coats from The National Locksmith, mixed a highly concentrated batch of rock salt and water in a bucket. In a real test, we'd be able to tell you the exact percentage ratio of salt to water. But we're not all that formal around here, so let's just say that these locks were going to get saltier than pickles in brine. We cruelly soaked the locks for a solid week, sneering all the while about how these \"life long finishes\" were about to flake off before our eyes. When we fished the locks out of our corrosive brew, we allowed them to air dry. Then we poured off the water from the saline solution, leaving behind a muddy salt paste. But you know what? We still felt that we could be yet a little more sadistic, so we smeared the salt paste over the surfaces of all the hardware and left them to dry and harden like a crustacean for over a week. After two weeks soaking and crusting with salt, we were ready to clean the locks up and have a good laugh about these so-called \"miracle finishes.\" M uch to our surprise, when we cleaned them up, the darned things looked perfect.

At this point, your official testers from The National Locksmith area little chagrined to admit that when we rinsed the locks off, they were still perfect, still unscathed. So far, the hardware had withstood everything that we had put it through. It was time to get radical! A Burning Inferno: Photographs 4, 5, 6 & 7 The last and final test we subjected these handlesets to was by far the most brutal of all. Hey, we figured fire can goof up just about anything if you're really in a bad mood. So in a scene out of Carrie, we doused all six handlesets with generous streams of or ANUFACTURING, INC Every Instal I ation Is a Sel f -Portrait Of the Person Who D id It.

Cackling madly - and by this time our co-workers were starting to get a little nervous about our mental health -we lit a match and tossed it on the locks, setting them ablaze in a roaring inferno for about 10 minutes. The handlesets crackled due to the intense heat and soon turned black with soot. We jumped for joy around the burning locks, dancing a primal dance of destruction; the only thing missing was the war paint. Well, it was a while before the units cooled down enough so we could rub off the soot to see what lay beneath. We just knew we'd be rubbing off the finishes along with the ashes! Can you guess the outcome? After a little rubbing, darned if the locks weren't just like new. At first we 8.

We eyed the forklift, remembering the door frame that had withstood repeated attacks months back, (The National Locksmith, April 1995) but then reality settled in and we realized that we were just going to have to admit defeat. The final score? M iracle finishes 4, The National Locksmith lab team 0. Now , we'll be the first to admit that this is in no way a concise and all conclusive test, and was not intended to be a long term test as to the life-long condition of these manufacturers products. We did however, make a valiant attempt to destroy the finish in a relatively short period of time under very intense conditions. The Conclusion After hanging up our lab coats, sliding off our gloves and removing our goggles, the conclusion was unanimous, the new finish used on these products is very good. In photograph 8, just the pull handle portion of the handlesetwas cleaned to show the drastic contrast between the finishes after our testing. We were all quite surprised that even after an intense inferno, the finish on all could still be buffed to a shine, very impressive. It appears that the manufacturers have found a solution to an age old problem, and so far it looks like it works. No longer will a beautiful piece or bright brass hardware look antique in just a few years of service. This is something every homeowner will love. And what about your frustrated locksmith scientists? Well, we went home and kicked our dogs. We feel much better now. EH Click on border to view new company or issue ^m hes HIGH SECURITY LOCK-!
