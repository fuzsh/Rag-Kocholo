This analysis has been used in Brazil; however, it needs to be strengthened, given the country's continental dimensions, population size, cultural and socioeconomic diversity, and the foundations of its regional differences3232 Silva TPR, Gomes CS, Carmo AS, Mendes LL, Rezende EM, Velasquez-Melendez G, et al.

( Chart 1).\n\nClusters of vaccinated children were spatially identified and analyzed using the spatial analysis technique called scan statistics, developed by Kulldorff and Nagarwalla3636 Kulldorff M, Nagarwalla N. Spatial disease clusters: detection and inference. Stat Med 1995; 14(8): 799-810. https://doi.org/10.1002/SIM.4780140809\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/SIM.4780140809... . This analysis involves a gradual scan based on analysis windows with varying sizes throughout the territorial extension of the studied scenario. To this end, this research defined a circular analysis window, with its radius having a specific upper limit, established at 50% of the target population of vaccinated children in Minas Gerais. The intrinsic characteristic of this window is its high flexibility in both location and size, producing an infinite number of distinct geographic circles, each of them eligible as a cluster3636 Kulldorff M, Nagarwalla N. Spatial disease clusters: detection and inference.

For the number of vaccinated children in the municipalities of Minas Gerais, we adopted the discrete Poisson model, considered the most suitable for rate modeling or count data. Each window has its null hypothesis (H0) tested against the alternative hypothesis (H1) — high risk for the event investigated (vaccination coverage) — compared to the outside window, that is, the remaining territory analyzed4040 Lucena KDT, Silva ATMC, Moraes RM, Silva CC, Bezerra IMP. Análise espacial da violência doméstica contra a mulher entre os anos de 2002 e 2005 em João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brasil.

Geographic analysis of forest health indicators using spatial scan statistics.

The significance test for the identified clusters was based on the comparison between likelihood ratio test statistics and a null distribution, according to the Monte Carlo simulation. A higher number of replications in the Monte Carlo simulation affects the power of the respective test; thus, 999 replications were established to analyze the vaccination in the state3636 Kulldorff M, Nagarwalla N. Spatial disease clusters: detection and inference. Stat Med 1995; 14(8): 799-810. https://doi.org/10.1002/SIM.4780140809\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/SIM.4780140809... .\n\nWe considered the relative risk (RR) for significant clusters as a way of comparing information from dissimilar areas. RR is a non-negative epidemiological measure that represents how common the event is in the given spatial cluster. Taking into account the number of vaccinated children in Minas Gerais, RR values greater than 1 (RR>1) correspond to an increased probability of being vaccinated at a certain location, while values less than 1 (RR<1) mean the opposite, that is, a lower likelihood of being vaccinated in a region4242 Lawson A. Bayesian disease mapping: hierarchical modeling in spatial epidemiology. 3rd ed. United Kingdom: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 2021.. This calculation is performed with the following mathematic formula:\n\nIn which c is the number of cases inside the cluster, C is the total number of cases in the dataset, E[c] is the number of cases expected inside the window under the null hypothesis. We also calculated 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of RRs of significant spatial clusters4343 Arroyo LH, Yamamura M, Protti-Zanatta ST, Fusco APB, Palha PF, Ramos ACV, et al.

This analysis is a global autocorrelation measure that estimates the influence of one variable on a neighboring one or the correlation between them4545 Anselin L.

The Moran scatterplot as an ESDA tool to assess local instability in spatial association. In: Fischer M, editor. Spatial analytical perspectives on GIS. London: Routledge; 2019. p. 111-26. https://doi.org/10.1201/9780203739051-8\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1201/9780203739051-8... . The variables selected to analyze spatial correlation were those presented in the method: municipal human development index; urbanization rate, and gross domestic product per capita.\n\nBoth the analysis of global spatial autocorrelation (Moran index) and the Bivariate Moran (spatial correlation) were based on a queen contiguity matrix, in which municipalities that share borders are considered neighbors. These analyses were conducted in the Geoda 1.12 software.\n\nChoropleth maps with results from the respective scanning analyses were prepared using the cartographic base of Minas Gerais and its respective municipalities, freely obtained from the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and elaborated in the ArcGIS 10.8 software.\n\nThe study used public domain data with unrestricted access and anonymity for the individuals participating in the investigation; therefore, it did not require appreciation by the Research Ethics Committee.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn Minas Gerais, the vaccination coverage for hepatitis A (89.0%), varicella (89.0%), and MMR (75.7%) was low in 2020. Coverage reached 95.0% or more in only 57.2% (n=488) of the municipalities for hepatitis A, 56.2% (n=479) for varicella, and 35.3% (n=301) for MMR. Figure 2 reveals similarities in the spatial distribution of hepatitis A and varicella vaccination coverage. This pattern was not identified in the distribution of the MMR vaccine, which had a higher number of municipalities with coverage below 95% (n=552).\n\nFigure 2\n\nSpatial distribution of hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccination coverage in Minas Gerais, 2020.\n\nSpatial scan statistics detected statistically significant clusters for hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccination coverage ( Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3\n\nAreas with spatial clusters for hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccination coverage in children under two years of age, Minas Gerais, 2020.\n\nClusters in the North and Northeast regions had the highest territorial extension (greater number of municipalities in the same cluster) and a lower likelihood of vaccinating their population with hepatitis A (cluster 4), MMR (cluster 5), and varicella (cluster 5) vaccines. The Triângulo do Sul region also presented a cluster with lower odds of vaccinating children against varicella (cluster 6). In contrast, the Central, Midwest, South Central (hepatitis A: cluster 5; MMR: cluster 6 and 7; varicella: cluster 7 and 8), and Northwest regions (MMR: cluster 9) showed the opposite behavior, that is, higher likelihood of vaccinating the population.\n\nThe hepatitis A vaccine had six clusters, four of them less likely to vaccinate the population. The MMR and varicella vaccines produced nine clusters. Both showed more clusters with lower odds of having their population vaccinated. Clusters with both higher and lower vaccination likelihood presented a similar pattern; namely, they were in neighboring regions, despite having different sizes, allowing the assumption that some characteristics lead municipalities to have similar coverage.\n\nTable 1 shows results from analyses of the vaccination coverage in 2020 and the socioeconomic variables selected for the study in an attempt to identify factors that may have influenced the change in coverage values for the hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccines in exploratory terms. The municipal human development index variable had a highly statistically significant positive spatial correlation with the coverage of the three vaccines analyzed. This result indicates that municipalities with higher percentages of vaccination coverage tend to be spatially correlated when municipal human development indices are higher in neighboring municipalities.\n\nAlso, the urbanization rate and gross domestic product per capita variables showed a low positive spatial correlation with hepatitis A and varicella vaccination coverage. We underline that, despite having a similar but very low trend in positive spatial correlation with these indices, the MMR vaccination coverage displays an important uniqueness in its spatial distribution. This finding is a strong indication that some external factor is influencing this spatial distribution. Nonetheless, this external factor was not included in this analysis, resulting in a different Bivariate Moran value for the hepatitis A and varicella vaccines.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe spatial analysis of vaccination coverage in pandemic times pointed to a heterogeneous behavior of the hepatitis A, MMR, and varicella vaccines among the macro-regions in this Brazilian state, a condition associated with socioeconomic factors.\n\nRegional coverage variations are also found in Brazil and other countries. Such differences result from significant geographic, social, and cultural discrepancies between and within regions1616 Arroyo LH, Ramos ACV, Yamamura M, Weiller TH, Crispim JA, Cartagena-Ramos D, et al.

However, the MMRV vaccine is not systematically distributed to all Brazilian states. Minas Gerais has not received a supply of this vaccine since 20187070 Brasil. Ministério da Saúde.

We can infer that some professionals might be recording a second MMR dose in the MMRV field. This assumption indicates underrated coverage, which agrees with the findings of this study, since the MMR vaccine showed a different spatial behavior from the other vaccines (hepatitis A and varicella), both administered at 15 months of age.\n\nThe use of the Immunization Information System became a complex and multidimensional process influenced by structural and process conditions, issues with technological components of the software, little experience of the health team with technological resources, and lack of training to use and understand the system, impacting the record of these data and, consequently, the vaccination coverage6868 Silva BS, Guimarães EAA, Oliveira VC, Cavalcante RB, Pinheiro MMK, Gontijo TL, et al.

Study limitations include its ecological design based on secondary data, which may have inconsistencies related to the quality and quantity of information, due to incorrect filling and mistaken records of doses administered in the information system. Nevertheless, the choice of this type of source reduces operational costs and enables the performance of analyses. A consistency analysis of the database was carried out to minimize this limitation.\n\nThe results of this article can help health managers and professionals design interventions to structure immunization services and implement management actions (supervision, monitoring, evaluation) to increase vaccination coverage in places at higher risk of transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases. The research field must advance the knowledge of the practice of professionals working in the vaccination station regarding surveillance actions related to the child's vaccination status and confirm, using other methodological designs, the factors that impact vaccination coverage in the child population.\n\nIn addition, vaccination records and the quality of data from immunization information systems are issues that require attention and must be continuously monitored to improve these data and reduce the entry of mistaken information.\n\nLastly, this study aims to provide the basis for policies and promote the equitable expansion of access to and use of immunization services. To that end, further research is necessary."
