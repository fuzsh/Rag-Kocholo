        "text": "This paper explores the origins of pyrolithic technology in Ireland and examines the role fulachtaí fia may have played in the social customs of cooking among early farming communities. A critical assessment of the recent archaeological record confirms that the pyrolithic/water-boiling technology used in fulachtaí fia began during the Early Neolithic period but did not become widespread until c. 2800−2500 BC. The technology would appear to reflect a tradition of open-air cooking/feasting associated with communal food sharing that became increasingly popular during the Bronze Age before dying out in the mid first millennium BC.\n\nThis book details the archaeology of burnt mounds (fulachtaí fia) in Ireland, one of the most frequent and under researched prehistoric site types in the country. It presents a re-evaluation of the pyrolithic phenomenon in light of some 1000 excavated burnt mounds. Charcoal-enriched soil, along with spreads and mounds of heat-affected stone, are one of the most common types of site found in Ireland, largely as a consequence of numerous discoveries made in the course of road building. They represent an accumulation of firing material associated with a prehistoric pyrolithic technology, which involved a process of heat transfer that centred on the use of hot stones immersed in water-filled troughs or placed in small, lined/unlined pits/ovens. During the Bronze Age, the use of this technology became widely adopted in Northern Europe, particularly Ireland, where the phenomenon is represented in the field as a low crescent-shaped mound. Even though burnt mounds are the most common prehistoric site type in Ireland, they have not received the same level of research as other prehistoric sites. This is primarily due to the paucity of artefact finds and the unspectacular nature of the archaeological remains, compounded by the absence of an appropriate research framework. This is the most comprehensive study undertaken on the use of pyrolithic technology in prehistoric Ireland, dealing with different aspects of site function, chronology, social role and cultural context.\n\nThis paper examines the technical aspects of indirect cooking using pyrolithic technology in Ireland with a particular focus on its application during the Bronze Age. The widespread distribution of burnt mounds (fulachtaí fia) is striking, suggesting that Ireland was the most prolific user of the technology in Bronze Age Europe. However, narratives related to these sites have long time revolved around function, to an extent that the basic definition of this monument type has been called into question. This paper examines the use of these sites based on evidence from some one thousand excavated examples in Ireland. This review provides new insights into the use of pyrolithic technology for cooking. The model proposed here is of open-air feasting/food sharing hosted by small family groups, in a manner that was central to different types of social bonding.\n\nIn the 1930s, the terms ‘bowl furnace’ and ‘furnace bottom’ were coined in Ireland to describe respectively the installations and the waste products of what was believed to be the earliest type of iron-smelting furnace. Although since then these furnace bottoms have been identified as the waste of iron-smithing and, more recently, the slag-pit furnace recognised as the predominant early Irish iron furnace type, the bowl furnace has proved tenacious and still appears in the literature. This paper outlines the origins and history of the concept of the ‘bowl furnace’ in Ireland and further afield. It then compares the descriptions by metalworking specialists of the archaeological evidence of early Irish ironsmelting. The conclusion is that the bowl furnace can no longer be regarded as a furnace type used in Ireland. A terminology to describe the remains of the Irish slag-pit furnaces is suggested.
