Acts 1979, 66th Leg., p. 2234, ch. 841, Sec. 1, eff. Jan. 1, 1980.

Sec. 11.13. RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD. (a) A family or single adult is entitled to an exemption from taxation for the county purposes authorized in Article VIII, Section 1-a, of the Texas Constitution of $3,000 of the assessed value of his residence homestead.

(b) An adult is entitled to exemption from taxation by a school district of $100,000 of the appraised value of the adult's residence homestead, except that only $5,000 of the exemption applies to an entity operating under former Chapter 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, or 28, Education Code, as those chapters existed on May 1, 1995, as permitted by Section 11.301, Education Code.

(c) In addition to the exemption provided by Subsection (b) of this section, an adult who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a school district of $10,000 of the appraised value of his residence homestead.

(d) In addition to the exemptions provided by Subsections (b) and (c) of this section, an individual who is disabled or is 65 or older is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a portion (the amount of which is fixed as provided by Subsection (e) of this section) of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted either:

(1) by the governing body of the taxing unit; or

(2) by a favorable vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the taxing unit at an election called by the governing body of a taxing unit, and the governing body shall call the election on the petition of at least 20 percent of the number of qualified voters who voted in the preceding election of the taxing unit.

(e) The amount of an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section is $3,000 of the appraised value of the residence homestead unless a larger amount is specified by:

(1) the governing body authorizing the exemption if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (1) of Subsection (d) of this section; or

(2) the petition for the election if the exemption is authorized as provided by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section.

(f) Once authorized, an exemption adopted as provided by Subsection (d) of this section may be repealed or decreased or increased in amount by the governing body of the taxing unit or by the procedure authorized by Subdivision (2) of Subsection (d) of this section. In the case of a decrease, the amount of the exemption may not be reduced to less than $3,000 of the market value.

(g) If the residence homestead exemption provided by Subsection (d) of this section is adopted by a county that levies a tax for the county purposes authorized by Article VIII, Section 1-a, of the Texas Constitution, the residence homestead exemptions provided by Subsections (a) and (d) of this section may not be aggregated for the county tax purposes. An individual who is eligible for both exemptions is entitled to take only the exemption authorized as provided by Subsection (d) of this section for purposes of that county tax.

(h) Joint, community, or successive owners may not each receive the same exemption provided by or pursuant to this section for the same residence homestead in the same year. An eligible disabled person who is 65 or older may not receive both a disabled and an elderly residence homestead exemption from the same taxing unit in the same year but may choose either if a taxing unit has adopted both. An eligible disabled person who is 65 or older may receive both a disabled and an elderly residence homestead exemption in the same year if the person receives the exemptions with respect to taxes levied by different taxing units. A person may not receive an exemption under this section for more than one residence homestead in the same year. An heir property owner who qualifies heir property as the owner's residence homestead under this chapter is considered the sole recipient of any exemption granted to the owner for the residence homestead by or pursuant to this section.

(i) The assessor and collector for a taxing unit may disregard the exemptions authorized by Subsection (b), (c), (d), or (n) of this section and assess and collect a tax pledged for payment of debt without deducting the amount of the exemption if:

(1) prior to adoption of the exemption, the unit pledged the taxes for the payment of a debt; and

(2) granting the exemption would impair the obligation of the contract creating the debt.

(j) For purposes of this section:

(1) "Residence homestead" means a structure (including a mobile home) or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure (together with the land, not to exceed 20 acres, and improvements used in the residential occupancy of the structure, if the structure and the land and improvements have identical ownership) that:

(A) is owned by one or more individuals, either directly or through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust;

(B) is designed or adapted for human residence;

(C) is used as a residence; and

(D) is occupied as the individual's principal residence by an owner, by an owner's surviving spouse who has a life estate in the property, or, for property owned through a beneficial interest in a qualifying trust, by a trustor or beneficiary of the trust who qualifies for the exemption.

(2) "Trustor" means a person who transfers an interest in real or personal property to a qualifying trust, whether during the person's lifetime or at death, or the person's spouse.

(3) "Qualifying trust" means a trust:

(A) in which the agreement, will, or court order creating the trust, an instrument transferring property to the trust, or any other agreement that is binding on the trustee provides that the trustor of the trust or a beneficiary of the trust has the right to use and occupy as the trustor's or beneficiary's principal residence residential property rent free and without charge except for taxes and other costs and expenses specified in the instrument or court order:

(i) for life;

(ii) for the lesser of life or a term of years; or

(iii) until the date the trust is revoked or terminated by an instrument or court order that describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and is recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located; and

(B) that acquires the property in an instrument of title or under a court order that:

(i) describes the property with sufficient certainty to identify it and the interest acquired; and

(ii) is recorded in the real property records of the county in which the property is located.

(k) A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead if a portion of the structure is rented to another or is used primarily for other purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use of the structure. However, the amount of any residence homestead exemption does not apply to the value of that portion of the structure that is used primarily for purposes that are incompatible with the owner's residential use.

(l) A qualified residential structure does not lose its character as a residence homestead when the owner who qualifies for the exemption temporarily stops occupying it as a principal residence if that owner does not establish a different principal residence and the absence is:

(1) for a period of less than two years and the owner intends to return and occupy the structure as the owner's principal residence; or

(2) caused by the owner's:

(A) military service inside or outside of the United States as a member of the armed forces of the United States or of this state; or

(B) residency in a facility that provides services related to health, infirmity, or aging.

(m) In this section:

(1) "Disabled" means under a disability for purposes of payment of disability insurance benefits under Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance.

(2) "School district" means a political subdivision organized to provide general elementary and secondary public education. "School district" does not include a junior college district or a political subdivision organized to provide special education services.

(n) In addition to any other exemptions provided by this section, an individual is entitled to an exemption from taxation by a taxing unit of a percentage of the appraised value of his residence homestead if the exemption is adopted by the governing body of the taxing unit before July 1 in the manner provided by law for official action by the body. If the percentage set by the taxing unit produces an exemption in a tax year of less than $5,000 when applied to a particular residence homestead, the individual is entitled to an exemption of $5,000 of the appraised value. The percentage adopted by the taxing unit may not exceed 20 percent.

(n-1) The governing body of a school district, municipality, or county that adopted an exemption under Subsection (n) for the 2022 tax year may not reduce the amount of or repeal the exemption. This subsection expires December 31, 2027.

(o) For purposes of this section, a residence homestead also may consist of an interest in real property created through ownership of stock in a corporation incorporated under the Cooperative Association Act (Article 1396-50.01, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes) to provide dwelling places to its stockholders if:

(1) the interests of the stockholders of the corporation are appraised separately as provided by Section 23.19 of this code in the tax year to which the exemption applies;

(2) ownership of the stock entitles the owner to occupy a dwelling place owned by the corporation;

(3) the dwelling place is a structure or a separately secured and occupied portion of a structure; and

(4) the dwelling place is occupied as his principal residence by a stockholder who qualifies for the exemption.

(p) Exemption under this section for a homestead described by Subsection (o) of this section extends only to the dwelling place occupied as a residence homestead and to a portion of the total common area used in the residential occupancy that is equal to the percentage of the total amount of the stock issued by the corporation that is owned by the homestead claimant. The size of a residence homestead under Subsection (o) of this section, including any relevant portion of common area, may not exceed 20 acres.

(q) The surviving spouse of an individual who qualifies for an exemption under Subsection (d) for the residence homestead of a person 65 or older is entitled to an exemption for the same property from the same taxing unit in an amount equal to that of the exemption for which the deceased spouse qualified if:

(1) the deceased spouse died in a year in which the deceased spouse qualified for the exemption;

(2) the surviving spouse was 55 or older when the deceased spouse died; and

(3) the property was the residence homestead of the surviving spouse when the deceased spouse died and remains the residence homestead of the surviving spouse.

(r) An individual who receives an exemption under Subsection (d) is not entitled to an exemption under Subsection (q).

Sec. 11.1801. CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARITABLE HOSPITAL. (a) To qualify as a charitable organization under Section 11.18(d)(1), a nonprofit hospital or hospital system must provide charity care and community benefits as follows:

(1) charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided at a level that is reasonable in relation to the community needs, as determined through the community needs assessment, the available resources of the hospital or hospital system, and the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital or hospital system;

(2) charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue;

(3) charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care must be provided in an amount equal to at least 100 percent of the hospital's or hospital system's tax-exempt benefits, excluding federal income tax; or

(4) charity care and community benefits must be provided in a combined amount equal to at least five percent of the hospital's or hospital system's net patient revenue, provided that charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care are provided in an amount equal to at least four percent of net patient revenue.

(b) A nonprofit hospital that has been designated as a disproportionate share hospital under the state Medicaid program in the current year or in either of the previous two fiscal years shall be considered to have provided a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care and is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).

(c) A hospital operated on a nonprofit basis that is located in a county with a population of less than 58,000 and in which the entire county or the population of the entire county has been designated as a health professionals shortage area is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).

(d) A hospital providing health care services to inpatients or outpatients without receiving any payment for providing those services from any source, including the patient or person legally obligated to support the patient, third-party payors, Medicare, Medicaid, or any other state or local indigent care program but excluding charitable donations, legacies, bequests, or grants or payments for research, is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a).

(e) For purposes of complying with Subsection (a)(4), a hospital or hospital system may not change its existing fiscal year unless the hospital or hospital system changes its ownership or corporate structure as a result of a sale or merger.

(f) For purposes of this section, a hospital that complies with Subsection (a)(1) or that is considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d) shall be excluded in determining a hospital system's compliance with the standards in Subsection (a)(2), (3), or (4).

(g) For purposes of this section, "charity care," "government-sponsored indigent health care," "health care organization," "hospital system," "net patient revenue," "nonprofit hospital," and "tax-exempt benefits" have the meanings assigned by Sections 311.031 and 311.042, Health and Safety Code. A determination of the amount of community benefits and charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care provided by a hospital or hospital system and the hospital's or hospital system's compliance with Section 311.045, Health and Safety Code, shall be based on the most recently completed and audited prior fiscal year of the hospital or hospital system.

(h) The providing of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care in accordance with Subsection (a)(1) shall be guided by the prudent business judgment of the hospital, which will ultimately determine the appropriate level of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care based on the community needs, the available resources of the hospital, the tax-exempt benefits received by the hospital, and other factors that may be unique to the hospital, such as the hospital's volume of Medicare and Medicaid patients. These criteria shall not be determinative factors, but shall be guidelines contributing to the hospital's decision along with other factors that may be unique to the hospital. The formulas in Subsections (a)(2), (3), and (4) shall also not be considered determinative of a reasonable amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care.

(i) The requirements of this section shall not apply to the extent a hospital or hospital system demonstrates that reductions in the amount of community benefits, charity care, and government-sponsored indigent health care are necessary to maintain financial reserves at a level required by a bond covenant or are necessary to prevent the hospital or hospital system from endangering its ability to continue operations, or if the hospital or hospital system, as a result of a natural or other disaster, is required substantially to curtail its operations.

(j) In any fiscal year that a hospital or hospital system, through unintended miscalculation, fails to meet any of the standards in Subsection (a) or fails to be considered to be in compliance with the standards in Subsection (a) under Subsection (b), (c), or (d), the hospital or hospital system shall not lose its tax-exempt status without the opportunity to cure the miscalculation in the fiscal year following the fiscal year the failure is discovered by both meeting one of the standards and providing an additional amount of charity care and government-sponsored indigent health care that is equal to the shortfall from the previous fiscal year. A hospital or hospital system may apply this provision only once every five years.

Sec. 11.181. CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS IMPROVING PROPERTY FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING. (a) An organization is entitled to an exemption from taxation of improved or unimproved real property it owns if the organization:

(1) meets the requirements of a charitable organization provided by Sections 11.18(e) and (f);

(2) owns the property for the purpose of building or repairing housing on the property primarily with volunteer labor to sell without profit to an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income and other eligibility requirements; and

(3) engages exclusively in the building, repair, and sale of housing as described by Subdivision (2), and related activities.

(b) Property may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property. Property that received an exemption under Section 11.1825 and that was subsequently transferred by the organization described by that section that qualified for the exemption to an organization described by this section may not be exempted under Subsection (a) after the fifth anniversary of the date the transferring organization acquired the property.

(c) An organization entitled to an exemption under Subsection (a) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation of any building or tangible personal property the organization owns and uses in the administration of its acquisition, building, repair, or sale of property. To qualify for an exemption under this subsection, property must be used exclusively by the charitable organization, except that another individual or organization may use the property for activities incidental to the charitable organization's use that benefit the beneficiaries of the charitable organization.

(d) For the purposes of Subsection (e), the chief appraiser shall determine the market value of property exempted under Subsection (a) and shall record the market value in the appraisal records.

(e) If the organization that owns improved or unimproved real property that has been exempted under Subsection (a) sells the property to a person other than an individual or family satisfying the organization's low-income or other eligibility requirements, a penalty is imposed on the property equal to the amount of the taxes that would have been imposed on the property in each tax year that the property was exempted from taxation under Subsection (a), plus interest at an annual rate of 12 percent calculated from the dates on which the taxes would have become due.

(f) The charitable organization and the purchaser of the property from that organization are jointly and severally liable for the penalty and interest imposed under Subsection (e). A tax lien in favor of all taxing units for which the penalty is imposed attaches to the property to secure payment of the penalty and interest.

(g) The chief appraiser shall make an entry in the appraisal records for the property against which a penalty under Subsection (e) is imposed and shall deliver written notice of the imposition of the penalty and interest to the charitable organization and to the person who purchased the property from that organization.

(c) Property owned by the organization may not be exempted under Subsection (b) after the third anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property unless the organization is offering to rent or is renting the property without profit to a low-income or moderate-income individual or family satisfying the organization's eligibility requirements.

(d) A multifamily rental property consisting of 36 or more dwelling units owned by the organization that is exempted under Subsection (b) may not be exempted in a subsequent tax year unless in the preceding tax year the organization spent, for eligible persons in the county in which the property is located, an amount equal to at least 40 percent of the total amount of taxes that would have been imposed on the property in that year without the exemption on social, educational, or economic development services, capital improvement projects, or rent reduction. This subsection does not apply to property acquired by the organization using tax-exempt bond financing after January 1, 1997, and before December 31, 2001.

(f) An organization entitled to an exemption under Subsection (b) is also entitled to an exemption from taxation of any building or tangible personal property the organization owns and uses in the administration of its acquisition, building, repair, sale, or rental of property. To qualify for an exemption under this subsection, property must be used exclusively by the organization, except that another person may use the property for activities incidental to the organization's use that benefit the beneficiaries of the organization.

(g) To receive an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f), an organization must annually:

(1) have an audit prepared by an independent auditor that includes a detailed report on the organization's sources and uses of funds; and

(2) deliver a copy of the audit to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs and to the chief appraiser of the appraisal district in which the property subject to the exemption is located.

(h) Subsections (d) and (e)(3) do not apply to property owned by an organization if:

(1) the entity that provided the financing for the acquisition or construction of the property:

(i) If any property owned by an organization receiving an exemption under this section has been acquired or sold during the preceding year, such organization shall file by March 31 of the following year with the chief appraiser in the county in which the relevant property is located, on a form promulgated by the comptroller of public accounts, a list of such properties acquired or sold during the preceding year.

(j) An organization may not receive an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f) for property for a tax year unless the organization received an exemption under that subsection for the property for any part of the 2003 tax year.

(k) Notwithstanding Subsection (j) of this section and Sections 11.43(a) and (c), an exemption under Subsection (b) or (f) does not terminate because of a change in the ownership of the property if the property is sold at a foreclosure sale and, not later than the 30th day after the date of the sale, the owner of the property submits to the chief appraiser evidence that the property is owned by an organization that meets the requirements of Subsections (b)(1), (2), and (4). If the owner of the property submits the evidence required by this subsection, the exemption continues to apply to the property for the remainder of the current tax year and for subsequent tax years until the owner ceases to qualify the property for the exemption. This subsection does not prohibit the chief appraiser from requiring the owner to file a new application to confirm the owner's current qualification for the exemption as provided by Section 11.43(c).

(2) the person from whom the organization acquired the project must have owned the project for at least five years, if the organization is not the original owner of the project;

(3) the organization must provide to the chief appraiser and, if the project was financed with bonds, the issuer of the bonds a written statement prepared by a certified public accountant stating that the organization has spent on rehabilitation costs at least the greater of $5,000 or the amount required by the financial lender for each dwelling unit in the project; and

(4) the organization must maintain a reserve fund for replacements:

(A) in the amount required by the financial lender; or

(B) if the financial lender does not require a reserve fund for replacements, in an amount equal to $300 per unit per year.

(m) Beginning with the 2005 tax year, the amount of the reserve required by Subsection (l)(4)(B) is increased by an annual cost-of-living adjustment determined in the manner provided by Section 1(f)(3), Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substituting "calendar year 2004" for the calendar year specified in Section 1(f)(3)(B) of that code.

(n) A reserve must be established for each dwelling unit in the property, regardless of whether the unit is reserved for an individual or family described by Subsection (f). The reserve must be maintained on a continuing basis, with withdrawals permitted:

(1) only as authorized by the financial lender; or

(2) if the financial lender does not require a reserve fund for replacements, only to pay the cost of capital improvements needed for the property to maintain habitability under the Minimum Property Standards of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the code of a municipality or county applicable to the property, whichever is more restrictive.

(o) For purposes of Subsection (n)(2), "capital improvement" means a property improvement that has a depreciable life of at least five years under generally accepted accounting principles, excluding typical "make ready" expenses such as expenses for plasterboard repair, interior painting, or floor coverings.

(p) If the organization acquires the property for the purpose of constructing or rehabilitating a housing project on the property, the organization must be renting or offering to rent the applicable square footage of dwelling units in the property to individuals or families described by Subsection (f) not later than the third anniversary of the date the organization acquires the property.

(p-1) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the transfer of property from an organization described by this section to a nonprofit organization that claims an exemption for the property under Section 11.181(a) is a proper use of and purpose for owning the property under this section and does not affect the eligibility of the property for an exemption under this section.

(q) If property qualifies for an exemption under this section, the chief appraiser shall use the income method of appraisal as described by Section 23.012 to determine the appraised value of the property. The chief appraiser shall use that method regardless of whether the chief appraiser considers that method to be the most appropriate method of appraising the property. In appraising the property, the chief appraiser shall:

(1) consider the restrictions provided by this section on the income of the individuals or families to whom the dwelling units of the housing project may be rented and the amount of rent that may be charged for purposes of computing the actual rental income from the property or projecting future rental income; and

(2) use the same capitalization rate that the chief appraiser uses to appraise other rent-restricted properties.

(r) Not later than January 31 of each year, the appraisal district shall give public notice in the manner determined by the district, including posting on the district's website if applicable, of the capitalization rate to be used in that year to appraise property receiving an exemption under this section.

(s) Unless otherwise provided by the governing body of a taxing unit any part of which is located in a county with a population of at least 2.1 million under Subsection (x), for property described by Subsection (f)(1), the amount of the exemption under this section from taxation is 50 percent of the appraised value of the property.

(s-1) For property described by Subsection (f)(2), the amount of the exemption under this section from taxation is 100 percent of the appraised value of the property.

(t) Notwithstanding Section 11.43(c), an exemption under this section does not terminate because of a change in ownership of the property if:

(1) the property is foreclosed on for any reason and, not later than the 30th day after the date of the foreclosure sale, the owner of the property submits to the chief appraiser evidence that the property is owned by:

(A) an organization that meets the requirements of Subsection (b); or

(B) an entity that meets the requirements of Subsections (c) and (d); or

(2) in the case of property owned by an entity described by Subsections (c) and (d), the organization meeting the requirements of Subsection (b) that controls the general partner interest of or is the parent of the entity as described by Subsection (c) ceases to serve in that capacity and, not later than the 30th day after the date the cessation occurs, the owner of the property submits evidence to the chief appraiser that the organization has been succeeded in that capacity by another organization that meets the requirements of Subsection (b).

(u) The chief appraiser may extend the deadline provided by Subsection (t)(1) or (2), as applicable, for good cause shown.

(v) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an organization may not receive an exemption from taxation of property described by Subsection (f)(1) by a taxing unit any part of which is located in a county with a population of at least 2.1 million unless the exemption is approved by the governing body of the taxing unit in the manner provided by law for official action.

(w) To receive an exemption under this section from taxation by a taxing unit for which the approval of the governing body of the taxing unit is required by Subsection (v), an organization must submit to the governing body of the taxing unit a written request for approval of the exemption from taxation of the property described in the request.

(x) Not later than the 60th day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit receives a written request under Subsection (w) for an exemption under this section, the governing body shall:

(1) approve the exemption in the amount provided by Subsection (s);

(2) approve the exemption in a reasonable amount other than the amount provided by Subsection (s); or

(3) deny the exemption if the governing body determines that:

(A) the taxing unit cannot afford the loss of ad valorem tax revenue that would result from approving the exemption; or

(B) additional housing for individuals or families meeting the income eligibility requirements of this section is not needed in the territory of the taxing unit.

(y) Not later than the fifth day after the date the governing body of the taxing unit takes action under Subsection (x), the taxing unit shall issue a letter to the organization stating the governing body's action and, if the governing body denied the exemption, stating whether the denial was based on a determination under Subsection (x)(3)(A) or (B) and the basis for the determination. The taxing unit shall send a copy of the letter by regular mail to the chief appraiser of each appraisal district that appraises the property for the taxing unit. The governing body may charge the organization a fee not to exceed the administrative costs of processing the request of the organization, approving or denying the exemption, and issuing the letter required by this subsection. If the chief appraiser determines that the property qualifies for an exemption under this section and the governing body of the taxing unit approves the exemption, the chief appraiser shall grant the exemption in the amount approved by the governing body.
