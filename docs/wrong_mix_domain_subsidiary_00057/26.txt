Nynex Corp has launched trials of analogue and digital video-on-demand services with a group of its Manhattan telephone subscribers, enabling them to use their television remote controls to order movies, home shopping services and other programmes whenever they choose. On-Demand Technologies Inc of Austin is providing the interactive video server software for the analogue trial and the video jukebox; a Stratus Computer Inc XA-R machine is running the service; Dynair Electronics Inc of San Diego supplied the video switch that routes the programming from the video jukebox to the customers; and Scientific Atlanta Inc the modulators that place the programmes on the proper channel on the fibre system. Minneapolis-based ADC Telecommunications Inc’s American Lightwave Systems in Meriden, Connecticut is doing the fibre loop access capability transmitters, receivers and modulators – between the Nynex exchange and the apartment complexes. The digital trial will start in September and uses a Digital Equipment Corp interactive information server to store the programs, supporting such services as video-on-demand and home shopping. Zenith Electronics Corp is supplying the digital set-top control boxes, signal processing equipment and a 16-VSB modulation system that will transmit the digital signals on the fibre-coax system; ADC Telecommunications is supplying the Homeworx fibre-coax loop access system, including transmitters and receivers. The services will initially be available to 50 subscribers in three East Side apartment buildings – some subscribers are already using the services and all 50 are due to be linked to the system by the end of the month. By year-end, up to 800 residents of the three buildings are expected to take part in the interactive trials.
