One of the powers which is greater than the other is routed to one of the communications equipments which is to be used as a regular equipment (4) with no regard to whether it has initially been a regular equipment or not. The other or smaller power is routed to the other comÂ­ munications equipment which is to be used as a protection equipment (5) with no regard to whether it has initially been a protection equipment or not. This system has a simple construction and allows a minimum of deterioration to occur in communications quality despite the distribution of a power to a protection equipment which is at the standby.\n\nEP85106683A 1984-05-31 1985-05-30 Hot standby communications system Withdrawn EP0163311A3 (en)\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (2)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title JP111348/84 1984-05-31 JP59111348A JPS60254928A (en) 1984-05-31 1984-05-31 Set stand-by communication system\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date EP0163311A2 EP0163311A2 (en) 1985-12-04 EP0163311A3 true EP0163311A3 (en) 1986-06-11\n\nFamily\n\nID=14558912\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date EP85106683A Withdrawn EP0163311A3 (en) 1984-05-31 1985-05-30 Hot standby communications system\n\nCountry Status (4)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US4700348A (en) EP (1) EP0163311A3 (en) JP (1) JPS60254928A (en) CA (1) CA1241076A (en)\n\nFamilies Citing this family (36)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title JPS6294050A (en) * 1985-10-21 1987-04-30 Hitachi Ltd Switching system for duplicating device EP0291789B1 (en) * 1987-05-22 1991-09-25 Siemens Aktiengesellschaft Circuit arrangement for centrally controlled time division multiplex telecommunication exchanges, especially pcm telephone exchanges, with line groups connected to a switching network US4879716A (en) * 1987-12-23 1989-11-07 Bull Hn Information Systems Inc.
