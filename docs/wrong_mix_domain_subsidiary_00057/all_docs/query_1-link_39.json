        "text": "4 Mar 31, 2024 The NextGen Catalog is operational in the production environment and considered in an O&M steady state. DAS is in O&M steady state; however, modernization and enhancement efforts for the NextGen DAS remain in progress. Final implementation and hand-off to NARA's test team is scheduled for mid-summer 2024. NextGen HMS UAT completed 03/08/24 and the production environment completed standup 03/13/24 with the production code and data. The phased rollout of the application to users was divided into four iterations beginning 03/22/24 and scheduled to end 05/13/24. 4 Nov 30, 2023 The NextGen Catalog is now operational in the production environment and considered in an O&M steady state. The legacy NAC is scheduled to be decommissioned by December 2023. DAS is in O&M steady state; however, modernization and enhancement efforts for the NextGen DAS remain in progress. There is a delay in the NextGen DAS final release due to product and sprint backlog replanning, redefined service level agreements (SLAs), and underestimation of level of effort (LOE). In addition, NARA's transition from SecureAuth to Azure AD has caused an additional shift in schedule, final delivery date and costs due to the LOE for the vendor to implement. NextGen HMS has completed the developement phase of the project. UAT and Stage Gate reviews will run through December 2023 and rollout and data migration is projected to occur during Q1 CY 2024. 3 Sep 30, 2022 NARA has hired several key resources for the Program Management division, including supervisors and program managers. The result has been a workload balance and an increase in quality products. However, hiring and recruiting qualified federal resources as developers for the ECRM platform has been difficult. Oracle now offers a limited support option called Market Driven Support (MDS) which NARA will purchase to extend support to the Oracle/Siebel platform through December 31, 2023. The National Archives Catalog (NAC) and Description and Authority Service (DAS) modernization and enhancement efforts continue with agile development to foster scalable, stable, and the performant applications. 3 Jun 30, 2022 NARA has hired several key resources for the Program Management division, including supervisors and program managers.

There have been delays in the government hiring and recruiting of qualified candidates for timely success. Similar with ARCIS and CMRS, the legacy HMS platform of Oracle/Siebel will reach its end of life in July 2022 and will no longer receive patches and support from the vendor. The National Archives Catalog (NAC) and Description and Authority Service (DAS) modernization and enhancement efforts are ongoing. Additional presidential libraries websites are being developed under the Websites-to-the-Cloud investment. The RCPBS upgrade and migration project is complete. Deployment is pending completion of end-of-year processing. Decommissioning of the legacy system will take place in Q1 of FY 22 complete."
