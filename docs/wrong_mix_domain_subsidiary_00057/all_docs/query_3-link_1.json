        "text": "Africa Data Centres, a division of the Cassava Technologies group, has introduced ADC Channel. The channel partner programme will establish co-location and ecosystem partnerships, empowering members to expand their product portfolio and market presence.\n\nAccording to a statement, ADC Channel will foster collaboration among partners within Africa’s ISP, carrier, telecommunications, systems integration, ICT and data centre ecosystem.\n\nChannel partners will have additional product offerings, and in turn generate new revenue streams and potentially expand their footprint.\n\nThey will also have access to data centre experts and receive ongoing commercial and technical support, says the company.\n\nADC bills itself as Africa's largest network of interconnected, carrier- and cloud-neutral data centre facilities.\n\nADC Channel offers partners the opportunity to deliver innovative, sustainable and cost-effective digital solutions to their clients, says ADC.\n\nPartners enrolled in ADC Channel will benefit from a flexible approach that accommodates various partnership and go-to-market models, it adds.\n\nFinhai Munzara, CFO of Africa Data Centres, comments: “It serves as a platform for clients to enrich their product portfolios and seamlessly extend their business across diverse ecosystems with openness and transparency.\n\n“Africa Data Centres invites partners to embark on this transformative journey towards shaping the future of digital connectivity in Africa.”\n\nMunzara notes partners will be able to augment their existing portfolio, allowing them to offer bundled solutions and expand their offerings, enhancing their revenue streams and positioning them for further growth and customer retention.\n\nAfrica Data Centres already has an established ADC Marketplace, a platform for partners and customers across the continent. It allows partners to list and showcase their IT services, and customers to explore offerings, fostering collaboration and visibility within the African tech community.\n\nThe channel programme also offers commercial and technical support, and regular, complimentary training for partners’ sales and product teams.\n\nPartners face no financial risk, as participation in the channel programme requires no investment and no capital expenditure for building data centres, according to ADC.\n\n“Exclusive channel partner benefits include competitive pricing, dedicated sales and pre-sales teams, remote support and access to joint marketing resources and activities, enabling partners to thrive in the marketplace,” notes the company."
