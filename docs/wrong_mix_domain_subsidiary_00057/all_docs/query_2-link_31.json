Avidyne has been incredible with their transparency over the years, and hopefully that will continue through this 10.3 debacle.\n\nThese are the two that are causing me the most trouble. There are many more that have been reported in this forum, including one that reboots the IFD!\n\n1. Frequency issue - The active and standby frequency fields do not retain the last values after a power cycle. Rather, they get initialized to \"default\" values of 118.2 and 132.65, respectively.\n\n2. Altitude Setpoints over ARINC429 - If an altitude constraint is present, an altitude setpoint is sent out over the ARINC429 interface (the value sent is the altitude constraint +1), even if Enroute VNAV is turned off. This is a new behavior with 10.3 and causes unexpected operation from at least some autopilots.\n\nHey Avidyne, can you share a list of reported issues/bugs/anomalies, with a status for each? The status should indicate whether it's a confirmed bug or just the new normal, whether Avidyne has found a solution yet, etc. Also, it would be nice to know how/when Avidyne plans to fix the confirmed bugs. Are they working on an update to be released in the next few days or weeks? Or should we expect to live with this for another year or more?\n\nEdited by pburger - 27 Oct 2022 at 2:09pm\n\nAviSteve\n\nAdmin Group\n\nJoined: 12 Feb 2018\n\nLocation: Melbourne, FL\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 2185 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 27 Oct 2022 at 10:23pm\n\nAt the risk of appearing opaque, I'm not prepared to share any plans or potential release notes.

It would be helpful for the users to have an ongoing curated list of bugs with any short term workarounds or situational details related to the bugs.\n\nThat would allow us to review in one location what to look out for and confirm what we've reported has been received, instead of searching for keywords that might not match and spamming the forum with items that have been already reported.\n\nThis could be a static page on the Avidyne website and would show good faith on the part of your upper management. Your engineers in the forum and your support staff via email are highly responsive. I would hope your QA and communications department were equally responsive and responsible, too.\n\nThank you.\n\nPA23\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2019\n\nLocation: MMU\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 306 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 01 Nov 2022 at 3:57pm\n\nI starting to create my own list based upon what people have been posting and/or my own experiences. Right now I've only seen one critical bug which deals with RF legs, but the poster provided a method to prevent the IFD from restarting, and I don't have any RF approaches anywhere near where I fly (yet).\n\nEdited by PA23 - 01 Nov 2022 at 4:23pm\n\nPA23\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2019\n\nLocation: MMU\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 306 Post Options Thanks(1) Quote Reply Posted: 02 Nov 2022 at 9:26am\n\nThe list I've compiled so far includes 15 items that have been publicly discussed, I'm sure there are more that either I've missed or have not been discussed publicly. For the bug description either I've summarized the issue or I have simply taken the description verbatim from the posters message. It is possible that some of these \"bugs\" are working as intended.\n\nBugs 10.3.0.2 (known)\n\n1) *CRITICAL* system reboot when highlighting or selecting non-RNP required AR/RF approach - work-around enable RF legs in maintenance mode?\n\n2) IFD loses the last selected frequencies upon power up\n\n3) Altitude Setpoints over ARINC429 - If an altitude constraint is present, an altitude setpoint is sent out over the ARINC429 interface (the value sent is the altitude constraint +1), even if Enroute VNAV is turned off. This is a new behavior with 10.3 and causes unexpected operation from at least some autopilots.\n\n4) EFB loses connectivity to the IFD to push flight plans (Unable - IFD became unresponsive)\n\n5) unable to connect an android device to the IFD (work around available)\n\n6) (dual IFDs) If I try to enter a direct-to airport, my other IFD440 will pop up the keyboard as expected... I can then try to type the icao id of the airport which works fine... however, the \"Activate KXYZ\" simply comes and immediately goes away... My current workaround is to use the BT keyboard which allows the \"Activate KXYZ\" to persist until I select it\n\n7) when using ADS-B in from a wireless device (eg Stratux), IFD will randomly reject connections and issue various datalink errors, may also extend to hardwired units\n\n8) (dual IFDs) I cannot seem to edit the \"cross\"/\"at\"/\"wxyz ft\" section in the FMS via the latest IFD100 on my iPad... I have no problems editing it on either IFD-440 though.\n\n9) (dual IFDs) I have seen cases where on one of my IFD-440's, I can \"direct-to KXYZ\" but that my other IFD-440's FMS will still show the previous \"direct-to\" that was entered.\n\n10) TOD descent rate reset to a descent ANGLE of 4 degrees instead of fpm as was originally (AUX -> Setup -> FMS, expand FMS, expand VNAV and set the descent rate appropriately.\n\n11) airdata calculator brings up full keyboard instead of numeric only\n\n12) IFD offering UHF frequencies (Jeppesen? Avidyne? issue?)\n\n13) IFD not always ID'ing nav frequencies (showing EE)\n\n14) No Comm Icarus Alt (false alarm message, clear and continue)\n\n15) some users have reported that they are unable to acquire a GPS signal after power up - seems to be very few and might be a red herring\n\nEdited by PA23 - 03 Nov 2022 at 11:01am\n\nbradthepilot\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 07 Jan 2017\n\nLocation: St. Paul MN\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 65 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 02 Nov 2022 at 11:13am\n\nDon't forget the \"Datalink Function Lost\" message a lot of us with both hardwired and WiFi-attached ADS-B receivers are seeing. My setup worked without issue for about two years running 10.2; 10.3 causes loss of all ADS-B weather products 15-ish minutes after startup after showing the aforementioned message.\n\nBrad Benson\n\nRV-6A N164BL\n\nPA23\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2019\n\nLocation: MMU\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 306 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 02 Nov 2022 at 11:35am\n\nI haven't seen anybody mention hardwired ADS-B in issues until your message about it ADS-B in, the wireless ADS-B in I have as #7. Then again that doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist.\n\nI am using hardwired to an NGT9000 and I don't have issues other than the occasional \"late message\" (?)\n\nI'll add it to the list by extending item 7 to \"potentially include wired connections too\".\n\nEdited by PA23 - 02 Nov 2022 at 11:48am\n\nDallas90\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 19 Oct 2022\n\nLocation: Texas\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 63 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 02 Nov 2022 at 11:53am\n\nI would like to add something to your list that is a mistake being touted as a feature.\n\n(Reminders no longer trigger the MSG alert on some PFDs).\n\nThis should be a user option, since it will someday keep someone from running a tank dry or getting an out of limits fuel imbalance.\n\nBuilding a reminder in some heavier aircraft will get you a \"Message Alert\" and an aural warning that will repeat every couple of minutes until cleared.

I reported the 1st item. Please edit your post to show it is for non-Auth Required Radius to Fix approaches. These approaches are usable by all GA aircraft and pilots, which is why I stumbled across it. I do not know how an Auth Required/Radius to Fix approach would behave with the maintenance default of RF Legs = Disabled.\n\nI can confirm that setting the maintenance value of RF Legs = Enabled prevented a crash and reboot when highlighting or selecting a non AR/RF approach.

Wow was I in for a shock, being an IFR pilot flying in the north east I simply assumed everybody was going to use the software similar to how I envisioned it being used, boy was I wrong! Some of the users I met up with fly out west in the backcountry, they were more concerned with the non FAA charts that showed roads and topographic features as they were always looking for the uncharted airstrip someplace \"near Fred's farm\", they could care less about approach plates and really didn't care too much about the sectional chart either.\n\nDallas90\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 19 Oct 2022\n\nLocation: Texas\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 63 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 03 Nov 2022 at 12:43pm\n\nI agree with you and even noted it was a design decision in my opening sentence. I also am no programmer, but I do have 23,000 hours in everything from 152's to 787's and find this to be a potential safety of flight issue. It's been 35 years since I was a flight instructor, but I keep an eye out for threats to the way I operate as well as how it might be a threat to others. Thinking back on some of my students as they developed their skills, there were some that would have easily missed a reminder out of their immediate field of view early in their training. Also keep in mind that while some have an IFD mounted up on their panel, others have it (as in my SR-20) a bit more out of your immediate field of view. In this case, it can be a decision and a bug!\n\nEdited by Dallas90 - 03 Nov 2022 at 7:41pm\n\nPA23\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2019\n\nLocation: MMU\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 306 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 11 Nov 2022 at 2:02pm PA23\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2019\n\nLocation: MMU\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 306 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 11 Nov 2022 at 2:05pm\n\nI've updated my list slightly with the user identified bugs.

I can then try to type the icao id of the airport which works fine... however, the \"Activate KXYZ\" simply comes and immediately goes away... My current workaround is to use the BT keyboard which allows the \"Activate KXYZ\" to persist until I select it\n\n7) when using ADS-B in from a wireless device (eg Stratux), IFD will randomly reject connections and issue various datalink errors, may also extend to hardwired units\n\n8) (dual IFDs) I cannot seem to edit the \"cross\"/\"at\"/\"wxyz ft\" section in the FMS via the latest IFD100 on my iPad... I have no problems editing it on either IFD-440 though.\n\n9) (dual IFDs) I have seen cases where on one of my IFD-440's, I can \"direct-to KXYZ\" but that my other IFD-440's FMS will still show the previous \"direct-to\" that was entered.\n\n10) TOD descent rate reset to a descent ANGLE of 4 degrees instead of fpm as was originally (AUX -> Setup -> FMS, expand FMS, expand VNAV and set the descent rate appropriately.\n\n11) airdata calculator brings up full keyboard instead of numeric only\n\n12) IFD offering UHF frequencies (Jeppesen? Avidyne? issue?)\n\n13) IFD not always ID'ing nav frequencies (showing EE)\n\n14) No Comm Icarus Alt (false alarm message, clear and continue)\n\n15) EFB loses connectivity to the IFD to push flight plans (Unable - IFD became unresponsive)\n\n16) When IFD100 is connected a second (EFB) device is not recognized.\n\nminor update to #2 and addition of #16\n\nI'm sure Avidyne is working on fixes, hopefully they will be out sooner rather than later. Other than items #1 and #2 personally I find the issues to be more annoying and certainly not a safety of flight issue. Item #1 has very few locations where it can be triggered and there exists a usable work around that prevents the crash. After multiple flights I have determined that item #2 doesn't seem to effect me but YMMV.\n\nEdited by PA23 - 24 Nov 2022 at 12:03pm LarryPetro\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 03 Nov 2011\n\nLocation: Washington, DC\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 66 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 Nov 2022 at 2:00pm\n\nMy IFD440s (10.2 versions) have been experiencing GPS Integrity Lost during RNAV approaches for a couple years.

Support, install manual and local avionics tech indicate that the GPS antenna must be at least 6 inches away from another GPS antenna to avoid interference and at least 18 inches from a non-TSO'd GPS antenna (Stratus/Stratux/etc).\n\nI have my L3 txpdr GPS antenna right next to the Avidyne GPS antenna, due to a bad install job. I can lose GPS ownship placement and the map can freeze during a 90 degree turn (or more).\n\nIf you've got another GPS antenna or a separate antenna for both your 440's and they are close to each other, this might be the issue.\n\nLarryPetro\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 03 Nov 2011\n\nLocation: Washington, DC\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 66 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 Nov 2022 at 5:50pm\n\nThere is certainly lots of banking during the course reversal, which I think is relevant. I think the problems occur after flying for an hour or, two, which is when the IFDs are heat soaked. The two GPS antennas are five feet apart; the closest antenna to one is 3 feet; and the closest antenna (an XM antenna) to the other is 1.5 ft. To me, the separations seem reasonable, but maybe not.\n\nLarry Petro - Columbia 350 @ KFME\n\nC88atapult\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 04 Aug 2021\n\nLocation: San Diego, CA\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 43 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 24 Nov 2022 at 7:21pm\n\n@LarryPetro,\n\nThose separations are more than adequate, based on what support and the avionics tech told me.

In all cases the configuration issue was present before 10.3.0.2. The only thing new that 10.3.0.2 did was to issue an alert when the condition was detected.\n\nPlease check your configuration. If you can confirm that your Icarus is indeed wired to the IFDs per the configuration, we would be glad to investigate this further.\n\nEdited by AviSteve - 23 Feb 2023 at 11:31am\n\nSteve Lindsley\n\nAvidyne Engineering\n\ncomancheguy\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 24 Aug 2011\n\nLocation: Maryland\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 160 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 23 Feb 2023 at 11:29am\n\nSteve -\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nOk, so this is new information. Nothing changed in my configuration since before 10.3.0.2.\n\nI had to rebuild all of my config settings (with tech support's help) after the boxes went to Avidyne for hardware fixes, and the factory didn't backup and restore the configs. Had anyone told me to back everything up, I would have. This was way back, for the GPS HW fixes.\n\nSince then, an Avidyne dealer who was way more familiar with the Brand G avionics added a 345 transponder. I had to resolve many of the config / settings issues from that install to get everything working (again with a bit of help from tech support).\n\nI don't know why I have on 540 #1 (on the Main RS232 Config) CHNL 1 set to: INPUT: Icarus-alt Output Avtn no alt?\n\nIcarus is an altitude alerter? I don't have one to my knowledge. Could something else be using this setting? The 345 perhaps? This is likely what is causing the message to pop up. But, why is it configured?\n\nKen\n\nSteve Lindsley\n\nAvidyne Engineering\n\nSteve -\n\nThanks for the reply. I don't see this message in the pilot's guide for 10.3.0.2?\n\nI dug into this a bit. I found some emails from tech support when we reconfigured all of this.\n\nI believe that the icarus-alt is there on RS232 channel #1 for my altitude encoder, a trans-cal SSD-120.\n\nNow, I don't know what is misconfigured. I'll take it to a dealer if I can't figure this out.\n\nLet me ask you this?\n\nShould one see the P-ALT on the \"Main Inputs\" page, if one had an encoder wired to that pin?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nKen\n\nAviSteve\n\nAdmin Group\n\nJoined: 12 Feb 2018\n\nLocation: Melbourne, FL\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 2185 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 23 Feb 2023 at 3:55pm\n\nFYI I'm out until Tuesday, so doing this off the top of my head. I could be wrong...\n\nThe message is documented in the PG, but it probably doesn't say Icarus. It's a general message for any of the connected DAUs (data acquisition units), of which Icarus is one. So look for \"No Comm dau\" in the PG.\n\nSince you don't actually have an Icarus, I'll assume that you're sure about the data output of your trans-cal unit being compatible. Assuming it is...\n\nI believe you should see the decoded altitude on the Main Inputs page next to P-ALT. If you're relatively sure the encoder is connected right and you still don't see a value there, then I'd call tech support to double check me.\n\nSteve Lindsley\n\nAvidyne Engineering\n\ncomancheguy\n\nSenior Member\n\nJoined: 24 Aug 2011\n\nLocation: Maryland\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 160 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 23 Feb 2023 at 8:38pm\n\nThanks, Steve\n\nNo problem.

At least in mine it does.\n\nI have the icarus encoder \"wired\" to the xponder, and to the IFD as shown in the installation manual, but with the installation of the Aspen efis, I set the ADC up as the encoder. (pitot / static /xponder tests/certs are listed as ADC)\n\nI still have the Icarus shown on the mx pages, (rs232? ) I think.

After being reinstalled, initially the configuration page for the remote transponder did not display when the 540 was powered up. The 540 was powered down, the 540 was reseated and powered up and the remote transponder page did then display. Before the 540 was sent to Avidyne for the update, pictures of all the configuration and software pages were taken. The previous settings for the 540 were confirmed against the settings on the remote transponder configuration page. The transponder code box was available and all appeared normal for transponder operation. However, a âNO COMM ICARUS ALTâ error message subsequently displayed on the IFD540. The previous setting on the RS232 page for channel 1 showed âICARUS-ALT for the input and âAviationâ for the output. Those are the settings currently on the updated 540 (10.3.2.1). The aircraft was flown and ATC did confirm correct Mode C readouts. Furthermore, the Air Data page in the CALCULATIONS tab in the AUX pages did show a correct altitude readout highlighted in green. Any ideas out there whey the âNO COMM ICARUS ALTâ error message keeps displaying?\n\nKIM\n\nGroupie\n\nJoined: 12 Oct 2013\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 62 Post Options Thanks(0) Quote Reply Posted: 25 May 2023 at 3:16pm\n\n+1: NO COMM ICARUS ALT\n\nKlaus\n\nAviSteve\n\nAdmin Group\n\nJoined: 12 Feb 2018\n\nLocation: Melbourne, FL\n\nStatus: Offline\n\nPoints: 2185 Post Options Thanks(1) Quote Reply Posted: 25 May 2023 at 4:32pm\n\nNo Comm Icarus Alt is presented when the IFD has not heard from the Icarus for 3 seconds.\n\nEvery single time I've looked into this alert, it has turned out to be a configuration issue. Can you confirm that the Icarus in your airplane is actually connected to the port that is configured on the Main RS232 Config page, and that it's transmitting data on that port? If you can confirm both of those things and you're still getting this alert, then we can dig in further."
