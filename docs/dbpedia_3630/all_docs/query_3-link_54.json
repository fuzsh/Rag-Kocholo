        "text": "Join us for a day of special programming in the Frost Planetarium and across the museum to learn about the science and history of eclipses.\n\nApril’s eclipse is a total solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon is the right distance away from the Earth to completely obscure our view of the Sun. It will be a beautiful sight! Here in Miami, the eclipse will be visible as a partial solar eclipse, with only part of the Sun’s disk obscured during the peak. The eclipse will begin at 1:47 p.m. and reach its maximum coverage of 45% of the Sun at 3:01 p.m. The eclipse will end at 4:13 p.m.\n\nDuring this time, you can marvel at the partial solar eclipse using solar viewers or your own pair of solar eclipse glasses. Every ticket holder will be given a free pair of eclipse glasses on April 8!\n\nMuseum rooftop access (Level 6) will be limited to active Frost Science members only, and available on a first-come, first-served basis, weather permitting.\n\n*Please carefully read user instructions on eclipse glasses before use. Use of eclipse glasses is at your own risk."
