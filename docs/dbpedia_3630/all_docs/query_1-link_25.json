        "text": "See other formats\n\ns mm IRAN FOLKWAYS RECORDS Album No. FW 8856 ©Folkways Records and Service Corp. , 701 Seventh Ave. , NYC USA FOLK SONGS AND DANCES OF NOTES ON PERSIAN MUSIC BY ANTHONY BYAN SHAY IRAN Iran has the oldest existing culture in the Middle East today. The far-reaching influence of Persian music is felt in Europe, the Soviet Union, Africa, and the Far East. The Persians have always maintained a sedentary and insidious culture and for this reason were able to develop all forms of fine arts to great heights in Iran. Persian music is the basis for nearly all other Middle. Eastern and North African music; this includes Spanish flamenco which employs a sobbing effect akin to. but not as versatile as, the Persian classical Svaz. Persian music, like Western music, may be divided into classical, popular, and folk. All real Persian music is cast into one of the dastgah, which comes close to being similar to the Indian Raga. The dastgah is very difficult to explain, but for Persian folk music it is not necessary to have more than a basic idea of this musical form. A dastgah contains many gushe which are, again roughly, comparable to modes. Not only do the dastgah and gushe determine the tonality of a composition but also the character and emotional content of the music. An extensive knowledge of the dastgah is necessary in order to know or perform classical music. That these dastgah are Persian and ethnic is attested to by the fact that all Persian folk songs are cast in one or more of these dastgah. Many of the dastgah contain place names and purely Per¬ sian words that are used by the Turks, Arabs, and many of the Soviet groups. Some of the dastgah are more native to particular Although war and heoric songs do occur in Persian folk music, if it were to be compared to Jugoslavia, Greece, or Turkey, all of whom are influenced heavily by Persian music, nearly all of the folk poetry of Iran is seeped with love. Unrequieted love fills the great¬ est portion of both classical and folk lyrics. The various colorful national and ethnic groups which populate Iran are all to little known. It is from these groups that the folk- music comes. It is well to mention here that the influence of Islam has a direct bearing on the quantity and type of music found in present day Iran. Music and dance flourish in areas where the influence of Islam is least felt. When Islam was brought to Iran and the peoples of Iran were forcibly converted, music and dancing were forbidden. However, the Arabs concentrated their conversions on the urban populations on the great Iranian plateau, and due to Iran's rugged terrain, largely neglected the outlying populations. Today ethnic folk music is not found for the most part in the Central Plateau. That is not to say classical music did not remain. However, among the peasantry (sedentary) around the cities in Central Iran such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd, and Qom, which are located in the very center of Iran, folk music and dancing ire extinct. The other areas of Iran, however, are full to bursting with un¬ tapped folklore which is the culture of real Iran. Here in this album, due to lack of space, are included only a few of the most well-known of Iranian folk songs. This collection can only begin to hint at the beauty and variety of folk music found in Iran. Come let us go to Shaye Cheragh and make an oath Whoever breaks the vow first Will break his back Come let us go to Ghebli Koti and spread the rugs Red and white teapots The stove is full of fire Band 3 \"PACHE LEU\" (Little Lily) The emerald of Iran is the province of Gilan. Gilan is beheld with pride by all Iranians as being the stronghold of real Iran. Set in the green forests of the Elborz, it sets down in shimmering greenery into the Caspian Sea. Here is the area which abounds in beautiful songs and dances and colorful, unique costumes. These songs are sung by my dear friend, Ahmad Ashourpoor, in the Gilaki dialect. Mr. Ashourpoor is one of the foremost performers in music of this region. He is a native of Ghazi district of Bandar Pahlavi on the Caspian Sea and his voice is well known by all of the Gilakis, who call him the \"Nightingale of Gilan\". He is an agri¬ cultural engineer currently residing in Tehran with his wife and two daughters. 1. amu dokhtar bamom ti bar dene're jan, jan ashirfi gttl bihem ti gardens' rejan, jan ishab batnom ti var ja nishtene re'T pache Leli ti khJtar khan bamodmS’ kushtene t€. pache Leli 2. tu Kalaye talir man dar zaminam jan, jan tu ri3renj pust kune\" man dar kaminam jin, jan agar daneste bem_tu bivafa*i, pache Leli ti var bTmbrne ta avval tu ba'i, pSche Leli 3. bushiTkori ki man dilgiraro az tu jan, jan b X fikram ki das vigiram az tu jan, jan , hez'Sr afsus ki mi ghadra nadani, pache Leli h2lo sh_ama marTde'den natani, p^che Leli (Girl) cousin I have come to take you, dear, dear I throw a garland of calendulas around your neck; dear, dear Tonight I sit by your side.

Band II \"KORASHIM\" \"Korashim\" (Where shall we go) is a song from Bandare Pahlavi on the Caspian Sea. 1. ti dila be taved bebishim bekhana itS-kfii nibS ti mar Gedana \" agar ti mar terSy bidine ti amra tera birum kune az khodeshe khana chorus: arashim, urashim, korashim aziz, korashim, kijay korashim ti amra bel bebal dariya kenarashim 2. kuji kori man ti nama nadanam agar ti riama danam tera dukhanam kuji kori man ti nSm rd' bdmlram ti jX hargez natSiiam das vigiram 3. kuji_kj>ri tera badban ftikusham kenare sefid rud saman kunam sham kerHirejefid rud mitavam,bejdre' ita kora ura midil dochare 4. kuji kori chsrr andare malusi agar sad sal bemS fi mi arosi ktrji kori man ti dSre'cien natanam ti jrbehtar d£ man giftan natanam Keep your heart still till we arrive home Don't do anything to let your mother know If your mother sees you with me She would turn you out of her house This way, that way, where shall we go? dear where shall we go, girl, where shall we go?

LITHO Anthony Bijan Shay. Born in Los Angeles, California, October 31, 1936. A graduate of U. C. L. A. in International Relations with a minor in Middle Eastern Studies. B. A. Started learning Persian from friends in 1955. Learned some Persian folk songs and in 1958 was sent by the Iranian Students Asso¬ ciation to represent Iran in a series of programs to acquaint Americans with Persian folk music. He took part in the music and dance pro¬ grams, which were given in several Eastern cities. When the Shah came to the United States in early 1958, he directed a program of Iranian folk arts and was sent that same month to Iran to study in the University of Tehran. While in Iran he appeared many times as a featured folk singer with the Iranian National Radio Orchestras in the Iranian Radio in Tehran, as well, as gave programs in outlying provincial radio sta¬ tions. He also appeared in many concerts with noted Persian per¬ formers. In addition to Persian, he also speaks Spanish, Serbian, Portugese, Italian, Fiench and has a reading knowledge of Arabic. mountains protected them from the countless savage invasions inflict ed on the Iranian nation at the hands of maurading Arabs, Mongols, and other invaders. This song is one of the most typical and well-known of this region and is sung in the Mazaderani Dialect. 1. daste, daste cho mene numze jun ene riSghr^ dast^ \" ba cheshme^ siah nokone negah \" \" \" \" 2. sad bar goftam, hamchin makon zolfe siah por chin makon ^ _ ay r'ana, ay delkhah, ay ziba jan 3. sare rahat gol berizam khanjar bSrad, bar nakhizam ay r'ana, ay delkhah, ay ziba jan I would like to dedicate this to the people of Iran, whom I dearly love. In my collection I was aided a great deal by Mr. Ahmad Ashoupoor and Mr. Manouchehr Javid, both of whom checked my translations. Also I would like to thank Dr. Ali Amini, former Ambassador to the United States, who was instrumental in having me sent to Iran and who was a constant friend and guide to me during my stay there.

The Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group, even those residing in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. The Kurdish language is actually a dialect of Farsi, the official language of Iran ana that spoken by the inhabitants of the Iranian Plateau. Kurdestan is a mountainous area and the people, many of them tribesman, are a fiercely loyal group. They belong to the Sunni (Orthodox) sect of Islam which differs from the rest of the Iranians, who are adherents to the Shi 'eh sect of Islam, which is the state religion. Unlike the Shi’eh sect, the Sunnis have never been parti¬ cularly violently opposed to music and therefore Kurdestan is today a treasury of folk music and dance. The Kurds still wear their very unique native costumes. The reference to fire in the song dates back to pre -Islamic Iran when under the Zorastrian faith fire was revered as a symbol of sacredness. 1, tarsam bemiram, nakonam kamrani har ah bekisham, peye no javani chorus: damkol o damkol, damkol damkol, damkol chaow siah 2. se^ dasom begirbezan to diram bachwa monajat balkam namiram SIDE I Band 1 chorus: 3. dayeke7 pir kam tania” man darwa agar man bemiram, 3gar mawarwa VARSAGHI OR NUMZE JUN \"Numze Jun\" (Dear Betrothed) is a. song which is known through¬ out the region of Mazanderan and the province which joins it to the east, Khorasan. Mazanderan is the province which extends over the south-eastern shore of the Caspian Sea and forested by a myriad variety of fruits and nuts, which includes the only wild pomegranate forest in the world. The People, a good portion of them fair, are like their neighbors to the west, the Gilakis, more ethnically pure Persian than those inhabiting the great Iranian Plateau because the towering Elborz (I) fear (I) shall die and never attain happiness Always I sigh for a fresh youth Damkol of the black eyes Take hold of my hand and put it over my heart Go pray for me and perhaps I will no die My old mother has only me If I die, fire will rain. 2 Band 3 RAGHSE CHUBI \"Raghse Chubi\" (stick dance) is a dance of the rugged Bakhtiari tribe. This tribe received international attention after the film \"Grass\", which depicts the tribe's annual migration to the mountains, was released. Prior to these migrations the tribes gather together and this is one of the many dances performed. It is a men's dance in which the dancers, armed with sticks attempt to crack the shins of their fellow dancers. Band [(. 2. az blme7 boland nayofti, avare shavi shuyat^bdmire, begnam gereftSr shavi janane nakon ho la 7 la, janan^ nalcon 3. an bam labe darakhte na'al bandSne7 ashegh b6miane kTTch& sar gardan^ janane nakott ho la la, janand' nakon That high roof which you see if my roof (here roof means an ivory tower) That white veil which you see is my lover Don't do that dear, Don't do that GOLE GHUCHANI \"Gole Ghuchani\" (Flower of Ghuchan) is a dance done with handkerchiefs and comes from the region of Ghuchan in the north¬ eastern province of Khorasan. Also known as \"Rashid Khan\", this dance is also a famous song which tells of Rashid Khan, a legendary Robin Hood. If you listen closely, you can hear the sound of night¬ ingales, for which Iran is famous. Don't fall from the high roof (ivory tower) or you will become a vagabond Your husband will die and you will be overcome by grief That roof is near the tree where they shoe horses My love is wandering in the lane Band DANE NAR Band 2a, 2b \"Dane Nar\" (a pomegranate seed) is a folk song from Khorasan, near the town of Gorgan, and is particularly melodic. The reference to seed of the pomegranate is to the bosom of the beloved. It is common in Persian lyrics to compare a youth to the moon and in this song this comparison is a play on words. 1. shabe mahtab bubo mahtab bobube, shabe_mahtab o nomzad dare'khube Khoda tarik o mahi beresane' k£ tarik, mah o ashegh dare' khube chorus: hamdam yar nemiaiom, dane nar nemiaiom t3 na busom labe g51e yare khod delom begharar nemiaiom 2. setare dar kenare jolgebegirom sar^ zolf£ tora dar mah begirom sar£ zolfejora dar noghreye khub toraz£ khodegi darman begirom A moonlit night and the moon (girl) is shining Having a betrothed on a moonlet night is nice O Goa send the darkness and the moon that the darkness, the moon, and being in love is nice (My) lover I will not come \" pomegranate seed I will not come Until I kiss the rose -like lips of my loved one My heart will not be at peace I observe a star at the edge of the steppe I observe your hair in the moonlight I frame your hair in beautiful silver your love balances my sanity (of being in love) SIDE II Band 1 BAME BOLAND \"Bame Boland\" (the High rooftop) is a famous folk song from the very charming and famous city of wine, roses, and poets, Shiraz. Shiraz is the capital of Fars, the center of Persian Culture and Em¬ pires. Not far from this city of enchanting gardens and turqoise domes lie the fabulous ruins of Persepolis, mighty evidence of Persia's glorious past. The people of Shiraz are famous for their hospitality and sense of humor. Their kindness and tenderness are reflected in the three songs which follow. 1. An bame boland ke mibini, bame m one\" ho la la f- gfiador sefid ke mibini, yare mone ho la la janane' nakon ho la la\". jarnan6 nakon AY SAR KOTAL \"Ay sar Kotal\" (at the top of the hill) and \"Massom, Massom” (I'm drunk, I'm drunk with love) are from the Mamsami tribe, part of the larger tribal grouping the Khamse (five), live near Shiraz. Massom, Massom is perhaps the most popular Persian folk song and has been made into a popular song in Arabic, Turkish, Urdu and English, which was used in the film \"Zarak Khan\" and called \"Climb the Wall\". a 1. ay sar kotal, pa 'in kotal v£y dodar ordu diare ay ria'i gol, gol na'i gol vay dodar homadi mumurdom 2. ayjole'gole' afshun kerd o raft mara parisbun kerd o raft jay<f digar 5sh£ha shSd jaye^ma\" vel kerd o gozasht oraft At the top of the hill, at the bottom of the hill Oh the girl is at the campsite Oh my flower, my flower Oh the girl didn't come and I died Oh the flower blossomed and left She made us unhappy and left She became acquainted elsewhere She left us and passed and went away b 1. yek gole saye kamar, s^ye kamar taze shekofte^ taze shekofte na dassCm besh mirese, besh mirese na khosh mioft^, na khSsh miofte^ chorus: massom, massom, massom tighat boride shasom 2. bioberim sh^y/cheragh, sbaye^Qheragh ahdi bebandim, ahdi oebandim har kodtrm ahd bfshkanim, ahd beshkanim kamar nabandim, kamar nabandim chorus: 3. bi5 berim ghebli koti, ehebli koti ghali konim far$h, gh£U konim farsh ghurihSye sSfkh & sefid, sTTrkh o sefid manghal^por tash, manghale por tash A flower in the shade of a mountain freshly blossomed My hand cannot reach it Nor can it bend down to me I’m drunk Your thorn pierces my thumb 3 FOLKWAYS Records AND SERVICE CORP„ 117 W. 46 St., N.
