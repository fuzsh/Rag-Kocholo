        "text": "DOWNTON Abbey’s Phyllis Logan wishes she had traded places with her Pirates Of The Caribbean hubby — so she could have played Johnny Depp’s pirate GRANNY.\n\nThe Scots actress, loved by millions as stern housekeeper Mrs Hughes from the ITV period drama, is married to Bristol-born actor Kevin McNally.\n\nHe starred as sailor Joshamee Gibbs alongside Depp’s Captain Jack Sparrow in all\n\nFIVE of the big-budget Pirate films.\n\nBut Kevin, 64, also popped up in Downton Abbey back in 2012 as miserable misogynist Horace Bryant.\n\nPhyllis said: “It would have been lovely to have done one of the Pirate movies, because my husband queered my pitch by being in Downton Abbey for a few episodes.\n\n“I said to him at the time, ‘I don’t come on your Pirate movies and step on your toes.’\n\n“But that really would have been lovely. I would have done any part they gave me — even play Johnny Depp’s old granny.”\n\nPaisley-born Phyllis is currently in lockdown in London with Kevin and their 24-year-old musician son David.\n\nShe’s been keeping busy recording voiceovers for the current 5Select show The Highland Vet — although admits she’s been having a few technical difficulties.\n\nThe 64-year-old said: “I haven’t actually finished my narrations yet. I did the first two in a nice recording studio in London but now I’m doing them upstairs in the study.\n\n“So my husband has been my sound engineer because I’ve not been particularly competent in that department.\n\n“He sets up the mic, plugs it in and sends off the memory stick after it’s done.\n\n“But they sent me this microphone that actually rests on your top lip so I felt like I was commentating on the Grand National.\n\n“For quite a few episodes I was narrating the show like that, which sounded quite peculiar. So it will be interesting to hear how it sounds between the first two pre-lockdown episodes and the rest.”\n\nThe actress also recently provided the voice of Paddington’s housekeeper Mrs Bird — made famous by Julie Walters in the hit films — for a new animated series on Nick Jnr.\n\nShe said: “I think the makers had Mrs Hughes in mind when they hired me, but Paddington is so sweet.\n\n“It was a great coup when they managed to get Ben Whishaw for the series, who, of course, was the voice of Paddington in the movies.”\n\nPhyllis has also been helping to promote Dementia UK’s new campaign Lives on Hold — which aims to shine a spotlight on the lockdown which dementia carers face on an ongoing basis, not just during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe says: “When this lockdown ends people will go back to getting a pedicure or going to the pub, but for them it will be just more of the same.\n\n“With Dementia UK we’re trying to promote the Admiral Nurses who help take away that sense of\n\nisolation.\n\n“The more of them we get the better because there are around 700,000 people caring for people with dementia.”\n\nIronically, her character Mrs Hughes lived through the last pandemic when Spanish Flu killed an estimated 50million people in 1918. It also featured as a major plotline in the hit show.\n\nAnd she believes that the no-nonsense housekeeper — who made her big screen debut last year in the movie version of Downton Abbey alongside Jim Carter as her head butler hubby Mr Carson — would take any lockdown in her stride.\n\nLord of the Rings TV series posts bizarre casting call for ‘funky and unusual’ looking people to be extras\n\nPhyllis laughed: “Mrs Hughes would be doing exactly what I’m not doing, which is going through her house like a blow torch and sorting everything out.\n\n“She would be throwing out rubbish and getting everything sorted. I wish I could have the same impetus.\n\n“At the start of the lockdown I was clearing up the house, clearing bookcases and dusting like a mad thing, and now it’s like, ‘I can do it tomorrow’ — and then tomorrow never comes.”\n\nBefore her iconic role in the global hit, the Scot landed her first major showbiz break as Lady Jane Felsham in the BBC1 series Lovejoy, along with Ian McShane, which ran from 1986 until 1994.\n\nBut she fears she is part of a dwindling band of stars from the show, after the deaths of Dudley Sutton, who played Tinker, and Malcolm Tierney, who portrayed Charlie Gimbert.\n\nShe said: “I loved that show as we laughed like drains the whole time. Sadly, Dudley is no longer with us and Malcolm died several years ago. So it’s just me, Chris Jury and Ian McShane left.\n\n“I met Ian a few years back at Venice Beach, California. He lives there and said, ‘Come and see Gwen’ his wife, so we visited him at his lovely penthouse apartment. It was just really nice to see him again.\n\n“And, of course, my husband worked with him on Pirates so I’d seen him then too. A few years go by and then we come across each other again.”\n\nBut as well as wanting to be in a swashbuckling pirate flick, Phyllis also longs to play it for laughs.\n\nShe said: “It would be lovely to do a farce. Something funny. A real comedy. The closest was a Kay Mellor thing a couple of years ago called Girlfriends on ITV, which had its humorous moments, so a bit more of that would be nice.\n\n“I do like a good laugh but the parts I do are not such a good laugh.\n\n“So I’m going to have to sort that one out.”\n\nBut did she ever forgive hubby Kevin for trespassing on her Downton patch?\n\nShe fumed: “I was miffed when they didn’t tell me they were offering him a part.\n\n“But it was actually great fun. We got to travel to the set together and, as I said to him, it was like Bring Your Husband To Work Day.”\n\nTo find out more about the support offered for dementia carers visit Dementia UK.\n\nmatt.bendoris@the-sun.co.uk"
