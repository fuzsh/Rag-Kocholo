        "text": "Sitcom star Kevin McNally has confessed he’d follow Scots star Phyllis Logan to the end of the earth … and beyond. The actress helped him rebuild his shattered life after a bitter break- up from lover Stevie Harris. Now Kevin is so desperate to be with Phyllis he’s willing to dress as an ALIEN and follow her into outer space. Kevin, 41, explained: “Phyllis is an air squadron leader in a sci-fi thriller called Invasion Earth. “She looks fab in the uniform and I’ve told her to start wearing it around the house. “I’m pestering the producers for a part - I’ll play anything, even a little green man!” Kevin confessed he’s never looked back since meeting Phyllis as he tried to drown his sorrows in a beer glass. He said: “I was the worse for wear that night, but Phyllis indulged me by letting me pour out my troubles. “For my part, I was knocked out by her right away. “She’s amazing - so sane, calm and thoughtful.” The couple now have a 15 -month-old son, David. Kevin also has a 15-year-old son, Peter, from his previous relationship and he revealed how he’d begun analysing his relationship with his sons since landing the lead role in new BBC sitcom Dad. The series revolves around the relationship between Alan (Kevin), his dad (George Cole) and his teenage son Vincent. The lad ridicules his old man for things which are “dadist”, such as lawn- mowers, talcum powder and Top Of The Pops. And Alan dreads visits to see his father because they almost always involve Spam sandwiches and excursions to the scrapyard. Kevin said: “My dad watched the series being made and he had a wry smile on his face as he saw me struggling to cope with Vincent. “He says grandchildren are the grandparents’ revenge and he’s right. “For every fortysomething father there comes a moment of truth when he blasts and fumes about his son using the house as a hotel … then he remembers his own dad doing the same to him. “I think that because I’m an actor and my life isn’t routine, I must be a fun dad - but I know Peter thinks I’m boring because he tells me all the time. “My taste in music hasn’t changed since my teens - dreadfully serious progressive stuff like King Crimson and Van Der Graaf Generator - so maybe he has a point!”"
