        "text": "Pirates of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally was arrested on February 16 for domestic abuse and is due in court next month, LA Police Department have confirmed to Metro.co.uk.\n\nThe 67-year-old actor, who played Joshamee Gibbs in the film series, was said to have been set to attend the world’s biggest Doctor Who convention in Los Angeles but was detained the day before.\n\nMcNally, who is married to Downtown Abbey star Phyllis Logan, has been released on bond and is due in court on March 15.\n\nIn a statement to Metro.co.uk, LAPD said: Kevin McNally was arrested on 02/16/24, at 3:00 a.m., for 273.5(a) PC – Domestic Abuse. He was released on bond and has a court date of 03/15/24.’\n\nThe Sun reported he was released for the sum of £40,000. The outlet added that his wife denied knowing about the arrest, and it is not clear who the alleged victim is.\n\nThe actor also appeared in Downtown Abbey as Horace Bryant alongside Phyllis, who played Mrs Hughes.\n\nLA police told The Sun the actor was being held on suspicion of inflicting an injury that caused a traumatic condition on a victim who was his current or former spouse, cohabitant, or child’s parent.\n\nIn 2021, McNally defended co-star Johnny Depp as he was standing trial against Amber Heard, accused physically abusing her.\n\n‘I’ve never seen a hint of any dark side to Johnny,’ he told The Express.\n\n‘I see a great humanitarian and a beautiful human being. I don’t see any impediment for him coming back and playing Jack Sparrow.’\n\nAlthough McNally is best-known for starring in the nautical film series, he’s appeared in a swathe of other TV and films.\n\nHe played Professor Jericho in Doctor Who, Margaret Thatcher’s chief press secretary Bernard Ingham in five episodes of The Crown and in ITV detective drama Unforgotten as James Hollis.\n\nPhyllis – also star of Shetland, Doctor Who, and Silent Witness – met McNally in 1994 on the set of mini-series Love and Reason.\n\nThey went on to marry in 2011, welcoming a son called David in 1996, and settling in Chiswick, London.\n\nTalking about her husband taking up the role of Horace Bryant in period drama Downtown Abbey, Phyllis told The Express in 2014: ‘No one told me it was going to happen and when Kevin said he’d got a part in Downton, I thought he was winding me up,”\n\n‘I kept asking him, “No, what are you really doing?” When I realised it was true, I was a bit miffed that he hadn’t asked me first, but I liked having him around and I’d love to work with him again.\n\n‘He played the dour grandfather of housemaid Ethel Parks’ baby, born out of wedlock. Mrs Hughes was very protective of Ethel, who was played by lovely Amy Nuttall, so I was in all his scenes and we both enjoyed that.’\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Kevin McNally’s representative for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Pirates of the Caribbean and Men in Black star Sergio Calderón dies aged 77"
