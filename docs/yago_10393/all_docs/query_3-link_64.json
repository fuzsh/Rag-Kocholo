        "text": "Carson, fetch his Lordship’s Sunday evening snifter! Oh, and Lady Cora’s handkerchiefs. We shall be needing lots and lots of freshly laundered handkerchiefs!\n\nAppointment television is back to offset the chill of autumn, but the must-watch series of the season will be shot through with a bittersweet note of nostalgia.\n\nAs the opening credits roll on the sixth and final installment of Downton Abbey, viewers will be forgiven for dabbing their eyes as they witness the close of a chapter, both on and off screen.\n\nReports have already emerged of weeping actors and sobbing crew breaking down as filming finished on the phenomenally successful costume drama.\n\nLaura Carmichael, better known as Lady Edith, has confessed that stiff upper lips wobbled uncontrollably upstairs in the drawing room of Highclere Castle, the Hampshire pile that doubles as the seat of the fictional Earl of Grantham.\n\nDownstairs in the servants' quarters, a faithfully-recreated set at Ealing Studios, the anguish was even more palpable.\n\n“The last scene we had was in the servants’ hall,” says Phyllis Logan, the Scots actress who plays the redoubtable yet fair-minded housekeeper Mrs Hughes.\n\n“It’s traditional when you finish a job that you get clapped off with the words 'That was so-and-so’s last scene’, but because eight of us were finishing, there was this really long roll call.”\n\nAfter the producer came on, said a few words and handed out bouquets and bottles, Jim Carter, aka Mr Carson, the butler, stood up to express the cast's thanks to the crew, many of whom had been working on the programme since its inception in 2010.\n\n“As he spoke, Jim saw a few of the crew were crying and that set him off, croaking and filling up,” laughs Logan, 59.\n\n“Because Jim’s not one for histrionics, we all looked at one another and thought: 'If Jim’s gone, there’s no hope for the rest of us' – and that was it.”\n\nLogan, who had developed a warm friendship with Lesley Nicol (Mrs Patmore, the cook) and Sophie McShera (Daisy, promoted from kitchen maid to assistant cook), found their goodbyes particularly emotional.\n\n“All three of us stood at the foot of the stairs in a group hug, sobbing heavily and howling into each other’s necks,” she chuckles. “It was quite cathartic, really.”\n\nCatharsis, albeit of a terribly English sort, will be much in evidence in this series. Downton Abbey greator and indefatigable writer, Julian Fellowes, has promised that the show will go out on a high, with a dizzying whirl of cliffhangers and plot twists, romances and comeuppances, but above all with a sense of resolution.\n\n“Being Julian, he likes to throw a curve ball,” says Logan, whose previous major role was posh totty Lady Jane Felsham in the long-running series Lovejoy.\n\n“Yes, loose ends are tied up, but not in the way the audience might expect. There’s a sense that the characters will go on in their lives once the credits roll, which is a very clever way to close the series.”\n\nReinvention is in the air, although adapting to a new way of life will be easier for some than for others. For “Granny”, Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by the inimitable Dame Maggie Smith, who once so memorably asked “What is a weekend?”, it looks nigh on impossible.\n\nWhen Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson got engaged at the end of season five, it seemed like a perfect match. Yet as we pick up on their rather formal courtship, it transpires that certain sensitive difficulties have arisen.\n\n“Mrs Hughes is concerned about whether Mr Carson wishes to have a 'full’ marriage, in the physical sense,” says Logan. “She’s as anxious as any woman would be who had reached a certain age and never been in that situation before.\n\n“In this day and age, people don’t realise that 'Mrs' is a title given to women at a certain rank in a household; it doesn’t mean she was previously married.”\n\nThat, of course, puts a whole new complexion in the matter, but Logan admits to relishing the intense dialogue with Carter.\n\n“Because of the ensemble nature of Downton, normally we only have a few lines each, so it was wonderful to sink our teeth into more intimate scenes,” she says. “Julian writes so well and drew every character so precisely right from the very start, that it’s just a case of playing the lines and bringing as much depth to them as you can,\n\nIt is arguable whether British or American viewers will feel more bereft as the proverbial sun sets on Downton.\n\nHigh profile fans include the Duchess of Cambridge, who vastly overran her schedule because she was so enthusiastically chatting to the actors during a visit and Michelle Obama, who sent the cast a special message, when they dined at the American Embassy for Thanksgiving.\n\n“When Americans take you to their hearts, they really do,” says Logan. “Over there, you can get candies printed with a picture of the cast member, it’s a bit mad; the reception we get is so effusive I find myself saying 'I’m in a TV show, I haven’t saved the world.’\n\n“I even ran into a woman who told me she and her other half get dressed up as Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson and role play. She showed me her tattoo of Mrs Hughes’ keys.”\n\nIn Britain, audiences averaged 11 million viewers, making it the highest rating drama of the past decade on any channel.\n\n'I ran into a woman who told me she and her other half get dressed up as Mrs Hughes and Mr Carson - and role play'\n\nPhyllis Logan, Downton Abbey actress\n\nIn the U.S, 25.5 million tuned into the final episode of the last series and overall it has garnered 11 Emmys, three Golden Globes and a Bafta Special Award in recognition of its global success.\n\n“It was wonderful having Downton because it was such regular work,” says Logan. “Now it’s over, I feel a mixture of excitement and trepidation. I’m in no rush to hunt for a job, so I shall wait and see what turns up.”\n\nLogan, who lives in Chiswick, south-west London, is married to the actor Kevin McNally, 59, best known for starring in all four Pirates of the Caribbean film.\n\nThe couple have a 19-year-old son, David, who is about to start a university course in music and technology.\n\n“He hasn’t come out and said he wants to be Kurt Cobain, but he wants to make music his life,” says Logan with maternal fondness.\n\n“When he was a newborn, I remember holding him in my arms and wishing two things for him; compassion and a passion. He has both, so I feel sort of all right about waving him off to follow his ambitions.”\n\nLogan’s own ambitions are, to say the least, eclectic. She would like to appear in a “wacky Feydeau farce”, combining technical challenge with off-the-wall madness.\n\n• How well do you know Downton Abbey? Take this quiz to find out\n\n“My name would have to go first, because I was the housekeeper, so that makes me in charge obviously,” she chuckles. “We could be Padmore and Hughes. No actually, Elsie and Beryl, which were our first names. But I would have to be the boss.”\n\nWho even knew they had first names? After so many years immersed in Downton, it’s little wonder that hierarchies might persist, but sadness is a great leveller and come this evening, the beginning of the end will be nigh.\n\nLogan is sympathetic to viewers at home, but offers a moment of levity to dissipate the gloom.\n\n“We had a party to mark the end of the show and requested the DJ play Sexual 'Ealing, to commemorate our time at the studio,” she says, wistfully.\n\n“I did a lot of dirty dancing with Allen Leech. Yes, imagine it; Mrs Hughes and Branson, getting it on to the sounds of Marvin Gaye.”\n\nProof, if proof were needed, that an era has well and truly ended. Someone shield Granny’s eyes."
