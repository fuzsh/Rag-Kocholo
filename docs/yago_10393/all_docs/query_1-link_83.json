        "text": "LONDON voice actor and three-times cancer survivor Brad Shaw is calling in 174 voice actors and celebrities to raise thousands of pounds for Cancer Research UK.\n\nThey have each recorded a minute of Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass’ for an audiobook that will be released one chapter at a time as a series of podcasts during December.\n\nAmong those taking part this year are Phyllis Logan, Downton Abbey’s head housekeeper Mrs Hughes, and Pirates of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally.\n\nBrad, 59, from Chiswick, was diagnosed with stage three malignant melanoma in June 2019. After a year of immunotherapy treatment, he was clear of cancer for two years. But in January last year, he needed treatment for prostate cancer and had a pioneering operation using high intensity focused ultrasound which aims to kill cancer cells with high frequency sound waves.\n\nAnd then, in April this year, the skin cancer returned, and he needed further treatment to remove lymph glands.\n\nFollowing his first diagnosis when the world was in lockdown, Brad came up with the idea of ‘The Wonderland Challenge’, inviting fellow actors to record an audiobook of ‘Alice in Wonderland’ to raise money for the NHS. Among those taking part were actors Michael Palin, Dame Juliet Stevenson, Ruth Jones and Dame Harriet Walter.\n\nNow, nearly three years later, Brad is about to launch The Wonderland Challenge 2 – ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass’ audiobook – to raise money for Cancer Research UK.\n\nBrad, who runs a voiceover training community called WonderlandVO, said: “I’ve had cancer three times now but I’m alive and cancer free! So, I decided to do the Wonderland project again as my way of saying thank you, for the treatment I’ve had and to everyone who has helped save my life – three times!\n\n“This time I have split the book into 174 one-minute chunks with each actor, voice actor or celebrity recording one minute each and donating at least £10 to Cancer Research UK.”\n\nPhyllis Logan said she’d enjoyed being part of the Wonderland team: “It’s been a great privilege to be involved with this wonderful project and to know it has raised money for Cancer Research UK – a cause which is close to everyone’s heart, I’m sure. Bravo Brad for your time and commitment!”\n\nKevin McNally added: “It’s such a pleasure to be part of this wonderfully entertaining fundraiser again. Well Done Brad!”\n\nDonations have already reached £4,660 and Brad is hoping there is much more to come when the first chapter of the audiobook is released as a podcast on December 4th. A further chapter will be released every two days until December 22nd.\n\nEvery year, around 36,500 people are diagnosed with cancer in London*\n\nCadena Sampson, Relationship Executive for Cancer Research UK, said: “We’re delighted Brad and is putting all this time and energy into the Wonderland 2 project to raise money for Cancer Research UK. As someone who has received treatment, Brad is well aware of the need for further research and better and kinder treatments for all types of cancer.\n\n“We’re really grateful for his support and that of all his fellow actors and voice actors who are taking part too. It is our supporters who will help us make those desperately-needed breakthroughs in the future.”\n\nSome of the actors taking part have posted about the challenge on Facebook:"
