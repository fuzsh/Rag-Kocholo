        "text": "Downton Abbey Series 5- Jim Carter & Phyllis Logan Interview\n\nWhen you’re centre stage in a popular TV drama, you expect to get recognised. But some encounters are stranger than others, as Phyllis Logan – aka Downton Abbey’s formidable housekeeper Mrs Hughes – can attest.\n\n“I was in Atlanta, Georgia, with my husband [that’s Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally] and I was having breakfast in our hotel when this soft-spoken woman came over. ‘Excuse me,’ she said. ‘Phyllis Logan?’\n\n“Now, it’s lovely to meet Downton viewers, but this lady was such a fan that she’d had Mrs Hughes’ household keys tattooed on to her hip – and she showed me. But then she said that at night, she dresses as ‘Mistress Hughes’ in leather, with a whip. She had her own X-rated version of Downton Abbey going on!”\n\nIt’s lovely to meet viewers, but this lady was such a fan that she’d had Mrs Hughes’ keys tattooed on to her hip\n\nPhyllis Logan\n\nMrs Hughes would not be amused but Phyllis, a bubbly, smiley Scot with a wicked sense of humour, thinks that’s hilarious. Downton returns next year but first there’s a Christmas special to look forward to, in which carols are sung while Anna remains behind bars, Bates is distraught and the Dowager Countess is considering her future with her Russian suitor.\n\nPhyllis will be watching at home in west London with Kevin and their son David, 18. “I know what’s going to happen but I still enjoy it,” she says. “I watch it and I get caught up in the story like everyone else, especially during the scenes I’m not appearing in.”\n\nThe actress, 58, will re-join her colleagues to start filming the next series in February. “Thank God for that – I’ve been banking on it!” she laughs. “I spend long days wearing a corset – but no pain, no gain. I’d do it in three corsets rather than stop, and returning to the set is always like coming back after the school holidays and seeing what everyone’s been up to.\n\n“I usually hang out with Jim Carter [Carson] and Lesley Nicol [Mrs Patmore] between scenes.\n\nWe go into each other’s dressing room and natter about what’s going on with our families, or we do crosswords together. Lesley lives near me, so we see each other when we’re not filming, but I love the young actresses, too. I’ll sometimes give them boyfriend advice, whether they want it or not.”\n\nIn the recent series, there were hints of Mrs Hughes and butler Carson opening a B&B together – but that won’t be happening just yet, Phyllis reassures us. “Everyone’s becoming a property magnate in Downton, aren’t they? Anna and Bates have inherited a place in London from his mother. Mrs Patmore has come into a bit of money and wants to buy a house and Mr Carson, not being a man of great imagination, has jumped on the bandwagon. I love my scenes with Jim – he’s a very funny man and we have such a good time – and we’re not sailing off into the sunset just yet. Unless Julian [writer Julian Fellowes] is planning a spin-off series. Wouldn’t that be fun?”\n\nSomeone else she enjoyed working with – several series ago – was one Kevin McNally. “No one told me it was going to happen and when Kevin said he’d got a part in Downton, I thought he was winding me up,” chuckles Phyllis.\n\n“I kept asking him, ‘No, what are you really doing?’ When I realised it was true, I was a bit miffed that he hadn’t asked me first, but I liked having him around and I’d love to work with him again. He played the dour grandfather of housemaid Ethel Parks’ baby, born out of wedlock. Mrs Hughes was very protective of Ethel, who was played by lovely Amy Nuttall, so I was in all his scenes and we both enjoyed that.”\n\nWorking together was a rare treat for a couple whose busy careers mean they’re often separated.\n\n“We’re used to that,” says Phyllis. “We try to make sure we don’t stay apart for more than seven or eight weeks at a time and we phone, text and Skype every day. When Kevin’s not around, I do miss talking to him. We’re such good mates and I tell him more than I tell anyone else. We’re quite different, though – he’s more tidy than me.\n\n“He’s working on a film just now and he’ll be back about five minutes before Christmas, just long enough to do a spot of Christmas shopping – something else he’s better at than me.\n\nI don’t want much but I’m hoping he’ll buy me a really nice new winter coat. Then we’ll spend Christmas at home with our son.”\n\nIn the new year, Kevin will be returning to the role of Joshamee Gibbs in a new Pirates of the Caribbean film with Johnny Depp, while Phyllis begins the next series of Downton Abbey.\n\n“When Kevin does Pirates, I usually go with him,” says Phyllis, with a tinge of regret. “We’ve been to the Bahamas and Hawaii, but it won’t happen this time because I’ll be busy. I will go to the premiere with him though. The Pirates films are always premiered at Disneyland, where there’s no alcohol allowed in the park.\n\nHow can you have a premiere without champagne, for goodness’ sake? Though all the rides are open and you can get on without queuing, which we do.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nPhyllis has come a long way since moving from Scotland to London in her mid-twenties, with little more than her training and a few local theatre parts behind her. “It felt like I was going to Australia,” she says. “I was very close to my family and knew I’d miss them a great deal.”\n\nIt wasn’t long before the move paid dividends and her career took off – especially once she got the part of Lady Jane Felsham, the aristocratic love interest for Ian McShane’s roguish antiques dealer in Lovejoy. She stayed with the popular comedy drama for eight years – a time she looks back on with great affection.\n\n“I hadn’t seen Ian for ages, but a few years ago he was working on Pirates of the Caribbean with my husband when I flew out there to visit. He saw me and came over, still wearing all his pirate gear, and we gave each other a huge hug. It’s hard to keep friendships going in our business because we go in different directions as each new job comes along, but I still think of Ian fondly and I’m sure he thinks the same of me.”\n\nSince those days, Phyllis has worked consistently, popping up in such prime-time favourites as New Tricks, Silent Witness and A Touch of Frost. But the part she is probably proudest of is as Timothy Spall’s wife in the multi-award-winning 1996 Mike Leigh film Secrets and Lies.\n\n“Being directed by Mike is an intense but fabulous experience,” she says. “The script was largely improvised, which was hard.\n\nIt’s not like going down a mine to earn a living, but it’s very challenging. Some days it was fine. Others, I lost inspiration and just threw myself into the character to keep it bubbling along, though it was worth every second of the torture. And Tim Spall is one of the all-time greats. He’s also completely irreverent and filthy, and you can have a great giggle with him.”\n\nApart from acting, Phyllis’s other passion is her support for Dementia UK, which provides specialist nurses for dementia patients and their families. “It’s a cause close to my heart,” she says. “My mother had a cognitive impairment and my mother–in-law had Alzheimer’s. My father-in-law told me he felt like jumping off a fifth-floor balcony because all the history he and his wife had shared just disappeared. They’d had such a lovely marriage until that time, but you never know what’s lurking there for you. I often forget what I’ve gone upstairs for, but I’ve been like that for years. There’s no change there.”\n\nAs for her son, young David has decided against following his parents into acting. “He wants to be a musician and he’s very talented,” says Phyllis proudly. “He’s on a gap year just now, but next year he’s studying music at university.\n\n“I have a lot to be thankful for this Christmas. I have a wonderful family and a job I love. Not everyone can say that, can they?”\n\nThe Downton Abbey special is on Christmas Day on ITV.\n\nPhotographs: Clive Shallice / hair and Make-up: Jen Fechter using LancÔme and L’orÉal Professionnel / Styling: Paula O’Connor / Jumpsuit, £175, Almost Famous (020 7637 2622, aflondon.com); stilettos, £79, Dune (0333 240 7306, dune.co.uk); necklace, £22.50, Freedom at Topshop (0344 984 0264, topshop.com)"
