        "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Despite 36 years in show business, it seems that actress Phyllis Logan has never quite escaped domestic service. Her first paying role was that of a maid, for which she earned 37 pounds.\n\nHere she is again, as the starchy Mrs. Hughes in service at \"Downton Abbey, which returns for its new season on PBS Jan. 5.\n\nWhen Logan first read the part, she thought she'd have to assume a strange English accent. After all, as Mrs. Hughes is the senior housekeeper of the estate, and all the \"downstairs\" people come from the blue-collar area of northern England.\n\nBut Logan is a Scot with a thick Scottish brogue, rolling her R's and stretching out her vowels. And a revolutionary thought occurred to her: Why not make Mrs. Hughes a Scot?\n\n\"So I read the part and looked at the scenes and I thought, 'Oh, this would also work quite well as a Scottish character,\" she says, looking nothing like Mrs. Hughes in gray chiffon with sequins and extinguishing an electronic cigarette.\n\n\"So when I was there I went in and spoke to (the producer) and he said, 'Oh, you've got such a nice accent, maybe we should try Mrs. Hughes as Scottish.' I said, 'Well, funnily enough that you should say that, I was going through and thinking that the syntax of what she said, the type of person she was -- I thought this could really work as a Scottish woman.' They were delighted and said, 'Yes, that's fine.' \"\n\nWhile she may be deft with serving trays and choosing the proper linen, her first meaty role was that of a lady of England's aristocracy in the detective series \"Lovejoy\" with Ian McShane. That followed with roles in almost every popular British crime series there is, including \"Wallander,\" Mike Leigh's \"Secrets & Lies,\" and, of course, \"Downton Abbey.\"\n\nThough she participated in school plays and joined the film club as a teen, the idea of acting for a living never occurred to her until a friend suggested she try out for drama school.\n\n\"Because I came from a small town outside Glasgow, nobody from my school had ever gone into the acting profession. It was just something you didn't do,\" she said. \"You joined the bank or became a teacher or whatever you did. I suggested it to my careers adviser, who said, basically, 'Why would you want to do that, you'll never get the grades?' He was talking about being a drama teacher and that's not what I was talking about.\"\n\nShe ignored him, sent for a prospectus to drama school in Glasgow, and auditioned her way in. Her parents thought she was a bit loony, she said.\n\n\"Not so my mum, but I think my dad just thought, 'That's not a job.' Sadly, my father died before I graduated, so he didn't see any of the success at all. And my mum, bless her, who just died two years ago, she was very happy. I think she was proud of me.\"\n\nLogan's Scottish accent first intruded when she was studying drama. \"We were always told we had to get rid of our Scottish accent. You need to start off with what they call RP -- Received Pronunciation, that's what they do on the BBC. ... I didn't really buy that idea at all. So when I first did 'Lovejoy' and was playing a very upper-class lady, I went to the interview and spoke like that and they gave me the part and I thought, 'When am I going to break it to them that THIS is how I sound?' \"\n\nExcept for a very brief stint working for tips as a hat-check girl, Logan has never had another job, nor has she ever wanted to quit acting. \"It's true as a woman particularly, the older you get the parts get thinner on the ground and not quite as interesting, that's for sure,\" she sighs.\n\n\"People are trying and I think maybe the industry is waking up to the fact that women can be funny in comedies and can be in hit films.\"\n\nThe death of her father when she was 20 affected her profoundly early in her career, she said. \"He was only 59 and I hadn't even graduated, and my sister had only just left university. My brother was out in the world. But it was a terrible time, actually. I often think, I wonder what would've happened if my dad had survived. It's a bit like 'Sliding Doors,' you don't know how much your path would've shifted. I just don't know. But I often wonder if there would've been a different shift. It affected us all, and my mother was widowed longer than she was married.\"\n\nWed to actor Kevin McNally (\"The Pirates of the Caribbean\" series), Logan said she never intended to marry an actor, and they took their time about it. \"I'm the first to say I would never have had one in the house,\" she said. \"But you can't legislate love. We've been together for 20 years. We met on a job, some television thing years ago. But we didn't really get together on the job, at all. We'd known each other, but I thought he was a bit of an arrogant twit, but there's so much more to him,\" she said smiling.\n\nThey have a 17-year-old son, David. Motherhood at 40 changed her, she said. \"When somebody's calling you mommy it's a wonderful thing. But also to have that responsibility and to know that you and your partner have this little thing that's totally relying on you -- and it made me I suppose less selfish. Not that I was mega-selfish to start with, but it's lovely having that responsibility. It's scary. But it's great when you get used to the idea of having that responsibility and having that child that you have unadulterated love for and will do throughout their lives.\"\n\nMore TV News\n\n___\n\nTwo old friends will be shining up your TV screen come Jan. 13 when \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and her latter-day pal, \"Veronica Mars,\" land on Pivot, a TV network that is determined with a vengeance to appeal to 18- to 34-year-olds. Viewers may remember the formidable Buffy and her Watcher as they waded through six seasons of derring do and the blonde Veronica, who attended school by day and solved crimes by night. Geller, who was so unforgettable as Buffy, is back on the tube in a CBS comedy, \"The Crazy Ones,\" with Robin Williams. Geller said she's not afraid to wade into new waters. \"I'm not a really fearful person. I don't live my life in fear. I look forward to challenges. I'm not going on 'Fear Factor' any time soon. I wouldn't put myself in situations like that. I don't like rats. I don't like roaches and spiders. I don't like things most city girls are afraid of.\"\n\n___\n\nIf you're looking for a last-minute Christmas gift and have a TV lover on your list, you couldn't do better than the TimeLife DVD collection of the entire series \"China Beach.\" The set includes 21 discs featuring all 62 episodes and more than 10 hours of brand new bonus features, including a recent cast reunion. The series made a star of Dana Delany, who said she was frightened every day she reported to the set. \"I'd drive to work every day and think, 'I don't know if I can do this.' Then I'd drive home at night, and say, 'Wow, OK, I did it. I got through today and now there's tomorrow.' \"\n\n___\n\nMark Burnett and his \"Angel\" wife Roma Downey surprised everyone when their miniseries, \"The Bible,\" was such a hit on cable. NBC has decided it's time to lead its people out of the wilderness with a sequel to be dubbed \"A.D.\" The 12-hour miniseries probably won't air until the spring of 2015, but then, miracles don't happen in a day. \"You might think the story is over at the Crucifixion, but as most of the world knows, that was only the beginning,\" said Jennifer Salke, president of NBC Entertainment. \"Everyone's lives were completely altered in an instant and the immediate aftermath of Christ's death had an impact on his disciples, his mother and key political and religious leaders of the time. In the first episode alone you see the last moments of the Crucifixion, Judas taking his own life after betraying Christ, Peter denying Jesus three times, and then the miracle of the Resurrection.\"\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services"
