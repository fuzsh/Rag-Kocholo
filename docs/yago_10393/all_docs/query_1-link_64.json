        "text": "TV Presenter Peter Overton interviewed his former next door neighbour Australian actress Nicole Kidman and her Blossom Films partner. Sharing her experience as an Oscar-winning star with her devoted mum Janelle sitting in the front row, the Aussie movie star talked about the power of hard-work, being passionate, kind and forging close relationships with people you work with. Firstly, she said to ‘never give up. Secondly, she describes how she often says yes to projects even if they are difficult and works it out later. Here are some highlights of what Nicole shared with the audience of 2,000 people today at the ICC in Sydney for the SXSW Sydney: Nicole Kidman: Never give up. It can take 20 years and you never give up. You keep going and going and going because you never know when it’s gonna hit. And it’s timing. So something that is rejected now, in five years time, may be the perfect time to make it. So any producers that are out there or writers that are sitting on scripts, you go, okay, it’s here. It may have been turned down now, but that doesn’t mean it’s being turned down tomorrow. And you just don’t give up. And be good to people. Be kind, because what goes around comes around. And so much of this industry is known to be cutthroat and really, really tough. And there can be cruelty. Because they say it’s a business, I don’t treat it as a business, no. This is us all working together because we all love making films and we love television projects, but you never know when that person who you helped out is gonna come back around and go, hey, yep, I can help you now. And those things, it’s the chain. And so just be very, very decent in how you leave something as well. If you are going to leave a job, and I always say this to people, how you leave it is so much more important than how you start it. Partly because that’s what will be remembered and people’s true colours show by the end of a long, arduous, hard production. And so how you leave that production is very, very important. Nicole Kidman’s Instagram Nicole Kidman speaking about Blossom Films Nicole Kidman: We’re very aware and grateful for what we can do. We’d love to have a few more employees. But we’re lean, we’re not a big, We sort of have a very futuristic approach to it. We started very lean, and now I know, and we kind of carry the weight. It’s like a small business where we don’t wanna grow fast because we’re bespoke. But it’s lovely teaming up with other entities and producers and being able to do co-productions together. I’ve done that with Taylor Sheridan, I’ve done it with Made Up Stories, I’ve done it with a number of different people. And so I’ve been able to do that as an actor, but I’ve been now able to do it as a producer. Peter Overton asks Nicole Kidman how you know when to take on a project and whether there is a stress test first. Nicole replied she asks herself if she’d want to have dinner with that person.

Step 3: Do a radio gig and pursue an education career instead. Step 4: Accept a surprise offer to work in local TV news. Step 5: Take a better TV news gig in a bigger market. Step 6: Get demoted because you “aren’t fit for the news” after all. Step 7: Utilize your unique abilities of empathy and storytelling to make the most of your demotion. Step 8: Accept an offer in a bigger market to showcase your unique abilities further in a talk show format. Step 9: Become so good at being uniquely “you” that you take this show from last to first place in ratings. Step 10: Take a call from one of the fans of your show, who happens to be Steven Spielberg, and accept the role he offers you in the film, The Color Purple. --- Of the 160,000+ actors in SAG-AFTRA, the ones who get personal calls from directors like Steven Spielberg make up less than 0.01%. Yet Oprah Winfrey achieved the impossible in only 10 steps. --- We fail to reach our goals NOT because of delays or obstacles... ...But because we unconsciously attach ourselves to the route we think we must take to succeed. But here’s the truth: you have no idea how to reach your goals. You only ASSUME you do based on your own logic and what you’ve seen others experience. “Delay” or “obstacles” only exist in this assumed path of success. But what you think is a delay might actually be accelerating you past the 160,000 others fighting for an opportunity along the traditional route. Delays cannot slow you down without your permission. --- If you're struggling with an undercurrent of anxiety because you think you need to be doing more and going faster, I made this workshop to show you a better way to deal with delays: blakestratton.com/timeeq\n\n\"Franklin\" is a biographical drama miniseries about the United States Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, based on Stacy Schiff's 2005 book \"A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America\".

They lived in a home in the Parisian suburb of Passy, donated by Jacques-Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont, who supported the United States. Franklin remained in France until 1785. He conducted the affairs of his country toward the French nation with great success, which included securing a critical military alliance in 1778 and signing the 1783 Treaty of Paris. \"Franklin\" is the \"Featured Television Blog\" of the month for July, You can expect a detailed critique of the limited series with historical context of Franklin's background.

In the US, a TV series is one hour, once a week, for a 13-week season Each week during production, there’s two complete crews working - one team is prepping while the other team is shooting and the next week, they switch Telenovelas are one hour, 5 nights a week, for a 15-week season When I arrived in San Diego to begin prep on this staggering 75-episode project with a fixed network delivery date, the people already involved were in freak-out mode trying to figure out how to deal with more material than any film ever made And nobody there had the nads to tell the Fox TV executives that it just couldn’t be done because failure before even starting was not an option… What saved the project from hell was our collective confidence in our ability to get shit done using all the skills we’d developed & honed shooting movies and TV shows in the past We hired two people from Columbia experienced in scheduling the massive number of scenes to be shot on telenovelas We created a system for lighting for all the sets to be able to shoot scenes without relighting for each one We reinvented the camera positions to minimize the number of angles necessary to fully cover all the dialog We had equipment manufactured to facilitate multiple cameras shooting different actors at the same time We put the make-up and wardrobe departments adjacent to the set to avoid taking actors to and from trailers Our collective confidence in our abilities allowed us to overcome the challenge of shooting this unprecedented project that Hollywood said couldn’t be done And the point is? Confidence in ourselves is a superpower that allows us to figure out how we can successfully overcome all the challenges we encounter in order to turn the impossible into the possible ******************************************************************************* I’m Jennifer, author and confidence coach helping entrepreneurs and leaders cultivate curiosity, enoughness, and authenticity to catalyze the confidence that redefines and optimizes all their relationships 🌟 #LinkedIn #confidence #personaldevelopment #growthmindset #authenticity #motivationmondays\n\nThe Secret Formula Behind All Continuing Dramatic Series In the vast realm of television, where plot twists and character drama reign supreme, there's a hidden truth that producers desperately hope you won't notice. All continuing dramatic series are essentially telling the same story. Only the people, places and time periods have been changed to maximize the CGI value. Every series introduces us to a main character burdened with a truckload of emotional baggage. Whether it's a traumatic past, a complicated family history, or they're competitive nature that says I can make better drugs than that. We immediately jump into their corner and hope that one day they will achieve that better life they so richly deserve. Next there's what I like to call the bedroom tango. Expect characters to engage in a perplexing dance of romantic entanglements, leaving viewers torn between which couple or group they should cheer for. Now of course there has to be a mysterious element that keeps the audience hooked. A hidden identity, a cryptic prophecy or the fact that you're secretly seeing a psychiatrist because the amount of people whose death you have ordered is really beginning to take its toll on you emotionally. Viewers will stay glued to that screen and even try to warn you if it looks like somebody's going to find out. Also please remember that coming back from the dead is never off the table. No character ever truly dies in the world of continuing dramatic series. Writers have a magical way of bringing characters back from the dead or revealing that they were secretly alive all along. There also usually seems to be an unexpected perk. Something like, a seemingly unimportant character just discovered they were the long lost offspring of a serial killer who deep down inside is trying to use his talents to make the world a better place. Don't forget to look for the two characters who are sworn enemies, but circumstances force them to become unlikely allies. Then they grudgingly join forces, exchanging snarky remarks before developing a deep, unbreakable bond. And the very definition of continuing dramatic series means every season concludes with a cliffhanger that leaves viewers hanging by a thread of suspense. Whether it's a shocking revelation, a major character in peril, or an ominous plot twist, the goal is to ensure that you spend the hiatus desperately theorizing what will happen next. And it doesn't hurt to have a revolving door of villains. Villains come and go like seasonal fashion trends. Just as one is defeated, another swoops in to take their place. It's a never-ending cycle of bad guys with nefarious plans and impeccable timing. So, the next time you find yourself engrossed in the latest hit drama, remember that beneath the glossy exterior, you're likely watching a recycled version of the same age-old story. But hey, who can resist the allure of emotional baggage, love triangles and deep dark secrets? Happy binge-watching!\n\nWhat do sports, TV shows, and movies have in common? One word: Drama. At the end of the day, drama is what drives so much of our entertainment. We humans crave drama. We can’t look away. We often engage and find ourselves sucked into its vortex. The drama is especially seductive when it involves a hero, villain, and victim (this concept comes from Stephen Karpman, M.D. who created something called the Drama Triangle). When those three parties are at play, we take on roles that make us do things we normally wouldn’t. In response, we either rise to the occasion, fall into a trap of helplessness, or turn into a version of ourselves we don’t particularly like. The key isn’t to avoid drama at all costs; the key is to know when we are in its midst and have the self-awareness to label the role we are playing and how it’s contributing to the perpetuation of said drama. While drama may be entertaining, perpetuated drama is highly exhausting. It drains us. In that sense, drama gets in the way of peace. Here is a simple process for how to better handle drama: Step 1: Notice if you are in drama. Step 2: Identify the role you are playing. Step 3: Shift your role. · Shift from hero to coach · Shift from villain to challenger · Shift from victim to creator The coach, challenger, and creator concept (created by David Emerald) is a powerful antidote to the drama in our lives. So, let’s leave the drama to the entertainment world that we love to watch as bystanders. Instead, let’s create an empowering world for ourselves and those we care about going forward. While the great R&B star Mary J. Blige sang, “No more drama,” perhaps the key is to simply notice, identify, and shift. That way we have the drama, and the drama doesn’t have us."
