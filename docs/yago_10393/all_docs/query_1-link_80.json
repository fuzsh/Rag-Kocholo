That's good.\n\nEveryone's happy, just as well because they're on quite a trip.\n\nOur route starts in Frodsham in Cheshire before popping over the border to Wales, then back to England for a whisk around Lancashire before heading South to Twickenham in greater London for the auction showdown.\n\nThat's a trip.\n\nBut there's no need to hit the road quite yet because the first shop is just a gentle stroll away.\n\nLady Hayes Craft an Antique Center is a sprawling antiques emporium covering several buildings.\n\nSo while Phil and Maria hotfoot it to one part.\n\nQuirky.\n\nQuite like quirky things.\n\nIs it here?\n\nCome on, after you.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: This is the front of the back entrance?\n\nNARRATOR: Margie and Dr. Phil enter another.\n\nWOMAN: Good morning.\n\nWOMAN: Good morning.\n\nWOMAN: Good morning.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: All right.\n\nI'm Dr. Phil.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nNARRATOR: And straightaway, Dr. Phil warms to something.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: That is quite fun, isn't it?\n\nI quite like that.\n\nThat would be-- Yeah.\n\nWhat's it?\n\nAn old tea urn, whatever?\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] I could use that as a specimen pot, couldn't I?\n\nFill it from here, sir.\n\nIt's insulated so it keeps the tea warm.\n\nSo tea would go in there.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'd rather like that.\n\nMy seasoned eye is telling me that's not in mint condition.\n\nAbso-- now, how can you tell that?\n\nNARRATOR: Yes, probably best to move on.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Now, oh, hello, I've always fancied one of these.\n\nOh, not you, madam.\n\nSorry.\n\nI do.\n\nI was always looking-- I do apologize, though.\n\nCame out so I could have phrased that better, couldn't I?\n\nWhat've you found?\n\nI've found a walking stick-- now these shooting sticks, I always fancy one of these.\n\nI'm a man of [INAUDIBLE].\n\nI don't shoot.\n\n- Is it leather?\n\nI hate the idea of shooting at it.\n\nOh, it is leather.\n\nBut that is leather.\n\nShooting stick.\n\nI fancy as I take my Labrador for a walk-- - Yeah.\n\n- --that-- Extends up.\n\n--would be the thing.\n\nNARRATOR: Mind the carpet.\n\nDr. Phil certainly knows what he likes.\n\nThe shooting sticks got a ticket price of 14 pounds.\n\nYep.\n\nNARRATOR: Time to talk to Carol and Margaret.\n\nWe can't afford this.\n\nSo, who do I negotiate with?\n\nAll right.\n\nI'll have to phone the lady [INAUDIBLE]..\n\nPhone the lady?\n\nWhat's her name?\n\nHer name is Elaine.\n\nI think it's Elaine.\n\nWould she take-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] We don't know until we speak to origin.\n\nYeah, but I would like-- we would like to pay because it's hard, this job.\n\nYes But I'd like to pay about eight pounds for that, eight or nine at the most.\n\nNine at the most.\n\nDon't you agree?\n\nA lot of scratches.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Yeah, it's not in mint.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\n[INAUDIBLE],, the lady is offering eight pounds for your shooting stick, and you've got 14 on it.\n\nWhat would be your best price?\n\nAnd Elaine's saying 10 pounds.\n\nOK, can I have a word with Elaine?\n\nDo you want to talk over that?\n\nOK, I'm just pass you over to Phil Hammond.\n\nHi Elaine.\n\nHow are you?\n\nHow's-- how's-- how's your health been recently?\n\nI am-- I am a proper doctor.\n\nHow's life generally?\n\nAll right?\n\nGood.\n\nYou paid eight for it?\n\nOh.\n\nELAINE (ON PHONE): Yeah.\n\nOK.\n\nSo 10-- 10 would be your best offer for us?\n\nELAINE (ON PHONE): Yeah.\n\nOK.\n\nI think 10 pounds sounds reaso-- what do you think, Margie?\n\nI would have preferred nine, but-- Actually?\n\n--I don't want to be hard.\n\nAny medical problems you'd like to discuss with me while we're on national television?\n\nNo, don't go there.\n\nNone at all?\n\nExcellent.\n\nWell, it's been absolutely lovely speaking to you and good luck.\n\nThank you so much for giving us such a reasonable bargain.\n\nThank you.\n\nBye bye.\n\nThere we go.\n\nWell, it's good 10 pounds.\n\n10 pounds.\n\nThat's all right.\n\nDone.\n\nDone deal.\n\n- Done deal.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI should shake somebody's hand.\n\nThat went well.\n\nNARRATOR: Cracking, dealing Dr. Phil, he's certainly quick off the mark.\n\nNow then, Maria and the silver fox appear to be bypassing the shops and instead have made a beeline to Patrick's restoration workshop.\n\nWell, that's quite sweet.\n\nI like this.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Let me just show you how to ride this.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat you do is you just twist the top, and there's a peg in there.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd as you twist it, the peg rises one of these up.\n\nSo watch.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Aw, I love that.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So then you open it.\n\nAnd this is Edwardian, and it's a games table.\n\nThey're called envelope tables because it's fold-- MARIA MCERLANE: Very dusty, isn't it?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, yeah.\n\nWell, it looks like-- MARIA MCERLANE: So the Edwardians would play their bridge around this.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, but a lot of these were inlaid.\n\nLook, this is mahogany.\n\nA lot of these are rosewood.\n\nAnd they've got all sorts of marquetry inlay on there, but someone has tried to strip the top of this off.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Mr. Patrick, I quite like this, but it needs a bit of work, we feel.\n\nPATRICK: OK. MARIA MCERLANE: So tell me your best price.\n\nPATRICK: Very best price to you, 20 pounds.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: But look, Patrick, because I'm trying to do my very best, I would like-- NARRATOR: Hey, charm like that will go a long way in this game.\n\n--to ask you to do it for 10 pounds, if I give you a big smile and a kiss on the cheek.\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\n- And-- - Patrick, you're a star.\n\nThank you.\n\nPATRICK: You're welcome.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Thank you very much, Patrick.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: That's very, very kind to you.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nNARRATOR: For that's what you call hot money and that is a bargain.\n\nDoctor Phil and Margie are in another part of center being kindly attended to by dealer Rose.\n\nWell done, Rose.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Show us where your medical bits and bobs are.\n\nQuite interesting that little thing.\n\nThat pulls out.\n\nThe \"Popular Manikin.\"\n\nGolly, look at that.\n\nDo you like a man with a mustache?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: No, but he looks to be overdressed.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Is he rouged up, do you think?\n\nHe's an acrobat or something.\n\nOh, there's somebody behind him.\n\nOh, no, look at that.\n\nOh.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: My word.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: What's that?\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: I'm thinking it's probably his bladder.\n\nSo either that or a chocolate orange.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: And it blows up like that?\n\nBut my money's on his bladder.\n\nIf he's got a chocolate orange there, he's in trouble.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] Are you in any way, shape, or form squeamish?\n\nNo.\n\nNARRATOR: Just as well because it's time to battle for a price.\n\n- It appeals to me it's quirky.\n\n- Good.\n\nI think it's the kind of thing that might sell to the right person in Twickenham.\n\nROSE: Yeah.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Probably not for 29 pounds, though.\n\nSo I'm wondering-- It was 20.\n\n20?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're being very kind.\n\nYeah, because I had a 15 in mind, which is-- you know this program is making me hard.\n\nWhat about 18?\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: 18?\n\nAll right, 18.\n\n18?\n\nYou sure?\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Yep, you've done well Dr. Phil.\n\nMr. Phil and his dastardly accomplice, meanwhile, have hit the road.\n\nThey're taking a break from shopping and heading across the border into Wales and the town of Holywell.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Oh, nice.\n\nNice corner indeed.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So Dr. Phil, have you met before or not?\n\nMet before?\n\nDo you know we have, yes, because we used to do the circuit together, the stand-up circuit.\n\nAnd he was in a double act.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Now tell me, is he going to be any good at this?\n\nWell, I think he's super competitive even though he's pretending that he's all zen and laid-back.\n\nI think he's got a really, really evil competitive streak.\n\nAnd evil-- and he's going to really stick it to us.\n\nNARRATOR: You can worry about that later because right now, it's time for some peaceful reflection.\n\nAnd our pair are heading to the perfect place, Britain's oldest Christian pilgrimage site.\n\nFor centuries, Christians have made pilgrimages to places of special spiritual significance across the world.\n\nSites such as Lourdes in France and Fatima in Portugal attract millions of visitors every year seeking to endorse their faith or hoping to heal their body or soul.\n\nWales too has such a place.\n\nPeople have been coming to St. Winefride's Well since the seventh century to bathe in and drink its waters, which are said to have healing properties.\n\nBut behind the mystery of this beautiful place is a particularly gruesome tale.\n\nOn hand to tell Maria and Phil all about it is the custodian of the world Lolita L'Aiguille, who first came here as a pilgrim 18 years ago.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: So Lolita, this is the most extraordinary building, and it dates back to the seventh century?\n\nThe building is from 1490.\n\n1490.\n\nYeah, the well is from the seventh century.\n\nNARRATOR: The shrine building was built by Henry VIII's grandmother.\n\nAnd it houses not only the well but also a statue of St. Winefride, as legend has it the spring of water first erupted here after a dramatic event in young Winefride's life.\n\nAs the story goes.\n\nWinefride was a 14-year-old virgin.\n\nAnd Haradok, the son of a local prince fell in love with her.\n\nBut Winefride rejected his advances with terrible consequences.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: So he-- she rejected him.\n\nAnd what did he do?\n\nHe beheads her.\n\nAs he beheads her, her head rolled down to this spot here.\n\nWhere head, the blood was, an earthquake took place and the spring came up.\n\nAnd it's been coming up ever since.\n\nNARRATOR: But according to legend, all was not lost for poor Winefride.\n\nHer uncle, St. Bruno, is said to have arrived at the bloody scene and heroically saved her.\n\nLOLITA L'AIGUILLE: Her head was put back by her uncle, and she was restored from death to life.\n\nThat's why she's known to be the Welsh Lazarus.\n\nNARRATOR: The story continues that Winefride survived for another 22 years becoming a living saint.\n\nAnd the waters that sprung where her head is said to have fallen reputedly took on miraculous healing powers.\n\nLOLITA L'AIGUILLE: Some people think it's just a legend.\n\nBut St. Winefride actually lived.\n\nSt. Winefride was born in Holywell, lived in Holywell.\n\nAnd she wanted to become a nun.\n\nAnd she wanted to save a chastity to become a nun.\n\nAnd she became an abbess.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: When we just-- can I just stop you?\n\nBecause there will be a lot of people that don't believe.\n\nWhen you say some people think it's just a legend-- LOLITA L'AIGUILLE: Yes.\n\n--it may well be.\n\nBut if you believe it, then to you it's your faith.\n\nSymbolically, whichever way you like to believe, St. Winefride had an experience of-- no other woman would have had.\n\nNARRATOR: It's believed that encased within this vessel is a holy relic of St. Winefride's, a finger bone.\n\nFor centuries, pilgrims have traveled from across the world to see it, to bathe in and drink the Holy water, including kings and queens with many people claiming to have been healed by the water.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: There's a huge pile of crutches in the corner.\n\nWhat was all that about?\n\nLOLITA L'AIGUILLE: They are crutches left from those who could not walk 100 years ago.\n\nAnd they would just leave them behind and go off walking.\n\nNARRATOR: And now Maria decides to test the waters.\n\nThe tradition is to go down the steps.\n\nYes.\n\nCold.\n\nNARRATOR: Since the seventh century, millions of people have made the pilgrimage to the well.\n\nAnd this place still gets an average of 50,000 visitors a year.\n\nThank you so much-- You're welcome.\n\n--telling us the story of St. Winefride.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Thank you.\n\nNARRATOR: It's time to leave the piece of the well, and it swallows.\n\nSo we can catch up with Dr. Phil and Margie who are motoring through the Cheshire countryside.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: So you're quite intriguing.\n\nYou're multitalented, aren't you?\n\nI do lots of jobs, not terribly well would be the polite way of saying, and I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none.\n\nSo you started off as a doctor.\n\nYeah, I qualified as a doctor in 1987.\n\nAnd I met a wonderful junior doctor called Tony Gardner.\n\nAnd we started a double act called Struck Off and Die.\n\nReally?\n\nAnd it was back in the days when junior doctors worked hundreds of hours a week.\n\nSo we were quite political.\n\nAnd we went to the Edinburgh Fringe really as a catharsis more than anything else, just to tell people what it was like being exhausted and stalking the wards working hundreds of hours a week.\n\nAnd it sold out.\n\nNARRATOR: How lovely?\n\nOur chap and chappette are heading for the historic town of Knutsford and the words of Knutsford Antique center.\n\nThe sun is shining on us.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nHave you got the money?\n\nA lot.\n\nYou've got the money.\n\nI've got the money.\n\nAll right, there we go.\n\nNARRATOR: Now this is an amply stocked shop with goodies belonging to several dealers each with their own areas.\n\nSo, what can Margie and Dr. Phil sniff out?\n\nI'm drawn to that.\n\nThat looks like a-- Tisn't it?\n\n--a butcher's block or a morticians board.\n\nYou could use that to dissect, couldn't you?\n\nSo it's a big lump of what?\n\nOak, is that?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: No, it's sycamore.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Is it?\n\nHow do you know?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Says it on the ticket.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Says it on the ticket, now.\n\nNARRATOR: Once a common sight in the butcher's shop and used as a cutting surface, these blocks are an increasingly popular accessory in modern kitchens, even when they've been munched.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: When you see woodworm like that, I mean, it's dead and gone.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: So it's not going to collapse is what you're saying?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: It's when you see the holes with a bit of white in the middle.\n\nSo, what do you think we need to buy that for to make a profit?\n\nWhy is it not in the sale?\n\nI mean, it's just you've got to be buying that for what?\n\nA couple of hundred.\n\nRight, so we're unlikely to get that bigger reduction, aren't we?\n\n- Yeah, no.\n\nI'd have thought.\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Yeah, it's a meaty price.\n\nSo want to ponder?\n\nBut Dr. Phil's eager to clean up something here.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: What are those things in the corner?\n\nThey look like-- MARGIE COOPER: Oh, golly.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Chimney sweeps brushes.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Brushes.\n\nThey must have some chimneys in Twickenham, surely.\n\nStanley Holloway.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: We could sell them to the Dick Van Dyke Memorial Foundation.\n\n55 pounds.\n\nEarly 20th century.\n\nBut, who's going to buy them?\n\nWho will buy them?\n\nHave you ever seen anything like that in an antique shop before?\n\n- Well, no, but-- - Probably for a reason.\n\nDo I-- do I want to oversee?\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] Well, somebody would put that up on their wall, wouldn't they as a sort of objet d'art?\n\nWould they not?\n\nOh, crumbs!\n\nIt looks as if-- Am I going mad?\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] --worst one you ever had.\n\nIs it the worst one you ever had?\n\nAm I the worst one you ever-- we're just going round like a lovesick puppy bumping into things.\n\nAre we not-- - Oh, we know.\n\nWe're just trying to-- we've seen things we like, but we've got price-- I quite like that chopping board.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that will sell that, big lump of sycamore.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut I'm not paying more than 200 pounds.\n\nAll right, OK. What do you think?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: That's-- that's sorted.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: OK. NARRATOR: Time for a chat with shop manager David.\n\nHe's a chip off the old block.\n\nBut en route, they spot a chim chiminey.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: So Phil, these are these chimney pot plant-- well, they're in planters now, aren't they?\n\n- They are.\n\nThey put them in the garden, stick a planter in them.\n\nI like it.\n\nIt's a certain majesty.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Yeah.\n\nIs it authentic?\n\nIs it-- because if you put your hand in, your sooty fingers, sooty fingers.\n\n- It does.\n\nBut they're very-- they're very good at-- [INAUDIBLE] If someone was doing a repo, would they go far as doing fakes sooty fingers?\n\nThat's OK. Yeah, but-- PHIL HAMMOND: See, that to me seems a reasonable price.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Personally, I hate them.\n\nAnd you'd have the brushes coming out of it.\n\nHave you got one at home?\n\nI think it's got a certain appeal.\n\nWell, it's your game.\n\nThis is your day, Phil.\n\nNARRATOR: Oh, dear.\n\nI hope this isn't the end of a beautiful friendship.\n\nWell, at least, they agree on the chimney brush.\n\nI'm just going to leave this there as a diversionary tactic.\n\nOK. We quite fancy that.\n\nRight.\n\nBut we also quite fancy that big sycamore chopping board, don't we?\n\nPETER: All right.\n\nNARRATOR: With a ticket price of 320 pounds, Margie gets on the blower to the owner, Peter.\n\nGo easy.\n\nMy figure in mind was a couple of hundred.\n\n260.\n\n260?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Yeah, 260.\n\nRight, well, I'll chew it over.\n\nNARRATOR: A bit like the worms have.\n\nSo 220's out of the question?\n\nYeah.\n\nHow much?\n\n250.\n\n250?\n\n250.\n\n250, I can do.\n\nAll right.\n\nI could do 250.\n\nOK. Well, Phil really wants it.\n\nRight, right, the deal is done.\n\nAnd thank you very, very much indeed.\n\nOK, Peter, thank you.\n\nBye bye.\n\nYes.\n\nThere you go.\n\nI'll take it.\n\n250 done.\n\n- Done.\n\nThank you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nNow-- - Wow.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: We've got this rather fabulous brushes, which I'm quite taken with.\n\nBut there's also the chimney pot.\n\nNARRATOR: They have a combined price of 150 pounds.\n\nFor the pair.\n\nYeah.\n\n95.\n\nWell, you want it, don't you?\n\nI'm tempted, yes.\n\nI'm just really inquisitive.\n\nI think it will sell into it-- OK, we'll see on the day.\n\n--and I'm prepared to be made a fool of.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThank you.\n\nNARRATOR: Let's hope they are lucky because that's 95 pounds for the brush and a chimney, and a whopping 250 pounds for the butcher's block.\n\nLet's face it, a massive risk.\n\nThat Dr. Phil is brave as well as bold.\n\nYeah, best have a lie-down after that lot.\n\nNighty-night.\n\nIt's a brand new day in Lancashire.\n\nAnd Dr. Phil and Maria are raring to go.\n\nWell, we're off.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, maybe.\n\nYou gave that a bit of poke.\n\nI know but I don't really know.\n\nI'm not used to these little pedals now.\n\nSo, what do you make of Phil then?\n\nOh, now, you expect me to drive and talk sense?\n\nI do.\n\nNARRATOR: Maybe not.\n\nIt's like well [INTERPOSING VOICES] It won't make the fun.\n\nLet it.\n\nIt'll be fine.\n\nNARRATOR: While Maria and Dr. Phil do battle with mini.\n\nMargie and Mr. Phil are beetling along with celebrities on their minds.\n\nHow did you get on with the doc?\n\nOh, he was lovely.\n\nVery interesting chap.\n\nYeah, so were you enjoying Maria's company?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Oh, she's lovely.\n\nShe's lovely.\n\nSharp.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nReally sharp.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd you know-- and funny.\n\nAnd she's got-- what I love about she's got that really quick wit.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: How would you feel if you were stuck on the road forever?\n\n- With you?\n\nYeah.\n\nI wouldn't mind you.\n\nI think once you start saying \"shush\" quite a lot, it would get on my nerves.\n\nAnd I would get on your nerves incredibly quickly.\n\nYou do that thing with a finger, don't you?\n\nOnly when I'm making a point.\n\nNARRATOR: Later, both teams will be heading down south for an auction in Twickenham.\n\nBut at the moment, they're meeting up in Blackburn.\n\nSpend, spend, spend, spend, Viv Nicholson.\n\nRemember her?\n\nI do remember.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] I do.\n\nI'm going to buy like a pool's winner.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: I mean, it was a massive sell out.\n\nHi.\n\nGood morning.\n\nHow are you, love?\n\nYou all right?\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Oh, beautifully done.\n\nYeah.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Can I get out now?\n\nWell, it stopped anyhow.\n\nMorning, Dr. Phil.\n\nHere we are, lovely.\n\nHow you doing?\n\nI'm very well.\n\nHow are you?\n\nJust slightly the worse for wear, but I think it'll go.\n\nI think I have frightened Dr. Phil.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nNARRATOR: Yesterday, Margie and Dr. Phil spent a bold 375 pounds on five items, a shooting stick, an anatomy manual, a chimney pot with chimney brush, and their risky big purchase, the butcher's block, leaving them a mere 27 pounds to splash out today.\n\nConversely, discerning Mr Phil and Maria spent a squidly 10 pounds on an Edwardian card table, meaning the pressure's on today to spend big.\n\nTheir bulging wallets are stuffed with 390 pounds.\n\nThe wealthy pair are heading for Darwen.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: See, I think today-- Yes, darling.\n\nWe've got 390 pounds left, haven't we?\n\nWoo-hoo!\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: But you can only react to what you see.\n\nSo I think the best plan is probably no plan.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: So, yes, no plan really at all, other than to get some fabulous things-- But no money.\n\n--but no money and sell them-- PHILIP SERRELL: For lots of money.\n\nNARRATOR: Their destination this morning is one of Phil's favorite shops, a Yard in Barn, filled with reclaimed oddities and eclectic vintage.\n\nThis could be right up Maria's street too.\n\nShould we do outside first?\n\nYes, good plan.\n\nBut isn't that fabulous the way it's-- I mean, I just love weathered things.\n\nYeah, we should get on well, then.\n\nNARRATOR: Owner Stephen is on hand to assist.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: So I know we're doing outside but very quickly-- NARRATOR: But Maria's fast to pounce today.\n\nShe's found a 1950s kitchen cabinet.\n\nHow much is that?\n\n80.\n\nIs it actually enamel?\n\nSTEPHEN: That front sections is not.\n\nThat sometimes is enamel.\n\nIn this case, it's not.\n\nIt's like a Formica.\n\nI think it's a slightly older ones where there enamel.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: You see.\n\nSTEPHEN: You've got-- that's your bread board.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Bread board.\n\nA little tray in there.\n\nYou love this, don't you?\n\nI really love it.\n\nI'm not sure I love it for Twickenham.\n\nIf we were doing an auction down by the seaside, it would be perfect.\n\nBeach huts-- think beach hut, think second home, think little sheds for your children, overindulge children.\n\nThink Twickenham.\n\nI am doing.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nNARRATOR: Yikes.\n\nShe's headstrong.\n\nCan Phil keep up.\n\nSo the cabinets want to ponder.\n\nWhat other treasures can our pair unearth?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Stephen.\n\nSTEPHEN: Yes.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: These ropey old chairs that nobody wants.\n\nSTEPHEN: Danish find.\n\nWhat?\n\nSorry, what?\n\nA Danish armchair.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Now, these ropey old chairs that nobody wants.\n\nYou've got four of them.\n\nThere are six, I think.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: You've got six.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] [INAUDIBLE] know, the 150.\n\nIf they are Danish, they're worth a lot more than that, aren't they?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So, would you split them?\n\nSTEPHEN: Yes.\n\nSo, would you-- how much would two be?\n\nWell, the 25 pounds each, so 225 is 60, isn't it?\n\nYeah, 225 is 50.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nIt's 30.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] No, I do-- I'll do it 50, 50.\n\nYou can split them either way.\n\nSee, I think a pair of these would be better than four.\n\nBecause I think a pair you could-- they'd be quite trendy.\n\nI'm thinking London flat.\n\nI know.\n\nYeah.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Right.\n\nWell, let's just have a think up.\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Maria's is not so sure.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nNARRATOR: But Phil's decided to start a list.\n\nOh, Lordy.\n\nThese two could be some time here.\n\nI think we should leave them to it for a while and catch up with our other dynamic duo.\n\nMargie and Dr. Phil are making their way through Lancashire to Clitheroe, where they've come to investigate the origins of the greatest fictional detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes.\n\nHero of four novels, 56 short stories, and countless films and TV series, this most loved character was created by Arthur Conan Doyle, who, like our Dr. Phil, was both a doctor and a writer.\n\nAnd it appears that some of his earliest ideas came from here, his eminent public school, Stonyhurst College.\n\nThe school still holds many items that hold clues to his influences.\n\nAnd on hand to guide Margie and Dr. Phil through them is curator of collections Jan Graffius.\n\nWow!\n\nIt's an impressive hall.\n\nNARRATOR: Arthur Conan Doyle was sent away to school here in 1868 at the age of nine.\n\nHe was to meet fellow pupils who were to inspire him later on.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: And you have a row of original desks.\n\nThis-- this has been kept-- this as dates from the time of Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Watson jumps out at you.\n\nAnd was Watson an actual contemporary of Conan Doyle?\n\nWatson came five years later.\n\nSo Arthur would have known him at the bottom of the school when-- when he was at the top.\n\nSo Arthur Conan Doyle is here on here as well?\n\nI can't see him.\n\nIt's not the most enthralling of signatures.\n\nThere it is.\n\nA Doyle.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: You can't read it.\n\nYou can tell he was going to be a doctor.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Dr. Phil is right.\n\nThat's definitely him, is it?\n\nThat's definitely him.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat actually says morphine.\n\n15 milligrams, twice weekly.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: This is the entry log for the little prep school.\n\nSo when Arthur came, he was age nine.\n\nAnd he went first to the prep school.\n\nDid he board?\n\nYes, everybody boarded.\n\nSo away from his family from the age of nine?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nAnd as the boys came in, they signed their name.\n\nAnd you can see here, Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: His handwriting was better then, wasn't it?\n\nWell, this is the only time he signed himself Conan.\n\nFor the rest of his time at the college, he was known as Arthur Doyle.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: And we can immediately see an influence perhaps, Patrick Sherlock.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: Well, Patrick Sherlock was in his class.\n\nFiendishly clever.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: He was fiendishly good at calligraphy.\n\nHe wasn't very clever, actually.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Maybe there's a bit of an ironic joke going on.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: Quite possibly.\n\nWell, they must have made an impression on him.\n\nYeah, well, they were friends or something.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] one way or another.\n\nSo this September 1870, these are all the boys coming new to the school.\n\nAnd if you look here-- MARGIE COOPER: Moriarty.\n\nA pair of Moriartys.\n\nPair of Moriarty.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Dare we ask which of these Moriartys is the Moriarty in the Sherlock Holmes Tales is based on.\n\nI think he conflated the two because Michael was a fiendishly clever mathematician.\n\nAnd John Moriarty was altogether a trickier character.\n\nHe went on to become a lawyer and Attorney General for Ireland and was described by some of the legal profession at the time as being serpentine.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Is that him?\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: That's him there.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Golly, yes, no, he does look serpentine.\n\nYou wouldn't want to cross him back in a dark alley.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: No, indeed, you don't.\n\nAnd so I suspect that Conan Doyle took elements from both their characters.\n\nAnd then, this is Arthur here.\n\nThis is a photograph from his last year at school.\n\nSo here you see him in the middle standing in front of the windows.\n\nSo those are the youngest in the class.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: He is quite a big boy, isn't he?\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: He was tall and very athletic.\n\nHe loved football.\n\nAnd he was a very keen cricketer.\n\nNARRATOR: It wasn't only his fellow schoolmates that impacted Arthur's riding.\n\nThe building too provided inspiration for one of his most famous novels \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\"\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: This building here, just behind here would have been Arthur's bedroom when he came.\n\nAnd down here were the dog kennels and dogs.\n\nThey had many, many dogs.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: So we're stretching it to say the hound of the Baskervilles could have been heard from the window?\n\n- So then how?\n\n- No, no, no, no.\n\nHe would have-- he would definitely have heard them.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: All that was building in his mind.\n\nJAN GRAFFIUS: All right.\n\nSo-- So show us where would the young Arthur Conan Doyle have looked out from?\n\nBehind that gable was the bedroom, the bedroom block.\n\nAnd if you look across to the mill buildings here, the dog kennels were just behind there.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Ah!\n\nSo he could easily have heard the hounds doing their thing.\n\nOn a quiet night, he would have heard them, yes, complaining.\n\nWhat a profound effect that would have on a vivid young imagination.\n\nAnd lying in bed.\n\nNARRATOR: After finishing at school, Arthur trained to be a doctor.\n\nBut just a few years later found fame and celebrity as a full-time writer.\n\nEven now, he's one of the world's best selling authors who still sells books in the millions.\n\nHis most popular to this day being \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\"\n\nIt's clear to see how Stonyhurst might have become Baskervilles hall with its avenue of yew trees transformed in the novel into the dark walk.\n\n[DOG HOWLING] And, what's that I hear?\n\nYeah, best to hotfoot it out of there.\n\nNow, we last saw Maria and Phil larking about in Oaks Antiques.\n\nLet's find out how they're getting on.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI'll bet you that Margie has had a lovely time, that Dr. Phil.\n\nThey've been walking around nice shops, nice antique centers, having a really lovely time.\n\nAnd I've got her.\n\nSeaman Mickalene ready for duty, sir.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Have you seen the Navy lot?\n\nIs it a good look for me?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: It's a very cool look.\n\nStephen, how much is that theater light?\n\n200.\n\nOh, behave.\n\nPut a new bulb in.\n\nThat costs 26 pounds.\n\nBut it's not been PAT tested, has it?\n\nThere is a PAT testing label on it.\n\nWhen does it run out?\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Does it actually plug in?\n\n- Well, the-- - I can't show you-- NARRATOR: Portable Appliance Testing or PAT is a safety check required for appliances like this theater light.\n\nIt run out of date in 1999.\n\nWell, it was the last time I used it.\n\nYeah So it's decorative.\n\nWell, I know-- what would happen-- no, no.\n\nSeriously, what would happen with this is that if it went into the sale room, the auctioneer is rather-- they'd rather cut it up.\n\nThey'd probably cut the flex off there because I wouldn't have thought there's a prayer of this passing of current PAT test.\n\nBut, can it be rewired?\n\nSo then why someone would rewire it?\n\nBut-- I see.\n\n--in my eyes, this has got to come at like half his 200 pounds because that's just so far out of date is not true.\n\nThe problem is with modern people is they don't like to do anything.\n\nThey want it all done for them.\n\nI know but if that was polished-- MARIA MCERLANE: I know it would be lovely.\n\nNARRATOR: They like it, but still no deal.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: I don't know what the hell that is.\n\nStephen, what's this thing here?\n\nOh, easy on, easy on, easy on.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nSTEPHEN: It's a set setter.\n\nOh, of course.\n\nWhat the hell is a set setter?\n\nA cobble setter.\n\nWell, the metal bits should stay on.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, so it's faulty for a start.\n\nSo it's heavy.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah.\n\nSo you know when they were laying the roads in Victorian era, and they used cobbles.\n\nWell, they did in the north.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: [INAUDIBLE] Well, they beat the cobble down.\n\nI think that might be our sort of local piece.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So, what's it called?\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: A set setter.\n\nSTEPHEN: Well, I call it a set setter or a cobble setter.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: The cobble setter.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: That couldn't be more northern.\n\nSTEPHEN: Do you know?\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] STEPHEN: South.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: No.\n\nWe have Tom Macadam roadways.\n\nAnd, How.\n\nMuch is that-- Our roads are paved with gold, you know?\n\nHow much is that?\n\n45.\n\nMy heart.\n\nI think you're deluded, Stephen.\n\nThat's-- that's good.\n\nI mean, that's, you know, pointless.\n\nSTEPHEN: It's the only one I've ever seen.\n\nBut it's a lovely objet d'art.\n\nSTEPHEN: Yes, it is.\n\nI quite want that for myself.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Anything else on here that you want to have a look at?\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: So much.\n\nSo much.\n\nSorry.\n\nYou see that again-- it makes me slightly well up because look.\n\nI'll do if you order them and pay for.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: How old are those?\n\nSTEPHEN: I would say those are probably from the '20s, '30s.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: And you put steel on the toe cap so that they would last longer.\n\nI mean, this was a woman's presumably, is it?\n\nDo they?\n\nIt's probably a woman's size.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: How much are your clothes?\n\nSTEPHEN: 15 pounds.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].\n\nNARRATOR: Suits you.\n\nTwo more for the list and now.\n\nPhil, look what I found.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, great.\n\nFantastic.\n\nAre you being sarcastic?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: No, no, not at all, no, no.\n\nYou just carry on.\n\nNot essentially my cup of char.\n\nBut I think that might work with those chairs.\n\nNARRATOR: That'll be the Danish chairs they saw earlier.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: How much?\n\n45.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: It grieves me to say it, but I think you might actually be right.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: That might go with those chairs?\n\nOh, shut up.\n\nWe asked each other questions about our lives, and now it's got to \"shut up.\"\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, see, we could be an old married couple.\n\nJust shut up.\n\nIt is after 24 hours.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: How much is it?\n\nSTEPHEN: 45.\n\nNARRATOR: It's a classic retro coffee table, g plan, 1970s, teak with ceramic tiles.\n\nWhat's not to love?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: I quite like that actually.\n\nRight, time's rushing on.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Yes.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: What we need to do is-- let's just have a quick skirt up here.\n\nI'd like some art now.\n\nNARRATOR: Yes, make some decisions, people.\n\nUh-oh, oop, here we go again.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: You like those as well?\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: These are-- don't you love that movement?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, tambour fronted.\n\nAnd the thing about it is you see that that's a file drawer.\n\nThat's actually-- it should be sitting down, shouldn't it on a desk that?\n\nSTEPHEN: Yes.\n\nSo it's wrong way up.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So it's the wrong way up.\n\nIt should be like that.\n\nSo it sits on your desk like that, and you've got files in there.\n\nWhat bonkers about this is that when I started in this business, that was like, why would you want that?\n\nThat's not an antique.\n\nBut now, that's a real good vintage-y lot.\n\nAnd I could see that at auction making 30 to 50 quid.\n\nDo you wanna ask how much it is?\n\nI think he might have gone off me.\n\nYeah, I think I know just how he feels.\n\nI think I'm going to need a bigger bit of paper as well.\n\nNARRATOR: It's either panic buying, or these two are highly astute.\n\nWhatever it is, Phil has one condition for Maria.\n\nDo not look or touch anything else in this place, all right?\n\nNothing.\n\nNot anything at all, nothing.\n\nAll right?\n\nNothing at all.\n\nHave we got that?\n\nNothing.\n\nNothing.\n\nAll right?\n\nNARRATOR: So the final shopping list is, the kitchen cabinet, the Danish chairs, the theater light, the cobble setter, and the clogs, the g plan coffee table, and the filing cabinet with a whopping combined asking price of 460 pounds.\n\nTime to work out a deal with Stephen.\n\nLooks like this one's being left to Maria to work her charm.\n\nThere's one.\n\nLet's just see where we're going here.\n\n10, 20, 30-- NARRATOR: Good technique, Maria.\n\nCounting out tenners.\n\n--70, 80, 92.\n\nFeels good, right?\n\n10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 93.\n\nNARRATOR: OK, 300 pounds.\n\nAnd Phil's back.\n\nSTEPHEN: 325.\n\nI've given it to him for 300.\n\nBut it's up to you whether or not we-- It's totally up to you.\n\nI'm probably losing money at 300.\n\nWhat about 320?\n\nGo on.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe haven't ripped you off.\n\nWe've just had a lovely healthy bit of bartering.\n\nThat's it.\n\nBut the grandchildren won't eat for a couple of weeks, but that's-- don't worry about it.\n\nCan I just say?\n\nYou've been a star, mate.\n\n- Thank you very much.\n\nIt was nice having you.\n\nThank you and you've helped us.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, with 320 pounds, Maria's managed to get almost a third off the asking price.\n\nShe's definitely getting the hang of this.\n\nShame this pair's all shopped out.\n\nNow zipping through the Lancashire countryside, Dr. Phil and Margie making their way to Whalley.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: He's a bit of a worry is old Phil.\n\nHe's a wily old fox.\n\nHe's a wily old fox.\n\nI think he'll buy, and I think Maria will make him buy.\n\nYeah, they're both-- they're both up for it.\n\nShe tried to pretend she wasn't at all competitive, but I could tell by the steely glint in her eye.\n\nShe likes vintage, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a little bit of vintage popping out there.\n\nI think Phil's going to go for vintage.\n\nI think Phil will go for unusual.\n\nHe always does.\n\nBut you can't worry too much.\n\nNARRATOR: You might be on to something there.\n\nThese two have one last shop to visit and a whole 27 pounds to spend.\n\nSo I wonder what dealer Philip might have in store.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Now, we have some slightly challenging news.\n\nIn your very beautiful shop.\n\nI've made a few inopportune purchases.\n\nSo out of our 400 pound budget, I only have 27 pounds left.\n\nAll right.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nI accept to be a slight disappointment to you, but you're hiding it extremely well.\n\nNot disappointed.\n\nSo I'm throwing down the gauntlet to you, Philip.\n\nWhat do you think you can give us that will sell to the people of Twickenham for a best price of 27 pounds?\n\nNARRATOR: Yeah, well, nothing in the main shop, but Philip does have a lock up just around the corner filled with smaller items.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: All right.\n\nHere, I'll tell you what?\n\nYou're very neat and tidy.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Aladdin's cave.\n\nWell, what takes my eye?\n\nThose.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Oh, dominoes, yeah.\n\nIs that a complete set?\n\nWell, I assume they are because-- How do you know how many there are?\n\nOh, you covering your bases there.\n\nSo what-- because the box is full.\n\nDo we know how many?\n\nExactly, because the box is full.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: It level's off.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- It's quite popular.\n\nIt's quite popular chicken in these days, isn't it?\n\nThey'll Petanque and dominoes with a-- I've seen dominoes fail.\n\n--with a small glass of absinthe.\n\nI can see that.\n\nPHILIP: That'll be bone and ebony.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Here they

boots to go with it?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nDo you think this will go well in Twickenham?\n\nI want together-- Have you not heard of the cobbled streets of Twickenham?\n\nThe cobbled streets of Twickenham?\n\nTogether they would make a nice objet d'art.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: Well, we can hardly laugh because we've fallen into a similar trap, I fear.\n\nHow much?\n\n40 quid the two.\n\n40 pounds for the two.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: What, including the boots?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah.\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: Yeah.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Well, this is a strand theater light.\n\nMARGIE COOPER:

money.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: It is bigger.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Are they going to remake Mary Poppins, do you think?\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: We were thinking so.\n\nThe Dick Van Dyke, I thought those two would go together.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: [INAUDIBLE] Dick Van Dyke.\n\nHave a little look in the box.\n\nGuess, what do you think is in there?\n\nMARIA MCERLANE: I don't know if I want to open the

the two.\n\nWell done, everybody.\n\nNow, it's done.\n\nNARRATOR: Well done, indeed.\n\nSo let's hear what they've really thought.\n\nI thought that that card table for a tenner, it was an extraordinary purchase.\n\nMARGIE COOPER: Yeah, but don't get too excited about that.\n\nYou know, you sold him that for a tenner because it's so unfashionable at the moment.\n\nDo you know I think it's interesting, I think, we've each got a potential Achilles heel?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd ours is our light, which is cost 135 quid.\n\nAnd theirs is their block, which has cost 250.\n\nTwice that, twice out.\n\nI'd rather have our Achilles heel than theirs.\n\nI think they've done very well, but I don't know-- shall we-- - You should see it's my first-- I've never been to an auction.\n\nSo I don't dare presume.\n\nBut I am quietly confident.\n\nI'm quietly confident.\n\nWell, all will be revealed.\n\nSo on balance-- oh, Lord, I think we'll make a profit.\n\nFingers crossed, high five.\n\nNARRATOR: After starting out in Frodsham, Cheshire, our celebrities and experts are ending their trip at the auction in Twickenham, London.\n\nAnd Maria has bought a furry friend.\n\nPHIL

COOPER: Dr. Phil-- I call him Dr. Phil because he's a doc.\n\nYeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\nHe's never been to an auction, so, you know, it's all going to be a revelation.\n\nAnd I don't know whether Maria-- probably Maria have-- Well, you should have seen her in the shop we went to.\n\nGordon Bennett, talking about a kid in the sweet shop.\n\nWell, that's what I mean.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES] I hate the enthusiasm, worries me because we're a couple of old-- Yeah, we'll still knock it out of him.\n\n[LAUGHTER] Here we go.\n\nSo I see-- - Is that it?\n\n- Yes.\n\nWell, that looks posh.\n\nIt looks like a puppy-- There could be the money here.\n\nNARRATOR: I like your optimism.\n\nOh, pooch.\n\nLooking well and full of verve and bigger optimism, which is excellent.\n\nI always wondered if you under slept all weekend.\n\nThey could be relationships, couldn't they?\n\nMARGIE COOPER: All right.\n\nAre you ready for the fray?\n\nI'm ready for the fray.\n\nNARRATOR: The action's all about to take place in High Road Auctions.\n\nBut first, what does auctioneer David Holmes think of our celebrities and experts choices?\n\nDAVID HOLMES: I think my favorite lot would be the studio lamp.\n\nI think it could do well.\n\nThe least favorite would probably be the Edwardian card table.\n\nA few years ago, it may have made 200 to 300.\n\nIt's such a shame, but we'll struggle with that one.\n\nNARRATOR: Dr. Phil and Margie bought five auction lots for the grand total of 388 pounds.\n\nWhile Mr. Phil and Maria splashed out on six lots for a slightly less 330 pounds.\n\nPHIL HAMMOND: My word.\n\nHear me out.\n\nCan I go onto your lap, Margie?\n\nOr do I have to sit next to you?\n\nI feel it might be one of those.\n\nYou have to sit next to me.\n\nYou might have to comfort me in my time of distress.\n\n- We here?\n\n- Oh, hello.\n\nHere you are.\n\nHow are you?\n\nNARRATOR: They're like the famous five, aren't they?\n\nRight.\n\nEyes to the front.\n\nThe auction's starting.\n\nFirst up, Maria and Phil's Edwardian card table.\n\nYou know, I don't know how many times I've done this now, and it still gives me the heebie-jeebies.\n\nDoes it?\n\nNARRATOR: Oh,
