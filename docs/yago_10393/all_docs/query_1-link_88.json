I think Nick would always-- - I'm very happy with that.\n\n- --like being with a girl.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah.\n\nVery happy.\n\n- If you don't mind, Nick.\n\n- Catherine.\n\nWhat a plan.\n\nAnd I'm relying 100% on you because I know nothing about it.\n\nWe are doomed, Margaret.\n\nWe are doomed.\n\nWell, we'll enjoy ourselves then, won't we?\n\nCome on let's go and have a go then.\n\nYou'll have fun.\n\nWe've got to walk.\n\nYou know we're quite competitive.\n\nNARRATOR: Oh.\n\n- We've got to win this.\n\nNARRATOR: That's what I like to hear.\n\nI love a bit of fighting spirit.\n\nEn route to their first shop, Nick drops a bit of a bombshell.\n\nI've got a notebook with me-- Oh no.\n\n--and I'm marking you out of 10.\n\nNo!\n\nI am, actually.\n\nThis is what-- this is what-- I am weighting your advice 1 to 10, and then I'm weighting the return at the auction 1 to 10, and there's a correlation between your advice and whether it works or not.\n\nYes?\n\nThis is what I was dreading.\n\nI thought you were going to be around corners with your notebook, aren't you?\n\nLike you do on \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nI'm not going to be around corners.\n\nI'm going to be right beside you with the notebook.\n\nNo.\n\nNARRATOR: Right.\n\nTop of your game then, Catherine.\n\nThis way.\n\nShould I open the door.\n\nGo on.\n\nIt's good fun, auctioning.\n\nIs it open?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm Nick.\n\nI'm Peter.\n\n- Peter, how are do you doing?\n\n- Hi, Peter.\n\nGood to see you.\n\nHello.\n\nNice to see you.\n\nNARRATOR: Time to declare war on the other team.\n\nIs this a bazooka?\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\nRocket launcher.\n\nIs it really?\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Your kind of thing, Nick?\n\nCor blimey.\n\nThere are times when I've dearly wanted one of these.\n\nNARRATOR: From guns to a pair of unusual metal vases.\n\nWhat are these?\n\nThese are shell casings, are they?\n\nPETER: That's trench art.\n\nFirst World War.\n\nNICK HEWER: Is that right?\n\nPETER: It is.\n\nLiterally, they're 100 years old.\n\nOh, well you could-- So they've been made [INAUDIBLE].. but are they-- They're brass shell cases, and if you-- 68 pounds for the pair.\n\nThey weren't made actually in the trenches themselves.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nThey were made behind the trenches in the blacksmith's shop-- - Nice shape of them.\n\n--and things like that.\n\nI like that sort of pinched-in shape there.\n\n- NICK HEWER: There's a sort of a sadness about it.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: I know.\n\nWhen you think about what went behind it, it is-- PETER: They're very evocative, aren't they?\n\nNICK HEWER: It's not a thing of beauty, is it?\n\nPETER: No.\n\nIt's not.\n\nNICK HEWER: It's quirky, and there's a story.\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\n- I like that.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI do too.\n\nWhich one?\n\nWhich one?\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nLook.\n\nNARRATOR: Oh.\n\nSpotted something you like, Catherine.\n\nKentish Town?\n\nFrom the Underground.\n\nSo this is original?\n\nOh yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'll say everything is original.\n\nHow much is this?\n\nIt's very clever putting a hand over the price.\n\nDo you like that?\n\nIt's in all enamel side.\n\nPETER: All enamel.\n\nYeah.\n\nNICK HEWER: I do.\n\nPETER: Quality enamel.\n\nNICK HEWER: Do you really like that?\n\nI do like that?\n\nWell, no, but I-- I promised myself I would not tell you to buy anything because I know it could bite me on the bottom.\n\nAnd anyway, you know I'm [INAUDIBLE].. And you'd tell me off.\n\nHow much is that, by the way?\n\nPETER: What's the price on it?\n\n150.\n\nWhat, that?\n\nWhat's your normal-- we're sort of trade, really.\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\nTrade is 10%.\n\nIs that all you get?\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\nThat's appalling.\n\nWell-- I had no idea they were so [INAUDIBLE].. PETER: That's normal trade.\n\nI thought you'd be quite good at this bargaining lark.\n\nWell, I haven't started yet.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut is your background-- what's your background?\n\n- What we're going to do-- - Is it maths?\n\nIs it accounts?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat we're going to do is we're going to-- you can either take that and bargain on one, or you bundle.\n\nBundle.\n\nI love bundle.\n\nI love bundling.\n\nAnd then we have a list, and then we say, well, if we do take two of these or three, then one of this, and then you work out the best sort of deal as a bundle.\n\nNARRATOR: While Nick's busy teaching Catherine how to do a deal, Margaret and Phil are ready for a right old rummage in the Old Curiosity Shop.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Hello there.\n\nJAMES: Hello, Margaret.\n\nNARRATOR: After 45 years in the antiques game, owner James knows his stuff, and Philip's determined to sniff out the good bits.\n\nNobody comes up here.\n\nWell, that's what we like to hear.\n\nYep.\n\nWe are special then, are we?\n\nNARRATOR: Well, special to us, certainly.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: What are those?\n\nWhat are those?\n\nI like glasses.\n\nThey're not very big, though.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Well, that's the whole point about them.\n\nThey're called illusion glasses, right, and the reason why they're-- if you put your finger [INAUDIBLE]-- - Yeah, I thought-- yes.\n\nDoes it-- they're for mean hosts?\n\nNo.\n\nWhile you're pouring your guests a drink, you can drink a very meager amount while they're getting completely pickled because your glass will take about a quarter of theirs.\n\nSo these are illusion glasses because when you fill it up, it looks like you've got a full glass.\n\nWouldn't it be better to give them to the guests?\n\nWell, yeah, yeah.\n\nIf you're being really [INAUDIBLE].. NARRATOR: My thoughts exactly, Margaret.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So these are probably around about, I would think 1820, 1840, something like that.\n\nJAMES: You can have those for 20 the pair.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: That's the marked price, though.\n\nWe don't buy things for the marked price, do we?\n\nJAMES: 15.\n\n- This lady-- 15 This lady is good, James.\n\nWhat about if we put a little parcel together, James?\n\nThat might be the way forward.\n\nDo you want to take her to court about that?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nAnd I think she might beat me.\n\nShe knows a bit more than me.\n\nI think she-- I think she knows a lot more than me.\n\nWell, let's just put those down.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: --though I quite like-- because they're plain, aren't they?\n\nI don't like all this stuff with all these-- And what about these here?\n\nBooks.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: There you are Let's have a look at the \"MP's Garden of--\" MARGARET MOUNTFORD: \"MP's Garden of Verses.\"\n\nWith apologies to-- must be Robert Louis Stevenson, RLS.\n\nI'll give you a deal on the two books and the glasses.\n\n30 for the lot.\n\n30?\n\nJames.\n\nI'm warming to you, James, by the minute.\n\nDo you like these?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Yeah.\n\nI do.\n\nI like this because I can't write legibly at all, and I think the idea that you've got something like this, and they're all different, and it's nice and clean.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: James, you've asked us too much money for this because it says here it's two shillings and six pence, which is very roughly 12 and 1/2 pence, isn't it Margaret?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: I think so I'll do the books and those then at 25.\n\nThere you are.\n\nDid you say 20 for these two then?\n\nYeah.\n\nHe did.\n\nI said 25.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nIt's my-- 30 then 25.\n\n--my hearing's awful.\n\nGo on then.\n\n20.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: There we are, sir.\n\nJAMES: Thank you.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: I'll just shake you by the hand.\n\nYou're a gentleman.\n\nThank you.\n\nNARRATOR: That's two lots bagged.\n\n15 pounds for the illusion glasses and a fiver for the books.\n\nMeanwhile, back with the bundle-forming Nick, Catherine has spotted something tucked high on a shelf I think that's good then.\n\nI think that might make us a bit of money.\n\nWhich?\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: The stained glass.\n\nCan your son, who looks a little bit more agile than you, shimmy up there and bring it down?\n\nMAN: Yeah.\n\nIt is heavy.\n\nNICK HEWER: Is it heavy?\n\nIt'll be flexible too.\n\nMAN: It's even cheaper.\n\nNICK HEWER: And that's all original, legit, and everything?\n\nMAN: Yeah.\n\nIt's got one crack across the far side.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Oh, yes, in the green.\n\nNARRATOR: So while the slightly cracked, 120-pound, art nouveau stained glass is added to the bundle-- Do you mind if we head on down?\n\nPETER: No.\n\nHelp yourself.\n\nThank you, Peter.\n\nNARRATOR: --our team head into the bowels of the shop, where they discover another sign, this time for a ship called the Aurora.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Peter?\n\nYeah.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Can I just ask you, these Aurora things-- PETER: Yeah.\n\nWhat were they actually-- obviously, they were on the ship as what exactly?\n\nThey go along the railings.\n\nWere they on the railings?\n\nPETER: On the other side of the gangway.\n\nBy the gangway.\n\nOK. NICK HEWER: That's quite interesting.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: I think it's quite fun.\n\nIt'd be great if you had a daughter called Aurora.\n\nDo you know what?\n\nI was just thinking that.\n\nNICK HEWER: You could put them-- CATHERINE SOUTHON: It's the sort of name.\n\nNICK HEWER: --on the pram.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: You'd have to have a pretty big pram.\n\nNARRATOR: The MV Aurora is a modern cruise ship which sails from Southampton, so despite being relatively new, these gangplank signs have a high ticket price of 85 pounds.\n\nBundling complete, Nick has chosen the trench art vases, the old enamel Kentish Town Underground sign, the stained glass window, and the Aurora signs.\n\nTheir combined ticket price is a whopping 413 pounds.\n\nBetter get your bartering head on, Nick.\n\nWhat if we said 200, and we'll be out of your hair.\n\nYou can say 200, but you won't get it for 200.\n\nOh.\n\n- We'll get out of your hair.\n\n- I can't do it.\n\nI really can't.\n\nNo?\n\nWhat would you say to-- I'd do it for 250 for the lot.\n\nYou can squeeze a little bit because-- I have.\n\nHave you?\n\nYeah.\n\nCould you squeeze a tiny bit more because that would be wonderful for you to get rid of all of this.\n\nMy back's killing me.\n\nHe's an old man.\n\nAll this standing up.\n\nPETER: I know.\n\nAnd I've got to heave it out to the car.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Can we say 220?\n\nYeah.\n\n230.\n\nTell you what, pal.\n\nYou're going to get such a smacked bottom if that doesn't sell.\n\nI can tell you much.\n\nPlease help me out here.\n\n220, and then I won't get into so much trouble.\n\nPlease.\n\nGo on.\n\nGot it here.\n\nCash.\n\nLook.\n\nPETER: Folding money.\n\n- The folding 20s.\n\n- Go on.\n\n220.\n\n- 220.\n\nPut it there.\n\n- Thank you, Catherine.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nHe sounds exhausted, poor man.\n\n- Well done.\n\nI am.\n\nMy legs have gone.\n\nNo, not you.\n\nPeter, I'm not worried about you.\n\nNARRATOR: Charming.\n\nAmazing discount on four items, all thanks to some bolshie bargaining.\n\nBut they have taken a big risk by blowing more than half their budget in the first shop.\n\nMargaret and Phil have only spent a paltry 20 pounds, so have hit the road and are heading north to the pretty city of Salisbury.\n\nSo what do we do about the next shop in Salisbury?\n\nWell, I hope we get a good, interesting selection of things, and I hope we can find something a bit different.\n\nDo you want to win?\n\nIs it important to you?\n\nCertainly do.\n\nYeah.\n\nI want to beat Nick.\n\nNARRATOR: That's the road trip spirit.\n\nSalisbury Cathedral has the tallest church spire in the UK.\n\nIn fact, it doesn't have a peal of bells because for fear the vibrations would bring down the tower.\n\nWow.\n\nBut it's not the cathedral that the team are here for.\n\nOh no.\n\nThey're heading to Salisbury Antiques Market in the hunt of some hidden gems.\n\nWatch you don't trip over that, whatever it is.\n\nWhat on Earth is this?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nIt's a dole.\n\nBells.\n\nWestminster chimes.\n\nSo they're all in an order then?\n\nFour, three, two, one.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Oh, I'm going to conduct.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: OK. PHILIP SERRELL: Ready?\n\nFour, three, two, one.\n\nNo.\n\nWhoops.\n\nWhoops.\n\n- Come on.\n\nTiming.\n\nTry it.\n\nFour, three, two, one, two.\n\nWhich is two?\n\nThe one that you just hit.\n\n[BELLS RINGING] Three, four, two.\n\nFour, two.\n\nIt's like the bloody generation game this, isn't it?\n\nIt's not going very well here at all.\n\nThen hit that one.\n\nYou got it!\n\nI got it!\n\nWell done!\n\nBut would anybody else want it?\n\nThat's the question.\n\nNARRATOR: Don't quit your day job.\n\nBetter get that business head back on, and give Peter here a grilling.\n\nHave you got anything nice we could have cheaply and make some money on?\n\nPETER: I'll have a look in my cupboard and see what I've got.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Is this the special cupboard?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Secret cupboard.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Oh look at this then.\n\nNARRATOR: Ah.\n\nA box of assorted silver goodies and not a ticket price to be seen.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Mm, I like silver.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Do you?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Is that a pill box?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: This is-- you press that there, and that comes open, and that will invite little peeks and things in there, wouldn't it?\n\nIt's [INAUDIBLE].\n\nYeah.\n\nSo this is like a little etui.\n\nI would think it dates to, what, 1790?\n\nPETER: Yeah.\n\nAnd this would have been-- you'd have put perhaps needle cases in there, toothpicks in there.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Pictures in.\n\nPETER: Samuel Pemberton.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah.\n\nHe used to play inside left for Southampton.\n\nStill does, doesn't he?\n\nWhen was this, 1790?\n\nHe's got [INAUDIBLE].\n\nPETER: It's a nice little piece of antique silver.\n\nRight.\n\nCome on and hit us with the bad news.\n\n50 PHILIP SERRELL: So what about if you put those two together?\n\nPETER: Which two?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: That one and that one.\n\nNARRATOR: Ah.\n\nPhil has spotted a Scottish snuffbox made of horn, probably cow, with a rather lovely amethyst on the top.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: What's the best you can do for these then?\n\nI could do the two for 90 pounds.\n\nHave you no conscience at all?\n\n- Not very much.\n\n- No.\n\nOK. [INAUDIBLE] If it was up to me, right, I'd pay you whatever you wanted for your stuff, if it was up to me.\n\nYeah.\n\nBut Margaret here, right, she's got a reputation to hold.\n\nHave you seen her on \"The Apprentice\"?\n\nPETER: I have.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Hard.\n\nHard.\n\nPETER: But not in real life.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Oh, no.\n\nShe's lovely.\n\nBut this is not real life.\n\nPussycat, really.\n\nBut the old claws might have to come out.\n\nSee that?\n\nNARRATOR: Meow.\n\nSo come on then, is there a deal to be done?\n\nI think the very best we could do would be 50 quid for the two.\n\nPETER: Would you meet me halfway?\n\n45 because we said 40 to begin with.\n\nNo.\n\nUh.\n\nWell, for the-- are we talking about for the two?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: No.\n\nWe're doing two.\n\n50 quid for the two, aren't we, Margaret?\n\nYeah, and we have to try and make a profit on it.\n\nYeah PETER: 60.\n\nI'll do it for 60.\n\nDid you say 50?\n\nPETER: 60.\n\nLook, Margaret.\n\nWork your charm.\n\nI've never been accused of having charm, I'm afraid.\n\nNARRATOR: Looks like the wooing is up to you then, Phil.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: I've always liked Peter.\n\nI don't know what you think.\n\n- Hm, nice man.\n\nHe's been a genuine, straight bloke, hasn't he?\n\nLovely man.\n\nPeople have said around here what a lovely man he is, haven't they?\n\nReally nice, lovely, kind man.\n\nThat's what they've said about him, haven't they?\n\nYeah.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Do you think they're right, though?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Well, I don't know.\n\nI think we might find out in a minute.\n\nAs long as you don't tell anyone else.\n\nOh, trust me.\n\nNo one is ever going to know.\n\nNARRATOR: No.\n\nWell, I won't tell.\n\nPETER: Shall I put it in a bag?\n\nMargaret, that's a good one.\n\nNARRATOR: You finally got there.\n\nAt 25 pounds each, they've shaved 40 pounds off the asking price.\n\nNow that's what I call doing a deal.\n\nBack in Southampton, Catherine and Nick have hit the road.\n\nSo are you going to win this?\n\nSincerely hope so.\n\nI mean, there are bragging rights involved in this.\n\nOK.\n\nSo we got to win.\n\nThe man who got the better of Margaret Mountford.\n\nThere's a trophy in this.\n\nI think so.\n\nThat would be good.\n\nNARRATOR: He's clearly a man on a mission.\n\nThis afternoon, Catherine and Nick are taking a little bit of a break from shopping.\n\nWhere are we off to?\n\nWe're going to learn all about Spitfires.\n\nOh, really?\n\nYeah.\n\nDo you know anything about Spitfires?\n\nOh, that will be interesting.\n\nThat's wonderful.\n\nIt's the most beautiful aircraft and my father-in-law, as it were, was a Spitfire pilot.\n\nSo this means quite a lot to me.\n\nWhen he died, we hired a Spitfire to fly over their house after the funeral and do a victory roll.\n\nIt was a terribly emotional moment.\n\nThat's lovely.\n\nLovely, yeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, Nick's in for a real treat as they head off to Solent Sky, an aviation museum which houses an array of impressive old aircraft, including two of Southampton's most famous products-- the Supermarine S.6 seaplane, and of course, the superb Spitfire, around 8,000 of which were built in the city.\n\nA symbol of British resistance, the iconic Spitfire was the decisive weapon during World War II and until its retirement from active service in 1954.\n\nAnd its design was thanks to the late, great Reginald Mitchell.\n\nTelling them all about him is Andy.\n\nSo who was he?\n\nWhere did he come from?\n\nHe came from Stoke-on-Trent, and he came down to Southampton in about 1916.\n\nHe'd been trained on the railways up in [INAUDIBLE]..\n\nGoing from big locomotive engines to delicate airplanes must have been quite a difference.\n\nNARRATOR: Within just two years of joining Supermarine, Mitchell was appointed chief designer, and between 1920 and 1936, he designed 24 aircraft, including the single-seat racing seaplane, the S.6.\n\nANDY: When Mitchell penned this, he didn't sit down to say, I want to design a beautiful looking airplane.\n\nEverything about it is function.\n\nSo when you look at this beautiful wing shape, that's the best aerodynamic shape he could come up with.\n\nHm.\n\nANDY: But not only that.\n\nHe made the wings into radiators, so they cool the water.\n\nThese beautiful flutes which run down the side of the aircraft, they cool the oil on the exterior vanes.\n\nAnd the floats underneath, they actually double as fuel tanks, as well.\n\nSo everything on it is functional.\n\nThe majority of the technology that was designed for this aircraft was then taken and put into the early Spitfires.\n\nSo this aircraft is the precursor of the Spitfire.\n\nAnd of course, this when it appeared, was space age to the public [INAUDIBLE] ANDY: Absolutely.\n\nBut you can't tell me that a fully-grown man got into that tiny, tiny cockpit.\n\nANDY: I know.\n\nIt's amazing, isn't it?\n\nI must confess I tried to get in it the other day myself, and I'm not the slimmest of beasts by any means.\n\nI know these chaps would have been a lot thinner than me, but not that thin.\n\nIt must have been absolutely awful.\n\nIt's really quite incredible.\n\nNARRATOR: In 1931, the air ministry invited a selection of the best aircraft manufacturers to compete to develop a new technologically advanced fighter plane.\n\nUsing the lessons he'd learned designing planes such as the S.6, Mitchell went on to win the contract with his innovative and deadly fighter plane, the Supermarine Spitfire.\n\nNICK HEWER: You can see the family resemblance, that's for sure.\n\nVery, very beautiful and very decisive too in the battle.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThe key thing is though, is this streamlined approach to designing the airplane.\n\nSo what Mitchell did was he wanted to work on the aerodynamics as opposed to just having a big engine because the Americans had big, big, fat radial engines and sort of worried about the wings afterwards.\n\nMitchell's approach was to design a thoroughbred streamlined airplane.\n\nAnd these turn?\n\nANDY: That's right NICK HEWER: To alter the pitch or alter the-- So the actual pitch alters on the propeller.\n\nSo when you take off, and you don't want overly too much power, you have a fine pitch so that the thread into the air is finer and gives you a nice smooth takeoff.\n\nBut then, when you're roaring down, attacking a position, you want that coarse pitch, so you shove it over to a coarse pitch with the propeller, and you're really getting maximum power through the engine.\n\nThe design is incredible, isn't it?\n\nHe really did think of everything, didn't he?\n\nANDY: Oh, absolutely all the way through.\n\nI think one of the key things of the Spitfire-- it was such a good-looking aircraft, such an important symbol of what the RAF were doing at the time.\n\nI think from the morale point of view, it was the biggest contribution that she bought during the Battle of Britain.\n\nSo what year did Mitchell die?\n\nMitchell died in 1937, bearing in mind the Spitfire first flew in 1936.\n\nSo Mitchell never got to see the Spitfire he designed enter service into the RAF or take part in the Battle of Britain, which was its finest hour.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: That's really sad actually, isn't it?\n\nThat he didn't actually get to see-- Absolutely CATHERINE SOUTHON: --that in battle.\n\nAbsolutely, and one wonders what he would have done had he not been lost at such an early age.\n\nNARRATOR: Reginald Mitchell, we salute you.\n\nAnd on that patriotic note, it's time to say toodle-pip to the first day of the trip.\n\nNighty night.\n\nThe next morning.\n\nIt's not even 9:00 AM, and already the bickering has begun.\n\nNICK HEWER: But I will tell you one thing.\n\nI'm coming out of the final shop without a penny.\n\nWell, that may not be-- No.\n\nNo.\n\n--the right tactic.\n\nWell, I don't care.\n\nThat's what I'm doing.\n\nHe who dares wins.\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe winner takes all.\n\nUm, any more cliches?\n\nWhat else do we got?\n\nFortune favors the brave.\n\nGive me a timid one that sounds good.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nI can't think of any.\n\n(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Live to fight another day.\n\nHe who laughs last laughs longest.\n\nMaybe that isn't quite, quite apposite.\n\n(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) It's a straight way that has no turnings.\n\nUm.\n\n(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) He digs deepest who deepest digs.\n\nWhere did you get that from?\n\n(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) I don't know.\n\nNARRATOR: Don't let Lord Sugar hear you speak like that.\n\nSilly voices aside, Nick certainly has dug deep when it comes to spending.\n\nHe's forked out 220 pounds on four items-- a pair of trench art vases, a Kentish Town sign, a stained glass window, and gangplank signs from a ship called Aurora, leaving 180 pounds to spend today.\n\nWhereas Margaret hasn't made much of a dent in her 400-pound budget, spending just 70 pounds of it bagging the \"Modern Alphabet\" an MP joke books, a pair of illusion glasses, a small silver case, and a snuffbox.\n\nWhich means she'll have 330 pounds to play with when they arrive at their next stop on the trip, Bath.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So we were in the same shop this morning.\n\nOh, that's going to be a bit of fun, isn't it?\n\nI think it's an antique market.\n\nThat'll be like the boardroom.\n\nThat will be oh.\n\nWe're going to be behind you, sneaking up, making notes.\n\n- Well, that'll be a job-- - Nick's going to be appearing-- --because we'll be behind you.\n\n--with his glasses, making notes.\n\nNARRATOR: The Bath VA, Vintage is held within Green Park Station, which closed in the early '70s, but this Grade II listed building was saved and has been put to good use.\n\nAre we all focused?\n\nReady to go?\n\nThey haven't spent very much money yesterday.\n\nIs the word parsimonious?\n\nIs that the word?\n\n- You're mean.\n\nI know you're mean.\n\n- Yes.\n\nVery mean.\n\n- Canny.\n\nPossibly canny.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Canny, yes.\n\nSo which way are you going to head off?\n\nWe're going that way.\n\nNARRATOR: And they're off.\n\nThis monthly market has an eclectic mix of traders, so plenty of treats for our teams to get their teeth into.\n\n- 600.\n\n- 600?\n\nFor that?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\n- No.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's what you'd give us to take it away?\n\nHave you seen this lady perform?\n\nNARRATOR: Ouch.\n\nWhile Margaret's busy terrifying the traders, Catherine and Nick are getting creative.\n\nHow much is the easel?\n\nThe easel is 75 pounds.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: 75.\n\nI bet this is not the sort of thing you thought you would be looking at on the road?\n\nI didn't, but I appreciate the fact that we knew it would cost a [INAUDIBLE].\n\nIt would cost several hundred, I think, to get something like that.\n\nVENDOR: Several hundred.\n\n300 something.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Yeah.\n\nNICK HEWER: Well I-- no, I'll go along with it actually, and I think-- I mean, obviously 75 pounds is out of the question.\n\n70 pounds.\n\nBottom price.\n\nAnd I'll hold it for you.\n\nWill you hold that price for us for 30 minutes?\n\nYes.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe're not committed to buying it.\n\nOh, that's fair enough.\n\nBut you're going to hold that price stable for 30 minutes.\n\nAnd it's now 11:30.\n\nHe's got the watch.\n\nBy 12 o'clock, we will commit or walk away.\n\n- OK. - OK?\n\nThat's fair enough, yeah.\n\nI am frightened for you, Nick.\n\nNo, please.\n\nI promise that's 30 minutes.\n\nLovely.\n\nNARRATOR: Blimey.\n\nNick certainly doesn't mess about.\n\nNow, shopping in the same place does have its advantages, like spying on the other team.\n\nThey're over there, look.\n\nThey're doing a deal over there.\n\nI can't see what it is, but they've got something.\n\nHe's got a sign.\n\nHe's what?\n\nHe's got a sign.\n\nNot a railway sign?\n\nNo.\n\nNot Kentish Town, is it?\n\nNARRATOR: You'd better hope not.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Oh, I don't like that.\n\nThat's horrible.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: It is, isn't it?\n\nSort of looks like Nick on a bad day, doesn't it?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: It does.\n\nNARRATOR: I'm not sure how being likened to a psychotic character from a horror movie is going to go down with Nick.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Look what we found.\n\nWhat?\n\nI'm not so sure, but you reckon it is, do you?\n\nWhat is this?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Truly horrible.\n\nIt's Jack Nicholson.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: She said it looks like Nick.\n\nNICK HEWER: I'll tell you what.\n\nThe coloring is an absolute match for you.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: You've got the wrinkles and the little chubby-- [SHUSHING] NARRATOR: Ritual humiliation over, Phil needs to get Margaret buying.\n\nI like-- that sign, do you like that?\n\nI like that German shoe sign, yeah.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Very prewar German, isn't it?\n\nHow much is that poster?\n\nWell, the very, very best price is 20 pounds.\n\nI think that's all right, don't you?\n\nOnly the shoemaker master warrants-- And what's your best?\n\n20.\n\n20 pounds.\n\nAnd that's it, finished?\n\nIt is finished, yeah.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt is fragile.\n\nI warn you.\n\nNARRATOR: So that's another lot bought by Margaret.\n\nHow's Catherine coping with her genial companion?\n\nI can't believe him.\n\nHe's got a-- he's got a stick now.\n\nHe's quite frightening.\n\nHe really means business with this.\n\nNARRATOR: Ah.\n\nHe's found a swagger stick, a symbol of military authority.\n\nStand easy, Sergeant Hewer.\n\nNow, what's Phil found?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Solid, isn't it?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Let's go.\n\nCan we have a look at this?\n\nNow I've got a problem here-- Go on then.\n\n--and this is the problem because Margaret does not like that chest.\n\nBOTH: Oh!\n\nNARRATOR: Neither does Phil by the look of it.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Right.\n\nThat doesn't help, does it?\n\nAnd that's that.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Does that make it worth more or less?\n\nIt's, um-- well, it's put a price on it, that is for sure.\n\nIf we give you a one-off offer.\n\nYeah, if you're generous.\n\n35 quid, because-- 45 was my-- Well, it was going to be 45 until the end came off.\n\nAnd I won't charge you for the damage.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: What do you think, Margaret?\n\nI think it's 35.\n\nYou see, we've got to get it in the van.\n\nIt's just going to be problematic.\n\nOh, what a gentleman.\n\n- You're a good chap.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Thank you very much.\n\n- That all right.\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Let me just pay you.\n\nNARRATOR: So a spot of sweet-talking has got them the 19th-century pine chest.\n\nNICK HEWER: You have a second?\n\nHe's busy with us, actually.\n\nWhat does that say about you?\n\nIt says, be careful.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI mean, he means business.\n\nIf we don't get our way, he's going to be very cross today.\n\nYes, but you don't have to humor him, you know.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: You don't have to humor him.\n\nI like-- what is-- the expression isn't all mouth and no trousers, is it?\n\nBut it's something like that.\n\nAll [INAUDIBLE] and no [INAUDIBLE]??\n\nWhat is it?\n\nNARRATOR: Now, now, children.\n\nPlay nice.\n\nNICK HEWER: Now come on, what about this easel?\n\nShall we deal with the easel?\n\nWe actually have 60 pounds here in my pocket, and we're very happy to do a deal and walk away.\n\nI think that's fair.\n\nIf you fancy that, I think it's less than a 10% discount.\n\nI'll take the stick off you first.\n\n65 pounds is my last offer.\n\nDo I put that back?\n\nI've now got the stick.\n\nI'm going to give the stick to you.\n\n65 pounds.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Does it come with all the paint?\n\nThe paint pots and the brushes and-- VENDOR: Yes, it does.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: --everything else.\n\nVENDOR: Yes, it does.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: And everything else in the shop.\n\nNo Sold.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd this?\n\nNo.\n\nThat's an extra 5 pounds, Nick.\n\nThis is a swagger stick?\n\nIt's a proper leather-covered covered swagger stick, yeah.\n\nWhat's inside?\n\nA cane.\n\nIs it a cane?\n\nIt's a cane, yeah.\n\nWhat are you going to do with that?\n\nWhy do we want this?\n\nWell, we can work it in with the trench art.\n\nTrench art.\n\nGood.\n\nLove it.\n\nNARRATOR: I like your style, Nick.\n\nPlease, could we have them all at 68?\n\nYes, you can.\n\nIt's good.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you.\n\nNARRATOR: That final commando swoop got the swagger stick for 3 pounds, and the easel, and, um, paint pots, and brushes for 65 pounds.\n\nLooks like the other team has spotted a potential purchase too.\n\nVENDOR: Uh, I can do that one for 18.\n\nWhat have we got we can put that with?\n\nHow much did you say?\n\n18.\n\n18 quid.\n\nCan we put that with something?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWell, it's a mobile foot, isn't it?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- A model foot.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] It could be a good doorstop.\n\nBlast.\n\nI thought that was rolling downhill then.\n\nCould you take 15 quid for it?\n\nVENDOR: Yeah.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: What do you want to do?\n\nI think we should put it with the poster.\n\nThat'll do.\n\nWith a load of old cobblers.\n\nPay the man, please.\n\nNARRATOR: So that's deal done and shopping complete for Margaret and Phil, who have spent a total of 140 pounds, less than Nick and Catherine spent in their first shop.\n\nThere's time now for a bit of exploring.\n\nThat Margaret is one smart cookie.\n\nShe recently completed her PhD in papyrology.\n\nThat's the study of ancient documents to you and me.\n\nAnd as luck would have it, the historic city of Bath has some rather fascinating Roman artifacts that I know will tickle her fancy.\n\nSo they're heading off to the Roman Baths.\n\nDating back to around 60 AD, this is one of the most significant sites of archaeological interest in the whole country.\n\nThe baths are a major tourist attraction, with more than a million visitors flocking to the bubbling waters of the sacred spring every year.\n\nNow, it may look like it's boiling, but it's actually natural gases being released, a bit like opening a bottle of fizzy pop.\n\nThe Romans believed this natural phenomenon to be the work of ancient gods.\n\nThe temple was dedicated to the goddess Sulis Minerva, and the water was said to be both nourishing and life giving, as well as being an effective agent of curses.\n\nIn Roman Britain, the baths were an exclusive luxury reserved for only the most rich and powerful.\n\nWhen they were excavated 35 years ago, they uncovered some amazing artifacts, as manager Stephen explains.\n\nIt was found that all sorts of things had been thrown in as votive offerings.\n\nA lot of coins, 12,500, but also something very special and curious, which are the Roman curse tablets-- Ah.\n\n--from Bath, which are small sheets of lead or pewter that have had a message to the goddess inscribed on them, and they're then rolled or folded and thrown into the spring.\n\nAnd what they are are their prayers.\n\nThey are asking the goddess to intervene, usually because the person has suffered some sort of wrong-- very often had something stolen.\n\nAnd they're looking for the goddess' help in retrieving the goods, but not for them.\n\nThey're being retrieved for the goddess.\n\nTo give her an interest in doing it.\n\nYes.\n\nI think so.\n\nNARRATOR: There are 130 curse tablets, each with their own message scratched into the metal in Latin.\n\nDating from the second to the fourth century, they highlight the type of skulduggery that took place back in Roman times, mainly good old-fashioned thievery.\n\nA lot of the curses talk about things that are fairly modest objects.\n\nArchimedes, who lost two gloves, ask that the person who had stolen them should lose both his mind and his eyes.\n\nSo it was worth his while going to the trouble of writing all that out for two gloves.\n\nThis is one wishing blindness, childlessness, and ill-health on someone, but we don't know what the crime is because that bit's missing.\n\nAnd this one is particularly relevant to the Roman Baths because this is someone who's lost a bathing tunic.\n\nAt which point did people think, actually, these aren't working.\n\nWell, they go out of use in about the fifth century AD.\n\nThat's when they stop being used.\n\nThis may be due to Christian influence.\n\nWe don't know.\n\nBut we don't know that they didn't work, do we?\n\nUh, no.\n\nI suppose not, but I'm sort of kind of thinking if they did, we'd still be chucking them in, wouldn't we?\n\n[INAUDIBLE] Well, people are-- you go past any fountain that you see.\n\nThere's all sorts of-- well, not curses, but people are throwing coins into fountains, aren't they?\n\nWhat on Earth are they doing that for?\n\nSee, the sad thing is that in my world, things sort of tend to have to have values.\n\nI mean, where would you stand with these?\n\nAre they worth hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands?\n\nWell, it's an interesting point because, to my knowledge, none has ever been sold.\n\nWell, I don't think we'd have got any for 400 pounds to put in our auction.\n\nNo.\n\nI think the way you go on, Margaret, you could probably have negotiated your way around one of these.\n\nNARRATOR: So as Phil has neatly brought us back to the subject of shopping, half a mile away.\n\nSergeant Hewer and Second-in-command Catherine have come to Caroline's antique shop armed with their remaining 112 pounds.\n\n[LAUGHING] NICK HEWER: Why are you laughing?\n\nWell, it looks-- At my bowler.\n\n--comical.\n\nWhat?\n\nCAROLINE: It looks very comical.\n\nOh.\n\nNARRATOR: And surprise, surprise, it's another sign that's turned their heads.\n\nYour Lyons' Tea sign.\n\nCAROLINE: Oh, the Lyons' Tea sign.\n\nUm, that would be 130 pound.\n\nRight.\n\nNICK HEWER: What would your best price be, Caroline?\n\nWell, us poor shopkeepers-- you know, it's a hard life.\n\nNo, I shall come down to 110, but that really is my rock bottom, truly.\n\nCan I take my advisor, who knows everything, just for a walk around the shop, and we'll come back with an answer.\n\nCAROLINE: Little chat.\n\nNICK HEWER: Little chat.\n\nNARRATOR: I think Nick's met his match in Caroline.\n\nI would be happy to buy that at 60, 80 pounds, but she's not going to go anywhere now.\n\nNICK HEWER: She's not moving, is she?\n\nI fear you could be right there, Catherine.\n\nLook, I'll tell you what.\n\n100 for the sign, and then you can run away.\n\n100 for the sign?\n\nShould we toss, yes or no?\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: No.\n\nI think we need to make a decision that we're comfortable with.\n\nNICK HEWER: Catherine, I am tossing for it.\n\nHold my stick.\n\nCAROLINE: Oh, you're in control now.\n\nCan we go for 95?\n\nNo.\n\nThere we go.\n\nLook.\n\nHeads.\n\nWe buy it.\n\nThere you go.\n\n100 pounds.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: On its heads.\n\nIt's on my head.\n\nNARRATOR: The sale might be down to Nick, but it looks like the dirty work is being left to poor old Catherine.\n\nWhat about over here?\n\nGive me a chance to get that.\n\nThat's what I said about scratching.\n\nNICK HEWER: Yeah.\n\nWell, that's enamel.\n\nThat's there.\n\nBut look at that.\n\nThat comes off, and that looks lovely.\n\nYou see?\n\nDo you want to do some?\n\nMy scrubbing days are over.\n\nA bit more elbow grease at the bottom.\n\nYou're a real taskmaster, aren't you?\n\nI bet Margaret's not doing this.\n\nI don't think so for a minute.\n\nNARRATOR: Signs scrubbed to Sergeant Hewer's satisfaction, the shopping is complete, and it's off to Sham Castle, overlooking Bath.\n\nThe perfect spot for our teams to compare their treasures.\n\nOh, they've been around scrap metal shops, haven't they?\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: You are just horrible, Philip.\n\nSo I don't love you anymore.\n\nNARRATOR: Don't fall out now, folks.\n\nLyons' Tea.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Did we not finish yet?\n\nIt needs [INAUDIBLE] of old paint on it.\n\nTrench art made in the trenches of the Somme.\n\nOh yes?\n\nWe've got more.\n\nMore?\n\nI think you probably should have stopped.\n\nWe've got an Underground sign.\n\nOK. OK. How much was your Lyons' Tea sign?\n\nHow much do you think we would have paid for that?\n\nFiver.\n\nNo.\n\nWe'd gone 40 quid for that.\n\n- In that state?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nWe'd have gone definitely 40 quid.\n\nThat's the tea that makes it genuine.\n\nThat's 100 pounds worth of trade.\n\nThat's going to go out for maybe 180 pounds.\n\nIs that right?\n\nRight.\n\nOK. And how much was the easel?\n\nThe easel was a particularly good buy.\n\nHe's deluded.\n\nRescued from the studio perhaps of Lucian Freud.\n\nWe're not absolutely sure about that.\n\nAbsolutely, completely deluded.\n\nAnd the pots and the brushes.\n\nAnd the pots and the brushes?\n\nOh, well.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: 65.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: That makes a huge difference.\n\nNARRATOR: Oh, let's see what you've got then, Margaret.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, come along.\n\nIs that it?\n\nNARRATOR: I don't think he's impressed.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: They were a fiver.\n\n- Why are they wonderful?\n\n- How much did you spend?\n\nThey were five pounds.\n\nYou said he was mean.\n\n- Parsimonious is the word.\n\n- Mean.\n\nMean.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- We were careful.\n\n- Careful.\n\n- OK. PHILIP SERRELL: We've got a lovely little etui, silver.\n\nEtui?\n\n- 25.\n\n- Is it an etui-- 25 for it.\n\nOr is it a vesta case?\n\nNo, it's not a vesta.\n\n25 P?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: For 25 pounds.\n\nNICK HEWER: Can I pick this up?\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo this has got-- You said he was mean, mean, mean.\n\nSamuel Pemberton.\n\nDon't break it.\n\nThat is beautifully chased.\n\nNo, it's lovely.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Look at this.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Oh, yeah.\n\nWe saw that.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: This is Margaret's lot.\n\nLook.\n\n- This is mine.\n\nA load of old cobblers, this is.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: And the lovely shoe with it.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Shoe.\n\nwas 15, and the poster was 20.\n\n35 quid that was.\n\nYou impressed?\n\nRight, come on then.\n\nInteresting NARRATOR: Banter aside, what do they really think of the competition?\n\nWhat do you reckon?\n\nMean comes to mind.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's all a bit quirky, their stuff, isn't it?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, I like quirky, and I like their things.\n\nBut if they spent nearly 350, 400 pounds on that lot, I think they've spent a lot of money on things that perhaps I wouldn't have bought for that sort of money.\n\nTell me we'll win, Catherine.\n\nI'm not that confident now because they spent so little.\n\nI'll never hear the end of it.\n\nOverall, I think we've done OK, you know.\n\nOh, I hope so.\n\nI'm relying on you.\n\nCome on.\n\nWell done.\n\nYou've been top dollar, and I've absolutely thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI've enjoyed it too.\n\nReally, really good fun.\n\nIt's been fun, and I hope we win.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, we'll soon find out as we're heading for auction.\n\nThe teams have taken a 230 miles shopping trip starting in Southampton and motoring towards Cambridge for the big finale.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: So predictions for the auction.\n\nOh, I think you'll win, hands down.\n\nDo you?\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause we just went all out and spent everything.\n\nSo is Cambridge ready for painted easels and ropey old trunks?\n\nWhat do you reckon?\n\nYeah.\n\nI think they are.\n\nI'm not sure Nick will be when he knows the result.\n\nAnyway, here goes.\n\nNARRATOR: Cambridge is home to one of the top 10 universities of the world and is where Margaret herself studied in her youth.\n\nOur teams' treasures will be going under the hammer at Cheffins Auction House, and Charles Ashton will be the man with the gavel.\n\nSo what does he make of our celebrities' lots?\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: A place like Cambridge is always full of undergraduate students, collectors, academics, so I'm hoping that something like maybe that little silver case might just appeal to one of the sort of Cambridge collectors.\n\nWe were a little bit dubious when we saw the artist easel.\n\nWe're possibly a little bit skeptical about its chances, but you never know.\n\nIt's an auction.\n\nAnything can happen.\n\nNARRATOR: Nick and Catherine began their road trip with 400 pounds and spent a bold 388 pounds on six lots, while Margaret and Phil spent just 140 pounds, also on a total of 6 lots.\n\nFirst to the auction are Margaret and Nick.\n\nSo get the seats in.\n\nCATHERINE SOUTHON: Oh, you approach in style.\n\nNARRATOR: Catherine and Phil arrive just as the weather takes a turn for the worst.\n\nLet's hope the auction isn't going to be a washout.\n\nBetter make a dash for it, Catherine.\n\nHello, Margaret.\n\nHow are you?\n\nHow are you?\n\nHow are we looking?\n\nCan we all squeeze in?\n\nWe can all squeeze in.\n\nYou can park that big backside in there somewhere.\n\nWe're all squeezing in here.\n\nThat's optimistic, that is.\n\nIs it to test this piece of furniture?\n\nNARRATOR: Settle down, chaps.\n\nThe auction is about to begin.\n\nWell, it's like going to the pictures, isn't it?\n\nYes.\n\nNARRATOR: Let's hope it's as entertaining, Nick.\n\nFirst up are Margaret's MP joke book and alphabet book.\n\n30 pounds [INAUDIBLE].\n\n30 pounds [INAUDIBLE].\n\nBe brave.\n\n25 then.\n\nCome along.\n\n25 Good lord.\n\nWhoo.\n\nGo get in, Margaret.\n\n25 bid.\n\nNow 25 in the room it is.\n\nAt 25 bid, now.\n\n25 it is.\n\n25 and 30 to the back.\n\nThen it's 30.\n\n30 bid now, sir?\n\n35.\n\nSo 35.\n\nThat won't buy it.\n\n35 is on my right.\n\n- He's sunk.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: [AUCTIONEER CHANT] Trying to hold my jaw up.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: Rooms out elsewhere at 35 pounds, and I shall sell by the cabinets over here at 35 pounds then.\n\nWhose choice was this?\n\nMine.\n\nMargaret's.\n\nWell, well done, Margaret.\n\nNARRATOR: Great start to the auction, giving Margaret a healthy lead.\n\nWell, that's a bit of a relief, isn't it?\n\n[INAUDIBLE] right now.\n\nNARRATOR: Next up is Nick's militaria with the trench art vases and his beloved leather swagger stick, but uh-oh.\n\nIt's missing from the auction picture.\n\n- Where's the swagger stick?\n\n- Where's the swagger stick?\n\nYou're going to start me around about 30 pounds for those to start off, I would have thought.\n\nPut them in, 30 pound, to get on with it.\n\nThank you, Ray.\n\nA 30.\n\nI'm bidding the room now at 30.\n\nI'm over there.\n\nAt 30, I'm bidding now.\n\n30.\n\n30 bid.\n\n- We need more than 30.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm bidding now at 30 bid.\n\nNow 30.\n\nI'll take the 5 more.\n\n35 is here.\n\n35 and 40 in the room.\n\nWho's bidding for it?\n\nNow 40, 45.\n\nWhoops.\n\nI'm flying around here at the excitement.\n\n45 here.\n\nBid now 45.\n\nAnd 50 over there.\n\nNow 50 bid.\n\nNow 50.\n\nIn the room it is at 50 [AUCTIONEER CHANT] 50 in the room.\n\nAnd it ends out at 50 pounds, and I shall sell the-- Bit more.\n\nBit more.\n\nCome on.\n\nAll done then, away there.\n\nNobody else?\n\nWe'll finish at 50 pounds.\n\nRight at 50.\n\nBut where's the swagger stick?\n\nIf the swagger stick had been in there-- made hundreds.\n\nI thought thousands, Millions, I thought actually, millions.\n\nNARRATOR: Yeah right.\n\nA strong start for Nick too.\n\nWe have a competition.\n\nCan I have my swagger stick?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: No.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: No.\n\n- No.\n\nYou swagger enough.\n\nYou don't need a stick.\n\nNARRATOR: Right, you told them.\n\nTime for Margaret's pair of 19th-century illusion glasses.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: 30 pounds will start me.\n\n25 then.\n\n25 twice over.\n\n25 standing.\n\nI took 25 there.\n\nAt 25, bid now 25.\n\nAt 30 there.\n\nBid now 30.\n\n35 sir.\n\n35 bid now.\n\n35 pound.\n\n35. Who else is coming in?\n\nWho can I tempt?\n\nAnybody else at 35 pounds?\n\nAll done, then?\n\nSeen enough.\n\nI shall sell then.\n\nGod, I feel sick in my stomach.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: Yours, sir.\n\nMore profit for you.\n\nNARRATOR: Much to Nick's disgust, that nice little result pushes Margaret further into the lead.\n\nIt's Nick's Aurora gangplank signs next, and he's far from optimistic.\n\nWill you be cross with me, Nick?\n\nI could never be cross with you, Catherine.\n\nI'd be disappointed.\n\nI feel like you're my teacher.\n\nIt will say, could do better on your report card.\n\nNo.\n\nIt would [INAUDIBLE] must do better.\n\nNARRATOR: No pressure then, Catherine.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: 30 pounds.\n\n30 I'm bid down here.\n\nThank you.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm bid now.\n\n30 bid now.\n\n30.\n\nAt 30 bid.\n\nAt 30.\n\nAt 35 now.\n\n35, fresh blood.\n\n35.\n\nAnd 40.\n\nI'm bid 50.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] 60 in the room, bid now.\n\n60, bid now.\n\n60.\n\nWell done.\n\n[AUCTIONEER CHANT] I knew there was something in it.\n\nNARRATOR: Pants on fire.\n\nAny more interest or anywhere else at 60.\n\nI'm bid at 60.\n\nThey're begging over here.\n\n- No, I'm not.\n\nAnyone bid at all?\n\n60 pounds.\n\nHere's your opportunity.\n\nWhere are you?\n\nWe need you.\n\nThe hammer falls then at 60 pounds.\n\nAll done then at 60.\n\nNot for lack of trying.\n\nWell, you did OK. OK. We made a tenner.\n\nI could do better.\n\nNARRATOR: Catherine's got to be relieved about that little profit.\n\nI actually can't bear to see it.\n\nFeels like on a date at the cinema.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nNARRATOR: Hands to yourself, Hewer, and pay attention because it's your art nouveau stained glass panel up now.\n\nIt's upside down.\n\nNARRATOR: Well, on its side, actually.\n\n--something for that.\n\n30 pounds then.\n\nLittle [INAUDIBLE] art nouveau panel.\n\nGlass.\n\nLeaded glass.\n\n20 then, 20 pounds.\n\n20 pounds on my left.\n\nA bid now at 20.\n\nAnd 5.\n\nAt 25.\n\nAnd 30.\n\n30.\n\n30 pounds.\n\nThe bid's behind me now.\n\nAt 30 bid then.\n\nShe shakes the head.\n\nAt 30 bid now.\n\n30 bid.\n\n30.\n\n35, new place.\n\n35.\n\nNo, sir.\n\nThank you.\n\nHold.\n\n35 bid now.\n\nThe bid's online now.\n\nAt 35 bid now.\n\n35 it is.\n\nThe single panel.\n\nNobody else tempted at all?\n\nBut 35 pounds then.\n\nSold.\n\nI think it was badly shown there.\n\nPHILIP SERRELL: Doesn't help, does it?\n\nIt's the wrong way up.\n\nThat didn't help.\n\nNARRATOR: I think even Margaret's starting to feel sorry for Nick.\n\nNot that he's interested.\n\nI don't want you two to fall out over this because you've been friends a long time.\n\nIt's a very superficial friendship.\n\nYes.\n\nDoesn't take much, does it?\n\nNARRATOR: Back to your corners, you two.\n\nAs it's time for the next lot, Margaret's Scottish horn snuffbox with the amethyst on top.\n\nI can begin at 20 pound for this.\n\nAlready bid now at 20 bid now.\n\nAt 20 bid now.\n\n20 bid down.\n\n20.\n\nAnybody else now?\n\nAt 25.\n\nAt 25 bid now.\n\n25 pounds.\n\n25 to bid now.\n\nAt 25.\n\nAnd 30.\n\n30 bid now.\n\n30.\n\nNow it's your turn to come in.\n\nAt 35 bid now.\n\n35 to bid now.\n\n35 it is.\n\n35 pound.\n\nNobody else want it at all?\n\nAt 35, all done then.\n\n40 bid now.\n\n40.\n\nAt 40 bid now.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] 40 pounds [INAUDIBLE].\n\n40 pounds, but nevertheless here we are.\n\nWe shall sell then away at 40 pounds.\n\nAt 40.\n\nNARRATOR: Another tidy profit there for Margaret.\n\nExcellent.\n\nIf you'd have seen the work that went into buying that lot, the effort.\n\nThe time that it took.\n\nIt was like a war of attrition.\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Nick sure needs to do well with his Kentish Town Underground sign.\n\nCome on now, mind the gap.\n\n20, 25, 30 bid to start here.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm bid now for Kentish Town enamel sign.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm bid now.\n\n30 bid to start it off.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm bid now.\n\n30 bid now.\n\n30.\n\n35 over there.\n\n35 and 40.\n\n45.\n\nThe bids with me now.\n\nAt 50 bid now.\n\n50, with the 50.\n\nSomewhere to go.\n\nAt 50 and 60, 70.\n\nAt 70 bid now.\n\n70 bid now, 70.\n\nAt 70 bid now.\n\n70 bid now.\n\n70.\n\nWhere have you all gone now?\n\nThe Kentish Town enamel sign at 70 pounds.\n\nAny more or not?\n\nAt 70 and 80.\n\n80 bid now.\n\n80.\n\nAnother bidder.\n\n80.\n\nI'm bid at 80.\n\nI'm bid at 80.\n\nSomebody very key to Kentish Town supporter's club here.\n\nAt 80 pounds and all done then.\n\nI shall sell.\n\nFinished with then.\n\n80.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: All done then.\n\nA bit more than 80.\n\nThat's unlucky, that is.\n\nThat is just really unlucky.\n\n- Just-- - Unlucky.\n\n- --not getting it I'm not interested in unlucky.\n\nWe're going down here.\n\nNARRATOR: If Lord Sugar was here, you know what he'd be saying, Nick.\n\nI feel that we've been encased in concrete and thrown out of a window.\n\nI think you've increased yourself in concrete and jumped, actually.\n\nNARRATOR: Don't get too cocky, Margaret.\n\nIt's your lot next.\n\nThe German shoemaker's poster from 1930 and the 19th-century Elm shoe last.\n\nI've got no idea.\n\nWill you tell me, who wants to bid me on these?\n\n- 18 pounds.\n\n- 30 pounds.\n\nA real bygone lot.\n\n30 pounds.\n\nThank you, Barbara in the corner.\n\nAt 30.\n\nI'm in the corner.\n\n30's in now.\n\n30 bid now.\n\n30.\n\n30 I have bid now.\n\nI'll take the five more.\n\nAnybody else coming in?\n\nAt 30 pounds.\n\nAll done then at 30 pounds then.\n\nNARRATOR: Margaret's first loss, but she's still well out in front of Nick.\n\nDon't let's burst into tears over it.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nWe're not that upset, actually.\n\nNow I know what you feel like.\n\nBad luck.\n\nNARRATOR: Now for the artist's double-picture easel with paint pots and brushes, which auctioneer Charles has reservations about, and it looks like Nick does too.\n\nI don't think it's going to do anything-- just got a feeling.\n\nThere we are.\n\nAnother curiosity lot here.\n\nCuriosity?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nCouldn't say it better myself.\n\nRoll 148 is the artist's easel, complete with the original paint.\n\nI don't see it.\n\nEight pounds.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: We don't often get them with the brushes as well, so it's a-- now's your chance.\n\nAnyway, a bit of interest I have to start off at 30, 35, 40, and bid to begin.\n\nAt 40.\n\nI'm bid to start off.\n\nAt 40 bid now.\n\nAt 40 bid.\n\nAt 45.\n\nWe paid 65.\n\nAnd 60, 70, 80.\n\nOh, thank the lord.\n\nWhew.\n\nKnew we had done something with it.\n\nWell done.\n\nHave faith.\n\n110.\n\n120.\n\nCome on.\n\nYou were right.\n\nYou were right.\n\nWell done.\n\nCHARLES ASHTON: --come all this way, you know.\n\nAt 120 pounds.\n\nThe bid's a mere 120.\n\nOne more might do it.\n\n130.\n\nBack in at-- NARRATOR: Well, who'd have thought it?\n\nPay attention.\n\nYou just romped ahead here.\n\nWe've doubled.\n\nWe've doubled.\n\nYou've romped ahead.\n\n130 I shall sell then.\n\nRight left-handed at 130.\n\nYes.\n\nWell done, Catherine, well done.\n\nNARRATOR: Thanks to Catherine's smart choice, you're back in the game, Nick.\n\nJust shows actually, Margaret, that I've got no idea about anything, Neither have I.\n\nYou are an excellent company, the pair of you.\n\nYou are fantastic.\n\nNARRATOR: Time for Margaret's penultimate lot.\n\nThe 19th-century Dutch pine trunk that Phil broke [SHUSHING].\n\nDon't tell anyone.\n\n50 pounds.\n\n30.\n\n30 pounds.\n\n30 I'm bid Somebody will bid me at that.\n\n30 I'm bid across the room.\n\nAt 30,

in a profit, hasn't it?\n\nIt's eked a bit, but I'd of paid more than that for it.\n\nIts firewood would be worth more than that.\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: Not sure about that, Margaret.\n\nBut still, a profit's a profit.\n\nTime for Nick's final lot.\n\nThe 1950s Lyons' Tea enamel sign.\n\nBought on the toss of a coin, Nick said this would be on his head, remember?\n\nIf I've learned anything in this ramble around England, it's that I'd lose my shirt if I went into this business.\n\nNo idea what I'm doing.\n\n100 pound with that.\n\n100.\n\nYou tell me.\n\n50 pounds then.\n\nPut me in for

else?\n\n- Internet?\n\nAt 110.\n\nBid there out, I'm afraid.\n\nBid 110 pounds.\n\nAt 110.\n\nI think it's a good price at 110.\n\nAll done.\n\nBid 110 pounds then.\n\nI think we get more.\n\nYou think that's awful?\n\nNARRATOR: So his big gamble paid off.\n\nBut it's not over yet for Margaret.\n\nThere's still her silver Samuel Pemberton case to go.\n\n50 pound for that.\n\nI'd love that for 50.\n\nPut me in for that.\n\nThe case, silver case.\n\n50 [INAUDIBLE].\n\n40.\n\n40.\n\nI'm bid down here at 40.\n\nThank you.\n\nAt 40 on bid now.\n\n40 bid At 40.\n\nAt 45 bid now.\n\n45.\n\nAt

thought we'd got more than that.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, well done.\n\nIt sort of deserves to be worth more.\n\nThat's really interesting.\n\nYeah.\n\nNARRATOR: That's very gracious of you, Nick.\n\nTime to find out who is the winner.\n\nNick and Catherine started with 400 pounds and spent big, blowing almost all of it.\n\nUnfortunately, after auction costs, they made a loss of 6 pounds 70 P. So they end the trip with 393 pounds and 30 P. Margaret and Phil also started with 400 pounds and spent less than half the budget.\n\nA canny move, it turns out, as they made a profit of 56 pounds 80 P, meaning they finish with 456 pounds and 80 P, making them the rightful winners.\n\nAll profits will go to Children in Need.\n\nSo with that result, it means Nick and Catherine, you're fired.\n\nOh dear.\n\nIt's the end of a beautiful relationship.\n\nIt's not a beautiful day.\n\nIt's been jolly good fun.\n\nIt's been great.\n\nThank you.\n\nWell done.\n\nWell done, you.\n\nI enjoyed it.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] here.\n\nYou drive.\n\nYou won.\n\nRighty-o.\n\nSame old story.\n\nNICK HEWER: What breaks my heart is that somebody waltzed off with my swagger stick.\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: I'll buy you one for Christmas.\n\nNICK HEWER: Anyway, good sport, Margaret.\n\nAre we going to do it again?\n\nMARGARET MOUNTFORD: Will they ask us?\n\nNARRATOR: I'm sure you high rollers will be welcome back any old time.\n\nCheerio.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
