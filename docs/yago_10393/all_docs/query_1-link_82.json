        "text": "Mark Ryes alongside the cadre of voice actors have each recorded a minute of Lewis Carroll’s Alice Through the Looking Glass for an audiobook which will be released one chapter at a time as a series of podcasts during December.\n\nAmong the celebrities taking part are Phyllis Logan, Downton Abbey’s head housekeeper Mrs Hughes, and Pirates of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally.\n\nREAD MORE: Peter Hitchens shares his journey of 'becoming the story'\n\nMr Ryes, 53, is taking part because his family has been affected by cancer, with his father having had prostate cancer.\n\n“It was so lovely to take part in this project, and even though I’m only one very small part of the final piece.\n\n\"I hope by the end of it, we will have played a small but important part in raising more money to help prevent, diagnose and treat cancer,” said Mr Reyes.\n\nThe project is the brainchild of three-time cancer survivor Brad Shaw, who was first diagnosed with stage three skin cancer, then prostate cancer, followed by the return of skin cancer.\n\nFollowing his first diagnosis Mr Shaw came up with the idea of ‘The Wonderland Challenge’, inviting fellow actors to record an audiobook of Alice in Wonderland to raise money for the NHS.\n\nAmong those taking part were actors Michael Palin, Dame Juliet Stevenson, Ruth Jones and Dame Harriet Walter.\n\nNow, almost three years later, Mr Shaw, 59, is about to launch The Wonderland Challenge 2 – Alice Through the Looking Glass audiobook – to raise money for Cancer Research UK.\n\nMr Shaw said: \"I’ve had cancer three times now, but I’m alive and cancer free.\n\n\"So, I decided to do the Wonderland project again as my way of saying thank you, for the treatment I’ve had and to everyone who has helped save my life.\n\n“This time I have split the book into 174 one-minute chunks with each actor, voice actor or celebrity recording one minute each and donating at least £10 to Cancer Research UK.\n\n“I’m really grateful to Mark Reyes and all the others involved for their time and their support.”\n\nBritish film actor Kevin McNally features as the first voice in chapter three, and made a “generous donation.”\n\nHe said: “Such a pleasure to be part of this wonderfully entertaining fundraiser again. Well done Mr Shaw.”\n\nDonations have surpassed £4,660.\n\nCadena Sampson, relationship executive for Cancer Research UK, said: “We’re delighted Mr Shaw and his colleagues are putting all this time and energy into the Wonderland 2 project to raise money for Cancer Research UK and our goal of finding better and kinder treatments for all types of cancer.”\n\nRead more from this author\n\nThis story was written by Matthew Norman, he joined the team in 2022 as a Facebook community reporter.\n\nMatthew covers Bicester and focuses on finding stories from diverse communities.\n\nGet in touch with him by emailing: Matthew.norman@newsquest.co.uk\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @OxMailMattN1"
