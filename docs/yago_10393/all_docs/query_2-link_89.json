        "text": "LOS ANGELES (WKRC) - The actor best known for his role as Joshamee Gibbs, the first mate of Jack Sparrow in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" has been arrested over domestic abuse claims.\n\n67-year-old British actor Kevin McNally was arrested on his way to the world's biggest Dr. Who convention in Los Angeles.\n\nMcNally was arrested early Friday morning. Originally, fans were told he wouldn't be attending due to personal reasons, but it was later revealed it was due to his arrest.\n\nPolice said that McNally was arrested on suspicion that he \"inflicted an injury that caused a traumatic condition on a victim who was his current or former spouse, cohabitant, or child's parent.\"\n\nHe has since been released on bail.\n\nPolice haven't released any more information about the alleged victim of the attack, citing confidentiality rules, according to The Sun.\n\nMcNally was not yet publicly commented on the arrest while\n\nIn 2021, McNally defended Johnny Depp when he was accused of beating up his ex-girlfriend Amber Heard,\n\nAt the time McNally said this about Depp:\n\n\"I've never seen a hint of a dark side to him.I see a great humanitarian and a beautiful human being. I don't see any impediment for him coming back and playing Jack Sparrow.\"\n\nMcNally is due back in court in March."
