        "text": "Daily Mail - 16th September 2005\n\nBy Kate Ginn\n\nIT is her utterly convincing portrayal of a haughty English aristocrat that sticks in the memory when you think of Phyllis Logan. Even now, years later, the actress still gets stopped in the street by fans who recognise the striking looks that graced Lovejoy.\n\nBut the familiarity invariably ends when she opens her mouth. For instead of the plummy, upper-class tones of Lady Jane Felsham, the voice is unexpectedly, but very definitely, Scottish.\n\nMany viewers may have believed Phyllis was indeed an English blueblood, but she was, in fact, brought up in the Renfrewshire town of Johnstone. Her upbringing still flows through her veins.\n\nShe says: 'Lady Jane was the antithesis of what I am and I suppose many people do get a bit of a shock when confronted with me in the flesh.\n\n' I don' t talk like Lady Jane and I certainly don't look like her. I'm a very down-to-earth person, which is something I have probably inherited from my Scottish, working class background.' Phyllis left Lady Jane and Lovejoy behind in 1994 after nine years and almost 50 episodes of the will they/won't they romance with the roguish antiques dealer, played by Ian McShane.\n\nShe has no regrets about the decision, based on her wish to stretch herself in other parts. But the role she was to find herself playing just two years later was one she had never quite imagined - that of being a mother.\n\nEmbracing motherhood at the age of 40 with the arrival of son Davey was to be a turning point in her life.\n\nShe says: 'I didn't have that much ambition to begin with but what I had has probably diminished since my son came along. My life has opened up in so many different ways.\n\n'Things like going on tour, doing a lot of theatre work and filming abroad are out of the question. I sort of put all that on the backburner to get on with motherhood.' At the same time, the offers of work were falling away. 'My career taking a back seat is partly due to becoming a mother and partly, due to the fact that, not to bang on about it, but when you're female and you get to a certain age, the parts do dry up, it has to be said.\n\n'But that is just the nature of the beast, I'm not bitter or twisted about it.' Not that she has entirely been absent from our screens. At 49, she remains one of our most versatile of actresses, appearing in such diverse productions as Rab C Nesbitt and Jane Austen.\n\nShe has played everything from a hard-bitten Glasgow Labour MP to a squadron leader fighting off an attack of aliens in the BBC drama Invasion Earth.\n\nIn the near future, she will be appearing in episodes of Sea of Souls and Spooks on BBC1.\n\nON Sunday, she will appear in a one- off concert performance of Stephen Sondheim's musical Follies at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the National Children's Home Scotland charity. It is shaping up to be a memorable night.\n\nPhyllis was the youngest of three children and her father worked for Rolls-Royce as an engineer, although the family never actually owned a car.\n\nHer aspirations to act were, perhaps unsurprisingly, not taken seriously by the careers teacher at school.\n\nPhyllis says: 'Coming from Johnstone then - I'm talking more than 30 years ago - to say that you wanted to go to drama school, it was just unheard of.'\n\nShe ignored the teacher and went on to study at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow, where she later won an award for best student of the year.\n\nHer contemporaries included Ruby Wax and Sheena Easton: 'I vividly remember Sheena performing at the first year cabaret, sitting at the piano and singing.\n\nShe was terrific.' After rep in Dundee, Phyllis landed a part in the haunting Scottish classic Another Time, Another Place, the wartime story of a young woman isolated on a farm with a disparate group of Italian PoWs.\n\nShe won a BAFTA award and was hailed the 'new Vanessa Redgrave'. She confesses she perhaps did not capitalise on this early opportunity, but insists: 'I never craved fame, never wanted the Hollywood thing.' WHEN her 11- year, relationship with screenwriter Paul Pender ended in 1992, she found herself alone in London, professionally at her peak in Lovejoy but personally at her lowest point.\n\nHer life changed when her friendship with actor Kevin McNally progressed to romance.\n\nWithin 18 months, she went from single, independent career woman to the settled domesticity of motherhood.\n\nShe says: 'My life has transformed for the better. Do I miss the single life? Categorically no. I came very late to motherhood but I welcomed it, embraced it with open arms. That's the way my life is now and it's fantastic.\n\nI'm quite happy that it happened when it did.\n\n'It would have been nice to have had another child to give my little boy a sibling but I'm just glad I managed to cram one in. We've got a dog instead.'\n\nPhyllis lives in West London with Kevin and Davey, now nine. She has yet to marry her long-term partner, but is adamant there will be a happy ending.\n\nHer mother will be in the audience on Sunday. Among the cast list is Annie Ross, who is flying in from New York, Una McLean, Joe McFadden, Patrick Doyle and Brenda Cochrane, along with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.\n\n'I'm very nervous,' admits Phyllis."
