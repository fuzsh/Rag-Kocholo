        "text": "PIRATES of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally has landed a role in Downton Abbey – alongside his wife.\n\nThe actor, Jack Sparrow’s first mate Joshamee Gibbs, joins his partner of 16 years, Phyllis Logan, in the drama.\n\nShe plays housekeeper Mrs Hughes while McNally, 55, is the father of an injured major at Downton to recuperate.\n\nSeries two is set in 1916, during the First World War and Lord Grantham turns the house into a convalescent home for officers.\n\nPhyllis, 55, said: “He told me he’d been offered a part and said ‘you may have heard of it – Downton Abbey’. I said, ‘What? You’re kidding!’\n\n“It was a bit peculiar, a bit like ‘bring your husband to work day’.”\n\nMcNally will soon be filming the fifth Pirates film with Johnny Depp and will finish Downton in October.\n\nThe show is back on TV in the early autumn, with a Christmas special to follow."
