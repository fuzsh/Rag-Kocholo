What about 60?\n\n-Oh, gosh...\n\n0:09:050:09:09\n\n-What do you think?\n\n-It's not a Crufts winner, is it?\n\n0:09:090:09:12\n\nOh!\n\n0:09:120:09:13\n\nSo, maybe 40?\n\n0:09:130:09:15\n\n-55?\n\n-Oh, gosh, he's going down in fives!\n\n0:09:160:09:20\n\nCome on, Phyllis! This is definitely a speaking part.\n\n0:09:200:09:23\n\nI think Phyllis and I would be delighted\n\n0:09:230:09:25\n\nif we could get it for 45, wouldn't we?\n\n0:09:250:09:28\n\nI mean, if we could just do that...\n\n0:09:280:09:30\n\nCos I think it'll be estimated at £40-£60.\n\n0:09:300:09:33\n\nWhat about meeting me in the middle?\n\n0:09:330:09:35\n\n£2.50 each and make him 50.\n\n0:09:350:09:37\n\n-Are you happy with 50?\n\n-Yes.\n\n0:09:380:09:41\n\n-Let's shake his hand, then.\n\n-Thank you very much.\n\n0:09:410:09:43\n\nQuite a reduction, Mark.\n\n0:09:430:09:45\n\nBut now Phyllis has spotted something else, it seems.\n\n0:09:450:09:48\n\nWe're rather intrigued by this,\n\n0:09:480:09:49\n\n-which we couldn't find a price on, could we?\n\n-No.\n\n0:09:490:09:52\n\nIt's part of the display, I'm afraid.\n\n0:09:520:09:54\n\n-Oh! We like it.\n\n-Yes.\n\n0:09:540:09:58\n\nThat appealed as a piece of, sort of, like an occasional table, almost.\n\n0:09:580:10:02\n\n-Kind of modernist in a way, isn't it?\n\n-Yeah.\n\n0:10:020:10:04\n\nObviously, the glass is a later top,\n\n0:10:040:10:07\n\nbut I loved that sinuousness - it's Art Nouveau, isn't it?\n\n0:10:070:10:11\n\n-1900, 1905, something like that.\n\n-But it's not for sale.\n\n0:10:110:10:16\n\nDon't give up so easily. Christian, I know, wants to help us.\n\n0:10:160:10:20\n\n-Anything is for sale for the right price, my dear.\n\n-Oh, I see!\n\n0:10:200:10:23\n\nWhat if we started again at, say, around £40?\n\n0:10:230:10:27\n\nWhat if I said about £70?\n\n0:10:290:10:32\n\nMARK SIGHS Ooh...\n\n0:10:320:10:34\n\nPhyllis is not looking happy about that.\n\n0:10:340:10:37\n\nI mean, we like it, but you know, in the auction,\n\n0:10:370:10:39\n\nit might not appeal to anybody.\n\n0:10:390:10:41\n\nOne of your finest performances, Phyllis.\n\n0:10:410:10:43\n\nI feel another BAFTA coming on.\n\n0:10:430:10:45\n\nWhy don't we say 50 again, and then it's a round 100, isn't it?\n\n0:10:450:10:48\n\n-Can we do that?\n\n-A round 100 for the bulldog and the pedestal.\n\n0:10:490:10:53\n\nWell, I would say a lot more than that, really, but...\n\n0:10:530:10:56\n\nMake it 60?\n\n0:10:560:10:57\n\n-Shall we say, \"yay\"...?\n\n-To 60?\n\n-Mm.\n\n0:10:570:11:00\n\n-So it's 110 for the two.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n0:11:000:11:03\n\nIt's all right, isn't it?\n\n0:11:030:11:04\n\n-110?\n\n-Yeah?\n\n-Yes.\n\n0:11:040:11:07\n\n-Sound like a deal?\n\n-It does.

That has...\n\n-Yes, that has to go.\n\n0:11:370:11:40\n\nWe're not having that.\n\n0:11:400:11:41\n\nHe's made an impressive start.\n\n0:11:410:11:43\n\nStill needs a guiding hand, though.\n\n0:11:440:11:47\n\nWhere the lack of experience comes in.\n\n0:11:470:11:49\n\n-HE PLAYS \"TUBULAR BELLS\" ON ORGAN\n\n-He can play a bit, too.\n\n0:11:510:11:54\n\nSpooky!\n\n0:11:550:11:56\n\nTubular Bells is fine, but definitely no Stairway.\n\n0:11:560:11:59\n\nSo, you've got to keep on pumping.\n\n0:11:590:12:01\n\nYeah, if you don't pump, it won't make a noise.\n\n0:12:010:12:03\n\nIt's like...Georgian aerobics.\n\n0:12:030:12:05\n\nFantastic it works - shame it's got that little wheeze in it, but...\n\n0:12:050:12:09\n\nI think if you were 150 years old, you might have a bit of a wheeze.\n\n0:12:090:12:12\n\nI'd have a wheeze, yeah!\n\n0:12:120:12:13\n\nThe harmonium, or pump organ, was once very popular in the home\n\n0:12:150:12:19\n\nand in small churches and chapels\n\n0:12:190:12:21\n\nwhere huge pipe organs would have been impractical.\n\n0:12:210:12:25\n\n-So, yes.\n\n-What do you think that would do?\n\n0:12:250:12:28\n\nI think it's...it's quite fun. It's small enough to be...\n\n0:12:280:12:31\n\n-It is small enough, isn't it?\n\n-Yeah.\n\n0:12:310:12:33\n\nShall we put that in our memory banks and come back to it?\n\n0:12:330:12:36\n\nQuite a price.\n\n0:12:380:12:39\n\nNot exactly going for a song - ha!\n\n0:12:390:12:41\n\nWe can't buy everything, can we?\n\n0:12:410:12:42\n\nYou can't, but you've picked out some amazing things.\n\n0:12:420:12:45\n\nI'm quite impressed with your eye.

Oh, it's to hold a pipe.\n\n0:12:570:12:59\n\nClay pipes, you used to buy them in packs of 20.\n\n0:12:590:13:02\n\n-Right, cos they break easily.\n\n-But this is for travelling.\n\n0:13:020:13:06\n\n-Ah...\n\n-To keep them safe.\n\n0:13:060:13:09\n\nThe ticket says £45.\n\n0:13:090:13:11\n\n-It's mahogany.\n\n-Lovely.\n\n-And comes with its own pipe.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n0:13:110:13:15\n\nWell, I think that's a lovely little item.\n\n0:13:150:13:17\n\n-Imagine just slipping it in your breeches.\n\n-Absolutely.\n\n0:13:170:13:20\n\nThe great thing on the day, with it being one of my lots,\n\n0:13:200:13:24\n\nis it's darn piratey.\n\n0:13:240:13:25\n\n-It is, isn't it?\n\n-Yeah. And someone might like to say,\n\n0:13:250:13:28\n\n-\"I got this from a real pirate.\"\n\n-Hm!\n\n0:13:280:13:31\n\nI think that might be taking it a bit far.\n\n0:13:310:13:33\n\nMethod actors, eh?\n\n0:13:330:13:35\n\nWorth talking to Mick about that and the harmonium.\n\n0:13:350:13:39\n\nWe need to speak to you, quite severely.\n\n0:13:390:13:41\n\nWe'd need a very, very good deal from you,\n\n0:13:410:13:43\n\ncos it's a lot of my bank.\n\n0:13:430:13:45\n\nI'll come straight to the point - I can take £100 off that.\n\n0:13:450:13:48\n\nOh, you'd have to take more than £100 off it, mate.\n\n0:13:480:13:50\n\n-That would still be half my money.\n\n-My heart bleeds(!)\n\n0:13:500:13:53\n\nI know! I can see how sympathetic you are to my plight.\n\n0:13:530:13:57\n\nOK, bottom line, £150.\n\n0:13:570:14:00\n\n150...\n\n0:14:000:14:01\n\nAnd the pipe holder - and you haven't cleaned it out -\n\n0:14:010:14:06\n\nwhat can that be?\n\n0:14:060:14:08\n\nAgain, bottom line would be 30 on that.\n\n0:14:080:14:10\n\nWith negotiations at a bit of a lull,\n\n0:14:100:14:13\n\nit's time to refocus.\n\n0:14:130:14:14\n\nClose your ears, Michael.\n\n0:14:140:14:15\n\nWe could take the two for 150?\n\n0:14:150:14:19\n\nKEVIN GASPS\n\n0:14:190:14:20\n\n-Offer him that.\n\n-You know what's coming, don't you?\n\n0:14:200:14:23\n\nMICK SNORTS WITH LAUGHTER\n\n0:14:230:14:24\n\nThe harmonium and the pipe for 150.\n\n0:14:240:14:26\n\nThis is your last opportunity, Mick. It's not going to happen again.\n\n0:14:260:14:30\n\nHe's good - hardly needs an agent, I'd say.\n\n0:14:300:14:32\n\n-165.\n\n-Oh!\n\n-I've got to make a little bit, haven't I?\n\n0:14:320:14:37\n\n160 and you've got a deal.\n\n0:14:380:14:39\n\n-OK.\n\n-I like your style! I'd say that myself.\n\n-Excellent.\n\n0:14:410:14:44\n\n-I step in with my sweaty paw.\n\n-Go on, then.\n\n0:14:440:14:47\n\n-And give you the dosh.\n\n-Excellent.\n\n0:14:470:14:49\n\nOh, after all that effort, it's time for a pirate time-out.\n\n0:14:490:14:53\n\n-Oh!\n\n-Three!\n\n0:14:540:14:56\n\nAlthough I'm not sure skimming stones\n\n0:14:560:14:58\n\nis very Treasure Island, are you?\n\n0:14:580:15:00\n\nI've never been to Deal before. Of course, like you,\n\n0:15:000:15:03\n\nbeing a Bristol boy, it's Weston-super-Mud.\n\n0:15:030:15:05\n\nWeston-super-Mud.\n\n0:15:050:15:07\n\n-My grandmother used to take me there, loads.\n\n-It's great.\n\n0:15:070:15:10\n\nOne year we went there and the tide was in. It was really exciting.\n\n0:15:100:15:14\n\nBut while Kevin and Thomas have been making a bit of a splash in Deal...\n\n0:15:160:15:20\n\nPhyllis and Mark have temporarily suspended all purchases,\n\n0:15:230:15:27\n\nmotoring to another part of the Kent coast at\n\n0:15:270:15:31\n\nBirchington-on-Sea at Quex House, once the Regency home of hunter\n\n0:15:310:15:35\n\nand collector, Percy Powell-Cotton.\n\n0:15:350:15:37\n\n-I'm Mark, very nice to meet you.\n\n-Good to meet you both.\n\n0:15:420:15:45\n\n-Spectacular house.\n\n-It's amazing, isn't it?\n\n-Lead on.\n\n0:15:450:15:48\n\nMUSIC\n\n0:15:480:15:50\n\nI feel as though I'm back in the Masai Mara.\n\n0:15:540:15:56\n\nThis impressive, if slightly disconcerting museum,\n\n0:15:590:16:02\n\nwas first established in 1896 by Major Powell-Cotton\n\n0:16:020:16:05\n\nto house the specimens and cultural artefacts\n\n0:16:050:16:08\n\nhe collected whilst exploring the globe.\n\n0:16:080:16:11\n\nHe collected animals, he shot them.\n\n0:16:130:16:16\n\nIt was a very different world to the world that we're in now\n\n0:16:160:16:20\n\nand he was collecting with this scientific purpose.\n\n0:16:200:16:24\n\nThere was always this drive to understand the world he was in.\n\n0:16:240:16:28\n\nAfrica was the continent Powell-Cotton fell in love with,\n\n0:16:290:16:32\n\nmaking 28 expeditions over the course of 50 years,\n\n0:16:320:16:35\n\nbut although he slaughtered many thousands of animals,\n\n0:16:350:16:38\n\nthe meticulous records that Powell-Cotton kept of each kill\n\n0:16:380:16:42\n\ncan now play an important role in conservation.\n\n0:16:420:16:45\n\n-This is one of the specimens.\n\n-A warthog.\n\n0:16:450:16:50\n\nThis gives a breakdown of what he brought back, but also we have\n\n0:16:500:16:55\n\nthe latitude and longitude of every specimen he brought back.\n\n0:16:550:16:59\n\nThe latitude and longitude today can be used to help protect\n\n0:17:010:17:05\n\nareas of Africa and species.\n\n0:17:050:17:08\n\nSomeone was recently working with bush babies\n\n0:17:080:17:11\n\nand they were identifying where they used to be found,\n\n0:17:110:17:14\n\nusing that information to say, well, they were here once,\n\n0:17:140:17:18\n\nso protect this space and there's a chance they'll be back.\n\n0:17:180:17:22\n\nAs well as the 500 creatures on display in the museum's dioramas,\n\n0:17:230:17:28\n\nthere are over 4,000 skeletons and 6,000 skins,\n\n0:17:280:17:31\n\na huge DNA database which has helped breeding programmes designed\n\n0:17:310:17:36\n\nto save species from extinction.\n\n0:17:360:17:38\n\nIn the collection, we have this type of thing.\n\n0:17:400:17:45\n\n-Every time you find a red label...\n\n-A Diana monkey.\n\n0:17:450:17:49\n\nIt's just behind you.\n\n0:17:490:17:51\n\nPercy brought some back that have not been identified\n\n0:17:510:17:55\n\n-to science before.\n\n-That's amazing. Can I touch it?\n\n-Please do.\n\n0:17:550:17:59\n\nAgain, used by researchers looking at primates.\n\n0:18:000:18:05\n\nSo, was the Major a misunderstood conservationist or just\n\n0:18:070:18:11\n\na big game hunter who kept good books?\n\n0:18:110:18:13\n\nLike many Victorians, he had the urge to educate\n\n0:18:130:18:16\n\nand didn't always use his gun to do the shooting.\n\n0:18:160:18:19\n\nHis 16mm films of his expeditions\n\n0:18:200:18:22\n\ndepict tribal ceremonies as well as wildlife.\n\n0:18:220:18:25\n\nHis daughters also followed in the family tradition,\n\n0:18:250:18:28\n\ncontributing to a huge archive.\n\n0:18:280:18:30\n\nIn 1905, he wrote a book, In Unknown Africa.\n\n0:18:310:18:35\n\nIn that book, he talks about how, if we don't protect the wild\n\n0:18:350:18:40\n\nplaces of Africa, we'll start to lose species in special areas.\n\n0:18:400:18:45\n\nHe even goes as far as to say it might reach a point where\n\n0:18:460:18:49\n\nthe only place you'll see these animals is in the museum.\n\n0:18:490:18:53\n\nGood Lord.\n\n0:18:530:18:54\n\nWhatever his methods, Powell-Cotton certainly had\n\n0:18:540:18:56\n\na genuine love of Africa, even getting married there in 1905.\n\n0:18:560:19:01\n\nOne of the most striking displays at the museum results from that\n\n0:19:010:19:05\n\nThe buffalo is yet another example of a previously unknown species\n\n0:19:090:19:13\n\nwhich the Major soon had his name appended to\n\n0:19:130:19:16\n\nand the lion has an even closer connection to the museum's\n\n0:19:160:19:19\n\nfounder, having nearly killed him.\n\n0:19:190:19:22\n\nIf you look at his clothing,\n\n0:19:220:19:24\n\nyou'll see the major wound he suffered was on his back.\n\n0:19:240:19:27\n\nHe thought he had killed the lion, went over to it and it leapt up,\n\n0:19:270:19:32\n\ndragged him to the ground. He suffered this major wound here.\n\n0:19:320:19:35\n\nThe thing that saved him was,\n\n0:19:350:19:37\n\ntucked in his trousers, was a copy of Punch.\n\n0:19:370:19:41\n\nThat saved his life?\n\n0:19:410:19:42\n\nSaved his life and when he got back to Britain, Punch magazine\n\n0:19:420:19:47\n\nhad published the story of the lion.\n\n0:19:470:19:50\n\nTime to find out what our other pair of antique explorers are up to\n\n0:19:550:19:59\n\nin darkest Kent, heading to the famous resort of Margate.\n\n0:19:590:20:03\n\nPainter, Turner, described these skies as the loveliest in all Europe\n\n0:20:050:20:09\n\nand there is now an art gallery here in the great man's name.\n\n0:20:090:20:12\n\nNo point in locking it. It hasn't got a top.\n\n0:20:170:20:21\n\n-There is the door here.\n\n-Is it?\n\n-Let's walk in the door.\n\n0:20:210:20:25\n\n-Hi, welcome to sunny Margate. I'm Ron.\n\n-Ron, nice to see you.\n\n0:20:270:20:30\n\n-Thomas.\n\n-A lot of clocks, I see.\n\n-I'm a clock fancier myself.\n\n0:20:300:20:35\n\nThey're not very good business at the moment, to be honest.\n\n0:20:350:20:38\n\nThanks for the advice. We won't be looking at clocks them, thank you.\n\n0:20:380:20:41\n\nDecisive, Kevin. He continues to impress.\n\n0:20:410:20:43\n\nA TU-95, very nice.\n\n0:20:430:20:46\n\n-Soviet, of course.\n\n-Perhaps they'll pick up a piece of militaria then.\n\n0:20:480:20:52\n\nM85 helmet. First Gulf War.\n\n0:20:520:20:54\n\nHoorah!\n\n0:20:570:21:00\n\nI wish I hadn't had my fish and chips at lunchtime.\n\n0:21:000:21:02\n\nYou look lovely, but could we please press on?\n\n0:21:020:21:05\n\nI don't think I could take it off. I'm stuck.\n\n0:21:050:21:09\n\nRon's huge establishment is very different from the shop\n\n0:21:090:21:12\n\n-they were in earlier.\n\n-This is overwhelming.\n\n0:21:120:21:15\n\n-But Kevin still seems intent on following his instincts.\n\n-Tom?\n\n0:21:150:21:22\n\n-Tom?\n\n-Coming. What have you got...? Is this a dentist chair or a barbers?\n\n0:21:220:21:27\n\nPeople associate these things with pain.\n\n0:21:310:21:34\n\nRemember Larry and Dustin in Marathon Man?\n\n0:21:340:21:36\n\n-Put your head back, let's have a look.\n\n-But is it safe?\n\n0:21:360:21:40\n\nThat'll have to come out, for a start.\n\n0:21:400:21:42\n\nI think Thomas's advice plus the £300 price tag might deter\n\n0:21:430:21:47\n\na splurge. More pain.\n\n0:21:470:21:49\n\nIt's a cat and nine tails. Is this something you use on your films.\n\n0:21:490:21:54\n\nYes, yes. The lashings will continue until morale improves.\n\n0:21:540:21:59\n\n-It seems that Ron has always got a bit more shop to explore.\n\n-Oh, look.\n\n0:22:010:22:06\n\n-Do you remember Steptoe And Son?\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-I think it was shot here.\n\n0:22:110:22:16\n\nI'm not sure the warehouse is actually open to the public, Kevin.\n\n0:22:160:22:20\n\nMy sideburns. Oh, look, big old tuba there.\n\n0:22:200:22:25\n\nBig old tuba, but there's nothing there. Wouldn't be able to play it.\n\n0:22:250:22:30\n\n-That doesn't matter.\n\n-Really?\n\n-These are converted to lamps now.\n\n0:22:300:22:35\n\nI love it.\n\n0:22:360:22:37\n\nIt's a Boosey and so pre-dates 1930 when the company merged\n\n0:22:370:22:41\n\nwith the other great British musical dynasty of Hawkes.\n\n0:22:410:22:45\n\nBBC television, Tony Hancock...\n\n0:22:450:22:49\n\n-Hey, look, look, look, Boosey. It's a Boosey one.\n\n-Really?\n\n0:22:510:22:56\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Slipped up there then.\n\n-You've slipped up there.\n\n0:22:560:22:59\n\nRon is asking £50 for this battered bit of brass.\n\n0:22:590:23:03\n\nCould this be better than the 50?\n\n0:23:030:23:05\n\n-I think 50 is a gift, to be honest with you.\n\n-Do you think so?\n\n0:23:050:23:09\n\n-I didn't know it was Boosey.\n\n-40. There's a lot of work on here.\n\n0:23:090:23:14\n\nYou've wheedled your way into my warehouse.\n\n0:23:140:23:16\n\n-You don't like that, do you?\n\n-I don't mind, but you can't come in here\n\n0:23:160:23:19\n\nand nail me to the floor for things in the warehouse, I'm afraid.\n\n0:23:190:23:23\n\nIf I could take that away with me\n\n0:23:230:23:24\n\nand still have 200 quid left for tomorrow, I'd be such a happy bunny.\n\n0:23:240:23:28\n\nBut once we give him 50, I'm under the 200 and I've got no negotiation.\n\n0:23:290:23:33\n\n-I've got no leverage, you see.\n\n-£40 and Kevin will take it away.\n\n0:23:330:23:39\n\nNo, no, sorry, thank you very much for the interest\n\n0:23:390:23:43\n\nbut honest truth, I think it's a steal at 50 quid.\n\n0:23:430:23:46\n\n-Boosey is better than Boosey and Hawkes.\n\n-It's earlier.\n\n0:23:460:23:49\n\n-I've had a little practice.\n\n-You're good, you're good.\n\n0:23:510:23:56\n\n-45 quid and we'll have a deal.\n\n-Go on.\n\n-Go on, absolutely, got it.\n\n0:23:560:24:02\n\nYes, the thrill, the adrenaline. I'm becoming a junkie.\n\n0:24:020:24:06\n\n-Never a script, darlings. Improv, every time.\n\n-Let's go.\n\n0:24:070:24:12\n\nAfter quite a day, Kevin and Phyllis are together again.\n\n0:24:160:24:20\n\nIs that a squirrel? It's a rabbit! Oh, we really are in the countryside.\n\n0:24:200:24:24\n\n-We really are in the depths.\n\n-A bunny rabbit, there.\n\n-I think we're lost.\n\n0:24:240:24:31\n\n-We should have brought a map.\n\n-Well. Hasn't his not got any Sat Nav?\n\n0:24:310:24:36\n\n-Afraid not.\n\n-I do hope they find their way. Nighty night.\n\n0:24:390:24:44\n\nNext morning, we're in Sussex where it's raining.\n\n0:24:460:24:49\n\nDo you need your wipers on?\n\n0:24:490:24:51\n\n-Do you know where they are?\n\n-Have a look there, see if it says wipers.\n\n0:24:510:24:54\n\n-Here we are, look.\n\n-Wipers.\n\n-Lovely.\n\n0:24:540:24:57\n\nThat is what marriage is all about, teamwork\n\n0:24:590:25:02\n\nand betting on household chores of course.\n\n0:25:020:25:05\n\nI think we should forget about that whole breakfast thing\n\n0:25:050:25:08\n\nand just make it totally about the bins.\n\n0:25:080:25:10\n\nExactly. Bins and recycling. What a chore.\n\n0:25:120:25:15\n\n-See, that's you for the next six months.\n\n-So cocky.\n\n0:25:170:25:21\n\nNo, Mark's got me sorted, well sorted.\n\n0:25:210:25:24\n\nI love to see you confident, darling,\n\n0:25:260:25:29\n\nbut I'm sad to see it's so misplaced.\n\n0:25:290:25:32\n\nPhyllis and Mark were the cautious couple yesterday,\n\n0:25:320:25:34\n\nspending a mere £110 on a bulldog and a lamp table, as you do.\n\n0:25:340:25:38\n\n-I don't want to insult you, but...\n\n-But we do, really.\n\n0:25:390:25:43\n\n..leaving just under £300 to spend today,\n\n0:25:430:25:46\n\nwhile Kevin and Thomas splurged out on a tuba, a pipe holder\n\n0:25:460:25:50\n\nand a harmonium...\n\n0:25:500:25:51\n\nYou be careful with that now, because it belongs to me.\n\n0:25:510:25:54\n\n..for a total cost of £205, meaning they've almost £200 in their wallet.\n\n0:25:550:26:02\n\n-I'm feeling a little bit of insecurity from you.\n\n-From me?\n\n0:26:020:26:05\n\nLater, they'll be ending up in the capital for a Greenwich auction\n\n0:26:080:26:12\n\nbut in the meantime, we're in Sussex at Eastbourne.\n\n0:26:120:26:15\n\nThe comedian, Charlie Chester, was born in Eastbourne\n\n0:26:180:26:21\n\nand political theorist Friedrich Engels who co-wrote\n\n0:26:210:26:25\n\nthe Communist Manifesto with Karl Marx.\n\n0:26:250:26:27\n\nHe has his ashes scattered at nearby Beachy Head. Handy.\n\n0:26:270:26:31\n\n-Are we going to the same place?\n\n-I think we are.\n\n0:26:310:26:33\n\nLet's get there before them.\n\n0:26:330:26:35\n\nI wonder if there'll be much chitchat about the theory\n\n0:26:360:26:40\n\nof surplus value as our gang of four shop together.\n\n0:26:400:26:43\n\nYesterday, Phyllis took a bit of a supporting role\n\n0:26:480:26:50\n\nwhen it came to the choosing, so she's keen to play her part today.\n\n0:26:500:26:54\n\n-Do it like this?\n\n-This?\n\n-Well, it's nice. It's Art Deco...ish.\n\n0:26:550:27:01\n\n-It's French, probably 1940s. They don't do terribly well.\n\n-Maybe not.\n\n0:27:010:27:07\n\nKevin is after a new career.\n\n0:27:070:27:09\n\nDo you want to go over and do Pirates Of The Caribbean 5\n\n0:27:090:27:12\n\n-and I'll do this?\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Shall we do that?\n\n-Yeah, great.\n\n0:27:120:27:16\n\nI know Thomas quite well and you obviously know Kevin very well.\n\n0:27:160:27:20\n\n-What do you think they're going for?\n\n-Toys.\n\n0:27:200:27:22\n\nThey are going for blokey things as well.\n\n0:27:260:27:28\n\nHere's something you'd like.\n\n0:27:360:27:37\n\n-A Lancaster or Wellington bomber cockpit compass.\n\n-Let me in there.\n\n0:27:370:27:44\n\n-Can you see that?\n\n-Oh, that is great. That could be my military thing.\n\n0:27:440:27:48\n\nLet's have a closer look with shopkeeper, Damian.\n\n0:27:500:27:54\n\n-Tell him we hate it.\n\n-The price of the compass is £85.\n\n0:27:540:27:58\n\n-Not sure they can see that though.\n\n-I want to see the date.\n\n0:27:580:28:03\n\n-Very interesting.\n\n-You like that?\n\n-It works, which is great.\n\n0:28:030:28:07\n\nI love the fact that it's got that box.\n\n0:28:070:28:09\n\n-We should wash our hands after this.\n\n-Why?\n\n0:28:090:28:12\n\n-If this is luminescent, there will be some radiation.\n\n-Will there?\n\n0:28:120:28:16\n\nCrikey, step away from the antique.\n\n0:28:160:28:18\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis has taken Mark outside.\n\n0:28:180:28:21\n\n-What about these chairs?\n\n-These are what I would call nursing chairs.\n\n0:28:210:28:26\n\n-Nursing chairs?\n\n-Yes, for a mother to sit on.\n\n0:28:260:28:30\n\nThey probably date to 1890, 1900. They're antique.\n\n0:28:300:28:35\n\nThey're asking 155 for the pair but again,\n\n0:28:350:28:39\n\nif they are outside, maybe the dealer wants to get rid of them,\n\n0:28:390:28:42\n\nmaybe they bought them with some other stuff.\n\n0:28:420:28:45\n\nActually, they'd be glad to see the back of them.\n\n0:28:450:28:47\n\nEverybody watching at home would be saying, \"Don't buy them,\n\n0:28:470:28:50\n\n-\"don't buy them.\"\n\n-There'll be some lively discussion, for certain.\n\n0:28:500:28:53\n\n-Have a go, see what you think.\n\n-Yes.\n\n-What does it feel like?\n\n0:28:530:28:58\n\n-I'm feeling like...\n\n-You're feeling like you really want it.\n\n0:29:140:29:17\n\n-I was so wussy yesterday.\n\n-You weren't wussy.\n\n0:29:170:29:21\n\nPrepare yourself, Paul, she means business.\n\n0:29:210:29:24\n\nWe're on quite a tight budget here and, of course, going to try\n\n0:29:240:29:28\n\nand knock you down a bit.\n\n0:29:280:29:30\n\nWe need these at a really special Downton Abbey price, don't we?\n\n0:29:300:29:35\n\n-I'm emphasising the word, down.\n\n-Subtle, Mark.\n\n0:29:350:29:40\n\n-How does 110 sound?\n\n-No.\n\n-Much too much.\n\n0:29:400:29:42\n\nNo, I'm sorry, we can't do that.\n\n0:29:420:29:44\n\n-How does £90 sound?\n\n-We're heading in the right direction.\n\n0:29:460:29:50\n\n-We're going down.\n\n-In order for the better team to win...\n\n0:29:500:29:54\n\n-I like that.\n\n-I like your style.\n\n0:29:540:29:57\n\nThe pair of chairs for £70.\n\n0:29:570:29:59\n\n-We are so close.\n\n-We ARE so close.\n\n0:30:000:30:02\n\nI was thinking maybe around the figure of 60\n\n0:30:020:30:05\n\nand we could shake your hand.\n\n0:30:050:30:07\n\n-Go on, have them for 60.\n\n-Shake his hand, before he changes his mind.\n\n0:30:070:30:10\n\n-I hope you win this one.\n\n-Thank you very much!\n\n-Thanks so much, Paul. We're thrilled with those.\n\n0:30:100:30:14\n\nWell done, Phyllis.\n\n0:30:140:30:16\n\nHow are the boys getting on with their much-loved compass?\n\n0:30:160:30:20\n\nRegarding the compass, the gentleman who owns it is currently in Europe.\n\n0:30:200:30:24\n\nI can't get hold of him on the phone.\n\n0:30:240:30:26\n\nWhat could you do that for normally?\n\n0:30:260:30:28\n\nWe could do it for 65.\n\n0:30:280:30:29\n\nWith £195 still in the kitty, it's affordable -\n\n0:30:300:30:33\n\nbut the pirates go back on the prowl for more treasure.\n\n0:30:330:30:37\n\nHe's doing that walking away thing - I really like that!\n\n0:30:370:30:39\n\nThe rivals, however, look altogether more relaxed.\n\n0:30:390:30:43\n\n-Have you ever worked together?\n\n-Er...not for ages.\n\n0:30:430:30:46\n\nWell, mind you, having said that, he did come on to Downton Abbey.\n\n0:30:460:30:49\n\n-Oh, did he?\n\n-Yes, it was horrible.\n\n0:30:490:30:52\n\n-No, it wasn't!\n\n-It must be quite fun.\n\n0:30:520:30:55\n\nIt was quite fun, I must say, and this is nice.\n\n0:30:550:30:57\n\nI mean, this is...like being on a little holiday.\n\n0:30:570:31:00\n\nYes, it is, coming around and having a look.\n\n0:31:000:31:02\n\nThe boys, though, are keeping their minds on the game.\n\n0:31:020:31:06\n\n-I like that Iraqi silver.\n\n-At the back? That is nice. I do like that.\n\n0:31:060:31:11\n\nA 19th-century Islamic dish for Turkish delights or sweets -\n\n0:31:110:31:15\n\nbaklava or something like that.\n\n0:31:150:31:17\n\nThis is on copper with silver.\n\n0:31:170:31:19\n\nIs there any interest? I mean, I think it's lovely.\n\n0:31:190:31:22\n\nA huge amount of interest. Because you're thinking of the\n\n0:31:220:31:24\n\nemerging economies of the Middle East and this is a near Middle East piece.\n\n0:31:240:31:28\n\nAnd they do like to buy back their works of art, which will create it.\n\n0:31:280:31:32\n\nSo you have got a possibility with something like this.\n\n0:31:320:31:35\n\nThe price is at 161, so it's got to be...\n\n0:31:350:31:38\n\n100 quid, really, hasn't it, or 80? Go and talk to them about that, yeah?\n\n0:31:380:31:43\n\nWhat can Damian do?\n\n0:31:430:31:45\n\nI asked him to make my day. He's come in at £110.\n\n0:31:450:31:50\n\nHe wouldn't do it for...\n\n0:31:530:31:54\n\n-..95?\n\n-He actually paid 110 for it.\n\n0:31:550:31:58\n\nAnd you want 65 for the...\n\n0:31:580:32:00\n\nWell, I could come down to 60,\n\n0:32:000:32:02\n\n-so that gives you 170 for the two items.\n\n-Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:32:020:32:05\n\nThat's all right. OK.\n\n0:32:050:32:07\n\nI think we're almost there. Almost all the cash gone, too.\n\n0:32:070:32:10\n\n-Well, I think it's these two, isn't it?\n\n-We going to do it?\n\n0:32:100:32:12\n\n-Yes.\n\n-Leaves us a little bit of money left but we didn't spend it all.\n\n0:32:120:32:16\n\nWell, we'll spend it down the pub. Thank you.\n\n0:32:160:32:18\n\n-Good idea.\n\n-Thank you very much.\n\n0:32:180:32:20\n\n-Better give you some money.\n\n-Pay the man!\n\n-Yeah, I will.\n\n-Absolutely, yes.\n\n0:32:200:32:24\n\nCor, they're going out with a bang,\n\n0:32:240:32:26\n\nwrapping up their shopping with the World War II compass\n\n0:32:260:32:29\n\nand the Middle Eastern silver-on-laid-copper plate for a total of £170.\n\n0:32:290:32:34\n\nTime for a parting of the ways,\n\n0:32:340:32:37\n\nwith one side still hot to shop and the other aiming for the stars.\n\n0:32:370:32:42\n\n-You're quite into astrology, aren't you?\n\n-Astronomy.\n\n-Astronomy?\n\n-Astronomy.\n\n0:32:420:32:46\n\nReally, Thomas! They may sound the same, but astronomy,\n\n0:32:470:32:50\n\nthe study of the stars and planets,\n\n0:32:500:32:52\n\nis really quite different from looking at horoscopes, or astrology.\n\n0:32:520:32:56\n\nWhen I was a kid, I took one of the first astronomy O-levels.\n\n0:32:570:33:02\n\n-Astrology?\n\n-I... Astronomy.\n\n0:33:020:33:04\n\n-Astronomy?\n\n-Astronomy.\n\n0:33:040:33:06\n\nOh, Thomas!\n\n0:33:060:33:08\n\nThey're making for Herstmonceux, East Sussex.\n\n0:33:080:33:10\n\nThe Greenwich Royal Observatory moved their telescopes here\n\n0:33:100:33:15\n\nafter the war and, although they've since gone further abroad\n\n0:33:150:33:18\n\nto escape this weather, much remains.\n\n0:33:180:33:21\n\n-Are you like a boy in a sweetie shop?\n\n-Oh, absolutely!\n\n0:33:210:33:24\n\nI can't express how excited I am.\n\n0:33:240:33:27\n\n-Hi, I'm Kevin.\n\n-Good afternoon. I'm Helen.\n\n-Helen, nice to meet you.\n\n-I'm Thomas.\n\n0:33:270:33:30\n\n-Hi, Thomas. Come on in.\n\n-This is Tom, but don't mind him!\n\n0:33:300:33:34\n\nSome regular viewers may recognise these domes\n\n0:33:340:33:37\n\nfrom a previous pitstop by Charlie Ross.\n\n0:33:370:33:40\n\nToday, however, Thomas and Kevin are here to learn\n\n0:33:400:33:43\n\nabout an outlandish experiment using two telescope lenses that turned\n\n0:33:430:33:48\n\nan unknown Austrian physicist into one of the world's most famous men.\n\n0:33:480:33:53\n\nIn 1919, two of the lenses that are on this site now were taken\n\n0:33:530:33:56\n\nto Africa and Brazil respectively and they were instrumental\n\n0:33:560:33:59\n\nin proving Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\n0:33:590:34:01\n\nOne of the key points of Albert Einstein's famous theory\n\n0:34:010:34:06\n\nwas that even light is affected by gravity.\n\n0:34:060:34:09\n\nTo prove this, he predicted that if you could see\n\n0:34:090:34:12\n\nstars in the daytime, any stars hidden behind the sun\n\n0:34:120:34:15\n\nwould appear to have moved position,\n\n0:34:150:34:18\n\nbut it was actually the sun's gravity bending the stars' light.\n\n0:34:180:34:21\n\nDeep stuff, eh? You keeping up?\n\n0:34:210:34:23\n\nAnd the way it worked was that they proved that\n\n0:34:230:34:27\n\nthe gravity of a big object like the sun would bend light,\n\n0:34:270:34:29\n\nwhich is a central core of special relativity, isn't it?\n\n0:34:290:34:33\n\n-Absolutely.\n\n-That's what I was going to ask - what is the theory of relativity?\n\n0:34:330:34:37\n\n-I'll tell you later.\n\n-Will you?\n\n-We don't have the time.\n\n0:34:370:34:40\n\nWell, we've all heard of E = mc2,\n\n0:34:420:34:45\n\nbut fear not, Thomas - even the world's best scientists\n\n0:34:450:34:49\n\nat the time couldn't wrap their minds around Einstein's ideas.\n\n0:34:490:34:53\n\nThe only chap who saw the vast potential\n\n0:34:530:34:55\n\nwas British physicist Arthur Eddington.\n\n0:34:550:34:58\n\nWith the help of the Royal Astronomical Society,\n\n0:34:580:35:02\n\nEddington set out on a grand global expedition\n\n0:35:020:35:05\n\nto get observational proof of part of Einstein's theory.\n\n0:35:050:35:10\n\nThey knew they'd need a solar eclipse\n\n0:35:150:35:17\n\nto view the stars and sun together,\n\n0:35:170:35:20\n\nso a ship carrying two huge telescopes\n\n0:35:200:35:23\n\nwas sent along the route of the next eclipse.\n\n0:35:230:35:26\n\nThe goal was to photograph the position of the stars\n\n0:35:260:35:29\n\n-during the eclipse, to prove Einstein was right.\n\n-TIM WHISTLES\n\n0:35:290:35:34\n\nThat's why the eclipse is so important -\n\n0:35:340:35:36\n\nbecause the sky goes dark and you can take the photograph,\n\n0:35:360:35:39\n\nthe stars come out...\n\n0:35:390:35:41\n\nBecause they're always there, but,\n\n0:35:410:35:44\n\nobviously, we just see the blue sky of the atmosphere.\n\n0:35:440:35:46\n\nIt's a brilliant experiment!\n\n0:35:460:35:48\n\nActually, when you break it down, it's an extremely simple experiment.\n\n0:35:480:35:51\n\nYes, and that's the genius of it, I think.\n\n0:35:510:35:53\n\nBut the task was far from easy.\n\n0:35:550:35:57\n\nWeather clouded their six-minute window,\n\n0:35:570:36:00\n\nobscuring all but a few seconds of the eclipse.\n\n0:36:000:36:03\n\nThey had one usable picture but it was all that was needed.\n\n0:36:030:36:08\n\nThe stars were shown to be out of position,\n\n0:36:080:36:10\n\nEinstein was proved right and science was changed for ever.\n\n0:36:100:36:15\n\nHe became an overnight celebrity,\n\n0:36:150:36:16\n\nthanks to the team of intrepid British pioneers\n\n0:36:160:36:19\n\nand two telescope lenses, both of which are now housed on this site.\n\n0:36:190:36:23\n\nThis is an actual lens from the telescope?\n\n0:36:270:36:29\n\n-The actual lens that was taken to Africa.\n\n-It's a mighty lens, isn't it?\n\n0:36:290:36:33\n\nAnd to think they were hand ground at the time, as well.\n\n0:36:330:36:35\n\n-Where's the rest of the telescope?\n\n-Your guess is as good as mine.\n\n0:36:350:36:39\n\n-I think it was left.\n\n-Left?\n\n-All we have is the lens now.\n\n0:36:390:36:44\n\nThat's where the money is, the lenses.\n\n0:36:440:36:46\n\nTalking of which, just shut that because he'll have that auctioned by the end of the week.\n\n0:36:460:36:50\n\n\"Lot one, a very famous lens. £5 million.\"\n\n0:36:500:36:53\n\nMake sure it's locked up. Get out!\n\n0:36:530:36:55\n\nIncredibly, the lens from the second telescope\n\n0:36:560:36:59\n\nused in the experiment is still in use here in Sussex.\n\n0:36:590:37:02\n\n-Well, this on top is the viewfinder, right?\n\n-Yes, that's the guider scope.\n\n0:37:030:37:07\n\nThe guider scope. But this is the telescope with its original Brazilian lens?\n\n0:37:070:37:12\n\nYeah, this is the lens that was taken to Brazil.\n\n0:37:120:37:14\n\n-It's like you're some sort of mad professor.\n\n-I am a mad professor.\n\n0:37:140:37:18\n\nI feel like it. I just need my hair up a little bit more and start talking like Patrick Moore!\n\n0:37:180:37:22\n\nAnd Helen and I are your, sort of, pupils.\n\n0:37:220:37:24\n\nAnd you know so much! I'm so impressed!\n\n0:37:240:37:26\n\nWell, I know so little compared to these guys.\n\n0:37:260:37:29\n\nCould I move this telescope?\n\n0:37:290:37:31\n\n-Yeah, I can take the clamps off for you and you can move it yourself.\n\n-OK.\n\n0:37:310:37:35\n\nOh, I'm so excited! Are the clamps off?\n\n0:37:350:37:38\n\nHE GASPS Look at that!\n\n0:37:380:37:40\n\nThe simplest touch - just move around the sky.\n\n0:37:420:37:46\n\n-I love the dial there.\n\n-Oh, yeah.\n\n0:37:480:37:51\n\nBoys and their toys, eh?\n\n0:37:510:37:52\n\nOh, that's amazing!\n\n0:37:540:37:55\n\nHang on!\n\n0:37:550:37:57\n\nAh, we're doing that again, are we? There they are.\n\n0:37:570:38:01\n\nMeanwhile, back in Eastbourne...\n\n0:38:030:38:05\n\nThis looks rather intriguing.\n\n0:38:050:38:06\n\nIt does, doesn't it?\n\n0:38:060:38:08\n\n..Phyllis and Mark still have work to do.\n\n0:38:080:38:11\n\nOh, it's nice and dry in here!\n\n0:38:110:38:13\n\n-It's good to see you again.\n\n-Pleased to meet you again.\n\n-And you.\n\n-Hello.\n\n0:38:130:38:17\n\n-I'm Phyllis.\n\n-Pleased to meet you.\n\n0:38:170:38:18\n\nThose two are looking for a couple more objects...\n\n0:38:210:38:24\n\n..although I think they're taking it in turns.\n\n0:38:260:38:29\n\nWell, we've got a dog. Maybe we should get a cat.\n\n0:38:290:38:33\n\nMark's got a similar approach, it seems.\n\n0:38:330:38:35\n\n-I think this is Indian. Indian brass work.\n\n-Oh, yes, cowbell.\n\n0:38:350:38:39\n\nI think it's quite nicely made, actually.\n\n0:38:390:38:42\n\nIt's all hand engraved there and the bells are quite nice.\n\n0:38:420:38:45\n\nSo that would have been made when, do you think?\n\n0:38:450:38:48\n\nYou'd think something like that was fairly modern, wouldn't you, really?\n\n0:38:480:38:51\n\nYou know. But I think it's got a bit of age. If you look...\n\n0:38:510:38:55\n\nYou know, this is all handmade nails here.\n\n0:38:550:38:59\n\nI don't think it's any later than around about 1920.\n\n0:38:590:39:03\n\n-So we're heading off to 100 years old.\n\n-Do you think it would do well?\n\n0:39:030:39:08\n\nThese type of items are becoming more collectable.\n\n0:39:080:39:11\n\nYou know, Chinese, Indian, Arabic items with a bit of age.\n\n0:39:110:39:16\n\nThe ticket price is £30 - but are they agreed?\n\n0:39:160:39:20\n\nI mean, if we could get that really down,\n\n0:39:200:39:23\n\nI think it just might stand a chance.\n\n0:39:230:39:26\n\n-Not impressed with my old cow?\n\n-SHE CHUCKLES\n\n0:39:260:39:29\n\nYou know, if people who go to auction don't appreciate\n\n0:39:290:39:32\n\nthis type of art, you know, it could sell for a fiver.\n\n0:39:320:39:35\n\n-I know. I think it might.\n\n-Shall we leave it?\n\n-I think we should.\n\n0:39:350:39:38\n\n-We'll leave it.\n\n-But then...\n\n-You're not indecisive at all, are you?\n\n0:39:380:39:43\n\n-Look, shall we just ask what the best price is?\n\n-Yes, yes.\n\n-Phew!\n\n0:39:440:39:48\n\nWe finally got there.\n\n0:39:480:39:50\n\nWe might have a little something which intrigued us.\n\n0:39:500:39:54\n\nAn old cow.\n\n0:39:540:39:55\n\nThat's no way to speak to your guest!\n\n0:39:570:40:00\n\n-Well, I just think it's rather fun.\n\n-It is. Fire away.\n\n0:40:000:40:03\n\n£10?\n\n0:40:030:40:05\n\nHE SNORTS I heard you snorting there!\n\n0:40:050:40:08\n\n-11?\n\n-Oh, do try harder.\n\n0:40:080:40:10\n\n11.50?\n\n0:40:100:40:11\n\n-Come on!\n\n-15?\n\n0:40:120:40:15\n\n-£12? Yes, £12. £12?\n\n-15.\n\n-Well, 15's such an odd number, isn't it?\n\n0:40:150:40:20\n\n12 is pretty odd, as well!\n\n0:40:200:40:23\n\nShould we say 15? Are we being too mean?\n\n0:40:230:40:26\n\n-I think we should say 15.\n\n-15. 15?\n\n0:40:260:40:29\n\n-Thank you very much.\n\n-Deal.\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-Thank you very much.\n\n0:40:310:40:34\n\n-For a little cow and baby.\n\n-I do hope we can milk a profit on it!\n\n0:40:340:40:38\n\nOh!\n\n0:40:380:40:39\n\nQuite! Time to move on.\n\n0:40:390:40:42\n\n-Moo!\n\n-Moo!\n\n0:40:420:40:44\n\nNow motoring towards the village of Hailsham\n\n0:40:460:40:49\n\nand their last chance to buy.\n\n0:40:490:40:51\n\nOh, hello. You must be Rhoda.\n\n0:40:510:40:53\n\n-I am indeed.\n\n-Hello, I'm Phyllis.\n\n-Nice to meet you.\n\n-I'm Mark.\n\n0:40:530:40:56\n\n-Hello, Mark.\n\n-Lovely to meet you.\n\n0:40:560:40:58\n\nWe've got to you in the nick of time but we have so little time.\n\n0:40:580:41:01\n\nIs there something here you think\n\n0:41:010:41:03\n\nyou want to help two desperate people?\n\n0:41:030:41:06\n\nInteresting question - because, as well as quite a few traditional antiques on offer,\n\n0:41:060:41:11\n\nRhoda has a bit of an eye-catching novelty item.\n\n0:41:110:41:15\n\nAnyone spotted it yet?\n\n0:41:150:41:16\n\nOh, yes. Say hello to Diana!\n\n0:41:160:41:19\n\nDRAMATIC MUSIC\n\n0:41:190:41:21\n\n-Oh, Lordy Lord!\n\n-Oh, my gosh! It's scary, isn't it?\n\n0:41:210:41:26\n\nSounds like a no to the lovely Diana. Anything a bit smaller?\n\n0:41:260:41:30\n\nThis is quite interesting.\n\n0:41:300:41:32\n\nHe looks like a military naval type, doesn't he?\n\n0:41:320:41:35\n\n-Is it a doorstop or something?\n\n-It is. It's filled with lead in the bottom.\n\n0:41:350:41:38\n\nIt looks 19th century.\n\n0:41:380:41:40\n\nI mean, I thought it might have been Nelson.\n\n0:41:400:41:42\n\n-Unfortunately, it's not.\n\n-No.\n\n-It would be lovely if we could find something with Nelson on it.\n\n0:41:420:41:48\n\nOr we'd be absolutely ridiculous and if the doll in the box\n\n0:41:480:41:52\n\nis terribly cheap, we take that for a laugh.\n\n0:41:520:41:55\n\nCos Thomas and Kevin will think we've gone completely\n\n0:41:550:41:58\n\nand utterly mad. And we have, haven't we?\n\n0:41:580:42:00\n\nSHE CHUCKLES\n\n0:42:000:42:02\n\n-Diana in the box?\n\n-Yes. Life-size.\n\n0:42:020:42:06\n\n-They won't be expecting that, will they?\n\n-They certainly will not.\n\n0:42:060:42:09\n\n-Cos you hate the doll, don't you?\n\n-Oh, absolutely.\n\n-And I hate the doll.\n\n0:42:090:42:12\n\n-Oh, I see.\n\n-And they'll hate the Doll.\n\n-Yes.\n\n0:42:120:42:15\n\nYou don't have to buy it, Phyllis.\n\n0:42:150:42:18\n\nI'm not even sure I want to touch it. And she's wearing this...\n\n0:42:180:42:20\n\n-I don't want to touch it.\n\n-..plastic...\n\n0:42:200:42:22\n\nIt's like a jockey's outfit or something.\n\n0:42:220:42:24\n\n-I just think she is so ridiculously hideous.\n\n-Yep.\n\n0:42:240:42:30\n\n-Could we appeal to your generous side, Rhoda...\n\n-Uh-huh?\n\n0:42:300:42:35\n\n-..and could you please let us have it for £10?\n\n-No.\n\n0:42:350:42:38\n\n-Well, I tried.\n\n-I'll do her for 20.\n\n0:42:390:42:43\n\n-Yes, go on, then.\n\n-Are you happy?\n\n0:42:430:42:45\n\n-Yes, ecstatic.\n\n-You won't shout at me at the auction?\n\n-No.\n\n0:42:450:42:49\n\n-Let's not put any naked flames near her.\n\n-Here you are, Rhoda.\n\n0:42:500:42:54\n\n-Thank you so much.\n\n-Goodbye, Diana.\n\n-Get back in your box!\n\n0:42:540:42:57\n\n-\"Don't want to go back in the box!\"\n\n-She's going back in the box.\n\n-\"I don't want to go back in the box!\"\n\n0:42:570:43:01\n\n# I love you, but do you love me?\n\n0:43:010:43:05\n\n# Oh, Diana, can't you see? #\n\n0:43:050:43:09\n\nWell, that rather unusual purchase completes their shopping.\n\n0:43:090:43:12\n\nSo, what will they make of each other's offerings?\n\n0:43:120:43:15\n\n-I was going to let the lady reveal first.\n\n-I think we should.\n\n0:43:150:43:18\n\n- I think that was very sensible. - Oh, really? Yes.\n\n0:43:180:43:21\n\n-So, I'm going to take this off first.\n\n-Right. Oh, interesting!\n\n0:43:210:43:25\n\nHe IS an actor!\n\n0:43:250:43:26\n\n-We've obviously got a doggie here.\n\n-A Winstanley bulldog.\n\n0:43:260:43:29\n\nI know, but I've seen the cat - I've never seen a bulldog.\n\n0:43:290:43:32\n\n-I've never seen a Winstanley bulldog.\n\n-And I think he's rather charming.\n\n0:43:320:43:36\n\n-OK, and the pair of chairs?\n\n-The pair of chairs, again.\n\n-Are they inlaid?\n\n0:43:360:43:39\n\n-Shall we walk round? Come on, Kevin.\n\n-Yeah, no, they're inlaid.\n\n0:43:390:43:42\n\nI did want a chair but we got a pair.\n\n0:43:420:43:45\n\nInlaid. And I've just seen the horror show!\n\n0:43:450:43:48\n\n-Yes, yes.\n\n-Oh, my God Almighty!\n\n0:43:480:43:51\n\n-Do you know, that's the reaction I wanted!\n\n-What have we done?\n\n0:43:510:43:55\n\nDo you know, I thought rather than go safe, we'd go hideous, didn't we?\n\n0:43:550:43:59\n\n-Yes, we did.\n\n-Well, that you achieved, let me tell you.\n\n-Thank you.\n\n0:43:590:44:03\n\n-How much is the horror show?\n\n-20 quid.\n\n0:44:030:44:05\n\nSo, how much have you spent?\n\n0:44:050:44:07\n\n-Actually, I'm sorry. We didn't spend a lot.\n\n-20, 60, 80.\n\n-£205.\n\n0:44:070:44:13\n\nWe spent that on the first day!\n\n0:44:130:44:15\n\nYeah, well, they're playing a canny game that I would never have considered myself.\n\n0:44:150:44:19\n\nLet's have a look at your booty, then, chaps.\n\n0:44:190:44:22\n\n-Oh, my gosh!\n\n-So a pirate's pipe holder.\n\n0:44:220:44:26\n\nFor travelling pipes.\n\n0:44:260:44:29\n\n-Cos you're pirates here!\n\n-I love it!\n\n0:44:290:44:32\n\nThis is a compass from a World War II Lancaster or Wellington bomber.\n\n0:44:320:44:38\n\n-Oh!\n\n-Oh, wow!\n\n-Where did you get that?\n\n0:44:380:44:41\n\nWe got that in one of the untidiest places I've ever been in my life\n\n0:44:410:44:44\n\nand, of course, this has a great relevance to me as\n\n0:44:440:44:46\n\nbeing the instrument upon which the theme tune for Hancock is played.\n\n0:44:460:44:50\n\n-I like that.\n\n-Mark and Phyllis definitely approve.\n\n0:44:500:44:53\n\nBut the centrepiece, and the biggest gamble for us, is...\n\n0:44:530:44:57\n\nWhoosh!
