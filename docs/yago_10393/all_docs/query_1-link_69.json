        "text": "One of classic literature’s greatest mysteries is about to come to life.\n\nKeeley Hawes (Bodyguard) and Rose Leslie (Game of Thrones) will star in Miss Austen, a new drama coming soon to Masterpiece on PBS. Hawes plays Cassandra, the sister of literary great Jane Austen, who infamously burned Jane’s letters after her death. But Miss Austen reimagines that tale as “a fascinating, witty and heartbreaking story of sisterly love,” per the official description.\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nTVLine Items: Lena Dunham's New Series, Live Tennis on Netflix and More\n\nThe Night Agent Season 2: Amanda Warren Joins Hit Netflix Drama\n\nFBI: International's Heida Reed to Exit During Season 3 (Exclusive)\n\nLeslie plays Cassandra’s friend Isabella, who is about to lose her home after her father’s death. Cassandra wants to help Isabella, but she also wants to find a stash of her late sister Jane’s private letters that could ruin Jane’s reputation if they came out. The letters take Cassandra on a trip down memory lane, with flashbacks to her and Jane together as kids: “Finding a way to guide Isabella towards true happiness, Cassandra is finally able to understand and celebrate the sacrifices she chose to make for her brilliant sister, Jane.”\n\nJoining Hawes and Leslie in the cast are Jessica Hynes (Years and Years), Phyllis Logan (Downton Abbey), Kevin McNally (The Crown) and Max Irons (Condor). Andrea Gibb (Call the Midwife, Sanditon) pens the adaptation of Gill Hornby’s bestselling novel, with Aisling Walsh (Elizabeth Is Missing) serving as director.\n\nCheck out the photo above for a first look at Miss Austen, and then tell us in the comments, Masterpiece fans: Will you be watching?\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nStars Who Almost Played Other TV Roles — on Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, Lost, Gilmore Girls, Friends and Other Shows\n\nTV Stars Almost Cast in Other Roles\n\nFall TV Preview: Who's In?
