Pirates of the Caribbean star Kevin McNally has reportedly been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.

The actor, who played Joshamee Gibbs in the film series, was said to have been detained just before attending the world's biggest Doctor Who convention in Los Angeles.

McNally, who is married to Downton Abbey star Phyllis Logan, was reportedly released on bail for £40,000 and is due in court next month, according to The Sun.

LA police told the publication that the actor "was held on suspicion of inflicting an injury that caused a traumatic condition on a victim who was his current or former spouse, cohabitant, or child’s parent."

His wife, who plays Mrs Hughes in Downton Abbey, reportedly denied knowing about the arrest.
