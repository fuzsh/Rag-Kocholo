“For me photography is a way to understand and accept the world. It’s an ‘excuse’ to travel and meet the most incredible people. Light is fundamental. Everything is transformed by light. I see in black and white. By eliminating color I can focus on shadow and texture… I take things away in order to put it elsewhere, to get closer to the substance. The portrait is both my favorite style of photography and the most difficult. It’s always a very emotional affair, because everyone is imbued with his or her own mystery, something sacred and impossible to grasp. Through my portraits, I try to come close to that .”
