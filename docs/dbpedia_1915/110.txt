The post-production of a photo can be an adventure. Realizing this single cover, we found ourselves working in the company of an outstanding assortment of creative minds. Maybe they are worth mentioning: Phil Knott, who has portrayed folks like 50 Cent, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Amy Winehouse; stylist Brett Alan Nelson, who – simply – collaborates with Nicki Minaj, David La Chapelle and Schön! Magazine; hair stylist Larry Dean McDaniel, always in league with David La Chapelle, trusted ally of Pamela Anderson, Mariah Carey and Katy Perry; Make Up Artist Lola Arellano, Co-founder and CEO of the independent cosmetic company Melt Cosmetics. Ivana’s magnificent head piece deserves special attention, since it was created by the designer and performer Malakai: his wearable arts are worn by Beyoncé, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Emily Ratajkowski, Winnie Harlow and Katy Perry. Just saying.
