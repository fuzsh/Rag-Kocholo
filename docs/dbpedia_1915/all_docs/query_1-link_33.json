        "text": "\"Entrepreneurship at Purdue is dead.\" That's what I heard when I got here in Fall 2020. After 3 years of building and rebuilding orgs on campus, I learned one important lesson: organizations that use resources as their main attraction often captivate short-term builders, those at the top of the \"founder funnel.\" However, getting people that are willing to go deeper required a different approach, both at the institutional level and the student level. Thankfully, under the leadership of President Mung Chiang, Purdue has made monumental strides to back founders at an institutional level (in a matter of months). Purdue Innovates now exists and has quickly become an invaluable asset. However to this day there still remains a void - a space for student builders to chat, ideate, and connect. With this in mind, I helped start Purdue Founders. Our goal is simple: get builders to meet other builders. We meet every Saturday at 1PM – sharing our triumphs, challenges, learnings, and most importantly, building together. My hope for the future is that we students will finally have a 24/7 space on campus where we have the flexibility to create new things. Until then, Purdue Founders is here so we can continue to support one another at the student level. I have no idea if this thesis will work, only time will tell. Building something at Purdue? Check out Purdue Founders at www.purduefounders.com and let's connect!\n\n“You don’t necessarily get success in everything you do,” he said. “You have to persist, you have to keep doing the best you can do. I also think you have to be humble, caring and empathetic. That’s really important. Work hard and be humble.” As an alumna of UB, this philosophy resonates deeply with my own experiences. The path to success isn’t linear, and my time at UB solidified that understanding. Persistence, humility, empathy—these were not just words, but principles embodied by the supportive community of the university. Whether it was tackling a complex music theory concept, performing in front of a discerning audience, or engaging in the rich interdisciplinary dialogues that pushed my boundaries, the embrace of these values was a consistent theme. They say the character of a place is a reflection of its leaders, and I found UB’s environment to be a testament to this truth. Despite the many challenges I encountered, I always found that ethical and moral values were a priority rooted in empathy, understanding and respect. In a world that often rewards only the outcomes, it’s these processes and attitudes that shape a meaningful and impactful journey. To current students, I echo this: keep striving with dedication and humility. To fellow professionals, I encourage embracing these traits in all that we do. #UniversityAtBuffalo #AlumniPride #Persistency #Humility #Empathy #MusicTheory #Lifelo\n\nComing to UC Berkeley has been one of the most exhilarating, rigorous, and exciting experiences I've ever had. The real challenge wasn't just the nerve-wracking multivariable calculus exams or pulling all-nighters to finish papers—though neither was a walk in the park. Instead, it came in the form of bouts of loneliness and the struggle to form deep friendships. Initially, the advice I received was to 'give it time,' as I had taken years to form my close high school friendships. This felt invalidating and made it even harder to speak up. However, an article I stumbled upon in one of my classes mentioned that loneliness is actually one of the biggest epidemics of my generation. I was floored! It turns out, I wasn’t alone in feeling alone. Astonishingly, about 70% of college girls report feeling lonely. Shocked by this, and with a background in startups since age 15, I knew I had stumbled upon a major problem and was determined to solve it. Thus, Quilly was born on my dorm room floor. Quilly is a startup dedicated to helping college girls make real-world friendships and build their on-campus community. Over the past seven months, we've been working tirelessly to find the perfect solution, including unique elements like integrating romance novels and self-discovery into our offerings. One of the biggest joys of founding Quilly has been meeting incredible young women who inspire me daily. Each friendship formed from the first Quilly chapter at Cal has been genuine and touching proof of our concept's impact. I am so excited to soon show the world what we have been working on and extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has supported and uplifted our mission along the way. Find the girls you can call up, lean on, and read with. That's Quilly. Give our Instagram a follow in the meantime @official.quilly. #startups #collegegirls #parents #college #ucberkeley #innovation #femalefounder\n\nThrilled to announce my team (Nandini Aggarwal, Arellys Tapia, Jando Granillo) and myself placed 1st overall in the Dartmouth Investment and Philanthropy Program Freshman Showcase Stock Pitch Competition.

None of my accomplishments as a VC would have been possible without the allyship of my high school calculus teacher, Mr. Esch. Mr. Esch is a white gay man who, I believe, saw a lot of himself in me. I was just one of three Black girls in my class. We both found ourselves outside of the boxes of a school as prestigious as Francis Parker. I didn’t expect to do well in calculus and constantly doubted myself. Mr. Esch on the other hand, knew that I had a knack for math and supported me in order to make sure I was successful. I had him as a mirror, letting me know that even though I felt differently, I should trust my instincts and not give up. Without him, I don’t believe I would have ever thought a career like VC - where mathematical analysis is an important part of our work - was a fit for me. It’s not easy to thrive in a culture where society tells you that you don’t belong - whether that’s calculus class in the 90s or the startup ecosystem of 2024. To everyone out there who feels like an outsider in a world they’re eager to participate in - you’re not alone, and I’m rooting for you. Lean on your allies, don’t give up and always remember to pay that kindness shown to you forward. #allyship #empowerment #venturecapital #venturecapitalistlife"
