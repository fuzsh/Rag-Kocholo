        "text": "BROOKINGS — Bison specialists from across the United States and Canada gathered in Brookings recently for the second International Bison Health Symposium, attended by nearly 140 producers, veterinarians, tribal leaders, government officials, researchers and zoo managers.\n\nThe three-day symposium was co-sponsored by the South Dakota State University Department of Animal Science and Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences along with the National Bison Association, based in Denver, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAttendees heard different presentations focusing on bison health and research, with topics ranging from genomic research, genetic diversity, gut bacteria, micronutrients, using infrared thermal imaging, parasites and traceability to an in-depth focus on diseases such as malignant catarrhal fever and Mycoplasma bovis. Graduate students and researchers from American and Canadian universities also presented 15 poster exhibits highlighting their research.\n\nPhilip Urso, SDSU assistant professor of bison studies, was key in organizing the event, and he noted the support of the Center of Excellence for Bison Studies. “The Center of Excellence is a partnership between SDSU, the National Bison Association and the National Buffalo Foundation,” Urso said. “Housed at SDSU, the center focuses on advancing the industry through support of our nation’s national mammal.”\n\nIn addition to support from university resources, Urso said organizations in the community also contributed greatly to the decision to bring this exclusive event to Brookings. “Visit Brookings and the Chamber of Commerce provided materials for the conference and offered recommendations to guests for meals and other activities in the community,” Urso said. “They really helped us make our guests feel welcomed to campus and the community.”\n\nNational Bison Association officials appreciated the symposium, the first of its kind in 10 years, and intend to schedule another. “We are really energized from the second International Bison Health Symposium,” said Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association.\n\nThe National Bison Association’s Karen Conley, Bison World editor, added, “Gathering these bison health professionals together leads to sharing resources and networking, exchanging ideas and best practices with the ultimate goal of keeping bison healthy and thriving.”"
