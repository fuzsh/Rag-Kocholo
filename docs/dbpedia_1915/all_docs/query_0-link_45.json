        "text": "Since I work from home, and was having lunch - I pulled out my copy of Passing Ships and listened to Plantation Bag - no distortion whatsoever.\n\nAnd if it is my setup that is trying to unsuccessfully track the Tone Poet cut of Pictures of Heath, and believe me it seems like more than distortion - it sounds like a skip and loud crackle (yet watching the stylus it does not jump), and a lot of others are having the same issue - then should the LP be re-cut?\n\nI don't pretend to actually know what is going on with POH. tracking issue? pressing issue? stamper issue? Whatever it is it occurs in more than one spot on side 2 in different songs.\n\nThanks for checking. My POH copy plays good except it has issue on side 2 track 4 where it is stuck in endless loop. Never encountered this issue ever. What can do this?\n\nDo I take it that your two copies exhibit the same issue at differing spots? If so, that eliminates stamper fault, surely?\n\nNo that I’ve examined the ‘spot’ closely it is as clear as day, stitching and not ‘hot’; it actually jumps to the adjacent groove on mine missing some of the music and since playing again occurs in 2 other places on track 3. The rest of the album is faultless.\n\nFTR I’m using a relatively high compliance cart (15) that tracks Passing Ships without fault. My Dynavector XV-1t flagship cart (10) mistracks on Plantation Bag in the same spot on 2 copies and everyone else’s here too but even the former can’t cope with a physical defect like this one. I’ve ordered a replacement so I’ll be able to compare side by side and report back.\n\nAs far as Plantation Bag is concerned, some really high end cards had issues and some didnt. Some cheaper carts had issues, and some didnt. It was not based on the level of gear with that one. I think it's simply that some can hear that kind of distortion and some cannot. There are those in the Miles MoFi thread who swear they cannot hear the distortion from 1:50-1:58\n\nI'm convinced our brains just process audio differently across the board\n\nRE: the distortion discussion, so much more goes into distortion, whether it is caused by the playback system or simply revealed by the playback system, or the mastering, or whatever. It goes far beyond cartridge.\n\nIIRC, a member that had heard a direct rip of the master of Passing Ships says the distortion is on the tape. I hear it on both my Delos and my AT VM540ML, FWIW.\n\nFor actual torture tests; ie, ones we know can be tracked with a proper setup, my Delos out tracks the AT cart. At least on my VPI arm through the Chinook with preferred loading, resistance, etc for each. Again, so many more variables are at play. Sometimes distortion that has nothing to do with tracking is attributed to it because of a prevailing over-simplified narrative on LP sound reproduction.\n\nThat’s right I forgot about that. It was @Dean R saying it’s on the tapes but here we are again with @MikeT saying he doesn’t hear it at all. I think some hear it and some don’t regardless of your setup\n\nMine doesn't. Don't forget, the arm and how well it matches with the cartridge is a factor, too, as well as how well the cartridge has been set up.\n\nI should say... mine doesn't seem to, to me. It has been mentioned that the problem is on the tape... that could still mean that some equipment (and ears) makes it more obvious than others, I think.\n\nFor me it's in 2 spots on one song.\n\nAnd yes I noticed the distortion in Plantation bag\n\nAnyone been able to compare the Pure Pleasure Picture of Heath with this new pressing?\n\nI have the Pure Pleasure and not sure if this newer pressing is substantially better?\n\nThis is from the Pure Pleasure site:\n\nFirst released under the title \" Playboys\" in 1956, with the pinup model on the cover, it was the re-released under the title \"Picture Of Heath\" in 1961.Owing to the fact it carried the same name and favoured images of the men's magazine.\n\nThis was the third session together of the dynamic duo of Chet Baker and Art Pepper, the previous two having been unequivocal success. Once again Baker and Pepper had an instinctual rapport that yielded outstanding interpaly.These thoroughly enjoyable and often high-energy sides are perfect for bop connoisseurs as well as mainstream jazz listeners. This beautiful sounding piece of vinyl was re-mastered from the orginal mono analogue tapes.\n\nPersonnel: Chet Baker -Trumpet / Art Pepper - Alto Saxaphone / Phil Urso - Tenor Saxaphone / Carl Perkins - Piano / Curtis Counce - Bass / Lawerence Marable - Drums\n\nTracklisting:\n\nSide A: 1.Picture Of Heath 2.For Miles And Miles 3.C.T.A\n\nSide B: 1.For Minors Only 2.Minor Yours 3.
