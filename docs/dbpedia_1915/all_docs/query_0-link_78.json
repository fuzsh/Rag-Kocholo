        "text": "Merseyside police have arrested 11 people in Liverpool following widespread disorder today.\n\nThe force said more will follow once officers have trawled CCTV, bodycam and camera phone footage.\n\nCars and a building have been set on fire in south Belfast, with police urging the public to avoid parts of the city.\n\nA cafe and bins have been set alight in the Sandy Row area. The Police Service of Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue officers are dealing with the unrest.\n\nA PSNI spokesman said: “Police are dealing with ongoing disorder in the Donegall Road area of south Belfast tonight. This disorder has resulted in a business premises being set on fire. The public should avoid the Donegall Road and Sandy Row areas.”\n\nPolice in Lancashire arrested 20 people during today’s disorder as a senior officer condemned “mindless thuggery” across the county.\n\nThere was large-scale disorder in Blackpool as well as smaller pockets of unrest in Preston and Blackburn. Phil Davies, assistant chief constable, said: “In Blackpool, we have witnessed some mindless thuggery from individuals, who we believe to be from outside of the county, intent on causing issues in our communities.”\n\nMore than 4,000 riot police are on standby to deal with any further disorder over the weekend, a spokesman for the National Police Chiefs’ Council has said.\n\nChief Constable B J Harrington, who speaks on public order matters, said that forces were braced for further violence over the coming days, but warned demonstrators: “If you’ve been involved but haven’t been arrested yet, your time will come.”\n\nHe added: “In recent days we have seen criminals masquerading as protesters, causing senseless destruction. These people are not protesters, they’re violent thugs — and many have already been arrested and charged.”\n\nShops in Liverpool, Hull and Manchester have been broken into and looted during rioting across the country.\n\nIn Manchester city centre, a Sainsbury’s supermarket was forced to close after it was “stormed” by a masked group. They grabbed items which were then thrown during demonstrations.\n\nIn Liverpool, police confirmed that a phone shop was “damaged, broken into and looted”.\n\nChildren visiting a Disney cruise ship in Liverpool were forced to flee following riots today, according to Merseyside police’s assistant chief constable.\n\n“What should have been a sunny Saturday on the historic waterfront to be enjoyed by people of all ages turned into an afternoon of unashamed disorder and violence, which potentially put decent members of the public, including children, at risk,” said Jenny Sims, who led the policing operation.\n\n“We have heard reports of families having to run away from the area, some of whom had brought children to see the Disney Princess cruise ship docked nearby.” Two officers have been taken to hospital, one with a suspected broken nose and another with a suspected broken jaw, Merseyside police said. They have arrested six people so far.\n\nWarning: graphic images\n\nGroups of men, some wearing balaclavas, are facing off with riot police in the centre of Bristol.\n\nAround 700 people descended on Castle Park for a far-right demonstration at 7pm. However, the majority of those in attendance were counter-protesters. Objects have been hurled at officers who have responded by deploying dogs to quell the unrest. Fights have broken out within the crowds.\n\nA spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said the force had made “multiple arrests” and is advising the public to avoid the area\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Hilary Benn, has condemned today’s disorder in Belfast.\n\nShops have been targeted in the centre of Hull where there are fires burning in the street. Violent disorder began earlier today with protesters gathering outside a hotel in the city that has been used to house migrants. Some protesters are live-streaming events on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nA Shoezone shop in the centre of the city has been damaged and there is a fire burning outside close to its entrance.\n\nViolence has broken out between far-right demonstrators and counter-protesters who have gathered in Bristol’s Castle Park. More than 500 people were estimated to have turned up for a rally scheduled to begin at 7pm.\n\nPolice in riot gear are at the scene and at least one person has been arrested. The number of counter-protesters far outweighs the number of those associated with the far-right.\n\nWhile some of my colleagues across the country were reporting on the violent disorder first hand, I was in our London office scrolling through TikTok, where much of the disorder was live-streamed in real time (Joey D’Urso, senior data journalist, writes).\n\nAt times, it felt almost like being embedded with the far-right. I could listen to people speaking with their guard down, forgetting they were broadcasting to thousands of people while filming what was in front of them.\n\nI heard false rumours that a stabbing took place in Stoke-on-Trent — information that was later debunked by Staffordshire police who denounced the “false” rumours spreading online. I was also struck by the casual bigotry I heard several times in different streams, with protesters using racist slurs and making baseless allegations of crimes against children.\n\nThere is continuing disorder in Liverpool following a day of rioting (David Collins writes).\n\nThe chaos has spread into Liverpool’s shopping district where one topless man was bundled into a riot van by police at around 6.45pm. Officers in large numbers were seen heading towards Mathew Street, home of the world-famous music venue, the Cavern Club. The street is known for bars and pubs popular with stag and hen dos.\n\nThere have been a number of arrests and reports of injured police officers following a day of protest across the country linked to the far-right movement (Glen Keogh writes).\n\nA number of officers were injured in Liverpool following what Merseyside police described as “serious disorder” in the city centre, including one who was hit in the head with a chair. Four people were arrested in Hull and three officers were injured when they intervened at a demonstration targeting a hotel housing asylum seekers.\n\nIn Stoke-on-Trent, four men have been arrested after bricks and fireworks were hurled at police officers and there were arrests during a demonstration in the centre of Nottingham.\n\nThe protest in Leeds has wound down for the time being, after the remaining stragglers from both sides left the city centre (Dominic Hauschild writes).\n\nA police sergeant told me that he wasn’t expecting any further incidents tonight, adding that while some people might consider the number of officers on duty today heavy-handed, he thinks the force was simply “well-prepared” for today’s events.\n\nThere was limited violence throughout the afternoon. No official numbers have been confirmed yet, although at least one person has been arrested.\n\nThe prime minister, deputy prime minister, home and justice secretaries and policing minister have held a meeting to discuss the violent unrest across the UK. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, expressed gratitude to police who responded to violence in Sunderland on Friday night including four officers who were injured.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, denounced “thuggery” and said that “criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain’s streets” and that people have the “right to feel safe”.\n\nShe added: “We’ve been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.”\n\nA local in Hanley, near Stoke-on-Trent, who had been unable to return home while getting milk because of the protest said “it breaks my heart to see Stoke look like this” (Shayma Bakht writes).\n\nThe man, who did not want to be named, added: “We all bleed the same. I work for a Pakistani man and my best friend is Asian. We don’t want racists here. If I walk across that bridge, the Muslims will mistake me for a racist and that makes me sad.”\n\nMeanwhile, counter-protesters stormed a police cordon to reach anti-immigration rioters.\n\nTwo punks attending the annual Rebellion festival in Blackpool said they were standing against the right-wing protesters because of punk’s long tradition “fighting fascism”.\n\n“You can’t be a punk and scream words of protest and then not do something about it,” Cameron, 24, said. “We had to be here today,” Becca, 21, said. “They’re angry at whatever they believe in but they’re trying to claim it’s a peaceful protest and that the left of the ones that are violent, but they’re the ones that are starting everything.”\n\nPolice in Stoke-on-Trent have said that there had not been any stabbings during disorder in the town after reports had circulated on social media claiming there had.\n\n“We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media,” a police spokesman said. “We can confirm a man was injured after being hit by a blunt object that was thrown. His injuries are not thought to be serious and he has been taken to hospital for treatment.”\n\nAround half a dozen people who are believed to have sustained injuries during the unrest have been admitted to an A&E department in the city, according to a doctor at the University Hospitals of North Midlands Trust. Four men have been arrested in connection with the disorder and are in custody for questioning.\n\nMerseyside’s police commissioner, Emily Spurrell, has condemned the violence that has erupted in Liverpool city centre, leaving a number of officers injured.\n\n“This is not protest,” she wrote on X. “It is mindless crime and disorder. And it is not welcome in our city or our region. Those involved should expect to feel the full force of the law.”\n\nA group of about 50 far-right protesters were kettled to one side of a bridge opposite a Kurdish mosque in Stoke-on-Trent, while a group of about 200 counter-protesters surrounded the building on the opposite side.\n\nEarlier the protesters were seen storming the Masjid Salahuddin mosque in Hanley and were seen throwing bricks at police officers and worshippers. Masked counter-protesters carrying batons and metal rods were seen attacking two of the protesters, who received medical attention for head injuries. Hundreds of counter-protesters stormed across the roads beneath the bridge to confront protesters and residents on the other side but were pushed back by police.\n\nShops and the pubs in the town centre were forced to close. “We are aware of pockets of disorder in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, today,” Stoke-on-Trent police said in a statement. “Members of the public are advised to avoid the area while officers deal with the incident.”\n\nClaims that the organiser of a march in Middlesbrough on Sunday was arrested on terrorism charges are “misinformation”, the police have said.\n\nTommy Robinson, the far-right agitator, said on Friday that a Middlesbrough march organiser had been “locked up on terrorism charges”. However, Cleveland Police said they had arrested a 29-year-old man over firearms offences on Friday, with no arrests being made in relation to terrorism.\n\n“We are aware of misinformation being shared on social media relating to a planned event in Middlesbrough tomorrow,” the force said. “Cleveland Police has not arrested anyone in connection with terrorism offences. A 29-year-old Middlesbrough man was arrested yesterday on suspicion of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. He remains in police custody being questioned and inquiries continue.”\n\nMerseyside police have confirmed that a number of officers have been injured during unrest in Liverpool city centre.\n\n“This behaviour, which puts the public and our officers in harm’s way, will not be tolerated. And we will be arresting those responsible,” a police spokesman said in a statement.\n\nEarlier, a young female police officer had been hurt while dealing with the disorder at the waterfront. A number of projectiles including a chair and bricks were thrown at officers, while another was kicked off a motorbike by a protester.\n\nJames Cleverly, the shadow home secretary, has blamed Labour for failing to restore public order, claiming the party voted against measures which would have given the police greater powers when they were in opposition (Mauricio Alencar writes).\n\nCleverly also said that Keir Starmer’s decision to take the knee in the past “sent completely the wrong message”. “Now they are in government, Labour need to clamp down immediately on the violence that we have seen across the country and send a clear message to the thugs that they will be met with the full strength of the law,” he said.\n\n“The public expects the government to restore order. The prime minister and home secretary must do more to demonstrate that they are gripping this situation.”\n\nA police van was attacked in Blackpool where violent protesters had assembled near the north pier.\n\nA video from the scene posted on social media showed police mounted on horses, as well as officers with dogs pushing them back. Earlier, men in football shirts in the seaside town had been heard shouting “England ‘til I die”.\n\nViolence is continuing on The Strand on Liverpool’s waterfront as a young female police officer is injured and knocked down.\n\nRiot police surround her as far-right protesters encircle them — some saying “she deserved it” and another shouting “any more pictures and I’ll be charging £5 a time”.\n\nBottles, bricks and chairs were thrown as violence escalated at the waterfront. “We’ve all got kids you traitors,” shouts one woman at the police, holding a sign saying “Leave our innocent kids alone” patterned with the Union Jack flag.\n\nThe Liverpool march began peacefully at 2pm but became more aggressive when an anti-fascist group was allowed to confront protesters (David Collins writes).\n\nThe two groups met in the street at around 3pm and the rioting began soon after. Dave Jones, 62, a gardener, claimed: “This is not just about Southport, this feeling has been going on for years. I don’t think the government is doing anything.”\n\nWave after wave of protesters clashed with police by the Liver Building on Liverpool’s waterfront as masked men threw bricks, bottles and chairs in chaotic and at times lawless scenes (David Collins writes).\n\nCrowds surged and moved close to a statue of The Beatles, as people shouted “save our kids”, “two-tier policing” and “stop the boats”. Red and green flares were fired off as people driving in cars with their families inside made desperate turns in The Strand, crunching their bumpers on the kerb in an effort to get away.\n\nIn another part of the city, drones and a light aircraft flew overhead to monitor the violence.\n\nPolice in riot gear have blocked off The Strand along Liverpool’s waterfront, closing the busy thoroughfare to traffic, as officers charged to push back violent demonstrators.\n\nOne police officer was kicked off a motorbike, and members of the violent crowd threw bricks, a chair and a traffic cone at police. A man was seen holding a wooden pole as protesters ran down the street after it happened.\n\nOfficers in the city centre issued a dispersal order, meaning they can seize objects from anyone committing anti-social behaviour and arrest anybody who tries to return to the area.\n\nFar-right protesters in Blackpool clashed with a group of punks, who were visiting the seaside town for the annual Rebellion festival.\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the town hall in Talbot Square, where chants of “England till I die” and “we want our country back” were heard. Counter-protesters returned verbal volleys of “Nazi scum off our streets” as bottles were thrown and minor skirmishes broke out.\n\nOne woman holding a placard saying “thugs (and) racists not welcome” had it torn from her hands as crowds surged towards the Metropole hotel on the prom, which was chosen by the government to house asylum seekers.\n\nThere’s real anger in Liverpool, where thousands of people have now gathered by the Liver Building on the waterfront (David Collins writes).\n\nI’ve seen protesters sprayed with tear gas by police and masked men throwing chairs at police officers. There have been times when it has felt quite lawless, but officers are doing a better job of keeping protesters and the anti-fascist group apart.\n\nThere’s a heavy police presence in Preston, but so far the march has been limited to around 20 anti-immigration protesters and 40 counter-demonstrators (Tom Witherow writes).\n\nThe only unrest came at around 3pm when an unrelated arrest took place near the protest, causing anger from the woman’s family and the public. Dozens of police, including three riot vans, flooded the area but peace was restored once the woman had been taken away.\n\nProtesters with St George’s and union flags in Nottingham’s Market Square have been met with counter-protesters chanting “racist scum off our streets” and “Nazis not welcome”.\n\nScuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other on King Street at about 3pm, with bottles and other items thrown from both sides. Chants of “England until I die” and “Tommy Robinson” were drowned out by boos from the counter-protesters.\n\nMinisters are expected to hold a group call on Saturday afternoon to discuss public order as a series of planned protests escalated across the UK.\n\nArrests have already been made in Belfast and Manchester, and riot police are on the streets in several towns with more demonstrations expected throughout the day. On Thursday Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced the launch of a violent-disorder unit after an emergency meeting with police chiefs in Downing Street over violent scenes in Southport.\n\n“Let’s be very clear about this,” Starmer said. “It’s not protest. It’s not legitimate. It’s crime and violent disorder. An assault on the rule of law and the execution of justice.”\n\nCrowds of masked counterprotesters have gathered in Hanley, Stoke-in-Trent, where they are surrounding hundreds of people holding an anti-immigration rally (Shayma Bakht writes).\n\nRocks, bricks and fireworks were thrown between the groups as police in riot gear created a wall to separate them.\n\nEarlier the far-right crowd had surrounded the Masjid Salahuddin mosque but masked groups dispersed to the town centre.\n\nGroups of south Asian boys from the Coty Centre mosque were carrying batons and wooden sticks to confront the crowd.\n\n“I told my kids to stay at home. I told them they’re not allowed to leave the house,” explained one Pakistani taxi driver.\n\n“I won’t be driving in that area near that mosque where they gathered.”\n\nJohn Crooke, 62, a plasterer from Bradford, has travelled to Liverpool for the rally today (David Collins writes). He believes the government is not listening to people like him — who “are not racist or far right”, but have concerns about immigration.\n\n“I grew up in an area of Bradford which these days is like a no-go area and nobody wants to admit it. Forty years ago my mother would clean the stone steps of the house and we’d go to church. Now you can’t walk those streets [in Manningham, Bradford].\n\n“The government want to say we’re far right. But we’re not. I’ve had to move three times in Bradford, because the community isn’t integrated and certain parts of it think they can do what they want. It’s time somebody starts to listen.”\n\nFor a third time, the far-right protest in Leeds has set off on an unscheduled and unsanctioned march (Dominic Hauschild writes).\n\nIt is clearly presenting a complex logistical challenge for the police, who are having to maintain order at two separate demonstrations — one of which is moving around erratically.\n\nThe march is making its way through the town centre, chanting “Oh, Tommy Robinson”, as well as offensive remarks about Islam.\n\nThere is tension at the Liver Building in Liverpool, where about 300 anti-immigration protesters are in a stand-off with anti-fascist groups, who have marched here from a different part of a city (David Collins writes).\n\nThere are shouts in support of Tommy Robinson, as well as chants of “save our kids” and “stop the boats”. The anti-fascist groups shout chants back in return.\n\nOne man with three children who has come from Southport told me: “I’ve seen this rally on social media and come from Southport. It’s awful what has happened with the kids in the dance school. They don’t seem to be vetting immigrants, in my view. I don’t mind immigrants, but there seems to be no checks about the sort of people coming into the country and I’m worried for my own children.”\n\nA large group of far-right protesters has gathered outside of the Royal Hotel in the centre of Hull, where asylum seekers are housed (Nicole Gibbons writes).\n\nPolice armed with riot shields are lined outside the hotel entrance, as demonstrators chant and fly English flags. One protester holds a sign reading “No Justice, Starmer Traitor’’. The police have closed the road outside the hotel as they attempt to dispel the crowd.\n\nFootage circulating on social media shows that road signs, traffic cones and beer bottles have been thrown at the police and the entrance of the hotel.\n\nA large number of anti-immigration protesters have now gathered at Queen’s University Belfast, about a mile away from the protest at City Hall.\n\nPolice have sealed off a number of roads close to the demonstration, where bottles and missiles have been thrown.\n\nViolence briefly broke out at the Leeds demonstration after a member of the right-wing rally was arrested by police. Officers used their batons as protesters threw punches and shouted about “police brutality” (Dominic Hauschild writes).\n\nAfter the situation was calmed down by the arrival of dozens more officers, the protest set off on a second unsanctioned march around the city.\n\nTwo opposing protests near Old Market Square in the centre of Nottingham are being live streamed on TikTok.\n\nAs is the case in other big cities, left-wing counterprotesters seem to be as vocal and numerous as the right-wing activists waving England flags and chanting about the stabbing in Southport.\n\nAmid anger at the stabbing attack in Southport, a false claim on an obscure news site created a viral storm that was latched on to by far-right extremists linked to the English Defence League.\n\nChannel 3 Now, an obscure news website that publishes potentially AI-generated US and UK content, was at the centre of the online disinformation storm resulting in riots in Southport, after it falsely blamed the mass stabbing of children on a fictitious asylum seeker on a security watchlist.\n\nAmong those who shared the false claims on social media were Andrew Tate, the misogynist influencer, and Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the far-right English Defence League.\n\n• Read in full: What caused the riots in Southport?\n\nThe anti-immigration protest in Leeds has returned to Leeds Art Gallery after setting off on an unscheduled march (Dominic Hauschild).\n\nVisibly anxious police officers are trying to maintain a separation between the protest and a Stand Up to Racism counter-demonstration. More reinforcements have been brought in to control the crowds.\n\nEarlier, the unsanctioned march began shouting at police officers, chanting “Where were you in Harehills?”, referring to the area of Leeds that has a high migrant population and where violent riots took place two weeks ago.\n\nA TikTok live stream shows protesters in Stoke-on-Trent throwing objects at police and setting off fireworks.\n\nSome protesters are chanting racial slurs and offensive slogans about Islam.\n\nThere is a heavy police presence in the city after the march which started in Hanley.\n\nThe entire group of English nationalist protesters have departed from outside Leeds Art Gallery in an apparently unscheduled march through the city (Dominic Hauschild writes). It is now making its way through the Trinity Leeds shopping centre.\n\nA police liaison officer declined to say whether this was permitted, but did add that they were prepared to enforce restrictions if necessary. “The situation remains fluid,” he said.\n\nThe demonstration had become heated after the far-right demonstrators traded insults with a much larger group of counterprotesters.\n\nA priest at Sunderland Minster has accused last night’s rioters of “sacrilege” after some were seen trying to break up gravestones to use as missiles.\n\nThe Rev Jacqui Tyson said: “They were trying to break up one of the graves in the minster. My colleague and his friend saw them and chased them off. They then locked the gates so no one else could access the graveyard.\n\n“It’s an act of sacrilege to disturb someone’s gravestone. It’s also remarkably lacking in common sense — have you tried to pick up a gravestone?”\n\nTwo men have been arrested after about 200 protesters threw objects and shouted racist abuse at a demonstration outside a hotel housing migrants in Aldershot, Hampshire, on Wednesday.\n\nHampshire police said a 32-year-old man from Farnborough and a 60-year-old man from Farnham, Surrey, had been arrested on suspicion of affray and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to stir up racial hatred.\n\nFireworks have been thrown and one person has been arrested after tense demonstrations in Belfast city centre.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland had deployed Land Rovers and riot police after a small group of anti-Islamic protesters gathered at the front of City Hall. The group chanted “Islam out” and unfurled union flags.\n\nHundreds of people also gathered for an anti-racism rally across the road. A number of Christian church leaders in Northern Ireland released statements condemning calls for protests.\n\nAnthony Flynn, the Green Party councillor for Belfast, condemned the violence. “Absolutely disgusting scenes from the far-right thugs throwing fireworks, stones, and other missiles towards a peaceful anti-fascist rally,” he wrote on Twitter/X.\n\nTwo opposing groups of demonstrators in Leeds have begun loudly trading insults, minutes after a scheduled protest was due to begin outside the city’s town hall (Dominic Hauschild writes).\n\nSeveral hundred nationalist protesters were waving St George’s Cross flags and singing “You’re not English any more” and “England ’til I die”. A significantly larger group of counterprotesters is waving Palestinian flags and shouting “Nazi scum off our streets” through a PA system.\n\nThe two sides are separated by little more than ten metres of barriers and a few dozen police officers.\n\nWhile the protests have undoubtedly relied on the far-right for publicity, they are not the only attendees at the anti-immigration rallies (Tom Witherow writes).\n\nMarch organisers have largely hidden behind anonymous social media handles before their handiwork was amplified by the likes of Tommy Robinson, the former English Defence League leader, to hundreds of thousands of adoring followers.\n\nAt the protests, reporters have observed a mix of far-right activists — thugs bruising for a fight, locals with genuine concerns about the cost of living crisis and immigration, as well as spectators.\n\nIn Liverpool last night, one woman joining the protest told me: “There’s too many immigrants here. You can’t get a doctor’s appointment and they’re prioritising foreigners over our own people. It needs to stop. If we went to their country, they’d lock us up.”\n\nWhile some of the violence has been imported from outside affected towns, many of those arrested by police have been local.\n\nWhen police announced the names of the five men charged at the Southport riot on Tuesday, four were from the town itself or nearby Formby. The fifth had not travelled far, 20 miles from St Helens.\n\nProtesters are gathering outside Hull City Hall in East Yorkshire.\n\nSeveral hundred demonstrators, many carrying England flags or Union Jacks, can be seen walking the streets.\n\nA protest in Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent is being livestreamed on TikTok to about 7,000 people.\n\nHundreds of people are marching through the streets chanting “justice for the Southport girls”, “England ’til I die” and “Oh Tommy Robinson”.\n\nMany are waving England flags and Union Jacks. One protester could be seen carrying the Knights Templar flag which is associated with freemasonry.\n\nThere is also a counterprotest holding signs saying “refugees welcome” and “stop the far right”, though it is smaller compared with those in big cities like Manchester and Liverpool.\n\nA 75-year-old grandmother of five has been hailed a hero for standing with counterprotesters at Brougham Terrace mosque in Liverpool last night (Tom Witherow writes).\n\n“Ever since the National Front in the 1970s we’ve never allowed them to come into our cities, and we continue to do that,” Pat, who has lived in the city for 35 years, told The Times.\n\n“Especially today, with all the things that have been going on, using the deaths of poor children for their own violent agendas.\n\n“We’ve got to show strength. They only work on violence, we work on solidarity.”\n\nTen people have been arrested after the violence in Sunderland last night, Northumbria police said.\n\nChief Superintendent Mark Hall said police had prepared for disorder after becoming aware of the potential for a protest.\n\nHe also issued a warning to those considering travelling to Sunderland to take part in further violence: “Do not bother. We will find you, we will take action.”\n\nThe third night of unrest produced some of the ugliest scenes so far (Tom Witherow writes). It is hard not to feel like rioters in Sunderland and Hartlepool have made the horror of Monday’s stabbing spree in Southport — and the trauma suffered by its young victims and their families — a distant memory.\n\nFour days ago the mother of Elsie Dot Stancombe, the seven-year-old killed in the attack, went on social media to call for an end to rioting in Southport, during which 53 police officers were injured. “The police have been nothing but heroic in these last 24 hours and they and we don’t need this,” she said.\n\nWhile the town has remained calm, her words have not quelled violence elsewhere. Stretched police are braced for trouble at any of the 17 planned rallies today.\n\nOne of those is in Southport. Police have imposed a dispersal order until 6pm on Sunday giving powers to direct people “who are likely to become involved in antisocial behaviour” to leave the area.\n\nThe community fought back against the rioters on Tuesday with a determined clean-up effort and widespread condemnation of the attacks on police. Will a small seaside town reeling from events earlier in the week see trouble again?\n\nFour police officers were taken to hospital after the violence in Sunderland, Northumbria police confirmed as it warned rioters they would face the “full force of the law”.\n\nThree police officers were injured as a direct result of the protests and a mounted officer suffered “serious injuries” in an accident, said Chief Superintendent Mark Hall.\n\nHall said the force was committed to preventing further attempts to “drive division”. He added: “The shocking scenes we witnessed in Sunderland last night were appalling and completely unacceptable.\n\n“During the course of the evening, our officers were met with serious and sustained levels of violence. This was not a protest — this was unforgivable violence and disorder.”\n\nPolice officers have become a “political punch bag” in recent years, a Police Federation official has said after accusations of “two-tier policing”.\n\nBrian Booth, the acting national deputy chairman of the staff association, said forces were criticised for being heavy-handed in some occasions and being too soft in others.\n\n“We’re there to uphold the law and that’s what we should do,” he told Times Radio. “We shouldn’t be taking the knee and doing political gesturing.\n\n“We should go out and deal with the public fairly and I think some of what we’re getting now is the result of trying to placate everyone else’s whims.”\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said rioters would “face the full force of the law”.\n\n“Criminals attacking the police and stoking disorder on our streets will pay the price for their violence and thuggery,” she tweeted after the outbreak of violence in Sunderland on Friday night. “They do not represent Britain.”\n\nPriti Patel, the former home secretary, called for the immediate recall of parliament as she criticised the government for being “breathtakingly complacent”.\n\nPatel, who is running for the Tory party leadership, tweeted: “The government is now in danger of appearing to be swept away with events rather than maintaining control of them.”\n\nLists circulating on social media show the locations of planned protests across England.\n\nThese include Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham and around a dozen other towns and cities.\n\nIt is unclear which of these will amount to substantive protests.\n\nThe full list:\n\n• Blackburn\n\n• Bolton\n\n• Bristol\n\n• Hull\n\n• Lancaster\n\n• Leeds\n\n• Middlesbrough\n\n• Newcastle\n\n• Portsmouth\n\n• St Helens\n\n• Weymouth\n\n• Rotherham\n\n• Liverpool\n\n• Manchester\n\n• Preston\n\n• Blackpool\n\n• Nottingham\n\nNiall Hodson, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Sunderland, said he was “indignant” over last night’s violence because it “casts the city in such a bad light”.\n\nSpeaking to Times Radio before he joined the clean-up efforts on his Millfield ward, Hodson said the “roaming riot” could have been much worse if it had not been for the police.\n\nHe dismissed links between the violence and the Southport stabbings or concerns about immigration. Hodson said: “It’s people who are looking to cause trouble and bring violence to our streets with a very feeble justification for it.\n\n“The problem is not immigration in places like Sunderland. The problem is a sort of kernel of far-right and criminal behaviour that goes unchecked and occasionally sort of releases itself in moments like we saw last night.”\n\nPolice have imposed a dispersal order in Southport until 6pm on Sunday in anticipation of further protests this weekend.\n\nThe order gives officers powers to direct people “who are likely to become involved in antisocial behaviour” to leave the area.\n\nSouth Wales police have also issued a 24-hour dispersal order for the area around the Senedd in Cardiff Bay.\n\nThe woman accused of being the first to post a false Muslim name for the Southport stabbing suspect is the managing director of a clothing company and a prominent campaigner against lockdowns and net-zero climate schemes.\n\nThe mother of three in her mid-fifties enjoys walking, is married to an artist and counts an actor among her children. The family live in a £1.5 million farmhouse in the rural north.\n\nIn a since deleted post on Twitter/X, she wrote that “Ali Al-Shakati” was the suspect and that he was an “asylum seeker who came to the UK by boat last year” and was on an “MI6 watch list”.\n\n• Read in full: The mother of three who sparked havoc with false claim about Southport suspect\n\nKim McGuinness, the metro mayor for the northeast region, described the violence in Sunderland last night as “organised far-right rioting.”\n\n“I’m just shocked and horrified,” she told Times Radio. “You know, this is not what Sunderland is about. These are organised criminals.\n\n“They used somebody else’s grief in the aftermath of that horrendous murder in Southport as an excuse to go about committing serious violent crime.\n\n“Social media companies have got a lot to answer for in helping this disinformation and the organisation of [these protests] to spread and I want to see that stop today.”\n\nAnti-racism protesters have gathered in central Manchester to oppose a planned demonstration in the city this morning.\n\nFar-right activists were expected to assemble in Piccadilly Gardens at 9.30am, according to a list shared widely on social media by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson.\n\nIn response Stand Up to Racism called for a counter-protest in the same area at 9am. “Far right has showed up in unspectacular fashion in Manchester now,” the group tweeted. “They’re outnumbered by 300 antifascists.”\n\nAbout 35 protests are planned by far-right supporters between Friday and Sunday, according to analysis by the campaign group Hope Not Hate.\n\nThe Labour MP for Sunderland Central joined the clean-up operation in the city this morning after last night’s riots.\n\nLewis Atkinson spoke to a crowd of volunteers gathered at the scene of the right-wing protests during which a police station was set on fire and officers were pelted with stones and beer cans.\n\nThe MP told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that he believed some of those involved in the violent protests were linked to a “Nazi off-shoot” of the English Defence League, known as North East Infidels.\n\nHe said: “I am really sad for the city this morning. Sunderland has such a bright future and around the scene of essentially violent thuggery are such green shoots. The fact that some far-right racists decided to turn up in Sunderland does not represent our city. These actions stoke division … but we won’t let them win.”"
