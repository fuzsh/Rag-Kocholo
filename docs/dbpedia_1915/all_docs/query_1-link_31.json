        "text": "I can speak to vinyl, not so much CD, taking that into consideration......I would swing for one of the Original 1955 if you can, stay away from the Red pressing that came out in 1955. usually rule of thumb that the older color pressings were not the best for many reasons you can research. If you cant get an original try for the 1991 Japanese Mono release. i have a few from this same batch of japan pacific reissues on various titles and they all stand up well.\n\nThere is a 1958 Mono reissue on the World Pacific label (Pacific Jazz successor) that would probably be good but I dont think you save anything from the actual 1955 original.\n\nAny reissue past 1991 I would steer clear of. Unfortunately none of the more well known \"Audiophile\" reissuers has gotten their hands on this one yet.\n\nChet Baker & Crew\n\nPacific Jazz PJ-1224\n\nReleased in 1956\n\nRecorded July 24, 25 & 31, 1956 @ Forum Theatre, Los Angeles, CA\n\nPersonel:\n\nBass – Jimmy Bond\n\nDrums – Peter Littman\n\nTenor Saxophone – Phil Urso\n\nTimpani [Chromatic] – Bill Loughbrough* (tracks: A1)\n\nPiano - Bobby Timmons\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 To Mickey's Memory\n\nA2 Slightly Above Moderate\n\nA3. Halema\n\nA4. Revelation\n\nB1 Something For Liza\n\nB2 Lucius Lu\n\nB3. Worrying The Life Out Of Me\n\nB4. Medium Rock\n\nThe Forum Theater stint not only produced half of Chet Baker Sings 1956 release, it also cranked out this latest release in our Album-by-Album. Crew is significant for being a mostly non-vocal album, so if you don't like Chet's singing, this may be up your alley. The only song where his vocals make an appearance is Line for Lyons, which is not on the Vinyl edition, but an extended CD release. There are no real ballads on the recording. Most of what was recorded for the sessions making up this album were upbeat bop. Phil Urso joins the gang on Saxophone and noticeably absent is Russ Freeman.\n\nOne of the top tracks IMO is \"Worrying The Life Out Of Me\". Urso's Sax is in fine form as is Chet's Trumpet, which make a nice combo. On a whole, this album doesn't do much for me. It's probably less the playing than it is the actual selections. Just a group of songs that don't really stand out in any way.\n\nNext post we will discuss Chet playing with the Big Band....another not-so favorite of mine.\n\nChet Baker Quintette (AKA, The Route)\n\nCrown Records CLP-5317\n\nReleased in 1963\n\nRecorded July 24, 25, 26 & 31, 1956 @ Forum Theatre, Los Angeles, CA\n\nSo this is sort of an odd ball, but a necessary addition to the Album-By-Album list. If for no other reason than to illustrate how productive the July 1956 dates at an empty Forum Theater ended up being with respect to recorded and released material. Chet Baker Quintette, featuring almost the same cast of characters as Crew recorded during the same dates, is probably the bottom quality of the tracks recorded during these sessions. That said, it isn't awful at all. The vinyl version, which is named the Chet Baker Quintette and was released years later in 1963 on the Crown Records label, features a handful of titles that make up the outtakes from the original release of Crew. There is also a nice appearance by Art Pepper, who showed up to record on the 26th date only. You can hear his Alto Sax during the song \"The Route\", which is probably a highlight if the vinyl version. Pepper & Baker would gather again in the future for a release that garnered higher praise and greater attention for various reasons that we will cover.\n\nThe original mono vinyl version for this release is fairly cheap and should not cost you a lot.\n\nThe CD version, called Chet Baker & Art Pepper - The Route (Pacific Jazz CDP 7 92931 2) , is actually much better and features Pepper throughout as it covers everything from the 26th date that was performed. It was released in 1989 and there is no vinyl version.\n\nTracklist - Chet Baker Quintette (Vinyl Version)\n\nA1 Extra Mild\n\nA2 Halema\n\nA3 Jumpin' Off A Cliff\n\nB1 The Route\n\nB2 Lucius Lou\n\nB3 Pawnee Junction\n\nTracklist - Chet Baker & Art Pepper - The Route\n\nTynan Time 6:18\n\nThe Route 5:04\n\nSonny Boy 3:55\n\nMinor Yours 7:11\n\nLittle Girl 4:14\n\nOl' Croix 5:27\n\nI Can't Give You Anything But Love 4:07\n\nThe Great Lie 4:16\n\nSweet Lorraine 3:08\n\nIf I Should Love You 4:18\n\nYounger Than Springtime\n\nNext up we hit Chet and the Big Band!\n\nBig Band\n\nPacific Jazz PJ-1229\n\nReleased in 1957\n\nRecorded October 18, 19 & 26, 1956 Los Angeles, CA\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 A Foggy Day\n\nA2 Mythe\n\nA3 Worrying The Life Out Of Me\n\nA4 Chet\n\nA5 Not Too Slow\n\nB1 Phil's Blues\n\nB2 Darn That Dream\n\nB3 Dinah\n\nB4 V-Line\n\nB5 Tenderly\n\nPersonnel\n\nAlto Saxophone – Art Pepper (tracks: A1, B2, B5), Bud Shank (tracks: A1, B2, B5), Fred Waters (tracks: A2-A5, B1, B3, B4), Phil Urso (tracks: A2-A5, B1, B3, B4)\n\nBaritone Saxophone – Bill Hood (tracks: A2-A5, B1, B3, B4)\n\nBass – James Bond*\n\nDrums – James McKean (tracks: A3), Lawrence Marable (tracks: A1, B2, B5), Peter Littman (tracks: A2, A4-A5, B1, B3, B4)\n\nPiano – Bobby Timmons\n\nTenor Saxophone – Bill Perkins (tracks: A1, B2, B5), Bob Graf (tracks: A2-A5, B1, B3, B4), Phil Urso\n\nTrombone – Bob Burgess (tracks: A2-A5, B1, B3, B4), Frank Rosolino (tracks: A1, B2, B5)\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker, Conte Candoli (tracks: A1, B2, B5), Norman Faye (tracks: A1, B2, B5)\n\nWhile not my least favorite of Baker's albums, it definitely leaves a bit to be desired. That said, it trends more to Bop than the West Coast Cool Jazz that Baker is so commonly tied too. Some say it validates the fact that Baker's style was more suited to Bop. Either way, the sessions were meant to utilize a much larger band working through some standard arrangements. I don't prefer the large ensemble...anything more than a quintette turns me off. So if you like the busy, complex layered sound of a big band, it may be your thing! For not being one of the more well known albums in the discography, it has reeled in some high praise...\n\nFrom Lindsey Planar (All-Music):\n\n\"Releasing an entire album under the moniker Chet Baker Big Band is a bit of a misnomer, as only the first four sides actually incorporate an 11-person configuration. The remaining tracks from the long-player feature a slightly smaller nonet configuration. Among the luminaries joining Baker (trumpet) and participating in the big-band arrangements are Art Pepper (alto sax), Bud Shank (alto sax), Phil Urso (tenor sax), and Bobby Timmons (piano). The critical argument proposing that Baker's style is more akin to bop -- and the residual post-bop -- than the West Coast cool that he is often connected with gets tremendous validation throughout not only the four big-band tracks, but also the remainder of the album. The band bops with tremendous verve behind Baker's unmistakable leads. Jimmy Heath's ultrahip arrangements -- especially of \"Tenderly\" and \"A Foggy Day\" -- allow the soloists to improvise fluidly from within the context of the larger unit. The Pierre Michelot composition \"Mythe\" is notable for some outstanding soloing from Baker and Timmons. It is a shame that poor master tape editing -- a motif that haunts many Dick Bock productions -- mars the overall aesthetic. Of the nonet sides, the band really jumps and responds best to the original compositions such as Phil Urso's \"Phil's Blues\" and \"V-Line.\" The horn blend on these recordings is likewise striking.\"\n\nFrom Todd Selbert (the CD insert notes):\n\n“Chet Baker with a big band represents something new for the trumpet player and, at the same time, a full-circle turn. Before turning to jazz in 1950, Baker's musical experience was with large Army bands. But once he became a jazz musician, the milieu in which he placed himself was limited to small groups. So here he is in 1956, back with a big band for the first time in many years.\n\nThe change in environment for Baker is an interesting one, since it places this gifted musician in a different context and permits the listener to hear him in a different way. Not only is it refreshing to hear Baker's trumpet emerge from a big band to take a solo, but it is also rewarding to hear his distinctive trumpet, with its warm, personal tone, play lead.\"\n\nNext up we talk about Playboys w/ Art Pepper...\n\nPlayboys (AKA, Picture of Heath)\n\nPacific Jazz PJ-1234\n\nReleased in 1957\n\nRecorded October 31, 1956 Los Angeles, CA\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 For Minors Only 3:59\n\nA2 Minor-Yours 6:40\n\nA3 Resonant Emotions 5:41\n\nA4 Tynan Tyme 5:31\n\nB1 Picture Of Heath 6:44\n\nB2 For Miles And Miles 6:24\n\nB3 C.T.A.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nAlto Saxophone – Art Pepper\n\nBass – Curtis Counce\n\nComposed By – Art Pepper (tracks: A2, A4), Jimmy Heath (tracks: A1, A3, B1 to B3)\n\nDrums – Lawrence Marable\n\nPiano – Carl Perkins\n\nTenor Saxophone – Phil Urso\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker\n\nThe last of a three album recording stretch with Art Pepper, Playboys stuck with the Bop style that consumed Big Band with a few more up-tempo numbers. Again, I like Chet for the moody brooding ballads, not that the up-tempo is bad by any stretch, just seems to hit for me on the mood music.\n\nFrom Lindsey Planer of All Music:\n\n\"The harmony constant throughout the practically inseparable lines that Baker weaves with Pepper drives the bop throughout the slinky \"For Minors Only.\" The soloists take subtle cues directly from each other, with considerable contributions from Perkins, Counce, and Marable. With the notorious track record both Baker and Pepper had regarding other decidedly less successful duets, it is unfortunate that more recordings do not exist that captured their special bond. These thoroughly enjoyable and often high-energy sides are perfect for bop connoisseurs as well as mainstream jazz listeners.\"\n\nThe bigger story may be the record cover itself. Notice above there are two covers shown. The first cover with the scantly clad lady and what appear to be sock puppets of some sort was the original. Rumor has it that Hugh Hefner did not appreciate the use of his magazine all the way down to the font style being used as an album cover, especially when no permission was given. The 1961 reissue of the album was renamed Picture of Heath, for the many songs written by Jimmy Heath that were performed on the album. The second picture above of the band rehearsing was the \"new\" album cover. A bit boring in comparison at the least.\n\nAn original copy will cost you a pretty penny, but you can acquire a mono reissue done in 2006 by Pure Pleasure Records Chet Baker • Art Pepper • Phil Urso - Picture Of Heath , an audiophile delight if there ever was one. This can be acquired for around $25, which beats the current going rate for an original mono at $300...however, the 2006 Pure Pleasure version uses the reissued cover, so you don't get the girl. Check it out!\n\nNext up we get a much needed reunion album with Russ Freeman!\n\nI think I need to revisit this material. I remember not being all that impressed with it many years ago, probably due to the same reason you state (I like my Chet slow, haunting and heartbroken). Art Pepper is one of my favorite saxophone players (but as with Chet I prefer Art’s later years) so it used to bum me out a little I didn’t quite like these recordings they did together when they both were so young... and relatively innocent.\n\nQuartet: Russ Freeman Chet Baker\n\nWorld Pacific PJ-1232\n\nReleased in 1957\n\nRecorded November 6, 1956 Los Angeles, CA\n\nTracklist:\n\nLove Nest 4:14\n\nFan Tan 5:37\n\nSummer Sketch 4:34\n\nAn Afternoon At Home 5:08\n\nSay When 5:00\n\nLush Life 5:43\n\nAmblin 7:12\n\nHugo Hurwhey 4:23\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBass – Leroy Vinnegar\n\nDrums – Shelly Manne\n\nPiano – Russ Freeman\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker\n\nWhat some believe is the best material Freeman and Baker ever did, was also the last time they would record together. The track Summer Sketch might be one of my favorites in the whole Baker catalog. Interestingly, he doesn't appear in the Freeman penned song until 2 minutes in, but it represents, in my opinion, the ability Chet had with playing the ballad. Haunting and beautiful all at once. Love Nest and Say When are some great up-beat numbers that trend to the West Coast Cool style more-so than the bop or hard bop. Freeman and Baker playoff of each other in such sync that it isn't hard to see why they succeeded in their time together. Fan Tan is an odd ball that struggles to fit on this album, yet is still quite good, while Lush Life & Amblin' make for a slower, yet beautiful change of pace.\n\nI feel this is a must own/listen for any Baker fan and a great spot to jump in and listen if you are just getting started with his material.\n\n\"I've never heard anyone get quite the sound on trumpet that Chet gets. I don't think he's ever been captured on record the way I've heard him play — that's not surprising; it's true of most players, because it's not a natural thing to go into a recording studio and try to play jazz. It's not impossible but it's not as comfortable. \"\n\n- Russ Freeman (taken from an interview done with Will Thornbury, June 1987 Jazz Profiles: Russ Freeman - Part 2 )\n\nNext we will welcome Bud Shank into the fray.....\n\nTheme Music from \"The James Dean Story\"\n\nWorld Pacific Records P-2005\n\nReleased in 1957\n\nRecorded November 8, 1956 Los Angeles, CA\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 Jimmy's Theme\n\nA2 The Search\n\nA3 Lost Love\n\nA4 People\n\nA5 The Movie Star\n\nB1 Fairmont, Indiana\n\nB2 Rebel At Work\n\nB3 Success And Then What?\n\nB4 Let Me Be Loved\n\nB5 Hollywood\n\nPersonnel:\n\nAlto Saxophone – Charlie Mariano (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5), Herbie Steward*\n\nAlto Saxophone, Flute – Bud Shank (tracks: A1 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nBaritone Saxophone – Pepper Adams (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nBass – Monte Budwig*\n\nBongos – Mike Pacheco (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nComposed By – Leith Stevens (tracks: A1 to B3, B5)\n\nDrums – Mel Lewis\n\nFlute – Don Fagerquist (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nOrchestrated By, Arranged By, Conductor – Bill Holman (tracks: A3 to B2, B4, B5), Johnny Mandel (tracks: A1, A2, B3)\n\nPiano – Claude Williamson\n\nTenor Saxophone – Bill Holman (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B5), Richie Kamuca (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nTrombone – Milt Bernhart (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker, Ray Linn (tracks: A1, A2, A4 to B1, B3 to B5)\n\nShrill, 1950's movie theme music that really doesn't set itself apart from other similar works. This would rank as a disappointment for most. The biggest reason being the fact that they assembled an all-star cast of musicians, which would become a theme in many of the following Baker releases coming in the next 2-3 years. It's bland and nothing much to write home about.\n\nThere is a vocal version of \"Let Me Be Loved\" sung by Chet that was released as a single, never added to the actual original full length record, but has been added to subsequent reissues. It could have gone a ways to helping provide some needed variety on this one. As you can tell, not a favorite of mine, as someone who likes the scaled back trio's and quartets vs. the ensemble put together for works like this. If I had to pick out a track, I would give \"The Search\" a listen, probably my favorite of the bunch.\n\nYou will notice Chet is sharing the spotlight with Bud Shank on this one. Chet and Bud work again in the future under slightly different circumstances with mixed results (mostly not great).\n\nUnfortunately, things from here on out get pretty up and down for Chet. There is some junk and some treasure ahead, but it is strictly hit and miss. His drug use began to escalate right around this time and create even greater volatility, both from a business stance and a personal stance.\n\nGerry Mulligan Quartet - Reunion with Chet Baker\n\nWorld Pacific Records PJ-1241\n\nReleased in 1958\n\nRecorded December 3, 11 & 17, 1957 New York City, NY\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1 Reunion\n\nA2 When Your Lover Has Gone\n\nA3 Stardust\n\nA4 My Heart Belongs To Daddy\n\nB1 Jersey Bounce\n\nB2 Surrey With The Fringe On Top\n\nB3 Travelin' Light\n\nB4 Ornithology\n\nPersonel:\n\nBaritone Saxophone – Gerry Mulligan\n\nBass – Henry Grimes\n\nDrums – Dave Bailey\n\nTrumpet – Chet Baker\n\n1957 was in some ways the beginning of a very long and dark journey for Baker and his music. This was the year that Chet claims was the start of his heroin addiction, although most of the guys he played with, say he had been on it since the early 50's. He spent a majority of the year on tour with the Birdland All-Stars. 1957 also welcomed the birth of his first child, Chesney Aftab Baker, with his second wife Halema. To cap things off he decided to relocate the whole family to New York City. With all of this going on, recording was not really in the cards until the end of the year.\n\nIn December, Chet and his old buddy Gerry Mulligan would get together for a reunion. The Gerry Mulligan Quartet would record \"Reunion with Chet Baker\" in early December of 1957. It was the first time recording since their break up and it would be the last time Chet and Gerry recorded anything together until a live reunion in the 70's.\n\nThis was my first or second album I ever heard that contained any Chet Baker material. It was recommended as a good place to start with Chet's music. The album is West Coast Jazz in great form and the interplay between Baker and Mulligan is alive and well. The piano-less quartet was back...at least for one more date. It may not be the same spark they had in the early 50's when they put West Coast Jazz on the map, but it is still very good and worth the money if you like this time period of Chet's career.\n\nShockingly, this wouldn't be all for 1957 as he would go on to put in work on 3 other releases in about a two week time span.\n\nNext, We will cover some Chet Baker CD only releases that were dug up 40 years after their recording....."
