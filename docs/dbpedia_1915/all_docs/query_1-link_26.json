        "text": "Bison specialists from across the United States and Canada gathered in Brookings recently for the second International Bison Health Symposium, attended by nearly 140 producers, veterinarians, tribal leaders, government officials, researchers and zoo managers.\n\nThe three-day symposium was co-sponsored by the South Dakota State University Department of Animal Science and Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Scie\n\nnces along with the National Bison Association, based in Denver, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAttendees heard different presentations focusing on bison health and research, with topics ranging from genomic research, genetic diversity, gut bacteria, micronutrients, using infrared thermal imaging, parasites and traceability to an in-depth focus on diseases such as malignant catarrhal fever and Mycoplasma bovis. Graduate students and researchers from American and Canadian universities also presented 15 poster exhibits highlighting their research.\n\nPhilip Urso, SDSU assistant professor of bison studies, was key in helping to organize the event, and he noted the helpful support of the Center of Excellence for Bison Studies. “The Center of Excellence is a partnership between SDSU, the National Bison Association and the National Buffalo Foundation,” Urso said. “Housed at SDSU, the center focuses on advancing the industry through support of our nation’s national mammal and is the only one of its kind in the United States.”\n\nIn addition to support from university resources, Urso said that organizations in the community also contributed greatly to the decision to bring this exclusive event to Brookings. “Visit Brookings and the Chamber of Commerce provided materials for the conference and offered wonderful recommendations to guests for meals and other activities in the community when the symposium was not in session,” Urso said. “They really helped us make our guests feel welcomed to campus and the community.”\n\nNational Bison Association officials appreciated the symposium, the first of its kind in 10 years, and intend to schedule another. “We are really energized from the second International Bison Health Symposium,” said Jim Matheson, executive director of the National Bison Association. “This event was long overdue, and we sure intend to make it a more regular occurrence given all of the incredible bison research and project facilitation taking place across the continent.”\n\nThe National Bison Association’s Karen Conley, Bison World editor, added, “Gathering these bison health professionals together leads to sharing resources and networking, exchanging ideas and best practices with the ultimate goal of keeping bison healthy and thriving.”"
