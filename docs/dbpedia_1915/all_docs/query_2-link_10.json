If you happen to be going to London in 2015, check out the exhibition in person at the Royal Geographical Society from July 24-September 5, 2015.\n\nThe Overall Photographer of the Year\n\nThe overall winner, Philip Lee Harvey, wowed the judges with two distinct sets portfolios from Ethiopia and Namibia.\n\nBecause of Nat Hab’s fondness for Namibia, we were particularly captivated by his photos of a striking Namibian Himba woman. What the judges said: “The portraits of the Himba woman are beautiful in their detail and limited colour palette, capturing the tribal shapes and patterns in strong compositions.”\n\nClick the image to see an enlarged version.\n\n<&nbsp>\n\nYoung Photographers Impress\n\nThe contest has two youth categories, but these winners easily could have held their own in any of the other adult categories. We have a feeling these adolescents have long, fruitful careers as professional photographers in their futures!\n\nOur favorite was this set of photos capturing the beauty of Myanmar and its people, by George Warr of the UK, age 16.\n\nOur Other Favorites – Scuba, Sunsets, Grizzlies and More\n\nCheck out some of our favorites from the many different categories."
