        "text": "Robert Lobe is a painter and photographer whose exhibitions include the University of Rhode Island and Queens Museum biennial. After receiving his master’s degree in art history from Brown University, Lobe studied at the New York Studio School and elsewhere with Graham Nickson, John Lees, Peter Bonner and Josette Urso.\n\n“My paintings are imaginative surfaces that explore personal territory. They derive more from an inner place of emotion, intuition and memory than from direct observation. Paintings might suggest situations, nature, figures, even fantastical creatures. Such aspects are not created intentionally, but are allowed to emerge as each work develops.”\n\nwww.robertlobeart.com"
