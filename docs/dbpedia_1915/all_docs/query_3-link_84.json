We believe in simplicity and challenge. We teach connection. Complexity forces the student into their heads. A wall of words of instruction forces the student to filter out the teacher, disconnect actively. We believe the class should be student-centric versus teacher centric. What to say comes from what the teacher sees, so it is relevant. /episode/index/show/philipurso/id/5071290\n\ninfo_outline Mandy Roush Live Love Teach VInyasa Class\n\nMandy Roush Live Love Teach VInyasa Class NOTE: Class starts at about 6 minutes into the recording. Skip ahead, or if you are interested in Eating Disorders and Yoga, LLT graduate Chelsea Roff describes her work as Founder and Director of , a non-profit organization that prevents and helps individuals fully recover from eating disorders through yoga. /episode/index/show/philipurso/id/2809058\n\ninfo_outline Dayton Rocks! Philip at Practice Yoga\n\nDayton Rocks! Philip at Practice Yoga I discovered that Dayton is a haven for hipsters! I was at Practice Yoga - a cool studio there owned by a Live love Teach teacher – Kathi Kizirnis- and Kim Carter. I taught a weekend for a teacher training they were doing…and also taught some public classes- this is one of them. /episode/index/show/philipurso/id/1823252\n\ninfo_outline Mexico 2011 Teacher Training Class- all the teachers\n\nMexico 2011 Teacher Training Class- all the teachers This is a class from our recent 5-day LLT teacher training in Mexico. The teachers all took a part and taught it on the last day. One remarkable part is that there is are number of teachers who never taught before this training and they are just mixed in …as always we assume you already know basic alignment- this class is one hour and 20 minutes. /episode/index/show/philipurso/id/1822632\n\ninfo_outline Montana Teacher Training Class- all the teachers\n\nMontana Teacher Training Class- all the teachers I thought you might enjoy this very unusual class. It is a teacher training drill from Live Love Teach’s recent 5- day training in Montana. It is a complete 75-minute class, yes, but it is taught by all the teachers in training – 3 minutes each! In this drill, you will hear the teachers playing –playing is the right word- with breath and flow, tension and release, and expanding their range of expression. (Most of the time we are broken into small groups- occasionally we join into one big class) There are all levels of teachers here- brand new teachers and experienced ones , and – many styles- teachers of vinyasa, ana forest, astanga, and others.

This is a Sunday 8AM class that builds consistently. What do you value? Being right or happy. winniing the arguement or Love? What is the overriding priority in your life? /episode/index/show/philipurso/id/732162"
