        "text": "“For me photography is a way to understand and accept the world. It’s an ‘excuse’ to travel and meet the most incredible people. Light is fundamental. Everything is transformed by light. I see in black and white. By eliminating color I can focus on shadow and texture… I take things away in order to put it elsewhere, to get closer to the substance. The portrait is both my favorite style of photography and the most difficult. It’s always a very emotional affair, because everyone is imbued with his or her own mystery, something sacred and impossible to grasp. Through my portraits, I try to come close to that .”\n\nAlessandra d’Urso\n\nAlessandra d’Urso was born in Milan. She studied photography at the International Center of Photography and film at the New York Film Academy. Upon her graduation she moved to Paris and spent the following years producing stories on social issues for different magazines, projects and exhibitions. Most recently, Alessandra explored the headquarters of major painters like Alex Katz, Kiki Smith, Philip Taaffe, David Salle and Donald Baechler, and perennial hipster figures such as Tom Sachs and Terence Koh (to name a few). Her portraits of art world heavyweights premiered on Nowness last July. She shot Each Other‘s A/W 12 collection and got invited to participate in their creative community. She also exhibited her work “l’impertinence de l’impermence” in Arles in association with La Revue More. Her work has appeared in Vanity Fair, Marie-Claire, La Revue More, D della Repubblica, Next, Liberation, Modzik among many others. Alessandra is based in Paris."
