        "text": "The post-production of a photo can be an adventure. Realizing this single cover, we found ourselves working in the company of an outstanding assortment of creative minds. Maybe they are worth mentioning: Phil Knott, who has portrayed folks like 50 Cent, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and Amy Winehouse; stylist Brett Alan Nelson, who – simply – collaborates with Nicki Minaj, David La Chapelle and Schön! Magazine; hair stylist Larry Dean McDaniel, always in league with David La Chapelle, trusted ally of Pamela Anderson, Mariah Carey and Katy Perry; Make Up Artist Lola Arellano, Co-founder and CEO of the independent cosmetic company Melt Cosmetics. Ivana’s magnificent head piece deserves special attention, since it was created by the designer and performer Malakai: his wearable arts are worn by Beyoncé, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Emily Ratajkowski, Winnie Harlow and Katy Perry. Just saying.\n\nIvana Lola is an Italian American singer songwriter, musician and dancer born in Torre del Greco (Naples) Italy. Her career as singer begins at the early age of 8. ‘DON’T YOU HIDE L.I.B’ is the single with which Ivana Lola breaks in to the music industry. This song is a featuring with AC (the music producer Alessandro Calemme) and Get Far Mario Fargetta. Israeli DJ Offer Nissim remixed the song, chosing ‘DON’T YOU HIDE L.I.B’ as one of the favorite piece of his dj sets."
