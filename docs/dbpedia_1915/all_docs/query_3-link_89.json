        "text": "By Bob Skubal\n\nRetired coach, historian, author of ‘History of Tomahawk Sports’\n\nTOMAHAWK – The first mention of Tomahawk boys’ basketball that this author can find was during the 1900-01 season.\n\nIt is believed that Tomahawk played their very first basketball game on Dec. 2, 1900. While the name of their coach was not discovered, team members of this first team were identified as Roy Conant, Casper Nelson, Glenn Foss, Will Miller, Joe Wangard, Albert Olson and William Fuller.\n\nThe Tomahawk Leader mentioned that the team had a 3-1 record, with a win over Rhinelander 22-12 and two other wins over Wausau, but the final scores could not be found in any articles. The lone loss for THS was against the City Team by a score of 40-13.\n\nLet’s take a look back at some of the moments that stand out in Tomahawk basketball history, starting with the first decade. Basketball is what this author calls a “Big Ticket” sport, so this look at the basketball program will be lengthy.\n\nCounting this first season, there have been 31 different varsity coaches for Tomahawk basketball. Bill Fischer has the most varsity wins with 124, while Tim Albert has the longest tenure with 15 seasons. Superintendent L.W. Brooks has the highest winning percentage at 1.000 with a 5-0 record in his one season as varsity coach.\n\nThus far ,Tomahawk basketball has won eight conference titles – 1927-28, 1962-63, 1963-64 (CO), 1966-67 (CO), 1968-69, 1969-70, 1975-76 and 1979-8; four district titles – 1924-25, 1936-37, 1968-69 and 1969-70; five regional titles –1979-80, 1980-81, 1997-98, 2000-01 and 2013-14; and made two state appearances – 1924-25 and 1936-37.\n\n1901-02\n\nGames were played at Maccabee Hall. Maccabee Hall, or the Opera House, was located at the corner of N. 4th St. and W. Wisconsin Ave. It was the center for entertainment and meetings in Tomahawk.\n\nManager for the team was Bernhardt, who also served as substitute for the team. Team members were Norm Olson, Charles Bebeau, Will Fuller, (?) Bernhardt, Tom Nash, Guy Fuller, Fred Thoms, Jack Weber, Glenn Foss and Al Fluegal.\n\nThe team went 0-2 that season, with losses to the City Team 40-39 and Wausau 48-27.\n\n1905-06\n\nCoach was Superintendent Oliver E. Rice. The Tomahawk Leader mentions the team preparing for the season before Thanksgiving. There was nothing else in the Leader until the superintendent made a statement about behavior and rules for athletes to follow, such as eliminating foul play and sportsmanship.\n\nTeam members were Edgar Welfley, Herman Foster, Arthur Oelhafen, Elmer Foster, Patsy Stone, Percy Lord, Floyd Slater, James Kopplin, Parker Smith and Earl Wakefield. Edgar Welfley was selected as team captain. No scores were discovered for this season.\n\n1907-08\n\nProfessor Beckwith was varsity coach. Games were played at the Opera House and the season record was once again 1-3.\n\nThe lone win came over the City Team, 67-23, while losses were to Merrill 30-17, Wausau 54-34 and Rhinelander 33-14.\n\nTeam members were Elmer Frye, Ed Schultz, Ray Atcherson, Albert Nelson, Claude Venne, Frederic Oelhafen, William Ball, O.K. Welty, Garrie “Moose” Eldridge and Patrick Twomey. O.K. Welty was selected as captain.\n\nSchool colors were changed to Yale blue and gold.\n\n1908-09\n\nCoaches Superintendent L. W. Brooks and H. G. Fuller produced the only unbeaten season for Tomahawk at 5-0. Victories were 41-27 over Arbor Vitae, 31-11 over Minocqua, 38-18 over Merrill, 52-18 over Minocqua and 39-13 over Rhinelander.\n\nTeam members were Herbert Miller, Garrie Eldridge O.K. Welty, Ray Atcherson, Patrick Twomey, Albert Nelson and William Ball. Herbert Miller was the team manager and Will Ball was the captain.\n\nTomahawk was denied a trip to state because they did not enter the schedule early enough and did not play enough important games. The state tourney was only five years old and by invitation only.\n\n1910-11\n\nIt was noted that no time outs were allowed to be called during games.\n\n1911-12\n\nOne game worth noting was an 89-9 victory over Prentice, with Stanley May scoring 33, Frank Hebert 24 and Irvin Mitchell 20. Imagine if you were a Tomahawk basketball fan and watching this game. People were talking about this performance for years.\n\n1913-14\n\nThe team traveled by train to away games.\n\nPoor sportsmanship was shown this season when Tomahawk was playing Minocqua. The score was tied 10-10 when Tomahawk coach Clement V. Liner became displeased with the referee and Tomahawk walked off the court and forfeited the game.\n\n1915-16\n\nThis was the first time in school history that Tomahawk sent a team to the playoffs.\n\n1918-19\n\nDr. D.C. Jones presented the team with $10.00 after they defeated Wausau 19-17.\n\n1919-20\n\nCoach was William Lampert. Team members were Ted Doucette, Sidney Engleman, Earl Cronkrite, James Clark, Jule Loftus, Ted Loftus, Ambrose Gahan, Frank Gillette and Roy Bloomquist. Doucette was selected as team captain.\n\nDoucette scored 145 points during the season to lead the team, while Engleman scored 114 and Gahan 104. The team was 11-1 going into the playoffs before Loftus had to withdraw from the team because he had reached the age of 20.\n\nDoucette and Engleman were selected to the Sectional All-Tournament Team.\n\n1924-25\n\nRobert Webster was the coach. Team members were John Smith, Ambrose Smith, Ted Chvala, Carl Ecklund, Eugene Brady, Frederick Cull, Sylvester Polege, John Robarge, George Larson, Paul Bebeau, Maurice Nickel, Richard Nielsen, Albert Marcouiller and Lawrence Foster.\n\nTomahawk was 13-4 and earned their first trip to the state tournament. In a win against Medford, Tomahawk was leading late in the game, and the wrong man from Medford called a timeout – only the captain could call an official timeout –and Tomahawk sank a free throw as a result of the technical foul called on Medford. Losses prior to the playoffs were to Wausau 22-21 and Marshfield 14-8 (the bus broke down and they arrived at 9 p.m. because they had to take a sleigh the last seven miles).\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Tomahawk defeated Eagle River 15-10 (coach Webster made the team members carry their own water and had the boys sleep for 16 hours before sectionals). Next came a 19-12 victory over Medford before THS punched their ticket to state by defeating Antigo 17-6.\n\nAt state, Tomahawk lost 24-8 to La Crosse (La Crosse went on to become state champions) and 20-18 to Manitowoc. John “Cappy” Smith was All-Conference that season.\n\n1926-27\n\nTomahawk only had two home games, as most teams refused to play at Tomahawk’s “cheese box.” Only Rhinelander and Antigo played in Tomahawk.\n\n1928-29\n\nTomahawk lost 17-0 for the first shutout in the history of the Valley Conference.\n\n1930-31\n\nLloyd Bohm was the coach. Tomahawk came one game away from qualifying for state when they lost to Antigo 29-10. THS was 10-7 that season.\n\n1932-33\n\nA notable game was against Rib Lake. Coach Ambrose Gahan sent all but the starting center to the showers because of their poor showing, and the reserves won the game 16-12.\n\nIn the March 16, 1933 issue of the Tomahawk Leader, an article said that in the last five years, Tomahawk basketball was 6-38 and 35-50 the last 10 years in the Valley.\n\n1933-34\n\nCoach was K.M. Cherry. Even though Tomahawk was 9-8 and 8th in the Valley with a 2-6 record, they came one game away from qualifying for state when they lost to White Lake 18-17.\n\n1935-36\n\nCoach was K.M. Cherry. THS was 9-9. Tomahawk lost a playoff game against Washburn 30-20 (Washburn was a state entry from the previous year) when Jim Draeger’s absence hurt the team, as he was home because his brother had scarlet fever.\n\n1936-37\n\nK.M. Cherry was coach. Major letter winners were Bill Fehrman, Clarence Robarge, Clayton Radtke, Howard Rose, Lloyd Koth and Harold Sparks. Other team members were George Fryar, Dave Cowling, Arndt Torkelson, Fred Doucette, Bill Nick, Don Burton, Lawrence Rush, Bill Townsend, Norm Bauer, John Nelson, John Tierney, Jerome Helgeson (manager), Andy Oelhafen, Howie Hetzel, Lee Myre, Bob Koth, Ed St. Peter, Gail Sparks, Joe Chvala, Harold Eittreim, Butch Wee, James Nelson, Ed Ziegler, Luther Polege and Warren Wiley.\n\nTHS was 13-9 and tied for 5th in the Valley with a 6-6 record and made their second trip to the state tournament.\n\nThe playoffs saw THS defeat Nekoosa 28-15, Merrill 27-18, Adams -Friendship 25-12 and Kewaunee 33-26. At state, Tomahawk lost to Ashland 43-22 and Stoughton 37-25.\n\nAll-Conference honors went to Howard Rose, honorable mention; and Clayton Radtke, honorable mention.\n\n1937-38\n\nK.M. Cherry’s team came one game away from qualifying for state when they lost to Merrill 29-16. THS was 8-11 overall. Lloyd Koth was All-Conference.\n\n1938-39\n\nOne game worth mentioning was when THS defeated Medford 38-22 in the playoffs. Medford came in as the undefeated champions of the 3C Conference. THS was 6-13 overall. Jim Nelson was All-Conference.\n\n1940-41\n\nK.M. Cherry was assisted by V.K. Derscheid. THS was second in the Valley with a 9-3 record and 15-4 overall.\n\nDean was second team All-Conference and led the Valley in scoring with 127 points.\n\n1942-43\n\nFor the playoffs, the winning teams were required to play two games in one day to produce a maximum in mileage savings and a minimum of time used. Winning teams were also issued certificates enabling them to receive medals after the war.\n\n1952-53\n\nThe WIAA changed the free throw rule:\n\nMake the one attempt and the ball returns to play.\n\nMiss the shot and the player gets another attempt.\n\nCan no longer refuse to shoot the free throw.\n\nGet two free throws for intentional foul.\n\nTwo free throws for not making reasonable effort to avoid contact.\n\nTwo free throws for the player who was in unfavorable position with little chance to reach for the ball and he is fouled.\n\nTHS was 15-6 overall. Tom Higgins set a Wisconsin Valley scoring record with 46 points in a 90-44 victory over Merrill. Higgins broke the record held by Johnny Kotz of Rhinelander.\n\nHiggins also set the season scoring record with 326 points, breaking Kotz’s record of 316. Kotz is still the only individual to own four Valley scoring titles. Higgins was All-Conference, while Jim Scott and Jim Obey were All-Conference honorable mention.\n\n1955-56\n\nTomahawk was no longer in the Valley for basketball. THS spent 35 years in the Valley for one or more sports. This was the first season in the Lumberjack Conference with D.C. Everest (DCE was only a 9-10 school), Medford, Park Falls, Phillips and Mosinee.\n\nJim Leverance set a school record by scoring 48 points in an 85-50 win over Eagle River.\n\n1959-60\n\nBill Fischer was head coach, assisted by Jerry Sullivan and Cecil Kavejecz.\n\nTHS defeated Medford 94-79 for the most points scored by Tomahawk in a single game. Darrel Zeitelhack scored 41 points in a THS 79-75 win over Antigo. Mac Winker averaged 22.5 points per game. Winker was voted first team All-Conference, while Dar Clements was second team All-Conference.\n\n1961-62\n\nJim VanderVoort was a Channel 7 All-Star honorable mention selection.\n\n1962-63\n\nBill Fischer was head coach assisted by Dick Strasser and Bob Meyer.\n\nTeam members were Ken Urso, Don Gruhlke, Dennis Hinterleitner, Paul Wallis, Jim Huhn, Pete Trantow, Tom Gabriel, Lance Bell, John Stelling, Jack Smith, Bruce Grube, Gary Hoffman and Bill Sparr.\n\nTomahawk was conference champions for the first time since the 1927-28 season with a 14-6 overall record and 9-1 in conference.\n\nAll-Conference were Jim Huhn-1st Team, Tom Gabriel-1st Team, Ken Urso-2nd Team and Don Gruhlke-honorable mention.\n\n1963-64\n\nTHS was coached by Bill Fischer, Dick Strasser and Bob Meyer.\n\nTeam members were Dennis Hinterleitner, Peter Trantow, Gary Hoffman, Bruce Grube, John Jones, Mike Timm, Grant Graeber (manager), John Stelling, Bill Sparr, Jim Woodward, Art Zschau, Richard Johnson, Tim Theiler and Mark Alberg.\n\nTomahawk was co-conference with a 7-3 record and was 9-9 overall.\n\nAll-Conference went to Dennis Hinterleitner-1st Team, Bruce Grube-honorable mention, Gary Hoffman-honorable mention and Peter Trantow-honorable mention.\n\n1966-67\n\nBill Fischer was varsity coach, assisted by Carl Wallace and Russell Schauf.\n\nTeam members were Dick Huseby, Craig Kuntz, Gary Gould, Dale Schreiber, Dick Salewske, Steve Gaedtke, Steve Johnson, Jim McCarthy, Mike Johnson, Greg Denman, Dennis Theiler, Mickey Briggs, Al Whitaker, Tom Schoone and Joe Draeger.\n\nTHS was 10-7 overall and 8-2 and was co-conference champions with Lakeland and Medford.\n\nAll-Conference honors went to Dick Huseby-1st Team, Craig Kuntz-2nd Team and Steve Johnson-2nd Team.
