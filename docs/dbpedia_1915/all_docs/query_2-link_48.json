        "text": "This heart-warming image of a gentle moment between a gorilla and a rescuers who saved her from being slaughtered is the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People's Choice Award beating nearly 50,000 images to win the much respected prize.\n\nCanadian photographer Jo-Anne McArthur's shot, called 'Pikin and Appolinaire' emerged as the favourite.\n\nJo-Anne's image was chosen from a shortlist of 24, selected by the Natural History Museum from almost 50,000 entries submitted for the 2017 competition.\n\nIt shows Pikin, a lowland gorilla, in the arms of Appolinaire Ndohoudou, who had just rescued her from being sold for bushmeat.\n\nAppolinaire works for Ape Action Africa. He was moving Pikin from her former enclosure within a safe forest sanctuary in Cameroon to a new and larger one, along with a group of gorilla companions. She was first sedated, but during the transfer to the new enclosure she awoke.\n\nAs she was in the arms of her caretaker, she remained calm for the bumpy ride.\n\nJo-Anne said: 'I'm so thankful that this image resonated with people and I hope it might inspire us all to care a little bit more about animals.\n\n'No act of compassion towards them is ever too small. I regularly document the cruelties animals endure at our hands, but sometimes I bear witness to stories of rescue, hope and redemption. Such is the case with the story of Pikin and Appolinaire, a beautiful moment between friends.'\n\nLike Pikin, Appolinaire Ndohoudouwas forced from his home,having fled Chad because of a civil war.\n\nAs he rebuilthis lifein Cameroon, his work in protecting wild animals revived his appreciation for the natural world.\n\nHe has built loving relationships with the gorillas he helps to rear-some of these animals have known him almost all their lives\n\nThe picture will be showcased in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London until it closes on 28 May.\n\nWildlife Photographer of the Year is the Natural History Museum's annual showcase of the world's best nature photography and wildlife photojournalism on one global platform.\n\nSeen by millions of people all over the world, the images shine a spotlight on nature photography as an art form, whilst challenging us to address the big questions facing our planet.\n\nThe Natural History Museum has also released the four finalists and 24 shortlisted images.\n\nOne of the four finalist was taken by Ray Chin, from Taiwan.\n\nIt shows two humpback whales around the island of Vava'u, Tonga.\n\nThe mother and calf were migrating south from their Antarctic feeding grounds to give birth in warm water off Tonga, in the South Pacific, a journey humpback whales take every year from July to late October.\n\nRay encountered this pair while peacefully floating in the plankton-filled water.\n\nAfter Ray gently approached them, the giants swam a bit closer to have a look at him. While they made this elegant turn, Ray took the shot. He later converted the image into black and white which he felt represented the simplicity of the scene.\n\nThe second of the four final photos, was taken by Luciano Candisani, from Brazil.\n\nLuciano had to climb the cecropia tree, in the protected Atlantic rainforest of southern Bahia, Brazil, to take an eye-level shot of this three-toed sloth.\n\nAs sloths like to feed on the leaves of these trees,and they are often seen high up in the canopy.\n\nAnother of the finalist photos 'Warm embrace' was taken by Debra Garside from Canada.\n\nIt depicts a polar bear mother hugging her cubs as they emerge from their dens in the early spring.\n\nThe cubs stay close to their mothers for warmth and protection. Once the cubs are strong and confident enough,they make the trek to the sea ice with their mother so that she can resume hunting for seals.\n\nPhotographer Debra waited six days near the den of this family, in Wapusk National Park, Manitoba, Canada,before they finally emerged.\n\nIn the most challenging conditions she has ever faced, temperatures ranged from -35 ÌC (-31 ÌF) to -55 ÌC (-67 ÌF) with high winds, making it almost impossible to avoid frostbite and keep her camera gear functioning properly.\n\nThe last of the finalists was taken by Lakshitha Karunarathna from Sri Lanka.\n\nIt was taken when Lakshitha was on safari in Maasa Mara National Reserve, Kenya.\n\nHe spotted an unusual sight âa lilac-breasted roller riding a zebra.\n\nNormally they prefer to perch high up in the foliage, but this roller spent an hour or more riding around and enjoying the occasional insect meal.\n\nLakshitha waited for the surrounding zebras to form the perfect background before taking this tight crop.\n\nOther photographs that made the shortlist include giraffes, zebras, owls, and sealife taken all over the world.\n\nOne called 'Kick back and chill' was taken in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda by American Alan Chung.\n\nIt shows part of a 'Hirwa' family group of 16 mountain gorillas led by a silverback feeding their young on bamboo shoots.\n\nThe below, was taken by Uri Goldman from Denmark.\n\nHe had spent a week taking black and white photographs in Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya, mostly taking pictures of big cats.\n\nAfter six days he came across six giraffes walking in formation.
