He was a pioneer of the West Coast jazz scene, and developed a style that combined the cool, lyrical elements of the West Coast with the hard-bop style of the East Coast.\n\nBaker's most well-known albums include Chet Baker Sings (1954), Chet Baker Plays The Best of Lerner and Loewe (1959), and She Was Too Good To Me (1974). His most popular songs include \"My Funny Valentine\", \"Let's Get Lost\", \"I Fall in Love Too Easily\", \"Look For The Silver Lining\" and \"There Will Never Be Another You\".\n\nAn interesting fact about Chet Baker is that he was known to be a talented improviser, often creating his own solos on the spot. He was also a prolific composer, having written over 50 original songs throughout his career."
