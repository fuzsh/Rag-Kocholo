        "text": "Having teamed up on two prior Pacific Jazz recordings, trumpeter Chet Baker & alto saxophonist Art Pepper continued their fruitful collaboration with the supremely swinging 1956 album Picture of Heath (which was originally released as Playboys until Hugh Hefner objected). The sextet for the session was brimming with top talent from the West Coast Jazz scene including tenor saxophonist Phil Urso, pianist Carl Perkins, bassist Curtis Counce, and drummer Larance Marable. A notable feature of the date was its focus on the compositions of saxophonist Jimmy Heath who penned five of the album’s tracks: “Picture of Heath,” “For Miles and Miles,” “C.T.A.,” “For Minors Only,” and “Resonant Emotions.” The set is rounded out by two of Pepper’s tunes—“Minor-Yours” and “Tynan Tyme”—and the playing throughout is unfailingly vibrant with exquisite solos and lively band interplay all of which which makes this a quintessential cool jazz date.\n\nBlue Note Tone Poet Series\n\nThe Tone Poet Audiophile Vinyl Reissue Series was born out of Blue Note President Don Was’ admiration for the exceptional audiophile Blue Note LP reissues presented by Music Matters. Was brought Joe Harley, a.k.a. the “Tone Poet,” on board to curate and supervise a series of reissues from the Blue Note family of labels.\n\nExtreme attention to detail has been paid to getting these right in every conceivable way, from the jacket graphics and printing quality to superior LP mastering (direct from the master tapes) by Kevin Gray to superb 180g audiophile LP pressings by Record Technology Inc. Every aspect of these Tone Poet releases is done to the highest possible standard. It means that you will never find a superior version. This is IT.\n\nThis mono Tone Poet Vinyl Edition was produced by Joe Harley, mastered by Kevin Gray (Cohearent Audio) from the original analog master tapes, pressed on 180g vinyl at Record Technology Inc. (RTI), and packaged in a deluxe tip-on jacket.\n\nTracklist:\n\nA1: For Minors Only\n\nA2: Minor-Yours\n\nA3: Resonant Emotions\n\nA4: Tynan Tyme\n\nB1: Picture Of Heath\n\nB2: For Miles And Miles\n\nB3: C.T.A."
