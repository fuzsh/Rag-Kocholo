Since we first started Unsplash, thousands of photographers from all over the world have become a part of its community, submitting their work and sharing it without asking for any compensation or even recognition.\n\nWe say it a lot around here, but Unsplash really would be nothing without its community.\n\nThis book is a celebration of that community—a way to say thank you to the artists and creatives who have helped build Unsplash into what it is today.\n\nEvery single aspect of The Unsplash Book was chosen by its community—from the photos to the paper style to the cover design. With the help of nearly 8,000 people, we created the world’s first fully open, crowdsourced book featuring contributions from 100 creatives including Dann Petty, James Allworth, Lawrence Lessig, Kirby Ferguson, and more.\n\nOver the past year, we’ve documented the process of creating The Unsplash Book, from the original idea and designs with the studio Deux Huit Huit to our final changes before sending it to Montreal printer Marquis."
