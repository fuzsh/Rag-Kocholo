        "text": "My first years as a professional musician (1967-1971) were full of unique experiences) When I came back to Florida (1971) after gigs in Mississippi and Arkansas, I began looking for drumming work.\n\nI’d heard about a group in Daytona, looking for a drummer. I drove from Geneva to Daytona, to attend their Sunday Jam Session.\n\nAt the session was Peter Littmann. That was the first time I heard him play. There was a good crowd for this Jam Session. (More listeners, than musicians) The listeners were very appreciative with Peter’s playing, sitting in for a set.\n\nI’d heard about Peter from my old friend John Rakestraw. For a short period of time, they were in a Holiday Inn, commercial road band. John told me about, how great Peter was. (A Real Jazz Drummer)\n\nI accepted the drummer seat with that Daytona Holiday Inn band. But, after consideration, I decided to decline their offer. They weren’t happy about that. My personal objective was the travel and lifestyle. I had a few things going on in Orlando, I didn’t want to toss out.\n\n(Maybe a bad decision on my part) (The group, Hammond B3, Guitar, Female Vocals. They had a commercial sound. Always worked through a booking agent. Steady club hotel lounge gigs were doable then. I decided to be the starving artist.\n\nLater, I called Peter Littmann on the telephone, introduced myself. I requested a drum lesson. He gave me his Daytona address. We booked a day and time.\n\nIn 1972, I’d heard of Chet Baker, but I didn’t know his style or music. I was just starting to study Jazz. I knew that Peter was in Chet Bakers group.\n\nUpon my arrival at Peter’s house in Daytona, we met. He had the look. Very hip, he liked to wear white linen. He smoked those, European brand, cigarettes. His attire was West Coast, but also fit Daytona Beach.\n\nPeter seemed very relaxed with his lifestyle in Daytona. He had married and they had a business. It was a home interior, carpet design business. (more about that later)\n\nThey had a nice home, not far from the Ocean. There wasn’t a drumset in sight. That was in the past, for Peter, at this period of his life. (Not playing music and the drums was something I couldn’t imagine in my 20’s)\n\nI brought my Remo practice pad set to play. I was 21 or 22 at the time. (Full of energy, to become a better drummer)\n\nI hung out with Peter for several hours. We talked about music and drumming. I remember him name dropping, Tony Williams. This was early 70s. I would soon own Tony’s records and start listening. Buy a Gretsch drumset like the “Jazz” drummers. Emergency, Ego and Turn It Over. Peter played some Tony on his record player. Maybe he played a Chet record.\n\nI played something on my Remo pad kit that challenged Peter. Got his attention, in a competitive way. He said, if I keep that up. He’ll have to get his set from the closet. Teach me a lesson.\n\nHe never played or held my sticks. We just hung out. He was an interesting Cat. Another great musician in my lifeline, I regret not getting to know better.\n\nIn the mid-late 70s, probably 1976-1977, Peter played a few times in Orlando and Winter Park. Something had inspired him to get his drums out of the closet.\n\nThe group included several experienced Orlando Jazz musicians. The pianist was Don Scaletta. Don was from San Francisco, California. Before Don’s Disney employment, Don had a life as a Columbia - Capitol recording artist.\n\nMaybe, Don and Peter had an earlier acquaintance, when Peter was with Chet. In the 60s, Don was playing jazz gigs in California. Don was a wonderfully talented piano player.\n\nThe group with Don and Peter was an interesting sound.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, about Peter and his wife having a business. That business required power tools. Unfortunately, Peter had accidently removed a couple fingers from his left hand. When I saw him play, he was wearing a black glove on that hand. (He still sounded great)\n\nI don’t remember his brand of drums, but he had those drums and cymbals, duck taped, dampened to filter and eliminate the overtones.\n\nAt the time, it was unusual, that was a recording studio sound (John Densmore-Al Green-Ringo Thing) (a dry, dead sound, which I now, like very much.\n\nPeter’s group didn’t work together very long. There’s folk tale about Peter’s attitude, pertaining to the musical direction of the group.\n\nI recently discovered a few pieces that tie Peter’s discography together. He should have his own Wikipedia page.\n\nPeter also played with Charlie Mariano (1923-2009) Charlie was from Boston. There’s little discography info and less of his early records on Youtube.\n\nYears ago, looking for info about Peter, one of the pianist I discovered is Dick Twardzik.\n\nDick Twardzik worked in Boston most of his short career. Dick also worked with Charlie Mariano. I’ll post episode one of four, a documentary Youtube video that discusses Dick Twardzik.\n\nI also discovered recent post on Youtube of his trio record. It includes Peter on drums and Carson Smith –bass. It was released on the Pacific Jazz label.\n\nI won’t go into a long critique of this music. It’s worth your journey to listen. I think you’ll agree, it was progressive with new ideas. Peter’s playing is interesting here.\n\nThis trio record is a mystery in the history of 1954, jazz and bebop. It was unfinished at the time.\n\nPeter was part of Dick Twardzik’s working trio. When Chet Baker heard them in Boston. He invited them to California. That was the beginning of the Chet Baker connection.\n\nPeter Littmann and bassist Carson Smith are on the 1954 classic record, Chet Baker Sings. Russ Freeman is playing piano.\n\nChet Baker in Europe was recorded October 11 and 24, 1955. Paris, France. There are several alternative recordings from this tour.\n\nChet Baker Quartet – The Lost Holland Concert (featuring Dick Twardzik) was recorded September 18, 1955. Chet-trumpet / Peter Littmann-drums / Jimmy Bond-bass / Dick Twardzik-piano. (This tour recording is included in the Chet Baker in Europe) 1955\n\nHearing Peter Littmann in his prime on these records has been educational and sad. The world of Jazz drummers in the mid 50s included Roy Haynes, Art Blakey, Max and others. The West Coast drummers were Shelley Mann and Stan Levey.\n\nPeter Littmann was in that league. He actually has many unique aspects that made his playing more modern. His playing on the Chet Baker Quartet – The Lost Holland Concert – recorded in 1955, is as inventive as anyone, more. He really pushes Chet and the band.\n\nAnother is, Chet Baker – The Koln Concert 1955 – same members as above. This has the best drum solo by Peter. It’s an open form solo on the tune, Yellow Tango, written by Dick Twardzik.\n\nChet sings “Someone To Watch Over Me” Dick Twardzik and Chet are perfect on this. (So much potential for this group with Dick Twardzik)\n\nChet and Peter trade extended fours on the Jimmy Heath tune C.T.A.\n\nDick Twardzik died from a heroin overdose during this tour. Paris, France (October 1955) (Age 23)\n\nWhen I met Peter, he had a subscription to the Methadone clinic for his daily download. I’ve known other musicians that had the same subscription. Dick Twardzik died age 23. Chet Baker continued to be a user.\n\nChet Baker and Crew, was recorded July 24-25 and 31, 1956.\n\nPeter plays more subtle and mainstream on this record.\n\nChet Baker – trumpet, vocals / Phil Urso – tenor saxophone / Bobby Timmons - piano / Jimmy Bond – bass / Peter Littmann – drums.\n\nThis record is well recorded. I like the limited solos. Two choruses and out. Peter’s time on this record is much more focused than the (Live) recordings. Bobby Timmons is a real solid time player.\n\nI have zero idea what Peter did after this record. Chet Baker moved on with other projects.\n\nThis feature on Peter Littmann has been an interesting journey. Finding different records and Youtube material, while in progress, expanded my original content.\n\nWe know the unfortunate life of Chet Baker. Dick Twardzic included. That trio of musicians, Chet, Dick and Peter was a unique combination. Those few recorded moments on records are historical.\n\nI’m still in the 70s with my featured 100 drummers. Stay tuned for the next Substack drop. I’m satisfied that my subscribers seem to open and read my post. I only have 50.\n\nIf you can share , I’d appreciate it."
