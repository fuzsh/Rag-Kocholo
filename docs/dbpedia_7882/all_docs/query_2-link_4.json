        "text": "American actor, animator, filmmaker, and singer (born 1973)\n\nSeth Woodbury MacFarlane ( ; born October 26, 1973) is an American actor, animator, writer, producer, director, comedian, and singer. He is best known as the creator and star of the television series Family Guy (since 1999) and The Orville (2017–2022), and co-creator of the television series American Dad! (since 2005) and The Cleveland Show (2009–2013). He also co-wrote, directed, and starred in the films Ted (2012) and its sequel Ted 2 (2015), and A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).\n\nMacFarlane is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied animation.[1] Recruited to Hollywood, he was an animator and writer for Hanna-Barbera for television series, including Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, Dexter's Laboratory, and the animated short Larry & Steve for What a Cartoon!. MacFarlane made guest appearances as an actor on television series, such as Gilmore Girls, Star Trek: Enterprise, The War at Home, and FlashForward. In 2008, he created the online series Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. MacFarlane has won several awards for his work on Family Guy, including five Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2009, he won the Webby Award for Film & Video Person of the Year.\n\nMacFarlane has performed as a singer at Carnegie Hall in New York City and the Royal Albert Hall in London. He has released eight studio albums, in the vein of Frank Sinatra, with influences from jazz orchestrations, and Hollywood musicals beginning with Music Is Better Than Words in 2011. MacFarlane has received five Grammy Award nominations for his work.[2] He has frequently collaborated with artists such as Sara Bareilles, Norah Jones, and Elizabeth Gillies on his albums.[3] He hosted the 85th Academy Awards in 2013 and was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" from Ted.[4]\n\nMacFarlane was executive producer of the Neil deGrasse Tyson-hosted Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, an update of the 1980s Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan.[5] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2019 and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMacFarlane was born and raised in Kent, Connecticut.[1] His parents, Ronald Milton MacFarlane (b. 1946) and Ann Perry (née Sager; 1947–2010), were born in Newburyport, Massachusetts.[6] His younger sister Rachael is also a voice actress. His maternal grandfather, Arthur Sager, competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics in track and field. MacFarlane's parents met in 1970 when they lived and worked in Boston, Massachusetts, and married later that year.[6] They moved to Kent in 1972, where Ann began working in the admissions office at South Kent School. She later worked in the college guidance and admissions offices at the Kent School, a selective college preparatory school, where Ronald was a teacher.[6][7]\n\nAs a child, MacFarlane developed an interest in illustration, and at the age of two he began drawing cartoon characters such as Fred Flintstone and Woody Woodpecker.[8] By age five, he knew he wanted to pursue a career in animation, and began by creating flip books after his parents found a book on the subject for him.[9] Four years later, at nine, he began publishing a weekly comic strip, Walter Crouton, for The Kent Good Times Dispatch, the local newspaper; it paid him five dollars per week.[10][11] MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always \"weirdly fascinated by the Communion ceremony\". He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking \"Can I have fries with that?\" The paper printed it and he got an \"angry letter\" from the local priest; it led to \"sort of a little mini-controversy\" in the town.[12] MacFarlane received his high school diploma in 1991 from the Kent School.[6][7] While there, he continued experimenting with animation, and his parents gave him an 8 mm camera.[13]\n\nAfter graduating from high school, MacFarlane attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where he majored in animation. As a student, he intended to work for Disney, but changed his mind after seeing The Simpsons.[14] During his time at RISD, he performed stand-up comedy.[15] He also starred in many student films, meeting future Family Guy cast member Mike Henry, whose brother Patrick was MacFarlane's classmate.[16] In his senior year, he made his thesis film, The Life of Larry, which became the inspiration for Family Guy.[10] A professor submitted his film to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera, where he was later hired.[17] He graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.[10]\n\nCareer\n\nTelevision career\n\nHanna-Barbera years\n\nMacFarlane was recruited during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert.[18] He went to work at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of The Life of Larry, rather than on his drawing abilities. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent.[1] He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoons series.[1] He created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry & Steve, featuring a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. The short was broadcast as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an \"old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or you jump from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another\". MacFarlane worked on three television series during his tenure at the studio: Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, and Johnny Bravo.[19][20] Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on Johnny Bravo. He found it easier to develop his own style at Johnny Bravo through the show's process of scriptwriting, which Dexter's Laboratory and Cow and Chicken did not use.[1] As a part of the Johnny Bravo crew, he met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of Schoolhouse Rock! fame. These meetings later became significant to the production and success of his Family Guy series.\n\nHe also did freelance work for Walt Disney Television Animation, writing for Jungle Cubs, and for Nelvana, where he wrote for Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Through strict observation of writing elements such as story progression, character stakes and plot points, MacFarlane found the work for Disney was, from a writing standpoint, very valuable in preparation for his career (particularly on Ace Ventura).[1] He also created and wrote a short titled Zoomates for Frederator Studios' Oh Yeah! Cartoons on Nickelodeon.[21] Executives at the Fox Broadcasting Company saw both Larry shorts and negotiations soon began for a prime-time animated series.[22]\n\nFamily Guy\n\nMain article: Family Guy\n\nAlthough MacFarlane enjoyed working at Hanna-Barbera, he felt his real calling was for prime-time animation, which would allow a much edgier style of humor.[1] He first pitched Family Guy to Fox during his tenure at Hanna-Barbera. A development executive there, who was trying to get back into prime-time business, introduced MacFarlane to Leslie Kolins and Mike Darnell, heads of the alternative comedy department at Fox. After the success of King of the Hill in 1997, MacFarlane called Kolins once more to ask about a possible second pitch for the series. Fox offered the young writer a strange deal: They gave him a budget of $50,000 (equivalent to $95,000 in 2023) to produce a pilot that could lead to a series (most episodes of animated prime-time productions cost at least $1 million).[1][23] Recalling the experience in an interview with The New York Times, MacFarlane said: \"I spent about six months with no sleep and no life, just drawing like crazy in my kitchen and doing this pilot.\"[24]\n\nAfter six months, MacFarlane returned to Fox with a \"very, very simply, crudely animated film—with just enough to get the tone of the show across\" to present to the executives, who loved the pilot and immediately ordered the series.[1] In July 1998, they announced the purchase of Family Guy for a January 1999 debut.[25] Family Guy was originally intended to be a series of shorts on MADtv, much in the same way The Simpsons had begun on The Tracey Ullman Show a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's MADtv connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns.[1] At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.[8]\n\nFamily Guy first aired January 31, 1999.[26] MacFarlane's work in animating Family Guy was influenced by Jackie Gleason and Hanna-Barbera along with examples from The Simpsons and All in the Family.[27] In addition to writing three episodes, \"Death Has a Shadow\", \"Family Guy Viewer Mail 1\", and \"North by North Quahog\", MacFarlane voices Family Guy's main male characters of Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire, as well as Tom Tucker, his son Jake Tucker, and other characters. Bolstered by high DVD sales and fan loyalty, Family Guy developed into a $1-billion franchise.[23] On May 4, 2008, after approximately 2+1⁄2 years of negotiations, MacFarlane reached a $100-million agreement with Fox to keep Family Guy and American Dad! until 2012. It made him the world's highest paid television writer.[28]\n\nMacFarlane's success with Family Guy opened doors to other ventures relating to the show. On April 26, 2005, he and composer Walter Murphy created Family Guy: Live in Vegas. The soundtrack features a Broadway show tune theme, and MacFarlane voiced Stewie in the track \"Stewie's Sexy Party\".[29] A fan of Broadway musicals,[22] MacFarlane comments on using musicals as a component of Family Guy:\n\nI love the lush orchestration and old-fashioned melody writing ... it just gets you excited, that kind of music\", he said. \"It's very optimistic. And it's fun. The one thing that's missing for me from popular music today is fun. Guys like [Bing] Crosby, or [Frank] Sinatra, or Dean Martin, or Mel Tormé [...] these are guys who sounded like they were having a great time.[30]\n\nA Family Guy video game was released in 2006.[31] Two years later, in August 2007, MacFarlane closed a digital content production deal with AdSense.[32] He takes cast members on the road to voice characters in front of live audiences. Family Guy Live provides fans with the opportunity to hear future scripts. In mid-2007, Chicago fans had the opportunity to hear the then upcoming sixth-season premiere \"Blue Harvest\". Shows have played in Montreal, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[33]\n\nOn July 22, 2007, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he might start work on a feature film, although \"nothing's official\".[34] In September 2007, Ricky Blitt gave TV.com an interview confirming that he had already started working on the script.[35] Then in TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime \"within the next year\".[36] He came up with an idea for the story, \"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie\". He later went on to say he imagines the film to be \"an old-style musical with dialogue\" similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would \"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel\".[37] On October 13, 2011, MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, and that he would write it with series co-producer Ricky Blitt.[38] On November 30, 2012, he confirmed plans for the project.[39] The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on Ted 2.[40] In 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based on the series is in development.[41][42] MacFarlane stepped away from the series in 2011 to work on Ted and other projects, and has only been associated with the show as a voice actor since then.[43]\n\nDespite its popularity, Family Guy has often been criticized.[44] The Parents Television Council has been a frequent critic. It organized a letter-writing campaign to remove it from Fox's lineup,[45] and filed complaints with the Federal Communications Commission alleging that some of its episodes contained indecent content.[46] MacFarlane has responded to the PTC's criticism by saying, among other things: \"That's like getting hate mail from Hitler. They're literally terrible human beings.\"[47]\n\nFamily Guy has been cancelled twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider.[48] MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers: \"One of the positive aspects of Family Guy constantly being pulled off [the air] is that we were always having to restaff writers.\"[30]\n\nDuring its sixth season, episodes of Family Guy and American Dad! were delayed from regular broadcast due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. MacFarlane participated in the strike to support the writers, and Fox aired three Family Guy episodes without his permission. The strike ended on February 12, 2008,[49] and the series resumed airing regularly, beginning with \"Back to the Woods\".[citation needed]\n\nAmerican Dad!\n\nMain article: American Dad!\n\nMacFarlane has a second long-running, successful adult animated series in American Dad! which has been in production since early 2005. To date, it is his only animated series that has never been cancelled, though it did undergo a network relocation from Fox to TBS on October 20, 2014, following its 11th season. TBS announced on July 16, 2013, that they had picked up the series for a 15-episode 12th season. The purpose of the network relocation was originally to make room for new comedies on FOX, such as Mulaney and another animated series from Seth MacFarlane called Bordertown on Fox's now-defunct \"Animation Domination\" programming block.\n\nWhile MacFarlane does extensive voice acting work for American Dad!, he has left much of its creative direction up to Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker, feeling it helps give the series its own voice and identity.[50] It was announced on November 4, 2013, that Barker would depart American Dad! after 10 seasons as producer/co-showrunner.[51][52]\n\nAmerican Dad! was first shown after Super Bowl XXXIX, debuting with the episode \"Pilot\", which MacFarlane co-wrote. This February 6, 2005, series premiere was somewhat of an early sneak preview as the program did not begin airing regularly until May 1, 2005.[53][54] Because of atypical scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has a controversial season number discrepancy in which many are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there have been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between American Dad! creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website.[55][56] At San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, Barker hinted that an American Dad! movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. However, at San Diego Comic-Con in 2022, Weitzman revealed plans for the film were scrapped.[57]\n\nMacFarlane has described the initial seasons of American Dad! as being similar to All in the Family, likening title character Stan Smith's originally bigoted persona to Archie Bunker.[30] MacFarlane has also stated that his inspiration to create American Dad! derived from his and Weitzman's exasperation with George W. Bush's policies as former United States President.[58] After the early couple of seasons however, the series discontinued using these elements of political satire[59] and began to serve up its own brand of entertainment and humor.[50] MacFarlane was described as having difficulty understanding the series in its early going; however, he heavily warmed up to the series after its early seasons once he felt the show truly came into its own. His fellow co-creators have sensed this through MacFarlane's greatly increased attention to the series after its early seasons. MacFarlane has also revealed he is an American Dad! fan himself. He has taken note of the positive reaction to the \"Roger\" character by fans via his Twitter.[56]\n\nThe show focuses on the Smith family: Stan Smith, the endangering, dog-eat-dog, rash and inconsiderate head of the household. He has an exaggeratedly large chin and masculine manner about him. As the family's breadwinner, he works as a CIA officer and was initially portrayed in the series as an old-fashioned conservative bigot but has since grown out of these traits (the show is known for its story arc elements and other distinguishing plot techniques); Stan's paradoxically moralistic yet simultaneously inappropriate, corrupt wife, Francine; and their two children, new-age hippie daughter Hayley and nerdy son Steve. Accompanying the Smith family are three additional main characters, two of which belong to non-human species: zany, shocking, blithely cruel and rascally alien Roger, who's full of disguises/alter egos and has few if any limits on his behaviors. He was rescued by Stan from Area 51; Klaus, the man-in-a-fish-body pet. Klaus's unenviable situation came about from the brain of an East German Olympic skier being shrunk and transplanted into a fish body; and Jeff Fischer, Hayley's boyfriend turned \"whipped\" husband, known for his infatuation with Hayley's mom, Francine.[60][61] Together, the Smiths and their three housemates run what is only at a first glance the typical middle-class American lifestyle, but is anything but.\n\nMacFarlane provides the voices of Stan and Roger, basing Roger's voice on Paul Lynde (who played Uncle Arthur in Bewitched).[8] His sister Rachael MacFarlane provides the voice of Hayley.[62]\n\nThe Cleveland Show\n\nMain article: The Cleveland Show\n\nMacFarlane developed a Family Guy spin-off called The Cleveland Show, which focuses on the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by Family Guy writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes,[63] was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season even premiered.[64] Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the back nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44.[65] The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes. The character of Cleveland and his family returned to Family Guy in the episode \"He's Bla-ack!\".[66]\n\nThis is the only animated series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character. MacFarlane did, however, play the character Tim the Bear until season 3 episode 10. Jess Harnell voiced Tim from season 3 episode 11 onwards.\n\nCavalcade of Cartoon Comedy\n\nIn 2008, MacFarlane released a series of webisodes known as Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy with its animated shorts sponsored by Burger King and released weekly.[67]\n\nThe Orville\n\nMain article: The Orville\n\nIn 2016, MacFarlane began producing the sci-fi comedy-drama series The Orville, in which he also stars as Captain Edward \"Ed\" Mercer.[68] MacFarlane originally wrote The Orville as a spec script, which was given a 13-episode order by Fox in May 2016, making it the first live-action television series created by MacFarlane.[69] The series premiered on September 10, 2017.[70] Despite the first season receiving negative reviews, it was renewed for a second season.[71] The second season premiered on December 30, 2018, and received better reviews.[72]\n\nThe series was renewed for a third season by Fox, however the series would move over to Hulu.[73] This season is the show's first on Hulu, after airing its previous two seasons on Fox, as well as the first to premiere since The Walt Disney Company's March 2019 acquisition of 20th Century Fox.[74] The season was originally scheduled to premiere in 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[75] The third season titled as The Orville: New Horizons premiered on June 2, 2022. Due to the pandemic, an episode of third season was scrapped, which MacFarlane subsequently turned into a novel, titled The Orville: Sympathy for the Devil.[77]\n\nTelevision producing\n\nMacFarlane was the executive producer of a live-action sitcom starring Rob Corddry called The Winner. The plot has a man named Glen discussing the time he matured at 32 and has him pursuing his only love after she moves in next door. Glen meets her son and both become good friends.[78] The show ran on Fox for six episodes in Spring 2007.[79][80]\n\nIn August 2011, Fox ordered a 13-part updated series of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. MacFarlane co-produced the series with Ann Druyan and Steven Soter. The new series is hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson and began airing on the channel in March 2014, with repeats airing on the National Geographic Channel on the next night.[81] In addition to serving as one of the executive producers, MacFarlane provided voices for characters during the animated portions of the series. MacFarlane returned to executive produce and provide voices to its sequel series, Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which aired in 2020.[82]\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, MacFarlane produced one season of a live-action sitcom called Dads.[83] The series, revolves around Eli, played by Seth Green, and Warner, played by Giovanni Ribisi, two successful guys in their 30s whose world is turned upside down when their dads move in with them. MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild executive-produced the series, with Sulkin and Wild writing.[84]\n\nIn 2014, MacFarlane executive produced a two-season, 20-episode series called Blunt Talk for Starz.[85][86][87] The series followed an English newscaster who moves to Los Angeles with his alcoholic manservant and the baggage of several failed marriages to host a sanctimonious talk show.\n\nIn 2009, MacFarlane began work on the animated series Bordertown.[88] The series is set in Texas and follows a border patrol agent and a Mexican immigrant, satirizing America's changing cultural landscape. It ran for 13 episodes in the first half of 2016, on Fox.[89]\n\nTelevision hosting\n\nMacFarlane has participated in the Comedy Central Roasts. MacFarlane is the only person to serve as roastmaster for more than one roast.

In addition to hosting, MacFarlane was also nominated in the Academy Award for Best Original Song category for co-writing the theme song \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\" for his film Ted with Walter Murphy.[94] Critical response to MacFarlane's performance was mixed. Columnist Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly commented \"By calling constant attention to the naughty factor,\" MacFarlane created \"an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln.\"[95] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did \"impressively better than one would have wagered.\" He also noted that he added \"plenty of niceties with a little bit of the Ricky Gervais bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely.\"[96] He stirred up controversy in the form of a musical number titled \"We Saw Your Boobs\".[97]\n\nOn October 29, 2014, it was announced that MacFarlane would host the Breakthrough Prize ceremony.

In an interview with NPR, he commented on their training style: \"They really drill you. They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help ... [They teach you to] show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he's singing, there's a lot of very exposed teeth. That was something Lee Sweetland hit on day in and day out, and correctly so, because it just brightens the whole performance.\"[176] In 2009, MacFarlane appeared as a vocalist at the BBC Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in Prom 22, A Celebration of Classic MGM Film Musicals.[177] In 2010, he reappeared at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a Christmas concert special.

In 2008, prior to the holding of the Obergefell v. Hodges case by the United States Supreme Court, MacFarlane called it \"infuriating and idiotic\" that two gay partners \"have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'\" He went on to say: \"I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time.\"[199]\n\nIn recognition of \"his active, passionate commitment to humanist values, and his fearless support of equal marriage rights and other social justice issues\", MacFarlane was named the Harvard Humanist of the Year in 2011.[200]\n\nSpeaking engagements\n\nMacFarlane is a frequent speaking guest on college campuses.[201] On April 16, 2006, he was invited by Stanford University's ASSU Speakers' Bureau to address an audience of over 1,000 at Memorial Auditorium.[202] He was invited by Harvard University's class of 2006 to deliver the \"class day\" address on June 7, 2006.

Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, and although he refused to work on the show during the strike, his contract with Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it subsequently produced.[210] Rumors of continued production on Family Guy prompted the statement from MacFarlane that \".....it would just be a colossal dick move if they did that\".[210] During the strike, MacFarlane wrote an inside joke into an episode of Family Guy about Jon Stewart's choice to return to the air and undermine the writers of The Daily Show, causing Stewart to respond with an angry phone-call, harassing MacFarlane and arguing his point.[211] The strike ended on February 12, 2008.[49]\n\n2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike\n\nDuring the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, MacFarlane donated $1 million to The Entertainment Community Fund to Support Film and Television Workers During Strikes.

MacFarlane said, \"The work of Carl Sagan has been a profound influence in my life, and the life of every individual who recognizes the importance of humanity's ongoing commitment to the exploration of our universe [...] The continuance of our journey outward into space should always occupy some part of our collective attention, regardless of whatever Snooki did last week.\"[213][214][215] The collection opened on November 12, 2013.[216][217]\n\nFilm preservation\n\nOn April 20, 2024 MacFarlane partnered with Martin Scorsese to showcase Back From the Ink: Restored Animated Shorts at the 2024 TCM Classic Film Festival. MacFarlane and Scorsese funded the restoration, and worked with the UCLA Film and Television Archive and The Film Foundation with Paramount Pictures Archives.[218][219]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMacFarlane lives in Beverly Hills, California.[220] He is not married nor does he have any children.[221][222]\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Daily Princetonian, he noted his similarities to Brian Griffin from Family Guy: \"I have some Brian type issues from time to time—looking for the right person—but I date as much as the next guy.\"[223]\n\nThe morning after his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, on September 10, 2001,[224] MacFarlane was scheduled to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11, one of the planes hijacked in the September 11 attacks. Due to a hangover after the previous night's celebrations and an incorrect departure time (8:15 a.m. instead of 7:45 a.m.) from his travel agent,[225][226] he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight, as the gates had been closed.[225][226] Speaking of his experience of missing the fatal trip, MacFarlane said:\n\nThe only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people have a lot of close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car... This one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the back of my head.[227]\n\nThe Family Guy episode \"Boy (Dog) Meets Girl (Dog)\" references the incident.\n\nOn July 16, 2010, MacFarlane's mother, Ann Perry Sager, died from cancer. Her death was reported by Larry King on his show Larry King Live, who acknowledged a conversation he had with her during an interview with MacFarlane in May 2010.[6][228]\n\nFrom 2012 to 2013, MacFarlane was in a relationship with the British actress Emilia Clarke.[229][230]\n\nMacFarlane is a self-described atheist, explaining his beliefs, \"I do not believe in God. I'm an atheist. I consider myself a critical thinker, and it fascinates me that in the 21st century most people still believe in, as George Carlin puts it, 'the invisible man living in the sky'.\"[231][232]\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing Family Guy of infringing its copyright on the song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", through a parody song titled \"I Need a Jew\" appearing in the episode \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\". Bourne Co., which holds the copyright, alleged the parody pairs a \"thinly veiled\" copy of their music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network and Walter Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.[233] Bourne argued that \"I Need a Jew\" uses the copyrighted melody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.[234][235] On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that Family Guy did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.[236]\n\nIn December 2007, Family Guy was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature magic parody act, involving absurd faux magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune \"Fine and Dandy\".[237] MacFarlane, 20th Century Fox, Steve Callaghan, and Alex Borstein were all named in the suit.[238] In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved—\"purpose and character of the use\", \"nature of the infringed work\", and \"amount and substantiality of the taking\"—counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth—\"economic impact\"—had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers—not Metrano or his act.[239][240][241] The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.[242]\n\nOn July 16, 2014, MacFarlane was served with a lawsuit from the production company of a series of Internet videos called Charlie the Abusive Teddy Bear claiming that Ted infringes on the copyright of its videos due to the Ted bear largely matching the background story, persona, voice tone, attitude, and dialogue of the Charlie bear.[243] The suit was dismissed with prejudice on March 23, 2015, after the plaintiffs conceded Ted was independently created and withdrew the suit.[244][245][246]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nMacFarlane has been nominated for twenty-four Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on Family Guy and has won five times, in 2000, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2019.[247] He has been nominated for five Grammy Awards for his work in Family Guy: Live in Vegas, Music Is Better Than Words, Family Guy, No One Ever Tells You and In Full Swing.[248][249][250][251] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing the opening song, \"Everybody Needs a Best Friend\", from his film Ted with the film's composer Walter Murphy.[94]\n\nHe has received numerous awards from other organizations, including the Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production and the Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation for the Family Guy episode titled \"Blue Harvest\", the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo and the Empire Award for Best Comedy for Ted.[252][253] In 2019, MacFarlane received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6259 Hollywood Blvd.[254] In 2020, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.[255]\n\nIn 2022, a new species of Hyloscirtus frog (Hyloscirtus sethmacfarlanei) was described from Ecuador and named after him.[256]\n\nFilmography\n\nMain article: Seth MacFarlane filmography\n\nStewie Griffin: The Untold Story (2005)\n\nHellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)\n\nFuturama: Into the Wild Green Yonder (2009)\n\nThe Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!
