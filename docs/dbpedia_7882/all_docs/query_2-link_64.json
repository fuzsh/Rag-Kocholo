If you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention immediately. If you can't reach your healthcare provider, go to the emergency room and inform them of your recent pregnancy.\n\nUrgent Maternal Warning Signs:\n\nHeadache: A headache that won't go away or worsens over time.\n\nDizziness or Fainting\n\nVision Changes: Any sudden changes in your vision.\n\nFever: A fever of 100.4°F or higher.\n\nSwelling: Extreme swelling of your hands or face.\n\nThoughts of Harm: Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.\n\nBreathing Issues: Trouble breathing or chest pain with a fast-beating heart.\n\nSevere Nausea and Vomiting\n\nSevere Belly Pain: Persistent severe pain in your belly.\n\nBaby’s Movement: Reduced or no movement from your baby during pregnancy.\n\nLeg or Arm Pain: Severe swelling, redness, or pain in your leg or arm.\n\nVaginal Issues: Vaginal bleeding or fluid leakage during pregnancy.\n\nPostpartum Bleeding: Heavy vaginal bleeding or discharge after pregnancy.\n\nOverwhelming Tiredness\n\nSpot the Signs & Save a Life! Remember, your health and your baby’s health are the priority. Don’t hesitate to seek help if something doesn’t feel right.\n\nCervical Cancer\n\nCervical cancer is a disease in which cells in the cervix grow out of control.\n\nThe cervix connects the vagina (birth canal) to the upper part of the uterus (womb).\n\nAnyone with a cervix is at risk for cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with certain types of HPV. For more information about HPV click here.\n\nScreening Tests and HPV Vaccine\n\nScreening tests like the Pap test and HPV test can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early. The HPV vaccine can also help prevent cervical cancer. For more information about the HPV vaccine click here.\n\nSymptoms\n\nEarly on cervical cancer may not cause any signs or symptoms. Later, advanced cervical cancer may cause bleeding or discharge not normal for you and bleeding after sex.\n\nCervical Cancer Screening Options\n\nThe United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends cervical cancer screening begin at age 21. The table below lists screening recommendations for you. Talk to your doctor about which option is best for you.\n\nUSPSTF Screening Recommendation:\n\n21-29: Pap tests every three years\n\n30-65: Pap test every three years, or Pap test and HPV test every five years, or HPV test alone every five years\n\n>65: No screening necessary after 2 negative screening tests within the last 10 years and the most recent in the past 3-5 years\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nCDC: Cervical Cancer\n\nBreastCare Program\n\nERAVE User Application Form\n\nFill out my Wufoo form!\n\nUniversal Newborn Hearing Screening, Tracking and Intervention Advisory Board\n\nAct 1559 of 1999 established requirements for birthing hospitals’ newborn hearing screening programs and providers administering a follow-up screening or diagnostic evaluation and created the Universal Newborn Hearing, Screening, Tracking, and Intervention (UNHS) Advisory Board. The UNHS advisory board is designed to provide the state with the information necessary to effectively plan, establish, and evaluate a comprehensive system of appropriate services for children that are at risk for or identified with a hearing condition. The board is composed of seven (7) members appointed by the Governor, with recommendations from the Arkansas Speech-Language-Hearing Association, from the following professions or groups:\n\nOne (1) audiologist\n\nOne (1) audiologist from the Arkansas Department of Health\n\nOne (1) audiologist from Arkansas Children’s Hospital\n\nOne (1) speech-language pathologist\n\nOne (1) pediatrician-neonatologist or ear, nose, and throat physician\n\nOne (1) adult who is deaf or hard of hearing to represent consumer organizations for deaf and hard of hearing persons\n\nOne (1) consumer of services who is a parent of a child or children with hearing loss\n\nAs per Act 1559, the Board meets at least semiannually to carry out their business which includes:\n\nConducting surveillance to improve access to early hearing detection and intervention services.\n\nSupporting the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing’s recommendations for early hearing detection and intervention by developing practice recommendations for clinicians statewide.\n\nConnecting individuals and organizations supporting children that are at risk for or identified with a hearing condition.\n\nApproving an annual report for the House and Senate Interim Committees on Public Health, Labor, and Welfare which provides information such as, but not limited to, the number of birthing hospitals in compliance with the Act, the number of Deaf or Hard of Hearing children identified, and the availability of follow-up services. The annual report provides a close look at hearing screening activities in birthing hospitals throughout the State of Arkansas, and results of follow-up screening, and outcome measures. Data collected by the Infant Hearing Program each year outlines the strength and weaknesses of the Program; therefore, directing the development and expansion of goals toward improvement.\n\nBoard Meetings: The board meets at 3pm on the 4th Tuesday in April and October via Zoom.\n\nMeeting Minutes:\n\nOctober 2023\n\nApril 2023\n\nOctober 2022\n\nApril 2022\n\nResources:\n\nAct 1559 of 1999\n\nRules\n\nArkansas Department of Health-Infant Hearing Program\n\nEarly Hearing Detection and Intervention Flow Chart\n\nEarly Hearing Detection Roadmap\n\nArkansas Academy of Audiology\n\nArkansas Academy of Family Physicians\n\nArkansas Board of Examiners in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology\n\nArkansas Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatric\n\nArkansas Nurses Association\n\nArkansas Speech-Language-Hearing Association\n\nArkansas Society of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery\n\nAdvisory Board Portal Login – (Board Members Only)\n\nInfant Hearing Program\n\n5800 W. 10th Street, Suite 808\n\nLittle Rock, AR 72204\n\nP: 501-280-4740\n\nF: 501-280-4769\n\nHeat Risks\n\nKnow the heat-related risks and practice heat safety\n\nHeat stress is a heat-related illness. It happens when your body cannot cool down properly. The body normally cools itself by sweating, but sweating is not enough under certain conditions.\n\nWho is at higher risk?\n\nChildren aged four or younger\n\nSeniors aged 65 or older\n\nAnyone overweight\n\nAnyone who is ill or on certain medications\n\nHeat-related illnesses are preventable\n\nSimple tips to prevent heat stress are:\n\nStay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day. If your home does not have air conditioning, consider public places like a library, senior center, or mall.\n\nWear light, loose-fitting clothing.\n\nAvoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside or without air conditioning.\n\nAvoid unnecessary sun exposure. Wear a hat and sunglasses when you are in the sun.\n\nDrink water often. Don’t wait until you are thirsty.\n\nCommon Heat-Related Illnesses:\n\nHeat Stroke: Call 911 right away, move to a cooler place, and help lower the body temperature with cool clothes or a cool bath.\n\nSymptoms of Heat Stroke\n\nHigh body temperature (over 104 F or 40 C)\n\nHot, red, dry, or damp skin\n\nFast, strong pulse\n\nHeadache\n\nDizziness\n\nNausea\n\nConfusion\n\nFainting\n\nHeat Exhaustion: Move to a cool place, loosen clothes, put cool, wet clothes on the body, or take a cool bath and sip water. Get medical help immediately if vomiting, dizziness, or symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour.\n\nSymptoms of Heat Exhaustion\n\nHeavy sweating\n\nCold, pale, and clammy skin\n\nFast, weak pulse\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nMuscle cramps\n\nTiredness or weakness\n\nDizziness\n\nHeadache\n\nFainting\n\nHeat Cramps: Stop physical activity and move to a cool place, drink water or a sports drink, and wait for cramps to go away before starting more physical activity. Get medical help immediately if someone is on a low-sodium diet, has heart problems, or if cramps last longer than one hour.\n\nSymptoms of Heat Cramps\n\nHeavy sweating during intense exercise\n\nMuscle pain or spasms\n\nHeat Rash: The best treatment is a cooler, less humid work environment when possible. Keep the rash area dry.\n\nSymptoms of Heat Rash\n\nSkin irritation looks like red clusters of small blisters that look like pimples on the skin\n\nUsually appear on the neck, chest, groin, or elbow creases\n\nHeatRisk Tracking Tool\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the CDC have a new heat forecast tool called HeatRisk. The HeatRisk Dashboard combines health and temperature data to give a 7-day outlook for hot weather. It uses a 5-level scale to show how risky the heat level in a specific area is.\n\nKnowing the temperature is important to avoid exposure to extreme heat. Extreme heat is when summertime temperatures are much hotter or more humid than average. Humid conditions can make high temperatures more intense, make it harder to stay cool and promote mold growth indoors. Keep indoor humidity levels at 50 percent or below for health and comfort.\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nNational Weather Service Map\n\nHeath Advisory Map\n\nHeat Stress Awareness for Workers: OSHA | Fact Sheet\n\nExtreme Heat: CDC guidance | EPA guidance | American Red Cross | Ready.gov\n\nPediatric Vehicular Heatstroke (PVH): Fact Sheet\n\nCoach Safely Act\n\nPractice Heat Safety\n\nBackyard Poultry-Associated Salmonellosis\n\nBackground\n\nAny backyard poultry can carry Salmonella germs that can make you sick. Always take steps to stay healthy around your flock.\n\nBackyard poultry, such as chickens and ducks, can carry Salmonella germs even if they look healthy and clean. These germs can quickly spread to anything in the areas where the poultry live and roam. You can get sick from touching your backyard poultry or anything in their environment, touching your mouth or food, and swallowing Salmonella germs.\n\nWhat You Should Do\n\nWash your hands\n\nAlways wash your hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam.\n\nUse hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Consider keeping hand sanitizer at your coop.\n\nBe safe around backyard flocks\n\nDon’t kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don’t eat or drink around them. This can spread Salmonella germs to your mouth and make you sick.\n\nKeep your backyard poultry and the supplies you use to care for them (like feed containers and shoes you wear in the coop) outside of the house. You should also clean the supplies outside the house.\n\nSupervise kids around flocks\n\nAlways supervise children around backyard poultry and make sure they wash their hands properly.\n\nDon’t let children younger than five years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry. Young children are more likely to get sick from germs like Salmonella.\n\nHandle eggs safely\n\nCollect eggs often. Eggs that sit in the nest can become dirty or break.\n\nThrow away cracked eggs. Germs on the shell can more easily enter the egg through a cracked shell.\n\nRub off dirt on eggs with a brush, a cloth, or fine sandpaper. Don’t wash eggs because colder water can pull germs into the egg.\n\nRefrigerate eggs to keep them fresh and slow the growth of germs.\n\nCook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm and cook egg dishes to an internal temperature of 160°F to kill all germs.\n\nCall your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these severe symptoms:\n\nDiarrhea and a fever higher than 102°F\n\nDiarrhea for more than three days that is not improving\n\nBloody diarrhea\n\nSo much vomiting that you cannot keep liquids down\n\nSigns of dehydration, such as:\n\nNot peeing much\n\nDry mouth and throat\n\nFeeling dizzy when standing up\n\nSymptoms of Salmonella\n\nMost people infected with Salmonella experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.\n\nSymptoms usually start 6 hours to 6 days after swallowing the bacteria.\n\nMost people recover without treatment after 4 to 7 days.\n\nSome people—especially children younger than five years, adults 65 years and older, and people with weakened immune systems—may experience more severe illnesses that require medical treatment or hospitalization.\n\nFor more information about Salmonella, see Salmonella Questions and Answers.\n\nFor more information about Backyard Poultry-Associated Salmonellosis, click here.\n\nOther Resources\n\nCDC Checklist for Starting a Backyard Flock\n\nCDC Coops: Episode 1: Doja Chick\n\nCDC Coops: Episode 2: Chick Inn\n\nCDC Salmonella Questions and Answers\n\nFDA: Salmonella and Egg Safety\n\nMedication Recall - Tri-Lo-Sprintec\n\nTeva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., has recalled the below lot numbers of the Tri-Lo­Sprintec® 28 Day Regimen for birth control:\n\nLot 100038111, Exp.

The selection of the scholars is made by a review committee composed of the Chief Science Officer, Science Advisory Committee at ADH, as well as Department Heads, the Dean, and Associate Deans at the COPH.\n\nEach student receives a stipend of $4,000 for the 8-week program and is assigned a mentor that they will work with on a project in one of several possible areas concerning public health, either within one of the Centers at ADH or at the UAMS College of Public Health. This is not a clinical program. This experience provides the students with an introduction to public health, exposure to applied and basic public health science and practice, and health policy development. The scholars are expected to attend weekly seminars and meetings held at ADH and COPH where public health topics are presented, discussed, and researched. After their internship, Stead Scholars present a brief PowerPoint presentation to ADH and COPH personnel and leadership on their topic, in conjunction with their mentors.\n\nFor the Summer of 2024, registration will open in December and close in mid-February.\n\nLearn more about Dr. William W.

The infection is known to attack the nervous system, causing swollen nerves, discoloration and/or inflamed skin, and loss of feeling in affected areas. Without treatment, Hansen’s Disease can cause paralysis of hands and feet, loss of fingers and toes, and blindness, among other symptoms.\n\nHistorically, Leprosy was feared as a highly contagious and dangerous disease. However, modern medical science has revealed that Hansen’s Disease is slow to progress and difficult to spread. Transmission requires long exposure times and, once transmission occurs, the disease can take years to manifest any symptoms.\n\nOnce detected, Hansen’s Disease can be treated and cured with antibiotics, however, treatment cannot reverse existing symptoms, so it is important to begin treatment as quickly as possible after detection of the disease. It is imperative that you complete your treatment regimen as directed by a physician. Failure to do so can result in the development of antibiotic resistance. There is no vaccine for Hansen’s Disease, however, most people are already naturally immune.\n\nTransmission & Risk Factors\n\nWhile it is unclear how exactly Hansen’s Disease is transmitted between people, it is evident that the disease does not transmit easily. The disease appears to require extensive close contact over the course of several months or even years to be spread between individuals. It cannot be spread through casual contact; it is entirely safe to shake hands or share a meal with someone with Hansen’s Disease. Further, Hansen’s Disease cannot be spread through sexual contact, and cannot be passed from parent to child during pregnancy. Hansen’s Disease cannot be transmitted at all once treatment has been started.\n\nM. leprae is known to be found naturally in armadillos is the southern United States, and it is suspected that transmission between armadillos and humans can occur, albeit very rarely. While the risk of catching Hansen’s Disease through brief contact with an armadillo is very low, it is best to avoid contact with armadillos when possible.\n\nHansen’s Disease is very rare in the US, with <200 new cases diagnosed each year nationwide. The disease is somewhat more prevalent in some countries, most notably in Brazil, India, Indonesia, and much of South-Central Africa. Even in these countries however, Hansen’s Disease is still a rare occurrence. In fact, some 95% of people worldwide already have a natural immunity to Hansen’s Disease, rendering it a very rare condition regardless of location.\n\nSymptoms\n\nHansen’s Disease can cause a variety of symptoms throughout the body, however the most common presentations are found in the skin and the nervous system.\n\nCommon skin symptoms include:\n\nDiscoloration of the skin, typically in small patches that may or may not be numb or inflamed\n\nAbnormal skin growths\n\nThick, dry patches of skin\n\nUlcers on the soles of feet\n\nSwelling in the face and earlobes\n\nLoss of eyebrows or eyelashes\n\nBurning sensation in the skin\n\nCommon symptoms related to nerve damage include:\n\nNumbness in affected areas\n\nMuscle weakness and eventual paralysis\n\nEnlarged/swollen nerves\n\nUlcers in the eyes and/or blindness, if facial nerves are affected\n\nLoss of sense of pain – often leading to unnoticed injuries in affected areas\n\nOther common symptoms include:\n\nNasal inflammation\n\nNosebleeds\n\nSymptoms of advanced, untreated Hansen’s Disease include:\n\nParalysis of hands and feet\n\nShortening/loss of fingers and toes\n\nChronic, non-healing ulcers on the soles of feet\n\nBlindness\n\nSaddle Nose disfigurement\n\nHansen’s Disease develops very slowly – it can take up to 20 years to develop even minor symptoms. This is because M. leprae reproduces distinctly slowly for an infectious bacterium.\n\nIt is imperative to seek treatment as soon as possible after symptoms develop. Hansen’s Disease can be treated and cured relatively painlessly, however symptoms cannot be reversed once they appear.\n\nTesting/Diagnosis\n\nIf you develop any of the above symptoms, speak to a doctor immediately. The most common symptom to watch for is patches of discolored skin that have lost sense of touch and/or pain.\n\nOnce in contact with a doctor, they will take samples of affected skin or nerves to perform confirmatory tests. These typically involve looking at the sample under a microscope for M. Leprae bacteria or sending the samples to be lab tested for other potential diseases.\n\nTreatment\n\nOnce in contact with a doctor, they will take samples of affected skin or nerves to perform confirmatory tests. These typically involve looking at the sample under a microscope for M. Leprae bacteria or sending the samples to be lab tested for other potential diseases.\n\nDuring treatment:\n\nTake particular care of areas affected by a loss of sensation; it is very common for people with Hansen’s Disease to experience cuts and burns without even noticing. These injuries can easily become infected or become severe if they aren’t noticed.\n\nTake the full course of medication as directed by your doctor. Stopping early can result in redevelopment of the illness, emergence of new symptoms, and the development of antibiotic resistance, making the disease harder or even impossible to treat in the future.\n\nWatch for swollen/inflamed and painful skin patches and nerves and development of a fever, as these can be indications of an adverse reaction to treatment that will require changes and/or additions to treatment medication.\n\nThe locations of specialized Hansen’s Disease treatment clinics around the country can be found in the other resources section below.

It is commonly called the “brain-eating ameba” because it can cause a brain infection when water containing the ameba goes up the nose. Only about three people in the United States get infected yearly, but these infections are usually fatal.\n\nYou cannot get infected from drinking water contaminated with Naegleria. You can only be infected when contaminated water goes up into your nose.\n\nSymptoms usually start with severe headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting and progress to stiff neck, seizures, altered mental status, hallucinations, and coma.\n\nNaegleria fowleri infects people when water containing the ameba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers. The ameba then travels up the nose to the brain, where it destroys the brain tissue and causes a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is almost always fatal.\n\nNaegleria fowleri infections may also happen when people use contaminated tap water to rinse their sinuses by sending water up the nose. In very rare instances, people have gotten Naegleria fowleri infections from recreational water that didn’t have enough chlorine in it, such as pools, splash pads, or surf parks. There is no evidence that Naegleria fowleri can spread through water vapor or aerosol droplets (such as shower mist or vapor from a humidifier).\n\nRecommended preventative steps include:\n\nAvoid jumping or diving into bodies of warm fresh water, especially during the summer.\n\nHold your nose shut, use nose clips, or keep your head above water when in bodies of warm fresh water.\n\nAvoid putting your head under water in hot springs and other untreated geothermal waters.\n\nAvoid digging in, or stirring up, the sediment in shallow, warm fresh water. The amoebae are more likely to live in sediment at the bottom of lakes, ponds, and rivers.\n\nResources:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSources of Infection and Risk Factors\n\nOther Uniformed Service Members, Veterans, and their Spouses\n\nThe Arkansas Act creates two licensing pathways for veterans and their spouses, automatic or expedited.\n\nWho does it apply to?\n\nThe Arkansas law applies to:\n\nUniformed Service Members that the SCRA does not cover.\n\nUniformed Service Veteran who resides in or establish residency in Arkansas.\n\nThe spouse of a Uniformed Service Member that the SCRA does not cover.\n\nThe spouse of a Uniformed Service Veteran who resides in or establish residency in Arkansas.\n\nThe spouse of a Uniformed Service Member who is assigned a tour of duty that excludes the uniformed service member's spouse from accompanying the uniformed service member and the spouse relocates to this state;\n\nA uniformed service member who is killed or succumbs to his or her injuries or illness in the line of duty if the spouse establishes residency in the state.\n\nAutomatic Licensure:\n\nCertain licensing entities provide automatic licensure under state law. The individual must contact one of the listed licensing functions and:\n\nthe individual is a holder in good standing of occupational licensure with similar scope of practice issued by another state, territory, or district of the United States; and\n\nthe individual pays the applicable licensure fee.\n\nQuick Links:\n\nNursing Board\n\nBoard of Optometry\n\nMedical Board\n\nPhysical Therapy Board\n\nBoard of Dental Examiners\n\nPharmacy Board\n\nBoard of Dental Examiners\n\nAthletic Training Board\n\nAcupuncture & Related Techniques Board\n\nBoard of Examiners in Counseling/MFT\n\nBoard of Podiatric Medicine\n\nDietetics Licensing Board\n\nPsychology Board\n\nBoard of Examiners in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology\n\nBoard of Examiners of Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Counselors\n\nBoard of Dispensing Opticians\n\nBoard of Chiropractic Examiners\n\nSocial Work Licensing Board\n\nBoard of Hearing Instrument Dispensers\n\nMassage Therapy\n\nCosmetology and Body Art\n\nRadiologic Tech\n\nLay Midwife\n\nDrinking Water Operator\n\nSanitarians\n\nPlumbers\n\nOrthotist, Prosthetists, and Pedorthists\n\nLead-Based Paint\n\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS)\n\nExpedited Licensure:\n\nArkansas law does allow licensing entities to submit rules for an expedited process versus an automatic process.

For a license to be considered valid in a new location, a servicemember or their spouse must satisfy the following five criteria:\n\nHave moved to a location outside the jurisdiction of the licensing authority that issued the covered license or certificate because of orders for military service;\n\nProvide a copy of the military orders to the licensing authority in the new jurisdiction;\n\nHave actively used the license or certificate during the two years immediately preceding the move;\n\nRemain in good standing with:\n\nthe licensing authority that issued the covered license or certificate; and\n\nevery other licensing authority that issued a license or certificate valid for a similar scope of practice and in the discipline applied for in the new jurisdiction; and\n\nSubmit to the authority of the licensing authority in the new jurisdiction for the purposes of standards of practice, discipline, and fulfillment of any continuing education requirements.\n\nActive-duty members and their spouses should use the links below to find contact information for the appropriate licensing entity.\n\nQuick Links:\n\nNursing Board\n\nBoard of Optometry\n\nMedical Board\n\nPhysical Therapy Board\n\nBoard of Dental Examiners\n\nPharmacy Board\n\nBoard of Dental Examiners\n\nAthletic Training Board\n\nAcupuncture & Related Techniques Board\n\nBoard of Examiners in Counseling/MFT\n\nBoard of Podiatric Medicine\n\nDietetics Licensing Board\n\nPsychology Board\n\nBoard of Examiners in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology\n\nBoard of Examiners of Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Counselors\n\nBoard of Dispensing Opticians\n\nBoard of Chiropractic Examiners\n\nSocial Work Licensing Board\n\nBoard of Hearing Instrument Dispensers\n\nMassage Therapy\n\nCosmetology and Body Art\n\nRadiologic Tech\n\nLay Midwife\n\nDrinking Water Operator\n\nSanitarians\n\nPlumbers\n\nOrthotist, Prosthetists, and Pedorthists\n\nLead-Based Paint\n\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS)\n\nLicensure Reciprocity for Active Duty, Veterans, and Spouses\n\nTwo laws apply to the occupational licensure of current and former military members and their spouses, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and the Arkansas Occupational Licensing of Uniformed Service Members, Veterans, and Spouses Act of 2021. For active duty and their spouses, the federal law is controlling but because it does not extend to veterans and their spouses, the state law controls requirements for those individuals.\n\nQuick Links\n\nActive-Duty Military and their Spouses:\n\nOn January 5, 2023, the SCRA was amended to provide a way for those who have a PCS to move to carry their license with them to their new duty station. This reduces the burdens associated with interstate military moves and allows military spouses to obtain meaningful employment more quickly.\n\nOther Uniformed Service Members, Veterans, and their Spouses:\n\nThe act is intended to help uniformed service member, veterans, and their spouses by removing barriers that impede the launch and sustainability of civilian occupational careers and employment faced by uniformed service members, uniformed service veterans, and their spouses. Under the Act “Uniformed Service Members” include those also covered under the SCRA. “Uniformed Service Veterans” are defined as former members of the United States uniformed services discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.\n\nBody Art Forms\n\nAct 990 Prelicensure Petition\n\nArtist Instructor\n\nBody Art Relocation\n\nCertification of Record\n\nEvent Sponsor – Temporary Demonstration License\n\nExamination & Initial Licensure Application\n\nNew Establishment Form\n\nNew Institution Form\n\nReciprocity Requirements\n\nReinstatement Form\n\nRetake Examination Application\n\nStudent Artist Application\n\nTemporary Demonstration License – Arkansas Guest Artist\n\nTemporary Demonstration License – Out of State Guest Artist\n\nMedical Ionizing Radiation Licensure Committee (MIRLC)\n\nInterested applicants may fill out the Online Application for Appointment for consideration.\n\nThe Medical Ionizing Radiation Licensure Committee shall be an advisory committee to the State Board of Health and shall consist of ten (10) members, as follows: Nine (9) members to be appointed by the Governor; and One (1) member shall be the Secretary of the Department of Health or his or her designee.\n\nAmong the committee members shall be:\n\ntwo (2) radiologic technologists\n\none (1) nuclear medicine technologist\n\none (1) radiation therapist\n\ntwo (2) radiation practitioners\n\none (1) licensed practitioner\n\none (1) radiation health/medical physicist\n\none (1) consumer\n\nThe members shall be appointed for three-year staggered terms to be assigned by lot.

The vaccine also prevents most genital warts and cervical precancers. Gardasil 9, which protects against 9 HPV types, is the only HPV vaccine currently in use in the United States.\n\nWhat Cancers Does HPV Cause?\n\nHPV can cause oropharyngeal (back of mouth and throat), cervical, penile, anal, and vulvar cancers. HPV is estimated to cause nearly 36,500 cases of cancer in men and women every year in the United States. HPV vaccination can prevent 33,700 of these cancers by preventing the infections that cause them.\n\nWho Should Get HPV Vaccine? When Should They Get It?\n\nAll children age 9-12 years, both boys and girls, should get two doses of HPV Vaccine, given 6-12 months apart.\n\nEarly protection works best. That’s why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later, since it protects children best when given before they ever have contact with the virus.\n\nTeens and young adults should be vaccinated too. Everyone through age 26 years should get HPV vaccine if they were not fully vaccinated already.\n\nSome adults age 27 through 45 years who were not already vaccinated might choose to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination for them.\n\nHow Well Do These Vaccines Work?\n\nHPV vaccination works extremely well.\n\nSince HPV vaccination was first recommended in 2006, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women.\n\nFewer teens and young adults are getting genital warts.\n\nHPV vaccination has also reduced the number of cases of precancers of the cervix in young women.\n\nThe protection provided by HPV vaccines lasts a long time. People who received HPV vaccines were followed for at least about 12 years, and their protection against HPV has remained high with no evidence of decreasing over time.\n\nIs the HPV Vaccine Safe?\n\nHPV Vaccine is very safe. Over 15 years of monitoring have shown that HPV Vaccines are very safe and effective. Like all vaccines, scientists continue to monitor vaccines to ensure they are safe and effective.\n\nWhere Can I Find These Vaccines?\n\nHPV Vaccine is available in many doctor's offices and clinics, especially those that take care of children and young adults. Many pharmacies also vaccinate children and adults for HPV. In addition, all of ADH’s Local Health Units (LHUs) give HPV vaccinations to all children and some adults.\n\nHow Do I Pay for These Vaccines?\n\nMost health insurance plans cover routine vaccinations like HPV vaccine. The Vaccines For Children (VFC) program also provides vaccines for children 18 years and younger who are uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid-eligible, American Indian, or Alaska Native. In AR many clinics that care for children, as well as some pharmacies, are VFC providers. In addition, all of ADH’s Local Health Units (LHUs) are VFC providers.\n\nResources:\n\nHPV Vaccination: What Everyone Should Know\n\nHPV Info for Parents\n\nHPV Prevention\n\nWhat is HPV?\n\nHPV or Human Papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD). HPV is a different virus than HIV and HSV (herpes). HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get it at some point in their lives. There are many different types of HPV. Some types can cause health problems including genital warts and cancers. But there are vaccines that can stop these health problems from happening.\n\nSigns and Symptoms\n\nMost people have no symptoms\n\nDevelop within weeks or months after exposure, or not at all\n\nSoft fleshy lumps on or near genitals or anus\n\nItching or burning around genitals\n\nWarts may be hidden in the vagina or anus\n\nThe warts may go away with treatment, but the HPV infection can persist\n\nIn 90% of cases, HPV disappears spontaneously within 2 years after infection\n\nTransmission\n\nGenital Warts are spread by:\n\nVaginal sex\n\nOral sex (rare)\n\nAnal sex\n\nContact with infected person’s warts\n\nInfected mother to newborn (very rare)\n\nWarts/HPV may be spread even if no warts are visible because the virus may be present on areas not protected by a condom\n\nComplications\n\nIf left untreated, Genital Warts can:\n\nSpread to sex partners\n\nBe passed to newborn during childbirth; can cause warts in infant’s throat (very rare)\n\nSome virus strains lead to abnormal Pap tests and increased risk of cervical cancer, but these strains do not cause visible warts. Sexually active women should have yearly Pap tests starting 3 years after they first had sex. HPV may also play a role in cancers of the anus, mouth/throat, penis, and vagina.\n\nA physician may perform a special test to identify the cancer-associated strains.\n\nPrevention​\n\nGardasil-9 is the vaccine available for males and females age 9-26 years of age to protect against the types of HPV that cause most cases of cancer and genital warts.\n\nHPV vaccination is also recommended for some people age 27-45 years of age if they are not already vaccinated. People in this age range should speak to their doctor about the benefits of HPV vaccine for them.\n\nThe surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases is to abstain from sexual contact or to be in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected.\n\nLatex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of transmission only when the infected areas are covered or protected by the condom.\n\nUse a new latex condom properly for any sexual contact.\n\nLimit the number of sex partners.\n\nTesting and Treatment\n\nGet an exam from a medical provider if infection is suspected.\n\nWarts can be treated, but HPV cannot be cured.\n\nHPV requires medical treatment by doctor.\n\nDrugstore treatment for other kinds of warts may be harmful if used on genital warts.\n\n“High risk” HPV strains that cause cancer do not cause visible genital warts. But, high-risk strains may be present along with visible warts.\n\nThe body may eventually clear the virus with or without treatment.\n\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine:CDC\n\nThe HPV vaccine that is licensed by the FDA, recommended by CDC and currently distributed in the USA is Gardasil-9 (made by Merck).\n\nInfection Preventionist (IP)/ICAR\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health would like to introduce a free, confidential, and non-regulatory resource for your team.

Within fifteen (15) days of the report and identification of a spinal cord-disabled person, the commission shall notify the spinal cord-disabled person or the most immediate family members of their right to assistance from the state, the services available, and the eligibility requirements.\n\nIf a healthcare professional, individual with a spinal cord disability or another interested individual identifies someone with a spinal cord disability, contact the Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission to make a referral. It is better to refer someone who is not eligible than not to refer someone who is eligible for services.\n\nTo make a referral, contact the regional Case Management office or call the ASCC administrative office at 501-296-1788 or 800-459-1517 between 8am and 4:30pm. Monday - Friday. Confidential fax is available 24 hours a day at 501-296-1787. You can find the ASCC Referral Form here.\n\nClick here for more Referral Information.\n\nDamage to the Spinal Cord\n\nSpinal cord disabilities result from damage to the spinal cord. ASCC serves only Arkansans whose spinal cord has been damaged. This damage may result from a traumatic spinal cord injury, from a birth defect such as spina bifida or sacral agenesis, or a disease process of the spinal cord including spinal cord tumors, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or spinal stenosis. This list of diagnoses is not exhaustive and if a health care provider or individual has an individual whom they believe may qualify for services, that individual should be referred and an ASCC Case Manager will be assigned to collect medical records and information to determine the spinal cord disability. Individuals with disabilities of the spinal column that do not affect the spinal cord, the brain or brain stem (only without cord involvement) or the peripheral nerves typically do not qualify for ASCC services.\n\nMedical Criteria\n\nOnce an individual is determined to have a spinal cord disability, the ASCC Medical criteria are applied. The medical criteria assess the actually disability or limitations in function resulting from the spinal cord damage. For the purpose of determining disability, the four criteria listed below are used. An individual must have at least three of the following symptoms. Medical records or information will be used to verify these criteria:\n\nLack of Normal Motor Control / Paralysis - A lack of normal voluntary motor function. There should be enough weakness and/or spasticity to significantly interfere with normal self-care activities and/or mobility. In most cases, this will require the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, braces (including AFOs, KAFOS), crutches, or cane for mobility. In some cases, particularly those with a diagnosis of central cord syndrome, the paralysis may be more severe in the arms and hands than in the legs to the point that adaptive devices or assistance is required for completing activities of daily living such as feeding, dressing, and hygiene.\n\nLack of Normal Sensation - A lack of normal sensation at or below the level of lesion that results in absent or impaired ability to discern touch, pressure, pain (the ability to tell sharp from dull), or temperature (the ability to tell hot from cold). The individual should have enough loss of sensation to have more than normal risk to the skin and musculoskeletal structures.\n\nLoss of Normal Bladder Control - The lack of ability to voluntarily empty the bladder in a timely manner without accidents or the use of equipment or medication. Frequently, individuals with spinal cord injury will present with a neurogenic bladder. When this condition is present, it is usually obvious with symptoms of either urinary incontinence (involuntary voiding) or urinary retention (inability to void). However, with minimal spinal cord damage, the symptoms may be subtler.\n\nLoss of Normal Bowel Control - The lack of ability to voluntarily empty the bowel in a timely manner without accidents or use of equipment or medication. Frequently, individuals with damage to the spinal cord will present with a neurogenic bowel.\n\nFor additional information regarding the ASCC Medical Criteria, please see the Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission Policies and Procedures Manual policy CS-3 – Medical Eligibility Criteria.\n\nFinancial Criteria\n\nThe Arkansas Spinal Cord Commission and our Case Managers provide numerous services to individuals who have met the medical criteria, including life-long case management, counseling, guidance, advocacy, resource identification, referral for other services, technical assistance, and other services without regard to income.\n\nWhen an individual needs purchased services or financial assistance in obtaining equipment or services related specifically to the spinal cord disability, the individual must also meet financial criteria.\n\nIn order for ASCC to assist a client with purchased services:\n\nThe individual must complete a Financial Resource Assessment with the Case Manager that includes information about earned and unearned income, savings, assets, and spinal cord disability-related expenses.\n\nThere must be no other resource (insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, personal savings, etc) available to assist with the purchase. An ASCC Financial Eligibility Assessment has been completed no more than 1 year from the date of purchase.\n\nThe expenditure or service must be related to the spinal cord disability and a covered service under ASCC procedures. The Commission has specific guidelines and limits on some services.ASCC follows Arkansas State Procurement laws in all purchasing.\n\nASCC does not make purchases related to normal living requirements including but not limited to; housing, utilities, food, clothing, vehicles, or medical insurance payments. The Commission is precluded from making any van modifications.\n\nThe Commission is precluded from making any payment for any hospitalization.\n\nFor additional information regarding the ASCC Financial Criteria please see ASCC Case Management Procedures Manual, Chapter 5, Determining Financial Eligibility\n\nFor additional information regarding the procedures and array of services purchased by ASCC, please see ASCC Case Management Procedures Manual, Chapter 10, and Purchasing Services for your Client.\n\nPlease note, the ASCC budget for purchased services is small and the agency may not be able to make purchases to meet all of the client’s needs due to these budgetary constraints.\n\nArkansas Volunteer Health Care Act\n\nThe purpose of the Arkansas Volunteer Health Care Act is:\n\nTo ensure compliance with Ark.

Humans that get avian influenza usually have come in direct contact with infected birds, birds that have died from avian influenza, or bird droppings from infected birds. \"Bird flu\" viruses have been found in many other species of animals, including mammals on land and in the water. These viruses can have a variety of presenting symptoms in these different species, and can cause mild to severe illness, even death in certain circumstances.\n\nThere are two categories of influenza A viruses in birds: highly pathogenic and low pathogenic, which refers to their ability to cause very mild to very severe illness in birds, specifically poultry (chickens). These bird flu virus strains typically infect waterfowl, such as ducks, and rarely infected domestic birds, including chickens, in the past. However, since February 2022, the United States has been experiencing an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) strain in both domestic and wild birds, making this the largest animal health event to ever affect the U.S. Additionally, since March 2024, this virus has been detected in dairy cattle in several states, which exposed and even infected a small number of dairy farm workers, all of whom experienced mild symptoms and have since recovered.\n\nFor more information about “bird flu” in humans, please visit the CDC website.\n\nIt is important to remember that HPAI is primarily a production and economic concern for our poultry industry. It is safe to consume properly handled and cooked poultry products, including meat and eggs.\n\nCurrent US Situation as of July 17, 2024\n\nThere is ongoing surveillance throughout the US and the world to look for \"bird flu\" in migratory waterfowl. In the US, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Department of the Interior, and the US Department of Health and Human Services work together on this surveillance. More information on surveillance and positive results in domestic and wild animals can be found on the USDA website.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health works closely with other state partners, including the Arkansas Department of Agriculture and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, on all animal and human-related public health concerns.\n\nOther Resources\n\nArkansas Department of Agriculture information on Avian Influenza\n\nUniversity of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service information on Avian Influenza\n\nCDC information on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)\n\nUSDA APHIS information on Avian Influenza\n\nArkansas Game and Fish Commission information on Avian Influenza\n\nPoultry owners should monitor their flocks and report any possible symptoms to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture at 501-823-1746. For wild birds, please use the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission online tool to report sick or dead birds.\n\nArkansas Department of Health Avian Influenza Prevention Measures and Post-Exposure Monitoring Instructions\n\nWhat is avian influenza (bird flu)?\n\nAvian influenza, also called bird flu, is caused by a virus that infects birds such as chickens, turkeys, geese, pigeons, and pheasants. The virus is found in an infected bird’s poop as well as fluids from the bird’s eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nBird flu doesn’t usually infect people, however, there are a few ways you can get infected. A person can be infected with bird flu if they:\n\nTouch their eyes, nose or mouth after working with infected live or dead birds.\n\nTouch their eyes, nose, or mouth after visiting places where infected birds have lived.\n\nBreathe in droplets or dust contaminated with the virus.\n\nHave close contact with a person already sick with the disease, though this is rare.\n\nSymptoms of bird flu range from mild eye infections to a flu-like illness. In severe cases, bird flu can cause pneumonia and death.\n\nWho can get bird flu?\n\nMost humans are unlikely to get bird flu. Individuals who work with animals, such as veterinarians, farmers, animal industry experts, and wildlife professionals, or people who visit poultry farms or live-animal markets may be more likely to get infected.\n\nWhat can people do to prevent bird flu?\n\nThere is no vaccine to prevent bird flu, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\nAvoid touching birds and visiting places where birds live\n\nDo not touch birds whether they are alive or dead.\n\nAvoid visiting live bird and poultry markets.\n\nAvoid Germs\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nIf soap and water aren’t available, clean hands with hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.\n\nDon’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.\n\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\nTry to avoid close contact, such as kissing, hugging or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who are sick.\n\nIf you feel sick and think you may have bird flu, particularly if you have a fever, talk to a healthcare provider and tell them about any contact with birds. Stay away from other people while are sick.\n\nPreparing Food\n\nThe Arkansas poultry industry maintains rigorous health and safety standards, including routine monitoring for avian influenza. It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry; there is no concern of avian influenza risk in processed poultry products.\n\nAlways properly handle and cook poultry products:\n\nClean: Wash hands and surfaces often.\n\nSeparate: Separate raw meats and poultry from other foods.\n\nCook: Cook all poultry to 165°F.\n\nChill: Refrigerate promptly.\n\nFor more information, click here\n\nAMPOQRC Resources\n\nReports:\n\nMaternal and Perinatal Outcomes Quality Review Committee Annual Report: 2023 | 2021\n\nState Resources:\n\nArkansas Department of Health Maternity Program\n\nArkansas Department of Health WIC Program\n\nArkansas Maternal Mortality Review Committee\n\nUAMS Institute for Digital Health & Innovation High-Risk Pregnancy Program formerly called “ANGELS”\n\nArkansas Department of Human Services –Division of Children and Family Services\n\nNational Resources:\n\nCDC Maternal and Health\n\nHEAR HER Campaign | CDC\n\nCDC LOCATe\n\nNational Organizations:\n\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (APP)\n\nAmerican Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)\n\nAssociation of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP)\n\nAssociation of Women’s Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses (AWOHN)\n\nCityMATCH\n\nArkansas Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes Quality Review Committee\n\nThe Arkansas Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes Quality Review Committee started with Act 1032 of 92nd General Assembly Regular Session, 2019.

The rash may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face\n\nTransmission\n\nMpox is spread through close contact and can be transmitted to anyone regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity. It can be spread by direct skin-to-skin contact with infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids. This can include household and/or intimate contact. Spreading can also occur when contacting contaminated items, such as clothing. It may be transmitted through contact with respiratory secretions; however, it is not an airborne illness.\n\nMpox is NOT spread through casual, brief conversations or walking by someone with Mpox, like at a grocery store.\n\nPrevention\n\nTesting\n\nContact a healthcare provider right away to talk about diagnosis, testing, and treatment options. If you do not have a health care provider, please contact the ADH call center at 1-800-803-7847 to locate a local health unit near you.\n\nTreatment\n\nAntiviral drugs are also available for the treatment of the illness. Although most cases are self-limiting without treatment, you might need treatment if you have severe disease, are immunocompromised, have a history of atopic dermatitis or other active exfoliative skin conditions, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or have a concurrent disease or other comorbidities. Decisions about treatment should always be discussed with your medical provider. Treatment can also be used when lesions develop in the eyes, mouth, or other anatomical areas where Mpox virus infection might constitute a special hazard (e.g., the genitals or anus).\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment explicitly approved for Mpox virus infections. However, antivirals developed for use in patients with smallpox may prove beneficial against Mpox. TPOXX is an antiviral medication being used as an investigational treatment. If your medical provider feels this would benefit you, please contact ADH at 1-800-803-7847.\n\nVaccines\n\nThere are vaccines available for people who meet the criteria. It is recommended that you talk with your healthcare provider before being vaccinated. The preferred vaccine to protect against Mpox is Jynneos, which is a two-dose vaccine. It takes 14 days after getting the second dose of Jynneos for its immune protection to reach its maximum. The vaccine is not effective once symptoms have started.\n\nVaccine Location Map\n\nFor Providers\n\nTesting is currently available through several large commercial laboratories, including LabCorp, Quest, Aegis, Sonic Healthcare, and Mayo Labs. For providers planning to test through a commercial lab, there is no need to contact ADH prior to testing. For providers needing to test through ADH’s Glen F. Baker Public Health Lab, call ADH’s Outbreak Response Section first at 501-537-8969.\n\nSpecimen receiving is M-F 8am to 7:30pm at PHL.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) defines violent death as a death that “results from the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or a group or community.” The Arkansas Violent Death Reporting System (ARVDRS) collects and links key details of violent deaths- the “who, when, where, and how” – and delivers insights into “why” these deaths transpired.\n\nArkansas received grant funding from the CDC in 2018 to create the ARVDRS. ARVDRS pulls data from law enforcement reports, death certificates, and coroner/medical examiner reports (including toxicology) and logs this data into a de-identified database. These sources individually provide data that explain violence in a fragmented, narrow context, but when linked together, a more comprehensive picture of violent death is created. The purpose of utilizing the ARVDRS is to implement a plan to collect and disseminate accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data on all violent deaths occurring within the state to better guide prevention efforts.\n\nARVDRS includes deaths that result from:\n\nHomicides\n\nSuicides\n\nDeaths of undetermined intent\n\nUnintentional firearm injury deaths\n\nDeaths due to legal intervention\n\nResources:\n\nNational Violent Death Reporting System\n\nNVDRS and Law Enforcement\n\nNVDRS and Coroner/Medical Examiner Partners\n\nNVDRS and Vital Statistics Registrars\n\nVeto Violence\n\nSUDORS (State Unintentional Death Reporting System)\n\nThe State Unintentional Drug Overdose Surveillance (SUDORS) is a supplemental program to the NVDRS which is funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Overdose Data to Action grant. SUDORS collects detailed information on all fatal overdose deaths in Arkansas.\n\nSUDORS increases the timeliness and comprehensiveness of reporting fatal drug overdoses by capturing information from death certificates, coroner and medical examiner reports, and toxicology reports. These sources include details such as route of administration and risk factors that may be associated with a fatal overdose. The data collected can be analyzed to provide stakeholders with information on overdose prevention response efforts.\n\nOther Resources:\n\nSAMHSA’s National Helpline: A free, confidential, 24-hour-a-day, 365-a-year, referral helpline.

A substance can be defined as anything that you put into your body that alters how your brain functions. The misuse of substances regularly can alter the way the brain functions. Commonly misused substances include:\n\nAlcohol\n\nOpioids (Heroin, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone)\n\nBenzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam)\n\nOver-the-counter cold or cough medicines\n\nMarijuana (synthetic marijuana)\n\nIllicit substances (Amphetamines, methamphetamine, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, and other stimulants)\n\nSubstance Misuse Education and Prevention\n\nSubstance misuse is a serious public health issue in Arkansas. According to provisional data from the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) Vital Statistics, in 2021, there were 628 drug overdose deaths in Arkansas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 841,000 people have died in the United States since 1999 from a drug overdose. The Substance Misuse Education and Prevention Section at the Arkansas Department of Health was established in the fall of 2017 to help address the opioid epidemic and substance misuse. This section is funded through grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n\nReports\n\nSubstance Misuse Data Dashboards\n\n2023\n\nFatal Overdose\n\nNonfatal Overdose\n\nEMS Naloxone Administrations\n\n2022:\n\nFatal Overdose\n\nNonfatal Overdose\n\nEMS Naloxone Administrations\n\nEducation and Prevention Programs\n\nDose of Reality | PDF\n\nPeer Recovery Support Specialists\n\nNaloxone Training/Distribution\n\nHealthcare Provider Education\n\nResources\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Drug Overdose\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\n\nArkansas Poison Center\n\nAR Rx Take Back\n\nStartYourRecovery.org\n\nSubstance Abuse Prevention - Arkansas Department of Human Services\n\nNational Rehab Hotline\n\nAddictions.com\n\nA Free Addiction Resource to Help Those Suffering with Addiction\n\nFind Free and Affordable Rehab Centers\n\nGet Clean.

It is caused by a new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and trouble breathing. COVID-19 may also cause stomach problems, such as nausea and diarrhea, and a loss of your sense of smell or taste. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after you are exposed to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.\n\nHow does COVID-19 affect pregnant and recently pregnant women?\n\nReports and research show that pregnant and recently pregnant women have a higher risk of more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women. Reports note that:\n\nPregnant women who have COVID-19 and show symptoms are more likely than nonpregnant women with COVID-19 and symptoms to need care in an intensive care unit (ICU), to need a ventilator (for breathing support), or to die from the illness. Still, the overall risk of severe illness and death for pregnant women is low.\n\nPregnant and recently pregnant women with some health conditions, such as obesity and gestational diabetes, may have an even higher risk of severe illness, similar to nonpregnant women with these conditions.\n\nPregnant women who are Black or Hispanic have a higher rate of illness and death from COVID-19 than other pregnant women, but not because of biology. Black and Hispanic women are more likely to face social, health, and economic inequities that put them at greater risk of illness. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to learn more about these inequities.\n\nReports also note the following for pregnant women with COVID-19:\n\nThey may be more likely to have pregnancy complications than pregnant women without COVID-19. These complications may be related to high blood pressure, heavy postpartum bleeding, and other infections. This is especially true for pregnant women with moderate and severe illnesses.\n\nThey may have an increased risk of preeclampsia (a serious blood pressure disorder) and coagulopathy (a blood clotting disorder).\n\nHow can COVID-19 affect a fetus or newborn?\n\nReports of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have shown the following:\n\nThere is an increased risk of preterm birth.\n\nSome data suggest a possible increased risk of stillbirth.\n\nCOVID-19 may pass to the fetus during pregnancy, but this seems to be rare.\n\nAfter birth, reports have shown the following:\n\nIn babies born to women who had COVID-19 during pregnancy, there is an increased risk that the newborn will need care in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nA newborn can get the virus if they are exposed to it.\n\nShould I get the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nYes, you should get a COVID-19 vaccine. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) strongly recommends vaccination if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to get pregnant. Read COVID-19 Vaccines: Answers From Ob-Gyns to learn more, and talk with your obstetrician-gynecologist (ob-gyn) if you have questions.\n\nKey points to remember:\n\nPregnant and postpartum women have a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19 than nonpregnant women.\n\nStay healthy by getting a COVID-19 vaccine, following guidelines from health officials, and keeping your prenatal and postpartum care visits.\n\nIf you are pregnant and have COVID-19, talk with your ob-gyn.\n\nGet a booster shot as soon as you are eligible to get one.\n\nResources for the Community\n\nFrequently asked questions and answers to COVID-19 Vaccine and Pregnancy\n\nCOVID-19, Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Breastfeeding: Answers from OB-GYNS\n\nCOVID-19, Gynecologist Visit, and Telehealth: Answers from OB-GYNS\n\nPregnant and Recently Pregnant Women At Increased Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19\n\nPossible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nMyths and Facts about the COVID-19 Vaccine\n\nToolkit for Pregnant Women and New Parents\n\nKeep Your Baby Healthy and Safe Take These Steps During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nPregnant or Just Had a Baby?

It is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss and possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to the environment.\n\nAlzheimer’s is a specific disease. Dementia is not.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases.\n\nThough the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer’s is increasing age, the disease is not a normal part of aging.\n\nAlthough most people with Alzheimer’s are 65 and older, approximately 200,000 Americans under 65 are living with younger-onset Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nRelated Dementias\n\nDementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life.\n\nDementia describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory, reasoning, or other thinking skill.\n\nDementia is not a normal part of aging • Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia, but there are many kinds:\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob Disease\n\nLewy Body Dementia\n\nDown Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease\n\nFrontotemporal Dementia\n\nHuntington's Disease\n\nMixed Dementia\n\nNormal Pressure\n\nHydrocephalus\n\nPosterior Cortical Atrophy\n\nParkinson's Disease Dementia\n\nVascular Dementia\n\nKorsakoff Syndrome\n\nAlzheimer’s in Arkansas\n\nOne out of three seniors who die annually is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or another dementia.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease was the 4th leading cause of death among Arkansans aged 65 years and older compared to the national rank as the 5th leading cause of death in 2018.\n\nArkansas ranked 23rd among states for Alzheimer’s disease mortality in 2013, however, moved up to 13th in 2018, indicating more Arkansans aged 65 years and older are succumbing to Alzheimer’s disease over time.\n\nTake Brain Health to Heart\n\nWhat’s good for your heart and blood vessels is also good for your brain. Recent studies have shown that risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as physical inactivity and obesity, also contribute to conditions such as memory loss, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and reduced cognitive ability. Older adults with Alzheimer’s and other dementias are more likely than other older adults to have multiple chronic conditions, and Alzheimer’s complicates the management of these conditions, resulting in increased hospitalizations and costs. The good news is that there are steps you can take that will help your heart and your brain.\n\n10 Ways to Help Improve Your Brain Health\n\nDon’t Use Tobacco\n\nBe Physically Active\n\nEat a Healthy Diet\n\nMaintain a Healthy Weight\n\nGet Enough Sleep\n\nStay Engaged\n\nPrevent and Manage High Blood Pressure\n\nPrevent and Manage High Cholesterol\n\nManage Blood Sugar\n\nIf You Drink, Do So in Moderation\n\nAlthough age, genetics, and family history cannot be changed, other risk factors can be changed or modified to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In fact, the 2020 recommendations of The Lancet Commission on Dementia prevention, intervention and care suggest that addressing modifiable risk factors might prevent or delay up to 40% of dementia cases\n\nThe Importance of Caregivers\n\nAbout one in three Alzheimer’s caregivers report their health has gotten worse due to care responsibilities.\n\nIncreased risk of stress, depression, unhealthy behaviors, and poor attention to their own health.\n\nCaregivers of people with dementia with diabetes or osteoporosis were 2.6 and 2.3 times more likely, respectively, to report emotional difficulties with care compared with caregivers of people with dementia who did not have these co-occurring conditions.\n\nWhat are we doing at the Arkansas Department of Health?\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Health is an awarded recipient of the CDC Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, Public Law 115-406, for Public Health Programs to Address Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (CDC-RFA-20-2004). BOLD funding is being used to:\n\nIncrease the number of stakeholders engaged in state-wide AADRD collaboration.\n\nPromote education about the importance of risk reduction (primary prevention), early diagnosis (secondary prevention), prevention and management of comorbidities, avoidable hospitalizations (tertiary prevention), and the role of the caregiver.\n\nIncrease healthcare professional education about the importance of all three levels of prevention, and the importance of caregivers as a vital part of the healthcare team.\n\nIncrease the number and types of health communications with the integration of brain health and dementia risk.\n\nRules\n\nAct 391\n\nResources:\n\nWhat are Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias?\n\nProviders in Arkansas\n\nCommunity Resource Manual\n\nAlzheimer’s Association\n\nCDC-Healthy Brain Resource Center\n\nArkansas State Plan 2021-2025\n\nAARP-Family Caring\n\nUAMS- Center on Aging\n\nAlzheimer’s Arkansas\n\nContact:\n\nJarriel Moore, BA, CBT, CHC\n\nBOLD Program Manager\n\n501-682-6990\n\nCoordinated School Health\n\n**The Coordinated School Health program received funding from the CDC titled (CDC)RFA-DP-23-0002 School-Based Interventions to Promote Equity and Improve Health, Academic Achievement, and Well-Being of Students. The Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, in partnership with the Arkansas Department of Health, are committed to bringing you school health content experts to implement health strategies that benefit students, school staff, and the community. We will continue to host quarterly CSH meetings with topics surrounding the WSCC Model and share relevant resources and funding opportunities as they arise.\n\nOur second quarterly meeting of the 2023-24 school year will be held virtually on Wednesday, November 1, 2023, at 8:30am. You can register in advance for this meeting here. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.\n\nArkansas has emerged as a leader in Coordinated School Health programs. Across the state, Coordinated School Health is growing, and districts are building school-level health teams. With the help of ACT 1220 of 2003, district and school wellness committees are required to assess themselves using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's School Health Index, completing modules 1-4, 10, and 11, and then use the results to create an improvement plan. The School Health Index results are used to develop their School Health and Wellness Improvement Plan, which is required for accreditation.\n\nThrough grant funding from the CDC, free quarterly professional development opportunities are provided for all school personnel based around the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC-pronounced “whisk”) Model.\n\nCoordinated School Health Schools\n\nThe 132 districts that participate in Coordinated School Health are innovators in their districts and apply for grants and develop plans to improve school health using the scorecard from their School Health Index. Typically, these schools have a high-functioning wellness committee and a tenacious wellness committee chairperson who attends quarterly CSH meetings regularly. If you work for a district and are ready and willing to implement healthy changes and would like to join us, please email the CSH coordinators to be added to the CSH distribution list. You will receive grant notifications, meeting alerts, webinar alerts, quarterly newsletters, and access to all our partners’ updates and alerts as well.\n\nArkansas Department of Health, CSH Advisor, Ariel Rogers, (501) 280-4148.\n\nDivision of Education and Secondary Education, CSH Advisor, Lisa Mundy, (501) 683-3604.\n\nVisit the Arkansas Coordinated School Health webpage to view previous CSH meeting recordings and resources.\n\nYou can review data regarding the youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS )for Arkansas students by clicking here, and School Health Profiles for Arkansas students by clicking here.\n\nFunding Opportunities\n\nJoint Use Agreements (JUA)\n\nThe Arkansas Joint Use Agreement (JUA) Grant is a competitive application process made possible and supported by Arkansas’ governor and the Arkansas Tobacco Excise Tax. These funds help schools adopt and implement joint use policy which allows schools to form community partnerships to maximize resources while increasing opportunities for physical activity. Funds are available each fiscal year based on Tobacco Excise Tax appropriations or until funds are expended. Click here for more information.\n\nSchool-Based Health Centers (SBHC)\n\nSchool-Based Health Centers are a great way to coordinate campus services to cover the medical and mental health services students need. Each center must provide basic physical and mental health services no matter their ability to pay. Some centers also include dental services on campus or provide campus-linked services to a provider not located on school grounds. This program functions as a collaboration between the Arkansas Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Education. The School-Based Health Center funding is a once-a-year competitive grant process where districts can apply for up to $500,000 for a 3-year grant cycle. Former grant cycles lasted 5 years. Click here for more information on School-Based Health Centers.\n\nStudent Wellness Advocacy Group (SWAG)\n\nSWAGs are aimed at helping students in 7 - 12th grades learn to advocate for themselves and for healthier campuses. Each year the Arkansas Department of Health funds up to 12 campuses to host SWAGs, providing them with funding, presentations on varying health and advocacy topics, and guidance on advocacy projects in their school, community, or state. For more information about SWAGs click here.\n\nProject Prevent Youth Coalition (PPYC)\n\nProject Prevent is the statewide youth tobacco prevention coalition in Arkansas.

The Act 1220 Coordinator (State School Health and Wellness Coordinator) works with the 1,102 schools in the 262 districts to ensure the requirements of Act 1220 of 2003 and related state and federal school health mandates are met. The main goal is to lower obesity rates by supporting best practices in food service, nutrition, physical, and health education.\n\nThe State School Health and Wellness Coordinator work with school and district wellness committees to help ensure their annual School Health Index (SHI) and School Health and Wellness Improvement Plan are accurately completed and submitted by the October 1st deadline. Also, the Coordinator helps schools in reviewing and updating their School Wellness Policy, provides technical assistance, trainings related to school wellness, and regular updates on school wellness data and reporting.\n\nWhile the school environment is the primary focus of the State School Health and Wellness Coordinator, the role also works to increase partnerships between communities and their schools. The State School Health and Wellness Coordinator discusses the impacts of student health on academics, long-term health, and community strength. Additionally, communities are encouraged to reach out to local schools to engage in conversations about local school wellness programs and initiatives and how they can support school wellness.\n\nIn efforts to increase student driven initiatives in school health and wellness programs, the State School Health and Wellness Coordinator at the Arkansas Department of Health started the Student Wellness Advocacy Group (SWAG) Initiative beginning in the 2018-2019 school year. This program is a partnership between the Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program (TPCP) and the Office of School Health Servicestoprovide health education and teach students how to have conversations about their health and how to improve it. Advisors work with SWAG participants to discuss content, projects, and how to use funding.\n\nArkansas Department of Health, State School Health & Wellness Coordinator: Shanetta Agnew, (501) 280-4889.\n\nDivision of Education and Secondary Education, State School Health and Wellness Coordinator: Shy Whitley, (501) 683-3604\n\nWellness Committee Resources\n\nAmerican School Health Association(ASHA)\n\nArkansas Aware\n\nArkansas Coalition for Obesity Prevention: Early Childhood and Schools Team\n\nBe Well Arkansas\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) Assessment Data\n\nBMI Calculator for Child & Teen\n\nBody Mass Index Dashboard\n\nBMI Toolkit\n\nBody Mass Index: A Training Manual\n\nCDC: Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH)\n\nCDC Healthy Schools\n\nCDC: Virtual Healthy Schools\n\nChild Health Advisory Committee\n\nLocal School Wellness Policy\n\nLocal School Wellness Policy Implementation Under the HHFK Act of 2010:Summary of Final Rule\n\nMaximum Portion Size List\n\nRules Governing Nutrition & Physical Activity Standards & BMI for Age Assessment Protocols in Arkansas Public Schools\n\nWellness Committee Requirements Checklist\n\nWellness is Worth It!
