        "text": "Written by the Reedsy Editorial Team\n\nAbout the author\n\nReedsy's editorial team is a diverse group of industry experts devoted to helping authors write and publish beautiful books.\n\nMore about the Reedsy Editorial Team →\n\nEdited by Martin Cavannagh\n\nAbout Martin Cavannagh\n\nHead of Content at Reedsy, Martin has spent over eight years helping writers turn their ambitions into reality. As a voice in the indie publishing space, he has written for a number of outlets and spoken at conferences, including the 2024 Writers Summit at the London Book Fair.\n\nLearn more →\n\nNothing makes the challenging task of crafting your first book feel more attainable than adopting a story structure to help you plot your narrative.\n\nWhile using a pre-existing blueprint might make you worry about ending up with a formulaic, predictable story, you can probably analyze most of your favorite books using various narrative structures that writers have been using for decades (if not centuries)!\n\nThis post will reveal seven distinct story structures that any writer can use to build a compelling narrative. But first…\n\nWhat is story structure?\n\nStory structure is the order in which plot events are told to the reader or audience. While stories can be told in a wide variety of ways, most Western story structures commonly share certain elements: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.\n\nA tightly controlled structure will answer a reader's questions, provide a climax followed by resolution and information at the end of the story, further the characters’ development, and unravel any central conflicts. In other words, it's responsible for a satisfying narrative experience that accomplishes the author’s aims.\n\nWriting is an art, but if there’s one part of the craft that’s closer to science, this would be it. Become a master of story structure, and you will have the world at your feet.\n\nClassic story structure\n\nWhen people discuss different story structures, they often talk about the different frameworks used to analyze stories. When you boil them all down, all stories have certain shared elements.\n\nElements of classic story structure:\n\nExposition. This first part establishes a protagonist's normal life and greater desires, and usually culminates in the inciting incident.\n\nRising action. The protagonist pursues their new goal and is tested along the way.\n\nClimax. Our hero achieves their goal — or so they think!\n\nFalling action. The hero now must deal with the consequences of achieving their goal.\n\nResolution. The conclusion tying together the plot, character arcs, and themes.\n\nThese are all common ‘beats’ to most stories. It can be easier to see these moments in genres with higher stakes (such as a military thriller), but you’ll find them in almost any type of story.\n\nEven in something as seemingly mild as a rural romance, there will be rising action as our heroes tentatively fall in love and an all-is-lost moment where it seems like they will never get together (before they inevitably do). Without these steps, there is no conflict and no story — merely a series of events that will struggle to keep a reader interested.\n\nGET ACCOUNTABILITY\n\nMeet writing coaches on Reedsy\n\nIndustry insiders can help you hone your craft, finish your draft, and get published.\n\nSeven Story Structures Every Writer Should Know\n\nNow that we’ve established the most essential components of story, let’s look at seven of the most popular story structures used by writers — and how they deploy these components:\n\nFreytag's Pyramid\n\nThe Hero's Journey\n\nThree Act Structure\n\nDan Harmon's Story Circle\n\nFichtean Curve\n\nSave the Cat Beat Sheet\n\nSeven-Point Story Structure\n\nRevealed: Seven story structures every writer needs to know!\n\nClick to tweet!\n\n1. Freytag’s Pyramid\n\nNamed after a 19th-century German novelist and playwright, Freytag’s Pyramid is a five-point dramatic structure that’s based on the classical Greek tragedies of Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Euripedes.\n\nStructure\n\nIntroduction. The status quo is established; an inciting incident occurs.\n\nRise, or rising action. The protagonist actively pursues their goal. The stakes heighten.\n\nClimax. A point of no return, from which the protagonist can no longer go back to the status quo.\n\nReturn, or fall. In the aftermath of the climax, tension builds, and the story heads inevitably towards...\n\nCatastrophe. The protagonist is brought to their lowest point. Their greatest fears have come true.\n\nThis structural model is less frequently used in modern storytelling, partly due to readers’ limited appetite for tragic narratives (although you can still spot a few tragic heroes in popular literature today). By and large, commercial fiction, films, and television will see a protagonist overcome their obstacles to find some small measure of success. That said, it’s still useful to understand the Pyramid as a foundational structure in Western literature — and you will still see it occasionally in the most depressing contemporary tales.\n\nTo learn more, read our full guide on Freytag’s Pyramid here.\n\nIf you struggle to structure a novel, sign up for our How to Write a Novel course to finish a novel in just 3 months.\n\nNEW REEDSY COURSE\n\nHow to Write a Novel\n\nEnroll in our course and become an author in three months.\n\n2. The Hero’s Journey\n\nInspired by Joseph Campbell’s concept of the monomyth — a storytelling pattern that recurs in mythology all over the world — The Hero’s Journey is today’s best-known story structure. Some attribute its popularity to George Lucas, whose Star Wars was heavily influenced by Campbell’s The Hero With a Thousand Faces.\n\nCampbell’s original structure uses terminology that lends itself well to epic tales of bravery and triumph — with plot points like “Belly of the Whale,” “Woman as the Temptress,” and “The Magic Flight.” To make The Hero’s Journey more accessible, Disney executive Christopher Vogler created a simplified version that has become popular amongst mainstream storytellers.\n\nHere, we’ll look at Vogler’s streamlined, 12-step version of The Hero’s Journey.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Ordinary World. The hero’s everyday life is established.\n\nThe Call of Adventure. Otherwise known as the inciting incident.\n\nRefusal of the Call. For a moment, the hero is reluctant to take on the challenge.\n\nMeeting the Mentor. Our hero meets someone who prepares them for what lies ahead — perhaps a parental figure, a teacher, a wizard, or a wise hermit.\n\nCrossing the First Threshold. The hero steps out of their comfort zone and enters a ‘new world.’\n\nTests, Allies, Enemies. Our protagonist faces new challenges — and maybe picks up some new friends. Think of Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road.\n\nApproach to the Inmost Cave. The hero gets close to their goal. Luke Skywalker reaches the Death Star.\n\nThe Ordeal. The hero meets (and overcomes) their greatest challenge yet.\n\nReward (Seizing the Sword). The hero obtains something important they were after, and victory is in sight.\n\nThe Road Back. The hero realizes that achieving their goal is not the final hurdle. In fact, ‘seizing the sword’ may have made things worse for them.\n\nResurrection. The hero faces their final challenge — a climactic test that hinges on everything they’ve learned over their journey.\n\nReturn with the Elixir. Having triumphed, our protagonist returns to their old life. Dorothy returns to Kansas; Iron Man holds a press conference to blow his own trumpet.\n\nWhile Vogler’s simplified steps still retain some of Campbell’s mythological language with its references to swords and elixirs, the framework can be applied to almost any genre of fiction. To see how a ‘realistic’ story can adhere to this structure, check out our guide to the hero’s journey in which we analyze Rocky through this very lens.\n\nFREE OUTLINING APP\n\nReedsy Studio\n\nUse the Boards feature to plan, organize, or research anything.\n\n3. Three Act Structure\n\nFollowing the old adage that “every story has a beginning, middle, and end,” this popular structure splits a story’s components into three distinct acts: Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution. In many ways, the three-act structure reworks The Hero’s Journey, with slightly less exciting labels.\n\nStructure\n\nAct 1: Setup\n\nExposition. The status quo or ‘ordinary world’ is established.\n\nInciting Incident. An event that sets the story in motion.\n\nPlot Point One. The protagonist decides to tackle the challenge head-on. She ‘crosses the threshold,’ and the story is now truly moving.\n\nAct 2: Confrontation\n\nRising Action. The story's true stakes become clear; our hero grows familiar with her ‘new world’ and has her first encounters with some enemies and allies. (see Tests, Allies, Enemies)\n\nMidpoint. An event that upends the protagonist’s mission. (Similar to the climax in Freytag’s pyramid)\n\nPlot Point Two. In the wake of the disorienting midpoint, the protagonist is tested — and fails. Her ability to succeed is now in doubt.\n\nAct 3: Resolution\n\nPre Climax. The night is darkest before dawn. The protagonist must pull herself together and choose between decisive action and failure.\n\nClimax. She faces off against her antagonist one last time. Will she prevail?\n\nDenouement. All loose ends are tied up. The reader discovers the consequences of the climax. A new status quo is established.\n\nWhen we speak about a confrontation with an antagonist, this doesn’t always mean a fight to the death. In some cases, the antagonist might be a love rival, a business competitor, or merely an internal or environmental conflict that our protagonist has been struggling with the entire story.\n\nIf you’re interested in using this model to plot your own story, read our guide to the three-act structure, and be sure to sign up to our free course on the subject.\n\nFREE COURSE\n\nHow to Plot a Novel in Three Acts\n\nIn 10 days, learn how to plot a novel that keeps readers hooked\n\n4. Dan Harmon's Story Circle\n\nAnother variation on Campbell’s monomyth structure, the Story Circle is an approach developed by Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon. Again, heavily inspired by the Hero's Journey, the benefit of Harmon's approach is its focus on the protagonist's character arc. Instead of referring to abstract concepts like 'story midpoint' and 'denouement', each beat in the story circle forces the writer to think about the character's wants and needs.\n\nStructure\n\nA character is in a zone of comfort... This is the establishment of the status quo.\n\nBut they want something... This 'want' could be something long-standing and brought to the fore by an inciting incident.\n\nThey enter an unfamiliar situation... The protagonist must do something new in their pursuit of the thing they want.\n\nAdapt to it... Faced with some challenges, they struggle then begin to succeed.\n\nGet what they wanted... Usually a false victory.\n\nPay a heavy price for it... They realize that what they 'wanted' wasn't what they 'needed'.\n\nThen return to their familiar situation... armed with a new truth.\n\nHaving changed... For better or worse.\n\nCreated by a writer whose chosen medium is the 30-minute sitcom, this structure is worded in a way that sidesteps the need for a protagonist to undergo life-changing transformations with each story. After all, for a comedy to continue for six seasons (and a movie) its characters can't completely transform at the end of each episode. They can, however, learn small truths about themselves and the world around them — which, like all humans, they can quickly forget about if next week's episode calls for it.\n\nTo learn more and see this structure applied to an episode of Rick and Morty, check out our full post on Dan Harmon's Story Circle.\n\nSide note: for this kind of character-driven plot (and, indeed, for all of these structures), you're going to want to know you're protagonist inside and out. Why not check out some of our character development exercises for help fleshing your characters out, like the profile template below.\n\nFREE RESOURCE\n\nReedsy’s Character Profile Template\n\nA story is only as strong as its characters.

Fichtean Curve\n\nFleshed out in John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction, the Fichtean Curve is a narrative structure that puts our main characters through a series of many obstacles on their way to achieving their overarching goals. Resembling Freytag’s Pyramid, it encourages authors to write narratives packed with tension and mini-crises that keep readers eager to reach the climax.\n\nBypassing the “ordinary world” setup of many other structures, the Fichtean Curve starts with the inciting incident and goes straight into the rising action. Multiple crises occur, each of which contributes to the readers’ overall understanding of the narrative — replacing the need for the initial exposition.\n\nStructure\n\nTo discuss this unusual structure, it’s perhaps best to see it in use. We’ll use Celeste Ng’s Everything I Never Told You as an example. Needless to say, spoilers ahead.\n\nRising Action\n\nInciting incident. The novel begins with the line: “Lydia is dead. But they don’t know this yet.” Within the first three paragraphs, Marilyn realizes that her daughter Lydia is missing. Thus, readers are thrown straight into rising action as Marilyn anxiously searches all the usual places Lydia might be found.\n\nFirst crisis. Lydia’s family is informed her body was found in a nearby lake. From this first crisis's climax, the narrative flashes back to provide exposition and details of the family’s history.\n\nSecond crisis. In flashbacks, we discover that, 11 years prior, Marilyn abandoned her family to resume her undergraduate studies. In her absence, the family begins to fall apart. Marilyn learns she is pregnant and is forced to return home. Having lost her opportunity for further education, she places the pressure of academic success on her children.\n\nThird crisis. Back in the present, Lydia’s father, James, is cheating on Marilyn. The police decide to close the investigation, ruling Lydia’s death a suicide. This results in a massive argument between her parents, and James leaves to stay with the “other woman.”\n\nFourth crisis. Flashback to the day Lydia died. From her perspective, we see that she’s misunderstood by her parents. She mourns her brother’s impending departure for college, leaving her as the sole focus of her parents’ pressure. Isolated, she tries to seduce a friend — who rejects her advances and explains he’s in love with her brother.\n\nClimax\n\nLydia takes a boat into the lake in the middle of the night — determined to overcome her fear of water and reclaim control of her life. Lydia jumps off the boat, into the water, and out of this life. As in a classical tragedy, this moment is both devastating and inevitable.\n\nFalling Action\n\nSome level of resolution is achieved, and readers get to at least glimpse the “new norm” for the characters. Lydia’s family lean on one another in their grief. While they may never be able to make their amends with Lydia, they can learn from her death. Not all of the loose ends are tied off, but readers infer the family is on the long road to recovery.\n\nNote: In the rising action stage, all of the crises should build tension towards — and correspond with — the story’s major climax. Like the three-act narrative structure, the Fichtean Curve’s climax typically occurs two-thirds through the book.\n\nWhile this structure lends itself well to flashback-heavy novels such as Everything I Never Told You, it is also incredibly common in theatre. In stage plays like The Cherry Orchard and A Doll’s House, the action takes place in a fixed time and place, but backstory and character development are revealed through moments of high drama that occur before the audience’s eyes.\n\nFor a deeper look at this structure, head to our full post on the Fichtean Curve.\n\n6. Save the Cat Beat Sheet\n\nAnother variation of the three-act structure, this framework created by Hollywood screenwriter Blake Snyder, has been widely championed by storytellers across many media forms.\n\nFun fact: Save the Cat is named for a moment in the set up of a story (usually a film) where our hero does something to endear himself to the audience.\n\nWhile many structures are reluctant to prescribe exactly when in a story the various beats should take place, Snyder and Save the Cat have no such qualms. The number in the square brackets below refers to the page that the beat should take place — assuming you’re writing a 110-page screenplay.\n\nStructure\n\nOpening Image [1]. The first shot of the film. If you’re starting a novel, this would be an opening paragraph or scene that sucks readers into the world of your story.\n\nSet-up [1-10]. Establishing the ‘ordinary world’ of your protagonist. What does he want? What is he missing out on?\n\nTheme Stated [5]. During the setup, hint at what your story is really about — the truth that your protagonist will discover by the end.\n\nCatalyst [12]. The inciting incident!\n\nDebate [12-25]. The hero refuses the call to adventure. He tries to avoid the conflict before they are forced into action.\n\nBreak into Two [25]. The protagonist makes an active choice and the journey begins in earnest.\n\nB Story [30]. A subplot kicks in. Often romantic in nature, the protagonist’s subplot should serve to highlight the theme.\n\nThe Promise of the Premise [30-55]. Often called the ‘fun and games’ stage, this is usually a highly entertaining section where the writer delivers the goods. If you promised an exciting detective story, we’d see the detective in action. If you promised a goofy story of people falling in love, let’s go on some charmingly awkward dates.\n\nMidpoint [55]. A plot twist occurs that ups the stakes and makes the hero’s goal harder to achieve — or makes them focus on a new, more important goal.\n\nBad Guys Close In [55-75]. The tension ratchets up. The hero’s obstacles become greater, his plan falls apart, and he is on the back foot.\n\nAll is Lost [75]. The hero hits rock bottom. He loses everything he’s gained so far, and things are looking bleak. The hero is overpowered by the villain; a mentor dies; our lovebirds have an argument and break up.\n\nDark Night of the Soul [75-85-ish]. Having just lost everything, the hero shambles around the city in a minor-key musical montage before discovering some “new information” that reveals exactly what he needs to do if he wants to take another crack at success. (This new information is often delivered through the B-Story)\n\nBreak into Three [85]. Armed with this new information, our protagonist decides to try once more!\n\nFinale [85-110]. The hero confronts the antagonist or whatever the source of the primary conflict is. The truth that eluded him at the start of the story (established in step three and accentuated by the B Story) is now clear, allowing him to resolve their story.\n\nFinal Image [110]. A final moment or scene that crystallizes how the character has changed. It’s a reflection, in some way, of the opening image.\n\nSome writers may find this structure too prescriptive, but it’s incredible to see how many mainstream stories seem to adhere to it — either by design or coincidence. Over on the Save the Cat website, there are countless examples of films and novels analyzed with Snyder’s 15 beats. You’ll be surprised how accurate some of the timings are for each of the beats.\n\nFor a deeper dive into this framework, and to watch this video where Reedsy’s Shaelin plots out a Middle-Grade fantasy novel using Snyder’s method — head to our full post on the Save the Cat Beat Sheet.\n\n7. Seven-Point Story Structure\n\nA slightly less detailed adaptation of The Hero’s Journey, the Seven-Point Story Structure focuses specifically on the highs and lows of a narrative arc.\n\nAccording to author Dan Wells, who developed the Seven-Point Story Structure, writers are encouraged to start at the end, with the resolution, and work their way back to the starting point: the hook. With the ending in mind, they can have their protagonist and plot begin in a state that best contrasts the finale — since this structure is all about dramatic changes from beginning to end.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Hook. Draw readers in by explaining the protagonist’s current situation. Their state of being at the beginning of the novel should be in direct contrast to what it will be at the end of the novel.\n\nPlot Point 1. Whether it’s a person, an idea, an inciting incident, or something else — there should be a \"Call to Adventure\" of sorts that sets the narrative and character development in motion.\n\nPinch Point 1. Things can’t be all sunshine and roses for your protagonist. Something should go wrong here that applies pressure to the main character, forcing them to step up and solve the problem.\n\nMidpoint. A “Turning Point” wherein the main character changes from a passive force to an active force in the story. Whatever the narrative’s main conflict is, the protagonist decides to start meeting it head-on.\n\nPinch Point 2. The second pinch point involves another blow to the protagonist — things go even more awry than they did during the first pinch point. This might involve the passing of a mentor, the failure of a plan, the reveal of a traitor, etc.\n\nPlot Point 2. After the calamity of Pinch Point 2, the protagonist learns that they’ve actually had the key to solving the conflict the whole time.\n\nResolution. The story’s primary conflict is resolved — and the character goes through the final bit of development necessary to transform them from who they were at the start of the novel.\n\nFor a deeper look into Wells's approach — including the key to using it — check out our full post on the seven-point story structure.\n\nWe've said it before, and we'll say it again: story structures aren't an exact science, and you should feel welcome to stray from the path they present. They're simply there to help you find your narrative's footing — a blueprint for the world you're about to start building."
