Tickets start at $49.50 plus applicable fees and go on sale Friday, February 23, at 10 a.m.\n\nSince 1976, George Thorogood & The Destroyers have sold over 15 million albums, played more than 8,000 ferocious live shows, and built a catalog of classic hits that includes “Get A Haircut”, “I Drink Alone”, “One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer”, and “Move It On Over”. Their definitive badass anthem “Bad To The Bone”, deemed the most popular song for bikers by Spotify, celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2022, and the party's still going strong.\n\nAbout George Thorogood & The Destroyers\n\nOn the evening of December 1st , 1973 at The University of Delaware’s Lane Hall, a guitarist, a drummer, and their rhythm guitarist set up their gear on the small bandstand. Though the three-piece band had barely rehearsed, guitarist George Thorogood and drummer Jeff Simon had been bashing out covers of songs they loved – including “No Particular Place To Go,” “Madison Blues,” and “One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer” – in suburban Wilmington basements since they were teens. The Lane Hall audience was wary at first. “Then it was like somebody flipped a switch,” Simon recalls. “Everybody hit the dance floor all at once.”\n\n“We had the place rockin’,” Thorogood says. “From that very first show, Jeff and I knew we were onto something.” Five decades, more than 8,000 performances, and over 15 million albums later, few bands can still rock the house like George Thorogood & The Destroyers. And for Thorogood, Simon, and other long-term Destroyers Bill Blough, Jim Suhler and Buddy Leach, their Bad All Over the World – 50 Years of Rock Tour will be a celebration like no other.\n\nBut when asked to pick a career highlight, maybe one night over the past half century that changed everything for George Thorogood The Destroyers, he shakes his head, flashes a huge grin, and heads off to soundcheck. “My highlight is when I step on that bandstand,” Thorogood says. “The promoters invited us, the audience came to hear us, and we’re ready to rock. Every night I play for people can be the biggest night of my life.”\n\nView Event →\n\nClassics, Romantics & Modern Day Works\n\n5/11: Doors open at 6 PM | Show at 7:30 PM\n\n5/12: Doors open at 1 PM | Show at 2 PM\n\nJoin Colorado West Performing Arts Company for a mixed repertoire performance at the Avalon Theatre.

The real-time exuberance Tommy brings to every note of every song he plays is palpable and infectious. His fans are in love with his unbound talent as a guitarist of multitudes, his ability to play three parts at once, always with pure heart and real soul. He is a true virtuoso. But he seems as delighted always with the magic of the music as the audience, if not more, and his joy illuminates everything.\n\nMore info: https://tommyemmanuel.com/bio/\n\nView Event →\n\nCO West Performing Arts Company presents Little Mermaid\n\nDoors open one hour prior to showtime.\n\nWhen a young mermaid is finally allowed her first glimpse of life beyond the ocean, she is enthralled by what she sees and dreams of what her life would be like on land.
