You can’t blame Seth MacFarlane, that one-man comedy juggernaut, for wanting to add movie star to his list of credentials. After all, he has succeeded beyond any sane person’s wildest dreams at building a comedy empire by holding a stinky finger to the racing pulse of the collective id.

Like his fellow naughty boys Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who share his attitude of deadpan sarcasm, he knows full well that the human appetite for good-natured humor about bodily excretions and the messy area between the navel and the thighs is here to stay. It is primal farce, which, if we haven’t learned to accept it, will leave us permanently wrinkling our noses while the rest of the world goes on sniffing and chortling.

And so we have Mr. MacFarlane playing Albert Stark, a cowering sheep farmer with a dirty mind, in his silly western spoof, “A Million Ways to Die in the West,” set in Arizona in 1882. This flighty comedy, which imagines itself a son of “Blazing Saddles,” demolishes the heroic mystique of the Old West with the nose-thumbing glee of a rambunctious brat who has just crawled out of a fetid mud puddle.

It is also a descendant of the Bob Hope westerns “The Paleface” and “Son of Paleface,” Mr. MacFarlane being a disciple of Hope in spirit, if not in fact. Like Hope, Mr. MacFarlane is essentially a blank personality behind the facade of cynical, wisecracking toastmaster. As the host of the 2013 Oscars, Mr. MacFarlane presented himself as a potential Hope successor but lacked the comic timing and chutzpah to pull off the charade.
