        "text": "Quantum computing has the potential to transform the global economy and society at large. The long-term Microsoft investment will bring state-of-the-art equipment, foster the recruitment of new staff, help build the nation’s scientific and engineering talent, and focus significant research project funding into the University of Sydney Nano Institute, assuring Australia a leading role in the emerging quantum economy.\n\nThe investment represents the largest single contribution to quantum computing ever in Australia.\n\nDoug Carmean, Microsoft’s computer architect, said: “Our significant investment in quantum computing is a collaborative effort between Microsoft and academia. This is what will ultimately accelerate the transition from pure research to the development of useful quantum machines.”\n\nThe University of Sydney’s quantum laboratory is one of just three global hubs into which Microsoft has invested, the other experimental centres being TU Delft, Netherlands and Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\n“The deep partnership between Microsoft and the University of Sydney will allow us to help build a rich and robust local quantum economy by attracting more skilled people, invest in new equipment and research, and accelerate progress in quantum computing – a technology that we believe will disrupt the way we live, reshaping national and global security and revolutionise medicine, communications and transport,” Professor David Reilly, director of the University of Sydney Microsoft Quantum Laboratory said."
