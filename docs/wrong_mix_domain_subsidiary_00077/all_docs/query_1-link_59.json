        "text": "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (967340)\n\nPublished: May 12, 2009 | Updated: June 09, 2009\n\nVersion: 2.0\n\nGeneral Information\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nThis security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000. For supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; all supported versions of PowerPoint Viewer, and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; Microsoft Works 8.5; and Microsoft Works 9, this security update is rated Important. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section.\n\nThe security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that PowerPoint handles conditions that could cause memory corruption when opening specially crafted PowerPoint files. This update also addresses the vulnerabilities by preventing Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 from opening PowerPoint 4.0 native file formats. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, Vulnerability Information.\n\nThis security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in Microsoft Security Advisory 969136.\n\nRecommendation.Â Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.\n\nKnown Issues.Â Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967340 documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.\n\nAffected and Non-Affected Software\n\nThe following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle.\n\nAffected Software\n\nOffice Suite and Other Software Component Maximum Security Impact Aggregate Severity Rating Bulletins Replaced by this Update Microsoft Office Suites and Components Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 Service Pack 3 (KB957790) Remote Code Execution Critical MS08-051 Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 Service Pack 3 (KB957781) Remote Code Execution Important MS08-051 Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB957784) Remote Code Execution Important MS08-051 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 Service Pack 1 (KB957789) Remote Code Execution Important MS08-051 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 2 Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB957789) Remote Code Execution Important None Microsoft Office for Mac Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB969661) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-009 Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB971822) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-009 Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB971824) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS08-074 Other Office Software PowerPoint Viewer 2003 (KB969615) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS08-052 PowerPoint Viewer 2007 Service Pack 1 and PowerPoint Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB970059) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important None Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 1 (KB969618) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS08-051 Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 2 (KB969618) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important None Microsoft Works 8.5 (KB967043) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS08-072 Microsoft Works 9 (KB967044) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important None\n\nWhy was this bulletin rereleased on June 9, 2009? Microsoft rereleased this security bulletin to provide security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, Microsoft Works 8.5, and Microsoft Works 9. Customers who currently have these software installed need to apply this update immediately. When this bulletin was first released, these security update packages were still in development. At the time, Microsoft released this bulletin because we had update packages ready on the regular bulletin release cycle for an entire product line to address the vast majority of customers at risk. This current release now completes the range of updates for software that are affected by the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin.\n\nMS09-021 and MS09-027 also describe vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How do MS09-021 and MS09-027 relate to this bulletin (MS09-017)?\n\nThe security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB969661), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB971822), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB971824) in this bulletin, MS09-017, also address the vulnerabilities described in MS09-021 and MS09-027. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install the update packages once.\n\nMS09-024 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Works 8.5 and Microsoft Works 9. How does MS09-024 relate to this bulletin (MS09-017)?\n\nThe security update packages for Microsoft Works 8.5 (KB967043) and Microsoft Works 9 (KB967044) in this bulletin, MS09-017, also address the vulnerabilities described in MS09-024. Users with Microsoft Works 8.5 or Microsoft Works 9 installed will only need to install the update packages once.\n\nWhere are the file information details?\n\nThe file information details can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967340.\n\nDo users need to make special considerations regarding PowerPoint 4.0 file formats?\n\nWith this update, the ability to open PowerPoint 4.0 file formats will be disabled by default in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002. This functionality has already been disabled by default in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3. This functionality also no longer exists in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007. For more information regarding this change, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980.\n\nWhy does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?\n\nThis update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.\n\nWhy is this update Critical for PowerPoint 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of PowerPoint?\n\nMicrosoft Office PowerPoint 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.\n\nWhat components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?\n\nThe update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.\n\nThe Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?\n\nYes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335.\n\nDoes the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanismÂ No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.\n\nI am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?\n\nThe affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle.\n\nIt should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle. For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit Microsoft Product Support Services.\n\nCustomers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office.
