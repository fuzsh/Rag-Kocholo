To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit Microsoft Support Lifecycle.\n\nAffected Software\n\nOffice Suite and Other Software Component Maximum Security Impact Aggregate Severity Rating Bulletins Replaced by this Update Microsoft Office Suites and Components Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 Microsoft Office Word 2002 Service Pack 3 (KB973444) Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 Microsoft Office Word 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB973443) Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Microsoft Office for Mac Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB976830) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB976828) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB976831) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Other Office Software Microsoft Office Word Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB973866) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027 Microsoft Office Word Viewer (KB973866) Not applicable Remote Code Execution Important MS09-027\n\nNon-Affected Software\n\nOffice and Other Software Microsoft Office Word 2007 Service Pack 1 Microsoft Office Word 2007 Service Pack 2 Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 2 Microsoft Works 8.5 Microsoft Works 9\n\nWhere are the file information details?\n\nRefer to the reference tables in the Security Update Deployment section for the location of the file information details.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Office Word Viewer?\n\nMicrosoft Office Word Viewer is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all previous Word Viewer versions. For information on how to obtain the latest Word Viewer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 891090.\n\nMS09-067 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS09-067 relate to this bulletin (MS09-068)?\n\nThe security update packages in this bulletin, MS09-068, for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB976830), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB976828), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB976831) also address the vulnerabilities described in MS09-067. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install these security update packages once.\n\nThe Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?\n\nYes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in their version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.\n\nDoes the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?\n\nNo, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.\n\nWhy is this update only Important for all affected versions of Word?\n\nMicrosoft Office Word 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.\n\nI am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?\n\nThe affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site.\n\nIt should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see Select a Product for Lifecycle Information. For more information about service packs for these software releases, see Lifecycle Supported Service Packs.\n\nCustomers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2009-3135.\n\nMitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Word File Information Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3135\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\nIn a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.\n\nThe vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nUsers of Office XP and later editions of Office will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document.\n\nWorkarounds for Microsoft Office Word File Information Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3135\n\nWorkaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:\n\nDo not open Word documents from untrusted sources\n\nDo not open or save Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.\n\nUse the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources\n\nThe Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.\n\nTo install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.\n\nTo install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:\n\nDownload the FileFormatConverters.exe package now\n\nMOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:\n\nhttps:\n\nTo enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .doc file format. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .doc file format:\n\nCommand to enable MOICE to be the registered handler Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8\n\nNote On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.\n\nFor more information on MOICE, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865.\n\nImpact of workaround. Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.\n\nFAQ for Microsoft Office Word File Information Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3135\n\nWhat is the scope of the vulnerability?\n\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability.

All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.\n\nTo install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:\n\nWindows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP\n\nWindows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000\n\nWindows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0\n\nFor more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684.\n\nThis security update supports the following setup switches.\n\nSwitch Description /q Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. /q:u Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user. /q:a Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user. /t:path Specifies the target folder for extracting files. /c Extracts the files without installing them. If /t:path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. /c:path Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. /r:n Never restarts the system after installation. /r:I Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with /q:a. /r:a Always restarts the system after installation. /r:s Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user. /n:v No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.\n\nNote You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses.
