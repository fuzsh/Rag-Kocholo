Everything you need to know\n\nThe potential of AI technology has been percolating in the background for years. But when ChatGPT, the AI chatbot, began grabbing headlines in early 2023, it put generative AI in the spotlight. This guide is your go-to manual for generative AI, covering its benefits, limits, use cases, prospects and much more.\n\nDefinition\n\nGoogle Search Labs\n\nWhat is Google Search Labs?\n\nGoogle Search Labs is an initiative from Alphabet's Google division to provide new capabilities and experiments for Google Search in a preview format before they become publicly available.\n\nThe Google Search Labs initiative was announced on May 10, 2023, at the Google I/O conference. Google's foundation as a company has always been search, and the technology has been iterated on for decades by Google's engineers. Iteration and enhancement for the main Google search engine have been kept private by Google until ready for public consumption. With Google Search Labs, Google plans on providing a preview for users of potential future capabilities.\n\nNew features available via Google Search Labs are experiments by Google and are intended to help test out ideas with interested users. At launch, there are three experiments in Google Search Labs:\n\nSearch Generative Experience (SGE). One of the initial purposes of Google Search Labs is to serve as a delivery mechanism for SGE. SGE is a new type of generative artificial intelligence (AI) interface for Search. It is powered by Google's Pathways Language Model 2 large language model, which can respond to queries, make recommendations and provide a conversational interface option for search queries.\n\nCode Tips. The Code Tips experiment with Google Search Labs is designed to provide answers to programming code-related queries. The initial list of languages the Code Tips experiment will support is limited to C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python and TypeScript. Users will also be able to query about popular developer tools usage, including Docker and Git.\n\nAdd to Sheets. Google Sheets is an online spreadsheet service offered by Google. With the Add to Sheets Search Labs experiment, users will be able to directly insert a Google search result into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. The goal of this experiment is to provide users with another way to share search information. As part of Google Sheets, the search results can be tracked by users with a spreadsheet and are in a format that can be easily shared.\n\nGoogle Search Labs is part of Google's larger overall effort to enable users to experiment with new and emerging capabilities while in development. The primary Labs portal lists an array of AI experiments, including the following:\n\nThis article is part of\n\nWhat is generative AI?

The main purpose of Search Labs is to enable experimentation and to try out new ideas. For Google, it enables the company to provide access to some of its preproduction-grade capabilities to help determine what does and doesn't work.\n\nAwareness. Users and organizations alike can gain awareness of potential future directions that Google might be taking at an early stage, which could help with product and service strategy and development.\n\nContribution and comments. Individuals can participate in the experiments, which might help to shape the direction an experiment takes. Participants can also contribute by providing feedback and suggestions on how the capabilities can or should be improved before becoming generally available.\n\nFor more on generative AI, read the following articles:\n\nHow to prevent deepfakes in the era of generative AI\n\nGenerative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns\n\nAI existential risk: Is AI a threat to humanity?\n\nHow to detect AI-generated content\n\nPros and cons of AI-generated content\n\nHow do you sign up for Google Search Labs?\n\nGoogle opened sign-ups for interested individuals to participate in Search Labs on May 10, 2023. Initially, signups are limited only to users located in the U.S.\n\nAt launch, the sign-up process does not immediately give users access to the experiments. Rather, it adds interested users to a waitlist for access to the actual experiments, which Google expects to open over the course of May and June 2023. Users can sign up to the Google Search Labs experiments via Google Chrome running on the desktop or via the Google app on both Apple iOS and Android mobile operating systems.\n\nContinue Reading About Google Search Labs\n\nGoogle doubles down on generative AI\n\n35 AI content generators to explore\n\nBard vs. ChatGPT: What's the difference?\n\nGenerative AI landscape: Potential future trends\n\n7 generative AI challenges that businesses should consider\n\nRelated Terms\n\nWhat is Bayes' theorem?\n\nBayes' theorem is a mathematical formula used in probability theory to calculate conditional probability, i.e., the revised ...
