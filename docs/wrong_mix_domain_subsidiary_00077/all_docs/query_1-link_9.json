        "text": "In a rapidly growing and evolving business applications market, Microsoft Business Solutions is committed to enhancing business opportunities for its ISV partner community. We believe there is a great opportunity to revolutionize how small, mid-size and corporate business customers' needs are met by working strategically with our ISV partners.\n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions focuses development today on cross-industry horizontal business applications and four broad industry-specific business applications (retail, manufacturing, distribution, and business and professional services), and depends on ISV partners to build applications and customize Microsoft products for small and mid-sized businesses and divisions of large organizations.\n\nMicrosoft's $2.4 billion investment in business applications is in direct alignment with the mission of enabling people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. Microsoft has the opportunity to transform today's underserved business applications market and make the promises of unrealized potential come true.\n\nThe Microsoft Business Solutions development strategy is twofold:\n\nExpand and strengthen today's solutions with new software offerings and enhancements to help customers continue to realize a return on their investment, increase efficiencies and improve productivity.\n\nDevelop a totally new and innovative next generation Microsoft Business Solutions business applications suite. (Referred to as \"Project Green\")\n\nThis development strategy is backed by significant customer and industry research along with increased development (R&D) resources, which includes people and financial investments. Microsoft is in a unique position to execute on this strategy because of its commitment to ongoing innovation through research and development and its ability to invest for the future.\n\nDeveloping this next generation business applications suite is an ambitious project and, much like Longhorn, is several years away from availability. Our number one priority is shipping the best possible software that exceeds the needs of our customers  today and in the future.\n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions, building on its core assets from the acquisitions of Great Plains and Navision, now has one of the industry's most significant research & development efforts focused on small and midmarket businesses. Microsoft has an exciting product roadmap that will enable businesses worldwide to increase their agility and insight through interconnected solutions while ISVs will see an unprecedented wave of new opportunities as part of this expanding ecosystem.\n\nOur product differentiation ran be outlined as follows:\n\nAxapta — Designed for companies with multi-national operations with particular strengths for advanced manufacturers — script — by multi-national, we mean multi-location, multi-currency and multi-language off of a single instance of the application and database.\n\nGreat Plains — Cross-industry ERP for the entire midmarket. with rich out-of-the-box functionality and a broad set of 1SV solutions.\n\nNavision — Cross-industry midmarket ERP with flexibility and tools for building highly customized solutions to address unique business processes.\n\nSolomon — ERP with particular strength in Project Management and Accounting — script — Microsoft Solomon is primarily focused in the US and Latin American markets.\n\nWe look to our channel partners to understand the strengths of products they sell and provide customers with the best fit. We remain committed to all product lines, and will continue to invest across all functional areas of each product, encouraging our channel partners to develop deep skills in fewer products, and pick up complementary or industry solutions such as Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Business Portal, Retail Management System and others to be released.\n\nWe are committed to invest in and support Microsoft Business Solutions core enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions— Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision and Microsoft Solomon. - through 2013. Microsoft Business Solutions has demonstrated commitment and innovation to its technologies in the past — far beyond the release of new platform solutions. For example, Great Plains Accounting, a DOS-based business solution, was enhanced and supported for 17 years, far beyond the initial release of our Great Plains (previously Dynamics and eEnterprise) software applications. We will continue to support current and new customers in the future as we begin to introduce the benefits and value that the next generation suite can bring to their businesses.\n\nOur commitment includes the delivery of material upgrades to each of these ERP solutions. Near-term upgrades will include a new user interface aligned with Microsoft Office 2003, ease of use enhancements, tighter integration with other Microsoft software, and targeted functionality additions. We'll continue to aggressively seek customer and partner input as part of our research and development process. Across all offerings, our mission is and will continue to be to deliver the best possible solutions that exceed the needs of our customers. The Statement of Direction documents that provide additional details on the strategy for each of these solutions can be found on PartnerSource or can be requested from your local Partner Account Manager.\n\naccess to information or better manage the sales force, and it is our goal to continue to support and invest in these solutions.\n\nMicrosoft is in the unique position of having significant resources to invest not only in current generation technology but in the next generation technologies, too. Customer and partners can be assured that when the next technology shift occurs within the market, Microsoft Business Solutions will be there with applications that deliver breakthroughs in agility, connectivity and collaboration and a new generation of access to data analysis and business insight.\n\nAdditionally it is a reality that every software provider has \"another version just around the corner\". The difference with Microsoft is that we share our vision of the future so that customers can make informed decisions that benefit them most.\n\nNo. It is Microsoft Business Solutions' goal to not only deliver major upgrades to our business applications but also provide new applications, built on the latest Microsoft tools that enable organizations to begin to take advantage of some of these breakthroughs associated with the latest technology shift. These are applications such as the Business Portal, Microsoft Business Solutions CRM and the Microsoft Business Network. At some point in the future, at a time that's appropriate for their businesses, customers will be able to move their entire systems to the future Microsoft Business Solutions business application suite.\n\nAdditionally, when the next generation suite is released, customers will be able to receive like functionality (as available) at no additional license cost made possible with Transformational Assurance. The Transformational Assurance benefit of the Enhancement Program provides that when customers license Microsoft® Business Solutions—Axapta®, Microsoft Business Solutions—Great Plains , Microsoft Business Solutions—Navision® , Microsoft Business Solutions—Solomon, including the Standard editions, as well as Microsoft Business Solutions CRM, Microsoft Business Solutions—XAL and Microsoft Business Solutions—Apertum, and stay current on the Microsoft Business Solutions Enhancement Program, they will be able to move to the future Microsoft Business Solutions business application suite without having to reacquire the functionality they already license.\n\nOur product differentiation can be outlined as follows:\n\nAxapta  Designed for companies with multi-national operations with particular strengths for advanced manufacturers - script - by multi-national, we mean multi-location, multi-currency and multi-language off of a single instance of the application and database.\n\nGreat Plains  Cross-industry financial management solution for the entire mid-size business segment, with rich out-of-the-box functionality and a broad set of ISV solutions.\n\nNavision  Cross-industry mid-size financial management solution, with flexibility and tools for building highly customized solutions to address unique business processes.\n\nSolomon  ERP with particular strength in Project Management and Accounting  script  Microsoft Solomon is focused primarily in the US and Latin American markets.\n\nWe look to our channel partners to understand the strengths of the products they sell and provide customers with the best fit. We remain committed to all product lines and will continue to invest across all functional areas of each product, encouraging our channel partners to develop deep skills in fewer products, and pick up complementary or industry solutions such as Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Business Portal, Retail Management System and others to be released.\n\nMicrosoft Business Portal is part of the Foundation Layer for Great Plains and Solomon and is available to customers of those solutions at no additional cost*. Additional capabilities such as the HRM Self Service Suite and Key Performance Indicators are priced on a per-module basis. (Modules within the HRM Self Service Suite are priced from $500 (U.S.) to $2500 (U.S.). Pricing for the KPI module is $3,000 (U.S.).\n\nIndividual access to Microsoft Business Portal requires a user license, and there are two types of users for Microsoft Business Solutions:\n\nThe \"Professional\" User (formerly called System Manager User), with Web- and rich-client access to all licensed servers (Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Solomon), including all Microsoft Business Portal features.\n\nThe \"Employee\" User, with access to all Microsoft Business Portal features including reports, queries, information pages and productivity tools such as employee self-service and timecard entry, but without access to the Great Plains and Solomon business applications. The Employee User license is targeted at all users in the company who do not require the Professional User access. Pricing for employee users is as follows:\n\n(1-100) $40\n\n(101-250) $35\n\n(251-500) $30\n\n(501-1000) $25\n\n(1001-2000) $20 UNLIMITED $40,000\n\n* Because Solomon Standard is offered at a reduced price, we will be charging a module price of US$1500 for Business Portal for Solomon Standard customers only.\n\nYes. Microsoft Axapta and Microsoft Navision are both equipped with portal functionality that is equivalent to Microsoft Business Portal for Microsoft Great Plains and Microsoft Solomon. With Microsoft Axapta Enterprise Portal, businesses can make workflow smoother by allowing employees, customers, vendors, and other business partners to interact directly with Microsoft Axapta.\n\nPortals (Microsoft Navision Commerce Portal and Microsoft Navision User Portal) in Microsoft Navision provide self-service to customers, vendors and other partners, as well as employees via their own personalized Web page, depending on their particular role and access rights.\n\nprocesses across a range of devices, technologies and locations. It includes built-in support for Web services and Extensible Markup Language (XML), a standard that synchronizes previously incompatible data and applications. The product will also include (via partnerships) interoperability with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), including other EDI standards organizations and more traditional EDI data transports such as value-added networks (VANs).\n\nFor example, we announced today (3/22/04) that we've just completed the proof of concept phase working with Inovis. This and other similar partnership will allow us to extend the reach of Microsoft Business Network, enabling customers to trade information with their business partners regardless of the network technology being used.\n\nThis is why in September we launched a prototype project that relies on the capabilities of the Microsoft Business Network, Demand Planner modules, and Event Management templates and integrates with RFID technology. The prototype has been developed to gain key learning's on what solutions a company really needs to have in place. And to gain key knowledge into how to deliver a solution that solves the problems of our business customers in the small and mid-sized business market.\n\nMicrosoft Small Business Manager is an affordable, flexible financial management solution that connects the people, information, and processes that help you manage your business more effectively. Easy to set up, customize, and use, it helps you increase productivity, make informed decisions, and improve business performance.\n\nIdeal for companies that need more than basic accounting software, Small Business Manager offers fully integrated financial management, sales, purchasing, inventory, payroll, and reporting capabilities. It adapts easily to changing needs with increased financial controls, reliable multi-user access, unlimited storage capacity for transactions and records, and the ability to scale as your business grows.\n\nThese changes, across both compensation and distribution, will not include our financial management solutions (Great Plains, Solomon, Navision and Axapta) or our FRx solutions. Continue to use the current Microsoft Business Solutions ordering processes for these products.\n\nA decision to include a business application in Volume Licensing requires an extensive review process because it means changes to channel models, to systems, and to solution pricing. Today, Volume Licensing equates to open distribution and Microsoft Business Solutions currently believes that the best distribution model for global financial management solutions is through a certified channel. When we're able to have the customer and partner benefits of volume licensing, and distribute the global financial management solutions through a certified channel, we will consider a change to the model. In addition, the results from the changes to the Microsoft CRM model will help us better understand the benefits of Volume Licensing to both our customers and partners. Any decisions to include our financial management or FRx solutions in Volume Licensing will be announced at least six months in advance of the change."
