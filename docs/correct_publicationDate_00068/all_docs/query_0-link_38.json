        "text": "‘So when people say that poetry is a luxury, or an option, or for the educated middle classes, or that it shouldn’t be read at school because it is irrelevant, or any of the strange or stupid things that are said about poetry and its place in our lives, I suspect that the people doing the saying have had things pretty easy. A tough life needs a tough language – and that is what poetry is. That is what literature offers – a language powerful enough to say how it is.\n\nIt isn’t a hiding place. It is a finding place.’\n\nJeanette Winterson (courtesy of Nicola Strawbridge)\n\nThe annual compilation of well-loved books on Poetry Shelf has no rules – any country, any genre, any time. Usually I ban any mention of me but Janet Charman snuck in with the first contribution. It is such an off-centre and inspired take on New York Pocket Book, with discomfort, I decided to break my single rule this year.\n\nThanks to everyone who participated and everyone who got back to me. Thanks also to all those who support the blog: publishers, authors, readers.\n\nI have loved so many New Zealand books this year (all the glorious fiction and poetry on both my montages above as my reviews on this blog and for Fairfax attest), but I want to mention a few that aren’t repeated favourites below. Cilla McQueen’s In a Slant Light (OUP). I adore this book because it hit me at so many levels: the way Cilla shines like a diamond when you travel through decades of NZ poetry, the way the memoir lights up what it was like for one groundbreaking woman making her way across the literary terrain of men, the way poetry and memoirs can do so many different things. Frankie McMillan’s My Mother and the Hungarians (CUP) is a sequence of small fictions that would surely entice the most reluctant reader into this genre. Fresh, energised, sparkling. The poems in Brian Turner’s Night Fishing (VUP)are a perfect acoustic chamber for meditation, glimpses of a startlingly beautiful physical world and the necessity of love. Rachel Bush’s Thought Horses (VUP) affected me more than any other book this year. I wrote this on my blog:\n\nRachel’s collection sits on my top shelf with a handful of poetry books that rise above the bulk to become something astonishing. Why? Because the heart is engaged. Because the writing is as contoured and as musical as the world no matter which way you look. Because this book was written so close to death, yet it shows the joy of life in little things, in big things, in ideas, relations, places. We all do this. We all write the world. But Rachel has made the word incandescent and in taking us back into the grit and light of living changes us. If you buy one poetry book this year, make it this one.\n\nMore than anything I have loved hiding away in the archives and reading my way through the books and archival material of early New Zealand women poets: Jessie Mackay, Blanche Baughan, Eileen Duggan, Ursual Bethell for starters. I can take nothing for granted as every reading blasts apart all expectation and simply adds to the prismatic joy of reading and writing poetry.\n\nThese groundbreaking women, who dared to write poetry and dared to speak out, feel like fine foundation stones for NZ literature. I carry them with me now. That Sarah Laing has hit the spotlight in 2016 with her superb graphic memoir, Mansfield and Me, a book that resists formula and is of itself, is a contemporary example of the beacon passed.\n\nAnd this sweetly crafted New-Yorker review of Jamacan poet, Ishion Hutchinson, sent me tracking down his poetry.\n\n(NOTE: I can still add to this list if I have missed you out in my daze. Let me know. Or if I have missed errors. I have no backup staff.)\n\nH a p p y\n\nd a y s\n\nf i n d i n g\n\ntreasure in t h i s\n\nlovingly t e n d e d\n\ntrove.\n\nJohn Adams:\n\nTender Girl by Lisa Samuels (Dusie, 2015) – Fabulous dislocations, lovely disturbances, challenging channels. With oblique referencing of experimentalists from Stein to Hejinian; on an imagined quest broad as Joyce’s Ulysses, Girl is tendered through poetic experiences that any half-shark/half-woman might experience. Glorious reading.\n\nThis Paper Boat by Gregory Kan (AUP, 2016) – My reading of Kan’s collection noted his attentiveness to family. That attentiveness absorbs fragments from Robin Hyde into an individually woven chorus that builds during reading. Lovely, generous, rewarding. Touching.\n\nLucky Punch by Simone Kaho (Anahera Press, 2016) – Kaho speaks in an engaging modern voice, distinctively Pacific Island (Tongan) Kiwi . This important material necessarily navigates a cross-cultural without shedding the universality of its resonances. Kaho’s experience in performance poetry informs her editing of these gems so they sparkle.\n\nJohanna Aitchison:\n\nWhen I started reading Ashleigh Young’s collection of personal essays, Can You Tolerate This? I felt like I did when I first met Emily Perkin’s, Not Her Real Name. Jealous. Ashleigh does back flips. She lands perfectly. She makes it look easy.\n\nI picked up Eduardo C. Corral’s collection, Slow Lightning, when I was in Baltimore visiting a friend. It’s quite old (2012), but it’s a game-changer and utterly relevant given the anti-immigrant racism currently being peddled by He Who Shall Not Be Named. I was stunned by the lusciousness of his English-Spanish blend, in poems that vividly evoke the experience of the Mexican-American immigrant. He colours in lives, which are bilingual and fraught with risk; his titles are long and run-on:\n\nIn Colorado My Father Scoured and Stacked Dishes\n\nIn a Tex-Mex restaurant. His co-workers,\n\nunable to utter his name, renamed him Jalapeño\n\n(you can see the rest of the poem here\n\nPalmerston North has produced some great poetry recently. The local press HauNui put out the Ockham Book Award (2015) finalist, The Night We Ate The Baby, by Tim Upperton. I love Tim’s poetry for his dexterity with form (he does a bloody good villanelle), his offensiveness, and the fact that he is sometimes hilarious. Bryan Walpert is another local who is slaying it (although he’s just ditched us for Auckland) in Native Bird Mākaro Press). As an American transplant he documents the immigrant experience – my particular favourite is ‘Manawatu Aubade.’\n\nIf James K. Baxter and Nicky Minaj had a love child, it would sound something like Courtney Sina Merideth’s poetry. I’m very late for the party, I know, but what a party! Brown Girls in Bright Red Lipstick is a standout for its taut language and slam-poetry sensibility. And, of course, thank God for Hera Lindsay Bird. A self-titled high-low smash hit. Enjoy the ride.\n\nRos Ali:\n\nThe challenges of recent months have brought the solace and strength of poetry once again to the fore. To counter the unease was the joy of some special discoveries:\n\nInventive and intriguing is Canadian writer, Anne Carson’s new collection, Float. Twenty-two individual chapbooks ‘float’ inside a transparent case. The works, poems, essays, lists and reflections may be read sequentially or however the whimsy takes you, inviting connections to each and to the whole. This was initially challenging, then absorbing. Much of the poetry is playful, curious and lyrical. My favourite perhaps, ‘Wildly Constant,’ including the lines of Proust on the kinds of memory: ‘the daily struggle to remember / where we put our reading glasses / and there is the deeper gust of longing / that comes from the bottom / of the heart / involuntarily. / At sudden times. / For surprise reasons.’\n\nAlso playful and rich in scope and colour, is Beside Herself by Chris Price. In this book too, the exploration of selves, of someone else, others, weave connections with each other and the reader. At the heart of this book for me, are the power of voices, and the play of sound, meaning and music, as in ‘Spell for a Child to Remember’ and the lyrical and layered, ‘My Mother as a Tree.’\n\nExploring Jenny Bornholdt’s new collection, Selected Poems, brought the warmth and confidence of re-visiting someone compassionate, gentle and special, with her wisdom and insights into our lives. There is also the reminder that standing tall on my class wall posted high, is Jenny’s, ‘Instructions for how to get ahead of yourself while the light still shines.’\n\nA gift to a dear friend of the new edition of e e cumming’s, I carry your heart with me, with its nifty multi-media illustrations by Mati McDonough, was an assertion of beauty and certainty– and a perfect offering for someone you love, of any age.\n\nFinally, a collection that is beautiful in its heart and craft; a devastating insight into the dying and loss of someone deeply loved. Michael Faber’s, Undying, A Love Story, is a compelling, harrowing and deeply tender journey with his wife in her struggle with multiple myeloma. Honesty and grace prevail. From ‘Barley Fields, Fearn, 16 August, 8 O’Clock’:\n\nThe light is how you like it.\n\nWhere on earth are you? I have gathered\n\nall your shoes together, and the night\n\nmust fall\n\non time.\n\nSerie Barford:\n\nFale Aitu/Spirit House by Tusiata Avia. VUP 2016\n\nI almost missed the launch of Fale Aitu because access to the venue was via a flight of stairs and I was marooned in the vestibule with a broken leg. Then a gallant stranger scooped up my mobilty scooter, leaving me to crawl in his wake until I reached the landing and a view of Tusiata reading “This is a photo of my house”; a poem that entices us past benign pink bricks and a big tree into dangerous zones that harbour imprints of past events and ghosts:\n\n‘I am cutting a big hole in the roof. Look down through the roof, there is the top of the man, you can’t see his face, but see his arm, see it moving fast.\n\nI am removing the outside wall of the bedroom. Look inside, there are the Spirits, that’s where they live.’\n\nTusiata’s poems are fine threads (tusili’i) that link visible and invisible worlds across Time and Space. In Feagaiaga/Covenant we are reminded of the traditional sacred covenant between brother and sister.\n\nMy brother and I are Siamese twins\n\nI graft him to me\n\nhis pyjama holes to my buttons\n\nand we sleep face to face\n\nSpiritual aspects of this covenant were transferred to priests of the new religion – Christianity. It is ‘men of the cloth’ who are now afforded much of the protection, loyalty and honour that historically cloaked Samoan sisters.\n\nCalamity, a critical eye and compassion zig-zag through the collection. We join Tusiata as she frantically drives through broken, flooded streets in search of her daughter after the Christchurch earthquake in “Mafui’e: 22 February 2011”. We feel Tusiata’s anguish in a litany of reasons of why ‘I cannot write a poem about Gaza’ and in familial conflict in ‘Tableau’. We sense a shift of power and perception in ‘I enter my throat and you are there too’:\n\nI flower like ink in water.\n\nI try to feel fury\n\nbut I see you when I close my eyes\n\nliving in your elderly body, the thinly clothed bones\n\nthe soft folds of your skin\n\nyour earlobe melting between my imaginary fingers.\n\nWaybread & Flax by Belinda Diepenheim. Steele Roberts 2015\n\nBelinda Diepenheim grew up in Wellington and worked as a horticulturalist in the Botanic Gardens and Otari Native Plant Museum. She dedicated Waybread & Flax to Janet Charman, who gifted me the collection as a Christmas present because she knows I love poetry and plants and have an elementary knowledge of rongoa – Maori traditional medicine.\n\nThe book is beautifully illustrated with coloured botanical plates and is divided into three sections. The first, “Woden’s nine herbs charms – a 10th century cure” sets the scene with an Anglo-Saxon poem for the treatment of poison and infection by the preparation of nine herbs:\n\nA worm came creeping and tore assunder a man.\n\nThen took Woden nine magick twigs and smote the serpent\n\nthat he in nine pieces dispersed.\n\nMagic, history and medicine entwine. Extracts from the traditional poem head each of Belinda’s contemporary poems, standing like a pou whenua (a carved land post) to mark boundaries and places of significance:\n\nCaramine hirsuta, bittercress\n\nStune is the name of this herb, it grew on stone,\n\nit stands up against poison, it dashes against poison.\n\n…..Tonight fine rain gathers, merges to drops heavy\n\nenough to make the ripe seeds explode from my\n\nsiliques. The woman takes off her hat, hair trickles\n\ndown her back. She shuts her eyes and drinks from\n\na tin flask. Birds roost in hawthorn. The ambiguous\n\nlight sucks colour from blue violets.\n\nThe second section, ‘Voyage out: Cook and the colonists bring plants to New Zealand’ contains poems for introduced plants such as gorse, lavender, roses and wheat. Explorers and colonists sow the new world with old ideas and familiar seed stock.\n\nShe said she’d go to this new land\n\nto build a life, we shall begin again,\n\nbut she’s not leaving home behind.\n\nWill the tulips be allowed to come\n\nover the border of those islands?\n\nThe final section ‘Rongoa – Maori traditional medicine’ showcases Belinda’s love of native plants and her horticultural background without reference to indigenous magic and mystery. There is no mention of Tane, Papatuanuku or any of the gods of Aotearoa who are evoked by rongoa practitioners who connect to plants through Mātauranga Māori (Maori knowledge and comprehension of the visible and invisible universe). It is the colonisers’ pagan and Christian gods who underpin the spiritual connection between plants with humans in this collection. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Waybread & Flax.\n\nLucky Punch by Simone Kaho Anahera Press 2016\n\nSimone’s childhood in the suburb of Waterview is separated from mine by a generation (I’m old enough to be her mother) and a short drive over a causeway that straddles islands and links peninsulas where vegetable gardens, trees and community spaces continue to fall prey to Auckland’s tentacles as the city moves West. In ‘Waterview’ Simone laments:\n\nThe oak tree is gone, the fruit trees; apple, feijoa,\n\npeach, the banana tree which thrust out a pod of fruit one summer\n\nagainst all expectations, finger-length and three times as fat, all\n\ngone. The vegetable garden is covered over with a garage, a\n\nconcrete driveway….\n\nand in ‘Bulls’:\n\n… we never went\n\nback to pick blackberries again and after a few years the bushes were\n\ngone and then so were the bulls.\n\nSimone is Urbanesian without relinquishing her empathy or ancestral connections to Nature:\n\nI don’t know the name of this bush, this plant, this flower or that it\n\ngrew this big, just that it is from the islands… You plucked one of the plain\n\ncreamy flowers for me once and told me to smell it. I carried it in\n\nmy pocket for months, a crumpled wing. (from ‘Still’ )\n\nThere was a red sea on his knee with scalloped skin shores. (from ‘Red Sea’):\n\nHe smiles but his eyes\n\nstay on the wall. It’s a busy wall, mould sprays like faded flowers, a\n\nhook trailing cobwebs, daddy longlegs drifting through squashed\n\nmosquitoes, distant black stars. (from ‘Stars’)\n\nIn ‘Pretty’ Simone is distanced from her Tongan heritage by her “own” people. ‘You’re too pretty to be Tongan,’ yet in ‘Home’ Simone defies her father and insists on staying with her family:\n\nDad didn’t want me to stay with our family in Tonga because there\n\nwas no shower, only a tin bucket.\n\nSimone explores love but doesn’t shy away from violence. In “Sheep” an incarcerated man is beaten by another prisoner for ‘hitting a sheep in the head with shears’ so badly that ‘its eye had come out.’ In ‘Fight’ two males slug it out and in ‘Punching’ the boy who proposed to her when she was four is grown up and about to die;\n\nHenry has so many scars. Some of them are beautiful like the\n\nspidery lattice on his knee from when he went through a sliding\n\ndoor. A white cross on his inner arm from punching a window.\n\nSarah Jane Barnett (Poet and Books Editor for The Pantograph Punch):\n\nThere are three collections that that come to mind when someone asks me to recommend poetry. The first is Gregory Kan’s debut, This Paper Boat (AUP). The collection follows the author as he traces his own history through the lives and written fragments of Iris Wilkinson (aka Robin Hyde), his parents, and their parents. These poems broke my heart and put it back together again. I loved it so much I had to interview Greg about his work.\n\nAnother book that I return to is Claire Orchard’s debut collection, Cold Water Cure (VUP). Claire writes such funny, quietly experimental, and beautifully crafted poems, and her work often reminds me of Jenny Bornholdt. Everyone should read her poem ‘Settling for Action Man.’ Everyone should read this collection.\n\nThe final collection that I loved is Bill Nelson’s debut, Memorandum of Understanding (VUP). Bill and I have been friends and fellow poets for nearly a decade, and I couldn’t wait for this collection to come out. Bill’s poems are funny and strange and often love poems in hiding. The final sequence of poems, ‘How to do just about anything,’ is so, so damn good:\n\nThe dogs will find you first.\n\nEven under the snow\n\nthey can smell the fear and sweat\n\nand polypropylene socks.\n\nYour grandfather can smell it too.\n\nHe pulls you out by the scruff of your neck.\n\nYou are strapped into a pair of skis.\n\nEdward Scissorfeet. Disturbed,\n\neating a sandwich with metal poles\n\ndangling from your arms.\n\n— From, ‘How to do just about anything’ in Memorandum of Understanding\n\nAirini Beautrais:\n\nTusiata Avia’s Fale Aitu: Spirit House was the poetry book I was most excited about in 2016. Tusiata’s work always goes straight to the heart. Hera Lindsay Bird’s eponymous debut gave me lots of belly-laughs, and I think it has earned its popularity. Nick Ascroft’s Back With the Human Condition spoke to the word-lover and the formalist in me; I enjoyed this collection very much. I am very much looking forward to reading Simone Kaho’s recently released sequence of prose poems, Lucky Punch. I also want to mention a non-poetry book by a poet, Helen Lehndorf’s Write to the Centre, something like a guidebook for writing a journal. I think it will prove useful to many poets out there.\n\nFrancesca Benocci:\n\nMy favourite read of 2016 has been Poroporoaki to the Lord My God: Weaving the Via Dolorosa by Anahera Gildea, published by Seraph Press.\n\nAnother favourite read was Dolce Marcescenza (Sweet Decay) and Italian/English bilingual edition by Indian poet Tishani Doshi (this was published in 2015 here you can find an excerpt of the book here.\n\nTail of the Taniwha by Courtney Sina Meredith is not strictly poetry, but it is poetry to me anyway.\n\nI have also worked on and really enjoyed Fale Aitu by Tusiata Avia and Hera Lindsay Bird by Hera Lindsay Bird.\n\nDiana Bridge:\n\nEarlier this year I shared the launch platform at Unity Books with distinguished anthropologist and poet, Michael Jackson. Soon after, I pounced on the poems in his Walking to Pencarrow: selected poems (cold hub press). Reading in order over several nights, I arrived at a richly faceted, variously grounded narrative and a stronger than usual sense of a poet’s voice. This voice is never less than probing and mature, its insights often attractively wry and self-deprecating. Lines studded with images remain entirely accessible. From the beginning, in and out of persona, the poet circles the nature of home and the great attendant themes of belonging and separation. It gives an extra dimension to the poems if you have read the author’s superb memoir, The Accidental Anthopologist.\n\nElizabeth Smither’s poems lie in the bookshelf on the shelf behind my head and I regularly dip in and out of them. There was no new Smither collection this year but I was given the bilingual edition of Best New Zealand Poems 2014 (Wai-te-ata Press, 2016), and found there a gem, ‘Putting a line through addresses’. You can see from the title the writer’s trademark characteristic of starting small, very small here, and swelling to the largest human themes that absorb us. ‘Now the book is so cross-hatched it looks/ like an exercise in defence. Barbed wire/ thrown up, dark obliterated trenches.’\n\nChosen by Vincent O’Sullivan, this small volume is a worthwhile collection, even if you only look at the English on the left-hand side. Translations are by Liang Yujing.\n\nFrench poet Yves Bonnefoy died in Paris in July at the age of 93. Bonnefoy, who was also art critic, translator, essayist and more, wrote a gorgeous hybrid of a book, L’Arrière-pays, translated many decades later into English as The Arrière-pays (Seagull Books, 2012). The translation by poet Stephen Romer is limpid, lyrical and obviously intent on preserving the subleties of the poet’s thought. It is accompanied by reproductions of paintings and author photographs which glance off ideas in a more than ordinarily illustrative dialogue with the search which is the book’s topic. L’Arrière-pays itself turns out to be a conception envisaged as as distant as a Roman outpost in the desert and as up-close as a remembered vision from childhood. It is impossible to capture in a sentence but that is the point of the investigation. After the poet’s death, I read again this not quite classifiable text, extended here by three newer shorter pieces, reading for the beauty of its explorations, its questioning lyrical prose.\n\nJR Prynne is described on the back of his monumental Poems, out last year from Bloodaxe, as ‘Britain’s leading late Modernist poet’. He is tough going because of the syntactic disruption and experimental nature of his work. In fact he is a poet to bend your mind. I am not to grips with the dismantling that occurs in his latest work but a 1969 collection, The White Stones, was reprinted by NYRB this year and I have much enjoyed the tussle with a variously and ingeniously stocked mind and, which is what drew me first, the vibrant, concrete, lyric half- lines and scraps of rather wonderful connection that emerge. It helped to read a fine review of Prynne in Prospect by Jeremy Noel-Tod.\n\nI have been waiting for Australian poet Judith Beveridge’s latest book ever since I read some of the poems to be included in it in a couple of Best Australian Poems. Like others, I wish it had become almost as natural for us to read Australian literature as it is to read our own. Beveridge is up there with the very best.\n\nDevadatta’s Poems (Giramondo Poets, 2014) arrived on my desk just before Paula’s deadline, but long enough to confirm the singular quality of this book. Beveridge comes at her poems from unforseen angles. Sometimes, as here, they emerge from entirely unexpected characters. Following on from her sequence written in the person of the Buddha, she has turned to Devadatta, envisaged here as the Buddha’s jealous cousin, in love with the wife the Buddha abandoned as he set out on his search for enlightenment. Devadatta’s voice is sensual and grounded in the dirt and joys of earth. His view of the world is a Shakespearian blend of comic, touching and sinister. His narrative is envisaged with breath-taking assurance and mastery of detail. The texture of Beveridge’s writing is as lush as grass, her structures as spare, compressed and uncompromising as the line of a tree stripped by fire. She is my favourite Australian poet.\n\nDiane Brown:\n\nPoetry Reading (but not writing) has been a bit neglected this year, dropped for the lure of planning a trip, then travelling. I always travel with the best of intentions to keep reading but then I’m diverted by sights and, of course, newspapers – especially in the UK, and then my head is so filled with horror at what might become of us that poetry is lost. I did read again W.B. Yeats’s ’The Second Coming’ and wished it did not seem so relevant.\n\nPhilip and I did go to a reading in London by Michel Faber who talked about his poetry collection, Undying, which is about the slow death of his beloved wife, Eva. Such a lovely intelligent man, he applies his ex-nurse’s unflinching eyes and tenderness towards the terrible ravages bone marrow cancer inflicts upon Eva. The poems are so devastating, I am reading them slowly and alone. The language is appropriately raw: ‘Your ashes are heavy/ More than I thought.’ A fine tribute to Eva and a testimony to enduring love.\n\nThe Old Woman, the Tulip and the Dog by Alicia Suskin Ostriker, in which an old woman, a tulip and a dog all give their view on a variety of subjects, was a real treat. The old woman looks back on her life with wry amusement, the sexy tulip is a little narcissistic, always aware of her beauty, the dog is very doglike and accepts whatever comes his way: ‘Time to take a nap/ says the dog.’ Full of psychological wisdom, simply but elegantly expressed and occasionally laugh out loud.\n\nAnd it is a real pleasure to talk about As The Verb Tenses, by Lynley Edmeades, which is long-listed for the Ockham Book Awards. It’s a listing richly deserved for its vivid childhood memories and witty exploration of contemporary life. Above all, it’s a cohesive collection which pays acute attention to language, composition and sound in poems which take the reader into the moment with terrific clarity. Lynley has a quiet, confident and mature voice, wise in the ways of friendship and love and longing. There’s no showing off, in a look at me way, but there’s plenty to show off. From ‘Picture’:\n\nThere we were\n\ndoing that family-thing together\n\nlolling about in a shortage of adjectives\n\nwhere truth lurked behind\n\nwhat was said.\n\nMarion Castree (Vic Books):\n\nI have enjoyed thoroughly many poems published this year and their quality of production. However I realise I have not read any volumes completely. I have chosen one of my all-time favourite poets whose books I have read again & again. It’s really timely to have a ‘Selected Poems’ appear this year. I have not mentioned all her prizes and accolades. Put them if if it’s appropriate.\n\nSelected Poems\n\nJenny Bornholdt\n\nVUP\n\nBornhold’s poems are renowned for their pitch perfect, word perfect pared down delivery. Her poems are always a pleasure from first reading to multiple moments over the years and sharing with others. Ever since her first volume, This Big Face, I was smitten. Someone once commented, she makes the personal universal. I don’t know how she does it and I am happy with the mystery. She is also very very funny.\n\nIt gives me enormous pleasure to now have a copy of the newly published Selected Poems. It would have bee a hard task to compile.\n\nCongratulations to VUP, Deborah Smith for the author and cover photos, and Dexter Murray for the cover design on such a splendid queenly edition.\n\nJanet Charman:\n\nNew York Pocket Book, Paula Green, Seraph Press, 2016.\n\nWaybread and Flax, Belinda Diepenheim, Steele Roberts, 2015\n\nMan Alone, John Mulgan, 1939, Penguin Books, 2010\n\nDisclaimer: Paula said I could write about whatever books I liked in this end of year comment. And I am taking her at her word. I make no apology for the unmediated subjectivity of these remarks.\n\nIn her latest poetry collection New York Pocket Book (Seraph Press, 2016) Paula introduces the feminine persona Josephine. I read this as an instance of an artist’s refusal to deny in their work, the symbolic presence of the ‘archaic woman m/Other’. But in adopting this “feminine” persona Paula also automatically disqualifies herself from contention as the Genius-Hero.\n\nThat is because the Genius-Hero is in reality the Ego, as structured by the Oedipus complex. And for Bracha Ettinger the theorist of the Matrixial domain, it is thus by definition, male. ‘Anyone male or female who takes upon him – or herself this hero configuration becomes by definition a man who eliminates the archaic Woman-m/Other.….As long as this pattern of that hero is the only possible model, only a dead woman-artist or a woman artist that is in principle out of the procreation cycle, can become such a “genius” and represent the creative symbolic begetter.’ (Ettinger, severally, 2006,174.5)\n\nAfter refusing the terms of the ‘Genius-Hero complex’, as Paula does by asserting the explicitly feminine persona she adopts in her collection, what is she left to work with, as an artist, in order to occupy the position of the ‘creative symbolic begetter’?\n\nIn fact there is another route to the role of ‘creative symbolic begetter’. Bracha Ettinger considers that ‘the concept of the matrix moves the womb from nature to culture, making it the basis for a supplementary feminine difference that is the human potentiality for a shareability and a co-poiesis where no “hero” can become creative alone.’ (Ettinger, 2006, 180.1) So this matrixial-feminine potentiality is one that men can jointly share.\n\nAs Paula’s Josephine wends her way around Manhattan, she encounters at every turn the talismans, detritus and iconography of those who have passed this way before her: John Ashbery, Emily Dickinson, Alice Notley, Barbara Guest, Frank O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov…Josephine pokes through their museums and refuels at their diners, snatches close-ups of the tools they used and values the minutiae of their lives. All as found at the heart of the monumental US empire in which, as artists, they strove and struggled. It’s company that is never cozy since these meetings are conducted in the matrixial spirit in which the “unknown other” is an object, but in self-fragilization, a subject also. In this borderlinking, Josephine dares to twitch ‘the hems of men’s intellectual coat tails’; to meet the dispossessed of Europe; to register losses that in a caught breath are ‘still, unbearable in fact,/ a daughter or son’.\n\nAs a poet Paula Green is adamantly not, either in practice or ‘in principle out of the procreation cycle’. So those of her readers more used to the appetites of the Oedipal Ego, may hardly know what to make of the [un]heimlich and transgressively maternal ‘milk of childhood’ she serves here.\n\nThe poetry collection Waybread and Flax by my friend Belinda Diepenheim (Steele Roberts 2016) is a discussion of colonization as voiced through the personified plants that have insinuated themselves into our wild places, gardens, lives and memories. Who invited them? Nobody. What did they find when they arrived? A scene made strange by their very presence. And yet in these poems these interlopers speak as if they have always belonged in this place – “as if” – indeed!\n\nThis collection positions its-self as a kind of ‘Where’s Wally?’– ‘Where’s Waari? of the natural world, with each freaky, yet suddenly recognizable figure in it, then subjected to a gradient of equivocal evaluation. Is this really my dear old enemy? Why has it changed its name? Hmmm…perhaps it’s my longstanding colleague in disguise. A plant that before I can pull it out, presses forward to shake my hand with compelling authority – as it picks my pocket and my brains.\n\nLast of all, before the glossary, there is the Rongoa – Maori traditional medicine. These particular poems recognize in all asperity that custodianship of the land does not imply ownership of it. Poem-plants that despite their mourning and displacement have forgotten nothing the reader cares to remember.\n\nBelinda’s collection wasn’t submitted to the Ockham this year because the prize’s rescheduling could not accommodate her publishers’ own time frames. This is a badly missed opportunity for all. The book’s wonderful full colour illustrations offer eloquent testimony both to Roger Steele’s confidence in the collection and to the leading role his publishing house is taking in showcasing Aotearoa New Zealand talent.\n\nFinally, I have spent most of this year reading and writing about Man Alone. Unearthing from a Matrixial perspective the buried homoerotic subtext of this extraordinary pre-WW2 Aotearoa New Zealand novel by John Mulgan. It has gripped my imagination in a way that continues to astonish me.\n\nI had thought to encounter in it a woman-extinguishing ‘Genius-hero’. Instead I heard a wholly subversive voice offering subtextual access to the matrixial feminine and offering an accompanying wit(h)ness to the ‘archaic woman m/Other’ as creative symbolic begetter.\n\nWorks cited: Ettinger, Bracha, (2006) The Matrixial Borderspace, University of Minnesota Press.\n\nGina Cole:\n\nFale Aitu/Spirit House Tusiata Avia\n\nOne of my favourite poems in this collection is ‘Demonstration’. I had the pleasure of hearing Tusiata perform ‘Demonstration’ at the National Writers Forum in Auckland in September 2016. It is a poem about rape. At the end, her voice gets louder and louder. She told us she didn’t go full volume like she usually does when she performs this piece in a theatre. We were in a lecture hall in the Owen G Glenn building at the University of Auckland – not so sound proof. It is a powerful piece. This whole collection spoke powerfully to me as a woman of the Pasifika diaspora, ‘We are the diasporas’. I also appreciated the international flavor ‘I cannot write a poem about Gaza’ (…behind that human shield- is a human), ‘Manahatta’ about the indigenous Lenape/Algonquin people of New York. Passionate, political, Pasifikan poetry/\\.\n\nHera Lindsay Bird Hera Lindsay Bird\n\nI like the deliberate and unselfconscious metapoetic stream throughout this wonderful collection. Sometimes I laughed aloud at the cleverly juxtaposed imagery. I also found myself reading out passages to whoever was around me at the time, as I felt it essential that they hear. As an unabashed sci-fi nut, I did enjoy ‘Planet of the Apes’ and the ending with the same image as the original movie, of the Statue Liberty in ruins. I also loved ‘The Ex-Girlfriends Are Back From The Wilderness’ and its ending down ‘the waxed fuck-off chute’. Funny, brave and exciting poetry.\n\nTim Corballis:\n\nI confess (can I confess this?) to not being much of a poetry reader, and not being a heavy reader at all. I’m picky, grumpy, slow and only read a few books every year. So my list would contain only one item, not quite poetry, but not far off it either:\n\nLászló Krasznahorkai’s 2008 novel, or short story collection if you prefer, Seiobo There Below (translated 2014). The chapters are, with one exception, each composed of a single, long sentence. Art and artists often feature—they’re perhaps a little too tortured, a little too much of the romantic genius, but this was redeemed for me by the language, which drives forward through beautiful, image-rich compositions of movement and stillness, always finding release at some conclusion, bleak or exultant. The opening chapter places a single, unmoving stork (I think) waiting for prey in a river at the centre of all of the meaningless commotion of the city. This is kept up for the length of the chapter until the bird strikes, and the result is exhilarating. It also sets the scene for much of what follows: the distinction between frenzied activity and the intense focus of the artist. It’s almost a work of negative theology I guess, of a humanity in need of redemption but unlikely to find it anywhere, not in art, not in nature, not in religion. Required reading.\n\nLynn Davidson:\n\nBecause I have been away; because I haven’t read enough of the new NZ poetry this year to compile a list; because some of the new collections that I want to read are on their way to the Scottish Poetry Library but haven’t got there yet, I thought I would focus on just one book that I have read and loved this year. It’s a book that made it into the tiny pile of books I brought with me to Edinburgh: Thought Horses by Rachel Bush. It’s such an interesting book that thinks about thinking – the opening poem introduces the ‘thought horses’ that ‘ride over and look at you’ with their ‘big protruding eyes’ when you are trying to sleep. It often mentions sleep and dreams, desire and the cost of desire, and death of course. Rachel died of cancer just after the publication of this book. But it’s a lively book. It’s a book that flashes with light.\n\nRachel was a curious, intelligent reader, and Thought Horses is woven through not just with references to the works of writers from Ovid to Beckett to Anne Carson, but with the rhythms of their lines. And they are there purposefully, thoughtfully. They draw towards the thing at the centre of the book, the coming of death. In ‘Quick and Good’ the line ‘Lente lente currite noctis equi’ from Ovid’s ‘Amore’ asking the horses pulling Time’s chariot to slow down, appears alongside the January sun, the mizuma rocket and the iceberg lettuce and with the clatter of the rescue helicopter flying overhead. Although the line’s weightiness is somewhat undercut by the line before it, ‘until I call out by mistake’, it is chilling to hear the lament that Time’s chariot is going too fast with the clatter of the rescue helicopter in the background. The poems of Thought Horses are unafraid to be afraid. They are intelligent, gritty and loving. And they are funny. In ‘Hands and Birds’, the last poem in the book, Rachel writes about giving the left hand a turn at things, like ‘actively’ washing ‘a few dinner plates’, not just holding them, or having a go at writing: ‘If I insist, it will hold the pen. Slowly, with great and/ clumsy emotion, it will make large, just legible letters.’ Bravo Rachel Bush. I wish you were still with us.\n\nEmily Dobson:\n\nThe thing I loved reading most this year was H is for Hawk by Helen MacDonald.\n\nDoc Drumheller:\n\nSeven Notebooks, by Campbell McGrath. I had the pleasure to meet Campbell at the Granada International Poetry festival in Nicaragua last year. We exchanged books, and I have become a big fan of his work. In Seven Notebooks, Campbell combines poetry with journal entries that link to his family, observations of the USA, and his work as a lecturer at the Florida International University in Miami, in particular teaching a seminar on Neruda, and Whitman. There are odes to The Blueberry, The Plantar Fascia, and to Bureaucrats; dedications to Walt Whitman, as well as Basho, Issa, and haiku entries combined with prose. A familiarity with the aforementioned poets’ work, (especially Neruda’s odes, Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, and Specimen Days, the Haiku of Issa, and Basho, and Basho’s Narrow Road to the Interior) helps to understand how Campbell creates such a beautiful narrative of his life over the span of one year. His incredible imagination is matched by his tremendous vocabulary, which is complimented by his humour and humanity. I read this book in 2015, and read it again in 2016, and several poems I have read numerous times, it was my standout favourite read last year, and still is in 2016.\n\nNicola Easthope:\n\nPoetry I’ve loved this year includes Janet Frame’s The Goose Bath (a collection of ‘leftover’ poems published posthumously – so good, I had to reread them), Rangi Faith’s divine Rivers without Eels, snapped up second hand from Down under Books in Picton, and Bill Manhire’s Collected Poems, which accompanied and comforted me through a death in the family, mega earthquake(s), and an astonishingly large load of marking in Terms 3 and 4. I also imbibed Anatomize and Triptych Caliform – Natasha Dennerstein’s colourfully striking collections, Poroporoaki for the Lord My God: Weaving the Via Dolorosa – Anahera Gildea’s sublime work of ekphrasis in hand-bound chapbook form, and Everything is here – Rob Hack’s engaging debut.\n\nTeaching Year 13 and Scholarship English gives me the chance to bring new texts to enthusiastic young readers, and they are just as likely to recommend me texts they love as I am to them. We have been most moved and impressed by Tina Makereti’s novel Where the Rekohu Bone Sings (top student says enviously, “Oh, how does she write so stonkingly well?”), and the anthology Octavia’s Brood – Sci-Fi stories from social justice movements, inspired by Octavia Butler’s works – a must for any teacher wanting to diversify their dystopian selection. My students lament how there just isn’t enough life left to get through all the books they want to read… I nod supportively, and, at one’s insistence, add Noam Chomsky’s On Anarchy to the summer reading list.\n\nLynley Edmeades:\n\nMouth: Eats Colour, by Sawako Nakayasu with Chika Sagakawa\n\nThis is a wonderfully vibrant collection of what Nakayasu calls “translations, anti-translations and originals.” Nakayasu translates and un-translates some works of the modernist Japanese poet Chika Sagawa. It circulates in and upon itself, showing the impossibilities of translation and both the flexibility and the inflexibility of language.\n\nHow to be Dead in a Year of Snakes, by Chris Tse\n\nInnovative and original, Tse’s first book of poetry is effectively a book length poem exploring his Chinese ancestry in Aotearoa. One of the poems reads, “a slip of the tongue could demolish/entire histories,” which seems to capture something of the sentiment of the book. A beautiful meditation.\n\nFale Aitu | Spirit House, by Tusiata Avia\n\nMy pick of the year. I’ve enjoyed Avia’s work for a while now, but she just seems to be getting better. This collection is raw and real and honest and funny and brave. I can’t recommend it enough.\n\nMurray Edmond:\n\nJohn Dickson’s Mister Hamilton (Auckland University Press, 2016) – erudite and ironic, droll and tender, demotic and alarmed. There are two poems titled ‘Doubtful Sound’ and Dickson is very good at producing ‘doubtful sound.’ The book is full of ‘lost things’ – old soldiers, dead Manapouri tunnellers, drunks in flash clobber, ageing steel workers from Prague, Southland rock ’n roll. ‘The persistence of football results on Bealey Ave’ reminds me of the plays of the mid-twentieth century Russian playwright Aleksander Vampilov – both writers are “no longer over-stayers in the land of promises.” Dickson might be right in ascribing the acronym UAV (Urban Assault Vehile) to me; he is certainly right to propose of the poet R.A.K.Mason, “Long may his verses be read.” I agree. Perhaps we can speak of a Mason-Dickson Line in New Zealand poetry.\n\nDickson’s book contains an entertaining poem in 11 sections: ‘Sixties relic surveys his lawn.’ Lawn-mowing is at the heart of Kiwi culture, the epitome of the colonial enterprise, the national desire to reduce the whole country to a mat of level green grass where everyone can kick a footy round. Olivia Macassey has got the idea too: “lawnmowers rising from their Sunday/ graves and whining.” Her first book of poems, The Burnt Hotel (Titus Books), which came out in 2015, but escaped my notice, is also about ‘lost things’ – “this is the way the world forgets to end” – as she mockers up the margins of society and, frighteningly, those trapped and forgotten in oubliettes where “the endless thereness of here has ended.” Sometimes abject, sometimes hilarious, sometimes incantatory, there are pleasures here: I’m grateful for her invention of ‘epistemohaemophilia’ and the sardonic exuberance of ‘The cunt poem.’\n\nAnother first book that will reward is Wes Lee’s Shooting Gallery (Steele Roberts, 2016). She knows about violence: “my flatemate appeared in the hall/covered in blood of his own making.” But also about love: a pair of lovers hunting a flea together in bed makes for a comic, erotic dance (pace John Donne). “The body is where you begin” could be a tag for this whole book of short sharp poems that knock against your skull. There’s a woman living in a car, there’s a clown living in you, there’s a couple living in a barn with a dog and a boar, there’s a memory living in a hotel, there’s a self living in a mirror. Transcendental this is not. A book stuffed with tough stuff.\n\nAlmost all the poems in Sudesh Mishra’s The Lives of Coat Hangers (Otago University Press, 2016) are busy transcending. Mishra makes a floating world, borne up by his “capacious muse.” That muse loves to be paradoxical, contrary, contradictory, absurd, anachonistic and to prod you with koan-like incitements: the is-ness of the improbable, the karma of the just-so. We are transported everywhere all over the world: Hanuman’s poor heart, Yudhishthira’s dog, Lorca’s death, Hektor’s Troy, Basho’s moon. Occasionally, as in the longer poem ‘Page’ political realities ground the playfulness.\n\nAnd the publishers: Auckland University Press; Titus Books; Steele Roberts; Otago University Press. Praise to them for putting out the poetry. Mishra’s, with its John Pule cover, is generously formatted, with lots of white paper. Dickson’s is modest, contained, plain, as befits. Macassey’s elegant, wide format cradles her long lines. Lee has done her own art work for the cover, some sitting ducks to aim for.\n\nJohanna Emeney:\n\nMichel Faber’s Undying: A Love Story is an arresting, upsetting book that does not shy away from the ugliness of illness. Faber tells the story of his wife’s death from myeloma in a series of poems that interweave medical and lyrical language. One example is “Lucencies”, a poem in which Faber contemplates the ill-fittingness of the soft, beautiful-sounding name for “those pale glows/revealed by radiography” signalling the cancer’s spread: “these ghostly holes embedded in your skull, / your humerus, your pelvis and your spine.”\n\nLater, in “Lucencies (2)”, Faber rights the wrong of a noun so connotative of light and brightness having being used in this medical context; he reclaims it for the personal world by setting it to work as the title of an elegy. This time, the “lucencies” become the traces left in the world of his wife’s goodness and kindness:\n\nBut you left lucencies of grace\n\nSecreted in the world,\n\nStill glowing.\n\nFrantumaglia: A Writer’s Journey, featuring various writings of Elena Ferrante is an essential book for any Neapolitan Tetralogy fan. Ferrante reveals many ideas surrounding her craft and process, and a lot of the correspondence between her and her editor is rich in Ferrante’s vignettes of childhood, as well as her considered responses to intelligent, poignant questions from Sandra Ozzola.\n\nC.K. Stead’s latest book of stories The Name on the Door Is Not Mine is remarkable for some new works, and a number of revisions of old stories. I particularly enjoyed a small psychological thriller called “Anxiety”, and the first story, “A small apartment in the rue Parrot”, which has all the customary Stead ingredients—wit, good characters, credible, bantering dialogue, plus a pleasing blend of New Zealand and European sensibilities.\n\nSeraph Press continues to produce original books of high quality, and Maukatere: Floating Mountain by Bernadette Hall, with drawings by Rachel O’Neill, is one of those. It is not only very innovative and attractive, with its multiple voices and different structures and styles, it is experimental and inspiring, too—a pleasure to read, and to hold in the hands.\n\nLastly, Annual from Gecko Press (edited by Kate De Goldi & Susan Paris) has to be the best thing to happen to Australasian Middle School-age children’s literature in ages (that and Tracy Lacy Is Completely Coo-coo Bananas). What a varied, fun, sophisticated book for young people. Annual is not only the result of many talented NZ writers and illustrators being brought together by judicious editors, it is the result of money being spent wisely on this sector of NZ readers, who richly deserve this kind of stunningly presented product.\n\nRiemke Ensing:\n\nI no longer even try to keep up with all the new publications. The house is full of poems, and books – poetry and otherwise – collected over the many years, hold up the walls of the house and could make a small shop if one had the energy or inclination.\n\nIt’s reassuring to be able to reach out to a favourite friend and sit down to read – after spending time in the garden, for instance, which at the moment needs a lot of work, having been, like everything else around me, neglected for a good while. Ursula Bethell (1874-1975) for example, whose Collected Poems edited by Vincent O’Sullivan is still on my wish list. Bethell is an enduring poet who keeps one focussed on the fact that ‘Everything is for a very short time.’\n\nI came across her again just recently in Toss Woollaston’s Sage Tea which has a chapter on ‘Miss Bethell’. Almost invariably now, when I’m ‘earnestly digging’ I contemplate the fact ‘that in a very little while / The Mother of all will take charge again / And soon wipe away with her elements / Our small fond human enclosures.’ ‘Fond’ as in foolish as well, probably, which again makes me wonder whether there is any point in slaving away trying to stake tomatoes against the wind or keeping the beans watered when soon they’ll be available for tuppence ha’penny in the shops.\n\nNew books do come my way and nothing could be more marvellous and totally unexpected than to have a volume of new poems by Vincent O’Sullivan dedicated to and inscribed ‘with decades of affection and respect to an admired writer.’\n\nAnd so it is came by post in April, less than a millisecond away it seemed, from the richly packed Selected Poems: Being Here (2015), the short story collection Families (2014) and the still being relished and stickered with coloured markers Us, then (poems 2013). Where does the man get so much energy, so much connectedness, so much ‘taking in’? ‘You’d scarcely expect / it to think of something fresh each morning’ but like the Irving Berlin song (‘Even better when it’s whistled’ for Ross, p.72) ‘when the song’s / ended, there’s no life out there to go back to, / only to start again’.\n\nThe title poem probably sums it up. ‘If you’re up at six the beginning of this brilliant morning /Everything is clear as if pared on light’s sharpest knife edge’ and then you read and watch and listen and feel the sensuous ‘wind stroking the flank /of a hill, the hill looking as though / each grain of it knew the beauty / of what it looked like, stroked: (“Enough Surely?” For Meg and Alex, p.23).\n\nAlan Roddick’s new collection Getting it Right – poems 1968-2015 also resonated.\n\nThis, in part, is a letter I wrote to him after having spent some time with the volume.\n\nI started at the back – as I usually to do with poetry books – and immediately found a great deal to relate to. In fact I was struck by the fact that we had been thinking along similar lines and have quite a few things in common – not least that we both landed here at impressionable ages and came from Protestant backgrounds – although luckily my parents had already lapsed and it was only my paternal grandmother (grandfather was more joyful) who ‘kept the faith’.\n\nLike you, I too have been revisiting my childhood and there were many echoes in your poems that moved me a great deal. Reading them made me disagree somewhat with the ‘cool’ poet Karl Stead makes you out to be. Certainly I didn’t feel that ‘reserve’ and implied distance he suggested on the back cover. For me, it was all very close.\n\nYou made that part of your life live poignantly right there on the page as though it was all happening this very moment, and, as readers, we were transported back to those frequently harsh and sad times. The title poem, written ‘In gratitude to Seamus Heaney’ captures so well that dreadful sense of separation so artificially and determinedly created by misguided ideas of national loyalty or history – and at such costs. ‘A James? Perhaps, but not a Seamus.’ How sad can it get? And then the realization at the end. ‘Years later then, transplanted /to this far side of the world,/ when I first found your words / I knew my childhood’s landscape in your people, your place names, / and learned for the first time / how we failed to make it our home.’ The dreadful irony of it all.\n\nThat poem, ‘Getting it Right’ particularly reminded me also of Kendrick Smithyman whose poems I’ve been re-reading, but whose Dwarf With A Billiard Cue remains a favourite and more especially that stunning poem ‘After Zhivago’.\n\n‘Anywhere between people fences and spaces, / some style or other of forbidding or defeat. / If I stand at a point where fences meet, / I can look to another corner. Is that you / over there? Truly, is that you? / To cross a field, sometimes it isn’t easy.’\n\nThank you Alan for giving us this new collection of poems. Kevin (Cunningham) would certainly love the one you wrote about him for Charlotte, and didn’t Gregory make a splendid cover? He too got it just right.\n\nLaurence Fearnley:\n\nDuring the past couple of months I have been reading poetry for two projects. The first of these relates to an anthology of New Zealand Mountaineering Writing I am co-editing with Paul Hersey. Mountaineering and poetry are deeply connected and it has been a real pleasure to encounter such a wide range of work from well-known poets including William Pember Reeves, Arnold Wall, Fleur Adcock, Jack Lasenby, Sam Hunt, Rhian Gallagher, Brian Turner, Sara Knox, Caoilinn Hughes and others alongside writing by mountaineers — such as poems in hut books, journals, bulletins and the like. The more personal project I am working on relates to landscape and scent and I have been making notes of novels and poems that mention perfume, scent or smell. Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself” is a particularly rich source: “…the shelves are crowded with perfumes/ I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it…” Paula Green’s wonderful New York Pocket Book includes a ‘smell’ poem, ‘The New York Times’. This has been one of my favourite books of 2016. The protagonist, Josephine, is alert and because of this the poems manage to capture not only visual details but also the sounds and smells and motion of the city. It’s very clever and catches the traveller’s experience of sitting on the edge, watching others while seeing yourself.\n\nCatriona Ferguson:\n\nI’ve been taking comfort in E.E. Cummings of late.\n\nSue Fitchett:\n\nIt’s been a pleasure this year to return to a New Zealand poet of another era – Lauris Edmond, because of my involvement in an anthology project. ‘Mindfulness’ is taught as a therapy in the 21st century. Lauris had the perceptiveness and craft to create poems that are the essence of ‘mindfulness’. Her poems often ‘speak’ of a moment with the same fresh intense experience as they did when she penned them. I am right there when I read: ‘I saw a woman in a car/opening her mouth as wide as the sky‘ (‘Epiphany’ – Selected Poems 1984)\n\nSome collections I dip into in the year of their publication, then come back to for a deeper, quieter read. A collection that grew on me during 2016 is Roger Horrocks Song of the Ghost in the Machine (VUW 2015). Horrocks, tired of contemporary loose free verse, has created a very different collection – meditative, philosophic, riddled with the author’s idea sources and adhering to his own unique 2 rule form. Despite many differences I find myself remembering William Carlos Williams as I re-read, especially, Horrocks’s meditation on walking ……’my body is dated equipment/and I ride it as though I borrowed it/for the day taking its senses on a test flight‘ (pg 8). This put in me in mind of exhorting lines from Williams’ Paterson V: ‘WALK in the world/(you can’t see anything/from a car window. ‘ Both poets have made the connection between walking and seeing. Both poets are experimenters/ innovators and break/broke the rules of their time. Both are poets whose work grows on me over time. William Carlos Williams’s Kora in Hell – Improvisations, which among other things includes reverie, philosophizing and aphorisms, was not well received at the time of publication (1920). It is pleasing that Roger Horrocks Song of the Ghost in the Machine has received acclaim in 2016 and for me, to quote Horrocks, (it is) ‘a candle in a dark room, straining to illuminate the corners.’\n\nCharlotte Gibbs (editor ToiToi):\n\nOne of my highlights of 2016 was meeting New Zealand poet Kerrin P Sharpe through Toitoi. I went to the book launch of her third collection of poetry Rabbit Rabbit (VUP, 2016) and also met many of her wonderful young creative writing students. I love her poetry. It is sharp-witted and big-hearted and open to possibility, like Kerrin herself.\n\nI really loved Upstream by American poet Mary Oliver (Penguin, 2016). It is a series of deeply personal essays about her life, her art, her heroes (Whitman, Poe, Emerson, Wordsworth) and her connection to the natural world. She is an advocate of attention, sympathy and empathy, and her work is an example of the richness and steadfastness of an inner life. I read it in one sitting and found it deeply moving. Here is a favourite passage:\n\nI don’t mean it’s easy or assured; there are the stubborn stumps of shame, grief that remains unsolvable after all the years, a bag of stones that goes with one wherever one goes and however the hour may call for dancing and for light feet. But there is, also, the summoning world, the admirable energies of the world, better than anger, better than bitterness and, because more interesting, more alleviating. And there is the thing that one does, the needle one plies, the work, and within that work a chance to take thoughts that are hot and formless and to place them slowly and with meticulous effort into some shapely heat-retaining form, even as the gods, or nature, or the soundless wheels of time have made forms all across the soft, curved universe — that is to say, having chosen to claim my life, I have made for myself, out of work and love, a handsome life.\n\nTwo of my other favourite reads of the year are books about books. I liked James Wood’s The Nearest Thing to Life (Brandeis University Press, 2015) which came out of the Mandel Lectures in the Humanities that he gave in April 2013. It is a mixture of memoir and criticism in which he encourages “serious noticing” and “using everything” in both reading and writing. I love the way Wood writes about literature and what it can tell us about life.\n\nI also enjoyed Robert Gottlieb’s memoir Avid Reader (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2016) chronicling his adventures in New York publishing. It tells behind-the-scenes stories of many of the biggest novels in the 20th century and I couldn’t put it down.\n\nAnahera Gildea:\n\nThe two standout books for me this year were A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara and Puna Wai Korero, edited by Reina Whaitiri and Robert Sullivan.\n\nA Little Life is a bona fide tome and has been widely criticised for heaping one bleak thing upon another until its inevitable and desperate end but don’t let the naysayers deter you. I loved it. The language was rich, stunning and deeply accomplished; the kind that both delights and surprises you in its sheer mastery. I enjoy books that are unafraid to rip into the complicated and often dark side of the human psyche, and if that’s you, then I can’t recommend this enough.\n\nPuna Wai Korero was published in 2014 and spans the entire history of poetry written in English by Māori authors, starting with Apirana Ngata in 1904. It is a privilege to read and hear the voices of so many of our Māori poets, whispering and commenting on every aspect of life through the last one hundred-plus years. It’s a brief sojourn through a century of New Zealand Māori prosody in response to a radically changing world.\n\nCan you tolerate this? by Ashleigh Young is a collection of insightful and nuanced lyric essays that are deeply personal and incredibly brave in their revelations. Of all the books I read this year, this is the one that inspired me most to write (and speak with a Texan drawl). Every essay in the book is fresh and intimate, making it feel like your sister is huddled up next to you and the two of you are sharing secrets.\n\nHera Lindsay Bird’s much lauded book of poetry was satisfyingly irreverent and able to poke intelligent fun at the establishment, all the while delivering a selection of really outstanding poems. It’s exciting to read a book of poetry that has its blood so close to the surface and I will wait with anticipation for more from her.\n\nNic Low is a New Zealand Māori writer living in Australia, who’s book of short stories, Arms Race was an unexpected surprise. Story after story delivered clever, fun and witty commentaries on contemporary issues ranging from discrimination to octopi without batting an eyelid. It’s a fantastic read that both titillates and educates.\n\nThe last book I’d like to mention was one I picked up in a second hand shop and had not heard of before. It was Vivienne Plumb’s The Diary as a Positive in Female Adult Behaviour (1999) and it was an utter delight. It’s clear my preference is for books that like to imply the proverbial middle finger using beautiful prose and with intelligent commentary.\n\nBernadette Hall:\n\nPororpororaki by Anahera Gildea, published by Seraph Press. Sub-titled, Weaving the Via\n\nDolorosa, it’s a response to McCahon’s Walk (Series C). I love this little book for its stillness,\n\nits simplicity and its beauty. Each page is a contemplative space with a few lines, Maori\n\ninterwoven with English. The poems are described as forming a kahu-kuri, a dog-skin\n\ncloak, a funeral offering: ‘I have just now taken it off the line and / folded it with the sun\n\nstill fresh on its limbs’. As the world’s noise and hurtle threaten to overwhelm (it’s only\n\njust December yet for weeks already they’ve been selling us Christmas), a simple\n\nstatement of faith and love like this seems very precious.\n\nHera Lindsay Bird by Hera Lindsay Bird, published by VUP. I have to laugh even as I type\n\nthe double banger handle. This book is the world’s noise and hurtle. And I love it. It’s a\n\nshot in the arm, a breath of fresh air, a defribillator recharging our poetic pacemaker. It’s\n\nclever and quick and wise and hilarious. It’s tender and anxious as well as outrageous. ‘My\n\nhate is a genial hate with “a modern-vintage aesthetic “/ like clocking someone with a\n\nnon-stick frying pan’. There you go. As I said when I was invited to speak at the launch of\n\nthis book, I can see, in the future, Hera Lindsay Bird taking Hera Lindsay Bird on a\n\nwonderful ride, probably world-wide or at least to Australia. And people will look up and\n\nwave their arms, their hair flying and big grins on their faces, just like in a Quentin Blake\n\nillustration. And they’ll all feel so alive.\n\nFale Aitu / Spirit House by Tusiata Avia, published by VUP. This is a wonderful book,\n\nTusiata’s third and her best, I believe. It’s as if she’s stepped out from behind the mask of\n\nthe Bingo Bingo girl, away from broken English, away from the small stage of a Pacific\n\nIsland (of which New Zealand is one among many) and out into the big wide world where\n\nshe’s taking her place proudly and impressively as an international artist. ‘I cannot write a\n\npoem about Gaza’ is extraordinary, it burns on the page. As does ‘Apology,’ another litany\n\nwith a similar devastating authority: ‘My body is the Qur’an, the Torah / my body is the\n\nChrist / my body is the prophetess, the Samoan goddess of war’. The poet is fearless. The\n\nworld enters her and she welcomes it, the broken bits, the wild bits and the laughter.\n\nWhat’s not to love here? We should be very proud of her.\n\nThere were lots of other books I’ve loved reading. Especially Lila by Marilynne Robinson and The History of Silence Lloyd’s latest. And Damien’s Max Gate and + and + and.\n\nSiobhan Harvey:\n\nThere were so many wonderful, addictive poetry collections published in New Zealand last year, it’s proven a very hard task to choose just a few of those I loved reading:\n\nPaula Green, New York Pocket Book, Seraph Press\n\nI love the way the poems in this book transport the reader through word and energy to the beating heart of the Big Apple. And the orange/pink pocketbook Seraph Press design is just cool.\n\nKerrin P Sharpe, Rabbit Rabbit, Victoria University Press\n\nSharpe is a sumptuous wordsmith, her narratives alive with the most skillful twists and turns of meaning and nuance. I love this book, One of the few that unjustly, I think, missed a place on the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards Poetry long-list.\n\nA couple of my other favourite reads of the year did deservedly make the long-list:\n\nTusiata Avia, Spirit House, Victoria University Press\n\nI was fortunate enough to see this book develop into its final form from a very early stage, so perhaps I’m biased, but Spirit House’s energy, which is geographic, spectral, political and personal, makes it a collection I have loved reading again and again this year.,\n\nGregory Kan, This Paper Boat, Auckland University Press\n\nThis story of migration, alienation, fighting and searching for the essence of author, Iris Wilkinson/Robin Hyde’s life is utterly powerful, meditative and moving. Kan packs so much – and with such punch and veracity – into each of the prose=poems in this work.\n\nLynley Edmeades, As the Verb Tenses, Otago University Press\n\nIn this startling first collection, Edmeades language is so finely tuned and her structures so song-like that reading each poem feels like tuning into the tracks on a classical album. Along the way, memory, migration, childhood and love are examined with a joyous mix of wit, satire and seriousness.\n\nMichael Harlow:\n\nVincent O’Sullivan’s And so it is yet another wonderfully crafted, and witty—in the right measure of scrupulous attention—selection of poetry. There is a great deal of pleasure in the reading to be had here, and not at the expense of other matters of the heart that keep surfacing in poem after poem. O’Sullivan is a maestro (sans hyperbole) musical voice, adept at making poems that are first poems of discovey and not mere ‘invention’. A poetry where ‘deep equals true’.\n\nAnd so it is, Is. If you are interested in getting insights into that ubiquitous, no less than archetypal search about how we are so mysterious to ourselves and the world-at-large, then this assembly of poems should be high priority on your list. O’Sullivan is a first-rate observer of human behaviour; and he consistently turns those insights into a poetry of sometimes searing, and even skewering commentary. But, if you read carefully and pleasurably enough, this is commentary informed by a quietly voiced tender regard—how important that is. Surely, this is one of the poetry books of the year, or any year for that matter.\n\nOne very good reason for reading and re-reading Lynley Edmeades’ As The Verb Tenses is that for starters it inspires confidence in the reader—that you are reading and hearing a voice of wonderful poetic clarity of the imagination. Thing well begun make strong themselves… A poet who already (a first book of poems) knows things– that sooner or later most of us want and need to know about the complexities and fascinations we encounter in ourselves and in the world ‘out there’. . Edmeades also knows that understanding is one thing, knowing is another, keeping in mind a ‘good many things go around in the dark besides Mr and Mrs Santa Claus’; and that poetry can often be a way to look through to that world where light and dark lie down together. You will find this, in one way or another, in a great deal of the poetry in this volume.\n\nAnd there is a very welcoming, leavening wit running throughout; wit, with a purpose more subltle than obvious, which adds considerably to the reading pleasure of As The Verb Tenses. Treat yourself for starters by looking at and listening to ‘Between Speech and Song’ (p. 19).\n\nElizabeth Heritage (this review is reproduced here with permission):\n\nOne of the poetry books I enjoyed most this year was In the Supplementary Garden by Diana Bridge. Here is my review from Landfall Review Online:\n\nI’m not sure what the technical term is for when a poem hits you in the brain; when you read a particular phrase and your whole mind stops and goes “…huh”. And it’s like the light on a square moves and you realise it’s actually a cube. Whatever that is, Diana Bridge does it. A lot.\n\nFrom “A Book of Screens”:\n\nShe celebrates herself\n\nin an arc of tea …\n\n(Ever since I read that, every time I pour out a cup of tea, I think: I am celebrating myself.)\n\nBridge’s latest book is In the Supplementary Garden from Cold Hub Press in Lyttleton. Editor Robert McLean says he chose these new and selected poems to demonstrate Bridge’s best and most diverse work, drawing on her five previous books published over the past 20 years. In her introduction, Janet Hughes describes Bridge’s poetry as “uncompromising”, and I think that’s absolutely right.\n\nFrom “Court Poem of Almost Any Period”:\n\nBehind it all is someone else’s image,\n\nrepeatedly breaking the surface.\n\nThe other keyword here is ‘serious’. As I worked my way slowly through the nearly 170 pages of In the Supplementary Garden, I began to fall under the spell of Bridge’s seriousness. She is, I was unsurprised to learn from the author bio, an academic: has a PhD in classical Chinese poetry, has researched early Indian art history, amongst other things, and has taught at Hong Kong University in the Chinese department. She has lived in many different countries, and, I gather from reading her poems, has taken the nature and culture of each country very seriously.\n\nFrom “The Route”:\n\n… to read the sharp calligraphy\n\nof birds carved on the air, to ambush\n\nnature into telling, you need to stay\n\nin one place for more than a year.\n\nMany of Bridge’s poems are her responses to particular artworks or landscapes. I imagine her standing in a garden with a clipboard, frowning earnestly, and bringing the entire weight of her intellect and experience to bear on a single flower. She considers not just this particular flower, but also the history of flowers, and the history of poems about flowers. She thoughtfully weighs up what poetry can and cannot do to illuminate and communicate her complex artistic response to this flower. She then crafts poetic and lines and images that somehow bring it all together in a way that pulls the reader towards her and insists ‘focus on this’.\n\nFrom “Sequence, Sarnath”:\n\nIt’s obvious, I’d say; you like your statue leavened\n\nwith a dash of theory. I am simply addicted to looking.\n\nFrom “Closing the Border 2”\n\n… an unidentifiable fragrance\n\nblows across centuries\n\ndemanding a precise response.\n\nFrom “Jars, Bubble Bowls and Bottle Vases”:\n\nThe more we gaze, the more we want a story\n\n… the mind decides what it sees.\n\nFrom “French Doors”:\n\nWe trim a thought still, crop a word, as we fit half to\n\nhalf, hoping to find a symmetry that jolts the heart\n\nand soothes the mind with the illusion of completion.\n\nWe lean on matter till it morphs into a bird.\n\nFrom “Spider Lily”:\n\nThe base of the calyx is all autumn.\n\nBone-thinned limbs twist and splay over\n\ndribbles of string: a last-ditch calligraphy.\n\nRoger Hickin\n\nSince it was such a privilege to publish them, & I continue to marvel at their beautifully crafted ways of saying things that matter, I can’t help but mention Diana Bridge’s new and selected poems: In the supplementary garden, and Michael Jackson’s selected poems: Walking to Pencarrow (both Cold Hub Press 2016).\n\nMy most recent poetry purchase was the handsome new VUP Collected Poems of Alistair Te Ariki Campbell. What a fine craftsman Campbell was. A boozy young Baxter might have boasted of being able to take Fleur Adcock off Campbell any time he wanted to, as Campbell reveals in one of his ‘Poets in Our Youth’ poems, but Campbell’s word-music laurels (“More than six degrees of frost, / and another day seeps into my room / silting my veins with weariness”) were beyond contention.\n\nLeaving our own backyard, I enjoyed the company of an Argentinian & a Peruvian . . .\n\nExtracting the Stone of Madness: Poems 1962–1972 (New Directions 2016) is the long-overdue first full-length selection in English of Alejandra Pizarnik, one of the greatest poetic voices of the 20th century. Valiant translations by Yvette Siegert––best read with an ear to the Spanish––of a playful, magical, desperate poet who asked: “What does it mean to translate yourself into words?” and wrote “to ward off fear and the clawing wind that lodges in my throat”.\n\nGregory Racz’s translations of the Peruvian Eduardo Chirinos read as if they were poems written in English. Which is what translations should do. Medicine for the Ailments of Falcons (Literal Publishing, Mexico, 2015), Chirinos’s nineteenth & final collection, was written while he was dying of cancer. He described these poems as having been written “beneath the somber flapping of a mordant, demanding raven or, perhaps, a falcon that demanded medicine to treat its maladies and alleviate its ailments, as did I”. A marvellous, hallucinatory, last-gasp savouring of language, literature & the senses.\n\nStill offshore. American midwesterner Jared Carter is a poet who should be better known. Now in his late seventies, this master of metaphysical, lyric & narrative verse is the kind of poet who is desperately unfashionable these days. I can do no better than quote from Ted Kooser’s introduction to Carter’s new and selected poems Darkened Rooms of Summer (University of Nebraska Press 2014): “This poet can employ the most difficult of literary forms with such remarkable ease and grace that you won’t even notice the scaffolding. He can tell an authentic story on the wings of speech . . . He calls our attention to things within our reach that it seems we’ve never noticed.” His haunting 1995 collection After the Rain, is a book I return to time & again. It’s worth the price of admission for just one of its poems, ‘Moiré’––an extraordinary reflection on the bending, blurring & slipping of memory, which somehow failed to make it to the selected.\n\nBack in our own backyard, Leonard Lambert’s selected poems Somewhere in August, snuck out from Steele Roberts’s capacious stable & pretty much under the radar earlier this year. It’s a well whittled-down selection, but good to see my favourite Lambert poem ––‘To market, to market’–– made the cut, with its “lettuce like a light folded breeze, / long French loaves, the small fellowship of eggs”. I think Neruda might have envied those lines.\n\nKerry Hines:\n\nMost of my poetry reading this year has involved volumes published pre-2016, ranging in time from Diana Bridge’s Landscape with Lines (1996) to Gregory O’Brien’s Whale Years (2015). Among those that particularly intrigued and engaged me were collections that other people have mentioned here in previous years, including Airini Beautrais’ Dear Neil Roberts and Chris Tse’s How To Be Dead in a Year of Snakes.\n\nMore recent collections I’ve read to date have been highly pleasurable, including Gregory Kan’s This Paper Boat (AUP) and Paula Green’s lovely New York Pocket Book (Seraph Press). Tim Jones’s New Sea Land (Mākaro Press) includes the very nice ‘Floodplain, harbour, city’, with its couplets repeating the refrains ‘I would say’ and ‘He would say’ – including:\n\nI would say, you are looking at the rear of archery targets.\n\nHe would say, my little boat is too small for this river.\n\nand\n\nI would say, no flat space escapes a mobile home.\n\nHe would say, everything below the gulls is ocean.\n\nThe book that has probably had the biggest impact on me this year is C. D. Wright’s One With Others [a little book of her days], published in 2010. It’s several things in one – a portrait of an old friend and mentor, ‘V’, and the story of how she joined a Civil Rights walk through her Arkansas town in 1969 (the only white person to do so); what was going on in the town, including black high school student protestors being held in an empty swimming pool for several days; and the past-in-the-present, reminiscences, forgetting and resistances noted by the poet when she was researching the book. It’s also a satisfying whole in which everything is connected (even the bio note is integral to the book). It’s moving, disturbing, absorbing. One of the statements Wright attributes to ‘V’ – ‘If religion is the opiate of the masses, fundamentalism is the amphetamine’ – seems very 2016 as I re-read it now.\n\nJeffrey Paparoa Holman:\n\nHere in Christchurch, I’ve enjoyed Kerrin P. Sharpe’s fine new collection, Rabbit Rabbit (VUP) and Marissa Cappetta’s first foray, How to Tour the World on a Flying Fox (Steele Roberts). A jeweller by profession, Marisa’s poems are certainly finely crafted pieces with weight and light to burn.\n\nTusiata Avia’s powerful and disturbing Fale Aitu/Spirit House (VUP) is essential reading. It may be hard to confront what is driving many of these dark utterances, but she forces the reader to face them squarely. Should be mandatory for beginning CYFS social workers.\n\nMy Serendipity Poetry Book of the Year is a lovely Faber and Faber hardback in the Nature Poets series, John Clare (selected by Paul Farley). He’s brilliant on birdlife, on the non-human world: “The wild duck startles like a sudden thought/And heron slow as if he might be caught”. (Autumn Birds)\n\nI have bought, but hardly surface-scratched the massive hardback edition of Paul Celan’s Breathturn Into Timestead: The Collected Later Poetry, translated and edited by Pierre Joris in a bilingual edition (FSG). He almost single-handedly made poetry possible, after a Holocaust he only just escaped.\n\nAnd finally, Ali Smith’s Autumn (Hamish Hamilton), a novel but replete with poetic flashes and interlocutions, the first of a series of seasons with Winter soon to come, we hope. Just published, but flush with the heat and the madness of Brexit addressed head-on, it’s the story of a young girl’s relationship with an aged refugee next door, in a world that seems on the cusp of disintegration. Beautifully made, polyphonic and inspiring.\n\nIngrid Horrocks:\n\nI was reminded of the pleasure of reading Sarah Jane Barnett’s second collection, WORK (2015), when her long poems ‘Ghosts’ was performed by two actors as part of the litcrawl My First Time event in November. That’s my belated poetry pick for 2016. The litcrawl experiment between writing and theatre helped to bring out the immense orality of Sarah’s poems, and her skill with creating dialogue in verse. I love the way in which her lines work at once as conversations between people and as interior monologue. The six long poems in Work make for a wonderfully satisfying read, stretching language and thought by the mixing of discourses.\n\nMy local highlight from the year’s local fiction publishing was Tracey Slaughter’s stunningly dark, Deleted Scenes for Lovers. Tracey seems to have access to parts of New Zealand society few writers do and she never pulls her punches. It’s powerful, searing stuff.\n\nDavid Howard:\n\nThree Country Classics\n\nBy international standards all New Zealand publishing is small press publishing. This country is home to only 4.73 million people. Recently The New Zealand Listener, which enjoys a weekly circulation of 64,000, presented what it claimed were ten of the best poetry collections of the year: six were from Victoria University Press, while Auckland University Press and Otago University Press produced two apiece. Independent small presses such as Cold Hub, Makaro, Seraph, and Steele Roberts were overlooked despite some of their titles charting on Nielsen Weekly Bestsellers. Journalism worth reading sees beyond the obvious; it is not myopic, preferring to survey the whole farm rather than just the fenced paddock next to the homestead.\n\nA list is a hierarchy, but one that prioritizes pleasure over excellence. To make a list of favourites is to recover the joy of discovery. To say ‘favourite’ is not to suggest ‘best’, although I believe these books, which The Listener failed to hear, are secrets that demand to be whispered over and over…\n\nNothing For It But To Sing by Michael Harlow (Otago University Press)\n\nI’m not often taken by poems that overgrow the border between verse and prose. With Nothing But Switzerland & Lemonade (Hawk Press, 1980), Michael Harlow introduced the prose-poem to New Zealand. He already knew that rhythm pivots upon silence as much as it does upon a stressed syllable. In Nothing For It But To Sing his attack is striking and he fixes the decay on each word as surely as a concert pianist controls that on each note. Harlow knows how much air each line should be assigned on the page, and when to stop. To my ear this collection scores silence – where meaning becomes memory – more powerfully than any New Zealand collection since The Limits by Alice Miller (AUP, 2014).\n\nShipwrecks/Shelters: 6 Contemporary Greek Poets edited and translated by Vana Manasiadis (Seraph Press)\n\nI’m not often taken by an aesthetic of imperfection, which the forceful Hera Lindsay Bird asserts ‘allows room for ugliness and error’. I prefer ugliness and error to announce themselves as subject-matter: they do in this beautiful chapbook. Each translation is a refugee from the original Greek (one arrives in te reo Māori through the care of Hemi Kelly). Bringing them over, Vana Manasiadis attends to how the sound of a word determines resonant emotion, as in these lines by Lena Kallergi: ‘who howls for presence, who is hungry for muscle/ who navigates mythic distances/ for an epiphany, a faint flicker.’ How wonderfully the foreign is made familiar here.\n\nWater For Days Of Thirst: Selected Poems by Blanca Castellón, translated by Roger Hickin (Cold Hub Press)\n\nI’m not often taken by the confessional lyric, its intimacy can seem presumptuous. Yet Blanca Castellón presumes nothing. Her poems are orphans on a journey towards the idea of their mother: ‘Mother do you believe I’m looking/ can you see me seeing?’ Each piece hangs on the page like a half-knitted garment so that the pattern, however incomplete, is apparent. There are no loud colours, but ‘Something’s going on in the overall/ order of ordinary things// Clouds understand me.’ And so do we.\n\nI’m not often taken by poems that overgrow the border between verse and prose, I’m not often taken by an aesthetic of imperfection, I’m not often taken by the confessional – yet I am taken (many places) by these collections. The two translations show that Seraph and Cold Hub have more range than their larger counterparts. They are bringing us the world, as the Greek-American-Kiwi Michael Harlow sings, ‘To let words loose in their looking, and to hear/ what it is that shines a light in the world’s ear’.\n\nHolly Hunter (editor Mimicry):\n\nThis Paper Boat by Gregory Kan. AUP\n\nKan’s quietly beautiful autobiographical poems are interweaved with bits and pieces from the life of ‘I.’, Robin Hyde. I had this one on my bedside table for a few months and I digested it slowly in parts, late at night.\n\nThe Lesser Bohemians by Eimear McBride. Penguin Random House\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with this book, but nonetheless it earns a place on my list for its style alone. The prose is like poetry, and I found I had to unclip logic wires in my brain to understand it (in a good way). There is sex on every second page, so don’t make the mistake I did and read this on the plane. You will sit next to a nosy elderly man. He will read over your shoulder and it will become increasingly uncomfortable.\n\nThe Selfishness of Others: an essay on the fear of narcissism by Kristin Dombek. Farrar, Straus and Giroux\n\nAfter reading about this book in the New Yorker, I ran down to Unity in my lunchbreak and ordered in a copy. In her essay, Dombek takes us through archetypal narcissists (bad boyfriends, millennials, artists, serial killers, etc.) and essentially myth-busts them by analysing each case against decades of psychological studies on narcissism. Though it sounds like dense reading, it’s really not. Dombek writes in accessible, funny and familiar language.\n\nAnna Jackson:\n\nThis has been a wonderful reading year, with Paula’s New York Pocket Book flying all the way over to France to astonish me with the agile movement between narrative and detail, fiction and truths of all kinds, and with the wonderfully inventive and funny drawings by Estelle Hight. At the time I was also reading Chris Price’s Beside Herself, particularly loving the strange heft and warp of the Churl sequence, with its evocation of a damp and loamy medieval life. Other poetry I have loved this year: the brilliant translations published by Seraph Press, Marco Sonzogni and Tim Smith’s translations of Italian poet Claudio Pasi, and Vana Manasiadis’ translations of contemporary Greek poetry; Lee Posna’s lyrical and rich Arboretum; Anahera Gildea’s spare and beautiful Poroporake; and the dazzling, inventive, hilarious and moving poems by Nick Ascroft in his new collection Back to the Human Condition.\n\nIt has been a terrific year for reading about poetry too, with Jonathan Culler’s Theory of the Lyric the book I keep returning to over and over again, alongside Shane Butler’s The Ancient Phonograph, about how classical poets expected their poetry to be heard, Stephen Burt’s attentive readings of contemporary poems in This Poem is You, Ben Lerner’s The Hatred of Poetry and Joshua Clover’s essay “Unfree verse” on writing poetry on a salary, along with his brilliant (and free online – look it up) “Red Epic,” a long poetic essay on poetry in the age of late-capitalism. And I’ve been working my way through everything Robert Dessaix has written which, whether about writing and our relationships with dead authors, or about his own life, seems somehow to inform my thinking about the poetry I am reading, and wanting to write.\n\nLynn Jenner:\n\nEverything is Here, by Rob Hack. Escalator Press, 2016.\n\nThis is Rob Hack’s first published collection and it has rewarded me more with every reading. Rob has a light touch with serious subjects, and the poems will definitely make you laugh, or at least smile. Rob writes about the Cook Islands, where his mother came from, Niue, Australia and several different New Zealands, including the one that greeted him when he was a small brown skinned boy recently arrived in Cannons Creek. He also writes about his writing life and everyday life here on the Kaapiti coast. These poems really rock when Rob reads them himself, but even on the page they speak gently, poignantly, occasionally angrily, and often with love.\n\nAnne Kennedy:\n\nPoroporoaki to the Lord My God: Weaving the Via Dolorosa: Ekphrasis in Response to Walk (Series C) by Colin McCahon, by Anahera Gildea (Seraph Press). This spare, meditative sequence has a haunting beauty, and is a gorgeous object, with its harakeke fly-leaves. Also recommended: hearing the author read the book aloud, as I did at VicBooks on Poetry Day.\n\nHera Lindsay Bird. A couple of years ago, a tiny poem by Hera Lindsay Bird leapt out at me from a not-very-well-known publication for its original sound. (I quickly asked her to send work to Ika 3, and there she is!) If you’ve read about this poet but have not yet read Hera Lindsay Bird you might not know that her work is drenched with new imagery and that it aches with ideas.\n\nSimone Kaho’s Lucky Punch (Anahera Press) is a series of exquisite prose poems that make up a moving family story, and also a love-letter to the Auckland back yard in all its semi-tropical beauty and complexity. There isn’t another book like this out there.\n\nCatching up on last year: That Winter the Wolf Came, by Julianna Spahr (Commune and AK Press), gets engrossed in the state of the place (ecology, politics) in an emotionally transcendent way. I found these essay-poems inspirational, especially right now. Spahr should be as well-known as Anne Carson.\n\nFiona Kidman:\n\nThere have been some pleasures amongst a fair bit of dross this year. Of course, there always are. Some of my favourite New Zealand poets have made their inimitable contributions. Nothing wrong with tried and true. Michael Harlow can be relied on for words that sing and that is reflected in the title of latest collection Nothing for it but to sing (Otago University Press). He knows a good and true verb when he sees/hears it:\n\nThe morning the colour of steel.\n\nAnd voices like skywriting\n\non air, the dark ripple of news\n\nthat stills the day in its tracks.\n\nFrom “Reflections: in the wider world”\n\nThat word stills, it’s utterly perferct.\n\nVincent O’Sullivan’s And so it is (Victoria University Press), demonstrates the author’s wit and acuity as sharply as ever:\n\nA colleague walked up and down thinking, in vain\n\nin vain, while a good breakfast settled\n\nFrom “Once Derrida Died”\n\nAnd, of course, there are the sudden darts of tenderness in unexpected places. The voices of grandchildren nudge at his elbow. Find them for yourself; read “This week then,” a closing note to a lovely collection.\n\nI am really taken with Anne French’s new collection The Blue Voyage and other poems (Auckland University Press) although, wait, wasn’t that last year? Well, no matter. After eleven years silence, a bit of chiming from one year to the next is good. The poems are strong, connected to the sea, the elements. Lynley Edmeades was a revelation to me . I was impressed by As the verb tenses another Otago University Press offering – what a fantastic cover. The inflections are interesting, unmistakably Irish.\n\nIn brief, I heard Claire Orchard read in Wellington this year and my (regular as Santa Claus) Christmas book tokens will go towards buying her Cold Water Cure (VUP) and Paula Green’s New York Pocket Book (Seraph Press). My best poem of the year, Elizabeth Smither’s wonderful “The heart heals itself between beats” first appeared on The Spinoff last October. It starts with the following lines:\n\nWhen the Middlesex Hospital was coming down\n\nI walked through empty corridors to the chapel\n\nand stood behind a rood screen, admiring\n\nself-sacrificing matrons and eminent surgeons.\n\nThe heart heals itself between beats.\n\nThe heart heals itself between beats.\n\nThe last stanza is a refrain that echoes throughout the poem with ascending intensity.\n\nAnd to end on an offshore note, I was fortunate to be a guest at the Frankfurt Book Fair this year. The opening night, attended by the King and Queen of Holland and the King of Belgium because their countries were the combined Guest of Honour, consisted of some passionate speeches By European heads of state about world unity (if only). It closed with a work for two voices called Without Belly Button, an astonishing work performed by writers Charlotte van den Broeck (from Holland) and Arnon Grunberg (from Belgium)\n\nParadise is a story. In the best of cases we hope that, a few times\n\nat least, we will find ourselves in a state and situation that\n\nresembles the story, free from shame\n\nIt came in an exquisite little white book that was a gift to those of us at the ceremony\n\nSarah Laing:\n\nMy best of list only includes 2 poetry books – Paula Green’s and Hera Lindsay Bird’s – because I don’t read much poetry. I have just bought myself Diana Bridge’s book though, as I met her, and we live nearby.\n\nAs far as NZ lit goes, I’ve got Damien’s Dad Art, Emma’s Billy Bird, Gina Cole’s Black Ice Matter, Ashleigh Young’s Can You Tolerate This?, Helen Lehndorf, and Tracy Slaughter. I also read Louise Wareham Leonard 52 Men, which was AMAZING. Oh! And I read Thomasin Sleigh too – she was great and weird and unsettling. In retrospect, I read quite a lot of NZ lit!\n\nInternational – I loved Charlotte Wood’s The Natural Way of Things, Ann Patchett’s Commonwealth, Curtis Sittenfeld’s Eligible, Lucia Berlin’s Manual for Cleaning Women, Han Kang’s The Vegetarian, Max Porter’s Grief is a thing with Feathers. I finally got round to reading Knausgaard and it was so great and compulsive. I have to read some more! My Name is Lucy Barton was haunting and wonderful too.\n\nGraphic novels – Helen Lehndorf’s Write to the Centre was beautiful and inspiring. I always love Brecht Evens and he put out a book called Panter, and I discovered Mari Naomi but I seem to have hardly any graphic novels on my “read” list this year – I am having trouble with the Wellington library system (they only let you have books out for 5 weeks max and they are brutal in the fines, which has put me off. Or maybe I’m just watching too much telly!!)\n\nVana Manasiadis:\n\nUnpredictability, courage, surrender, iconoclasm: those are things that I look for in poetry, and that I found in many of the amazing collections I read this year.\n\nMy love affair with US experimental prose writer Thalia Field has continued; and while I’ve found time to re-read last years glories (Bird Lovers, Backyard, for example), I read an earlier work of hers this year Incarnate: Story Material. Field’s writing plays with convention, expectation; is prose, poetry, prose-poetry, lyric essay all at once. And I find the merging of these contestable boundaries brash and brave, the language elating and political. From ‘Land at Church City’: ‘he is aching in worship, and with hands that strive to forgive the height of churches’, ‘Churches, for a lack of a better word, fake the orange cones at detours consummating.’ Poet Forrest Gander (whom I also love) says that ‘Field leads the reader by the ear to participate in literature [that is] radically expressive, energetic and transformative’ – and that’s the goal isn’t it?\n\nI have enjoyed getting to know performance poet and novelist Kate Tempest this year for the same reasons. In Hold Your Own, her first collection after winning the Ted Hughes Award, (and she is up for the Costa with her latest), she intersects her story with the story of Tiresias, (‘Shuffling, lonesome, sipping black / lager, /Park-drunk. Spouting maniacal /laughter’), and the writing is polemic, jubilant, furious, and bare. (‘How many yous have you been?/ How many, Lined up inside,/ Each killing the last?’). Tempest hasn’t had it easy, hasn’t played by the rules, and she’s a bit blues, perhaps a bit Janis Joplin. (‘Youth hates age, age loves youth. This means we are born for unhappiness. This means we will keep buying outfits’, ‘I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by payment plans’).\n\nLouise Gluck’s seventeenth collection Faithful and Virtuous Night, might arguably counterpoint Tempest’s first. Calmly powerful and seer-like, here she is seventy plus contemplating time, (times), childhood, death, and the logic/ reality/ illusions behind all the givens. There is much less certainty, more doubt – but doubt is Ok, and so is mis or reinterpretation. From ‘Theory of memory’, ‘Great things, she said, are ahead of you, or perhaps behind you; it is difficult to be sure. And yet, she added, what is the difference? Right now you are a child holding hands with a fortune-teller. All the rest is hypothesis and dream’. Also this easy address, this eureka moment: ‘I lay in the dark, waiting for the night to end. /It seemed the longest night I had ever known, /longer than the night I was born. / I write about you all the time, I said aloud. /Every time I say “I,” it refers to you’.\n\nBack home, I found Bernadette Hall’s Mauketere: Floating Mountain inhabiting similar territory. It is muscular and vulnerable, mysterious and present. The line, ‘What joy in the new experimental poets – up early throwing stones into the lake’, encapsulates the book for me, the ways it articulates experiment, flight, and parenthesis. ‘My intention’, introduces the central character, ‘The Tangler’, ‘is to feely and madly and inaccurately write down the substance’. And there is a substance in this gorgeously produced book which feels important and emphatic; if also below the surface. Rachel O’Neill’s beautiful and otherworldly drawings add to the magic.\n\nMask, play, linguistic back flips, associative kicks and surprises, and music in bucket loads can be found Beside Herself by Chris Price. And I really feel the book is made to be read/performed aloud: ‘ I am the wrong / way round, my north, / your south, my up, / your down, your Krone / my Crown’. There is rhythm, precision and craft in each letter – let alone word – and the result reads like a medieval tapestry, with small perfect tales being represented concurrently in all its sections. There is multiplicity, but also air: ‘Step sideways./Now look back at whatever’s /left standing in your shoes’. And like in Maukatere, artwork (by Leo Bensemann) signposts the various quests/plays/selves.\n\nLastly, I’ve been meaning to read Lisa Samuel’s exploration of memory, Anti M, for ages, and have finally started. I am currently being blown away.\n\nJanice Marriot:\n\nOn holiday I take Philip Larkin and Billy Collins everywhere – the dark and light of poetry for me.\n\nAt home I like more local fare: Bernadette Hall, Fiona Farrell and Emma Neale are favourites.\n\nI’m always looking for new poetry that I can relate to. A bonus of festivals and events is that they create serendipitous meetings between otherwise geographically isolated writers and this year they have introduced me to poets I hadn’t heard of previously.\n\nI heard Kerrin Sharpe read from Rabbit Rabbit recently at a literary event organised by the Auckland Women’s Bookshop, and felt excited by the shocks in her poetry. I like the unexpected writhings in her work.\n\nI enjoyed Marty Smith’s Horse with Hat. Evocative of small town childhoods spent outdoors, and the darker side of domestic life often seen through a child’s eyes. Very concentrated, modest verses that replay many readings. I met Marty in Havelock North at an Arts Festival.\n\nI admire James Norcliffe’s activism. He’s busy teaching children to write poetry, and published the excellent Packing a Bag for Mars as a resource to back up his work in schools. He also herded poets together to produce Leaving the Red Zone – 150 poems from 87 poets about the earthquake in Christchurch. He co-edited the Random House Essential New Zealand Poems: Facing the Empty Page. I like anthologies rather than complete works, and this one is ideal for the holiday season. It looks beautiful too. Dip your hand in and enjoy.\n\nKirsten McDougall:\n\nI loved:\n\nMemorial by Alice Oswald\n\nHera Lindsay Bird by Hera Lindsay Bird\n\nDear Boy by Emily Berry\n\nWe Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson\n\nAnd a novel that VUP will publish next year by Pip Adam – as yet untitled.\n\nCarolyn McCurdie:\n\nPoetry:\n\nUdon by the Remarkables Harvey Molloy\n\nSalt River Songs Sam Hunt\n\nGetting it Right Alan Roddick\n\nNothing for it but to Sing Michael Harlow\n\nThe Unexpected Greenness of Trees Roddick and Beynon (ed)\n\nAs the Verb Tenses Lynley Edmeades\n\nSoundings Cilla McQueen\n\nThe Blue Outboard Nicholas Williamson\n\nUngainly Jennifer Compton\n\nOcean and Stone Dinah Hawken\n\nNew Sea Land Tim Jones\n\nFiction:\n\nStrip Sue Wootton\n\nBilly Bird Emma Neale\n\nThe Graveyard Book Neil Gaiman\n\nHeat and Light Ellen van Neerven\n\nSnow Falling on Cedars David Guterson\n\nThe Petticoat Men Barbara Ewing\n\nThe Secret River Kate Grenville\n\nBring up the Bodies Hilary Mantel\n\nThe Chimes Anna Smaill\n\nThe Wizard of Earthsea Ursula K le Guin\n\nNon-fiction:\n\nThe Boy Behind the Curtain Tim Winton\n\nThe Case of the Missing Body Jenny Powell\n\nWorld as Lover, World as Self Joanna Macy\n\nThe Wave in the Mind Ursula K le Guin\n\nIf Women Rose Rooted Sharon Blackie\n\nSearching for the Secret River Kate Grenville\n\nFrankie McMillan:\n\nKerrin Sharpe, Rabbit, Rabbit (VUP) for its startling imagery, compassionate tone and mix of droll humour and tragedy. The poems often veer off into unexpected territory:\n\n‘after the ice swallowed\n\nher favourite horse my mother’s\n\nAstrakhan coat became smarter’ (‘when a crayfish could feed 6 men’)\n\nMiklós Radnóti 1909 -1944 Foamy Sky ( Corvina) for its ability to give witness to catastrophe while still affirming the power of love:\n\n‘hungry clouds eat up the gentle blue of the sky\n\nand as it glooms over your young wife holds you close’ (‘The Poet as Prophet’)\n\nDark Days at the Oxygen Café, James Norcliffe (VUP) for its wry humour and deeply felt observations. His is a world that is often delightfully askew. Myth, pop culture and politics inform the work:\n\n‘We ought to invade\n\nthat goddam country\n\nwhere the linen comes from’ ( ‘Dark Days at the Oxygen Café’)\n\nAnybody reading this who wants to give me a Christmas present, please send – Lynley Edmeades, As the Verb Tenses, Paula Green, New York Pocket Book, Vincent O’Sullivan, And So It Is and Tusiata Avia Fale Aitu/Spirit House.\n\nCourtney Sina Meredith:\n\nChicago Review, Ed Roberson: Retrievals\n\nISSUE 59:04/60:01\n\nI simply cannot round up my year of readin"
