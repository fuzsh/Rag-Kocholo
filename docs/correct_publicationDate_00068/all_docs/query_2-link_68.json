        "text": "Looking for a definitive list of literary devices that’ll level up your writing game?\n\nReady to learn about the mighty metaphor? Or its simpering cousin, the simile?\n\nWell, we’ve compiled a must-have list of common literary techniques that’ll help your writing soar above the cloudsâ¦ pull ahead of the teeming hordesâ¦ shine beyond the most brilliant…\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nLet’s dive right in.\n\nStarting with…\n\nOur Huge List of Literary Techniques\n\nYou will find some recognizable names in this list. You will also find a few party crashers that (unless you were an English major) youâve probably never heard of (Iâm looking at you, verisimilitude).\n\nBut whether itâs a familiar friend or an idiosyncratic interloper, each and every device comes with a lovingly hand-crafted definition and an enlightening example, carefully curated by yours truly.\n\nHereâs our list of the 57 must-know literary devices to get you started on the road to writerly stardom:\n\n1. Alliteration\n\nSome super sentences supply stunning samples of alliteration, such as this one. In other words, an alliterationÂ is a literary deviceÂ that features a series of successive phrases, all starting with the same letter.\n\nGraceful and clever use of alliteration (not, ahem, like the example above) can create a pleasant musicality to writing. Even a simple use of alliteration like “great gifts for writers” or “words that pack a punch” can add heft to your writing.\n\nBut note: Alliterations are a special example of consonance, which means they must use words that start with consonant sounds. Repeated vowel sounds are known as assonance.\n\nExample of Alliteration\n\nMost people think of tongue twisters with a stressed syllable like âPeter Piper picked a pot of pickled peppersâ when they think of alliteration. But did you know many famous writers throughout the ages have used alliteration in their titles?\n\nLove’s Labour’s Lost by William Shakespeare. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. Romance Readers and Ridiculous Rascalsâ¦ wait.\n\nThat last one is not actually a thing. But it is alliterative!\n\nAnd I’d be remiss if I didn’t share this alliterative-filled introduction from V for Vendetta:\n\n2. Anthropomorphism\n\nAnthropomorphism is when a writer gives a non-human animal or object a human characteristic.\n\nExample of Anthropomorphism\n\nIn Disneyâs Beauty and the Beast, Lumiere the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, and the other enchanted residents of the Prince/Beastâs castle talk, walk, sing, and feel emotions just like people do. (Because they technically ARE peopleâ¦ fictional enchanted people, that is.)\n\n3. Dramatic Irony\n\nAudiences love dramatic irony, because they get to be âin the know.â That is, they know something that the characters IN the story do not. Hey, if you buy the book, you get privileges!\n\nExample of Dramatic Irony\n\nIn Oscar Wildeâs The Importance of Being Earnest, two men attempt to escape their responsibilities using the same fake name: Ernest. Only the audience knows the two trickstersâ real names are Jack and Algie. (A far cry from Ernest, for sure!)\n\n4. Euphemism\n\nThe prefix âeu-â means âgoodâ or âwell,â so it makes sense that a âeuphemismâ is a âgood way to talk about a bad thing.â Or, a âword or expression substituted for something else that is too harsh…â\n\nLike when you say your nephew âjust needs a bit of practiceâ when he plays the violin like a tortured cat.\n\nExample of Euphemism\n\nBecause of humanityâs understandable aversion to death, we have come up with quite a few creative ways to describe death and dying:\n\nPushing up daisies\n\nGoing the way of the dinosaur\n\nKicking the bucket\n\n5. Flashback\n\nFlashbacks are scenes that show an event that happened in a characterâs past, providing clues to the present story.\n\nExample of Flashback\n\nIn Alfred Hitchcockâs famous movie Vertigo, one key flashback scene was almost cut out of the picture entirely.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT: Itâs the scene where we find out that the suicidal wife is actually an actress hired to hide the wifeâs murder. The actress starts to write a confession letter, then rips it up.)\n\n6. Foreshadowing\n\nThe writing on the wallâ¦\n\nA glimpse of a tombstone with your name on itâ¦\n\nFingernail marks scratched in bloodâ¦\n\nNot all foreshadowing is creepy, but they all warn or indicate something is coming in the future. You could say that foreshadowing is like the opposite of a flashback.\n\nExample of Foreshadowing\n\nThe classic Harper Lee novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, is peppered with foreshadowing examples throughout the story. In fact, the last twist in this tale is the very first line of the book: âWhen he was nearly thirteen my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.â\n\n(Of course, by the time you get to the end of the book, youâve probably forgotten all about the first line.\n\nBut thatâs why Lee is a genius and the rest of us can only wonder in awe.)\n\n7. Hyperbole\n\nA hyperbole is an exaggeration that a hearer or reader is not supposed to take seriously.\n\nExample of Hyperbole\n\nThe great satirist Mark Twain wrote in Old Times on the Mississippi:\n\nâI… could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck out so far.â\n\n8. Onomatopoeia\n\nAn onomatopoeia is a word that comes from the sound it represents, such as âachoo!â or âarrgh.â\n\nExample of Onomatopoeia\n\nYoung childrenâs books are the motherlode of onomatopoeia examples. Doreen Croninâs Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type has onomatopoeia right in the title. Same with Ross MacDonaldâs Achoo! Bang! Crash! And Barry Gottâs Honk! Splat! Vroom!\n\n9. Oxymoron\n\nAn oxymoron is a popular literary device where seemingly contradictory words are connected. Fun fact: the word âoxymoronâ is itself oxymoronic â it comes from two ancient Greek words meaning âsharp and stupid.â\n\nExample of Oxymoron\n\nOne of the best (and famous) oxymoron examples is Simon and Garfunkelâs famous song âThe Sounds of Silenceâ (covered here by the band Disturbed):\n\n10. Point of View\n\nPoint of view is the perspective a writer chooses when writing. In fiction, you can have a first, second, or third person point of view.\n\nFirst person uses pronouns like âmeâ or âI,â second person uses âyou,â and third person uses âhe/sheâ and looks at the character and story from the perspective of an outsider.\n\nNote: Third person can be limited. The narrator can either only see inside the head of one character, or they can be omniscient â a Godlike narrator that can see everything that is going on.\n\nExample of Point of View\n\nIn The Help, a novel about black maids in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, the story is told from the first-person point of view of three women, looking at similar events from their own perspectives.\n\n11. Allegory\n\nTake a metaphor, put it on steroids, throw in a dash of realism, and you have yourself an allegory: a figure of speech used to represent a large, complex (and often moral) message about real-world (i.e. nonfiction) events or issues.\n\nExample of Allegory\n\nNothing screams âhypocritical tyrantâ quite like fictional pigs in human clothing, declaring: âall animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others!â\n\nAt least, thatâs the deeper meaning George Orwell hoped to convey in Animal Farm, a fictional mirror of communism. Orwell certainly had a way with (dystopian) allegories!\n\n12. Allusion\n\nAn allusion is a device that the writer uses to refer, indirectly, to someone or something outside of the situation, such as a person, event, or thing in another (real or imagined) world.\n\nExample of Allusion\n\nYou’ll find allusion examples just about everywhere you look. For instance, in the Big Bang Theory, the names of main characters Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter allude to the real-life TV producer, Sheldon Leonard.\n\n(Letâs hope that he did not share his fictional counterpartsâ personalities.)\n\n13. Anachronism\n\nAnachronism is the time machine of literary devices. Anachronisms pop up when a writer accidentally (or purposefully) makes an error in the chronology of the writing.\n\nItâs most often seen when writing features slang or technology that should not appear in the timeline of the story.\n\nExample of Anachronism\n\nIn the famous âHe got me invested in some kind of fruit companyâ scene from Forrest Gump, Forrest Gump unfolds a thank-you letter sporting Steve Jobâs Apple logo.\n\nBut the letter in the movie was sent in 1975, while Apple didnât go public in the real world until 1980. So Forrest Gump couldnât have invested in the computer company as the movie portrayed it. (We still love you, Forrest!)\n\n14. Anaphora\n\nThe anaphora is a literary device that emphasizes a word, word group, or phrase by repeating it at the beginning of a series of clauses or sentences.\n\nExample of Anaphora\n\nOne of the longest opening lines by Charles Dickens (which a high school English teacher once directed me to memorize) is an excellent example of anaphora in action:\n\nâIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was theâ¦â\n\n(Thanks a lot, Dickens!)\n\n15. Anastrophe\n\nAnastrophe is a literary device that alters the normal order of English speech. In other words, instead of subject-verb-object (âI like catsâ), the sentence order becomes subject-object-verb (âI cats likeâ).\n\nPoets use anastrophe as an easy rhyme scheme in poetry, and prose writers use it to soundâ¦ wiser?\n\nExample of Anastrophe\n\nWho can talk about anastrophe without mentioning our favorite intergalactic mentor? Thatâs right, Yodaâs iconic speeches are fantastic examples of anastrophe:\n\nâPowerful you have becomeâ\n\nâNamed must be your fear before banish it you can.â\n\nâThe greatest teacher, failure is.â\n\n16. Aphorism\n\nAn aphorism is a short, witty saying that delivers wisdom with a punch. But in order for it to be an aphorism, it has to contain a universal truth, packed into a nutshell-sized statement.\n\nExample of Aphorism\n\nBenjamin Franklin was a master of aphorisms. Here is a prime selection from his treasure trove:\n\nLittle strokes fell great oaks\n\nStrike while the iron is hot\n\nFish and visitors smell in three days\n\n17. Archetype\n\nAn archetype is the original pattern, the prototype, the ideal model for a certain character or situation.\n\nExample of Archetype\n\nClassic literature is a fantastic domain for finding archetypes examples. For instance, in the epic poem, Beowulf, Grendel is the archetypal monster, a âdescendant of Cain,â âcreature of darkness,â and âdevourer of our human kind.â (Yikes. Would not want to meet him in a dark alley!)\n\n18. Asyndeton\n\nSometimes, a writer leaves out conjunctions like and, but, or, for, and nor. This is not because s/he is forgetful. Itâs because thatâs what an asyndeton is: a group of phrases with the conjunctions left out, for rhythmic emphasis.\n\nExample of Asyndeton\n\nHereâs Abraham Lincoln beautifully demonstrating the power of the asyndeton:\n\nâGovernment of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the Earth.â\n\n(Notice the glaring omission of the word âand.â)\n\n19. Chiasmus\n\nThe Latin word âchiasmâ refers to a âcrossing,â so it makes sense that a chiasmus is a literary device where words, grammar constructions, and/or concepts are âcrossed,â aka reversed.\n\nExample of Chiasmus\n\nApparently, early Greeks were quite fond of the chiasmus, or at least Socrates was:\n\nâBad men live that they may eat and drink, whereas good men eat and drink that they may live.â\n\n20. Cliffhanger\n\nCliffhangers get their name from the effect they have on readers: making them feel as if a cruel, cruel writer has left them dangling off the edge of a lonely ledge.\n\nWe all know that feeling of reading WAY past our bedtime, because every chapterâs ending has us frantically flipping to find out what happens next. Thatâs a cliffhanger.\n\nExample of Cliffhanger\n\nHereâs a cliffhanger from Harry Potter:\n\nâHarry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped insideâ¦ and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.â\n\nWant to know what happens next? Youâll have to read the book.\n\n21. Colloquialism\n\nThe word âcolloquialismâ would probably never be a colloquialism itself. Thatâs because colloquialism is a word, phrase, or expression that is used in daily, informal conversations by common people. Colloquialisms vary, depending on where you live.\n\nExample of Colloquialism\n\nThe briefly popular 2012 meme series, âSh*t X say,â are packed with examples of colloquialisms, such as these, er, jewels (?) from Episode 1 of âSh*t Girls Sayâ:\n\nâTwinsies!â\n\nâShut UP!â\n\nâLike, Iâm not even joking right now.â\n\n22. Cumulative Sentence\n\nA cumulative sentence builds on a core idea (an independent clause, if you must know the literary term) by layering on chopped-up partial sentences (dependent clauses) and phrases, like a layer cake!\n\nExample of Cumulative Sentence\n\nâShe finished the Game of Thrones marathon, exhausted yet exhilarated, full of grief that it was all over, itching to call her bestie to discuss her impressions, shocked that it was already nearly dawn.â\n\n23. Diction\n\nDiction is a fancy way of saying: âthe words a writer chooses when talking to a specific audience.â Diction can be formal or informal, use jargon or regional slang, etc.\n\nExample of Diction\n\nFormal diction:\n\nInformal diction:\n\n24. Epigraph\n\nAn epigraph is a brief quote or saying at the beginning of a book or chapter that is put there to suggest the theme of said book or chapter.\n\nExample of Epigraph\n\nâFor Beatrice â My love for you shall live forever. You, however, did not.â\n\nâFor Beatrice â When we first met, you were pretty, and I was lonely. Now I am pretty lonely.â\n\nâFor Beatrice â I cherished, you perished. The worldâs been nightmarished.â\n\nTechnically, the poetic homage to the dead Beatrice in Lemony Snicketâs Series of Unfortunate Events is a dedication, not an epigraph.\n\nBut since Beatrice is fictional (as is, in a sense, the author himself), and these darkly funny quotes set the tone for the Unfortunate Events quite well, one could make the case that these are, in fact, epigraphs.\n\n25. Epistrophe\n\nNot to be confused with alliteration, the epistrophe is the repetition of a word or phrase at the end of a series of clauses or sentences to add rhythm and/or emphasis.\n\nExample of Epistrophe\n\n(My apologies for the earworm.)\n\n26. Extended Metaphor\n\nAn extended metaphor is a metaphor that is extended. Just like Iâm about to extend this definition: a metaphor developed in high detail and spread over a large passage of writing, from several lines, to a paragraph, to an entire work. (Done! Whew.)\n\nExample of Extended Metaphor\n\nIn 2003, Will Ferrell told graduating Harvard-ians about his alma mater, the âUniversity of Lifeâ where he studied in the âSchool of Hard Knocksâ the school colors were âblack and blue,â he had office hours with the âDean of Bloody Nosesâ and had to borrow his class notes from âProfessor Knuckle Sandwich.â\n\n27. Exposition\n\nAn exposition is a literary device used to introduce background information about the story in a matter-of-fact way.\n\nExample of Exposition\n\nBecause of the famous fiction writing rule, âshow donât tell,â many authors use dialogue and other tricks to convey need-to-know information. But some very successful writers continue to use plain old straightforward exposition like:\n\n28. Frame Story\n\nA frame story is exactly what it sounds like: A story that frames another story. In other words, itâs a story that introduces another smaller story inside, or the story outside the story within the storyâ¦ oh, never mind. Just see the example below.\n\nExample of a Frame Story\n\nThe best example of a frame story is The Princess Bride, which author William Goldman claims to have âtranslatedâ from an old âFlorineseâ story his father told him.\n\nThe movie version also uses a frame story: A grandfather reads his grandson a bedtime story (The Princess Bride, of course!).\n\n29. Humor\n\nIf I have to give a humor explanation to you, Iâm afraid you might need something a bit stronger than 57 literary devices toâ¦ Oh, whatâs that? (My editor says I still have to give you a definition. Contractual obligations, and all that.)\n\nFine, fine. Here it is: humor is a literary technique that amuses readers and makes them laugh. (There, happy?)\n\nExample of Humor\n\nI mean, technically this whole entire article is just one big ball of fun, butâ¦ whatâs that? Okay, alright. Official humor examples, here we go:\n\nâItâs just a flesh wound!â â The Black Knight, after getting both arms chopped off by the protagonist in Monty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nââGreater good?â I am your wife! Iâm the greatest good youâre ever gonna get!â â Frozoneâs wifeâs in response to Frozoneâs desire to bail on dinner to save the world in The Incredibles\n\nâA common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.â â Douglas Adams, Mostly Harmless\n\n30. Hypophora\n\nNo, itâs not a fancy name for a Greek hippo. Rather, a hypophora is a literary device where a writer asks a question and then immediately answers it.\n\nExample of Hypophora\n\nHereâs a philosophical example from the timeless childrenâs novel Charlotteâs Web:\n\nâAfter all, whatâs a life, anyway? Weâre born, we live a little while, we die.â\n\n31. Imagery\n\nImagery is descriptive or figurative language used to evoke near-physical sensations in a readerâs mind. Well-written imagery helps readers almost see, hear, taste, touch, and feel what is going on in the story.\n\nExample of Imagery\n\nThis evocative imagery example is an excerpt from T.S. Eliotâs Preludes, which uses lots of figurative language:\n\nThe winter evening settles down\n\nWith smell of steaks in passageways.\n\nSix oâclock.\n\nThe burnt-out ends of smoky days.\n\nAnd now a gusty shower wraps\n\nThe grimy scraps\n\nOf withered leaves about your feet.\n\nTalk about figurative language!\n\n32. Irony\n\nIrony is one of the trickiest literary devices to define, best grasped through absorbing examples. But a workable definition goes something like this:\n\nIrony is using a word or phrase that usually signifies the opposite of what the speaker intends to say, for comedic or emphatic purposes. Irony can also be an event that works out contrary to the expected, and can often be funny.\n\nSo enough with dry definitions, letâs see if these irony examples can explain better:\n\nExample of Irony\n\nThere are three kinds of irony, one of which (dramatic irony) we discussed earlier:\n\nDramatic irony: In Romeo and Juliet, the audience knows that Juliet isnât dead, but asleep. Romeo, who doesn’t know, kills himself.\n\nSituational irony: In the animated film Ratatouille, itâs ironic that a rat (which most people donât like to see in kitchens) ends up being the master chef in a kitchen.\n\nVerbal irony: When Beauty and the Beastâs Belle is trying to get away from an odious suitorâs proposal, she says, âI just donât deserve you!â\n\n33. Isocolon\n\nIsocolon refers to a piece of writing that uses a series of clauses, phrases, or sentences that are grammatically equal in length, creating a parallel structure that gives it a sort of pleasant rhythm.\n\nExamples of Isocolon\n\nâVeni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered).â â Julius Caesar\n\nâYouâve got a lot to live. Pepsiâs got a lot to give.â â Pepsi, circa 1969\n\nâYou win some, you lose some.â â Unknown\n\n34. Juxtaposition\n\nJuxtaposition is a literary device writers use to place two highly contrasting things together to emphasize the difference.\n\nExample of Juxtaposition\n\nA fun example of juxtaposition is in Pixarâs Up: Carl Fredricksen is an old, curmudgeonly widower, while his unwanted sidekick Russell is a young, naively energetic schoolboy. Thatâs what makes the movie so much fun: the contrast (read: juxtaposition) between old, jaded Carl and young, innocent Russell.\n\n35. Litotes\n\nLitotes, from a Greek word meaning âsimple,â refers to an affirmation where you say something by negating the contrary.\n\nExample of Litotes\n\nIn A Modest Proposal, Jonathan Swift prefaces his proposal to cure poverty by eating poor peopleâs children with a litotes:\n\nâI shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.\n\nHaving been assured by a very knowing American…that a young healthy child well nursed is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food…I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragoust.â\n\n36. Malapropism\n\nA malapropismÂ is when a character (unintentionally and hilariously) mistakes a word in place of a similar-sounding word. The abstract concept comes from a character (Mrs. Malaprop) who liked to use big words incorrectly in a comedic play by English playwright Richard Sheridan.\n\nExample of a Malapropism\n\nThe beloved childrenâs series Amelia Bedelia describes a maid who takes her bossesâ instructions a bit too literally. For example: sketching her bossesâ drapes when asked to âdraw the drapes.â\n\n37. Metaphor\n\nAh, the metaphor! A favorite tool of writers everywhere. The metaphor is a literary deviceÂ where something is compared to a dissimilar thing without using a comparison word such as âlikeâ or âas.â It’s used in poetry, nonfiction books, blog posts, emails, short stories, you name it.\n\nExample of a Metaphor\n\nIn Pixarâs Inside Out, the emotions Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness live and work in Headquarters, which is an obvious metaphor example comparing the brain to a technological control center.\n\n38. Metonymy\n\nMetonymy is the practice of using part of a thing to represent something related to it. In other words, itâs the use of one word as a stand-in for another, bigger concept.\n\nExample of Metonymy\n\nMark Twain provides us with a simple metonymy example in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn:\n\nâHe said he reckoned a body could reform the ole man with a shotgun.â\n\nHere, a âbodyâ refers not to a corpse, but to a person. A corpse, after all, would probably have a hard time wielding a shotgun.\n\n39. Mood\n\nMood is the feeling an audience gets from consuming a piece of writing. The words a writer chooses create an atmosphere that evokes emotion from the reader.\n\nExample of Mood\n\nChildrenâs writer Roald Dahl is a master of creating whimsical, funny, child-friendly moods in his books via extraordinary situations (a boy wins a golden ticket to a magical chocolate factory) and a silly invented vocabulary:\n\nâDonât gobblefunk around with wordsâ â The BFG\n\n40. Motif\n\nA motif is a sound, action, figure, image, or other literary element or symbol that recurs throughout a literary work to help develop the theme.\n\nExample of Motif\n\nThe book/movie Ready Player One is stuffed with pop motifs from the 1980s. The entire plot revolves around a virtual 1980s world, which contrasts with the main characterâs bleak real-life.\n\n41. Paradox\n\nA paradox seems to make two mutually contradictory things true at the same time.\n\nExample of Paradox\n\nIn the tragic revenge story, Hamlet, the title character says something that sounds paradoxical:\n\nâI must be cruel to be kind.â\n\nMeaning, he must kill his stepfather (cruel) in order to avenge his fatherâs murder (kind).\n\n42. Personification\n\nPersonification: giving humanlike characteristics to nonhuman animals or objects. Donât confuse it with anthropomorphism, which goes farther, making the nonhuman character act and appear human.\n\nExample of Personification\n\nHere’s an example of personification from Kevin J. Duncan, Smart Blogger’s Editor-in-Chief:\n\n“That giant plate of bacon is begging me to eat it.”\n\n43. Polysyndeton\n\nPolysyndeton is a literary device that uses conjunctions quickly, one right after the other, often without punctuation, in order to play with the rhythm of the writing.\n\nExample of Polysyndeton\n\nIn I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou uses polysyndeton when she writes:\n\nâLet the whitefolks have their money and power and segregation and sarcasm and big houses and schools and lawns like carpetsâ¦â\n\n44. Repetition\n\nRepetition is the grandaddy of many other devices on this list, such as anaphora, epistrophe, and polysyndeton above.\n\nIn other words, repetition is the reiteration of something (word, phrase, sentence, etc.) that has already been said (for emphasis).\n\nExample of Repetition\n\nRepetition is frequently used in song lyrics, such as the iconic Beatles song, Let It Be:\n\nâWhen I find myself in times of trouble\n\nMother Mary comes to me\n\nSpeaking words of wisdom, let it be\n\nLet it be, let it be, let it be, let it be\n\nThere will be an answer, let it beâ¦â\n\n45. Satire\n\nSatire uses humor, ridicule, irony, and exaggeration to expose and criticize something ridiculous, stupid, or bad. Satire can be light and funny, or dark and judgmental.\n\nThere are three types of satire: Juvenalian (viciously attacking a single target), Menippean (equally harsh, but more general), and Horatian (softer, more humorous).\n\nExample of Satire\n\nThe funny-offensive show South Park is packed to the brim with biting satire examples that riff on loads of sensitive topics in a politically incorrect fashion, from politics to religion to Hollywood.\n\n46. Simile\n\nA simile is like a metaphor, except that it compares dissimilar objects using the words âlikeâ or âasâ (whereas metaphors compare directly, without any helping words).\n\nA choice simile can be funny, memorable, surprising, or all three!\n\nExample of Simile\n\nSometimes the most memorable similes are the strangest ones, like this collection of similes from Song of Solomon in the Bible:\n\nâYour hair is like a flock of goats descending from Mount Gilead. Your teeth are a flock of sheep just shornâ¦your lips are like a scarlet ribbon…â\n\n47. Soliloquy\n\nA soliloquy is a speech given by a character in the absence of hearers. Soliloquies are particularly popular in plays, which donât usually have the luxury of omniscient narration to reveal charactersâ inner thoughts.\n\nExample of Soliloquy\n\nWho can talk about soliloquy examples without mentioning the Bardâs epic romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet?\n\nâRomeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo!â says Juliet, speaking (or so she thinks) to herself.\n\n48. Suspense\n\nAlfred Hitchcock. Lee Child. Steven King. All are storytellers who create suspense, a feeling of heightened anxiety, uncertainty, and excitement.\n\nExample of Suspense\n\nOne of the most intense, anxiety-inducing examples of suspense is the famous (or should I say infamous?) shower scene in Hitchcockâs Psycho kept watchers curling their toes for 45 seconds while the innocent-and-soon-to-be-dead Marion takes a shower with a killer lurking in the background.\n\n49. Symbolism\n\nSymbolism. A favorite device of literature teachers everywhere. Symbolism is, of course, when writers use symbols (images, objects, etc.) to represent bigger, deeper ideas, qualities, and so on.\n\nExample of Symbolism\n\nHarry Potterâs lightning scar, the Ring of Doom from the eponymous Lord of the Rings, the Mockingjay from Hunger Gamesâ¦ there are examples of symbolism everywhere you look!\n\n50. Synecdoche\n\nA synecdocheÂ is a literary deviceÂ where a part stands in for the whole, or vice versa. It is not to be confused with metonymy, which is when something represents a related term. (See the earlier example for metonymy.)\n\nExample of Synecdoche\n\nIn Julius Caesar, Mark Antony asks his âFriends, Romans, countrymenâ to âlend [him] their ears.â Thankfully, his audience recognized this metonymy and did not interpret the literal meaning of Antonyâs words. Otherwise, we would have a very different play on our hands.\n\n51. Tautology\n\nA tautology is a literary device often used by accident. It involves saying the same thing twice, but phrasing it differently the second time.\n\nA tautology is something a child might say: âI want it because I want it!â\n\nExample of Tautology\n\nIn Edgar Allen Poeâs The Raven, âgently rappingâ and âfaintly tappingâ are redundant:\n\nâBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping\n\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber doorâ\n\n52. Tmesis\n\nFrom the Greek word meaning âto cut,â tmesis is a literary device that cuts a word or phrase into two parts by inserting a word in between them.\n\nExample of Tmesis\n\nHere are two silly samples from Pygmalionâs Eliza Doolittle:\n\nâFan-bloody-tastic!â\n\nâAbso-blooming-lutelyâ\n\n53. Tone\n\nTone can be tricky to define. Officially, in writing, tone is the attitude a writer has toward the subject or the audience. Itâs the writerâs viewpoint, conveyed through his or her word choice.\n\nExample of Tone\n\nNotice how the choice of emotional words, pacing, and use of other literary elements in this excerpt from Edgar Allen Poeâs The Tell-Tale Heart create a guilty, anxious tone:\n\nâI gasped for breath, and yet the officers heard it not…I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations, but the noise steadily increased. Why WOULD they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro…O God! What COULD I do? I foamed â I raved â I swore!â\n\n54. Tragicomedy\n\nA tragicomedy is exactly what it sounds like: a story (play or novel) that is both tragic and comedic.\n\nExample of Tragicomedy\n\nHaving mastered both tragedy and comedy, is it such a stretch for Shakespeare to have mastered tragicomedy as well? Think: The Merchant of Venice, The Winterâs Tale, and The Tempest, which all blend humor and suffering in a reflection of real life.\n\n55. Verisimilitude\n\nVerisimilitude is a fancy-schmancy word for saying something fake looks real. Example: writing about a fictitious person, thing, or event, that seems almost true, even if itâs far-fetched.\n\nExample of Verisimilitude\n\nFantasy stories are the best fodder for finding verisimilitude. For example, prolific fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson often creates convoluted magic systems based on things like color, strict rules, constraints, and consequences that almost makes them seem possible.\n\n56. Vignette\n\nA vignette is a short scene or episode â a moment-in-the-life description. Unlike a short story, it doesnât have a narrative arc or all the elements of a plot.\n\nExample of Vignette\n\nIn 2009, Pixar put out a series of video vignettes to promote their movie, Wall-E:\n\nâWALL-E meets a footballâ\n\nâWall-E cup shuffleâ\n\nâWall-E meets a magnetâ\n\nHere, check them out:\n\n57. Zoomorphism\n\nZoomorphism is when a writer gives animal-like characteristics to something (human, inanimate object, etc.) that is not an animal. Itâs basically the animal form of personification.\n\nExample of Zoomorphism\n\nWant a terrific example of zoomorphism? Just check out Spider-Man, Catwoman, Black Panther, and dozens other comic book superheroes.\n\nCommon Questions: A Literary Devices Q&A\n\nBefore we wrap things up, let’s dive into some of the common questions we’re asked about literary devices from students.\n\nWhat are Literary Devices?\n\nLiterary devices are strategies writers use to strengthen ideas, add personality to prose, and ultimately communicate more effectively. Just as chefs use unique ingredients or techniques to create culinary masterpieces (flambÃ©ed crÃªpes, anyone?), skilled writers use literary devices to create life-changing works of art.\n\nSo who should care about literary devices?\n\nYou, of course. If you want to be a charismatic, powerful writer that readers want to follow (or clients want to hire), that is.\n\nThe right literary devicesÂ can make an abstract idea memorable, your thoughts more clear, and your writing more powerful.\n\nYour knowledge and skillful use of common literary techniques will catapult you above the hordes of wannabe writers, increasing your self-confidence, and endowing you with the kind of influence that will keep your audience salivating to consume your work.\n\nHow are Literary Devices Different From Rhetorical Devices?\n\nLiterary devices and rhetorical devices have a good bit of overlap. Theyâre very similar â so similar, youâll find a lot of confusing, conflicting information online.\n\nGoogle âalliterationâ and youâll see it on lists for both rhetorical and literary devices. The same is true with âpersonificationâ, âtmesisâ, âlitotesâ, and numerous others.\n\nSo whatâs the difference?\n\nHereâs an oversimplified TL;DR:\n\nA literary device is a narrative technique. A rhetorical device, also known as a persuasive device or stylistic device, is a persuasion technique. You see (or hear) rhetorical devices in famous speeches from Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, and the like.\n\nThe Rule of Three is a common rhetorical device you’ll often see working hand-in-hand with many of these literary devices.\n\nWhat are the 10 Most Common Literary Devices?\n\nAlliteration\n\nAnthropomorphism\n\nDramatic Irony\n\nEuphemism\n\nFlashback\n\nForeshadowing\n\nHyperbole\n\nOnomatopoeia\n\nOxymoron\n\nPoint of View\n\n(Yes, we were surprised âanthropomorphismâ made the list too.)\n\nWhat to Do With Your Literary Device Knowledge\n\nWhew! That was a doozy. Congratulations on making it through the entire list.\n\nNow, I know what youâre thinking:\n\nâDo I need to memorize all of these literary terms?â\n\nNo, no you donât.\n\nâDo I even have to know them by name?â\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nBut tell you whatâ¦\n\nGo through this literary elements list again and just let everything soak in. Then next time youâre reading a book, blog post, piece of poetry, magazine article, an iambic pentameter, or even a tabloid, try to spot the different literary devices hiding inside.\n\nI promise, theyâre there.\n\nAnd next time you write, see if you can weave in a common literary device or two, for emphasis, for art, or just for grins and giggles.\n\nAs you learn to notice and absorb literary text into your craft â the way a kung-fu master absorbs the basic foundations of his form â you will find yourself becoming a more versatile, expressive, skillful writer.\n\nItâs a bit like having a variety of colors to choose from as a painter. Sure, you can draw a decent portrait with just a stick of charcoal, but imagine what you could do if you had an entire palette.\n\nThatâs what literary devices can do for you, if you take the time to pick them up.\n\nSo take another peek at this list now and then, and practice sneaking lit devices into your own work.\n\nYouâll be amazed how much clearer, stronger, and addicting your creative writing will become.\n\nEditors will grin and nod as they read through your work.\n\nBloggers will fight to snap up your guest posts.\n\nReaders will mob you for your skills.\n\nAnd you will smile like Mona Lisa, master of the secrets of the universe (or at least this list of literary devices)."
