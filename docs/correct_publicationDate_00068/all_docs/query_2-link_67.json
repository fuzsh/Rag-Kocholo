        "text": "Most of us know a few fairy and folk tales, and have grown up seeing multiple renditions and retellings of these stories. But less of us are familiar with the collections that popularised them, or the writers that penned the versions we know today. So I thought I’d have a look at 6 fairy tale collectors and writers that have given us some of our most beloved fairy tales:\n\n(I’m concentrating on versions of tales that are well known to native English speakers because that’s my personal background, and as a result the collectors and writers I list are mostly European. For more information about non-European collections and collectors, see the links at the end.)\n\n1. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm\n\n(a.k.a. The Brothers Grimm)\n\nThese German scholars, who were indeed brothers, are perhaps the most famous fairy tale collectors out there (although collecting fairy tales was just one small part of the academic work they did in their lifetimes). In the 1800s they collected various folk and fairy tales from around Germany, and the first version of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen collection was published in 1812. Subsequent versions of the collection added many more tales, as well as modifying many to embellish them or sanitise the more violent elements.\n\nMany popular tales reached a wider audience through this collection, including:\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nHansel and Gretel\n\nSnow White\n\nSleeping Beauty\n\nThe Frog Prince\n\nRapunzel (note, this is believed to have been adapted from the original tale ‘Persinette’ by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force)\n\n2. Charles Perrault\n\nCharles Perrault was a French writer who lived in the 1600s and wrote stories inspired by folk tales. He is sometimes dubbed the father of fairy tales, and his collection Les Contes de ma Mère l’Oye (Stories of Mother Goose) was very influential – his version of Cinderella, for example, is the one English speakers are most familiar with (with the fairy godmother and the pumpkin carriage etc.) and it is very different from the Brothers Grimm version.\n\nSome tales he is best known for include:\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nSleeping Beauty\n\nCinderella\n\nBluebeard\n\nPuss in Boots\n\n3. Marie-Catherine d’Aulnoy\n\nMadame d’Aulnoy was a French countess/baroness and writer who published two fairy tale collections, and who, by dubbing her 1697 collection Les Contes des Fées (Fairy Tales), coined the term “fairy tales” that we now use for the genre. While her fairy tales don’t tend to be the versions most popular today, she was an influential figure in the history of the genre.\n\nSome tales from the Aulnoy’s collection:\n\nFinette Cendron (a similar tale to Cinderella)\n\nGraciosa and Percinet (a similar tale to Snow White)\n\nThe White Cat\n\n4. Hans Christian Andersen\n\nAndersen was a Danish fairy tale writer active in the 1800s. His collections of Eventyr (Fairy Tales) contain many beloved and popular fairy tales that have since inspired many adaptations and retellings, and his name is one synonymous with fairy tales.\n\nFamous tales include:\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n\nThe Snow Queen\n\nThumbelina\n\nThe Ugly Duckling\n\nThe Princess and the Pea\n\nThe Steadfast Tin Soldier\n\nThe Nightingale\n\n5. Joseph Jacobs\n\nJoseph Jacobs was an Australian folklorist who published several collections of classic English fairy tales. His collections English Fairy Tales (1890) and More English Fairy Tales (1894) contain what are now some of the best known versions of famous tales, and were very influential. He also collected fairy tales from Jewish, Indian and Celtic cultures and edited journals and books on folklore.\n\nSome well-known fairy tales from Jacobs’s Collection:\n\nThe Three Little Pigs\n\nJack and the Bean Stalk\n\nGoldilocks and the Three Bears\n\nJack the Giant Killer\n\nThe History of Tom Thumb\n\n6. Andrew Lang\n\nAndrew Lang was a Scottish poet and novelist who published 25 illustrated collections of fairy tales between 1889 and 1913, the first one being The Blue Fairy Tale Book. He is famous for gathering a vast and broad collection of tales from a variety of cultures, and for publishing many of these tales in English for the first time. His Arabian Nights – a version of the Arabic 1001 Nights collection (a very old collection assembled over centuries by multiple translators and authors) was particularly influential. His wife Leonore Blanche Alleyne helped with the translation and retelling of many of the tales.\n\nSome popular tales featured in Lang’s collections:\n\nAladdin\n\nThe Seven Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor\n\nBeauty and the Beast (a tale originally written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve)\n\nThe Forty Thieves\n\nThe Rat Catcher, a.k.a. Pied Piper of Hamelin (a German tale that also appeared in the writings of Goethe and the Brothers Grimm)\n\nWorth a Mention\n\nSome other fairy tale writers and translators worth a mention are:\n\nGabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve – the French novelist who wrote the original Beauty and the Beast story.\n\nAntoine Galland – who translated the 1001 Nights collection into French from the original Arabic, and is believed to have invented the popular stories Aladdin and Ali Baba, because they do not appear in original Arabic versions.\n\nLudwig Bechstein – who released a collection of fairy tales in 1845 – the Deutsches Märchenbuch – that rivalled the Brother’s Grimm for popularity at the time.\n\n__________\n\nOf course, there have been many more collections and collectors of fairy tales than I mentioned above. If you’re keen to know about more fairy tale collectors from around the world, here are some links where you can take a further look:\n\nFairytalez.com list of Fairy Tale authors and collections\n\nWikipedia List of Collectors of Fairy Tales\n\nFairy tale collectors: it’s more than just the Brothers Grimm\n\nDo you have a favourite fairy tale collector, writer or collection I haven’t listed? If so, feel free to mention them in the comments."
