Betty!” in this sweet-tempered tale about being yourself.\n\nKeyana Loves School\n\nNatasha A. Tarpley, illus. by Charnelle Pinkney Barlow. Little, Brown, $18.99 (40p) ISBN 978-0-316-06830-7.

She will be forged in FIRE.” But despite the best efforts of the self-described “Hedgehog of Doom,” the children of classroom 402 coo over how “adorable” she is. Subtly encouraging perspective-taking, it’s a creature-centric comedy that’s ferociously fun.

See Thompkins-Bigelow’s essay for PW on the real-life experience—both as a student and a teacher—that inspired her story.
