        "text": "Illuminated by Water\n\nBy Malachy Tallack\n\n“What little I have to offer by way of technical advice is not really worth writing down, and would probably best be ignored,” author Malachy Tallack explains in his introduction, “But Why is also the question that matters most to me, the one to which I keep returning, again and again.”\n\nFew fishing books tackle the why as thoughtfully as Tallack, a claim I don’t make lightly. He writes lyrically about his fishing experiences, particularly outings in the Shetlands, where he grew up, and Scotland, where he currently resides. He captures the totality of the experience, with vivid descriptions of places, the people he meets and the inherent joys and frustrations of angling.\n\nHe alternates these fishing adventures to tackle bigger issues, from the gender imbalance in fishing, how fishing connects to larger environmental issues, and the ethics of catching, release and eating fish. For each of these issues, Tallach’s writing stands among the best of the subject.\n\nIlluminated by Water was completely absorbing, transporting me to distant lochs, while also giving me new ideas to ponder about my favorite recreational activity. Just a delight of a book.\n\nCasting Onward\n\nBy Steve Ramirez\n\nSteve Ramirez seeks the healing power of fly fishing, and for good reason. His career as a Marine and law enforcement officer left him with PTSD, toxic work environments and a significant amount of setbacks and stress. It would be understandable for him to turn away from humanity and seek the quiet of fly fishing.\n\nBut that’s not this book, not really. While Ramirez does seek new fish and fishing experiences, he wants to do so by connecting to people not turning away from them. And so he embarks on a series of trips across the United States, each with a conservationist devoted to native species. (Full disclosure: I’m one of the people he fishes with).\n\nHe’s seeking not just fish, but also hope. Hope for creeks and for native species and for a world that often seems has gone mad. Enjoying others’ favorite home waters, Ramirez strives to fish with purpose, attentive to each detail of the experience. As he writes, “we are all better off mindfully catching and releasing a single fish in a special place than catching countless fish anywhere, mindlessly.”\n\nUltimately, Ramirez knows we won’t conserve what we don’t love. In eloquent prose that is at times hilarious and other times heartbreaking, he captures what he loves most: native fish and wild rivers and good friends among them.\n\nWalleye\n\nBy Paul J. Radomski\n\nI own fishing books devoted to Nile perch, tench, goliath tigerfish, redeye bass and snakeheads, among many others. I have way too many titles covering trout from just about every angle. But I have never read a book devoted to one of North America’s most popular sport fish, the walleye. Well, until now.\n\nFisheries biologist has written the definitive account of the walleye. His years of experience both studying and fishing for the species has provided him a wealth of knowledge, from the walleye’s place in culture and history to current research and management of the species. This is a highly readable account that includes fishing stories and recipes, recommendations for conservation and much more.\n\nLike any popular gamefish, the walleye attracts a fair amount of “barstool biology” with anglers providing their own solutions to management issues. Radomski understands angler perspectives. He also understands the science. The result is a book that can help shape a better future for both walleye and the people who love them.\n\nGolden Years, Golden Hours\n\nBy Paul Vang\n\nPaul Vang, and outdoor writer in his eighties, is well aware that most of his fishing trips are behind him. This is a book in no small part about aging. But this isn’t a book about nostalgia or sentimentality. Vang still leads an extraordinarily active life. If he pines for some sort of perfect mythical past, it doesn’t show here.\n\nInstead, Vang seems to focus on savoring every moment he can still get afield. His writing is filled with what is best about the outdoor life, the time spent with family and friends, the thrill of experiencing new places and the solace of returning to home waters. And he recognizes that these outdoor adventures all depend on clean water, healthy habitat and public lands.\n\nA lot of the fishing and other outdoor adventures take place near his home in Montana, but he’s also had a wealth of experience around the continent. This isn’t a book about big fish, although they’re here, or technique. It’s about enjoying the totality of experience, whatever your age, and recognizing that every day on the water or in the field is a gift.\n\nAn Atlas of Illinois Fishes\n\nBy Brian A Metzke, et al\n\nEvery angler, stream explorer and freshwater conservationist should know the fish species of the waters they visit. So often, even stream advocates know only a bit about freshwater biodiversity. Fortunately, there are a growing number of excellent fish references books, often organized by U.S. state, that provide detailed information on each species.\n\nAn Atlas of Illinois Fishes is a welcome addition to this list. I’ve had the pleasure of fishing and visiting several conservation projects in Illinois, and confess that the tremendous biological diversity surprised me. It’s a great state to explore for freshwater naturalists, and this book provides extensive information on each Illinois fish species.\n\nThere are identification keys, photos, range maps, conservation information and more. This one fills a welcome need in my fish reference library. Any fish nerd would enjoy it.\n\nThe Secret Carp\n\nBy Chris Yates\n\nChris Yates is well-known in the United Kingdom, but much less so in the United States. This isn’t a new book, but I’ve recently become acquainted with Yates’s work and he’s already among my favorites. Quite simply, he gets it. He gets why anglers do what we do and eloquently describes the little pleasures of the experience that somehow make it all more than the sum of the parts.\n\nThe Secret Carp is my favorite. In England, fishing for carp and other “coarse” species has a long and treasured history. (In the United States, even native species like suckers and gar are too often labeled “trash” fish, under-managed and under-valued). This book involves one full day of carp fishing in which not a lot happens in terms of catching fish. But a lot happens along the water and in Yates’s always-roaming mind.\n\nReading it makes me appreciate fishing even more. It is a reminder that, at its best, fishing ignites a childlike sense of wonder. Read this book, and then read everything Chris Yates has written."
