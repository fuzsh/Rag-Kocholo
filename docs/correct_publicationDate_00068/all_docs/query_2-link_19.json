        "text": "Although not a lot is known about Bishop’s life, she did spend time fishing as a young girl. She likely experienced something similar to the events depicted in ‘The Fish.’ Throughout this poem, readers will feel the torrent of emotions the main character does. She feels torn about her accomplishment, how the fish acted, how it looks, and what those things say about its history. It has a value, strength, and dignity of its own, and that’s something the speaker chooses to preserve.\n\nSummary\n\n‘The Fish’ by Elizabeth Bishop is a narrative poem that describes a speaker’s reaction after catching a venerable, homely, and large fish.\n\nThe poem begins with the speaker telling the reader that she went fishing and caught a “tremendous fish.” She emphasizes the fact that as she was reeling in the fish, it did not fight at all. Bishop uses three adjectives to describe it. It is “battered,” “venerable,” and “homely.” She goes on, spending the next lines giving in-depth details about the state of the skin. She compares it to old wallpaper that is peeling off the walls of an ancient house. In the next seven lines, the sight of the blood inspires the speaker to consider the fish’s insides. From past experience catching, killing, and eating these animals, she knows that the “white flesh“ is “packed in like feathers.”\n\nMost importantly, she notes that there are “five old pieces of fishing line” in the fish’s mouth. They are all “still attached” to their “five big hooks.” The speaker continues to stare at the fish, and she begins to feel a sense of victory. She also notices the oil in the boat and the way it spreads into a rainbow. The speaker was awed by these sights, and suddenly everything appeared to be a rainbow. This new state of mind encouraged her to release the fish.\n\nAnalysis of the Title\n\nBishop’s poem, ‘The Fish,’ has a straightforward title that’s hard to misinterpret. It designated this poem as focused on “the fish” the young main character catches. This ensures that the reader puts as much time into thinking about the fish as possible, rather than analyzing other, less central parts of the text.\n\nThemes\n\n‘The Fish’ is one of those poems that seems simple from the outside but actually contains great depths of meaning. In the text, Bishop engages with themes of nature, humility, and choices. After catching this extremely noteworthy fish, it is her choice to release it back into the water. She had a moment of connection with the creature that spread out into a broader connection with the natural world. She was suddenly more a part of things than she had been in the past, her state of mind was altered. Additionally, it is clear that this particular creature’s history moved her, the number of times it had been caught, and how each time it escaped death. This speaks to another less obvious theme–death.\n\nStructure and Form\n\nIt is written in free verse, meaning that there is no specific pattern of rhyme or meter to the lines. In total, there are 76 lines contained within a single stanza. They are all similar in length, fairly short, and sometimes stray into the realm trimeter. This means that a number of them, although nowhere close to all of them, contain three sets of two beats. Again, there is no single pattern of rhythm to the text.\n\nWhen scanning the poem, the reader will immediately notice the dashes. Bishop chose to incorporate this form of punctuation into the poem in order to make the reader pause and consider what her speaker just said. Often, the dashes are also used to represent the speaker’s own uncertainty. She pauses to think about her own words before continuing.\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nWhile there is not a rhyme scheme, there are also a few moments of complete or perfect rhyme. For example, a reader can look to lines one and six with the words “caught“ and “fought.” The word “thought” also connects to the word “fight” directly above it in line number five, as well as to “out” in line three. These relate to one another due to consonance or the use of similar consonant sounds.\n\nRepetition appears throughout the text and in different forms. There are examples of it lines seventy and seventy-one with the use and reuse of the word “rusted.” Another moment is in line sixty-five with the repetition of the word “stared.”\n\nAlliteration occurs when words are used in succession, or at least appear close together, and begin with the same letter. This is one of the most common techniques used by poets and appears a number of times in ‘The Fish.’ For example, in line thirty-eight, she uses the phrase “tarnished tinfoil.”\n\nAnother poetic technique Bishop makes use of is simile. There are a few examples, such as in line twenty-eight when the speaker describes the flesh of the fish as “packed like feathers.”\n\nAnalysis of The Fish\n\nLines 1-7\n\nI caught a tremendous fish\n\nand held him beside the boat\n\n(…)\n\nHe hadn’t fought at all.\n\nHe hung a grunting weight,\n\nIn the first lines of ‘The Fish,’ the speaker begins by stating that she went fishing and caught a “tremendous fish.” As soon as the fish was out of the water, she began an intense period of observation. Perhaps due in part to surprise, the speaker does not immediately haul the fish into the boat. It is halfway out of the water, and she takes note of the fact that her hook is caught in the corner of its mouth, where one would expect it to be.\n\nIn lines five and six, this speaker emphasizes the fact that as she was reeling in the fish, it did not fight at all. This seems surprising considering the fact that the fish is so large. There is a distinct possibility that if it had fought, then it could’ve broken in the line and gotten away. A reader should take note of the use of anaphora in lines five, six, and seven. Although the fish did not fight when she reeled it in, it had a deadweight which proved to be a different kind of resistance.\n\nLines 8-13\n\nbattered and venerable\n\nand homely. Here and there\n\n(…)\n\nand its pattern of darker brown\n\nwas like wallpaper:\n\nIn lines eight and nine, Bishop uses three adjectives to describe the fish. It is “battered,” “venerable,“ and “homely.” At first, these three words seem to cancel one another out. But that is not the case at all. Through the use of the word battered, Bishop’s speaker is acknowledging the fact that this is not the first time the fish has been caught. It also possibly references injuries the fish sustained in the water itself.\n\nWhen she uses the word venerable, she is showing her respect for the animal. She has taken note of its past injuries and the scars which have resulted. She knows that the fish has strength, endurance, and perseverance that should be recognized. Lastly, she calls the fish homely. This is a word meaning ugly or unattractive.\n\nShe goes on, spending the next lines giving in-depth details about the fish’s skin. Bishop uses a simile to describe its state. She compares it to old wallpaper that is peeling off the walls of an ancient house. As the strips come off, the skin underneath is revealed, and a new pattern is created as the two different textures and colors contrast to one another.\n\nLines 14-26\n\nshapes like full-blown roses\n\nstained and lost through age.\n\n(…)\n\nfresh and crisp with blood,\n\nthat can cut so badly —\n\nIn the next two lines of ‘The Fish,’ the speaker uses additional similes to compare the shapes that the peeling skin makes to “full blown roses.” This is another reference to a wallpaper pattern. However, she makes sure to emphasize the fact that the paper pattern has been lost to the ages. However it used to look, those images are long since gone.\n\nThere are other textures on the skin as well. These return the speaker to the wallpaper simile over and over again. They were “barnacles” and “fine rosettes of lime.” But, the speaker makes sure she doesn’t get too far from the “homely” qualities of the creature. These barnacles and rosettes are infested with sea lice.\n\nShe also takes note of the impact the oxygen is having on the fish. It is struggling through its violent introduction to this very different world. The oxygen is described as “terrible” and the gills as “frightening.” They move as though terrified themselves. There is also the blood; as a result of the hook in the fish’s mouth.\n\nLines 27-33\n\nI thought of the coarse white flesh\n\npacked in like feathers,\n\n(…)\n\nand the pink swim-bladder\n\nlike a big peony.\n\nIn the next seven lines, the sight of the blood inspires the speaker to consider the inside of the fish. From past experience catching, killing, and eating these animals, she knows that the “white flesh“ is “packed in like feathers.” With this simile in mind, she continues on to describe the different size bones and the dramatic, contrasting, and evocative colors and shapes one would see inside the fish’s body. There is another simile that relates back to the roses of the wallpaper. This time, the “swim bladder” is like a “big peony” flower.\n\nLines 34-44\n\nI looked into his eyes\n\nwhich were far larger than mine\n\n(…)\n\n— It was more like the tipping\n\nof an object toward the light.\n\nThe speaker also makes sure to draw a comparison between the fish and herself. She notices that his eyes are much larger than hers, but they are also “shallower” and yellower.\n\nJust like the fish’s entrails, there is a shine to its eyes. They appear like “tarnished tinfoil.” She goes on to connect the fish to the human body again and the act of wearing glasses. The fish’s eyes move in their sockets, but not with the intent of looking at her. She is just another object in this terrible yet familiar world. As the eyes move, she compares them to objects “tipping toward the light.”\n\nLines 45-55\n\nI admired his sullen face,\n\nthe mechanism of his jaw,\n\n(…)\n\nwith all their five big hooks\n\ngrown firmly in his mouth.\n\nThe fish is further personified or compared to humans when she describes its face as “sullen.” She also begins to speak about its lower lip and then pauses. The dashes indicate this moment. She is considering the fact that it may not actually be a lip. It is more like a weapon and much grimmer than a human lip.\n\nMost importantly, she notes that there are “five old pieces of the fishing line” in the fish’s mouth. They are all “still attached” to their “five big hooks.” Their age is determined by the fact that they have “grown firmly in his mouth.”\n\nLines 56-64\n\nA green line, frayed at the end\n\nwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,\n\n(…)\n\na five-haired beard of wisdom\n\ntrailing from his aching jaw.\n\nThe speaker takes the next line to detail what the hooks and fishing line look like. The in-depth study of these details makes the poem slow down. It feels as if time itself is moving at a decreased pace. She stares at the fish, entranced by its age and history. The speaker sees the hooks and their attached strings not as burdens but as metals. They speak to its venerability and strength.\n\nIt is clear that the speaker is capable of sympathizing with the fish. She interprets the hairs on its chin as representatives of wisdom and determines that its jaw must be aching.\n\nLines 65-76\n\nI stared and stared\n\nand victory filled up\n\n(…)\n\nwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!\n\nAnd I let the fish go.\n\nThe speaker continues to stare at the fish, and she begins to feel a sense of victory. As if she surmounted some great obstacle with the catch and capture of this creature. Again, there is a great amount of detail used to slow the lines down. She takes notice of the oil in the boat and the way it had spread into a rainbow. The speaker also noticed how the “thwarts” had been cracked by the sun and a number of other small details.\n\nThese elements, combined together, convey to the reader that she is in awe of the animal and is having a transcendent moment in its presence. Finally, the beauty of the scene overcomes her, and everything transforms into the rainbow of oil. In the last, simple, and concluding line Bishop’s speaker admits that she let the fish go. Now, her victory seems different.\n\nThe fact that she caught the fish does not speak to her strength or skill. In fact, five people before her had accomplished the same thing. The last line indicates that all of them had a similar transcendent moment. They were all influenced to release the fish back into the water.\n\nIt also speaks to the possibility that the fish had some understanding of its impact on those who caught it. Because it does not fight, perhaps it knew that it was not in any real danger. It just had to endure the temporary pain and terror, and then it would be let go.\n\nSimilar Poetry\n\nReaders who enjoyed ‘The Fish‘ should also consider reading some of Elizabeth Bishop’s other poems.
