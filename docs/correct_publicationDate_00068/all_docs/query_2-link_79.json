        "text": "Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\n\nMother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\n\nGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n\nThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n\n“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she\n\nWith silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,\n\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n\nThe wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n\nI lift my lamp beside the golden door!”\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\n\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;\n\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\n\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\n\nBy chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;\n\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\n\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;\n\nNor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\n\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:\n\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\nRelated: 10 Words Shakespeare Invented That We Still Use Today\n\nBut O heart! heart! heart!\n\nO the bleeding drops of red,\n\nWhere on the deck my Captain lies,\n\nFallen cold and dead.\n\nO Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;\n\nRise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;\n\nFor you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;\n\nFor you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning\n\nI'm nobody! Who are you?\n\nAre you nobody, too?\n\nThen there's a pair of us — don't tell!\n\nThey'd banish us, you know.\n\nHow dreary to be somebody!\n\nHow public, like a frog\n\nTo tell your name the livelong day\n\nTo an admiring bog!\n\nAway! away! for I will fly to thee,\n\nNot charioted by Bacchus and his pards,\n\nBut on the viewless wings of Poesy,\n\nThough the dull brain perplexes and retards:\n\nAlready with thee! tender is the night,\n\nAnd haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,\n\nClustered around by all her starry Fays;\n\nBut here there is no light,\n\nSave what from heaven is with the breezes blown\n\nThrough verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways\n\nBut mostly he watched with eager search\n\nThe belfry tower of the Old North Church,\n\nAs it rose above the graves on the hill,\n\nLonely and spectral and sombre and still.\n\nAnd lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height\n\nA glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\n\nHe springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\n\nBut lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\n\nA second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\nSome say the world will end in fire,\n\nSome say in ice.\n\nFrom what I’ve tasted of desire\n\nI hold with those who favor fire.\n\nBut if it had to perish twice,\n\nI think I know enough of hate\n\nTo say that for destruction ice\n\nIs also great\n\nAnd would suffice.\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\n[...]\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\nAnd I have learned too\n\nto laugh with only my teeth\n\nand shake hands without my heart.\n\nI have also learned to say,’Goodbye’,\n\nwhen I mean ‘Good-riddance’:\n\nto say ‘Glad to meet you’,\n\nwithout being glad; and to say ‘It’s been\n\nnice talking to you’, after being bored.\n\nThere are so many roots to the tree of anger\n\nthat sometimes the branches shatter\n\nbefore they bear.\n\nSitting in Nedicks\n\nthe women rally before they march\n\ndiscussing the problematic girls\n\nthey hire to make them free.\n\nAn almost white counterman passes\n\na waiting brother to serve them first\n\nand the ladies neither notice nor reject\n\nthe slighter pleasures of their slavery.\n\nBut I who am bound by my mirror\n\nas well as my bed\n\nsee causes in colour\n\nas well as sex\n\nand sit here wondering\n\nwhich me will survive\n\nall these liberations.\n\nRelated: 10 Unapologetic Books About Race in America\n\nI placed a jar in Tennessee,\n\nAnd round it was, upon a hill.\n\nIt made the slovenly wilderness\n\nSurround that hill.\n\nThe wilderness rose up to it,\n\nAnd sprawled around, no longer wild.\n\nThe jar was round upon the ground\n\nAnd tall and of a port in air.\n\nIt took dominion everywhere.\n\nThe jar was gray and bare.\n\nIt did not give of bird or bush,\n\nLike nothing else in Tennessee.\n\nNo man is an island,\n\nEntire of itself,\n\nEvery man is a piece of the continent,\n\nA part of the main.\n\nIf a clod be washed away by the sea,\n\nEurope is the less.\n\nAs well as if a promontory were.\n\nAs well as if a manor of thy friend’s\n\nOr of thine own were:\n\nAny man’s death diminishes me,\n\nBecause I am involved in mankind,\n\nAnd therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;\n\nIt tolls for thee.\n\nIt's not easy to know what is true for you or me\n\nat twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what\n\nI feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:\n\nhear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.\n\n(I hear New York, too.) Me—who?\n\nThis City now doth, like a garment, wear\n\nThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\n\nShips, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\n\nOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;\n\nAll bright and glittering in the smokeless air.\n\nNever did sun more beautifully steep\n\nIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;\n\nNe'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\n\nThe people upstairs all practise ballet\n\nTheir living room is a bowling alley\n\nTheir bedroom is full of conducted tours.\n\nTheir radio is louder than yours,\n\nThey celebrate week-ends all the week.\n\nWhen they take a shower, your ceilings leak.\n\nThey try to get their parties to mix\n\nBy supplying their guests with Pogo sticks,\n\nAnd when their fun at last abates,\n\nThey go to the bathroom on roller skates.\n\nI might love the people upstairs more\n\nIf only they lived on another floor.\n\nwade\n\nthrough black jade.\n\nOf the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps\n\nadjusting the ash-heaps;\n\nopening and shutting itself like\n\nan\n\ninjured fan.\n\nThe barnacles which encrust the side\n\nof the wave, cannot hide\n\nthere for the submerged shafts of the\n\nsun,\n\nsplit like spun\n\nglass, move themselves with spotlight swiftness\n\ninto the crevices—\n\nin and out, illuminating\n\nthe\n\nturquoise sea\n\nof bodies. The water drives a wedge\n\nof iron through the iron edge\n\nof the cliff; whereupon the stars,\n\npink\n\nrice-grains, ink-\n\nbespattered jelly fish, crabs like green\n\nlilies, and submarine\n\ntoadstools, slide each on the other.\n\nRelated: Our Favorite Short Nature Quotes from Books\n\nWhen I was One,\n\nI had just begun.\n\nWhen I was Two,\n\nI was nearly new.\n\nWhen I was Three\n\nI was hardly me.\n\nWhen I was Four,\n\nI was not much more.\n\nWhen I was Five,\n\nI was just alive.\n\nBut now I am Six,\n\nI'm as clever as clever,\n\nSo I think I'll be six now for ever and ever.\n\nOut of the night that covers me,\n\nBlack as the pit from pole to pole,\n\nI thank whatever gods may be\n\nFor my unconquerable soul.\n\nIn the fell clutch of circumstance\n\nI have not winced nor cried aloud.\n\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance\n\nMy head is bloody, but unbowed.\n\nBeyond this place of wrath and tears\n\nLooms but the Horror of the shade,\n\nAnd yet the menace of the years\n\nFinds and shall find me unafraid.\n\nIt matters not how strait the gate,\n\nHow charged with punishments the scroll,\n\nI am the master of my fate,\n\nI am the captain of my soul."
