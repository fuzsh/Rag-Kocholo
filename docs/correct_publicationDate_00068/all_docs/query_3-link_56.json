        "text": "As the caption says, if you haven’t indulged in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a trilogy in four parts; then you’ve missed out on something. Go indulge. That’s probably the best advice you’ll get in this post. This is my moment of self indulgence.\n\nAs an introvert, which surprises many people, it is incredibly cathartic to pick something and place it “outside me”. To do that I have to close all the loops and tie off all the strings. I might keep a piece of it for reference but I will have analysed it and made “sense” of it. Extraverts tend to find it much easier to leave their thoughts jumbled and unfinished all over the place. Neither is better than the other, and we all do some of both, but tend to do more of one than the other.\n\nThis is me dealing with some other people that said, so long and thanks for all the fish. It was messy and horrible and everybody, myself included failed to behave in the good ways that you will read about in my writings. Emotions, history, the time dependency of experience (or non-trivial machines in cybernetic speak) all played a part.\n\nVarious things were lost, many of which were things I had written but as I don’t control access to that blog it has been lost, to me at least, and likely the current ‘owners’ place no value you on it, so it’s lost to everyone. Most of it was trite scribblings, but I think there were one or two that might actually have had some worth. However, I suspect they missed some important things, and as my understanding of the world grows every day I’ll need to let that old part of me go.\n\nSomething I/we should put more emphasis on is the INTRApersonal relationship we have with ourselves. Yes, there are many of “us” on the inside and we need to understand how we relate to those fragments of ourselves. If we can’t relate to ourselves, and all our parts, how much harder does it make it to relate to other people.\n\nFrom that, let’s say I am sad (too short and simple a word to convey what I feel). I am sad that what was once a promising partnership became hijacked by fears and people’s urgency to fix “a thing” without seeing how a nudge elsewhere in the system would have delivered deeper and longer lasting changes.\n\nI’m sad that fears and deep ingrained experience led to habits that devalued people and what they could do. That ego and self-protection of those fragmented inner selves of all the people concerned (yes, including me) couldn’t sit the elephants down and talk as riders to each other. [That last sentence will make more sense after you’ve read more of my writings].\n\nI’m sad that the damage done is not just in the harm done to people concerned but that it has most likely reduced the likelihood that the deep good that was envisioned originally will ever happen. The harm that will propagate is almost sickening.\n\nA concept that was toyed with in The Good Place was that we are judged by the impact of our decisions. Not just the immediate ones, but the long term and systemic ones. That’s a place I fear to go because this one event may be a disaster that sees me damned for eternity. But I can hope that those that had had enough fish go on to great success and do the things we had once said we would do together. And perhaps it will spur me to push the things I know to new heights and it will be a net win for the world.\n\nThere it is. A complex mess that won’t be resolved in my life time. Maybe you can see why I’ve left it here. I doubt this is a net contribution to humanities understanding of anything, but I can hope that it is.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you. Can I suggest you look at other things I’ve written, as they will more likely have a positive impact on your world, and everyone else’s."
