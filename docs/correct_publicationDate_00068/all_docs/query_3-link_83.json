        "text": "EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: Christy Kay has written stories for the Pioneer about her energy healing and wellness practice. Christy also volunteers for HUGGS ‚Äì Helping Us Give & Get Support ‚Äì a local grassroots organization that provides resources and connections for our community through a variety of programs, including a monthly Teen Night, community conversations and more. Christy gives so much to our community, please reach out and support her business and servcies; a donation to HUGGS Teen Night can be made through Fulcrum Community Resources (see information below.) Thank to Christy for providing this safe space for wellness and healing. If you or someone you know needs help, reach out to Christy, local resources or call/text to 988. There is help and hope.\n\nBy Christy Kay\n\nYou may remember the story I told not too long ago about the man who came in to the studio in obvious distress, and how I held space for him- listened, gave tea, and healing?\n\nThese types of experiences are becoming more and more common, and in the last week, I‚Äôve had 5 different souls come in, and lay down their burdens.\n\nOne particular young man had a story that really pulled my heart out of me. He walked in dazed and confused, looked at me and asked how the studio came into being. I gave him the three sentence condensed version: But an even smaller version is- a healing space, with a store that helps support the community work I do.\n\nHe took a deep breath, said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs incredible‚Äù, and then broke down in tears. He moved to leave, saying he was sorry. But I gently told him he was free to stay, gesturing to the sofa chair, and offered tea. He declined the tea, but sat down and sobbed for a bit. Then he told me his dad had died by suicide recently, his girlfriend broke up with him soon after, and wouldn‚Äôt allow him to see their dog, and he is now living out of his car.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to listen to and I wanted to desperately fix everything for him, but I just listened. I held space for him to feel his emotions, and talk things out. After a bit, he calmed down and said ‚Äúwow, just wow, and thank you.‚Äù\n\nI led him through some breathing exercises, and then offered tea again- he said yes. I offered a clearing with my tuning forks. He accepted. After a very brief clearing, I asked him how he was doing. He told me that he felt deep healing, was amazed at how much better he felt, and was a little speechless, but also wanted to know more about what I do.\n\nWe then talked about sound and resonance, and the frequency of love- we talked about men not being allowed to have feelings, much less express them, and how he believed that is why his father died. He told me he wasn‚Äôt going to let that happen to him, and he thanked me for allowing him to feel, to be safe, to be cared for, to breathe deeply again.\n\nI gave him a crystal for grief healing, and some local resources for mental health and his houseless situation, and as he got ready to leave, he timidly asked for a hug- I readily obliged.\n\nAnd then he walked out, with a smile on his face, deeply changed, and I saw him say hello and offer a high five to a small boy in the courtyard with his father‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nI don‚Äôt make enough money to feed myself regularly, and this work, well, it can be exhausting, but I am grateful for the opportunity to create safe spaces for others, and will continue to do it as long as I am able.\n\nBig hugs to ALL üß°"
