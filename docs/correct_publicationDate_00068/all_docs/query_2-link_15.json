        "text": "On December 10, 2019, the Austrian writer Peter Handke received the Nobel Prize in Literature. If he felt pride or triumph, he didn’t show it. His bow tie askance above an ill-fitting white dress shirt, his eyes unsmiling behind his trademark round glasses, Handke looked resigned and stoical, as if he were submitting to a bothersome medical procedure. As he accepted his award, some of the onlookers—not all of whom joined in the applause—appeared equally grim.\n\nHandke embarked on his career, in the nineteen-sixties, as a provocateur, with absurdist theatrical works that eschewed action, character, and dialogue for, in the words of one critic, “anonymous, threatening rants.” One of his early plays, titled “Offending the Audience,” ends with the actors hurling insults at the spectators. In the following decades, as he produced dozens of plays and novels, he turned his experiments with language inward, exploring both its possibilities and its limitations in evoking human consciousness. W. G. Sebald, who was deeply influenced by Handke, wrote, “The specific narrative genre he developed succeeded by dint of its completely original linguistic and imaginative precision.”\n\nHandke’s novels, which he has called “narrative excursions or one-man expeditions,” often feature a man who shares characteristics with the author as he reflects on what he sees while journeying through a landscape. Episodic, with long stretches in which there is little to no action, the narratives arise out of a series of encounters—with people, animals, or simply ideas—that gradually accrue meaning. In “Repetition” (1986), often considered Handke’s masterpiece, the setting is his mother’s homeland—Slovenia, then part of Communist Yugoslavia. In his latest novel to appear in English, “The Fruit Thief” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), which was published in German in 2017 and has been translated by Krishna Winston, we are in the countryside just north of Paris, not far from the suburb where Handke has lived for the past thirty years.\n\nThese novels, in their microscopic focus on the vagaries of the narrator’s perception, are almost aggressively nonpolitical, but it is politics that has made Handke notorious, producing the frowns at the Nobel ceremony. In early 1996, six months after Serbs massacred more than eight thousand Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica—the greatest atrocity on European soil since the Holocaust—Handke took a trip through Serbia. In his travelogue, which appeared in English under the title “A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia,” Handke heaped scorn on the Western journalists who reported from Yugoslavia, accusing them of bias and corruption. In his account, the Serbs come across as charming, cultured hosts, their food delicious, their countryside pastoral, their political circumstances perplexing and unearned.\n\nThere was outrage from journalists and critics, but Handke doubled down. In the spring of 1999, as the U.S. and NATO allies began a bombing campaign intended to drive the Serbs out of Kosovo, he visited Belgrade to demonstrate his support for Slobodan Milošević’s regime. A few months later, according to the American journalist Peter Maass, Handke was granted a Yugoslav passport. When Milošević died, in 2006, Handke delivered a eulogy at his funeral.\n\nTwenty-three years after Handke first waded into these troubled waters, the announcement of his Nobel Prize brought a further chorus of denunciation. The Holocaust scholar Deborah Lipstadt expressed concern that the prize would give legitimacy to his false claims; the former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, who had reported on Srebrenica as a journalist, tweeted that the genocide was an “undeniable fact.” A member of the Swedish Academy announced that he would boycott the proceedings. Handke remained uncowed. When Maass confronted him at the Nobel press conference, Handke dismissed his questions as “empty and ignorant.”\n\nHandke’s defenders argue that his Serbian adventure is essentially an excrescence, with little bearing on his work. The Austrian daily Die Presse opined that, as Handke’s work had “long been considered part of world literature,” the sad fact that he had “lost his way in the thicket of the Balkans” shouldn’t disqualify him from the Nobel. Yet perhaps the most distinctive quality of Handke’s art is that it has always been inseparable from the persona of its creator. A new collection of his essays, “Quiet Places” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), demonstrates that, regardless of whether Handke labels a work fiction or nonfiction, his technique remains much the same—the tone discursive, the narratives eddying and associative, the point of view inward and subjective. Indeed, Handke has said that he wrote about Serbia “exactly as I have always written my books, my literature: a slow, inquiring narration; every paragraph dealing with and narrating a problem, of representation, of form, of grammar—of aesthetic veracity.” Rather than a departure from his literary work, Handke’s position on Serbia may be of a piece with it—a logical consequence of the postmodern experimentation for which he has long been celebrated.\n\n“The beginning of my writing,” Handke has said, was “the stories my mother told.” Born in 1942 in an impoverished provincial town in southern Austria, the illegitimate son of his mother and her married lover, he was raised by his mother and an abusive stepfather. His consolation as a child was her tales of people from her birthplace, known only as Stara Vas, or Old Village.\n\nHandke likes to tell two of his mother’s stories as a pair: they show up in several of his works, including “The Fruit Thief.” In one, his mother’s younger brother runs away from a boarding school and walks home, a journey of some forty kilometres. He arrives in the middle of the night on a Saturday, which is the day that the courtyard gets swept. So the boy picks up a broom and sweeps until daybreak, when the family discovers him.\n\nThe other story concerns a baby boy, the child of a “retarded milkmaid” who works on a local farm and was raped by the farmer. The farmer and his wife adopt the child, and the milkmaid is told to stay away from the boy, who grows up thinking that the farmer’s wife is his mother. One day, the milkmaid hears the boy screaming for help: he has got tangled in a barbed-wire fence. She runs over and unhooks him. Later, the little boy asks his presumed mother, “Why does the stupid girl have such gentle hands?”\n\nBoth stories have the quality of a fairy tale: the boy who sweeps the courtyard in the night by rote, as if bewitched; the foundling child who retains a connection to his mother even as others try to conceal it from him. And both are about the gulf between parents and children, and the often futile efforts to overcome that gulf—themes that haunt Handke’s work. Handke often emphasizes not an event but, rather, a seemingly minor moment, the significance of which the person who experiences it does not even recognize.\n\nIn 1971, a few years after Handke published his first novel, his mother, suffering from debilitating headaches and depression, killed herself, at the age of fifty-one. In the aftermath, Handke poured out the anguished, stammering text that constitutes “A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” which was published the following year and remains the book for which he is best known in English. Like many of the novels that would follow, it chronicles a journey both exterior and interior: Handke’s return to his home town for his mother’s funeral, and also his investigation of her life, which quickly becomes an investigation of the limits of language to express what he wishes to communicate. Completed in only two months, the text has a frantic, driven quality. “My mother has been dead for almost seven weeks; I had better get to work before the need to write about her, which I felt so strongly at her funeral, dies away and I fall back into the dull speechlessness with which I reacted to the news of her suicide,” he says at the start.\n\nThat “speechlessness,” it soon becomes clear, is a characteristic of both contemporary life and contemporary literature. Handke had already written a play, “Kaspar” (1967), inspired by the real-life story of Kaspar Hauser, a teen-age boy who appeared mysteriously in early-nineteenth-century Bavaria, knowing only a single sentence, having apparently been raised without language. In “A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” the narrative enacts the breakdown of language and form as Handke attempts to relate the facts of his mother’s life—her affair with his father, a bank clerk; her dissatisfaction with any subsequent love; her physical torment as she aged. Conventional narrative strategies such as description or characterization frustrate him. “She refuses to be isolated and remains unfathomable; my sentences crash in the darkness and lie scattered on the paper,” he writes.\n\nDispassionately, Handke reports on his own dispassion; he is interested in his mother’s story less as an exploration of her character than as an intellectual exercise. In an introduction to a 2006 reissue of the book, Jeffrey Eugenides wrote, “The most striking thing about the book is Handke’s disciplined detachment from his subject, a mode of inquiry that offers nothing remedial or heartwarming.” Even so, there are moments when an image or an episode rises from the text with luminous emotion. Here is Handke on his mother’s affair:\n\nShe herself thought it comical that she had once loved someone, especially a man like him. He was smaller than she, many years older, and almost bald; she walked beside him in low-heeled shoes, always at pains to adapt her step to his, her hand repeatedly slipping off his inhospitable arm; an ill-matched, ludicrous couple. And yet, twenty years later, she still longed to feel for someone what she had felt then for that savings-bank wraith.\n\nThis image of the mismatched couple—the man such an unlikely object of desire—has a helpless pathos worthy of Chekhov.\n\n“Repetition” was also inspired by Handke’s mother’s life, although more obliquely. It follows the protagonist, Filip Kobal, on a journey through Slovenia in search of an older brother, who has been missing for two decades, since deserting from the German Army. For Filip, and indeed the entire family, Slovenia represents a kind of lost paradise. “What can one say to express the simultaneous experience of childhood and landscape?” Handke asks. There is a German word for this, naturally: Kindschaft, which might be translated in this context as “childscape,” and that is the terrain Filip covers.\n\nThe novel unfolds at a meandering pace, with a quality that Sebald characterized as “lightness.” He meant “not that the narrator is carefree or lighthearted; but instead of talking about his burdens, he turns to his senses in order to produce something that could help him and his reader—who may also be in need of comfort—to resist the temptation of melancholy.” Those sensory descriptions, vividly realized, include the experiences of the narrator (the night he spends in a train tunnel is as vivid as Handke’s mother’s love for the “savings-bank wraith”) and his impressions of the people he encounters. One is a road mender who moonlights as a sign painter, whom Sebald saw as an analogue for the writer, carrying out “his laborious work day after day,” virtually invisible to the world at large. The narrator watches him painting a sign, “conjuring up the next letter from the blank surface, as though it had been there all along and he was only retracing it.” Handke’s stories have a similar quality: at their most successful, they convey the impression that they already exist in nature, and the job of the writer is only to excavate them. His work seems to confirm Wittgenstein’s famous aphorism “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”\n\nHandke’s more recent output proceeds by much the same method, existing from moment to moment, with the narrator meditating associatively on whatever he observes. The subtitle of “The Fruit Thief” is “Einfache Fahrt ins Landsinnere,” a double pun. Einfache Fahrt means both “simple journey” and “one-way trip,” and Landsinnere is one of those German compound nouns for which no other language has an equivalent: Land means country, countryside, territory; innere is inside or interior. It’s a one-way journey into the interior of something: the country, or the characters’ minds. But it is also “simple,” in the sense that it is what it appears to be. The reader searching for an underlying meaning will be frustrated—better to go with the flow.\n\nThe action, such as it is, follows another Handke-like narrator from his home on the outskirts of Paris to the countryside, where the focus switches to the young woman the narrator is travelling to meet. Known as Alexia (which may or may not be her actual name), she is in her late twenties or early thirties, and her relationship to the narrator is initially unstated. He calls her “the fruit thief” because ever since childhood she has been unable to resist the allure of ripe fruit on a tree: pears, apples, peaches.\n\nAlexia is a vagabond, moving from place to place—Siberia, Alaska—apparently in search of her mother, who has somehow been lost to her. There are episodes in which Alexia seems to break down, but the emotion that Handke conjured in his early work is absent here. This is clearly a deliberate narrative choice to convey her state of mind. “She felt as if she were in [two] places, with everything around her even more intensely present,” Handke writes. “Dissociated, everything there became more intense, more distinct, and that included her, as part of everything there.”\n\nIn the absence of feeling, this sense of intense presentness is the book’s governing principle. The events of the plot seem arbitrary, even random. Alexia swims, fishes out of the River Oise a mug that’s drifting by, waves to Chinese tourists on a sightseeing boat, sees a huge fish, is followed by a dog and then by a raven. (“That was what the story called for,” Handke interjects.) She crashes a funeral and spends the night with the family of the deceased; she meets a delivery boy on a moped and travels with him for a while. In these long passages of rumination and description, time itself seems to dilate: “It’s in the meanwhiles, the in-between stretches, that things happen, take shape, develop, come into being.”\n\nIt is hard to describe what, exactly, comes into being here. “The happenings that this story is narrating become that solely thanks to the narrator,” Handke writes. The narrator, highlighting the artifices of fiction, never lets us forget that he is a narrator. “Cut. Next scene,” Handke writes when he wants to move things along. When there is some factual detail he can’t recall, he tells the reader to “look it up on the Internet.” There is pleasure in watching this narrative wend its leisurely way to a conclusion, but its three-hundred-plus densely packed pages seem to take a long time to get there.\n\nOne of the essays in “Quiet Places” is called “Essay on a Mushroom Maniac.” An old friend of Handke’s becomes obsessed with mushroom foraging. Interested in nothing else, he stops reading any books other than ones about mushrooms, stops going to the movies or taking trips, and neglects both family and professional obligations. Mushrooms, Handke writes, “were the ultimate adventure, and he was their prophet.”\n\nAt this point—around three-quarters of the way through this nearly hundred-page essay—I wrote in the margin, “I’m starting to wonder whether this is really about mushrooms.” I was beginning to see echoes of Handke’s obsession with Serbia. The mushroom hunter is a lawyer whose work exonerates war criminals, and the account ends with something like an acknowledgment of error: “Mushroom seeking, and seeking of any kind, caused one’s field of vision to shrink. . . . And how one’s eyes weighed down one’s head when they remained fixed on the ground, and became dulled.”\n\nBut Handke has shown no remorse for his own error, no recognition that his single-minded line of inquiry might have shrunk his perspective. He continues to assert that he has done nothing wrong, that the questions he has asked—about the motivations for the Srebrenica massacre, which he considers unexplained; about the bias he perceives among Western journalists who reported Serb aggression and Bosnian suffering—serve the goal of “justice.” His defenders have argued that, since he writes “dialectically,” it is easy for individual sentences, taken out of context, to be misunderstood. When I began reading “A Journey to the Rivers,” I was prepared to believe that Handke had been misinterpreted, but the book was even more maddening than I could have imagined. Handke states outright that he rarely asks questions of people he encounters, relying instead on his imagination and assumptions.\n\nSome erstwhile Handke admirers have tried to explain his obsession with Serbia as driven by dismay over the breakup of the “great Yugoslavia” that his mother’s stories had primed him to cherish. “After 1991, Handke needed a new myth, and he discovered it in Serbia,” J. S. Marcus wrote in The New York Review of Books in 2000. Handke prefers to identify with the underdog, as he perceived Serbia to be in the face of the West. And he has said that when Slovenia declared independence it was “as if I had lost my home, which became a state, where there was really only a people and a landscape.”\n\nIn a way, however, “A Journey to the Rivers” is no more maddening than Handke’s fiction, which relies on a similar dialectic of push and pull, denying resolution or reality for a world that appears to be willed into being through language. And as such it forms a logical, if regrettable, end point for Handke’s ideas. As Eugenides has pointed out, American postmodernism, as practiced by writers such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Robert Coover, was political in nature: these writers’ distrust of narrative omniscience was linked to their distrust of the U.S. government. By contrast, Handke’s fiction, though similar in appearance—the circling and recircling style, the rejection of literary conventions—was always centered on language rather than on politics. “The American postmodernists gave up on traditional storytelling out of an essentially playful, optimistic, revolutionary urge,” Eugenides writes. “Handke despairs of narrative out of sheer despair.”\n\nIn Handke’s literary universe, only the self can be the final arbiter of meaning. The eye gazes from the window and records what it sees, while acknowledging that another observer might see something different. When some music plays in “The Fruit Thief,” we are told, “It did not really matter what music it was. Everyone who reads this is welcome to imagine any music that seems to fit.” But the idea that the facts of a situation can be whatever we say they are sounds different now from the way it may have thirty or forty years ago. Some realities—the mass graves at Srebrenica, or, more recently, the outcome of an election legally conducted—cannot be treated “dialectically.” Another line from Wittgenstein comes to mind, one often invoked to express the dangers of trying to describe the enormity of the Holocaust: “What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.” ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled J. S. Marcus’s name and misidentified the nationality of the passport Peter Handke was given. It has also been updated to clarify that a description of a character in “The Fruit Thief” contains quoted material."
