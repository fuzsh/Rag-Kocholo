        "text": "Editors' Suggestion\n\nActive shape control by plants in dynamic environments\n\nHadrien Oliveri, Derek E. Moulton, Heather A. Harrington, and Alain Goriely\n\nPhys. Rev. E 110, 014405 (2024) – Published 12 July 2024\n\nPlants generally orient their growth against the direction of gravity. Rotating them around an axis perpendicular to gravity can produce more complicated growth shapes that depend on the speed of rotation. The authors model this behavior and find a stable family of three-dimensional dynamic equilibria.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nSpace-resolved dynamic light scattering within a millimeter-sized drop: From Brownian diffusion to the swelling of hydrogel beads\n\nMatteo Milani, Ty Phou, Guillame Prevot, Laurence Ramos, and Luca Cipelletti\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 064613 (2024) – Published 27 June 2024\n\nPhoton correlation spectroscopy is used to examine microscopic dynamics of Brownian suspensions within small spherical droplets. The authors first validate the setup and then demonstrate the method with a study of the shrinking and swelling of millimeter-sized polymer hydrogel beads. Their space-resolved measurements provide new information on microscopic rearrangements occurring during gel swelling.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nUniversal characterization of epitope immunodominance from a multiscale model of clonal competition in germinal centers\n\nFederica Ferretti and Mehran Kardar\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 064409 (2024) – Published 20 June 2024\n\nThe authors introduce a model for B cell affinity maturation, the process by which a B cell acquires specificity for an introduced antigen. They consider how vaccination with two antigens with the same subdominant antigenic region affects the antibody pool. Their results suggest guidelines for preparation of antigen cocktails that generate broadly neutralizing antibodies.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nPhase-space entropy cascade and irreversibility of stochastic heating in nearly collisionless plasma turbulence\n\nMichael L. Nastac, Robert J. Ewart, Wrick Sengupta, Alexander A. Schekochihin, Michael Barnes, and William D. Dorland\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 065210 (2024) – Published 14 June 2024\n\nThis paper investigates, by means of an analytically solvable one-dimensional model, the dissipation in a turbulent, nearly collisionless plasma. When applying a stochastic, external electric field, it is reported that the generalized entropy of the distribution function cascades from large to small scales in position and velocity space, rendering the stochastic heating irreversible.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nBehavioral transition of a fish school in a crowded environment\n\nBruno Ventéjou, Iris Magniez- -Papillon, Eric Bertin, Philippe Peyla, and Aurélie Dupont\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 064403 (2024) – Published 11 June 2024\n\nThis is an investigation of collective motion of fish swimming in the presence of obstacles. The authors analyzed trajectories of zebrafish swimming in a tank with varying densities of pillars. As the density of pillars increased, the experiments exhibited a transition from mostly aligned fish, to fish oriented along the axes of the pillar lattice. The authors considered the relative orientations of two fish and developed a stochastic model, which qualitatively reproduced the experimental data.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nHydrodynamic synchronization of elastic cilia: How surface effects determine the characteristics of metachronal waves\n\nAlbert von Kenne, Markus Bär, and Thomas Niedermayer\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 054407 (2024) – Published 16 May 2024\n\nA model for coordinated motion of cilia is examined in this work. In this model, wave dynamics of cilia are represented by motions of microspheres elastically bound to circular orbits that are inclined with respect to a no-slip surface. Parameters are explored with analytical studies and simulations. The authors demonstrate traveling waves whose dynamics and direction may be tuned by the elasticity.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nCurvature-induced clustering of cell adhesion proteins\n\nShao-Zhen Lin, Jacques Prost, and Jean-François Rupprecht\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 054406 (2024) – Published 9 May 2024\n\nCell adhesion proteins bind the cell membrane to its environment and, at the same time, aggregate into stable clusters. In this paper, the proteins’ sensing of the cell membrane curvature is investigated as a mechanism to stabilize these clusters, predicting the emergence of diverse spatial patterns.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFeatured in Physics\n\nBoosting reservoir computer performance with multiple delays\n\nS. Kamyar Tavakoli and André Longtin\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 054203 (2024) – Published 8 May 2024\n\nViewpoint: Time Delays Improve Performance of Certain Neural Networks\n\nBoth the predictive power and the memory storage capability of an artificial neural network called a reservoir computer increase when time delays are added into how the network processes signals, according to a new model.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFeatured in Physics Editors' Suggestion 1 citation\n\nFilamentation of a relativistic proton bunch in plasma\n\nL. Verra et al. (AWAKE Collaboration)\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 055203 (2024) – Published 7 May 2024\n\nSynopsis: Filamentation Observed in Wakefield Acceleration\n\nWhen injected into a plasma, a proton bunch triggers oscillatory phenomena which can lead to different instability regimes. The authors present experimental evidence of the appearance of the oblique two-stream instability, generating filamentation in the bunch-plasma system, in accordance with theoretical and numerical predictions.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nEstimator of entropy production for partially accessible Markov networks based on the observation of blurred transitions\n\nBenjamin Ertel and Udo Seifert\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 054109 (2024) – Published 6 May 2024\n\nIn stochastic thermodynamics, entropy production can be estimated for physical systems with a Markovian description. For realistic situations the full Markovian description may not be accessible, and this paper uses an information-theoretic bound to establish an effective approach for such a scenario.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nUsing reservoir computing to construct scarred wave functions\n\nL. Domingo, J. Borondo, and F. Borondo\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 044214 (2024) – Published 26 April 2024\n\nScarred functions serve as a basis to calculate eigenstates in quantum chaotic systems, and are useful to study the correspondence between classical and quantum systems in the presence of chaos. In this paper, the authors propose a method, based on a machine learning algorithm, to calculate the scarred functions and corresponding eigenstates of the coupled quartic oscillator, and they report that the algorithm increases accuracy and reduces the execution time.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFeatured in Physics Editors' Suggestion Letter 2 citations\n\nEvidence of scale-free clusters of vegetation in tropical rainforests\n\nPablo Villegas, Tommaso Gili, Guido Caldarelli, and Andrea Gabrielli\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, L042402 (2024) – Published 19 April 2024\n\nFocus: Uncovering Networks in Rainforest Plants\n\nThe distribution of vegetation clusters in a tropical rainforest shows evidence of scale-invariance, suggesting a system close to a critical state. This observation could help to diagnose the health of rainforests and other ecosystems in the face of environmental change.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nProbe particles in odd active viscoelastic fluids: How activity and dissipation determine linear stability\n\nCharlie Duclut, Stefano Bo, Ruben Lier, Jay Armas, Piotr Surówka, and Frank Jülicher\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 044126 (2024) – Published 10 April 2024\n\nOdd viscoelastic materials obey fewer symmetries than traditional materials, and as a consequence exhibit unusual features. This paper reports an investigation into the motion of a probe particle in an odd viscoelastic fluid, as a means to explore the consequences of the broken symmetries.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nDislike of general opinion makes for tight elections\n\nO. Devauchelle, P. Szymczak, and P. Nowakowski\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 044106 (2024) – Published 4 April 2024\n\nThe authors investigate an Ising model of an electorate in which voters are influenced by opinion polls, as well as by their neighbors. The voters hold one of two opposite opinions. The work shows that opinion polls tend to bring about polarized societies, with spatially separated groups having different opinions. The authors discuss factors that influence the voters and note that electorates with greater than a million voters tend to have very close elections.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion 2 citations\n\nPair filamentation and laser scattering in beam-driven QED cascades\n\nKenan Qu, Alec Griffith, and Nathaniel J. Fisch\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 035208 (2024) – Published 27 March 2024\n\nAccording to quantum electrodynamics, in very strong electromagnetic fields electron–positron pairs can be created, and with a high density of pairs an electron-positron plasma can form. In this paper, the authors simulate this process for a relativistic electron beam colliding with an intense laser pulse, and identify observations that could be used as diagnostics in future experiments.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nIdentifying hubs in directed networks\n\nAlec Kirkley\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 034310 (2024) – Published 20 March 2024\n\nNodes with high connectivity, also called hubs, play a critical role in determining the structural and functional properties of networked systems. The author develops classification methods for directed networks that provide a definition of network hubs, and demonstrates them in a range of example applications.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion 2 citations\n\nInteraction of soliton gases in deep-water surface gravity waves\n\nLoic Fache, Félicien Bonnefoy, Guillaume Ducrozet, François Copie, Filip Novkoski, Guillaume Ricard, Giacomo Roberti, Eric Falcon, Pierre Suret, Gennady El, and Stéphane Randoux\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 034207 (2024) – Published 15 March 2024\n\nA soliton gas, a large random ensemble of solitons, does not reach thermodynamic equilibrium because there are infinitely many conserved quantities. The authors report water wave experiments with two interacting jets of soliton gases, and find good quantitative agreement with the predictions of spectral kinetic theory.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion 2 citations\n\nShape effects in the fluctuations of random isochrones on a square lattice\n\nIván Álvarez Domenech, Javier Rodríguez-Laguna, Rodolfo Cuerno, Pedro Córdoba-Torres, and Silvia N. Santalla\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 034104 (2024) – Published 4 March 2024\n\nIn first-passage percolation one is interested in the region that can be reached from an origin within a given time. The authors show that on a square lattice with disorder, the boundary of this region behaves as a fluctuating interface in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion 2 citations\n\nCurrent fluctuations in a partially asymmetric simple exclusion process with a defect particle\n\nIvan Lobaskin, Martin R. Evans, and Kirone Mallick\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 024127 (2024) – Published 23 February 2024\n\nAn exclusion process on a ring is studied in this paper, where the presence of a defect particle immersed in a bath of normal particles leads to phase transitions between localized and shock phases. The authors use the functional Bethe ansatz to analytically compute the mean current and, for the first time, the diffusion constant, and report good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion 2 citations\n\nDiscord in the voter model for complex networks\n\nAntoine Vendeville, Shi Zhou, and Benjamin Guedj\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 024312 (2024) – Published 21 February 2024\n\nThe formation and evolution of opinion in social networks is a topic receiving increasing attention. By employing the multistate voter model on a network, the authors derive a general method to compute the probability of disagreement between a pair of agents in the model, which is applicable to any directed, weighted network.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nMean-field method for generic conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons with finite timescales\n\nMarcelo P.

Buckling time is independent of temperature.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFeatured in Physics Editors' Suggestion 8 citations\n\nObservations and properties of the first laboratory fusion experiment to exceed a target gain of unity\n\nA. Pak et al.\n\nPhys. Rev. E 109, 025203 (2024) – Published 5 February 2024\n\nViewpoint: Nuclear-Fusion Reaction Beats Breakeven\n\nThe target gain greater than unity achieved in a recent fusion experiment was made possible by using additional laser energy at fixed power and controlling sources of degradation. This resulted in increased compression of the fuel and a high fusion yield corresponding to a novel physical regime. This paper describes the experimental evidence for these critical aspects and new observables.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFeatured in Physics Editors' Suggestion 8 citations\n\nDesign of the first fusion experiment to achieve target energy gain G>1\n\nA.
