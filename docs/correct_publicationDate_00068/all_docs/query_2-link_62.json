        "text": "Mike seems to go todash when he visits the Freburg Fair, and returns to the real world via a door. The house is a twinner of the house in the last book in the series, and some of the places in the area are mentioned in both books. The house seems to slip through time, and into other worlds and the air around it is \"Thin\", an 'Outsider' possesses and enhances the ghost of Sara Tidwell this outsider is from another world, maybe Rolands. Kyra ia probably the cause of the events in this book, with the antagonists being possible agents of the Crimson King, trying to make Kyra a Breaker.\n\nSubmitted by: Sieman\n\nVery near the beginning, pg462, the initial narrator, David, mentions a set of 11 books he came across at \"The Club\" by an author named Edward Grey Seville. \"The date of the last, 'Breakers',was 1935.\" Published by Stedham & Son. On pg471 he mentions a \"slithery bump\" coming from one of the \"unexplored rooms\" Possibly the worm creature that chases the crew in part4 section1 of DT VII? On pg477 is another quick mention of the mystery publisher Stedham & Son. And on pg517 is the clincher. David asks Stevens, the \"caretaker\" of \"The Club\", about there being more rooms in the building. To which he replies...\"A great many. A man could become lost..... \"Entrances and exits.\" There are some other references to an unusual pool table and jukebox as well on pg517. And all of this, of course, exists at 249B East Thirty-fifth street in good old New York which we all know is very pesky for having all these dangerous doors just laying around. :)\n\nSubmitted by: Gabriel Godwin\n\nNot all page references went through. All references are found in paperback as follows: 6, 16, 24-25, 141-142, 150, 402, 438, 448 As for the description, read on: The main character sells a comic he has drawn called the Dark Wanderer, likely a curious combination of the name Dark Tower and a description of the gunslinger who wanders the wastes. On page 150, in describing a six shooter revolver the book mentions the main character drawing many like it in the Dark Wanderer. This is likely a connection to Roland's guns. On page 402, it says \"Dark Wanderer was kaput\". This may be a clever reference to Ka. On page 438 we find the line \"Stick with you apocalypse cowboys.\" This seems to describe a ka-tet of gunslingers in a world that has moved on pretty well.\n\nSubmitted by: Derek Ehrmantraut\n\nOne of the last people to see James Cogan in Denver is referred to as \"George the artist, be he Ranklin or Franklin...\" RF is a common pseudonym for the man in black. I believe, and may very well be off, that when Cogan tells this man he wants \"real coffee at Starbucks\" (which wasn't in Denver yet) that he opened a portal for him to travel time and space. He went to Russia and got the coin, and probably went on some strange adventure that took awhile. When he got back he was in Maine, and after all the time he spent getting back he told the ferryman \"it's been a long time.\" He thought he was home free, but someone (RF, perhaps) didn't want him able to travel freely across the multiverse, as this is a particularly powerful tool.\n\nSubmitted by: Chris Calcagno\n\nDoctor Sleep has the feel of a DT novel, but not many connections. However Dan says \"There are other worlds than these\" at one point. The True Knot member Silent Sarey has the ability to become \"Dim\". It is possible that the True not are demons from Rolands world, there Turning in and Cycling out is possibly them being brought through to inhabit a human body. Abra is the most powerful \"wonderchild\" that SK has introduced, and leads to thoughts of how powerful she (And Dan) would have been as breakers. And perhaps the events of the Shining were low men trying to get hold of Dan. Abra and Kyra from Bag of Bones could be twinners as they both communicate in a similar way (Smiley faces in spilled sugar etc)The overlook area is one of SK's thin places, where ghosts and other supernatural beings become the norm, the house in Bag of Bones is the same and in that book an \"Outsider\" from Rolands world possesses and enhances Sarah Tidwells ghost. The same seems to be true in Doctor Sleep/The Shining with the ghost of Horace Derwent as he has become a Monster in the lock box in Dan's mind where other ghosts became ash. Dans ability to hide out in a memory is also a familiar theme in DT novels.\n\nSubmitted by: Sieman\n\nThere are several references to the Dark Tower Series. Edgar refers to himself as a \"gunslinger\" (pg 433). One of Edgar's major works is \"Roses Grow from Shells.\" His ex-wife tattoos a rose onto her breast. Roses are also mentioned several times in the novel. The main antagonist wears a red robe similar to that of the Crimson King. His daughter's name ( Ilse Marie Freemantle) has 19 letters in it. Edgar's E-mail is EFree19 and his real estate agent's is SmithReality9505, both of which have numbers the amount to 19, which constant readers will recognize. Along with these other \"19's\", the first big storm (or \"Alice\") occurred in 1927, which when added together makes 19; and the flight he takes to Florida is flight 559. Pam's room number is 847 which added together is 19. Edgar's artistic abilities seem to parallel those of Patrick Danville, especially the ability to remove things from reality by drawing and then erasing them. Nan Melda loses two fingers on her right hand on a beach, which also happens to Roland Deschain at the beginning of the Drawing of the Three. Charley the Lawn Jockey (pg 568) shares the name of Charlie the Choo Choo, and the root \"char,\" meaning death, also echoed when Edgar thinks about having people sit in the \"char\" when he has to think sideways to mean \"chair\". In one passage of the book, Edgar compares life to a wheel, in the sense of always coming around to the beginning, one of the main philosophies of the Dark Tower. The idea that drawings or paintings can change reality is another recurring motive.\n\nSubmitted by: Zack\n\nNot on page 55 but I dont know which pages exactly as i dont have a copy of \"Duma Key\" right in front of me. In wizard and glass near the end, when Susan and Olive Thorin run into Three men on the trail to the caves, the last remaining big coffin hunter, Sai Reynolds, shrugs and tells Susan \"Maybe si, Maybe no,\" When she informs him that his compadres are dead. That phrase is used by one of the main characters (Jerome Wireman) in Duma Key consistently throughout the book. Also, the \"Big Pink\" house in Duma Key might also have something to do with Maerlyns rainbow (the pink glass ball) in Wizard and Glass as well. Especially considering that Edgar sees roses in most of his paintings.\n\nSubmitted by: Farthoven\n\nLook at the hardback Expanded Edition of \"The Gunslinger\" Page 7, Lines 28 and 29 to find this quote: \"It spoke of a man who might straighten bad pictures in strange hotel rooms.\" This is not new to the Expanded edition as this same sentence is found in the previous edition of \"The Gunslinger\", just look in the limited edition hardback by Donald M. Grant (third printing 1998) put in a three book box set edition on Page 14, Lines 16 and 17. Now go to the story \"1408\" first put out in the audiobook of \"Blood and Smoke\" and printed in \"Everything's Eventual\" copyright 2002. I refer to the Pocket Books printing of January 2003 on Pages 488 and 489. On Page 488 Lines 18 and 19 say, \"What Mike had noticed at that point were the pictures on the walls.\" Same Page, Lines 24 and 25 say, \"All three pictures were in glass frames and all three were crooked.\" Finally, on Page 489, Lines 5-7 say, \"Although he was not ordinarily a fussy nam, he circled the room, setting them straight.\" These are exact quotes and considering the finality of the story called \"1408\", I'd say this is a definitive \"Dark Tower\" tie-in/reference.\n\nSubmitted by: David\n\nThe thing that has been following Trisha gets describes in pages 244-246 as a large Black Bear with maggots in it's eye sockets and was diseased/dying, and implied to be insane (I'm paraphrasing). At this point, we have a direct parallel to Shardik from book three, \"The Wastelands\". (Large Bear, dying, insane, diseased with maggots and such and in Shardik's case: he's a Machine/cyborg) Trisha's beast gets the Name: \"The God of the Lost\" on pg.244, and Shardik was a \"lost\" Guardian of the Tower! On pg.245 \"The God of the Lost\" shows it's power/aggression by crunching a broken branch in it's mouth making a sound like \"splintering bone\". Very much like Shardik shoving down all the dead trees so noisely in \"Wastelands\". When \"the God of the Lost\" is about to kill Trisha it is shot by Travis Herrick, who surprises it, allowing her to throw her baseball striking it \"deadbang between the eyes\" (just where Shardik's \"dish\" was that was shot to kill him!) And the final funny is when Trisha Hallucinates seeing a couple of \"..Energizer batteries fall out of it onto the road.\" when she hits the Bear with the ball!!(pg. 253) Yet another cyborg machine reference?! You tell Me!!\n\nSubmitted by: Philip Garrett\n\nWas re-listening to The Green Mile today, and have so far heard three small connections in the first of the six books. The first is the location of Old Sparky, the electric chair, which is positioned in the southeast corner of the storage area. The second involves the flashback to the hunt for the kidnapped girls: when the tracking dogs disagree on what direction to go, it turns out that William Warton had gone northeast along the river (opposite the direction the ka-tet travels, and the same direction Walter takes after tricking Roland and reaching the Western Sea), while John Coffey and the twins were to the southeast. Strikes me as the kind of connection discussed by Roland and the heads of the Tet Corporation, a sort of message from (the) undermind of Stephen King. The second connection Ive found so far involves Mr. Jingles first visit to The Mile. After he leaves, when Brutal takes out the visitors log, and Dean asks what he thinks he is doing, Brutal responds Obeying regulation 19. Again, the connection is tenuous, but it is definitely there. Ill try to remember to post anything else that shows up.\n\nSubmitted by: Tripp\n\nThis show (Haven) seems to have many DT references. In the opening credits there is an old scroll with Flagg in huge letters. Something to the effect of \"Flagg the revered to hold a method of...\" One of the episodes is about a man with the ability to detach his shadow and kill. This shadow is referred to by the townspeople as The Dark Man. Flagg in the DT is referred to as The Dark Man. Another episode features a photographer telling the detectives that out of the water came these lobster creatures while investigating the death of the Colorado Kid. Possibly the same lobster monstrosities that took off part of Roland's hand? The town Haven is constantly referred to in almost every episode as having \"troubles.\" These troubles apparently have been there before but have been away for many years and have now returned. Could this town possibly be a nexus/door connecting it to Roland's world?\n\nSubmitted by: Mikeeinseattle\n\n\"The janitor who saw them later identified the man as Raymond Fiegler, head of the MSP. He identified the young woman as Carol Gerber.\" A man with the initials RF was the leader of a student protest group that set off a campus bomb and killed people. Randall Flagg was known to go by other names, usually with the initials RF. Also, on page 516, Carol says, \"I'm good at not being seen,\" she said. \"It's a trick someone taught me a long time ago. The trick of being DIM.\" Walter sometimes was called Walter O'Dim, for his ability to fade into the background and not be seen. Walter and Randall Flagg were later discovered to be one in the same. This shows that Carol had run ins with both the good (Ted) and bad (Walter/RF) forces of the Tower.\n\nSubmitted by: Dcapulet\n\nThese are probably too obvious to point out, but twice Bobby Garfield refers to \"other worlds than this.\" The first time it's a direct quote from Jake's line when he falls in the mines in The Gunslinger. Also, there's an interesting parallel structure between the two plots that I assume must have been intentional - both Ted and Roland play a sort of adopted father figure, pretty damn near explicitly, to Bobby and Jake. Jake says this line as Roland is about to lose him, whereas Bobby says it when he's about to lose Ted. In a way, though, the loss is identical, since Ted is removed to the keystone world leaving Bobby in a \"normal\" one, whereas Jake went to a normal one leaving Roland in the keystone world.\n\nSubmitted by: Brian Bilford\n\nHey guys, sorry,I'm from Germany therefore I'm reading the German version of Hearts in Atlantis. Still i guess that this one should be equal to the original version. When Ted and Bobby are escaping from the Low Men the first time (they are in this cab and try to block their minds from them), Bobby is saying something very similar to Jake in the first DT book. When Bobby is blocking his mind by using the adult Carol coming out of the shower it's mentioned that there are \"other worlds than these\". Go then, there are other worlds than these. Well ,maybe not a major reference, but i kinda liked it for being very subtile and only recognizable for DT readers. Here s a link to the German Version of the book if this is of any help: http://www.amazon.de/Atlantis-Roman-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B004SBMND4/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1405871032&sr=8-6&keywords=atlantis\n\nSubmitted by: Oliver Tyrala\n\nAlthough this movie was not written by Stephen King, there are many connections to the Dark Tower series, or at least ideas that come from them. One of the connections is that the author in the movie (Sutter Cain or Souder Kane, very similar sounding to Stephen King, maybe the Stephen King of another world) is writing things that are coming true, much like the Stephen King from the Dark Tower series. Another similarity is the roads which cross over between worlds, much like Father Callahan used to walk between worlds. My favorite connection, however, is the dark space between the worlds and the monsters that dwell in them. Towards the end of the movie those monsters escape from the Darkness (through a DOOR i might add) and chase after the main character. Again, although it is NOT a Stephen King work, it does re-explore his ideas in a fun way.\n\nSubmitted by: Brandon\n\nFrom The Waste Lands: Eddie and Susannah are on their way to the Cradle when the Pubes attack them (so to speak). Once they had killed a few the Pubes stopped but one guy urged them on. He's described as \"...bald except for two fluffs of frizzy hair, one on each side. To Susannah, this fellow looked like Clarabell the Clown; to Eddie he looked like Ronald McDonald...\" In \"It\" (also from signet, on page 12) George sees Pennywise in the drain and thinks that he looks \"...like a cross between Bozo and Clarabell...\" and says that had he been alive a year later, \"...he would have surely thought of Ronald McDonald before Bozo or Clarabell.\" And Pennywise is described as having \"...funny tufts of red hair on either side of his bald head...\" I belive that the man in the mob who Eddie shoots is Pennywise, or a version of him.\n\nSubmitted by: John\n\nI see a connection here from either DT 6 or 7. From how Stephen King, when he writes his DT books, it's coming from somewhere else, how when he hears the song he then starts writing about Roland and his Ka-tet until he is sure he doesn't hear it anymore. In the DT Stephen King mentions how when he wrote those stories they all just sort of seemed to come to him, like he had no control. I think it is because it comes from that outerspace in which Bill talks about in the paragraph I submitted, where Bill got the word \"shockflesh\".\n\nSubmitted by: Bryan Perry\n\nChapter 8 Part 4 - \"They ceased pushing, and Brian carefully climbed down the ladder until his head was on level with the underside of the Delta jet's wing. Both the 767 and 727 were equipped with single-point fuelling ports in the left wing. He was now looking at a small square hatch with the words FUEL TANK ACCESS and CHECK SHUT-OFF VALVE BEFORE REFUELLING stenciled across it. And some wit had pasted a round yellow happy-face sticker to the fuel hatch. It was the final surreal touch.\" Since the yellow happy-face sticker is a known symbol that Randall Flagg wears on his jacket; this would suggest that Randall Flagg was the \"wit\" that placed the sticker there. This means that Randall Flagg had a hand in American Pride Flight 29 going through the rip in time because he left one of his marks on the plane. The rip in time was like a Todash space. The Langoliers were the creatures that inhabited it.\n\nSubmitted by: Shaun Shaben\n\nIn the film \"The Mist\" about an hour or so (not sure) there is the scene in which the big ugly bugs break into the store and fatally wound the female clerk. A bit later one of the big \"mosquitos) approaches and threatens \"mrs. Carmody\" played by.Marcia Gay Harden.(Silvia Pittson anyone!?) In her attempt to avoid death she clearly states (just as the bug is going to sting ,and kill her. : MY LIFE FOR YOU! This is what \"Trashcan Man\" is well known to say as he serves Flag. After this the killer bug drifts up seems to \"look her in the eye\" and then backs off,sparing Marcia Gay Harden`s character. It took several viewings to finally see this. \"MY LIFE FOR YOU.\" I think it is the only time she says this.\n\nSubmitted by: Dave\n\nI would like to direct these Pre Raphaelite Art references to sai King himself as well as to readers of the Dark Tower series. In the Dark Tower novels 'the rose' could be interpreted variously. Perhaps each rose is a person or a soul. From a Christian perspective each rose is a tree of life. In a Tarot deck a rose could be a wheel of fortune wherein a person on the rim goes up an down at the whim of 'ka'. The center of the wheel or the heart of the rose in this case, is enlightenment, peace, or death. To abide in the heart of the rose is to be removed from the rolling ups and downs on the rim. I am including some links here to some Pre Raphaelite paintings by E. Burne-Jones. http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/paintings/pnp18.jpg. In this painting the woman reaches across the heart of the rose to grasp the hand of death. See others in series.\n\nSubmitted by: Laurie Thorson\n\nWithin Pet Sematary, several of the characters mention Oz the great and \"Tewwible\". If you remember in the Dark Tower series, Roland comes across the home of Oz on the way to the tower. In Oz's home is the Man in black... No Oz the Great, but Oz the tewwible is in the castle of Oz....Perhaps the Pet Sematary and the surrounding burial ground is some type of portal between worlds that the Man in Black (oz the tewwible) is using to cause havok.. Further evidence: When people are brought back, they know things they could not possibly know. Perhaps they are under the control of the man in black. That would explain how they have telepathic abilities.\n\nSubmitted by: Ryan Fults\n\nNumber 19: The Race car, Terry Morton and his father built, prominently has the '19' given to it. Furthermore, Astrid Soderbergs telephone number, she gives Charles Jacobs, is (207) 555 - 6454 - 6454 adds up to 19 Jamie's first band was called 'The Gunslingers' before Norm Irving renamed it to 'Chrome Roses'. Roses and Gunslingers are a main theme in The Dark Tower series. A general theme: The world, Charles Jacobs tries to look into looks like a world one would visit when ending up in todash darkness. The last one is a stretch, but bare with me (or remove it from the contribution, if you like :) ): One of Jamie Morton's teachers is 'Mrs. Moran' which we already know of 'IT'. Even though, Derry is not mentioned at all, she connects Revival to the Derry-stories and especially the story about clowns.\n\nSubmitted by: Tiberius\n\nThe man who was once a priest but is no longer one. In the first meeting I thought might be Callahan under a different name. He make a point of not wanting to be called \"Father.\" The second time Bart meets him I am sure after this paragraph \"Drake (the former priest) unfastened the rubber band, holding the bills with his left, manipulating with that oddly scarred right.\" Callahan has a scarred hand, he has left the church, and he refuses to be called father. The same a Drake in Roadwork. Stephen didn't even know or remember that he he was bringing a character from 'Salems Lot into this book. It's not highlighted as a connected book but it is. The Street Priest Drake is Don Callahan.\n\nSubmitted by: Dan\n\nok granted not a stephen king book, but it is a mini series that was penned by him. The points that i can make out with the dark tower are as follows, group of pychics go into a haunted house = Manni and the whispering cave although pyschics are not magicians to people in rolands time it would have been classed as a magic of the great old ones, the manni are mentioned as being able to open doors to where they do not know, so i drew the conclusion that where the pychics open the door to the afterlife it could be the same kind of way that the manni keep and hold the door open for rolands ka-tet\n\nSubmitted by: Daniel Willett\n\nIn The Stand, the character named Trash Can repeatedly says the phrase, \"My life for you!\" when referring to or speaking to Randell Flagg, a.k.a., R.F. In the Dark Tower book 3, The Waste Lands, on page 389, Richard Fannin (R.F.) says the following after healing Andrew's head: \"If you want to thank me--as I'm sure you do--you must say something an old acquaintance of mine used to say. He ended up betraying me, but he was a good friend for quite some time, anyway, and I still have a soft spot in my heart for him. Say, 'My life for you,' Andrew-- can you say that?\" Also in The Stand, when the first man to fall sick crashes into the gas station, he speaks of \"The Grinning Man,\" a recurring figure throughout the dark tower books.\n\nSubmitted by: Cass\n\nThere are MANY connections possibly showing that Andre Linoge very well may be Randall Flagg. 1. Both are Wizards with no remorse in killing humans. 2.Linoge wears the clothes of a regular guy, especially the jeans, the same as Flagg. 3.Linoge is a anagram for \"Legion\", a term Flagg has used for himself before. 4.Linoge, the same as Flagg, has a wild temper flair when something doesn't go the exact way he wants it too. 5.Linoge apparently walks into town, with a walking cane. Flagg is well known as the walking dude. 6.Both sit in the Indian style position. 7.Both use dreams to convey messages. 8.Both turn a woman's hair white when they have contact with her. 9.Linoge shows himself as a young man, a old wizard, and as a beast (Teeth). All of these can be lies and not his true form. Flagg also shape shifts at will. 10.Both use natural disasters to begin their activities. (Much like Pennywise) 11.Linoge uses the term \"Dimmer\" when pretending to be the Newscaster. Flagg is well known with this term/name. 12.Linoge and Flagg both know the bad things people have done and what they are most ashamed of. 13.It is said that since the Tower books never mention Flagg dying, and Linoge did, Linoge could have been lying about that. Also it is said that the boy he takes is never mentioned. It's possible Flagg kept it a secret. Obviously Linoge was very concerend about keeping it secret. Why? No one would have believed the town people anyway. Is it possible Flagg raised a son to look, act and speak like him? Maybe to sacrifice to Mordred? It would certainly make it easier for him to go about his business if he was presumed dead. Also it ties in with Linoge needing the boy to be a complete secret. In summerizing, it seems very possible that Flagg may have lived on and gained his entry into the Tower after Roland. It was after all, his chief concern. And with Mordred and the Crimson King dead, and Roland occupied...who could have stopped him?\n\nSubmitted by: Sean Hall\n\nThis is the scene where Jack is in the Agincourt Hotel, and he is fighting the last of the knights. He is describing his surroundings as he is flipping through a vast amount of worlds, and describes seeing a great many people who \"were beautiful but doomed, and so ghosts always seem to the living.\" This is very similar to when Roland is climbing the Dark Tower in the last book, and sees on each level different people in a similar fashion, both those he had known along the journey and those he had not, and were described as almost ghost like.\n\nSubmitted by: GunslingerPimp\n\nIt turns out this connection isn't real, but I thought it was while reading Under The Dome: Reverend Coggins said that a blind, mad man would be his sign. Then, one the children said \"He has a golden baseball\" I had just finished reading The Dark Tower VII, and these things struck me in two ways (before I found out there really wasn't a connection): 1. The Crimson King was hurling golden sneetches, wasn't he? Aren't those about the size of baseballs? 2. The Crimson King was erased to elsewhere without his eyes, and he was mad. So, midway through the book, I had thought that perhaps the Crimson King had manifested in this world instead of going to todash, and that he was responsible for the dome. Anyways, turned out different :-)\n\nSubmitted by: Kevin Hsu\n\nThe entire story, I believe is a direct connection to the worlds of the Tower. The pink Kindle, somehow went through one if the otherworld portals and ended up in the wrong hands. Shakespeare, as well as other famous writers lives changed slightly....one world even blows itself up because of human stupidity (Cuban Middle Crisis)... These are not \"alternate realities\" these are stories from different levels-worlds of the W Tower. When the rules are ignored and our worlds future is altered by saving the bus....the LOW MEN and their creepy ass car have to pay a visit. Hmmmm...that car. Mile 81. ..Buick 8..... but that's for another time...but my guess is that cars can act as a portal of sorts to other levels of the worlds....one has to wonder who REALLY manufactured the wagon and the\"Buick.... .o\n\nSubmitted by: Erin Machnik\n\nThe whole idea of the book (going back in time to prevent Kennedy's assassination) is actually present in Wolves of the Calla. Callahan says he's been thinking for a long time of using Black 13 to get to 1963, find out if Oswald acted on his own and maybe prevent him from killing Kennedy. Then Eddie looks at him and asks \"what if you did it and changed things for the worse ?\". Pretty much sums up the whole book. Plus Callahan uses the expression \"watershed moment\" to talk about Kennedy's assassination, which occurs a few times in 11/22/63. And the last connection I found is the \"white over red\" cars: Callahan escaped low men driving such a car while he was travelling the highways in hiding and Sadie's ex-husband is also driving a white over red car.\n\nSubmitted by: Hannah"
