        "text": "This article and it's contents are my own, they do not represent the views of my current, prior (or future) employer (s) ...\n\n\"So, what are you doing nowadays Suf?\"\n\nI was asked this question recently when I met some old friends. Why had I met them? well before explaining that let's do some history ....\n\nMy first ever work 'leaving do', took place at the end of a one year industrial placement, when I should have been finishing my University degree. A few of my 'colleagues' & I went to our local Chinese restaurant, I invited some of my university 'friends' who didn't even work with me but hey it was my party right? I probably had something spicy with seafood and drank a lot of coke. We shared the bill equally and well that was that. I have rarely spoken to anyone if at all from that night since then I believe, except my University friends. Oh, I got a card in the office the next day from someone with sufficient emotional intelligence to think of those sorts of things, I was genuinely touched by that, thanks Jo for organising signatures from everyone :)\n\nOn finally leaving the placement to return to uni, I started a tradition of sending a leaving email at the end of my time working at any job. The subject was a quote from my favourite book of all time, it's the title of this article. If you haven't read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', please do, now. If you've only seen the movie, wash your eyes out, forget it and ... read the book, please. If you've only seen the BBC TV Show from the '80s, ok I'll let you off ! If you're a Radiohead fan, but never read the book, never seen the TV Show, you might want to find out about where the name for that song you like, Paranoid Android comes from !!\n\nAnyway, I recently attended a leaving do for a former colleague of mine, it was great, really good fun :) It's here I was asked about what I'm up to now. I got to see old pals, catch up, joke, be silly, be serious, give advice, receive advice, be ignored and also be at the centre of attention. I even almost broke my Karaoke duck (cherry for non cricket fans), so close yet so far, but it was an Oasis song so I'm not that gutted ... In fact, I don't drink but I still had fun. I didn't eat but was surviving on fizzy drinks and good company.\n\nHowever, this night wasn't about me, it was to celebrate four great years. Four humble years where this dude, who had simply been doing his job, but did it with a cheeky smile, detective skills in his laptop and most importantly - stories of wonder, of streets lined with gold! Virtually all of us in attendance wouldn't have even joined this company if it wasn't for the man of the hour. He had been the lead recruiter, he had hired all of us and was now leaving to start his next journey. I wish him all the best :)\n\nWhat this night made me think of is, impression, the impressions we leave on others. Was it really that much of an effort for some people to, 'come out for a drink?' Was it a really hard to walk out of the office, across the street into a nearby pub? Probably not, but they did it and that counts for something. Was it of note that people contributed to a leaving gift? Yeah, I would say so. Was it an accident that the head of Human Resources of both Europe and again the head of HR globally were both in attendance to deliver their cheer, yeah, I would say so.\n\nTo be honest in this modern world of working at home, working at the customers, being on a flight, travelling ... just to have the chance of being in the office on that day in order to make that leaving do - is some effort. In the real world, no one is perfect and everyone may piss someone off some of the time. To put aside all those arguments, or differences of opinion which could have happened over four years in order to raise a glass, yes that ain't easy.\n\nWhat this night also made me think about was, 'what if' ... Like the man of the hour I had left this company. But, for those left behind, it may be natural to start thinking ... Is this the right time to leave to? Why is he leaving? For the man who was leaving he might have been thinking, What have I done, Will it be like this at the next place? What if ... At this point perhaps you may be thinking - Suf, lighten up, I think you need to start drinking!!! :)\n\nPicture -> https://padworny.patternbyetsy.com/\n\nWell, my biggest thought of the night was, Work is work, it's true. Work to live, don't live to work. Don't get (too) caught up in the moment, in that deadline, in that speech, report or whatever. Do feel free to get caught up in the people you do it with, you should be able to work with good people, even if you may not always get on with them. It's by being different we make work interesting, challenging and rewarding, not just the work itself. In my favourite book, a pretty significant event happens virtually at the beginning which pretty much leaves the main character within the book - alone and with no purpose anymore, if he had much purpose at all to begin with. Ironically, because he became alone he got to experience more, learn more, and generally loosen up because he was no longer in his comfort zone, in fact he ended up having the most important purpose ever ....\n\nIn my first leaving do, I was simply following a social ritual, not enjoying the end of one year of work because I didn't really connect because I didn't make an effort to connect. Later in my career I joined a company where not only did I have a leaving do (twice), I had a joining do (kind of). Before joining, my future boss invited me to a team lunch with everyone at the company to meet them informally and get to know them. He knew personal relationships and being able to talk with/to each other was just as important as getting the work done.\n\n.... the impressions we leave on others\n\nThe final thing the leaving do made me think about was, embracing the future. Depending on your perspective, I have left too many jobs and never settled in one place. Conversely, you may think, wow Suf you've really seen a lot. You've been brave by making the choice to grow, move on, develop and re-invent. Naturally, I favour the latter description! It's possibly why I've started enjoying the music of both David Bowie and Jethro Tull, who changed their musical style so much over many years. Indeed, so much has the influence of Tull been, I chose a new theme and tradition for my leaving emails, \"A New Day Yesterday\".\n\nThis article was dedicated to all the leaving do's I've attended and the many I have yet to attend! I hope you enjoyed it :)"
