        "text": "1Dilara86\n\nModificato: Dic 30, 2021, 12:00 pm\n\nDilara’s 2022 reading log\n\nThis is my fifth year in Club Read. I like literary and speculative fiction, especially from countries other than France, the UK and the US. My aim is to read as widely as possible, with a good mix of places and author backgrounds. I won’t write about all the books I read, but I’ll list them all and review some of them when I can (or when you ask for one). I read in French and English, and welcome posts in both languages.\n\nMy previous threads are here:\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nSpring 2019\n\nWinter 2019\n\n2018\n\nThis year, I’ve joined the Food & Lit challenge over at Litsy, where we cook food and read books from a different country every month. This should be interesting!\n\nBecause apparently, I’m a sucker for gimmicks, I’ve also decided to read books by authors who were born or lived/live in the Côtes d’Armor department in France, in Northern Brittany. Why?, will you ask. Because all French departments have a number as well as a name, and Côtes d’Armor’s number is 22 ;-)\n\nHere are some of the books I received at Christmas on the left, and the books I won’t have finished before the end of 2021 on the right.\n\nChristmas 2021\n\nLe livre de la cuisine espagnole (The Food of Spain) by Claudia Roden\n\nLes Recettes du monde dans les films d'animation by Minh-Tri Vo\n\nLa cuisine traditionnelle du Poitou by Vincent Buche\n\nOn va déguster : la France by François-Régis Gaudry and friends\n\nThe Emissary by Yoko Tawada\n\nLe devoir de violence by Yambo Ouologuem\n\nMelmoth furieux by Sabrina Calvo\n\nCarry-overs from 2021\n\nPrincess, Priestess, Poet: The Sumerian Temple Hymns of Enheduanna by Betty De Shong Meador\n\nSorcières by Mona Chollet\n\nFemmes qui courent avec les loups (Women Who Run with the Wolves) by Clarissa Pinkola Estés\n\n2Dilara86\n\nModificato: Nov 8, 2022, 7:29 am\n\nFood and Lit 2022\n\nJanuary – Egypt\n\nI’ll probably read Here Is a Body: A Novel by Basma Abdel Aziz, and I’ll probably cook something from Feast: Food of the Islamic World by Anissa Helou while listening to Musique d’Egypte, streamed from my library’s website.\n\nETA: I read Here is a Body and cooked shorbat 'adass from Feast, with hawawshi from an online recipe.\n\nFebruary - Argentina\n\nFoodwise, I borrowed Argentina : cuisine authentique et recettes de chefs and Empanadas argentins : un festin argentin from the library.\n\nI cooked an Argentinian aubergine and peanut soup from an online recipe and chicken and cilantro empanadas from Empanadas argentins.\n\nPossible reads include: The Adventures of China Irons (although it might be better to read Martin Fierro first!), a new novel by Eugenia Almeida, Laura Alcoba or Selva Almada (I really enjoyed what I've read of them)\n\nETA: I read L’Échange by Eugenia Almeida\n\nMarch - Greece\n\nI borrowed Le vrai goût de la Grèce : une traversée du pays en 50 recettes by Laetitia Cénac, which was disappointing.\n\nI cooked Greek lemon chicken from an online recipe\n\nI read Six Nights on the Acropolis by Georges Séféris\n\nApril - Cuba\n\nI borrowed Le grand livre de la cuisine antillaise by Gladys Mazarin\n\nI cooked ropa vieja and meatless arroz congri and made Cuban coffee - it took several tries to master the technique, but it was worth it!\n\nI read Poésie cubaine du xxe siècle, collected by Claude Couffon\n\nMay - Afghanistan\n\nI made Kabuli Palau (a rice, carrot and lamb dish), Afghani salad, Afghani stewed spinach, garlic and yogurt sauce, and fresh coriander chutney\n\nI read Pamir : Oubliés sur le toit du monde by Matthieu Paley and Kaboul Disco, Tome 1 : Comment je ne me suis pas fait kidnapper en Afghanistan by Nicolas Wild\n\nJune - Colombia\n\nI'm sure I cooked something Colombian, but right now I can't remember what!\n\nI read La Expedición Botánica contada a los niños by Elisa Mújica (unfinished) and Les Dénonciateurs by Juan Gabriel Vásquez\n\nJuly - France narrowed down to the North\n\nI made moules-frites and a potato and cured, smoked herring salad with raw beetroot juice (not on the same day!)\n\nI read Ces dames aux chapeaux verts by Germaine Acremant\n\nAugust - Japan\n\nI made a bento inspired by Bento Boxes: Japanese Meals on the Go by Naomi Kijima\n\nI read Un dîner en bateau by Akira Yoshimura and Nagori by Ryoko Sekiguchi\n\nSeptember - Kenya\n\nI made githeri using a recipe found on the Internet\n\nI read The Perfect Nine: The Epic of Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi, by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o\n\nOctober - Haiti\n\nI made Haitian hot chocolate, riz djon djon and Haitian-style squid using recipes found on the Internet\n\nI read Au pipirite chantant by Jean Métellus\n\nNovember - India\n\nDecember - Germany\n\n3Dilara86\n\nModificato: Nov 8, 2022, 7:31 am\n\n2022 Côtes d’Armor Challenge\n\n(Saint Guirec’s statue at high tide in Perros-Guirec)\n\nThis is 2022, and the Côtes d’Armor département in Northern Brittany is number 22 in the official list of French départements used everywhere, from postcodes to car plates. I thought it would be fun to use this as an excuse to explore authors who were born or lived/live in the Côtes d’Armor department in France.\n\nI’ll be starting with Le sang noir by Louis Guilloux, as recommended by raton-liseur.\n\nList of possibilities\n\nLouis Guilloux – was born and lived in Saint-Brieuc: Le sang noir - Read - a fantastic rec from Raton-Liseur\n\nMongo Beti – lived and taught in Lamballe: anything other than Le pauvre Christ de Bomba, which I’ve already read - Read and enjoyed Remember Ruben\n\nJoseph Conrad – wrote The Rescue in Île-Grande\n\nFrançois-René de Chateaubriand – lived in Plancoët and Dinan\n\nBrigitte Fontaine – lives in Fréhel\n\nErik Orsenna – lives in Lanmodez\n\nFrançois-Marie Luzel, a Breton poet born in Plouaret (if I can find something of his translated into French)\n\nFrançoise Morvan, born in Rostrenen: Les Morgans de l'île d'Ouessant, Contes de Basse Bretagne\n\nChristian Prigent, born in Saint-Brieuc\n\nYann Andréa, born in Guingamp\n\n4Dilara86\n\nModificato: Gen 4, 2022, 8:55 am\n\nWhat I’d like to do this year\n\nWe’ll see how things pan out, but I’d like to:\n\nMake a dent in the unread books on my shelves, including Une histoire populaire de la France, Cité dolente, Le derviche et la mort, The Magician of Lublin, Tâdo, Tâdo, wéé ! ou No more baby: roman and Écrire en pays dominé\n\nRead more from favourite authors and authors of works I’ve really enjoyed, such as Ramuz, Léonora Miano, Dulce María Loynaz (in Spanish if I can!), Raharimanana, Naguib Mahfouz, Eugenia Almeida, Chingiz Aitmatov and Magda Szabó.\n\n5raton-liseur\n\nDic 30, 2021, 12:16 pm\n\nI'm looking forward to following your reading and reviews!\n\nThe Food and Book challenge sounds nice. Where do you travel to in January?\n\nOh, and for the Côtes d'Armor challenge (what a fun idea!), the first author that comes to my mind is Louis Guilloux. Most of his books are set in Saint Brieuc, where he lived. I hope you'll read Le Sang noir. It's one of my all time favourite!\n\n6Dilara86\n\nDic 30, 2021, 12:24 pm\n\n>5 raton-liseur: I'm travelling to Egypt in January!\n\nThank you for the the recommendation. I've reserved D'une guerre l'autre, which contains Le sang noir.\n\n7labfs39\n\nDic 30, 2021, 4:18 pm\n\n>2 Dilara86: In a serendipitous coincidence, your food and lit challenge aligns with the Asian Book Challenge in May (the Stans) and August (Japan). Perhaps you can cross post whatever delicious dish you create on that thread too.\n\n>3 Dilara86: What a fun idea!\n\n8dchaikin\n\nDic 30, 2021, 11:50 pm\n\nWow, that photo. The Sumerian Temple Hymns sound pretty fascinating. I'll be following you again, here and on Litsy.\n\n9Dilara86\n\nDic 31, 2021, 3:28 am\n\n>7 labfs39: I'll drop in for sure! There isn't a country I'm not interested in, but the Stans and Japan have a special place in my heart...\n\n>8 dchaikin: I guess you're talking about the sunset photo?

It's also a slow read that demands a high level of concentration (at least for me), with a lot of scholarly output for a few broken lines of poetry.

She’s ugly, forthright, violent and very contrary. She’s also a lot less stupid than her father, the lord of the castle. Basically, she’s the prototype for Bean from Disenchantment, for those who’ve seen this Netflix animated series, and proof that the sexual revolution was well under way in the cultural sphere by the end of the sixties. There are versions of Cellulite in Italian (Cellulite), Dutch (Sonetteke), Danish (Sylfia), Spanish (Celulitis), German (Zellulitis), Swedish (Cellulisa) and Finnish (Selluliit) (I like to look at the variety of names chosen). I find it both extraordinary and sad that, as far as I know, none of those stories have been translated into English.\n\nA friend lent me this book, which is an omnibus of all the Cellulite stories, plus a number of shorter graphic works, including for some reasons a funny work about cement… They were written for adults (definitely not for children!) in the late sixties and seventies, and you can almost taste that era reading them, but they haven’t aged badly. They remain relateable and funny.\n\n15raton-liseur\n\nGen 2, 2022, 10:30 am\n\n>14 Dilara86: I am not well versed in Claire Bretécher's work, but I love the name of this character!\n\n16Linda92007\n\nGen 2, 2022, 12:08 pm\n\nI am jealous of you, as I wish I could read bilingually, and especially in French.

I've made ful medames in the past, and it was very nice. I was thinking of making two recipes from Feast: Food of the Islamic World: shorbat 'adass (Egyptian split lentil soup - note to self: page 292) and mulukhihah (note to self: p 408) if I can find some at the shops. But if a particular dish is mentioned in the novel, I'll probably go for that instead, unless it's something I really don't want to eat.\n\n27Dilara86\n\nGen 5, 2022, 9:22 am\n\nSorcières : la puissance invaincue des femmes (Witches : women’s undefeated power) by Mona Chollet\n\nWriter’s gender: female\n\nWriter’s nationality: Switzerland\n\nOriginal language: French\n\nTranslated into: N/A\n\nLocation: the Western world, especially the US, France and Switzerland\n\nFirst published in 2019\n\nA few lines from page 100\n\nAvec sept milliards et demi d’êtres humains, tout danger d’extinction de l’espèce paraît écarté – ou du moins tout danger d’extinction faute de naissances.

It's been in such high demand, I had to wait almost 4 months for a library copy, and although it is very readable, it doesn't say anything new. She uses personal anecdotes, pop culture references (Game of Thrones), and literary references (Maria Gripe’s The Glassblower's Children, Baudelaire, La femme et le docteur Dreuf by Mare Kandre) to illustrate her points, taken from various feminist writers – mostly American (Mary Daly…) In many ways, it reads like good long-form journalism.\n\n28kidzdoc\n\nGen 5, 2022, 10:39 am\n\n>26 Dilara86: I would love to hear more about those recipes!

In fact, I think I only ate it a handful of times as a child, and just once as an adult, in a gastronomic restaurant where you don't choose from a menu - you eat what the chef gives you. Sometimes, you can get pigeon pastilla in Moroccan restaurants, but I was never tempted. During the second world war, my grandfather's family were only able to eat what they or their neighbours produced, and for meat, that meant poultry and other small animals. After the war, my grandfather swore he would never have pigeon or rabbit again if he could help it!\n\n33lilisin\n\nGen 7, 2022, 3:14 am\n\nTrying to catch up on threads during a rare pause of free time at work.

I have noted Kentucky Fried Chicken (not having that!), kunafa, hamburgers (could be hawawshi)\n\n36Dilara86\n\nGen 9, 2022, 12:59 pm\n\nReposted from La Cucina\n\nToday, I tried my hand at Egyptian food. I made shorbat 'adass (Egyptian split lentil soup), using the recipe found in Feast: Food of the Islamic World, slightly modified. The ingredients list called for 500g of raw red lentils for just 1l of water - that had to be a typo. I checked other recipes online: one cup seems standard. I added garlic (also found in other recipes) and replaced the tomatoes with tomato purée.\n\nHere is the pot with the raw ingredients:\n\nShorbat 'adass\n\nIngredients\n\n1 onion, quartered\n\n1 onion, chopped\n\n2 cloves garlic\n\n1tsp ground cumin\n\n4 tbsp olive oil\n\n1 tbsp tomato purée\n\n1 courgette (medium in the recipe – I suspect mine would have counted as big), chopped\n\n1 carrot (medium in the recipe – I suspect mine would have counted as big), chopped\n\n1 cup red lentils\n\n1.5 l water\n\nSalt to taste\n\nPut the quartered onion, garlic, courgette, carrot, tomato purée, lentils and water in a big pot and bring to the boil. Add 2 tbsp of olive oil and the ground cumin. Simmer for 20 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, fry the chopped onion in 2 tbsp of olive oil until it is golden brown. Add to the soup. Simmer for another 10 minutes.\n\nBlend using a handblender and salt to taste.\n\nEasy and reasonably fuss-free! I’ll make it again.\n\nThe main course was hawawshi – spicy ground meat baked in pitas (using this recipe). It was nice, but we were expecting an explosion of flavours, and it fell short of that. It’s probably worth tweaking until it’s just right… I’m also thinking that I’d be just as happy with a vegetarian version. I served it with a mixed salad of tomato, cucumber, shallot, coriander leaves, lettuce and radishes with lemon juice and sumac.\n\nThe whole meal (the hawawshis were uncooked at that time):\n\nFor dessert, I was going to make om ali, then realised I’d forgotten to buy puff pastry. So we had oranges instead!\n\nIt was a decent Sunday lunch. I realised too late that I had no idea how Egyptians organise their meals: how they build their menu, in what order and in which combination they serve their dishes, etc. So I went for the standard French way of doing things: soup as a first course, meat and vegetable as a main course, fruit for dessert. Next time, I’ll do more research!\n\n37baswood\n\nGen 10, 2022, 6:18 pm\n\n>36 Dilara86: Beautiful pics. looks scrumptious.\n\n39Dilara86\n\nModificato: Gen 12, 2022, 5:31 am\n\nPrincess, Priestess, Poet: The Sumerian Temple Hymns of Enheduanna by Betty De Shong Meador, about the poetry of Enheduanna\n\nWriter’s gender: female\n\nWriter’s nationality: USA\n\nOriginal language: English and Sumerian\n\nTranslated into: N/A and English\n\nLocation: Mesopotamia (Sumer)\n\nFirst published in 2009\n\nA few lines from page 100\n\nEach of the seven deities of this group of Temple Hymns has spent mythological time in the netherworld, the land of the dead. Utu, the sun god (TH 13) enters the underworld through the western gate each evening and rises from this sleep every morning to ascend into the world above. Ninazu (TH 14) and his son Ningishzida (TH 15) have dual traditions. They are among the young dying fertility gods who disappear into the underworlds at the time of the barley harvest, but they also ascend with the new growth in the spring.\n\nThis is an academic tome on the poetry of Enheduanna, the first named author in history. She was the daughter of Sargon, the king who created the Akkadian empire. He sent her south, to Ur, to serve as the first high priestess (all her predecessors were male) in the temple of the moon god Nanna, a role that was both religious and political. All the poems and poetry fragments attributed to her (some were no her creations, some she probably adaptated from earlier anonymous works) are presented here, with ample historical and religious commentary. It took me 6 weeks to read it cover to cover, both because I was unfamiliar with the subject matter and because the text was on the dense side. Although I am certain I would have gotten more out of it and I would have memorised more information if I had been better versed in Sumerian history, I am still glad I persevered to the end. I learned a lot. I’d now like to find Enheduanna’s poetry, adapted for pure poetic enjoyment rather than academic research…\n\n40wandering_star\n\nGen 12, 2022, 5:42 am\n\nWhat a great idea Food and Lit is!\n\n41dchaikin\n\nGen 13, 2022, 1:22 am\n\n>39 Dilara86: it just sounds terrific.\n\nI have no idea how this relates to Enheduanna specifically (other than she may have been named for Inanna) but if you want to pursue the same mythology further in a fun way - see this translation by Diane Wolkstein: Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth : Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer\n\n42Dilara86\n\nGen 13, 2022, 2:46 am\n\n>40 wandering_star: I've only just joined the challenge - I think it's been going on for at least a year - and it's great fun!

Or maybe you’ll end up in the same place as the boys who’ve disappeared, and then you’ll find out where they’ve all gone.”\n\nSaad laughed as he answered me, but I was very serious, tense too. I felt alienated whenever the general visited. I thought I might like him like the others if I could understand what he was saying.\n\n“What did the general mean by governing and authority, by nation and order?” I asked, ignoring Saad’s cheerfulness and flippancy. “I understood from what he said that they’re different names for the same thing. Do they all mean our country?”\n\n“What’s all that to you? Are you going to stand for election and put up posters in the streets?”\n\n“Enough of all that then, but tell me, what were the plans he mentioned?”\n\n“Well, you’ve got the rehabilitation program that we’re in, and Dr. Abdel-Samie’s project too. One of them rehabilitates us, and the other exterminates us and buries us.”\n\nIn high spirits, Saad kept joking and shrieking with laughter, while I kept asking questions, but without receiving a single satisfactory answer. My need for Youssef hadn’t diminished; I hadn’t outgrown my dependence on him. He would have explained complicated things to me in simple terms, without annoying me or making fun of me.\n\nAnother question occurred to me and I couldn’t resist asking it: “Are you afraid of the general, Saad?”\n\n“I’m afraid of him and not afraid of him at the same time. That’s the truth.” Saad paused for a moment and his smile was replaced by a thoughtful frown. “I am afraid, Rabie,” he finally replied. “But being afraid is all we do here. There’s something about him that repels me, so I don’t mind making fun of him either. I get lost in what he says whenever he meets us, but I can’t relate to him, no matter what he says. Like me, you may have noticed that what the heads say is easy to understand. They shout and give orders. They either forgive you or punish you, and you don’t have to think too much. You don’t have to think at all.\n\nThis novel tells us about the protests and unrest in an unnamed country whose democratically-elected president was ousted by The General. Protesters (they seem to run the gamut from Islamic hardliners to pro-democracy militants) have set up a camp called The Space, which is almost a utopia from their point of view, but Sodom and Gomorra in the eyes of the new rulers (The System). One of its inhabitants is Aida, a teacher, wife and mother, whose story is told in the third person. In parallel, we learn about Rabie, a street child picked up by the System, along with all the orphans and street children they can get their hands on, for rehabilitation – which consists of turning them into killing machines (“Bodies”) to be used to do the System’s dirty work. The action takes place over the month of Ramadan and ends badly. The parallels with the political situation in Egypt, and specifically with the coup d'état by General Al Sisi and the Rabaa massacre, are obvious. I really wanted to like this book. It ticked so many boxes for me: female writer, female protagonist, foreign politics, dystopic writing. But between the unnatural, plodding translation, the lack of psychological depth, and the one-dimensional, linear style that was mostly concerned with describing actions, there wasn't much to hold my attention. Others might enjoy it more than I did, especially if they're interested in the subject matter.\n\n50Dilara86\n\nGen 20, 2022, 11:40 am\n\nLes plus beaux poèmes de la langue française by various authors\n\nWriter’s gender: mostly male, but some female poets were included\n\nWriter’s nationality: mostly French, with a couple of Belgian and Swiss authors\n\nOriginal language: French\n\nTranslated into: N/A\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nFirst published in 1996\n\nPage 100\n\nThis anthology of French poems is a comfort read for me.

It looks like a picture book for children, but some of the poems will definitely go over their heads.

Having said that, P.O.L published Duras and Perec, so they're not a million miles from each other... So far, it's an easy read. It's written in an informal, \"spoken\", style (\"ne\"s are typically dropped from negative constructions), in the present tense and in the first person singular. We follow the narrator's stream of consciousness, but he thinks in normal sentences with standard punctuation, which helps!\n\n57raton-liseur\n\nGen 24, 2022, 7:41 am\n\n>56 Dilara86: You're right! I got misled by the colours! But I'm not very P.O.L. neither.\n\nHappy you're enjoying it, and I'll see if I get tempted when I'll read your review!\n\n58Dilara86\n\nGen 26, 2022, 9:57 am\n\nL'enfant cachée (Hidden: A Child's Story of the Holocaust) written by Loïc Dauvillier, illustrated by Marc Lizano\n\nWriters’ gender: Male\n\nWriter’s nationality: France\n\nOriginal language: French\n\nTranslated into: N/A\n\nLocation: Vichy France\n\nFirst published in 2012\n\nFor once, I am reading a book that’s available in English! I discovered it thanks to Raton-Liseur’s recent review of it. It is also mentioned by avatiakh in the Graphic Novel thread in the Holocaust group. I don’t have anything original to say about this children’s graphic novel: both of them wrote about it quite eloquently.\n\nDounia tells her granddaughter about what she and her family went through as Jews under Vichy, when France was occupied by nazi Germany and the local far-right French government (settled in Vichy, a small spa town in central France) collaborated to further the nazi agenda. Her parents were sent to the camps, while she was picked up by the neighbours who looked after her and hid her until the end of the war.\n\nThis graphic novel aimed at youngish children is a very good introduction to the history of Vichy, and to what it entailed for the people who lived through it. I thought it was very well pitched, intellectually and psychologically, for children. But it is affecting - there is no way it cannot be given the subject matter - and I would never leave it for children to discover on their own: there should be an adult ready to answer their questions and reassure them. Especially now that Vichy and Pétain are back in the news, with a Jewish far-right presidential candidate who claimed that Vichy protected Jews (then changed tack and said that they protected all French Jews and that no French Jew died in the Holocaust – this is obviously wrong).\n\n59raton-liseur\n\nGen 26, 2022, 2:43 pm\n\n>58 Dilara86: I'm happy to see you liked it. It's really a good book, but as you said, it's important to be ready to answer any question a child might have.\n\nI would easily recommand this book to any parent who is willing to discuss the matter with his/her child/children.\n\nAnd maybe the presidential candidate you mention should read it as well...\n\n60Dilara86\n\nGen 27, 2022, 8:55 am\n\n>59 raton-liseur: And maybe the presidential candidate you mention should read it as well...\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure anything would change his mind...

I'm looking forward to your review!\n\n65Dilara86\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 11:19 am\n\nLe sang noir by Louis Guilloux\n\nWriter’s gender: Male\n\nWriter’s nationality: France\n\nOriginal language: French\n\nTranslated into: N/A\n\nLocation: Saint-Brieuc in Côtes-d’Armor, Brittany (France)\n\nFirst published in 1935\n\nI was looking for books set in Côte-d’Armor or written by local authors and Raton-liseur recommended Sang noir.\n\nIt takes place on a single day in 1917 (so during the First World War), in Saint-Brieuc, a small town in Brittany, and describes the comings and goings of various town people, centering around Cripure, a frustrated and depressed philosophy teacher at the local high school (at a time when secondary schooling was for a small élite). The pessimism and the free indirect speech give a flaubertian flavour to the book, but – and I might be completely wrong because I read it decades ago – the more I read, the more I thought of Ulysses, especially with the one-day setting and the way Cripure goes in and out of various establishments: post-office, bank, school... I loved Guilloux’s eye for speech. Every character has their idiolect, from a very earthy vernacular* to the most affected, rarefied French. I haven’t had to get the dictionary out so often in a very long time!\n\nThis novel was a pleasure to read. I might have to clarify this: the story itself is terribly depressing, but the writing is so precise, inventive, and formally interesting, it “sparked joy” in me. I don’t understand why Guilloux, who inspired André Malrauxand Albert Camus (they were friends and both wrote introductions for his novels), isn’t better known today.\n\n* such as this oh so elegant saying: “t’as une mine de chou chié” (you look like a shat-out cabbage)\n\n66labfs39\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 11:42 am\n\n>65 Dilara86: Your review makes the book sound delightful. Some days I feel like a shat-out cabbage!\n\n67raton-liseur\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 11:54 am\n\n>65 Dilara86: Le Sang noir might be my prefered book ever. I loved it so much that I'd like to read it again but fear to do so.\n\nI guess he is not that famous because all his books (or the majority) take place in Saint Brieuc (not the most glamorous set up...). And Le Sang noir is quite unique in his bibliography. He has a lot of books about poor people living an ordinary life, including some inspired by his own childhood (again, not very glamorous).\n\nI have one or two unread books from him on my shelves, I should open one one of these days...\n\nI'm glad you liked the book so much!\n\n68dchaikin\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 2:22 pm\n\n>65 Dilara86: great review. I like your clarification, and also was entertained by your “earthy vernacular” example\n\n>66 labfs39: yeah, me too.\n\n69baswood\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 5:25 pm\n\n>65 Dilara86: another author to add to the list when I am browsing in those second hand book markets.\n\n70LolaWalser\n\nFeb 5, 2022, 6:03 pm\n\nThis reminds me I've had a Guilloux omnibus on hold for over eight months now, and yet the darn person who's holding it WAY over their deadline... oops, just realised there's a sombre alternative explanation for their inexplicable rudeness.

I'm amazed at the number of library patrons who hand in their books weeks, or even months, late...\n\nIs your Guilloux omnibus D'une guerre l'autre? That's the book I borrowed from the library. Returning it having just read the introduction, the chronology and one of the novels was hard! But my hold for Rabalaïre (1036 pages!) had come through and I knew there was no way I could read both of them cover to cover.\n\nWhat happened with the molokhia, did you cook it?\n\nNo I didn't. I was so confident I'd find frozen molokhia at the local Turkish/exotic shop, but it was all gone! Having said that, I noticed the first fresh bunches of the year at the market this morning. I'll get round to trying this recipe eventually...\n\nI forgot to add to my post that Le sang noir is available in English under the title Blood Dark, thanks to The New York Review of Books. They're doing a great job of finding lesser-known non-English works to translate and publish. Speaking of which, I am wondering how the translator managed all those different voices in the English version.\n\n72LolaWalser\n\nFeb 6, 2022, 12:30 pm\n\nD'une guerre l'autre\n\nYep, that's it. Just one copy in the system. I'm not fond of reading English translations of the French, especially when the language is as delightfully colourful as you say.\n\nWe get frozen molokhia here but it was a bit slimier than when using dry (frozen goes straight into the dish, dry gets to be washed and rehydrated). I've never used fresh...\n\n73Dilara86\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 9:50 am\n\nLa jeune femme et la mer by Catherine Meurisse\n\nWriter’s gender: Female\n\nWriter’s nationality: France\n\nOriginal language: French\n\nTranslated into: N/A\n\nLocation: Villa Kujoyama, Kyoto (Japan)\n\nFirst published in 2021\n\nGraphic artist Catherine Meurisse was offered an artist’s residency in Villa Kujoyama. She wanted to explore Japanese nature and study Japanese landscape art. This is the resulting book. As often with Meurisse, the landscapes she paints in her panels are beautifully detailed. I wasn’t taken with the story, and I found her tanuki familiar annoying. YMMV obviously.\n\n74labfs39\n\nFeb 7, 2022, 10:07 am\n\n>73 Dilara86: The cover is arresting.

As it’s out of print and not particularly good, I’m not sure reviewing this book serves much of a purpose, but there we are…\n\n*Actually, one of the reasons might be the close association between Canada and this bit of France (many North-Americans of French origin hail from Western France). Also, some of the deported Acadians settled back in a couple of villages in the area.\n\nA few lines from page 100 with terrible, wooden dialogue\n\n- Où comptes-tu aller ?\n\n- - Jusqu’en Géorgie, d’abord ; ensuite, en Louisiane… en souhaitant y retrouver ma mère, ma sœur et ma cousine.\n\n- - Tu as raison, vous serez indésirables dans toutes les colonies anglaises ; là-bas, c’est différent ; j’ai toujours pensé que ce pays pouvait être une nouvelle Acadie.\n\nFrançois se souvient des dernières paroles de son père, et le sang afflua à ses joues.\n\n- Tu as gardé confiance, petit, je le vois. Alors la vie te réservera de bonnes surprises. C’est quand on ne croit plus à rien qu’il n’arrive plus rien.\n\nL’homme semblait parler pour lui-même :\n\n- Allons, nous ferons un bout de chemin ensemble jusqu’à Brevara, si tu veux ; tu te débrouilleras bien tout seul ensuite pour passer en Géorgie.\n\n- Je me débrouillerai, soyez-en sûr !\n\nFrançois eut une pensée pour les Indiens qui l’avaient accueilli et hébergé pendant des semaines, pour le capitaine Murray et tous ceux que la Providence avait mis sur sa route.\n\nThis novel for older children was written by Huguette Pérol, a French author and globe-trotting diplomat’s wife who specialised in children’s books set in “exotic” locations, some of which were published by Bibliothèque de l'amitié, a (defunct) publisher that was a window to other cultures to many children and teenagers in the sixties and seventies, including my mother. I still have her copies of Dag découvre l'Afrique by Inger Austveg, Rüdi et le chamois by Robert Recher, Aventures à Bali by Udiyana Pandji Tisna and La chance de Sally by Patricia Lynch.\n\nThe novel is set in 1755, at the time of the Great Upheaval, after Acadia (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Maine) had passed from French to British hands, and French Acadians were being forcibly removed from the land and sent to mainland France or other French territories such as Louisiana. Many died in the process; some joined bands to fight British soldiers. François was a twelve-year-old French Acadian boy from Piziquid/Pisiguit, in what is now Nova Scotia. He managed to escape, and went on a long trip into Québec, back to Nova Scotia, down to Richmond, Charlotteville, Atlanta, etc. then down the Mississippi river to Louisiana, to find other Acadian rebels and his missing family. The novel is basically a padded-out travel itinerary with guest features from historical figures of the time, such as Boishébert. There isn’t much of a plot, there are hardly any descriptions and the writing is very flat. François seems to be able to speak all sorts of languages: French obviously, but also English (he’s advised to say he’s from Boston if he’s questioned on his accent), Mi’kmaq, and other random native American languages when he needs food and shelter. There are some baddies, but François finds help whenever he needs it along the way, from everyone, whether they’re French settlers, rebels, Micmac and other “Indians” (as they are called in the book), American farmers – there are even nice British soldiers ;-) This at least is refreshing - sugar-coated, but refreshing. And that’s how you know it was published by the Bibliothèque de l’amitié (literally: Frendship library). The book is interesting as a curio, but no more.\n\n78Dilara86\n\nModificato: Mar 1, 2022, 12:53 pm\n\nFebruary reads\n\nRabalaïre by Alain Guiraudie\n\nLes goûts extraordinaires de monsieur Bear by Virginie Aracil and many other books for very young children\n\nArgentina : cuisine authentique et recettes de chefs by Marcelo Joulia\n\nEmpanadas argentins : un festin argentin by Gaston Stivelmaher\n\nOublie mon nom by Zerocalcare\n\nDieu, le temps, les hommes et les anges by Olga Tokarczuk\n\nNe visitez pas l'Exposition coloniale tract de mai 1931 by André Breton and others - mostly surrealists\n\nL'École des femmes by Molière\n\nHigh Tide by Inga Abele\n\nSeason: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food by Nik Sharma\n\nFemmes qui courent avec les loups by Clarissa Pinkola Estés (ongoing - may carry over to March)\n\nFilles des oiseaux - N'oubliez jamais que le Seigneur vous regarde ! by Florence Cestac\n\nLa propriété by Rutu Modan\n\nL’Échange by Eugenia Almeida\n\nBlack Sea: Dispatches and Recipes, Through Darkness and Light by Caroline Eden\n\nOriginal languages of the books I've read this month:\n\nFrench: 6\n\nEnglish: 3\n\nEnglish and French: 1\n\nItalian: 1\n\nPolish: 1\n\nLatvian: 1\n\nHebrew: 1\n\nSpanish: 1\n\nThat's 60% English and French\n\n21st-century books: 11\n\n20th-century books: 3\n\n19th-century books:\n\n18th-century books:\n\n17th-century books: 1\n\n16th-century books:\n\nMedieval books:\n\nAncient books:\n\nThat's 93% 21st- and 20th-century\n\nNumber of female authors this month: 8\n\nNumber of male authors this month: 7\n\nMixed male/female collaborations this month: 0\n\n79raton-liseur\n\nFeb 20, 2022, 6:45 am\n\n>78 Dilara86: Quite a lot of reading happening here!\n\nI hope you'll have time to review them, even shortly.

Nana. And of course, she also published many books, and in particular, autobiographical graphic works such as The Latelife Crisis and Filles des oiseaux - N'oubliez jamais que le Seigneur vous regarde !, about her years at a convent boarding school in the sixties in Honfleur, where she (an uneducated farmer’s daughter) and her best friend (a Parisian upper-class girl) misbehaved and played trick on the nuns.

Sometimes we’d take other friends with us. And that one time on the way to the bar, a rabbit jumped out of the wheat field right in front of the car. I begged Andrejs to brake for it, but he went after it like a maniac until he ran it down. He even pulled over to throw the carcass into the trunk, so I’d stew it for breakfast. But the rabbit hadn’t been run over, just knocked back into the wheat field—its screams ripped through the quiet of the night. Andrejs was drunk, he couldn’t find it. I got out of the car and started walking home, but he blocked my way and forced me back into the car. And then—at the bar! Whether it was revenge or a breakdown, I don’t know. More likely it was some third thing. That beautiful song “Black Velvet” was playing, you know the one. And I went to dance with Aksels. A slow dance. The first time ever with him. I didn’t care anymore. He didn’t either. We only saw each other in this crazy, fucked-up world. It really was more of a breakdown. And toward the end he kissed me. For the first time. But I pulled away, recovered, and then saw—guess what? Andrejs’s eyes. He was standing by the wall and watching us carefully.\n\nI chose this book from the list of books Rebecca hoped to read soon, in the Tribute to Rebeccanyc thread.\n\nThis novel tells the story of Ieva, a young Latvian woman with a very rocky start to life. There is a love triangle, violence, drinks, drugs and rock’n’roll (or rather punk rock). It’s all very adolescent and try-hard, despite its adult subject matter. The translation is… fine, I suppose. It has a distinctive style (as seen in the quote above), which I personally found annoying. I am disappointed because had it been written differently, I would probably have loved it: I liked the subject matter and the book’s non-chronological construction, where other people’s stories inform the main character’s.\n\n86Dilara86\n\nFeb 23, 2022, 10:55 am\n\n>84 raton-liseur: Ah.

Since I have almost no energy left after a couple of difficult reads that used up all my willpower, I chose a \"safe\" book.\n\nFood\n\nI borrowed two Argentina cookbooks from the library:\n\n- Argentina : cuisine authentique et recettes de chefs was a nice coffee-table book with large, pretty pictures (warning: there are lots of close-ups of meat) and fairly involved \"cheffy\" recipes - I did not cook anything from it.\n\n- Empanadas argentins : un festin argentin was written by a chef who owns an Argentinian restaurant chain in Paris specialising in empanadas and icecreams. On different days, I made chimichurri sauce, and chicken and cilantro empanadas from this book. I am not sold on using chimichurri on meat, but it's great as a salad dressing!\n\nI also made an aubergine and peanut soup using a recipe I found online: https://www.cuisineactuelle.fr/recettes/soupe-epicee-d-aubergines-aux-cacahuetes... This is a North-Eastern Argentinian recipe that's quite similar to a West-African mafé.

If you think it might have been you, thank you and please chime in!\n\nI don’t need to introduce this book: there are plenty of useful reviews on this site already. I wasn’t bowled over, but I definitely enjoyed this graphic novel. I particularly liked the fact that emotions were perfectly readable on characters’ faces, but they weren’t overdone, which is a pet peeve of mine on realistically-drawn works. Speaking of which, there were too many emotional ups and downs and plot turnarounds for me. To be fair, it wouldn’t have been the same book without them – they were central to the plot – it’s just that my brain wanted something cosy at this point. I’m certainly not going to award this book fewer stars because of this.

In a country where corruption is tentacular, this rabbit hole will turn out to be very dangerous for everyone involved, especially since someone’s idea of leading a quiet life is to kill people like pawns on a chessboard. To be clear, this is not a plot-driven novel: the author explores the mind of a very twisted individual, and describes the way corruption works its way into people and systems.\n\nI chose this book for Litsy’s Agentina Food and Lit challenge because I’d already read – and loved – L’autobus and La pièce du fond by this author. In the end, I liked this one a tad less – not because it was any less good – but because it was closer to a standard crime novel, which not a genre I am fond of. The translation is flawless, and the writing is immersive, and psychologically chilling.\n\n96Dilara86\n\nModificato: Mar 2, 2022, 11:52 am\n\nThe Emissary by Yōko Tawada, translated by Margaret Mitsutani\n\nWriter’s gender: Female\n\nWriter’s nationality: Japanese\n\nOriginal language: Japanese\n\nTranslated into: English\n\nLocation: Japan\n\nFirst published in 2014 in Japanese, 2018 in English\n\nA few lines from page 100\n\nI’ll just turn myself back into an octopus. No need to be afraid of the water, I’ll get through water day as an octopus, and wait for Thursday – tree day. On tree day maybe the cherry tree in the schoolyard will fall on top of me and crush me.\n\nA few lines from page 11, which I enjoyed very much\n\nIt was Shikoku-style German bread, charred the color of midnight and heavy as granite; The crust was hard and dry, the inside soft and moist. This faintly sour black bread was called “Aachen”, written with Chinese characters that meant “Pseudo Opium”. The baker had named each variety of bread he baked after a German city, which he wrote in Chinese characters with roughly the same pronunciation, so that Hanover meant “Blade’s Aunt”, Bremen “Wobbly Noodles”, and Rothenberg “Outdoor Hot Springs Haven”.\n\nThree years after everybody else (or so it seems), I have at last read The Emissary! It won the National Book Award for Translated Literature in 2018, and deservedly so, I think! I’ve copied a couple of quotes to give an idea of the translator’s work.\n\nThis short dystopic novel is set in a polluted, self-isolating Japan, where old people live forever, and children are sickly and fragile. We share the life of Yoshiro, a healthy, active centenarian looking after his great grandson Mumei. I loved their relationship and Yoshiro’s musings. It’s all rather contemplative (with shades of Shikasta). I found the ending a bit abrupt and opaque, and disappointing.\n\n97Dilara86\n\nMar 4, 2022, 3:01 am\n\nMarch Food and Lit\n\nI will be visiting Greece (virtually) this month.

The version I read – introduced and analysed by Bénédicte Louvat-Molozay was published in 2011.\n\nMolière was born 400 years ago this year. To celebrate his quadricentenary (is that a word in English?), 2022 has been declared The Year of Molière, with plays, documentaries, exhibitions and events (https://moliere2022.org/ and https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/en/events/moliere-2022#). To get in on the fun, my book club chose L’École des femmes as our February read. That was a welcome (to me!) change from the young adult fare we seem to end up with most months.\n\nThe play is a comedy inspired by a short story written by Maria de Zayas Sotomayor (a female author I am definitely going to explore) in her Exemplary Tales of Love and Tales of Disillusion, translated/rewritten by Scarron, and by The Merry Nights of Straparola by Giovanni Francesco Straparola. It tells the story of Arnolphe, an old man so obsessed with the risk of being cuckolded he selects a young girl for himself, has her educated in a convent and then groomed to his liking, shut up away from the world. By ensuring her complete innocence and unworldliness, he thinks that she will make a perfect wife for him, and will be unable to cheat on him. Unfortunately, Agnes is so innocent she takes everything she is told at face value, and walks straight into a love affair without ever understanding what is happening. And of course, she refuses to marry Arnolphe. The comedy resides in part in Arnolphe’s character: his paranoia (and the fact that it works against him), his obliviousness to what is going on, and the ridiculousness of his being in love with young, pretty Agnès. It is also quite bawdy, something that was criticised in some quarters at the time. The controversy was whipped up and instrumentalised by Molière himself for publicity (it worked!), famously in his one-act play Critique de l’École des femmes where he points out all the double-entendres we might have missed otherwise about the word “it”, cats, horns... All sorts of things that incidently, work equally well in English and in French! And because it is a comedy, all’s well that ends well: the pretty young woman gets the handsome young man of her dreams and vice-versa!\n\nI hadn’t read Molière since my schooldays, and it’s the first time I’ve read him for fun. I am not terribly fond of his humour, but I enjoyed immersing myself in 17th-century French alexandrines, and it was a pleasant read, with enough historical and linguistic interest to keep me happy.\n\n100labfs39\n\nMar 4, 2022, 10:50 am\n\n>99 Dilara86: Wonderful review!

I chose a big anthology of XXth-century poems by Cuban authors. I thought I'd read them in Spanish, with the occasional glance at the French translation, which is what I did with the Dulce María Loynaz collection I read last year. That proved more difficult this time, because the translation was a lot less literal, and therefore less useful as a crutch. In the end, I just read the French text, which means I lost an opportunity to improve my Spanish. On the flip side, the translations flowed well and were easy to get into.\n\nThe poetry of Nivaria Tejera in particular spoke to me. I also want to read more by Nancy Morejón - and Dulce María Loynaz, of course. I realise that although only a handful of female poets were included, they are the ones that I remember.\n\nOn the food side, I cooked rope vieja, a slow-cooked beef and tomato dish, with arroz congri (rice and red beans, typically with pork but I omitted it). Very nice, but not very original (not that they needed to be).\n\nWe also made Cuban coffee, which is more difficult to get right than it looks, and is far too addictive - probably because of all the sugar in it!\n\n105labfs39\n\nMag 4, 2022, 8:25 am\n\nFood and Lit is a great combo.

Each section starts with a few pages about the asylum-seeker's life history, then there is a double page on their country, with background information and trivia, then a few pages about the country's food and food culture, and a list of basic ingredients, with explanations. There are a dozen recipes for each country, each with a full-page photo. I was quite excited about this approach. Now that I've read the whole book closely, rather than just flipped through it, I'm slightly disappointed. The information isn't always accurate or well-chosen (IMHO), and some of the instructions are unclear or incomplete. Those are quibbles...\n\n108Dilara86\n\nModificato: Mag 26, 2022, 8:08 am\n\nRabalaïre by Alain Guiraudie\n\nWriter’s gender: Male\n\nWriter’s nationality: France\n\nOriginal language: French with a smattering of Occitan\n\nTranslated into: N/A (when there are sentences in Occitan, their meaning is either obvious, or they are explained or translated by one of the protagonists as part of the dialogue)\n\nLocation: Central South-Western France – basically the whole of the Massif Central, from to the Cévennes, with most of the action taking place in Aveyron\n\nFirst published in 2021\n\nI discovered Rabalaïre on my library’s list of new acquisitions for the 2021 rentrée littéraire. I saw it was set in Aveyron, a département in the South-Western part of the Massif Central, that holds a special place in my heart, and immediately requested it without researching it first. In a way, I’m glad I did: if I had realised the type of book it was and how long it was, I probably would have passed.\n\nThis is a difficult book to talk about. It’s a 1036-page doorstop about a forty-something gay man who’s just lost his job in a cooperative company, and whose life now revolves around cycling all over the Massif Central in search of company, friendship, sex and God knows what. Despite its length, it’s a quick read (at least for native speakers) because Guiraudie writes the way people speak: words and sentences just flow seamlessly. You can almost hear the characters’ South-Western accent and mannerisms, not to mention the one character who only speaks Occitan! For example, the text is peppered with “j’y dis” instead of the more correct “je lui dis”. In fact, there is an – arguably political – choice to forgo a literary, formal style, and write realistic spoken French, and describe real bodies, everyday lives, everyday struggles. This is a book about the way capitalism wrecks lives.\n\nThere are sex acts on almost all pages, written in a very uncompromising, unromantic way, with purple, weepy, diseased-looking penises (or one in particular but described multiple times). The main character will have sex with anyone as long as they are middle-aged or older. Incidentally, I am not convinced by the heterosexual encounters. There is almost as much violence as sex. Also cycling, difficulties communicating with other people, the flouting of societal norms, and money problems. And a main character who just cannot make up his mind about anything, nor keep his hands, eyes or body to himself... That’s basically a list of things that make me anxious! Despite its very adult themes, I felt like I was 3 again, hiding behind my hands while being read Goldilocks. Every time Jacques lied, “borrowed” something, or sneaked into someone’s house, my whole body tensed up. I swear it took a year off my life expectancy.\n\nReading Rabalaïre was an extremely uncomfortable experience for me, but then I almost certainly wasn’t the intended readership! I’m pretty sure that despite its deceptively simple writing style, it’s actually a very literary novel, but one whose references went over my head. I have a hunch, based on the similarities between this novel and Querelle (the Kévin Lambert novel) that it’s in dialogue with Jean Genet’s Querelle de Brest, but after 1036 pages of drugs, sex and violence, I need a long break before checking that. This book was very much out of my comfort zone, but I did it! I read it to the end and I feel ridiculously proud of myself, both because it’s different from anything I’ve read so far and it’s clearly set to become a classic- or at the very least a cult book-, and because finishing it took a lot of willpower. I want to simultaneously recommend it and warn people off it!\n\n109rocketjk\n\nMag 26, 2022, 10:08 am\n\n>108 Dilara86: Thanks for that very interesting review. I don't think it's a good I'll take on, but I've learned never to say never. Is this book taking place in the present day? Are there really still people in France who speak Occitan in day to day speech? That comes as a surprise to me, then so do a lot of things!\n\n110Dilara86\n\nModificato: Mag 26, 2022, 11:08 am\n\n>109 rocketjk: Yes, it takes place in the present day, with plenty of current political commentary. There are definitely people who speak Occitan in day to day dealings (arguably, it's a political act), but they would be able to code-switch as necessary - there are no monolingual Occitan speakers left.\n\nETA: If you ever spend time in Aveyron, don't miss market day in Villefranche-de-Rouergue: you're bound to hear Occitan there!\n\n111Dilara86\n\nMag 26, 2022, 11:07 am\n\nKobane calling by Zerocalcare, translated by Brune Seban\n\nWriter’s gender: Male\n\nWriter’s nationality: Italian\n\nOriginal language: Italian\n\nTranslated into: French\n\nLocation: Kobane and various other places in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria&..., Turkey, Rome (and specifically Rebibbia)\n\nFirst published in 2019 (for this specific version that contains extra material) by the feminist press Cambourakis\n\nKobane Calling is activist and graphic artist Zerocalcare’s journal/account of his two stays in Kobane and the mainly Kurdish Rojava region in Syria, where an autonomous democratic feminist, ecological and diverse self-government was created, stuck between a Turkey ruled by an anti-Kurd Erdogan, and Islamic State territories in Syria. We’ve all seen footage of Kurdish female soldiers defending Kobane against IS, but I hadn’t realised there was an organised state behind them. I learned a lot about the politics and geography of the place. Zerocalcare is very admiring of Rojava. He tries very hard to find faults, because he knows humans are flawed, but can’t seem to find any. I’d really like to believe it’s as fraternal and tolerant as described, but I doubt this utopia’s survived the real world, especially in a war zone.\n\nI’d like to add something about the French translation. The translator, Brune Seban made the bold choice of a very informal, slangy style (eg: “ch’uis crevé” instead of “je suis crevé” or “je suis fatigué”) interspersed with a handful of Roman slang words kept in Italian and explained in a glossary at the end of the book. That was a risky proposition, but I think she pulled it off. The French feels fresh and natural (it might age badly, but it’s perfect for today’s readers); the words kept in Italian didn’t annoy me or make it too difficult to understand. It could have felt contrived, but it didn’t. I loved it!\n\n112Dilara86\n\nMag 26, 2022, 11:38 am\n\nPoésie cubaine du xxe siècle (20th-century Cuban poetry), selected, introduced and translated by Claude Couffon\n\nWriters’ gender: mostly male, some female\n\nWriter’s nationality: Cuba\n\nOriginal language: Spanish\n\nTranslated into: French\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nFirst published in 1997\n\nThis is a big bilingual Spanish/French anthology of Cuban poems. I tried to read the Spanish original, but couldn’t sustain it for very long: my Spanish was too weak, and the French translation wasn’t literal enough to be of help when I needed it.

So I am going to clarify that I didn’t choose nor buy this book. Blame-shifting done ;-) However, I did read it, and I have to say that the rhymes are fantastic, and actually better than what’s found in the majority of French children’s books. They sound great and they have a perfect rhythm. The writer clearly has a musical ear. The illustrations are lovely and very colourful. Obviously, it’s still 30-odd pages about farts!

This bilingual Russian/French short story collection was all they had. The first work was a novella called “Le pain éternel”, about the discovery of a kind of edible jelly that self-regenerates, and could eradicate world hunger, if only people were less stupid and selfish. Another one, “La lumière invisible”, reminded me of Maurice Renard’s 1921 L’homme truqué, about a man who is able to “see” electricity.\n\nThe translation was very pleasant.

I did not really like it. Hector Abad talks about the life and assasination of his father, a famous public health specialist and human rights activist in Medellin while the city was the most insecure and oppressed.\n\n- Le Ciel à bout portant by Jorge Franco. This one is a fiction, about the son of one of Pablo Escobar's closest partner (Libardo is a real person if I remember correctly, or more exactly was, but the son character is totally fictional, as is the way Libardo's death is described), who comes back to Colombia and to Medellin (again...) after many years in Europe. I remember I liked this book. Not a ground-breaking book, but an interesting and unusual read.\n\nAnd more important maybe, I've read numerous books by Alvaros Mutis, including Ilona vient avec la pluie, La neige de l'amiral, La dernière escale du Tramp Steamer... I was a fan of Alvaros Mutis in my twenties and read almost all books featuring Maqroll el Gabiero, its recurring character.

Enjoy your reading & cooking Colombian month!\n\n129Dilara86\n\nMag 30, 2022, 9:10 am\n\nThank you all for your recommendations. I'll check what's available as soon as the library website is up again. I see I have The Informers in my wishlist already. This wishlist will soon be bigger than my actual library!\n\nI have finished The Abbess of Crewe. I admit I was expecting something a bit more subtle. I've started Tè mawon, a dystopic novel set in a mega-state that encompasses the Carribbean and Central America. There is a lot of creole and no glossary, so it's a bit of a challenge, but fun.\n\n130arubabookwoman\n\nModificato: Giu 2, 2022, 11:17 am\n\n>125 Dilara86: I liked Isle of Passion by Laura Restrepo very much. It's about settlers who were sent to Clipperton Island in the Pacific in a sovereignty dispute between France and Mexico, and then forgotten. Clipperton is now an uninhabited French possession.\n\n131Dilara86\n\nModificato: Giu 9, 2022, 4:00 am\n\n>130 arubabookwoman: Thank your for this recommendation. Isle of Passion ticks so many boxes for me: I will definitely read it at some point. Unfortunately not this month, as it's not available on scribd or from my local library.\n\nI've requested The Informers and downloaded La Expedición Botánica contada a los niños, a children's chapter book with a Spanish reading level I think I can manage, about José Celestino Mutis's botanical expedition to South America, by Elisa Mújica, an author who looked interesting but whose adult books I couldn't borrow in translation.\n\n132baswood\n\nGiu 9, 2022, 6:21 pm\n\nI have read The Sound of Things Falling and The Informers by Juan Gabriel Vásquez as English translations and enjoyed them both.\n\nMy current reading is Les Reputations which is obviously a french translation\n\n133Dilara86\n\nGiu 10, 2022, 3:38 am\n\nI see there is a lot of love for Juan Gabriel Vásquez! I should get my copy of The Informers, or Les dénonciateurs as it is known in French, today or tomorrow.

Avant ça, fok nou survivre à l’enfer qu’ils ont créé, dakò ?\n\nI only discovered Michael Roch recently, despite the fact that he is a French BookTube “celebrity”. Although it looks like it is on hiatus, his channel called La Brigade du Livre has nearly 38,000 subscribers, which may not be a lot for English-speaking booktubers, but is huge for the mid-sized French community. I can’t say I am a fan of the military aesthetics he is going for, and typically, the books or themes he chooses, or the style of his videos don’t do anything for me, but each to their own – I’m not his target audience, and that’s fine. I was still interested in reading his latest novel because of its setting and use of non-standard French. Plus, I will read any non-White, non-US SF writer I come across.\n\nTè mawon (terre marron, terre de marrons ?, ie land of Marroons) is a dystopic novel set in a futuristic Caribbean and partially written in Creole: there are several narrators, and they all have a distinct voice and way of using (or not) and mixing French and Creole. The epigraph is quite clear about the author’s position on language:\n\nMa langue est un chariot allant de mon cœur à ton esprit.\n\nElle me déplace entier pour t’apprendre ce que je suis,\n\ncomment je vois le monde, comment je le réfléchis.\n\nLibre à toi d’entrer en résistance ou en communion.\n\nNotre langue sera le reflet humble et honnête de notre relation.\n\nI understand what he means, but I feel there’s a slight passive-aggressiveness to the words that could have been avoided. The first pages were difficult, but once I got used to the creole, it was fine. I decided not to look up words: some words I already knew (“moun” means “person”, “lwa” is a vaudou deity, etc.), some words I could guess from context or from their closeness to French words (once you realize that a grave accent on a vowel denotes the dropping of a “r” in the equivalent French word (kò = corps, dakò = d’accord, tè = terre), you’re all set), some words were explained at some point in the book. Whole sentences required a bit more concentration, but as I wasn’t looking for a perfect, 100% parsing rate, I didn’t feel frustrated. Alternating creole-heavy and French-heavy voices provided some respite.\n\nMoving on to the story… The novel is set in a Caribbean mega-city-state that’s ethnically and linguistically diverse, but extremely divided along class lines. It was built away from the ground and rising sea-levels, with the well-to-do living in a modern, technologically up-to-date environment full of virtual reality enhancements, in the upper reaches of Lanvil called Anwo (en-haut), while others live down in the slums of Anba Lanvil or even on the margins outside, on the sea or on recovered land. It’s a prosperous place, one that European immigrants try to reach by all possible means, but it’s also a surveillance state, with facial recognition devices and “peace-keeping” bots (“bobots”) everywhere. Obviously, some people are going to rebel. None of this is terribly original, but the Caribbean setting and the language gave it a fresh twist.\n\nI tend to like descriptive, slow-paced novels, which this book wasn’t. The authors is clearly more interested in action, emotions and impressions (and of course, stylistic acrobatics), rather than details, and the plot is a bit hazy. Against all odds, it held my interest, thanks in part to the aforementioned acrobatics, and even that is slightly surprising, as I tend to like understated writing!\n\n135Dilara86\n\nModificato: Lug 9, 2022, 1:41 pm\n\nJune reads\n\nLovers and Strangers: An Immigrant History of Post-War Britain by Clair Wills (still ongoing)\n\nTè mawon by Michael Roch\n\nEn l'absence du capitaine by Cécile Coulon\n\nLa Expedición Botánica contada a los niños by Elisa Mújica (ongoing)\n\nLes Dénonciateurs by Juan Gabriel Vásquez\n\nRainbow Warriors by Ayerdhal (unfinished)\n\nHéritage by Miguel Bonnefoy\n\nLes enfants Tanner by Robert Walser\n\nMaisons de mineurs: Patrimoine majeur du Nord-Pas-de-Calais by Yves Le Maner\n\nM.

I’d be very interested to see what an English translator does with the material. They would have to be able to work with an English-based Caribbean pidgin and English. The publisher would have to give proper thought to the translator they choose.\n\n138labfs39\n\nGiu 13, 2022, 10:24 am\n\n>137 Dilara86: I agree that it's unlikely to be translated, especially given its nature.

There are enough parallels between English/Pidgin and French/Creole for it to be workable and make sense.

Not the most cheerful subject matter, and a book that would have been far too painful to read 5 years ago, when my mother died, but one that speaks to me and is almost soothing now.\n\nCécile Coulon is a young author from the Auvergne region whose 2019 novel Une bête au Paradis was a highlight of that year’s Rentrée littéraire. Her poems are heartfelt and very readable. The language is typically simple, with straightforward syntax and no complicated words. Her love poems are directed at her girlfriend. That made me realise that I hadn’t come across many examples of French lesbian poetry. Many of her poems give a strong sense of place, with mentions of burons, volcanoes/puys, a black cathedral, without sounding “terroir” at all.\n\nI loved it!\n\n141Dilara86\n\nGiu 18, 2022, 5:14 am\n\nI finished Les Dénonciateurs (The Informers) by Juan Gabriel Vásquez a couple of days ago.

Here they are:\n\nDempuèi Auriac by Cocanha - a song in Occitan about a worker traveling from Aurillac to Marseille, via Montpellier (lyrics and translation here)\n\nChampignon by Astaffort Mods who make fun of tourists who take the train to Bordeaux and drive to the countryside in a rented car to pick mushrooms, and never find any because locals have been there before and will not tell them where the good spots are.\n\n144LolaWalser\n\nGiu 20, 2022, 3:28 pm\n\nHey, I'm so happy Macron got his ass whupped!

He still has a relative majority, and he's going to have to be extra nice to the people to the right of him (\"Les Républicains\") to get his laws passed. He tarred all the NUPES with the far-left brush, which none of them are, and somehow, some people believed it, and came away with the impression that the NUPES was just as dangerous as the far-right, if not more. If you count all the right-wing deputies, from the far- and ultra-right to Macron (who I maintain is a right-winger with right-wing policies and a tendency to play footsie with Le Pen), there is a clear right-wing majority.\n\n146LolaWalser\n\nGiu 20, 2022, 4:09 pm\n\nYes, as I said, I don't expect France NOT to be conservative (i.e. right-wing), but I still enjoy seeing that smug ratface taken down a peg by a leftist coalition.\n\n147Dilara86\n\nModificato: Giu 21, 2022, 2:32 am\n\n>146 LolaWalser: So do I, for sure!
