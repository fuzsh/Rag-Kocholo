        "text": "Today, we say farewell to one of our longest-serving staff members, and a Workshop fixture for as long as most of us can remember. Today, @AetherX finally steps down as a moderator of the Writers Workshop. Some users may recall his epic (And so nearly finished!) Unpredictable, or his mega 50-review spree a couple of years ago. His contribution to the section has for some years perhaps been invisible - the vicissitudes of life have a way of squeezing our time - but without his work behind the scenes many of the standard features of the Workshop would have been that much harder to maintain. We're particularly indebted to AetherX as a repeated judge in the Workshop Awards, and I can personally say he was of huge help when we overhauled the Ratings guide last year.\n\nOn behalf of the moderator team, and the Writers Workshop, I say thank you for your years of service.\n\nThanks for everything, baether! When I was head, your insight was invaluable, and you simply floored me with the great ideas you had. I hope retirement‘s good to you and your writing.\n\nMore importantly, though, I’m grateful for the opportunity to have gotten to know you better as a friend through being staff, and I’ll see ya around for more fun shenanigans~\n\nI've not known you for very long, @AetherX, but your hard work during the last section competition was admirable and you've clearly done a great deal for this community. Thank you for all of it. Wishing you all the best; may you complete that fanfic of yours someday!"
