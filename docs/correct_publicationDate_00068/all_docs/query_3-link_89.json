Unfortunately, she's forgotten. Convinced that the secret lies within God's Final Message to His Creation they go in search of it.\n\nAnd, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it . . .\n\nFollow Arthur Dent's galactic (mis)adventures in the last of the 'trilogy of five', Mostly Harmless."
