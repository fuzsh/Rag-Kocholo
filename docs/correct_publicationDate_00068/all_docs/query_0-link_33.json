        "text": "Sugar beet is one of the crops grown in Germany with the highest intensity of traffic on the field. Not only are there very high numbers of passes by the machines during the season, but the sugar beet harvesting vehicles are also among the largest and heaviest machines in use in Germany. The heavy harvesters are also used elsewhere in the world. In order to avoid multiple passes with the heavy wheel loads, the machines can often offset their rear axles parallel to the direction of travel - the so-called crab steering (CS). This distributes the load over a larger area, but also means that more area is covered in the field.\n\nThis study examines whether the distribution of wheel loads over a larger area using CS shows a significant difference in soil settlement and deformation compared to traffic without the use of crab steering (wCS). Different moisture contents of the soil are taken into account.\n\nThe model named FiTraM was used to model the traffic. The calculation of the soil deformation is based on empirical formulas, which are specially adapted to this field and the harvester.\n\nThe subsoil in particular is considered, as soil deformation should be avoided there, since it is difficult and cost-intensive to repair.\n\nThe results show that there are no significant differences in the distribution of soil deformation between CS and wCS. In general, the moisture content of the soil determines the extent of deformation. In moist to very wet conditions (approx. 35 - 37 Vol-%), the first pass already achieves such a high degree of soil deformation that it should be avoided in practice. When the soil is dry (approx. 25-30% by volume), no soil deformation occurs in the subsoil in any of the variants - only slight deformation occurs in the topsoil. There are likewise no significant differences between the two traffic variants between 31 and 34 Vol.-% soil moisture.\n\nIn summary, it can be assumed that a wheel or axle of the beet harvester is already so heavy that it makes little difference whether the machine is running in CS or not. The limiting factors are the total weight and the soil moisture content during traffic.\n\nHow to cite: Augustin, K., Lorenz, M., Duttmann, R., and Kuhwald, M.: Is it more conservative to use the crab steering during sugar beet harvesting? A case study from Lower Saxony, Germany, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-3172, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3172, 2024.\n\nSoil compaction and soil erosion by water are among the top 5 threats to agricultural soils in Europe. Soil compaction has a direct impact on soil erosion, for instance by reducing infiltration rates. Therefore, measures directly addressing soil compaction (e.g. optimized field traffic and reduced wheel load) have an impact on soil erosion by water. In addition, measures such as crop rotation management, including cover crop management, allow combined effects on soil erosion and soil compaction. Currently, no evidence at regional scale is available that indicates which measures can generate this co-benefit and which regions having a high risk of soil erosion and compaction can benefit from those measures. Modelling exercises provide the option for generating this information and are tested here in a regional scale case study.\n\nAs a first step, we identified cropland with a combined risk of soil compaction and soil erosion by water in Lower Saxony (northern Germany). To this end, we derived typical crop rotations for 2017 to 2021 based on high-resolution crop type maps for three soil regions in the study area. Depending on the crop rotations and farm size, typical machinery equipment was defined and field work dates were derived according to phenological data. This data was combined with three weather scenarios using real observational data (dry: 2020, wet: 2017, intermediate: 2004). We employed the USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) and the SaSCiA-model (Spatially explicit Soil Compaction risk Assessment) to model soil erosion and soil compaction risk for the different weather scenarios and the three typical crop rotations in the soil regions. The results help to identify regions with combined risk for soil erosion and soil compaction. The next step will be the analysis of measures addressing both degradation processes.\n\nHow to cite: Steinhoff-Knopp, B., Kuhwald, M., Bäumler, K., Saggau, P., and Lorenz, M.: Identifying areas of multiple soil degradation processes at regional scale, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-21890, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-21890, 2024.\n\nSoil compaction caused by intensive field traffic is one of the main threats to agricultural soils. Soil compaction occurs when the applied soil stress is higher than the soil strength. Both, soil strength and stress, are highly variable in space and time. While soil strength mainly depends on environmental conditions (e.g. weather, soil type, crop type), soil stress results from the used machinery. One key parameter for the applied soil stress is the wheel load which results from the machinery setup. The wheel load carrying capacity (WLCC) approach takes this into account and specifies the maximum wheel load until soil stress does not exceed the soil strength.\n\nThe objective of this study is to model and analyse the dynamic variation of WLCC at regional scale for a 5-year period (2016-2020). We selected a study area (~2000 km²) with highly mechanized agriculture in Northern Germany where the main crops are cereals, maize and sugar beets. Sentinel-2 images were used to derive the crops for the 5-year period. We calculated the WLCC using an advanced version of the SaSCiA-model (Spatially explicit Soil Compaction risk Assessment) for each day of the 5 years.\n\nThe results show a high temporal dynamic characteristic of the WLCC during the crop rotation at regional scale. The relatively dry years 2016 and 2018 increased the maximum allowable wheel load, especially during harvesting of maize and sugar beets in autumn. In all 5 years, spring was the time with the lowest WLCC. At this time, however, high soil stresses occur due to the application of slurry and digestates, which is associated with high soil compaction risk. The spatial variation of WLCC depends on the one hand on soil properties such as soil texture. On the other hand, the used crop has a high effect on the WLCC due to different soil water utilization.\n\nBased on the spatio-temporal analysis of WLCC at regional scale, an assessment can be performed to reduce the soil compaction risk either by increasing the soil strength or by decreasing the soil stress. We show exemplarily how the adjustment of tire inflation pressure affects the WLCC. Finally, this study may contribute to understand WLCC dynamics in crop rotations at regional scale and may help to mitigate further soil compaction.\n\nHow to cite: Kuhwald, M., Kuhwald, K., and Duttmann, R.: Spatio-temporal modelling of wheel load carrying capacity (WLCC) to mitigate soil degradation at regional scale, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-12361, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-12361, 2024.\n\nThe global goal to mitigate climate change (CC) is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) by 2050; the European Union (EU) aim is to cut GHGE at least by 55% already by 2030. These ambition targets require new GHGE mitigation measures across all land use sectors (LULUCF), where wetlands, as carbon (C) rich ecosystem, can effectively contribute to climate targets, biodiversity, and water-related ecosystem services. Natural peatlands accumulate C effectively due to water-logged conditions. However, they can turn into high GHG sources if they are drained, therefore there is still need to enhance knowledge regarding how and/or how much C is sequestered or released by peatlands after their restoration, as well as the socioeconomic effects.\n\n“ALFAwetlands - Restoration for the future” (www.alfawetlands.eu) is a Horizon Europe funded project (2022-2026), which is coordinated by Luke and carried out at local to EU levels with 15 partners across Europe. It’s main goal, in short, is to mitigate CC while supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) and being socially just and rewarding. This includes, e.g., increasing the knowledge about C storage and release in peatlands, specifically after restoration. While, in terms of C fluxes, focussing on peatlands, the project scope is larger and includes additionally floodplains, coastal wetlands and few artificial wetlands. ALFAwetlands will develop and indicate management alternatives for wetlands including such that have been or will be restored during this project. Measures under this project are not restricted to ecological restoration but include rehabilitation and re-vegetation action to improve ecosystem conditions (e.g., peatland forest: continuous-cover-forestry, cultivated peatlands: paludiculture). Studies are conducted in 9 Living Labs (LL’s) including 30 sites, which are located in wetlands in different parts of Europe (north-south gradient). At the local level, LL’s support and integrate interdisciplinary and multi-actor research on ecological, environmental, economic, and social issues. Experimental data from local sites are scaled-up and will be utilized e.g., by models to gain and understanding the potential impacts of upscaled wetland restoration measures. To achieve ALFAwetlands goals, 5 research workpackages are being implemented, namely: 1)improve geospatial knowledge base of wetlands, 2)co-create socially fair and rewarding pathways for wetland restoration, 3)estimate effects of restoration on GHGE and BES, with the data achieved from field experiments, 4)develop policy relevant scenarios for CC and BES, and 5)study societal impacts of wetland restoration. The project will also encourage stakeholders to utilise outputs and support their active participation in wetland management.\n\nHow to cite: Ukonmaanaho, L., Larmola, T., Aalto, T., Andersson, E., Soosaar, K., Barthelmes, A., Abramchuk, M., Balkovic, J., Haltia, E., Shchoka, I., Raman, M., Decleer, K., Lazdins, A., Penuelas, J., Descals, A., Sanchez-Perez, J.

Well-established coastal forests offer protection to alleviate these adverse effects and provide various ecosystem functions, such as carbon sequestration and soil conservation. Soils account for approximately 74% of the carbon stock in terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, even a subtle increase in soil carbon can lead to significant carbon sequestration. Reforestation is considered a suitable practice to enhance both above- and belowground carbon sequestration. However, the benefits of reforestation in coastal areas are hindered by land subsidence and seawater intrusion due to over-exploitation of groundwater for fish farming or manufacturing. To overcome these obstacles, a reforestation practice known as the \"ditch-and-embankment technique (D-E technique)\" is adopted. This technique involves reforesting coastal lands suffering from land subsidence by constructing inter-parallel ditches and hills. By applying the D-E technique, soil properties can be improved through salt leaching, and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock can be enriched by organic matter inputs from reforested trees. However, the effectiveness of this technique in terms of soil carbon and soil amelioration lacks sufficient evidence. In this study, we investigated the soil carbon stock and soil salinity of a 15-year-old coastal plantation, consisting of four dominant species (Casuarina equisetifolia, Millettia pinnata, Melaleuca leucadendra, Cerbera manghas) established by the D-E technique on the western coast of Taiwan. Soil samples from hills (O horizon and mineral soil) and ditches were collected using soil cores and a piston sampler. A proximate submerged forest was used as a reference baseline. Soil carbon was determined as organic, inorganic, and elemental carbon with a TOC analyzer. Soil salinity was measured in terms of soil pH and electrical conductance (EC1:5). Our results showed that the D-E technique could increase the total SOC stock (O horizon + 0-50 cm mineral SOC) to an average of 48.38 Mg C ha-1, compared to the submerged forest (12.22 Mg C ha-1). The total SOC stocks of hills ranged from 38.02-60.33 Mg C ha-1, significantly higher than the submerged forest, irrespective of species, although there were no significant differences in total SOC stocks between species. Consistent with total SOC stocks, mineral SOC stocks of hills (13.91 -24.49 Mg C ha-1) were generally higher than the submerged forest, with only those from Cerbera manghas and Millettia pinnata being significantly or marginally higher. The similar amount of total inorganic carbon stock between hills and the submerged forest further supported the contribution of reforestation. Soil pH at the 0-5 cm layer of hills was lower than in the deeper soil layer and soils from the ditch. Additionally, EC generally were lower at soil at 0-5 cm or 5-10 cm layers, suggesting the occurrence of salt leaching. In conclusion, our preliminary study suggests that the D-E technique could be an appropriate reforestation approach to establish coastal plantations in areas subject to land subsidence, meeting multiple objectives, including protecting residents' well-being, soil carbon sequestration, and soil salinity amelioration.\n\nHow to cite: Lee, C.-Y., Lin, G.-Y., Liu, Y.-H., Wang, H.-W., Chen, C.-F., and Chang, L.-W.: Reforestation based on the ditch-and-embankment technique increased soil carbon stock and alleviated soil salinity in a coastal area subject to land subsidence- a preliminary study, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-3804, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-3804, 2024.\n\nWe are sorry, but presentations are only available for users who registered for the conference. Thank you.\n\nPeatlands are a significant global storage of carbon (C), but also major sources of nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to surface waters. Export of DOC from peatlands to watercourses cause emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to degradation of DOC, as well as enhances the brownification of surface waters, altering the ecological networks of the aquatic ecosystems. Managed peatland forests are hotspots for DOC export into downstream water bodies due to forestry practices such as harvesting and drainage. Water table, soil oxygen availability and vegetation control the release and transport of DOC.\n\nDrainage of peatlands also alters the physical characteristics of peat (Word et al., 2022). However, the role of these peat characteristics in the processes and release of DOC, as well as their influence on the lateral fluxes of carbon from forested peatlands, remains unknown.\n\nIn this contribution, we present results from a laboratory experiment where the physical properties of peat and their relationship to peat decomposition are studied in a minerotrophic, nutrient-rich peatland forest that has been drained for ~80 years. The peat for the study was collected from the field site, located in southern Finland, into 50 cm columns along three transects. The transects extend from 1 to 30 meter distance from the ditch. In laboratory, the bulk density and water retention characteristics of the peat will first be determined in relation to distance to the ditch. The CO2 emission potential is then defined as the function of these peat properties. This is done by measuring the CO2 fluxes of the peat with a chamber enclosure method, using a Li-7810 online CH4-CO2-H2O analyser.\n\nThe results of this experiment will increase the process-level understanding of the mechanisms that drive the export of DOC from peatlands. The produced data will be further utilized in an ecosystem model, to be used in assessing and evaluating environmental impacts of forest management practises.\n\nReferences\n\nWord CS, McLaughlin DL, Strahm BD, Stewart RD, Varner JM, Wurster FC, Amestoy TJ, Link NT. 2022.

However, evidence suggests that species monocultures may not be as resilient to drought spells and heat waves compared to mixtures of two or more species. The advantage of mixed forests over monocultures is particularly evident when the mixed species occupy different niches, reducing inter-specific competition and enabling better growth and increased carbon sequestration. However, it remains unclear how drought events and heat waves affect carbon sequestration in the soil and how this differs between mixed forests and species monocultures. In this study, we conducted two years of intensive monitoring of soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes, measured soil microbial diversity, and assessed long-term (tree ring) and seasonal tree growth to quantify carbon sequestration in a mixed forest and a spruce monoculture. Results showed that severe drought in 2022 significantly reduced the growth of Norway spruce stand and its' forest floor and soil CO2 fluxes but at lesser intensity impacted C fluxes of European beech and silver fir stand. The bark beetle outbreak in 2023 caused rapid tree infestation and die-back only in the spruce stand (followed by salvage clear-cut harvesting) which subsequently increased soil CO2 emissions via a sudden increase in litter input from dead trees, soil temperature and water content from reduction of shade and evapotranspiration.\n\nHow to cite: Bosela, M., Tupek, B., Marcis, P., Poltak, D., Rybar, J., Vido, J., Nalevanková, P., Lehtonen, A., and Makipaa, R.: Effects of drought and disturbance on the CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a mixed forest and spruce monoculture, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-20393, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-20393, 2024.\n\nA new measure to mitigate soil compaction: Stabilisation effects of greening headlands\n\nAuthors: C. Körbs1, M. Kuhwald1, M. Lorenz2, R. Duttmann1,\n\n1Working group of Landscape Ecology and Geoinformation, Institut of Geography, Kiel University, Christian-Albrechts-Platz 4, 24118 Kiel, Germany\n\n2Johann Heinrich von Thünen-Institut (TI), Thünen Institute of Agricultural Technology, Bundesallee 47, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany\n\nSubmitted 10. January 2024 to the EGU24\n\nSession: SSS9.1- Soil degradation by soil compaction on arable land, grassland and in forests\n\nThe greening of fields is a common measure in agriculture to prevent soil erosion and often serves as an intercrop. Grass buffer stripes can stabilise the topsoil and thus reduce runoff and promote sediment retention and water infiltration. The existing literature lacks emphasis on examining the stabilising effects specifically related to the greening of headlands. Moreover, there is a need to explore how the implementation of greening practices can mitigate the adverse effects of field traffic and to what extent it can contribute to reducing soil compaction.\n\nAs part of the SOILAssist project investigations were carried out on a selected field at the experimental farm in Adenstedt (Lower Saxony, Germany) to study soil structure and functionality. One part of the headland was used to establish a greening with a width of 18m.\n\nTo analyse the effects of the greened headland, soil samples were taken in the core field, the greened headland, and the non-greened headland directly after the greening in 2019 and after 4 years in 2023. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken at 20, 35 and 50cm depth. Afterwards, the soil samples were analysed in the laboratory to provide information on physical soil properties e.g. dry bulk density, air conductivity, air capacity and aggregate stability. In addition, the yield was measured every year in each of the variants.\n\nThe results show that the dry bulk density in 2023 was predominantly lower in the core field in 2023 compared to 2019. In contrast, the dry bulk density in the greened headland was generally constant and in the non-greened headland it was slightly lower in 2023 than in 2019 at the depth of 20cm. The lower dry bulk density in the non-greened headland can be explained by the used primary tillage, which lowered the dry bulk density in the topsoil. Since there was no tillage on the greened headland, the effects despite the similar intensity of field traffic remained constant at this part of the field. However, the dry bulk density did not increase in the greened headland which indicates a stabilisation by the vegetation and thus lower the negative impacts of field traffic. At the depth of 35 and 50cm no significant changes were measured, neither for greened nor for non-greened headland.\n\nWhether these effects become more apparent considering the correlation between various soil properties and to which extent a change in soil type plays a role in the stabilisation of headlands through greening will be investigated in the following studies.\n\nHow to cite: Körbs, C., Kuhwald, M., Lorenz, M., and Duttmann, R.: A new measure to mitigate soil compaction: Stabilisation effects of greening headlands, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-18128, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-18128, 2024.\n\nAgricultural terraces are very conspicuous features of many mountain landscapes in the world. In the Mediterranean region, rural depopulation and farmland abandonment has led to a process of vegetation expansion on former cultivated terraces, either by natural revegetation or afforestation programs. The main objectives of this study were i) to determine land use changes in a representative Mediterranean mountain area dominated by agricultural terraces in the past, and ii) investigate the effect of different land use and land cover (LULC) on soil properties, SOC and N stocks. For this purpose, five different LULCs (cultivated land, dense and sparse shrublands, old Q. ilex forest and P. sylvestris afforestation) were selected in terraced slopes in the Iberian range, in N. Spain. For each LULC, soil samples were collected every 10 cm down to 50 cm. The results showed that in the last 70 years, shrub cover has doubled (from 280 ha in 1957 to 430 ha in 2020) and forest cover has increased from 46 ha to 171 ha. SOC and N contents strongly decreased with depth, except for the cultivated plots, where the values remain similar through the soil profile. In the top layer, SOC contents were higher in Q. ilex, followed by afforested P. sylvestris, dense and sparse shrubland and cultivated plots. N contents presented a similar pattern except for afforested P. sylvestris, which presented the lowest values. SOC and N stocks were higher in Q. ilex, cultivated land, dense and sparse shrubs, and afforested P. sylvestris. Understanding the effects of LULCC on soil properties and nutrients is essential to assess land management practices after farmland abandonment on agricultural terraces.\n\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported by the MANMOUNT project (PID2019-105983RB-100/AEI/10.13039/501100011033), funded by the MICINN-FEDER.\n\nHow to cite: Lana-Renault, N., Llena, M., Arnáez, J., Gómez-Eguílaz, E., Nadal-Romero, E., and Cammeraat, E.: How do land use and land cover changes affect soil properties and nutrients in abandoned agricultural terraces?, EGU General Assembly 2024, Vienna, Austria, 14–19 Apr 2024, EGU24-15630, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu24-15630, 2024."
