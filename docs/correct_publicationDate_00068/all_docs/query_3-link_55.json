Ironic, when that is – to use the kind of language found only in business meetings – supposed to be my ‘core activity’.\n\nI’ve had eighteen months of health ups and downs, from which I am finally emerging. Not unscathed, but emerging, nonetheless. It has made me focus on what I want to achieve, and how best to go about this, and my inevitable conclusion was: something’s gotta give.\n\nWith great reluctance, I realised that that ‘something’ was my blogging efforts on Murder Is Everywhere. It’s been an honour and a privilege to count myself among the fine authors collected on MiE, but needs must.\n\nI hope to continue to blog on my own website, and have even been offered the occasional guest spot by one or two of my friends on MiE.
