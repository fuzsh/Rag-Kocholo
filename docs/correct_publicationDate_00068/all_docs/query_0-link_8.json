Friends of Photography was a nonprofit organization started by Ansel Adams and others in 1967 to promote photography as a fine art. During its existence the organization held at least 330 photography exhibitions at its galleries in Carmel and San Francisco, California, and it published a lengthy series of monographs under the name Untitled. Untitled was published Friends of Photography from 1972 to 1994. A total of 58 numbered publications were issued, first as a small magazine format and later as a series of booklets and full-size books. Numbers 1-10 displayed the series name and issue number on the cover, but as the publications became more specialized each number was titled independently in addition to the series name. The smallest publication in the series was Number 1, with 10 pages, and the largest was Number 43, with 156 pages. Many of the publications were catalogs of exhibitions held at the Friends of Photography gallery in Carmel, California. The publication featured many famous photographers, including Ansel Adams, Ruth Bernhard, Harry Callahan, Roy DeCarava, Lee Friedlander, Mary Ellen Mark, Aaron Siskind, Paul Strand, Brett Weston, and Edward Weston. It also offered perspectives on newer photographic trends like plastic cameras and the influence of pop-art.The series of Untitled monographs includes: 1: Edward Weston, Dody W.
