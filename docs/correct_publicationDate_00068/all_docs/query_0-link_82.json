        "meta_description": "Dans ses deux recueils de poésie The Boy from the Chemist is Here to See You (1998) et The Ice Age (2002), Paul Farley explore les dichotomies classiques opposant nature et culture, microcosme et macrocosme dans une écriture poétique novatrice qui définit un engagement éthique et façonne une relation à la terre qui prône une attention radicale à l'infime comme à l'infini. Cette étude interroge ce mode d'attention spécifique à travers lequel le poète ouvre une brèche dans la matière et explore les ténèbres pour y déceler la source du visible. La terre devient ainsi cette \"pellicule obscure\" (The Dark Film, titre d'un recueil de poèmes publié en 2012) sur laquelle le lecteur est invité à déchiffrer les traces d'une nature au sein de laquelle l'humain et le non-humain ne sauraient être dissociés. Au cœur d'une société déconnectée, obsédée par sa propre technicité, et où l'homme s'est coupé du monde sensible et des autres, Paul Farley redéfinit ainsi les modalités du visible en tissant ensemble le poétique et le politique et déploie une attention au monde qui est à la fois d'ordre esthétique et éthique.",

        "text": "1Paul Farley is a British contemporary poet who was born in Liverpool in 1965. This paper will focus on two of his collections: the first one, The Boy from the Chemist is Here to See You (1998), which was awarded the Forward Poetry Prize for Best First Collection and a Somerset Maugham Award, and The Ice Age, which won the 2002 Whitbread Poetry Award. Paul Farley is also well-known for his work as broadcaster on the BBC for which he has written radio drama. His latest opus is The Dark Film (2012).\n\n4Indeed, Paul Farley's poetry evinces an undeniable fascination for darkness which he turns into a true source of vision. There are countless examples in his first collection, such as the dark place of the bus depot in \"Depot,\" the window cleaner's journey through the night in \"A Thousand Hours,\" the orgiastic sexual intercourse hidden \"inside storage sheds\" in \"A Carry-On,\" or the \"daylight nights\" of the dark vinyl collectors in \"Epic Soundtracks,\" to mention but a few.\n\n4 \"In conversation: Mark Haddon and Paul Farley\", https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/03/mark- (...)\n\nAll the fish and birds in my poems—I don't know what they represent. They're just these little energies in the world. I've watched birds all my life. The first time I saw a greenfinch on a nut bag in a garden in Liverpool, I thought it was a miracle. And I've never lost that feeling, even about everyday birds.\n\nProbing into the dark\n\n8In The Boy from the Chemist is Here to See You Paul Farley precisely chooses to redefine the representable and the visible by focusing on disregarded North England cities and suburbs, thus reorienting our gaze towards a natural world that escapes city man. The first two lines of his preliminary poem, \"Eaux d'Artifice\"—\"The moon we know from dreams or celluloid / is high tonight\" (1) project a fantasized object, akin to that recorded on photographic film, an artificial image whose very vision evinces our blindness, our dull lack of vision.\n\n9The commonly visible thus becomes invisible: the shape stands for the unseen natural element and frees itself from the signified. In so doing it ushers in what Jacques Rancière defines as \"the aesthetic state […] a pure instance of suspension, a moment when form is experienced for itself. […] it is the moment of the formation and education of a specific type of humanity\" (24).\n\n10Paul Farley's \"celluloid\" moon powerfully sends the reader/viewer back to his own artificial gaze. And yet, the moon is, with Mercury, the only non-artificial element in the entire poem. The downward gaze that explores the \"dried-up fountain bed\" discloses not only an artificial garden landscape, with its \"rhododendroned paths,\" or the \"domed palm-house,\" but it also circumscribes a narrowing space that is set in sharp contrast with the infinite expanse of the universe.\n\n11Thus, the poem traps the reader between the \"small ways,\" and the confinement of the greenhouse that \"brought the sky down closer,\" and the wide-open swath where waters surge and eerily stand\n\n[…] suspended arcs and cords\n\nof water, one so powerful it could hold\n\nthe weight of terrified cats […]\n\n[…] The water only comes here now\n\nto rest after the day-dreams spent in cloud\n\n[…]\n\nand then moves on. Its work is never done,\n\nlike man's. (1)\n\n12The poem sketches out in its centre a momentum that was created by man and eludes him to join the universe, inviting the reader to follow the ungraspable. As the poet gazes at the crest of yews \"pointed heavenwards\" he builds up a new regime of visibility through which outer space is furrowed by our dreams as much as by the impetus of man-tamed waters that reflect and expand our creative urge. The two run-on-lines are symbolic of an up and down movement that shapes out a new life cycle connecting man to his own inward dream, so that verticality is reversed, just as in the first two lines of the poem: upward means inward.\n\n13Not only are heterogeneous spaces and temporalities brought together (the cosmic and the human, the mechanical and the human) but their connection fosters a new regime whereby, as Rancière explains, \"the activity of thought and sensible receptivity become a single reality. They constitute a sort of new region of being\" (JR 27). From the dark, narrow paths of the dead park, Paul Farley conjures up a symbolic, lively reality through which man is reborn: the poet is thus brought \"back to earth / soaked through with sweat, under her bone-light,\" as if bathed in the still \"Eaux d'Artifice,\" that exude both the white radiance and the uncanny substance of the moon. The poet therefore embodies a new man who, in the wake of the romantics, reasserts the deep, intimate connection not only of man and its earthly surroundings but also of the earthly and the unearthly.\n\n14Contemplating the moon in the last lines, the poet imagines he may be seeing either \"Mercury or the Eutalsat.\" Hesitating between the planet that lies closest to the sun and whose craters are more or less akin to those of the hidden face of the moon, and the satellites that keep alive global human communication, the poem joins the natural and the artificial, just as landscape gardeners and their elaborate fountains. Sketching out a world that is neither still nor moving, neither stable nor unstable, the poet's voice achieves a precarious balance between opposites, not unlike the moon, the Earth's only natural satellite that always shows the same bright face, although its surface is actually dark. The final lines blending movement and stasis, closeness and distance—\"I walk these rhodendroned paths […] / and find my level on a bench, like this\" may then be heard as an invitation to this new \"Distribution of the Sensible\" whereby man is brought to adopt an uncertain balance, and pay attention to dark bodies that enlighten and redefine our relationship to the world. Leading us back into our daily world Farley's poetics offers a mode of perception that is, quintessentially, a mode of interrogation, as defined by Paul Celan:\n\n8 Paul Celan, \"Le Méridien\", cité par Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, La poésie comme expérience, Paris: Ch (...)\n\nLe poème devient […] le poème de quelqu'un qui est en train — encore en train — de percevoir, qui est tourné vers ce qui est en train d'apparaître, et qui interroge cette apparition, lui adresse la parole. […]\n\n15Likewise, Farley calls forth a new art of seeing by conjuring a world that is to be gazed at and addressed in its mysterious darkness. Therefore, the central poem, \"Treacle,\" becomes programmatic of a writing that delves into a \"pitch black\" matter \"that doesn't give any reflection back\" (14).\n\n16Set at the heart of The Boy from the Chemist is Here to See You, this poem is not unlike Samson's riddle—\"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness\" (Judges 14:14)—which appears on the tins of Lyle's treacle and is quoted in the poem. Indeed, the poem unfolds as a conundrum asking the reader to rely upon his own resources and decipher the mirror effects with the first poem in the collection that played on the unexpected refractions of the moon in \"Mercury or the Eutalsat.\" Likewise, \"Treacle\" offers mysterious refractions in its \"unstable pitch black\" surface \"like mercury / that doesn't give any reflection back\" (14). Simultaneously, the poem's object stands out as a relic from old times, \"a throwback,\" a by-product of the sugar refining industry that dates back to the golden times of the British Empire in the West Indies. As such, it conjures up a specific \"history\" that focuses on the minute and looks back to \"the sandstone and bricks / of our museums and art galleries,\" for \"something lost from our streets / like horseshit or coalsmoke\" (14). This lost presence foregrounds a lost meaning: an impossible riddle, a long-lost awareness that lies in wait \"between the cracks of everything\" and humorously involves the reader:\n\n[…] you pour its content over yourself\n\nand smear it into every orifice.\n\nYou're history now, a captive explorer\n\nStaked out for the insects; you're tarred\n\nAnd feel its caul harden. (14-5)\n\n17Asking the reader to solve the conundrum, Farley artfully blends poetics and politics through a language that reorders and reshapes our vision of the present, the past and the future by constructing what Rancière calls \"fictions\":\n\nthat is to say material rearrangements of signs and images, relationships between, what is seen and what is said. […] They define models of speech or action but also regimes of sensible intensity. They draft maps of the visible, trajectories between the visible and the sayable […] They reconfigure the map of the sensible by interfering with the functionality of gestures and rhythms adapted to the natural cycles of production, reproduction, and submission. (39)\n\n19The entire collection explores the deep furrows of a land covered in bitumen and concrete, bus depots (2) and termini (3), service stations (22-3), building sites (26), silent football pitches (29), and sleepy estates (47) where man is trapped like a moth between darkness and a dazzling light that destroys vision in a \"blank stare\" (\"The Sleep of Estates\" 47). Darkness invades the pitch in mid-afternoon—\"The afternoon / is dark already, and there is a moon (\"A Minute's Silence\" 31)—and the moon only makes darkness thicker, while artificial light—be it \"street light\" (\"Darkroom\" 28), the \"daylight nights\" (Epic Soundtracks\" 37) or that of \"The Lamp\"—sends the poet and reader back to themselves: \"you saw yourself, a reader in the dark\" (\"The Lamp\" 43). The various forms of \"artificial glow\" (\"The Lamp\" 43) turn the light inwards, rendering the lack of natural light even more painful, highlighting the subject's craving for the land that has been destroyed, such as in \"Documentarist\":\n\n[…] Look back into this lens\n\nbeyond the here-and-now, to darkened rooms:\n\nthe future screens its ideas of us,\n\nto rows that multiply back endlessly.\n\nSmile, as they file out to a world\n\nof worked-out seams, depopulated seas,\n\nthe ancient shock of daylight still playing. (42)\n\n11 Michel Serres, Yeux, Paris : Le Pommier, 2014, 69.\n\nI like walking in darkness when I am inside and grope for walls and doors but even more so when I am outside, at night, by an obscure Moon, when the soles of my feet sense the path and its softer texture against the roadside. […] A giorno we light up our rooms, towns, roads, and harbours; lamps and neon tubes replace daylight; we have become blind to the fading colours of sunset and dawn: we see all the time. […] We are trapped in a lighted cave. Let's turn round the old images: may not the search for truth lie along the path of darkness?\n\n13 Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet, G5-6.\n\nwe must wander through landscapes, where assemblages of the dead gather together with the living. In their juxtapositions, we see liveability anew. […] Ghosts point to our forgetting, showing us how living landscapes are imbued with earlier tracks and traces. […] Ghosts remind us that we live in an impossible present—a time of rupture, a world haunted with the threat of extinction.\n\n23Through the dim, inward light of poet(h)ical meditation Paul Farley foregrounds new modes of visibility and posits the act of beholding as the only true, although aporetic, goal of mankind that brings to our attention the dead, the broken, and the minute.\n\n'These fragments I have shored against my ruins'\n\n24 Richard Inger, Richard Gregory, James P. Duffy, Iain Stott, Petr Voříšek and Kevin J. Gaston, \"Comm (...)\n\nConsiderably less attention has been given to declines in more common species, which is troubling because these are important in the delivery of absolute levels of ecosystem function and of ecosystem goods and services […] Indeed, although they may constitute a small proportion of the species richness, common species often define the structure, character and dynamics of ecosystems […] Even relatively small proportional declines in the abundances of common species will often result in the loss of large numbers of individuals and substantial amounts of biomass, with dramatic ecosystem consequences […] Potential declines in common birds are also important as a growing body of evidence suggests that birds play vital roles in the structuring and functioning of ecosystems and that declines in their numbers will likely reduce key ecosystem processes and services including decomposition, pest control, pollination and seed dispersal. […]\n\n27Thus, by directing attention towards the common species, Paul Farley invites us to rethink the complex dimension of our world as these ordinary birds that play a paramount role in regulating our ecosystem also stand out in our daily urban lives as our only contact with a natural world that we can observe, listen to, protect and nurture on a regular and personal scale.\n\n29The poem therefore turns into a metaphysical guide book, forcing us to look \"down the wrong end of those field-glasses […] / which were pawned for something irredeemable\" (7), back towards man's deathly imprint upon a land that he has forsaken for material profit. But it also orients our thoughts backwards, by recalling to our forgetful minds that, as Elaine Gan, Anna Tsing, Heather Swanson, and Nils Bubandt argue:\n\n29 Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet, G2.\n\nOur era of human destruction has trained our eyes only on the immediate promises of power and profits. This refusal of the past, and even the present, will condemn us to continue fouling our nests. How can we get back to the pasts we need to see the present more clearly? […] Every landscape is haunted by past ways of life.\n\n30The \"notes in the flyleaves\" (7) convey the silent echo of the dead birds' notes as well as the faint hope of a world where man will once again \"Look\" (7) and care for \"the world outside my window\" (7).\n\na draft for the hidden dead, our forefathers,\n\nthe landfills of the mind where they turned in\n\nwith the plush and orange peel of yesteryear,\n\nused up and entertained and put to bed\n\nat last; to this view where everything seems to turn\n\non the middle distance. Crematoria, multiplex\n\nway stations in the form of big sheds\n\nthat house their promises of goods and sex; (3)\n\n32This landscape is torn by a great rift that divides, on the one hand, the temporal and personal map where the poet contemplates the ghosts that inhabit the depths (\"the landfills of the mind\") and whose colours take on the hue of past memories (\"the plush and orange peel of yesteryear\"), now definitely buried (\"put to bed / at last\"); and, on the other, the topography of suburban space that stretches \"on the middle distance\" and where everything is equidistant: \"Crematoria, multiplex / way stations\" where the dead and the living meet, where \"goods and sex\" are equally bargained for. The sharp contrast between vertical and horizontal landscapes, enhanced by the run-on lines and broken lines, is dramatized in the first lines of the following stanza—\"[…] the promise of a university town, / its spires and playing fields\"—and subsequently annihilated: \"No border guards,\" \"no shakedown,\" \"Nobody will pull the cord / on these thoughts\" (3). The persona is trapped in \"a carriage full of ghosts\" (3) wherefrom the sweeping view of the flat expanse reveals an inert, level landscape (\"the slow outskirts\" 4). The poet is progressively denied any view as the carriage window, grown as dark as his \"pinot noir\" (4), obliterates vision, sending him back his own negative image. The present becomes a blank crisscrossed by disconnected sights (\"water hardens,\" \"rows / of streetlights become the dominant motif\") and haphazard memories (\"miles of feint, the months of Sunday school, / the gallons of free milk\" (4). Inner and outer maps merge into a single void: \"an empty dining-car, a single fool / reflected endlessly on the night air.\" Out of this void, Paul Farley summons us to look for the innumerable ghosts that people our world, like the great, defunct animals that dwelled in the Ice Age and whose traces have left their prints upon our earth. Such are the vanishing sparrows and nightingales in \"A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain & Europe,\" or the \"deep-sea fish\" in \"Cod\" that \"recede / back to the ocean cold from whence they came\" (10), laying out before our unbelieving eyes the map of a dying world.\n\n33This deathly reality comes to the fore in \"The Ages\" where the poet, reminiscing childhood outdoor games draws our attention to the transient cycles of human dwelling:\n\nThe trees lay down their seam of coal as thin\n\nas hammered gold leaf all afternoon\n\nwhen a child is called from the Iron Age war\n\nhe's been waging with the next street; […]\n\nThe ages, coming thick and fast tonight.\n\nI caught one on my bedroom ceiling: the globe\n\nof a paper light-shade caught in headlights\n\nwas a Golden Age symbol of truth and reason;\n\nthen a cold planet again. I yawn and fear the dark\n\nlike any good caveman. […] (11)\n\n35In a landscape that bears the imprint of an inevitable disaster, where the subject is shut off from nature and doomed to contemplate past, present and future behind a room or a train window, poetry stands out as the only tool that might enable one to reach out to the silent, estranged Other, and rebuild our defunct relationship to place.\n\nThe silent story\n\n37Rilke's lines prompted Berque to posit that the poetic welding of the world relies on the interpenetration of distinct worlds and calls for a deep, progressive transformation of the self and of the world:\n\n36 Ecoumène, 142.\n\n[…] the ecumenal relationship is both a passive and an active one. […] our milieu […] is the domain upon which we act, and bears the imprint of our action, but it is also the domain that affects us and to which we belong in some way. I also mean that the ecumene is a fluid relation, with mobile lines such as horizons, with changing focalisations, constantly evolving […] We participate ontologically in this relation, just as everything else in our milieu; which means that our being and theirs overlap or even identify with one another to some extent.\n\n38This \"fluid relation\" that redefines our being in the world and with others is most perceptible in the poem \"The Landing Stage\" where the persona addresses his ageing and silent mother whom he brings back to the common place of their respective young and happy years:\n\n[…] I've brought you here\n\nto see if any of this might do the trick\n\nlike the tape of a favourite song or voice, familiar\n\nand played in the hope the sleeper will awake\n\nfrom a spell. I haven't been back here for years (13)\n\n39Travelling through space amounts to travelling back in time to this \"landing-stage\" where speaker and addressee reach out to their own intimate \"Weltinnenraum\": the secret place where they tune to the \"bedrock\" (13), where they are in touch again with the flow of things—\"and it takes a while to realise we're afloat\"—, where, responding to the land and sea, they may once again respond to one another: \"I'm hoping the river's moods and play of lights / might kindle a sentence, or raise you from the deep / and empty stare that gives nothing back.\" (13) In the inexpressive, inscrutable surface of the old mother's eyes the reader recognizes the blank train window or the pitchblack surface of treacle \"that doesn't give any reflection back\" (The Boy 14). The invisible is once again the source of vision, albeit not a seer's vision, but a vision that persistently denies sight and transforms itself into an extension of the unseen, paving the way for the emergence of all too-often disregarded sensations. Thus, the mute mother and her son share the same fate: that of \"those hostages blindfolded in a boot / who memorise each bump in the road, the scent of tarmac / where a road opens up […]\" (13).\n\n40This \"road opens up\" a new array of sensations that, by relying on more immediate, less abstract perceptions, conjure up a new, paradoxically sightless vision that materialises in \"this photograph\" where the persona recognizes not the past image but the past sensations:\n\nI'm listening under a pram's hood;\n\nagainst the sea-wall a wind whips up your hair, a bottle blonde\n\nI must have tugged a thousand times but can't recall; (13)\n\nI guess what story you were reading there. She knows,\n\nlooking up from her picture-book microcopy,\n\ncaught in a long vowel sound. Though the shutter was slow (14)\n\n43The displacement is both spatial and temporal as the shift in tenses matches the changing focalisation and triggers a reversal through which the \"picture-book\" is seen as if through the wrong end of a telescope. The tiny, imperceptible detail, the \"microcopy,\" becomes central to the understanding of the past story while the dilated, anguished \"long vowel sound\" conveys the inexpressible violence of the mother's silent suffering. The return to the present tense in the following stanza abruptly throws the reader back into the mute reality that cannot be expressed but only transposed, displaced onto a landscape that bears the imprint of man's excruciating self-enclosure:\n\nthe grey river hides its tons of cadmium and mercury.\n\nThe arteries harden and little by little the flow\n\nStops. Oxygen-sensitive memory. (14)\n\n44The abruptly broken line severed into two halves by the blank between these two stanzas, the run-on-lines that postpones the verb \"Stops\" until the last line and the ultimately striking echo between \"Stops\" and \"memory,\" inverting the subject and the verb, concur to dramatise the mother's neurolinguistic paralysis.\n\n45Yet, the very poisoned river that symbolises the mother's petrified memory becomes at the end of the poem the recipient of a commonly shared and shaped past that is kept alive in the very flow of the wor(l)d:\n\n[…] the grey river recalls each note and will reel them off\n\nlike verb forms taught by rote. The river remembers\n\nits whiting, fluke and mackerel well enough\n\nand their counterpoint that sounds in the shell of our ears\n\nand moves in from the west, that peak and trough\n\nand roil of surf which is our cantus firmus. (15)\n\n46\"the grey river recalls\" and \"The river remembers\" echo each other, thus counterbalancing the following run-on-lines and creating a parallel, subliminal lexical, semantic and phonetic coherence that ensures the flow of memory onward and backward. As a consequence, \"verb forms\" materialise into \"whiting, fluke and mackerel\" while the water rhythm in the final stanza turns into a polyphonic composition evocative of Gregorian chant. The \"cantus firmus,\" which was traditionally sung in the lowest voice in the 13th century, carries the undertone of the ongoing memory, of the unstoppable life that extends well beyond the paralysis of human silence and suffuses the landscape with a transcending impetus and persistent harmony. It is the antidote to the \"collapsed chords\" the mother's diseased mind painfully grapples with, it is the antithesis to the \"woman in a wheelchair\" trapped by time. It is the ultimate \"landing stage\" for both mother and son.\n\n49Paul Farley's poetry celebrates a land imprinted with an intimate and collective history. One of the final poems in the collection, \"Thorns,\" exemplifies Farley's subtle way of turning the land into a page where he teaches his reader to decipher man's intense struggle with an extended fate that binds him to his ancestors as much as to the natural world that bears the seeds of universal posterity.\n\n50The opening lines of the poem offer a radically different perspective from that of the train window in the introductory poem to the collection:\n\nI saw it all sharply again at a thousand feet,\n\nabove the tree-line, my eye […]\n\n[…] coming to rest\n\non the solitary black mass of a thorn\n\ngrowing out of grey rock;\n\nor my ear was led by the song-flight\n\nof a shrike on its way to the nest:\n\neither way I was hooked. (41)\n\n51The bird's eye view expands over fives lines and competes with hearing to provide an eagle's perspective. And just as the persona of the poem appears to have crossed borders and taken on a non-human shape, so has the thorn that is compared in the following stanza to human attributes or manmade objects: \"It looked like a mould of veins of the heart, / a frightwig, a land-mine\" (41). Eventually, the thorn takes on the appearance of a human being disguised as the Edinburgh \"Burryman,\" covered from head to ankles in burrs. As the similes expand, so does the symbolic growth of the thorn that comes to embody the twisty sinews of time itself: \"never some easy flashback, / more a tangle to be handled with care\" (42). Ultimately, the thorn conjures up a land akin to the \"holy ground\" of the burning bush in Exodus (3:1-5) and where the poet revisits the battlefields of WWI:\n\nonly here he's a soldier again on the Western Front\n\ncaught on one inch of the millions of kilometres of wire\n\nthat coiled through his stories: Arras, Amiens, Ypres. (43)\n\n52The trapped soldier identified as \"my grandfather\" is not unlike the prey of the shrike that is known for its habit of impaling its quarry on a thorn before tearing it apart: human and natural history therefore share the same violent, predatory essence. The thorn functions as a place of epiphany that blends time and space and takes on an allegorical function through its address to man:\n\nI'm what you think you've shaken off,\n\nthough every place you've ever been since then\n\nhas seen something of me along the way.\n\n[…]\n\nSee how I've still got everything it takes\n\nTo hang on, while you've drank a lake of beer\n\nand toked so much you could turn into a bush! (45)\n\nConclusion\n\n54Out of the harrowing chaos of a prickly reality Farley \"founds a voice\" (47) that shows a new way into the world. Through a writing that ushers in a \"relation to the world that abolishes a space that can be objectively measured\" the subject experiences what Berque calls, referring to Heidegger's concept of \"Entfernung,\" an \"undistancing\" (109). As the various temporal layers conjoin within a single, dilated, ever-expanding space, Arras, Amiens,Ypres—like the suburbs of York, Liverpool or Manchester, like Lubetkin or the Lutwaffe—are part and parcel of the current \"unlikely place\" (46) that turns into the place of an inner becoming. The battlegrounds of the first World War, just as \"the planted thorn in the Groves\" (42) or in some \"lowland estate\" (42) or \"the bush […] / […] coming out of the blocks\" (44) conflate into one single and multitudinous reality, a single space-time that fuses past, present and future, abolishing distance and rendering man present to what has \"become invisible\" (46).\n\n55Focusing our eye to ground level, on the \"grey rock\" (41), on \"the knotted and fibrous, […] wizened stem\" (41), on the \"thistle, bramble and nettle\" (43) of his boyhood wild dens, Paul Farley does not only draw our attention to the imperceptible: he also forces us to touch ground, the selfsame ground we shall return to, and thus confront our own finitude. His \"republic of thorns\" subsumes the essence of the artist's work which, as Berque explains, expands our awareness that:\n\n47 Berque, Etre Humains sur la Terre, 206.\n\n[…] the human being […] is only fully human, and subject, through his very finitude which, upon his death, brings him back to the earth—the ultimate place of his subjectivity.\n\nIt is precisely because the individual subject can die […] that he becomes in turn the place of subjects to be. He does so through his works, through his descendants, through memory and through his body's return to the earth.\n\n56Eventually, the poet pursuing his journey at ground level rediscovers the thorny path that has wound its way into his very being:\n\nMy speech is still a thorny, north-west stew;\n\nI walk along each public right-of-way\n\na trespasser; there is no single view\n\nworth taking; rootless man, still clinging on\n\nto some idea of truth, some ideal state\n\njust round the next bend, found out today\n\nhe's bound towards a republic of thorns,\n\nthe flag it flies: straining, grey polythene;\n\nits rhyme and scheme, the way it founds a voice;\n\nits bird-life, clinging to an older way;\n\nthe way it soldiers on and knows its place. (47)\n\n57Farley weaves time and space in his \"republic of thorns\"—our literally common thing, our shared place—where the \"grey polythene\" caught in its brambles competes with \"its bird-life\" and gives way to a new voice that carves its own \"rhyme and scheme.\" Such a republic is both man's imprint and its mould; it is the place wherefrom the poet may pursue his journey, a place of opening up to the limitless intricacies of the real."
