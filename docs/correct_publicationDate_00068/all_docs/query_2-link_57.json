        "text": "David A. Robertson, a Swampy Cree author based in Winnipeg, writes books for readers of all ages. He has published several books across a variety of genres, including the graphic novels Will I See? and Sugar Falls, a Governor General's Literary Award-winning picture book called When We Were Alone, which was illustrated by Julie Flett.\n\nHis most recent books are the novel The Theory of Crows, the YA series The Misewa Saga, the picture book On the Trapline and the memoir Black Water. He also hosted the CBC Manitoba podcast Kiwew.\n\nOn Sept. 30, Canada will mark National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, a time to commemorate children who died while being forced to attend residential schools, those who survived and made it home and their families and communities still affected by the lasting trauma.\n\nWhy the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation isn't just another stat holiday\n\nIn 2021, Robertson curated this list of books by Indigenous writers about residential schools. He originally posted the list on Twitter and repurposed it for CBC Books.\n\nWhy David A. Robertson curated this list\n\nMy grandmother, Sarah Robertson, attended Norway House Indian Residential School in the 1920s and early 1930s. She died having never told her story, other than to remark to one of her granddaughters how sad it had made her when they cut her hair. And to tell my mother that her sister had died while attending Towers Island Day School, but she'd not found out until long after Maggie's death.\n\nHer experience is lost history, a story that will remain forever untold. At Norway House Indian Residential School, officials fed children rotten food. Girls slept outside on balconies because enrolment was always overcapacity. Kids were tied up so that they wouldn't run away. In 1907, a boy, Charles Cline, ran away after getting beaten for wetting his bed. He lost six toes after seeking protection from the elements in a shed. And how were school officials held accountable? Charles's mom was given a bag of flour every month for the rest of the school year.\n\nStories have been, and always will be, the best way to educate ourselves about the truth.\n\nMy grandmother may have experienced similar trauma or may have avoided it by some miracle, but we'll never know.\n\nLast week, the bodies of 215 children, some as young as three, were found buried at Kamloops Indian Residential School. Indigenous people knew a discovery like this was an eventuality as much as we know that it's a tragedy that will be repeated. The Truth & Reconciliation Commission confirmed 3,200 deaths as part of its investigation, but Senator Murray Sinclair believes there could be closer to 25,000. If at least 150,000 Indigenous children attended residential schools in its 165-year history, that means 17 per cent of the children died while attending residential school. Some schools' mortality rates were 40 per cent.\n\nIt can no longer be disputed that the residential school system was genocide, and the question now is: What are you going to do about it? Because outrage, thoughts and prayers, retweets and likes, are not enough.\n\nI think the answer starts with stories. Stories have been, and always will be, the best way to educate ourselves about the truth. You have to recognize that you have the power to be the authors of reconciliation if you read as much as you can, listen as much as you can, learn as much as you can, and then take meaningful, informed action.\n\nI don't know your role, but I know that youth are inherently better positioned than anybody to create the sort of change we need to see, and so we need to focus on them. Stories reveal the world to kids — the world that was, the world that is and the world that can be. What kind of future do you want to have?\n\nHere are some books by Indigenous authors to get you started on your learning journey. Please keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list. There are more stories out there.\n\nIndian Horse by Richard Wagamese\n\nIndian Horse by Richard Wagamese tells the story of Saul Indian Horse, a young Ojibway boy who is ripped from his family and forcibly placed in residential school. Saul, a gifted hockey player, is both victim and witness to the dehumanizing abuse of students at the school.

He is the author of six novels, one collection of poetry and three memoirs. Two of his books, Indian Horse and One Story, One Song, appear on this list. He died in 2017.\n\nThe Orange Shirt Story & Phyllis's Orange Shirt, both written by Phyllis Webstad, illustrated by Brock Nicol\n\nOrange Shirt Day on Sept. 30 is an annual opportunity for people of all ages to stand in solidarity with residential school survivors and their families by wearing orange. The event is inspired by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad's experience of being stripped of a brand new orange shirt on her first day attending residential school when she was just six years old. Webstad's book, The Orange Shirt Story, shares what it meant for the writer to be deprived of her beloved clothing — and her sense of identity — at such a young age.\n\nThe Orange Shirt Story is for readers aged 7-10.\n\nPhyllis's Orange Shirt is an adaptation of The Orange Shirt Story for readers aged 4-6.\n\nPhyllis Webstad reflects on inspiring Orange Shirt Day and starting a movement\n\nWebstad is Northern Secwepemc from the Stswecem'c Xgat'tem First Nation.

In the time she has left, she soaks in the natural wonders of the world around her, from the tall grass to the tadpoles in the creek.

It tells the story of six-year-old Shin-chi as he heads to residential school for the first time with his older sister, Shi-shi-etko. As the children are driven away in the back of a cattle truck, Shin-chi's sister tells him all the things they must remember about home. Shin-chi knows it will be a long time before he sees his family, not until the sockeye salmon return.
