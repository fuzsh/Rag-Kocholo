        "text": "Presented by the Martens Centre.\n\nBy LAURENS CERULUS\n\nwith ZOYA SHEFTALOVICH\n\nPRESENTED BY\n\nSend feedback here | Tweet @laurenscerulus | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nFACE MASK FREE MOVEMENT: National capitals around Europe have stepped up their unilateral moves to fight the coronavirus, including by imposing border checks and banning the export of medical gear. Those moves forced the European Commission to ring the alarm on Sunday and follow through with new measures today.\n\nIn a video message, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ‚Äúit is of utmost importance to keep our internal market going‚Äù and announced the Commission had adopted an ‚Äúexport authorization scheme for protective equipment.‚Äù The EU export ban would mean things like face masks ‚Äúcan only be exported to non-EU countries with the explicit authorization of the EU governments,‚Äù von der Leyen said, adding ‚Äúnational bans on selling protecting equipment to other member states are not good.‚Äù\n\nThe fine print: The Commission‚Äôs new ‚Äúimplementing act‚Äù is here ‚Äî member countries still have to give it their final approval. Bottom line: The plan would allow EU governments to block sales to non-bloc countries but not to each other. The Commission seemed confident this will stop internal EU export bans.\n\nNow read this: ‚ÄúFrom Beijing to Brussels, from Rome to Washington, London and beyond, politicians haven‚Äôt just failed to rise to the occasion, they‚Äôve engaged in a dangerous game of parsing, obfuscation and reality-denial that has cost lives and delayed a resolute response,‚Äù writes Matthew Karnitschnig this morning. ‚ÄúAfter weeks of largely ignoring the unfolding crisis, leaders from France to Austria have been forced by a sudden explosion of cases to impose severe limits on their citizens. Just a week ago, France hosted the largest Smurf convention ever, drawing more than 3,500 visitors. On Saturday, the country‚Äôs prime minister announced the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops.‚Äù\n\nGOOD MORNING. Good thing ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt bar you from reading Playbook. I‚Äôm Laurens Cerulus, a senior policy reporter on the tech team, filling in for Florian. No prizes for guessing what‚Äôs top of the agenda today. Check out POLITICO‚Äôs new coronavirus hub. We‚Äôve also got a new afternoon newsletter called the POLITICO Coronavirus Daily Update ‚Äî sign up here. And stay on our live blog for the latest as it happens.\n\n**A message from the Martens Centre: Want to keep up with all our past and upcoming activities? Then follow our newsletter so that you don‚Äôt miss out on any new events, podcasts and publications concerning relevant and current topics!**\n\nGOING VIRAL\n\nINCOMING ‚Äî MORE EU MEASURES: Today, the European Commission will launch joint EU tenders to procure testing kits and respiratory ventilators, and will present guidelines on border measures to national governments. Lili Bayer, Jillian Deutsch, Jakob Hanke and Paola Tamma have more.\n\nFINANCE MINISTERS have a Eurogroup meeting today ‚Äúto agree on comprehensive and coordinated EU economic policy response to this health crisis,‚Äù president and Portuguese Finance Minister M√°rio Centeno tweeted. It‚Äôll be held over the phone.\n\nTHE G7 has a videoconference today to ‚Äúcoordinate research efforts on a vaccine and treatments, and work on an economic and financial response,‚Äù French President Emmanuel Macron announced over the weekend.\n\nPOLITICO‚ÄôS HOLDING A CONFERENCE CALL TOO. At 11 a.m. CET, we‚Äôll be holding a live Pro briefing call on the impact of the virus and how the world‚Äôs responding to it. Our health care reporters will be joined by Herman Goossens, professor of microbiology at the University of Antwerp, and David Heymann, a former WHO and CDC official and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dial in.\n\nCORONA TOUR D‚ÄôEUROPE\n\nüá©üá™ GERMANY IS THIS MORNING CLOSING ITS BORDERS with France, Austria, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland (except for commuters and goods transporters). The government is also drafting a third version of its export ban on personal protective equipment, it said on Saturday, following EU threats to launch infringement procedures.\n\nMaking America Great Again (by buying German): German government officials on Sunday confirmed a Die Welt report that U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration offered ‚Äúlarge sums of money‚Äù to get exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by German biopharmaceutical company CureVac. German officials will discuss the matter in crisis meetings today, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Washington Post. Dietmar Hopp, CureVac‚Äôs top shareholder, said the company is not for sale, adding: ‚ÄúIf we hopefully manage to find a vaccine, it should reach, protect and help people in the whole world.‚Äù\n\nüá´üá∑ FRANCE CLOSES BARS AND RESTAURANTS: French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said supermarkets, newsstands and pharmacies will be the only retailers allowed to remain open, while French officials told POLITICO‚Äôs Rym Momtaz and Elisa Braun that stricter coronavirus confinement measures are likely if people don‚Äôt respond to the government‚Äôs social distancing pleas.\n\nLet them eat bread: Baguettes are essential so bakeries remain open for now, the Conf√©d√©ration Boulangerie P√¢tisserie tweeted.\n\nüá™üá∏ SPAIN LOCKDOWN: Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez addressed the nation on Saturday evening to announce people could only leave their homes to buy groceries and pharmaceutical products, go to the bank or hospital, or to take care of dependents.\n\nüá≥üá± DUTCH PM MARK RUTTE WILL GIVE A RARE NATIONAL ADDRESS this evening, Eline Schaart reports. Joop den Uyl delivered the last formal address by a Dutch PM during the oil crisis in 1973. The government also called on schools and childcare centers, bars, restaurants and sport clubs to close from today.\n\nüáµüáπ PORTUGAL AND SPAIN TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TODAY to limit transit across their common border, Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Costa announced. He said that while trade and cross-border commuters will be allowed to pass, all others would have to justify their trips, and tourists will be turned away.\n\nüá™üá™ ESTONIA IS INTRODUCING BORDER CONTROLS on Tuesday, the government said. Anyone entering the country from March 17 must spend two weeks self-quarantining.\n\nüá®üáø THE CZECH REPUBLIC has banned people from moving around except for work, shopping and some other limited activities until March 24.\n\nüá∏üáÆ SLOVENIA will shut down its air traffic from Tuesday.\n\nüá¶üáπ AUSTRIA‚ÄôS CHANCELLOR Sebastian Kurz announced major restrictions on movement in public places on Sunday, banning gatherings of more than five people and putting further limits on who can enter the country.\n\nüá¨üáß THE UK GOVERNMENT, meanwhile, is increasingly under pressure for holding back on more hardline measures, as the number of people infected in Britain rose to over 1,300 on Sunday, with the death toll at 35. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced America had extended its European travel ban to the U.K. and Ireland, effective from this morning.\n\nüáßüá™ CAN CORONAVIRUS CHANGE BELGIAN POLITICS? Belgian political parties met repeatedly over the weekend to discuss forming an emergency government to fight the health crisis. The caretaker government, headed by Prime Minister Sophie Wilm√®s, received emergency powers on Sunday to tackle coronavirus, and a number of parties agreed to support the administration as a minority government for up to six months. Ten parties, including the three in government, are expected to back the plan in parliament this week, Reuters reports.\n\nLet them eat frites: Belgian Health Minister Maggie De Block announced that Belgian fritures will remain open. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt all starve,‚Äù De Block said.\n\nüá∫üá∏ MEANWHILE, IN THE US: Illinois, Ohio and California announced closures of bars and restaurants, New York state forced the closure of schools in New York City, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance Sunday night recommending the cancellation or postponement of events with 50 or more people throughout the U.S. for the next eight weeks. Our Stateside colleagues have the latest.\n\nüá®üá≥ CORONA CHARM OFFENSIVE ‚Äî GEOPOLITICS OF A PANDEMIC: Beijing, meanwhile, claims it has its corona crisis under control, and is reaching out to other countries to offer help. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is shipping 500,000 masks and other medical gear to Li√®ge, local public broadcaster VRT reported, and a plane loaded with Chinese medical staff and aid arrived in Italy over the weekend. According to Philippe Le Corre, senior researcher on China at the Harvard Kennedy School, Beijing‚Äôs aid efforts in Italy and across Europe are aimed at repairing its ‚Äúvery badly damaged‚Äù image abroad. But, Le Corre said, ‚ÄúThe reality is that it‚Äôs going to be very difficult for China to restore its image as a country that helps the world.‚Äù\n\nCOULD CORONA BREAK THE EU? Dalibor Rohac from the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. argues in an op-ed on POLITICO that the pandemic has created an economic shock on a scale that could exceed the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBUT NOW FOR SOME GOOD NEWS: Islamic terrorist group ISIS in its latest al-Naba newsletter advised members to ‚Äústay away from the land of the epidemic,‚Äù i.e. Europe, the Sunday Times reports.\n\nLOCKED DOWN IN THE BUBBLE\n\nNO PLACE LIKE THE HOME OFFICE: Life in Brussels‚Äô Quartier Europ√©en has ground to a halt, with EU institutions closed for all but the essential activities. As of this morning, European Commission officials ‚Äúin non-critical functions‚Äù will work from home, while ‚Äúcritical‚Äù staff such as Cabinet officials will work in shifts in the Berlaymont. The European Parliament has postponed or canceled all committee meetings, while the Council canceled all but ‚Äúessential meetings.‚Äù It‚Äôs like summer recess, but less fun.\n\nThere are fears the teleworking regime will strain the EU‚Äôs IT systems, in particular those of the 32,000 Commission staffers. A Commission spokesperson assured us things are under control, with IT systems scaled up and ‚Äúsufficient capacity for all staff with corporate laptops.‚Äù\n\nCybersecurity experts are on high alert: Staffers working from home are more likely to use unprotected networks and devices for official tasks, and hackers are using the coronavirus to lure them into downloading malicious software and hand over access to online accounts. Exhibit A: Hackers are posing as World Health Organization and national health ministry officials.\n\nPSA: The European Cybersecurity Agency ENISA sent some tips for Playbook readers working from home.\n\nLITERATURE FOR A LOCKDOWN: From Boccaccio to Michael Crichton, Paola Tamma and Christian Oliver have some, er, feel-good classics to cheer you up.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nTURNOUT TANKS IN FRENCH ELECTIONS: The coronavirus pandemic pushed turnout to a record low in French local elections on Sunday, prompting opposition politicians to call on Emmanuel Macron to postpone the second round, scheduled for next Sunday. Full details here.\n\nParis results: Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo won 30.2 percent of the vote in her bid for reelection, ahead of conservative former Justice Minister Rachida Dati on 22 percent, according to an Ipsos/Sopra Steria estimate. Macron‚Äôs candidate, former Health Minister Agn√®s Buzyn, trailed in third place on 17.6 percent.\n\nWinners and losers: The night was grim for Macron‚Äôs LREM party, which failed to make headway in major cities. And Marine Le Pen‚Äôs National Rally failed to increase its fortunes ‚Äî there was no far-right wave this time, though the party is set to hold on to the cities it won in 2014. Rym Montaz, Elisa Braun and Laura Kayali have the takeaways.\n\nBREXIT LATEST: Brussels is willing to establish a zero-tariff area for goods with the U.K. but it will impose fines on unfair competitive behavior, according to a draft text for a future relations agreement seen by POLITICO‚Äôs trade team. ‚ÄúThe text ‚Äî which came out Friday ‚Äî crosses several of Britain‚Äôs red lines, meaning the talks will likely be tough,‚Äù our Trade colleagues report. ‚ÄúThe 441-page document ‚Äî read it here ‚Äî drafted by the European Commission lays out for the first time in legal text what Brussels wants from the U.K. The EU wants to ‚Äòestablish a free trade area in trade in goods‚Äô in which ‚Äòcustoms duties on goods originating in the other party shall be prohibited.'‚Äù Read the full details in this morning‚Äôs POLITICO Pro Morning Trade.\n\nVideo killed the Brexit-negotiating star: The Brexit talks will no longer be conducted face-to-face because of coronavirus, and trade experts tell Emilio Casalicchio that setting out demands to an opponent on a screen is going to be a problem.\n\nSPAIN‚ÄôS ROYAL FLUSH: Spain‚Äôs royal household announced on Sunday that in order to ‚Äúpreserve the dignity‚Äù of the crown, King Felipe VI had renounced the inheritance he was set to receive from his father, emeritus King Juan Carlos I, and canceled the taxpayer-funded allowance allocated to the former monarch. The emeritus king is implicated in a tax evasion scandal in Switzerland, where prosecutors are investigating an ‚Ç¨88 million offshore account he operated in the alpine country. According to the Tribune de Gen√®ve, Swiss authorities believe the cash came from kickbacks the then-monarch received for setting up business deals between Spanish companies and Saudi Arabia in 2008. King Felipe was implicated in the scandal on Saturday, when the Telegraph reported he was named as the beneficiary of a separate offshore account containing ‚Ç¨65 million ‚Äúgifted‚Äù to Juan Carlos I by Saudi Arabia.\n\nICYMI ‚Äî ORBAN‚ÄôS BACK: Romania‚Äôs parliament on Saturday backed a second government led by Ludovic Orban. Carmen Paun has more.\n\nALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER THE BRIDE: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden committed Sunday to picking a woman for his vice president if he were to win the party‚Äôs nomination. John Harris writes that the former vice president is now bringing together the demographic and ideological blocs of the Democratic Party.\n\nTECH CORNER\n\nHERE FIRST ‚Äî EUROPE‚ÄôS INDUSTRY CHIEFS CALL FOR COMPENSATION TO RIP AND REPLACE HUAWEI: The European Round Table for Industry (ERT) is calling on governments that want to exclude Chinese vendors from their 5G networks to compensate for the losses incurred by its clients. More than 50 top executives of industrial giants including Daimler, BASF, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and others backed a new position paper stating that if governments ban Huawei and ZTE, ‚Äúthey should ensure that corresponding costs are compensated through adequate measures, including fiscal measures.‚Äù\n\nGovernments across the Continent are currently adopting measures for 5G security, following a January deal with EU experts to limit Europe‚Äôs reliance on ‚Äúhigh-risk suppliers‚Äù (read: China‚Äôs Huawei and ZTE). But telecom operators have long complained such partial bans would impose high costs when they roll out 5G networks. Today‚Äôs joint call is the strongest public signal by industry yet for governments to not only talk about bans, but also cough up some cash.\n\nPLAYBOOK INTERVIEW ‚Äî BELGIAN DIGITAL MINISTER PHILIPPE DE BACKER: Playbook sat down with Philippe De Backer, Belgium‚Äôs caretaker minister of digital affairs, telecom policy and privacy, to talk 5G and AI.\n\nOn 5G in Brussels: Belgian regional governments are still deadlocked over the rollout of 5G mobile internet. One unresolved issue is that Brussels has longstanding, record-high restrictions on radiation levels, and local anti-antennae activists argue 5G poses serious health risks. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to repeat what happened with 4G,‚Äù said De Backer, referring to the EU capital‚Äôs horrible mobile internet connection quality. He said the science is clear and there is no sense in holding off the rollout.\n\nAsked if Brussels‚Äô local politicians would agree, De Backer said: ‚ÄúI hope they‚Äôre realizing Europe is watching.‚Äù He added that a final deal should get a green light in Brussels, ‚Äúunless of course you say we‚Äôll roll out 5G across Belgium except in Brussels ‚Ä¶ If Flanders agrees, Wallonia agrees, German speakers agree, but Brussels doesn‚Äôt, we could have 5G everywhere except in Brussels.‚Äù\n\nOn AI: The EU should have pushed through a five-year ban on facial recognition, De Backer said. The Commission floated such a temporary ban on the controversial technology in a draft AI white paper in January, but cut it from the final version. ‚ÄúI was very disappointed that the Commission didn‚Äôt stick to such a ban,‚Äù De Backer said. ‚ÄúWe have to go easy with this technology. It‚Äôs such a radical technology that requires you to thoroughly think about how to implement it in public spaces.‚Äù\n\nOVER AND OUT\n\nBIRTHDAYS: MEP Saskia Bricmont; NATO‚Äôs Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg; Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney; U.K. MP and former MEP Anneliese Dodds; European Commission‚Äôs former Secretary-General Alexander Italianer; ChinaEU‚Äôs Claudia Vernotti; IBM‚Äôs Zachery Bishop; Riccardo Reati of Zurich Insurance.\n\nCelebrated Sunday: Former MEPs Stefano Maullu and Luigi Morgano; Stefan Bredl; Theoretical chemist and Nobel Prize-winner Martin Karplus; Hungary‚Äôs National Day.\n\nCelebrated Saturday: MEPs Alessandra Basso, Antonius Manders, Philippe Lamberts and Iuliu Winkler; Former MEP Hans-Olaf Henkel; Sarah Mulcahy; Albert II, prince of Monaco; Blackberry founder Mihal Lazaridis.\n\nTHANKS TO PLAYBOOK‚ÄôS STELLAR CONTRIBUTING TEAM: Aitor Hern√°ndez-Morales, Rym Momtaz, Jillian Deutsch, Lili Bayer, Jakob Hanke, Barbara Moens, Judith Mischke, Arthur Neslen, Melissa Heikkil√§, Ma√Øa de La Baume and Francesco Piccinelli.\n\nTHANKS ALSO to our producer Miriam Webber.\n\n**A message from the Martens Centre: Ever wondered how we can safeguard personal privacy or how we can handle our own sensitive data?
