        "text": "This article examines the history of the scenario tool as pioneered by Royal Dutch Shell (the Shell Group, hereafter Shell) from 1967 on. Scenarios of the next fifteen to thirty years came to be embraced as a new tool in the management of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in the years between 1967, when the first scenario exercise was run, and the mid-1990s. This article, which focuses mainly on the period until 1976, asks why. It proposes that the answer lies in the perceived need by multinationals, and not least oil corporations, to think in forward-oriented ways in order to protect their interests in the shakeup of global capitalism that occurred in this period. For global oil, a new need arose in this period to manage social relations and expectations including environmental concerns. Oil companies found themselves obliged to hold together territories of concerned consumers in the West, on the one hand, with territories under new property-rights regimes in the former host nations of the South, on the other. To Shell in particular, projecting a virtuous image of the global oil corporation and demonstrating a new set of promising futures of oil became central to the management of both of these relationships. Scenarios also became an interesting management tool because of perceptions in the late 1960s and early 1970s of the risk for new forms of state intervention and regulation in the context of the debate on limits to natural resources. The article proposes that this fear of regulation inspired a new identity for Shell as a key coordinator of not only economic but also political, social, and moral relationships.\n\nThe history of the scenario method in Shell can be positioned in a recently developing literature in business history that has brought it closer to environmental, transnational, and in fact political history.Footnote 1 In recent years, the role of business as a transnational actor has become a strong theme, and so have questions related to the circulation of capital and commodities in a global field.Footnote 2 Business historians have more rarely engaged with the recent work of political and intellectual historians, but as the history of the scenario tool shows, there is important overlap here.Footnote 3 Starting from the mid-1960s, MNEs began to see themselves as global actors on a par with nation-states and international organizations. As such, they perceived themselves as sharing the responsibility for ordering world economic relations and creating a world society in which MNEs could prosper. As Shell demonstrated, corporations came out of this period with a partly new identity as active agents in not only the economic but also the political and cultural processes of managing globalization. By discussing the history of the scenarios, this article revisits existing understandings of the multinational as a producer of ideas of global space and as co-constitutive of emerging visions of capitalism after 1973.\n\nThe scenario tool was key in Shell's attempt to meet the challenges of the period from 1967 to 1976 with a strategy that partly changed views on the future of global oil. The scenarios were not simply new management techniques for a given future objective; they were large narrative exercises that can be seen as attempts to conjure entire new capitalist worlds. MNE historians have considered the period from World War I until 1979 as the era of deglobalization, during which nationalist and protectionist responses to crises obstructed the mobility of capital.Footnote 4 This is a historiography written largely from the viewpoint of multinationals and from a concern with business vitality and entrepreneurship. In political and intellectual history, the 1967-to-1976 moment is understood quite differently. The period from the mid-1960s on saw the breakup of essentially colonial legacies of commodity and monetary arrangements that underpinned postwar economies. To this North-South confrontation came a growing awareness of the conflict between industrial growth and environmental sustainability (although the latter term was not widely used until the 1980s). At the same time, Western industrial societies entered into a period of social turmoil and labor unrest, marking the end of stability in welfare arrangements and industrial relations of the immediate postwar period. This discrepancy between business and political historians in interpretation of the period raises the question of how business actively sought to navigate the end of one world and the dawn of another. The Shell scenarios show that the end of the Fordist era saw several competing visions of the future of global capitalism emerge, but not all were preferential to global oil companies.Footnote 5 The direct relationship between the Third Worldist claim to resource sovereignty, expressed in the New International Economic Order (NIEO) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1974, and the debate that erupted after the publication of the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth report in 1972 is essential to this clash of future visions.Footnote 6 The scenarios were a way for Shell to weigh these different futures, measure the risk they posed, and shape ideas of the proper global society in which it thought it would prosper.\n\nThe scenario archives at the Said Business School in Oxford do not allow the conclusion that Shell actively tried to dismiss or counteract early warnings of climate change (as other oil corporations manifestly did). Nor do they contradict it. In fact, the scenario archives contain almost no mention at all of the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels, which supports the conclusion that the scenarios were not used to discuss atmospheric effects of CO2 until the late 1980s and that their main purpose was not to manage a sustainable transition for oil but to consider a number of deeply problematic futures for the oil industry. Environmental degradation was one factor contributing to a new uncertainty surrounding oil in the 1970s; however, it was not the environmental argument per se but rather the joint challenge of the NIEO and the Limits debate that posed an unprecedented challenge to the world of oil. We know from existing studies that oil companies reacted defensively to NIEO claims of the right to sovereignty over natural resources and that MNEs also responded to the NIEO by creating new lobby organizations, restructuring channels of influence to policymakers, and attempting to reassert their power over pricing systems.Footnote 7 Studies also show that multinational corporations mobilized during the same period against what they perceived as a new kind of statist interventionism in Western governments.Footnote 8 Some of this mobilization was clearly about the active production of doubt around early indications of climate change, as shown in studies of Exxon and BP.Footnote 9 But business reacted to perceived risk in many other ways, and the production of doubt was not the scenarios’ main role.Footnote 10 At the same time, there is no evidence in the scenario archives that the main purpose of the scenarios was to help Shell become an environmentally sustainable or socially responsible corporation, which is how the scenarios have been showcased in company historiography and important parts of the management literature.Footnote 11 The corporate history of Shell, written by economic historians on Shell's payroll, arguably helped turn the scenarios into something of a global brand. While critical elements were not missing from this official history, they were downplayed in favor of a dominant narrative that the oil corporation came of age as environmentally and socially sustainable during the period from the 1970s on.Footnote 12 It is clear from the scenarios that Shell used the scenario tool in relation to environmental challenges from the 1970s on, but the challenge identified in the scenarios was not environmental degradation; rather, it was the contestation around environmental effects in both Western localities and the sites of extraction. Thus, the history of the scenario tool within Shell is in fact much different from how it has been presented in the literature.Footnote 13\n\nThe corporate environmentalism literature has indeed come to the conclusion that studying the gradual turn to a sustainable agenda in the 1980s and 1990s as part of a business acceptance of its environmental impact may not be sufficient, since this fails to account for the continued expansion of fossil fuels in the same period. A paradox is thus raised, for instance by Ann-Kristin Bergquist in a recent lead article in Business History Review. Bergquist proposes that the rise of corporate environmentalism coincides in time with the Great Acceleration—in other words, with the manifold increase in CO2 emissions beginning in the 1970s. This raises questions as to why business did not do more.Footnote 14 But the literature mentioned here provides clues toward something that is quite different from inertia, namely, that business reacted against risks in the global environment by strategically acting to influence more desirable global environments. Inertia can be a form of strategic behavior, as can the active production of doubt, but the scenarios show yet another strategy: the attempt to move beyond problematic visions of the limits of natural resources by projecting visions that go far beyond such limits. The common denominator between Third Worldism and environmentalism was indeed the idea of limits, coming together in the 1967 claim by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that oil was a limited resource and that its increasing value should be reflected in pricing. While the history of the scenarios does not permit us to say that Shell rejected evidence of climate change, it does permit the conclusion that scenarios became relevant to Shell in the context of the double whammy of the oil crisis and the limits debate, because their narrative structure allowed scenarists to project images of a future beyond limits. Previous work on the use of scenarios by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the same period shows that the OECD also embraced scenarios as part of a discourse of rejecting the idea of physical limits and exploring economic futures driven by innovation and potential.Footnote 15 Scenarios were transnational artifacts that circulated in a field between international organizations, multinational corporations, and national planning commissions. The Shell scenarios, already in the early 1970s, became understood in this field as a pioneering exercise. As will be shown, a key element in the scenarios was the representation of Shell as embodying a virtuous market interest and even a kind of global common good.\n\nThe argument that follows unfolds in three parts: in the first section, the scenarios are discussed with a term taken from Science and Technology Studies as territorialization techniques directly shaped by the need to manage complex global time-space relations in oil. The second section shows that the scenarios changed a system of oil data and forecasts that had been in place for the large part of the twentieth century and had in fact been inherited from colonial times. The third section examines the scenario processes from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s and explores how what began as an explorative horizon-scan exercise in 1967 developed into a tool for envisioning the futures of global capitalism.\n\nConclusion: Defining the Destiny of Global Capital\n\nThe purpose of this article was to ask a question: Why were scenarios used? It was also to suggest an answer, which insists that while scenarios may well have been used within Shell to discuss environmental concerns or issues of corporate social responsibility, this was not in fact their primary role and it was not for this purpose that scenarios were introduced within Shell. The main role of scenarios was to invent and project new visions of the future territories of oil in a world beyond limits. The impetus behind the Shell scenarios was the realization that the business environment of the 1970s was shaken up by a set of new political factors and that the corporation itself needed to actively shape a future world optimal for its purposes. To the oil majors, the twin challenges of the publication of the Limits to Growth report in 1972 and the embargo of the Arab oil-producing nations in the winter of 1973 introduced a new risk in what they saw as a new wave of political interventionism and threat of global regulation. They reacted with the creation of new think tank and consultancy structures, in which the idea of market coordination and innovation played a key role. Scenarios were an important part of this move. The scenario processes, from 1967 on, had one thing in common: namely, the stereotypical juxtaposition of a world of perfect harmony, organized around a set of virtuous market relations, to a deeply undesirable world of chaos and decline, dominated by state action. In the First World, the multinational corporation represents a common world market interest and an ideal global society. Therefore, the scenarios foster a conception of the international oil company as the custodian of global stability and producer of global values."
