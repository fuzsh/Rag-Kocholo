        "text": "List of famous people who drowned, including photos, birthdates, professions, and other information. These celebrities who drowned are listed alphabetically and include the famous drowning victims’ hometown and biographical info about them when available.\n\nThe list you're viewing is made up of a variety of different people who died by drowning, including singer Whitney Houston, Virginia Woolf, Rajeev Motwani, and Ward Beysen.\n\nThese notable drowning deaths include modern and long-gone famous men and women, from politicians to religious leaders to writers. Everyone on this list has drowning as a cause of death somewhere in their public records, even if it was just one contributing factor for their death.\n\nWhitney Houston, one of the most celebrated vocalists of her time, was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey. Born into a musical family, her mother Cissy Houston, a gospel singer, and cousin Dionne Warwick, an international pop icon, had a significant influence on her early life. Houston's journey into the music industry began at an early age when she started singing in her church choir and performed solo for the first time when she was just 11. Houston's career took off in the mid-1980s after signing with Arista Records. Her self-titled debut album Whitney Houston released in 1985, was a massive success, earning multiple platinum certifications and spawning three No.1 singles. The follow-up album, Whitney, made Houston the first female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 charts. She continued this trend of breaking records and setting new ones throughout her career. Houston also ventured into acting, with her role in The Bodyguard (1992) earning her acclaim. The film's original soundtrack won the 1994 Grammy for Album of the Year, with its lead single I Will Always Love You, becoming one of the best-selling singles in music history. However, Houston's successful career was often overshadowed by her personal struggles. Her tumultuous marriage to Bobby Brown and her battles with substance abuse were widely publicized, leading to a decline in her musical output and health. Despite these challenges, Houston's impact on the music industry is undeniable. Her powerful voice and range set a new benchmark for pop vocal performance, influencing a generation of singers that followed. Whitney Houston passed away on February 11, 2012, but her legacy lives on.\n\nAge : Dec. at 48 (1963-2012)\n\nBirthplace : East Orange, New Jersey, USA\n\nNatalie Wood, born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko on July 20, 1938, was a renowned American actress whose career spanned over four decades, beginning as a child star and continuing into adulthood. Her parents, Russian immigrants, nurtured her passion for acting from a young age. Her first film role was at age four in Happy Land. Wood's captivating performances and undeniable talent quickly catapulted her to Hollywood stardom. Wood's breakthrough came in 1955 when she starred in Rebel Without a Cause alongside James Dean. This role earned Wood her first Academy Award nomination, solidifying her place in Hollywood. She demonstrated her acting prowess through a diverse range of roles in movies like West Side Story and Splendor in the Grass, both films earning her additional Oscar nominations. Despite her success on screen, Wood's life was not without turmoil. Her high-profile relationships and marriages, particularly with actor Robert Wagner, were often the subject of media attention. Tragically, Wood's life was cut short when she drowned off the coast of California's Catalina Island in 1981 under mysterious circumstances. Her untimely death left an indelible mark on Hollywood, sending shockwaves throughout the industry. Despite this tragedy, Natalie Wood's legacy continues to endure. Her remarkable talent, beauty, and unique ability to capture audiences' hearts have secured her place as one of Hollywood's most enduring stars.\n\nAge : Dec. at 43 (1938-1981)\n\nBirthplace : San Francisco, California, USA\n\nJosef Mengele ([ˈjoːzɛf ˈmɛŋələ] (listen); 16 March 1911 – 7 February 1979), also known as the Angel of Death (German: Todesengel) and the White Angel (German: der Weisse Engel or Weißer Engel), was a German Schutzstaffel (SS) officer and physician in Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. He performed deadly human experiments on prisoners and was a member of the team of doctors who selected victims to be killed in the gas chambers. Arrivals that were judged able to work were admitted into the camp, while those deemed unsuitable for labor were sent to the gas chambers to be killed. With Red Army troops sweeping through Poland, Mengele was transferred 280 kilometers (170 mi) from Auschwitz to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp on 17 January 1945, just ten days before the arrival of the Soviet forces at Auschwitz. After the war, he fled to South America where he evaded capture for the rest of his life. Before the war, Mengele had received doctorates in anthropology and medicine, and began a career as a researcher. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the SS in 1938. He was assigned as a battalion medical officer at the start of World War II, then transferred to the Nazi concentration camps service in early 1943 and assigned to Auschwitz, where he saw the opportunity to conduct genetic research on human subjects. His subsequent experiments focused primarily on twins, with little regard for the health or safety of the victims.Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949, assisted by a network of former SS members. He initially lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960, while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal who wanted to bring him to trial. Mengele eluded capture in spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. He drowned in 1979 after suffering a stroke while swimming off the Brazilian coast, and was buried under the false name Wolfgang Gerhard. Mengele's remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.\n\nAge : Dec. at 67 (1911-1979)\n\nBirthplace : Günzburg, Germany\n\nGrigori Rasputin\n\nGrigori Yefimovich Rasputin (; Russian: Григо́рий Ефи́мович Распу́тин [ɡrʲɪˈɡorʲɪj jɪˈfʲiməvʲɪtɕ rɐˈsputʲɪn]; 22 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869 – 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916) was a Russian mystic and self-proclaimed holy man who befriended the family of Tsar Nicholas II, the last monarch of Russia, and gained considerable influence in late imperial Russia. Born to a peasant family in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye, Tobolsk governorate (now Tyumen oblast), Rasputin had a religious conversion experience after taking a pilgrimage to a monastery in 1897. He has been described as a monk or as a \"strannik\" (wanderer, or pilgrim), though he held no official position in the Russian Orthodox Church. After traveling to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or the winter of 1904–05, Rasputin captivated some church and social leaders. He became a society figure, and met the Tsar in November 1905. In late 1906, Rasputin began acting as a healer for Alexei, the Tsar and his wife Alexandra's only son, who suffered from hemophilia. At court, he was a divisive figure, seen by some Russians as a mystic, visionary, and prophet, and by others as a religious charlatan. The high point of Rasputin's power was in 1915, when Nicholas II left St. Petersburg to oversee Russian armies fighting World War I, increasing both Alexandra and Rasputin's influence. As Russian defeats in the war mounted, however, both Rasputin and Alexandra became increasingly unpopular. In the early morning of 30 December [O.S. 17 December] 1916, Rasputin was assassinated by a group of conservative noblemen who opposed his influence over Alexandra and the Tsar. Historians often suggest that Rasputin's terrible reputation helped discredit the tsarist government, and thus helped precipitate the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty, which happened a few weeks after he was assassinated. Accounts of his life and influence were often based on hearsay and rumor.\n\nAge : Dec. at 47 (1869-1916)\n\nBirthplace : Russia, Pokrovskoye\n\nAdeline Virginia Woolf (; née Stephen; 25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was an English writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and also a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device. Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child in a blended family of eight. Her mother, Julia Prinsep Jackson, celebrated as a Pre-Raphaelite artist's model, had three children from her first marriage, while Woolf's father, Leslie Stephen, a notable man of letters, had one previous daughter. The Stephens produced another four children, including the modernist painter Vanessa Bell. While the boys in the family received college educations, the girls were home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature. An important influence in Virginia Woolf's early life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy Lighthouse, which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927). Woolf's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental breakdown, followed two years later by the death of her stepsister and a mother figure to her, Stella Duckworth. From 1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied classics and history and came into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the women's rights movement. Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her father's vast library. Encouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. Her father's death in 1905 caused another mental breakdown for Woolf. Following his death, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the more bohemian Bloomsbury, where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle. It was in Bloomsbury where, in conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group. Following her 1912 marriage to Leonard Woolf, the couple founded the Hogarth Press in 1917, which published much of her work. The couple rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by her mental illness. She was institutionalized several times and attempted suicide at least twice. Her illness is considered to have been bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective intervention during her lifetime. At age 59, Woolf committed suicide in 1941 by putting rocks in her coat pockets and drowning herself in the River Ouse. During the interwar period, Woolf was an important part of London's literary and artistic society. In 1915 she published her first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother's publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and Orlando (1928). She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One's Own (1929), in which she wrote the much-quoted dictum, \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\" Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have since garnered much attention and widespread commentary for \"inspiring feminism.\" Her works have been translated into more than 50 languages. A large body of literature is dedicated to her life and work, and she has been the subject of plays, novels and films. Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London.\n\nAge : Dec. at 59 (1882-1941)\n\nBirthplace : Kensington, London, United Kingdom\n\nJeff Buckley, born Jeffrey Scott Buckley on November 17, 1966, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his ethereal singing voice and eclectic musical style. A native of Anaheim, California, Buckley was the son of Tim Buckley, a similarly influential musician. Despite his father's fame, Buckley Jr. only met him once, a fact that shaped his life and music. His musical journey began in earnest after moving to New York City in the early 1990s, where he performed at the East Village coffee shop Sin-é. These performances, intimate and raw, quickly gained him a devoted following, and laid the groundwork for his debut album. Grace, released in 1994, was met with critical acclaim, showcasing Buckley's soaring tenor voice and talent for genre-blending, from rock and jazz to blues and folk. Despite its initial commercial underperformance, Grace has since been recognized as a seminal album of the '90s, with Rolling Stone magazine ranking it among the 500 greatest albums of all time. Buckley's promising career was tragically cut short when he drowned during a spontaneous swim in the Mississippi River in 1997. His second album, Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk, was posthumously released in 1998, featuring tracks Buckley had been working on before his death. Despite his brief career, Buckley's influence has been enduring. His version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah remains one of his most beloved performances, a testament to a talent taken too soon. Buckley's legacy continues to inspire artists across genres, a testament to his unique voice and timeless music.\n\nAge : Dec. at 30 (1966-1997)\n\nBirthplace : USA, California, Anaheim"
