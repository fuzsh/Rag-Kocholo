        "text": "'An excellent study, part reference book, part analytical study which gives a panoramic view of the state of Social Democracy in Europe, its national paradigms, its transnational efforts, and European challenges. While presenting the information in an accessible format, the authors demonstrate their own awareness of the theoretical issues involved in both comparative politics and integration theory, as well as gathering together information which is often difficult to come by and disparate. This volume could set a trend in books of this kind, dealing with Christian Democracy, Liberalism, and so on.' - John Gaffney, Professor of French and European Politics French Studies, Keele University\n\n'A highly useful compendium on the development and performance of European social democratic parties at the end of the millennium written by a team of political scientists who are experts on the parties. What is particularly attractive is that all authors address an identical set of issues, such as the development of party membership and organization. This permits readers to compare parties across countries and let their theoretical imagination be stimulated by differences and similarities among the various parties' trajectories of change.' - Herbert Kitschelt, Department of Political Science, Duke University, Durham\n\n'This is a highly commendable book that fills an obvious gap in the literature...a timely, extensive and accessible overview of the EU's most important party family.' - Alisatir Cole, Party Politics"
