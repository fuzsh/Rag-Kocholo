        "text": "The Unofficial Book of Political Lists\n\nBy Iain Dale\n\n******************************\n\nFor Sheena & Tracey\n\n*******************************\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMost people think of political reference books as either dead boring or prohibitively expensive. Hopefully this is neither - but then again it is rather more than a reference book. Where in Dod’s Parliamentary Companion could the reader find the Top Ten Political Chat-Up Lines alongside a List of Prime Ministers Since 1721? So this book is all about information and fun - two words not always associated with political life.\n\nIt is easy to be sceptical of politicians and to believe that they’re all the same and are only in politics for what they can get out of it. The truth is somewhat more simple. Our politicians reflect the society in which we live. Proportionately there are no more crooked politicians than there are crooked bank managers (perhaps a poor comparison, but there you go!). Politicians are no more likely to sleep around than journalists, although one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Generally speaking, politicians of all parties are honourable people who genuinely wish to improve the life of the people, while continuously disagreeing with each other about how to go about it. But that’s democracy. And that’s what this book is all about. Where else but in a true democracy could you read in a book the Top Ten Politicians Gay Men Find Attractive?\n\nThe most difficult part of writing and compiling this book has been to put the 300 lists into a logical and easily accessible order. I have decided to divide it up into eight sections, finishing with the humourous bit! However, in order for the reader not to become submerged by fact and information there is also a scattering of “unofficial” lists throughout the book - easily recognisable by the stamp which appears on the page.\n\nI hope this book gives you as much enjoyment reading it, as it gave me to compile.\n\nIain Dale\n\nAugust 1997\n\nContents\n\nPart 1 Parliament & Government\n\nPart 2 Elections &

£100 of MPs’ salaries made tax exempt in lieu of expenses. This remained the case until 1954.\n\n1924 MPs allowed free rail travel between London and their constituencies\n\n1931 Salaries are cut to £360 as an austerity measure\n\n1934 Salary restored to £380 and then to £400.\n\n1937 MPs are awarded a 50% pay rise taking their salaries to £600 pa.\n\n1946 Salaries are increased to £1,000. Free travel allowed also between MPs’ homes and Westminster.\n\n1953 A sessional allowance of £2 per sitting day (except Fridays) was introduced.\n\n1957 The sessional allowance was replaced by an annual expense allowance of £750. Although the £1000 salary and the £750 expense allowance were taxable, MPs were allowed to claim as tax free any expenses up to £1,750 incurred in respect of their parliamentary duties.\n\n1964 Following a report by the Lawrence Committee salaries were increased to £3,250.\n\n1965 The Members’ Pensions Act was passed introducing a comprehensive scheme for MPs and their families. MPs were to contribute £150 pa, as would the Exchequer.\n\n1969 A secretarial allowance of £500 was introduced and MPs were allowed free phone calls within the UK.\n\n1972 Salaries were increased to £3,500 following the Boyle Committee Report and the secretarial allowance was doubled to £1,000. A further allowance of £750 pa was granted to those MPs living outside London for extra living expenses, while London based MPs were granted an extra £175 pa. Travel allowances were extended and a termination grant equal to three months pay was introduced for MPs who lose their seats at elections.\n\n1972 Improved pension scheme was introduced.\n\n1974 Secretarial allowance rose by 75% to £1,750 and the living outside London allowance was raised to £1,050. The London supplement was upped to £228 pa.\n\n1976 Further improvements in the pension scheme.\n\n1977 Salary increased to £6,270 while secretarial allowances increased to £3,687.

They only vote for us because they think we are right.”\n\nPeter Lilley\n\n“In the Conservative Party we have no truck with outmoded Marxist doctrine about class warfare. For us it is not who you are, who your family is or where you come from that matters, but what you are and what you can do for your country that counts.”\n\nMargaret Thatcher\n\n“A liberal conservative is a man who thinks things out to progress but would rather they remained as they are”\n\nFitzjames Stephens\n\n“A Conservative Government is an organised hypocrisy.”\n\nBenjamin Disraeli\n\n“What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and the untried.”\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n“There is always a certain meanness in the argument of conservatism, joined with a certain superiority in its fact.”\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\n“Nothings commends a radical change to an Englishman more than the belief that it is really conservative.”\n\nH A L Fisher\n\nTop Ten Quotes on Socialism\n\n“An extreme Socialist is one who wants to abolish Public Schools tomorrow. A moderate Socialist wants to abolish them after his children have finished going there.”\n\nNorman Tebbit\n\n“I sometimes think the Labour Party is like a pub where the mild is running out. If someone does not do something soon, all that is left will be bitter and all that is bitter will be left.”\n\nMargaret Thatcher\n\n“As with the Christian religion, the worst advert for socialism is its adherents.”\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\n“I haven’t read Karl Marx. I got stuck on the footnote on page two.”\n\nHarold Wilson\n\n“Socialism is nothing but the capitalism of the lower classes.”\n\nOswald Spengler\n\n“As far as socialism means anything, it must be about the wider distribution of smoked salmon and caviar.”\n\nRichard Marsh\n\n“The term ‘democratic socialist’ makes as much sense as ‘pregnant virginity’.”\n\nRussell Prowse, Australian Industrialist\n\n“Democracy and socialism are means to an end, not the end itself.”\n\nJawaharlal Nehru\n\n“The typical Socialist is...a prim little man with a white collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with a social position which he has no intention of forfeitting.”\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\n“Socialism is nothing but the capitalism of the working class”\n\nOswald Sprengler\n\nTop Ten Liberal Quotes\n\n“We all know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run over.”\n\nAneurin Bevan\n\n“The trouble with many Liberals is that they talk a lot of cock.”\n\nCyril Smith, Former Liberal MP\n\n“Liberal - worshipper of power without power.”\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\n“If God had been a Liberal there would not have been ten commandments, there would have been ten suggestions.”\n\nMalcolm Bradbury, Author\n\n“The closest thing to a Tory in disguise is a Whig in power.”\n\nBenjamin Disraeli\n\n“A Liberal is a man who leaves a room before the fight begins.”\n\nHeywood Broun\n\n“A Liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel.”\n\nRobert Frost\n\n“I have the good fortune to be the first Liberal leader for half a century who is able to say at the end of our general assembly: go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.”\n\nDavid Steel in 1981\n\n“A Radical is a man with both feet firmly planted - in the air. A Conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward. A Reactionary is a somnambulist walking backwards. A Liberal is a man who uses his legs and his hands at the behest - at the command of his head.”\n\nFranklin D Roosevelt\n\n“Testators would do well to provide some indication of the particular Liberal Party which they have in mind, such as a telephone number or a Christian name.”\n\nA P Herbert\n\nTop Ten Quotes on Political Power\n\n“Whenever a man has cast a longing eye on offices, a rottenness begins in his conduct”\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\n“I have no ambition to gov"
