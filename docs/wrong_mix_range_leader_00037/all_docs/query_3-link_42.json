        "text": "a or the see grammar and syntax.\n\nabbreviations\n\nWrite words in their full form on first appearance:\n\nTrades Union Congress (not TUC), Troubled Asset Relief Programme (not TARP)\n\nunless an abbreviation or acronym is so familiar that it is used more often in full:\n\nAIDS BBC CIA EU FBI HIV IMF NASA NATO NGO OECD UNESCO\n\nor unless the full form would provide little illumination — AWACS, DNA. If in doubt about its familiarity, explain what the organisation is or does. After the first mention, try not to repeat the abbreviation too often; so write the agency rather than the IAEA, the party rather than the KMT, to avoid spattering the page with capital letters. And prefer chief executive, boss or manager to CEO.\n\nThere is no need to give the initials of an organisation if it is not referred to again. This clutters both the page and the brain.\n\nDo not use spatterings of abbreviations and acronyms simply in order to cram more words in; you will end up irritating readers rather than informing them. An article in a recent issue of The Economist contained the following:\n\nCIA DCI DNI DOD DVD FBI NCTC NSA\n\nSome of these are well known to most readers and can readily be held in the mind. But unfamiliar abbreviations may oblige the reader to constantly refer back to the first use.\n\nampersands should be used:\n\n1 when they are part of the name of a company: Procter & Gamble Pratt & Whitney\n\n2 for such things as constituencies, where two names are linked to form one unit:\n\nThe rest of Brighouse & Spenborough joins with the Batley part of Batley & Morley to form Batley & Spen.\n\nThe area thus became the Pakistani province of Kashmir and the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir.\n\n3 in R&D and S&1.\n\ncompass references/readings should be given as 40°N, etc.\n\ndefinite article If an abbreviation can be pronounced — COSATU, NATO, UNESCO — it does not generally require the definite article. Other organisations, except companies, should usually be preceded by the: the BBC the KGB the NHS the NIESR the UNHCR\n\nelements\n\nDo not sprinkle chemical symbols unnecessarily: they may put readers off. But common abbreviations such as CO2 may sometimes be used for variety.\n\nDifferent isotopes of the same element are distinguished by raised (superscript) prefixes:\n\ncarbon-14 is 14C\n\nhelium-3 is 3He\n\ninitials in people’s and companies’ names take points (with a space between initials and name, but not between initials). In general, follow the practice preferred by people, companies and organisations in writing their own names, for example: I.M. Pei J.C. Penney J. Sainsbury A.N. Wilson\n\njunior and senior Spell out in full (and lower case) junior and senior after a name:\n\nDouglas Fairbanks junior Douglas Fairbanks senior\n\nlower case Abbreviate:\n\nkilograms (not kilogrammes) to kg (or kilos)\n\nkilometres per hour to kph\n\nkilometres to km\n\nmiles per hour to mph\n\nUse m for million, bn for billion and trn for trillion.\n\nUse lower case for kg, km, lb (never lbs), mph and other measures, and for ie, eg; ie should be followed by a comma. When used with figures, these lower-case abbreviations should follow immediately, with no space:\n\n11am 4.30pm 15kg 35mm 100mph 78rpm\n\nTwo abbreviations together, however, must be separated: 60m b/d. Use b/d not bpd as an abbreviation for barrels per day.\n\nMPs Except in British contexts, use MP only after first spelling out member of Parliament in full (in many places an MP is a military policeman).\n\nMembers of the European Parliament are MEPs (not Euro-MPs).\n\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament are MSPs.\n\nMembers of the Welsh Assembly are AMs (Assembly Members).\n\norganisations\n\nEFTA is the European Free Trade Association.\n\nThe FAO is the Food and Agriculture Organisation.\n\nThe FDA is the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe IDA is the International Development Association.\n\nNAFTA is the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n\nThe PLO is the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\n\npronounceable abbreviations\n\nAbbreviations that can be pronounced and are composed of bits of words rather than just initials should be spelt out in upper and lower case:\n\nCocom\n\nNepad\n\nUnicef\n\nMercosur\n\nRenamo\n\nUnprofor\n\nThere is generally no need for more than one initial capital letter, unless the word is a name: ConsGold, KwaZulu, McKay, MiG.\n\nOK (supposedly an abbreviation for “Oll Correct”) is spelled thus, and is not okay when spelled thus.\n\nranks and titles Do not use Prof, Sen, Col, etc. Lieut-Colonel and Lieut-Commander are permissible. (These should be Commander and Colonel on second mention.) Rev is also permissible, but it must be preceded by the and followed by a Christian name or initial: the Rev Jesse Jackson (thereafter Mr Jackson).\n\nscientific units named after individuals Scientific units, except those of temperature, that are named after individuals are not capitalised when written out in full: watt, joule, etc. When abbreviated these units should be set in capitals, though any attachments denoting multiples go in lower case:\n\nwatt is W\n\nkilowatt, 1,000 watts, is kW\n\nmilliwatt, one-thousandth of a watt, is mW\n\nmegawatt, 1m watts, is MW\n\ngigawatt, 1 bn (109) watts, is GW\n\nterawatt, 1 trn (1012) watts, is TW\n\npetawatt, 1 quadrillion (1015) watts, is PW\n\nmegahertz is MHZ\n\nwriting out upper-case abbreviations Most upper-case abbreviations are shortenings of proper names with initial capital letters. The LSO is the London Symphony Orchestra. However, there are exceptions:\n\nCAP but common agricultural policy\n\nEMU but economic and monetary union\n\nGDP but gross domestic product\n\nPSBR but public-sector borrowing requirement\n\nVLSI but very large-scale integration\n\nmiscellaneous Spell out:\n\npage pages hectares miles\n\nDo not spell out Centigrade, and do not use Fahrenheit for temperature.\n\nRemember, too, that the V of HIV stands for virus, so do not write\n\nHIV virus. Similarly the D of DAB stands for digital, so do not write DAB digital radio.\n\nSee measures in Part 3.\n\nabsent In Latin absent is a verb meaning they are away. In English it is either an adjective (absent friends) or a verb (to absent yourself). Avoid the American habit of using it as a preposition meaning in the absence of.\n\naccents On words now accepted as English, use accents only when they make a crucial difference to pronunciation: café cliché communiqué éclat exposé façade soupçon But: chateau decor elite feted naive\n\nThe main accents and diacritical signs are:\n\ncute\n\nrépublique\n\ngrave\n\ngrand-mère\n\ncircumflex\n\nbête noire\n\numlaut\n\nLänder, Österreich (Austria)\n\ncedilla\n\nfrançais\n\ntilde\n\nseñor, São Paulo\n\nIf you use one accent (except the tilde — strictly, a diacritical sign), use all:\n\némigré mêlée protégé résumé\n\nPut the accents and diacritical signs on French, German, Spanish and Portuguese names and words only:\n\nJosé Manuel Barroso\n\ncafèzinho\n\nFederico Peña\n\ncoñac\n\nFrançoise de Panafieu\n\ndéjeuner\n\nWolfgang Schäuble\n\nFrühstück\n\nAny foreign word in italics should, however, be given its proper accents. See also italics.\n\nacronym A pronounceable word, formed from the initials of other words, like radar, nimby or NATO. It is not a set of initials, like the BBC or the IMF.\n\nactionable means giving ground for a lawsuit. Do not use it to mean susceptible of being put into practice: prefer practical or practicable. Do not use action as a verb.\n\nadjectives and adverbs see grammar and syntax, punctuation.\n\nadjectives of proper nouns see grammar and syntax, punctuation.\n\naddress What did journalists and politicians do in the days, not so long ago, when address was used as a verb only before objects such as audience, letter, ball, haggis and, occasionally, themselves? Questions can be answered, issues discussed, problems solved, difficulties dealt with. See clichés.\n\naetiology, etiolate Aetiology is the science of causation, or an inquiry into something’s origins. Etiolate is to make or become pale for lack of light.\n\naffect (verb) means to have an influence on, as in the novel affected his attitude to immigrants. See also effect.\n\naffirmative action is a euphemism with little to be said for it. It is too late to suppress it altogether, but try to avoid it as much as possible. If you cannot escape it, put it in quotation marks on first mention and, unless the context makes its meaning clear, explain what it is. You may, however, find that preferential treatment, job preferment or even discrimination serve just as well as alternatives. See euphemisms.\n\naffordable By whom? Avoid affordable housing, affordable computers and other unthinking uses of advertising lingo.\n\nAfghan names see names.\n\naggravate means make worse, not irritate or annoy.\n\naggression is an unattractive quality, so do not call a keen salesman an aggressive one (unless his foot is in the door).\n\nagony column Remember that when Sherlock Holmes perused this, it was a personal column. Only recently has it come to mean letters to an agony aunt.\n\nagree Things are agreed on, to or about, not just agreed. See transitive and intransitive verbs.\n\naircraft see hyphens and italics.\n\nalibi An alibi is the fact of being elsewhere, not a false explanation.\n\nalternate, alternative Alternate (as an adjective) means every other. As a noun, it has now come to mean a stand-in for a director or delegate. Alternative (as a noun), strictly, means one of two, not one of three, four, five or more (which may be options). As an adjective, alternative means of two (or, loosely, more) things, or possible as an alternative.\n\nAmericanisms\n\nSee Part 2, on British and American usage. To the points made there might be added the following preferred usages in British English (and in The Economist):\n\nand not additionally\n\nthe army not the military (noun)\n\ncar not automobile\n\ncompany not corporation\n\ncourt not courtroom or courthouse\n\ndistrict not neighborhood\n\nnormality not normalcy\n\noblige not obligate\n\nrocket not skyrocket\n\nBack-formations are common in English, so curate, the verb meaning organise or superintend exhibitions of pictures, sculptures and so on formed from curator, is now acceptable in British English. But it is still too soon for gallerist (prefer dealer or, if appropriate, just gallery).\n\nadverbs Put adverbs where you would put them in normal English speech, which is usually after the verb (not before it, which usually is where Americans put them).\n\navoid nouning adjectives Do not noun adjectives such as:\n\nadvisory — prefer warning\n\ncentennial — prefer centenary\n\ninaugural — prefer inauguration\n\navoid verbing and adjectiving nouns Try not to verb nouns or to adjective them. So do not:\n\naccess files (except electronically)\n\naction proposals\n\nauthor books (still less co-author them)\n\ncritique style guides\n\ngun someone down; use shoot\n\nhaemorrhage red ink (haemorrhage is a noun)\n\nlet one event impact another (try affect)\n\nloan money, still less gift it\n\npressure colleagues (press will do)\n\nprogress reports, or reference them\n\nsource inputs\n\nsummit a hill\n\ntrial programmes\n\nSee transitive and intransitive verbs.\n\nAvoid parenting (or using the word) and parenting skills. (See also grammar and syntax.)\n\nThough it is sometimes necessary to use nouns as adjectives, do not call:\n\nan attempted coup a coup attempt\n\na suspected terrorist a terrorist suspect\n\nthe Californian legislature the California legislature\n\nAnd avoid throwing together several nouns into one adjectival reticule:\n\nTexas millionaire real-estate developer and failed thrift entrepreneur Hiram Turnipseed …\n\ncoining words Avoid coining verbs and adjectives unnecessarily. Instead of:\n\ndining experiences and writing experiences, use dining and writing; downplaying criticism, you can play it down (or perhaps minimise it); upcoming and ongoing use forthcoming and continuing.\n\nWhy outfit your children when you can fit them out?\n\nHosting has now entered the language (often to mean acting as host at an event paid for by someone else, otherwise giving would be the right word), but guesting (appearing as a guest on a programme) should be kept at bay, as should gifting.\n\noveruse of American words Do not feel obliged to follow American usage with such words as:\n\nconstituency — try supporters\n\ngubernatorial — try governor’s\n\nperception — try belief or view\n\nrhetoric (of which there is too little, not too much) — try language or speeches or exaggeration if that is what you mean\n\nNote that in British usage:\n\nCity centres are not central cities.\n\nCompanies: call for a record profit if you wish to exhort the workers, but not if you merely predict one. And do not post it if it has been achieved. If it has not, look for someone new to head, not head up, the company.\n\nCountries, nations and states: London is the country’s capital, not the nation’s. If you wish to build a nation, you will bind its peoples together; if you wish to build a state, you will forge its institutions. Deep: make a deep study or even a study in depth, but not an in-depth study.\n\nGrow a beard or a tomato, but not a company (or indeed a salesman: the Financial Times reported on August 8th 2003 that BMW was “to grow its own car salesmen”).\n\nDo not use likely to mean probably.\n\nOn-site inspections are allowed, but not on-train teams or in-ear headphones.\n\nStay outside the door, not outside of it.\n\nProgramme: you may program a computer, but in all other contexts the word is programme.\n\nUse power cut or blackout rather than outage.\n\nKeep a promise, rather than deliver on it.\n\nRaise cattle and pigs, but children are (or should be) brought up. Regular is not a synonym for ordinary or normal: Mussolini brought in the regular train, All-Bran the regular man; it is quite normal to be without either.\n\nA religious group sounds better than a faith-based organisation. Do not task people, or meet with them.\n\nThrow stones, not rocks.\n\nTrains run from railway stations, not train stations. The people in them, and on buses, are passengers, not riders.\n\nUse senior rather than ranking.\n\nAnd only the speechless are dumb and the insane mad.\n\ntenses Choose tenses according to British usage, too. In particular, do not fight shy of the perfect tense, especially where no date or time is given. Thus:\n\nMr Obama has woken up to the danger is preferable to Mr Obama woke up to the danger, unless you can add last week or when he heard the explosion.\n\nDo not write Your salary just got smaller or I shrunk the kids. In British English Your salary has just got smaller and I’ve shrunk the kids.\n\nSee also adjectives of proper nouns, euphemisms, grammar and syntax, and Part 2.\n\namong and between Some sticklers insist that, where division is involved, among should be used where three or more are concerned, between where only two are concerned. So: The plum jobs were shared among the Socialists, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, while the president and the vice-president divided the cash between themselves.\n\nThis distinction is unnecessary. But take care with between. To fall between two stools, however painful, is grammatically acceptable; to fall between the cracks is to challenge the laws of physics.\n\nPrefer among to amongst, as while to whilst.\n\nan should be used before a word beginning with a vowel sound (an egg, an umbrella, an MP) or an h if, and only if, the h is silent (an honorary degree). But a European, a university, a U-turn, a hospital, a hotel. Historical and historian are preceded by a whether or not you treat the has silent.\n\nanarchy means the complete absence of law or government. It may be harmonious or chaotic.\n\nanimals For the spelling of the Latin names of animals, plants, etc, see Latin names.\n\nannus horribilis, annus mirabilis Annus horribilis is often used, presumably in contrast to annus mirabilis, to describe an awful year, for example by Queen Elizabeth in 1992 (the year of her daughter’s divorce, the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York and a fire at Windsor Castle). It serves its purpose well, but it should be noted that annus mirabilis originally meant much the same thing: 1666, of which it was first used, was the year of the great fire of London and the second year of the great plague in England. Physicists, however, have used the term to describe 1932, the year in which the neutron was discovered, the positron identified and the atomic nucleus first broken up artificially.\n\nanon means soon, though it once meant straight away. Presently also means soon, though it is increasingly misused to mean now. (See also presently.)\n\nanticipate does not mean expect. It means to forestall or look forward to. Jack and Jill expected to marry; if they anticipated marriage, only Jill might find herself expectant.\n\napostasy, blasphemy, heresy If you abandon your religion, you commit apostasy. If that religion is the prevailing one in your community and your beliefs are contrary to its orthodoxy, you commit heresy. Blasphemy is offending by word or deed against the prevailing orthodoxy.\n\napostrophes see punctuation.\n\nappeal is intransitive nowadays (except in America), so appeal against decisions.\n\nappraise means set a price on. Apprise means inform.\n\nArabic The Arabic alphabet has several consonants that have no exact equivalents in English: for example, two kinds of s, two kinds of t, two different (one vocalised, the other not) th sounds. Moreover, there are three sounds: a glottal stop like a hiccup, a glottal sound harsher than this and a uvular trill. Ultra-fastidious transliterators try to reproduce these subtleties with a profusion of apostrophes and hs which yield spellings like Mu’ammar al-Qadhdhafi. The risk of error and the sheer ugliness on the page are too great to justify the effort, so usually ignore the differences.\n\nVowels present a lesser problem. There are only three — a, u, i — but each can be lengthened. Do not bother to differentiate between the short and the long a. Occasionally, a spelling is established where the u has been lengthened by using oo, as in Sultan Qaboos. In such instances, follow that convention, but in general go for ou, as in murabitoun or Ibn Khaldoun. The long Arabic i is almost always an i in Roman letters.\n\nMuhammad is the correct spelling unless it is part of the name of someone who spells it differently. (See also names.)\n\nas of say, April 5th or April. Prefer on (or after, or since) April 5th, in April.\n\nassassinate is, properly, the term used not just for any old killing, but for the murder of a prominent person, usually for a political purpose. (See execute.)\n\nas to There is usually a more appropriate preposition, eg about. Or rewrite the sentence.\n\nautarchy, autarky Autarchy means absolute sovereignty. Autarky means self-sufficiency.\n\navert, avoid, evade To avert something means to head it off. To avoid it means to keep away from it. To evade it means to elude it or escape it artfully. Tax avoidance is legal; tax evasion is not.\n\navocation An avocation is a distraction or diversion from your ordinary employment, not a synonym for vocation.\n\nbail, bale In the hayfield, bale; otherwise bail, bail out and bail-out (noun).\n\nBangladeshi names see names.\n\n-based A Paris-based group may be all right, if, say, that group operates abroad (otherwise just say a group in Paris). But avoid community-based, faith-based, knowledge-based, etc. A community-based organisation is perhaps a community organisation; a faith-based organisation is probably a church; a knowledge-based industry needs explanation: all industries depend on knowledge.\n\nbeg the question means neither raise the question, invite the question nor evade the answer. To beg the question is to adopt an argument whose conclusion depends upon assuming the truth of the very conclusion the argument is designed to produce.\n\nAll governments should promote free trade because otherwise protectionism will increase. This begs the question.\n\nBelarusian names see names.\n\nbellwether This is the leading sheep of a flock, on whose neck a bell is hung. It has nothing to do with climate, prevailing winds or the like, but the term is used in the stockmarket.\n\nbetween see among and between.\n\nbiannual, biennial Biannual can mean twice a year or once every two years. Avoid. Since biennial also means once every two years, that is best avoided too. So are bimonthly and biweekly, which also have two meanings. Luckily, fortnightly is unambiguous.\n\nbicentennial Prefer bicentenary (as a noun).\n\nblack In the black means in profit in Britain, but making losses in some places. Use in profit.\n\nblond, blonde Blond is an adjective and, unusually, in its adjectival use it retains its two genders (see grammar and syntax, masculine or feminine). Use blonde as a noun, referring to a woman with blond hair: the blonde in the corner of the room. Use blond for everything else, including the hair of a blonde.\n\nblooded, bloodied Blooded means pedigreed (as in blue-blooded) or initiated. Bloodied means wounded.\n\nbon vivant not bon viveur.\n\nborn, borne are both past participles of the verb bear. Born is used in the sense of giving birth: She was born in April. Borne is used for supporting or putting up with (The victims had borne enough pain) and for giving birth in active constructions (She had already borne six children).\n\nboth … and A preposition placed after both should be repeated after and. Thus both to right and to left; but to both right and left is all right.\n\nbrackets see punctuation.\n\nBritish titles see titles.\n\nbrokerage is what a stockbroking firm does, not what it is.\n\ncadre Keep this word for the framework of a military unit or the officers of such a unit, not for a communist functionary.\n\ncalibres see hyphens.\n\nCambodian names see names.\n\nCanute’s exercise on the seashore was designed to persuade his courtiers of what he knew to be true but they doubted, ie, that he was not omnipotent. Don’t imply he was surprised to get his feet wet.\n\ncapitals A balance has to be struck between so many capitals that the eyes dance and so few that the reader is diverted more by our style than by our substance. The general rule is to dignify with capital letters organisations and institutions, but not people; and full names, but not informal ones. More exact rules are laid out below. Even these, however, leave some decisions to individual judgment. If in doubt use lower case unless it looks absurd. And remember that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds” (Ralph Waldo Emerson).\n\navoiding confusion Use capitals to avoid confusion, especially with no (and therefore yes). In Bergen no votes predominated suggests a stalemate, whereas In Bergen No votes predominated suggests a triumph of noes over yeses. In most contexts, though, yes and no should be lower case: “The answer is no.”\n\nIn the context of the British referendum of 2016, Remain and Leave are upper case. “He voted Leave, but the Remain faction kept going.”\n\ncities City with a capital, even though City is not an integral part of their names:\n\nGuatemala City\n\nNew York City\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\nPanama City\n\nKuwait City\n\nQuebec City\n\nMexico City\n\nCity also takes a capital when it is part of the name:\n\nDodge City\n\nQuezon City\n\nKansas City\n\nSalt Lake City\n\nOklahoma City\n\ncompass points Lower case for:\n\neast west north south\n\nexcept when part of a name (North Korea, South Africa, West End) or part of a thinking group: the South, the Midwest, the West (but lower case for vaguer areas such as the American north-east, northwest, south-east, south-west). Lower-case too for the adjectives: midwestern, western, southern.\n\nThe regions of Africa are southern, east, west and north Africa. But South Africa is the name of the country.\n\nEurope Europe’s divisions are no longer neatly political, and are now geographically imprecise, so use lower case for central, eastern and western Europe.\n\nUse West Germany (West Berlin) and East Germany (East Berlin) only in historical references. They are now west or western Germany (Berlin) and east or eastern Germany (eastern Berlin).\n\nThe Basque country (or region) is ill-defined and contentious, and may include parts of both France and Spain, so lower case for country (or region).\n\nSee also Euro-.\n\nfinance In finance there are particular exceptions to the general rule of initial capitals for full names, lower case for informal ones. There are also rules about what to do on second mention.\n\nDeutschmarks are still known just as D-marks, even though all references are historical.\n\nSpecial drawing rights are lower case but are abbreviated as SDRs, except when used with a figure as a currency (SDR500m).\n\nThe Bank of England and its foreign equivalents have initial caps when named formally and separately, but collectively they are central banks in lower case, except those like Brazil’s, Ireland’s and Venezuela’s, which are actually named the Central Bank. The Bank of England becomes the bank on second mention.\n\nThe IMF may become the fund on second mention.\n\nThe World Bank and the Fed (after first spelling it out as the Federal Reserve) take initial upper case, although these are shortened, informal names. The World Bank becomes the bank on second mention.\n\nTreasury bonds issued by America’s Treasury should be upper case; treasury bills (or bonds) of a general kind should be lower case. Avoid t-bonds and t-bills.\n\nfood and drink Lower case should be used for most common or familiar wines, cheeses, grape varieties, for example:\n\nbarolo\n\ndim sum\n\npiesporter\n\nbordeaux\n\nemmental\n\npinotage\n\nbrunello\n\ngorgonzola\n\npont-l’évêque\n\nburgundy\n\nhock\n\nprimitivo\n\nchampagne\n\nmerlot\n\nrioja\n\nchardonnay\n\nmoselle\n\nsyrah\n\ncheddar\n\nparmesan\n\nzinfandel\n\nBut the proper names of particular wines take upper case: Cheval Blanc Lafite Marqués de Riscal Pontet-Canet\n\nas do some foods and drinks that would look odd lower case: Bombay duck Nuits St George Parma ham\n\nhistorical terms\n\nAllies (in the second world war)\n\nBlack Death\n\nCultural Revolution\n\nD-Day\n\nthe Depression (1930s) Enlightenment\n\nHolocaust (second world war)\n\nIndustrial Revolution\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nNew Deal\n\nProhibition\n\nReconstruction\n\nReformation\n\nRenaissance\n\nRestoration\n\nSix-Day War\n\nStone Age (etc)\n\nThirty Years War\n\nYear of the Dog, Horse, Rat\n\nNote that all other revolutions are lower case, but upper-case for the qualifier: Orange revolution, Green revolution, French revolution.\n\norganisations, institutions, acts, etc\n\n1 Organisations, ministries, departments, institutions, treaties, acts, etc, generally take upper case when their full name (or something pretty close to it, eg, State Department) is used.\n\nAmnesty International\n\nArab League\n\nBank of England (the bank)\n\nCentral Committee\n\nCourt of Appeal\n\nthe Crown (Britain)\n\nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)\n\nDepartment of State (the department)\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nForestry Commission\n\nHealth and Safety at Work Act\n\nHigh Court\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nHousehold Cavalry\n\nMetropolitan Police\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nNew York Stock Exchange\n\nOxford University\n\nPolitburo\n\nScottish Parliament (the parliament)\n\nSenate\n\nSt Paul’s Cathedral (the cathedral)\n\nSupreme Court\n\nTreasury\n\nTreaty of Rome\n\nWelsh Assembly (the assembly)\n\nWorld Bank (the bank)\n\n2 Organisations with unusual or misleading names, such as the African National Congress and Civic Forum, may become the Congress and the Forum on second and subsequent mentions.\n\n3 But most other organisations — agencies, banks, commissions (including the European Commission and the European Union), etc — take lower case when referred to incompletely on second mention.\n\n4 Informal names\n\nOrganisations, committees, commissions, special groups, etc, that are impermanent, ad hoc, local or relatively insignificant should be lower case:\n\ninternational economic subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee;\n\nMarket Blandings rural district council;\n\nOxford University bowls club;\n\nsubcommittee on journalists’ rights of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.\n\n5 Artistic movements\n\nArtistic movements (Impressionism, Cubism, etc) should be upper case. So should their practitioners (Romantics).\n\n6 Rough descriptions or translations\n\nUse lower case for rough descriptions (the safety act, the American health department, the French parliament, as distinct from its National Assembly). If you are not sure whether the English translation of a foreign name is exact or not, assume it is rough and use lower case.\n\n7 Congress and Parliament\n\nCongress and Parliament are upper case, unless parliament is used not to describe the institution but the period of time for which it sits:\n\nThis bill will not be brought forward until the next parliament.\n\nBut congressional and parliamentary are lower case, as is the opposition, even when used in the sense of her majesty’s loyal opposition.\n\nThe government, the administration and the cabinet are always lower case.\n\nAfter first mention, the House of Commons (or Lords, or Representatives) becomes the House.\n\n8 Acts\n\nIn America acts given the names of their sponsors (eg, Glass— Steagall, Helms—Burton) are always rough descriptions (see above) and so take a lower-case act.\n\npeople\n\n1 Ranks and titles\n\nUse upper case when written in conjunction with a name, but lower case when on their own:\n\nColonel Qaddafi, but the colonel\n\nPope Benedict, but the pope\n\nPresident Obama, but the president\n\nQueen Elizabeth, but the queen\n\nVice-President Ansari, but the vice-president\n\nDo not write Prime Minister Brown or Defence Secretary Cannon; they are the prime minister, Mr Brown, and the defence secretary, Mr Cannon. You might, however, write Chancellor Merkel.\n\n2 Office-holders\n\nWhen referred to merely by their office, not by their name, office-holders are lower case:\n\nthe chairman of Marks & Spencer\n\nthe chancellor of the exchequer\n\nthe foreign secretary\n\nthe president of the United States\n\nthe prime minister\n\nthe treasury secretary\n\nThe only exceptions are a few titles that would look unduly peculiar without capitals:\n\nBlack Rod\n\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n\nFirst Lady\n\nLord Chancellor\n\nLord Privy Seal\n\nMaster of the Rolls\n\nSpeaker (in a parliament)\n\nand a few exalted people, such as: the Dalai Lama, the Aga Khan. Also God and the Prophet.\n\n3 Some titles serve as names, and therefore have initial capitals, though they also serve as descriptions: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Emir of Kuwait. If you want to describe the office rather than the individual, use lower case: The next archbishop of Canterbury will be a woman. Since the demise of the ninth duke, there has never been another duke of Portland.\n\nplaces Use upper case for definite geographical places, regions, areas and countries (The Hague, Transylvania, Germany), and for vague but recognised political or geographical areas (but see Europe above):\n\nCentral, South and South-East Asia\n\nEast Asia (which is to be preferred to the Far East) the Gulf\n\nHighlands (of Scotland)\n\nMiddle East\n\nMidlands (of England)\n\nNorth Atlantic\n\nNorth, Central and South America\n\nSouth Atlantic\n\nthe West (as in the decline of the West), Western, Westerns (as in novels, films, etc), Wild West\n\nWest Country\n\nUse capitals for particular buildings even if the name is not strictly accurate, eg, the Foreign Office.\n\nAnd if in doubt use lower case (the sunbelt).\n\nThe third world (an unsatisfactory term now that the communist second world has disappeared) is lower case.\n\nAvoid the western hemisphere. Unlike the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere, it is not clear where the western hemisphere begins or ends. The Americas will usually serve instead.\n\npolitical terms\n\n1 The full name of political parties is upper case, including the word party:\n\nCommunist (if a particular party)\n\nLabour Party\n\nPeasants’ Party\n\nRepublican Party\n\nTea Party (though not strictly a party, it looks too odd in lower case)\n\n2 But note that some parties do not have party as part of their names, so this should therefore be lower case:\n\nGreece’s New Democracy party\n\nIndia’s Congress party\n\nIndonesia’s Golkar party\n\nTurkey’s Justice and Development party\n\n3 Note that usually only people are:\n\nDemocrats\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nChristian Democrats\n\nSocial Democrats\n\nTheir parties, policies, candidates, committees, etc, are:\n\nDemocratic\n\nLiberal Democratic\n\nChristian Democratic\n\nSocial Democratic\n\nThey also vote Democratic, etc; but a committee may be Democrat-controlled.\n\nThe exceptions are Britain’s Liberal Democrat Party and Thailand’s Democrat Party.\n\n4 When referring to a specific party, write Labour, the Republican nominee, a prominent Liberal, etc, but use lower case in looser references to liberals, conservatism, communists, etc. Tories, however, are upper case, as is New Labour.\n\nproper names When forming nouns, adjectives and verbs from proper names, retain the initial capital:\n\nBuddhism\n\nChristian\n\nFinlandisation\n\nGaullism\n\nHindu\n\nHobbesian\n\nIslamic\n\nJacobite\n\nLeninist\n\nLuddite\n\nMaronite\n\nMarxist\n\nNapoleonic\n\nPaisleyite\n\nRussify\n\nThatcherism\n\nExceptions are: platonic, pyrrhic, draconian.\n\nIndian castes are upper case and roman. Eg Brahmin, Dalit.\n\nprovince, river, state are lower case when not strictly part of the name:\n\nCabanas province New York state\n\nLimpopo river Washington state\n\nExceptions are: River Nile, River Thames, Red River (USA), Yellow River (China).\n\nAmerican counties are part of the name; hence Orange County, Madison County.\n\ntrade names Use capitals:\n\nBlackBerry eBay Google Hoover Teflon Valium Jeep Stetson\n\nmiscellaneous (lower case)\n\n19th amendment (but Article 19)\n\naborigines, aboriginal\n\nadministration\n\namazon (female warrior)\n\nangst\n\nblacks (and whites)\n\ncabinet\n\ncivil servant\n\ncivil service\n\ncivil war (including America’s)\n\ncold war\n\ncommon market\n\ncommunist (generally)\n\nconstitution (including America’s)\n\ncruise missile\n\ndraconian euro\n\nfirst world war\n\nfrench windows, fries\n\ngeneral synod\n\ngentile\n\ngovernment\n\nGulf war\n\ngypsy\n\nheaven (and hell)\n\ninternet junior (as in George Bush junior)\n\nKyoto protocol\n\nthe left\n\nmafia (any old group of criminals)\n\nmecca (when used loosely, as a mecca for tourists)\n\nnew year (but New Year’s Day)\n\nOlympic games (and Asian, Commonwealth, European)\n\nopposition\n\nphilistine\n\nplatonic\n\nthe pope\n\nthe press\n\npyrrhic\n\nthe queen\n\nquisling\n\nrealpolitik\n\nrepublican (unless a party)\n\nrevolution (everyone’s)\n\nthe right\n\nsecond world war\n\nsenior (as in Douglas Fairbanks senior)\n\nstate-of-the-union message\n\nsun\n\ntitanic (not the ship)\n\ntitans (unless the original Titans)\n\nwhite paper\n\nworld wide web\n\nyoung turk\n\nmiscellaneous (upper case)\n\nAnglophone (but prefer (English-speaking)\n\nAntichrist\n\nanti-Semitism\n\nAtlanticist\n\nthe Bar\n\nthe Bible (but biblical)\n\nCatholics\n\nCD-ROM\n\nChapter 9, etc\n\nChrist\n\nChristmas Day\n\nChristmas Eve\n\nColoureds (in South Africa)\n\nCommunist (if a particular party)\n\nCongress\n\nthe Crown\n\nthe Cup Final\n\nthe Davis Cup\n\nD-Day\n\nEarth (when, and only when, it is being discussed as a planet like Mars or Venus)\n\nEmpire (everyone’s)\n\nFirst Lady\n\nFounding Fathers\n\nFrancophone\n\nGeneral Assembly (UN)\n\nHispanics\n\nKoran\n\nLabour Day\n\nMafia (the genuine article)\n\nMay Day\n\nMecca (in Saudi Arabia, California and Liberia)\n\nMemorial Day\n\nMoon (when it is Earth’s)\n\nNature (the general entity)\n\nNew Year’s Eve etc (but new year)\n\nParliament (the institution)\n\nPershing missile (because it is named after somebody)\n\nProtestants\n\nthe Queen’s Speech\n\nSemitic (-ism)\n\nSocial Security (in American contexts only, where it is used to mean pensions; what is usually understood by social security elsewhere is welfare in the United States)\n\nStealth fighter, bomber\n\nTaser\n\nTeamster\n\nTen Commandments\n\nTest Match\n\nTory\n\nTube (London Underground)\n\nUtopia (-n)\n\nWarsaw Pact\n\nSee also abbreviations.\n\ncartel A cartel is a group that restricts supply in order to drive up prices. Do not use it to describe any old syndicate or association of producers — especially of drugs.\n\ncase “There is perhaps no single word so freely resorted to as a trouble-saver,” says Gowers, “and consequently responsible for so much flabby writing.” Often you can do without it. There are many cases of it being unnecessary is better as It is often unnecessary. If it is the case that simply means If. It is not the case means It is not so.\n\nCassandra Do not use Cassandra just as a synonym for a prophet of doom. The most notable characteristic about her was that her predictions were always correct but never believed.\n\ncatalyst A catalyst is something that speeds up a chemical reaction while itself remaining unchanged. Do not confuse it with one of the agents.\n\nCentral Asian names see names.\n\ncentred on not around or in.\n\nchallenge Although duels and gauntlets have largely disappeared into history, modern life seems to consist of little else but challenges. At every turn, every president, every government, every business, everyone everywhere is faced with challenges. No one nowadays has to face a change, difficulty, task or job. Next time you grab the word challenge, drop it at once and think again.\n\ncharge If you charge intransitively, do so as a bull, cavalry officer or some such, not as an accuser (so avoid The standard of writing was abysmal, he charged).\n\ncherry-pick If you must use this cliché, note that to cherry-pick means to engage in careful rather than indiscriminate selection, whereas a cherry-picker is a machine for raising pickers (and cleaners and so on) off the ground.\n\nChinese names see names.\n\ncircumstances stand around a thing, so it is in, not under, them.\n\ncivil society pops up a lot these days, often in the company of citizenship skills, community leaders, good governance, the international community, social capital and the like. It can, however, be a useful, albeit ill-defined, term to describe collectively all non-commercial organisations between the family and the state. But do not use it as a euphemism for NGOs (non-governmental organisations), which is how it is usually employed.\n\nclerical titles see titles.\n\nclichés weren’t always clichéd. The first person to use window of opportunity or level playing-field or accident waiting to happen was justly pleased with himself. Each is a strong, vivid expression — or was. The trouble is that such expressions have been copied so often that they have lost their vividness. Mass printing made constant repetition easy, which explains how the word cliché came into being: it is the French term for a stereotype printing plate. Careful writers since Flaubert, who was so obsessive in his search for freshness that he insisted on anything approaching a cliché being printed in italics, have tried to avoid hackneyed phrases.\n\nIn “A Dictionary of Clichés” (1940), Eric Partridge wrote: “Clichés range from fly-blown phrases (much of a muchness; to all intents and purposes), metaphors that are now pointless (lock, stock and barrel), formulas that have become mere counters (far be it from me to …) — through sobriquets that have lost all their freshness and most of their significance (the Iron Duke) — to quotations that are nauseating (cups that cheer but not inebriate), and foreign phrases that are tags (longo intervallo, bête noire).”\n\nMany of yesterday’s clichés have become so much a part of the language that they pass unnoticed; they are like Orwell’s dead metaphors. The ones most to be avoided are the latest, the trendiest. Since they usually appeal to people who do not have the energy to pick their own words, they are often found in the wooden prose of bureaucrats, academics and businessmen, though journalese is far from immune.\n\nClichés numb, rather than stimulate, the reader’s brain.\n\nMany of the clichés in The Economist are phrases like bite the bullet, confirmed bachelor, eye-watering sums, grinding to a halt, high-profile, honeymoon period, incurable optimist, road maps, tax packages, too close to call, toxic debt, whopping bills. They serve merely to bore. Far worse are some of those placed in its pages by its managers, which probably induce terminal despair. The following appeared in an advertisement in May 2009: world-class analysis, key industries, proven track record, strategic, transformative thinking, decisive goal-driven leader, consummate collaborator within a team framework, impactful programmes, strategic and consultative approach, professional in all internal and external interactions, results-driven, relationship-building and communication skills.\n\nMany of these expressions are meaningless. All are ugly. All are borrowed unthinkingly from the language of other advertisers, and since they appear so often they fail to make an impact. Bureaucrats are inveterate offenders. Here is part of a letter from a large London think-tank, explaining that it might be slow in updating members’ details because it was improving its computer system. This simple message was conveyed in 125 words, of which these are some:\n\nThe organisation is upgrading its IT infrastructure by introducing a new database which will enable us to store and share information more effectively internally. We embarked upon this major project when it became clear that the current system no longer adequately supported our requirements. When the new system is fully implemented in the autumn it will enable us to more effectively manage our relationship with members and other stakeholders … We kindly ask for your patience while we resolve any issues over the next two weeks.\n\nLanguage such as this is so common that its authors have stopped asking themselves whether it means anything, whether the message might make more impact if it were expressed in 20 words rather than 125 or whether anyone will even bother to read it.\n\nDo not add to such tosh. Banish from your mind and prose bridges too far; empires striking back; kinder, gentler; F-words; flavours of the month; Generation X; hearts and minds; $64,000 questions; southern discomfort; back to the future; shaken, not stirred; thirty-somethings; and where’s the beef? Be especially careful not to borrow the empty phrases of politicians who constantly invoke paradigm shifts, wake-up calls, supply-side solutions, blue-sky thinking and social inclusion, while asserting their desire to go the extra mile, push the envelope and kick-start the economy. Making a difference is one of the most fatuous favourites. Thus a former director of communications for the Labour Party could assert that the prime minister, Gordon Brown, was being criticised only because he wanted to make a difference, as though the same plea could not have been made for A. Hitler or J. Stalin.\n\nNot all clichés, however, are used unthinkingly. Politicians often resort to hackneyed language to give the impression that they are saying something when they are doing their best to avoid it.\n\nTreat all such stuff as a caution. (“Political language is designed to … give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” George Orwell)\n\nco- This prefix is sometimes useful but now overdone. In the sentences He co-founded the company with Sir Alan or He co-wrote “The Left Nation” with Adrian Windback, the co- is unnecessary. Co-author and co-sleep are worse than that. “We want parents … not to co-sleep with their baby,” said Professor Peter Fleming. This was because “the majority of the co-sleeping deaths occurred in a hazardous sleeping environment.” (The Times, October 14th 2009.) Co-workers are colleagues.\n\ncoiffed not coiffured.\n\ncolons see punctuation.\n\ncome up with Try suggest, originate or produce.\n\ncommas see punctuation.\n\ncommit Do not commit to, but by all means commit yourself to something.\n\ncommunity is a useful word in the context of religious or ethnic groups. But in many others it jars. Not only is it often unnecessary, it also purports to convey a sense of togetherness that may well not exist:\n\nThe black community means blacks (or African-Americans, etc).\n\nThe business community means businessmen (who are supposed to be competing, not colluding).\n\nThe intelligence community means spies.\n\nThe online community means geeks, nerds and netizens.\n\nThe migration and development communities means NGOs.\n\nThe international community, if it means anything, means other countries, aid agencies or, just occasionally, the family of nations. What the global community (Financial Times, July 12th 2005) means is a mystery.\n\ncompany names Call companies by the names they call themselves. Therefore check the company’s name against their literature or website. Economist usage is now to ignore all rogue exclamation marks, backward letters, etc in company names.\n\ncomparatives Take care. One thing may be many times more expensive than another. It cannot be many times cheaper. Indeed, it can be cheaper only by a proportion that is less than one. A different but similar mistake is to say that people grew twice as poor during a given period. Instead, say people’s incomes fell by half during that period (if that is what you mean, which, since it confuses income with wealth, it may not be).\n\nRemember that comparatives should be compared with (or to) something.\n\ncompare In best usage, A is compared with B when you draw attention to the difference. A is compared to B when you want to stress their similarity.\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n\ncompound (verb) does not mean make worse. It may mean combine or, intransitively, it may mean to agree or come to terms. To compound a felony means to agree for a consideration not to prosecute. (It is also used, with different senses, as a noun and adjective.)\n\ncomprise means is composed of. NATO’s force in Afghanistan comprises troops from 42 countries. America’s troops make up (not comprise) nearly half the force. Alternatively, Nearly half NATO’s force in Afghanistan is composed of American troops.\n\ncontemporary see current.\n\ncontinuous describes something uninterrupted. Continual admits of a break. If your neighbours play loud music every night, it is a continual nuisance; it is not a continuous one unless the music is never turned off.\n\ncontrast, by or in Use by contrast only when you are comparing one thing with another: Somalia is a poor country. By contrast, Egypt is rich. This means Egypt is rich by comparison with Somalia, though by other standards it is poor. If you are simply noting a difference, say in contrast: The Joneses spend their holidays in the south of France. In contrast, the Smiths go to south Wales.\n\nconvince should be followed by a noun or, in the passive, that or of. Do not convince people to do something. If you want to write to, the verb you need is persuade. The prime minister was persuaded to call a June election; he was convinced of the wisdom of doing so only after he had won.\n\ncoruscate means sparkle or throw off flashes of light, not wither, devastate or reduce to wrinkles (that’s corrugate).\n\ncould is sometimes useful as a variant of may or might: His coalition could (or might) collapse. But take care. Does He could call an election in June mean He might call an election in June or He would be allowed to call an election in June?\n\ncouncil, counsel A council is a body of people, elected or appointed, that advises, administers, organises, legislates, etc. Counsel (noun) means advice or consultation, or lawyers who give legal advice and fight cases in court.\n\ncrescendo Not an acme, apogee, peak, summit or zenith but a passage of increasing loudness. You cannot therefore build to a crescendo.\n\ncrisis A decisive event or turning-point. Many of the economic and political troubles wrongly described as crises are really persistent difficulties, sagas or affairs.\n\ncritique is a noun in British English. If you want a verb, try criticise.\n\ncurrencies Use $ as the standard currency and, on first mention of sums in all other currencies, give a dollar conversion in brackets.\n\nApart from those currencies that are written out in full (see below), write the abbreviation followed by the number.\n\nBritain\n\npound, abbreviated as £\n\npence, abbreviated as p\n\n1p, 2p, 3p, etc to 99p (not £0.99)\n\n£6 (not £6.00), £6.47\n\n£5,000—6,000 (not £5,000—£6,000)\n\n£5m—6m (not £5m—£6m)\n\n£5 bn—6 bn (not £5—6 bn), £5.2 bn—6.2 bn\n\nAmerica\n\ndollar, abbreviated as $, will do generally; US$ if there is a mixture of dollar currencies (see below)\n\ncents, spell out, unless part of a larger number: $4.99\n\nother dollar currencies\n\nA$ Australian dollars\n\nNZ$ New Zealand dollars\n\nC$ Canadian dollars\n\nS$ Singaporean dollars\n\nHK$ Hong Kong dollars\n\nZ$ Zimbabwean dollars\n\nNT$ Taiwanese dollars\n\nEurope\n\neuro, plural euros, abbreviated as €, for those countries that have adopted it.\n\ncents, spell out, unless part of a larger number.\n\n€10 (not 10 euros), €10.75\n\nDM, BFr, drachmas, FFr, Italian lire, IR£ (punts), markkas, Asch, Ptas and other currencies of the euro area have all been replaced by €, but may turn up in historical references.\n\nDKr Danish krone (plural kroner)\n\nIKr Icelandic krona (plural kronur)\n\nNKr Norwegian krone (plural kroner)\n\nSFr Swiss franc, SFr1m (not 1m Swiss francs)\n\nSKr Swedish krona (plural kronor)\n\nsums in all other currencies are written in full, with the number first.\n\nBrazil, real, 100m reais\n\nChina, yuan, 100m yuan (not renminbi) (see below)\n\nIndia, rupee, 100m rupees\n\nNigeria, naira, 100m naira\n\npeso currencies, 100m pesos\n\nSouth Africa, rand, 100m rand (not rands)\n\nTurkey, Turkish lira, 100m liras\n\nBut Japan, yen ¥, ¥1,000 (not 1,000 yen)\n\nChina Properly, Chinese sums are expressed as, eg, 1 yuan rmb, meaning 1 yuan renminbi. Yuan, which means money, is the Chinese unit of currency. Renminbi, which means the people’s currency, is the description of the yuan, as sterling is the description of the pound. Use yuan.\n\nSee also figures; and currencies and measures in Part 3.\n\ncurrent, contemporary Current and contemporary mean at that time, not necessarily at this time. So a series of current prices from 1960 to 1970 will not be in today’s prices, just as contemporary art in 1800 was not modern art. Contemporary history is a contradiction in terms.\n\ncusp is a pointed end or a horn of, for example, the Moon, or the point at which two branches of a curve meet. So it is odd to write, say, “Japan is on the cusp of a recovery” unless you think that recovery is about to end.\n\ndashes see punctuation.\n\ndata It cannot be emphasised enough that this is a plural (singular, datum), despite its almost universal use as a singular noun. Do not be cowed by the majority.\n\ndates month, day, year, in that order, with no commas:\n\nJuly 5th\n\n1996—99\n\nMonday July 5th\n\n2005—10\n\nJuly 5th 2009\n\n1998—2009\n\nJuly 27th—August 3rd 2010 1990s\n\nJuly 2002\n\nDo not write on June 10th—14th; prefer between June 10th and 14th. If, say, ministers are to meet over two days, write on December 14th and 15th.\n\nDo not burden the reader with dates of no significance, but give a date rather than just last week, this week or next week (or, indeed, last month or next month), which can cause confusion.\n\nDates are often crucial to an account of events, but sentences (and, even more, articles) that begin with a date can be clumsy and off-putting. This week Congress is due to consider the matter is often better put as Congress is due to consider the matter this week. The effect is even more numbing if a comma is inserted: This week, Congress is due to consider the matter, though this construction is sometimes merited when emphasis is needed on the date.\n\nDates that require AD or BC should be set as one unhyphenated word (76AD, 55BC). The same applies to CE (common era) and BCE (before common era), though neither is used in The Economist.\n\ndeal (verb) Transitively, deal means distribute: “He was dealt two aces, two kings and a six.” Intransitively, deal means engage in business. Do not deal drugs, horses, weapons, etc; deal in them.\n\ndecimate means to destroy a proportion (originally a tenth) of a group of people or things, not to destroy them all or nearly all.\n\ndemographics used not to be a word at all, but has become a useful term for facts about births and deaths, and the size and distribution of population, and it would be foolish to ban it.\n\ndeprecate, depreciate To deprecate is to argue or plead against (by prayer or otherwise). To depreciate is to lower in value.\n\ndifferent from not to or than.\n\ndilemma Not just any old awkwardness but one with horns, being, properly, a form of argument (the horned syllogism) in which you find yourself committed to accept one of two propositions each of which contradicts your original contention. Thus a dilemma offers the choice between two alternatives, each with equally nasty consequences.\n\ndiscreet, discrete Discreet means circumspect or prudent. Discrete means separate or distinct. Remember that “Questions are never indiscreet. Answers sometimes are.” (Oscar Wilde)\n\ndisinterested means impartial; uninterested means indifferent. “Disinterested curiosity is the lifeblood of civilisation.” (G.M. Trevelyan)\n\ndouse, dowse Douse means to throw water over something or extinguish a light or a fire. Dowse means to search for underground water with a divining rod.\n\ndown to down to earth yes, but “Occasional court victories are not down to human rights.” (The Economist) No: down to does not mean attributable to, the responsibility of or even up to (It’s up to you). Use caused by or the result of.\n\ndue process is a technical term, or piece of jargon, which was first used in England in 1355. It comes in two forms, substantive due process, which relates to the duties of governments to act rationally and proportionally when doing anything that affects citizens’ rights, and procedural due process, which relates to the need for fair procedures. If you use the expression, make sure it is clear what you mean by it.\n\ndue to when used to mean caused by must follow a noun, as in The cancellation, due to rain, of … Do not write It was cancelled due to rain. If you mean because of and for some reason are reluctant to say it, you probably want owing to. It was cancelled owing to rain is all right.\n\nDutch names see names.\n\nearnings Do not write earnings when you mean profits (try to say if they are operating, gross, pre-tax or net).\n\n-ee employees, evacuees, detainees, divorcees, referees, refugees but, please, no attendees (those attending), draftees (conscripts), enrollees (participants), escapees (escapers), indictees (the indicted), retirees (the retired), or standees. A divorcee may be male or female.\n\neffect the verb, means to accomplish, so The novel effected a change in his attitude. See also affect.\n\n-effective, -efficient Cost-effective sounds authoritative, but does it mean good value for money, gives a big bang for the buck or just plain cheap? If cheap, say cheap.\n\neffectively, in effect Effectively means with effect; if you mean in effect, say it. The matter was effectively dealt with on Friday means it was done well on Friday. The matter was, in effect, dealt with on Friday means it was more or less attended to on Friday.\n\neither … or see none.\n\nelite, elitist Once a neutral word meaning a chosen group or the pick of the bunch, elite is now almost always used pejoratively. Elitist and elitism are even more reprehensible. No matter that the words have their roots in the French verb élire, to elect, and the Latin eligere, to pick out; if you believe in government by a chosen group, or are a member of such a group, you are a reprobate. Only elite forces seem to escape censure. Though scornful of elites in education and politics, most people, when taken hostage, are happy to be rescued by elite troops. Use these words with care.\n\nenclave An enclave is a piece of territory or territorial water entirely surrounded by foreign territory (Andorra, Ceuta, Kaliningrad, Melilla, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nakhichevan, San Marino).\n\nendemic, epidemic Endemic means prevalent or generally found in a place or population. Epidemic means prevalent among a population at a particular time.\n\nenormity means a crime, sin or monstrous wickedness. It does not mean immensity.\n\nenvironment is often unavoidable, but it’s not a pretty word. Avoid the business environment, the school environment, the work environment, etc. Try to rephrase the sentence — conditions for business, at school, at work, etc. Surroundings can sometimes do the job. In a writing environment you may want to make use of your correction fluid, rubber (or American eraser) or delete key.\n\nepicentre means that point on the surface (usually the Earth’s) above the centre of something below (usually an earthquake). So Mr Putin was not at the epicentre of the dispute, he was at its centre.\n\nThe hypocentre, in contrast, is the place on the surface (usually of the earth) below something above (usually an explosion). It is the same as ground zero.\n\neponymous is the adjective of eponym, which is the person or thing after which something is named. So George Canning was the eponymous hero of the Canning Club, Hellen was the eponymous ancestor of the Hellenes (Greeks), Ninus was the eponymous founder of Nineveh. Do not say John Sainsbury, the founder of the eponymous supermarket. Rather he was the eponymous founder of J. Sainsbury’s. The word is ugly, though, and usually unnecessary.\n\nethnic groups Your first concern should be to avoid giving offence. But also avoid mealy-mouthed euphemisms and terms that have not generally caught on despite promotion by pressure-groups.\n\nEthnic meaning concerning nations or races, or even something ill-defined in between, is a useful word. But do not be shy of race and racial. After several years in which race was seen as a purely social concept, not a scientific one, the term is coming back among scientists as a shorthand way of speaking about genetic rather than cultural or political differences. See also political correctness.\n\nAfricans may be descended from Asians, Europeans or black Africans. If you specifically mean the last, write black Africans, not simply Africans.\n\nAnglo-Saxon is not a synonym for English-speaking. Neither the United States nor Australia is an Anglo-Saxon country; nor is Britain. Anglo-Saxon capitalism does not exist.\n\nAsians In Britain, but nowhere else, Asians is often used to mean immigrants and their descendants from the Indian subcontinent. Many such people are coming to dislike the term, and many foreigners must assume it means people from all over Asia, so take care. Note that, even in the usage peculiar to Britain, Asian is not synonymous with Muslim.\n\nblacks In many countries, including the United States, many black people are happy to be called blacks, although some prefer to be African-Americans. Black is shorter and more straightforward, but use either. Use Native American for indigenous Americans, to avoid confusion with the growing number of Indian-Americans.\n\nmixed race Do not call people who are neither pure white nor pure black browns. People of mixed race in South Africa are Coloureds. Note the capital.\n\nother groups The inhabitants of Azerbaijan are Azerbaijanis, some of whom, but not all, are Azeris. Those Azeris who live in other places, such as Iran, are not Azerbaijanis. Similarly, many Croats are not Croatian, many Serbs not Serbian, many Uzbeks not Uzbekistanis, etc.\n\nSpanish-speakers in the United States When writing about Spanish-speaking people in the United States, use either Latino or Hispanic as a general term, but try to be specific (eg, Mexican-American). Many Latin Americans (eg, those from Brazil) are not Hispanic.\n\neuphemisms Avoid, where possible, euphemisms and circumlocutions, especially those promoted by interest-groups keen to please their clients or organisations anxious to avoid embarrassment. This does not mean that good writers should be insensitive to giving offence: on the contrary, if you are to be persuasive, you would do well to be courteous. But a good writer owes something to plain speech, the English language and the truth, as well as to manners. Political correctness can be carried too far.\n\nSo, in most contexts, offending behaviour is probably criminal behaviour. Female teenagers are girls, not women. Living with mobility impairment probably means wheelchair-bound. Developing countries are often stagnating or even regressing (try poor) countries. The underprivileged may be disadvantaged, but are more likely just poor (the very concept of underprivilege is absurd, since it implies that some people receive less than their fair share of something that is by definition an advantage or prerogative).\n\nRemember that euphemisms are the stock-in-trade of people trying to obscure the truth. Thus Enron’s document-management policy simply meant shredding. France’s proposed solidarity contribution on airline tickets was a tax. Bankers’ guaranteed bonuses are salaries (or fractions thereof).\n\nTake particular care if you borrow the language of politicians, especially when they are trying to justify a war. “They make a wilderness and call it peace,” wrote Tacitus nearly 2,000 years ago, quoting Calgalus, a British chief whose people had suffered at the hands of the Romans. Orwell was equally acute in pointing out decades ago how terms like transfer of population and rectification of frontiers put names on things without calling up mental pictures of them. Friendly fire, body count, prisoner abuse, smart bombs, surgical strike, collateral damage have been coined more recently with the same ends in mind. The Reagan administration spoke of its airborne invasion of Grenada in 1983 as a vertical insertion.\n\nThe butchers of the Balkans produced ethnic cleansing, and the jihadists of al-Qaeda speak of martyrdom operations in place of Islamically incorrect suicide-bombs. The Bush administration, with its all-justifying war on terror (prosecuted with the help of the Patriot Act), provided more than its fair share of bland misnomers. Its practice of enhanced interrogation was torture, just as its practice of extraordinary rendition was probably torture contracted out to foreigners and its self-injurious behaviour incidents at Guantánamo Bay were attempted suicides. The president’s ensuing reputational problem just meant he was mistrusted.\n\nOrwell would surely have put human-rights abuses in the same category of nerve-deadening understatement as pacification and elimination of unreliable elements. The term may occasionally be useful, but try to avoid it by rephrasing the sentence more pithily and accurately. The army is accused of committing numerous human-rights abuses probably means The army is accused of torture and murder. A high-net-worth individual is a rich man or rich woman. Zero-percent financing means an interest-free loan. Non-observable inputs are assumptions used in self-serving guesswork. Intimate apparel is underwear.\n\nSee also affirmative action.\n\nEuro- is the prefix for anything relating to the European Union; euro- is the prefix for anything relating to the currency. The usual rules apply for the full, proper names (with informal equivalents on the right below). Thus:\n\nEuropean Commission\n\nthe commission\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\nthe parliament\n\nEuropean Union\n\nthe Union\n\nTreaty of Rome\n\nthe Rome treaty\n\nTreaty on European Union\n\nthe Maastricht treaty\n\nTreaty of Lisbon\n\nthe Lisbon treaty\n\nThe EU grouping may be called EU-15, EU-27.\n\nWhen making Euro- or euro-words, always introduce a hyphen.\n\nExceptions are:\n\nEurophile Europhobe Eurosceptic Eurobond Euroyen bond\n\nPrefer euro zone or euro area (two words, no hyphen) to euro-land. CAP is the common agricultural policy.\n\nEMU stands for economic and (not European) monetary union.\n\nERM is the exchange-rate mechanism.\n\nIGC is an inter-governmental conference.\n\nex- (and former) Be careful. A Labour Party ex-member has lost his seat; an ex-Labour member has lost his party.\n\nexecute means put to death by law. Do not use it as a synonym for murder. An extra-judicial execution is a contradiction in terms. (See assassinate.)\n\nexistential Often used, seldom understood, even it seems by those who use it, existential means of or pertaining to existence. In logic it may mean predicating existence, and in other philosophical contexts, relating to existentialism. It is sometimes used in such phrases as existential threat or existential crisis, where the author wants it to mean a threat to the existence (of Israel, say) or a crisis that calls into the question the existence of something (eg, NATO). But in most instances, including most in The Economist, it seems to serve no purpose other than to make the writer believe he is impressing his readers.\n\nfact The fact that can often be reduced to that, but not always. Check whether it confuses the start of a sentence, as it sometimes does.\n\nfactoid A factoid is something that sounds like a fact, is thought by many to be a fact (perhaps because it is repeated so often), but is not in fact a fact. In general, avoid, instead using myth for a fake fact and bit of trivia for a small, fun, true fact.\n\nfed up with, not of. Similarly, bored with, not of.\n\nfederalist in Britain, someone who believes in centralising the powers of associated states; in the United States and Europe, someone who believes in decentralising them.\n\nfellow Often unnecessary, especially before countrymen (“Friends,Romans, fellow-countrymen”?).\n\nferal can mean brutish or uncultivated, but is best used of animals, children, etc, that were once tamed or domesticated but have run wild.\n\nferment, foment When you ferment, what you are doing is to cause something to effervesce, like yeast. But you foment trouble, sedition, revolution.\n\nfewer than, less than Fewer (not less) than seven speeches, fewer than seven samurai. Use fewer, not less, with numbers of individual items or people. Less than £200, less than 700 tonnes of oil, less than a third, because these are measured quantities or proportions, not individual items.\n\nTime, being viewed as a continuum, also takes less; in less than six weeks, after less than five months.\n\nfief not fiefdom.\n\nfigures Never start a sentence with a figure; write the number in words instead.\n\nUse words for simple numerals from one to ten inclusive, except: in references to pages; in percentages (eg, 4%); and in sets of numerals, some of which are higher than ten.\n\nDeaths from this cause in the past three years were 14, 9 and 6.\n\nAlways use numbers with units of measurement, even for those less than ten:\n\n4 metres, 9 miles, but four cows.\n\nIt is occasionally permissible to use words rather than numbers when referring to a rough or rhetorical figure (such as a thousand curses, a hundred years of solitude).\n\nIn all other cases, though, use figures for numerals from 11 upwards.\n\nfirst to tenth centuries, the 11th century\n\n20th century, 21st century\n\n20th-century ideas\n\nin 100 years’ time\n\ntwo and a half years later\n\na 29-year-old man\n\na man in his 20s\n\n20th anniversary\n\n40-fold (but fourfold, up to and including ten)\n\n30-something\n\nthe Sixties (etc)\n\nThe Thirty Years War is an exception.\n\ndecimal point Use figures for all numerals that include a decimal point (eg, 4.25).\n\nfractions Figures may be appropriate for fractions, if the context is either technical or precise, or both: Though the poll’s figures were supposed to be accurate to within 1%, his lead of 4¼ points turned out on election day to be minus 3½.\n\nWhere precision is less important but it is nonetheless impossible to shoot off the fraction, words may look better:\n\nThough the beast was sold as a two-year-old, it turned out to be two and a half times that.\n\nFractions should be hyphenated (one-half, three-quarters, etc) and, unless they are attached to whole numbers (8½, 29¾), spelled out in words, even when the figures are higher than ten: He gave a tenth of his salary to the church, a twentieth to his mistress and a thirtieth to his wife.\n\nfractions and decimals Do not compare a fraction with a decimal. So avoid:\n\nThe rate fell from 3¼% to 3.1%.\n\nFractions are more precise than decimals (3.33 neglects an infinity of figures that are embraced by 1/3), but your readers probably do not think so. You should therefore use fractions for rough figures: Kenya’s population is growing at 3½% a year. A hectare is 2½ acres. and decimals for more exact ones:\n\nThe retail price index is rising at an annual rate of 10.6%.\n\nBut treat all numbers with respect. That usually means resisting the precision of more than one decimal place, and generally favouring rounding off. Beware of phoney over-precision.\n\nhyphens and figures Do not use a hyphen in place of to except with figures: He received a sentence of 15—20 years in jail but He promised to escape within three to four weeks.\n\nLatin usage It is outdated to use Latin words. So, with figures, do not write per caput, per capita or per annum. Use:\n\na head or per head\n\na person or per person\n\na year or per year\n\n2 litres of water per person\n\nprices rose by 10% a year\n\nSee also per caput.\n\nmeasurements In most non-American contexts use metric units: hectares, not acres\n\nkilometres (or km), not miles\n\nmetres, not yards\n\nlitres, not gallons\n\nkilos (kg), not lb (never lbs)\n\ntonnes, not tons\n\nIn American contexts, you may use the measurements more familiar to Americans (though remember that American pints, quarts, gallons, etc, are smaller than imperial ones).\n\nRegardless of which you choose, you should give an equivalent, on first use, in the other units: It was hoped that after improvements to the engine the car would give 20km to the litre (47 miles per American gallon), compared with its present average of 15km per litre.\n\nIt is now rare to buy petrol in imperial gallons. In America it is sold in American gallons; in most other places it is sold in litres.\n\nNote that a four-by-four vehicle can be a 4x4.\n\nmillion, billion, trillion, quadrillion Use m for million, bn for billion and trn for trillion.\n\n8m 8 bn\n\n£8m €8 bn\n\nA billion is a thousand million, a trillion a thousand billion, a quadrillion a thousand trillion.\n\nper cent, percentage points Use the sign % instead of per cent. But write percentage, never %age (though in most contexts proportion or share is preferable).\n\nA fall from 4% to 2% is a drop of two percentage points, or of 50%, but not of 2%. (See also per cent.)\n\nranges Write:\n\n5,000—6,000\n\n5—6%\n\n5m—6m (not 5—6m)\n\n5 bn—6 bn\n\nBut:\n\nSales rose from 5m to 6m (not 5m—6m); estimates ranged between 5m and 6m (not 5m—6m).\n\nratios Where to is being used as part of a ratio, it is usually best to spell it out.\n\nThey decided, by nine votes to two, to put the matter to the general assembly, which voted, 27 to 19, to insist that the ratio of vodka to tomato juice in a bloody mary should be at least one to three, though the odds of this being so in most bars were put at no better than 11 to 4.\n\nWhere a ratio is being used adjectivally, figures and dashes may be used, but only if one of the figures is greater than ten:\n\na 50—20 vote\n\na 19—9 vote\n\nOtherwise, spell out the figures and use to and hyphens:\n\na two-to-one vote\n\na ten-to-one probability\n\nfinally Do not use finally when you mean at last. Richard Burton finally marries Liz Taylor would have been all right second time round but not first.\n\nflaunt, flout Flaunt means display; flout means disdain. If you flout this distinction, you will flaunt your ignorance.\n\nfocus can be a useful word. It is shorter than concentrate and sharper than look at. But it is overused.\n\n-fold Use -fold only for increases, not decreases.\n\nfootnotes, sources, references see footnotes, sources, references in Part 3.\n\nforeign languages and translation Occasionally, a foreign language may provide the mot juste or a good joke. Sometimes it may be hard to translate a word satisfactorily, or it may be unusually evocative. But try not to use foreign words and phrases unless there is no English alternative, which is unusual.\n\nnames of foreign companies, institutions, groups, parties, etc should usually be translated. So:\n\nthe Dutch People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (not the Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie\n\nthe German Christian Democratic Union (not the Christlich Demokratische Union)\n\nthe Shining Path (not Sendero Luminoso)\n\nthe National Assembly (not the Assemblée Nationale)\n\nBut if an abbreviation is also given, that may be the initials of the foreign name:\n\nUMP for France’s Union for a Presidential Majority\n\nSPD for the Social Democratic Party of Germany\n\nPAN for Mexico’s National Action Party\n\nBreak this rule when the name is better known untranslated:\n\nForza Italia\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières\n\nParti Québécois (Canada)\n\nyakuza (not 8-9-3)\n\nplacenames Some placenames are better translated if they are well known in English:\n\nSt Mark’s Square in Venice (not Piazza San Marco)\n\nthe Elysée Palace (not the Palais de l’Elysée)\n\ntitles of foreign books, films, etc The titles of foreign books, films, plays, operas and TV programmes present difficulties. Some are so well known that they are unlikely to need translation:\n\n“Das Kapital” “Mein Kampf” “Le Petit Prince” “Die Fledermaus”\n\nAnd sometimes the meaning of the title may be unimportant in the context, so a translation is not necessary:\n\n“Hiroshima, Mon Amour”\n\nBut often the title will be significant, and you will want to translate it. One solution, easy with classics, is simply to give the English translation:\n\n“One Hundred Years of Solitude” “The Leopard” “War and Peace” “The Tin Drum”\n\nThis is usually the best practice to follow with pamphlets, articles and non-fiction, too.\n\nBut sometimes, especially with books and films that are little known among English-speakers or unobtainable in English (perhaps you are reviewing one), you may want to give both the original title and a translation, thus:\n\n“11 Septembre 2001: l’Effroyable Imposture” (“September 11th 2001: The Appalling Deception”)\n\n“La Règle du Jeu” (“The Rules of the Game”)\n\n“La Traviata” (“The Sinner”)\n\nForeign titles do not need to be set in italics. Treat them as if they were in English.\n\nNote that book publishers follow different rules here. (See italics.)\n\ntranslating words and phrases If you want to translate a foreign word or phrase, even if it is the name of a group or newspaper or party, just put it in brackets without inverted commas, so: Arbeit macht frei (work makes free)\n\nPravda (Truth)\n\nzapatero (shoemaker)\n\nforensic means pertaining to courts of law (held by the Romans in the forum) or, more loosely, the application of science to legal issues. Forensic medicine is medical jurisprudence. Forensic does not mean very careful or very detailed.\n\nforgo, forego Forgo means do without; it forgoes the e. Forego means go before. A foregone conclusion is one that is predetermined; a forgone conclusion is non-existent.\n\nformer see ex-.\n\nformer and latter Avoid the use of the former and the latter whenever possible. It usually causes confusion.\n\nfounder, flounder If you flounder, you struggle clumsily or helplessly. If you founder, you stumble (if you’re a horse), collapse (a building) or sink (a ship).\n\nFrankenstein was not the monster, but its creator.\n\nfree is an adjective or an adverb (and also a transitive verb), so you cannot have or do anything for free. Either you have it free or you have it for nothing. Resist to the death the increasingly common (mis-)usage.\n\nFrench names see names.\n\nfresh is not a synonym for new or more. “A few hundred fresh bodies are being recovered every day,” reported The Economist improbably, two months after a tsunami had struck. Use with care.\n\nfull stops see punctuation.\n\nfulsome is an old word that Americans generally use only to mean cloying, insincere or excessively flattering. In British English it can also mean copious, abundant or lavish. But these meanings are now tending to merge.\n\ngarner means store, not gather.\n\ngearing is an ugly word which, if used, needs to be explained. It may be either the ratio of debt to equity or the ratio of debt to total capital employed. (See also leverage.)\n\ngender is nowadays used in several ways. One is common in feminist writing, where the term has a technical meaning. “One is not born a woman, one becomes one,” argued Simone de Beauvoir: in other words, one chooses one’s gender. In such a context it would be absurd to use the word sex; the term must be gender. But, in using it thus, try to explain what you mean by it.\n\nThe primary use of gender is in grammar, where it is applied to words, not people. If someone is female, that is her sex, not her gender. The gender of Mädchen, the German word for girl, is neuter. So do not use gender as a synonym for sex.\n\nIn recent years, gender terms have become much more complicated. When describing someone’s sexuality, it is best to use the term they use for themselves: gay (adj only; never used as a noun, which is slang or archaic); lesbian or lesbians (adj or n); bisexual (adj or n); straight (adj only).\n\nWhen describing people, prefer gay or gay and lesbian to homosexual, which has become outdated. Gay does not just refer to men — hence gay marriage, gay pride. Reserve homosexual for sexual behaviours and tendencies. Hence a homosexual liaison or homosexual acts (which could be done by people who do not see themselves as gay).\n\nWhen describing someone’s gender identity, it is best to use the term they use for themselves: man; woman; transgender man or woman, which can be shortened to trans man/woman. If you need to state a far less common gender identity, such as non-binary and genderqueer, it is likely to be significant enough in the text you are writing that it is worth explaining.\n\nThe LGBT movement When referring to advocates of rights for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and other minority sexual and gender identities, you can use LGBT as an umbrella term to describe the activists. Do not write LGBT community, because activists for one particular issue do not represent all people who are either L, G, B or T. Because the LGBT church is broad, usually it is most accurate to refer to the specific group of people with regard to a specific right or issue. “Transgender activists are fighting the bathroom law in Texas”, “Gay men are calling for the anti-HIV drug PrEP to be available on the NHS”, and so on.\n\ngentlemen’s agreement not gentleman’s.\n\ngeographical The adjective from geography is geographical, not geographic.\n\nGerman names see names.\n\nget is an adaptable verb, but it has its limits. A prize-winner does not get to shake hands with the president, or spend the money all at once; he gets the chance to, is able to, or allowed to.\n\nglobal Globalisation can go to the head. It is not necessary to describe, eg, the head of Baker & Mackenzie as the global head of that firm. And what is a global vacancy (as advertised by The Economist Group)? And avoid saying “now that we’re all part of a global world”, unless you have hitherto believed the Earth to be flat.\n\ngood in parts is what the curate said about an egg that was wholly bad. He was trying to be polite.\n\ngourmet, gourmand Gourmet means epicure; gourmand means greedy-guts.\n\ngovernance, government Corporate governance has now entered the language as a useful, albeit ugly, term to describe the rules relating to the conduct of business. Governance has come to mean the system or structure of governing in general; government is the specific instance of this in particular places.\n\ngrammar and syntax Take care in the construction of your sentences and paragraphs. A single issue of The Economist contained the following:\n\nWhen closed at night, the fear is that this would shut off rather than open up part of the city centre.\n\nUnlike Canary Wharf, the public will be able to go to the top to look out over the city.\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, after an unbroken string of successes in state and local elections, pollsters said …\n\nSome hints are provided here on avoiding pitfalls, infelicities and mistakes; this is not a comprehensive guide to English grammar and syntax.\n\na or the Strictly, Barclays is a British bank, not the British bank, just as Toyota is a car company, not the car company, and Angela Gheorghiu is an opera singer, not the opera singer. If it seems absurd to describe someone or something thus — that is, with the indefinite article — you can probably dispense with the description altogether or insert an extra word or two that may be useful to the reader: Toyota, the world’s biggest car company in 2009; Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.\n\nactive or passive? Be direct. Use the active tense. A hit B describes the event more concisely than B was hit by A.\n\nadjectives and adverbs Adjectives qualify nouns, adverbs modify verbs. If you have a sentence that contains the words firstly, secondly, more importantly, etc, they almost certainly ought to be first, second, more important.\n\nadjectives of proper nouns If proper nouns have adjectives, use them.\n\nCrimean war (not the Crimea war)\n\nDutch East India Company (not the Holland East India Company)\n\nLebanese (not Lebanon) civil war\n\nPakistani (not Pakistan) government\n\nIt is permissible to use the noun as an adjective if to do otherwise would cause confusion.\n\nAn African initiative suggests the proposal came from Africa, whereas an Africa initiative suggests it was about Africa.\n\nCalifornian, Texan Do not feel you have to follow American convention in using words like Californian and Texan only as nouns. In British English, it is quite acceptable to write a Californian (not California) judge, Texan (not Texas) scandal, etc. “Mr Gedge … was not fond of St Rocque, and this morning it would have seemed less attractive to him than ever, for three of his letters bore Californian postmarks and their contents had aggravated the fever of his home-sickness.” (P.G. Wodehouse, “Hot Water”)\n\ncollective nouns — singular or plural? There is no firm rule about the number of a verb governed by a singular collective noun. It is best to go by the sense — that is, whether the collective noun stands for a single entity:\n\nThe council was elected in March.\n\nThe me generation has run its course.\n\nThe staff is loyal.\n\nor for its constituents:\n\nThe council are at sixes and sevens.\n\nThe preceding generation are all dead.\n\nThe staff are at each other’s throats.\n\nDo not, in any event, slavishly give all singular collective nouns singular verbs: The couple are now living apart is preferable to The couple is now living apart.\n\nmajority When it is used in an abstract sense, it takes the singular; when it is used to denote the elements making up the majority, it should be plural.\n\nA two-thirds majority is needed to amend the constitution\n\nbut A majority of the Senate were opposed.\n\nA majority of can often be replaced by most.\n\nnumber Rule: The number is …; A number are …\n\npair and couple Treat both a pair and a couple as plural.\n\ncomparisons Take care, too, when making comparisons, to compare like with like:\n\nThe Belgian economy is bigger than Russia should be Belgium’s economy is bigger than Russia’s.\n\nAn advertisement for The Economist declared,\n\nOur style and our whole philosophy are different from other publications. Only changing publications to publications’ could turn this into sense.\n\ncontractions Don’t overdo the use of don’t, isn’t, can’t, won’t, etc.\n\nfalse possessive An ’s at the end of a word, in the possessive or genitive case, does the job of of. An increasingly common practice, especially among broadcasters and sometimes in The Economist, is to use it to do the job of in. Thus places or buildings are described as, eg, New York’s Chrysler Building, Edinburgh’s Usher Hall or Belfast’s Shankill Road. Do not commit this sin. The Chrysler Building is in New York, not of it, just as Shankill Road is in Belfast and the Usher Hall is in Edinburgh.\n\ngenitive Take care with the genitive. It is fine to say a friend of Bill’s, just as you would say a friend of mine, so you can also say a friend of Bill’s and Carol’s. But it is also fine to say a friend of Bill, or a friend of Bill and Carol. What you must not say is Bill and Carol’s friend. If you wish to use that construction, you must say Bill’s and Carol’s friend, which is cumbersome.\n\ngerunds Respect the gerund. Gerunds look like participles — running, jumping, standing — but are more noun-like, and should never therefore be preceded by a personal pronoun. So the following are wrong: I was awoken by him snoring, He could not prevent them drowning, Please forgive me coming late.\n\nThose sentences should have ended:\n\nhis snoring, their drowning, my coming late.\n\nIn other words, use the possessive adjective rather than the personal pronoun.\n\nhe, she, they To make language gender-neutral would be a forlorn undertaking in most tongues, and even in English, which assigns few genders to nouns, it presents difficulties. It may be no tragedy that policemen are now almost always police officers and firemen firefighters, but to call chairmen chairs serves chiefly to remind everyone that the world of committees and those who make it go round are largely devoid of humour. Avoid also chairpersons (chairwoman is permissible but unnecessary), humankind and the person in the street — ugly expressions all.\n\nIt is no more demeaning to women to use the words actress, ballerina or seamstress than goddess, princess or queen. (Similarly, you should feel as free to separate Siamese twins or welsh on debts — at your own risk — as you would to go on a Dutch treat, pass through french windows, or play Russian roulette. Note, though, that you risk being dogged by catty language police.)\n\nIf you believe it is “exclusionary” or insulting to women to use he in a general sense, the best solution is to rephrase some sentences in the plural. Thus Instruct the reader without lecturing him may be put as Instruct readers without lecturing them.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary now accepts the use of “their” in examples like the following: We can’t afford to squander anyone’s talents, whatever colour their skin is.\n\nWhen someone takes their own life, they leave their loved ones with an agonising legacy of guilt.\n\nThe construction should be avoided where there is an easy fix: Each student should bring their homework can easily become Students should bring their homework. But with someone, everyone or anyone, they is better than either he or she.\n\nSee also ethnic groups, gender, tribe.\n\nindirect speech If you use indirect speech in the past tense, you must change the tense of the speaker’s words appropriately: Before he died, he said, “I abhor the laziness that is commonplace nowadays” becomes Before he died, he said he abhorred the laziness that was commonplace nowadays.\n\nmasculine and feminine Several English nouns have both a masculine and a feminine form, for example:\n\nalumnus, alumna\n\ncompère, commère\n\nFilipino, Filipina\n\nLatino, Latina\n\nman, woman\n\nprince, princess\n\ntestator, testatrix\n\nwidow, widower\n\nnouns acting as verbs Do not force nouns or other parts of speech to act as verbs: A woman who was severely brain-damaged in 2000 would be better put as A woman whose brain was severely damaged in 2000 (unless, remarkably, she was no longer brain-damaged at some later date). See transitive and intransitive verbs.\n\nparticiples Do not use a participle unless you make it clear what it applies to. Here are some examples of confused construction: Proceeding along this line of thought, the cause of the train crash becomes clear.\n\nLooking out from the city’s tallest building, the houses stretch for miles and miles.\n\nplural nouns\n\n1 The -ics words on page 64 (abstract nouns) are plural when preceded by the, or the plus an adjective, or with a possessive.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe dynamics of the dynasty were dysfunctional.\n\nThe complicated politics of Afghanistan have a logic all their own. The athletics take place in London.\n\n2 These are plural:\n\nantics\n\natmospherics\n\nbasics\n\ngraphics\n\nhistrionics\n\nhysterics\n\nstatistics\n\ntactics\n\nSpecifics are discouraged (try details).\n\n3 Data, elite (as a group) and media are plural. So are whereabouts and headquarters.\n\n4 Elections are not always plural. If, as in the United States, several votes (for the presidency, the Senate, the House of Representatives, etc) are held on the same day, it is correct to talk about elections. But in, say, Britain parliamentary polls are usually held on their own, in a single general election.\n\nThe opposition demanded an election is often preferable to The opposition demanded fresh elections. And to write The next presidential elections are due in 2015 suggests there will be more than one presidential poll in that year.\n\n5 The Taliban are plural. The singular is Talib.\n\nMake sure that plural nouns have plural verbs. Too often, in the pages of The Economist, they do not.\n\nKogalym today is one of the few Siberian oil towns which are [not is] almost habitable.\n\nWhat better evidence that snobbery and elitism still hold [not holds] back ordinary British people? — and this in a leader on education.\n\nsingular nouns\n\n1 A government, a party, a company (whether Tesco or Marks & Spencer) and a partnership (Skidmore, Owings & Merrill) are all it and take a singular verb.\n\n2 Brokers are singular.\n\nLegg Mason Wood Walk is preparing a statement.\n\nSo avoid:\n\nstockbrokers Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, bankers JPMorgan Chase or accountants Ernst & Young.\n\n3 Chemical, drug, pension: prefer the singular when referring to:\n\nchemical (not chemicals) companies\n\ndrug- (not drugs) traffickers\n\npension (not pensions) systems\n\n4 Countries are singular, even if their names look plural.\n\nThe Philippines has a congressional system, as does the United States; the Netherlands does not.\n\nThe United Nations is also singular.\n\n5 Abstract nouns that look plural when being used generally, without the definite article, an adjective or a possessive, are singular. For example:\n\nacoustics\n\nathletics\n\nballistics\n\ndynamics\n\neconomics\n\nkinetics\n\nmathematics\n\nmechanics\n\nphysics\n\npolitics\n\npropaganda\n\nstatics\n\nwhen being used generally, without the definite article, are singular. For example:\n\n“Economics is the dismal science” (Carlyle).\n\n“Politics is the art of the possible” (Bismarck).\n\nStatics is a branch of physics.\n\n6 Some games are singular:\n\nbilliards\n\nbowls\n\ndarts\n\nfives\n\nBut teams that take the name of a town, country or university are plural, even when they look singular:\n\nEngland were bowled out for 56.\n\n7 Law and order defies the rules of grammar and is singular.\n\nsplit infinitives A reader of The Economist offers trenchant thoughts on split infinitives or, rather, the reaction against them:\n\n“Sir — The Economist seems increasingly to prefer actively to write in a way destined consistently to irritate and jar, presumably, so as clearly to demonstrate its commitment consistently to avoid splitting the infinitive (The Economist 2017, passim, including main leader, April 22). Sadly, writing in a clear, elegant style would take more effort. Yours, etc.”\n\nWhat to do?\n\nHappy the man who has never been told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless. To see a split infinitive nevertheless annoys some readers, so try to avoid placing a modifier between “to” and the verb in an infinitive. But if moving the modifier would ruin the rhythm, change the meaning or even just put the emphasis in the wrong place, splitting the infinitive is the best option.\n\nDo not merely move the modifier one word to the left: Emerging economies need firmly to curb the build-up of corporate leverage, bad bank loans and foreign debt. (No one needs anything firmly.)\n\nMoving the modifier one word to the right is better: Emerging economies need to curb firmly the build-up of corporate leverage, bad bank loans and foreign debt.\n\nBut sometimes the best thing is to put the modifier right before the verb: Emerging economies need to firmly curb the build-up of corporate leverage, bad bank loans and foreign debt. (A reasonably split infinitive.)\n\nIf you cannot stand splitting the infinitive, rewrite the passage entirely, eg: Emerging economies are suffering from growing corporate leverage, bad bank loans and foreign debt. They need to curb the build-up firmly.\n\nModifiers like “more than” and “nearly” must often go before the verb. So do not write Its budget is expected more than to double, but rather Its budget is expected to more than double.\n\nsubjunctive Use the subjunctive properly. If you are posing a hypothesis contrary to fact, you must use the subjunctive. If I were you … or If Hitler were alive today, he could tell us whether he kept a diary.\n\nIf the hypothesis may or may not be true, you do not use the subjunctive. If this diary is not Hitler’s, we shall be glad we did not publish it.\n\nIf you have would in the main clause, you must use the subjunctive in the if clause. If you were to disregard this rule, you would make a fool of yourself.\n\nIt is common nowadays to use the subjunctive in such constructions as:\n\nHe demanded that the Russians withdraw.\n\nThey insisted that the Americans also move back.\n\nThe referee suggested both sides cool it.\n\nIn soccer it is necessary that everyone remain civil.\n\nThis construction is correct, and has always been used in America,\n\nwhence it has recrossed the Atlantic. In Britain, though, it fell into disuse some time ago except in more formal contexts:\n\nI command the prisoner be summoned.\n\nI beg that the motion be put to the house.\n\nIn British English, but not in American, a better course is to insert the word should:\n\nHe demanded that the Russians should withdraw.\n\nThe Americans should also move back.\n\nBoth sides should cool it.\n\nEveryone should remain civil.\n\nAlternatively (and best of all), some of the sentences could be rephrased:\n\nHe asked the Russians to withdraw.\n\nIt is necessary for everyone to remain civil.\n\nSee also may and might.\n\ntenses Any account of events that have taken place must use a past tense. Yet newspaper articles may have greater immediacy if they use the present or future tenses where appropriate.\n\nThe perfect and pluperfect tenses also serve a purpose, often making accounts more pointed, and so more interesting. Here are a few rough rules:\n\n1 If you use the past simple (aorist) tense, put a time or date to the event: He died on April 11th.\n\n2 If you cannot, or do not want to, pin down the occasion in this way, use the perfect tense: He has died, or the present, He is dead. These imply continuance.\n\n3 The pluperfect should be used for events that punctuate past continuance: He grew up in post-war Germany, where he had seen the benefits of hard work.\n\nSo does the imperfect tense: He was a long time dying.\n\nSee also may and might.\n\nground rules Just as house rules are the rules of the particular house, so ground rules are the rules of the particular ground (or grounds). They are not basic or general rules.\n\nhalve is a transitive verb, so deficits can double but not halve. They must be halved or fall by half.\n\nhaver means to talk nonsense, not dither, swither or waver.\n\nhealth care The American system of health care (adjective, health-care) for the poor is Medicaid, and for the elderly is Medicare. Canada’s national health-care system is also called Medicare.\n\nhealthy If you think something is desirable or good, say so. Do not call it healthy.\n\nheresy see apostasy.\n\nheteronym see homograph, homophone.\n\nhistoric, historical Historic is best reserved for objects, events, eras and so on that may come to be considered notable in history (a judgment, incidentally, often made swiftly and implausibly by journalists). Historical should be used to mean relating to history, associated with it or derived from it.\n\nhoards, hordes Few secreted treasures or stashes of things like food and money being kept to guard against privation (hoards) are multitudes on the move (hordes).\n\nHobson’s choice is not the lesser of two evils; it is no choice at all.\n\nholistic properly refers to a theory developed by Jan Smuts, who argued that, through creative evolution, nature tended to form wholes greater than the sum of the parts. If this is not what you mean by holistic, you would probably be wise to avoid it.\n\nhomeland Although it is now used as a synonym for the United States’ domestic territory, your homeland is your native land, your motherland or even your fatherland.\n\nhomogeneous, homogenous Homogeneous means of the same kind or nature. Homogenous means similar because of common descent. The word you will almost always want to use is homogeneous.\n\nhomograph, homophone Homographs are words with the same spelling but different meanings and sometimes different pronunciations. If they are spelt and pronounced the same they are also homonyms: bear (animal), bear (carry); like (similar), like (be fond of); stalk (part of a plant), stalk (to follow someone or something). If they are spelt the same but pronounced differently they are also heteronyms: content (happy), content (subject matter); entrance (way in), entrance (charm); rebel (to resist or fight against authority), rebel (someone who rebels).\n\nHomophones are words that are pronounced the same regardless of how they are spelt and their meaning: baited (food put on a hook or trap), bated (diminished, restrained); birth (the process of bearing children); berth (somewhere to sleep in a ship, train etc); heroin (a Class A drug), heroine (a courageous woman).\n\nhomonym see above.\n\nhomosexual see gender.\n\nhopefully Some authorities say it is pedantic and outmoded to object to the use of hopefully to mean it is hoped that. The practice originated in America, where English has been much influenced by German immigrants, who found the language of their new country had only one adverb to serve for both hoffnungsvoll, meaning full of hope, and hoffentlich, which can mean let’s hope so. In The Economist, however, by all means begin an article hopefully, but do not write: Hopefully, it will be finished by Wednesday. Try with luck, if all goes well, it is hoped that…\n\nhorrible words Nothing betrays the lazy writer faster than fly-blown and horrible words used in the belief that they are snappy, trendy or cool. If you find yourself using any of the following vogue words, you should stop and ask yourself whether it is the best word for the job, whether you would have used it in the same context five or ten years ago, and if not why not:\n\naddress meaning answer, deal with, attend to, look at\n\nBrits\n\nchattering classes\n\ncommit to (meaning commit yourself to)\n\nfacilitate\n\nfamously: usually redundant, nearly always irritating\n\nfocus: all the world’s a stage, not a lens\n\ngrow the business\n\nguesstimate\n\nhistoric: let historians, not contemporary commentators, be the judge\n\niconic\n\nimpact (meaning affect)\n\nindividual: fine as an adjective and occasionally as a noun, but increasingly favoured by the wooden-tongued as a longer synonym for man, woman or person\n\ninform, when used as a pretentious alternative to influence\n\ninnovative\n\nkids\n\nlikely (meaning probably, rather than probable)\n\nlooking to (meaning intending to)\n\nmeaningful\n\nmetrosexual\n\nparadigm\n\nparticipate in — use take part in, with more words but fewer syllables\n\nposter child\n\nprestigious\n\nproactive\n\nprocess — a word properly applied to attempts to bring about peace, because they are meant to be evolutionary, but now often used in place of talks\n\nrack up (profits, etc)\n\nreductive\n\nrelationship — relations can nearly always do the job\n\nreputational\n\nresources, especially human resources, which may be personnel, staff or just people\n\nsavvy\n\nsegue\n\nshowcase (meaning display)\n\nsource (meaning obtain)\n\nsupportive — helpful?\n\ntarget — if you are tempted to target your efforts, try to direct them instead\n\ntransparency — openness?\n\nwannabes\n\nSuch words should not be banned, but if you find yourself using them only because you hear others using them, not because they are the most appropriate ones in the context, you should avoid them.\n\nSee also euphemisms, grammar (turning nouns to verbs), journalese and slang.\n\nhyphens There is no firm rule to help you decide which words are run together, hyphenated or left separate. If in doubt, consult a dictionary. Do not overdo the literary device of hyphenating words that are not usually linked: the stringing-together-of-lots-and-lot"
