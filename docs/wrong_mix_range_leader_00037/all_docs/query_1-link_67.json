        "text": "PhD-thesis, 2018\n\nBy Merijn Oudenampsen\n\nThe observation that a significant rupture occurred in Dutch political culture at the turn of the century is by now seen as one of the tedious truisms of the public debate. A country that perceived itself as a beacon of tolerance and progressivism quite rapidly became part of the European vanguard of the political revival of nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment. The meteoric rise and dramatic assassination of the right-wing populist politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002 resulted in a stunning election victory of his party List Pim Fortuyn (LPF). It became the second largest party out of the blue, winning 17 percent of the vote in what is commonly called ‘the Fortuyn revolt’. Ever since, national identity, immigration, and law and order have been the dominant themes in Dutch public debate. It set the stage for the Dutch culture wars, pitting conservative defenders of restrictive immigration and integration policies against prudent progressives. The central question of this book is how to make sense of this shift in ideological terms. So far, the dominant frame in seeking to understand the twenty-first century political turnaround in the Netherlands has been that of (right-wing) populism; a focus that foregrounds style, technique and rhetoric, but undervalues ideas. Dutch populist leaders such as Pim Fortuyn and Geert Wilders were seen above all, as savvy political entrepreneurs expressing the ignored concerns of a marginalized electorate, but have less frequently been analysed in terms of their political ideas, as part of a broader intellectual movement. Not the head but the underbelly, not ideas but the empirical realities of ‘the man on the street’ were presumed to be the decisive factors, reinforced by the newfound power of the media and the personal charisma of the populist leader. This study seeks to cast a wider conceptual net than what is common in existing scholarly accounts. I argue that political leaders such as Frits Bolkestein, Pim Fortuyn, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Geert Wilders are only the most visible exponents of a broader conservative political and intellectual tendency that I refer to as the Dutch New Right. This analytical move might seem unorthodox, since the New Right is not a household name in the Netherlands. The term ‘New Right’ came into use in the US and the UK to describe conservative movements that emerged in parallel with – and partly in response to – the rise of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s. Most prominently, the politics of Thatcher and Reagan are associated with the term. The newness of New Right, on the one hand, lies in the combination of a free market strand and a culturally conservative strand. The ideology of the New Right is a complex and often contradictory fusion of neoliberal and (neo)conservative ideas. The central thesis of this book is that the swing to the right in the Netherlands can be understood along similar lines, as a belated iteration of the New Right backlash that occurred overseas....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nIn the past 20 years, a wave of right-wing populist movements has swept over Europe, changing the face of European politics. The Netherlands has been one of the more iconic countries to partake in this shift. Known internationally as an emblem of progressivism and tolerance, the country soon became a frontrunner in the revival of nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiment. This is the first study to offer an extensive engagement with the ideas behind the Dutch swing to the right. The emergence of Dutch populism, this book shows, formed an integral part of a broader conservative tendency, identified as the Dutch New Right. In the US and the UK, the term New Right has been used to describe conservative backlash movements that arose in opposition to the progressive movements of the 1960s. The Dutch swing to the right, this book argues, formed a belated iteration of the New Right backlash that occurred overseas.\n\nDownload\n\nIn review\n\nThe last decade saw the rapid emergence of the Dutch New Right, leading to a significant break in Dutch political culture. The nature of this break remains contested. Some argue it should be seen as a conservative restoration, an attempt to turn back time; others stress the progressive nature of the revolt, depicted as an attempt to bolster Dutch progressive values with respect to conservative Muslim immigrants. In this article, an alternative interpretation is offered: I argue that the Dutch New Right has developed a new, mutated form of conservatism in the Netherlands. It has done so firstly by borrowing and adapting ideas from American neoconservatism and secondly by absorbing in its programme some of the most important progressive attainments emanating from the Dutch sixties and seventies. Despite these progressive incorporations, the programme of the New Right is nonetheless conservative in character and effect. To qualify the content of this new conservative politics, I propose to use the term postprogressive, suggesting some lines of continuity and affinity with the progressive project, while at the same time, a wide-ranging rupture is implied. This postprogressive conservatism can be reduced to two elements: 1) a paradoxical incorporation of a select set of progressive values – mainly women’s rights, gay rights, secularism and individualism – which are subsequently culturalised and historicised; 2) a concerted conservative attack on the progressive consensus on a range of other terrains, such as environmental policy, internationalism, cultural policy, the economy, labour relations and the work ethic, development aid, terrorism, crime, immigration and social policy.\n\nDownload\n\nIn: Wodak, Khosravinik & Mral (eds.) Right-wing populism in Europe, London: Bloomsbury 2013, pp 191-208.\n\nIn these last ten years the Netherlands has experienced a dramatic swing to the Right. Long considered the epitome of tolerance and liberalism, the country now finds itself at the forefront of the political revival of nationalist and anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe. The motor behind this remarkable turnaround is the spectacular rise of right-wing populism since the 1990s, an ascendancy that reached yet a new climax with the 2010 elections, which resulted in a resounding victory for the right-wing populist and anti-Islamist Freedom Party (PVV) of Geert Wilders. The election was followed by the formation of a minority government of right-wing Liberals (VVD) and Christian Democrats (CDA), dependent on the strategic support of the PVV to obtain a parliamentary majority. It is generally seen as the most right-wing government in Dutch post-war history.\n\nDownload\n\nEuropean Journal of Political Research, 1992\n\nAbstract. The Extreme Right in the Netherlands has always been relatively weak; there was neither a strong ideological right-wing tradition nor a solid social base. Moreover, the Extreme Right has always been fragmented and divided. Historically, three varieties can be distinguished: theocratic Protestantism (‘Very Old Right’), neo-fascism or national socialism (‘Old Right’) and ethnocentric nationalism (‘New Right’). The third variety, since 1984 represented by the Centre Democrats, has gained some ground in recent years. Though reliable data are still scarce, it seems plausible that the party has attracted not only ideologically motivated extremists but also ‘protest voters’, mainly in older urban working class areas.\n\nDownload\n\nThe interview was conducted within the framework of the POPULISMUS research project on 26 September 2014 at the University of Groningen.

It discusses Scheffer's original provocative newspaper piece, 'The multicultural drama' and how its arguments evolved in his book, Land of Arrival (translated into English as Immigrant Nations), in the context of the overall transformation of the Netherlands from a country of emigration into a country of immigration. It concludes with some reflections on the expression of many of these concerns as a new kind of 'civilizing offensive' in the context of the effects of globalisation.\n\nDownload\n\nMuis, Jasper (2015). The rise and demise of the Dutch extreme right. Discursive opportunities and support for the Center Democrats in the 1990s., 2015\n\nThis article seeks to explain why the Dutch extreme-right party, Centre Democrats (CD), never succeeded in breaking out of its marginal position. It argues that, in addition to accounting for fluctuations in the amount of electoral support, scholars should also analyze the degree to which extreme right parties are able to express their views in the mass media. Supply-side explanations are extended with the argument that latent political opportunities need to manifest themselves in the public debate in order to become relevant. Relying on longitudinal data derived from political claims analysis and opinion polls, this article shows that negative public reactions significantly eroded the electoral attractiveness of the extreme-right party. In contrast, when one’s goal is to achieve mass media access, the results reveal that any publicity is favorable publicity: public criticism enhanced the party’s access to the public debate. Furthermore, rising support in opinion polls also led to more public claim making. Remarkably, however, the extreme-right party did not increase its electoral support when it made itself more prominently heard in the mass media. Thus, the CD appeared trapped in a spiral of discursive weakness.\n\nDownload"
