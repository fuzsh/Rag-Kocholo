        "text": "$27.99 $30.99 in Canada Why do some people succeed far more than others? There is a story that is usually told about extremely successful people, a story that focuses on intelligence and ambition. In Outliers Malcolm Gladwell argues that the true story of success is very different, and that if we want to understand how some people thrive, we should spend more time looking around them — at such things as their family, their birthplace, or even their birth date. The story of success is more complex — and a lot more interesting — than it initially appears. Outliers explains what the Beatles and Bill Gates have in common, the extraordinary success of Asians at math, the hidden advantages of star athletes, why all top New York lawyers have the same résumé, and the reason you've never heard of the world's smartest man — all in terms of gen- eration, family, culture, and class. It matters what year you were born ifyou want to be a Silicon Valley billionaire, Gladwell argues, and it matters where you were born if you want to be a suc- cessful pilot. The lives of outliers — those people whose achievements fall outside normal experi- ence — follow a peculiar and unexpected logic, and in making that logicplain Gladwell presents a fascinating and provocative blueprint for making the most of human potential.
