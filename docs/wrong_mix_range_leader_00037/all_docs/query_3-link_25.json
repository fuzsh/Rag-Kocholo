The district. On March the 3rd, 1904.\n\nNL: So this was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nYM: This was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was in the part of Hungary\n\nwhich was the so-called \"religious\" Jewish part, where we spoke Yiddish and, eh, automatically\n\nwe learned two, and some of us even three languages when we were small children. Yiddish\n\nwas spoken inside as soon as we closed the door.\n\nFrom the inside we spoke Yiddish only. As soon as we were on the outside, the language was Hungarian and in some cases the Russian,\n\nMaloruski, the Ukrainian language.\n\nNL: May I ask, why Russian? What was the Russian influence there?\n\nYM: Because there, at that part of Hungary, were many, many Ukrainians who spoke Russian, and the pressure was so big, even 50\n\nand 100 years ago, to tear away from mainly Austro-Hungary because they felt that they can't live as nationals. Their culture, their\n\neducation, their music, their everything, is oppressed by the Austrian government. Therefore, they, in their own homes, just as we Jews spoke Yiddish, so they spoke Ukrainian.\n\nThis, then, shows that that was even in many, many years ago a very highly-explosive part of Hungary. If they could have, probably, they would have torn away the\n\npart of Hungary from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in those days. This brought another interesting fact. They were completely influenced by the Church. Some of them were\n\nCatholics; most of them (the non-Jewish part, we're talking about) were Greek Catholics.\n\nNL: Greek Orthodox.\n\nYM: Greek Orthodox. In both cases, the Church had an immense...eh...\n\n...power and influence over them, and even when I was a small child, I started to\n\ngo to heder at the age of three-and-a-half. When I was four and five, I knew very well what it means to be attacked by the non-Jewish students.\n\nThey waited for us with sticks and all kinds of things, and we learned to a degree how to fight them as well. This\n\nis maybe an interesting point from a point of view when we ask ourselves, how did the things get to the point where they started in 1938 or '39 in Hungary? But\n\nthey really and actually started in 1917 and '18 on a big scale when Horthy and his, eh, people, came and killed plenty of Jews in Hungary proper, and whoever could take advantage of Jews,\n\ndid.\n\nNL: Yes, we want to come to that, because that's an extremely important chapter. This was part of the reaction against the Béla Kun Communist regime, I believe. Now, can you\n\nsay a little more about your childhood, because this would be so interesting.\n\nYM: I, eh, was born in an extremely Orthodox religious family. My upbringing was the old type of Yiddish upbringing. Eh, and I was four-and-a-half years old, probably, surely\n\nnot five yet, I started to learn Chumesh [Pentateuch], Chumesh Midrasheh[Post-Talmudic literature], eh, it wasn't a question of, do I want it? There were no considerations as far as\n\npsychological questions. This was it, and this is the way we grew up.\n\nNL: Can you tell me, eh, excuse me, par-, I think I interrupted you\n\nYM:We were seven children at home,\n\nThree sisters and four brothers, of whom by today only one is alive, who came here in 1913, probably the last boat which reached the United...\n\nThat's my oldest sister who lives in Philadelphia. Her name is Mrs. Helen Borish, B-O-R-I-S-H.\n\nThe sister who followed her was Esther. She was married to Yaakov Deutsch. One sister, the youngest sister, died.\n\nShe was never married. She got what was prevalent in those days in that part of the world, galoppierende Tuberkulose\n\n[consumption] and died before the age of 20. Her name was Rivka.\n\nMy brothers, the younger brother, is Yoel. The one following him is Yisrael Dov, or Srulbear, as we called him, and the youngest brother was David.\n\nNow, my sister's children. Did I give you the name of Esther?\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM: Yes, I did. Esther had three children.These children are, all three of them, in Israel, are settled there, and there they live.\n\nYoel, of course, Rivka had no children, Yoel was the first Associate Chief Cantor of the congregation in Zagreb.\n\nHe was professor of Hebrew Studies. The younger brother was also a cantor; they were both my pupils.\n\nIn Chazanut [studies of religious chants], I mean. We all went to Yeshivot, and the youngest brother, David, David Mandel, died in Israel in 1949. His, he already got his doctoral degree from the university in Budapest, with a yellow star on his lapel. He was a graduate of the seminary in Budapest, and, was a graduate of the university in Budapest.\n\nNL: What a distinguished family!\n\nYM: Interesting, maybe--he was a graduate of the, Hebrew gymnasium in Munkács, and maybe one distinction which does not apply, maybe, to too many people, is that after he\n\nwent from Budapest because we were so very active in Zionist works--I wasn't home--he was engaged to a young lady by the name Hava Eisdorfer. Their wedding was supposed to take\n\nplace in June in my Temple in Budapest. I wasn't home, of course, I was in labor camp already in 1940-1944, and it never took place, the wedding never took place, of course, but he went\n\nwith a Kasztner group...\n\nNL: Ah, yes.\n\nYM:\n\n...to, eh, Bergen-Belsen. Not only that, because of my activity in Budapest, while I was there for ten years, my family was called upon to take them along in my absence...\n\nNL: Mmm\n\nYM:\n\n...and that was, that was wonderful.\n\nNL: Oh yeh.\n\nYM:\n\nThese people who you read in this...\n\nNL: Yes...\n\nYM:\n\n...Yuri Brown story, they thought of it, because my brother was just as active. And my brother came to Israel after Bergen-Belsen. And after all this, and taught for awhile in\n\nGymnasium HaRaealit in Haifa and had an appointment to teach at the university in Yerushalaim [Jerusalem] of all things, Hebrew literature. And, he never reached that day,\n\nbecause he died in Israel in April of 1949.\n\nNL:\n\nNow, let's go back a bit. I'd like to know a little about your parents. Can you tell me about father and mother?\n\nYM:\n\nFather grew up, probably, the same way as I did. He probably started heder [chuckles] when he was the age of three. He was a real Talmid chochem\n\n[scholar of Talmud]. Very knowledgeable Jew. He also spoke these languages, I have mentioned before, perfectly. He had, quite a bit of knowledge in, in not only\n\nSifrut [oral law] and, Talmud and Chumash and so on, but he was a Talmid chochem. As a matter of fact, he was not, though he was an ordained rabbi by his own\n\nrabbonim who gave him Hatorath Tora, and Hatorat rabbanot, he\n\nnever acted, never was, a professional rabbi, but he\n\npasket shayles\n\n[decided questions] as they\n\nsaid there, and took care of the\n\nYeshuvim\n\n[settlements] all around us, and Avrohom Mandel\n\nwas, eh, quite a\n\nbekovedigge\n\nr [honorable Jew]. My mother...\n\nNL:\n\nDid he, eh, make a living out of teachi\n\nng, or did he have a separate occupation?\n\nYM:\n\nNo, no, he had fields and was in the, he was a farmer...\n\nNL: A farmer...\n\nYM:\n\nAnd I, eh...\n\nNL:\n\nWere Jews able to own land at that time?\n\nYM:\n\nYes. In those days, yes. My father, who was born in '77, I think, 1877. That was\n\nreally the golden period of Hungarian Jews.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYM:\n\nBecause then, it was after '48, after th\n\ne French Revolution and so on. And all\n\nthese countries copied to a degree the French freedom, and so on and so forth.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYEHUDA MANDEL [1-1-5]\n\nFrom the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive\n\nYM:\n\nAnd that expressed itself in the fact as\n\nwell for Jews not to have any restrictions.\n\nJews, as a matter of fact, were allowed to ma\n\nrry non-Jews, for which before they would have\n\nbeen burned on the, you know?\n\nNL: Stake, yes.\n\nYM:\n\nBut in those days there was freedom.\n\nSo, you could buy a house. You could get\n\ninto business, you could, you could own fields and farms and so on.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd so, you grew up on the land.\n\nYM: Yes, absolutely.\n\nNL:\n\nYes. And was the family fairly comfortable, economically...\n\nYM: Yes.\n\nNL:\n\n...or did you have hardships?\n\nYM:\n\nYou have to know, I mean, if I should go into this, I don't know.\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM:\n\nThat in, in that part of Hungary in those days, let's say my days, after 1904, when\n\nI grew up to be at least to understand what's\n\ngoing on, 1910, '11, '12, and '13, '14, and even to\n\n'16, there is a river which was never controlled and never, never, put into shape, so to say, which\n\nevery year brought floods and floods and floods.\n\nNL: Mmm.\n\nYM:\n\nMy father became a poor man, I th\n\nink, between 1910 and 1916. Poor. They\n\nmade out somehow, but they weren't comfortable at the time anymore.\n\nNL:\n\nBut, eh, the land...\n\nYM: The land...\n\nNL:\n\n...was still his, and...\n\nYM: ...belonged...\n\nNL:\n\n...and was he able to recover?\n\nYM:\n\nYes, some of it, and whatever could\n\nbe done with it was done. But comfortable,\n\nhe was not. Before his time, and, of course, my\n\nrecollection doesn't go back to that, all these\n\nland, belonged to my mother's father.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYM:\n\nEh, and presumably he made a very, very\n\ncomfortable living. So that shows that\n\nthere must have come some kind of natural cau\n\nses which made it impossible for them to be\n\ncomfortable anymore. My mother, it may be worthwhile to mention, is the daughter of a man\n\nwho was a teacher in 1830.\n\nknew, of course, how to\n\ndaven\n\n. And I will never forget it. I was maybe eight or nine years old when I davened\n\nin my, in our own congregation at home in Csepa, maariv [evening prayer], on\n\nPesach, Shavuos, Succot, whatever it was. And eh, and there were, there were those\n\nadditional prayers, those inserts, we call them marouvis [evening prayers], lel shamurim\n\n[prayers at Pesach night], and so on and so forth. And I did very well, I, I knew it was no\n\nproblem.\n\nNL: Eight.\n\nYM:When I hear people prepare for the Bar Mitzvah a year or two earlier, I'm just angry, because if we were called and\n\nwe were eight, nine years old, for a maftir [last reading of the Torah], it was no problem. I mean, it was, as a matter of fact the children were called as a\n\nrule, because that was the only kibbud [honor] a boy could get in those days, to be called for a maftir [one who reads concluding verses of\n\nthe Torah portion], because another aliyah he couldn't get; the shevah korim[seven readers] had to be adults\n\n. So, we were the additional, anachron[the last], or a maftir, we could be called too.\n\nNL: This was all very natural in the cycle of your life.\n\nYM: Yeh.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd so your childhood was passed quite happily.\n\nYM: Yes.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd, do you have some memories of the war years? Did your family have to move out? Were any, were there any deprivations?\n\nYM:\n\nNo. In 1914 when the war broke out, as you well know now, I was ten years old. This is just a side line. I remember exactly\n\nthe spot where I read the first announcement of Franz Josef [emperor of Austria/Hungary], who said, \"I have thought it through very carefully.\n\nI have given it all the consideration, and we must step in...\" and so on and so forth, \"the war\". The war years I remember very well because there was terrible pressure on all of us. Because\n\nyou have to know that we lived right underneath the Carpathian Mountains. And the first lines maybe were about 100 km, which is about 60-65 miles away from us. But I remember\n\nparticularly during the war two years, when people who lived at the very end of the Galician part of Austro-Hungary, had to evac-, be evacuated and evacuated, and came to us before\n\nPesach. What part of the war that was, I don't remember any more, but these people, about 60 families, came into our little community before Pesach, and I will never forget it. Everyone\n\nwas put up. At families, my father, zichrono l'bracha [of blessed memory], gave a special, gave special permits to use on that Pesach kitniyot [forbidden food]. He consulted with his\n\nrabbi, and they gave permission not only for matzoh or potatoes or what, but kitniyot. In otherwords, vegetables...\n\nNL: Baked beans\n\nYM: Beans which you wouldn't eat normally.\n\nSo, all these families were put up. I\n\nthink this was repeated in '15, '16, '15 and '16,\n\nbecause as the war went on, either the Russians\n\npushed the Austro-Hungarians back, or the Au\n\nstro-Hungarians pushed the Russians back, but\n\nthe war went on in that part of the world, very close to us.\n\nNL: Very close.\n\nYM: Ya.\n\nNL:\n\nBut you weren't involved in the...\n\nYM:\n\nWe were never evacuated. No.\n\nNL: ...war actually.\n\nYM:\n\nWe had, of course, my mother's brother in particular, you may even know about\n\nhim, Dr. Moishe Bolgar...\n\nNL: The, the...\n\nYM:\n\nBraun, original name. His original name was Moishe Braun. He was a lawyer\n\nby profession, and a first rate Hebrew novelist and\n\nwriter and translator and, so he was at the\n\nbattlefield all the time.\n\nNL: A soldier.\n\nYM:\n\nA soldier. And we were under his, under this pressure that we were terribly\n\nscared for him.\n\nNL: For him.\n\nYM:\n\nHe was like more than an uncle to us.\n\nAnd we constantly were scared. He was\n\nthen, later on during the war he was the, the\n\nman responsible for a military newspaper called\n\nManilova\n\n, where he was still in great danger all the time,\n\nbut at least he didn't have to stay in the\n\nfirst line and shoot at someone.\n\nNL:\n\nYes, and, the end of the war meant\n\nchanges for your community. The peace\n\ntreaty. What were the territorial changes that involved your town?\n\nYM:\n\nNo, first of all, before it came to the\n\nvery end and before it was decided that our\n\npart of the world should belong to Czechoslovakia,\n\nor that Czechoslovakia should be called into\n\nbeing at all, there were the--you know that th\n\ne war in Hungary, especially where we belonged\n\nto, that part of Hungary came to an end by\n\nthe White Revolution, White Flower Revolution, I\n\ndon't know how that Flower is called, but the Socialist movement became stronger, later on the\n\nad those little slats made out of wood. This is\n\nthe way shoes were manufactured instead of\n\nsoles. So, this, these are my impressions. Of course, what can a thirteen-year-old know...\n\nNL: Yes, yes.\n\nYM:\n\n...in this kind of a boiling world.\n\nNL:\n\nYes, did your parents ever talk to\n\nyou or to the children about the Bolshevik\n\nperiod of occupation?\n\nYM:\n\nIn my parents' mind, and I have to say this quite honestly, rightly or wrongly,\n\nBolsheviks, because we were born, grew up, and liv\n\ned in a different society, whatever was Red,\n\nwhatever was Bolshevik, was poison. They just c\n\nouldn't, they couldn't even get to the point, I'm\n\nafraid, to consider it.\n\nNL:\n\nBut this was how most Jews felt, I believe.\n\nYM:\n\nI would say so, yes.\n\nNL:\n\nYes, there was a lot to fear.\n\nYM:\n\nYes, a lot to fear.\n\nNL:\n\nA lot to fear.\n\nYM:\n\nA. The financial standings of ev\n\neryone were in danger, and second, the\n\nreligion...\n\nNL: Anti-religious...\n\nYM:\n\n...which was their life...\n\nNL: Of course.\n\nYM:\n\n...which was their, their mainstay, was constantly in danger.\n\nNL: Of course.\n\nYM:\n\nAnd we heard that after, I don't know, we knew about all the troubles, let's say\n\nthe, the Russian Czar and his\n\nfamily and his generals gave to the Jewish population of Russia,\n\nwe knew about all that, and we were\n\nsorry that they were killed. But\n\nFonya-ganef\n\n[Russian\n\nthief], as we called him in those days, and as he was called by the people who came to us, eh, we\n\nknew very well what happened to them, a\n\nnd we couldn't really, so to say, say\n\nkaddish\n\nafter\n\nthem. We were sorry as human beings that they were killed, but we knew that religion is out,\n\nand no more\n\nheder\n\n, and no more\n\nMishnah\n\n, and no more, no more, eh...\n\nNL:\n\nNo more property, no more private property.\n\nYM:\n\nRight, yes, no more private property.\n\nNL:\n\nA lot to fear.\n\nYM:\n\nSo from this you will see what our em\n\notions and even logical considerations\n\nwere. Now my father, or mother, never sat down with us to have a political...\n\nNL: Discussion.\n\nYM: Political discussion.\n\nNL: [chuckles]\n\nYM:\n\nI mean in those days. Among the boys\n\nI was the oldest, but my oldest sister\n\nwasn't even there. She left Europe in 1913.\n\nMy younger sister got married and she didn't live in\n\nthe same place where we lived. I really did not\n\nattend too many, and didn't even have a chance,\n\nto get the feeling--just what I heard superficia\n\nlly--and, of course, if Reb Moishe or Reb Chaim\n\nsaid that this is terrible, I had to think it is terrible.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd, and it was. It was. Uh, now\n\nin 1918, 1919, what was the political setup\n\nthat affected your town, Cantor?\n\nYM:\n\nIn 1918 and 1919, as I said, our part of\n\nthe land changed owners, so to say, many\n\nmany times, but in '19 I went to Nagyhalasz, to my first\n\nyeshiva\n\n. Nagyhalasz at the time,\n\nalready, was Czechoslovakia. And there was a\n\ngreat relaxation. Our village was divided by\n\nthe, rather, about four kilometers from our v\n\nillage we had a river called Tisza, which comes\n\nfrom the high, up in the...\n\nNL: Carpathian.\n\nYM:\n\nCarpathian mountains. And, eh, flew\n\nthrough, close by to our river, to our\n\nvillage. When I used to come home in the first\n\nz'man--z'man\n\nis a semester, six months, you\n\nknow--when I used to come home, in '19 or maybe '20, from Nagyhalasz, for a\n\nShabbes\n\nto be\n\nhome with my parents, we didn't need anything else, but a permit from the, Czechoslovakian\n\npolice, let's say, or\n\nGendarmerie\n\n, or whatever it was, that we are citizens or...\n\nNL: Residents.\n\nYM:\n\n...residents of this and this village.\n\nAnd even if we were stopped, we could pass.\n\nNL:\n\nBut your parents were technically within Hungary.\n\nYM:\n\nTechnically, they were within Hungary, ye\n\ns. Because it wasn't decided that this\n\nwouldn't be Hungary any more at the time. When\n\nthen this other side of the Tisza was, eh,\n\nadopted to be also Czechoslovakia up to a certain point, then things relaxed in our village as\n\nwell. But in Nagyhalasz, really we didn't ha\n\nve this when I got there anymore, because\n\nNagyhalasz, as such, because it was on the right\n\nhand side of this river, immediately was\n\ndecided that this will be part of Podkarpatska\n\nRus, yes, but it will belong as such, eh, to the\n\nCzechoslovakia.\n\nYM: Czechoslovakia. Now you know th\n\nat Czechoslovakia consisted of\n\nPodkarpatska Rus, Slovakia, Moravia, eh...\n\nNL: Bohemia.\n\nYM:\n\nBohemia and so on. So, therefore, this wa\n\ns just a part of it. Where we lived was\n\npart of Podkarpatska Rus, all of it belongs, now, of course, to Russia.\n\nNL:\n\nTo Russia, yes. And did you live with a private family, or did you live in the\n\nyeshiva\n\n? Was there a dormitory?\n\nYM:\n\nThis again is a very interesting story.\n\nIch hab gegessen cost-teg\n\n[\"to support\n\nlearning\" families provided meals for\n\nYeshiva\n\nstudents on different days], if you know what\n\nthat is.\n\nNL: Yes, yes.\n\nYM:\n\nI eat a...\n\nNL: Eating days.\n\nYM:\n\nRight. Every day at a diffe\n\nrent place. I was just extremely lucky that my father,\n\nas a, a, as the owner of some...\n\nNL: Land.\n\nYM:\n\n...land and so on had cattle to sell, and\n\nhad sheep to sell, and had to buy things\n\nfrom, eh, materials for the farm and so on, so he\n\nhad these friends, and I, just by coincidence,\n\nused to have my\n\ncost-teg\n\nat these families.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYM:\n\nAs a matter of fact, my sister-in-law,\n\nChava, who lives in Israel, her father was\n\nan associate in some way of my father, and I had a\n\ncost-tug\n\n[singular], a day, to get my lunch or\n\ndinner, whatever in their house.\n\nNL: Ah.\n\nYM:\n\nSo that I knew Chava Eizdorfer even before she was born.\n\nNL:\n\n[Laughs]. Very interesting. And this was a large\n\nyeshiva\n\n?\n\nYM:\n\nIt wasn't a large\n\nyeshiva\n\n; it was a much bigger town than ours. As I say it was\n\nthe capital of this district, Ungvar, and, eh, I will say in Nagyhalasz, at the time probably have\n\nlived 350 Jewish, 400 Jewish families. So that\n\nwas already a big town. Nagyhalasz had a\n\nbeautiful, big synagogue, of\n\ncourse Orthodox, two, three\n\nbetai medrushim\n\n[class-rooms], and it\n\nwas a nice, nice town. The\n\nyeshiva\n\nas such was never big, and was never, there was never a\n\nyeshiva\n\nin Nagyhalasz in spite of the fact that the great Shmelcha Klein was the, the\n\nRov\n\nin Nagyhalasz, it was never a yeshiva\n\ntown until Yosef Nehemiah Korenitz,\n\nzichron l'bracha\n\n, came\n\nand organized this\n\nyeshiva\n\n.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYM:\n\nWhich consisted always\n\nof about 30, 35, less than 40\n\nbocherim\n\n[young men].\n\nAnd mainly youngsters.\n\nNL: Youngsters.\n\nYM:\n\nYoung people, 14, 15, I myself studied in\n\nNagyhalasz for two-and-a-half years;\n\nafter that I already went to Ungvar, which wa\n\ns the capital city of Podkarpatska Rus, Uzhgorod,\n\ntoday it's called Uzhgorod. Eh, and the\n\nRov\n\nwas the chief rabbi of Podkarpatska Rus, Erbavram\n\nYosef Greenwald, he was a\n\nhaver\n\nof my father in his father's\n\nyeshiva\n\nin Ust. So, I went to this\n\nyeshiva\n\nto study. After that, in other words,\n\nwe didn't spend, I don't know, the time in\n\nNagyhalasz until we became ready for, for anything like\n\nhora'ah\n\n[teaching], or whatever it was.\n\nWe studied and got a good basic education there.\n\nI myself was there, I think, for five\n\nz'man\n\n[semesters], that means two-and-a-half years.\n\nAfter that I went to--started to study in Ungvar.\n\nNL:\n\nOh my. And, were there any secular studies involved, or...\n\nYM: No.\n\nNL:\n\n...did you have a tutor for those?\n\nYM:\n\nIn my, of course, in my village you couldn't, even if you did want to...\n\nNL: No.\n\nYM:\n\n...go further than the fourth, maximum the sixth grade.\n\nNL: Grade.\n\nYM:\n\nEh, so that when I came to Nagyhalasz and my uncle--this uncle which I\n\nmentioned before, was a great influence--to ge\n\nt some secular knowledge as well, I studied\n\nprivately. At the end of the\n\nseason we took our exams in a private way. Let me mention\n\nsomething very interesting. I never in my lif\n\ne had any exercises, any kind of painting or\n\ndrawing; that was just strange to me.\n\nFarbrenggen di tzait oif a solcha narishkaiten\n\n[to spend\n\ntime on such nonsense], who did it? So, at th\n\ne end, when I was prepared, ya, in Nagyhalasz,\n\nthere was the middle\n\nshule\n\n, and the [unclear] it was called, where you could get above the\n\nelementary school four grades, four years. So, I wanted to have at least get that what I could. I\n\ndon't know if my father ever discussed this question with, eh...\n\nNL: Your uncle.\n\nYM:\n\nNo, my uncle he did, but with my rebbe.\n\nNL: Oh.\n\nYM:\n\nYes, you know, that was a big thing.\n\nNL: Of course.\n\nYM:\n\nHachutzoniyot\n\n[outside studies] wasn't simple\n\nto study. I don't know if he did or\n\nif he didn't, but he advised me, probably at the influence of my uncle, to go to A, B, C, D\n\nteachers, prepare with them, and at the end they\n\ngave us then, we went\n\nto school, that was a day\n\nassigned for...\n\nNL: Examinations.\n\nYM:\n\nFor private examinations. So, the man who gave me the exam in mathematics,\n\nand, eh,\n\ntziur\n\n, eh,\n\nNL: Penmanship?\n\nYM:\n\nNo, eh, not penmanship, but you know, to...\n\nNL: Composition?\n\nYM:\n\nTo eh, to draw something.\n\nNL: Oh.\n\nYM: Drawing.\n\nNL: Drawing.\n\nYM:\n\nYou know, so he said, look, you did quite\n\nwell in mathematics. You did terribly,\n\nno, he said, you did terribly in this, my departme\n\nnt and if you will pass mathematics, well, fine,\n\nI will let you pass. If not, [laughs] you won't pass!\n\nNL: [Laughs]\n\nYM: [Laughs]\n\nNL:\n\nYah, interesting. So now, you stayed in this town for two-and-a-half years...\n\nYM: Two-and-a-half years.\n\nNL: And then?\n\nYM:\n\nThen I went to Ungvar.\n\nNL: That's...\n\nYM: U-N-G-V-A-R.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd that was in Hungary?\n\nYM:\n\nThat was, that was, that was origina\n\nlly, originally it was Hungary. At the time\n\nwhen I went there it was the capital city of Podkarpatska Rus.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd how do you spell Podkarpatska Rus?\n\nYM:\n\nP-O-D, Karpatska as you spell, it's a separate word, of course.\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nKar-Pat-Ski, just as I say it phonetically, Russ, R-U-S-S.\n\nAnd this was the\n\ncapital city of Podkarpatska Rus. In, at the time, 13, 14, two-and-a-half years, I was about\n\nseventeen, eighteen years of age, and I got to U\n\nngvar, maybe even less, I don't know, I stayed in\n\nUngvar for four-and-a-half years.\n\nNL: Still studying?\n\nYM:\n\nStill studying, and only this.\n\nNL: At the\n\nyeshiva\n\nthere?\n\nYM: At the\n\nyeshiva\n\n. There was a\n\nyeshiva haramah\n\n, it was a big\n\nyeshiva\n\n. There were\n\n300\n\nbocherim\n\n, and there already it was divided in,\n\neh, divisions and sub-divisions, younger\n\nbocherim\n\nwho studied [unclear] just this.\n\nAs I have mentioned before,\n\nmaidneshiiur\n\n[phonetic]\n\nand so on, so, others who studied up to this a\n\nnd this point, later on others who came up to, I\n\ndon't know, the\n\nhoraah\n\n, who, who stood for the\n\nnisayon\n\n, [exams]\n\npaskan shailles\n\nand so on.\n\nThere was, as I have said, this Erbavram Yosef Greenwald was my father's\n\nhaver\n\n[friend] in his\n\nfather's\n\nyeshiva\n\n, and he was one, he was the chairman of the committee who examined for the\n\nhoraah\n\n.\n\nHoraah\n\n, is you know, all kinds of other things.\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM:\n\nBut among other things it is, eh\n\nissur veheter\n\n, [prohibition permitted] you know,\n\nkashres\n\n[dietary laws], and\n\nShabbes\n\nand\n\nyom tov\n\n[holiday] and so on, so, under his guidance, his\n\nson, who died here already, in Brooklyn, who wa\n\ns his successor later on, I studied with him,\n\nYehoshua Greenwald, and together we were\n\nordained, if I may call it that, to be\n\nrabbonim\n\n, and\n\nto, that was not yet\n\nhaturis rabbonis\n\n[ordination], it was just to\n\npaskan\n\nand to\n\npaskan shailles\n\nin\n\nissur veheter\n\n.\n\nNL: Mmm Hmm.\n\nYM: Up to\n\nsimank\n\n?\n\nfiyot\n\n. That was the way it went.\n\nAnd that's the way, the way it\n\nworked.\n\nNL:\n\nThat was the cycle.\n\nYM:\n\nThe cycle, yes. That was the highest\n\n. That was the most, eh, progress, the\n\nhighest grade, let's say, achieved.\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM:\n\nSo this is what I finished in Ungvar.\n\nFrom Ungvar I was, at the age of 19 and\n\nolder, probably, drafted into the Czech army.\n\n2\n\nPodkarpatska Rus in\n\nColumbia Lippincott Gazetteer\n\n.\n\nNL: I see.\n\nYM:\n\nI think we should stop here and now\n\nand we could probably, ya, and we will...\n\nNL:\n\nWe'll continue, all right, thank you very much, eh.\n\nNL:\n\nWe are continuing the interview with Cantor Mandel, March 3rd, 1982, Nora\n\nLevin interviewing. Cantor Mandel, would you\n\nnow tell us the circumstances under which you,\n\nwent into the Czech army, and your experiences in the army?\n\nYM:\n\nI see, eh...[tape turns off briefly]\n\nYM:\n\nI'm sorry for this interruption. You as\n\nked me to tell you how I got into the Czech\n\narmy? Of course I was drafted and, like anybody else, at the time [phone rings; pause]\n\nNL: All right.\n\nYM:\n\nIs this O.K.? The draft into the Czech\n\narmy went like everywhere else. You had\n\nto register, and, the draft board saw you in March,\n\nfor what I had to come home especially from\n\nmy\n\nyeshiva\n\n, and I was found, eh, able to, to serve.\n\nNL:\n\nWhat year was this?\n\nYM:\n\nThat was in 1924. 1924. I then, wh\n\nen I was drafted, I went back to\n\nyeshiva\n\nfor\n\nmy last exams which I had to go through, and with that I started to look, maybe for a position for\n\nthe High Holy Days, because draftees had to report October the 1st, and on October the 1st, was\n\nI think\n\nerev\n\nor\n\nRosh Hashanah\n\n, I tried out in a few places. Fina\n\nlly I, performed the services, I\n\ndavened\n\n, and served in Ruzomberok [phonetic], th\n\nat's called Russaveit [phonetic] eh, where,\n\neh, a high military official who was a physician w\n\nho had a sanatorium in Detatra [phonetic] told\n\nme I shouldn't be concerned, he will give me pr\n\noper documentation that I got sick on the way to\n\nOlmütz where I had to, mail some letter that I ha\n\nd to report, and this would be accepted. The\n\nonly thing what will happen is that I will have to\n\nserve a few days, and in this case it was ten\n\ndays, after I am finished with my year-and-a-half\n\nof service. It happened that way in 1926 I got\n\nout of this early Czech military\n\nservice. A very interesting thing and maybe worthwhile to\n\nmention just for one reason, how the Czech, who--\n\nhow liberal and wonderful\n\nthey were. In the\n\nCzech army, any candidate for the priesthood, the ra\n\nbbinate, or such, had the right to, after basic\n\ntraining, which everyone had to go through, and that\n\nwas ten weeks, he had the right to report or\n\nto request or was even asked if he wants to\n\ngo to a school, school for military administration\n\nwas one way, the second possibility was a school in\n\ndifferent hospitals to learn and study and\n\nbecome a male nurse. I chose the hospitals, the military nursing, and went through all kinds of\n\ncourses, and finally I was placed in Olmütz\n\n,\n\nwhich is a town, Olomoudz\n\n3\n\n, spelled\n\nA-L-O-M-O-U-D-Z, where I served in their\n\nbasheli\n\n, in, in the hospital there,\n\nNahradisko\n\n, and\n\nNovy Svet\n\n[all phonetic]. Those were the two places wh\n\nere I served. The patients, the soldiers,\n\ncame in the morning, with this kind, that kind, th\n\ne other kind of illnesses, and we always had\n\ntwo doctors. It happened that the commandant of\n\nthe school, who was a, eh, colonel, a Jew, Dr.\n\nGalner, I will never forget his name, he was the\n\nhead of these departments where I served. So,\n\nI served there, and from there I was discharged from the military.\n\nNL:\n\nThat would be 1927?\n\nYM: 1926.\n\nNL: 1926.\n\nYM:\n\n'24 I was taken, '26 I got out. The military service at the time was a\n\nyear-and-a-half, eighteen months. From there, I\n\nwent home and, eh, as every Jewish father, my\n\nfather saw my future very well-established and wa\n\nnted me to get married and so on. I, however,\n\nas I have mentioned before, got infected with mu\n\nsic. It happened partially that when I came in,\n\nas a, as a, into the military, one day a lieuten\n\nant came out to the exercises and asked who could\n\nhelp him out. He was studying a new operetta for the, to be performed on the celebration of\n\nMasaryk's birthday, and he would like some people\n\nwho could sing to help him, and so on. So\n\nmy friends, who knew me from\n\nyeshiva\n\n, they heard me\n\ndaven\n\nthere and all that, said, \"He has a\n\nnice voice.\" So, this man arranged with my co\n\nmmanding officer to see him. I didn't know one\n\nmusical note at the time, not at all. And this\n\nwonderful human being was patient with me and\n\ntaught me\n\nProdanánev\n\n?\n\nsta\n\n, the, the, ten, the Bride, whatever...\n\nNL: Bartered Bride?\n\nYM: Ya.\n\nNL: Smetana.\n\nYM:\n\nSmetana. He taught it to me. Of course I didn't know, I was never in a theater.\n\nNL: Uhm hmn.\n\nYM:\n\nSo, I didn't know when to go out and when\n\nto come in, but he pushed me in and\n\npulled me out, just like, but I knew the music very\n\nwell, because music, a musical ear I had. I\n\nlearned everything by ear.\n\nNL: Interesting.ve\n\nYM:\n\nIn Pressburg, you mean?\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM:\n\nI was, because I made myself availa\n\nble to many, of course you know that the\n\ncongregations in Europe were orga\n\nnized, there was one community, one\n\nkehillah\n\n, but there\n\nwere many small synagogues. And I was always invited to\n\ndaven\n\nhere, to\n\ndaven\n\nthere, and I\n\nwas paid for it. And this money which I made th\n\nere, I could continue my musical studies right\n\nin Pressburg proper, and eventually travel to Vi\n\nenna and pay for my lessons, which I got there.\n\nNL:\n\nThese were vocal lessons?\n\nYM:\n\nVocal lessons, musical lessons. I didn't know, I had no musical training.\n\nNL:\n\nDid you go to a conservatory, or...\n\nYM: Later on.\n\nNL: Later on.\n\nYM:\n\nIn Vienna. In 1926 I finally...\n\nh\n\nTape two, side one:\n\nNL:\n\nThis is a continuation of our interview with Cantor Mandel, tape two, side one.\n\nYes, you were saying about your musical education?\n\nYM:\n\nI got my musical education from 1926, '27, '28, when I already used to go to\n\nVienna and had lessons in Press\n\nburg. In 1928, finally, I went over to Vienna and settled there.\n\nThe way to settle there for me was one way. I\n\nbecame the cantor of a small congregation which\n\nwas supposed to have been built later on, a beautif\n\nul temple and so on, but when I came there,\n\nthe name of it was Montef-Temple Montefiore,\n\nTabelstrasse achtunddreissig\n\n[38]. That's\n\nwhere I functioned as a cantor and got a salary wh\n\nich was very small, but I taught a lot. I had\n\nchildren to prepare for bar mitzvahs and gave\n\nlessons in Talmud and other Hebrew lessons.\n\nAnd this is the way I maintained myself in Vi\n\nenna while I was studying, was the cantor of this\n\nlittle congregation, and did other work, and studied. Now there I was already a student in\n\nNeues Wiener Konservatorium. That was the\n\nplace where I studied music and voice and piano\n\nand so on and so forth.\n\nNL:\n\nYou had the best of both worlds.\n\nYM: Ya, right.\n\nNL:\n\nSo, tell me a little about your impressions of the Jewish community as you\n\nexperienced it.\n\nYM: In Vienna?\n\nNL:\n\nIn Vienna, yes. And whether there\n\nwere any ominous signs of antisemitism or\n\nthe coming of the Nazi movement.\n\nYM:\n\nIf I will tell you that at the time when\n\nI was in Vienna, or a little before that, a\n\nschool was organized there for the training of\n\nBet Sefer L'hazanim Vemorim\n\n[school for cantors\n\nand teachers]. However, in order to understa\n\nnd how it could be organized, you have to know\n\nthat at the time I was fortunate to meet and the\n\nschool was lucky, I think, to have been organized\n\nat the time when the chief rabbi of Austria in Vienna, of course, was Rav Chajes.\n\nNL:\n\nHow is that spelled?\n\nYM: C-H-A-J-E-S.\n\nNL:\n\nOh, very well-known.\n\nYM: Sure.\n\nNL:\n\nYes, of course.\n\nYM:\n\nA person who was not only the great\n\nlamdan\n\n[scholar], was not only the, the,\n\nextremely well educated person in every field,\n\nbut he loved, he was never married, and he\n\nalways told us that we are his family. He used\n\nto come into school. I will never forget it and I\n\nconsider it as a great, eh, as an extraordinary\n\noccurrence in my life. Rav Chajes came in to\n\nschool and at the time he prepared something, either it was\n\nYom Kippur katan\n\nservice or\n\nsomething or\n\nminha\n\nfor weekdays, and he looked at me\n\nand came over to me and got a hold of\n\nmy cheeks and said, \"\n\nSolche bokerim darfen mir haben hier\n\n[We need such young men here!].\"\n\nNL:\n\n[Chuckles] Oh, how beautiful.\n\nYM:\n\nEh, he heard about me, about my b\n\nackground, and so on. But maybe there is\n\nanother thing. After I studied for about two years or something like that in Vienna, in the\n\nmeantime I went to\n\nBet Sefer L'hazanim Vemorim\n\n, went, had these teachings, was the cantor of\n\nthis small congregation, something happened in Vi\n\nenna. The 20th District\n\nof Vienna looked for\n\na\n\nhazan\n\nat the time. And this is again interesti\n\nng maybe for people to know\n\n. It's history. The\n\nVienna congregation, even for its smallest distri\n\nct, like Florence, or it was the name of the 20th\n\nDistrict, was looking for a cantor, so they, in\n\nthose days there was no Cantor's Assembly and\n\nthere was no placement commission, so they put an announcement in the newspapers that\n\nthis-and-this age, and this-and-this quality and\n\nso on and so forth is needed, and whoever felt\n\nlike applying, applied. One hundred and eighteen people applied in 1928, young people, all\n\ntalented, all very fine young upcoming people, and out of this amount of\n\npeople, about 12 were\n\nchosen, not for an audition, but\n\nfür eine Vorprobe\n\n[pre-audition]. That means before they were\n\ngiven permission to perform in synagogue, the\n\nboard, the rabbis, the music educators, the\n\nconductors in the different temples, the cantors\n\nof the different temples, came together in no\n\nother place but the Seitenstetten Temple. And there they listened to him, and each in his\n\ndepartment posed questions to the candidate.\n\nIf the young man passed, then he got permission\n\nto give an audition. I had one of my teachers,\n\nwho was the last chief cantor of the Seitenstetten\n\nTemple in Vienna, Heinrich Fischer, was the ch\n\nief cantor of Vienna because he was Sulzer's\n\nsuccessor. And he arranged for someone from\n\nNuesatz Ujvidék, Novi Sad, in Yugoslavia,\n\nwhere the congregation was also seeking a cantor.\n\nHe arranged for a man by the name of Mr.\n\nGross to be able to attend and listen to the people,\n\nto the twelve or whatever who will hear there.\n\nHe had to have special permission for it, but\n\nhe got it for him. This Mr. Gross came from\n\nGermany, from the Fair, went home, on his way b\n\nack to Yugoslavia he stayed in Vienna, I don't\n\nknow what, and came to this eh...\n\nNL: Examination?\n\nYM:\n\nExamination, yes. He heard me and told my teacher he likes what he heard and\n\nhe would like me to come down to Yugoslavia--Novi\n\nSad--for an audition. At the same time in\n\nmy family there was a lot of trouble. One of\n\nmy sisters who was the immediate child after me,\n\nhad\n\ngaloppierende Tuberkulose\n\n[consumption]. And my parents weren't in good financial\n\nstandings, and I was just sick all the time to he\n\nlp her, to try to get her to the doctor or\n\nsomewhere, where we thought at l\n\neast she would get some help. So I knew I had to get a bigger\n\nposition, more money, and to help. My sister, unf\n\nortunately, died. All my efforts didn't help\n\nher. And, eh...\n\nNL:\n\nWhat was her name?\n\nYM: Rivka.\n\nNL:\n\nThat was Rivka.\n\nYM: Rivka.\n\nNL: Yes.\n\nYM: Eh...\n\nNL:\n\nWere you able to go to Yugoslavia?\n\nYM:\n\nYes. I spoke to my teacher, Chais Fischer,\n\nHazan\n\nFischer, and he arranged for\n\nme at a certain date to go to Yugoslavia. At th\n\ne meantime, one of the rabbis, Dr. Bach in Vienna\n\nwho heard me there, said his son-in-law is th\n\ne rabbi in Groningen, Holla\n\nnd, and he thinks I am\n\nthe ideal candidate for his congregation.\n\nNL: Well well.\n\nYM:\n\nSo, I went to Yugoslavia. I will never fo\n\nrget it. I think it was the 19th of April,\n\n1928. And I gave an audition.\n\nNL:\n\nIt was in Novi Sad?\n\nYM:\n\nIn Novi Sad. N-O-V-I, next word is\n\ncapital S-A-D, Yugoslavia. I say this\n\nbecause I will come back to another point in th\n\ne same place later. So I went down there and I\n\ndavened\n\n...\n\nNL:\n\nExcuse me, before we go there, eh, Ca\n\nntor, did you detect a\n\nny signs of growing\n\nNazi activity in Vienna?\n\nYM:\n\nIn Vienna? Yes, a lot.\n\nNL:\n\nCan you talk about that a bit?\n\nYM:\n\nYes. I used to spend a lot of time in the house of\n\nOberkantor\n\nFischer. And he\n\nhad a son, Alex, who at the time wa\n\ns a student at the university. And one day I--it's very clear in\n\nmy mind--he came home and told his parents in Hungarian, because they came from Hungary\n\nand they still spoke it, \"Please, please, whatever\n\nthe great position of the- eh, to be Sulzer's\n\nsuccessor, whatever money you make here, Fath\n\ner, whatever comfort you have here, please\n\ndon't remain here, because this thing will just fa\n\nll apart. It is impossible. Today in this\n\ndepartment of the university there were fights,\n\nand Jewish people were beaten up and weren't let\n\ngo to listen to the lectures, and so on.\" But you\n\ncould see it even sometimes in the streets and,\n\neh...\n\nNL: For example?\n\nYM:\n\nFor example, eh, men fighting outsi\n\nde and a hundred people around. No one\n\nknew what it's all about, so someone said, \"Yes,\n\nthis man called the other man, 'You dirty Jew.'\n\nAnd this one couldn't take it and started a fight.\"\n\nAnother thing, people used to sit in the coffee\n\nhouses when people used to walk by--and I e\n\nxperienced this myself--and they made just\n\nremarks, \"This is stable, the Jewish stable, where they sit around and they do nothing, they just\n\nlive on our money and our land, and\n\nso on and so forth.\" It was not as organized as it became\n\nlater, but it was...\n\nNL: It was...\n\nYM: Brewing.\n\nNL: And discernible.\n\nYM:\n\nYes. Yes. Definitely yes.\n\nNL:\n\nWas there a Nazi movement yet that you recall? An Austrian Nazi movement?\n\nYM:\n\nI was told that in Oberstreig at\n\nthe time, around Graz and Linz, there were\n\nalready people communicating with German N\n\nazis and, you have to know, and you know it just\n\nas well as I do, that in the middle 20's, already '23, '24, Hitler was already arrested, was already\n\nin jail, and was already writing his eh...\n\nNL:\n\nMein Kampf\n\n.\n\nYM:\n\nMein Kampf\n\nand so on and so forth. And that\n\ninfluenced many people. When I\n\nsee for instance that with, The S\n\nound of Music, I see the same thing what I really experienced.\n\nHow many times did it happen that we wanted to go in Austria especially is eh famous that\n\npeople bought for\n\nAusflüge\n\n, eh... [excursions]\n\nNL: Outings?\n\nYM:\n\nOutings. And how many times were we told, \"Don't go there.\" I don't know\n\nwhere, this place, that place, \"'Cause there there is something preparing for this and this day,\n\nand if a group of young Jews will be seen some\n\nwhere,\" though we didn't look like Jews but, \"eh,\n\nthere will be some trouble. So you better don't make\n\nthat trip.\" You could see it officially. I know that I, for instance, needed working papers, and this small congregation didn't have too\n\nmuch influence, but they tried very hard to ge\n\nt it for me. They couldn't, and I could stay in\n\nVienna only illegally as a cantor, and legally as a\n\nstudent. Because as a student I was allowed to\n\nstay there.\n\nNL:\n\nSo Austrian citizenship was out of the question.\n\nYM:\n\nOh, it was out of the question, sure. It was out of the question.\n\nNL:\n\nDid you have any knowledge of Mayor Luger, was he in office at the time?\n\nYM:\n\nHe was before my time.\n\nNL:\n\nHe was before your time.\n\nYM:\n\nHe was before my time. I know that he was a strong antisemite, but I never\n\nknew him. He was before my time.\n\nNL:\n\nNow was the milieu different in Yugosla\n\nvia at Novi Sad? Was it more benign\n\nwith respect to Jews?\n\nYM:\n\nMaybe it's worth it--yes, it definitely was, because the Serb people who took\n\nover really this part of former Hungary were\n\ndepressed themselves for many many hundreds of\n\nyears, and they knew what it is to live under an oppressive government, and they were very nice\n\nand pleasant, and the Slav people as a rule,\n\nI mean if you are talking about Serbs, about\n\nRuthenians, until they are poisoned...\n\nNL: Instigated...\n\nYM:\n\nInstigated, there's no trouble with them\n\n. I mean you can live with them. I don't\n\nsay they loved Jews. But when you have for in\n\nstance a priest who will tell them nothing else\n\nbut that the Jews killed Christ and this and th\n\nat and the Jews, be careful before Passover,\n\nbecause they need your children's blood for the Passover\n\nmatzah\n\n, then of course, a fire starts.\n\nIt's terrible.\n\nNL:\n\nHow large a Jewish community was in Novi Sad?\n\nYM:\n\nIn Novi Sad there were 1,000 Jews, a\n\nbout 500 families, one temple--beautiful,\n\nwith an organ, with a choir of\n\n40, with, eh, it was a beautiful\n\ncommunity. And I was there for\n\nsix years.\n\nNL:\n\nAnd you were quite happy?\n\nYM:\n\nI was very happy there. As a matter of\n\nfact, I married there my wife, may she\n\nrest in peace, Zahava.\n\nNL:\n\nZahava. What year was that?\n\nYM:\n\nWe got married in 1930. June the 30th.\n\nAnd so you were there until '34.\n\nYM: Yes.\n\nNL:\n\nI see. And it was a very contented time for you?\n\nYM:\n\nA beautiful time in my life.\n\nNL:\n\nWhat was happening to your parents in the meantime? Were they...\n\nYM:\n\nMy father died in 1930, formal death\n\nthat he had heart trouble and lung trouble\n\nand all kinds of things, he died in 1930. At th\n\ne same time in 1930 while being the cantor of, eh,\n\nOberkantor\n\nof Novi Sad, I was elected now without a\n\nny audition, in Vienna again. This time it\n\nwas\n\nder fünfzehnte Bezirk\n\n. It was a very elegant, beautiful, section.\n\nNL:\n\nThat's the fifth...\n\nYM: The fifteenth.\n\nNL: The fifteenth.\n\nYM:\n\nThe Temple of the Fifteenth District. And eh...\n\nNL:\n\nDid you accept?\n\nYM:\n\nI went to Vienna with my wife in 1930.\n\nShe didn't want to leave before--she was\n\na teacher by profession--and she didn't want to leave before the exams are over, so we left in\n\nJune. By the time--the end of June. By the\n\ntime we got to Budapest where she had an uncle,\n\nthis uncle was already at the station, and we want\n\ned to go to Vienna, giving us a telegram from\n\nmy uncle who, I told you before, who went to talk, speak up for me, to intercede.\n\nNL:\n\nWho tried to intercede?\n\nYM:\n\n\"Don't ask questions. Come straight\n\nover.\" And the reason for it was that my\n\nfather died. We were in Budapest on a certain\n\nSunday, and it was the thirtieth or whatever it\n\nwas, the first of July, and my father died Frid\n\nay before, was buried on the same day, because, of\n\ncourse, my uncle wouldn't have done anything else. So I was never at my father's funeral. So\n\nwhen I went home, I sat\n\nshiva\n\nand [unclear]. So, eh...\n\nNL:\n\nDid you return to Novi Sad?\n\nYM:\n\nNo, I went to Vienna and [unclear].\n\nHowever, my appointment in, with\n\nObergeneralstabsrat\n\nBieck, who was the president of th\n\ne congregation, was for the first or\n\nsecond of July. And after the\n\nshiva\n\nit was already the 10th or 8th of\n\nJuly. By the time I got to\n\nVienna it was the 12th of July. And the secret\n\nary, Dr. Löwenherz of the main congregation in\n\nVienna, my--you asked me before about the citizensh\n\nip in Austria--told me when I told him that\n\none of my conditions to come to Vienna is if the congregation, the community, guarantees me\n\nto become a citizen. So he said--I was very young, and he was a middle-aged person, very well-educated--so he told me, \"\n\nMein liebes Kind, die Staatsbürgerschaft können wir nicht\n\ngarantieren. Das ist die Sache der Regier\n\nung. Wir können Ihren alles Andere geben.\n\n\"\n\nSo I--my wife was a teacher in Yugoslavia at this date, and I had this beautiful position, and we\n\nwent back. However, we stayed in the Marienbad Hotel, I will never forget it. And I looked out\n\nat the quay and tears were dripping out of my ey\n\nes. I was so sad that I can't come back to\n\nVienna. I loved Vienna. I loved Vienna.\n\nNL:\n\nIt's an enchanting city, especially in\n\nthis pre-war period, the inter-war period.\n\nSo...\n\nYM:\n\nSo after this...\n\nNL:\n\nYour life flowed on then, in Novi Sad?\n\nYM:\n\nYes, after this it's a very interesti\n\nng period. As I say, up until '34, February, I\n\nwas in Novi Sad. I sang concerts in the Academ\n\ny of Music in Budapest, here, there, I sang on\n\nthe radio. I started in 1930 the cantorial music programs on the Yugoslav radio. You may even\n\nhave found something in those notes which I le\n\nft with you, where there are letters and notes\n\nfrom the radio station in Budapest.\n\nNL:\n\nYes, I want you to identify those if we have time.\n\nYM:\n\nYes, I will, I will.\n\nNL:\n\nBecause we made copies and I think I have your original.\n\nYM:\n\nI will. I will. So...\n\nNL:\n\nIt was a rich life.\n\nYM:\n\nIt was a very rich life. Here, the following happened, probably in 1933, fall,\n\nafter the holiday, in the fall, the\n\nChevrah Kadisha\n\n[burial society] in Novi Sad which was at the\n\ntime 200 years old, because they started with Je\n\nws who came from Phoenicia and all the Middle\n\nEastern countries...\n\nNL: Turkey...\n\nYM:\n\nTraveled through Turkey and all the other countries, and settled in Yugoslavia,\n\nand among other places, Novi Sad, so that\n\nChevrah Kaddisha\n\nstarted to be active in that part of\n\nthe world, 200 years ago at the time. So, they,\n\neh, this was a very big celebration, where the\n\nking, King Alexander, was represented by one of\n\nhis generals, and the chief rabbi, Alkali, Dr.\n\nAlkali from Belgrade, came down and there was\n\na tremendous banquet in the evening, but in\n\n4\n\nMy dear child, we cannot guarantee your citi\n\nzenship. Only the government can give you\n\nthat. We can give you everything else.\n\nthe morning it started, the whole thing started with\n\na celebration in the temple to have a service.\n\nThe details are not important, but...\n\nNL:\n\nBut it was a momentous time.\n\nYM:\n\nYes. But what is important is that\n\na man by the name of Dr. Braun, who was at\n\nthe time--a German fellow--who was at the time the director of the radio station, the national\n\nradio station, that is, the radio station was run by the government there, you know, so, he was\n\nthe director of that, and when he heard us with\n\nthe choir and how beautiful it was, and all that,\n\nhe came over to me after the service and said, \"Could we come over once to pick up your\n\nservice on Friday evening, or\n\nShabbes\n\nSaturday morning, and broadcast it?\" I said, \"I couldn't\n\ntell you that. You would have to\n\ntalk to the rabbi, and the religious committee, and so on.\" I\n\nspoke to the rabbi and saw right away that he\n\nwill not agree. He was an extremely jealous\n\nperson, and didn't want to give\n\nkoved\n\n[show respect] to...\n\nNL:\n\nBe showered on like that.\n\nYM:\n\nYes. So anyway, eh, finally this got\n\nback and forth. Finally we decided with\n\nthis Dr. Braun that if he can't take the whole\n\nservice from the temple, I should come and give\n\nconcerts in Belgrade, and so I went every three,\n\nfour, five weeks [unclear] Belgrade and gave\n\nconcerts and so on. One day I get a letter from\n\na man in Kovno, of all places. He writes to me\n\nin Yiddish, \"My dear friend,\n\nHazan\n\nMandel, I heard you on the radio on this and this date, and\n\nI liked what I heard, and I w\n\nould like you to come down to Kovno to give a few concerts.\n\nConcerning this, don't worry about money,\" he sa\n\nid, \"it's my responsibility. But in order to\n\nmake it legal, in a few days you will receive suggestions, a plan, plus an agreement from a\n\nconcert bureau, Klavahoff [phonetic].\"\n\nNL: [chuckles]\n\nYM:\n\nKlavahoff [phonetic], was the name of the concert bureau. I remember! In a\n\nfew days I really received, I think it was around\n\nJanuary or something, now, of 1934. This went\n\non for three months in 1933 and so on. But it took\n\nus a long time. I get this, and I thought, one\n\nmore thing is important, that my family, the fam\n\nily of my wife, was, all lived in Novi Sad, and\n\nmy father-in-law, who was the rabbi of this congregation once upon a time, because he never\n\nlearned the Serb language which became the offici\n\nal language of the community, he wasn't the\n\nrabbi or the associate rabbi but became the secret\n\nary general of the congregation. So I spoke to\n\nhim, I spoke to the family and so on, and they,\n\nmy mother-in-law, may she rest in peace, she\n\nsaid, \"My dear child, you live in the same house where we are. What are you missing? Why do\n\nyou want to go away? What is it, what are you really looking for?\"\n\nNL: Searching...\n\nYM:\n\nSearching for. And I didn't know what\n\nto answer. But\n\nI answered, \"I will\n\ncome.\" And we corresponded back and forth, a\n\nnd in February of 1934 I\n\nwent down to Kovno to\n\nthe house of this wonderful person who arranged for\n\nme in his--he lived in a mansion--a wing of\n\nhis house, with a car, with everything, whatever I\n\nwanted to go, at my disposal and so on, and I\n\nsang, I\n\ndavened\n\nin Kovno, in the\n\nDobi Shakorshul\n\n[phonetic] first\n\nShabbes\n\n, then I sang a benefit\n\nconcert for the, for a\n\nyeshiva\n\n, and then the next week we had a concert with the Lithuanian\n\nNational Orchestra, rather in the Academy of Music there, and it was very nice.\n\nNL:\n\nA concert of Jewish...?\n\nYM:\n\nA concert, no, no,\n\nNL: Secular.\n\nYM: A mixture.\n\nNL:\n\nBut some liturgical music?\n\nYM:\n\nYa. Yes. Definitely yes.\n\nNL:\n\nIn the Lithuanian...\n\nYM:\n\nIn the Lithuanian...\n\nNL: Musical Hall...\n\nYM:\n\nIn the Academy of Music. Ye\n\ns. And accompanying was the symphony\n\norchestra of the Lithuanian govern...\n\nNL:\n\nWhat an experience for a young man.\n\nYM:\n\nIt was just overwhelming. And I was\n\nthere for two or three weeks. I sent\n\ntelegrams to extend my vacation, because I ha\n\nd vacation for two weeks, and suddenly one\n\nweekend, one\n\nShabbes\n\n, I think the third\n\nShabbes\n\nor something, a gentleman is at the table with\n\nus, and this man, I think his name was Mr. Bark\n\nin, in whose house I stayed, introduces a man by\n\nthe name Mr., eh, I can't remember his name\n\nnow. Anyway, introduces him, \"This is the\n\npresident of the\n\nGrosse Chor Synagoge\n\nin Riga. It's my brother-in-law, Mr. Becker.\"\n\nNL: Your brother-in-law?\n\nYM:\n\nHis\n\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Becker.\n\nNL: Barkin's brother-in-law.\n\nYM:\n\nYa. This man was the brother-in-law of\n\nthis Mr. Becker. And Mr. Becker came\n\nto\n\nshul\n\n, heard me\n\ndaven\n\n, and Sunday he tells me, \"You know, we are seeking a\n\nhazan\n\nfor\n\neighteen or nineteen months already,\n\nHazan\n\nRabitz\n\ndavened Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur\n\n.\n\nOur\n\nhazan\n\nuntil now was Herman Yadlovger [phonetic], who was\n\nRigenzer\n\nhimself, but he isn't there any more. And we had many, many candidate\n\ns, this one, that one. I think you should try\n\nout for this position.\" So I didn't dare to stay\n\nany longer. I went home, and about two, three,\n\nmaybe four weeks later I went back to Riga, and\n\nthen my family was all in tears, why do I go?\n\nAnd I\n\ndavened\n\nin Riga, and among three, we were down, they were down, the congregation was\n\ndown to three people. That\n\nwas Herman Yadlovger [phonetic],\n\nHazan\n\nAlter, Yisruel Alter, and\n\nmyself. And I will, consider this again it was a\n\ngreat and beautiful shining point in my career.\n\nRogachover\n\nGaon\n\nat the time, who lived in Dvinsk, but\n\ncame for treatment to Riga, and I had a\n\nchance to speak with him, and before the...\n\nNL:\n\nWhat was his name again?\n\nYM: The\n\nRogachover Gaon\n\n, Rozin.\n\n5\n\nNL: Rozin.\n\nYM:\n\nBut he goes under the name, the\n\nRogachover\n\nGaon\n\n,\n\nRogachover\n\n. How you spell\n\nit,\n\nRogachover\n\n, the best way I can say it, Gaon [Brillia\n\nnt Rabbi-teacher]. And he told the\n\npeople, the board, when they came to him \"Re\n\nbbe, we are in such-and-such a quandary, we\n\ndon't have a\n\nhazan\n\n,\" an so on, he said, \"\n\nYidden, oib yir vilt haben a\n\nYid, a hazan, a Yid, nemt\n\nHazan Mandel\n\n.\"\n\n6\n\nNL:\n\nAh, you had\n\nso\n\nmany offers!\n\nYM:\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nNL: Incredible.\n\nYM: So...\n\nNL:\n\nDid you pick up any impressions of Jewish life...\n\n5\n\nJoseph Rozin (1858-1936), Polish Talmudic genius, called \"the\n\nRogachover\n\n\" after his\n\nbirthplace (Rogachov).\n\n6\n\nJews, if you want to have a Jew, a cantor, a Jew, take Cantor Mandel."
