The Unofficial Book of Political Lists

By Iain Dale

******************************

For Sheena & Tracey

Acknowledgements

Most people think of political reference books as either dead boring or prohibitively expensive. Hopefully this is neither - but then again it is rather more than a reference book. Where in Dod’s Parliamentary Companion could the reader find the Top Ten Political Chat-Up Lines alongside a List of Prime Ministers Since 1721? So this book is all about information and fun - two words not always associated with political life.

It is easy to be sceptical of politicians and to believe that they’re all the same and are only in politics for what they can get out of it. The truth is somewhat more simple. Our politicians reflect the society in which we live. Proportionately there are no more crooked politicians than there are crooked bank managers (perhaps a poor comparison, but there you go!). Politicians are no more likely to sleep around than journalists, although one could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. Generally speaking, politicians of all parties are honourable people who genuinely wish to improve the life of the people, while continuously disagreeing with each other about how to go about it. But that’s democracy. And that’s what this book is all about. Where else but in a true democracy could you read in a book the Top Ten Politicians Gay Men Find Attractive?

The most difficult part of writing and compiling this book has been to put the 300 lists into a logical and easily accessible order. I have decided to divide it up into eight sections, finishing with the humourous bit! However, in order for the reader not to become submerged by fact and information there is also a scattering of “unofficial” lists throughout the book - easily recognisable by the stamp which appears on the page.

I hope this book gives you as much enjoyment reading it, as it gave me to compile.

History of MPs’ Pay

1912 MPs receive first ever salary of £400 pa

1913 £100 of MPs’ salaries made tax exempt in lieu of expenses. This remained the case until 1954.

1924 MPs allowed free rail travel between London and their constituencies

1931 Salaries are cut to £360 as an austerity measure

1934 Salary restored to £380 and then to £400.

1937 MPs are awarded a 50% pay rise taking their salaries to £600 pa.

1946 Salaries are increased to £1,000. Free travel allowed also between MPs’ homes and Westminster.

1953 A sessional allowance of £2 per sitting day (except Fridays) was introduced.

1957 The sessional allowance was replaced by an annual expense allowance of £750. Although the £1000 salary and the £750 expense allowance were taxable, MPs were allowed to claim as tax free any expenses up to £1,750 incurred in respect of their parliamentary duties.

1964 Following a report by the Lawrence Committee salaries were increased to £3,250.

1965 The Members’ Pensions Act was passed introducing a comprehensive scheme for MPs and their families. MPs were to contribute £150 pa, as would the Exchequer.

1969 A secretarial allowance of £500 was introduced and MPs were allowed free phone calls within the UK.

1972 Salaries were increased to £3,500 following the Boyle Committee Report and the secretarial allowance was doubled to £1,000. A further allowance of £750 pa was granted to those MPs living outside London for extra living expenses, while London based MPs were granted an extra £175 pa. Travel allowances were extended and a termination grant equal to three months pay was introduced for MPs who lose their seats at elections.

1972 Improved pension scheme was introduced.

1974 Secretarial allowance rose by 75% to £1,750 and the living outside London allowance was raised to £1,050. The London supplement was upped to £228 pa.

1976 Further improvements in the pension scheme.

1977 Salary increased to £6,270 while secretarial allowances increased to £3,687. London supplement upped to £385, travel allowances further extended and an allowance introduced for overnight stays away from home up to £1,814.

1983 MPs salaries linked to Civil Service rates.

1992 After a Top Salaries Review Board enquiry into office costs MPs voted themselves a substantial increase to nearly £40,000 per annum.

Top Ten Signs You’re Losing the Election

UNOFFICIAL

1 Even your mother votes for the other guy

2 Suddenly the photo opportunity with the sheep doesn’t seem quite so smart

3 Popular campaign chant of “four more years” refers to your prison sentence

4 Jeremy Paxman describes you on air as “That total airhead”

5 You hate meeting people

6 Your opponent takes all his party workers to help a nearby marginal seat

7 You are Conservative candidate in Ebbw Vale

8 You’re known as the Candidate who can’t stop drooling

9 William Hill gives better odds on Eddie the Eagle winning Olympic Gold

10 Not even your cellmate wants to vote for you - even if he could

Top Ten Ways to Make Elections More Interesting

UNOFFICIAL

Glue up the slot on the ballot box

Every time a candidate kisses a baby, have him pelted with eggs

Put Jeremy Vine on prozac

Prime Minister’s speechwriter writes a speech of limericks

UKIP votes to be counted by the same people who count the unemployment

statistics

Abolish Party Political Broadcasts and replace them with old episodes of Captain Pugwash

Make the Returning Officers sing the results to the tune of “Like a Virgin”

Ditch the Dimblebores and get Fearne Cotton to present Election Night programme

Abolish postal votes and give out 0898 numbers to raise money for tax cuts

Fine opinion poll companies £1 million for every per centage point their predictions are wrong

Top Ten Excuses for Losing an Election

UNOFFICIAL

Should have kept quiet about seeing Carravagio seventeen times

Maybe not a good idea to have made that campaign speech in German

Misread campaign manager’s memo as “kiss babes” - should have kissed babies

Those negative campaign ads about myself were perhaps a mistake

That constituency visit by Neil & Christine Hamilton wasn’t such a good idea after all

Should never have described opponent as a great kisser

Couldn’t believe they’d be stupid enough to vote for the other guy

Shouldn’t have accepted that campaign donation from Bob Diamond

That ‘hanging’s too good for them’ leaflet just wasn’t tough enough

10. Thought it was best out of three

Tip O’Neill’s Checklist for Successful Politicians

1 It’s a round world - what goes around comes around

2 You can accomplish anything if you’re willing to let someone else take the credit

3 Never lose your idealism

4 Lead by consent not by demand

5 You can switch a position but do it quickly and openly

6 Learn to say ‘I don’t know but I will find out’

7 KISS - Keep it simple and stupid

8 Never speak of yourself in the third person

9 Tell the truth the whole time and then you don’t have to remember what you said

10 No chore is too small

Colin Powell’s Rules of Life

It ain’t as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning

Get mad. Then get over it.

Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.

It can be done!

Be careful what you choose. You may get it.

Don’t let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.

You can’t make someone else’s choices. You shouldn’t let someone else make yours.

Check small things.

Share credit.

Remain calm. Be kind.

Have a vision. Be demanding.

Don’t take counsel of your fears or naysayers.

Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.

Top Ten Conservative Quotes

“A Conservative is a man who sits and thinks - mostly sits.”

Woodrow Wilson

“To be a Conservative is to prefer the tried to the untried, the fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the super-abundant, the convenient to the perfect present, laughter to utopian bliss.”

Michael Oakshott

“The Conservatives conserve what you’ve got, the Liberals are liberal with it and Labour gives it all away”

Ted Hunt

“Of course, nobody likes the Conservatives. They only vote for us because they think we are right.”

Peter Lilley

“In the Conservative Party we have no truck with outmoded Marxist doctrine about class warfare. For us it is not who you are, who your family is or where you come from that matters, but what you are and what you can do for your country that counts.”

Margaret Thatcher

“A liberal conservative is a man who thinks things out to progress but would rather they remained as they are”

Fitzjames Stephens

“A Conservative Government is an organised hypocrisy.”

Benjamin Disraeli

“What is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against the new and the untried.”

Abraham Lincoln

“There is always a certain meanness in the argument of conservatism, joined with a certain superiority in its fact.”

Ralph Waldo Emerson

“Nothings commends a radical change to an Englishman more than the belief that it is really conservative.”

H A L Fisher

Top Ten Quotes on Socialism

“An extreme Socialist is one who wants to abolish Public Schools tomorrow. A moderate Socialist wants to abolish them after his children have finished going there.”

Norman Tebbit

“I sometimes think the Labour Party is like a pub where the mild is running out. If someone does not do something soon, all that is left will be bitter and all that is bitter will be left.”

Margaret Thatcher

“As with the Christian religion, the worst advert for socialism is its adherents.”

George Orwell

“I haven’t read Karl Marx. I got stuck on the footnote on page two.”

Harold Wilson

“Socialism is nothing but the capitalism of the lower classes.”

Oswald Spengler

“As far as socialism means anything, it must be about the wider distribution of smoked salmon and caviar.”

Richard Marsh

“The term ‘democratic socialist’ makes as much sense as ‘pregnant virginity’.”

Russell Prowse, Australian Industrialist

“Democracy and socialism are means to an end, not the end itself.”

Jawaharlal Nehru

“The typical Socialist is...a prim little man with a white collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarian leanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, with a social position which he has no intention of forfeitting.”

George Orwell

“Socialism is nothing but the capitalism of the working class”

Oswald Sprengler

Top Ten Liberal Quotes

“We all know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run over.”

Aneurin Bevan

“The trouble with many Liberals is that they talk a lot of cock.”

Cyril Smith, Former Liberal MP

“Liberal - worshipper of power without power.”

George Orwell

“If God had been a Liberal there would not have been ten commandments, there would have been ten suggestions.”

Malcolm Bradbury, Author

“The closest thing to a Tory in disguise is a Whig in power.”

Benjamin Disraeli

“A Liberal is a man who leaves a room before the fight begins.”

Heywood Broun

“A Liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel.”

Robert Frost

“I have the good fortune to be the first Liberal leader for half a century who is able to say at the end of our general assembly: go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.”

David Steel in 1981

“A Radical is a man with both feet firmly planted - in the air. A Conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward. A Reactionary is a somnambulist walking backwards. A Liberal is a man who uses his legs and his hands at the behest - at the command of his head.”

Franklin D Roosevelt

“Testators would do well to provide some indication of the particular Liberal Party which they have in mind, such as a telephone number or a Christian name.”

A P Herbert

Top Ten Quotes on Political Power

Thomas Jefferson
