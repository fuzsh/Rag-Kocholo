They are usually received by professionals who are not specialized in mental health. This study aimed to describe nursing staff's experiences in the emergency department, in the care they provide to people with mental health problems who often feel stigmatized by society and also in health care settings.\n\nMethods\n\nThis is a descriptive qualitative study with a phenomenological approach. The participants were nurses from the Spanish Health Service from the emergency department of the Community of Madrid hospitals. Recruitment was performed by convenience sampling snowball sampling until data satruation was met. Data were collected through semistructured interviews conducted during January and February 2022.\n\nResults\n\nThe exhaustive and detailed analysis of the nurses’ interviews made it possible to extract 3 main categories—health care, psychiatric patient, and work environment—with 10 subcategories.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main study findings were the need to train emergency nurses to be prepared to care for people who experience mental health concerns including bias education and the need for implementation of standardized protocols. Emergency nurses never doubted their ability to care for people experiencing mental health disorders. Still, they recognized that they needed specialized professionals’ support at certain critical moments.\n\nKey words: Emergency care, Mental health, Nursing, Qualitative research\n\nContribution to Emergency Nursing Practice\n\n•\n\nCoronavirus disease 2019 has caused an increase in the population’s mental health issues, thus increasing the number of patients with mental health concerns in the emergency department. This situation has caused stress for emergency nurses.\n\n•\n\nThis study explores how nurses experience and manage increased emergency department utilization by people with mental health concerns, particularly how nurses perceive their ability to deal with people seeking care for mental health problems in the emergency department.\n\n•\n\nEmergency nurses must address patients' unique needs, requiring specialized skills and training. Emergency departments should provide targeted training including bias education, standardized care protocols, suitable treatment spaces, and access to experts in complex situations for a comprehensive approach to mental health emergencies.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe unprecedented global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes in the mental health (MH) of the entire population. New cases of anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and insomnia have appeared1 in addition to those already diagnosed as having an MH concern (MHC) before COVID-19 who were already undergoing treatment or who have become worse due to confinement, fear of contagion, and loneliness.2 , 3\n\nFor many people, the emergency department is the first and fastest option to solve their health problems, both physical and mental.4 Several international studies suggest that 4% to 15% of ED visits are for MH reasons.5 , 6 Consequently, the emergency nurse faces new challenges, such as providing adequate care to patients, optimizing the time in each intervention, and maintaining the quality of care.7\n\nEmergency services are increasingly becoming a point of contact for people with MH disorders, so it is essential to provide adequate MH care in the emergency department. Emergency psychiatric care is increasingly in demand in hospitals.8, 9, 10 Therefore, knowing the nursing staff’s skills and knowledge to offer effective and practical care and quality service is crucial.11\n\nIn the emergency department, the care provided to patients with and without MH problems is performed by frontline ED staff who are not specialized in psychiatric care.4 , 12 , 13 Approaching emergency care for a person with MHCs is a challenge for emergency care professionals because these patients usually require immediate specialized care.13 As Cullen et al14 state, people with MHC want nurses to know their care needs, understand their care process in the emergency department, and demonstrate effective skills.\n\nEmergency departments are busy environments, often with tired and stressed staff handling highly complex and life-threatening situations—patients with violent and aggressive behaviors who may even physically and/or verbally assault them.15 Emergency health care providers often report that a lack of knowledge and training to deal with these situations is a barrier to providing adequate care for people with MHC.4 , 16 , 17 This need, coupled with the stressful ED environment and brief interactions with patients due to time pressures, strains the ability of staff to meet patients’ emotional needs.18 , 19\n\nIn contrast, people with MHC perceive that the attention they receive from health professionals needs to be improved.12 Several studies highlight the importance of health professionals’ training and experience in MH to improve care for people with physical illnesses complicated by psychological and behavioral problems.20 , 21\n\nThe quality of the environment is also essential. In the emergency department, it contributes to users' negative experiences owing to lack of privacy and quiet spaces, and the use of electronic equipment contributes to users’ negative experiences.22 , 23\n\nWand et al24(p1) argue that a service led by specialized nurses and integrated within the structure of the emergency team provides rapid and effective access to specialized MH care for people with “undifferentiated health problems” and eliminates a significant workload from nursing and medical staff. This statement reinforces the need for initiatives to raise MH awareness among ED staff.24\n\nCaring for people with MHC in the emergency department presents unique challenges that affect their experiences and outcomes, as demonstrated by research exploring the perspectives of people seeking care in the ED for MH reasons.12 , 25 A recent systematic review concluded that users feel stress and discomfort in the emergency department and need staff to deal with those feelings.26 In particular, people with MHC report negative experiences and inappropriate treatment by emergency personnel due to stigma and discrimination.12 , 22 , 25 Those who frequently visit the emergency department describe the staff as indifferent and impatient in their interactions.26 Others report being discharged from the emergency department without receiving treatment.25 , 26\n\nFurthermore, it is important to point out that very few studies analyze nursing care in the emergency department for people with MHC, especially studies emphasizing the nursing staff’s experience and personal involvement.20 , 27\n\nFor the reasons stated earlier, it is essential to know the experiences of both users and professionals to develop appropriate interventions and optimize emergency services for people with MHC. This paper explores emergency nursing staff’s experiences, perceptions, and feelings in caring for patients with MHCs. Therefore, the study aim is to answer the following question: What are the emergency nurses’ perceptions, experiences, and feelings when caring for patients with MHC?\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Design and Setting\n\nA qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological approach was conducted to explore the perceptions and personal experiences of emergency nurses. Phenomenology is a methodological, theoretical orientation about “seeing” the phenomena from the perspective of the one who experiences them.28 According to Mortari,29 participants’ narratives reveal the empirical qualities of an experience that cannot be separated from the context of the phenomenon.\n\nThe research was conducted in 7 hospitals in the Community of Madrid.\n\nStudy Subjects and Recruitment\n\nThe participants were emergency nurses from hospitals in the Community of Madrid. All of them had treated at least 1 patient with MHC while working in the emergency department. Nurses with specialized training in MH and those who self-reported having MH problems were excluded.\n\nParticipant selection was based on potential participants' ability to provide relevant information to respond to the study’s objective, beginning with a purposive sampling at a tertiary-level hospital in Madrid.30 The facilitator, known to some of the researchers, was the ED coordinator. She provided the researchers with the list of emergency nurses who, meeting the inclusion criteria, were at different stages in their careers and had different levels of ED experience. The potential participants received an invitation letter with information about the study, a consent form, and a questionnaire to gather sociodemographic variables ( ). To achieve data saturation, snowball sampling was continued in the Community of Madrid hospitals, reaching data saturation in participant number 15 and ending the interviews. There were no dropouts.\n\nTable 1\n\nParticipant codeAgeSexWorking time in the emergency departmentWorking experienceFormal educationWorkplaceEmployment contractYear of graduationE145F9 mo9 moGradeUH 1Temporary2021E235F14 y14 yGradeUH 2Indefinite2007E322F7 y7 moGradeUH 2Temporary2021E425F4 y4 yGradeUH 3Temporary2018E530F5 mo9 yGradeUH 4Temporary2013E635F8 y15 yGradeUH 2Indefinite2007E726F2 y3 y and 6 moGradeUH 2Temporary2018E828F2 y4 y 8 moGradeUH 2Temporary2016E960F25 y37 yDiplomaUH 2Indefinite1984E1024F19 mo19 moGradeUH 2Temporary2018E1156F28 y36 yDiplomaUH 5Indefinite1986E1225F3 y and 6 mo3 y and 6 moGradeUH 2Temporary2018E1326F2 y3 y and 6 moGradeUH 6Temporary2018E1425F2 y3 yGradeUH 7Temporary2019E1541F10 y14 yGradeUH 5Indefinite2009\n\nResearch Team\n\nThe research team consisted of 4 PhD nurse researchers, 2 internal medicine nurses, 1 intensive care unit nurse, and 1 PhD researcher from the department of biological systems. The entire team participated in the assessment of each stage of the research process to reduce the potential for researcher bias.\n\nVariables and Data Collection Tools\n\nFollowing consent, sociodemographic data was collected from each participante (See ).\n\nAn interview schedule comprising open-ended questions, using a semistructured guide, was designed with an inductive-deductive process based on the existing literature, the objectives, and the clinical experience of the research team.30\n\nInterview questions used in this study are presented in .\n\nTable 2\n\nQuestion scriptHow do you think emergency care should be offered to a patient with a mental health problem?The treatment of patients who come to the emergency room for a problem other than their chronic mental illness?\n\nDo you consider that emergency care is being carried out adequately?\n\nWhat mental disorders are the most frequently seen in the emergency department?Do you know if there is any care protocol for patients with mental health problems in the emergency department?Who are the professionals who should care for these patients?Do you think there is a stigma toward people with mental illness?What would you define as the predominant or frequent emotion when approaching a patient with a mental health problem?Do you fear for your safety in the presence of people with mental health problems?\n\nThe interviewers were nurse researchers with training in interview techniques. Data were collected through semistructured interviews conducted during January and February 2022, lasting between 45 and 60 minutes. The COVID-19 pandemic drove the need to explore alternative data collection methods for qualitative research. Consequently, 2 researchers conducted the interviews using the Microsoft Teams (version 1.4.00.4167; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) platform, and video and audio were recorded and transcribed verbatim.31 , 32 In addition, a third PhD nurse researcher collected field notes to gather participants’ perceptions, sensations, and nonverbal communication during the interview.33 Confidentiality was ensured by consecutively coding each interview and removing personal data from transcripts.\n\nData Analysis\n\nFive researchers participated in data analysis, and an external researcher allowed data triangulation. Investigator triangulation used in this study permitted the participation of 2 or more researchers in the same research to provide multiple observations and conclusions. This type of triangulation allowed both confirmations of findings and different perspectives, adding breadth to the phenomenon of interest.\n\nThe data were analyzed using an inductive qualitative content analysis in which similarities and differences in the data were searched for.34 Open coding was first done to describe all aspects of content. Second, the units of meaning created were grouped under higher-order headings to reduce the number, and finally, they were grouped into subcategories and categories.35\n\nFive stages were followed in the analysis process36:\n\n1.\n\nCollection of information through semistructured interviews\n\n2.\n\nA careful reading of audio-recorded interview data transcribed verbatim\n\n3.\n\nDecomposition, identifying units of meaning and relevant categories according to the study objectives and the information obtained\n\n4.\n\nOrganization and enumeration through a coding process\n\n5.\n\nInterpretation, systematization, and data summary to disseminate the results\n\nAudio of the interviews was transcribed and the observation annotations were gathered for their subsequent interpretation. The data were reduced by carefully reading the texts and selecting the most relevant information according to the objective of the study.37 The ATLAS.ti software (version 9, Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was used as a tool for coding data.38\n\nThis study has used the 4-dimension criteria proposed by Lincoln et al39 to establish quality and methodological rigor: (1) credibility, controlled by applying 2 types of triangulation (researcher’s and methods triangulation [interviews, field notes, and observation] and peer debriefing); (2) transferability, by describing the method used and the phenomenon under study and using a combination of 2 purposive sampling techniques; (3) dependability, by giving a detailed description of the study methods, by elaborating detailed drafts of the study protocol throughout the study; and (4) confirmability that was met with the verification by the participants of data collected in transcribed primary documents. Finally, researchers analyzed data, and an external researcher evaluated the study, focusing on aspects of the applied design and study methods. A complete review by the research team further enhanced the study’s rigor and trustworthiness.39\n\nThe Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research40 was used as a guide for reporting study findings.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nThis study respects the fundamental principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.\n\nOnce contacted, participants received information about study purposes and data collection process. All participants provided their written consent.\n\nEthical approval was granted by the corresponding medical and health research ethics committee of the university hospital (CEIC Fundación Jiménez Diaz Univertity Hospital).\n\nResults\n\nAfter analyzing the interviews, the information was compiled in an analysis table, grouping the data into 3 main categories that responded to the proposed objectives ( ).\n\nTable 3\n\nCategoriesSubcategoriesHealth care and attitudesStigma\n\nFearFamilyPsychiatric patientPathologyCOVID-19Security and carePediatric areaWork environmentInfrastructureResourcesBarriersTraining\n\nHealth Care and Attitudes\n\nThe social stigma associated with people with MHC—manifested in negative attitudes or behaviors toward them—hinders relationships of trust and interferes with the treatment they receive in the emergency department. Participants verbalized stigmatizing behavior from nurses toward people with MHC in the emergency department, often unconsciously.\n\n“A person with a mental illness is crazy, so they are treated as such.\" (E2)\n\n“We don’t treat them like people with a common disease, we treat them like someone you don’t want to attend because they scare you…and that fear generates a kind of rejection in us.” (E7)\n\nIt has also been observed that the approach to patients seeking MH care generates rejection and fear among health professionals, mainly due to the fact that social stigma is rooted not only in society but also in health care settings:\n\n“…we’re afraid because we associate a psychiatric patient with aggressiveness...we always cautiously enter a room where there is a psychiatric patient.” (E2)\n\n\"Fear? Hmm, let me think... I think it’s ‘uncertainty; it's caution and responsibility, you know... I’ve seen serious things...someone whose finger was torn off by a psychiatric patient...or a person knocked out by a kick. Even when I was pregnant, one of them told me that he was going to kick me so that I would give birth right there... But, you know, this behavior is due to that they are sick.\" (E8)\n\nHowever, some participants reported that having a relative with MHC undoubtedly influences their approach to a person with an MHC, changing their perspective.\n\n“Today on social networks you can see many influencers or celebrities who have children with autism, with some mental health problem…well, you know…. When someone close to you suffers from this type of disorder, the commitment is greater.\" (E6)\n\n“My sister suffers from anxiety disorder…and I have been able to observe many of her crises... I don’t like seeing them at all. I don’t like to see people’s suffering because I empathize with them.\" (E4)\n\nParticipants also considered that the relatives of patients with MHC are usually forgotten and do not have sufficient support from the institutions. Caregivers of people with MHC often suffer physical and mental exhaustion, even feeling guilt:\n\n“Often many people come with their relatives requesting to leave them in the hospital. They tell us ‘I need him/her to stay here tonight please.’ I can’t take this situation anymore.\" (E11)\n\nPsychiatric Patient\n\nThe MH disorders most commonly detected by participants were depression and anxiety, which increased considerably after COVID-19. The participants reported that this increase overwhelmed them and made them feel unprepared. They experienced frustration at not knowing how to help people with MHC and how to care for them properly:\n\n\"The appearance of many cases of depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic has been brutal…even among colleagues! …well…how badly we have been taught, how little we know about managing our emotions, or how to control stress, anxiety... This is too much for us! ...And how little we know about certain disorders such as borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia...\" (E6)\n\nParticipants noted that the number of MH cases had risen but also found that awareness of MH issues had increased as well.\n\n“...now it seems that there are more cases, but I think there have always been cases...although now we can identify or give them a name.\" (E6)\n\nHowever, the cases that generated the greatest feelings of anger and helplessness in the participants were MH disorders in children and adolescents.\n\n“The pediatric mental health patient overwhelms us… How is it possible that a child of only 6 years old suffers from depression and anxiety... I can’t remember that 20 years ago children of this age went to the emergency department for a mental health disorder.\" (E11)\n\nA controversial issue related to treating patients with MH disorders was the use of restraints. The distrust and lack of security nurses feel when approaching patients experiencing a mental illness crisis—due to their violent and threatening attitude—led, on many occasions, to use restraints, always as a last resort, to faciliate the safety of both the staff and the patients. There were discrepancies and different opinions among nurses about the therapeutic use of restraints in psychiatry.\n\n\"And here a dilemma arises. Is restraint an appropriate measure? We believe that it is unfair to them---psychiatric patients-and to us. It is true that it gives us security because it is us--not the psychiatrist who prescribes it--who stay with them... But this measure lasts all day long, even if the outbreak has passed... There is no way to stop it!\" (E7)\n\n\"They [the doctors] ask us to immobilize the patients and we do it, but we know what that means…we are not caring for them, we are dehumanizing them. They are people! It's frustrating!\" (E9)\n\nMost participants considered the restraints a personal and individual protection resource. However, emergency nurses, especially those who previously worked in a psychiatric unit, saw restraints as a therapeutic failure and emphasized that they are neither the best nor the final solution.\n\n“I believe immobilization is the failure of the whole approach…\" (E14)\n\n“If a patient is immobilized and does not receive any other care, it is very likely that he/she will scream or become aggressive… Immobilization is a harsh measure…it is useless without other complementary measures.\" (E14)\n\nHowever, despite the challenges posed by these situations, the participants also revealed an empathic stance when reflecting on how they would like to be treated in a similar situation, and all agreed that patients with MHCs feel misunderstood, neglected, and even forgotten. In contrast, being aware of patients’ adverse experiences in the emergency department and their lack of preparation to care for them led nurses to ask for help, specifically, more nurses specialized in MH, and more ongoing training in managing patients with MHC.\n\n\"You feel it, I know the patient is being misunderstood, but at the same time, I do not know what to do with him. I want to help him, but I need HELP to give him the proper care. I know, I know, it sounds awful, it's a bit…yes, it's a pity. I feel bad, I feel sad, I feel overwhelmed; we need more nurses specialized in mental health care in the ED or more training on caring for people with mental health issues.\" (E6)\n\n\"…nobody wants to attend to them…of course; there are no problems with those patients who are quickly diagnosed because they are immediately transferred to the mental health team. However, there are other cases, such as chronic alcoholics--they are psychiatric patients too--who have to stay in the crowded general emergency unit--in no man's land--until they get over the intoxication...nobody wants to care for them.\" (E9)\n\nWork Environment\n\nThe participants detected barriers that hindered the adequate approach to people with MHC: workload, lack of time, use of pharmacologic measures, and communication difficulties.\n\n“They need more care time than other patients...\" (E7)\n\n“The overload of work affects us a lot, and we don’t have time to adequately care for people who come with a mental health problem… \" (E12)\n\nUndoubtedly, the most notable aspect expressed by many participants was the urgent need for action protocols for people with MH disorders, not only for agitated patients. Moreover, they blame the institutions for their lack of concern and initiatives to improve care for people with MHC:\n\n“Many times, I don’t know how to act...or how to talk to them... I want to do the right thing, but when I have to talk to the patient...I really don’t know the best way to communicate with them.\" (E10)\n\n\"...these patients have different needs; we really need nurses trained in mental health, psychiatry and psychology…and even though we often feel overwhelmed and confused, we try to do our job to the best of our ability and try to help others with our experience, but is it enough? Many times, we want to believe so. But it is not enough, we need specialized professionals.\" (E11)\n\nThe participants also emphasized the need for adequate spaces where the treatment and care of patients with MHC can be individualized:\n\n“There is no adequate space in the ED to care for these patients. It’s a fairly closed space...they should spend as little time as possible in here.\" (E1)\n\n\"…just as there is an area for pediatrics or gynecology and obstetrics…there should also be another for psychiatry…a completely different area where psychiatric patients wouldn’t need to be tied up because they would be in safe rooms, where they wouldn’t be able to escape, their lives wouldn’t be in danger, or they wouldn’t be able to hurt themselves…come on! They just need help.\" (E6)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study aimed to describe how nursing professionals perceive and experience emergency care for people with MHC. Currently, the demand for ED care for people with MHC is increasing.8 , 41 Patients seeking care for MH emergencies face the challenge of being socially stigmatized, and that stigma permeates health care services.42 Emergency nurses expressed that caring for patients with MHCs is more complicated and challenging than caring for patients with common physiological diseases.11, 41\n\nThe study results indicated that emergency nurses consciously or unconsciously harbor negative feelings, biases, and prejudices about people with MHC. These professionals are exposed to threats and violence from their patients and, therefore, can develop negative feelings and mistrust that affect their attitudes toward caring for them, and on many occasions, they resort to the use of restraints, even though they are aware that restraints are a therapeutic failure; regarding this, some studies show diverged opinions among professionals.43 , 44 Consistent with other findings, emergency nurses also expressed how experience, MH literacy, and interaction with the patient can help reduce stigma.45 , 46 However, in contrast, the restrictions related to COVID-19 may have led to increased stigmatization of vulnerable populations, including people with MHC.47\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, incidences of MH have risen, especially in younger people.3 , 7 Cases of anxiety, depression, and stress have increased, which, according to the scientific literature, are the most prevalent psychological diseases.8 , 9 , 48 In addition, emergency nurses in the study hospitals have also cared for patients with psychotic and psychiatric episodes and delusions, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, in line with the findings in other studies.49\n\nThe emergency nurse participants highlighted the importance of relatives and caregivers in managing people with MH problems. They expressed concern about the lack of interest in and support for their needs from public institutions. Caregivers also need help because they often feel overwhelmed and tired, and struggle to meet their relatives’ needs.50 This finding is similar for nurses, who also expressed concern about correctly preparing to care for people with MH problems. These experiences coincide with the need for more training in dealing with people with MH disorders to resolve the concern generated by not knowing how to provide safe and effective care for people who present with MH emergency needs.4 , 51\n\nOne of the most pervasive findings in the consulted literature was the discriminatory treatment experienced by people with MHC in the emergency department. Patients with MH disorders attribute this behavior to professionals’ negative and biased attitudes and prejudice.12 , 27 , 42 , 52 , 53 Patients with MHC are often seen as dangerous and unpredictable, and they generally generate fear, rejection, and avoidance.22 The findings of this study confirm the existence of bias and stigma and how it affects the quality of care that patients receive, specifically their evaluation, care treatment, and communication.13 , 23\n\nAs in this study, other authors also reported experiences of health professionals in which it is observed that the care of patients with MHC is associated with fear and therefore with inadequate care.54 In particular, emergency nurses show negative attitudes toward them, influencing their therapeutic interactions.57 In the present study, it is evident that the participants are concerned because they recognize that they are not providing optimal care for patients with MHC in the emergency setting. They feel overwhelmed and lack essential skills, and find it very necessary to receive the support of an MH specialist. Our study findings are in line with other studies that reflect the importance of having specialized professionals with experience, training, knowledge of relevant evidence-based practice, and specific therapeutic interventions to help ED patients with MH disorders.11 , 22\n\nOther conditions that make it challenging to provide good quality of care for patients with MHC are the workload and the rhythm of the emergency department.11 These problems are reflected in the waiting time in the emergency department.5 Moreover, despite the wait, the care time for each patient has been reduced and is currently very short, so patients wonder whether, in such a short time, the nurses will be able to attend to their care needs.25 , 54 Our results show that caring for patients with MHC in the emergency department fundamentally requires conditions such as adequate time for proper care, adequate space, professional training, and the support of MH specialists.\n\nThe participants in this study highlighted the need for protocols to improve the quality of care based on communication, pharmacologic measures, and restraints. They also advocated for better training and awareness for those emergency professionals who are inexperienced in caring for people with MH problems.25 These measures could lead to emergency staff feeling more confident when making decisions at work.11 , 24\n\nLimitations\n\nThis study presents certain limitations to consider. Although it includes valuable insights from frontline care providers dealing with people requiring emergency care for MHC, the context-specific findings may not fully represent all professionals in the field. Furthermore, the results lack generalizability due to the study methodology and sample size. Findings from this study may not be transferable to other clinical settings. This study is also geographically confined, focusing exclusively on a single health system, which might limit the transferability of the results to staff in different locations or health systems.\n\nDespite these limitations, it is worth noting the validation offered by the congruence with similar studies in the field and the diversity of the study group, which supports the relevance of the findings. Nonetheless, future research is necessary in the context of Mental MH in the emergency department to further validate these findings and continue the important work of updating action protocols to better serve patients with MHC.\n\nImplications for Emergency Nurses\n\nThe findings of our study suggest that the care of patients with MHC in the emergency department requires organizational changes and, above all, the training of the ED staff, which, if conducted, would represent a unique opportunity to offer interventions that positively influence patients with MH needs. Some fundamental changes would be training of emergency nurses in the care of patients with MH disorders, adequate emergency spaces, standardized protocols, and the support of professionals specialized in highly complex situations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the aftermath of COVID-19, ED visits by people with MHC continue to rise, overloading the system, stressing professionals, and sometimes leading to adverse outcomes. Due to the stressful work pace and the care load in the emergency department, it is challenging to care for patients with MH conditions because they present unique characteristics that require being cared for by nurses with specific training.\n\nProviding safe, quality care for people with MHCs in the emergency department requires special skills and special training. Emergency nurses in this study did not doubt their ability to provide care. However, they recognize their need to be supported by professionals specialized in MH to solve problems that may arise at critical moments and thus be able to properly care for people with MHC in emergency department.\n\nAuthor Disclosures\n\nConflicts of interest: none to report.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the nurses who participated in the study. The completion of the study was possible because of them. We also extend our deepest gratitude and appreciation to Prof J. Abad and A. González Hernández for their professional assistance, Mark Davis for his help in the English edition, and Rosalía Gomez-Toledano (philologist and English teacher for 37 years) for proofreading the manuscript.\n\nBiographies\n\n•\n\nEva García-Carpintero Blas is Simulation Program Coordinator and Professor at, Fundación Jiménez Díaz School of Nursing – Autonomous University of Madrid, Avda, de los Reyes Católicos, Madrid, Spain.
