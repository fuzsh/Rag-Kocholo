        "text": "‚ÄúHKIA is when I knew I was getting out. It made up my mind for me. After years of trying to get to The War, I wanted nothing to do with it. It wasn't the b0mb|ng at the gate either. It was realizing how ugly and pointless it was. How much we had been lied to for decades, and how even as young men fell from the planes onto the runway, and thousands pushed against the gates in futile desperation, we found ourselves incapable of telling the truth, that we had failed. Nothing made it clearer than when our Platoon Sergeant called a meeting early one morning in one of the hangars where the Company had set up a makeshift TOC. He told us NCOs that reporters had landed over night and that we had to conduct a perimeter sweep of the entire airport. Initially we thought it was to check for potential infiltration spots given the intel about an imminent attack. But by the end of the brief, we were clear about the intent: we must collect the d0zens of inf@nts that had been thrown over the walls by desperate parents, their small bodies k!||3d by the heat or the fall. We couldn't allow any reporters to take photographs, lest the world witness our failure. We found heavy duty trash bags and borrowed some gators and flatbeds from another Platoon. We did it every morning until Abb3y Gate. Sometimes the babies had been tangled in the barb3d wir3. Sometimes we found them still alive and would call Doc. I'll never be able to forget or forgive. We carried bags of dead babies back to a designated building where a small group of NGO workers said they were \"Identifying them\" for notification of NoK. We exchanged no words. I think both of groups knew it was all b≈ü. After the blast at #abbeygate I felt somewhat relieved. The security degraded, and the reporters became scarcer. We could stop pretending things were under control, or that they ever were. SGT, 82nd, Kabul Afghanistan‚Äù ^originally posted by breaker_of_chains_2 _____ #semperfi #afghanistan #foreignpolicy #semperfidelis #kabul\n\nMaster Sergeant Scott M. Carney, 37, died on August 24, 2007, while supporting combat operations in Herat, #Afghanistan. He was assigned to 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th ID of the Iowa National Guard, Boone, Iowa. Scott was born on July 14, 1970 in Somerset, #Ohio to John Kenneth and Geneva Sharon Carney. He graduated from Sheridan High School where he wrestled and was a state qualifier. After graduation, Scott joined the US Army and was stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey; Panama; Wiesbaden, Germany; Fort Benning, Georgia; Camp Casey, Korea and Fort Lee, Virginia. In December of 2000 he joined the Iowa National Guard at Camp Dodge, Iowa as an Active Guard Reserve. Scott accepted a full time position in Boone, #Iowa with 2nd Brigade in 2004. He was presented numerous awards throughout his career, including most recently an Army Accommodation Medal, an Iowa Accommodation Medal and the Bronze Star. Scott met Jeni, his best friend, while stationed together in Germany. They were inseparable from the day they met. After dating for over a year he asked her to marry him on a tarmac while watching planes land at Rhein-Mein Air Force Base near Frankfurt, Germany with a ring he purchased at the PX. They married in Slidell, #Louisiana at the Antebellum House in 1992. They began their lives together in Georgia and were shocked with the news that they were going to have twins. Their Boys, Jacob and Justin, were born in 1994. From there they enjoyed raising the children in a loving, fun, Catholic home, wherever that may have been. After moving to Iowa, Scott and his family enjoyed doing everything together. This included, #fishing, hunting (but not Jeni), boating, skiing, tubing and camping on Saylorville Lake, bowling, dancing, swimming, along with cheering on the New Orleans Saints and The Ohio State University football teams. Scott was a wonderful role model to his children, to his fellow soldiers and to everyone who met him. His sense of humor was wacky and sometimes caught people by surprise. He always tried to better himself. Scott was a member of St .Theresa‚Äôs Parish for four years where he co-taught 5th grade Religious Education with Jeni before he deployed. He earned his degree from upper University of Iowa as a non-traditional student and attended many classes for the #Army over the years to further his career. Scott will be remembered by all Iowans as a hero. He will be remembered by his friends and family as the most important person in their lives. _____ #semperfidelis\n\nTips for your first American Legion Convention (tailored to southern states) For Politicking: ü•û Attend the Southern Caucus breakfast üëó Go to the Commanders Banquet üíº Attend the Post-Convention NEC meeting For Fun: üèà Go to the football game üíÉüèª Find a Friend üñäÔ∏è Sign your Department's sign üí∞ Bring cash (for registration) For Learning: üìù Go to one of the following Commission meetings, take notes, and ask questions: - Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation - National Security - Veterans Education and Employment - Legislative Affairs - Americanism üí° Pro Tip: Prioritize your mental health. In real life, I'm very introverted. There's a lot of pressure here to go to everything, with everyone, at all times. If I went to everything possible, I would lose my mind. Instead, I prioritize my friends, the events I find joy in, and escape when needed. It is absolutely okay to decline a dinner or two. No one will hold it against you. üì∏: 2023"
