Have an account? .\n\nOn October 19, NATO kicked off its largest military exercise in over a decade with an opening ceremony in Tripani Air Base, Italy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exercise, called Trident Juncture 2015, includes approximately 36,000 troops, over 140 aircraft, and 60 ships from more than 30 nations.\n\nThe exercise's participants include both NATO countries and nations that are close with the various NATO states but aren't officially being part of the alliance, such as Australia, Austria, Finland, and Ukraine.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nTrident Juncture is taking place entirely in the western Mediterranean, with the majority of the exercise occurring in Spain and Portugal, as well as in Italy. The operation will last until November 6.\n\nWe have collected some of the most amazing images of the exercise so far below.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNATO kicked off Trident Juncture 2015 with an opening ceremony at Tripani Air Base, Italy on October 19.\n\nThe starting ceremony featured displays of military prowess, like Italian soldiers rappelling out of helicopters ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... and aircraft flying in formations and refueling in midair.\n\nThe exercises have also included large-scale airdrops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opening ceremony was aircraft-heavy, because of its location at a NATO air base.\n\nThe exercise, which took place throughout the central and western Mediterranean, is intended to showcase the alliance's military strength.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the opening ceremonies in Italy, the bulk of the exercise takes part in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe exercise has featured massive beach landings ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... which include a mix of service members from the participating countries.\n\nSpecial forces have also practiced specialty missions, such as raids on enemy or captured ships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exercise required two years of planning.\n\nIt features approximately 36,000 troops, 140 aircraft, 60 naval vessels, and the militaries of 30 nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis infographic gives a general idea of the sheer size and scope of Trident Juncture 2015.\n\nIt is the largest NATO exercise in over a decade and the first major NATO war game since 2002.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the timing of the exercises, and NATO's addition of ballistic-missile-defense drills and reactions to hybrid warfare and cyberattacks to the drill, it appears Trident Juncture is aimed at one specific possible foe: Russia.\n\nRussia's intervention in Syria, following its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in early 2014, has ratcheted up tensions between the Kremlin and NATO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Moscow began its military operation in Syria, Russian jets have also violated the airspace of Turkey, a NATO member, twice.\n\nRussia has also deployed a substantial number of submarines and naval vessels into the Mediterranean off of Syria's western coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNATO has nevertheless declared that the ongoing exercise is not directed toward Russia.\n\nInstead, NATO's Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow told reporters during the start of the exercise that Trident Juncture is inspired by security challenges relating to African countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever its context, Trident Juncture offers NATO and NATO-supporting countries the chance to better hone their abilities and work together.\n\nThat includes offering NATO personnel from other countries the chance to use different platforms than they're used to, such as the US' V-22 Osprey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe operation also provides valuable opportunities for individual units to become accustomed to operating in diverse environments.\n\nTrident Juncture 2015 will run through November 6.\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
