        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nSnippet:\n\nJiang Wanyin took a deep breath as he stood before sealed gates to the one lotus lake in the heart of Yunmeng that was to never be disturbed for anything short of catastrophic proportions. He is certain that the Wens attacking and destroying three of the five great sects can count as \"Catastrophic Proportions\" and this was honestly their last chance, a secret weapon that might save them.\n\nBehind him the other leaders and heirs who managed to survive the Wen attacks tensed and watched with trepidation. The only ones who did not seem bothered were the Lan's. In fact Sect Leader Lan seemed to be eyeing his brother, who looked as blank faced as ever. But for whatever reason the clan always seemed to defer to the Second Jade as if he stood above them. Jiang Wanyin shakes his head as his mother, leaning heavily on one of their few surviving seniors reaches into her robe and hands over a bloody cloth that had his father's severed right hand in it and he carefully presses it and his own hand to the seal that flashes brightly and they watch a series of magical arrays come to life and begin opening and bursting like colorful flower petals being blown by the wind.\n\nThe final barrier bursts into lotus flowers as blood seems to soak the door and melt the wood into an archway and laying behind them was a stunning crystal clear lake with lotuses, spider lilies and many water flowers and plants all in varying colors and some even flowers in the darkness of the night.\n\nJiang Wanyin slowly steps forward and when Madam Yu attempted to enter a great and fearsome roar fill the air a violent wind storm appeared. She quickly stepped back with the Senior's help and the wind instantly stilled and silenced. The water didn't even ripple nor did the flowers move. It was unnaturally still.\n\n\"It seems only Jiangs of Blood may enter...\" Lan Qiren muses, lightly tugging on his beard.\n\nThey turn to see Jiang Yanli walking forward from where she had been protected by her person Meishan Yu guards. She was able to enter without threat or triggering anything. So far nothing but the strange storm happened nor looked like it was of use. But then a beautifully haunting song being played on a Dizi sounded and suddenly a figure was dancing across the surface of the lake. They were dressed in beautiful Jiaoren silks dyed blacker than night, ash gray and corpse white with vividly blood red accents. The figure's hair was extremely long, it slithered across the surface like a black river snaking its way down the land to the sea from the mountains. But not much else could be seen of the figure until they danced closer, the song echoing with power and everyone tensed as that power got closer with the figure and the weaker Cultivators were brought to their knees or were collapsed to the floor, not quite unconscious but unable to stand.\n\nWhen the song seemed to end the sound of a zither suddenly slithered out the mournful twangs of the strings catching the tail end of the song and coaxing it to dance. The haunting melody resumes combined with the zither and it almost brings tears to their eyes before the Dizi is abruptly cut off by a shout from Madam Yu.\n\n\"Kneel!!\" She commands pouring power into her husbands ring, a strange black thing he never took of not until he died and it fell from his finger when he shoved his beloved wife and son into the boat and away from their home.\n\nIt sparked with power and the figure collapsed into the water with nary a sound.\n\n\"What are you doing!?\" Cries out several voices.\n\nLan Wangji glares at the woman, having been the one to play his Zither without pulling out because he knew this song. How could he not? He was the one who wrote it for his beloved before he fell from Heaven's Grace and then had supposedly died under the warth of a thousand swords. He had to make sure and sure enough. But then that bitch somehow subdued his beloved.\n\nSaid being was forced under the water which turned the water blacker than black and the flowers to all turn blood red and glow with ominous power. The others gasp as they realize that whatever had been sealed here was in fact a very powerful demon.\n\n\"Mother, stop!! We need it to fight for us!\" Her son yells and she sucks her teeth because she is forced to stop anyway, her core was half destroyed by Wen Zhuliu and thus she couldn't hold the power for long or use too much, otherwise she risks completely destroying it.\n\nWhen she stopped the being slowly appeared before them walking out of the water and somehow it wasn't wet. Now that it was closer they see the demon is veiled. The veil is held up by two branching antlers like the skeletal remains of dead trees. Hung from each branch are gems of blood red, corpse white and blacker than black material. The veil is weighted down by black gold coins that have blood made crystals embedded in their centers. Pointed ears were decorated with silver earrings that had black and red gems handing from them and the hands were pale and elegant, but only adorned with strange black markings and long deadly red claws.\n\nThey could not tell if the demon was male or female and it had yet to make a sound. The details on the hanfu depict a fallen god surrounded by a dead landscape and the skeletal remains of various beings. A single pure white object can be seen on them and only the Lan's gasped recognizing it as a Jade Token. And Lan Xichen is certain that if he were to see it closer it would be carved into the shape of a sleeping bunny much like the black one that his \"Brother\" wears.\n\n\"Oh? You are not Jiang Chi... Where is that brat at?\" The demon asks in a surprisingly young voice, it is youthful, boyish even and certainly belonging to a cheerful young master than a being of ultimate evil.\n\nEveryone instant grabs for weapons and the demon scoffs.\n\n\"How typical. You come knocking on my doors and then pull weapons on me, shouting that you will end my so-called tyranny and do away with my evil... Blah blah blah... Honestly as if I didn't hear that shpeal from Wen Mao and that monk guy. Something An... Huh, wait where are those brats? And where's that golden peacock? And the hothead that promised to chop me up? Hmm, you are all certainly wearing their colors but what the heck is wrong with your clothes?\" The demon wonders looking around and completely unbothered by them but also half confused by them.\n\n\"I am Jiang Wanyin, I am a descendant of Jiang Chi... You have been sealed away for over 500 years.\" Said young man tells the demon, who turns to face him the black veil keeping them from seeing his face. \"I am the newly minted Sect Leader of Yunmeng Jiang.\"\n\n\"Eh? But your hardly more than a baby... Stop joking and fetch me the real Sect Leader. The one who holds my leash.\" He scoffs and everyone bristles. Madam Yu growls and moves to step forward but the sudden flash of black lightning stops her.\n\n\"I am the one who's your leash and you will show my son respect you lowly curr!!\" She spits out with outrage.\n\nThe demon just bursts into laughter at that and turns and starts walking across the water again.\n\n\"Oh, so I guess you don't need me and you opened my cage for no reason then... I hope you realize that means your souls are forfeit for breaking the original creed by opening my cage for anything less than a catastrophe.\" The demon grins and raises their hand a sphere of black and red energy gathering in his hand, crackling with deadly power and for just the barest second they caught sight of the demon's profile.\n\nThat split second reveal a bloody red eye surrounded by black. Jiang Wanyin quickly steps forward, after hissing at his mother to stop it. The woman growling in fury at the insult and threat from the demon.\n\n\"We did not open the seals out of folly. Wen Ruohan of the Wen Clan and descendant of Wen Mao has attacked three of the five Great Clans and all but decimated our peoples. He will not stop until he takes over the entire world. He is nearly immortal and he is using demon puppets of some kind...\"\n\n\"...\" The demon paused and the ball sniffs out into a plume of smoke before the demon turns back to them and cocks it's head to the side. \"How utterly ironic...\" Is all he says before walking back to the center of the lake and a house appears from the mist that hung on the latter half of the lake. He enters and everyone is left confused by this and they begin discussing this turn of events. Lan Qiren and the fe Elders with them were against using the demon, demanding they kill it before it joins forces with Wen Ruohan. Jin Guangshan was wondering how long the Jiangs had kept such a powerful weapon hidden from the rest of the world and implied that had Wen Ruohan not started his machinations, the Jiangs would have surely decided to take over the world.\n\nNie Mingjue was torn between wanted to kill the demon and using it to their advantage. Lan Wangji glares at all of them until they finally go quiet and look at him. Seeing he had their attention, he says:\n\n\"He's no threat unless you make yourself a threat to him...\" He says clearly and turns as the house suddenly just vanishes, the lake is also gone, not even the flowers. Only a barren land and they gasp at the sheer amount of corpse and skeletons that had been hidden by the lake.\n\nThe demon walks towards them once more holding a small pearl that housed his beautiful lake, flowers and home and carefully puts it away somewhere they could never hope to find it and then snaps his fingers.\n\n\"Stop being lazy. We have a wanna be Immortal to deal with... Honestly did those brats even listen to me when I told them to burn Xue Chonghai's notes?\" He sighs shaking his head. \"But what the hell do I know? I am only the Archetype of the Ghost Path...\"\n\nSighing once more he walks forward and the dead behind him begin moving and standing some grow flesh others exchange body parts and others turn to ghosts or into Yaos. They are mostly Jiangs, but certainly there is a healthy mix of others, their cloths showing the changes to they style of clothes over the last 500 years at the least.\n\n\"Now then, let me make one thing clear: You asked me for help, so you don't get to bitch and complain how I handle things. And once this is over, you are going to set me free and leave me alone. Because if you don't let me leave then you better be ready to give me the necessary sacrifices equivalent to the task you gave me. That means you have to give me enough souls to rival the Burial Mounds...\" He purrs out darkly. \"I am far too old and powerful for whelps like you to try and kill. Not even your forefathers could do it and they had help from my own disciple. So what makes any of you think you have a chance of killing me?\" He wonders, a cruel giggle sounding from his lips.\n\nThey all shiver in terror because their choices are either sacrifice thousands of souls to the demon to reseal him or let him go free.aa Yu growls and pours power into the ring once more and orders him to kneel and he drops to his knees once more but it doesn't hold long because she groans in pain and stops feeding the ring. The demon turns his head towards her and sneers out.\n\n\"Oh, yes, my cute little leash... But i hope you know using that thing shortens your life every time you use it...\" She giggles softly and she quickly stops gasping for air. \"... Ah I seem to remember now... A Jiang brat would come and visit and use it on me often. Would knock me out... I would wake up with that brats spend leaking out of my ass... Where is that little shit? I want his heart...\"\n\nEveryone went silent at this info and Madam Yu looks disgusted and frightened. The Demon just implied her husband snuck out often to sleep with the demon and that by using the ring so much it he would have died fairly younger than he would have originally, but what does that actually mean?\n\n\"My father is dead... He was the original owner of the ring...\" Jiang Wanyin says, bristling.\n\n\"Oh? Is his name Fengmian?\" The demon asks and when the brat goes pale but also flushes with sage, he grins brightly behind his veil. \"Oh, ho... That is actually funny! He would rather shorten his life generating enough evil karma in his soul just to sleep with me over dealing with his family! The only good thing he ever used me for was to save the life of a little girl... Hey Jiang brat, tell me is there a girl named Yanli still living in your clan or was she killed by the Wens too?\"\n\nJiang Yanli gasps and the demon turns to her and studies her for just a moment before a soft sigh leaves him.\n\n\"Ah, I see, he had me save the life of his daughter but told me she was just a random child so I would not be tempted to kill her to hurt him for hurting me. As if K would harm a child for the sins of their parents... But if that child adds to their parents sins, that is a different story...\" He scoffs and then slowly gets up and with a flick of his finger, the ring wrenches from Mad Yu's hand but before it can zip into his hand, a fine hand closes over it and a burst of powerful spiritual power pours in and the demon collapses, gasping softly at the strange warm and tingling the energy is producing through the ring. It is familiar and he almost moans in pleasure at it, but holds his tongue and looks at the one holding it to see a Lan, but not any Lan, but HIS Lan. He simply gives a soft sigh and allows himself to fall under the gentle urges of the energy and is soon out...\n\nLan Wangji is ultimately given control of the demon because of how quickly he subdued the creature and after several doctors checked him over and notes no lingering affects could be found. The Jiangs were angry to lose their demon to the Lan's but Lan Qiren made it clear it was only until after the war and until the Lan's can safely seal the demon back up without sacrificing so many lives. Though the Jiangs will have to answer for having a demon in the first place.\n\nWangji would never allow them to do anything to his beloved. His beloved who sacrificed everything to save the now Crowned Flower Emperor from his predecessor, even absorbing all the resentment and sins of the Flower crowned Prince's fallen Kingdom that turned him first into a fallen god and later when he was besieged by those he once called friends and family and was turned into a Demon King upon his death. And they had used his own students to help them don't as well.\n\nLan Zhan will not forgive those who harmed his beloved Wei Ying. He will make sure that he is returned to his home, Luanzang Hill and they will live quietly in peace there until the end of time of he had any say in it..."
