The course is nine weeks long focusing on rocket fire in support of rifle squads, platoons and other companies within the infantry battalion. This was one of the last classes to run through the course due to the military occupational specialty being phased out by March 2020. (U.S. Marine Corps video by Pfc. Stephanie Corona Morales)",
