Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC is hosting the city’s first ever Navy Week, in conjunction with the PIKES PEAK REGIONAL AIRSHOW, from August 12 - 18, 2024. The event brings Sailors from across the fleet to the area to emphasize the importance of the Navy to Colorado Springs, the state of Colorado, and the nation. Navy Weeks are a series of outreach events coordinated by the Navy Office of Community Outreach designed to give Americans an opportunity to learn about the Navy, its people, and its importance to national security and prosperity."
