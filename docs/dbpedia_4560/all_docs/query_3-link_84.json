        "text": "If you're looking at a single melee attack, you're absolutely going to need at least 17 levels in Rogue (Assassin) for Death Strike. I can't think of anything in the game better for increasing single-hit damage than the deadly combo of Sneak Attack (9-10 d6), Assassinate (automatic crit), and Death Strike (double damage). I'd take two levels in Paladin on top of that for smites, and then your final level could be Barbarian (for rage damage). Additionally, take the charger and martial adept feats.\n\nAverage Damage without items: 222\n\nMax Damage without items: 364\n\nDamage Breakdown\n\nRapier: 1d8 + 5\n\nSneak Attack: 9d6\n\nSmite: 2d8\n\nRage: +2\n\nCharger feat: +5\n\nManeuver (several choices): 1d6\n\nDueling fighting style: +2\n\nThis gives us a total of 3d8 + 10d6 + 14 damage. However, if we assume ideal conditions this Rogue will be attacking a surprised enemy that hasn't taken a turn yet, so the attack will auto-crit. That brings the damage to 6d8 + 20d6 + 14. That averages 27 + 70 + 14 = 111 damage (182 with max rolls).\n\nDeath Strike doubles that damage, for 222 average or 364 max.\n\nNow let's add in weapons, items, and enchantments that could boost it above those numbers:\n\nVorpal Sword would add +3, as well as +6d8 on a nat 20\n\nEnlarge: +1d4 damage (cast by a friend, or potion)\n\nA library of Manuals of Gainful Exercise would add another +5 from STR\n\nThese would add a total of 1d4 + 6d8 + 8 to the numbers above. Auto-crit to 2d4 + 12d8 + 8, and double, and you get an additional 134 (average) or 224 (max)\n\nThen add Purple worm poison for another 12d6 damage (that doesn't crit or double, thanks Jonatan) - 42 average or 72 max.\n\nThis gives us a total bonus from weapons & spells of 176 average or 296 max.\n\nAverage damage with items & spells: 398\n\nMax damage with items & spells: 660\n\n∞\n\nWell not actually infinity but arbitrarily large. Since you said any official items are allowed, the answer keeps getting higher the more time you have to setup. This is because of the Moonblade:\n\nA Moonblade gains a new rune for each master it has served, meaning that with more former masters, it will have collected more and more runes. Two of the runes have a property that increases damage without a limit on how many you can have:\n\n91-92 When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack an extra 1d6 slashing damage.\n\n93-94 When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nNothing states that multiple instances of these runes don't stack, so your melee attack will deal a maximum damage which approaches infinity as time goes on (I'm ignoring the other factors that affect its damage since the runes provide much more damage, comparatively, then the damage from the possible vorpal feature of the Moonblade, among others).\n\nFor details on the approximate damage based on the number of runes, see this Q&A.\n\nNote: yes, the one rune truly does not include the word \"deals\" and it STILL has not been errata'd. I assume that is the intent for the purpose of this answer\n\nI think we can do a little better. Let's try a Half-Orc Tempest Cleric 9/Whispers Bard 5/Hunter Ranger 4/Paladin 2, with Strength 19 and three feats, casting the spell Booming Blade with a Greataxe. Let's assume we crit.\n\nGreataxe does 2d12+4 (average 17, max 28).\n\nBooming Blade does an extra 6d8 thunder damage (we'll come back to that).\n\nHalf-Orc's Savage Attacks add 1d12 (average 6.5, max 12).\n\nOrcish Fury feat: 1d12 (average 6.5, max 12).\n\nGreat Weapon Master feat: 10.\n\nMartial Adept feat: 1d6 (average 3.5, max 6).\n\nAbsorb Elements spell (9th level): 18d6 thunder damage.\n\nSearing Smite spell (8th level): 16d6 (average 56, max 96).\n\nDivine Strike: 2d8 thunder damage.\n\nVenomous Blades: 6d6 (average 21, max 36).\n\nDivine Smite vs undead: 12d8 (average 54, max 96).\n\nColossus Slayer: 2d8 (average 9, max 16).\n\nSo thunder damage. The nice thing we have is Destructive Wrath; we can use our Channel Divinity to maximise our thunder damage. So we have 8d8 and 18d6 thunder damage which maximises to 160.\n\nAnd one more thing: if we hit our enemy with the spell Contagion, we can make them vulnerable to all damage. So let's double everything.\n\nAverage base damage: 687\n\nMax base damage: 942\n\nThen we add a Vorpal Sword; going from 1d12 to a 2d6 greatsword loses us average 5, max 12, but Vorpal gives us 6d8+3, so a total of average 25, max 39. Then Purple Worm Poison adds 12d6, average 42, max 72, and 6 from Manual of Exercising our Strength up to 30. And, of course, double EVERYTHING :D\n\nAverage damage with items: 833\n\nMax damage with items: 1176\n\nHere's what I got for maximum damage from one attack on one turn without help only using class and racial features, meaning no magical items.\n\nI did this using a Bugbear Paladin 2 / Grave Domain Cleric 2 / Assassin Rogue 3 / Fighter 2 / Hexblade Warlock 11. STR 14, DEX 20, CON 10, INT 8, WIS 13, CHA 14.\n\nI realize it'd be more efficient to use strength as the attack modifier, but I wanted to pump up dex to make stealth as high as possible, ensuring that the enemy is surprised.\n\nStep 1: Be stealthy/deceptive enough that you surprise your enemy to get a guaranteed critical hit from being an assassin.\n\nStep 2: As an action, use your grave domain cleric channel divinity: path to the grave. This makes the target vulnerable to all damage from the next attack, guaranteeing that your damage will be doubled.\n\nStep 3: Bonus action cast banishing smite.\n\nStep 4: Action surge, cast booming blade, using your pact weapon rapier to attack.\n\nStep 5: Use all available abilities to do as much damage in a single hit as possible.\n\na) 2d8+8 damage from the rapier, +2 from the dueling fighting style and +1 from improved pact weapon.\n\nb) 6d8 damage from the booming blade cantrip.\n\nc) 4d6 damage from rogue's sneak attack.\n\nd) 4d6 damage from bugbear sneak attack.\n\ne) 10d8 damage from a 5th level divine smite. You have to use a 5th level pact slot for this, but divine smites can't exceed 5d8. Sorry.\n\nf) 12d8 damage from a 5th level eldritch smite.\n\ng) 10d10 damage from banishing smite.\n\nSo just to be clear, that's (10d10+30d8+8d6+8 damage)×2, for a range of 112-792 damage and an average of 452 damage. I believe the 4d8 from booming blade is not doubled because it's triggered by the enemy moving, not the melee attack, so it only does 4-32 damage and an average of 14 damage. However, pact spell slots, channel divinity, and action surge all come back on a short rest, so assuming you do this on the leader of whatever group you're fighting, you can accept their surrender, rest up, and do it to someone else in an hour.\n\nUsing your suggested methods, here's the breakdown. All of the dice values are on crit\n\nWeapon: Great Axe +3 2d12+3\n\nRace: Half-Orc: 1d12\n\nNotable Stats: 20 Charisma +5\n\nClasses: Paladin 8 / Warlock 9 / Sorcerer 3\n\nClass Features: Hexblade Warlock Eldritch Smite, the rest don't matter for damage.\n\nFeats: Great Weapon Master +10 , Orcish Fury +2d12\n\nSpells: Absorb Elements 10d6, Hex (or Hunter's Mark) 2d6\n\nAbilities: Smite 12d8, Eldritch Smite 12d8\n\nWhen you crit an undead creature, you roll the following damage: 12d6 + 5d12 + 24d8 + 18, for a maximum damage of 72 + 60 + 192 + 18 = 342.\n\nHow to: Cast Absorb Elements as a 5th level spell (1st warlock slot) and get hit by any of the damage types listed. As a bonus action, cast Hex. On your next turn, crit an undead creature with your +3 Great Axe while taking a -5 attack roll penalty for +10 damage. Expend a 4th level spell slot (multi-class spell slot table) for Divine Smite and a 5th (2nd warlock spell slot) for Eldritch Smite. On crit, your half orc racial gives you +1 weapon die (1d12) and your racial feat grants you two additional weapon die. Being a Hexblade Warlock allows you to use your charisma for damage modifiers.\n\nWays to increase this based on target: Attack a creature vulnerable to Slashing, Radiant, Force, and whatever type Absorb Elements used for double damage to any of those types.\n\nBumping this now, the new total would be 2266 - with the absolute maximum rolls and 3 crits. But we'll start with just one attack. ... for 1246 damage.\n\nHuman (variant), Wizard 10 - Evocation, Cleric 8 - Arcane, Paladin 2.\n\nThe feats that matter: Great Weapon Master, War Caster (for setup/preference), and Elemental Adept Thunder (Reliable Damage)\n\nItems needed: Vorpal Greatsword Book of Exalted Deeds (optional - explained later - Illusionist's Bracers) Access to libraries full of: Tome of Understanding, Tome of Clear Thought, and Manual of Gainful Exercise. Purple Worm Poison\n\nHelp from other players needed. 1. Cast Enlarge on player 2. Cast Contagion on the enemy 3. Trigger Absorb Elements the prior round.\n\nSpells needed. Booming Blade Cantrip (Chosen as Arcane Initiate option under Arcane Cleric - Counts as both Wizard and Cleric spell for appropriate abilities: Potent Spellcasting and Empowered Evocation) Absorb Elements Cast at 9th Level Searing Smite (Cast at 8th Level as Paladin Spell, made 9th by Book of Exalted Deeds)\n\nStats needed: 30 x x 30 30 13\n\nOrder of Events:\n\nRound 1: Ally 1 Casts Contagion on the enemy, Ally 2 casts Enlarge on Player, Player Casts Searing Smite at 8th(9th) level.\n\nRound 2: Ally triggers Absorb elements on Player (9th Level)\n\nRound 3: Player casts Booming Blade, and strikes with the Vorpal Greatsword after activating Great Weapon Master. Player Crits, and expends a 4th level spell slot to use Divine Smite. Booming Blade Procs when the enemy moves later\n\nCalculations: (for this I will use double dice quantity as to show critical damage)\n\nEnlarge 2d4\n\nVorpal Greatsword 4d6+13 +10 GWM\n\nBooming Blade receives a + 20 to its spell roll due to class features 6d8+20 and 8d8+20\n\nVorpal Effect on Nat 20 (Not Doubled) 6d8\n\nDivine Smite 10d8\n\nSearing Smite and Absorb Elements 18d6 + 18d6\n\nPurple Worm Poison (Not Doubled) 12d6 Assuming the odds are REALLY in your favor, and you roll maximum: that's - in order-\n\n8+24+13+10+48+20+64+20+48+80+108+108+72 = 623 But wait that's not 1756\n\nThe Illusionist's Bracers allow you to cast a cantrip as a bonus action if you have cast it that turn. This means that you can cast Booming Blade a second time. The total for that bonus attack equates to 255 damage - Same calc, stopping after the Vorpal effect. Still, that's only 878.\n\nContagion makes a target vulnerable to all damage. Only slightly overpowered. 878 x2 =1756\n\nAn additional thing to note. (If you have War Caster) Using a reaction to cast a cantrip with this feat casts that cantrip on an opponent's turn. Via the wording on Illusionist's Bracers:\n\nWhile wearing the bracers, whenever you cast a cantrip, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to cast that cantrip a second time.\n\nThis may imply that the user is able to use a bonus action to cast a cantrip on an opponents' turn. This would result in the following possible total if on \"Round 3\" an opponent triggered War Caster, and gave you the use of a cantrip as a Reaction. The Reaction would serve as your first attack, the bonus your second, and an action on your turn as the third. The attack from your turn is also worth 255 damage, bringing the subtotal to 1133, and the total to 2266... However, this all regards more than one melee attack, so in conclusion: 1246 damage for 1 attack.\n\nHit it with your Vorpal Barbarian\n\nRace: Half-Orc\n\nClass: Barbarian 17/Paladin 2/Warlock 1\n\nRelevant Ability Scores: Strength 29\n\nWeapons and Magic Items: Vorpal Great Sword (2 handed), Belt of Storm Giant Strength\n\nFeats: Great Weapon Fighting, Magic Initiate (for Absorb Elements), Savage Attack\n\nRelevant Class and Race Features: Brutal Critical (3 dice), Great Weapon Fighting Style, Divine Smite\n\nSetup: Assume the target is a legendary undead creature who has been afflicted with Hex that is hit by a crit and is neither vulnerable nor resistant to any element being used. In the prior round, you were hit by some sort of fire attack that enabled you to trip Absorb Elements.\n\nI am simplifying the math to assume that because of the chosen Fighting Style, the dice range for the great weapon is between 3 and the upper end of the relevant die.\n\nEffect of Hit:\n\n\\begin{array}{rlll} 21 &= &2\\text{d}6+3+9 &\\text{(Vorpal Sword)} \\\\ 13.5 &= &2\\text{d}8+1\\text{d}8 &\\text{(Radiant damage from Divine Smite on an undead creature)} \\\\ 3.5 &= &1\\text{d}6 &\\text{(Necrotic damage from Hex)} \\\\ +\\quad3.5 &= &1\\text{d}6 &\\text{(Fire damage from Absorb Elements)} \\\\ \\hline 41.5 & \\rlap{\\text{average (48 max)}} \\end{array}\n\nAdditional effects from crit (please note the following on Vorpal weapons):\n\n\\begin{array}{rlll} 225 &= 3\\times(2\\text{d}6+12\\text{d}8) & \\text{(Brutal Vorpal crit)} \\\\ 75 &= 1\\times(2\\text{d}6+12\\text{d}8) & \\text{(Savage Attack racial)} \\\\ 13.5 &= 1\\times(2\\text{d}8+1\\text{d}8) & \\text{(Smite dice are rolled twice, but not thrice because} \\\\ & & \\; \\text{they are not melee weapon attack dice)} \\\\ 3.5 &= 1\\times(1\\text{d}6) & \\text{(Crit on a Hex)} \\\\ +\\quad 3.5 &= 1*(1\\text{d}6) & \\text{(Crit on Absorb Elements)} \\\\ \\hline 320.5 & \\rlap{\\text{average (468 max)}} \\end{array}\n\nThis insanely nasty crit will deal, on average, 362 damage. It has the potential to deal as much as 516 damage.\n\nInfinite\n\nOr 1860\n\nOr 1956 with UA\n\nBefore we get into this a word of warning: you could use the books and the Morgan Freeman method detailed in Acumen's highest ability score video for infinite damage, so that's the max, but following is the maximum finite I've found.\n\nFirst of, make your character a lv. 17 Rogue Assassin, lv. 2 Paladin, and lv. 1 Mystic. You'll need 5 other members in your party: a druid, bard, 2 paladins, and a wizards. You're able to replace the wizard with a sorcerer, and one of the paladins with a cleric. Second, choose bugbear as your race. Choose Dueling as your fighting style for Paladin. Be a good alignment. Get the Martial Adept ability, along with any skill that lets you add your superiority die to damage.\n\nAs far as magic items go, we only need 1. Get a Vorpal Scimitar. Also obtain Purple Worm Poison.\n\nNow is when things start getting desperate. We need 1 level in Mystic for the Brute Strength discipline. If you don't like UA, then sadly we lose quite a bit of damage, but you get a free level. Second, we must be in the plane of Mount Celestia. Good-Aligned creatures here benefit from the effects of the Bless spell, and along with that you need to somehow get a fiend there. We also must acquire the Boon of Luck, and 10 boons to increase DEX and CHA to 30, making this section easily the most controversial of all.\n\nTime to put it all together. Have the druid in your party cast Flesh Rot Contagion on the fiend. The Bard needs to use bardic inspiration on you, and cast Bestow Curse on the fiend. One of the paladins needs to use Crusader's Mantle, while the other uses Holy Weapon on your weapon. The druid should then cast Elemental Bane on the fiend, choosing thunder. Finally, cast Thunderous Smite, Apply Purple Worm Poison, and sneak attack. On the damage roll for this attack use Boon of Luck, Bardic Inspiration, Divine Smite, 2 Uses of Brute Strike, Your Martial Adept ability, Channel Divinity Sacred Weapon, roll a nat 20, make sure your opponent is immune to Vorpal Insta-Kill, and Death Strike.\n\nAll damage dice gets doubled on a crit (I believe, I may be wrong about this), meaning you'll be dealing 2d12+2d10+12d8+50d6+6d4+25 damage, multiplied by 4 for Death Strike and Vulnerability you have 8d12+8d10+48d8+200d6+24d4+100 damage, and assuming you roll max on all of them:\n\n1956 Damage. Nearly 2000.\n\nExcluding UA like OP said it's 1860 damage."
