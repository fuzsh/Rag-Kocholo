        "text": "By Larry Burke, NMMC Aviation Curator\n\nMost of the aircraft in the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC) have taken a straightforward path on their journey into the collection. They flew for the Marine Corps before being “stricken” from active service because of an accident, coming to the end of the allowed hours of flight time, or simply because the military decided to stop operating that type of aircraft. But the UH-34D on exhibit in the NMMC Leatherneck Gallery took a more circuitous path to the Museum.\n\nThe aircraft, UH-34D Bureau Number (BuNo) 150570, was delivered to the Marine Corps in October 1963, and was immediately sent to Vietnam where it spent the next six years. Marine Corps practice at the time was to rotate aviation squadrons out of Vietnam after a period, but leave the aircraft in place, to be taken over by the relieving unit. Thus, BuNo 150570 cycled through several squadrons over that period: Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM)-163 (twice), HMM-361 (three times), HMM-364, HMM-162, HMM-365, HMM-161, HMM-263, HMM-363, and HMM-362. The helicopter finally returned to the United States in June 1969, where it was soon assigned to a Marine Air Reserve Training Division in Atlanta. It spent about two years as a training aircraft before being stricken and sent in early 1972 to Arizona’s Military Aircraft Storage and Disposition Center, now known as the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) or just the “Boneyard.”\n\nOperation Starlite—UH-34D helicopters from HMM-361 transported 107mm howitzers (a 107mm mortar tube mounted on a pack howitzer chassis) from 3d Battalion, 12th Marines, into position in August 1965. This image was used during the re-painting of BuNo 150570 to determine size and placement of various markings. USMC Photograph.\n\nIt was later acquired by Orlando Helicopter Airways, a business that purchased and refurbished old military helicopters both for sale and for its own use. Some of the helicopters were even turned into flying RVs! BuNo 150570 was registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to Orlando Helicopter Airways from 1981 to 1994, although registration does not necessarily mean it was flying. It is likely that BuNo 150570 was intended for a remanufacture that never occurred, whether a simple upgrade to turbine engines or a full RV makeover. Orlando Helicopter Airways sold it sometime after its registration lapsed, and by 2000, the airframe was in an aircraft resale yard in Arizona, stripped of its engine and other parts. This is where Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association found it.\n\nThe Association had formed a few years earlier, its origins in a 1988 USMC Vietnam Helicopter Association reunion. One of the attendees was Alan Weiss who had been a CH-53 crew chief in Vietnam with Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron HMH-361, the “Flying Tigers.” The unit had first deployed to Vietnam in 1962 as HMM-361 which flew the HUS-1 as the UH-34D was known before the Department of Defense standardized aircraft designations in 1962. During the 1988 reunion, a privately-owned UH-34D flew a demonstration over the crowd. Weiss was among those watching the flight. He took note of the emotional reaction of his fellow veterans, many of whom had worked with or flown in the “Huss” (from its HUS designation) or “Dog” (from the last letter in UH-34D). It was at that point that he decided to purchase and operate a UH-34D as a flying memorial. Weiss assembled a few like-minded veterans who soon formed the Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association to find, acquire, restore to flying condition, and operate a UH-34.\n\nMembers of the Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association (l-r: Seppo Hurme, A.C. Daniel, Ron Hatton, and Alan Weiss) prepare UH-34D BuNo 150570 for shipment from Arizona to New York. Photo by freedomsflyingmemorial.org.\n\nIn 2000, the Association had raised enough funds to purchase a helicopter. Weiss and three others went to Tucson, Arizona, to look at UH-34s for sale. They looked at over 300 aircraft, all former Army helicopters, before finding a handful of airframes that had served with the Marine Corps. After further research, Weiss identified five that had served with HMM-361. BuNo 150570, though gutted, was in the best shape. The paperwork on the aircraft confirmed its lengthy service with the Marines in Vietnam, including three tours with HMM-361. The Association bought the helicopter and in July 2001, shipped it by truck to Jamesport, New York, to a rented barn used as a restoration hangar.\n\nNo. 150570 in the restoration barn. Photo by freedomsflyingmemorial.org\n\nRestoration of the helicopter took more than four years. Alan Weiss recorded over 40,000 hours of volunteer work on the restoration before he stopped keeping track, in addition to more than $350,000 in parts and services, some purchased, some donated. Two volunteers who had dedicated many hours of their time were members of HMM-361 in Vietnam when it was still flying UH-34Ds.\n\nIn May 2004, a group of HMM-361 veterans calling themselves “Tweed’s Tigers,” held their reunion in Jamesport so they could help with the restoration. The name came from their service in the squadron in Vietnam when it was commanded by LtCol McDonald Tweed (1965-66). The end result of all the time, money, and effort came when the restored BuNo 150570 flew again on 13 November 2005 on its first check flight. It had been painted to reflect its service with HMM-361 during a 1965 deployment to Vietnam, including the ship number, “YN-19,” that it wore at the time. One anachronistic addition was the name “Gracious Lady Bev” in script under the cockpit windows on each side, in honor of Weiss’s wife, Beverly. Weiss had given a lot of his time and money to the restoration and frequently hosted volunteers and others associated with the project in his home. The name on the helicopter was an acknowledgement and gratitude to Beverly for all she had endured during this time.\n\nThe helicopter made its first public appearance in March 2006. The occasion was a ceremony at MCAS New River, North Carolina, activating Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM)-263. The new squadron had HMM-263 in its lineage; BuNo 150570 had served with that squadron as well. From that point, the Association operated the helicopter as “Freedom’s Flying Memorial,” fulfilling Alan Weiss’s dream of a flying memorial to HMM/HMH-361 and all veterans who flew in Marine helicopters during the Vietnam War. The Association took the helicopter to air shows, reunions, ceremonies, and even veterans’ funerals. At the end of 2008, however, they realized that keeping the aircraft in flying condition and covering operational costs would soon become too much for them to bear; they began a dialogue with the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC) about a possible donation.\n\nBuNo 150570 at VMM-263’s activation ceremony. This was its first public appearance since being restored by the Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association.\n\nThe Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association decided in 2012 that the tipping point had been reached: operating costs were exceeding what the Association generated in appearance fees, souvenir sales, and donations. Discussions with the NMMC culminated in the helicopter’s final flight on 8 November 2013, its delivery to the Museum.\n\nSikorsky UH-34D helicopter BuNo 150570 lands at the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC), Triangle, Va., Nov. 8, 2013.\n\nEven after a decade of flight operations, BuNo 150570 was in good condition and the only major restoration work required was to repaint it. While the Association had painted and marked the UH-34D as it would have appeared during one of its tours with HMM-361 in 1965, there were enough cumulative “touch-ups” that the Museum decided it was easier to repaint everything. One thing NMMC staff did not touch were the “Gracious Lady Bev” markings. Though not on the aircraft in 1965, they were left in place as a nod to the restoration work of, and history with, the Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veterans Association.\n\nMembers of the Marine Helicopter Squadron 361 Veteran's Association gather for a group photo after presenting the Sikorsky UH-34D to the National Museum of the Marine Corps (NMMC), Triangle, Va., Nov. 8, 2013. This helicopter flew numerous medevac and combat missions during the Vietnam War, and will be prepped for display at the NMMC in 2016. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Kathy Reesey/Released)\n\nThe NMMC installed the UH-34D on exhibit in Leatherneck Gallery, replacing a Korean War-era HRS-1/UH-19 helicopter tableau. This was especially appropriate given that when the HUS/UH-34 came out, it replaced the HRS/UH-19 in Marine squadron service. Since the markings on BuNo 150570 were already period-appropriate to 1965, NMMC staff decided that the new tableau would depict Operation Starlite, which occurred in August of that year. Starlite was significant as the first major offensive of the Vietnam War conducted by an entirely American fighting force. Prior to this, U.S. military forces had merely advised or supported South Vietnamese forces. Starlite represented the “Americanization” of the Vietnam War: using U.S. forces to directly fight the North Vietnam Army and National Liberation Front, the communist insurgent forces in South Vietnam. BuNo 150570 had actually flown in Starlite as part of HMM-361, so the choice of the setting aligned with this helicopter’s history.\n\nGetting the helicopter inside the Museum in 2016 was a major undertaking!\n\nSwapping out the helicopters was a major effort that needed careful planning. It took time to design the details of the new tableau and assemble the pieces along with period-appropriate uniforms on the cast figures. The new tableau was installed in early 2016. Even then, work was not finished: some markings were not painted on the helicopter until it was lifted into place, time was needed to build the diorama around the aircraft on its stand, and the main and tail rotor blades were not installed until 2017 when nearby temporary walls were removed. Since then, the helicopter has been a significant draw, greeting visitors as they come into the Museum.\n\nHere you can see the UH-34D and the HRS-1 it replaced. You can also see the temporary construction wall behind them.\n\nFrom its manufacture and delivery to the Marine Corps in 1963, a long career spent carrying Marines in Vietnam, to a private company that might have wanted to make it into a flying RV, to its discovery as a hulk in a dealer’s yard, to its acquisition, restoration, and operation by a group of dedicated veterans, the UH-34D bearing Bureau Number 150570 has had a long and unusual path to becoming a significant exhibit artifact at the National Museum of the Marine Corps.\n\nThe filmographer set up his camera in the outfield to capture the game from different angles. The camera placement provides an outstanding view of the Japanese batter and Marine pitcher and catcher.\n\nBy Kater Miller, NMMC Outreach Curator\n\nThis article was published in Leatherneck Magazine, December 2021.\n\nIn the Marine Corps archives, there is film footage of a unique baseball game in which a baseball team composed of U.S. Marines played against a Japanese team in Saga City, Japan. The film itself seems to be the only record of the game. The Marines in the film are from\n\n2nd Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division, which fought across Iwo Jima in February and March 1945. Saga City had been rebombed by the U.S. Army Air Forces on Aug. 5, 1945, though the bombing paled in comparison to those of the larger raids that cities like Tokyo suffered. One of the most striking details about the game is the date that the game was played in occupied Japan: Nov. 4, 1945, just a few months after Japan’s surrender. How could the two groups, both terribly affected by the war, come together as good sportsmen for a lighthearted game of ball?\n\nIt was not the first or last such baseball game played by U.S. military baseball teams against Japanese teams. In fact, baseball played an important role in the occupation of Japan after World War II ended. Since it was the most popular sport in both countries, the familiar game helped to heal the trauma of both nations reeling from the effects of a devastating and horrific war. The film shows an important\n\naspect of the occupation where the two former combatants participate in a pastime that they both enjoyed without violence or rancor.\n\nJapan and the United States share a long history of baseball teams traveling to each other’s countries on good will tours, starting when Waseda University’s team toured the United States in 1905. Marine baseball teams faced Japanese opponents as early as 1910 when Waseda University toured Hawaii and took two out of three games from the Marines. Marines also faced Waseda more than a dozen times in China in the 1920s and 1930s. The 4th Marine Regiment’s baseball team embarked on a successful goodwill tour of Japan in 1930, where they played against college and corporate semi-pro teams. In 1927, Waseda University played the powerful Quantico Marines at Quantico, with Japanese Ambassador Tsuneo Matsudaira and Major General Commandant John A. Lejeune in attendance. The Marines emerged victorious with a score of 9-6, but a July 1927 Leatherneck article indicated that it was due to Waseda’s sloppy baserunning as they outhit the Marines 15-12.\n\nWWII impacted baseball in the United States and Japan in different ways. The requirements for manpower by each country’s military strained college and professional sports teams. Young, able-bodied men were needed to serve, and professional baseball leagues in both countries did little to protect their players from service. It was not a foregone conclusion that professional baseball would continue during the war in either country. In the United States, the major leagues, minor leagues and semi-pro leagues did, as did many college baseball teams, with the consent of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, arguing that the entertainment value of baseball was too high and would be good for morale.\n\nBaseball did not fare as well in Japan. Pro-war, anti-American factions of the government looked upon baseball suspiciously. The National Professional Baseball League, which formed in 1936, truncated their 1944 season to 35 games, then canceled the 1945 season altogether. College baseball programs met a similar fate. In the minds of many, baseball was a foreign sport that was nearly incompatible with the Japanese culture. In 1942, when the Japanese government restricted the broadcasting of civilian programming to support war mobilization, it meant that no games were broadcast in, even though baseball broadcasts were not the specific target of the move. In contrast, the American military aired games for deployed servicemembers, even if the broadcast was delayed.\n\nIn the United States, baseball was considered a morale-building venture that helped Americans endure war rationing. Major League Baseball suffered from the war mobilization effort, losing most of their young talent to the draft. The average age of the players of the Major League increased steadily through the war as younger players left the field for military service. By the end of the 1944 season, many critics thought that Major League Baseball would not last another season. However, the league did survive by using players too old or not physically capable of joining the military.\n\nWhile the professional baseball leagues in the United States suffered from talent drain, Americans did not go without baseball. On the contrary, the U.S. military built powerful teams that would have rivaled many of the best baseball teams in history. Military team rosters boasted numerous all-stars, and they traveled the country and abroad playing in exhibition games to enhance the morale of those in service. Baseball exhibition games popped up every­where there were large numbers of troops. In 1943, even Major League Baseball con­sidered staging regular-season games overseas for the benefit of the troops.\n\nIn 1944, the U.S. Army suggested a plan for a World Series that pitted service teams against each other as a War Bond sales drive. According to the plan, the best-regarded military teams would play a series of games, some on military bases for the benefit of those in the service, and others in town for civilians. The Army wanted to invite the Navy’s Great Lakes team, the U.S. Army’s 20th Armored Division Team and the Parris Island base team. While this plan was not enacted, it demonstrates that the military thought of creative ways to use the popularity of baseball to support the war effort.\n\nIn September 1944, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army put two powerful sides together for the “Servicemen’s World Series.” The series took place in Hawaii and was slated to last seven games, but the series proved so popular that they ended up playing 11 games instead. The Navy walloped the Army, taking the series 8-2-1. The Army invited the Navy to play again the following year, but the Navy had shipped its all-star talent to remote bases in the Pacific to play exhibition games for deployed troops and declined the offer.\n\nWhile much of the nation’s base­ball talent coalesced into a few mil­itary super teams, the rank and file continued to play baseball too. Com­manders en­couraged athletics to help keep their Marines in fighting trim, especially when military train­­ing had become too grueling. Athletic offi­cers preparing to embark were warned that while some athletic equipment was available in supply depots in the Pacific, it was best to go and purchase softballs, baseballs, gloves, and bats where they were commercially available and take the equipment with them as there was not enough extra equipment in the supply system to go around. On nearly every island in the Pacific, engineers cleared spaces to make baseball diamonds, and intramural service leagues appeared everywhere.\n\nWhen 2nd Bn, 27th Marines of 5th Marine Division deployed from Camp Pendleton, Calif., to Camp Tarawa, Hilo, Hawaii, off-duty Marines participated in athletic leagues, including baseball leagues, at the Kamuela Athletic Field. While on duty, they trained to assault Iwo Jima as part of the V Amphibious Corps.\n\nAt Iwo Jima, the Marines of the battalion saw some of the most brutal combat of the war. When they were finally pulled off the line, the battle-weary Division was designated to land on Miyako-Jima of the Ryukyu Islands in support of the Okinawa Campaign. Their role in the battle was mercifully called off. The Division was originally slated to recover and train in Guam to prepare for the invasion of the Zhoushan Archipelago off of mainland China. The Marines were elated as they discovered that they would not stop in Guam and instead returned to the familiar Camp Tarawa.\n\nThe main body of the Division arrived in Hawaii on April 12. The Marines recuperated from their time on Iwo Jima and renamed their baseball field to Iwo Jima Field. They played baseball during the summer of 1945, and their next target changed as well. Instead of assaulting Zhoushan, they prepared to land on Kyushu the southernmost of Japan’s Home Islands, as part of Operation Olympic. Japan’s formal surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, once again changed the Marines’ mission. The Division prepared to occupy Japan. Their mission was to restore order, enforce the terms of the surrender agreement, and assist with the repatriation of the Japanese military.\n\nThe 2nd Bn, 27th Marines arrived in Japan in late September and were tasked to patrol the area in and around Saga City, the site of the future baseball game. When the 5thMarDiv arrived in Japan, the Division Special Services Office brought athletic equipment with them. Special services personnel built volleyball courts, basketball courts, football fields and baseball fields at every billeting location when possible. They organized inter-unit tournaments, and they estimated that 25 percent of Marines participated in the activities daily.\n\nAthletics played an important part in the occupation, both for the occupying forces to enhance the morale and physical fitness of war-weary combat troops waiting to return home, but also as a welcome distraction for the Japanese people, who had experienced extreme privations during the war. Ted De Bary was an interpreter sent to Tokyo and surrounding cities to survey the damage to the area sustained during the war. In a September 1945 letter to a colleague, De Bary wrote about the devastation in the cities that had been subjected to relentless bombardment. De Bary said that the people in these cities almost always steered the conversation to Major League Baseball and the 1945 season’s pennant races. He believed that to the inhabitants of Tokyo, talking about baseball was more desirable than talking about destruction.\n\nDuring the late stages of the war, most baseball stadiums in Japan had been converted to house air defense batteries and as equipment marshaling yards. General Douglas MacArthur prioritized the restoration of the stadiums to playing condition. College baseball returned in October 1945 when the Marines’ familiar opponent, Waseda University, played their archrival, Keio University. Professional baseball returned in November with some exhibition games, and the first full season since the start of the war was played in 1946.\n\nOn Sept. 22, 1945, a news release by NBC announced an Army baseball team would travel throughout Japan, playing baseball against the Japanese sides, starting with the University of Tokyo. The proceeds from each game were intended to go to war orphans. But the baseball games between American teams and Japanese teams were not necessarily popular. The formal surrender was not even three weeks old.\n\nQuite a few American servicemembers did not approve of the effort, thinking it would show how Americans could easily forgive and forget the atrocities committed by the Japanese military during the war. Army Technical Sergeant Howard Hurwitz wrote a letter to Yank magazine showing his disapproval. A poem that went into syndication in the United States mocked the effort. Often, the American public and servicemembers who did not perform occupation duty in Japan held harsher views of their former enemies than the troops that actually went to Japan. Those in Japan had more sympathy for the civilians in the area after having viewed their appalling living conditions. In November 1945 Marines reported that there were no instances where Japanese military members had violated the terms of the surrender. They also reported excellent compliance with American forces, which further elicited feelings of goodwill.\n\nThe game of Nov. 4, 1945, was not the only game between Americans and the Japanese, but the one thing that makes the footage stand out is that it was filmed in color. Other than the film, very few details of the game are available. None of the Supreme Command Allied Powers reports mention the game, nor do the 5thMarDiv’s War Diaries or command chronologies. The postwar publication, “The Spearhead; the World War II History of the 5th Marine Division” mentions a few games between Marines and locals and states that the locals were pretty good at baseball. Other than that, most of the information about the game comes from this limited piece of ephemera. A short biography of Malcolm “Mel” Waite appeared in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Private First Class Waite served as an automatic rifleman in the battalion. In the biography, he claimed that he played left field during the game, had eight RBIs, and hit for the cycle in the Marines’ 10-5 victory. He went on to play in college as a relief pitcher for the University of Washington from 1947-1951, then played for several years in semi-pro leagues before becoming a high school science teacher.\n\nThe game carried a carnival-like atmos­phere. The lot at which the game was played was named Antonelli Field, after the battalion’s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel John Antonelli. Rows of uniformed women marched in and participated in running competitions. There was a Kendo and Judo exhibition performed for the Marines, even though the Allied occupation efforts began to curb these activities in an effort to stamp out militarism. There was a group of women in black uniforms playing drums for the audience. Even though the Japanese government took a hostile stance towards baseball, the Saga team had uniforms that were in good order, and so did the Ma­rines. Throngs of civilians showed up to cheer on their team.\n\nThe filmographer at the game worked to capture the event in excellent detail. He set his camera up in different locations to capture various aspects of the game. He filmed the crowds and the scoreboards and a lot of other little details that add to the beauty of this film. After four years of brutal, terrorizing combat, the former foes got together and played a spirited game.\n\nLooking at the game, emotions must have been running high. The Marines wanted to demobilize and go home. The Japanese wanted to put their country back together, but the entertainment-deprived populace relished the opportunity to participate in the day’s festivities and while the Americans took the game with them wherever they went, the Japanese people finally got the game back. It is easy to look at the game as a return to normalcy for both groups of people using the commonly understood universal language of baseball.\n\nBy the following year, baseball returned for teams at all levels in both countries. Marine Corps Sports Hall of Famers Gil Hodges, Ted Williams, Jerry Coleman and Ted Lyons exchanged their boondockers for spikes and went back to their Major League clubs to continue their illustrious baseball careers, and the era when the U.S. military fielded the best teams in baseball ended.\n\nMCA Editor’s note: All photos are still images from video number 162591 from the United States Marine Corps History Division collection at the United States Marine Corps Film Repository at the University of South Carolina.\n\nAuthor: Kater Miller, NMMC Outreach Curator\n\nKater Miller is the outreach curator at the National Museum of the Marine Corps and has been working at the museum for 11 years.
