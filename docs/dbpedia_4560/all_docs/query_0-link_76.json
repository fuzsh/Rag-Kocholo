        "text": "Before you use the Tariff Calculator\n\nNot all qualifications are included in the Tariff, so don’t worry if you can’t find your qualification in this calculator – make sure you check the entry requirements in our search tool for the courses you’re interested in.\n\nUniversities and colleges set their own entry requirements and do not have to accept a qualification simply because it is included in the Tariff tables.\n\nUniversities and colleges don’t have to accept the Tariff value assigned by UCAS either. For example, if a university feels the content of the qualification is not fully relevant for the course you are applying to, they may tell you it's worth fewer points than UCAS has suggested, although most of the time the full Tariff points will be accepted.\n\nThe best advice is to check the entry requirements listed in UCAS' search tool, or with the course provider, to find out if your qualifications are accepted.\n\nUCAS Tariff points only apply to Level 3/SCQF Level 6 qualifications, not Level 2 qualifications such as GCSEs. This calculator covers Level 3 UK qualifications regulated by Ofqual, Qualifications in Wales, CCEA and QAA, as well as SCQF Level 6 qualifications accredited by SQA and SCQF.\n\nWhat is the purpose of the UCAS Tariff?\n\nThe UCAS Tariff provides a way for universities and colleges to draw comparisons between the wide range of qualifications they see on their applications. Being able to compare qualifications they are less familiar with against more common ones such as A levels encourages a fairer decision-making process when it comes to making offers.\n\nSome universities and colleges also use UCAS points in their entry requirements and offers, so you may need to know how many points your qualifications are worth.\n\nPlease note, the UCAS Tariff calculator is an indicative guide only. The university of college offering the course will have the final say on entry requirements.\n\nWhat else do I need to know about the UCAS Tariff?\n\nNot all universities and colleges use the Tariff when making offers – many use qualifications and grades instead.\n\nSome universities and colleges limit the qualifications they accept. For example, they may only accept Tariff points from the highest scoring three A levels or Scottish Highers.\n\nSome universities and colleges may exclude qualifications if content is duplicated in other qualifications.\n\nUniversities and college generally only count the highest level of achievement. For example, they may not count a BTEC Award if you have achieved the BTEC Certificate in the same subject, or an AS level if you have an A level in the same subject.\n\nQualifications may change over time. We aim to update the Tariff calculator annually to reflect these changes and to add new qualifications.\n\nThe Tariff is based on a finite scale, so it is not possible to get more than a certain number of points for a single award qualification. In some instances, you may see top grades of qualifications getting the same number of points.\n\nThere are lots of different BTEC qualifications listed, and not all BTEC qualifications include a D* grade. Speak to your teacher or adviser if you’re not sure which BTEC you’re studying.\n\nThe AS is positioned at 40% – or as close to 40% as possible – of the A level at each grade:\n\nAS grade A is aligned to A level grade B\n\nAS grade C is aligned to A level grade D\n\nAS grade E is below A level grade E\n\nNot all universities and colleges use the Tariff. It’s therefore really important to check the entry requirements for the course(s) you’re interested in. If you have any questions, talk to the university or college you’re applying to, or your teacher/adviser.\n\nHow to use this calculator\n\nSearch for your qualification by its title or, where available, by its number: This is usually found in qualification registers or on your certificate.\n\nEnter the subject you're studying (optional).\n\nSelect your grade from the drop-down list – the Tariff points for this qualification will display automatically next to your grade.\n\nWhen you've entered all your qualifications, click 'Next'.\n\nAdvice to help to you find your qualification\n\nMost qualification titles have been entered in the following format:\n\nAwarding body + Level + Type (Certificate/Diploma etc.) + Subject\n\nPearson BTEC Level 3 National Foundation Diploma in Business\n\nYou can search for your qualification by its awarding body (i.e. Pearson), its type (i.e. certificate) or it’s subject (i.e. business). All qualifications included in the Tariff Calculator are Level 3/SCQF Level 6. Alternatively, you can search for a qualification by its unique number. Your teacher or your school’s exams officer may be able to confirm this. The unique number will not be visible in the calculator below but it can still be entered, following this format:\n\nThree numbers/four numbers/one number or letter\n\n601/7161/3\n\nIf you hold two or more qualifications which follow on or have duplicated content, such as a Certificate in Childcare and a Diploma in Childcare, you only receive Tariff points for the highest level achieved (the Diploma) unless your university says otherwise."
