A U.S. Marine CH-53E Super Stallion with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 162 (Reinforced), 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), transports an AV-8B Harrier engine from the amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to the fleet replenishment ship USNS Big Horn (T-AO-198) during a Helicopter Support Team mission as part of Combined Composite Training Unit Exercise (COMPTUEX), Dec. 1, 2017 in the Atlantic Ocean. The exercise allows all elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to join and train in realistic scenarios so the MEU as a whole can meet its Pre-Deployment Training Program (PTP) objectives prior to their upcoming deployment at sea.
