Among the 20 contributions are personal accounts, discussion of mind control and of the historical background to helping cult victims, and case studies. Guidelines for facilitating recovery are given in separate chapters for therapists, clergy, support groups, families, and psychiatric hospital personnel. Special issues such as children and cults, ritualistic abuse of children in day-care centers, teen satanism, and legal considerations are addressed. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc.
