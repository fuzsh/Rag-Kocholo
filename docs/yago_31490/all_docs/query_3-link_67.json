        "text": "I was recruited into the New Age doomsday cult, Universal Knowledge (formerly known as Life Integration Programmes), led by cult leader Natasha Lakaev and remained under her control from the age of 21 to 35. I escaped with my three children in January, 2010.\n\n​\n\nI say 'escape', because I was threatened by Lakaev that if I left, she would report me to the Department of Child Safety (DoCS) as an abusive mother, sign off as a Psychologist, and have my three children taken from me.\n\n​\n\nLakaev became a registered psychologist in November 2008 and is still registered as a Clinical Psychologist with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), (and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), United Kingdom), despite scores of complaints submitted against her to AHPRA and the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC) NSW.\n\nI was indoctrinated to believe that Lakaev was a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, the Queen of Atlantis, and \"one of 12 on the Intergalactic Council of the Universe\". She prophesied that the world would end in an Armageddon scenario around 11:11:11 (later 12:12:12) and said there would be few survivors apart from herself and her group and that we and our children would only survive if we remained with her.\n\n​\n\nThis may seem odd and bizarre and you may think that I must have been crazy to believe in such nonsense. However, I consider myself to be a normal, everyday person who is intelligent, and yet I found myself in this situation.\n\n​\n\nFrom a young age, every week at Mass in the Catholic Church I was told: \"Jesus will come again\".\n\nAfter initial 'love bombing' and mind control techniques had been utilised, when this manipulative and persuasive personality presented herself as a reincarnation or 'shaft' of Jesus Christ and preached that the world as we know it would end, these concepts did not seem so far-fetched in my mind.\n\n​\n\nRECRUITMENT\n\nPeople do not 'join' cults. Individuals or families in vulnerable stages of their lives are recruited via coercive and deceptive methods to become involved with a seemingly legitimate group or movement.\n\n​\n\nCultic extremist ideology can manifest via any of the following and more:\n\n​\n\na 1:1 relationship (family member, partner, friend, boss)\n\nextremist off-shoots of institutional religion including Christianity, Islamism, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism\n\nnew religious movements\n\nNew Age spiritual groups\n\nEastern meditation groups\n\npersonal development companies\n\npolitical movements\n\npyramid schemes\n\nstep programs\n\nonline influencers\n\n'fake' news or conspiracy theories\n\nsocial groups, clubs, eg. yoga, gym, dance\n\nterrorist groups\n\n​\n\nFACTORS WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE TO VULNERABILITY\n\n​\n\nwhile searching for meaning, purpose, and belonging\n\nwhen recovering from childhood or adult trauma\n\nafter the loss of a loved one\n\nwhen coping with a chronic or terminal disease\n\nafter leaving the parental home for the first time\n\nwhile at university where students are idealistic, trying to make new friends and willing to try new things\n\nwhile unemployed, looking for a job\n\nafter a divorce or relationship breakup\n\nPERSONALITY OF CULT LEADERS\n\n​\n\nCult leaders generally display the traits of a charismatic Narcissist, with an Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic or Paranoid Personality Disorder.(2)(3) Therefore, it is very easy for unsuspecting bystanders to be susceptible to their coercive persuasion/undue influence.\n\n​\n\nRETENTION OF MEMBERS\n\n​\n\nCults use Mind Control or Thought Reform techniques to retain their followers including:\n\n​\n\ninitial 'love bombing'\n\nlong hours of indoctrination/repetition of the group's specific ideology\n\nhypnosis - excessive meditation, chanting or singing\n\nloaded language\n\ngroup think\n\npeer pressure\n\ncommunication control\n\nsleep deprivation\n\nfood deprivation\n\nexcessive exercise\n\nphysical exhaustion through mindless activity and overwork\n\nisolation\n\nmonitoring movements\n\ncontrolling access to money and resources\n\ncontrolling relationships\n\ncontrolling how you dress, wear your hair\n\nphobia induction\n\nshaming, humiliation and shunning\n\npsychological manipulation\n\nverbal abuse\n\nthreat of harm/instilling fear/punishments\n\nphysical violence\n\nproselytising an ‘end of the world’ Armageddon ideology\n\nMembers are separated from their family and friends and social support network. Before they realise what is happening, the group's indoctrination is ingrained in their psyche through sophisticated thought reform and they are no longer able to think critically.\n\n​\n\nCult members are then trapped in a 'prison' with or without walls, until they 'wake up'; are expelled/ex-communicated; are de-programmed or de-radicalised via intervention; or get to a point where their current circumstances are so bad that losing their salvation or the prospect of death is a better alternative (as was the case with me). ​\n\n​\n\nMyself and scores of others were abused by Natasha Lakaev, who used mind control to yield power, money, sex, and glorification within a high demand group.\n\n​\n\nI wish to help educate family and friends of current and former cult members, so that they are better able to understand the process of mind control and support their loved ones through recovery.\n\n​\n\nI hope that sharing my story, personal insights and triumphs, will also help support fellow ex-cult members and prevent others from becoming involved in these dangerous groups.\n\nBook Reviews\n\n​​\n\nAn absorbing and informative account of an abusive Australian cult that needs to be read.\n\n​\n\nThe Cult Effect is an honest, grounded and, more often than not, terrifying recounting of a young woman's 13 year journey spent within an organisation that sought to brainwash and mind control its followers into giving their finances, labour and selves to its leader. You really get a sense of 'seeing behind the curtain' here with this account being from within the circle that is more often than not only seen from the outside.\n\nThe result is a self-reflective telling of a story that explains how young people can be tricked into organisations and made to stay in them against their will. We see that these people are not at all gullible or easily fooled. It is the cults themselves that are clever enough to twist people until they don't know which way is up.\n\nI admit I found it hard to put this book down. It's a credit to the book that such a distressing read can be so engagingly written and yet still retain its objectivity despite how deeply the author was entwined with the events. The statement at the front that truth often is stranger than fiction certainly holds its own here...\n\n​\n\nHenry Boffin (Goodreads)\n\n​"
