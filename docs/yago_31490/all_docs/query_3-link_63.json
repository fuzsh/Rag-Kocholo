Whether you are:\n\nin a high-control group or a cult\n\ntrying to figure out if you are in one\n\ntrying to help someone else get out of a one\n\nHere are resources here for you:\n\nIF you think you are a part of one of these groups- don’t freak out! Don’t ask your leaders if you are in one because they will lie to you and put you on their radar as a trouble maker. Instead, take a breath, take some time to educate yourself, and research to see if there are any allegations against the leaders or leadership. I also recommend reading Combatting Cult Mind Control by Stephen Hassan… finally, find an exit counsellor. If you managed to get out and haven’t done any counseling, I highly recommend doing THAT… And I personally LOVED the book, Take Back your Life by Janja Lalich.\n\nI am NOT a trained professional; I only have my own experience but all of these sites, people, books, or TV programs/films have helped me over the last few years.
