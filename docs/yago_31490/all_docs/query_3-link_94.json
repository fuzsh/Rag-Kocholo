        "text": "Almost immediately at the start of the recent Netflix documentary Strip Down, Rise Up, viewers get a glimpse into a world of women gyrating, thrashing, and giving it their all in a multi-class pole-dancing workshop. Under the guidance of S Factor owner Sheila Kelley, the women, via intense dancing, break down and break through patriarchal barriers to their sexuality and femininity. After spending more than a year on edge in my tiny apartment, I found the intimacy, rawness, and the self-expression riveting to behold — which made me reflect on how, for many, transformative classes like these can fill voids and offer a new kind of wellness space.\n\nI considered taking the S Factor as soon as the pandemic let up, but when I read reviews of the film, some likened Kelley to a cult leader, “an exploiter of trauma and intense displays of emotion for at best self-promotion and at worst sadistic pleasure.” Whether you would classify Kelley’s class as cult-like or not, many of us have found ourselves entranced or at least intrigued by some sort of communal group, gathering, or organization that promises ways in which we can better our lives. Be it certain kinds of yoga, CrossFit, a self-help class, or even a spirited Facebook group, these spaces can sometimes start to feel a little aggressive in their insistence that users and participants get with their program.\n\nBut, as Rachel Bernstein, a cult-recovery psychotherapist and the host of the IndoctriNation podcast, points out, “When people are feeling desperate and shaken up, they will be more open to a message that feels reassuring without necessarily evaluating the messenger.”\n\nBernstein defines a real cult as a closed system in which someone must give unquestioning devotion to prescribed beliefs and an unchecked leader. She says the top-three reasons people join cults is that they have a) been going through a difficult time, b) are isolated and long for an experience of belonging, and c) crave transformation — a pathway to a better version of themselves. A mild case of all three might cause someone to join, say, a Barry’s Bootcamp class, but for someone who’s in deeper pain, it’s the trifecta of susceptibility to leaders and ideologies that will prey on vulnerable people for profit and exploitation. But, no matter the end of the spectrum, the line between what constitutes an actual cult and a quasi-cult — or what is simply a feat of modern-day marketing’s ability to draw us in and keep us hooked — has become blurry.\n\nBikram yoga practicers at the annual Mind Over Madness event in Times Square on June 20, 2012.\n\nWe’ve all heard of the “cult of Apple,” referring to people, many of whom are in the tech industry, who only buy Apple products and await knowledge of the latest products with bated breath. When marketing mixes with the addictive endorphins of exercise, it spawns crazes like CrossFit and SoulCycle, both of which have been referred to as cults in the media.\n\nOther organizations that are spiritually oriented have cult-like aspects. Yoga and meditation, now lauded by the medical field, have had communities with abusive leaders for centuries. Rationalists like Christopher Hitchens and Bill Maher refer to organized religion, with its superstitious beliefs and groupthink, as cults. Despite Alcoholics Anonymous being a program that benefits millions, Bernstein has treated people who have survived the controlling leadership of its sponsors. So, depending on whom you ask, anything can be considered a cult — from Navy SEALs and the Marines to Reddit to Weight Watchers to those GameStop bros.\n\nBut while cautionary tales about cults abound, the number of places and spaces that promise belonging and acceptance through certain types of groupthink only continues to grow. With an increasing number of harmful groups promoting disinformation and violence, how do we tend to our need — after the isolation of the past year, in which some of us incurred tremendous loss, came close to death, or simply recognized just how fragile life is — to make the best of our lives moving forward? To connect with ourselves and others in a deeply meaningful way without self-sacrificing or coming into harm’s way?\n\nIf you’re drawn to a personal-growth group that you sense could help you recover from a brutal time, it may be worth exploring. But it’s also important to remember there are ways to join and participate responsibly.\n\nDo your research\n\nAs Bernstein says, when we’re down and out, we’re more susceptible to certain kinds of messaging and are many times willing to overlook any troubling signs in favor of that which might immediately lift us up. This is why it’s so important to research leaders and their organizations. Daniel Shaw, LCSW, a cult-recovery psychotherapist and the author of the forthcoming Traumatic Narcissism and Recovery, used to tell people to go online, put in the name of their group, and next to it put the words “cult,” “abuse,” or “ex-members” to see what comes up. But these days there’s a catch.\n\n“There is so much disinformation out there that is part of the problem,” Shaw says. He warns seekers “to pay attention to the sources.” Disinformation can work both ways. Propaganda will be spun to protect controlling groups that profit off their members, such as Scientology’s rebuttal to Leah Remini speaking out against the religion.\n\nBut propaganda can also defame a teacher or community of practice involved in a scandal that shouldn’t define their entire value. Tenku Ruff, a Zen Buddhist priest who heads a temple in Beacon, New York, cites the Zen Center of Los Angeles as an example of one that fired an abusive teacher and rebuilt itself under new leadership with ethics, checks, and balances. Hatha-yoga master John Friend was accused of sex scandals and the gross mismanagement of his company Anusara Yoga, in what was dubbed Anusaragate, but the organization ousted the corrupt leader and continues under the new name Ekhart Yoga.\n\nRuff points to the following teacher deal breakers: If the current leader is or has been accused of having sex with their students or congregants; if the organization charges ghastly fees for next-level courses; if the organization doesn’t have an ethics statement (you should ask to see one); and if the teacher is accountable only to themself, rather than an organization such as a committee or a board.\n\nYou must evaluate the information that’s out there and, Ruff recommends, key into your own intuition.\n\nYou must evaluate the information that’s out there and key into your own intuition\n\nTest the leader and groupthink\n\nWhile Ruff recommends relying on intuition in selecting a path, she admits that in the face of a strong, charismatic leader and group pull, it can be impossible to do so. Ruff partook in a Buddhist training in which she felt something was off, but when a group of students began to praise their teacher as the very best, she lost touch with her own internal compass, stayed involved, and got hurt in the process.\n\nShaw, Bernstein, and Ruff all agree that you must be able to ask questions to address your doubts and challenge what is being taught if it doesn’t add up. If the teacher or the community brushes off your inquiries, if strict obedience is required and shame is used in response to noncompliance, it’s a bad sign. In addition, one should be aware of the difference between suggestions and orders. A teacher may have useful recommendations for what you should do, but when they approach you with demands about what you need to do next, you’re in the sphere of a controlling figure.\n\nRuff advises seekers to approach the path with a healthy balance of faith, doubt, and determination. “Those three things have to act as a base,” she says. “If a teacher can’t handle your questions, that’s a big flag, but if you have only questions, that’s a flag for yourself.”\n\nDo no harm\n\nIt seems obvious: Don’t follow someone who compels you to trespass, destroy other’s property, or use violence against yourself or others. But, according to a series of psychological studies in the ’60s, it is very difficult to hold on to your own morals once under the influence of a powerful authority. In addition, less obvious forms of harm may be harder to decipher. For example, in the quest for “purification” and transcendent experiences, people may fast or sit in compromising positions for a long time, sweat until literal death in a sauna or sweat lodge, or move into yoga poses their body isn’t cut out for.\n\n“We’re raised with ‘no pain, no gain’ messages about going for it,” Bernstein says. “What gets lost is evaluating if pushing [oneself into a transcendent experience] is healthy, necessary, and how it’s going to have any kind of interplay with your life moving forward.”\n\nAccording to India Oxenberg in her Starz documentary Seduced, the group of women who signed up to be physically branded as part of a sex ring in the NXIVM cult were too enthralled with the leader, and too deep in the groupthink, to clearly see what was happening as harm. If a practice feels like harm to you, it likely is. Ask yourself: Are you being propelled to push yourself to have an intensive, transformative experience for you, or is it so that you feel indebted to the teacher or group?\n\nPeople exercise at an outside CrossFit gym.\n\nKnow what you want going in and when to leave\n\nWhen entering a personal-growth experience or spiritual community, it helps to have an end result in mind. “The goal shouldn’t be to follow the teacher forever but to get tools for standing on your own,” Ruff says.\n\nIn my 20s, in the era before mental-health awareness and the popularity of Prozac, I was depressed but didn’t know it. I longed to discover who I was and how to help myself feel better. I moved into the ashram of a powerful guru, where I received the structure, experiences, and interactions that helped me cope. When I started to feel bored, I left.\n\nI was lucky. Shortly after I left, due to an article written in The New Yorker that detailed the power-hungry aspects of my teacher as well as the sexual misconduct of her teacher before her, I discovered that hundreds of people were hurt by her and her predecessor. I believe the clarity of knowing what I wanted out of it helped keep me safe.\n\nRuff says, “A teacher should encourage you to use the tools more for yourself.” But, no matter what a teacher says, keep an eye out for the differences between what a teacher is saying and what a teacher actually does to control their students and inspire an unhealthy kind of attachment.\n\nStay in contact with your friends and family, and take breaks\n\nAny group that demands you leave your friends and family if they don’t agree with your new beliefs should be automatically rejected. This is a signature way that a system will isolate you so that you can be controlled to work in its favor.\n\nBut, Bernstein warns, the problem is that the positive feelings inspired by connection and certain practices activate hormones and even a type of disassociation from oneself that feels euphoric. “When you feel drawn in like a drug, it’s a scene that’s been manufactured, and has created a high and intensity that reinforces you are part of a special community.”\n\nIf you feel compelled to have that next big experience with a group, Bernstein recommends thinking of it like a drug and taking a break. “As soon as that [addictive] part of your brain is fired up,” she says, “it quiets the parts that are your higher level functioning.”\n\nFind the right fit\n\nI quickly realized that learning how to pole dance in the S Factor was not the right medicine for me. But the yearning inspired me to consider my needs for more expressive ways of moving my body and more meaningful ways of connecting with other women to help me recover from a difficult year. After all we’ve endured, we should be able to honor our need to connect, heal, and grow. The goal is to do it safely.\n\nBlair Glaser is an executive leadership consultant and storyteller who's written for publications such as Greatist, Huffington Post and The Muse.
