        "text": "Currently there are at least four major, identifiable perspectives on how people best understand and recover from religious abuse. These basic theoretical viewpoints are:\n\n(a) thought-reform or mind-control perspective,\n\n(b) deliberative or Conversionist conceptualization,\n\n(c) psychosocial needs-based perspective and finally\n\n(d) dynamic-systems approach.\n\nBoth secular and faith-based (Christian) adherents can be variously identified in each of these perspectives. All these viewpoints have various strengths and limitations. Each is helpful to the extent possible, given the limitations of its assumptions. A larger contextual approach is helpful to better understand involvement in and recovery from religiously abusive environments.\n\nAs a result of decades of personal religious abuse recovery, study and coaching practice this book suggests an integrative model SECURE for the benefit of clinicians, supportive loved ones and former members.\n\nBook Reviews by Dr. Patrick J.
