        "text": "Alcoholics Anonymous offers help for people seeking respite from substance abuse. Its active members proudly tout the effectiveness of group’s teachings. Despite lack of hard evidence, AA has helped countless people find a better way of life. There is no disputing that. But though the program works for many recovering alcoholics, outsiders (and even ones in recovery) often see AA members as religious zealous. Many alcoholics who try leaving the group feel betrayed and ostracized by AA members who fear other methods of recovery. Platitudes originating from the group’s deceased founder Bill W. ring like cult-speak (“it works if you work it” and “we are only as sick as our secrets”). All these peculiarities perpetuated by Alcoholics Anonymous beg the question, “Does AA qualify as a cult?”\n\nObjectively Qualifying Cults\n\nStrange as it sounds, Michael D. Langone, PhD developed a cult checklist in the early 1990s. His doctorate in clinical psychology and decades of experience interviewing cult members bolster his unique expertise in the field of cult studies. The cult checklist has since undergone decades of revision and refinement with the help of other qualified experts in the field of mental health. Its most current version was published in ICSA Today, 6(3), 2015. We aim to qualify or disqualify each of the 15 checkpoints by scrutinizing the practices of AA.\n\nSo, does AA qualify as a cult? Let’s take a closer look. Each checklist point “Pass” verdict will add a point to AA’s cult score.\n\n#10 – #13\n\n#10 Cutting Off Support: Subservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and to radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before they joined the group.\n\n#11 Membership Growth: The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.\n\n#12 Greed: The group is preoccupied with making money.\n\n#13 Time Commitment: Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities."
