        "text": "Recovering from Aesthetic Realism\n\nHow to deal with the after effects\n\nAnyone who's spent any time in a mind-control cult will be impacted psychologically by the experience, and AR is no different. This shouldn't be a surprise: The purpose of a cult is to get its members to believe that the group is the most important thing in the world, and to do that they have to get inside your head. They weaken your ego, so they can induce powerful feelings of guilt. You get criticized a lot. And any time you question the group at all, they tell you it's because of a personal failing inside yourself. Anything bad that happens is your fault. If they're successful then you wind up blaming yourself for things even if the group leaders don't. That kind of experience is incredibly damaging.\n\nCould anyone come out of that experience and not be affected by it?!\n\nMaybe you think that now that you see your group for the cult it was, everything's better now. If so, then great. But for a lot of people, simply knowing that their group was in fact a cult isn't enough to erase the damage. Your mind can know that you have nothing to feel guilty about, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't feel it anyway. You can't choose your feelings.\n\nHere are a couple of (non-cult) examples. My mom took me to see Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory when I was three years old. There's a scene where a little girl eats some purple candy she wasn't supposed to, and she balloons up to be ten times her normal size. That scene freaked me out and I started crying and screaming, and my mother had to take me out of the theater. Years later when I was in high school I saw the movie again, and when that scene came around, I wasn't scared, but my stomach knotted itself anyway and I certainly felt uncomfortable. Even though I knew I had nothing to fear, I felt it anyway. As another example, there's something from my childhood which I know wasn't my fault, but to this day I still have dreams about it.\n\nMargaret Singer, who pioneered research into destructive cults, came up with some characteristics of post-cult trauma syndrome. Here's a partial list:\n\nfear of going insane\n\nconfusion about right and wrong\n\nsexual conflicts\n\nunwarranted guilt\n\nspontaneous crying\n\nsense of loss\n\npanic disproportionate to one's circumstances\n\ndepression & suicidal thoughts\n\nfear that not obeying the cult's wishes will result in God's wrath or loss of salvation [or in AR, the ability to know the truth and to be happy]\n\nalienation from family, friends\n\nsense of isolation, loneliness due to being surrounded by people who have no basis for understanding cult life\n\nfear of evil spirits taking over one's life outside the cult\n\nscrupulosity, excessive rigidity about rules of minor importance\n\nShe supplemented with some other effects that ex-members often experience:\n\nsimplistic black-white thinking\n\ndisassociation (spacing out)\n\ndifficulty concentrating\n\nincapacity to make decisions\n\nmental confusion\n\nlow self-esteem\n\ndread of running into a current cult-member by mistake\n\nloss of a sense of how to carry out simple tasks\n\ndread of being cursed or condemned by the cult\n\ndifficulty managing time\n\ntrouble holding down a job (see Singer's complete list)\n\nCult experts recognize that people who leave cults have special challenges for getting over their experience. Most counselors and therapists aren't equipped to help ex-cult members in this way. If you seek counseling, it's crucial to choose a counselor who has specific training and experience in helping ex-cult members. Here's a list of some resources:\n\nBooks\n\nTake Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships (Janja Lalich, 2006) Exactly what it says.\n\nRecovery from Cults: Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse (Michael Langone, 1995)\n\nCult Survivors Handbook: How to live in the material world again (Nori Muster, 2001)\n\nReleasing the Bonds: Empowering people to think for themselves (Steve Hassan, 2000) A handbook for those trying to rescue a loved one from a cult. It doesn't have a lot about recovery, but the explanations of how brainwashing works can help former cult members make sense of their experience.\n\nCults in Our Midst: The continuing fight against their hidden mennace (Margaret Singer, 1996) This is a landmark book about how cults use mind control.\n\nCounselors & Therapists (rates per session as of Jan. 2017)\n\nRosanne Henry (Littleton, CO) ($120)\n\nRachel A. Bernstein (Encino, CA) ($225)\n\nSara L.
