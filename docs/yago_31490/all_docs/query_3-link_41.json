        "text": "Introducing CE Course: Religious Trauma in Clinical Settings\n\nReceive 1.5 Continuing Education Credit\n\nReligious Trauma in Clinical Settings is a clinical course to support therapists, clinicians, counselors and other helping professionals understand religious trauma in a deeper way. I teach you the three types of religious trauma, as well as the emotional and psychological impact and symptoms.\n\nThe course is available now.\n\nRegister Now\n\nTherapists:\n\nAre you ready to become an expert on helping religious trauma clients?\n\nDo you feel completely lost when it comes to supporting clients with religious trauma?\n\nMost graduate programs don't focus on the nuances of religious trauma and cult abuse, leaving us feeling lost and overwhelmed when these clients walk through our therapy doors. We sit with our religious trauma or cult abuse clients and think... Could I be doing more for them? Am I helping them enough?\n\nYou no longer have to feel so alone in treating religious or cult trauma clients.\n\nSurvivors:\n\nAre you ready to have an expert walk you through how to recover after religious trauma or a culty experience?\n\nAre you feeling lost in knowing how to recover from your experience?\n\nFeeling overwhelmed in recovery is the most common experience amongst survivors. You are walking way from a world where you were completely submerged in the rules, rigidity and demands of that groups. So it totally makes sense that you are feeling overwhelmed. Now you're out in a different world to stay safe, heal your nervous system, and find a healthy way forward.\n\nYou are not alone. We offer two ways to get religious and cult trauma support.\n\nI was in need of some real support. I looked for therapists that specialized in this sort of trauma and after weeks of searching, I realized no one in my area specialized in these experiences.\n\nNow, over 13 years later, I've worked with hundreds of therapy and coaching clients and taught over 100 therapists how to treat religious trauma and cult abuse. I feel so privileged to get to teach survivors and therapists each day and I want to make that support accessible to you.\n\nI've taken all of the knowledge that I've learned and put together a collection of courses for survivorsand therapists."
