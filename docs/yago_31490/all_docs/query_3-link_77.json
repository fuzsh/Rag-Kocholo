        "text": "Featured Conference Presentation at Not Alone: A Conference for Survivors and Helping Professionals: Re-establishing Faith After Spiritual Abuse - Presented by Kent Burtner, M.Div., M.A “I thought I trusted God, and look what happened.” When cults, high control groups or unhealthy churches use psychological and social control to enforce their ideology, and do so in the name of God or some other divinity, their subject's lives are violated to the core of their being. They thought they were trusting in a God that would provide for them but found their lives emotionally, vocationally financially and spiritually turned inside out. Recovering from spiritual abuse and re-establishing faith is a difficult project at best and most often is the last task that a survivor of spiritual abuse is able to undertake. This workshop will examine the issues of: -- trust, -- free will, -- how spiritual emotions are manipulated and healed, -- deconstructing a sick theology that reinforced the coercive control used by abusive groups, -- reconnecting with resources of spiritual wisdom, -- how to safely explore the institutions that carry that wisdom and -- making meaning from a new vision informed by an awareness of what was hurtful in the past. --- Kent Burtner, M. Div., M.A., served as a Roman Catholic priest of the Dominican Order for 20 years, resigning from the priesthood in 1994. He subsequently served as program manager for an interfaith social-services agency, director of the agency’s Cult Resource Center, public-information officer for a local county public-health department, and parish business manager. A published author, Kent has also lectured extensively in the United States, Canada and Spain. In 1983, he received the Leo J. Ryan Award from the Cult Awareness Network for his work educating the public about cults and thought-reform programs. Kent makes his home in Portland, Oregon and as a pastoral counselor.

Spiritual Abuse & Adult Clergy Sexual Abuse: How Does it Happen and How Are They Connected - Presented by Anna Tolf This presentation examines the intersectionality of spiritual abuse and sexual abuse of adults. Survivors of abuse in religious environments often have the experience of living with profound, lifelong wounds while not having access to the language for their experience. As a result, many are disbelieved, blamed and silenced by the institutions they trusted. It has only been in recent years that research has begun to address this hermeneutical injustice through the development of a conceptual understanding of spiritual abuse. As this knowledge base has broadened, there has also been an effort to develop accurate language for adult clergy sexual abuse. Due to the reality that many victims of abuse experience poly-victimization across their lifespan; it is helpful to identify how these two types of abuse overlap. Spiritual abuse is characterized by control and manipulation, it can also be a tool used to groom victims of adult clergy sexual abuse. In the research, identifiable patterns have been noted in the grooming process including the characteristics that make someone vulnerable to both spiritual abuse and adult clergy sexual abuse. In order to understand the nuanced and complex nature of these two forms of abuse, it is helpful to name these vulnerabilities and patterns. In the naming, we are both able to help survivors heal and prevent the traumatic re-enactment of abuse and abusive environments. --- Anna Tolf, Co-Founder of Restored Voices Collective, a nonprofit championing survivors of Adult Clergy Sexual Abuse, brings a unique blend of advocacy and empathy to the forefront. Currently finishing her academic tenure pursuing a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology at the Seattle School of Theology and Psychology, Anna combines academic excellence with a survivor-centered approach to her work. With a deep commitment to trauma-informed therapy, Anna draws from personal experiences of religious trauma and institutional betrayal, fostering an environment of understanding and healing. This firsthand perspective enriches Anna's work, creating a bridge between theory and the lived reality of survivors. Anna’s healing journey was a process which began in her role of Executive Pastor at a church in the Seattle area. As a result, she has a nuanced understanding of the intersections between faith, trauma, and the journey to restoration.

Kenneth Garrett, MDiv. DMin. To most Christians, joining and supporting a local church is an important, even sacred aspect of their faith. The decision to commit to a spiritual community can be one of the deepest community commitments a person makes in life, and the decision to leave a beloved church can be equally significant. What shall a person do when their beloved church becomes a place of coercion, control, and spiritual abuse? Should they immediately walk away? Confront abusive leaders? Stay and hope for a change as a loyal opposition? These are all possible decisions, and all represent the end of deep, heartfelt, and often heart-breaking deliberation. In this workshop Pastor Ken will draw from his own experience of leaving an abusive Christian church and his studies in the processes of thought-reform that can occur in unhealthy, hurtful church communities. We will develop a working model to help a church member negotiate the difficulties and decisions faced when their church becomes abusive. --- Rev. Kenneth Garrett, MDiv. DMin. is senior pastor of Grace Church, Portland, OR. For 12 years Ken and his wife Sharon belonged to an abusive, controlling church in which their life-choices, beliefs, and behaviors were increasingly brought under the control of church leaders. Ken and Sharon left church in 1996 with their three daughters. Ken attended seminary and has completed post-graduate research in spiritual abuse as it occurs in Christian churches. Ken and Sharon now enjoy many opportunities to counsel and care for survivors of abusive churches from the Portland-metro area and have established the Spiritual Abuse Forum for Education (SAFE), a regular gathering to promote friendship and education for survivors of spiritual abuse. Ken's book, In the House of Friends: Understanding and Healing from Spiritual Abuse in the Christian Church, (Wipf and Stock Press, 2020) describes the inner workings of high-control churches, the pastors who lead them, and the process of leaving and recovering from the abuse inflicted by such churches.

We all know the first steps are getting away from the abuse, but then what? And then what after that? There are no concrete steps everyone has to walk, but there are some guide rails we can know about that can keep us on the path forward. In this talk, Chris will cover these basics and how to build a more healthy life, relationships and mental health for yourself after escaping a coercive situation. --- Chris Shelton is a former Scientologist turned cult recovery specialist, author and broadcaster.

Chris holds a Masters in the Psychology of Coercive Control and is a Research Assistant at the University of Salford in Manchester. He runs a YouTube channel, produces a weekly podcast called Speaking of Cults and has written Scientology A to Xenu: An Insider's Guide to What Scientology is Really All About.
