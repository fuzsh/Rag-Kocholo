        "text": "Much of the self-help programs use techniques like those used in cults. For example, high-arousal techniques that serve to shut down critical thinking: chanting, long hours of meditation, public confessions, loud or reverberating music, etc. These techniques induce a type of trance that leads people to believe they had a unique insight or awakening attributed to the leaders (“coaches”) of the programs, when in fact these were simply normal brain responses to the high-arousal input. This caused them to want to go back for more once the “high” wore off.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the human potential movement had a big impact on our society so that people turned away from traditional therapy and tried all sorts of new things. There was also the influence of many Eastern “gurus” who came to the US after the immigration laws were changed in the late 1960s. People were told to ignore Western medicine and indulge in the new methods that were being offered. This also generated a quick-fix mentality in many people who believed that traditional therapy took too long. They wanted something that would work right away.\n\nIn my opinion, there are no gurus, at least not the ones who are well-known and have followings. They are typically fake – narcissists who get off on their power and their ability to attract and influence followers. Most gurus, such as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Sai Baba, Amma and many others, have been duly recognized as not being “enlightened” but rather as con artists and exploiters – and in some cases, sexual abusers and pedophiles.\n\nIt is important for people looking for answers to their issues to be wise and careful consumers. This industry is rife with ego-driven individuals who will use and abuse their clientele. Do your research. Pretend you’re buying a car. You would never buy the first car you look at. The internet has a wealth of information about most of these individuals and their programs. See what the critics have to say. Ask a lot of questions (for example, is one able to criticize or contradict, how are the funds used, what are the real credentials, is there transparency, what does the program actually involve?) and if your questions aren't answered or are turned back on you (for example, “try it and see for yourself” or “you don’t know enough yet to ask that question”), that’s definitely a red flag.\n\nUnfortunately, the self-help movement has become a journey in selfishness and self-centeredness. Just as Transcendental Meditation promised that mobs of meditators could reduce crime rates or bring world peace – all those are empty, bogus promises that keep people wrapped up in themselves rather than doing anything for real social change. The source was the New Age movement and its harmful belief that “we create our own reality.” That type of thinking allows for much shaming and blaming of victims. We saw that during the Reagan era with the AIDS epidemic.\n\nCult leaders will always say followers are free to choose. But part of the program is to lead you to believe (by mechanisms mentioned above) that THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT IS BEING PROMISED. So, it becomes an illusion of choice, or what I call “bounded choice,” meaning that you know exactly what to choose to stay in the good graces of the leader and continue on the path. To choose otherwise implies death – literal or figurative.\n\nMy book, Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships, which has been around since 1994, offers a detailed description and explanation of post-cult aftereffects and can be especially helpful for therapists with such clients. Another of my books, Escaping Utopia: Growing Up in a Cult, Getting Out and Starting Over, will educate therapists about the experiences and residual trauma of those born or raised in a cult. I offer Zoom courses for helping professionals (with CE credits) with a colleague of mine, who is a survivor and now an experienced trauma therapist extremely knowledgeable on the neuroscientific advances in understanding brain reactions. For information on the next series of courses, I recommend contacting me through my website www.janjalalich.com and asking to be on the professionals mailing list for announcements.\n\nMormonism is one of the oldest cults and has changed over time (to some degree) and has done an excellent job of mainstreaming, which has allowed it to avoid more scrutiny. There are ideologies and practices that, taken together, I consider cultic. They include (but are not limited to) an all-or-nothing belief system; the anti-homosexuality stance; in some cases, engaging in so-called “conversion therapy” and/or dire threats to gays in the temple (for example, I’ve had more than a few gay ex-Mormons tell me they were told to kill themselves as there is no hope or future for them); policies that favor men over women (misogyny); required missions for young people that serve as indoctrination to bind them to the group; financially supporting political causes which violates the 501c3 non-profit status."
