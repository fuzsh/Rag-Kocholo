        "text": "Steven Hassan, Combatting Cult Mind Control, Park Street Press, 1990\n\nOne of the classics on controlling groups from a former high-level Moonie who has since dedicated his life to helping others. Includes good descriptions of how cults operate as well as examples of Hassan's approach to helping people recover from them.\n\nSteven Hassan, Releasing The Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves, Aitan Publishing Company, 2000\n\nAnother solid book from Steve Hassan, who was himself a high-level Moonie. The major focus of this text is, as might be surmised, helping people who have recently left a coercive group. Hassan has developed a 'strategic intervention' approach that is much softer than the older 'deprogramming' methods.\n\nDeborah Layton, Seductive Poison: A Jonestown Survivor's Story of Life and Death in the Peoples Temple, Anchor Books/Doubleday, 1999\n\nA clarion warning for people seeking meaning who might join an authoritarian groups. For the uninitiated, Jim Jones led his cult first into the jungle of Guyana and then into mass suicide. Layton was one of the few that survived and her story is a spellbinding and alarming tale.\n\nWilliam Sargant, Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brainwashing, Malor Books, 1997\n\nAn academic, yet very readable, classic for the serious reader on conversion from an NY Psychology professor. It examines in detail the step-by-step process of conversion and, in particular, breaking point at which we crack.\n\nMadeleine Landau Tobias, Janja Lalich, Michael Langone, Captive Hearts, Captive Minds : Freedom and Recovery from Cults and Other Abusive Relationships, Hunter House, 1994\n\nA detailed look at the process of recovery from a conversion experience, with a particular focus on helping those directly involved. Includes analysis of cults and their leaders and how they operate."
