        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt has become increasingly challenging for clergy, counselors, educators, and other helping professionals to understand the complexities of the physical, emotional, and relational abuse taking place under the name of religious belief. At the same time, a shift in the postmodern perception of how one defines truth within a continually increasing level of cultural religious pluralism has resulted in an obscured definition of traditional cultural values (Groothuis, 2000). With the explosive amount of information available from the Internet and the desire for quick and easy answers, those with an interest in cultic studies are frequently prone to accept a simplistic, piecemeal, and often reductionist understanding of others’ religious beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, when they endeavor to understand harmful religious behavior and how one might recover from its effects, they can easily feel overwhelmed. In this paper, I survey some of the inherent challenges associated with this effort to understand religious abuse: (a) diverse definitions; (b) varying philosophies and theologies; (c) unclear role of mind control; (d) complexity and variability of experiences; (e) sustaining objectivity in the abused; and (f) limitations of published integrative resources (i.e., Christian apologetics, sociology, psychology, theology, cultic studies, and philosophy).\n\nFirst, terminology challenges are inherent in this study (Langone, M., & Chambers, W., 1991; Langone, M., 2015); to help counter the lack of clarity in terms, this book includes a glossary (see Appendix A). The term cult itself can be significantly challenging (Rosedale, Langone, Bradshaw, & Eichel, 2015). For example, cult easily engenders unhelpful stereotyped impressions of extreme religious groups, such as the death of 918 people on November 18, 1978, at The Peoples Temple, known as the Jonestown Massacre (Layton, 1999). I have previously suggested that By ‘cult’ is meant a group that holds to beliefs or practices that clearly contradict the Bible in many of its central teachings, while promoting a sinful form of dependency on others, especially on its leader (Knapp, P., 2000, p. 4). However, the term cult can too easily be used in a pejorative or dismissive way to refer to those with whom we do not agree, and it now seems more meaningful and pragmatic to use a broader and more inclusive term that is easily applicable in varying degrees to all religious environments. Therefore, I do not use cult in this paper except when I quote others who use the term. I use the concept of religiously abusive environment in place of cult. And instead of cultic, I use spiritual abuse. I use religious or spiritual abuse synonymously. By religious or spiritual abuse, I mean:\n\nactions or beliefs that damage pervert or hinder one’s understanding of and relationship with God. It is fundamental to our nature that we are created in God’s image and designed to get our meaning from Him.\n\nThe spiritual abuser encourages one to replace God by something or someone as the source of ultimate personal fulfillment. This misrepresents what it means to be made in the image of God. It strikes at the very core of who we are. (Knapp, P., n.d., para.\n\n1\n\n)\n\nSuch a definition immediately introduces important philosophical and theological categories. Many have suggested that, knowingly or unknowingly, consistently or inconsistently, all of us have a preconceived set of philosophical beliefs about the world in which we live (e.g., Groothuis, 2011; Sire, 1976/2009).\n\nA second and related challenge is that these fundamental beliefs provide us with a philosophical (and theological) reference point by which we struggle to understand ourselves, others, and more generally, the world in which we live. This reference point is commonly referred to as a worldview (Groothuis, 2011; Sire, 1976/2009). In affirming this universal experience as he wrote about the important contributions of the spirituality of Viktor Frankl, author and editor Melvin Kimble (2000) stated:\n\n[It is] axiomatic that all people have a psychotheological worldview by which they define their life purpose and nature. This psychotheological worldview is largely a product of life experience which can be identified and most readily accessed through the individual’s core beliefs and their resultant thoughts and feelings. (p.\n\n136\n\n)\n\nLike Kimble (2000) and Frankl (1984), many individuals believe their psychological and theological beliefs shape their life goals and their sense of self-worth. The idea of a worldview, of philosophical core beliefs providing us with such a reference point, has been assumed by many philosophers (Sire, 1976/2009). Included in the term worldview are significant philosophic questions, one of which involve our concept of God, or as commonly referred to in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), one’s Higher Power (AA, 2001). The concept of a worldview introduces the term metaphysics, that part of philosophy concerned with the basic causes and nature of things. Additionally, a worldview includes one’s view of prime reality, or one’s ontology, a branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature and relations of being (Audi, 2001, pp. 563–66).\n\nThe philosophical starting point of this paper is the prime reality of God as defined in the most well-known historic Christian creeds and statements of faith: the Apostles Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed, or as most comprehensively identified in the Westminster Assembly of Divines’ Confession of Faith (1647/1976). In the Christian tradition, the concept of the image of God can provide a defining anthropology for understanding human needs and desires. This concept is particularly important because human needs and desires are abundantly present in the course of recovery from any significant abuse, and certainly those labeled as religious in origin. Macaulay and Barrs (1978) have suggested a helpful definition of the concept:\n\nThe expression the image of God means simply made like God. Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness (Gen\n\n1\n\n:\n\n26\n\n). To say this does not mean that man was completely like God. There were differences of course: man was a limited, physical creature, male and female, who was totally dependent on the Creator not only for the origin of his existence, but also for its continuation. Nevertheless, though unlike God in important ways, man was like God because man was a person. (pp.\n\n13–14\n\n)\n\nSecular concepts of religious abuse typically do not incorporate one having a well-defined view of God and the nature of humankind as ultimately necessary for comprehensive recovery. Those from a faith-based perspective, however, believe otherwise (Johnson, D. & VanVonderen, 1991).\n\nThe third challenge to our understanding of religious abuse within this study is the significant differences in how one perceives the role of mind control, sometimes referred to as thought reform, coercive persuasion, or undue influence. This paper provides a summary of the eight interdependent and interactive behavioral themes that define the characteristics of Robert Lifton’s concept of mind control or thought reform (Lifton, 1961/1989). Within the context of these various perspectives, the following may serve as a basic behavioral definition: Mind control denotes a set of techniques used manipulatively to unethically influence how a person thinks, feels and acts, with the purpose of creating a detrimental dependency upon another (Knapp, P., 2000, p. 4).\n\nSome professionals in the field attribute nearly absolute influential power to those who exercise the techniques associated with the thought-reform theory (Hassan, 1988/2015), and others deny it altogether, suggesting that people naturally elect religious choices based on their own free volition (Barker, 1984). Still others suggest a view of mind control that rejects both extremes and instead hold a more theologically and philosophically nuanced position (Knapp, P., 2000).\n\nA fourth challenge is that the complexity and variability of religiously abusive experience, personal family history, and individual personality make meaningful dialogue about the issue challenging. Although there are many behavioral similarities in differing religious systems, each individual’s internal and external experiences may differ widely, which often makes clear communication challenging. These variations require mindful attention to the various recovery issues common to religious abuse. These issues are often rather broad and typically include many categories. There are the practical issues, psychological and emotional difficulties, cognitive inefficiencies, social/personal relationship problems, and philosophical/attitudinal issues, to name a few (Singer & Lalich, 1995). Without a sufficient interpretive approach and empathetic appreciation, one’s understanding of and response to the issue of religious abuse can easily be inadequate or even inappropriately dismissive.\n\nWhen professionals are contending with strongly held religious or spiritual beliefs in an individual who has experienced religious abuse, they can easily identify a fifth challenge: that of contending with the individual’s extreme depth and range of emotions, which can make objectivity, while not impossible, certainly arduous at best (Langone, 1993, pp. 307–14). Many writers and researchers within this field self-report as either having themselves come from, or having had a loved one involved in, religiously abusive environments. This background commonly makes their commitment to the topic of recovery deep and personal. For instance, one of the largest and most professional organizations in the world that addresses religious abuse and recovery, the International Cultic Studies Association’s (ICSA’s) online autobiographical profiles clearly suggest that many, if not most, of its members self-identify as having significant personal history with religious abuse (see http://www.icsahome.com/elibrary/peopleprofiles). Because the systemic effects of one’s recovery from religious abuse are commonly ongoing and variable, issues of emotional transference, displacement of feeling from a prior to a current object (Yalom, 1985, p. 201) can easily affect one’s ability to think clearly and can diminish appreciation for other’s perspective of their religious abuse and recovery.\n\nFinally, a sixth challenge involves the lack of broad, integrative books, articles, or papers that reflect a theoretical understanding of the process of recovery from religiously abusive environments. One possible reason for this deficiency is that most writers and researchers in this field do not have a significant background in the realms of philosophy of religion, theology and psychosocial theory while simultaneously having a personal history of religious-abuse recovery; and the practical wisdom of many years filled with assisting others in their spiritual journeys. Again, this limitation also is clearly evidenced in the ICSA’s autobiographic profiles.\n\nFor individuals to have a broad and deep educational and experiential background in any field of endeavor may hold greater hope for advancements in that field in terms of both theory and praxis. Many researchers and writers have suggested ways through which people might best understand and recover from religiously abusive environments. In the chapters that follow, I seek to support others’ opportunities for growth in just such an integration on the topic of religious abuse and recovery.\n\nIn chapter 1, I provide a broad overview of the history of religious abuse and identify core characteristics of four fundamental theoretical perspectives on religious abuse and recovery: a mind-control, victimization approach; a deliberative or Conversionist conceptualization (I primarily use the term Conversionist throughout the remaining content); a psychosocial, needs-based understanding, and finally, a dynamic-systems approach. These four perspectives include adherents who self-identify as both religious and as primarily secular. I summarize relevant literature and clearly organize the varying opinions.\n\nA mind-control or thought-reform perspective of religious abuse asserts that it is primarily the behavioral dynamics of another’s undue influence that results in a person’s involvement in such religious abuse (Hassan, 1988/2015). These advocates typically make strong appeals to Lifton’s (1961/1989) or Singer and Lalich’s (1995) work on thought reform. Advocates of a Conversionist conceptualization deny any mind control and typically place culpability upon the free and varied choices of individuals, attributing responsibility primarily to the autonomous decisions made by those who choose to participate in what some believe are religiously abusive environments (Barker, 1984; Rhodes, 2013). A psychosocial, needs-based understanding suggests that people join, remain in, and exit from religiously abusive environments primarily because of unmet psychological and relational needs and that, at varying levels, people are mutually culpable for their involvement (Ash, 1983). Finally, a dynamic-systems approach supports the foundational notion that no one influential sphere—psychological need, imposed influence, or deliberated individual choice—plays a necessarily determinative function; instead, a variable and interconnected dynamic system perspective is essential to understand religious abuse and recovery (Langone, 1996; Knapp, P., 2000; Lalich, 2004; Johnson, D., & VanVonderen, 1991).\n\nIn chapter 2, I provide the theological and philosophical evaluative analytics that undergird this paper. I suggest an apologetic, a method of reasoned defense, for framing this discussion around the need for a Christian worldview, highlighting the unavoidability of theological presuppositions, while acknowledging the important role of social-science evidence, placing each in perspective. I clearly identify and explain theoretical source criteria. Unless otherwise indicated, when I refer to specific biblical scriptures, I use the English Standard Version (ESV). Further, I stress the role of philosophical context or presuppositions while suggesting the need for logical coherence, comprehensive evidence, existential viability, and conceptual wholeness in theorizing about religious abuse and recovery.\n\nSignificant theoretical linkage among the four broad perspectives identified in chapter 1 (the psychosocial, needs-based understanding; a mind-control, victimization approach, a deliberative or Conversionist conceptualization, and a dynamic-systems approach) provides common ground from which to derive cooperative dialogue. Unfortunately, because of clear philosophic barriers and general differences of opinion, typically around the understanding of mind control, there is commonly a strong cacophony between the various perspectives (Passantino, B., & Passantino, G., 1994; Martin, P., 1998; Barker, 1984; Singer and Lalich, 1995). For advocates of the Conversionist viewpoint, individuals’ beliefs matter and ideas have consequences; mind-control adherents believe that persons may be significantly influenced by the manipulative behavior of others; for supporters of the psychosocial needs-based perspective, all humans have common social and psychic needs that inevitably result in religious or spiritual involvement; and for the dynamic-systems approach, combined elements of influence and unique individual life factors and needs must be considered. Those with each perspective attest to significant anthropological axioms (propositions regarded as self-evident), that inform their understanding of religious abuse and recovery.\n\nIn chapter 3, I apply the identified apologetic criteria presented in chapter 2, examining the strengths and limitations of each of the four general perspectives of understanding and recovery from religious abuse discussed in chapter 1. I suggest that no general perspective of religious abuse and recovery provides sufficient theoretical accounting of religious abuse and recovery, but that each is helpful, given the limitations of its philosophical assumptions. I then propose that a larger contextual approach which integrates theological and philosophical constructs is needed to more adequately understand involvement in and recovery from religiously abusive environments.\n\nIn chapter 4, I explain the theological cogency of understanding principles of recovery from religious abuse and advance a new perspective, SECURE. This acronym stands for the importance of the concept and practice of (a) a Safe Haven, which derives from attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1972, 1980, 1982; Kirkpatrick, 2005); acknowledgment of (b) the essential role and function of Emotion, as identified in emotion-focused therapy (EFT; Johnson, S. M., 2008); (c) the importance of remaining Cognitively focused, drawing from cognitive behavioral theory (Beck, 2011); (d) Unconditional positive regard, coming from the influence of humanistic psychology (Rogers, 1956/1980); and (e) the essential benefits in a Relational support system, clearly found in the twelve-step plans of recovery (Dinneen, 2013); and finally, (f) affirming the need for Education regarding the influences of the family-of-origin, or applied family systems theory, to a religious environment (Friedman, 1985) as a unifying and interpretive context. An overview of the SECURE perspective is available in Appendix B.\n\nIn chapter 5, I discuss additional research and investigations to benefit cultic studies, and to strengthen the SECURE approach. In this final chapter, I suggest seven areas of ongoing research and how they may occur. Appendix C includes additional recovery resources for practical use and to assist in the ongoing process of theory development in the field.\n\nI suggest in this paper that past and current perspectives on religious abuse and recovery need to be conceptually enlarged and redefined. This need for enlarging and redefining one’s concept of reality is commonly suggested in forms of existential analysis, or logotherapeutic approaches to therapy (Frankl, 1997/2011). Such an approach, which involves a systemic perspective and ideally includes philosophical, psychological, social, and theological considerations, may better account for the recovery needs of those affected by religious abuse. Finally, within this thesis, I acknowledge the value of varying viewpoints about how people recover from religious abuse and suggest the need for those with an interest in cultic studies to sharpen their conceptual understanding of recovery with the intent of encouraging increased collaboration and better practice. My intent is to explore and integrate features from various conceptual frameworks, to identify the main sources of recovery from religious abuse, and to present a cohesive and comprehensive perspective based on the principles typically identified in family systems (Walsh, 2003) and attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969, 1972, 1980, 1982), with an implicit view of truth that originates from a Christian worldview (Groothuis, 2000).\n\n1\n\nHistorical Overview\n\nReligious abuse has a broad, significant, and painful worldwide history (Cowan & Bromley, 2008; Engh, 2007; Singer & Lalich, 1995; Stark & Corcoran, 2014). Some professionals in the field have chosen to write about religious abuse specifically within the context of the Christian church (Frend, 1981; Foxe & Wright, 1811); others have focused deeply within the history of particular groups (Giambalvo & Rosedale, 1996; Lindsey, 2014; Tanner & Tanner, 1989). In the first section of this chapter, I highlight the historical relevance of abuse under religiously motivated behaviors and belief. This discussion is not intended to be comprehensive; instead it will address only some of the more significant representative occurrences of religious abuse while placing them in a historical and relevant cultural context.\n\nThe second and larger section of this chapter includes a general review of relevant literature in the field of religious abuse and recovery as expressed from four basic theoretical perspectives on religious abuse and recovery: a mind-control, victimization approach; a psychosocial, needs-based understanding; a deliberative or Conversionist conceptualization; and finally, a dynamic-systems approach. These perspectives include adherents who self-identify as faith based and others who appeal to a secular orientation. I distinguish varying opinions, and identify both organized and assorted contributions to this field of study."
