        "meta_description": "French postcard. Studio Harcourt, No. 10. S.E.R.P., Paris.  NB Flamant's name is spelled as Flament.\n\t\n\t<b>Georges Flamant</b> (1903-1990) was a French film actor who peaked in the 1930s and early 1940s as bad guy and as co-actor with his wife, the film star Viviane Romance.\n\t\n\tGeorges Flamant was born September 3, 1903 in Tunis, while Tunisia was a French protectorate for over twenty years. As Pascal Donald writes on the site Ciné-Ressources, he inherited the banter and the resourcefulness of the French in North Africa and stopped his studies at an early stage. He practiced several odd jobs and attended the world of petty crime. Arriving in Paris in the roaring twenties, he met the underworld of Montmartre and the Grands Boulevards where his seductive power was a hit with women. When in 1931 Jean Renoir was preparing his first talkie, La chienne, he was looking for a convincing actor for Dédé, Lulu’s pimp. When the filmmaker met Georges Flamant, he knew he met his character of a small-sized, petty criminal with an ignoble smile. Dédé ends unjustly convicted and executed after abusing the love of Lulu (Janie Marèze) and the naivety of Mr. Legrand, played by Michel Simon, the real killer. Subsequently, Georges Flamant was often type-casted in films as bad guy. Still this enabled him to act together with popular actresses such as Käthe von Nagy (A’ moi le jour, à toi la nuit, Ludwig Berger &amp; Claude Heymann, 1932), Vera Korène (La voix sans visage, Leo Mittler, 1933), Suzanne Dehelly (La reine des resquilleuses, Marco de Gastyne, 1934), and Gaby Morlay (La peur, Victor Tourjansky, 1936). \n\t\n\tIn 1937 he appeared with Raimu and Viviane Romance in L’étrange Monsieur Victor by Jean Grémillon, and met the actress again in Prison de femmes by Roger Richebé and with Renée de St Cyr, and Le puritain by Jeff Musso and with Jean-Louis Barrault. Although he already met Viviane in 1931 in Renoir’s La chienne, where she was an extra, Georges henceforth shared his life with the famous vamp of French cinema. During the following five years, Viviane Romance imposed her man in the headlines of seven productions with her:  Gibraltar (Fédor Ozep, 1938) also with Erich von Stroheim, La tradition de minuit (Roger Richebé, 1939) also with Marcel Dalio, Angelica (Jean Choux, 1939 which was shot at the Roman Scalera studio and released in both a French and an Italian version, Vénus aveugle (Abel Gance, 1940) also with Henri Guisol, Cartacalha (Léon Mathot 1940) also with Roger Duchesne, Une femme dans la nuit (Edmond T. Gréville, 1941) with Claude Dauphin, and Feu sacré (Maurice Cloche,1942) also with Franck Villard.  These films attracted audiences because of the sulfurous presence of Viviane, but Georges Flamant proved to be a rather poor actor, blatantly lacking charisma. After their separation in 1942, Georges's career suddenly stopped. Losing his credibility and without the protection of Viviane, no one hired him anymore. He lived on his notoriety in the company of pretty women and drowned himself in alcohol.\n\t\n\tIn 1948 Georges Flamant returned in a small role in an Italian film, Undici uomini e un pallone by Giorgio Simonelli, and still appeared in three French productions during the 1950s. In 1959, for his last film role, he played the rich and indulgent father of Patrick Auffray alias René, friend of Antoine Doinel played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, in Les 400 coups (The 400 Blows), the first feature by François Truffaut. As Pascal Donald writes, this was an unusual trajectory for a &quot;part-time criminal&quot; who wanted to be an actor, starting under the direction of Renoir and ending under that of Truffaut, and whose career was punctuated by a passionate and tumultuous relationship with one of the most beautiful movie stars. After nearly two decades of neglect, Georges Flamant made a final appearance on television in 1977 with Jean Richard, in the episode Maigret et Mr. Charles, directed by Jean-Paul Sassy, after which he returned to anonymity for good. Hospitalized in Villiers-le-Bel, he died July 20, 1990 at the age of eighty-six.\n\t\n\tSources: IMDB, French Wikipedia, <a href=\"http://www.cineartistes.com/fiche-Georges+Flamant.html\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cineartistes.com/fiche-Georges+Flamant.html</a>",
