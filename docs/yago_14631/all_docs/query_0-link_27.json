        "text": "This polemical article objects to the pervasive use of realism as a value or prescriptive term in the writing of Italian cinema history. It also offers a dissenting appraisal of the ‘institution’ of neorealism: the body of critical work and discourse that constructs neorealism as the ethical and aesthetic centre of Italian cinema. The discursive recourse to neorealism has become the essential authoritative gesture: to fail to refer to it is to risk seeming ignorant, philistine and most of all politically suspect. We contest this insidious common sense of Italian cinema studies, a common sense that is underpinned by a notion of auteurist ‘paternity’ as the default explanatory metaphor of Italian ﬁlm history, and which leads to a dismissive tone in the discussion of genre ﬁlms, not to mention a disdain for the audience for such ﬁlms. We critique the idea of cinema as a ‘mirror’ of the nation found in some of the pre-eminent scholars of Italian cinema, and we ﬁnish by recommending a moratorium on the mention of neorealism for at least ﬁve years. What would a silence on realism allow us to reveal about other modes and genres? The article is followed by replies from Giulia Fanara (Rome), Millicent Marcus (Yale) and Robert Gordon (Cambridge), and then the authors’ own short response to the replies."
