        "text": "Hoooray!\n\nVioletta di Nola is a featured article! Feel free to expand or correct the content if necessary, but please refrain from removing important info from the previous version of this article. Thanks! :)\n\nVioletta Rossi di Nola is the main antagonist of the live-action segments in Mia and Me. She appears in both Season 1 and 2. She is the snobbish daughter of a rich Italian countess. She is Mia's longtime former bully and nemesis.\n\nIn season 2, Violetta travels to Centopia. To prevent Mia from recognizing her, Violetta goes under the name Varia, but Mia eventually realizes who she is. She redeems herself at the end of the season and becomes the official fourth member of Mia's friend group in Centopia.\n\nCharacter[]\n\nVioletta harasses Mia and Vincent from the first moments she knows them. She bullies others, and regards them as less important than she is. She manipulates her friends, like Paula, to do things to prove their devotion to her.\n\nShe is harsh to others, but as seen in Season 2, she is unhappy living with her mother and wishes to move in with her father because he treats her nicely while the Contessa just pushes her to do things she doesn't want to do. She may be projecting her emotions onto her peers.\n\nIn Centopia, Violetta takes on a new persona, Varia, as to throw off Mia from thinking she could be Violetta. She started out as a sneaky spy, betraying her friends, but she works to change near the end of her visits to Centopia. On her last day in Centopia, Violetta gets a friendship ring from Mo and Yuko, and Mo names her the newest member of their team. Mia lets Violetta keep the ring in the real world, making Violetta a permanent member of the group despite leaving Centopia.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nAs a human[]\n\nVioletta has long, straight, dark brown hair and brown eyes. She pulls back the hair framing her face with pins.

She has wings with a purple tint, and purple circles and details.\n\nConcept art[]\n\nIn concept art from before the actors were cast, Violetta was planned to be a blonde-haired girl who had a pink headband, hoop earrings, and a pink purse. Her outfit was an early version of her regular school uniform.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMia[]\n\nMia and Violetta have a bad relationship for all of Season 1 and most of Season 2. Violetta despises Mia, and she constantly harasses Mia. She tries to humiliate Mia in lots of ways too. For example, some ways she would humiliate Mia was by using Paula as a double agent, by having Mia audition for a role in the school play where she must kiss Vincent, and spreading an old secret of Mia having had a lisp which she read in Paula's diary. In Centopia, Violetta uses an alter persona, Varia, but she tries to get rid of Mia throughout most of the episodes, Later on, Mia comes back to ask Violetta to return with her to the real world, so that Violetta goes to live with her father. and after being exposed as a double agent for Rixel, she works to prove herself as a good person by saving Mia, Yuko, Mo and Onchao from Rixel's plan.\n\nVincent[]\n\nVioletta has bullied Vincent since the first episode, and does all throughout Season 1. After Vincent becomes friends with Mia, Violetta tries to use him constantly to try and get him to tell her about Mia and her book.\n\nPaula[]\n\nPaula used to be a friend and ally of Violetta, but Violetta controlled her actions and made her harass Mia. Paula eventually became friends with Mia and Vincent instead, so her and Violetta became enemies from there on.\n\nContessa di Nola[]\n\nContessa di Nola is Violetta's mom. Violetta isn't close, because she treats Violetta poorly and forces her to do things she does not want to do.

She wishes to live with him, as their relationship is a strong one.\n\nMo[]\n\nIn Centopia, Violetta works to become friends with Mo, and she even tells the group she is a princess after Mo tells her he is a prince so she would feel that attention from him is on her.\n\nYuko[]\n\nVioletta also works to become friends with Yuko, as she has fun on adventures with Yuko and Mo.\n\nMario[]\n\nMario is a farmhand at Renzo Genovese's farm, and Violetta appears to have a small crush on him. She tries to get him to leave Renzo's farm and work for her family full time instead.\n\nRixel[]\n\nRixel and Violetta work together in Centopia with a deal they made: if Violetta helps Rixel capture a winged unicorn, then he will help Violetta get rid of Mia so she can be friends with Yuko and Mo without having to have Mia with them as well.\n\nGargona[]\n\nGargona works with Violetta as well as a partner with Rixel's plan.\n\nTukito[]\n\nTukito is who sends Violetta's information to Rixel, but she is freaked out by Tukito and hates him.\n\nSeries[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nAfter the arrival of Mia in the new boarding school.
