        "text": "The Academy Award for Best International Feature Film is one of the most prestigious awards in the entire Oscars ceremony. While international films are eligible for other categories and do sometimes win, the Best International Feature Film category is often the only spotlight for films produced in countries outside of the United States and outside of the English language. Which can be a shame considering many of the best films made in any given year come from all around the world. After we run down the entire list of winners, we’ve ranked our personal favorites. Bon voyage!\n\nAcademy Award for best international feature film\n\nCategory name changed\n\nThe Best International Feature Film Oscar was formerly known as the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. This recent change first went into effect at the 2020 ceremony. Parasite from South Korea became the first film to win the honor after the name change. The film also went on to win the overall Best Picture honor, a rarity at the long-running ceremony.\n\nFun fact, the country with the most Best Foreign Language Film wins is Italy, followed closely by France. The gap after these two high scoring countries with 14 and 12 wins respectively is quite large. The third-place finisher is Spain with four wins.\n\nHere is a list of every best foreign-language film Oscar winner to date.\n\nbest Best International Feature Film academy award\n\nBest International Feature Film Oscar Winners\n\n2022 - All Quiet on the Western Front, Edward Berger\n\n2021 - Drive My Car, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi\n\n2020 - Another Round, Thomas Vinterberg\n\n2019 - Parasite, Bong Joon-ho\n\n2018 - Roma, Alfonso Cuarón\n\n2017 - A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio\n\n2016 - The Salesman, Asghar Farhadi\n\n2015 - Son of Saul, László Nemes\n\n2014 - Ida, Paweł Pawlikowski\n\n2013 - The Great Beauty, Paolo Sorrentino\n\n2012 - Amour, Michael Haneke\n\n2011 - A Separation, Asghar Farhadi\n\n2010 - In a Better World, Susanne Bier\n\n2009 - The Secret in Their Eyes, Juan José Campanella\n\n2008 - Departures, Yōjirō Takita\n\n2007 - The Counterfeiters, Stefan Ruzowitzky\n\n2006 - The Lives of Others, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\n\n2005 - Tsotsi, Gavin Hood\n\n2004 - The Sea Inside, Alejandro Amenábar\n\n2003 - The Barbarian Invasions, Denys Arcand\n\n2002 - Nowhere in Africa, Caroline Link\n\n2001 - No Man's Land, Danis Tanović\n\n2000 - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee\n\n1999 - All About My Mother, Pedro Almodóvar\n\n1998 - Life Is Beautiful, Roberto Benigni\n\n1997 - Character, Mike van Diem\n\n1996 - Kolya, Jan Svěrák\n\n1995 - Antonia's Line, Marleen Gorris\n\n1994 - Burnt by the Sun, Nikita Mikhalkov\n\n1993 - Belle Époque, Fernando Trueba\n\n1992 - Indochine, Régis Wargnier\n\n1991 - Mediterraneo, Gabriele Salvatores\n\n1990 - Journey of Hope, Xavier Koller\n\n1989 - Cinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore\n\n1988 - Pelle the Conqueror, Bille August\n\n1987 - Babette's Feast, Gabriel Axel\n\n1986 - The Assault, Fons Rademakers\n\n1985 - The Official Story, Luis Puenzo\n\n1984 - Dangerous Moves, Richard Dembo\n\n1983 - Fanny and Alexander, Ingmar Bergman\n\n1982 - To Begin Again, José Luis Garci\n\n1981 - Mephisto, István Szabó\n\n1980 - Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears, Vladimir Menshov\n\n1979 - The Tin Drum, Volker Schlöndorff\n\n1978 - Get Out Your Handkerchiefs, Bertrand Blier\n\n1977 - Madame Rosa, Moshé Mizrahi\n\n1976 - Black and White in Color, Jean-Jacques Annaud\n\n1975 - Dersu Uzala, Akira Kurosawa\n\n1974 - Amarcord, Federico Fellini\n\n1973 - Day for Night, François Truffaut\n\n1972 - The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, Luis Buñuel\n\n1971 - The Garden of the Finzi Continis, Vittorio De Sica\n\n1970 - Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion, Elio Petri\n\n1969 - Z, Costa-Gavras\n\n1968 - War and Peace, Sergei Bondarchuk\n\n1967 - Closely Watched Trains, Jiří Menzel\n\n1966 - A Man and a Woman, Claude Lelouch\n\n1965 - The Shop on Main Street, Ján Kadár & Elmar Klos\n\n1964 - Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, Vittorio De Sica\n\n1963 - 8½, Federico Fellini\n\n1962 - Sundays and Cybele, Serge Bourguignon\n\n1961 - Through a Glass Darkly, Ingmar Bergman\n\n1960 - The Virgin Spring, Ingmar Bergman\n\n1959 - Black Orpheus, Marcel Camus\n\n1958 - Mon Oncle, Jacques Tati\n\n1957 - Nights of Cabiria, Federico Fellini\n\n1956 - La Strada, Federico Fellini\n\n1955 - Samurai, The Legend of Musashi, Hiroshi Inagaki\n\n1954 - Gate of Hell, Teinosuke Kinugasa\n\n1952 - Forbidden Games, René Clément\n\n1951 - Rashomon, Akira Kurosawa\n\n1950 - The Walls of Malapaga, René Clément\n\n1949 - Bicycle Thieves, Vittorio De Sica\n\n1948 - Monsieur Vincent, Maurice Cloche\n\n1947 - Shoe-Shine, Vittorio De Sica\n\nOscar best foreign film\n\n20. Bicycle Thieves (1948)\n\nAcademy Awards foreign films • Bicycle Thieves available in full on YouTube\n\nBicycle Thieves is a drama from director Vittorio De Sica that takes an unflinching look at post-war Italy. The film was made within just a couple of years of the actual ending World War II. The official ‘Best Foreign Language Film’ category wasn’t added to the Academy Awards ceremony until 1956 but the Academy chose to highlight Bicycle Thieves with an honorary award as the ‘The Most Outstanding Foreign Language Film Released in the United States.’\n\nOscars best international film\n\nConclusion\n\nBicycle Thieves is an important film in the Italian neorealist movement and a highlight of the genre.\n\nBest foreign movie Oscar\n\n19. The Secret in Their Eyes (2009)\n\nHow the film’s most impressive sequence was made\n\nThe Secret in Their Eyes is a mystery-thriller from director Juan José Campanella. The tight screenplay is full of suspense and surprises, and the film’s show-stopping centerpiece is a long take which begins as an aerial shot before sweeping down into a stadium and transitioning seamlessly into an impressively coordinated foot chase sequence.\n\nThe Secret in Their Eyes was made in Argentina and became the country’s second film to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.\n\nAcademy Award for best international feature film\n\nConclusion\n\nDon’t bother with the 2015 American remake, stick to the original.\n\nAcademy Awards best foreign film\n\n18. Tsotsi (2005)\n\nTsotsi wins at the 2006 Oscars\n\nTsotsi is set in a violent slum in Johannesburg and follows the titular character of Tsotsi, a young, cold criminal who kills without remorse but finds his worldview challenged over the course of the film’s six-day timeline. Presley Chweneyagae gives a standout performance in the titular role, even more impressive considering it was his first time acting.\n\nOscar international film\n\nConclusion\n\nTo date, Tsotsi is the only South African film to win the Best Foreign Language Film honor and one of only two South African films to receive a nomination in the prestigious category with Zulu (2004).\n\nOscar foreign film\n\n17. The Tin Drum (1979)\n\nTrailer for The Tin Drum\n\nThe Tin Drum can easily secure the title of the most bizarre Best Foreign Language Film winner. The film follows a strange boy named Oskar as the Nazis rise to power within his lifetime. It is a bizarre film, full of inexplicable happens such as Oskar refusing to leave his mother’s womb until he is promised the titular Tin Drum. And Oskar deliberately deciding to remain a child and stop growing at the age of three, which he does successfully, remaining a child outwardly for many years.\n\nOskar also possesses the ability to break glass with his high-pitched screams which he uses in protest of the violence of WWII.\n\nBest foreign movie Oscar\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Tin Drum also won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nOscar international film\n\n16.

The film is comprised of a series of vignettes that look back on 1930s Italy from the modern viewpoint of the early 1970s. Much of the film’s plot comes from director Federico Fellini reflecting on his own memories of childhood.\n\nAcademy Awards best foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nFurther cementing the autobiographical nature of the film, the title ‘Amarcord’ loosely translates to “I Remember” in English.\n\nBest international feature film\n\n15. Mon Oncle (1958)\n\nA video essay on the films of Jacques Tati\n\nMon Oncle is the second film from French director Jacques Tati to feature his long-running Monsieur Hulot character. Jacques Tati wrote, directed, produced, and stars in Mon Oncle, a delightful comedy skewering modern life and technology through visual gags and physical humor.\n\nTati’s roots were in circus, mime, and silent film performing. He carried this idea of silence into his feature films which contain very little dialogue despite the large cast of characters.\n\nOscar foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nMon Oncle, is a wonderful comedy. It might not be Tati’s finest work as the Monsieur Hulot character, but it was his only film honored at the Academy Awards. Check out Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday, Playtime, and Trafic for more Monsieur Hulot.\n\nAcademy Awards foreign films\n\n14. The Virgin Spring (1960)\n\nAng Lee discusses The Virgin Spring\n\nThe Virgin Spring is a Swedish language film from legendary filmmaker Ingmar Bergman.

Thalberg Memorial Award by the Academy in honor of \"creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production.\"\n\nBest international film\n\n13.

Fanny and Alexander (1982)\n\nThe episodic version of Fanny and Alexander is available on YouTube\n\nFanny and Alexander is the second Ingmar Bergman film on our list of the greatest foreign language film Oscar winners but not the last. The film is an autobiographical drama looking back at Bergman’s own childhood. Fanny and Alexander exists as two distinct versions, one a televised miniseries that totals 312 minutes, and the other a trimmed down 188 minutes in length.\n\nThe shortened cut of Fanny and Alexander is the version that was honored by the Academy Awards.\n\nOscar best foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth versions of Fanny and Alexander stand strong as their own pieces of work, but the lengthier 312 minute cut is the definitive version if you have time for the expanded runtime.\n\nOscar foreign film\n\n9. Life is Beautiful (1997)\n\nRoberto Benigni puts on quite a show at the Academy Awards\n\nLife is Beautiful is an Italian comedy-drama about a Jewish father hiding the horrors of the holocaust from his young son even as they suffer through it.

Rashomon (1950)\n\nRobert Altman discusses Rashomon\n\nJapanese director Akira Kurosawa’s Rashomon won an honorary award the 1952 Academy Awards for ‘Outstanding Foreign Language Film.’ It would be a few more years before the Oscars added an official ‘Best Foreign Language Film’ category. Rashomon was considered groundbreaking upon release for its complex framing and structure, and for its subjective narrative as a group of characters each recount a different version of the same events.\n\nAcademy Award for best international feature film\n\nConclusion\n\nThough Kurosawa would be nominated for both Best Director and his films for Best Foreign Language Film, Rashomon would remain one of just two films of his to be awarded at the Academy Awards.\n\nOscar international film\n\n7. The Salesman (2016)\n\nThe Salesman wins Best Foreign Language Film\n\nThe Salesman is a drama from Iranian director Asghar Farhadi. It became the director’s second film to win the prestigious award. The film focuses on a married couple dealing with trauma following an assault as they attempt to put on a theatrical performance of Arthur Miller’s The Death of a Salesman. The performances are incredible and the drama drills deep into the characters.\n\nOscars best foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nAsghar Farhadi was chose not to be present to accept his Oscar for The Salesman in protest of Donald Trump’s executive order which barred entry to the country from a number of Middle Eastern nations. Farhadi and the other four directors whose films were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film joined forces in a joint-statement against the climate of fanaticism and nationalism in the United States.\n\nBest international feature film\n\n6. All About My Mother (1999)\n\nA quick profile done by the New York Times\n\nAll About My Mother is a drama from acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. The film also won the foreign language prize at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs.

Son of Saul (2015)\n\nRenegade Cut takes a look at Son of Saul\n\nSon of Saul is a Hungarian WWII film from director László Nemes. The film is extremely heavy and uncompromisingly bleak. The story follows the titular Saul as he navigates the concentration camp that holds him captive in an attempt to provide a proper burial to a child who he believes may have been his son but he cannot be certain.\n\nOscar best foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nSon of Saul uses a unique visual style that finds the camera closely tethered to the main character for the entire duration of the film. It follows closely behind him, allowing many of the horrors of the holocaust to drop out of frame or creep into the peripheries. It is a unique experience.\n\nBest international feature film\n\n4. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972)\n\nA New York Times critic’s pick\n\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie is a surrealist masterpiece from Spanish director Luis Buñuel. Buñuel is often credited as the father of cinematic surrealism and is a master of the strange and unexplainable. The film has very little in terms of a narrative through-line, focusing instead on a series of dream-like episodes following the same middle-class characters having their dinner party interrupted in escalating, bizarre ways.\n\nOscar foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nThe film was also nominated for the Best Original Screenplay award at the Oscars despite being incredibly light on actual plot.\n\nOscar best foreign film\n\n3. Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\n\nThoughts from film historian Peter Cowie\n\nThrough a Glass Darkly is the third and final Ingmar Bergman film on our list of the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar winners of all time. The master filmmaker’s 1961 drama follows a woman as she loses touch with reality after believing she has been visited by God shortly after exiting a mental hospital.\n\nOscar best foreign film\n\nConclusion\n\nTo date, the country of Sweden has won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar three times, all made by Ingmar Bergman.\n\nBest international feature film\n\n2. A Separation (2011)\n\nStory analysis by Barry Oshiba\n\nA Separation earned Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi his first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, followed by a subsequent win with The Salesman a few years later. A Separation features a complex plot told in the most humanistic way possible.
