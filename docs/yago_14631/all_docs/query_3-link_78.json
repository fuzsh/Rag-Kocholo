        "text": "The latest vintage movies hitting the video stores include two Disney releases, a harrowing German film and a fanciful British romance from the directors of “The Red Shoes.”\n\nNew from Walt Disney Home Video is the “The 30th Anniversary Limited Edition of Walt Disney’s Masterpiece: The Jungle Book” ($27). The enchanting animated version of Rudyard Kipling’s novel includes a 15-minute program featuring rare footage of the film and the soundtrack’s creation and clips of Louis Prima’s recording “I Wanna Be Like You.” The last animated film supervised by Disney himself, “The Jungle Book” stars the voices of Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway and George Sanders.\n\nWalt Disney has also dusted off the four-hankie weepy “Old Yeller” ($20), a sweet, sentimental tale about the “best doggone dog in the West.” “The 40th Anniversary Limited Edition of Old Yeller” has been fully restored and contains a featurette hosted by star Fess Parker.\n\nThe ultimate “boy and his dog” family drama also stars Dorothy McGuire, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran, also known as “Moochie,” and a yellow pooch named Spike who steals the movie. “Old Yeller” would make even Scrooge cry.\n\nHome Vision’s latest is the digitally remastered version of Fritz Lang’s landmark expressionistic 1931 German film “M” ($20). Home Vision’s edition features new electronic subtitles and includes the often-missing final scene. Peter Lorre, in the role that made him a star, is riveting as a sexual psychopath who murders young children. You’ll never be able to listen to Grieg’s “Peer Gynt Suite” the same way again after seeing this movie.\n\nEric Rohmer made a name for himself with his acclaimed “Moral Tales,” six films examining human nature, desire and relationships. Fox Lorber is releasing the rarely screened first two tales ($20). The 1962 short, “The Girl at the Monceau Bakery,” deals with a young man who loves a woman from afar. When she suddenly disappears after one date, he turns his attentions to a young woman working at a bakery. “Suzanne’s Career,” from 1963, chronicles the relationship between two male buddies who both become friendly with a young woman.\n\nAlso available on Fox Lorber are Rohmer’s best-known “Tales”: ($20 each); 1966’s “La Collectionneuse,” 1969’s “My Night at Maud’s,” 1970’s “Claire’s Knee” and 1972’s “Chloe in the Afternoon.”\n\nFor romance and fantasy lovers, there’s the splendid restored 1946 British import, “Stairway to Heaven” (Columbia TriStar, $20), also known as “A Matter of Life and Death.” Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (“The Red Shoes”), this dazzling Technicolor fantasy stars David Niven as an RAF squadron leader who survives a jump from his burning plane without a parachute.\n\nHe wasn’t supposed to live, however, and a messenger from heaven is sent to retrieve him. Refusing to go, Niven must plead his case to live in front of a heavenly tribunal. Kim Hunter plays an American radio operator with whom Niven falls madly in love. Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and Raymond Massey also star. Look for a young Richard Attenborough as a pilot.\n\nAlso new from Columbia TriStar is “The Strange One” ($20), an interesting 1957 drama set in a military school. Ben Gazzara plays a cadet officer who wields an enormous amount of power among his classmates. Pat Hingle, James Olson and George Peppard also star.\n\nFor French film fans, there’s the 1947 Oscar-winning “Monsieur Vincent” (Interama, $40). Pierre Fresnay and Lise Delamare star in this moving story of St. Vincent De Paul. Maurice Cloche directed.\n\nWilliam Wyler’s 1939 version of “Wuthering Heights” (HBO, $15) is one of the all-time classic films. Paramount’s dour 1992 version won’t make anybody forget Laurence Olivier’s and Merle Oberon’s performances as the ill-fated lovers, Heathcliff and Cathy. In fact, it never even opened in theaters in America. This “Wuthering Heights” made its debut in 1993 on TNT.\n\nBut it’s worth watching because “The English Patient” stars, Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, play Heathcliff and Cathy. Jeremy Northam (“Emma,’ “Mimic”) also stars. And yes, that is Sinead O’Connor as Emily Bronte."
