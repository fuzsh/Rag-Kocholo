        "text": "One of the highest grossing domestic films in the history of French cinema is La Grande vadrouille (Don’t Look Now We’re Being Shot At; 1966) directed by Gérard Oury. The film recalls the narrative of the famed, long-running comic book series Asterix and Obelix in which a bubbling pair of mismatched Gauls delight in tricking an incompetent conqueror. The film relies on slapstick and visual gags arising from the difference in height, class, and disposition between a comic pair: an orchestra conductor played by Louis de Funès and a house painter played by Bouvril. The film touched a chord in a France that welcomed a comic portrayal of victory over the Nazi Germans as a Gallic rather than American and Russian exploit. La Grande vadrouille also comforted a nation under true generational duress in the aftermath of the Algerian War as the republican culture of France would be challenged by Maoist currents during the student protests of the 1960s. The film also is of key importance in French cinema history. La Grande vadrouille is the best example of a film rewarded at the French domestic box office that contrasts to the narrative favored by the French cultural elite’s tendency to produce and critically praise films that are not box office draws. French films that were critically lauded and promoted since the 1930s are almost uniformly absent from the nation’s all-time box office rankings."
