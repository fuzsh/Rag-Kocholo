ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Vol. 209 No. 1 NEW YORK, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1957 PRICE 25 CENTS NEW VAUDE CIRCUIT: BALL PARKS Literary Agents Ask Pie-in-Sky And Story Editors Cry ‘Crazy’ High prices being asked by agents for potential bestsellers in the novel field may drive Holly¬ wood back to originals. Story edi¬ tors in New York report them¬ selves sore about the kind of deals they’re being offered on a pre-publication basis. They argue that these kind of prices aren’t realistic any longer. Example cited is Sloan Wilson’s “A Summer Place” for which the asking price is $500,000 plus a per¬ centage. Wilson’s ‘‘Man in the Gray Flannel Suit” was sold to and made by 20th-Fox. Some feel that, despite the im¬ portance of the pre-sold property in today’s market, a return to orig¬ inals might be a good thing for the screen. They were once the main¬ stay of Coast production, but in postwar years their importance has dimmed, partly because many writers found greener pastures in tv. Several studios at the moment kre engaged in a concerted effort to encourage young writers to turn out screen originals. For a while, some of the writing talent got onto the screen via tv scripts. However, Hollywood—after some painfHl ex¬ periences—has turned away from the video scripts. The one stage property current¬ ly of interest to the film companies is “Look Homeward Angel.” There is a complication since Paramount owns the book, so that anyone buy¬ ing the dramatic rights also would have to make a deal with Par.

Tracing trends in jazz addiction over the years, Hammond stated that the “maladjusted and frus¬ trated” . musicians of the 1920s were alcoholics -in the main; in the 1930s, marijuana was intro¬ duced and, finally, after World War n, heroin. “Just as some of the most famous; jazz soloists of the 1930s flaunted their use of marijuana, even to the extent of recording such items as ‘Muggles,’ ‘Reefer Man,’ arid dozen of dit¬ ties with reference to ‘tea,’ sev¬ eral of the most creative jazz art¬ ists of, the ’50s were known to (Continued on page 77) SATCHMO SWAMPS SPUTNIK IN SOUTH AM.

Possibility that “A Farewell To Arms” may offend Italian suscep¬ tibilities oyer first World War de¬ feat is still a worry to some Ital¬ ian circles. The latest public in¬ terrogation on the question was in the Italian House, where a con¬ gressman asked what steps had been taken to insure that Italian (Continued on page 24) practical test on Broadway this season. The currently outstanding case of marquee-pull seems likely to be Noel Coward, who has started off to capacity trade in his own play, “Nude With Violin,” at the Belasco Theatre. Despite generally scath¬ ing critical reaction to the play. Coward’s personal attraction is obviously potent enough to do sell¬ out business. Two things are worth noting: That the show is a. comedy and that it’s scheduled for a limited engagement (prob¬ ably 12 weeks). Despite mixed notices and the sombre nature of the drama, “The Rope Dancers” has had. good at¬ tendance at the Cort Theatre. Pre¬ sumably the attraction in that case is primarily Art’ Carney, who is. figured to have a large follow¬ ing from his appearances for sev- seasons in a featured role on the high-rating Jackie Gleason tv se¬ ries. A lesser b.o. factor is be¬ lieved to be Siobhan McKenna, at least partly from her numerous tele guest appearances. Although a long-established name via Hol¬ lywood pictures, Joan Blondeil is apparently not a major element in the “Rope” situation, perhaps partly because she plays only a supporting role. Lena Home is credited with a sizable share of trie obviously strong b.o. pull of the new musi¬ cal, “Jamaica,” at the Imperial, although she’s never before had a leading role in logit, and has had (Continued on page 18) TV No Boon to Boone’s B.O., No-TV a Big Plus For Presley: Exhib Org United Theatres Corp., film booking outfit in the southwest ter¬ ritory, figures that millions of dol¬ lars in film rentals alone is being lost by a star’s exposure on ,tvv Outfit cites the take of recent pix starring Elvis Presley and Pat Boone as a case in point. .

The story, set against the-background of the new. steel town, Nowa Muta, near Cra¬ cow, and . evolving the hardships of a. woman worker deserted by her husband and having four kids to provide for, shows the demorali¬ zation of her teenage oldest son overcharged with the care of the younger kids..

White Collar Union Hits Stone Wall Members Rally Although negotiations tinuing, a serious impasse has de¬ veloped in Contract talks between the film companies and the Home- office Employees Union, Local H-63, International Alliance of ^Theatrical Stage Employees. Fail¬ ure to. reach an agreement bn ..the four main issues of. money, hours, vacation and severance has caused Russell Moss, executive : v.p. and biz agent of the Union, to summon the -white coilarites to a special membership meeting tonight i Wed.). • ■ ' At this meeting it’s understood that Moss will present to the mem¬ bership a complete blow-by-blow description of what has taken place in the negotiations to date. He is expected to call attention to the “rigid” attitude of the film Com¬ panies and to ask the general mem¬ bership for instructions on what course to take in meeting the im¬ passe. A possibility exists that Moss may ask for a Strike vote. However, even if the membership should demand a strike, the union cannot call but its members unless permission is granted by Richard F. 'Walsh, president of the TA. In previous stalemates between the film companies and Local H-63, Walsh has intervened and brought about a settlement.. The IA topper has long prided himself in the fact that he has never. issUed a strike call against the film industry. Other actions short of a strike call that may be undertaken by. the Union are a slowdown or “absences because of sickness.” Union has bCen turned. down. on its request, for a wage hike, for a reduction in hours from 37*4 to 35, and for three-week vacations for employees with 10 years Of service. It’s said that the film companies have of- - fered an overall 5 % increase, which the union regards as inade¬ quate. Union’s demand’s, it’s saidT v wouid involve a hike of about 20 % for entire; package.

The rumors abound again, but now are anent person¬ nel. .; Regardless of the validity of the downbeat talk, the fact is that it is being heard (despite some fine financial statements from film and theatre companies of late) and it’s causing unrest. ; A substantial segment of film in¬ dustry employees is in the thrpes of Uneasiness. To;, put it bluntly, there’s a growing fear of one of the most drastic cutbacks: since the retrenchment and realignment that were effected circa 1949. Slowdown in production at Uni¬ versal, ad-pub firings at Para¬ mount and Warners and. new talk of shifting backroom and other ex¬ change work to National 'Screen Service by at least a couple of com¬ panies—these have had a demoral¬ izing effect. But cause , of concern is not so % much What, has already happened as it. is what may transpire within, the next several months: ,.. It’s believed that several com¬ panies, in addition to U are now. angling to reduce backlogs so as to be in a more flexible position— that is, to fashion each new pro¬ duction in tune,with market con¬ ditions on a more up-to-date basis. This does not obtain with the film colony in its entirety. For example, , Loew’s is making an (Continued on page 25) Showmen’s Dream Chicago,. Dec. 3.

While the film industry has been complaining of the limited attention given pic¬ tures in the news columns of the daily papers, it’s also noted by .ob¬ servers in the trade itself that many showcase theatres in . key cities are now outdistanced by ( 1 ) television and ( 2 ) art houses in terms of advertising insertions. Unlike radio in the Old days, tele¬ vision programs have been heavy spenders right along. But now the layouts are getting bigger and more frequent as competition for audience and ratings among the three networks waxes hotter.

Sales Chief ‘Mortality’ Resignation of Charles M. Rea- n R an as Metro’s sales topper and the ' appointment of John P.

He succeeds Roy Haines, who voluntarily returned to his Rost of western sales; chief with Coast headquarters.

D. of J. sources, * as well as lawyers at other companies,; said this week there’s no precedent in which a de¬ fendant could avoid compliance with a court order such as the trust decree because trade conditions have altered in the interim. And the Department is whispered bent on seeing to it that such a prece¬ dent is not established. Position taken by Loew’s attor¬ neys is that industry ^conditions have so radically changed: as to render unnecessary the ordered theatre split. Indeed, it’s felt,, the divestiture could be harmful tQ the entire industry since Loew’s pro¬ duction program might be im¬ paired if the profit-making domes¬ tic exhibition situations can no longer be relied upon for fiscal bolstering. Further, it’s noted that the Paramount picture com¬ pany is free to return to exhibition and previously-divorced circuits are now going into production.. Logic? Maybe! But the D. of J. will not hold still for the . Loew’s argument. Point is made that di¬ vorcement was among the penal¬ ties imposed because of .monopo¬ listic practices found by the U. S. District Court -in New York and upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court. -With Justice antagonistic to¬ ward any move to continue Loew’s integrated corporate setup, the company has as its only other ave¬ nue of approach a petition filed di¬ rectly with the District Court. If .this is done, it’s hinted, the com¬ pany might seek to enlist the sup¬ port of many of the same inde-. pendent exhibitors who demanded divorcement years ago but now would prefer not to have it. These are the theatremen. who believe the separation of produc¬ tion-distribution from exhibition is responsible for the lessened amount of product available to them.

MPEA explanation is that it wanted to keep Spiegel’s exit under wraps pending finalization of the French agreement.

DeMille’s “The Tim Commandments,” whlchhad a Roy¬ al premiere at the Plaza Theatre last Thursday ( 8 ), received lavish and full scale press coverage; Reactions were mixed, with most of the critics eniphazing the length of the film. Donald Zed of the Daily Mirror called it “colossal, fantastic, ornate, flashy, sexy—but also awesome” and also opined that it will, .take in more, money at the boxoffices than any other picture ever made.” Anthony Carthew (Daily Herald) found it dull, with only half a dozen -moments of tremendous excitement. He called it a huge spectacle v ‘but its heart is empty.. Dance-girls and dogma don’t mix.” Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail admitted that the film left him mote: exhausted than uplifted. “The dialog” he wrote “falls some¬ where between ‘Conf ucious-he-say’ and early Drury Lane.” He praised Charlton Heston’s Moses in the later stages. “It comes thrillingly to life” admits Wilson. Wilson praised Sir Cedric Hard- wicke’s.good fharoah, Yul Brynner’s bad Phiaroah and Yvonne, de ' Carlo’s Sephora. Wrote Harold Conway, of the Daily Sketch: “De Mille takes three mind a half hours to approach the climax of his picture but by then I was too exhausted to care . . . Everything, the merits and the faults is BIG.” Campbell Dixon of the Daily Telegraph thought that “For the most part DeMille has succeeded astonishingly well. Only the pro-.. Sessional cynic could fail to. be impressed by his moral fervor and technical skill.” Paul Dehn (News-Chronicle) wrote, “great cine¬ matic jewels are strung together on. immense intermediate lengths of pseudo-literary old. rope.” Dehn went, on to razz .the sticky Vic¬ torian dialog. He said the Bible told it better. Leonard Mosley of the Daily Express: “DeMille has made a bore, a mockery of it and piled in all the incidents while leaving out all the wisdom and the beauty. What a Vista Vision bath-tub he made of the Red Sea!” Times writer dismissed film as “a brightly colored postcard mag¬ nified into a mural.” m Oddly-Assorted Location Party Shooting Pre-Tourist Florida Saga By HY HOLLINGER Everglades, Fla., Dec. 3, One of the most motley casts ever assembled for a motion pic¬ ture has been brought to this south Florida city of 700, 78 miles from Miami, by Budd and Stuart Schulberg for their first joint in¬ dependent effort for Warner Bros, release. The performers include a former strip, teaser (Gypsy Rose Lee), a best-selling novelist (Mac- Kinley Kantor), a former heavy¬ weight contender (Two-Ton Tony Galento), a circus clown (Emmett Kelly), a former jockey (Sammy Renick); a balladeer (Burl Ives), an Israeli actress (Chatta Eden), and a Canadian actor (Christopher Plummer). To- this unusual con¬ glomeration, add such Broadway and tv stalwarts as Howard Smith, Curt Conway and George Voskd- vec. In a region Where visitors are served siich delicacies as rattle snake hor d’oevres, alligator soup and turtle steak, the Schulbergs, sons of the iate film pioneer, B. P. Schulberg, are filming entirely on location “Across the Everglades,” a picture based on an original screenplay by the literary ribling. This is the latter’^first film since his collaboration: with Elia Kazan on “Face in the Crowd.” Which was filmed in New York and on location. Budd. Schulberg continues to avoid Hollywood.. Starting with “On the Waterfront,” Which brought him back to pictures, he’s written three pictures, all made away from Hollywood. He’s a strong believer of utiliz¬ ing the authentic locations for each of the pictures with which he is associated. In addition, 'he looks upon the role of the screenwriter as similar to that of Die playwright. He insists on working closely with the director and bejy.g on hand to make script revisions as the need arises during production. That was his arrangement: with Kazan during the filming of ‘‘Wa¬ terfront” and “Face,” Budd main¬ tains; and ih order to continue to have full artistic freedom he join¬ ed ‘ with his brother Stuart, who had been producing pictures abroad, to organize Schulberg. Productions, which has scheduled a series of pictures-based on origi¬ nal stories by the writing member of the brother team. ’‘Across the Everglades.” accordr ing to Budd, is a different type, of frontier story. It's the story of'the Everglades and Miami in the early years of the present century. Plume hunters—most of them ren¬ egades and other- questionable fringe characters —• invaded the area to track down rare birds in search of feathers to satisfy the then current women’s fashion de¬ cree for millinery decorations.

An agreement to terminate the contract, plus a “substantial” cash payment, brought an out-of-court settlement of Ernest Borgnine’s year-old legal action against Hecht- Lancaster. Borgnine had filed two separate suits, contending that firm had. pre-emptied his services un¬ der the terms of the contract arid then loaned him out, reaping a hefty cash advantage. In one case, Borgnine contended, the. firm .ob¬ tained the sendees of a writer free from Metro in exchange fpr the actor’s doing, “A Catered Af¬ fair” at a lower price than he had originally asked. Second suit demanded an ac¬ counting Of profits on “Marty.” Borgnine contended he had been “defrauded” of his contractual two and one-half percent share of the gross, over a five year period, by improper deductions and fees' paid to a dummy . corporation which he claimed was actually owned by H-L.

Gene, The Hard Man (COLOR) Fast story of a fast gunman, with Guy Madison. A courtroom meller played en¬ gagingly and building evenly to a surprising and arousing, albeit tricked-up, climax, “Witness for the Prosecution” has been trans¬ ferred to the screen with com¬ petence. Arthur Hornblow’s pro¬ duction has dramatic and melo¬ dramatic substance* figures to do firm business all around. “Prosecution” is the Agatha Christie play which was a click on Broadway and, earlier. In London. The West End and Times Square runs clearly establish the prop-, erty’s popular appeal arid in this instance adept screen handling, plus the star names, adds to the values of the original. In fashioning the screenplay, Billy Wilder and Harry Kurnitz strayed but little from the proto¬ type, except tg introduce an added character, that of a private nurse. Why f e-write a hit play? In line with this, however, it’s recalled that Miss Christie’s multiple-bar¬ relled, rapidly-fired ending came off as almost bewildering (at least such criticism was beard) and the picture’s windup, which is substan¬ tially unchanged, likely may evoke the same comment.: But this is a minor reservation; it’s an entertaining show. Under Wilder’s direction, “Pros¬ ecution” unfolds realistically, gen¬ erating a quiet and steady excite¬ ment. The characters are believ¬ ably participating in the Old Bailey murder trial arid the few flashbacks and contemporary asides that round out the story. The plot always is in ! clear focus, the moods and moti¬ vations correctly established. Cleverly worked Out is the story line which has defense attorney; Charles Laughton; along with the audience, wholly, convinced that the likeable chap played, by Tyrone Power is innocent, that he couldn’t have murdered the rich widow who bad taken a fancy to him. A dis^ turbing note, however, is the unex¬ pected attitude taken' by Power’s Wife, Marlene Dietrich, who, as it turns out, is not legally riiarfied to him and thus is not restrained from testifying against him. Baffling, too, are the letters which Miss Dietrich has written to her “Beloved Max.” Which serve to discredit her testimony and bring about the acquittal verdict. And along with it there is the doubt that has entered Laughton’s mind, plus* indeed, the admission by Power that lie actually committed the crime. This is part of the multi¬ faceted, quickly-sprung climax that clears up everything. As per design, the. audience is. given a sense of participation, see¬ ing the case as Laughton sees it. Doting the trial’s developments and verdict appear too pat, sharing the •aine doubts and, at the denoue¬ ment, surprises. “Prosecution” reproduction of the famous London court is done with remarkable conviction arid the proceedings throughout have a genuine air. Laughton* sage of the courtroom and cardiac patient who’s con- constantly disobeying his nurses orders about cigar-smoking and brandy-drinking, plays out the part flamboyantly and colorfully. His reputation for scenery chewing Is •unmarred via this outing; he’s as robust as ever in making with the aarcastihg cracks (the Wilder-Harry Kurnitz is well stacked with sharp dialog) and browbeating his nurse and his subordinates. Power does a winning job as the ingratiating defendant who seems Incapable of jmirder and Miss Diet- rich is in good form, histrionically and physically* as the cause of much bafflement through the pic¬ ture until the explanations are finally given.

Williams Plenty of hard action and Guy Madison’s name for. marquee, lure shape “The Hard Man” for: good response in the gerieral outdoor market. Film is sparked by the type of story line to hold attention and use of Technicolor gives it plus. Director George Sherman has taken Leo Katcher’s fast-moving screenplay—based on his own novel—and come up . with a study of a gunman which turns out to be one of Madison’s best roles. Helen Ainsworth as producer provides suitable values, aided by Henry Freulich’s fluid color cameras, apd a note of authentic realism clothes the unfoldment. Madison plays a former Texas Ranger, who resigns after his chief’s objections for too often bringing back his quarry dead in¬ stead of alive.; He accepts an offer made by a sheriff to be his deputy, and instantly finds himself plunged into a fetid with a wealthy rancher, who means to dominate the whole country; He meets with cattle baron’s further enmity, through his association with latter’s wife, who tries to persuade Madison to kill the husband she hates. Madison lends authority to his character, engaging in action which includes both a bruising bar¬ room scrap with one of cattleman’s muscle men and a suspenseful six- gun battle with heavy’s gunman. Lome Greene capably portrays the rancher, shot down by . his Wife during a- showdown with. Madison, and Valerie French is okay in femme lead, doing well by her un¬ sympathetic part. Rudy Bond as the gunman,' Robert Burton the sheriff who hires Madison to do his .own necessary job with th# rancher and Barry Atwater, attor¬ ney romancing the wife of his em¬ ployer, turn in handy perform¬ ances.

Arthur’s Go Films banner, “Ship Was Loaded” was re¬ viewed from London; in the is¬ sue of May 22, 1957, under its original title, “Carry On, Ad¬ miral.” Variety’s critic Vlem found the farce “neatly made, extracting every ounce p£ hu¬ mor from ludicrous situations which have greater, scope yirii- ally thari in their former limited sphere.” (It Was A stageplay.) Peggy Cummins, and David Tomlinson are starred: in the. story about a naval officer and public relations man who are switched to each other’s jobs after a heavy drinking session and the mistaken identities that ensue. handsomely at the British foxoffice In the past.. Allied again with pro¬ ducer Hugh : Stewart and John Paddy Carstairs his latest '‘Just My Luck,” should be equally pop¬ ular even though it sometimes seems that the trip’s efforts will burst at the: seams. In the U.S., Wisdom is riiainly known through same casual, com¬ muting tv appearances but since humor is international,. American audiences should find enough yocks in this lively, farce. Wisdom is largely a situation comedian who has built up . a rep Via pratfalls, so it is unimportant that the story of “Luck” is as slim as a chorine’s waist. The idea of any story line for a Wisdom film is that it should get him into suffi¬ cient : incongruous situations to make, people feel sorry for him, for him to get out of them with blun¬ dering ingenuity and then finish up with the girl whose role is usually so innocuous that the audiencF forgets all about her until the fin¬ ish. In snort, Wisdom is a kind Pf Harold Lloyd, sans spectacles. This film follows this undemand¬ ing, but tricky formula effectively, and funnily. Wisdom is a humble employee at ritzy West End jewelery shoo. Anxious to win a bank roll sufficient to buy. a .lush bauble for his girl friend, the little comic decides to play the horses. With a hardly-earned$2.80 stake he becomes embroiled in backing a jockey in a six-race parlay and suf¬ fers endless adventures and humil- 1 iations before landing both the cash and girl. There . are several sequences' which are top screen comedy. For instance, there, is Wisdom and ah amorous blonde. : : smartly played by revue artist John Sims, making noisy, nuisances of. themselves in a cinema. In another sequence. Wis¬ dom finds himself a near victim of an emergency operation through misunderstanding. “Luck’ r is completely a Wisdom vehicle ‘ but some- neat perform¬ ances are \" turned in by . lesser artists. The two girls, * Jill Dixon and Delphi . Lawrence, emerge pleasantly. Margaret Rhodes, as his nagging mother; Edward Chapman, as his boss; Vic Wise as a jockey, and Leslie Phillips and Peter Cop¬ ley as two shady bookies also add their quota of fun. Margaret Ruth- erford is in her usual formidable form as . an eccentric racehorse\" owner; Johri Paddy Carstairs directs with his. usual pace arid Comedy knowhow. But it often seems that he is running out of new ideas to exploit the star he knows so well. Technical problems are satisfacr torily coped: with, and Jack -Cox handles the lensing well. Rich.

Wednesday, December 4, 1957 If there’s anything good to be said about it it’s that the Eastman color is vivid and impressive, pick¬ ing up some Interesting landscapes in Brazil, where this was produced by Curt Siodmak. Add that the title is “interesting” as an idea. Story has overtones of (uninten¬ tional) comedy. Archeologist Don Taylor penetrates jungle on an ex¬ pedition with eccentric Eduardo Ciannelll, who claims to once have escaped from the land of the Amazons. Taylor: is finally cap¬ tured by the jvarrior ladies, and escapes with a white woman whom they’ve held: captive. In the end, “to save this, old .civilization*” they agree not to tell anyone about their experiences. The “old civilization-’ consists of green-painted femmes creeping through the jungles, acting, alter¬ nately kittenish arid ferocious. Siodmak’s script is so clumsy, the temptation is great to consider the: whole thing a takeoff on jungle pix that have gone before. His direc¬ tion isn’t any much better, judging by the performances. Photography—by Mario Page- enhanced by good use of color, is Impressive. There’s one prolonged scene, men battling it out In the river mud, that is well staged and | lensed. Amazons’ dances are harm¬ less, though some may call them “suggestive;” I Taylor stumbles through the film without half trying. Gianna Segale is attractive as the lOst-and-fourid scientist, arid Ciannelll turns in a non-pro performance that belongs in the silent flicker era. . Tom Payne is okay as the scientist murdered by the: Amazons. Terry Morse’s editing is routine. Considering the time arid effort that must haye gone into this film, Siodmak should have to answer to someone why nothing better came out. Hift. . Affair in Havana Trite jealously plot.

Miguel Angel Blanco As an oft-told tale of a jealous husband—this time with cause— “Affair In Havana” relies on the beauties Of Cuba and the charm of Afro-Cubari music to take it out of the just-so class. As it is; pic is a better-than-average bet for second feature booking. Allied Artist releases the Cuban- made film that receives some ex¬ ploitation values out of John Cas¬ savetes and Raymond Burr, both of whom benefit from good tv ex¬ posure. * Cassavetes plays an American composer who has an affair with the lovely wife (Sara Shane) of a paralytic plantation owner (Burr). When Burr learns pf the recurrent trysts, he sets, out to trap the lovers when trio are together on the sugar plantation.. That fails and wife is about to run off with her pash when Burr tells, her he has only 90 days to live and; that she has $20,- 000,000 waiting, for her. She stays, Iri a subsequent argument be¬ tween the marriage partners Burr is pushed into a swimming pool and drowned by his manservant who is, unencouraged* enamored with the lovely lady. Manservant’s wife accuses Miss Shane of per¬ petrating the death; Cassavetes— who’s made of stem stuff—believes her and leaves^the now wealthy widow. Miss Shane chases and Tuns into manservant’s wife who stabs her to death. Adultery costs her her life but, as if nothing' had happened, Cassavetes ends up where he started—at a piano, pounding out some pretty lively tunes. ' Although he previously has aroused response as an actor, Cas¬ savetes doesn’t show much more than sporadic hints in this pie, not getting much help from the Burton Lane-Maurice Zimm script or di¬ rector Laslo Benedek. Burr js tyrannical enough. Miss Shane is pretty. Rest of small cast, especially Lilia Lazo as the servant’s wife, backs up nicely. On plus side are some interesting shots of Cuba done by Alan Stens¬ vold and some fine music by Ernest Gold and songs by Alberto Zayas Goyin. Technical credits are aver¬ age except sound which echoes all too frequently. * Ron. Plunder Rond (REGALSCOPE) Well-made little crime melo¬ drama.

With film attendance reported as '. down some 30-40% in television areas across Canada, a feeling of gloom pervaded the . anriual meet-? ings here, of the national commit¬ tee of. (a) the Motion Picture Ex- < hibltors Associatidns of Canada and (b) Motion Picture. Theatres As¬ sociation of Ontario. Some 85 the¬ atres have been closed in this coun¬ try during the past year, with a concentration of 26 victims in the; Marltimes. Other owners are op¬ erating at no profit or a loss, it'was stated by spokesmen. .The annual meeting also saw ; Morris Stein; chairman - (who is ; Eastern Division managing direc¬ tor of Famous Players Canadian), | outrightly condemning, his boss, : J. J. Fitzgibbons, president of Fa¬ mous, for the latter’s public speech¬ es. regarding the proposed, forth-, coining use of Telemeter, whose’ Canadian rights are held by Fa-.' mous. Stein wanted to know the Cost of. the pay-at-home venture for’motion pictures, who was going ■■ to buy the service; he confessed he. could not find out so, obviously, could, make no comment. Bfgtime Demise? Stein claimed, however, that. Fitzgibbons’ pessimistic reports to j. the press that bigtime show biz is • over were, not: fair to the film in¬ dustry, even if these were state- - ments made on behalf of Famous Players Canadian and riot for the. industry as whole. Soiriethirig must be done, Stein told the meet¬ ing, to offset such pessimistic re¬ ports; everi though these were a plug for Telemeter. On the -question of alarm, con¬ cern and gloomy forecast, this gov-! erned by the personal problems of j investment, plus looking out for employees, .Stein, reminded the -coast-to-coast delegates that “We can. find nobody who knows the answers”, but that the “Association can. get better results than any in¬ dividual representative of any Pro- ! vincfal exhibitor association in Cari- ada.” He said; “We exhibitors have an obligation to forrnulate constructive thought for action; arid, we are pretty skiinpy on ideas. We must be practical arid! realistic to dispel this spirit of gloom. The one as¬ pect that sells a picture is word-of- mouth advertising. Once! you can get an .attraction out in the' open: arid talked about, you are in. But if all exhibitors talk pessimism, this including newspapers and . na¬ tional magazines, such interviews will see a good picture playing to practically empty houses. How¬ ever, do .not lie about a picture’s potentialities; on entertainment in newspaper ads.” He admitted that smaller thea¬ tres are in difficulty arid may riot even survive, with the public more sophisticated and selective, but there, is a hefty investment to be protected.
