        "text": "Over the decades, special or honorary Oscars have gone to everything from a film series to animated shorts to innovators to a ventriloquist to child performers to foreign films. Tour our photo galleries for a look back featuring every performer honored (above) and every non-performer honored (below).\n\nTwo special awards were handed out at the first Academy Awards on May 16, 1929:\n\nCharlie Chaplin, who had originally been nominated for lead actor and for comedy direction for his 1928 masterpiece “The Circus,” was withdrawn from those nominations when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences’ Board of Governors gave him a special award for his “versatility in writing, acting, directing and producing” the comedy.\n\nWarner Brothers also picked up a special honorary for producing 1927’s “The Jazz Singer”-“the pioneer outstanding talking picture, which has revolutionized the industry”.\n\nNow called honorary Oscars, Donald Sutherland, cinematographer Owen Roizman (“The French Connection,” “The Exorcist”), director Charles Burnett (“Killer of Sheep”) and pioneering French filmmaker Agnes Varda, who is also nominated this year for her documentary “Faces/Places,” were the recipients of the honors at the Governors Awards last November.\n\nBaby Oscars\n\nFrom 1935 through 1961 special miniature Oscars were given to child actors with Shirley Temple winning the first at the seventh annual ceremony. Four years later, both Deanna Durbin and Mickey Rooney recieved minis for “their significant contributions in bringing the screen the spirit and the personification of youth, and as juvenile players setting a high standard of ability and achievement.”\n\nOther recipients of the award included Judy Garland, Margaret O’Brien, Peggy Ann Garner, Claude Jarman Jr., Ivan Jandl, Jon Whitley and Vincent Winter. The last one was awarded to Haley Mills for her performance in the 1960 Disney film, “Pollyanna.”\n\nSEE 2018 Oscar Best Picture predictions by experts: ‘Three Billboards’ pulls into tie with ‘The Shape of Water’ as voting ends Feb. 27\n\nHope for the Oscars\n\nBob Hope hosted the Oscars 19 times between 1939 and 1977. And the comic always joked about not winning one. In fact, he once quipped: “Welcome to the Academy Awards. Or as it’s known at my house, Passover.” But the fact of the matter is, he won four special Oscars, as well as the prestigious Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.\n\nHe received a special silver plaque at the 1941 ceremony “in recognition of his unselfish services to the motion picture industry.” Four years later, he received a special award in the form of life membership into the Academy for his “many services to the Academy.”\n\nHe received a statuette at the 1953 ceremony for “his contribution to the laughter of the world, his service to the motion picture industry, and his devotion to the American premise.”\n\nAnd at the 1966 ceremony, he received a gold medal for “unique and distinguished service to our industry and the Academy.”\n\nBehind the Lens\n\nSeveral directors have earned special awards over the years including D.W. Griffith of “Birth of a Nation” fame who received a statuette at the 1936 ceremony for “his distinguished creative achievements as director and producer and his invaluable initiative and lasting contributions to the progress of motion picture arts.”\n\nNoel Coward, who starred in, wrote and co-directed with David Lean, the 1942 World War II drama “In Which We Serve,” received a certificate at the 1943 ceremony for “his outstanding production achievement” for the movie. The next year, the film earned nominations for best film and original screenplay.\n\nLaurence Olivier was nominated for best actor and director for the 1946 best picture nominee “Henry V.” He lost those honors to Fredric March and William Wyler for “The Best Years of Our Lives,” but earned a statuette for his “outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director in bringing ‘Henry V’ to the screen.”\n\nThat same year, Ernst Lubitsch, who was nominated for best director for 1928’s “The Patriot,” 1929’s “The Love Parade” and 1943’s “Heaven Can Wait,” received a scroll for “his distinguished contributions to the art of the motion pictures.” Lubitsch died just a few months later at the age of 55.\n\nAnd in 1971, the influential actor/writer/director Orson Welles of 1941’s “Citizen Kane” fame received a statuette “for superlative artistry and versatility in creation of motion pictures.”\n\nThe Misc. and Unusual\n\nThe classic newsreels “The March of Time” received a statuette at the 1937 ceremony for “its significance to motion pictures and for having revolutionized one of the most important branches of the industry-the newsreel.”\n\nVentriloquist Edgar Bergen earned a wooden statuette at the 1938 ceremony for “his outstanding comedy creation Charlie McCarthy.”\n\nAt the same ceremony, legendary comedy producer and director Mack Sennett received a statuette for “his lasting contribution to the comedy technique of the screen, the basic principles of which are as important today as when they were first put into practice, the Academy presents a Special Award to that master of fun, discoverer of stars, sympathetic, kindly, understanding comedy genius, Mack Sennett.”\n\nWalt Disney earned not only a full-size statuette but seven baby ones, when he received a special honor at the 1939 ceremony for “’Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”\n\nHave you ever heard of Colonel Nathan Levinson? He earned a statuette at the 1941 ceremony for “his outstanding service to the industry and the Army during the past nine years, which has made possible the present efficient mobilization of the motion picture industry facilities for the production of Army training films.”\n\nMGM won a certificate at 1943 ceremony for its “achievement in presenting the American way of life in the production of the “Andy Hardy” series of films starring Rooney.\n\nThe MGM 1945 film short “The House I Live In,” written by Albert Maltz, who was later blacklisted, and starring Frank Sinatra, which examined anti-Semitism, was so highly regarded that it won a special Oscar.\n\nDisabled World War II vet Harold Russell, not only won best supporting actor for 1946’s “The Best Years of Our Lives,” he also received a special honorary for “bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance” in the film.\n\nSilent comedy genius Harold Lloyd not only won a statuette at the 1953 ceremony for being a “master comedian” but also because he was a “good citizen.”\n\nAnd even Joseph I. Breen, who managed the Motion Picture Production Code with an iron fist, was given an honorary Oscar at the 1954 ceremony for “his conscientious, open-minded and dignified management” of the code.\n\nActors and Actresses\n\nSeveral performers, who never received competitive Oscars, have been honored with special Oscars.\n\nCharles Boyer, who was nominated for four best actor Oscars, received a certificate at the 1943 ceremony for his “progressive cultural achievement in establishing the French Research Foundation in Los Angeles as a source of reference for the Hollywood motion picture industry.”\n\nOther recipients of honorary Oscars include Douglas Fairbanks, Lauren Bacall, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Cary Grant and Angela Lansbury.\n\nA Foreign Affair\n\nBefore Fellini was the recipient of the first competitive foreign language film Oscars at the 1957 ceremony for “La Strada,” foreign language films earned honorary Oscars.\n\nFrance’s “Monsieur Vincent,” directed by Maurice Cloche, was the first to be voted “by the Academy Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the U.S. during 1948.”\n\nOthers winning the special honor were 1949’s “The Bicycle Thief,” 1950’s “The Walls of Malapaga”; 1951’s “Rashomon”; 1952’s “Forbidden Games”; 1954’s “Gate of Hell” and 1955’s “Samurai, The Legend of Mushashi.”\n\nNot a Dry Eye in the House\n\nHonorary Oscars are frequently emotional events. At the 1961 ceremony, Jimmy Stewart picked up Gary Cooper’s honorary Oscar for “his many memorable screen performances and the international recognition he, as an individual, has gained for the motion picture industry.”\n\nStewart had presented Coop with his first best actor award for 1941’s “Sgt. York.” Stewart began crying during his acceptance speech and Hollywood and the world wondered if the beloved actor was dying. And in fact, he was. Less than a month after the Academy Awards, the actor died of cancer on May 13, 1961.\n\nChaplin, who received an honorary Oscar at the first Academy Awards, returned to Hollywood and the Oscars in 1972 after a 20-year exile to receive a statuette for “the incalculable effects he had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.”"
