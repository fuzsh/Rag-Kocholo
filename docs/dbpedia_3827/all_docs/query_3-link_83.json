        "text": "Otto Lipfert: a German migrant in early twentieth century Subiaco\n\nOtto Lipfert was born in Poesneck, Saxe Meiningen in 1864. He trained and worked there as a furrier, the profession of both his father and grandfather. He also developed a keen interest in nature and the animal species that were exciting Europeans in Australia.\n\nOn hearing there was no taxidermist in Western Australia he migrated in 1893, making the voyage in a British ship, SS Orient so he could learn English on the way. He departed London on February 10, 1893 and arrived at the port of Albany on Saturday 18 March 1893 – a fairly quick trip.\n\nIn February 1894 he became the first taxidermist to work for the Western Australian Museum. He made his first collecting trip—to the Abrolhos Islands in October that year. The team were stranded on the island for 9 days.\n\nDuring the earlier years of his service with the museum he went on many collecting expeditions, including to the Kojonup district, Southwest and Midland districts, Geraldton, Margaret River, Yanchep, Abrolhos Island, Bernier and Dorre Islands.\n\nThe longest trip of his career took 16 months, when his party set out guided by AW Canning in April 1930 to recondition the wells along the Canning stock route from Wiluna to Hall’s Creek.\n\nOtto H Lipfert on a collecting expedition at Bernier and Dorre islands, in Shark Bay, 1910.\n\nLipfert collected around Perth and Rottnest, the south-west and the Stirling Ranges, in the Shark Bay area, and along the Canning Stock Route.\n\nThe largest specimen he collected was a 25 metre blue whale beached near Busselton in the summer of 1897-98.\n\nThe whale was reported to the Western Australian Museum and over the next three years Otto oversaw its preparation for transport to the WA Museum.\n\nTwo Japanese fishermen and a local farmer helped Otto to remove the flesh from the bones. The skeleton was then left to bleach in the sun for more than a year.\n\nThe bones were individually labelled so they could be reassembled at the Museum. The 24-metre-long skeleton was transported to the Busselton Railway Station in a horse-drawn carriage, where it was taken by train up to Perth. The cranium (skull) weighs more than 800 kilograms today. At the time it would have weighed nearly twice that, due to the oils stored in the bones.\n\nTaxidermy\n\nA taxidermist ‘prepares and preserves the skins of animals, stuffing and mounting them in lifelike form’.\n\nLipfert did not limit himself to taxidermy. He ‘identified, catalogued, recorded, sketched and photographed, cleaned, preserved, mounted and displayed’ the specimens he collected.\n\nArsenic was widely used to repel insects from the late 1700s up until the 20th century and many of Otto’s specimens still at the WA Museum contain arsenic. Otto lived in the golden age of taxidermy, as in the the Victorian era it was a popular way for European scientists and the public to examine foreign species they’d never see otherwise, as well as in interior design."
