        "text": "\"Hello, my name is Johan Nieto, and I am a proud tattoo artist from the vibrant city of Bogotá, Colombia. I have been in this beautiful profession for 8 years, specializing in the fascinating world of realism and shadows My passion for the art of tattooing has led me to perfect my technique and to strive more and more to capture the most minute details in my creations.\n\nEach tattoo I make has a part of me printed on it, and I seek to transmit this through each line and shadow. Each piece is a unique and custom work of art, created with the highest attention to detail. My satisfaction lies in the happiness of my clients when they see the final result.\n\nEvery day, I strive to be a better version of myself and offer my clients the best of me.\n\nThank you for accompanying me on this journey and for appreciating my work. I hope to continue surprising you with my future creations!\"\n\nPlease follow me on IG @johan_nieto_arttattoo\n\nHi I'm Christian Puig,\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHello! My name is Christian. I specialize in black and grey tattoos and love doing dot work, mandalas, floral, ornamental and illustrative. I've created art since I was a child which eventually led me to CU Boulder, where I graduated with an art degree and a minor in French. I have since worked for a local artist aiding in the creation of large-scale abstract paintings and other contemporary works. I have also painted murals and have a love for photography. Although I work with several mediums, diving into the world of tattoos has been a game changer.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy hiking with my dog Onyx, climbing, boarding, and anything with adventure!\n\nCheck out my work!\n\nIG @christianfaith_tattoos\n\n​Armando Munoz, known as Armandean, was born on October 7, 1986, in Mexico. Growing up in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Estado de Mexico, he developed a passion for drawing, often getting in trouble at school for sketching during classes. His inspiration came from his father, an artist who painted murals in their home. At 21, Armandean's journey into tattooing began when a friend asked him to fix a poorly done tattoo. Despite having no experience, he used his drawing skills to create his first tattoo, sparking his interest in the craft. He started working at Tianguis de Lagunilla and later joined prominent studios in Mexico City, including Gallonegro, Soulflower Custom Tattoo, and Tatudemia. In 2018, he founded his own studio, \"Viernes 13 Tattoo Collective,\" bringing together some of Mexico's top tattoo artists. With over 10 years in the industry, Armandean has attended renowned conventions worldwide and worked as a guest artist in many countries. His unique style combines realism and contemporary art, characterized by dark and vibrant colors influenced by New York City. Currently, Armandean is a member of the pro team at World Famous Ink."
