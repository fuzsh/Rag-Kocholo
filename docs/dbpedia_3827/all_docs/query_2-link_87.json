        "text": "When I was a teenager, I was given the book Men of Mathematics by E. T. Bell, and I rather enjoyed it. I know that this book has been criticized for various reasons and I might even agree with some of the criticism, but let's not digress onto that. E. T. Bell made a reasonable list of 34 of the greatest mathematicians from the ancient Greek period to the end of the 19th century. His list isn't perfect — maybe he should have included Klein or skipped Poncelet — but no such list can be perfect anyway. I think that his selection was good. He also made the careers of these mathematicians exciting and he addressed why mathematicians care about them today. It helped me learn what achievements and topics in mathematics are important.\n\n(Just to head off discussion, the standard complaints include that the title is sexist and so is the book, that Bell was loose with biographical facts, and that he \"chewed the scenery\".)\n\nAfter the period covered by Bell, there is a 50-70 year gap, followed by the the Fields Medals. The list of Fields Medalists has its own limitations, but it is another interesting, comparably long list of great mathematicians. Somewhat accidentally, this list also orients and motivates advanced mathematics students today.\n\nBut who are the great mathematicians in the gap itself, that is, those born between 1850 and 1900, or say between 1860 and 1910? (Or 1920 at the latest; that is what I had before.) There is a good expanded list of mathematicians with biographies at the St. Andrews site. However, it is too long to work as a sequel to Bell's book. (Not that I plan to write one; I'm just asking.) If you were to make a list of 20 to 50 great mathematicians in this period, how would you do it or who would they be? Presumably it would include Hilbert, but who else? (Poincaré was born in 1854 and is the latest born in Bell's list.)\n\nFor example, I know that there was the IBM poster \"Men of Modern Mathematics\" that also earned some criticism. But I don't remember who was listed, and my recollection is that the 1850-1900 period was somewhat cramped.\n\nI decided based on the earliest responses to convert this list to community wiki. But I am not just asking people to throw out names one by one and then vote them up. If a good reference for this question already exists, or if there is some kind of science to make a list, then that would be ideal. If you would like to post a full list, great. If you would like to list one person who surely should be included and hasn't yet been mentioned, then that's also reasonable. It may be better to add years of birth and death in parentheses, for instance \"Hilbert (1862-1943)\".\n\nNote: To make lists, you should either add two spaces to the end of each line, or \" - \" (space dash space) to the beginning of each line.\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\nNothing very scientific, I'm afraid, but I do have my favourites from this period. Of course, Hilbert, but in addition: Élie Cartan, Emmy Noether, Hermann Weyl, Paul Dirac (if one is allowed to consider him a mathematician), Kurt Gödel, André Weil, Israel Gelfand, Laurent Schwartz. And I'm sure that I'm leaving many in the inkwell, so to speak.\n\nA more scientific approach -- I'm fully aware of its pitfalls! -- is that given our propensity for naming things after people, one could draw a list by counting attributions using the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Princeton Companion as corpus.\n\nEdit\n\nOK, this time $\\epsilon$ more scientifically. I took The Princeton Companion to Mathematics (don't ask), converted the PDF to text, analysed the word frequency and isolated the names mentioned among the answers thus far. I then fed the results to Wordle and obtained the following amusing name cloud:\n\nI've also made available a larger PDF version of the image. Needless to say, one has to take this with a grain of salt. It's a first approximation. For example, no effort has been made to distinguish between Cartans, Artins, 'von Neumann' actually denotes the appearances of 'Neumann'. Not to mention the fact that as Greg points out in a comment below, it is heavily biased in favour of those mathematicians after whom we name things. But I take it we are aware that any such lists are bound to have an element of bias and subjectivity.\n\nGlorfindel\n\n2,74166 gold badges2727 silver badges3737 bronze badges\n\nanswered Dec 30, 2009 at 7:47\n\nJosé Figueroa-O'FarrillJosé Figueroa-O'Farrill\n\n33.1k44 gold badges102102 silver badges183183 bronze badges\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\n$\\begingroup$\n\nMotivated by an e-mail from grshutt, I looked myself at the Princeton Companion to Mathematics. I discovered that the editors of the PCM answered the same question as the one that I posed here. Part VI is a collection of biographies of 95 mathematicians, plus one for Bourbaki, and the fact that the Bernoullis share a slot. They chose 37 mathematicians born between 1850 and 1920, exactly in the middle of the range that I suggested. See the table contents to see who they picked. They also wrote nice biographies, although they are much shorter and more sedate than E.T. Bell's single-author work.\n\nIt is a little embarrassing that we had this whole discussion without noticing that the PCM, with Timothy Gowers as the chief editor, had already done the same work. But it is also useful. It seems that when informed people carefully make lists of influential mathematicians of comparable length, they'll arrive at roughly the same list. Typically the intersection is about 1/2 if the lists are exactly the same length. PCM's list is longer than Bell (in the corresponding period) and mine, and shorter than Pete's, so we can look at who I (or Harrison) included but they did not, or who they included but Pete did not.\n\nPCM minus Pete: Fredholm, Vallée-Poussin, Russell, Sierpinski*, Littlewood*, Skolem, Ramanujan*, Courant, Kolmogorov*, Church, Hodge* (* = honorable mention in Pete's list)\n\nme minus PCM: Picard, Hurwitz, Lefschetz, Siegel, Chevalley, Gelfand\n\nHarrison minus PCM: Henri Cartan, MacLane, Erdos, Feynman\n\nBell minus PCM: Zeno, Eudoxus, Poncelet, Monge\n\nPCM $\\cap$ Pete $\\cap$ Harrison $\\cap$ me: Hilbert, Minkowski, Hausdorff, Cartan, Noether, Weyl, Banach, von Neumann, Godel, Weil\n\nSome of the differences can be explained as a somewhat different emphasis. In listing Russell and Church, the PCM gave more credit to the philosophical end of logic. (This is also grshutt's point in in his answer posted here and in his letter.) Whether Feynman should \"count\" is another question with two different reasonable answers. (As I said in a comment, the argument for Feynman is that he is an architect of quantum field theory, and quantum field theory is arguably a fundamental mathematical theory, even though parts of it haven't been made rigorous.)\n\nAnd I suppose that some of the differences indicate the ill-defined side of the question, or they are just random fluctuations, and aren't really worth arguing over.\n\n$\\endgroup$"
