        "text": "Born 1954 in Mortsel (Belgium), Koen Lenaerts obtained a law degree in 1977 from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium) before continuing his studies at Harvard University, USA, where he obtained a Master of Laws in 1978 and a Master in Public Administration in 1979. Returning to Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, he became a Doctor of Laws in 1982.\n\nIt was at that same university that he started his professional career in 1979 as a lecturer before becoming a Professor of European Law in 1983. During his university career, he also taught at the College of Europe in Bruges (Belgium) from 1984 to 1989 and as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, USA, in 1989.\n\nMr Lenaerts began his career at the Court of Justice as a legal secretary to Judge René Joliet, a post which he held from 1984 to 1985 before working as a lawyer at the Brussels Bar from 1986 to 1989.\n\nHe was appointed as a Judge at the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on 25 September 1989, the date on which that newly created court was established. He served in that capacity for more than 14 years before being appointed as a Judge at the Court of Justice on 7 October 2003. He was elected by his peers to the office of President of Chamber for two successive terms from 9 October 2006 to 8 October 2012 and subsequently to the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice on 9 October 2012.\n\nHe was elected as President of the Court of Justice on 8 October 2015 and has held that office since then.\n\nBorn in 1953 in Gladsaxe, Copenhagen (Denmark), Mr Lars Bay Larsen studied at the Københavns Universitet (University of Copenhagen, Denmark). He graduated in political science in 1976. In 1978, he returned to study at the same university, this time enrolling in the Faculty of Law, where he obtained a law degree in 1983.\n\nAfter leaving the university, he was appointed as an official at the Danish Ministry of Justice where he worked from 1983 to 1985. From 1985 to 1986, he was Head of Section at the Advokatsamfund (Danish Bar Association). After returning to the Danish Ministry of Justice, he served successively as Head of Section from 1986 to 1991, Head of Division from 1991 to 1995, Head of the Police Department from 1995 to 1999, and Head of the Law Department from 2000 to 2003. During that period, he was also Representative of the Kingdom of Denmark on the K4 Committee from 1995 to 2000, the Schengen Central Group from 1996 to 1998, and the Europol Management Board from 1998 to 2000. He was called to the Bar in Denmark in 1991 and, in 2003, his career turned to the judiciary. At that time, he joined the Højesteret (Supreme Court, Denmark) where he served as a judge until 2006.\n\nMr Bay Larsen's career also illustrates the fruitful complementarity between practice and teaching, since he was a lecturer from 1984 to 1991 and then, from 1991 to 1996, an associate professor in family law at the Københavns Universitet. Since 2008, he has been a lecturer in European criminal law at the université du Luxembourg (University of Luxembourg).\n\nMr Bay Larsen has been a Judge at the Court of Justice since 11 January 2006. Having been elected by his peers to the position of President of Chamber, he performed that function for two successive terms, from 9 October 2012 to 8 October 2018.

He then served at the Varhoven sad (Supreme Court, Bulgaria) between 1986 and 1991 and at the Konstitutsionen sad (Constitutional Court, Bulgaria) from 1991 to 2000. He was a member of the European Commission of Human Rights from 1997 to 1999.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2006, he temporarily interrupted his legal career in order to devote himself to the process of Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, a process in which he actively participated as a Member of the Bulgarian Parliament and as an observer at the European Parliament from August 2005 to December 2006. From 2002 to 2003, he was involved in the drawing up of policy responses to the future challenges for the European Union in the context of the 2004 enlargement as a member of the Convention on the Future of Europe.\n\nOn 12 January 2007, a few days after Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, Mr Arabadjiev was appointed as a Judge at the Court of Justice and has served in that capacity since then.

From 1992 to 2007, she was scientific coordinator of the European Network of Legal Experts in Equality between Men and Women at the European Commission.\n\nHer expertise is shown not only through the publication of numerous articles but is also reflected in her commitment to law as a member of the editorial board of several national and international legal journals. Her skills have been recognised by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen (Royal Netherlands Acacemy of Science) of which she became a member in 2008.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1991, she assisted Judges Thijmen Koopmans and Paul Kapteyn successively as Legal Secretary at the Court of Justice.\n\nMs Prechal was appointed as a Judge at the Court of Justice on 10 June 2010.
