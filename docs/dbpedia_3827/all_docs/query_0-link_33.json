        "text": "Karl von Frisch: a quarter-Jew navigating the threat of forced retirement\n\nKarl von Frisch signed the questionnaire related to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on June 13, 1933, indicating catholic fate of his parents and grandparents.32 Based on this form, the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture acknowledged his proof of Aryan descent in the official list issued July 18, 1933.33\n\nHowever, in a letter of April 6, 1936, addressed to the rector’s office, Wilhelm Führer, now acting on behalf of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund34 of the University of Munich, requested von Frisch’s claim of Aryan descent to be re-reviewed, with high priority.35 This request was supported by testimonies signed on the same day by two assistants at the Zoological Institute of the University of Munich, Johannes Scharnke and Karl Eller.36 They testified that they had obtained information about the Jewish bloodline of at least one of von Frisch’s grandparents. In the same letter, and in a more detailed, eight-page-long letter dated May 15, 1936, to the Reichsministerium für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung (Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture), Wilhelm Führer and Ernst Bergdolt37 (acting on behalf of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund and the Dozentenschaft of the University of Munich) condemned von Frisch as a patron of Jews and as an opponent of the ‘New Era’:\n\nThe preference of Professor Frisch for anything Jewish, obviously based on his own Jewish blood, is compensated by a sometimes rather poorly hidden hate of national socialism.38\n\nThis request to re-review von Frisch’s racial descent, and to replace him by a new professor and director true to the party-line, triggered over the next few years further inquiries by several authorities of the Bavarian government in Munich and the Reich government in Berlin. On January 9, 1941, Karl von Frisch received, through the rector’s office, the following letter of the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture:\n\n“…according to the investigations of the Reich Ministry of Education, the Ordinarius at the University of Munich, Dr. Karl von Frisch, has been identified as a Mischling of the second degree.39 Thus, the Reich Minister of Science, Education and National Culture intends to retire him early.40\n\nKarl von Frisch vehemently refused to accept the intended forced retirement or, as had been suggested to him, to request himself early retirement. In an undated memorandum, probably written shortly after he had received notification of the intended forced retirement, he emphasized that...\n\n“…through my teaching, my research work, and, last not least, my contributions to the public understanding of science, I have served Volk and Reich to the best of my ability. I am not aware that I have done anything, either in word or action, that conflicts with the goals of the national socialist government.”41\n\nDuring meetings with authorities at the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture and the Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture, Karl von Frisch petitioned to reverse the intended forced retirement. He also made various efforts to demonstrate his loyalty that he had shown through his scientific work to the Reich. On February 2, 1941, he published a one-page article in Das Reich,42 in which he stressed the importance of the Zoological Institute not only for basic research and for teaching but also as a ‘feeder’ of applied science. At the end of his essay, he even went as far as praising the Deutsches Reich in its effort to utilize the work of contemporary genetics, “in the broadest form”, for the benefit of the Volk.43\n\nThe actions taken by von Frisch to prevent his imminent forced retirement were supported by several of his colleagues. Among the first, and perhaps most prominent, was Hans Spemann.44 On January 21, 1941, he wrote a letter to Bernhard Rust,45 the Reich Minister of Science, Education, and National Culture, in which he praised Karl von Frisch as “irreplaceable” and warned that the forced early retirement of von Frisch would be “the most severe blow to German biology one can think of.”46\n\nThe above petition letter and other expressions of support prompted discussions among high-ranking Nazi officials, including the Reich Minister of Science, Education, and National Culture, Bernhard Rust; the Reich Minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick47; and the Head of the Party Chancellery, Martin Bormann.48 However, possible considerations for granting exception to the forced retirement of Karl von Frisch were vehemently opposed by the leader of the Dozentenschaft of the University of Munich, Ernst Bergdolt, who argued that von Frisch...\n\n…neither is irreplaceable [as claimed by his supporters] nor, due to his political attitude, does he, in the slightest, deserve that the application of the law be waived.49\n\nBormann, in a letter to Rust, came to the same conclusion:\n\nBefore and after the Machtübernahme (political takeover by the Nazis), Professor von Frisch interacted extensively with Jews. He has also repeatedly emphasized that science has suffered significantly through the emigration of Jews. I have received reports that he tried to remove all scientific and non-scientific staff with antisemitic attitudes from the Zoological Institute.50\n\nRust concurred with the recommendations made by Bergdolt and Bormann. In a letter dated October 2, 1941, he informed the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture about his intention to enforce the retirement of Karl von Frisch.51\n\nThe end of von Frisch’s scientific career seemed now inevitable. At this point of time, it is unlikely that further expression of support alone would have changed Rust’s decision. However, around the same time help came from a rather unexpected source—the Reichsministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft (Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture). Between 1940 and 1942, beekeepers in Germany and other European countries suffered heavy losses totaling hundreds of thousands of bee colonies due to nosemosis. This disease is caused by the microsporidium Nosema apis.52 Infection with this parasite of adult Apis mellifera at a young age affects the digestive system and causes them to not produce brood food (royal jelly). These bees also frequently skip the brood-rearing stage and become forager bees right away. Infected queen bees cease laying eggs. In addition, both types of bees have a shortened lifespan. The combination of these effects can result in the death of the colony.\n\nThe loss of bees due to the nosemosis plague resulted in a substantial reduction of the production of honey. Yet, economically even worse was the damage done through reduced crop pollination. A nosemosis task force, headed by Franz Wirz,53 was established to coordinate and fund research for combating the disease. In his memoirs, without mentioning the name of Wirz, Karl von Frisch wrote:\n\nThe chairman of this task force was an influential person in the area of food production. He was familiar with my work, and he was aware of my imminent forced retirement. He fervently acted on behalf of myself and the Institute. He deserves the credit that I was commissioned by the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture to carry out research on nosemosis (p. 116; von Frisch 1957).\n\nOn October 23, 1941, upon the invitation of the Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture, Richard Walther Darrè,54 the nosemosis task force, chaired by Wirz, met. Karl von Frisch, who attended this meeting, was selected to coordinate the scientific efforts. Given von Frisch’s mastery in pulling the strings, it might have been no accident that soon after this meeting a petition letter arrived at the Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture, signed by eight zoology professors and lecturers at the University of Munich (Fig. ). The signers included Ruth Beutler and the following:\n\nReinhard Demoll (1882–1960). He was Ordinarius for Zoology and Ichthyology at the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and widely renowned for his scientific work; he served as rector of the University of Munich during the academic year 1931/32.\n\nMax Dingler (1883–1961). He was a zoologist, Bavarian dialect poet, environmentalist, and director of the Bavarian State Natural Science Collection. Although regarded by many of his colleagues a rather mediocre scientist, he was bestowed an honorary professorship at the University of Munich, primarily based on his engagement for the Nazi movement (Litten 1996).\n\nKarl Escherich (1871–1951). He was Ordinarius for Applied Zoology at the University of Munich, where he specialized in applied entomology. He was rector of the University from 1933 to 1935. An early member of the NSDAP, he participated in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, a failed attempt led by Adolf Hitler to overthrow the German government in 1923.\n\nWerner Jacobs (1901–1972). A highly recognized entomologist, he was a Kurator and außerordentlicher Professor at the Zoological Institute.\n\nHerman Kahmann (1906–1990). A zoologist specializing on small mammals, he was a zoologist who had joined Karl von Frisch as an assistant in 1938. Tiefenbacher (1991), in an obituary of Kahmann, quotes the following comment made by von Frisch after World War II: “He [Kahmann] was a fierce opponent of national socialism. Often, he expressed his opposition so openly that he put himself into enormous danger.”\n\nI was not able to unambiguously identify the signatures of two other signers. One might have been Wilhelm Köhler, a wissenschaftlicher Assistant (lecturer) of zoology and genetics.\n\nThe letter reads as follows:\n\nThe signatories of this memorandum, professors and lecturers of zoology at the University of Munich, are extremely concerned of the imminent danger of losing their colleague and teacher Karl von Frisch. They, therefore, approach the Reich Ministry with the sincere request to do everything to avert this danger.\n\nIn German zoology, Karl von Frisch is irreplaceable as a researcher, organizer, and writer. He is a successful instructor who is much liked by students enrolled in a wide range of science degree programs. Likewise, the inner circle of fellows at his institute are eternally grateful to, and express their unrestricted admiration for, him, their intellectual leader. He is a constant source of inspiration and an example of unlimited willingness to help others. The University of Munich would not stand any chance to replace him; no one in biology and physiology even comes close to him.55\n\nIt might have been Wirz’s repeated interventions in support of von Frisch,56 in combination with the help by other scientists, including the eight professors and lecturers of the University of Munich, that prompted Rust to revert his previous decision. On February 10, 1942, he granted permission that von Frisch could continue conducting his studies on nosemosis after his forced retirement.57 However, after von Frisch had sent a letter, dated March 14, 1942, to the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture in which he argued that his retirement would severely limit his ability to do research, including the work on nosemosis,58 the Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture and Martin Bormann finally agreed to…\n\n…delay the retirement of Professor von Frisch until the time after the war.59\n\nWhereas the commissioned research on nosemosis protected von Frisch from forced retirement, it is unclear how much he himself engaged in this project. His bibliography, published by Autrum (1982), lists only two short communications on nosemosis (von Frisch 1943, 1944). In his memoirs, he spends just two lines on summarizing the outcome of this research:\n\nAs a matter of fact, we did not succeed in bringing these studies [on nosemosis] to a satisfactory conclusion by the end of the war (p. 116; von Frisch 1957).\n\nIt seems that most of the commissioned work was carried out by Ruth Beutler. Together with Elisabeth Opfinger, she published a paper on nosemosis (Beutler and Opfinger 1950). Nevertheless, even the results of their investigation were rather modest: feeding of pollen lengthens longevity of both healthy and infected young bees, but such a diet is effective only if it starts no later than on the tenth day of life of the bees.\n\n1Ritter (‘knight’) denotes the second-lowest rank within the German nobility.\n\n2Karl Ritter von Frisch (1886–1982) was an Austrian zoologist. In 1925, he was appointed Ordinarius at the University of Munich. In 1932, he received from the Rockefeller Foundation 993,000 Reichsmark (approximately 4.2 million U.S. Dollar, corresponding to a purchasing power of nearly 90 million U.S. Dollar in 2022) to build what was then the most modern zoological institute in Germany. In 1973, Karl von Frisch received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering contributions to the study of animal behavior. He was also co-founder of the Zeitschrift für vergleichende Physiologie (the predecessor of the Journal of Comparative Physiology A) and served as its Editor-in-Chief from 1924 to 1960.\n\n3Alfred Kühn (1885–1968) was a German zoologist and developmental biologist.\n\n4Sibylle Köhler (née Beutler), born July 27, 1936, is the daughter of Otto Beutler and his second wife Jutta Freiin von Wagner, and the niece of Ruth Beutler. Interviews were conducted by GKHZ at her residence in Kranenburg (Germany) on September 10, 2022, and January 4, 2023.\n\n5Interview (GKHZ) with Sibylle Köhler in Kranenburg, Germany, on September 10, 2022; BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n6The Deutschnationale Volkspartei (DNVP; German National People’s Party) was the major national-conservative party during the Weimar Republic before the rise of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP; National Socialist Workers’ Party). The DNVP rejected the republican Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles and aimed at restoration of monarchy. After 1929, the DNVP co-operated with the NSDAP and supported Adolf Hitler’s appointment as Reichskanzler (Chancellor) in January 1933. In June 1933, the DNVP dissolved itself, with the majority of its former members joining the NSDAP. Several former DNVP members were involved in the plot to overthrow Hitler on July 20, 1944.\n\n7Notes written by Ruth Beutler in Munich around 1946 (provided by Sibylle Köhler).\n\n8Heinrich Himmler (1900–1945) was a leading politician during the Nazi era. The positions he held included Reichsführer-SS, Minister of Interior, and Chief of the German Police. He was also one of the main architects of the Holocaust.\n\n9BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n10UAM E-II-884. Ruth Beutler’s niece, Sibylle Köhler, remembers from conversations within the family that her aunt was initially wrongly treated for arthritis (interview with GKHZ in Kranenburg, Germany, on September 10, 2022).\n\n11UAM VA A-I-40-2.\n\n12In many universities in Europe and other countries, the chief executive is referred to as rector. The position is comparable to those of president at U.S.-American universities and of vice-chancellor at universities of Commonwealth nations.\n\n13Karl von Frisch used the Nazi ‘Heil Hitler!’ salute regularly in his correspondence with superiors at the University or authorities of the German Reich during the Nazi era.\n\n14BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n15Ibid.\n\n16Resume of Ruth Beutler; BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n17Ibid.\n\n18Richard Wilhelm Karl Theodor Ritter von Hertwig (1850–1937) was a German embryologist.\n\n19Short form for professor ordinarius. Until the 1970s, highest-ranked professorial position in Germany. As holder of a chair in a subject area (e.g., zoology), the Ordinarius defined the teaching of this area and was line-manager of lower-ranked professors affiliated with him.\n\n20Resume of Ruth Beutler; BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n21Ibid.\n\n22The first woman was Adele Hartmann (1881–1937), who had received her Habilitation in medicine in 1918. Hartmann was not only the first woman who received this highest academic degree from the University of Munich but also the first woman from any German university.\n\n23Resume of Ruth Beutler; BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n24http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/beamtenges.html.\n\n25BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n26Ibid.\n\n27UAM E-II-884. After 1935, the autonomy of universities was severely restricted and professorial appointments required the approval of the Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture in Berlin. This policy was part of the measures taken by the government under Adolf Hitler to ensure that professors were appointed not just based on scientific merit but also on their conformity with Nazi ideology. A central role in the latter process played Dozentenschaften (cf. Mertens L (2004) „Nur politisch Würdige “: Die DFG-Forschungsförderung im Dritten Reich 1933–1937. Akademie Verlag, Berlin). Initially founded by young Nazis as a representation of non-professorial academic staff at universities, later they included professors and assumed a far-reaching political mandate. By evaluating the ideological suitability of candidates and making recommendations, they played a critical role in the appointment of professors.\n\n28Wilhelm Führer (1904–1974), a German astronomer, was a leading figure in the Dozentenschaft at the University of Munich and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund. In these functions, and as a bureaucrat in the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture in Munich, and the Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture in Berlin, he frequently pursued the dismissal of Jews and politically undesirable persons from their university positions. In parallel, he progressed through the ranks of the Waffen-SS, and served, among others, as aide-de-camp of Heinrich Himmler (https://ns-reichsministerien.de/2020/03/10/wilhelm-fuehrer/).\n\n29BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n30In his letter, Karl von Frisch used the word Mitarbeiterin, which indicates in German a female staff member. This wording leaves it open to interpretation whether he meant that Ruth Beutler was the most successful among his female staff members, or whether she was the most successful among all staff members, including men and women.\n\n31BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n32BayHSta MK 54482.\n\n33BayHSta MK 43414.\n\n34The Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (National Socialist German University Lecturers League) was established as a suborganization of the NSDAP in 1935. Its Gau (district) leaders played an important role in the appointment of faculty at universities, and in the dismissal of Jewish scientists or scientists whose political views did not align with Nazi ideology.\n\n35BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n36Ibid.\n\n37Ernst Bergdolt (1902–1948) was a German botanist and non-tenure track professor at the University of Munich.\n\n38BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n39In Nazi terminology, a Mischling of the second degree, or quarter jew, was (regardless of religious affiliation or self-identification), a person with one Jewish grandparent.\n\n40BayHSta MK 54482.\n\n41BAB R4901/24579.\n\n42Das Reich was a weekly newspaper founded by Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister of the Nazi government, in 1940. Its circulation grew to over 1.4 million by 1944, making it one of the most-read newspapers during the Nazi era. Goebbels himself contributed a weekly editorial. Unlike other Nazi newspapers, such as Der Völkische Beobachter, Das Reich was targeted at a more educated readership. The high journalistic quality of many of its articles contributed significantly to the intended glossing over the negative reality of the Nazi regime.\n\n43Based on pseudoscientific ideas about genetics, the Nazis proclaimed the need for Rassenhygiene (‘racial hygiene’, eugenics), involving the promotion of selective breeding of Höherwertige (superior people; under Nazi, ideology people of Nordic or Aryan traits), while excluding Minderwertige (inferior people; under Nazi ideology, for example, people with congenital cognitive and physical disabilities, and homosexuals) from reproduction. As a result, an estimated 400,000 people were sterilized against their will. Up to 300,000 people were murdered just in the Aktion T4, one of the major euthanasia programs.\n\n44Hans Spemann (1869–1941) was a German developmental biologist and Ordinarius for Zoology at the University of Freiburg from 1919 to 1937. Together with his PhD student Hilde Mangold, he discovered embryonic induction, a process through which a group of cells (the so-called ‘organizer’) directs the development of other cells. For this work, he received a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1935.\n\n45Bernhard Rust (1883–1945) was Reich Minister of Science, Education, and Culture from 1934–1945. He was instrumental in purging German universities of Jews and political adversaries. He also initiated a reform of Germany’s education system, aimed at immersing students into Nazi ideology.\n\n46BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n47Wilhelm Frick (1877–1946) served continuously in Adolf Hitler’s cabinet, first as Reich Minister of the Interior, then as Reich Minister without portfolio. He was instrumental in formulating several racist and antisemitic laws, including the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service in 1933 and the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. Frick was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trial and executed.\n\n48Martin Bormann (1900–1945) was Chief of the Nazi Party Chancellery (the head office of the Nazi party) and Private Secretary of the Führer. In these two capacities, he became one of the most powerful Nazi officials during the Third Reich.\n\n49Ernst Bergdolt in a letter to the Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and National Culture, dated May 20, 1941; BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n50Letter of Martin Bormann to Bernhard Rust, dated July 11, 1941; BAB R4901/24579.\n\n51BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n52Infection of Apis mellifera by a second microsporidium parasite, Nosema ceranae, was first identified in 2004.\n\n53Franz Wirz (1889–1969) was a German dermatologist and Nazi official who served in various leadership positions, including in the Hauptamt für Volksgesundheit der NSDAP-Reichsleitung (Head Office for People’s Health at the NSDAP Headquarter. After World War II, Karl von Frisch intervened on behalf of Wirz. In a letter dated, January 10, 1946, and addressed to the commanding officer of the Counter Intelligence Corps (a World War II and early Cold War intelligence agency within the United States Army) Detachment in Munich, he wrote: I have received news that Professor F. Wirz was apprehended end of December. I do not know what charges were brought against him. However, I would like to share some information with you in his defense. When, in 1940, the Reich Minister of [Science,] Education [, and Culture] had the intention to force me to retire, due to a non-Aryan grandmother, many people made great efforts so that I could remain in office, yet without success. When Professor Wirtz learned about this issue, he intervened vehemently on my behalf. It was him who made arrangements, so that my forced retirement was delayed until the end of the war… At his request, the Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture argued that, because of the importance of my research on bees for nutrition, they cannot afford losing me. Of course, Professor Wirz knew that I was not a member of the [Nazi] party, and that I was even opposed to its ideology. Nevertheless, he strongly supported me… (BSB, Ana 540.C.III.23.).\n\n54Richard Walther Darré (1895–1953) was Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942.\n\n55BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n56Franz Wirz summarizes some of his interventions on behalf of Karl von Frisch in a letter to Ministerialrat Küthe of the Reich Ministry of Food and Agriculture, dated December 17, 1941; BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n57Letter of Bernhard Rust to Richard Walther Darré, dated February 10, 1942; BAB R4901/24579.\n\n58BAB R 4901/24579.\n\n59Letter of Martin Bormann to the Reich Minister for Science and Education, dated April 27, 1942; response of the Reich Minister of Science and Education to the Head of the Party Chancellery, dated July 27, 1842; BAB R4901/24579.\n\n60Karl von Frisch is quite vague in his description of the approach he had proposed. What he appears to have suggested to Ruth Beutler is that, instead of first training scout bees to petri dishes associated with a particular scent near the hive and then moving these dishes gradually to more distant locations, she should simply train the bees to a scented feeding place near the hive, and then instantly move this setup to the distant location. Since, according to his hypothesis postulated in 1923, the dances of the bees do not contain information about the distance of food sources from the colony, he expected hive mates alerted by the scout bees to fly out to search for the odor associated with the new food source until they had arrived at the distant spot.\n\n61Increasing evidence over the last few decades has questioned the dichotomy of the round dance versus the waggle dance, as postulated by Karl von Frisch in both his original model of 1923 and the revised model of 1946. Such evidence includes the presence of waggle phases, as well as information about distance and direction, in round dances (Kirchner WH, Lindauer M, Michelsen A (1988) Honeybee dance communication: acoustical indication of direction in round dances. Naturwissenschaften 75:629–630; Jensen IL, Michelsen A, Lindauer M (1997) On the directional indications in the round dances of honeybees. Naturwissenschaften 84:452–454; Gardner KE, Seeley TD, Calderone NW (2008) Do honeybees have two discrete dances to advertise food sources? Anim Behav 75:1291–1300). These observations have led to the hypothesis that round dance and waggle dance are just the ends of a continuum, with the information communicated by the bees becoming less precise the closer the food source is to the hive (Gardner KE, Seeley TD, Calderone NW (2008) Do honeybees have two discrete dances to advertise food sources? Anim Behav 75:1291–1300). Moreover, even when food sources are at distant locations from the hive, the information conveyed by the returning bee indicates only the approximate location of the food. Additional pieces of information, such as the scent of the flowers that the dancing bee carried to the hive, and the pheromones of the Nasonov gland that this bee released when it discovered the new food source, are necessary for the recruited bee to find this source of food (for review see Tautz J (2022) Communication between honeybees: more than just a dance in the dark. Springer Nature, Cham). Interestingly, already Karl von Frisch described wagging during the round dance (p. 12, von Frisch K (1946) Die Tänze der Bienen. Österr Zool Zeitschr 1:1–48), but he did not attribute any functional significance to this behavior.\n\n62Albert Maucher (1907–1981) became Ordinarius and Director of the Geological Institute at the University of Munich in 1947, after he had served as Interim Director for one year.\n\n63Siegfried Walter Souci (1904–1992) was Interim Director of the Institute of Pharmacy at the University of Munich from 1946 to 1947.\n\n64Karl Suessenguth (1893–1955) was Interim Director of the Botanical Institute at the University of Munich from 1945 to 1948.\n\n65In her letters to Karl von Frisch, Ruth Beutler frequently used abbreviations of last names. Here, she made reference to Klaus Clusius (1903–1963), Dean of the Faculty of Science. He was Ordinarius and Director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the University of Munich from 1936–1947.\n\n66Letter of Ruth Beutler to Karl von Frisch, dated July 2, 1947; BSB Ana 540.B.IV (Beutler, Ruth).\n\n67BayHStA MK 43414.\n\n68Ibid.\n\n69Fritz Machatschek (1876–1957) was an Austrian geographer and Ordinarius at the University of Munich from 1935 to 1946.\n\n70Paul Buchner (1886–1978) was a German zoologist and cell biologist, and a friend of Karl von Frisch. He received his PhD and Habilitation from the University of Munich. His research focus was on endosymbiosis.\n\n71Otto Koehler (1889–1974) was a German zoologist and ethologist, and a friend of Karl von Frisch. He received his PhD from the University of Munich. His research interests included a wide range of biological phenomena in a variety of organisms. He became best known for his demonstration of a pre-linguistic ‘number sense’ in several animal species, particularly birds.\n\n72Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Goetsch (1887–1960) was a German zoologist whose research focus was on social insects.\n\n73BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n74Ibid.\n\n75Ibid.\n\n76Ibid.\n\n77After the unconditional surrender of the Nazi German armed forces to the Allies, Germany was divided into four military occupation zones — the American, British, and French zones in the West, and the Soviet zone in the East. Similarly, Austria was split into four zones. Allied Military Travel Permits were required for travel between the zones and across borders.\n\n78Letter of Hans Rheinfelder to Karl von Frisch, dated July 16, 1948; BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n79BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n80Ibid.\n\n81Erich von Holst (1908–1962) was a German behavioral physiologist and founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen.\n\n82BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n83Ibid.\n\n84Ibid.\n\n85Otto Jessen (1891–1951) was a German geographer and Ordinarius at the University of Munich.\n\n86BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n87Letter of Karl von Frisch to the Bavarian State Ministry for Education and Culture, dated February 6, 1950; BayHStA MK 69782.\n\n88Hansjochem Otto Autrum (1907–2003) was a German animal physiologist.

His first condition was the Konservator position for Ruth Beutler. Although not all of his other conditions were met by the State Ministry, he accepted the offer and returned to Munich in 1950. However, in a letter dated June 26, 1951, he informed the State Ministry that he had received an (informal) invitation to join the University of Vienna as Ordinarius for Zoology. He repeated two previously presented requests as a condition for not further considering a possible offer from the University of Vienna, and he demanded an immediate answer; UAM E-II 1376.\n\n95Letter of the Bavarian State Ministry of Education and Culture to the rector’s office of the University of Munich, dated December 14, 1950; UAM PA allg. 26.\n\n96https://stadtgeschichte-muenchen.de/strassen/d_strasse.php?id=6063\n\n97BSB Ana 540.B.II (Beutler, Ruth).\n\n98BSB Ana 540.B.IV (Beutler, Ruth).\n\n99A letter of recommendation (BSB Ana 540.C.III.72), written by Karl von Frisch on behalf of Ruth Beutler, adds some information related to this question. The letter was, most likely, written on June 20, 1947 (on the carbon copy of the typed letter, only one digit of the year is visible, ‘7;’ considering the context of the letter, the year appears to be ‘1947’) and addressed to Alfred Kühn. Karl von Frisch acknowledges the work of Beutler, in her function as his deputy, …which is almost too much for her to bear. He, then, raises the question of what her career prospects will be after this interim position. He writes that …based on her accomplishments, she deserves, without any doubt, to be appointed to an Ordinarius position. On the other hand, his letter also indicates that his support is not unrestricted. In times like this, the pool of suitable candidates is very small. It would, therefore, be quite justified to entrust a woman with fulfilling the responsibility of an Ordinarius. I believe she [Ruth Beutler] would be up to the job if it were a smaller university, such as Erlangen. In concluding his letter, Karl von Frisch asks Alfred Kühn for his support in this matter, if he consents with the assessment of Ruth Beutler’s qualification.\n\n100Margarete von Wrangell (1877–1932) was the first female Ordinarius in Germany. She received her PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Tübingen in 1909 and was appointed to an Ordinarius position in plant nutrition at the Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Hohenheim (today known as the University of Hohenheim) in Stuttgart in 1923.\n\n101Nagler-Springmann (1997) cites in her essay the original German version of the book (Deichmann U (1992) Biologen unter Hitler.
