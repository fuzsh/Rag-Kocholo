        "text": "Conrad Otto Bickelmann was born in July 1855 at Bickeburg, Prussia in what is today’s Germany. He was the son of Otto C. and Friederike (Kramer) Bickelmann. He immigrated to the United States in 1872 at the age of 17 and settled at Brooklyn, New York.\n\nAlthough I cannot be certain that it is the same person, there is a record of an Otto Bickelmann, born in Germany, age 17, arriving at the United States on August 22, 1872. The record shows that the ship Nemesis left from Bremen and Southampton and arrived in the United States. Otto was listed with a literacy of “unknown” and an occupation of “Watchman.” There is some evidence that he used his first name Conrad and his middle name Otto interchangeably. For example, in the Brooklyn city directories of the 1880s and 1890s he is often listed as “C. Otto” and occasionally as just “Otto.”\n\nConrad was married twice. Four years after his arrival in the United States, at the age of 21, he first married Emilie (Brown) Bickelmann, also age 21, at Brooklyn on July 23, 1876. Emilie’s father was named Max and her mother was Christine Klippel. Both her parents were born in Germany. Emilie passed away at the age of 27 on April 15, 1882.\n\nFor the 1880 United States census, Conrad, age 25, was located at Brooklyn in Kings County. He was living with his wife Emily, age 25; his son Otto, age 2; and his son, Charles, age 1. Eight years after his arrival in the United States Conrad is listed with an occupation of “Artist,” while Emily was “Keeping House.”\n\nConrad married for a second time to Henrietta (Lohman) Bickelmann. She was born in August 1870. Henrietta passed away at the age of 90 at Tannersville on March 29, 1961. She is buried at Maplewood Cemetery in Hunter, New York.\n\nConrad’s son, Herman Gustave Bickelmann, would follow his father into the photography industry. Herman was born on February 17, 1881. He began learning about photography at 14 years of age. By the time of the 1900 United States census, Herman, age 19, was already listed with an occupation of “Photographer.” He moved to Tannersville around 1902. With the 1905 New York State census Herman was listed as living at Tannersville, continuing with an occupation of “Photographer.” He would be listed as either a photographer or proprietor of a photo studio on the 1900, 1905, 1910, 1920 and 1940 US and NY censuses. On the 1930 United States census he was listed with an occupation of “Merchant, retail gifts.” According to his 1918 World War I draft registration card Herman, age 37, was short, with a slender build, and had dark brown eyes and black hair. He married Emma C. (Lohman) Bickelmann. He passed away at the age 62 in November 1943. He is buried at the Maplewood Cemetery in Hunter, New York.\n\nWhile at Brooklyn, Conrad’s studio was first located at 397 Grand Street. Conrad was first listed as being at this location in the 1878 Brooklyn Directory (he was not listed in 1876; I could not find the 1877 issue). He moved out of the 397 Grand Street location around 1890 or 1891. The photo studio was later located at 497 Grand Street, and at 499 Grand Street, at the corner of Union Avenue in Brooklyn. He remained at the 499 Grand Street address until he left Brooklyn around 1902. These addresses are located in what is known as the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.\n\nOne resident, in 1926, offered his recollections of the businesses in that Williamsburg neighborhood during Bickelmann’s time there. “Herme’s cooperage, with its greasy, ill-smelling barrels; Kat’s creamery, Lochmann’s meat-chopping establishment, Dillon’s bakery, Darling’s fish market, Schumaker’s confectionary, Bickelmann’s photo gallery, Fink’s pharmacy, Babcock’s blue house, Naeher’s crockery store, Killey’s iron works, the Unique Theatre, Vosseler’s drug store, the Grand Hotel, North Side Bank and Lowenstein’s were all on Grand Street.” (“Grand Street Reminiscences of One Who Knew the Thoroughfare From Ferry to Creek.” The Brooklyn Standard Union. April 25, 1926.)\n\nAnother resident, in 1938, offered similar recollections of “Old Williamsburg.” “Nearer East River. Now let’s go farther down toward the East River. Remember Blaisdell’s wood works on Kent Ave. – Pat Ralph, the Alderman of the 14th Ward back in 1888 – the big fires, Dick and Meyer’s sugar house, and Weidermann’s barrel factory, both on N. 7th St. near the river – Hathaways’s tobacco store – Levy’s drug store – Darling’s fish store – Fitter’s butcher shop – Bickelmann’s photo studios – the button factory on N. 1st S. – Berry – the Tivoli brewery on N. 1st St. – Grand Central Palace on Grand St. – Karcher’s pork store on Grand St.” (“Old Williamsburg.” Brooklyn Eagle. November 13, 1938.)\n\nPortraits by C. O. Bickelmann. Author's Collection.\n\nIn addition to his studio at Brooklyn, Bickelmann was also operating in the Catskill Mountains by the late 1870s, and advertised in the 1882 Van Loan’s Catskill Mountain Guide. “C. O. Bickelmann’s Souvenir Bazaar (Formerly at Laurel House), Now at Tannersville, Where will be found a good assortment of Turned and Carved Wood Ornaments, Fashioned from woods grown on the mountains. In connection therewith will be found a first-class photo-art gallery. Special attention paid to fine group pictures. Ice cream, confectionary and refreshments. Long range rifle on the grounds.”\n\nThe Laurel House, where Bickelmann had been operating, was perched near the top of famed Kaaterskill Falls, the highest falls in New York State. The house was constructed as a boarding house in 1852 by Peter Schutt, and later managed by his son Jacob L. Schutt. The house originally had room for 50 visitors but was expanded after the Civil War and again in the early 1880s to accommodate approximately 300 people. The hotel was very popular given its location near the falls, its views of Kaaterskill Clove and its moderate pricing when compared to the more upscale Catskill Mountain House and the Kaaterskill Hotel. The hotel was named for the mountain laurel (kalmia latifolia) that grows and blossoms around the area. The grand hotel operated until 1963, when it was acquired by New York State two years later and its grounds added to the Catskill Forest Preserve. The state intentionally burned the historic structure in March 1967.\n\nAfter selling his business in Williamsburg, he permanently moved to Tannersville sometime in the early 1900s, possibly around 1902. There he bought a large piece of property and constructed a photography studio as well as a taxidermy building. In addition to his photography interests Bickelmman was also a taxidermist as a hobby.\n\nLake and two Bridges at the Poggenburg, Elka Park, Greene Co., N.Y. C. O. Bickelmann. Postmark 1912. Author’s collection.\n\nFor the 1905 New York census, Conrad, age 49, was located at Tannersville. He was living with his wife, age 34; his son Herman, age 24; and his daughter Edna, age 5. Conrad is listed with an occupation of “Hotel Proprietor.”\n\nPostcards published by Bickelmann would often advertise its photographer as “C. O. Bickelmann at the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar.” Bickelmann’s souvenir shop offered, in addition to his photography, a range of tourist friendly offerings such as ice cream, confectionary, refreshments, soda water and more.\n\nAlligator Rock, Catskill Mts., N. Y. C. O. Bickelmann at the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar. Author’s collection.\n\nAfter Conrad’s passing in 1914, the souvenir store passed on to his son Herman Bickelmann. In 1922 he was advertising for the sale of the business. “Souvenir and Novelty Store Property. For Sale – Established 40 years. Corner center of business section on Main Street, to settle estate. For further information call or write H. G. Bickelmann, Tannersville, N.Y.” (Republican Watchman. 1922.) And in 1970 the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar advertised that it was “Now open for our 45th season.” (Stamford Mirror-Recorder. June 17, 1970.)\n\nAfter the ownership of Herman Bickelmann, the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar was for a time owned and operated by the Winokur family. Upon the passing of Gerald Winokur in 2013 his obituary noted that his family often spent summers at Tannersville “where his family owned the storied Rip Van Winkle Bazaar, a general store that served generations of Catskill summer residents.”\n\nIn 1964 the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar placed an advertisement in the local newspaper announcing its “opening for its 80th season. 80 Years The Largest Souvenir and Gift Shop on the Mountain Top.” The bazaar offered toys, games, sporting goods, jewelry, novelties, souvenirs and more. The business continued to operate as the Rip Van Winkle Bazaar into the early 1970s.\n\nBickelmann’s studio was located at 6023 Main Street in Tannersville. The building is included on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Tannersville Main Street Historic District. As part of the application for inclusion on the National Register the building was described in detail:\n\n“Three stories; four bay cross-gabled structure with rear mansard roof; five bay west addition; asphalt shingle roof; wood clapboard siding with wood shingles in gables; north elevation has a front porch at first floor with hipped roof and wood brackets; two one-light storefront windows with two-light transoms and beadboard base; glazed aluminum entrance door; 1/1 aluminum windows with stylized wood shutters; oval multi-light window on east side gable; east elevation has a two-story raised porch with turned wood posts and balustrade on second floor and a contemporary wood porch on its roof; east and west elevations have 1/1 aluminum windows. West addition has a side gabled asphalt roof, a central glazed aluminum door with wood portico and four one-light shop windows. West addition and side gabled section of building built c. 1890. Cross-gable built c. 1900.\n\nWhen originally constructed, the east building was a dwelling and the west addition was a photo studio. By 1903 the building was expanded with the addition of the cross-gable and the photo studio occupied the entire first floor of the combined structure. The east section of the building was converted into a retail storefront in the 1940s but the west addition continued to be used as a photo studio. The building has undergone a recent renovation.”\n\nView of Main Street in the village of Tannersville, New York. The short building on the right with the skylights is the photography studio of Conrad O. Bicklemann. The postmark shows that it was mailed in 1909. Author’s collection.\n\nBickelmann published a series of scenic views in a set called “Catskill Mountain Scenery.” Below is a small example of the photographs included within the series.\n\nCauterskill Falls in Winter. C. O. Bickelmann from his Catskill Mountain Scenery series. Author’s collection.\n\nIn 1902 Conrad was assigned one-half of a new patent by Fred H. Crum for a Christmas tree holder. Patent number 703,554, dated July 1, 1902, stated the Crum had “invented certain new and useful Improvements in Christmas-Tree Holders . . .”\n\nA small collection of approximately 60 of Bickelmann’s photographs are held in the archives of the Library of Congress. The collection includes exterior views of houses and cottages, summer resorts and the Bear and Fox Inn. Of the 60 photographs, only 10 have been digitized and are available for viewing on the Library of Congress website. The 10 photographs currently available include:\n\nView from Onteora Bear & Fox Inn\n\nBirdseye view of Elka Park\n\nHunter Village, Catskill Mtns., N.Y.\n\nTannersville & Haines Falls, Catskill Mts., N.Y.\n\nSchoharie Mansion\n\nHunter Village, N.Y.\n\nTannersville, N.Y.\n\nTannersville, Catskill Mountains, N.Y.\n\nKinder Rooke\n\nWitchwood\n\nHunter Village, Catskill Mtns., N.Y.\n\nSource: Bickelmann, C.

Witchwood was constructed in 1891. The home takes its name from its original owners, the Woods family, and Wychwood Park in Toronto, the hometown of a frequent visitor to Onteora Park. The photograph was taken by Bickelmann in 1899.\n\nSource: Bickelmann, C. O, photographer. Witchwood. Photograph. Retrieved from the Library of Congress, <www.loc.gov/item/2017648608/>.\n\nThe Catskills, by T. Morris Longstreth, contains several of Bickelmann’s photographs. The book was published four years after his passing in 1918. The photographs include “Natty Bumpo’s View”, offering a panoramic view of the Hudson Valley from Pine Orchard; “Profile Near Palenville,” offering a look at Profile Rock in Kaaterskill Clove; and “Out Windham Way,” offering a panoramic view of the northern Catskills.\n\nThe Catskills is one of the best books ever written about that famous region. The travelogue follows the author as he journeys through the Catskill Mountains in 1918. Longstreth takes you to Overlook Mountain, Stony Clove, Phoenicia, Hunter, Slide Mountain, Kaaterskill Falls, the Ashokan Reservoir, Mount Utsayantha and many more places. Along the way Longstreth fishes the mountain streams, sleeps under the stars, lodges at local boarding houses and dairy farms, tramps the backroads, talks to the people and witnesses the many majesties of nature. The book has an easy flow, making the pages turn by effortlessly. Interspersed throughout the book are great pieces of advice which, taken by themselves, are worth the read.\n\nIn addition to photographing everyday people of the city and the mountains, Bickelmann was also known to photograph celebrities. One such example is his timeless photograph of the famous Maude Adams (1872-1953), the most popular and highly paid actress of her time. Adams acted in a number of Broadway shows, most notably Peter Pan, and later became a professor of dramatic arts at Stephens College at Columbia, Missouri. She owned a summer home named Caddam Hill at Tannersville. The Bickelmann photograph of Maude Adams is held at the Digital Collection of the New York Public Library.\n\nMaude Adams.\n\nSource: Billy Rose Theatre Division, The New York Public Library.

He was living with his wife Henrietta, age 39; and his daughter Edna, age 10. He is listed as having been married twice, with the current marriage lasting for 11 years. Henrietta is listed as having had one child, that child being alive. Conrad is listed with an occupation of “Photographer.”\n\nConrad Otto Bickelmann passed away at the age of 58 on April 25, 1914. Upon his passing it was written that he “was formerly one of the leading photographers of the city of Williamsburg, Long Island, which is now a part of Greater New York City. He was an earnest and enthusiastic photographer and kept pace with the advances in photographic business.” (“C. O. Bickelmann.” Snap Shots. Volume 25, Number 5. May 1914.) A private funeral was held at his residence. He is buried at Maplewood Cemetery at Hunter, New York.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIf you should have any additional information, comments or corrections about the photographer Conrad O.
