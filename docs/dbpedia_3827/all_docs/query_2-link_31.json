You will savor the flavor of the recipes and prose. This is a literary smorgasbord. An exquisite presentation offering something for everyone. A rarity for any book of any genre. Definitely a must read.\n\nAn Otto-Biography\n\nOtto G Borsich II\n\nRead full book details here...\n\nAbout Me\n\nOtto G. Borsich II\n\nMe, I’m a small town boy with a big city heart. Born and raised in the Heartland on the North Coast of America I love all things Ohio. The Dawg Pound, the Tribe, the Cav’s and the Buckeyes.\n\nI grew up in an agriculture hamlet known as Brownhelm. Sandwiched between the heart of rock and roll and Cedar Point, the roller coaster capital of the world. Born in the new frontier, surviving the tumultuous sixties, I shipped out for the Navy when punk was shattering the disco ball and never looked back. The Navy was my ticket out of the cornfields to the deep sea as a cook on the USS Patrick Henry SSBN 599, a submarine based in Pearl Harbor. I was plotting my course to become a chef.\n\nContinue reading more about me…\n\nChef, Author, Speaker, Humanitarian\n\nI love this book! Otto’s recipe for life is as warm and nutritious as his recipes for food! He delights us with musical pairings, hilarious antidotes, poems, proverbs, even a White House recipe. Delicious!\n\nMarcia Gay HardenAcademy Award Winning Actress\n\nA fun read about becoming a chef, an instructor, and believer. Motivated by others on his journey including old school restauranteurs and the originality and bravado of Bruce Springsteen. The interwoven personal recipes are a nice touch.\n\nDavid BurkeJames Beard Award Winner, Patent Holder, Restaurateur, and Culinary Prankster\n\nHail to the Chef! Otto Borsich serves up an inspiring, delicious, and nourishing feast in A Chef is Born. You will ask for seconds.\n\nDr. Connie MarianoWhite House Physician, Rear Admiral, USN (retired), author of The White House Doctor: My Patients were Presidents\n\nA fascinating heartfelt story. Individual, yet universal in its expression. Otto’s love of food combined with his passion for cooking as an offering to others, gives new meaning to Brillat-Saverin’s, the famous 18th century gastronome’s statement, “There is no place like the table to reconcile mind and body to a life that is necessarily too short and too indifferent”. This book is an inspiration for all.\n\nBarry WineChef, Former Owner of the Quilted Giraffe\n\nA great storyteller combining history, music, recipes, and spirituality, this is a superlative memoir. Like a three-star Michelin meal, you will not forget Otto. Now the world will get to know the great soul that I’ve had the pleasure of knowing for decades. This is his story, in his words. No one better to tell it.\n\nJoseph KellerChef-Owner, Company of the Cauldron Nantucket, Massachusetts\n\nOtto is a master wordsmith who keeps the reader enthralled through each phase of his food journey. Then he cleverly ends each chapter with recipes that fit into the story line. The only problem I have with the book is when I’m reading at night in bed. I want to go into the kitchen and start making the recipes!\n\nDean FearingChef-Owner, Fearing’s Restaurant James Beard Award Winner\n\nPrevious\n\nNext"
