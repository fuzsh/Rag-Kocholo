        "text": "Absolutely the best place to get a tattoo or piercing! It’s a great spa like environment and they make everyone feel welcome and relaxed. I have had a couple of piercings and want to get a couple more, Barron is wonderful and explains everything. He makes getting a piercing relaxing. Emily is one of the best tattoo artists. She listens to what you want and makes it fit your body, no matter what shape or size you are. Highly recommend Born This Way Body Arts and all of the awesome people that work there, from the office staff to the artists!\n\n- Jennifer E.\n\nI went to see Tyler Bernard to get all of my facial piercings changed out with new jewelry and a new piercing. I can not recommend him enough! The quality and selection of jewelry was amazing, he was very friendly and easy to talk to! He also made the whole process easy and comfortable. I’ve been to a lot of piercers in my life, and he’s by far the best. Couldn’t be happier with my experience! Thank you again!\n\n- Amber Wingler\n\nAlthough I didn’t end up getting pierced here, I want others to know the level of integrity that these people have. I came in with an idea for a piercing and was warned of possible downsides. I also asked if I would be able to sustain a new ear piercing when my work requires me to wear headphones, and they advised against it. I appreciated the honesty and I will definitely be back when it’s a better time for me to care for a piercing. Not many shops are willing to turn down money for safety ethics- super special place!\n\n- Bridget\n\nThis was such a great experience. Barron did my septum piercing. I’ve had it done once before by another shop and it was terrible. I didn’t realize how terrible that experience was until I had such a fantastic one today. My nose is comfortable considering I just had a needle shoved through it. Barron was very knowledgeable and was able to make me feel as comfortable as possible. It’s pricey but 115% worth it. They jewelry is beautiful and top notch and the piercers are professional and you know you can trust you’ll get exactly what you envisioned.\n\n- Katrina Breeden\n\nI needed new jewelry for my rooks and to have them changed. I bought rose gold loops that are very pretty. Tyler Bernard switched them out for me quickly and easily. Everyone was nice and professional. I will definitely use Born This Way for all piercing needs and will be checking them out in the next few months for a tattoo.\n\n- Kristi Page\n\nI will always recommend Born This Way! I have been to their old location as well as this one most recently, and there is a reason why I chose to come back. Tyler did a piercing for me and was so great at helping me pick out jewelry and explaining the difference between the styles and what they’re made of. He told me step by step how he was going to do the piercing and was very informative before he began which helped calm my nerves. He was so kind and easy to talk to which made the experience so smooth and easy. They know how to have a professional environment while still being laid back and nice to everyone who comes in. I appreciate how serious they take their standards with health and safety as well, I know walking in I will have the highest quality and cleanest piercing out of any studio there is. There really is no comparison, whatever service you need Born This Way will aways rank number one to me.\n\n- Sarah Walker"
