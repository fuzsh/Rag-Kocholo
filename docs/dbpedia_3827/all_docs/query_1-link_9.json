        "meta_description": "Hölder’s review of Robert Graßmann’s Theory of Number provides the first statement of Hölder’s most significant tenets concerning the distinction between the genetic and axiomatic presentation of mathematics, the mature expression of which is found in Hölder’s book The Mathematical Method of 1924. By translating Hölder’s review into English, I hope to make this unique document known to a wider public. In my introductory note I provide some context to Hölder’s paper and a few other remarks concerning the translation work.",

        "text": "2An essential component of this tradition is the quest for restoring the organic unity of the system of mathematics and related to that, the idea that such unity can only be uncovered by examining the specific process of sign-construction involved in producing mathematical knowledge independently of any other disciplines. Such a treatment of mathematics must be reached without presupposing logic, language and, of course, independently of sense experience. Reorganizing the body of mathematical knowledge in accordance with this methodological ideal was the main objective of Robert Graßmann’s mathematical writings. The outcome of this endeavour are found in The Theory of Forms or Mathematics (Die Formenlehre oder Mathematik) published in 1872 and in the Theory of number (Die Zahlenlehre oder Arithmetik)published in 1891.\n\n4Be this as it may, Hölder used the Review as an opportunity of presenting his own ideas concerning the foundations of mathematics. Hölder’s Review is the expression of the clash between the genetic and the axiomatic method in dealing with the foundations of mathematics, a long time before David Hilbert’s discussion of the distinction and the debate triggered by Hilbert’s position were published. Hölder’s discussion of the distinction provided in the Review contains a series of remarkable considerations about things like the relationship between existence and consistency in mathematics and about the general requirements that should be met by an axiomatic approach to the foundations of pure mathematics. It also contains some important remarks about the relationship between logic, proof, and arithmetic.\n\n5Hölder basically argues that Graßmann’s conception can be given both a formal-axiomatic as well as a genetic interpretation. Hölder raises a series of objections to the former and endorses the latter. In a sense, Hölder’s Review is less a confrontation with Robert Graßmann. It is rather an outline of Hölder’s own conception of axiomatics, of its proper place and limits in dealing with the foundations of mathematics. Hölder’s Review is the first statement of an original critical philosophy of mathematics whose mature expression enfolded in a series of subsequent writings.\n\n6One difficulty in truly appreciating Hölder’s ideas is caused by the style of the Review. In the Review one often finds only short fragments, hints, and allusions, where more elaborate explanations would have been needed. The other difficulty is linked to the fact that, in a sense, the Review requires a reader, familiar with the broad tenets of Robert Graßmann’s work. In some cases I have included Hölder’s original terminology in German along with the English translation. In all these cases I preserved the orthography found in the German original document, which in many cases differs from modern German orthography.\n\n7In order to render the significance of some of Hölder’s statements clearer, I have included a series of footnotes in which I provide some context to Hölder’s statements. The notes at the end of the document belong to Hölder."
