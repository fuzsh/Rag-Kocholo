Though, John Otto is an interesting and strong character. Alan's book is excellent. I think Amazon would be the easiest place to purchase. Grand Junction bookstores have them in stock, perhaps other Colorado and maybe Utah stores would as well.\n\nBrian C - Aug 15, 2010 12:18 pm - Voted 10/10\n\nGo John Otto!\n\nI am from Junction originally and have also quested after some of Otto's routes. It really is amazing what he accomplished on the Monument. I am definitely going to have to check out window pane arch now. I've hiked all of no thoroughfare a few times and never noticed it. Thanks for the nice write up!\n\nseth@LOKI - Aug 16, 2010 12:56 am - Hasn't voted\n\nRe: Go John Otto!\n\nthanks for noticing and encouragement. I sometimes hope that there is a grander meaning for \"our\" valley than just the Junction of two rivers...\n\nCome back by and visit sometime, I wrote my account of the Window Pane Arch last fall... basically turn right just above the first high falls. Go up the drainage to near its end and get up in the major \"cleft\" in the right or north wall of the upper canyon.\n\nTrailingOtto - Aug 18, 2010 12:42 pm - Hasn't voted\n\nTrailing Otto\n\nSeth, It's good to see you're using your down time to do some writing, I hope you're healing well. Thanks for promoting America's Greatest Folk Hero, John Otto. The Legacy of John Otto is too big to be ignored and too true to be turned into a mere legend. PBS is working on a documentary that will be out in the Fall. At www.JohnOtto.org people can tune in to see events going on to explore John Otto in the Monument in 2010. We are identifying \"Ottofacts\" of John's that are still visible along trails and in the red rock canyon walls. I would definitely recommend Alan J Kanias books www.JohnOttoBook.com.\n\nLook forward to seeing you back out in the canyons soon Seth.\n\nseth@LOKI - Aug 31, 2010 4:03 pm - Hasn't voted\n\nRe: Trailing Otto\n\nYeah!!! I just tried to get Ken Burn's group to cooperate / get involved with involved / Nat Geo channel and or A&E affiliates to tell John Otto's heroic story. I got the fastest blow-off in years... too busy to even look into it- I look forward to seeing PBS's John Otto story!\n\nseth@LOKI - Dec 21, 2010 2:45 pm - Hasn't voted\n\nCCC above Monument Canyon TH\n\nRanger Bill Rogers suggested to me that a huge CCC camp was along the Black Ridge Trail just above the TH shared with upper Monument Canyon TH. The Rim Rock road is closed from upper Liberty Cap TH to Monument View, so a scenic walk would be required until March to see the area. There may be some car carcasses, perhaps some outlines of the walls. I didn't see much in the area but I didn't investigate long. Good luck!"
