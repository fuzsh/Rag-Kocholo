        "text": "Shortly after World War I, interest in school bands and orchestras and the need for trained teachers and directors for such organizations, created the demand for a special course of study to prepare for this work. For several years this work was given by individual lessons, but in 1926 classes in various subjects were organized.\n\nBy 1927, more space was needed and VanderCook purchased a large brownstone residence at 1655 Washington Blvd. (and Paulina), later adding adjacent buildings at 1653 and 1657 Washington Blvd. Students took required academic and education courses at nearby Lewis Institute. The root of the relationship between VanderCook (the school) and the Lewis Institute (later Illinois Institute of Technology) was the close friendship between Hale A. VanderCook and George L. Tenney, better known as “Doc” Tenney. “Doc” taught vocal music at the Lewis Institute and directed choirs in some of the largest churches in the Chicago area.\n\n“There was no indication that Mr. Van’s house was a school except for the noise, and the neighbors didn’t like the school because of the noise. So one summer, … the neighbors put a laughing record and record player in a window next door, and this thing laughed all day. One day a friend came to see me, and when I came down from class to talk with him he said, ‘What kind of crazy place is this?’ Mrs. VanderCook had a parrot that was talking, somebody was playing a saxophone upstairs, the directing class was going, ‘One, pum, pum, zing,’ and this laughing record was going at the same time. My friend thought it completely crazy.”\n\n— interview with John Beckerman, past president of VanderCook College of Music\n\nThen in 1928 the school was incorporated as a non-profit teacher training institution under the Illinois State laws and its curriculum approved by the Board of Examiners of the Illinois State Department of Public Instruction. Graduates therefore obtained certificates to teach bands and orchestras in the public schools without examination. By now the school was known as VanderCook School of Music.\n\nThe first class to complete the approved four-year course of study for the Bachelor of Music Education degree graduated at the summer session of 1931. Members of that class, all prominent teachers, were John H. Beckerman, Clarence F. Gates, Clifford P. Lillya, Hubert E. Nutt, William D. Revelli and Otto Uttke.\n\nAfter Lewis Institute merged with Armour Institute to form the Illinois Institute of Technology at 33rd and Federal Streets, VanderCook School of Music was urged to move closer to the II.T. campus to continue the relationship it had fostered with the Lewis Institute. In 1953, a building site on Michigan Avenue, across the street from the IIT dormitory area was purchased. In 1954, a large residence at 3219 South Michigan Avenue was purchased and VanderCook moved to the new location. During this time the school changed its name to VanderCook College of Music.\n\nIn August, 1960, after several years of planning and fundraising, construction on a new building began. This building, located at 3209 South Michigan Avenue, housed an auditorium, practice rooms, lounges, heating plant, storage, classrooms, offices and library. H.E. Nutt, co-founder of VanderCook College of Music, lived in the building until close to his death in 1981."
