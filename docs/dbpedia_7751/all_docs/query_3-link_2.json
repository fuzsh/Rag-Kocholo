She chose to attend Chicago-Kent College of Law out of many other law schools because it was the most technologically-advanced law school in the nation and also had a very large APALSA chapter, which was unique in the Midwest. She was able to excel at Chicago-Kent despite a very personal tragedy at the start of her law school career when her mother passed away right before her first semester exams. Everyone was kind and welcoming at Illinois Tech, and she also had exposure and opportunities to cutting-edge legal theories being developed for technological and medical science advancements.\n\nShaw received her bachelor’s degree in marketing from DePaul University and her juris doctor degree from Chicago-Kent College of Law.\n\nShaw states that she is deeply honored and humbled to be recognized by her alma mater and receive this prestigious award.
