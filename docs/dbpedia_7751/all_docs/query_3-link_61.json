        "text": "Introduction\n\nChicago-Kent College of Law at Illinois Institute of Technology is distinguished by its history of excellence in teaching and legal scholarship. Its faculty is one of the most productive groups of legal scholars in the country, publishing leading texts and articles across a wide array of subjects.\n\nThe Chicago-Kent curriculum emphasizes professional responsibility in the broadest sense, encompassing intellectual discipline, careful analysis, comprehensive research, and sensitivity to the needs of clients and to the context in which the law operates. Drawing on its distinctive affiliation with Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago-Kent is at the vanguard of exploring new frontiers in the law raised by biotechnology, cyberspace, environmental regulation, intellectual property, international business transactions and trade, and much more. Chicago-Kent is located in downtown Chicago, the heart of the city’s commercial and legal communities. The law school is within walking distance of one of the world’s largest integrated court systems and a full range of city, county, state, and federal agencies, as well as Chicago’s famous financial center. The law school is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and the Order of the Coif.\n\nPhysical Facilities\n\nChicago-Kent’s modern, 10-story building features a three-story atrium, three-level library, technologically advanced classrooms and courtrooms, an auditorium, student lounges, and a cafeteria. A game room on the fifth floor gives students a comfortable place to relax and enjoy a wide variety of board and table games.\n\nChicago-Kent has an outstanding collection of library materials related to law, business, and international relations. Through the library’s website, students have direct access to more than 170 database collections and electronic journals. The library offers group study rooms for collaborative work and features a reading room on the 10th floor, which is a modern interpretation of a traditional 19th-century reading room. Balconies on the 9th and 10th floors of the library provide an opportunity to study outdoors and enjoy views of the city. Puzzles, chess games, and art books provide an opportunity to relax during study breaks.\n\nChicago-Kent’s courtrooms are among the best trial advocacy training facilities in the nation and set the stage for the law school’s hands-on litigation technology course. The Abraham Lincoln Marovitz Courtroom, named for one of our most distinguished alumni and the former senior judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, is a teaching facility as well as a working courtroom. The Bruce M. Kohen Courtroom, named for an acclaimed alumnus and litigator, incorporates emerging computer and audiovisual technologies, including 90-inch video walls and document cameras.\n\nHousing\n\nAffordable housing is available in nearby urban and suburban neighborhoods. Dormitory housing is available on the university’s main campus, approximately five miles south of the law school. A free shuttle runs between the two campuses. The law school is close to all public transportation downtown.\n\nLLM Programs/Areas of Specialization\n\nFamily Law\n\nThe LLM Program in Family Law is designed to equip graduates for practice in the increasingly sophisticated and rapidly evolving field of family law. This program offers a unique mixture of cutting-edge practice training and legal theory to prepare students for a variety of family law-related careers.\n\nFamily law is unique in modern law practice because it remains a general practice career. Beyond basic divorce and family law, practitioners must know tax law, real estate law, partnership law, contract law, child psychology, and other topics. As each of these sub-areas has ballooned, so has the expertise that a family law practitioner must bring to his or her practice. Effective education in both the technique and substance of modern family law practice is necessary for success in this competitive, dynamic field. Chicago-Kent’s LLM in Family Law provides this education.\n\nCandidates for admission to the LLM Program in Family Law may apply at any time, but are encouraged to submit application materials by early July for the fall semester and by mid-November for the spring semester. Applications are available from the Office of Graduate Admissions or online at the Graduate Program in Family Law website.\n\nStudents wishing to take one or more courses in the program without becoming candidates for the LLM degree may do so with permission. Students may be eligible for CLE credit based upon their LLM coursework.\n\nApplication Requirements (Degree-Seeking)\n\napplication for admission\n\n$60 application fee\n\npersonal statement\n\nrésumé\n\nofficial law school transcript\n\nApplication Requirements (Nonmatriculant)\n\napplication for nonmatriculant admission\n\n$60 application fee\n\nrésumé\n\nofficial law school transcript\n\nTuition\n\nTuition and Fees\n\nDegree Requirements\n\n24 credit hours of coursework, including an externship requirement of at least 9 credit hours (Part-time students may not have to complete the externship.)\n\nContact Information\n\nOffice of Graduate Admissions\n\nChicago-Kent College of Law\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology\n\n565 West Adams Street\n\nChicago, IL 60661-3691\n\nUSA\n\nPhone: 312.906.5360\n\nFax: 312.906.5274\n\nEmail: admissions@kentlaw.iit.edu\n\nWebsite: www.kentlaw.iit.edu/prospective-students/llm-family-law\n\nFinancial Services Law\n\nDeregulation of financial services, tax reforms, globalization, technology, the financial crisis beginning in 2008, and revolutionary market forces have created an environment in which attorneys must broaden their knowledge and sharpen their skills to handle the range of legal and related issues arising in the new and evolving financial services industry. Chicago-Kent’s innovative and unique LLM Program in Financial Services Law educates legal professionals to be effective in this rapidly changing environment. It emphasizes the global nature of financial markets and takes advantage of Chicago’s location as a critical node in the global financial services industry.\n\nCandidates for admission to the LLM Program in Financial Services Law must hold a JD, LLB, or other non-US first law degree. Domestic students may begin in either the fall or spring semester. International students may only begin in the fall semester. Students may pursue the degree on either a full- or part-time basis. The suggested application deadline for fall admission is February 1.

Chicago-Kent is nationally recognized as a leader in the fields of both international law and intellectual property law, and the law school’s faculty, students, and graduates are helping define IP law for the 21st century through their research and scholarship.\n\nAs the importance of IP law has expanded nationally and internationally, the program has grown to reflect and anticipate the constant challenges of contemporary IP practice. Whether your interests lie in scientific and technological innovation, marketing and advertising, or entertainment and the arts, Chicago-Kent’s Program in International Intellectual Property Law offers an educational experience that emphasizes both academic excellence and a commitment to training the top IP lawyers and thinkers of tomorrow.\n\nStudents enrolled in the program attend courses and seminars with JD students and can take advantage of the school’s cutting-edge expertise in such areas as information technology law, e-commerce, and corporate and financial services law. They also receive personalized instruction in a graduate thesis-writing course limited to students in the program. The one-year, full-time program offers students the flexibility to choose particular courses of interest as well as the rigor of a directed writing requirement.\n\nCandidates for admission to the LLM Program in International Intellectual Property Law must hold a JD, LLB, or other non-US first law degree.

The program, created and taught by full-time tax attorneys who are partners in major law firms and leaders of the national tax bar, takes a rigorous in-class approach to the problems that tax practitioners confront on a daily basis. The program is designed to meet the needs of students seeking the best theoretical and practical graduate tax education. Each course is structured to immerse students in the theory, analysis, and planning that real-world tax practice demands.\n\nThe program has benefited from significant contributions of time and resources by leading members of the tax bar. The Graduate Program in Taxation Advisory Board, which oversees the tax program, includes Chicago’s most respected tax lawyers.\n\nApplicants for admission to the LLM Program in Taxation may apply at any time, but are encouraged to submit application materials as early as possible in the summer for fall-semester matriculation and in the fall for spring-semester matriculation. Candidates for admission to the LLM Program in Taxation must hold a JD from an ABA-accredited law school. In special circumstances, international students may be considered for admission if they hold a JD, LLB, or other non-US first law degree. However, international applicants should be aware that the program focuses primarily on US tax law. Applications are available from the Office of Graduate Admissions or online at the Graduate Program in Taxation website.\n\nStudents wishing to take one or more courses in the program without becoming candidates for the LLM degree may do so with permission.

Chicago-Kent’s reputation in trial advocacy as well as its physical location in Chicago provides a distinctive master’s degree in trial advocacy in a world-class setting.\n\nCandidates for admission to the LLM in Trial Advocacy must have completed their basic legal preparatory studies outside of the United States.

Available resources include individual counseling, résumé and cover letter reviews, mock interviews, career awareness programs, a job-posting service, and a well-stocked resource center.\n\nThe Career Services Office also works closely with the Office of Alumni Relations to introduce students to alumni in the Chicago area and beyond.
