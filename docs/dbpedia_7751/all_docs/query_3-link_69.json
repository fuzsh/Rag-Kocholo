        "text": "Academics\n\nThe Stuart School of Business at Chicago’s Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) recognizes the diverse needs of its students and “focuses on innovation” in order to accommodate them all. While the full-time MBA is typically completed over three years, working professionals with a minimum of five years of work experience that are looking to expedite their MBAs can enroll in the school’s part-time Accelerated MBA. Those who want to pursue their degrees while continuing to work can take their MBA part-time in the evenings at the Downtown campus.\n\nWith Illinois Tech’s small cohorts, there is no crowding in the school’s computer labs or the “vast library,” which offers a “very huge online research library and article access and excellent infrastructure.” For many, though, “the school’s greatest strength is its strategic location,” as downtown Chicago is “an amazing place to study and grants access to businesses around the school and access to socialize, not only with fellow students, but with professionals in the vicinity.” About the only weakness here, students tell us, is that “the school should do more marketing of itself, and Career Services should do more on its networking with employers.”"
