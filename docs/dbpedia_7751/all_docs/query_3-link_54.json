        "text": "ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n1. Important\n\nPlease read these conditions carefully as they shall form part of the contract between the person responsible for the fees and CEG Pathways Inc. (“CEG”). It is important that you make sure that you have read and understood all of these conditions as you will be deemed to accept these conditions when you sign the application form.\n\n2. Application\n\nThese terms have been sent to you as part of the application process and set out important information detailing the tuition, fees and the deposit payable that will be required to guarantee your place at CEG.\n\n3. Deposit payment\n\nTo accept your offer, you or your sponsor will be required to pay the deposit and registration fee (together the “Deposit”), stated on your offer letter, such amount to be paid to CEG. Acceptance of a CEG offer on payment of the minimum stated Deposit constitutes a binding contract between the student and CEG.\n\nThe Deposit may be non-refundable in whole or part (less the registration fee) depending on the application of the refund policy set out below. In any event, the Deposit will be set in equal parts against the Tuition and other fees of the first and second semester of your program.\n\nIf, in error, you pay CEG any fees other than the Deposit, such as tuition, accommodation or other non-Deposit related fees, those fees will be passed to Illinois Tech by us and we will notify you accordingly.\n\n4. Acceptance of your place\n\nOnce your required Deposit and registration fee is paid to CEG and upon you meeting all the conditions in your offer letter, we will confirm your place on the Program and send you the official acceptance letter and i20 form necessary to obtain your student visa. You will need to be careful with this letter as Illinois Tech may levy a charge for the issuing of any replacement i20 letter.\n\n5. Payment of fees\n\nDEPOSIT:\n\nPlease only pay CEG the Deposit payment, using the bank details set out below:\n\nBank Name: Citizens Bank, N.A. Address: 1 Citizens Drive, Riverside, Rhode Island 02915 Account Number 1400814674 S.W.I.F.T code CTZIUS33 ABA number 011500120 Account Name CEG Pathways Inc ACH (cheques): 211070175\n\nFlywire payments can be made here: Visit site\n\nTuition and Accommodation\n\nYou must pay all tuition and accommodation fees promptly on receipt of such invoice and directly to Illinois Tech using the methods explained in this link: https://web.iit.edu/student-accounting/payments/payment-methods\n\nUnder Illinois Tech’s terms, any student who fails to settle all outstanding balances once invoiced is at risk of losing their entitlement to continue their semester's course schedule and if applicable, housing assignment. They may also be charged interest on outstanding amounts. Additionally, you may not be able to join/continue in the subsequent semester; participate in student activities, including athletics; utilize campus facilities, such as the Fitness Centre; obtain transcript services; receive grade reports; or receive a degree.\n\nYou are responsible for any collection costs incurred by Illinois Tech in collecting any outstanding balance(s). Students must be in good financial standing to participate in any Illinois Tech programs or activities, including, but not limited to athletics, resident assistant programs, student government, and clubs. To be in good financial standing, a student must have settled their student accounts for all balances currently due.\n\n6. Academic conditions of entry and continued enrolment\n\nStudents are admitted to CEG programs on the basis of English language proficiency and academic ability, and in some cases, on the additional basis of experiential learning.\n\nAny student found to have misled CEG as to their qualifications and suitability for entry could be subject to expulsion from CEG without recourse to refund of tuition and fees already paid, and be liable for any required notice periods. However, in limited circumstances, should an alternative program be more suitable and if appropriate, a student may be transferred to an alternative program, however this may also require changes to your visa status which may need to be communicated to the U.S. immigration authorities.\n\nStudents are expected to attend all classes and lectures, and will be subject to assessment by means of coursework and other continuous assessment methods and by examination. In order to progress though the program of study and to subsequent courses offered by the collaborating institution, students are required to meet prescribed academic and English language standards at certain stages.\n\nStudents at Illinois Tech are expected to abide to the full rules and regulations in the University handbook:\n\nView handbook\n\n7. Visa Compliance and Conduct\n\nPrior to enrollment at Illinois Tech, it is your responsibility to ensure you have a correct and valid visa document stamped in your passport. CEG will check this at least every 12 months. On application to CEG you will be required to provide details of any previous visas received or refusals of entry to to the United States of America, together with information about the level and content of any prior studies undertaken in the USA, as this is an immigration requirement before we can sponsor any student.\n\nAttendance is monitored by using an overall percentage and by ‘Contact Points’ and students are required to maintain appropriate levels of attendance and may be subject to expulsion, should this fall below an acceptable level.\n\nCEG reserves the right to impose sanctions including, but not limited to, termination of the enrolment of any student whose standard of conduct is unsatisfactory. There will be no refund of tuition and fees in cases of expulsion due to misconduct.\n\nAny students withdrawing from a CEG program of study may be reported to the U.S. immigration authorities and U.S. Embassy/High Commission in their home country as a curtailment of their program. Any student withdrawing will be required to provide documentary evidence of their return to their home country or transfer to another institution.\n\n8. CEG Refund policy\n\nShould you be refused a visa, evidence of refusal and a written application to withdraw must be made available to CEG before any refund can be initiated, if appropriate.\n\nCEG will verify the authenticity of the evidence of visa refusal with the appropriate U.S. overseas posting (Embassy/High Commission), and will charge an administration fee of $300 in the event of such a refund.\n\nTuition and fees (but not the Deposit) are subject to Illinois Tech’s refund policy, set out below.\n\nCEG/ Illinois Tech reserves the right to withdraw a previously available program of study at its own discretion. In such a scenario and where a student is unable to enrol in a similar program with Illinois Tech, then the Deposit will be refunded by CEG and you should contact Illinois Tech in relation to any fee you have paid to it.\n\n9. Illinois Tech Refund policy\n\nIllinois Tech has its own refund policy for refunds on tuition, housing and meals, and other student fees, which you can find at the below link. This refund policy will apply only to any payment that have been paid directly to Illinois Tech:\n\nVisit link\n\n10. Cause for concern\n\nShould we have reason to be concerned for the health, welfare, financial situation, fitness to study, or academic progress of any student, whether under or over 18 years of age, CEG reserves the right to involve parents, agents or appropriate professionals to offer support.\n\n11. Deferment\n\nHolders of a CEG offer may be able to, on written request to CEG, defer the start of their program of study up to a maximum of one academic year.\n\nIf you do defer your start date, any Deposit paid to CEG will be held (without penalty), for use against the subsequent deferred course of study. Should you (the offer holder), subsequently withdraw after a deferment has been applied, the Deposit held would normally be refunded but may become non-refundable in exceptional circumstances.\n\nAs an immigration requirement, the U.S. immigration authorities will be informed of any students holding an i20 visa letter and wishing to defer.\n\n12. Data protection\n\nTo comply with the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the information which you give on your form will be used for the following purposes:\n\nTo determine your eligibility for entry to CEG and/or entry to the host partner university.\n\nTo enable CEG and the host partner university to compile statistical reports.\n\nTo enable CEG and the host partner university to initiate your student record.\n\nTo share information with other government departments (e.g. immigration office), local authorities and other bodies to prevent possible fraud and to enable them to carry out their functions. On enrolment, students will be asked to sign a consent form for specific use of their personal data.\n\nTo protect the personal data of individuals normally resident in the EU, CEG will comply with General Data Protection Regulations and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.

Variation of Conditions\n\nCEG may, by written notice, vary conditions of enrolment as may be necessary to comply with any law, regulations or amendment thereof, of the Government of the United States. CEG additionally reserves the right, upon giving one term’s written notice of such change to all affected students, parents, guardians and sponsors, to make any addition, amendment or alteration to these conditions as is deemed necessary by CEG.\n\n15.
