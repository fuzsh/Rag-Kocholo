        "text": "Illinois Tech was looking for a way to make it easier for students to register for admissions events while improving the back-end user experience for admissions counselors so they could make internal processes easier, faster, and more efficient.\n\nAs Illinois Tech brought some events back on-campus they needed to consider how they could send reminders to students to submit negative Covid tests before their arrival on campus, and how they could limit the number of people attending certain events due to covid restrictions. Using Gecko, Illinois Tech ensured all processes and data lived in one central location within the Gecko platform so when prospective students arrived on campus, they were ensured a great experience.\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe inform you that this site uses own, technical and third parties cookies to make sure our web page is user-friendly and to guarantee a high functionality of the webpage.
