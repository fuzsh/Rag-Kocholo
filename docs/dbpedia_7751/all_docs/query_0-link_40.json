        "text": "THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Engineering\n\nInstitute of Medicine\n\nNational Research Council\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts is president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. William A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts and Dr. William A. Wulf are chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.\n\nPreface\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn the spring of 1998, Congress conducted hearings on the needs of U.S. industry for high-technology workers. A primary impetus for these hearings was the insistence of information technology industry representatives that companies were unable to recruit sufficient domestic workers and needed to hire additional non-U.S. citizens. Several recent studies supported the industry position. Most notably, a 1997 Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) study estimated a shortage of 340,000 workers in the field of information technology.1 In September of 1997 the Department of Commerce released a report concluding that there was a shortage of information technology workers. 2 This conclusion was based on projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that the United States would require more than 1 million additional information technology workers between 1994 and 2005, compared to the small number of U.S. bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences awarded annually (24,553 in 1994).\n\nIn response to the perceived shortage of high-technology workers, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate (H.R. 3736, S. 1723) to\n\nincrease the number of H-1B visas from the FY1998 level of 65,000 per year. After considerable debate, the resulting legislation (Public Law 105-277) increased the limit on H-1B visas temporarily (to 115,000 in FY1999 and FY2000, 107,500 in FY2001, and reverting to 65,000 in FY2002).\n\nMeanwhile, some experts asserted that the methodology of the ITAA survey was flawed and exaggerated the need for information technology workers. An analysis done by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in March 1998 found methodological weaknesses in the Department of Commerce report, emphasizing that the relevant supply of talent is not limited to computer science graduates.3 The GAO found that only 29 percent of information technology workers have degrees in computer science and that the majority of jobs in information technology are held by persons with degrees in math, science, social science, and business. More than 800,000 people graduate with math and science degrees (B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.) per year.\n\nWhen Congress passed Public Law 105-277, it included a section (Section 417) that called for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enter into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to report on older workers in the information technology field. Section 418 of that law called on the NSF to report on high-technology labor market needs. Both studies were to be delivered to Congress by October 1, 2000.\n\nBecause of the overlap between these subjects, the National Science Foundation asked the National Academy of Sciences, and specifically, the National Research Council (NRC), to conduct a study of needs for a high-technology workforce over the next 10 years, focusing on information technology (IT) and providing broad though less detailed contrast with biotechnology as the other key dimension of high technology with respect to workforce issues.4 In addition, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, concerned about the future availability of technically skilled workers to support the nation's space objectives and industrial base, provided support for this study.\n\nWithin the National Research Council, four units collaborated in conducting the project. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) led the effort, joined by the Board on Testing and Assessment, the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy, and the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel.\n\nThe study was structured to provide an integrated response to sections 417 and 418 (a) of PL 105-277 (see Box P.1); the former calls for an assessment of the status of older workers using the best available data, and the latter calls for an assessment of labor market needs for workers with high-technology skills over the next 10 years. The section 418 (a) (3) requirement for diverse inputs comports naturally with the NRC study process, which emphasizes a balanced study committee plus broad solicitation of inputs. In particular, the NRC sought to develop an integrated analytical perspective that would combine the perspectives of labor economists with those familiar with the issues at “ground level”—people performing or managing information technology work and people involved in the education and training of information technology workers.\n\nBy any standard, the story of IT and the economy is one of success. But against this background of success, concerns have emerged that the lack of an adequate, well-trained workforce may have negative effects on the U.S. economy. Furthermore, because the underlying information technologies change so rapidly, there is concern that the labor market does not work as efficiently in this arena as economic theory would predict—i.e., that rising wages will not relieve the tightness, at least not “in time.” Finally, there are concerns that the benefits of employment in information technology or high technology are not being shared equitably.\n\nAUDIENCE AND TIMING\n\nThe Committee on Workforce Needs in Information Technology (Appendix C) is well aware that during the time that it was collecting information and deliberating, the political process moved forward. Indeed, the committee anticipated the legislation that was enacted in October 2000 at about the time its report was first made available. This timing raised questions about when to release the report.\n\nThe committee notes that its charge did not focus on the H-1B visa issue; rather, the controversy surrounding this issue provided one element of the context surrounding its work. Although the H-1B visa cap is one of the most hotly contested issues in immigration policy today, it is only one of the issues facing the IT and high-technology (IT/HT) workforce. This report is not—and never has been—a report only or even primarily about H-1B visas.\n\nMore importantly, the committee has tried in this report to provide a way of thinking about workforce issues in IT/HT that is largely independent of specific legislation. It seems safe to predict that the debate over the IT/HT workforce and immigration will not be definitively resolved by any one piece of legislation—such is the nature of controversial issues engaged by the political process. The committee thus tried to develop an intellectual framework and policy guidance for meeting the nation's needs for information technology workers over the next decade.\n\nIn the months since the report's initial release in October 2000, declines in stock valuation for IT and IT-enabled companies, together with well-publicized bankruptcies and layoffs, have affirmed the wisdom of the committee's longer-term horizon.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND CAVEATS\n\nA number of prior studies and analyses of workforce issues in IT constituted the committee's point of departure for its own work. In addition, the committee also heard from many stakeholders across a wide range of perspectives, commissioned a number of papers, sought and received white papers and other input electronically, and conducted sev-\n\neral site visits to IT-sector firms. The report also draws insights from committee members most closely associated with IT.\n\nOne of the most troublesome aspects of the debate over workforce issues is the paucity of good data. Reliable, representative, timely “hard data” are by far the most preferred as the basis for reaching conclusions. But in practice, the available data are inadequate as a basis for drawing conclusions that are unambiguous.5\n\nThe committee did not limit itself to considering only those issues for which good-quality and timely data sets were available; to do so would have led to analytical paralysis. Rather, the committee used the best available data, and it relied on testimony and informed speculation when the data were unavailable or inadequate. Its findings, conclusions, and recommendations are based on a mix of data and committee judgment.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nMany people contributed to this complex study and comprehensive report. The committee took testimony from many individuals at its plenary sessions, including both scheduled briefers and IT workers who were promised anonymity. The committee is indebted to these people for sharing with it their ideas, concerns, time, and facilities. It also appreciates having received numerous formal and informal analyses and reports from a wide range of organizations and individuals with varying perspectives on the IT workforce. Subcommittees also held regional information-gathering sessions, and site visits were conducted in New York City; Austin, Texas; Bellevue, Washington; and Fairfax, Virginia. (Appendix D indicates the dates and locations of the plenary and regional meetings and lists the individuals who participated.)\n\nFor helping to organize the Austin events, the committee is indebted to Robert Glover, research scientist in the Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources at the University of Texas at Austin; Mary Jo Sanna, project director of Computer Science 2000 at the Capital Area TechPrep Consortium; Craig Eissler, from the Capital Area Training Foundation; and David Brant, associate vice president for research at the University of Texas at Austin. The committee also acknowledges management\n\nand staff at Trilogy Software, BMC Software, and Academic Software for agreeing to participate in focus group sessions with the Austin subcommittee and for speaking with the subcommittee on the challenges and opportunities of working in the high-tech industry.\n\nIn Seattle, the committee was assisted by Edward Lazowska, professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington and a member of CSTB. (Kathleen) Kay Williams, manager of computing skills management information services for the Boeing Company, and Gary Jackson, co-director of the International Association of Machinists/Boeing Company Joint Quality Through Training Program, facilitated focus group sessions with high-technology managers and workers at their respective companies.\n\nIn Fairfax, the committee met at George Mason University and appreciates the assistance of J. Thomas Hennessy, Jr., chief of staff to the president, and Darcy Cors, assistant to the president. Supporting the committee's site visits and focus group meetings were Sue Austin and Kerri Morehart of SRA International Inc., Mike Mendler of SAIC, Sudhaker Shenoy of IMC, (Lorraine) Pat Sherod of Litton PRC, and Rosanne Cuttitta of Celera Genomics.\n\nA number of individuals responded to the committee's call for white papers, including Denise Gurer (3Com Inc.), Joyce Malyn-Smith (Education Development Center Inc.), Eric Roberts (Stanford University), David Lee (Suffolk University), and B. Lindsay Lowell and Susan Martin (Georgetown University). In addition, the committee commissioned a number of papers on its own initiative and received papers from Hal Salzman, Hal Salzman and Radha Roy Biswas (University of Massachusetts-Lowell), Charles Starliper, Kevin Murphy and Zinta Byrne (Colorado State University), and Robert Lerman (American University).\n\nThe National Science Foundation provided the committee with important data on IT workers and other scientific and engineering personnel. While the committee appreciates NSF assistance in this matter, the use of NSF data does not imply NSF endorsement of the research methods or conclusions contained in this report. In addition, the committee gratefully acknowledges Mark Regets, senior analyst for NSF, for the administrative and data-related assistance he provided on numerous occasions.\n\nThe committee also appreciates the hundreds of suggestions and constructive criticisms provided by the reviewers of an early draft of this report. That input helped the committee to sharpen its message and strengthen its presentation.\n\nWithin the NRC, the lead unit on the project was the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board. However, the committee received a high level of support from members and staff of the three other NRC"
