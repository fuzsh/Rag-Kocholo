        "text": "Welcome to College Results!\n\nCollege Results (CR) is an interactive, user-friendly web tool designed to provide policymakers, counselors, parents, students, and others with information for nearly every four-year university in the country.\n\nThe Education Trust updated this database in July 2022 (CR20). College Results include admission rates, graduation rates, student demographics, and other critical student data for the 2019-2020 academic year.\n\nMore About This Tool\n\nCR allows users to:\n\nExamine colleges' graduation rates, and see how those rates have changed over time.\n\nCompare graduation rates of similar colleges serving similar students.\n\nLearn about colleges' track records in graduating diverse groups of students.\n\nThis information reveals that some colleges do a much better job of graduating students than others. It also shows that at many colleges, significant gaps exist in graduation rates between white students and students of color. But it also provides powerful examples of colleges that prove that low graduation rates - especially for diverse students - are not inevitable."
