        "text": "8-10-2012  Graduate students Zach Szpiech and Chaolong Wang have successfully defended their PhD dissertations in bioinformatics!\n\nChaolong, Noah, and Zach at the University of Michigan Department of Computational Medicine and Biology, with graduate program director Margit Burmeister and founding center director Gil Omenn\n\nZach's thesis on \"Human migration, population divergence, and the accumulation of deleterious alleles: insights from private genetic variation and whole-exome sequencing\" considers several perspectives on private alleles, including a model of microsatellite private alleles, a method for counting private alleles in uneven samples, and a study of connections among rare, private, and deleterious variants.\n\nChaolong's thesis on \"Statistical methods for analyzing human genetic variation in diverse populations\" considers new approaches for studying spatial population-genetic variation, and develops a new method for circumventing allelic dropout in microsatellite data without requiring replicate genotypes.\n\n6-15-2012  Two recent papers from the lab develop improved methods for estimating species trees from gene trees. In the first paper in the series, Ethan Jewett has developed iGLASS, which improves upon the method known as GLASS.\n\nIn the second paper, Laura Helmkamp and Ethan Jewett have developed three more methods in the same family of approaches: iSD, iSTEAC, and iMAC. Laura and Ethan's paper appears in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology in honor of Simon Tavaré and Mike Waterman."
