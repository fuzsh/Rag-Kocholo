        "text": "Robin conceived of her nonprofit, Kranti, while studying global women’s movements with one of her favorite Illinois Tech professors, Margaret Power, as an undergraduate. Today, Kranti, located in Mumbai, India, empowers young women to become agents of social change. Ranging in age from 12 to 20, the women and girls at Kranti are survivors of human trafficking and daughters of sex workers. Kranti transforms the lives of these women by providing them with housing, mental health counseling, education, and the opportunity to volunteer in their communities. Kranti students have shared their stories across the globe, and Robin has been recognized worldwide. She was a top 10 finalist for the 2016 Global Teacher Prize, known as the Nobel Prize for teaching, and named one of “25 Women Under Age 25 to Watch” by Newsweek."
