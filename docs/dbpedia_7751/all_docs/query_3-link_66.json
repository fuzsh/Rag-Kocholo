        "text": "This guide is designed to answer one question for you: How are you going to afford Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nYou probably know that planning for expenses is an important part of the college application process. What you may not know is how many different things you need to keep track of to pay tuition and apply for financial aid.\n\nHere's what we'll cover:\n\nHow much does Illinois Institute of Technology tuition cost?\n\nHow much financial aid do students at Illinois Institute of Technology usually get?\n\nHow much debt is typical for students at Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nHow much will Illinois Institute of Technology cost YOU, and can you actually afford it?\n\nIs Illinois Institute of Technology a good value for you?\n\nWhat are other schools that might be a better value than Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nBy learning more about expenses and aid, you’re already on the right path to managing college costs. Let’s get started!\n\nSchool location: Chicago, IL\n\nThis school is also known as: IIT\n\nHow Much Does Illinois Institute of Technology Cost?\n\nKnowing what a school costs is Step #1 in managing college costs. There’s more to think about than just the tuition—you also have to factor in where you'll live, what you'll eat, and more while attending Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nThe \"Cost of Attendance\" is the total amount of money the average student has to pay, WITHOUT any financial aid, to attend a particular school. Think of it as a school’s sticker price. It includes not just Illinois Institute of Technology tuition and fees, but also room, board, textbooks, and personal expenses.\n\nHere’s the Cost of Attendance breakdown for Illinois Institute of Technology:\n\nHow Much Financial Aid Do Students at Illinois Institute of Technology Get?\n\nThe Cost of Attendance listed above might be intimidating. The good news is that most students don’t end up paying that full price to attend Illinois Institute of Technology. Financial aid helps make up the difference between the Cost of Attendance and what families can actually afford.\n\nHere we'll cover how many students get Illinois Institute of Technology financial aid, what types of aid they get, and how much.\n\nA Brief Intro to Financial Aid\n\nAid comes in many forms, including:\n\nNeed-based grants\n\nMerit-based scholarships\n\nStudent loans\n\nThis financial aid comes from a few different places:\n\nFederal aid comes from the federal government, or is subsidized by the federal government.\n\nInstitutional aid comes from your school itself.\n\nGenerally, it’s better for MORE students to receive HIGH amounts of financial aid—this means students pay less for college.\n\nLet’s take a look at how Illinois Institute of Technology compares to other schools.\n\nOverall Aid\n\nLet's start with the overall numbers. At Illinois Institute of Technology, we know that:\n\n100% of Students Get ANY Aid\n\nThis is 8% HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 92%.\n\nThis is good news - more students getting financial aid means students at Illinois Institute of Technology are likely getting a pretty good deal on their education. It could also mean the school skews toward lower income students.\n\nNext, we'll look at actual aid amounts and student debt to dig deeper.\n\nGrants and Scholarships\n\nWe’re focusing on grants and scholarships first because they’re the most important forms of financial aid. Grants and scholarships are better than loans because students don’t ever have to pay them back. The more grant/scholarship aid students receive at a particular school, the better off those students are in the long run.\n\nAt Illinois Institute of Technology, we know that:\n\n100% Get ANY Grant Money\n\nThis is 11% HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 89%.\n\nAlthough it’s useful to know how many students get grant aid, it’s also important to know how much grant aid people tend to receive. The bigger the average grant award, the better.\n\nSo how much grant money do students at Illinois Institute of Technology tend to receive?\n\nAverage Grant Award: $28297\n\nThis is $11809 HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $16488.\n\nAltogether, this is great news - at Illinois Institute of Technology, MORE students get financial aid, and each award size is HIGHER. This means students have to rely less on loans to pay for college and will likely graduate with less debt.\n\nHow Generous is Illinois Institute of Technology’s Financial Aid?\n\nThe grant dollar amounts we’ve seen so far have included aid from all sources - both federal and institutional. Schools don’t have much control over how much federal aid students can qualify for (like Pell Grants), but they do their own financial aid dollars and how they’re used.\n\nTo figure out how strong Illinois Institute of Technology’s own financial aid program is, we’ll look at how they award their own (non-federal) financial aid dollars. The more students receive aid directly from the school (otherwise known as institutional aid), and the bigger the award amounts, the better the financial aid program.\n\nLet’s see how generous Illinois Institute of Technology is with its students:\n\n100% Get ANY School Grants\n\nThis is 18% HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 82%.\n\nBecause more Illinois Institute of Technology students get institutional aid, it likely offers relatively competitive financial aid. This means fewer students will need to take out loans to pay for college.\n\nThe amount of money that students actually get is just as important (if not more important) than the percent of students who get grants. If you receive a grant, you’ll want it to be big enough to do you some good.\n\nAverage School Grant: $24488\n\nThis is $10689 HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $13799.\n\nRight away, it seems like Illinois Institute of Technology offers more institutional aid than other schools. On the surface, this can mean that students who do receive institutional grants get a competitive amount, compared to other schools.\n\nOn the other hand, this can also mean that the school just costs more than the typical school of its type. If Illinois Institute of Technology costs more, it makes sense for the average grant award to be higher.\n\nUp to this point, we've looked entirely at grants for Illinois Institute of Technology. Next, we'll do the same analysis for student loans, which is where student debt comes from.\n\nHow Much Debt is Typical for Students at Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nAside from grants, the other major way to pay for college is with student loans. Student loans aren’t free sums of money - you borrow a certain amount to attend Illinois Institute of Technology, and then pay it back with smaller monthly payments after you graduate.\n\nThe more student loan money you borrow, the more debt you’ll end up with after graduation. Ideally, you want to minimize your student debt as much as possible. Less debt means less of a financial burden once you leave school.\n\nIt’s generally a bad sign if a school has many students taking out a lot of loans. This indicates that graduates have to worry about paying back big sums of money once they leave school.\n\nTo address the amount and type of debt that students take on, this section will cover:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFederal Loans\n\nOther Loans\n\nLet’s see what students at Illinois Institute of Technology have to deal with:\n\nLoan Overview\n\nFirst, let’s talk about how many students at Illinois Institute of Technology actually have to take out any student loans at all. The ideal goal is to graduate with little to no debt.\n\nIt’s very common for college grads in the US to graduate with some debt, but high percentages of students taking on loans at a particular school is a big red flag. In contrast, low percentages of students with loans is a sign that Illinois Institute of Technology tuition is affordable.\n\nSo how many students actually end up taking out loans at Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\n50% Have ANY Loans\n\nThis is 16% lower than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 66%.\n\nIt’s a good sign that lower numbers of students take out loans at Illinois Institute of Technology. It doesn’t necessarily mean that students end up with lower amounts of debt - we’ll get to that question very shortly - but it suggests that Illinois Institute of Technology is more affordable for the average student.\n\nNext, we'll look at exactly HOW much debt the average person takes out while in school.\n\nFederal Loans\n\nNow that you have a handle on the basic loan information for Illinois Institute of Technology, we’ll get into some more nitty-gritty information on the types and amounts of loans that students typically have.\n\nWe’ll start with federal loans because, in general, federal loans are preferable to private loans. Federal loans tend to have low interest rates, which means they cost less in the long run. They may come with other perks (like subsidization or even options for loan forgiveness).\n\nHigh percentages or amounts of federal loans still isn’t a great sign - again, you don’t want to see students burdened with too much debt. Generally, schools with strong financial aid programs will have students with more federal loans than private loans.\n\nLet’s see how Illinois Institute of Technology stacks up:\n\n50% Have Federal Loans\n\nAt Illinois Institute of Technology, 50% of all students take out federal loans. This is 15% LOWER than the average percent of students for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 65%.\n\nAverage Federal Loan: $6092\n\nAt Illinois Institute of Technology, the average annual federal loan amount is $6092. This amount is $15 MORE than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $6077.\n\nOther Private Loans\n\nOther loans, or private loans, are the last resource students turn to when paying for college. They’re the least preferable form of financial aid because they have higher interest rates and cost students the most money in the long run.\n\nGenerally, the fewer students who take private loans, and the lower the amount of the loan, the more affordable Illinois Institute of Technology is.\n\nLet’s take a look at the percentage of students at Illinois Institute of Technology with non-federal loans:\n\n5% Have Private Loans\n\nAt Illinois Institute of Technology, 5% of students take out private loans. This is 4% LOWER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is 9%\n\nJust as important as the percentage of students with private loans is the average loan amount. The smaller the average loan amount, the better:\n\nAverage Private Loan: $13027\n\nThe average private loan amount at Illinois Institute of Technology is $13027. This is $1583 HIGHER than the average for Private not-for-profit schools, which is $11444.\n\nThe percentage of students getting federal loans is greater than those getting private loans, which is a good sign. This means lower-interest federal loans are usually enough to pay for Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nWhat Would It Cost YOU to Attend Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nFinally, we get to the bottom line: what will Illinois Institute of Technology actually cost YOU? Every family has a different situation, and depending on your income level, you'll have to pay more or less to go to college.\n\nWhat is Net Price, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nAbove, we've covered Illinois Institute of Technology's Cost of Attendance (tuition, room and board, books, and more). We also covered its typical financial aid in grants, loans, and scholarships.\n\nThe Net Price is the total cost minus the total aid given. In other words, this is the price you have to pay to the school out of pocket. The lower the school's cost, and the more aid you get, the lower the Net Price.\n\nWe'll cover two ways to get your Net Price for Illinois Institute of Technology - the fast way, and the precise way.\n\nNet Price: The Quick and Easy Way\n\nIf you want a quick, general idea of your annual Net Price at Illinois Institute of Technology, here's a handy chart showing the net price of real students. All you need is your family income.\n\nIf your family makes between... Your Net Price will likely be around... $0 - $30,000 $15133 $30,001 - $48,000 $16006 $48,001 - $75,000 $18265 $75,001 - $110,000 $22368 $110,000 and up $26136\n\nNote that these values may be a few years old, and today's prices may be a bit higher.\n\nAs we'll discuss next, your exact Net Price will depend on other factors like the number of family members and total assets, but this represents the typical Net Price.\n\nNet Price: The Most Accurate Method\n\nMost schools have an updated Net Price calculator available. To find it, just google \"Illinois Institute of Technology Net Price Calculator\" - the official tool should be one of the top search results.\n\nOften the school will ask for more information than just income:\n\nThe number of people in your household\n\nThe number of family members in college\n\nParental wages, income, and assets\n\nStudent wages, income, and assets\n\nThis will take 10-15 minutes to complete, and you'll get a specific net price that's more accurate than the table above.\n\nCan You Afford to Attend Illinois Institute of Technology?\n\nOnce you have a Net Price estimate, you’ll want to figure out whether your family can afford to pay Illinois Institute of Technology tuition and costs. Once again, the Net Price is the total cost of attending, minus the aid you can expect to get (grants and scholarships). It's the amount you'd have to cover yourself.\n\nThe US government has come up with a standardized way to calculate how much a typical family can afford to pay without help. They call this the Expected Family Contribution, or EFC.\n\nAs an example, a family that brings home $80,000 in income before taxes, with no assets and no other children in college, has an EFC of around $7,000. This is the amount the government thinks that family can reasonably pay, and the school will have to step in and cover the rest.\n\nColleges use this number as a guideline to decide how much aid to give you, but it's just a guideline. Some schools will be stingier with aid, and you'll have to pay more than the government's suggested EFC.\n\nSo we're going to calculate your EFC and compare it to Illinois Institute of Technology's Net Price. If the Net Price is higher than the EFC, the school will cost more than you can typically afford. It's a simple equation:\n\nNet Price - Expected Family Contribution = Deficit (extra cost you would need to cover)\n\nWe've constructed a simple tool to figure out whether Illinois Institute of Technology is affordable for you:\n\nAffordability Calculator\n\nFinally: Is This Price Really Worth It?\n\nChances are, college won't be cheap. Even if you have a few top choice schools in mind like Illinois Institute of Technology, it's still useful to explore broadly.\n\nA few questions to ponder:\n\nHow much better off will you be if you attend Illinois Institute of Technology as opposed to a similar, but cheaper, school?\n\nHave you considered a range of private and public schools? Big and small?\n\nWhat if you didn't attend college at all? (This is extreme, but just worth considering even for a second.\n\nThese are the big picture questions to consider when we talk about the value of a college education.\n\nHere's our take: college will be a really important stage in your development. Going to a better, more reputable college will usually pay off in the long run. By going to a better college, you'll be surrounded by a more interesting community, find it easier to land a job, and open up opportunities.\n\nTo determine the value of Illinois Institute of Technology, we're going to rely on reputable ranking lists. These consider factors like reputation, student selectivity, income after graduating, and more to determine the value of a school.\n\nValue Judgment\n\nSo how does Illinois Institute of Technology stack up?\n\nWhat Other Schools Should You Consider?\n\nYour next step should be to get a better idea of costs and aid availability at similar schools. If you’re interested in Illinois Institute of Technology, you should check out some other high-value schools that could give you more bang for your buck. Get started here to check both in-state and out-of-state schools that might provide a better value.\n\nBetter Value Schools\n\nFinally, we're going to look at schools that might offer a better value than Illinois Institute of Technology. To compile this list, we first find schools at similar academic levels, so you have a similar chance at getting in. Then we select schools that better value for you, by being more affordable or having a higher quality of education"
