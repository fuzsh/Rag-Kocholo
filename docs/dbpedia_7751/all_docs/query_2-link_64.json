        "text": "Dr. Erica Himes\n\nChief of Staff\n\nI grew up on a farm with cows, pigs, horses, cats, and dogs. My passion for animals started with helping bottle feed calves and piglets and continued to develop with my 1st job at a veterinary clinic as a teenager. I went to undergrad for a wildlife and fisheries degree at Purdue and completed my master’s at Penn State working with black-capped Chickadees. I returned to Purdue after ten years to complete my Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine. I have always loved working with animals, and being in vet med allows me to do so! I have treated everything from a mouse to a black bear in my 20-year career. I plan to continue helping a variety of animals. I enjoy riding my horse, Elvis, and watching my son play sports. My husband and I are foster parents, and our son Seth is active in 4-H. I have 19 years in the military as an Army Veterinarian, traveling worldwide and helping animals and people.\n\nDr. Tom Martin\n\nSenior Associate Veterinarian\n\nDr. Tom Martin grew up on a farm in Eastern Indiana where we raised cattle, hogs, chickens, dogs, and cats. He was a ten-year 4-H member showing cattle all across the Midwest. He even won the “Kindness to Animals” Award in 4-H and has continued to love animals his entire life. Dr. Martin’s graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Purdue University in 1976 and his DVM degree from Purdue in 1980. Dr. Martin has always enjoyed animals & science, and Veterinary medicine combines those two passions perfectly. Dr. Martin & his wife love to entertain at their home, especially Purdue game nights with friends & family. When he is not inside the animal hospital, Dr. Martins loves traveling! He can also be found bicycling and being outdoors. Although he loves being a DVM, being a Grandpa is one of his favorite titles. Dr. Tom Martin has been married to his beautiful wife for 45+ years. They have three sons and four grandchildren. They are also active members of their church.\n\nDr. Sharon O’Dell-Keedy\n\nSenior Associate Veterinarian\n\nSharon O’Dell-Keedy has lived in Crawfordsville her entire life. She would do it repeatedly and recommend that recent graduates settle here after finishing college or schooling. It’s a small town with an amiable vibe and is close enough to Indy and Chicago. Dr. Keedy graduated from Purdue in 1982 and has practiced here since then. She opened Sugar Creek Animal Hospital in 1996. She and her husband, Tom, have three daughters. They now have four grandchildren, which makes life so fun! They are “Gaga and Geeky “to them. They love to travel, camp, and spend time at the beach. When not in Crawfordsville, they will probably be found near Savannah, Georgia, on the beach. They have three dogs: Rip, Faith, and Holly, all rescues. They also have three grand dogs who are all rescues too! Dr. Keedy also has three cats and four chickens which all have names too.\n\nSharon loves veterinary medicine. “Some days I go home and cry while others I am the lucky person that gets to see puppies and kittens.” She says, “The relationships with my pet families and parents are the best. I hope they understand we celebrate with them and hurt with them during the hard times. It’s a joy to practice in Crawfordsville, spoil the grandkids, and sometimes go to the beach. The merger with Family Vet Group has brought us more growth opportunities and allows us to add vets and vet techs to the staff.\n\nI’m looking forward to working in a brand-new state-of-the-art clinic. This is an exciting time!”\n\nDr. Lindsay Reinhart\n\nAssociate Veterinarian\n\nI have loved animals since I was a small child. Losing my first pet to cancer pushed me to pursue a career in Veterinary Medicine. I knew I wanted to treat those who needed help and ease the suffering of those we couldn’t. I received my B.S. from Saint Mary-Of-The-Woods College in 2005 and my DVM from the University of Illinois in 2010. I enjoy getting to meet clients and their furry family members. Each day brings new challenges; no day is the same. I also love that we can help our communities stay safe and healthy with Veterinary Medicine. I enjoy spending time with my husband and kids. I also love gardening and raising chickens. We enjoy showing our chickens, ducks, and cats in 4-H. I am an avid Harry Potter Fan!\n\nDr. Deborah Breitenwischer\n\nAssociate Veterinarian\n\nI’ve always loved animals, but being able to help people by helping their pets makes my job even more special. How blessed we veterinary staff are to be able to do such a job!\n\nIt took me a few tries to get my first vet clinic job in high school. Walking into the clinic and handing them my resume didn’t work. But then I discovered that a classmate had gotten her job there through our school guidance counselor. The next day I knocked on the counselor’s door. Less than two weeks later, I had a job cleaning kennels and walking dogs! I still remember the guidance counselor’s look as she ran down the school hallway looking for me. She seemed so eager and almost panicked with excitement; I was initially afraid something terrible had happened! It wasn’t too long before I was promoted to veterinary assistant. Working here helped me confirm this was what I wanted to do with my life. I stayed at that job through high school and my undergraduate work. Doing my undergrad at IPFW allowed me to get experience working at the office, save money and minimize my debt. Only after my application to vet school was accepted did I transfer to the Purdue campus. I graduated in 2002.\n\nI loved my last employment home and the relationships I built over my 16 years there. I’m hoping at Crawfordsville Family Vet, I have found my next home and a place where I can help make a difference for the pets and people. Outside the office, I love relaxing with friends, yoga, horseback riding, my high-maintenance pets, and a good story in any form (book, play, movie, TV).\n\nLacey Newton\n\nRegistered Veterinary Technician\n\nLacey is a dedicated member of the Crawfordsville Family Vet team, serving as a Registered Veterinary Technician. Her deep-rooted passion for animals has been a lifelong calling, nurtured by her upbringing on a diverse farm with a menagerie of creatures. She is a proud 2022 graduate of IBC and the Vet Tech Institute.\n\nFrom a young age, Lacey knew that her life’s purpose involved working with animals. While her ultimate dream was to become a veterinarian, she decided to explore the world of veterinary technology first. This decision has proven to be a fulfilling one, as she derives immense satisfaction from witnessing challenging cases transform into success stories. Even on the most challenging days, Lacey finds solace in the knowledge that her efforts contribute to the well-being of otherwise helpless animals, a sensation that words can hardly capture.\n\nLacey’s dedication to her role as a Registered Veterinary Technician, her enduring love for animals, and her commitment to making a positive impact in their lives make her an invaluable asset to our team.\n\nBrandi H.\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nMy passion for animals started young from my involvement in 4-H and FFA, where I showed livestock including cows, pigs, horses, and llamas. I have always been a dog and cat lover and continue to be a horse girl. I attended Purdue and majored in Animal Science with a concentration in Animal Agribusiness. Animals have always been a big part of my life, so am=nmial sciences and veterinary medicine as a career path just made sense to me. i find each day very fulfilling to be able to help animals in need and educate owners on the best care and practices for their fur babies.\n\nOutside of work, I like to spend a lot of time with my Corgi, Sterling. You can also find me at the barn working with the family horses or out feeding calves. I also enjoy singing at local karaoke nights around town. My boyfriend and I like to go to local rodeos at PAC Arena on Indianapolis Road (136). I also like to take my dog hiking at Shades State Park.\n\nSamuel L.\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nI have always loved animals of any species. Growing up, we’ve had a few birds, dogs, and, most recently, cats. Some day I would like to own a snake and a gecko. I received my bachelor’s in Public Health from Purdue in December 2020, and I am completing the application process for Vet School. After a couple of semesters pursuing a biology major with a pre-med track for anesthesiology, I learned that my passion was for animals and not so much human medicine. I then decided that my goal was to become a Veterinarian. Currently, I do a lot of studying while I finish up my last pre-requisite classes for vet school, but I also like to play guitar and video games with my friends.\n\nAthenea M.\n\nLead Customer Service Representative\n\nThe reason I love the veterinary industry is that the unconditional love we receive from animals makes us the luckiest beings, and to be the voice for the animals that are unable to speak gives me so much joy! I have an Associate in Business Administration. I very much love working in public. I have a background in caring for children, so working with clients’ fur children comes naturally. I am looking forward to furthering my education. I am a mother of 3 and enjoy my mommy time at the gym. I enjoy reading murder mysteries, hiking, and camping. I love to take my dog, Mila, hiking and camping. It is a great exercise for her and for me. She is a great people-pleasing dog!\n\nJuli H.\n\nRegistered Veterinary Technician\n\nProviding the best care for my patients is my passion. I treat and love each animal as if it were my own. I graduated in December of 2012 with my Bachelor of Science/Veterinary Technology from Purdue University. Growing up with animals my entire life, I knew at a very young age that Veterinary Medicine was my calling. My mother is a nurse, and I watched her have relationships with her patients. I wanted more personal relationships with my patients and clients, so I knew being an RVT was the right path for me. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I have two young children, which keeps my husband and me busy, but we wouldn’t have it any other way. I also volunteer at our church. I have three pets of my own—one cat Wendy, and Two dogs, Sadie Mae and Copper. Sadie is special needs and uses a wheelchair to get around because she became paralyzed when she was nine years old. I enjoy crafting and collecting various types of houseplants. I also enjoy running and weightlifting in my spare time.\n\nMichelle G.\n\nRegistered Veterinary Technician\n\nI grew up in rural Montgomery County and have had pets for as long as I can remember. I have wanted to be an “animal doctor” since age 4. Caring for sick or injured pets is very rewarding when you see the looks on the patients’ and their family’s faces when they get home; it’s the best! I graduated with an associate in applied science from Purdue University. Obtained my RVT license in 1993. I was bandaging make-believe wounds on my dogs in elementary school and always wanted to work with pets. When the Veterinary Technician Program became available while I was in high school, I knew that was my future. I love to read, do cross-stitching and do crochet projects. I love spending time with my grandsons and my two dogs. My husband Alan and I enjoy movies and dinner out. I enjoy walking on the Sugar Creek Trail, fishing in sugar creek, and target shooting.\n\nAmanda D.\n\nCustomer Service Representative\n\nI have had cats my entire life. I have always loved taking care of them. I have two cats now and just adopted a puppy! They are my best friends! I graduated from North Montgomery High School and Indiana State University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Child Development and Family Life with a minor in Psychology and Community Health. For me, it was the best of both worlds! I love getting to love on our furry patients, and I have always enjoyed working with people in customer service to make sure they are satisfied and happy customers when they leave. In the summer, I love to go to the golf course and ride the cart with my son and husband. I enjoy going out to eat and trying new restaurants. I love going to concerts and Nascar races with my husband. My two sons, husband, and I love to go to the water parks in Lebanon or Lafayette. We love to support the local Arni’s (they have the best salads around).\n\nKailyn P.\n\nVeterinary Assistant\n\nMy passion for animals has grown rapidly over the past few years. What I love most about animals is that they always sit and listen and are there for you when you need them most. I graduated from Lebanon High School in 2019. I decided to pursue nursing, but I have taken a break from schooling to continue to work in the veterinary field. I started interning at a veterinary clinic when I was 18. I quickly grew to love vet meds. I love to watch the puppies and kittens grow up, protect our sick patients, get better, and go home to their loving families. I love to hang out with family and friends, go to church, craft, and hang out with my 3 Great Danes, my German Shepherd, and my cat.\n\nDr. Molly Karlin\n\nVeterinarian\n\nPurdue University Doctor of Veterinary Medicine\n\nColorado State University Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences\n\nSUNY Cobleskill B.S. Animal Science\n\nClinical Interests: Canine & Equine Reproduction, Soft Tissue & Orthopedic Surgery, Ophthalmology, Equine Integrative Sports Medicine & Lameness, Small Animal & Equine Dentistry, Small Animal & Equine Preventative Medicine\n\nDr. Molly Karlin comes from New York where she spent a portion of her childhood in the flower market of New York City where her parents worked before eventually moving to the Catskills. Her family had a small farm with dogs, cats, and horses and during the summers they would raise cattle for their neighbors. As a child Dr. Molly spent most of her time in a dairy barn and was often seen in a calf pen sleeping with the calves. She was an active 4-H member and fostered numerous litters of kittens for her local shelter. Dr. Molly also competitively showed her horse Casper in a variety of different disciplines.\n\nDr. Molly has always enjoyed caring for animals and has always wanted to become a veterinarian. After she started working for a large animal veterinarian at the age of 16, there was no turning back on her goal of being a veterinarian. She then continued to work in the veterinary field throughout her education and was fortunate to have numerous mentors to guide her over the years. She quickly realized just how much she loved veterinarian medicine but also the ability to work with clients.\n\nShe graduated magna cum laude from SUNY Cobleskill with a B.S. in Animal Science in 2017. She then went on to gain her M.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Colorado State University in 2019. After which she was accepted to Purdue University and gained her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 2023.\n\nDr. Molly truly enjoys every aspect of veterinary medicine and especially loves working with clients to create a plan that meets their pet’s needs. She enjoys working with dogs, cats and horses and has a special interest in surgery, ophthalmology, dentistry, and reproduction.\n\nDr. Molly lives here in Indiana with her fiancé (soon to be husband) Patrick who is a wildlife biologist. They both enjoy being outdoors with their dog Sam who has been with Dr. Molly for the past 9 years of her education. They have two cats, Mitzy and Eileen. They adopted Mitzy right before moving to Indiana when she was a kitten and became very attached to their dog. Eileen was added to the family in the summer of 2021 when she was brought to Crawfordsville Family Vet on emergency when she was 6 weeks old and needed her leg amputated. Dr. Molly assisted in the surgery with Dr. Himes and was the perfect addition to their family. They also have a horse named Ollie and a mini mule named Gracie Lou.\n\nWhen Dr. Molly is not working, she enjoys hiking, gardening and basically anything outdoors with her family. She also enjoys riding her horse, baking, crocheting, and reading."
