        "text": "Anna Slominski left a lasting mark on the Illinois Institute of Technology in several ways.\n\nA former Division III women's swimming and diving student-athlete, Slominski was a standout in and out of the pool.\n\nA four-year team member, Slominski, who uses the pronouns \"they\" and \"them,\" qualified for the Division III championship in 2020 and 2023. As a senior, they were named Swim and Dive MVP, Women's Winter Athlete of the Year and Women's Athlete of the Year at their school.\n\nSlominski also holds multiple records, including the Liberal Arts Championship records in the 100-yard breaststroke, 200-yard breaststroke and 200-yard individual medley, as well as team records in seven individual events and two relays. They also were recognized with first-team Scholar All-America honors by the College Swimming & Diving Coaches Association of America in 2023.\n\nWhat Slominski is most proud of, however, is the impact they left on the campus community through their advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\n\"As my leadership not only on the swim team but across campus grew, â€¦ I have come to realize the impact by being unapologetic about being out,\" Slominski said. \"Being seen advocating for myself and others on queer issues and curating events to include queer identities allow for the campus to become a safer place for all.\"\n\nComing out as bisexual in middle school, Slominski always has been outspoken about queer issues. They have been openly nonbinary since their sophomore year on the college swim team, finding support from coaches and teammates. One of many examples Slominski noted was how coach Billy Bafia helped get their pronouns listed on swimcloud.com, a popular website for swimmers.\n\n\"In my time, the swim team has seen many of our student-athletes feel safe enough to come out. In being an older member, I hope that I have been a positive force in creating an inclusive environment,\" Slominski said. \"It is important for me to be a part of making the spaces I inhabit as inviting as possible for everyone.\"\n\nSlominski's impact has extended far beyond the pool.\n\nThey graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a master's in transportation. Their academic pursuits were complemented by a commitment to environmental sustainability, demonstrated by co-founding the school's environmental engineering club.\n\nAs the president of the club, Slominski organized events that fostered inclusivity, such as a panel featuring queer professionals in science, technology, engineering and math. This event provided a platform for queer students to engage with and learn from older queer professionals, reinforcing the importance of visibility and representation.\n\nIn recognition of their contributions, Slominski received the 2023 Division III LGBTQ Student-Athlete of the Year Award. This award, which acknowledges the achievements and contributions of LGBTQ student-athletes in Division III, was particularly meaningful for Slominski.\n\n\"This award means so much to me, to be honored by the NCAA as well as just an athlete in general,\" Slominski said. \"I've been swimming since the age of 12. Every award that I've received up until now has been specific to the women's team, so it's really impactful to be able to receive this award as authentically as myself, as a nonbinary person.\"\n\nSlominski's advocacy for inclusivity extends beyond their own experience. They are passionate about making STEM fields more welcoming for LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\n\"Being queer is such a personal part of one's life, especially in academics and in athletics,\" Slominski said. \"It can be hard to integrate yourself into nonqueer communities, so one of the biggest things that I do in terms of inclusion is just being so authentically out and being a safe space for people to be out.\"\n\nWhile their college swimming career is over and they are now working for the U.S. Department of Transportation as a general engineer, Slominski plans to continue being involved in sports and advocating for more inclusive environments.\n\nSlominski plans to continue their athletic career through triathlons and becoming a masters swimmer. They are also eager to join queer-friendly athletic teams in their future communities, continuing to advocate for inclusivity in sports. Beyond athletics, Slominski aims to extend LGBTQ+ inclusion into the workplace, bringing awareness to the diverse identities within the queer community.\n\n\"I have so many goals postgraduation in terms of extending LGBTQ inclusion, not just in athletics but outside of it,\" Slominski said. \"I want to bring light to the many different faces that queer people can take. I'm just one face of the many voices that deserve to be seen.\""
