        "text": "About the School\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology is a private, research-based university located in Chicago, IL. Illinois Tech was founded in 1890 and the current name was adopted when the Armour Institute and Lewis Institute merged in 1940.\n\nIllinois Tech has approximately 3,100 undergraduate students, boasts an impressive 86% retention rate and operates with a 10:1 faculty to student ratio.\n\nU.S. News & World Report has ranked Illinois Institute of Technology as:\n\n#122 in National Universities\n\n#148 in Best Colleges for Veterans\n\n#42 in Best Value Schools\n\n#82 in Top Performers on Social Mobility\n\n#86 in Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs\n\nChallenges before Suitable\n\nThe administration at Illinois Tech was looking for a platform that could act as a hub for student org management and that their students would actually engage with. Add on a goal of increasing student satisfaction, and the team knew that in order to get students on board, they needed to start on day one of the student journey.\n\nThe problem? Satisfaction was low with the last couple of vendors that Illinois Tech tried and the platforms were slow and not mobile or user-friendly. Plus, the administration had a hard time working with the other platforms due to limited customer service and support.\n\nThis created the perfect storm. A low-adoption rate with administration and low engagement rates among students. Assessment data was hard to access and there were little/no gamification features to incentivize engagement.\n\nAt the same time, leadership was looking for a way to break down silos between four different departments that have remained separate but needed to be united:\n\nThe Pre-College Program\n\nThe Office of Campus Life (OCL)\n\nThe Office of Residence Life (ORL)\n\nCareer Services\n\nBy de-siloing departments, improving the user experience and centralizing student orgs, the team at Illinois Tech knew they could boost engagement and cultivate a more inclusive culture on campus with the right partner.\n\nIn order to meet the latest accreditation requirements with the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), IIT also needed a better way to track and assess co-curricular involvement. The team needed enhanced reporting on quantitative and qualitative (i.e. – ePortfolio/reflection) data that accurately reflects student engagement and co-curricular activity.\n\nWith the challenges piling up, Thy Nguyen pitched a one-stop solution: Suitable.\n\nLife with Suitable\n\nSuitable's mobile-first technology was easy to adopt and user-friendly, allowing the Illinois Tech team to put student engagement exactly where students’ would actually use it - on their phones.\n\nThe user-friendly nature of the platform doesn’t stop with students. The administration found the software easy to use and adopt, plus with a University Success partner accessible and ready to help with any challenges, the customer service stood out compared to previous vendors.\n\nWhen it came time to launch The Scarlet Hawk Journey on Suitable, the adoption process was smooth, even on a short 3-month timeline. There was excellent communication between the Suitable team and the Office of Technology Services.\n\nPersonalization features allow the platform to look like an extension of the Illinois Tech website that students are most familiar with:\n\nBlack and red branding\n\nUse of the IIT mascot, Talon\n\nPlus, personalized Digital Badges and imagery\n\nThe Scarlet Hawk Journey launched during Welcome Week in August 2021 and was integrated immediately into the First-Year Experience at Illinois Tech. The team got all new students to log on and introduced them to the app from day one.\n\nThe Scarlet Hawk Journey is boosting student engagement through interactive Leaderboards and by rewarding participation with incentives like hoodies, TVs and Amazon Alexas.\n\nStudent Orgs are using the tool to get their organizations and events in front of more of their peers. With an extensive student organization list, Illinois Tech was first in line to test Suitable’s new Student Org Management feature.\n\nThe Scarlet Hawk Journey unites different programs and encourages co-curricular learning.\n\nThe Illinois Tech team is using the platform to collect data, analyze it and share it with staff and student leaders alike.\n\nStudent feedback is overwhelmingly positive, events are easier to track and manage, and the Illinois Tech administrative team has a platform that can handle their robust student organization needs.\n\nPlans for the Future\n\nWhen it comes to future goals go, Illinois Tech's team is working with each department on campus to get them on the platform. They have a short-term goal of diversifying their competencies and integrating the Suitable platform with their ELEVATE site.\n\nAnother priority for the team is onboarding pre-college students who matriculate through Suitable, so they begin their time at IIT with a badge.\n\nThy and Rachel also hope to work with the Suitable team to track fund accounts and develop a budgeting tool that integrates with Banner.\n\nIn addition, the team is aiming for a 50% engagement rate next year (2022-2023), and a 70% engagement rate the following academic year. Thy and Rachel are currently working on a Career Initiatives badge, as well as badges that correspond with the 4-year framework of holistic student development below:\n\nAutonomous identity and self-development.\n\nCareer initiatives and professionalism.\n\nLeadership and innovation.\n\nLeaving a legacy.\n\nThe overarching goal for The Scarlet Hawk Journey is simple: improve the student journey while helping students build a co-curricular that builds their resumes and professional profiles. Suitable is helping streamline the process and supporting students and staff alike."
