        "text": "SDSU Chemistry: Faculty Through the Ages\n\nMissing from this list are instructors in chemistry before there was a distinct Chemistry Department, as well as many lecturers and adjuncts who have given their time and effort to the instruction of our students. I have included some of our current and long-lived lecturers who have been active in the governance and research of the department. Dates are periods of service to the Chemistry Department. \"SDSC\" is San Diego State College, one of the former names of SDSU.\n\nMitchel (Ted) T. Abbott\n\nserved 1964-1992; Ph.D. UCLA. Biochemist studying pathways of biological oxidations. Funded by the NIH for many years. Abbott, Jensen, Malik, Mathewson, and Stewart all left during an administrative meltdown brought on by the budget crisis of 1992.\n\nJoseph Adams\n\nserved 1994-1999, biochemist. Now at the Department of Pharmacology, UCSD.\n\nRoss A. Baker\n\nserved 1952-1957, Ph.D. U. Wisconsin. \"A grand old retired professor, Ross Baker. He taught freshman laboratories and scientific glass blowing. The latter was not only a fun thing, it was a real service to the department as he could construct special apparatus. Glass blowing was also his hobby and he had a small shop at his Mt Helix home. I still have a 1\" high pitcher with cobalt blue handle, a hero's engine, and a couple of other items which he gave us.\" -- V. Landis. In 1945 Baker retired as Chairman of the New York Section of the A.C.S., largest of the 106 local sections. He was Professor of Chemistry at C.C.N.Y. His father taught chemistry at De Pauw University.\n\nLaurance G. Beauvais\n\nserved 2006-2012, B.S. '94 U. Houston (C. W. Paul Chu), Ph.D. '02 U.C. Berkeley (Jeffrey R.

Larry first joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida, where he received NSF support and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. After his stay at the University of Florida, he joined SDSU, where he became a major contributor to the department's lower division courses. He designed Chem 105 in response to a clear need to bring students up to speed before entering the General Chemistry course. Retired in 2000 when the movers refused to relocate the 5-ft. high stacks of paper in his office to the new CSL building (could be true). A true teacher-scholar, a great mentor to struggling students, and an inspiration to his colleagues.\n\nMiriam V. Bennett\n\nserved 2007-2014, B.S. USC, Ph.D. U.C. Berkeley, postdoc MIT. Inorganic chemistry.\n\nB. Mikael Bergdahl\n\nserved 1999-, M.S. and Ph.D. 1992 Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden; Postdoc 1994 Notre Dame (Helquist); Visiting scholar UCSD and Scripps Research institute (KC Nicolaou) 1999.

Bioinorganic chemistry and x-ray crystallography. A prominent bioinorganic chemist and x-ray crystyallographer, Carl joined the department as Chair with the hope of directing the expansion of the faculty to its former numbers, but instead had to steer us through the worst state budget in a dozen years. Carl has served as an NSF program officer and was elected a AAAS fellow in 2011.\n\nDale Chatfield\n\nserved 1978-; A.B., M.S. Oakland U. Michigan, Ph.D. UNC (Maurice Bursey). Mass spectroscopist, and department Chair from 1998-2003.\n\nJames Cobble\n\n(1926-2021) served 1973-2002; A.B. Northern Arizona U., M.S. USC, Ph.D. '52 U. Tennessee and Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies (G. Frederick Smith). Physical chemist.

Grotjahn\n\nserved 1997-2023; B.A. Reed College, Ph.D. U.C. Berkeley (Peter Volhardt). Organic and bioinorganic chemistry. Doug joined the department from U. Arizona, and for nearly 20 years directed the Joint Doctoral Program and worked closely with Tom Cole on managing all the department's graduate admissions. Continuously funded by NSF while at SDSU, along with grants from DOE and others, Doug led the department's emergence from hard times in the 1990's to reacquire its present high level of research activity. Doug's brilliant use of heterocyclic ligands on transition metals to mediate hydrogen-transfer reactions led to the development of numerous innovative catalysts for fine chemical synthesis, and offered a unique approach to water-splitting chemistry. Doug was also deeply devoted to the educational mission of the department, committing himself to the success of students in his group. A wonderful colleague in all respects, he leaves a lasting impression on the department and all of us who knew him.\n\nEdward Grubbs\n\nserved 1961-1997, physical organic chemist; B.S. Occidental College, Ph.D. MIT (Herbert House), postdoc U. Illinois (David Curtin). His research was directed towards substituent field effects and nitrones. His postdoc with David Curtin at Illinois narrowly missed Bill Richardson's appearance in the group as a Ph.D. student. Grubbs' research at SDSU was supported by the NSF, NIH, PRF, and IBM.\n\nEdgar E. Hardy\n\n(1913-2009) ????-????. Polymer chemistry. Dr. Hardy came to SDSU as an adjunct professor after a long and successful career in industrial polymer chemistry. He studied in Switzerland and at the University of Minnesota, and taught at Cal Poly Pomona, UCSD, and SDSU. He was also an author and painter in watercolors. Steve Roeder remembers that one time when Dr. Hardy taught classes for us as an adjunct, Dr. Hardy donated his pay back to the department. Ken Long adds, \"While I did not know this, it is completely consistent with everything I knew of Dr. Hardy's character.\" He passed away in 2009 at the age of 96.\n\nNeil Harrington\n\nserved 1948-????; B.S. '39 Monmouth College, additional study at DePaul and Northwestern. Harrington had a Ph.D. in Chemical Education, in case anyone thinks that's a new idea, and he taught and coordinated Chem 2A which later became Chem 100. \"His wife, also a veteran, taught business at SDJC (now SDCC). Because the JC's give credit for ANY graduate work, she was paid more than Neil.\" - V. Landis. From the 1963 Faculty Register: \"Takes a personal interest in his students; is willing to help them.\" Harrington's description in the Robinson History.\n\nArthur H. Hayes\n\nserved 1954-1957; A.B. SDSC. Lecturer in Chemistry.\n\nLars Hellberg (Feb 23 1930-Feb 8 2011)\n\nserved 1956-1992 and beyond; B.S. '51 Northwestern (Robert Burwell), Ph.D. '58 UCLA (Thomas L. Jacobs); organic chemist. Eat your heart out, Barry Sharpless: Lars is still easily the most widely recognized organic chemist in the greater San Diego area. Just try asking random people at the next Padres' game. A one-time northwest Chicago rough kid (once having to write \"I will not throw snowballs\" 103 times after attacking a school bus with his gang), Lars got his Ph.D. at UCLA, where he was Bill Richardson's TA in organic chemistry. Lars officially retired in 1992, but kept a desk in the department and occasionally emailed us to ask after a book that someone had borrowed from his collection. He was also a founding member of the chemistry faculty at the graduate campus of the Tijuana Technological Institute, from which he retired in 2007. Lars gave generously in many ways, embodying a love of community and love of learning that serves still as a model for generations of his students and colleagues. From the 1963 Faculty Register: \"He conducts an interesting and hard class. Outstanding lectures are matched by his difficult and detailed quizzes and tests. Conscientious reading of the text is a must.\"\n\nWilliam E. Hutton\n\nserved 1947-1948; A.B. '38 U.C. Berkeley. Lecturer in Chemistry.\n\nCarl Iddings\n\nserved 1922-1923; B.S. '18 U.C. Berkeley. The first chemistry professor to last a year at what would become SDSU. (One professor preceded Iddings but left ignominiously.) Iddings himself left after only a year, according to the September 17 1923 Paper Lantern (predecessor to the Daily Aztec) in order to puruse graduate work at Berkeley. Iddings' description in the Robinson History.\n\nRobert Isensee (Nov 2 1919-Jun 17 2012)\n\nserved 1948-1982; A.B. '41 Reed College, M.A. '43 and Ph.D. '48 Oregon State U. Organic chemist. Served as Chair (1958-1961) Graduate Coordinator in early sixties. As Chair in the late fifties coordinated the planning of the 1960 Chemistry/Geology Building. He and Hal Walba, in collaboration, received in 1954 San Diego State's first NSF supported research grant. During Chairmanships of Walba and Wadsworth served as Assistant Chair. Isensee's description in the Robinson History.\n\nCarl E. James\n\nserved 1948-1949, 1954-1955; A.B. '33 SDSC. Lecturer in Chemistry.

Nevada, Ph.D. '57 U. Washington (A.W. Fairhall). Research in radiochemistry and fission research.\n\nWalter D. Jones\n\nserved 1962-1991; B.S. U. Washington, Ph.D. '58 Oregon State U. (J.C. Decius). Physical chemist. Jones set up an outstanding integrated senior physical-analytical lab program, featuring instruction in molecular structure research, interpretation of IR spectra, etc, and served as Chairman of the Chemistry Department for three years.\n\nLionel Joseph\n\nserved 1947-1972; B.S. '33 St. Louis U., M.S. '34, Ph.D. i'37 Washington U. An organic chemist and licensed pharmacist, Joseph was one of the first active researchers in the department, working on biochemical projects funded by the Heart Association. Born in Scotland, Joseph returned to the UK upon his retirement, to a suburb of London. \"A delightful British accent and philosophy helped us tide many crises. He pronounced 'part' as 'pot' which made some lectures a bit funny.\" - V. Landis. Department chair from 1952-1955. Joseph's description in the Robinson History.\n\nGregory Kalyuzhny\n\nserved 2006-2013, analytical/materials, M.S. Novosibirsk State (Vladimir Semikolenov), Ph.D. Weizmann Inst. (Israel Rubinstein), postdocs UT Austin (Allen J. Bard) and UNC (Royce W. Murray). Greg's work focused on the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor nanoparticles, and their possible applications to sensor technology.\n\nAileen F. Knowles\n\nserved 1997-2008, membrane protein biochemist, Ph.D. U.C. Riverside (Anthony Norman), postdoc Cornell (Efraim Racker) and New York Public Health Research Institute (Harvey Penefsky); also appointment to UCSD.

'43 Hanover College, Ph.D. '46 U. Illinois (Harold Snyder, Charles Price, studying anti-malarial), postdoc MIT (Arthur Cope). Pete Kovacic was valedictorian of his class at Hanover College, and went from there to study anti-malarial treatments at Illinois, contributing to the then emerging field of medicinal chemistry. While at Illinois, he roomed across the hall from David Curtin, who would later be Bill Richardson's PhD advisor. Pete was an instructor at Columbia for a year (during a supposed postdoc with Robert Elderfield), and then worked for 7 years at DuPont (working on neoprene vulcanization and halocarbons). Pete then accepted a faculty position at Case Institute of Technology (later Case-Western) in 1955, where his was among the first research groups to propose oxidative stress as a primary mechanicsm of tissue damage. He moved to U. Wisconsin at Milwaukee in 1968, returning to the issue of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant activity in the 1980's. After retiring in 1987, he traveled extensively before settling in San Diego and joining SDSU as an adjunct professor. He continued his work by reviewing the literature and keeping an eye out for applications of his unifying theory of oxidant and anti-oxidant activity in medicine, ultimately authoring over 300 publications. Pete passed away peacefully at the age of 100 1/2. Dot, his beloved wife of 72 years, predeceased him in 2018.\n\nVincent J. Landis\n\nserved 1954-2000; B.S. Washington State College, Ph.D. '57 U. Minnesota (Robert Bradsted). Joined the Department at age 24, coming from U. Minnesota with a major in inorganic and a minor in analytical chemistry. \"Hired as inorganic chemist. There were 230 faculty and 23 administrators in the catalog. I think there were 5,700 students. The faculty doubled in three years. I worked in freshman chem, analytical chem and advanced inorganic until I developed the graduate Inorganic Chemistry courses when we got the MS degree.

I worked on mercury in seawater (with Herb Weiss), using satellites to measure productivity in surface waters (with Al Zirino), and other stuff. On some trips we took Walt Jones along. After retirement I worked with Alan McCormack in science education on visual-spatial teaching and learning. My paper describing the problem (Visual-spatial thinking: An aspect of science overlooked by educators, Science Education, 1999) still shows 381 citations as of this evening. In my years in San Diego I rowed on masters crews for Mission Bay Rowing association and The San Diego Rowing Club. My best medal was a national bronze in Georgia. The racing season starts with the San Diego Crew Classic on Mission Bay March 24 and 25 this year. I also was a crew member on some racing yachts out of San Diego. So I'm hoisting a beer to all you chemists working in the most connected and relevant area in the sciences, mystifying students and pushing out the boundaries of knowledge.

He and Benson co-authored the text Kinetic Data on Gas Phase Unimolecular Reactions. Ed was also active in photochemical kinetics of small molecules, which led to a close collaboration with Morey Ring on silane chemistry, and his work was supported by the NSF. Ed received SDSU's Outstanding Faculty Award in 1986. \" Ed was a wonderful fellow with a great spirit. Although he retired shortly before Karen and I started at SDSU, he still came in a few times per week to his office, which was next to mine, mostly to work on papers that he was writing with Morey Ring about their silane work. Their collaboration had been remarkably fruitful, and they still had a storehouse of results that they wanted to publish. Ed was generous and helpful to me when I started out. He gave me notes to some classes and advice about teaching and research. Since I took over teaching Thermodynamics from him, I’d sometimes ask him questions about nuances in the subject. With a smile and a laugh, he’d respond with something like, “I knew I should have gone golfing today instead of coming in.” But then the next time, he’d say, “Dave, I think I solved the problem!” Ed was clearly a scholar, and not so much because he could solve thorny Thermo problems. In addition to his numerous research publications, he co-authored a General Chemistry textbook with Clay Sharts and Larry Bennett. The bound copy that Ed gave me indicates that it was copyrighted and perhaps in its final draft stages, although I’m not sure it was published (I could be wrong about this point). He also co-authored with Sydney Benson---a PChemist then at the Stanford Research Institute--- a monograph entitled, “Kinetic Data on Gas Phase Unimolecular Reactions,” published by the National Bureau of Standards in 1970.\" --David Pullman From the 1963 Faculty Register: \"You might as well take the best--and O'Neal is.

Wyllie\n\nserved 1951-1952; A.B. SDSC. Assistant in Chemistry.\n\nSDSU Chemistry Staff Through the Ages\n\nThis is never going to be a complete list, in part because there are periodic oscillations in administrative philosophy towards the assignment of staff to individual departments versus centralized groups, especially in the case of the technical staff. The more things change....\n\nSusan Adams\n\nAdministrative Support Coordinator (ran the main office), following Michelle Johnson, for several years. Susan moved in 2001 to support the less nervous faculty in Astronomy for her last few years at SDSU, retiring at the end of 2006.\n\nMassoud Ajami\n\nElectronics technician, and a master at keeping legacy technology on its feet. Retired in October 2005.\n\nGayle Anderson\n\nOffice manager, joined the department in 2006 and has guided the unruly faculty through all matters RTP, course scheduling, TA scheduling, hiring, and so on ever since. Has kept the ship running smoothly through the Recession, numerous personnel changes, and those random adjustments to forms and procedures that keep our administration so entertained. And keeps us on top of the important things, like staying in touch with our friends and coworkers in the hospital (three of us in two weeks, once!).\n\nErlene Carter\n\nAssigned to the department in 1961, and a linchpin for over a decade. \"After Irene Janeck went to the office of the Division of Physical Sciences with Robinson, we generally had to use the college's secretarial pool.

Originally from Hungary, Cseri is still remembered by many as an outstanding glassworker. \"Steve Cseri was one of the most talented glassblowers that I had encountered. I addition, he was a nice guy. If you could draw a sketch of it, Steve could make it. He made some specialized photochemical glassware for me which couldn't be found in a catalog and it proved very useful. One of his greatest contributions was building vacuum racks, which is a custom job that requires the glassblower to be on site. He built one for me which got a lot of use, but this was minor compared to those he built for Ring and O'Neal. They had a large laboratory almost completely filled with vacuum racks. The cost to hire a glassblower on site to make these would have been prohibitive.\" - W. Richardson.\n\nThe September 22 1977 edition of the Daily Aztec carries a profile of Steve Cseri.\n\nMary Coleman Jackson\n\nOur much beloved graduate secretary and department archivist, Mary joined the department in 1972 and became its heart for some thirty years before retiring at the end of 2004 after a year in the short-staffed Biology department.

In the 1950's and early 60's he ran the department. No one was allowed in the storeroom without his permission. He was an ex-Navy Chief. You did it his way or else.

Landis. \"I had the great experience of working along side Frank here at San Diego State in the Chemistry Department. He was a man of great honesty and character.
