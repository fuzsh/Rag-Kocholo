        "text": "Polish American mathematician\n\nSamuel Karlin (June 8, 1924 – December 18, 2007) was an American mathematician at Stanford University in the late 20th century.\n\nEducation and career\n\n[edit]\n\nKarlin was born in Janów, Poland and immigrated to Chicago as a child. Raised in an Orthodox Jewish household, Karlin became an atheist in his teenage years and remained an atheist for the rest of his life. Later in life he told his three children, who all became scientists, that walking down the street without a yarmulke on his head for the first time was a milestone in his life.[3]\n\nKarlin earned his undergraduate degree from Illinois Institute of Technology; and then his doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University in 1947 (at the age of 22) under the supervision of Salomon Bochner. He was on the faculty of Caltech from 1948 to 1956, before becoming a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford.[3][4]\n\nThroughout his career, Karlin made fundamental contributions to the fields of mathematical economics, bioinformatics, game theory, evolutionary theory, biomolecular sequence analysis, and total positivity.[4] Karlin authored ten books and more than 450 articles. He did extensive work in mathematical population genetics. In the early 1990s, Karlin and Stephen Altschul developed the Karlin-Altschul statistics, a basis for the highly used sequence similarity software program BLAST.[3]\n\nHonors and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nKarlin was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[5] the National Academy of Sciences,[6] and the American Philosophical Society.[7] He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1973.[8] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush bestowed Karlin the National Medal of Science \"for his broad and remarkable research in mathematical analysis, probability theory and mathematical statistics, and in the application of these ideas to mathematical economics, mechanics, and population genetics.\"[9] He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.[10]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Karlin's sons, Kenneth D. Karlin, is a professor of chemistry at Johns Hopkins University and the 2009 winner of the American Chemical Society's F. Albert Cotton Award for Synthetic Chemistry.[11] His other son, Manuel, is a physician in Portland, Oregon. His daughter, Anna R. Karlin, is a theoretical computer scientist, the Microsoft Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.[12]\n\nSelected publications\n\n[edit]\n\nKarlin, Samuel; Arrow, Kenneth J.; Suppes, Patrick (1960).
