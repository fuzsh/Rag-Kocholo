        "text": "BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\nSusan Cayton Woodson\n\nSusan Cayton Woodson (1918-2013), longtime champion of visual art and social protest in black Chicago, was born on October 18, 1918 in Seattle, Washington to Ruth Cayton and Floyd Wright. The Caytons were one of the most illustrious African American families of the post-Civil War era. Susan’s maternal great-grandfather, Hiram Revels, became the first African American Senator in the U.S. Senate when he won Jefferson Davis’s old Mississippi Senate seat in 1870 during Reconstruction. Her mother’s father, Horace Cayton, Sr., published black newspapers such as the Seattle Republican and Cayton’s Weekly, and was a leading advocate of racial justice in Seattle. Her maternal grandmother, Susie Revels Cayton, was a noted author of fiction, an integral contributor to the Seattle Republican and Cayton’s Weekly, and an activist in progressive political circles.\n\nThe year after Susan was born, her mother Ruth Cayton passed away, and Susan was taken in by her maternal grandparents, Horace Cayton, Sr. and Susie Revels Cayton. In the Cayton family home, Susan was raised as the little sister of her deceased mother’s younger siblings, Madge, Horace Jr., Revels, and Lillie. Susan graduated from Garfield High School in Seattle.\n\nIn 1940, after Horace Cayton, Sr. died, Susan moved to Chicago. She was escorted on the trip by longtime family friend Paul Robeson. In Chicago, she joined Madge and Horace Cayton, Jr. Horace Jr. directed Parkway Community House, while conducting research that led to the landmark study Black Metropolis, which he co-authored with St. Clair Drake. Horace introduced Susan to literary icons such as Richard Wright, Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps. In Bronzeville, Susan immersed herself in the flourishing Black Chicago Renaissance, befriending young black visual artists such as Margaret Taylor Goss (later Burroughs), Bernard Goss, Eldzier Cortor, Gordon Parks, Marion Perkins, Charles White, Charles Sebree, Irene Clark, and William McBride, as well as writers such as Margaret Walker and Theodore Ward.\n\nSusan was an early member of the South Side Community Art Center, an institution borne of the collaboration between black artists such as Margaret Goss and community leaders such as Pauline Kigh Reid, and dedicated to what Goss deemed “the defense of culture” in black Chicago. The center provided young black artists with a venue to exhibit their work, and ran programs for black Chicago children, many of whom only did half-day shifts at school. Dedicated by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1941, the Center is one of only two Federal Arts Project/Works Progress Administration art centers still in operation. In addition to art exhibitions, Susan helped the Center plan and implement art appreciation workshops, as well as classes on pottery, dance, and photography. In the 1970s, Susan became a member of the board and helped sustain the Center for several decades.\n\nSusan worked in the Chicago Department of Welfare, and later for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. In 1949, she married Harold Woodson, a biochemist at Provident Hospital, and the newlywed couple moved into the Rosenwald Apartments, which housed many of black Chicago’s most prominent families. They had a son, Harold Woodson, Jr. In the 1950s, Susan, along with friends such as Margaret Burroughs and former Negro Story editor Fern Gayden, searched for a progressive religious organization and founded All Souls Unitarian Church, a Unitarian Universalist congregation.\n\nSusan began building her art collection with the artwork she inherited from family members. This artwork included the clock that Jefferson Davis gave to her great-grandfather Hiram Revels. It grew with works owned by Horace Cayton, Jr. before his death in 1970. In addition to works by artists previously mentioned, her collection included works by artists such as Sylvester Britton, Allen Stringfellow, and George Neal. She was especially drawn to the life story of Neal, who was a leader of the short-lived Arts and Crafts Guild, and mentored young artists in the depths of the Great Depression.\n\nWith these works, Susan turned the Woodson home into the Susan Woodson Gallery. In the Gallery, she held exhibitions of the work of Black Chicago Renaissance artists as well as up-and-coming contemporary artists. Throughout her life, she continued to acquire art, including William McBride’s collection of African masks.\n\nA life-long activist in the Black History movement, she was a founding member of the Vivian G. Harsh Society, an organization which supports the work of the Chicago Public Library’s Vivian G. Harsh Collection of Afro-American History and Literature.\n\nSusan Cayton Woodson passed away on January 31, 2013. She is survived by her son Harold W. Woodson, Jr., stepdaughter Eleanor Kamuda, grandson Charles J. Woodson, granddaughters Melissa Waldon-Ongley and Meredith Kamuda, and great granddaughter Marley Rose Meanie.\n\nSources:\n\nProgram, Susan Cayton Woodson Memorial Service, Augustana Lutheran Church of Hyde Park, Chicago, February 9, 2013.\n\nHobbs, Richard S.

After graduating from Englewood High School in 1932, Harold enrolled in Crane Junior College, followed by the Lewis Institute of the Illinois Institute of Technology, earning a B.S. in Chemistry in 1937. He then took graduate courses in chemistry at the University of Chicago. In the late 1930s, Harold began writing and publishing academic science articles, such as “The Present Status of Chemistry in Negro Colleges,” published in the Journal of Negro Education in 1939.\n\nIn 1945, Harold earned an M.S. from the University of Illinois and was awarded a Rosenwald Fellowship, a fellowship established by the Julius Rosenwald Foundation that provided funds to many prominent black artists, scientists and intellectuals, including Charles Drew, Langston Hughes, Gordon Parks, Katherine Dunham, Elizabeth Catlett, William Edouard Scott, Ralph Bunche, and W.E.B. Du Bois. Directed by Edwin Embree from 1932 until the depletion of the Rosenwald Fund in 1948, the Rosenwald Fellowship was an important financial ballast of the Black Chicago Renaissance.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1955, Harold began directing a biochemistry laboratory at Provident Hospital. In 1949, he married Susan Cayton. As Harold’s reputation as a scientist grew, he received many requests from other scientists, black and white, for copies of his articles. After 1955, Harold supervised chemistry labs for the Illinois Department of Agriculture and the Illinois Department of Public Health. He also taught and lectured on chemistry at institutions such as the University of Illinois School of Public Health. Harold Woodson died on February 23, 1998.\n\nSources:\n\n“Harold Woodson.” Chicago Tribune, March 6, 1998.\n\nProgram, Harold Woodson Memorial Service, Griffin Funeral Home, February 27, 1998.\n\nHarold Woodson, Curriculum Vitae, undated.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT NOTE\n\nThis collection has been arranged in two super series: Susan Cayton Woodson and Harold Woodson, her husband.
