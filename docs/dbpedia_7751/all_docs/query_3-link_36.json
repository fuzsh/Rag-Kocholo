In 1940, a merger between Armour Institute and Lewis Institute led to the creation of Illinois Institute of Technology – a private University that focuses on technology-focused research.\n\nToday, the University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in:\n\nEngineering\n\nArchitecture\n\nScience\n\nBusiness\n\nHuman sciences\n\nDesign\n\nApplied technology\n\nLaw\n\nIt is also a Ph.D. granting technical University. Its Engineering College, The Armour College of Engineering, is pretty good for Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n\nWith students from nearly 100 countries studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology, the international student body is quite strong here and nearly 62% of the total student population consists of international graduate students.\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology Virtual Tour\n\nInfrastructure\n\nSpread across four campuses in downtown Chicago, Forbes included the campus of Illinois Institute of Technology in its list of “America’s most beautiful college campuses”. In fact, the main campus (Mies Campus) of the school is on the National Register of Historic Places of the country. The campus also houses an independent, not-for-profit, contract research organization focusing on the life sciences.\n\nResiding Options\n\nThough the Illinois Institute of Technology offers campus accommodation, most students choose to live off-campus. This is because off-campus accommodation is much cheaper. A majority of students live near the city, even though it increases their travel time.\n\nFaculty and Pedagogy\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology has scholars, experts, researchers, and teachers who are passionate about imparting education and are dedicated to helping their students succeed. The Armour College of Engineering itself has 91 full-time faculties on staff.\n\nJobs and Placements\n\nDuring the first semester, students can get in touch with a Career Development Coach of the university to develop a career plan. They can then take the help of a resume guide to create a high quality professional resume. Students are also allowed to open a Handshake account for posting their CVs and going through the job listings.\n\nThe institute also organizes workshops to provide students with interview tips and more information about their possible career paths. The university also organizes events and job fairs for the benefit of the students.\n\nThe average salary of a Master of Computer Science graduate is $85,834; Master of Mechanical Engineering (MME) graduate, $81,313. MS graduates make on average $84,101 annually whereas Master of Engineering (MEng/ME) graduates make $75,626 annually on average. The boys make between $47,650 - $93,606 and girls make between $53,896 - $107,468. Around 565 pass outs from IIT found their jobs extremely satisfying and rated 5 out of 5.\n\nNotable Alumni\n\nSome famous alumni from Illinois Institute of Technology include :\n\nJack Steinberger, Corecipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino.\"\n\nValdas Adamkus, Highly decorated President of the Republic of Lithuania, who served two terms, the first from 1998 to 2003 and again from 2004 to 2009.\n\nJulius Hoffman, Presiding judge in the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial.\n\nDavid V.
