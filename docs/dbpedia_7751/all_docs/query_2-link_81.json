        "text": "Rankings are an ideology. Each is biased in its own way. So choose and combine existing rankings to generate your preferred meta ranking for computer science programs in the United States and Canada. Ranking sources represent: reputation (U.S. News* U.S. News provides data for universities in the United States and Maclean's provides data for universities in Canada ), faculty publications (csrankings.org* The rankings shown under the csrankings.org column may differ from their website because of different subfields and implementation of geometric mean count. ), academic placement (placement rank), and recognition (best paper awards). Use this to find the best computer science program for you in artificial intelligence, systems, or theory.\n\nby Alice Marbach, Jeff Huang, Long Do, Shaun Wallace, and others who contributed the original ranking sources."
