        "text": "The partnership will begin with new EON-XR solutions for Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nIRVINE, CA, November 18, 2021 – EON Reality, the global leader in Augmented and Virtual Reality-based knowledge and skills transfer for industry and education, announces a new partnership with Illinois Institute of Technology to forge a new hub for the knowledge metaverse.\n\nAs a private research university with over 130 years of history, the Illinois Institute of Technology’s passion for not only high-end technological solutions but also viable academic and technical skills training makes it an ideal fit as EON Reality’s latest partner in building the knowledge metaverse. Adding access to world-class XR solutions will enable them to bring their classrooms into the future of interactive teaching, regardless of subject, class size, or the variety of other factors that often impact schooling.\n\n“Illinois Institute of Technology has been working with cutting-edge technology, architecture, and engineering since long before XR solutions were ever even considered,” said Dan Lejerskar, Founder of EON Reality “Being able to help them modernize and bring their classrooms into the present day — and future — is a great honor for us. The university has done wonderful things on its own so far, and we look forward to seeing where we can help elevate them in the near future.”\n\nWith the new additions to the knowledge metaverse and EON-XR, Illinois Institute of Technology’s educators will be able to offer “hands-on” training to their students without the usual logistical restrictions in many forms of academic and vocational studies. By utilizing the solutions to teach immersive and interactive lessons using lifelike 3D models, Illinois Institute of Technology can provide the best possible academic experience for those on their campus as well as those studying remotely.\n\nWhile the initial partnership will focus on providing EON-XR solutions for students and faculty to introduce them to the knowledge metaverse, the hope is for the university to become one of the top contributors to the global project. Given Illinois Institute of Technology’s lengthy history and success in a variety of fields, EON Reality strongly believes that they could both utilize and create unique content even among the worldwide network of academic institutions.\n\n“We are delighted to collaborate with EON Reality in developing next generation learning experiences for our students,” said Peter Kilpatrick, Provost and Chief Academic Officer at Illinois Institute of Technology. “We appreciate and understand that the world of work and of higher education has forever changed as the physical and digital worlds continue to converge.”\n\nIllinois Tech’s history in distance education is long and storied as they were one of the first universities in the nation to pursue closed circuit television delivery of courses and degree programs through IITV in the 1970s.\n\nAbout EON Reality\n\nEON Reality is the world leader in Augmented and Virtual Reality-based knowledge and skills transfer for industry and education. EON Reality’s 21 years of success are tied to its belief that knowledge is a human right and should be available, accessible, and affordable for every human on the planet. To carry this out, EON Reality has developed the de-facto standard for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality-based knowledge and skills transfer software that supports devices from mobile phones to large immersive domes. EON Reality’s global development network — with more than 20 locations worldwide — has created the world’s leading AR/VR library for education and industry with over 8,000 applications and over 40 million users worldwide.
