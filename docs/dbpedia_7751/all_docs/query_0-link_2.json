        "text": "Dean Lawrence Kamen (born April 5, 1951) is an American engineer, inventor, and businessman. He is known for his invention of the Segway, as well as founding the non-profit organization FIRST with Woodie Flowers. Born to a Jewish family in Long Island, New York, he attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute, but dropped out before graduating after five years of private advanced research for the insulin pump AutoSyringe. He is the son of Jack Kamen, an illustrator for Mad, Weird Science and other EC Comics publications.\n\nOtis Frank Boykin (August 29, 1920, Dallas, Texas – March 13, 1982, Chicago, Illinois) was an African-American inventor and engineer.Boykin patented 28 electronic devices. One of his early inventions was an improved wire resistor, which had reduced inductance and reactance, due to the physical arrangement of the wire. Other notable inventions include a variable resistor used in guided missiles. His most famous invention was likely a control unit for the artificial cardiac pacemaker. The device essentially uses electrical impulses to maintain a regular heartbeat. He and his 3 friends died because of heart failure Boykin died of heart failure in Chicago of 1982.\n\nMartin \"Marty\" Cooper (born December 26, 1928) is an American engineer. He is a pioneer in the wireless communications industry, especially in radio spectrum management, with eleven patents in the field.While at Motorola in the 1970s, Cooper invented the first handheld cellular mobile phone (distinct from the car phone) in 1973 and led the team that developed it and brought it to market in 1983. He is considered the \"father of the (handheld) cell phone\" and is also cited as the first person in history to make a handheld cellular phone call in public.Cooper is co-founder of numerous communications companies with his wife and business partner Arlene Harris; He is co-founder and current Chairman of Dyna LLC, in Del Mar, California. Cooper also sits on committees supporting the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and the United States Department of Commerce.\n\nPaul Vincent Galvin (June 29, 1895 – November 5, 1959) was one of the two founders of telecommunications company Motorola. Founded as Galvin Manufacturing Corporation on September 25, 1928, Motorola became a leader in communications equipment. Galvin invented the mass production car radio, which provided the cornerstone of Motorola's early business. The company name \"Motorola\" was introduced in 1930. A little known fact was that Paul Galvin fired the engineer who designed the car radio, Howard Walker, for not following the original design, which was twice the size, but when Galvin released the car radio he used the engineer's smaller design."
