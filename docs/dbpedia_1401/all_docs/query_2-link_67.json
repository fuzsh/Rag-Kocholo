        "text": "Call me crazy or at least insanely ethical, but I don’t think local governments should be doing business with people who have relatives in positions of power on boards, councils, etc.\n\nCase in point ? Oxford resident Tracy Miller and his company Next Generation Computers, Inc.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, Miller is the husband of Oxford Village Council President Renee Donovan.\n\nIt just so happens that council last night awarded Miller a three-year, $38,485 contract to service and maintain the village’s 28 computer units (see page 5 for the story).\n\nTo be fair, out of the four qualified bids submitted, Miller’s proposal was the lowest.\n\nBut this wasn’t the first computer maintenance contract his company was awarded. Miller had previously secured a one-year, $12,329 contract from the village from July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.\n\nIn addition to these contracts, Miller has sold the village many new computers.\n\nMost recently, at the May 24 village meeting, council authorized the purchase of a new computer with 19-inch screen from Next Generation Computers and the reformatting of an existing machine for emergency purposes, all for an amount not to exceed $4,000.\n\nAgain, call me crazy, but does anyone else out there think it’s wrong ? or at least ethically questionable ? for the husband of the council president to be doing all this business with the village.\n\nGranted, Donovan abstains from every vote involving an expenditure of tax funds to Next Generation Computers. Abstention is the correct, proper and legal thing to do in this situation.\n\nBut still the whole thing doesn’t look very good. It smells funny. It looks suspicious on the surface.\n\nIt could appear to the public as though Miller has an inside track on the village council.\n\nDon’t husbands and wives typically tell each other just about everything? When you live, eat and sleep together in the same house, it’s hard not to.\n\nThe public could perceive that although Donovan doesn’t vote on the contracts and spending related to Next Generation Computers, her presence as council president is still an influence on its decisions.\n\nThen there’s the question of self-interest. A marriage is a 50/50 business partnership. If your husband is awarded a government contract from the council you serve on, don’t you profit as well?\n\nShould an elected official profit from business deals with the government he or she holds power in?\n\nIf I were holding an elected office, I would go out of my way to avoid any and all appearances of impropriety. I would make sure that neither I nor any members of my family or close friends did any business with the government I was serving in.\n\nIn politics and government, an elected official’s ethics should be beyond reproach. Perception is reality in politics, therefore even the appearance of any possible impropriety should be avoided at all costs.\n\nThe bottom-line is Miller shouldn’t be doing business with the Village of Oxford while his wife serves on council. He and Donovan should know better.\n\nIt reflects poorly on the village government. It reflects poorly on us all. It’s just not right.\n\nIn last week’s column, I vented my displeasure with the husband of the Oxford Village Council President being awarded a three-year, $38,485 computer maintenance contract with the village on June 14.\n\nI believe it’s wrong for Tracy Miller and his company Next Generation Computers, Inc. to do business with the village while his wife, Renee Donovan, sits on council.\n\nGranted, she abstains from all votes concerning Next Generation, but still it doesn’t look very good for the village to being doing business with a council member’s spouse.\n\nAnyway, there’s something I did not report in my column which I think is very important for my fellow village residents to know, something I learned after my column was out.\n\nBetween June 11, 2002 and June 10, 2005, Next Generation Computers has received a grand total of $157,907 from the Village of Oxford for 114 invoices concerning computer equipment, services, upgrades and maintenance.\n\nLet that number sink in for a minute ? $157,907.\n\nNow put it into context ? the husband of the council president has earned $157,907 from the village, from taxpayers, from you.\n\nAnd that $157,907 does not include the aforementioned $38,485 contract for the next three years.\n\nJoin me in a stroke won’t you?\n\nHere’s the breakdown of the $157,907:\n\nn In 2002, Next Generation was paid $3,973.\n\nn In 2003, Miller’s company received $63,079.\n\nn In 2004, Next Generation was paid $74,611.\n\nn So far in 2005, Miller’s company has received $16,244 from the village.\n\nI don’t care what justifications are used ? he’s the low bidder, he’s certified, he’s local, etc. ? this is 100 percent, flat out WRONG!\n\nOxford’s village council is no better than Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who loves putting his whole family on the government payroll.\n\nEven worse, we have council President Renee Donovan directly benefiting from that $157,907 worth of village business because as I said in last week’s column ? ‘A marriage is a 50/50 business partnership.?\n\nIn marriage, what’s mine is yours and what’s yours is mine, from the living room furniture to profits from the family business.\n\nIf it’s so important for Next Generation Computers to keep leaching off the village coffers, then Donovan should immediately resign from council.\n\nOr if Donovan’s position on council is more important to her and Miller’s political ambitions in the village (i.e. Miller’s convenient chairing of the cityhood effort), then Next Generation should discontinue doing any and all business with the municipality.\n\nIt’s time for Oxford’s Bill and Hillary to make a choice ? money or power.\n\nOxford Village taxpayers cannot afford for them to have both.\n\nAn on-line reader’s opinion\n\nReceived this letter about the Miller/Next Generation/Donovan issue via our on-line edition (www.oxfordleader.com). Because it did not contain a last name or phone number per our policy, it couldn’t be published as a letter to the editor. So, I thought I would share it with you in my column ?\n\n‘In response to C.J. Carnacchio’s article regarding ‘Tax Money and Spouses don’t mix.? My first thought was upon reading this was CONFLICT OF INTEREST!! It doesn’t matter if Renee Donavon ‘abstains? from every vote concerning ‘expenditure of tax funds to Next Generation Computers ? It still looks, smells and doesn’t feel ethically right. I tell my spouse everything, why wouldn’t they (Renee Donovan and Tracy Miller) do the same thing? Why do you think his bid was the lowest???\n\nWhich brings to mind another question, is that why their last names aren’t the same? So the ‘average joe shmo? village resident won’t know the difference?\n\nIf you are in a public office, albeit the relatively small one of Oxford, I think you should avoid anything that could potentialy be perceived as unethical, which is what this is. Oxford has had enough ‘scandal? regarding the public officals in the last few years, why would you want to incite more scandal??\n\nI would suggest passing an ordinance or law that would prohibit this kind of occurence in the future.\n\nSo, in answer to your question CJ, NO, you are not crazy for questioning this.\n\nSincerely,\n\n‘Not so average joe schmo? village resident\n\nShannon, 2005-06-16?\n\nNote to readers\n\nI will be on vacation from June 22 through July 8.\n\nAny news tips or story ideas, please refer them to Staff Writer Casey Curtis.\n\nKeep her busy while I’m gone. Thanks.\n\nI love good news.\n\nGiving it. Getting it. Creating it.\n\nIt’s all so. . . well, good.\n\nThat’s why I’m thrilled to report that Oxford’s service groups are coming through BIG TIME for Addison residents Pam Strunk and her disabled son Hunter, 8.\n\nYou may recall the Strunks from reading The Oxford Leader over the last few weeks.\n\nHunter has a rare brain disorder which has left him unable to walk, communicate or even feed himself. Caring for him is a 24/7 job for mom Pam who’s only able to work part-time as a result.\n\nTo help make their life a little easier, Pam has been trying to raise $16,200 to buy an electronic wheelchair lift for a special van.\n\nWhen the first story, skillfully written by Reporter Casey Curtis, appeared in the July 20 edition, Pam had managed to raise $10,000 at that point.\n\nAmerican Legion Post 108 and Oxford AMVETS then donated a combined $1,000.\n\nThe Oxford Public Library Friends (OPLF) also donated $1,000 bringing the grand total up to $12,000.\n\nIn last week’s edition, yours truly, as OPLF President, issued a challenge to Oxford’s numerous and generous service groups to contribute the remaining $4,200.\n\nI’m happy to report many have already answered my challenge. On Monday night, the Great Oaks Civitan Club voted to donate $1,000 to the Strunks.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the Rotary Club of Oxford voted to contribute $500 to the Strunks? cause.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Oxford/Orion Kiwanis Club agreed to give the Strunks $1,000.\n\nCombined, these three wonderful groups have agreed to donate $2,500. Only another $1,700 to go!\n\nI also got a call from Margaret Monprode, of Oxford/Orion FISH, who told me the charity group would be discussing a possible contribution to the Strunks at their August 11 meeting.\n\nI can’t tell you how pleased I am by this tremendous community-wide response.\n\nThis is really what life is all about when you get right down to it ? people helping people in need.\n\nTo other groups pondering a donation, remember to make the checks payable to ‘Mobility Works,? the Madison Heights-based manufacturer of the wheelchair lift. Pam does NOT want any of the checks made out to her. She wants all the money to go directly to the company.\n\nNone of this is about her personally gaining a thing. It’s all about her trying to enhance her son’s quality of life and her ability to continue caring for him.\n\nIs there anything more pure and unconditional than a mother’s love?\n\nBut enough of this mushy stuff, we’ve still got $1,700 to raise. Spread the word. Let’s do it people!\n\nMore Good News: Just as I was putting the paper to bed this morning I got a call from Brandon resident Elizabeth Green, who has a child in Oxford Schools. She wishes to donate $100. Thank you. $1,600 to go.\n\nFor years, I’ve said Oxford’s main problem boils down to this inescapable fact ? we’re one community with two governments.\n\nIf we were to think of Oxford as an individual, it would be someone with a split personality.\n\nTwo distinct personalities trapped inside one body, always warring, never allowing peace for the whole. The result is madness ? which if you follow Oxford politics is a pretty accurate description of the situation around here.\n\nThe only way to bring peace to the body is for one personality to govern all. The only way to bring peace to Oxford is for one government to oversee all.\n\nCityhood for the village will not bring peace to the whole because there will still be two governments occupying the same space. It will only cause more strife, more division, more conflict and more community-wide schizophrenia.\n\nBesides cityhood, much like divorce, only works if you have two entities and Oxford is one entity.\n\nIt may have two governments, but its people are one group sharing the same experiences in the same place. We share a common local history. We share parks. We share a library. We share a downtown. We share schools. We share a fire department. We share M-24 and traffic congestion.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, it’s the people of Oxford who form this community, not the five village council people or seven township board members.\n\nOxford is already one community where it counts, but if we’re ever going to end the fighting and the wasting of tax dollars on both sides, there needs to be one government.\n\nWhat follows is my blueprint for a single Oxford government ? a unified township government with a village area but no village government, no extra taxes.\n\nBecause some of my ideas represent a compromise ? a reconciling of various interests ? I’m sure there will be partisans on both sides of the fence who won’t like what they read.\n\nHere’s what my future Oxford would look like:\n\nGovernment ? The township board would become the only elected government in Oxford, responsible for levying taxes, enacting ordinances and formulating public policy that would apply to all residents equally. It makes sense because the township board is ? and always has been ? elected by both village and township residents.\n\nThe village council and administration would cease to exist as an extra layer of government.\n\nOne planning commission, one zoning board of appeals, one clerk’s department, one treasurer’s department, one building department, one planner, one engineer ? no more duplication, no more wasted tax money.\n\nPolice ? The Oakland County Sheriff’s Department would patrol all of Oxford. One community does not require two separate law enforcement agencies and an area as geographically small as the village certainly does not need its own police department.\n\nNot only is having two police forces for one area economically inefficient, it’s a sign of a community divided ? a community that can’t agree on something as basic as who should protect them. One community only needs one police force and in a unified Oxford that force should be the sheriff’s department.\n\nContracting with the sheriff’s department makes sense from an economic standpoint given the township’s police millage is roughly half of the village’s because it has a larger tax base to draw from. It also makes sense given deputies already patrol the township (which is considerably larger than the village) and the surrounding five townships.\n\nFire ? Oxford already has a single fire department serving all 36 square miles and all 18,000-plus residents equally. No need to change things or tinker with it. In short, if ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\n\nThe Oxford Fire Department would continue to do its job unfettered by political squabbling and posturing. The department has always served one Oxford, now it would be governed by one Oxford.\n\nDispatch & 9-1-1 ? Oxford would continue to operate its own local dispatch center for fire and EMS calls, but instead of being under the village police, dispatch would be run by the fire department.\n\nEven though Rochester Hills contracts with the sheriff’s department for police services, it maintains its own local dispatch through its fire department.\n\nLocal dispatchers have a better geographic knowledge of the area when it comes to streets and addresses, not to mention things that aren’t on maps such as local landmarks. Local dispatchers also know the firefighters they work with and the residents they serve. Dispatching within the community gives unique insights that can’t be gained from a console in Pontiac.\n\nDowntown Development Authority ? The absence of a village government does not mean the end of the downtown or the DDA.\n\nThe townships of Plymouth, Cascade, Northfield, Bangor, Oscoda and Clay ? to name but a few ? all have DDAs to promote and revitalize their downtown areas. If residents and business owners want to keep the Oxford DDA, there’s no reason they couldn’t under a township government.\n\nDepartment of Public Works ? Oxford doesn’t need a village to have a DPW, townships like Orion and Waterford prove that. There’s nothing to prevent the creation of a township DPW so village residents could retain the services they’ve become accustomed to such as timely snow removal (something the county Road Commission isn’t known for). Other township residents in Waterstone, Oxford Woods, etc. may also want the services of a DPW.\n\nIdentity ? Getting rid of the village government does NOT mean the end of the village.\n\nEliminating the village council doesn’t mean the downtown will suddenly disappear overnight. Cutting the village administration doesn’t mean all the historic homes on streets like Dennison and Park will instantly evaporate. Ending village taxes won’t undo 129 years of village history.\n\nThe village will always be the village. Having our own little government and paying an extra set of taxes to support it does NOT define who and what we are as a village. Just ask the residents of nearby Lakeville.\n\nLakeville is shown on maps. It has its own post office. It has signs telling visitors they’re in Lakeville. It has its own 175-year history.\n\nLakeville has a clear identity separate from Addison Township and Leonard. Residents tell people they live in Lakeville and people know where that is.\n\nAnd guess what? There’s no Lakeville Village Council and residents don’t pay any Lakeville property taxes. Lakeville doesn’t need its own government and neither does Oxford Village.\n\nGiven this week’s front page story (‘Cityhood leader convicted felon?), I thought I’d write a column to perhaps head a few letters off at the pass.\n\nTo me and many others, I believe it’s fairly obvious why Tracy Miller’s being a convicted felon who served nearly four years in Jackson State Prison is quite significant and newsworthy.\n\nBut there are those who will undoubtedly say ‘Well, that was 30 years ago, why does it matter now?? or ‘He served his time. Let it be.? or ‘He’s in Kiwanis and Civitan. He’s a good guy.? or my personal favorite ‘There goes that @#$%! C.J. again.?\n\nHere’s why it’s important for the public to know that Mr. Miller is a convicted felon.\n\n***\n\nONE ? By initiating and leading the village’s latest cityhood effort, Miller has made himself a defacto public figure and community leader.\n\nOver the last two years, Miller’s been working very closely with the village council to change the structure of government in Oxford, ultimately shaping the community’s destiny and our property tax bills.\n\nIt was at Miller’s request that council expended tax dollars to hire attorney Thomas Ryan to handle the legalities of trying to incorporate as a city.\n\nIt was at Miller’s request that council gave its blessing to the cityhood movement.\n\nMiller has a very, very close relationship with council, both politically and personally. His wife, Renee Donovan, has been on council since 2001 and currently serves as village president.\n\nCall me crazy, but the public has a right to know if the person working closely with officials to recreate their government and lead their community in a completely new direction is trustworthy, responsible and honest.\n\nBeing a convicted felon says something about a person’s character, whether it was 30 days, 30 months or 30 years ago. It’s the kind of thing that should raise questions and concerns no matter when it happened.\n\nGranted, Miller appears to be completely rehabilitated now and leading an exemplary life these days. But still the public has a right to know the man leading the charge for cityhood is a convicted felon ? after all it’s a matter of public record.\n\n***\n\nTWO ? Since 2002, the village has spent more than $157,907 on computer-related services, equipment, maintenance and upgrades from Miller’s company Next Generation Computers on Sunset Blvd. in Oxford Lakes.\n\nIn June, council approved a three-year, $38,485 computer services contract with Next Generation Computers. When all’s said and done, Miller will have transacted at least $200,000 worth of business the village, if not more.\n\nThe public has a right to know if the person the village is paying thousands upon thousands of tax dollars to is a convicted felon.\n\nMiller has a substantial financial relationship with the village and easy access to the village computer system. In light of this, his felony conviction for obtaining money by false pretenses is a legitimate piece of information the public definitely needs to know.\n\nWouldn’t you want to know if the person billing you for parts and labor was once convicted of a money-related felony? It makes sense to know exactly who you’re doing business with whether it’s in the public or private sector ? especially in government because all the money belongs to the taxpayers.\n\n***\n\nIn publishing the story on Tracy Miller’s criminal history, I’m in NO WAY, SHAPE OR FORM saying he’s a criminal now or engaged in any illegal activities whatsoever. I’m not making any accusations.\n\nI’m simply informing the public that a man with close political and personal ties to the village council is a convicted felon.\n\nI’m simply informing the public that a man who has a substantial financial relationship with the village is a convicted felon.\n\nI’m simply informing the public that a man who has frequent and easy access to the village computer system is a convicted felon.\n\nI’m simply informing the public that the man who’s leading the effort to radically change the structure of our local government is a convicted felon.\n\nIt’s up to the public to decide whether or not this information bothers them and merits any action.\n\nWhatever happens, the public has a right to know about Miller’s criminal past.\n\nPOP QUIZ ? What does Oxford Village’s cityhood committee have in common with the Sicilian Mafia?\n\nAnswer ? both live by omerta.\n\nOmerta is the code of silence practiced by the Mafia. It basically means keep your mouth shut ? if you know what’s good for ya.\n\nI ran into the cityhood committee’s version of omerta when I heard there was going to be a kickoff meeting for the cityhood petition drive Aug. 17.\n\nI heard about the meeting the day before from Oxford Township Supervisor Bill Dunn.\n\nIt seems Oakland Press reporter Sven Gustafson called Dunn that day to ask his thoughts on the upcoming meeting.\n\nDunn said he wasn’t aware of the little get-together and asked the reporter where it was going to be held.\n\nGustafson said he promised he wouldn’t tell.\n\nDunn made the point that in addition to being township supervisor, he’s a village resident with a stake in what’s going on with the cityhood effort.\n\nSworn to secrecy, Gustafson wouldn’t budge.\n\nAfter Dunn informed me about the top secret meeting, I called Tracy Miller, chairman of the cityhood committee, to find out if there was indeed a meeting and if so, where and what time.\n\nHere’s how that call went. Roll tape ?\n\nCarnacchio ? ‘I heard there’s going to be a meeting tomorrow night on the cityhood petition drive . . . a kickoff for that . . . Is that true??\n\n(LONG SILENCE)\n\nCarnacchio ? ‘Hello??\n\nMiller ? ‘Hello.?\n\nCarnacchio ? ‘Yes, it that true??\n\nMiller ? ‘I don’t know who you heard that from.?\n\nCarnacchio ? ‘I just heard that today, that’s why I was curious about it . . . So there’s no meeting tomorrow night??\n\nMiller ? ‘I didn’t say either way.?\n\nI thought about calling a few other people to try to ascertain exactly where the classified meeting was, but then I decided not to bother. If the leader of the cityhood movement didn’t want to even confirm there was a meeting, it obviously wasn’t worth my time.\n\nPetty people and their little secrets usually aren’t worth the aggravation.\n\nIt turns out there was indeed a petition kickoff meeting, but it’s location was still a closely guarded secret.\n\nMiller’s buddy Sven did a story about the cityhood kickoff in the Aug. 17 Oakland Press. Although the story stated the meeting was being held ‘tonight,? it still did not mention where or what time.\n\nI guess you had to know the password or the supersecret handshake to be invited to the clubhouse where the Sad Little People’s Committee meets.\n\nI find it interesting that the kickoff bash to change the village’s government and the whole community’s future was shrouded in mystery and cloaked in secrecy.\n\nSecret meeting places. Evading the local press. I guess the cityhood committee dusted off the Oxford Emergency Safety Authority’s (OESA) old handbook and took a few notes. Gary Ford would be proud.\n\nOpenness. Inclusiveness. Truth.\n\nThese concepts never found a home in our little village oligarchy ? and they won’t be welcomed in a city government either.\n\nBy the way, I’ve having my own secret meeting tomorrow night at an undisclosed ? and possibly imaginary ? location.\n\nIt’s so secret I’m not telling the people who are supposed to attend where it is or what time it starts.\n\nI don’t even know the time and place ? and I organized it. Now that’s a secret meeting!\n\nDarn it, I’ve said too much. Now I have to whack myself and dump my body in a gravel pit.\n\nIn just two days, I’ll be on the road to Oxford ? Oxford, Mississippi that is.\n\nMy wife Connie and I are heading down south as part of the ‘H2O ? Help 2 Oxford? water convoy leaving town at 6 p.m. Friday, Sept. 9 (see page 1).\n\nThe mission is simple ? get as much bottled drinking water as we can to Hurricane Katrina survivors in Oxford, Mississippi and beyond.\n\nAs a journalist, I’m excited about the prospect of chronicling this local response to a national tragedy.\n\nThis is an opportunity to capture a moment in history first-hand with my words and photos.\n\nAs a person, I’m grateful for the opportunity to help my fellow Americans, my fellow man in their time of greatest need.\n\nThis is the very essence of what makes our country great ? neighbor helping neighbor, community helping community, state helping state. You can see it all over the pages of this week’s Leader.\n\nFrom the Oxford Lakes kids who raised $1,142 for the American Red Cross to village resident Patti Hillebrand who’s collecting small personal items for hurricane survivors, the community is rallying.\n\nMovie theaters, churches, schools, local governments ? everyone is mobilizing to help.\n\nIn my own home, daughter Larissa and wife Connie spent Sunday, Monday and Tuesday going door-to-door collecting 2,290 returnable bottles and cans.\n\nTogether with cash donations, Larissa and Connie raised $276 for the ‘H2O? water drive. They also received five cases of bottled water from our generous neighbors.\n\nI’m very proud of my gals. They worked hard and got the job done.\n\nOxford’s response to this national tragedy is a perfect example of the true American spirit of self-reliance and personal responsibility.\n\nThis country was not founded by people who sat on their duffs and waited for some distant government authority to help them or others in times of crisis.\n\nOur forefathers didn’t circle the covered wagons and send smoke signals to FEMA.\n\nAmerica was founded by people who rolled up their sleeves and pitched in. People who donated their time, resources and sweat when one of their own was in need.\n\nFrom the Pilgrims to the Pioneers, the spirit of our country was cultivated by people who stuck together and weathered the bad times as a community.\n\nOxford’s efforts to help the survivors of Hurricane Katrina are merely an extension of this great American community.\n\nBeing a part of this water convoy to Oxford, Mississippi is a way to reconnect with what it truly means to be an American.\n\nAmericans are helpers. Americans are doers. Americans are united. Let’s keep this legacy alive.\n\nLook for my stories and photos from the road next week. If you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some packing to do.\n\nThe essence of the recent H2O water drive and convoy was one community helping another in a time of great need.\n\nBut for me, on a personal level, it was about one family pulling together to help others.\n\nI must say I’m quite proud of my wife Connie and daughter Larissa for the generous roles they played in H2O.\n\nLarissa collected more than $300 in returnable bottles and cans along with a few cash donations.\n\nAs a result, she was able to purchase and donate an entire pallet of bottled water ? 61 cases or 1,440 individual bottles ? from Meijer.\n\nShe also donated three bags full of her stuffed animals for kids who survived Hurricane Katrina and now have nothing to cuddle at night.\n\nI’m very proud of her selflessness and commitment to others.\n\nBuster Clark, Telecommunications Director for Ole Miss and coordinator of the university’s disaster efforts, was particularly moved by Larissa’s stuffed animals.\n\nBuster said he told his fellow hurricane relief volunteers, ‘I demand that special attention be paid to those three bags of stuffed animals from your daughter.?\n\n‘I want to make sure those things get handled with tender loving care and are distributed to the folks that really need them.?\n\n‘I thought about (her donation) all weekend. I even announced it in church last night.?\n\n‘If this doesn’t bring a lump to your throat or a tear to your eyes, your wood is wet,? Buster said. ‘I still get sorta choked up when I think about what she did.? So do I Buster. So do I.\n\nI’m also proud of my lovely wife Connie who made the arduous journey to Oxford, Mississippi with me in the Sherman Publications delivery truck.\n\nShe was a constant source of comfort, support, strength and laughter on the long, long, long, long, long, long, long drive.\n\nConnie’s not only a great partner in life, she’s a darn good copilot too.\n\nI also want to give a special thanks to Larry Paquin for taking over a good portion of my drive to Mississippi when my nerves, the fog and the semi-trucks finally got the best of me. You’re a lifesaver Larry.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nI love Halloween.\n\nBy far it’s my favorite holiday.\n\nCall me juvenile. Call me a Devil-worshipping Pagan who will burn in the fires of Hell for all Eternity, but I love October 31.\n\nAlways have, always will.\n\nWhat’s not to love about this holiday? You’ve got costumes, trick-or-treating, candy, pranks, haunted houses and spooky decorations.\n\nYou also don’t have any of the obligations, worries or stress generated by the other so-called holidays.\n\nNo gift shopping in overheated, crowded malls. No large family get-togethers with annoying relatives. No jolly fat guys, giant rabbits or Pilgrims.\n\nHalloween’s pure mindless fun, pure self-indulgence and pure greed. It’s a like a Libertarian Party meeting only everyone’s dressed better.\n\nAnyway, I thought I’d help out local youngsters ? and adults ? by giving them some costume ideas inspired by Oxford Politics. What could be more frightening, more horrifying, more gory?\n\nForget those Dracula, Darth Vader and Oprah costumes. Here are some much scarier get-ups:\n\nn Idea #1 ? Get yourself an old-fashioned prisoner’s uniform ? one with cartoonish black-and-white stripes, ball and chain for your ankle, etc. ? and a clipboard with some paper. While you’re trick-or-treating, ask people to sign your petition for Cityhood. This costume will get plenty of yuks in Oxford Lakes.\n\nn Idea #2 ? Dress up like an Oxford firefighter and have two friends wearing t-shirts ? one saying ‘Township,? the other saying ‘Village? ? pull on your left and right arms, while screaming, ‘Mine! Mine! Mine!?\n\nIf you think it’s hard trick-or-treating like this, imagine trying to fight fires or safe lives. Ask Fire Chief Jack LeRoy to help you master that combination look of depression and frustration he always has at every OPFEC meeting. Don’t forget the vacant stare, kids!\n\nn Idea #3 ? Put a recliner on wheels and have your parents roll you from house-to-house while wearing a dirty bathrobe and holding a remote control in one hand and a bag of chips in the other.\n\nWhen people ask you who you’re supposed to be yawn and say, ‘I’m an Oxford voter on election day.? Important ? don’t walk up to any porches to get your candy, make them bring it to you. Part of the costume is being too lazy to move and too apathetic to care.\n\nn Idea #4 ? Using poster board, make yourself a sandwich board sign with one side reading ‘Township Tax Bill? and the other saying ‘Village Tax Bill.? The only thing scarier than a giant walking tax bill is TWO giant walking tax bills.\n\nWhen trick-or-treating, be sure to demand double the amount of candy everyone else is getting. After all, you’re collecting for two governments. If someone refuses to pay up, threaten to take their house.\n\nn Idea #5 ? Put on a pair of rose-colored glasses and tell everyone how wonderful things are going in downtown Oxford. In a sickeningly sweet voice tell people, ‘I’m the DDA and everything’s a-okay!? If someone disagrees, threaten to send them to a Main Street reeducation camp, I mean ‘workshop.?\n\nn Idea #6 ? Use some rusty scrap metal to create a Polly Ann Trail bridge costume. Try to make yourself look as ugly and useless as possible. Glue a bunch of play money to your outfit to represent all the tax dollars being wasted on you. Have a friend dress up like a Dog Catcher and accompany you to every house, singing your praises and bullying people who don’t like you.\n\nWell those are my ideas.\n\nI guarantee these costumes will get loads of laughs, offend all the right uptight people and make you stand out from the usual droves of witches, ghosts and goblins.\n\nRemember, Halloween is only one scary night, but the true horror that is Oxford Politics lasts all year long!\n\nI know I won’t sleep tonight.\n\n‘The arrogance of age must submit to be taught by youth.? ? Edmund Burke\n\nAnyone who knows me personally or through my writing knows I’m not a believer in Utopian schemes.\n\nLife is simply too complex for one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\nNothing in this world is perfect, most of all its people, therefore it’s impossible to craft the perfect solution to any or all our problems.\n\nA conniving snake and a rotten apple cost us the only true Paradise on this miserable ball of mud.\n\nPolitical thinkers like Rousseau, Hegel and Marx spawned delusional revolutionaries like the Jacobins, Fascists and Communists whose attempts at turning the State into a Panacea ended in guillotines, gas chambers and gulags.\n\nAs a Burkean conservative, I know all too well that there exists no political formula to solve all the world’s ills, no flawless form of government and no system by which men can become gods or even angels.\n\nThat’s why I had to chuckle when Oxford Township Trustee Sue Bellairs wrote a letter to the editor last week stating the following ?\n\n‘So why is it some people (including the editor of this paper) think that all problems will be solved if Oxford becomes ‘ONE?? That being ‘ONE? is synonymous with living happily ever after??\n\nI’ve NEVER said or written that creating One Oxford will magically solve all of our problems. I’m philosophically incapable of arguing any man-made scheme will lead to perfection, especially anything that has to do with government.\n\nAll government is created equal ? equally bad, equally incompetent and equally detrimental to our liberty and our pocketbooks. In my book, 99.9 percent of public officials are scoundrels by nature.\n\nHere’s what I do believe becoming One Oxford in terms of having one government could accomplish ?\n\nn No more having two governments fight it out with us, the taxpayers, caught in the cross-fire, footing the bill for two sets of lawyers. No more Oxford v. Oxford on the docket.\n\nn Less government in terms of the actual number of elected and appointed officials. Less legislative and recommending bodies. Less meetings. Less employees. Less overhead, period. Right now, we have two layers of everything including taxes.\n\nHere’s some simple math ? 2 governments minus 1 government equals less government.\n\nn All issues become community issues. No more ‘That’s a village issue? or ‘That’s a township issue.? We view problems as community problems and tackle them as a single community. No more geographic or political boundary lines to divide us.\n\nWill this One Oxford be perfect? No.\n\nWill this One Oxford solve all our problems and answer all our prayers? No.\n\nWill this One Oxford allow us to all live ‘Happily Ever After?? Only if our charter is written by Mother Goose and our government led by Prince Charming.\n\nDoes this One Oxford have the potential for less conflict and less strife? Yes.\n\nDoes this One Oxford have the potential for more effective and more efficient government? Yes.\n\nDoes this One Oxford have the potential to allow us to focus less on our differences and more on making this better a place to live, work and play? Yes.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with Bellairs that you need to elect better leadership if you want better government.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s often easier said than done.\n\nToo many good people are content to do nothing.\n\nToo many power-hungry, greedy, dishonest and stupid people are eager to fill the leadership vacuum.\n\nBut if one of your main problems is poor leadership occupying two governments, doesn’t it make sense to at least get rid of one government as a start to fixing the problem?\n\nAt least then your leadership is only half as bad ? sad and comical, but true.\n\nIt’s true Oxford needs better leaders, but it also needs LESS government. Only a fool would argue that maintaining two governments for one community leads to efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nWe need LESS government at all levels. The local level is as good a place as any to start chipping away at the Leviathan.\n\nThe First Amendment is truly a beautiful thing.\n\nNot only does it protect freedom of speech, religion and my favorite, the press, it also protects the right of the people ‘to petition the government for redress of grievances.?\n\nIn other words, if I’ve got a beef with something my government is doing, I and my fellow citizens can petition officials to change things.\n\nI can pound the pavement collecting signatures from like-minded individuals in an effort to bring about reform or put a stop to something I believe is wrong.\n\nThat’s true everywhere in the United States ? except for the People’s Republic of Oxford.\n\nLast year, 520 Oxford residents signed a petition opposing construction of the infamous Polly Ann Trail bridge over M-24.\n\nThe Polly Ann Trailway Management Council politely accepted and filed the petitions. The great and powerful Dog Catcher himself, Larry Obrecht, even met with a few residents to put on a modern day medicine show with the bridge standing in for snake oil.\n\nOne year later, the bridge is going to be installed sometime this month and those petitions are somewhere either collecting dust or lining dog kennels down at Oakland County Animal Control.\n\nIgnored were 520 voices. Pushed aside were 520 opinions. Brushed off were 520 citizens.\n\nLast week, the Oxford Village Council voted 4-0 to deny any further action regarding village resident (and township Supervisor) Bill Dunn’s 358-signature petition calling for an ordinance to stop village officials from spending anymore tax dollars on cityhood and requiring a vote of the people before anymore action is taken regarding incorporation as a city.\n\nThe petition was denied due to a bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo (see story on Page 1) cooked up by the village’s legal team. Of course, the village’s lawyers are against this proposed ordinance because it would de-rail their taxpayer-fueled gravy train.\n\nMy favorite reason council cited for the denial was the fact that the ‘initiative process set forth in Chapter VIII of the village charter is invalid because it is not authorized by state law.?\n\nIn other words, the petition process outlined in the village charter, the process which Dunn followed to the letter in the hopes of enacting his proposed ordinance either through council action or a vote of the people, is not sanctioned by law.\n\nFunny, the charter has a section clearly spelling out exactly how citizens can petition for the enactment of a village ordinance and what council must do in response to such a petition, but apparently it’s all a huge waste of time, a load of bunk.\n\nBut why is it in the charter?\n\nI wonder what else in the village charter is not authorized by state law?\n\nVillage officials and their mindless little Amen Chorus undoubtedly scoffed at the petitions and discounted them because they were passed around and filed by the township supervisor.\n\nBut let’s not forget the fact that 357 village residents OTHER than Bill Dunn agreed with the proposed ordinance and signed the petition.\n\nThat’s pretty hard to ignore.\n\nMore people signed that petition than vote in village elections. Nobody on that council has ever received 357 votes. I doubt 357 residents can name all five council members.\n\n*** It’s interesting to note that the pro-cityhood petition submitted to the State Boundary Commission had 346 signatures (not yet reviewed or deemed valid) ? 12 signatures LESS than Dunn’s petition. ***\n\nOnce again a citizen-driven petition signed by hundreds of Oxford residents has been relegated to the political trash heap by local officials with their own agendas.\n\nWhat have I deduced from all this? Petitions don’t mean squat in Oxford. They’re a complete waste of paper and ink.\n\nYou can draft them. You can circulate them. You can sign them. You can file them.\n\nBut in the end, your voice, your opinion, your vision for the community’s future is irrelevant to Oxford officials. Unless it matches their political views, then they’ll use tax dollars to hire a lawyer to help you succeed in your mission ? especially if you’re an official’s spouse.\n\nOxford government’s motto ? ‘Just pay your taxes and shut the heck up. Unless you wish to praise us, agree with us or defend our lies and unethical behavior, then by all means speak up! Lackeys welcome!?\n\nI’m so disgusted with the political cronyism, favoritism, arrogance, lies and wasteful spending around here, I’m going to start a petition proposing that Oxford officials be exiled to the bad part of outer Mongolia.\n\nI’ll circulate it on rolls of toilet paper, that way it will be easier for officials to flush when I file it.\n\nA petition using old Mr. Whipple’s precious Charmin is certainly appropriate in this case.\n\nWhether we want it or not, the Polly Ann Trail bridge over M-24 is coming.\n\nConstructed of steel, concrete and our money, the bridge will forever be a visible and constant reminder that we pay way too much in taxes to Washington D.C.\n\nIt will remind me of how Orion officials (who didn’t want a bridge in their town) and Leonard officials (whose lips are surgically attached to Larry Obrecht’s fanny) pushed this monstrosity on us.\n\nIt will remind me how Oxford officials (both village and township) sold us out ? you treacherous swine.\n\nThe only good I can see coming from this pork barrel project is the high-spirited skateboarders, roller-bladers and free-style bikers of Oxford will finally get that giant ramp park they’ve been hoping for.\n\nFinally, something for ‘the children.?\n\nWith roughly 400-foot concrete ramps on each side of the bridge, all I can say is ‘Have a ball kids! Don’t forget to visit the pound and thank your Uncle Larry.?\n\nBut enough of my bitterness and negativity, we’re stuck with the bridge, so we might as well name the Thing. Something that big, that costly, that ugly, certainly deserves a name befitting its status.\n\nHere are some ideas I thought up and stole from a few other people:\n\n? Obrecht’s Folly\n\n? Dog Catcher Crossing\n\n? Bridge Over Troubled Highway\n\n? Pork Barrel Bridge\n\n? The Bridge that Stupidity and Apathy Built\n\n? The Arrogant Arch\n\n? Oxford’s Eyesore\n\n? The New Skate Park\n\n? Falling Rocks Bridge\n\n? Falling Garbage Bridge\n\n? A Bridge Too Much\n\n? While Oxford Slept\n\n? What The #&%$ Is That?\n\n? How Leonard and Orion Shafted Oxford\n\n? The Bridge Orion Didn’t Want\n\n? Tomb of the Overworked Taxpayer\n\n? The Monument to Misused Millions\n\n? Another Reason to Move\n\n? Why Dynamite Was Invented\n\n? Saint Pooper Scooper’s Pathway\n\n? Bridge to Nowhere\n\n? Another Reason to Stop Paying Taxes\n\nBut I alone shouldn’t be the one to name this bridge. After all, it belongs to the good people of Oxford.\n\nIt’s not Larry’s bridge. It’s not the Polly Ann Trail’s bridge.\n\nIt’s our bridge.\n\nKinda of gives you a warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of your colon doesn’t it?\n\nSo, I decided to start a ‘Name the Bridge? contest.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned in my six years here it’s this ? Oxfordites are a creative and funny bunch of folks when given enough time, the proper motivation and lots of alcohol.\n\nI’m sure if we all put our heads together, we can come up with an appropriate name for this . . . this . . . whatchamacallit.\n\nLike all contests, I need to set forth a few simple rules as written by my lawyers from the firm Nasty, Poor, Brutish and Short:\n\n? No profanity as these will be published in a family newspaper. Names using swear words will not be printed, however, they will be privately enjoyed by myself and a few close friends.\n\n? No names seriously meant to honor or thank Larry Obrecht or the Polly Ann Trailway Management Council in any way, shape or form. All you weasels and suck-ups can start your own contest.\n\n? No names over six words in length. It’s a name, not a dissertation. Save it for your novel, Hemingway.\n\n? Make sure the name is funny. Bounce it off your family, friends and co-workers. Don’t rely on your own sense of humor ? you might not have a good one.\n\nE-mail your bridge names to shermanpub@aol.com. In the subject line write ‘Attention C.J. Bridge Names.?\n\nOr mail your ideas to The Oxford Leader, 666 S. Lapeer Road, P.O. Box 108, Oxford, MI 48371. Again, send them ‘Attention C.J. Bridge Ideas.?\n\nLast Minute Note: Just heard King Kwame I won re-election. The moronic voters of Detroit deserve what they get ? and they deserve to get it good and hard! Somewhere in Hell, Coleman Young is smiling.\n\nNow listen carefully . . .\n\nMet Republican gubernatorial hopeful Dick DeVos last week when he stopped in Oxford to chat.\n\nMy initial shoot-from-the-hip impression ? bland, uninspired, nothing to write home about, kind of looks like the late actor Don Adams of ‘Get Smart? TV fame.\n\n(Note: Reporter Casey Curtis pointed out the whole Don Adams connection. See photos right.)\n\nNothing personal. Mr. DeVos seems like a very nice, respectable gentleman with good intentions and a highly successful track record in the business world.\n\nBut the guy struck me as ‘Dick Posthumus Part II? ? and we all know sequels are usually worse than originals.\n\nHe didn’t really say anything unique or particularly insightful. He didn’t strike me as a passionate man. He didn’t make me want to run right out and vote for him.\n\nOf course, neither did Posthumus, but that was more of a vote against Mistress Granholm.\n\nDick Posthumus had all the charisma of drift wood attending an insurance salesmen’s convention in Omaha, Nebraska in late January. Yikes!\n\nDeVos didn’t seem any more lively.\n\nDeVos believes we have to make Michigan more competitive. Who doesn’t?\n\nHe wants to attract new businesses and investment opportunities to the state. Nothing new there.\n\nHe said the auto industry is going to continue to have problems and face pressures. No kidding.\n\nDeVos said people all around the state are worried about jobs and the future. Duh.\n\nDeVos believes there are too many complicated state regulations and government gives many business people the run-around. Double Duh.\n\nOh, by the way, Michigan’s economy is awful.\n\nI didn’t hear anything new. I didn’t hear how he’s going to reform our current situation.\n\nTo be fair, he did say he’s still working on specific plans which will be released later.\n\nOverall, he struck me as more of a vote against Governatrix Granholm than for him.\n\nBut I’m tired of voting against people.\n\nI want to vote for someone.\n\nAs a conservative Republican ? sometimes Libertarian ? voter, I’m tired of the Bob Doles, Dick Posthumuses, Spencer Abrahams and other dull party hacks we trot out at election time.\n\nThe GOP’s become like a Baskin Robbins that only sells 31 flavors of vanilla.\n\nI want someone bold. Someone with solid ideas and the iron will to make them happen.\n\nI want genuine reform, which means dramatically cutting the size and scope of Big Government ? eliminating entire departments, converting to a part-time state legislature, selling off unnecessary state-owned properties, axing deadwood state employees, etc.\n\nI want to elect someone who wishes to divest the government and himself (or herself) of power and tax money, not gather more.\n\nI’m afraid unless DeVos shows me something more, something worth fighting for, I might be tempted to mark that Libertarian space on the ballot again.\n\nSorry about that Chief.\n\n*** Bridge Names Contest Update ***\n\nPotential Polly Ann Trail bridge names have been rolling in along with lots of compliments on the column (many thanks). Here are some of my favorites:\n\nFrom Jim Sherman, Sr. ? 1) Ramp it up for Larry O.; 2) If you can find a better ramp, Obrecht will buy it.\n\nFrom Bill Savage ? 1) You Should Have Seen the Losing Design!; 2) Portal to Idiocy; 3) Kick Me\n\nFrom Rob Guzanek ?

Keep them coming!\n\nWhen the time is right, I will announce the winner and present him or her with a special prize and put their mug in the newspaper. It’s all so exciting!\n\nA lot of people have asked me what I think of the possible development of the Koenig gravel property into Springwood Park. Many have asked when I would write a column on this hot topic.\n\nWell, now that something substantive has been publicly presented ? not formally submitted mind you ? I feel it appropriate to share my thoughts.\n\nFirst off, density.\n\nThe proposed 2,757 residential units ? while down from the 3,500 to 3,600 originally bandied about ? is still way, way too much.\n\nWith that kind of density, Springwood Park would be bigger than monstrous Waterstone by roughly 900 units. Yikes!\n\nIf each unit has an average family ranging in size from two to four people, we’re looking at increasing Oxford’s population by another 5,514 to 11,028 people.\n\nThat means more calls to the fire department. More calls to the sheriff’s department. More kids in our schools. More people using our parks and library. More people needing NOTA.\n\nThe result ? more and more tax money needed to expand public services, hire additional employees and build new facilities. Progress isn’t cheap.\n\nIt’s just too much for the existing community to absorb. Too drastic of an impact on Oxford and its already beleaguered taxpayers.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the traffic ? oh the traffic.\n\nWith an average of two cars per unit, we’re looking at another 5,514 vehicles (most likely annoying SUVs operated by clueless drivers) inching their way down M-24 and our other congested roads.\n\nAt least downtown Oxford’s alleged parking problem will finally be solved. M-24 will be transformed from busy state highway to mega parking lot ? no need for more traffic lights or hideous bridges.\n\nI’d also like to take issue with a few of the ideas presented in the Springwood Park plan.\n\nTake the proposed 5-acre strip center in the southwest corner, which was described by Jack Carnahan, of Biltmore Properties, as a ‘neighborhood service type thing? with businesses such as a dry cleaner and pizza joint.\n\n‘With this many people, if everybody decides to go for pizza in the evening, we thought it would be a little silly to have them have to drive all the way into town, and go up and down M-24,? Carnahan said at the Nov. 10 planning commission meeting.\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I think the existing businesses, especially those struggling downtown, very much want all those new people to ‘drive all the way into town.?\n\nI think Guido’s Premium Pizza in the Oxford Mills shopping center would appreciate some extra hungry families on a Friday night. I think Mia’s Cleaners in the Oxford Marketplace would welcome some new customers bearing dirty laundry.\n\nNew residential development should enhance and benefit existing local businesses, not bring in its own strip center so the new people can completely ignore the town merchants whose tax dollars are helping to pay for their arrival.\n\nBy the way Mr. Carnahan, we already have five pizza places in Oxford and most of them deliver.\n\nI’d also like to address the issue of all the land Springwood Park’s potential developers are willing to set aside for the public good.\n\nThis includes 25 acres for an elementary school/community center/recreation area (complete with four soccer/multipurpose fields), 5 acres for a senior center and 2 acres for a fire station.\n\nVery generous indeed, but who’s going to pay for the new elementary school’s construction?\n\nWho’s going to pay to build the community center? Who’s going to pay for the senior center?\n\nWho’s going to pay to install and maintain the recreation fields? Who’s going to pay for the new fire station’s construction?\n\nThe taxpayers, that’s who. You and me.\n\nSure the developer will pick up the tab for the land, but the bricks and mortar will be mixed with the blood and sweat of Oxford taxpayers. All that land equals more bond issues and more millage proposals.\n\nIt’s inevitable the 1,169-acre Koenig site will be developed at some point. That’s pretty much a given, unless some well-to-do anti-development crusaders decide to put their money where their big mouths are and buy all the land for permanent preservation.\n\nTruthfully, I don’t mind the Koenig property being developed. After all, it’s a just gravel pit, not a majestic Brazilian rainforest.\n\nYou never see any ‘Save the Gravel Pit? t-shirts at environmentalist wacko rallies.\n\nBy the same token, the Koenig site does NOT have to be transformed into another Waterstone plus 900 homes. It does NOT have to become another mini-city within the township.\n\nIt can be smaller. It can be less dense, less intrusive. It can be less of a burden on the taxpayers and existing community. It can be manageable.\n\nI think the general public ? not just the usual fringe elements ? need to make their feelings on this issue known to Oxford Township’s Planning Commission and Board of Trustees.\n\nAttend some meetings. Write some letters to the editor. Talk to your neighbors. Stay informed.\n\nDon’t wait until plans are approved and the first houses are being constructed to start complaining.\n\nWell, once again it’s time for the famous ‘Swami C.J.? to make his New Year’s predictions.\n\nGather round my crystal ball as I call upon the spirits of my Bar and go into a deep trance.\n\nOm . . . Om . . . Om . . . Another Martini please . . . Om . . .\n\nIt’s coming to me . . . yes, I can see 2006 so clearly!\n\nHere are my predictions ?\n\nPrediction #1 ? In an effort to keep Addison’s atmosphere rural and save money, employees at the township offices are replaced with chickens, cows and pigs.\n\nSupervisor Bob Koski said the new employees are great because they work for feed and when its time for them to retire, you can eat them.\n\n‘It’s the right thing to do and a tasty way to do it,? Koski said.\n\nPrediction #2 ? Oxford’s new Polly Ann Trail bridge over M-24 is finally completed.\n\nDuring the dedication, Larry Obrecht stuns the audience by donning a Roman-style toga and Laurel Wreath while riding a large white stallion across the bridge, lined with rose petals for the ceremony.\n\nSpooked by the 100 royal trumpeters, the mighty steed throws the Lord of the Canines over the side.\n\nFortunately, Obrecht lands on his Ego and suffers no injuries.\n\nObrecht immediately blames the local Press for the whole incident and orders his minions to ‘Release the hounds!?\n\n(**The above is dedicated to the memory of John Elsarelli who passed away Dec. 27. We spent many an hour in his Oxford Village office poking fun at the useless bridge and the even more useless Obrecht. I’ll miss you John. Wherever you are, I hope you read this and have a good laugh.**)\n\nPrediction #3 ? Oxford Township’s new municipal hall is built at last.\n\nUnfortunately, cost overruns coupled with delusions of grandeur push the cash-strapped township into bankruptcy, forcing the municipality to sell its new 14,024-square-foot building to a shady private developer from Nevada.\n\nA few months later the facility reopens as the ‘Lone Ranger Casino? featuring nightclub acts in the ‘Gravel Pit Lounge.?\n\nPrediction #4 ? The entire Oxford DDA board heads to a Main Street workshop in the Caribbean when their charter plane mysteriously vanishes somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nA month goes by before anyone in Oxford notices the DDA is gone. Meanwhile, business activity in the downtown increases 200 percent, convincing local officials to decide against sending a search party.\n\nPrediction #5 ? The sad state of Michigan’s economy has prompted the Oxford Area Chamber of Commerce to take immediate and drastic action to aid local businesses in this time of need.\n\nAt an emergency meeting, Chamber board members boldly decide to hold four luncheons each month and organize eight golf outings a year.\n\nWhen asked how this will help local businesses, a Chamber spokesperson replied, ‘It won’t, but at least our members will be well fed and relaxed when it comes time to file for bankruptcy. Excuse me, I have to tee off.?\n\nPrediction #6 ? Leaders of Oxford Village’s cityhood movement realize they need help pulling the wool over residents? eyes so they enlist experts in the field of exploiting the gullible.\n\nCitizens for Cityhood solicits aid from the Church of ScientologyTM, Amway and NASA (because we all know those guys faked the 1969 moon landing).\n\nHowever, the cityhood committee’s plans fall through during a Town Hall meeting when actor Tom Cruise begins jumping up and down, and screaming at the audience about how the evil intergalatic dictator Xenu created the township form of government to enslave our ‘thetans? (spirits or souls for those unfamiliar with ScientologyTM mumbo-jumbo).\n\n‘Only cityhood can save you from Xenu’s evil township beast!? yelled Cruise as men in white coats dragged him away. ‘L. Ron Hubbard be praised!?\n\nCityhood leaders hope they have better luck with their next speaker ? Democratic leader Howard Dean.\n\nThe visions are fading now.\n\nThe spirits are leaving me.\n\nQuick ? refill my cocktail shaker!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\n‘One can make this generalization about men: they are ungrateful, fickle, liars, and deceivers, they shun danger and are greedy for profit; while you treat them well, they are yours. They would shed their blood for you, risk their property, their lives, their sons, so long, as I said above, as danger is remote; but when you are in danger they turn away.?\n\n? ‘The Prince? by Niccolo Machiavelli\n\nI’ve often wondered what would have happened if Superman said to the people of Metropolis, ‘You know what ? why don’t you save yourselves for once? I’m kinda tired right now.?\n\nI wonder if Superman ever did grow weary of constantly helping people who won’t help themselves ? people content to always sit on the sidelines and never get involved.\n\n‘Go get’em Superman!? the craven mob cheers. ‘We’ll be waiting for you right here, big guy.?\n\nImagine you’re the person everyone runs to with their problems and they expect you to solve them, while they sit on their butts and do nothing.\n\nIt’s got to grind you down eventually.\n\nI find many people are cowards by nature.\n\nThey’re big talkers behind closed doors when the world isn’t listening. They’ll tell you who the bad guys are and how we should get rid of them. They get all fired up, ready to crusade against the Forces of Evil.\n\nBut when the time comes to take a stand, speak up and do the right thing, they’re conspicuously absent. Later, their excuses are many and varied, but they all usually revolve around concerns for their own security and comfort.\n\nThey figure someone else will do the work, someone else will right the wrongs. Besides, there was a new American Idol that night.\n\nThis is why government is corrupt, sloppy and incompetent at all levels. People know who and what the problems are, but they don’t want to do anything about it.\n\nDoing something means taking risks and facing challenges. Doing something means setting yourself apart from the herd. Doing something can mean facing a long, difficult road with consequences that aren’t always pleasant.\n\nSo, 99 percent of people are content to do nothing and hope the other 1 percent is enough to change everything from the entire world to their own little village. Well, guess what? It’s not.\n\nYou can be the greatest general in history, but if you have no army willing to fight, you will win no wars.\n\nYou can be the greatest philosopher of Western civilization, but if you have no disciples to spread your teachings, you will have no lasting influence.\n\nOne person can change the world, but only if there are people willing to follow, willing to sacrifice, willing to bleed a little. If not, you’re only one person.\n\nThink about that the next time you start complaining about your local government and all the bad things going on in your community.\n\nAnd if you’re not ready to stand up and be counted, then sit down and shut up ? play to your strengths.\n\nI’ve often said when Larry Obrecht talks you better have a shovel or two handy.\n\nWell, being the wonderful alleged human being he is, Obrecht is trying to sell the Polly Ann Trail Management Council (PATMC) six, count them six, shovels for only $1,439.\n\nWhat a deal! I’m sure Monty Hall would be proud.\n\n(See page 1 for the story.)\n\nWords cannot even begin to describe what an enormous and irresponsible waste of tax dollars this will be if the trail council agrees to repay the Dog Catcher for his glorified pooper-scoopers.\n\nFirst of all, these six over-priced shovels were an unauthorized and unbudgeted for expense that ol? Larry took it upon himself to purchase without council’s prior approval.\n\nI say let Obrecht eat the cost, not taxpayers. He wanted them so bad, he can pay for them. He’s making more that $70,000 a year playing Dr. Doo Little for the county. He can afford his fancy shovels.\n\nSecondly, Obrecht wants the trail council to pay $1,439 for brand new shovels they don’t even have possesion of.\n\nObrecht told the PATMC he borrowed six ceremonial shovels from a construction company for the August 2005 trail project ground-breaking. In exchange, he purchased six new shovels for the company and kept the ones he borrowed.\n\nDoes that make any sense at all?\n\nTaxpayers are being asked to pay for brand new shovels that Obrecht already gave away. But don’t worry, we get to pay $1,439 for the old ones. Sounds like Bait and Switch to me.\n\nThirdly, Obrecht wants to have these used shovels engraved and given away as gifts to bigwig donors like DaimlerChrysler who ponied up $250,000 for the trail surfacing and M-24 bridge.\n\nBut donors like DaimlerChrysler don’t want some stupid engraved shovel that will ultimately sit in the back of a supply closet collecting dust.\n\nCorporations don’t donate to causes out of the goodness of their hearts (they have none) or because they actually care about people and communities. They donate money for publicity and tax write-offs.\n\nImage and money are everything to corporations. Nobody cares about shovels. The only time a shovel is useful to a big corporation is when they need it to bury a company whistleblower in the woods.\n\nLast, but not least, let’s not forget we’re talking about six chrome-plated shovels that are only used for photo ops and cost $220 each (plus tax and delivery).\n\nLet me say this again ? six shovels for $1,439.\n\nAnyone who doesn’t think that’s absolutely insane is insane.\n\nAnyone who believes this is a perfectly reasonable expenditure of tax money not only should never hold an elected office, they shouldn’t be allowed to vote, drive a car, breed or wear shoelaces.\n\nHere in the real world people are losing jobs (i.e. the Ford plant in Wixom), taking pay cuts and scrimping to pay their rising heating bills.\n\nMost people are scrambling to find new ways to live on less and less. Others have nothing left and are seeking assistance from groups like Oxford/Orion FISH to feed their hungry families.\n\nIn these hard economic times, how dare the Polly Ann Trail Management Council even consider wasting $1,439 of taxpayer money for something as trivial, useless and just plain silly as ceremonial shovels.\n\nWhat arrogance! What blatant disregard for the hard-earned money we pay in taxes!\n\nOf course, what should we expect from a group that thinks $1.3 million for a bridge over a state highway is the deal of the century. I have some ideas about where they can stick those shovels . . .\n\nFUNNIEST QUOTE OF THE WEEK\n\n‘But at least I’m honest. You know where I stand.? ? Larry Obrecht to Polly Ann Trail officials.\n\nSteve Allen’s abrupt and sudden exit from the Oxford Village Council last week opens the door for some dedicated resident to serve their community.\n\nGranted, I’m always leery of resignations and appointments on governing boards because it’s the officials, not the voters, who choose the replacements.\n\nOften times, appointments are given to people who are easy to control, won’t rock the boat or are already on board with the governing body’s current agenda.\n\nThere’s nothing democratic about hand-picked yes-men.\n\nPuppets serve their masters, not the public.\n\nBut this time I choose to be optimistic about the vacancy on council.\n\nI won’t indulge in ‘wild, unfounded speculation? that a new council person will be selected behind the scenes over lunch at Red Knapp’s.\n\nI won’t be choked with fear that a former loyal village insider ? like retired clerk Rose Bejma for instance ? will be selected to keep the council clubhouse off limits.\n\nI won’t toss and turn at night bothered by the prospect of another Stepford Council Person being appointed to uphold the status quo and keep dissent to an acceptable minimum.\n\nI won’t wake up in a cold sweat after dreaming the village president’s hubby gets appointed in order to further tighten his political and financial grip.\n\nNope. I’ll have none of that.\n\nInstead, I prefer to believe that the village will be flooded with applications for Allen’s empty seat.\n\nAs a I write this, I imagine an army of eager candidates converging on the village offices armed with resumes, a desire to serve others and the passion to bring about true reform.\n\nI imagine all those people who have constantly complained to me over the years about the village council ? many of whom live in my neighborhood ? crying out, ‘This is my chance to change things! This is my chance to do something instead of just whining all the time!?\n\nI imagine council spending countless hours interviewing the sea of candidates.\n\nYes sir, things are going to be different this time.\n\nNew faces. New voices. New hope.\n\nIt’s all going to happen with this empty council seat.\n\nI can feel it in the pit of my stomach . . .\n\nThen again, it could just be gas.\n\nWe’ll see.\n\nGot a Rolaid?\n\nHow to apply\n\nResidents wishing to fill the remainder of Allen’s term, which expires in September 2007, may send resumes and/or letters of interest to the village offices at 22 West Burdick Street.\n\nApplicants must be at least 18 years old, a registered voter and resident of the Village of Oxford for at least six months.\n\nFor more information about the vacancy call village Clerk/Assistant Manager Christine Burns at (248) 628-2543.\n\nIf you were low on funds or flat broke, would you mail letters out telling everybody?\n\nWould you spend money on postage, paper and envelopes to let the world know your wallet’s empty and your bank account has a flashing ‘vacancy? sign?\n\nOxford Schools did.\n\nA February 7 letter was mailed from Superintendent Virigina Brennan-Kyro to all parents and guardians informing everyone the district is ‘once again facing a budget deficit? due to ‘Michigan’s sluggish economy and rising costs.?\n\nStop the presses!\n\n‘Up to this point, shortages have caused the district to ‘tighten its belt? and become more efficient, much like what has happened in your own homes,? Virginia wrote.\n\nDifference is when the public tightens its belt it’s because bills are high and people are going hungry.\n\nGranted, Virginia’s sob letter was sent via bulk mail ? the cheapest way to send things through the good ol? fashioned U.S. Post Office ? but still, do we really need to waste tax dollars on postage to let everybody know the schools are out of money?\n\nDo we really need to waste precious paper that could be better used in classrooms? That could have been thousands of worksheets for little Johnny and Susie.\n\nOnly government spends money to advertise the fact it has none.\n\nIn spite of the letter, a majority of parents were already quite aware of the district’s money problems. They read about it all the time in the newspapers.\n\nTrust me, there’s been no shortage of stories about the schools? shortage of funds. The media’s provided plenty of free publicity about this issue.\n\nRather than mailing out thousands of individual letters, it would have been smarter to publish it as a letter to the editor in the Leader, Oakland Press and Oxford Eccentric ? that way all the bases are covered.\n\nI would have been happy to publish it as a ‘School Zone? column. I think that would have made for a more informative piece than last month’s worthless fluff ? ‘January is School Board Recognition Month.?\n\nPut the letter on the district’s website. Or e-mail it.\n\nHave Virginia read it on Oxford Community Television (Channel 19).\n\nThe point is mailing out thousands of letters was a blatant waste of tax money at a time when the schools are telling us things are bleak and every penny counts.\n\nPractice what you preach.\n\nGood job Mr. Bishop/Sorry about the council seat\n\nThumbs up to Oxford Village resident Chris Bishop for speaking out at last week’s council meeting about Next Generation Computer’s questionable relationship with the village.\n\n(Perceived conflict, Renee? How about painfully obvious conflict! Marriage is a 50/50 partnership in life and profits from your husband’s business.)\n\nBishop ? who has applied for the council seat vacated by Steve Allen Jan. 24 ? spoke his mind, spoke the truth and in doing so, clearly rattled the cage of village President Renee Donovan. Unfortunately Chris, you rocked the boat and most likely shot yourself in the foot.\n\nGovernment is the only place where honesty, integrity and ethics are not appreciated or rewarded.\n\nSpineless, eager to please, controllable and blind loyalty ? that’s what makes a council person.\n\nFirst, Oxford Village Councilman Steve Allen resigns in January.\n\nThen, two weeks ago, village President Renee Donovan announces she will resign to pursue drag racing at her new home in Lapeer County.\n\nEnjoy the Wal*Mart up there, Renee. It’s got everything!\n\nResignation fever is definitely in the air and I’ve caught it. I hereby announce that at some undetermined point in the future I will resign as editor of The Oxford Leader.\n\nNo, I’ve not been fired ? don’t believe all those silly rumors floating around town.\n\nI’ve just decided to kick back, take it easy and pursue my family’s hobby ? alchemy!\n\nYes, before I came to Oxford, I spent many years trying to turn base metal into gold in my laboratory deep inside my parents? basement.\n\nSome people believe alchemy is a load of bunk, a fake, a sham.\n\nBut I assure you it’s a reality and alchemists were real scientists, not nomadic charlatans who roamed from town to town lying, cheating and bilking people out of their money.\n\nIn fact, I have a doctorate in alchemy from B.S. University.\n\nUnfortunately, pursuing my old hobby will force me and my family to move out of Oxford Village due to zoning ordinances which prevent me from releasing toxic fumes from my experiments into the air.\n\nGranted, my neighbors have been wonderful and not complained one iota ? even when neighborhood pets started dying off after I boiled that vat of mercury. Sorry about that.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy decision to leave my job and Oxford.\n\nAfter all, it’s not like I’m some common criminal jumping in my getaway car because the heat’s on.\n\nI laid down roots in Oxford. I got involved with quite a few service groups ? covering them, I mean ? and made a very good living in my business.\n\nHeck, I was even thinking about putting in a pool this year.\n\nChoosing a successor for me won’t be easy. But, I’ve numerically ranked some candidates to help the Shermans select my replacement.\n\nI wanted to choose someone who agrees with all my views and won’t radically change the newspaper when I’m gone.\n\nWell, I guess that’s it.\n\nI will formally submit my letter of resignation in about 20 years, but I just wanted everyone to be prepared.\n\nIf anyone is interested in buying some of my gold when I perfect the formula, just send a cashier’s check for $10,000 to my new post office box in Nigeria.\n\nI’ll ship your nuggets out right away.\n\nAs more and more hard-working Michiganders lose their jobs while the state’s economy circles the drain, wouldn’t it be nice if some politicians lost their jobs?\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if the Fat Cats in Lansing got pink slips just like GM and Delphi employees?\n\nRight now, I’m thinking of 38 political whores whose bloated heads should be ripped out of the public trough and their pork-filled butts tossed into the streets with the rest of the rotting garbage.\n\nThis ‘Gang of 38? is commonly known as the Michigan State Senate and they’re hopefully in danger of becoming extinct. Why? Because a brave group of concerned citizens out of Hastings, Michigan started a movement called ‘Unicameral Michigan.? Visit them at www.fire-the-senate.com.\n\nThis group wants to dissolve the state Senate and have only one body ? the 110-member state House ? serve as the legislature. This is what’s called a ‘unicameral legislature? (as opposed to our current ‘bicameral? one) and Nebraska has been governed by one since 1937.\n\nReducing costs, eliminating duplication and increasing accountability are the benefits of getting rid of the state Senate, according to Unicameral Michigan’s website. And I must say I agree.\n\nHaving a single house would save the state $80 million in its first year and $1 billion in the first 10 years, according to Unicameral Michigan.\n\nWe the taxpayers are currently paying for each of those 38 state senators to have a $135,000 per year salary/benefits package, plus a $1,000 per month expense account. And don’t forget the protected retirement pension which allows senators to become vested after only a few years in office.\n\nAll this for a body that’s nothing more than governmental duplication at its worst.\n\nYou see the state House and Senate represent the same populations and have identical responsibilities and duties.\n\nIt’s not like U.S. Congress where representation in the House is based on population and seats in the Senate on geography (two per state).\n\nAt the federal level, a bicameral legislature serves to balance and protect the interests of both the large and small states, as the Founding Fathers intended.\n\nAt the state level, a bicameral legislate serves only to fatten the bank accounts of our senators and unnecessarily increase the cost of government to the taxpayers.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that California, a state with 30 million people, is represented by a 120-member legislature. In Michigan, a state of 9 million people, we’re represented by a total of 148 legislators (both chambers combined).\n\nWe have way too much government in Michigan and it’s killing our state economy. It’s either the Senate or us!\n\nA ballot initiative is currently underway to amend the state constitution to eliminate the useless Senate. All that’s required to put it on the November ballot is 317,000 valid signatures by July 17.\n\nI plan to sign. I hope you’ll join me.\n\nLet’s stop talking about throwing the bums out and actually do it this time!\n\nWhen the 56 men we now call the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence, they did so knowing they were also signing their own death warrants should the colonial rebellion against England fail.\n\nDespite the cold shadow of the gallows looming over them, none of them chose to sign that famous document of defiance as ‘Anonymous? or ‘Name Withheld Upon Request? or even ‘Overtaxed in New Hampshire.?\n\nThey all bravely and proudly signed their names with Massachusetts representative John Hancock making his signature the largest and boldest of the group.\n\nI find it strange that the Founding Fathers under possible penalty of death found the courage to sign their names, yet a good number of people who send letters to the editor to this newspaper do so hiding under the cloak of anonymity.\n\nAnd today’s writers have a protection and right the Founding Fathers did not enjoy in July 1776 ? our beautiful First Amendment.\n\nFrom unsigned to ‘Concerned Citizen? to ‘please withhold my name,? there are an awful lot of people who don’t want to stand behind their opinions or see their names in print.\n\nTo me, if someone’s not willing put their name on their opinion, it’s worthless ? not worth writing, not worth reading, not worth knowing.\n\nHow can a writer expect their opinion to sway readers to a certain position or stir them to action, if they won’t even stand up for their beliefs by simply signing their name?\n\nLetters to the editor bearing no writer’s name ? or ‘Signed, Anonymous? ? generally get read by myself, then pitched in the trash can. Unless there’s a name and phone number, it doesn’t get printed.\n\nSometimes we will withhold a name at the writer’s request, however, that’s up to my discretion and there had better be a genuine reason.\n\nIf you’re a government or school employee looking to blow the whistle or complain about the administration and are fearful of reprisals, such as losing your job, I’m willing to withhold your name.\n\nIf a writer has a legitimate fear for their safety or their family’s safety, I will withhold a name.\n\nBut if a writer doesn’t want their name included for some silly reason, unjustified worry or ‘just because,? then I won’t withhold it. And unless they agree to put their name on it, the letter won’t be printed.\n\nIt’s easy to spout off like a Big Shot, when you think nobody knows who you are. Only cowards find courage in the shadows.\n\nBut it takes real conviction to put your opinion out there for all to see with your name in big, bold print.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with my columns, I put my name and face on every last one of them ? and nobody’s burned my house down, blown up my car or kidnapped me in the dead of night.\n\nSo, if you’re thinking of writing a letter to the editor, sign your name and phone number. Stand up for what you believe. Let people know who you are and what you’re thinking.\n\nOtherwise keep it to yourself. My garbage is full.\n\nI would love to build a walk-in humidor and fill it with boxes of the finest Cuban cigars.\n\nI would love to drive an expensive Italian sports car on my way to the airport to catch a flight aboard my private jet.\n\nI would love eat choice Kobe beef and fresh Maine lobster every night of the week.\n\nAll these things would be just swell, if I were rich. But, I’m not.\n\nI’m a humble journalist. I understand and accept my financial limitations.\n\nI hope Oxford, Addison and Orion will understand their financial limitations too as this ‘Older Persons Center? survey (see Page 11) makes its way around the three townships.\n\nIn case you missed it, right now volunteers with the ‘Older Persons Task Force? are distributing surveys asking people’s opinions about the possibility of building and operating a combined senior center to serve North Oakland County. Their goal is to collect 360 surveys from each township\n\nThe idea of a massive multi-community senior center with all the bells and whistles sounds appealing at first ? until you get the bill.\n\nSurvey Question #3 asks people to rate on a scale of 1-5 if they would be willing to vote for a bond to construct a ‘first-class facility? with a tax averaging 1.53 mills over 10 years.\n\nSurvey Question #4 asks people to rate on the 1-5 scale if they would be willing to approve a tax of ‘less than 0.2 mills annually? to operate this facility.\n\nMy answer to both is a BIG NO.\n\nYou would have to be crazy to add another nearly 2 mills to our already high tax bills. In case the Task Force hasn’t noticed, houses aren’t selling around here, people are losing their jobs and taking pay cuts, and Michigan has the worst economy of any state in the nation.\n\nGreat time to suggest a massive building project with a big tax hike.\n\nTaxes aside, I don’t think we need a Taj Mahal senior center like the 90,000-square-foot Older Persons Commission in Rochester that cost $18.5 million to build about three years ago.\n\nI think some of the local politicians driving this have a bad case of ‘Rochester Envy.? I also think some of them are looking to get their names in the paper so they can keep a lock on that all important senior citizen vote.\n\nLooking at Question #1 on the survey which asks people to rate on a 1-3 scale how important certain services are to their household, I think we can ? and do ? have many of them without building our very own Xanadu. Here are the services on the survey:\n\n*** Health and Wellness/Medical Screenings ***\n\n(exercise facilities, flu shots, blood pressure checks)\n\nThe Oakland County Health Division already does local flu clinics. County nurses also visit individual homes and senior centers like the Vets Hall in Oxford and the township complex in Addison.\n\nAs for local fitness/exercise opportunities, there’s the Polly Ann Trail, numerous parks, PowerHouse Gym, HealthQuest, Great Lakes Athletic Club, etc.\n\n*** Transportation ***\n\n(medical appointments, shopping, social activities)\n\nWe already have the North Oakland Transportation Authority (NOTA) which handles transporting seniors with its fleet of vans and buses. We don’t need a big senior center to house NOTA.\n\nAlso, Oxford/Orion FISH has volunteers that provide transportation to medical appointments.\n\n*** Adult Day Care Services ***\n\n(stroke recovery, Alzheimer’s care)\n\nI’m sorry, but providing these types of services are not and should not be the responsibility of taxpayers. Caring for the elderly in these situations is a matter best handled by individuals, families and private entities/facilities, not taxpayers.\n\n*** Programs ***\n\n(activity rooms, arts & crafts, computer help, library, performing arts, education, recreation, enrichment)\n\nWhy do we already pay taxes for a public library along with a parks and recreation department?\n\nIf these entities aren’t meeting local seniors? needs, perhaps they should expand the range and scope of their services to better accommodate older people?\n\nWe also have an expensive new high school in Oxford complete with swimming pool and Performing Arts Center (PAC) ? both of which are open to residents of all ages.\n\nI’m sure senior swim times and a senior community theater group wouldn’t be too hard to establish.\n\n*** Outreach Services for Families ***\n\n(home-bound services, help with medical care, information and equipment)\n\nThere are already plenty of county, state and private agencies that handle outreach services. We don’t need to add to them at the local level and create more redundancy on the taxpayers? dime.\n\n****\n\nThe bottom-line is a combined senior center for Oxford, Addison and Orion townships is a LUXURY, not a necessity like police, fire, roads, schools, etc.\n\nIt’s a luxury that certainly does not merit raising property taxes by nearly 2 mills.\n\nIf the well-to-do taxpayers in the City of Rochester, Rochester Hills and Oakland Township who finance the OPC want that luxury, they are welcome to it.\n\nThe majority of people up here aren’t wealthy and certainly shouldn’t be forced to pay for such a luxury.\n\nI hope stupid isn’t contagious.\n\nIf it is, the Addison Township Board should be quarantined and the public-at-large should avoid their meetings lest their brains turn to mush.\n\nOnly Addison officials ? who have done nothing but whine, moan and complain about their money troubles lately ? could refuse private donations designed to help their residents.\n\nTreasurer Dan Alberty and Supervisor Bob Koski recently secured close to $3,000 in private donations to help fund the township’s Annual Spring Clean Up Saturday, May 13.\n\nUsing these donations, the township could have avoided charging their residents $25 per load to dump their big junk ? refridgerators, air conditioners, hot water heaters, tires, etc.\n\nBut instead, township officials, led by trustees Claudia VonDrak and Christine Sypitkowski, decided they wanted to stick to their guns and still charge residents because that’s what the board had previously agreed to do. See the story on page 5.\n\n‘The plan was always to charge the residents X-number of dollars,? VonDrak said. ‘Paying to get garbage and things picked up is part of what we do when we live in a country.?\n\nSypitkowski said not charging residents would be ‘kind of negating? previous board decisions ‘made not that long ago.? She then suggested charging residents half of the $25 fee.\n\nWaiter, I need two orders of Common Sense for the ladies. To me, one of a public official’s main jobs is to SAVE their constituents money. In this instance, VonDrak and Sypitkowski failed miserably.\n\nThe bottom-line here is a government function, half of which could have been paid for with private donations, will still cost Addison residents $25 per load because Addison officials are, oh, what’s the word ? stubborn, illogical, bone-headed, moronic, lacking in the old IQ department, pig-headed, high on their own egos . . . Take your pick, they all apply.\n\nHow a government body can deliberately choose to charge (i.e. tax) their residents for something that someone else is willing to pay for is beyond me.\n\nLesson #1 ? Whenever government can get something beneficial for the community without charging residents, it should do it.\n\nLesson #2 ? Whenever government can get something beneficial for the community thanks to the generosity of private donors, it should do it.\n\nObviously, Addison officials missed those lessons at the last Michigan Townships Association convention. Must have been a long line at the buffet.\n\nI would urge Addison residents to NOT participate in this year’s Spring Clean Up as a political protest. Stay home!\n\nSave your junk or find somewhere else to dump it this year. Leave your garbage on the roadside or set it free in Addison’s Watershed Preserve. (Just kidding, I would never advocate illegal dumping.)\n\nHere’s an idea ? tie a big red bow on your old water heater and give it to VonDrak as an early Christmas gift. Or how about this ? bring your old refrigerator to Sypitkowski’s medical office in Lake Orion and leave it in her waiting room. Just tell the receptionist your big white friend has a cold.\n\n(Again, my lawyers have advised me that I’m just kidding.)\n\nDon’t pay the township one single penny!\n\nIt seems like there are awards for everyone and everything these days.\n\nOscars. Emmys. Nobel Prizes. Pulitzer Prizes. Golden Globes. People’s Choice. Kids Choice. MTV Movie Awards. Tonys. Grammys.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the coveted ‘Dancing with the Stars? mirror ball trophy. (Stacy Keibler was robbed.)\n\nEverybody loves awards. We love to give them. We love to receive them.\n\nWe love to watch the glamorous, star-studded awards shows where celebrities (like liberal moron George Clooney) pat themselves on the back for four hours.\n\nDrawing on this inspiration, I’ve decided to start my own local award dedicated to wasteful government spending.\n\nIt’s called the ‘Flushie? and it’s given to government entities who spend tax dollars in ways equal to simply flushing them down the toilet.\n\nIn order to win a Flushie, the wasteful spending must be a significant dollar amount, blatantly obvious to those with common sense and have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\n\nIn other words, the net result of spending the tax money must be exactly the same as if officials went into the old restroom and began flushing money down the crapper, sending it to Kwami Land.\n\nI’m proud to announce that the first ever Flushie goes to ? may I have the toilet paper roll please ? the Village of Oxford and Oxford DDA for their continuing lawsuit against Nathan Grove over the parking property he owns in the northeast quadrant.\n\nYes, the village and DDA have already lost the case in two courts, but they’re willing to go for broke ? literally ? by asking the Michigan Supreme Court to hear why they should be allowed to rob Grove of his property rights.\n\nSo far, the village and DDA have spent more than $72,000 on this case. And if their Supreme Court bid fails, they will also have to pay Grove’s attorney fees as well. With what you may ask? More tax dollars!\n\nBut I can’t fault the village and DDA for listening to attorney Bob Bunting. After all, look at all the major cases he’s won for the village over the years.\n\nBunting was the attorney who helped navigate the former Oxford Emergency Safety Authority through the troubled seas of scandal and controversy.\n\nUhhh . . . maybe that’s not a good example.\n\nOkay, I’ve got one. Back in 2002, Bunting forced the township to repay village residents all the property tax money collected from them and supposedly spent on police services from the Oakland County Sheriff’s Department.\n\nWhat’s that? Oh, he didn’t? Nobody got a penny?\n\nYou say the village sheepishly settled for an internal shuffle of township funds despite all the official rhetoric and chest-pounding about each village resident getting a rebate check. Moving on . . .\n\nOkay, how about the township’s lawsuit to dissolve the Oxford Public Fire and EMS Commission. Surely the Mighty Bunting soundly defeated that baseless action and sent the evil township packing.\n\nNo? He didn’t? You say the township won and now controls the fire department. Yikes!\n\nSo, exactly why do village officials continue to listen to and pay for Bunting’s advice?\n\nMaybe they’ll explain it during their acceptance speech when they pick up their Flushie.\n\nThe runner-up for this year’s Flushie award is Oxford Area Community Schools for continuing to hold its annual election in May, instead of November.\n\nWhy reduce or even eliminate election costs by holding them in November, when you can pay big bucks by holding them in May?\n\nAfter all, the May option is the ‘most expensive date,? according to Oakland County Clerk Ruth Johnson.\n\nBesides, it’s not like the district is consistently suffering budget shortfalls every year forcing cutbacks which affect students on a daily basis.\n\nIt’s not like parents and taxpayers are constantly being told the school district’s financial situation is bleak and we’re in crisis-mode.\n\nIf that extra money isn’t spent on the May election, it could end up somewhere else ? like the classroom.\n\nWorking at this newspaper for the last seven years I’ve received plenty of threats from the cowardly and the ignorant.\n\nThreats from people who watch too many television legal dramas and think they understand terms like libel and slander.\n\n(By the way Oliver Wendell Clueless, libel is written and slander is spoken.)\n\nThreats from family members who wish to protect the criminals their defective gene pools have spawned and inflicted on society.\n\nThreats from politicians, lawyers, the mentally ill, parents, teenagers, law enforcement officers, the list goes on and on.\n\nBut I don’t respond well to threats. Threats don’t scare me or make me back down. Threats just make me angry ? especially when they’re anonymous.\n\nIf you’re going to threaten someone you should have the courage to do it face-to-face or at least leave a name and phone number where you can be reached. Ms. Manners really should write an etiquette book about how to properly threaten people.\n\nLast week, I received an anonymous threat on my office voicemail. The cowardly individual called at 6:44 p.m. Thursday, May 25.\n\nHis call/threat appears to be in regard to our coverage of the 16-year-old Oxford High School student charged with breaking into the school district’s maintenance garage twice, setting a fire there and breaking into the Oxford Public Library.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the 18 suspected explosive devices found in the teen’s basement on Pontiac Street and three jars of ‘napalm-like substance? discovered in his backyard.\n\nStories about this incident have appeared in numerous newspapers and on television newscasts since then. Even WRIF’s Drew and Mike discussed it on their morning radio show.\n\nBut this cowardly caller, who sounded like an older male, warned me and The Oxford Leader to stop covering the story or else. Here’s what he said verbatim, poor grammar and all ?\n\n‘Hi C.J., this is, uhh, not important who I am. All you need to know is whoever’s following this story on the student at Oxford High School, if that story is not stopped being covered, you guys will lose a good amount of your people who order your paper and there will be problems. Have a nice day.?\n\nSince I don’t know exactly what the phrase ‘there will be problems? is alluding to, I saved a recording of the voicemail and notified Lt. Tom Parker, of the Oakland County Sheriff’s Department’s Oxford substation.\n\nTo the craven person who left this message, I just wanted to let you know that neither I nor this newspaper will ever be threatened, intimidated or harassed into not covering a story that affects this community.\n\nThe story about this OHS teen’s alleged crimes and suspected bomb-making activities will be covered to its conclusion. It’s news that affects the schools, parents, students and the public in general.\n\nNeither I nor this newspaper will ignore what’s going on in the community or bury our heads in the sand because someone who’s only brave over the phone or hiding in the shadows makes a threat.\n\n‘The trouble with eating Italian food is that five or six days later you’re hungry again.?\n\n? George Miller\n\nA few years ago I penned a column waxing poetic about my very first dining experience at the then newly opened Palazzo di Bocce in Orion Township.\n\nDining there for the umpteenth time this past Saturday has motivated me to once again put pen to paper in tribute to a truly magnificent meal.\n\nBeing Italian I’ve eaten a lot of lasagna in my life. I mean a lot. At home. At restaurants. At family gatherings. Riding in the car. A lot more lasagna than your average person not descended from the Boot.\n\nGiven my gastronomic expertise in this area, I feel qualified to state unequivocally that Palazzo di Bocce’s lasagna is by far the best I’ve ever had or will have in the future. Sorry grandma.\n\nIt’s literally like eating pure joy, if joy was filled with cheese ? which I believe it is.\n\nSix layers of homemade noodles. Five different cheeses. All surrounded by a lush red sea of Bolognese sauce (i.e. meat sauce).\n\nYou can choose a meatless Pomodoro sauce instead, but I’m a Bolognese man myself.\n\nNo skimpy portions here. Each perfect piece is super thick and extra wide. It crowns the plate with majestic authority.\n\nTo eat it is to pit the immovable object against the irresistible force ? my appetite.\n\nThe first bite is like a loving embrace.\n\nThe second, third and fourth bites are like climbing your way to the top of a roller coaster.\n\nDevouring the rest is a blur of pure ecstacy.\n\nEach bite fills you up completely, yet makes you want more and more. It’s a delicious cycle.\n\nWhy do I suddenly feel the need for a smoke?\n\nI felt guilty eating this legendary lasagna in front of my poor Irish wife Connie. It felt like I was cheating on her. In a way, I was.\n\nYou see, like many Italians, I equate food with love. Judging by the size of my ‘spare tire,? I’ve loved quite a bit in my life.\n\nIf Connie had asked me to choose between her and Palazzo’s lasagna during my feeding frenzy . . . well, let’s just say I’d still be sleeping on the couch.\n\nA man’s mistress can take many forms. Mine just happens to be baked in a pan.\n\nIf that sounds sick to you, all I can say is try Palazzo’s lasagna before you judge me. Let he who is without sin cast the first meatball.\n\nYou can’t possibly understand my passion for that six-layered lady until you’ve indulged in all she has to offer.\n\nIf you’re married, go to the restaurant alone and ask to be seated at an out-of-the-way table so nobody you know can spot you.\n\nWear dark glasses just in case.\n\nIf you see me eating there, play it cool and just walk on by.\n\nI never saw you. You never saw me.\n\nIt will be our little secret.\n\n‘I didn’t leave the conservative movement, the conservative movement left me.?\n\nI find myself saying that to more and more people these days.\n\nEspecially with all the pseudo-conservatives controlling the Republican Party these days. The party of Goldwater and Reagan is dead.\n\nIn the last major election, I voted Libertarian because the choice between Republicans and Democrats these days is the difference between Hitler and Stalin. In the end, the result is the same with either party ? decreased liberty, increased government and the further demise of the republic.\n\n‘We are all Socialists now,? observed a British Liberal leader in the late 19th century.\n\nWell, not me. I haven’t given in. This is one conservative who still believes in the hands-off, limited government the Founding Fathers had in mind.\n\nHere’s my manifesto for a better America.\n\nI BELIEVE:\n\nn The job of the federal government is to mint money, defend the borders and administer justice. Anything else is unconstitutional. Return power and discretion to the individual states. End the welfare state and federal imperialism for good.\n\nn I believe the income tax, property taxes, estate taxes and a host of other taxes and so-called fees should be abolished in favor sales taxes. Want to make taxation fair? Base it on consumption!\n\nn It’s not government’s job to oppress people for ‘their own good? through overregulation and excessive taxation. If you want to smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, eat fatty foods, not wear a seat belt or motorcycle helmet and own a gun, you should be able to. Live and let live. Leave people alone. Mind your own business.\n\nn Only elect politicians who want to repeal existing laws, abolish government agencies, cut taxes and divest themselves of power.\n\nn Not every problem or perceived problem requires a new law or government action. Instead of running to the government like children asking their parents for help, people should find private solutions, work things out for themselves. Cooperation, volunteerism and private funds can solve more than the coercive force of government.\n\nn Christianity should not be twisted and debased by turning it into a political ideology. Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, the Christian Coalition and the rest of that ilk are money-grubbing, power-hungry demagogues who pervert Christ’s message for their own purposes. Christianity should be the healing voice of salvation, love and righteousness, not the political weapon of hypocrites and charlatans.\n\nn If you don’t like what’s playing on television, at the movies and on the radio, don’t watch or listen. Don’t dictate to others what their entertainment should be. We should all be free to choose how we enjoy ourselves.\n\nn Don’t tinker with the U.S. Constitution by passing useless, unnecessary amendments such as those seeking to criminalize flag burning or define what marriage is. Pet issues designed to win votes or satisfy a political base should not become amendments to that sacred document. Don’t forget Prohibition weaseled its way into the Constitution and was later repealed.\n\nn Don’t sacrifice your liberty to gain so-called security. Yes, terrorism is a threat to our safety and security, but cowardly people willing to give up their civil liberties so Big Government and Big Brother Bush can protect them will bring about the end to our way of life faster than Osama bin Laden ever could. It’s better to die on your feet then live on your knees.\n\nIn 1993, I fell in love.\n\nShe comes in all shapes and sizes. Her exotic o"
