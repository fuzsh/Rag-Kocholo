        "text": "Friday, November 07, 1997 Page:\n\nBloomsburg’s Hale nears hardy record\n\nAfter four years away from the sidelines, Danny Hale found himself longing\n\nfor a coaching comebackHe never thought his return would challenge the most\n\nfamous name in Bloomsburg football history.\n\nBut by the time Bloomsburg ends its battle with West Chester on Saturday,\n\nHale could find himself alone at the top.\n\nThe soft-spoken head coach needs just one more victory to raise his career\n\ntotal at Bloomsburg to 39, which would be the most attained by a Huskies coach\n\nin the 1900s. A.K. Aldinger amassed 51 victories in 10 years coaching\n\nBloomsburg, but worked there from 1894 to 1898 and again from 1901 to 1905.\n\nCurrently, Hale shares the modern record with Robert B. Redman, the man\n\nafter whom the school’s football stadium is now named.\n\nRedman coached Bloomsburg to 38 victories from 1947 to 1951.\n\n“Pretty good name there to be associated with,” Hale said.\n\nDon’t expect Hale to start doing cartwheels when he attains the record,\n\nthough. He’ll be too busy looking ahead.\n\n“I really haven’t thought about it,” Hale said. “Don’t even want to think\n\nabout it. That’s something you want to think about when you look back.”\n\nA look into his past shows it would be ironic if Hale accomplishes the feat\n\nSaturday.\n\nA West Chester graduate, Hale coached the school to five winning seasons in\n\nthe 1980s, winning the PSAC East championship in 1986 and 1987 and leading the\n\nGolden Rams to the 1988 NCAA Division II playoffs.\n\n“That was a program where if you do things the right way, you should win\n\nsome games,” Hale said.\n\nBut after the NCAA playoff berth, Hale had personal differences with the\n\nWest Chester administration. He left the program, and promised his wife he’d\n\nstay away from the college sidelines.\n\nFor four years, Hale kept it, until she urged him to grab the headsets\n\nagain.\n\n“I guess after she had me for four years, she told me, `Go back to\n\ncoaching!’|” Hale laughed.\n\nHe did, and Bloomsburg’s been better off for it. What’s more, he’s guided\n\nBloomsburg to victory in all four meetings with his old West Chester team.\n\n“I do love it here,” Hale said. “It’s been a great school for me. I feel\n\nfortunate.”\n\n* * *\n\nCONFERENCE QUEST: With two losses, this year is highly unlikely to include\n\na postseason for Bloomsburg.\n\nBut the Huskies can accomplish an impressive goal.\n\nNo team has ever won four consecutive Eastern Division championships in the\n\nPSAC, and Bloomsburg could become the first by beating division rivals West\n\nChester Saturday and East Strousburg next week.\n\n“That’s our goal as a team, to go for that,” Hale said.\n\nThat’s helped the Huskies overcome a disheartening 34-29 loss at\n\nShippensburg on Oct. 25, which crushed Bloom’s hopes for an NCAA Division II\n\nplayoff bid.\n\nActually, the Huskies’ fall was set up by an 18-13 loss to Indiana (Pa.)\n\nSept. 13- Bloomsburg’s only loss at home in two seasons.\n\n“That gave us no margin for error,” Hale said. “Even at that, had we\n\nfinished 9-1, it was going to be difficult, as the season’s unfolding. With a\n\nsecond loss, you’re going to be out.”\n\n* * *\n\nSTILL CHASING: Speaking of milestones, King’s College’s dazzling tailback\n\nJim DeMaise still needs four yards to break the school’s modern era\n\nsingle-season rushing record.\n\nDeMaise entered last week’s loss to Widener with 790 yards this season. But\n\nhe was still nursing an ankle sprain, and didn’t play in that game because\n\ntorrential downpours and muddy conditions in Chester weren’t conducive to his\n\nrecovery.\n\nAgainst FDU-Madison this weekend, DeMaise should easily break the school\n\nrecord of 793 yards, set by current teammate Mike Conaghan last year.\n\nWith two games remaining, DeMaise (who averages 112 rushing yards per game)\n\nalso has an excellent shot to become the school’s first 1,000-yard rusher\n\nsince King’s returned to varsity football in 1993.\n\n* * *\n\nRETURN OF NOSEY NATE: King’s received a big boost last week when freshman\n\nNate Houston reassumed his familiar spot at nose guard.\n\nHouston, a 6-foot, 250-pound lineman from Philadelphia, missed two games\n\nbecause of injury before he returned against Widener. He is part of a\n\ndefensive unit that struggled early, while allowing its first three opponents\n\nover 455 offensive yards per game, but has held its last five foes to an\n\naverage of 305.2 yards.\n\nThe Monarchs are hoping Houston doesn’t pack in his physical prowess when\n\nfootball season ends a week from Saturday. He won the national prep school\n\nheavyweight wrestling championship at Cardinal Dougherty High School last\n\nyear, and King’s would like to see him pin down a few more victories on the\n\nmat.\n\nPaul Sokoloski"
