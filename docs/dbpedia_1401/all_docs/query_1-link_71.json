Born in southwest Georgia, her singing style and traditional repertoire are grounded in her experiences in church, school and political activism. As a composer, she has created a narrative of her social and political activism through her songs and larger compositions. She performed as a member of the SNCC Freedom Singers during the '60s and founded an all-women a capella ensemble, the Harambee Singers, during the Black Cultural Movement.

[Read more.]\n\nSpring 2012: Angela Brown\n\nAngela Brown personifies the ideal American dramatic soprano: sheer vocal power; luxurious finesse; shimmering, high pianissimos; and a charming personality larger than life. Her highly successful Metropolitan Opera debut in 2004 sparked a media excitement with reviews from the New York Times: \"At last an Aida,\" the Associated Press: \"she combines a potent, dusky lower register with a striking ability to spin out soft high notes of shimmering beauty. There's no doubt her voice is powerful enough for Verdi,\" CBS Evening News: \"The future of opera has arrived,\" and features on the front page of the New York Times and in Oprah, Essence and Ebony magazines, Classical Singer, Reader's Digest and Psychology Today.\n\nBrown is a trailblazer on a mission to bring operatic and classical vocal performance to a diverse audience.

While over the past two years the McCormack resident has operated in collaboration with the First-Year Experience (FYE), bringing to campus composer and musician Terrence Blanchard and choreographer and dancer Bill T. Jones, this year the Office of Special Programs has collaborated with the Office of Advancement and the Department of Music in order to dedicate the McCormack Residency to the inaugural year in the Arthur Zankel Music Center.

[Read a Scope News article regarding his residency.]\n\nJones has graced the cover of Time and was recently featured in the acclaimed HBO documentary The Black List. As an artist, Jones creates groundbreaking, interdisciplinary dance pieces that examine such issues as race, politics, love, aspiration, war and faith. His iconic choreography and unflinching social provocation have earned him a prominent place in the history of contemporary performance. On an international scale, his works stimulate ideas, raise questions, promote public dialogue and bear out his conviction that art is a catalyst for reflection, engagement and action.\n\nIn 2009, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.

The current membership includes more than 250 Nobel laureates and more than 60 Pulitzer Prize winners.\n\nHe has also won a 2007 Tony Award, 2007 Obie Award and 2006 Callaway Award for his choreography for the Broadway hit Spring Awakening. He is the recipient of the 2005 Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award for Lifetime Achievement, the 2005 Wexner Prize and the Aaron Davis Hall Harlem Renaissance Award.

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in 1982, Jones choreographed and performed nationally and internationally as a soloist and duet company with his late partner, Arnie Zane.\n\nIn the summers of 1992, 1998 and 2007, Jones was in residence with his company at Skidmore College and in 2008 he received an honorary doctorate during commencement.\n\nFall 2008/Spring 2009: Terence Blanchard\n\nFrom 1939 to 1975 Blue Note Records signed or recorded just about every notable trumpet player in jazz. It is fitting, but no mere coincidence, as the label celebrates its 70th Anniversary, that its current roster includes one of the most celebrated, influential and gifted trumpeter-composers of all time: Terence Blanchard.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Blanchard began playing trumpet at an early age and was later tutored by legendary jazz patriarch Ellis Marsalis before going on to attend Rutgers University on a music scholarship. Time spent performing with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers prepared him to later lead a quintet with Donald Harrison and his ensuing solo career.\n\nBlanchard's work as a film-score composer came to fruition through an association with film director and actor Spike Lee. Initially a soloist on Lee's soundtracks, he has gone on to compose scores for more than 50 major motion pictures including Miracle at St. Anna, Malcolm X, The 25th Hour, Inside Man, Talk to Me, Jungle Fever, Bamboozled and She Hate Me. His numerous awards for his contributions to film include multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Mo' Better Blues, The Heart Speaks, The Promised Land, and The 25th Hour.\n\nAnother collaboration with Lee in 2006 produced the four-hour Hurricane Katrina documentary for HBO, When the Levees Broke. The subsequent album, A Tale of God's Will (A Requiem for Katrina), garnered the composer a Grammy Award in 2007 for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. Requiem is the featured reading for the First-Year Experience.\n\nThe trumpeter's other critically acclaimed solo albums include Simply Stated, Romantic Defiance, Jazz in Film, Let's Get Lost and Wandering Moon. Bounce was released on Blue Note Records in 2003, followed by Flow in 2005, which was produced by legendary pianist Herbie Hancock. Blanchard and Hancock completed a 10-week tour in the fall of 2008. In February, Blanchard received another Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Solo on Be-Bop, of the album Live at the 2007 Monterey Jazz Festival. In addition to receiving the award, he performed live at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast in Los Angeles.\n\nEarlier this month Blanchard took part in \"Honor: a Celebration of the African American Cultural Legacy,\" presented at Carnegie Hall and curated by legendary soprano Jessye Norman. He is director of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance in New Orleans. His latest project, Choices, a mix of spoken word, hip-hop, rhythm & blues and jazz, will feature Cornel West (author, Democracy Matters) and rhythm & blues vocalist Bilal. The album will be released on Blue Note Records later this year.\n\nSpring 2008: Sir Jonathan Miller\n\nSir Jonathan Miller, author, lecturer, humorist, television producer and presenter and film director, was in residence during the spring of 2008.

He was heavily involved in the university drama society and the Cambridge Footlights and helped write, produce and star in the legendary comedy revue Beyond the Fringe, which helped launch the careers of Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Miller went on to become the editor and presenter of the BBC's flagship arts programme Monitor and wrote, produced and directed various films, operas and Shakespeare plays. Miller was appointed a Commander of the British Empire in 1983 and knighted for his services to the arts in 2003. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London and Edinburgh and a Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In addition to a series of films, the following events were offered to the public free of charge: \"Laughing Matters: Humor & Comedy\" (a lecture with Jonathan Miller); \"Film and the Imagination\" (a panel discussion with faculty and students); and \"A Conversation with Jonathan Miller\" (with Skidmore faculty).\n\nSpring 2007: Richard Danielpour\n\nIn the spring of 2007 Grammy Award–winning composer Richard Danielpour visited Skidmore on three separate occasions. He is best known for his collaboration with Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison on the creation and development of Margaret Garner, his first opera. Danielpour and members of the Margaret Garner cast participated in classes and took part in special campus and community events. Their visit culminated with the presentation of a staged concert performance of selections from the opera and a post-concert conversation.\n\nDanielpour is one of the most gifted and sought-after composers of his generation. His music has attracted an illustrious array of champions, and as a devoted mentor and educator, he has also had a significant impact on the younger generation of composers. Danielpour has received commissions from the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia and Stuttgart radio orchestras, Orchestre National de France, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival and San Francisco, Pittsburgh, National and Baltimore symphonies. His work has been championed by Yo-Yo Ma, Jessye Norman, Dawn Upshaw, Emanuel Ax, Frederica von Stade, Thomas Hampson, Gary Graffman, the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio, the Guarneri, Emerson and American string quartets and the New York City and Pacific Northwest ballets. Danielpour's many honors include a Lifetime Achievement Award and Charles Ives Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts & Letters, a Guggenheim Award, Bearns Prize from Columbia University and grants and residencies from the Barlow Foundation, MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Copland House and the American Academy in Rome. In fall 2002, he became one of the first recipients of a coveted Alberto Vilar Fellowship and Residency at the American Academy in Berlin.\n\nSpring 2006: Nnenna Freelon\n\nThe fourth McCormack Resident, Nnenna Freelon was in residence at Skidmore in April 2006.

An accomplished singer, composer, producer and arranger, Freelon has dedicated herself to educating young people, both musicians and non-musicians. She toured the United States for four years as the national spokesperson for Partners In Education.\n\nFreelon made her feature film debut in the Mel Gibson hit What Women Want and sang a remake of Sinatra's classic \"Fly Me To The Moon\" for The Visit, starring Billy Dee Williams. She is also a winner of the Eubie Blake Award and has twice been nominated for the \"Lady of Soul\" Soul Train Award. Freelon has performed and toured with a veritable who's who in jazz, from Ray Charles and Ellis Marsalis to Al Jarreau and George Benson, among many others.

His schedule included four events open to the public: a CD signing at Borders Books and Music, an open rehearsal, a master class and a concert. Redman's jam-packed week also included several occasions to collaborate closely with members of the campus and Saratoga Springs communities.\n\n*African-American, Latino, Asian-American, and Native American\n\nSpring 2003: Michael Ondaatje\n\nSkidmore launched the McCormack Artist-Scholar Residency in spring 2004 with a highly successful visit by noted author Michael Ondaatje, who gave a public reading, led a discussion about film, met with classes, collaborated with faculty and participated in a range of small gatherings with members of the campus and Saratoga Springs communities.
