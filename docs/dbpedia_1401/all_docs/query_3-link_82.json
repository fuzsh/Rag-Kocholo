        "text": "Box Score\n\nJamiel had nine receptions for 129 yards and two touchdowns for the Skyhawks (PHOTO BY Jan Volk/SportsPix)\n\nSkyhawks defense holds Huskies to 168 yards, Jamiel matches career TD mark\n\nPowell paces offense that racks up 466 yards with 212 total yards, 3 TDs in debut\n\nBLOOMSBURG, Pa. (September 7, 2019) â€“ Stonehill College racked up 466 yards of total offense, while limiting Bloomsburg (Pa.) University to just 168 in posting a convincing 33-14 season-opening victory in non-conference football action on Danny Hale Field at Robert B. Redman Stadium this afternoon.\n\nStonehill saw the successful debut of two quarterbacks this afternoon, with junior Greg Powell, a transfer from LIU Post, finishing with 212 total yards and three touchdowns, while junior Anton Stoneking completed 8-of-11 passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. Powell completed 11-of-14 passes for 177 yards and two scores, while adding another on the ground, where he rushed the ball seven times for 35 yards.\n\nSenior wide receiver Andrew Jamiel caught nine passes for 129 yards and two touchdowns, posting the 12th 100-yard receiving game of his career. He also matched Stonehill's career record for touchdown receptions with 25, set by Nate Robitaille, '15, while also moving within 32 yards of Robitaille's career receiving yardage record (2,744), finishing the day with 2,712 in 32 career games.\n\nStrickland led a strong defensive effort for the Skyhawks with five tackles and an interception (PHOTO BY Andrew Katsampes)\n\nSophomore DeAaron Lawrence added four receptions for 64 yards and his first career touchdown for Stonehill. Classmate Justin Felder rushed the ball 19 times for 73 yards, while senior Brian Kearns, Jr. finished with 61 yards on 21 carries, becoming the sixth in program history to surpass 2,000 yards rushing as he finished the day with 2,043 yards.\n\nSenior Miles Strickland led a Stonehill defense that held Bloomsburg to just 168 total yards and seven first downs, including 52 through the air, with five tackles (two solo), including 1.0 tackles for a loss of a yard, an interception and pass breakup. Sophomore Lloyd King finished with a team-high six tackles (all solo), while junior Dohnavyn Jefferson chipped in five stops (four solo) and a breakup.\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Logan Leiby finished with 99 total yards in his first career start for Bloomsburg. He completed 12-of-20 passes for 52 yards, was intercepted once and sacked twice, while adding 47 yards on nine carries. Senior Qmac Quiteh scored the Huskies lone offensive touchdown, and had nine carries for 29 yards.\n\nJunior Aaron Trumino scored Bloomsburg's remaining touchdown, when he intercepted a Stoneking pass and returned it 13 yards for a score in the fourth quarter, finishing with ten tackles (three solo), including 1.0 for a loss. Classmate Alex Findura paced the Huskies defense with 12 stops (seven solo), including 2.0 for a loss of three, and a pass breakup.\n\nPowell\n\nStoneking\n\nStonehill started fast, marching the opening possession of the game 69-yards in ten plays, capped by Stoneking's 11-yard touchdown toss to Jamiel just 4:09 into the game. Bloomsburg knotted the score with Quiteh's six-yard touchdown run with 45-seconds left in the opening quarter.\n\nStonehill took control of the game with 17 points in the second quarter, answering the Bloomsburg score on its ensuing possession as Powell ran up the middle from 16-yards away to cap a ten play, 85-yard drive with his first career touchdown. Powell connected with Lawrence on a superb 43-yard touchdown strike with 3:24 remaining and then senior Matt Haite delivered a 32-yard field goal as time expired for halftime as the Skyhawks took a 24-7 lead into the intermission.\n\nStonehill forced a three and out on Bloomsburg's opening possession of the second half and then Haite added a 31-yard field goal 4:19 into the third quarter. The Skyhawks stretched their lead to 33-7 when Jamiel collected a 22-yard touchdown pass from Powell 50-seconds into the fourth quarter. Bloomsburg snapped the run of 26-straight points by the Skyhawks with Trumino's interception return for a score with 11:19 remaining.\n\nHaite's two field goals on the afternoon give him 31 for his career, just two shy of the program record of 33 by Steve Grzywacz, '16.\n\nStonehill (1-0, 0-0 NE10) is back in action next Saturday, when it opens its home schedule by hosting the University of New Haven for a non-conference matchup at W.B. Mason Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Bloomsburg (0-1, 0-0 PSAC) visits Edinboro University next Saturday at noon."
