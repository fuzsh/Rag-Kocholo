        "text": "This is a list of football coaches with a .750 or greater winning percentage.[1][2] College football coaches who have coached college teams for 10 or more seasons are included in the list. \"College level\" is defined as a four-year college or university program in either the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) or the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). If the team competed at a time before the official organization of either of the two groups, but is generally accepted as a \"college football program,\" it is also included.\n\nLeading the list is Larry Kehres, who compiled a .929 winning percentage while coaching the Mount Union Purple Raiders from 1986 to 2012. The longest tenure among coaches on the list is that of John Gagliardi, who was a head coach from 1949 until retiring after the 2012 season. Gagliardi also leads all listed coaches in total games, wins, and losses. Former Vanderbilt head coach Dan McGugin has the most ties of anyone on the list.\n\nKey\n\n[edit]\n\nbold Expected to be active as head coach in 2024 † Inducted into the College Football Hall of
