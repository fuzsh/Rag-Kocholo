        "text": "< Back to Historical Archives main page\n\nSummary of 1960 through 1969\n\nRandall Capps\n\nDr. Russell Miller's decade of administration slowly transitioned to Randall L. Capps by 1963. Hired in 1962, and department head of Speech and Theater in 1969, Capps would become as prolific a sponsor of forensics at Western as Russell Miller had been. He would play a critical role in the 1987 restoration of WKU's forensic team.\n\nThe end of the Congress Debating Club\n\nBetween 1958 and 1961 the competitive debate team and the Congress Debating Club clearly began their separate paths. Whereas before debate competition had come from the club membership, as the competitive debate team developed the Congress Debating Club became, in effect, moot. Thus the longest-running club in Western's history dissolved in 1966, after forty-six years. The obvious association between the club and citizenship and government helps us understand where the club's activities went after the formal club dissolved. At the time these archives were compiled, the Political Science Department continued to host moot court.\n\nFurther change in competitions\n\nSources prior to this decade described debate results solely in terms of win/loss ratios. Not a single source yet mined mentions eliminations rounds in debate. Only at the start of the 1960s do articles mention debate tournaments with a \"berth\" of quarterfinal or semifinal rounds. Whether this reflects a new development or simply the team meeting new styles as it competed further abroad is not clear, though the later seems likely. The team certainly competed further outside the state, and more often, than it had the previous decade. Regarding debate formats, a 1963 article specified that the debates at the Southern Speech Association tournament comprised \"four rounds of conventional debate and...two rounds of cross examination debate.\"1 As for non-debate events, sources from the later part of the previous decade make no mention of anything beyond oratory. In 1963, however, we've mention again of competition in other speaking and interpretation events at two to three tournaments each year. Some years the debaters would compete throughout the competition year, whereas other students would join in for select tournaments to compete in individual events. By the later part of the 1960s, it became more common for the debate students themselves to also compete in individual events.\n\nThe Russell Miller Archives\n\nThis page contains the final forensics-related scrapbook kept by debate coach Russell H. Miller, associated with the 1960-61 school year. As before, the bulk of the memorabilia pertains to the theatrical productions of the Western Players, but this selection also includes speech and debate content. Many forensics students also performed in the Western Players.\n\nRussell Miller Scrapbook 1960-61 #2\n\nAnnual Subsections: 1960 - 1969\n\n1959-60\n\nWestern Debate Associates\n\nRussell H.

Jones, John Warren Oakes, Charles L. Wade, Harry Zimmerman Anne C. Shaver and Robert H. Schneider represented Western at the Kentucky Oratorical Association contest, but records are lacking. The team does appear to have competed in fewer debate tournaments than it had in previous years, but by selecting tournaments rather than matches the total number of debate rounds was likely the same. On 8 March 1960 WKU joined Tau Kappa Alpha, a national forensic-related fraternity. A copy of the founding charter can be found here.\n\nCongress Debating Society\n\nSponsor: Dr. Willson E.

At the Kentucky Intercollegiate Oratorical Association tournament Kathy Adkins and Jim Skaggs competed, but we lack records of results. The team also competed at the Tau Kappa Alpha national tournament in Louisville on 11-13 May, but we've no record of results.\n\n[Link to 1961 Results Archive]\n\nCongress Debating Society\n\nSponsor: Dr. Willson E.

For some years in the records, the KIFC can be found, and in others the oratorical and debate tournaments instead, suggesting it was not a permanent arrangement from the start.\n\nCongress Debating Society\n\nDr. William Jenkins (sponsor) Richard G.

At the Kentucky Intercollegiate Debate Tournament at Bellarmine, Western again won the state championship on 1 December 1962, with the team of Bob Denhart, Ken Duncan, Earl Forsythe, and Carolyn Patton.15 The team also competed at the Southern Speech Association tournament in Nashville and the Tau Kappa Alpha national tournament, but with limited success.\n\n[Link to 1963 Results Archive]\n\nRecords from 1965 claim that Western opened its first debate scholarship in 1963.8\n\nCongress Debating Society\n\n(back) Glenn Miller, Richard G.
