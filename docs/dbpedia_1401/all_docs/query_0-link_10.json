Those participants who received the PPWL intervention (i.e., the PPWL-only and GWG+PPWL conditions) were combined consistently with the pre-registered protocol and compared to those participants who did not receive the PPWL intervention in the primary analyses. Primary outcome data (i.e., postpartum weight retention) were obtained at 6-months postpartum by unblinded data collectors, and intent-to-treat analyses were conducted.\n\nResults\n\nRetention at 6-months postpartum was 88.4%. Participants who received the PPWL intervention retained marginally less weight (1.31 kg) compared to participants that received the GWG-only intervention (2.39 kg), with a difference of 1.08 kg (p = .07). None of the measured covariates, including breastfeeding status, were significantly associated with postpartum weight retention. Of the participants who received the PPWL intervention, 48.1% participants returned to their pre-pregnancy weight at 6-months postpartum, with no significant differences compared to those who received the GWG-only intervention.\n\nConclusions\n\nA behavioral intervention targeting diet and physical activity during the postpartum period had a trend for reduced postpartum weight retention.\n\nClinical Trial information\n\nThe trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT 03057808\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03057808\"}}NCT 03057808).\n\nKeywords: Postpartum weight loss, Behavioral intervention, Clinical trial, Weight management, Postpartum women, Military health\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nParticipants who received a postpartum weight management intervention had lower weight retention at 6 months postpartum compared participants who only received a weight management intervention during pregnancy, although these differences did not reach statistical significance.\n\nMeeting military standards for weight-to-height ratio (including body mass index [BMI]) is an entry-level requirement as well as a contractual requirement throughout military service that can be impacted by both lifestyle (e.g., diet and activity level) and life events (e.g., medical condition, injury, and pregnancy) [1]. Pregnancy, in particular, is frequently associated with persistent weight retention [2–4]. Thus, there is a potential for significant career-related consequences of postpartum weight retention for active-duty military women (e.g., loss of career and benefits, ineligibility for promotion) [5–8].\n\nIn a previous longitudinal research study, women, on average, retained approximately 1.7 kg at 6-months postpartum [9], although 14%–20% of women retain a substantial amount of weight (i.e., more than 5 kg [10]). In military populations, a study evaluating weight in active duty Navy women found that only half (49%) met weight standards and 32% met BMI standards (<25 kg/m2) at 6-months postpartum, compared to 68% meeting weight standards and 53% meeting BMI standards pre-pregnancy [5]. In more recent research, active duty women in the Navy who became pregnant were at greater risk of failing to meet fitness test and BMI requirements at one year postpartum and up to 2.5 years postpartum, compared to women who did not become pregnant [8]. Additionally, overweight and obesity are common among other TRICARE beneficiaries (e.g., spouses and children) [11, 12]. (TRICARE is a healthcare program provided by the United States Department of Defense to active duty personnel, veterans, and their family members.) Further, these TRICARE beneficiaries face unique challenges, such as deployment[13, 14]that may negatively impact health outcomes related to the perinatal period.\n\nPostpartum weight retention has also been associated with increased risk for obesity and other weight-related morbidity [5] as well as increased medical costs. The Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System spends more than $1 billion in preventive and treatment costs associated with overweight, obesity, and related comorbidities [15]. Fortunately, behavioral interventions targeting both diet and activity level are associated with reduced postpartum weight retention [16]; however, these interventions have not been adapted for the military lifestyle.\n\nA recent adaptation of the Look AHEAD ILI (Action for Health in Diabetes, Intensive Lifestyle Intervention) program [17, 18] for non-pregnant active duty personnel was successful at inducing clinically significant weight loss [19, 20]. In addition, a stepped-care adaptation of this intervention was successful at reducing GWG among pregnant active duty personnel and other TRICARE beneficiaries [21]. Therefore, the current study examines the postpartum weight loss (PPWL) phase of this intervention, among both active duty personnel and TRICARE beneficiaries (e.g., spouses and other dependents of active duty personnel). As such, the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of a GWG-only intervention to interventions including a PPWL component (e.g., PPWL-only intervention and combined GWG+PPWL intervention) in promoting PPWL. PPWL is defined as the loss of weight gained during pregnancy (i.e., the difference between the early first-trimester screening weight and weight at 6-months postpartum). We hypothesized that participants randomized to the GWG+PPWL and PPWL-only interventions would lose significantly more weight at 6-months postpartum than participants randomized to the GWG-only intervention.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign\n\nWe conducted an unblinded randomized controlled trial of a stepped-care intervention for PPWL within a military population, including both active duty military personnel and other TRICARE beneficiaries. Individuals were recruited from two Department of Defense outpatient medical centers located in Texas, Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center and San Antonio Military Medical Center. With the closure of the Wilford Hall obstetric clinic and the COVID-19 pandemic, two additional military bases, Andrews Air Force Base and Wright Patterson Air Force Base, were added as recruitment sites starting in July 2020.\n\nParticipants were recruited via advertisements and healthcare provider referrals. Interested individuals meeting initial eligibility criteria were scheduled for a screening visit. During the screening visit, study personnel assessed eligibility, and administered initial screening measures. Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study. Following the screening visit, participants were asked to self-monitor their diet and exercise for one week as well as to obtain medical clearance to participate in the study. In the case of participants who were active duty, fitness test scores from one year prior to study enrollment were obtained to allow future comparisons of pre-pregnancy and postpartum fitness test scores. Upon successful completion of these procedures, participants were randomized to one of three intervention conditions (GWG-only, PPWL-only, or combined GWG + PPWL). Participants were individually randomly assigned using a computerized block design designed by the study biostatistician, based on baseline pre-pregnancy BMI category and parity status (i.e., no previous live birth, previous live birth), to one of the three intervention conditions (1:1:1 allocation) with allocation concealment, to assure balanced assignment to conditions throughout the study. Assignment was revealed by the study database, and study staff notified participants of the randomization assignment.\n\nPlanned analyses were conducted related to the effect of the GWG intervention [21], and no other interim analyses were conducted. Study recruitment ended in October 2020 with 430 randomized participants to allow for up to 12 months follow-up postpartum within the grant period, with no further sample size-related stopping guidelines applied. For the purpose of the current report, we present the primary study outcome of weight retention at 6-months postpartum. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the 59th Medical Wing and acknowledged by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center IRB. There were no changes to the study outcomes once the study began. Adverse events (e.g., hemorrhoids, mild postpartum depression) and serious adverse events (e.g., ruptured rectum, appendectomy) that occurred over the course of the study were recorded and monitored.\n\nParticipants\n\nRecruitment for this study began in February 2017 and ended in October 2020. Eligible participants included individuals aged 18 years or older that were either active duty personnel or other TRICARE beneficiaries (e.g., spouses, family members). Participants were eligible if they were less than 13 weeks and 5 days gestation upon randomization, consistent with previous GWG interventions [22, 23]. Active duty personnel were initially eligible for our study if they had at least 1.5 years left in their current duty station; this requirement was in place to minimize chances of missing in-person follow-up visits, but was removed in April 2020 when the study moved to remote assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Exclusion criteria included the presence of medical and psychiatric conditions that may limit full participation in the intervention, history of bariatric surgery or recent weight loss, and the use of medications that may contribute to changes in weight. Individuals with high-risk pregnancy conditions (including those who reported smoking cigarettes, as well as those with diabetes or multiple gestation) were excluded. Those with underweight were also excluded from participation in this study, due to the low prevalence of underweight in this population.\n\nA total of 430 participants were randomized to one of three intervention conditions: GWG intervention (GWG-only; n = 144), PPWL intervention (PPWL-only; n = 142), and combined intervention (GWG+PPWL; n = 144). Consistent with the pre-registered protocol [24], the GWG intervention was compared to a combined PPWL and GWG+PPWL group in order to compare postpartum weight retention between groups that received the PPWL intervention (n = 286) and those that did not (n = 144).\n\nInterventions\n\nThe interventions implemented in this study reflected a stepped-care behavioral approach designed to either increase or decrease the intensity of the intervention depending on individual participant’s progress in meeting established weight gain and weight loss recommendations.\n\nAdditional details, including details of the GWG intervention, can be found in the study protocol [24], the main GWG outcome paper [21], and the pregnancy-focused physical activity paper [25].\n\nPPWL Intervention\n\nThe PPWL intervention consisted of remote (telephone) sessions (20–30 min) delivered individually by trained study interventionists from 6-weeks to 12-months postpartum, although the primary outcome and the focus of this paper is on the first 6-months postpartum. Contact occurred monthly, biweekly, or weekly in accordance with the stepped-care approach ( ). The PPWL intervention included self-monitoring, goal setting, and problem-solving related to weight, diet, and physical activity-related behaviors. Session reviews were conducted to provide feedback to study interventionists. Approximately 15% of the sessions were randomly selected and audio-recorded (with participant permission), and feedback on adherence to the protocol was provided to the interventionist. All interventionists had biweekly supervision to ensure treatment fidelity.\n\nTable 1\n\nStep 1\n\nBeginningStep 2\n\n<0.5 lbs./week weight lossStep 3\n\n<0.5 lbs./week for 2 weeksContact20–30-min monthly phone sessions20–30-min biweekly phone sessions20–30-min weekly phone sessions and resourcesDietary recommendationsCalorie goal based on baseline self-monitoring and breastfeeding statusSame as Step 1 with addition of: monitoring portion size and dietary intakeCalorie intake reduced by 100–200 calories per dayPhysical activity level ­recommendationsActivity goal gradually increased to pre-pregnancy levels, monitored using wrist-worn activity tracker (Fitbit)Same as Step 1Same as Step 1Behavioral strategiesDaily self-monitoring and weekly feedback regarding weight trajectorySame as Step 1 with addition of: monitoring food intake, goal setting, and problem solving (via email and phone)Same as Step 2 with addition of: meal replacements, meal plans, toolbox resources, and additional resources (adapted Look AHEAD materials)Conditions for decreasing level of interventionAll participants to startWith the return to recommended weight loss trajectoryWith the return to recommended weight loss trajectory\n\nWeight.\n\nWeight loss goals for women were generally divided into two pre-pregnancy BMI categories: weight goals for women within a normal pre-pregnancy BMI were to return to pre-pregnancy weight, whereas weight loss goals for women within an overweight or obese pre-pregnancy BMI were to return to pre-pregnancy weight or to lose up-to an additional 5% of pre-pregnancy weight, if desired. Irrespective of pre-pregnancy BMI, women were advised to follow a weight loss trajectory of approximately one pound (0.45 kg) per week. Participants were encouraged to engage in daily weight monitoring using a Body Trace e-scale; data from the scale, including the date and time of weigh-ins, were accessible to both participants and interventionists via a secure and personalized website. Weight was monitored using the digital e-scale on a weekly basis by the interventionist, with participants receiving weekly feedback from an interventionist regarding their weight loss trajectory via email (including the weight graph). Participants not meeting the weekly weight loss goals received additional support through the stepped-care protocol ( ).\n\nDiet.\n\nAll participants received measuring cups and spoons to assist with portion size estimates; participants received these tools at baseline if they received the GWG intervention and at 6 weeks postpartum if they received the PPWL-only intervention. Calorie intake goals were based on baseline reports, breastfeeding status, and U.S. Dietary guidelines (myplate.gov). Women who were breastfeeding received a calorie intake goal that was 300 kcal greater than women who were not breastfeeding. Calorie intake goals were periodically adjusted as needed, based on individual weight loss trajectories. As part of the stepped-care approach (Steps 2 and 3), participants were encouraged to self-monitor their dietary intake and physical activity using MyFitnessPal ( ). Step 3 included the addition of meal plans and provided meal replacements (i.e., Better Oats breakfast options, Healthy Choice pre-prepared meals, and Slim Fast protein shakes), and participants were encouraged to replace 2 of their 3 daily conventional meals with one of the above-provided options.\n\nPhysical Activity.\n\nParticipants received a wrist-worn activity tracker (e.g., Fitbit) to promote and monitor physical activity goals; participants received this tracker at baseline if they received the GWG intervention and at 6 weeks postpartum if they received the PPWL-only intervention. Following medical clearance at approximately 6-weeks postpartum, participants were encouraged to gradually return to physical activity, with the national guideline of 150 min per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity provided or returning to pre-pregnancy levels of physical activity (whichever goal was highest). Physical activity was reduced or halted in accordance with medical recommendations.\n\nMeasures\n\nData were collected across 6 visits: screening, baseline, gestational weeks 32 and 36, 6-weeks postpartum, and 6-months postpartum. Data were collected from February 2017 until October 2021 (for 6-months postpartum outcomes). Self-reported sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, military rank) were collected at the screening visit. Although military rank tracks closely with socioeconomic status, information regarding sample socioeconomic status was not collected. Changes in body weight (kg) from screening to the 6-months postpartum period was the primary study outcome. Weight was measured, collected, and stored using a research-grade digital scale within the obstetric clinic (prior to March 2020) and using the participants’ assigned Body Trace e-scale during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline BMI was calculated during the initial screening visit using the standard formula, as a proxy for pre-pregnancy BMI given the demonstrated concordance with first trimester BMI category [26]. Height was measured in centimeters using a stadiometer at screening, or self-reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with previous research, substantial postpartum weight retention was defined by three categories: <0.9 kg, 0.9–4.99 kg, and ≥5 kg [27, 28]. Current breastfeeding status was assessed dichotomously (i.e., yes vs. no) at 6-months postpartum, in order to explore this potentially important variable; previous findings on the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum weight retention has been inconsistent [29, 30].\n\nPower and Data Analysis\n\nA-priori power calculations were conducted using PASS15 (see [24]). Based on previous research, postpartum weight retention estimations without intervention are 1.7 kg at 6-months postpartum [9]. Further, our a-priori hypothesis was that the GWG + PPWL and PPWL-only conditions would result in weight loss improvements of 1.2 kg, or 0.5 kg postpartum weight retention in the intervention group. A sample size of 150 participants per condition was determined to detect between-group mean differences of 0.4 kg (assumed group standard deviations of 1.0), with 80% power and a medium effect size [31]. Given the population characteristics (e.g., the mobility of the military population, a pregnant population with the possibility of miscarriage), a 20% attrition rate at 6-months follow-up was estimated.\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SAS/STATv15.2. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies and proportions, were generated overall and for the GWG/PPWL conditions. Two-sample t-test or chi-square test for continuous and/or discrete variables, respectively, were applied for comparison of characteristics for those with complete versus missing outcome data at six months postpartum. Primary analyses for testing the PPWL intervention effect at six months postpartum was an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis examining the change in weight from screening to 6-months postpartum. For this analysis, we applied repeated measure linear mixed effects model that uses all randomized subjects and available data regardless of the protocol completion. We modeled weight as a function of treatment assignment, time and interaction between treatment and time. Repeated data was clustered within the subject as a random effect with assumed unstructured covariance matrix. As a sensitivity analysis approach to the ITT analysis, we performed twenty-five regression model-based multiple imputations assuming data was missing at random (MAR). Further, we performed an additional analysis of study completers only. Using analysis of covariance linear regression model (ANCOVA), we modeled the change in weight as a function of intervention assignment, first using a simple model adjusting for screening weight only. Next, we applied an adjusted ANCOVA model, adjusting for screening weight, BMI category, age, race, ethnicity, active duty military status, gestation weeks at screening, and parity. Breastfeeding status was examined in sensitivity analyses to determine if it modified the intervention effect. Comparison of weight retention group proportions between conditions was performed with a chi-square test. Associations were considered significant at the alpha level of 0.05 in combination with other evidence such as effect sizes, magnitude of the association, and confidence levels.\n\nResults\n\nAcross groups, 47.4% of participants were classified as active duty personnel, whereas 52.6% of participants were classified as other TRICARE beneficiaries. Overall, a majority of participants were affiliated with the Air Force (63.6%), with fewer participants affiliated with the Army (26.9%), Navy (8.2%), Marine Corps (1.6%), and Coast Guard (0.7%). Similarly, majority of active duty personnel were affiliated with the Air Force (69.6%), and fewer were affiliated with the Army (20.1%) and other branches. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a temporary halt to recruitment and the initial recruitment goal of 450 participants was not achieved.\n\nThere were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention conditions. Approximately 11.6% of participants (N = 50) did not have a weight outcome assessment at 6-months postpartum ( and ). There was not significant differential attrition between the conditions (PPWL intervention 13.3% vs. GWG condition 8.3%; p = .1305). Participants who did not complete the outcome assessment were slightly younger, more likely to identify as Black, and those with the lowest level of education (i.e., high school degree or GED) ( ). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing a serious adverse event between the conditions (11.9% of those who received the PPWL intervention and 16.0% in the GWG condition; p = .2389). Among those who received the PPWL intervention, there were a total of 1,486 sessions completed or on average, 5.9 sessions per participant. Among participants who received the PPWL intervention, 33.3% (n = 84 out of 252 participants, with at least one session) had at least one step 1 session, 30.9% (n = 78 out of 252 participants) had at least one step 2 session and 16.7% (n = 42 out of 252 participants) had at least one step 3 session.\n\nTable 2\n\nTotal\n\n(N = 430)GWG-only intervention\n\n(N = 144)PPWL-only intervention\n\n(N = 142)GWG+PPWL interventions\n\n(N = 144)Participants who received the PPWL intervention\n\n(N = 286)Age (years), M(SD)30.6(4.9)30.9(5)30.4(4.8)30.6(4.8)30.5(4.8)Body mass index (kg/m2), M(SD)27.6(5.2)27.6(5.3)27.7(5.5)27.6(5)27.7(5.2)Gestation at screening (weeks), M(SD)11.7(1.1)11.8(1.1)11.6(1.2)11.8(1)11.7(1.1)Weight—self-reported pre-pregnancy weight (kg), M(SD)73.0(14.9)72.3(14.6)73.4(15.7)73.2(14.5)73.3(15.1)Weight—screening (kg), M(SD)74.2(15)73.6(14.4)74.9(15.8)74.2(14.7)74.5(15.2)Weight—6-months postpartum (kg), M(SD)74.7(15)76.1(15.3)75.9(17.2)75.2(15.0)75.5(16.1)BMI category, N (%) Normal weight141(32.8)48(33.3)46(32.4)47(32.6)93(32.5) Overweight172(40.0)58(40.3)57(40.1)57(39.6)114(39.9) Obesity117(27.2)38(26.4)39(27.5)40(27.8)79(27.6)Hispanic/Latino, N (%)72 (16.7)(22)15.329(20.4)21(14.6)50(17.5)Race, N (%) White292(67.9)101(70.1)99(69.7)92(63.9)191(66.8) Black64(14.9)20(13.9)22(15.5)22(15.3)44(15.4) Other race groups*74(17.2)23(16.0)21(14.8)30(20.8)51(17.8) Other race identification 33(7.7) 14(9.7) 13(9.2) 6(4.2) 19(6.6) Mixed race 21(4.9) 5(3.5) 3(2.1) 13(9) 16(5.6) Asian 13(3.0) 2(1.4) 5(3.5) 6(4.2) 11(3.9) Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander 5(1.2) 2(1.4) 0 3(2.1) 3(1) American Indian Alaska Native 2(0.5) 0 0 2(1.4) 2(0.7) Education, N (%) High School Degree/GED26(6.1)9(6.3)12(8.5)5(3.5)17(5.9) Some college or vocational training152(35.4)50(35)53(37.3)49(34)102(35.7) College degree148(34.5)50(35)45(31.7)53(36.8)98(34.3) Graduate degree103(24)34(23.7)32(22.5)37(25.7)69(24.1)Active duty, N (%)204(47.4)70(48.6)64(45.1)70(48.6)134(46.9)Military rank, participant or beneficiary sponsor, N (%) E1-473(17.8)24(17.3)27(20)22(16.2)49(18.1) E5-6164(40)53(38.1)60(44.4)51(37.5)111(41) E7-940(9.8)19(13.7)7(5.2)14(10.3)21(7.8) O1-390(22)26(18.7)32(23.7)32(23.5)64(23.6) O4-643(10.4)17(12.2)9(6.7)17(12.5)26(9.6)Previous live birth, N (%)239(55.6)80(55.5)79(55.6)80(55.6)159(55.6)Missing primary outcome data—6-months postpartum, N (%)50(11.6)12(8.3)21(14.8)17(11.8)38(13.3)Withdrew, N (%)46(10.7)11(7.6)16(11.3)19(13.2)35(12.2)\n\nTable 3\n\nVariableβ SE p-valueStudy arm (PPWL intervention vs. GWG)−1.0740.597.0728Screening weight0.010.03.7366BMI category (obesity vs. normal weight)−1.5791.211.1931BMI category (overweight vs. normal weight)−0.5560.78.4766Age−0.0860.062.1659Gestation week at screening−0.0020.264.9948Race (ref: White) Black0.0780.877.9291 Other race groups−0.0350.778.9644Hispanic/Latino (ref: Non-Hispanic)−0.6770.813.4055Active duty (ref: Not Active duty)0.4270.595.4739Previous live birth (ref: No previous live birth)0.3090.601.6067\n\nITT analyses demonstrated unadjusted weight retention of 2.39 kg for the GWG-only arm, 1.25 kg for PPWL arm, and 1.36 kg for the combined GWG+PPWL arm. As previously mentioned, planned comparisons for this analysis involved comparing the GWG-only intervention to interventions including a PPWL component (PPWL-only and GWG+PPWL). Results indicated that weight retention among PPWL-only and GWG+PPWL conditions was similar (1.25 kg and 1.36 kg, respectively). ITT repeated measures linear mixed effects models showed a greater weight retention of 2.39 kg for the GWG arm versus 1.31 kg for the arms involving a PPWL component for a difference of 1.08 kg (95% CI −0.08, 2.23, p = .07). Results from multiple imputation model showed very similar treatment effect of 1.09 kg difference between treatment arms (95% CI −0.4, 2.58, p = .15). Similar to the ITT models, the unadjusted results among study completers showed a trend for greater weight retention of 2.38 kg for the GWG arm versus 1.32 kg for the arms involving a PPWL component, a difference of 1.06 kg (95% CI −0.1, 2.23, p = .07). After the adjustment for covariates (i.e., screening weight, BMI category, age, race, ethnicity, active duty military status, gestation weeks at screening, and parity), weight retention for GWG arm was 2.09 kg and 1.02 kg for those who received the PPWL intervention, a difference of 1.07 kg (95% CI −0.1, 2.25, p = .07). There were no significant differences in postpartum weight retention for any of the covariates examined ( ).\n\nBreastfeeding status was available for 348 of the participants, and we examined the potential influence of this variable on postpartum weight retention in sensitivity analyses. Approximately 71.6% of participants reported breastfeeding at 6-months postpartum. Participants who reported breastfeeding had slightly, but not significantly lower weight retention (−1.07 kg, p = .11) compared to participants who did not report breastfeeding. The addition of breastfeeding to the model resulted in a similar intervention effect with those receiving PPWL intervention having 1.13 kg lower retention than the GWG condition (95% CI, −0.08, 2.34, p = .07).\n\nWhen weight retention was examined categorically, 48.1% participants receiving the PPWL intervention returned to their pre-pregnancy weight at 6-months postpartum (i.e., < 0.9 kg weight retention), and 43.4% of women who received the GWG-only intervention returned to their pre-pregnancy weight. Additionally, 23.7% of participants who received the PPWL intervention had a 5 kg or greater postpartum weight retention, and 28.8% of participants in the GWG-only intervention retained at least 5 kg. Despite lower total weight retention in the PPWL condition, there was no statistically significant difference between the two conditions in returning to pre-pregnancy weight (p = .53).\n\nDiscussion\n\nUsing a stepped-care approach, this study found that a weight management intervention targeting the postpartum period resulted in 1.08 kg lower weight retention compared to an intervention that included only a GWG component. Those participants who did not have the PPWL intervention retained 2.39 kg while those who received the postpartum intervention retained 1.31 kg. None of the measured covariates (including breastfeeding status) were significantly associated with postpartum weight retention. Overall, results supported the hypothesis that conditions with a PPWL intervention were more effective at reducing postpartum weight retention compared to a GWG-only intervention, although not reaching statistical significance.\n\nThe magnitude of the effect with this study are consistent with those of other behavioral intervention trials targeting or evaluating postpartum weight outcomes [27, 28]. Results from the LIFE-Moms consortium similarly support the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions focusing on diet and activity level delivered during the pregnancy period [32], and in the postpartum period [33]. The LIFE Moms interventions resulted in a comparable 1.6 kg difference in weight retention at 12 months postpartum compared to standard care. Clinically meaningful weight gain has been previously defined as gaining at least 2.25 kg, based on the increased likelihood of cardiovascular risk factors with this degree of weight gain [34]. Thus, the improvements in weight retention among the participants who received the PPWL intervention (compared to those who did not) in the current sample may have clinical significance. In addition, similar to a previous behavioral intervention (45.3%; [27]), 48.1% of participants who received the PPWL intervention returned to their pre-conception weight. Given the promise in increasing reach and access of remote intervention modalities as well the potential for reducing burden, the current study contributes to knowledge in novel eHealth approaches to PPWL interventions. For example, like other health systems, the U.S. military heathcare system has limited resources for delivering care. The stepped-care approach used in this study is designed to monitor individual weight trajectories to determine which participants are struggling and provide more sessions while minimizing burden among participants who are meeting the weight management goals.\n\nNotably, despite the military fitness test requirements at 12 months postpartum, there were no significant differences in postpartum weight retention between active duty personnel and other TRICARE beneficiaries. It is possible that since the military fitness tests were recently moved to 12 months postpartum (rather than 6-months postpartum) that differences in postpartum weight retention between active duty and other TRICARE beneficiaries will emerge later as the active duty women begin to prepare for their fitness test. It will be important to examine 12-month postpartum weight retention and fitness test results in this sample, since previous research has indicated that fitness test failures were higher at 6-months postpartum [8, 35–37].\n\nThe stepped-care intervention approach employed in this study provides support for remotely-delivered individualized interventions during the postpartum period. In addition, there were several other strengths of this study, including the randomized design, the large sample size achieved despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the objective weight measurement, and the good retention of participants at 6-months postpartum (88.4%). Further, it appears that the intervention had a similar effect across BMI categories, parity status, breastfeeding status, race, and ethnicity.\n\nHowever, the study was not without limitations. Recruitment materials (i.e., online and printed advertisements) included descriptions of the study intervention as focusing on maintaining healthy weight, including pregnancy weight gain and PPWL; thus, due to the described nature of the intervention, it is possible that participants that were recruited and randomized consisted of individuals that had a higher concern for pregnancy-related weight management and increased motivation for participation than the general population. Furthermore, participants were required to engage in dietary and exercise self-monitoring to experience a main component of the intervention prior to fully enrolling in the 21-months-long study. This behavioral run-in may have also led to enrolling a more weight-conscious sample, although previous weight management research in a military sample found that few potential participants were excluded based on not completing this self-monitoring run-in [38]. Additionally, there was not a no-treatment control group, so it is not clear how much postpartum weight retention would have occurred in the absence of any intervention; however, typical postpartum weight retention is 1.7 kg among civilians [9], but may be higher in a military population since those participants who received only the GWG intervention had weight retention of 2.39 kg. It is also possible that the approximately 24% of the participants with 5 kg or greater weight retention postpartum may have required an even more intensive intervention than the highest step of the current intervention. A potential further limitation is that 90% of the active duty women in this study were associated with the Air Force and Army, limiting our ability to generalize our findings to other military branches. Furthermore, given the relatively low mean BMI in the current sample, generalizability to civilian populations is unknown. Additionally, clinically measured weight by trained research personnel at the clinic at 6-months postpartum was not possible to obtain in the majority of the sample due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, previous research [39] indicates strong concordance between weights on Body Trace e-scales and clinic weights. Further, despite the research team’s efforts to make the intervention broadly appealing for all participants (e.g., imagery used throughout the intervention, culturally-appropriate cookbooks available in the toolbox, selection of interventionists who reflected the patient population in terms of age range, race, and ethnicity), there was lower retention among participants who were younger, those who identified as Black, and those with the lowest education level (i.e., high school degree or GED). Thus, it will be important to conduct formative work to determine important intervention adaptations or key retention strategies, prior to considering broader dissemination. Finally, this study should be considered an unblinded randomized controlled trial, since although we intended to blind the assessor to the randomized condition, staff turnover prevented us from blinding the assessor in every instance. This lack of blinding could have biased the results [40].\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that a remote, diet and physical activity stepped-care behavioral intervention delivered during the postpartum period is marginally effective at reducing weight retention in a diverse sample of women affiliated with the military, which may be beneficial for achieving military fitness standards and avoiding escalating obesity over multiple pregnancies [3]. Taking these findings together with the results from the GWG-focused intervention, the two primary goals for this project were achieved—promoting healthy GWG, which can impact perinatal health outcomes, and healthy PPWL. Therefore, depending on the specific goal of the military health service, the GWG intervention, the PPWL intervention, or both interventions could be appropriate. Future research should investigate the cost-effectiveness and potential dissemination of stepped-care remotely-delivered interventions within the military health care system, as well as investigate the efficacy of a similar stepped-care remotely-delivered postpartum intervention in civilian populations.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nkaad014_suppl_Supplementary_Table\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe research represents a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the United States Air Force (CRADA #18-282-59MDW-C19002).
