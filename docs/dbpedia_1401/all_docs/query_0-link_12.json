        "text": "The estimated lifetime risk of being diagnosed with bowel cancer is 1 in 20 (5%) for females, and 1 in 17 (6%) for males born in 1961 in the UK. [1]\n\nThese figures take account of the possibility that someone can have more than one diagnosis of bowel cancer in their lifetime ('Adjusted for Multiple Primaries' (AMP) method).[2]\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) classify the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1,2] 13% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by eating processed meat.[3]\n\nColon cancer risk is 22% higher per 100/day of red meat intake, a meta-analysis of cohort studies has shown.[4] Rectal cancer risk was not associated with red meat consumption.[4]\n\nBowel cancer risk is 18% higher per 50g/day of processed meat intake, a meta-analysis of cohort studies has shown.[4] Colon cancer risk is 23% higher per 50g/day of processed meat intake while rectal cancer risk may be 8% higher but this is only marginally significant, a meta-analysis of cohort studies has shown.[4] Colon cancer risk is 12% higher per 1mg/day of haem iron intake, a meta-analysis showed;[5] though bowel cancer risk was not associated with dietary iron intake in a pooled analysis of UK cohort studies.[6]\n\nSerrated bowel polyp risk is 23% higher in people with the highest versus lowest levels of red meat intake, a meta-analysis showed.[7]\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) classify the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1,2] 11% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by overweight and obesity.[3]\n\nBody-mass index (BMI)\n\nColon cancer risk is 30% higher in men per 5-unit body mass index (BMI) increase, an umbrella study of meta-analyses showed.[4] Colon cancer risk is 12% higher in women per 5-unit body mass index (BMI) increase, an umbrella study of meta-analyses showed.[4] the association in obese women may be stronger in premenopausal than postmenopausal women.[5]\n\nRectal cancer risk is 9% higher in men per 5-unit body mass index (BMI) increase, an umbrella study of meta-analyses showed.[4] There is no association between BMI and rectal cancer in women.[4]\n\nBowel cancer risk among men is 10% higher per 5 kg gained during adulthood, a meta-analysis showed.[6] Bowel cancer risk among women is not associated with weight gain during adulthood.[6]\n\nBowel adenoma risk is 47% higher in people who are obese by BMI compared with those who are healthy-weight, a meta-analysis showed.[7]\n\nWaist circumference\n\nColon cancer risk is 25% higher in people per 10cm increase in waist circumference, an umbrella study of meta-analyses showed.[4]\n\nBowel cancer risk is 46% higher in people with the largest waist circumference, versus those with the smallest, a meta-analysis showed.[8]\n\nBowel adenoma risk is 39% higher in people with the largest waist circumference, versus those with the smallest, a meta-analysis showed.[9]\n\nUK portrait version shown here. Country versions, cancers caused by other risk factors, and landscape formats are available for free from our cancer risk publications.\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) classify the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1,2] 6% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by alcohol drinking.[3]\n\nBowel cancer risk is 4% higher in people who consume up to 15g (2 units) of alcohol per day, 10-17% higher in people who consume 12-50g (1.5-6 units) of alcohol per day, and 33% higher in those who consume 50g+ (6+ units) of alcohol per day, compared with non or occasional drinkers, meta-analyses have shown.[4,5] Bowel cancer risk increases by 7% per unit of alcohol consumed per day.[6]\n\nBowel cancer risk is 49% higher in people who consume the highest intake of alcohol during their lifetime/over time compared to those who consume the lowest intake of alcohol, a meta-analysis showed.[7]\n\nBowel adenoma risk is 27% higher in people who drink around 3 units per day, a meta-analysis showed; the association is limited to colon adenoma, not rectal.[8]\n\nUK portrait version shown here. Country versions, cancers caused by other risk factors, and landscape formats are available for free from our cancer risk publications.\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1] 7% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by smoking.[2]\n\nBowel cancer risk is 17-21% higher in current cigarette smokers compared with never-smokers, meta-analyses of cohort studies have shown.[3-5] The association may be stronger in males than females, and stronger for rectal than colon cancer.[3-6]\n\nBowel cancer risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, by 7-11% per 10 cigarettes per day, a meta-analysis has shown.[4] Bowel cancer risk is higher in people who start smoking younger.[5]\n\nAdenomatous bowel polyp risk is around twice as high in current smokers compared with never-smokers, a meta-analysis showed.[7]\n\nSerrated bowel polyp risk is more than twice as high in current smokers compared with never- and ex-smokers, a meta-analysis showed.[8]\n\nUK portrait version shown here. Country versions, cancers caused by other risk factors, and landscape formats are available for free from our cancer risk publications.\n\nDiabetes\n\nBowel cancer risk is 22-30% higher in people with type II diabetes, compared with non-diabetics, meta-analyses show.[1-5]\n\nBowel cancer risk among diabetics may vary by treatment type, though treatment type often relates to diabetes stage, which may further confound findings. Bowel cancer risk is lower in metformin users compared with non-users, meta-analyses have shown;[6-8] however this may be for women only.[9] Bowel cancer risk is not associated with insulin use compared with non-use, meta-analyses of cohort studies have shown.[10,11]\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nBowel cancer risk is 70% higher in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (ulcerative or Crohn's colitis) compared with the general population, a meta-analysis showed.[12] Bowel cancer risk increases with extent and duration of IBD; patients who have IBD for 20 years or more have a 5% risk of developing bowel cancer.[12,13] Bowel cancer risk may vary by location of IBD lesions.[14]\n\nAdenomas\n\nAround 1% of people with larger (20mm+) adenomas, or adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, develop bowel cancer within around 4 years of having their adenomas removed, a pooled analysis showed.[15] Risk of advanced bowel cancer is 80% higher in people with low-risk polyps detected at first colonoscopy, compared with people with no polyps detected at first colonoscopy, a meta-analysis showed.[16]\n\nAspirin\n\nBowel cancer risk is 17% lower in people who haveever used aspirin, compared with non-users, a meta-analysis of cohort studies showed.[17] The longer the duration of use, the lower the risk.[17]\n\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1] 2% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by ionising radiation.[2]\n\nColon cancer risk is 53% higher in atomic bomb survivors compared with the general population, a cohort study has shown.[3] Rectal cancer is 43% higher in people who have received radiotherapy to the pelvic region for a primary cancer compared to patients who were not irradiated, a meta-analysis showed.[4]\n\nBowel cancer risk decreases with increasing age at radiation exposure.[4] Less than 1% of people chronically exposed to 0.1Gy radiation in early childhood will develop bowel cancer in their lifetime.[5]\n\nFamily history\n\nAround 20% of bowel cancers are associated with hereditary factors other than Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).[1]\n\nBowel cancer risk is more than doubled in people with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) with the disease, a meta-analysis showed.[2] Bowel cancer risk among people with a first-degree family history is higher in those with more than one affected relative, or a relative diagnosed at a younger age.[2,3]\n\nBowel adenoma risk is 70% higher in people with a first-degree relative with bowel cancer, a meta-analysis showed.[4]\n\nBowel cancer risk is not associated with having an adoptive parent with the disease, a cohort study showed; this may indicate genetic/biological factors rather than environmental factors underpin the familial risk.[5]\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) accounts for less than 1% of bowel cancers.[6] Almost all FAP patients develop bowel cancer by age 40.[7]\n\nHereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)\n\nHereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) accounts for 1-4% of colon cancers.[6] Around 9 in 10 males and 7 in 10 females with HNPCC develop bowel cancer by age 70.[8]\n\nBRCA1\n\nBRCA1 mutations may account for some bowel cancers, particularly in younger women.[9]\n\nWorld Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) classifies the role of this risk factor in cancer development.[1] 5% of bowel cancer cases in the UK are caused by too little physical activity.[2]\n\nColon cancer risk is 19% lower in individuals with the highest level of total physical activity (recreational, commuting, occupational and household) compared to individuals with the lowest level, an umbrella of systematic reviews showed [3] Colon cancer risk is 11% lower in individuals in the low active group (600-3999 MET minutes/week), 19% lower in the moderately active group (4000-7999 MET minutes/week) and 21% lower in the highly active group (≥8000 MET minutes/week) compared to insufficiently active individuals (≤ 600 MET minutes/week of total physical activity across all domains), a meta-analysis showed.[4]\n\nRectal cancer risk is 12% lower in people with the highest category of occupational physical activity compared to people in the lowest category, a meta-analysis showed.[5] No effect on rectal cancer risk was seen for recreational physical activity, transport-related physical activity or household-related physical activity, the meta-analysis showed.[5] Rectal cancer risk is 6% higher in the most sedentary people compared with the least, a meta-analysis of cohort studies showed.[6]\n\nColorectal cancer risk is 17% higher in people with the highest daily TV viewing time, 6% higher in people with the highest daily total sitting time and 15% higher in people with the highest daily occupational sitting time compared to the those in the lowest groups, a meta-analysis showed.[7]"
