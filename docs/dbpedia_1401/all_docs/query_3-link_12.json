Here’s where Notre Dame was ranked in the preseason and final AP polls during the previous 12 seasons:\n\nYear Preseason Final 1987 18 17 1988 13 1 1989 2 2 1990 2 6 1991 6 13 1992 3 4 1993 7 2 1994 2 NR 1995 9 11 1996 6 19 1997 11 NR 1998 22 22 1999 18 ??\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTES\n\nRECAPPING THE PITTSBURGH GAME\n\n? Pittsburgh used a big second half to pull away from the Irish in the final game at Pittsburgh Stadium, 37-27. Jarious Jackson (22-for-38, 317 yards-most by an Irish QB since 1979-with 2 TDs, 1 INT) and Bobby Brown (12 catches for 208 yards, TD) enjoyed career-best days, with Brown’s 12 catches tying for second-most in Irish history in a single game. The Irish owned a 410-389 edge in total yards but managed just 72 rushing yards on 32 carries (2.3 per rush). Pitt backup quarterback John Turman completed 10 of 27 passes for 231 yards, with a pair of TDs and one interception. Latef Grim (120 yards) and Antonio Bryant (95 yards, 2 TDs) both had four catches for the Panthers while Kevan Barlow (19 rushes for 71 yards, 2 TDs) and Nick Goings (15 for 65) enjoyed solid days on the ground.\n\n? The teams played to a 10-10 tie at halftime, with Jim Sanson kicking a 36-yard FG for the Irish while Jackson capped a 10-play, 57-yard drive with a five-yard TD pass to Joey Getehrall. Pittsburgh opened the scoring with a nine-yard TD catch by Bryant before taking a 10-3 lead on a 24-yard FG from Nick Lotz. The Panthers cashed in their second drive of the second half, moving 56 yards in three plays on a 44-yard catch by Bryant and a pair of Barlow runs. The Irish answered two drives later with a 21-yard TD pass from receiver David Givens to Brown. Pitt stretched to a 27-17 lead behind a Lotz 33-yarder and a 28-yard catch by Bryant, after ND’s Tony Fisher had fumbled at the Irish 38-yard line. The Irish then scored quickly, covering 64 yards on pass plays to Brown (37) and Givens (27-yard TD). Lotz pushed the lead to 30-24 on a 44-yarder with 11:03 left to play but Sanson matched him with a 39-yarder. The teams then traded punts before the Panthers picked off a Jackson pass near midfield and iced the game with a 10-play, 44-yard drive, capped by Barlow’s two-yard TD run.\n\nNOTRE DAME FOOTBALL “CENTURY OF GREATNESS” MOMENTS\n\n? Notre Dame’s 1988 football team claimed a unanimous number-one ranking following that season, thanks to a 12-0 record and a victory over third-rated West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl. Now, 11 years later, that same Irish team has earned yet another number-one finish. Notre Dame’s 31-30 triumph over top-rated Miami in ’88 has been voted the greatest moment in the last century of Irish football, as part of the Century of Greatness program that has run throughout the ’99 Notre Dame season. That midseason victory in ’88 over the ‘Canes ended up atop the list – and was followed, in order, by the Irish comeback to defeat Houston in the ’79 Cotton Bowl (second), Notre Dame’s ’93 win against top-rated Florida State (third), the Irish win over Army in ’28 in the “Win One for the Gipper” game (fourth) and Notre Dame’s ’77 win over USC that featured a switch to green jerseys (fifth).\n\n? The vote totals result from balloting at area Meijer stores and on Notre Dame’s athletic web site (www.und.com) throughout August – and from ballots distributed at Notre Dame’s season-opening football game against Kansas. The Century of Greatness program has been a joint promotional effort of the University of Notre Dame, Host Communications and University Netcasting, with Meijer and Coke as the title sponsors. Coke has been distributing a series of trading cards throughout the season in 12-packs sold at area Meijer stores. The top 20 moments will be featured in a special 24-page insert in the Notre Dame-Boston College game program produced for that Nov. 20 contest. There will be special ceremonies at that game recognizing the final vote totals. Host Communications has produced a 45-minute video highlighting the top 20 moments. It will be available beginning tomorrow at area Meijer stores, the Notre Dame Bookstore and other outlets.\n\n? Here’s the other top 20 moments: 6. 1935 – Notre Dame knocks off Ohio State in “Game of the Century”, 7. 1989 – Raghib Ismail returns two kickoffs for TDs as Irish beat #2 Michigan, 8. 1924 – Grantland Rice christens Four Horsemen after 13-7 win over Army, 9. 1966 – Irish and Michigan State end epic matchup in 10-10 ties, 10. 1973 – Notre Dame prevails 24-23 in Sugar Bowl game against No. 1 Alabama, 11. 1957 – Notre Dame’s 7-0 win ends Oklahoma’s record 47-game win streak, 12. 1987 – Tim Brown returns two punts for TDs as Irish beat Michigan State, 13. 1992 – Mirer throws for two-point conversion to beat Penn State in the snow, 14. 1913 – Rockne and Dorais popularize forward pass in 35-13 Irish win at Army, 15. 1946 – Notre Dame and Army battle to 0-0 tie at Yankee Stadium, 16. 1977 – Notre Dame knocks off top-rated Texas in Cotton Bowl to claim No. 1 spot, 17. 1988 – Irish defeat No. 3 West Virginia 34-21 in Fiesta Bowl to clinch national title, 18. 1974 – Notre Dame holds off No. 1 Alabama in Orange Bowl in Ara’s last game, 19. 1980 – Oliver’s 51-yard field goal as time expires beats Michigan, 20. 1991 – Bettis’ second-half runs enable Irish to beat Florida in Sugar Bowl.\n\nThe Sunday Wrap-Up\n\nBob Davie holds a media briefing at 11:30 a.m. each Sunday following Irish games.

The replays are available in many major markets, via over-the-air syndication, including WNDU-TV in South Bend and TCI Cable (channel 3).\n\nThe Davie Show\n\nBob Davie’s half-hour, weekly television show is syndicated nationally by Host Communications, produced by Golden Dome Productions and hosted by Jeff Jeffers. The show is carried by WNDU-TV in the South Bend market on the following Saturday and on FoxSports-Chicago on Monday afternoon.\n\nRADIO CALL-IN SHOW\n\nThe 1999 football season marks the debut of The Bob Davie Radio Show on WNDV-AM (1490) and WNDV-FM (92.9).

Notre Dame freshman TB Julius Jones (Big Stone Gap, Va.) and his brother Thomas Jones, a senior TB at Virginia, have combined for nearly 1,300 all-purpose yards during the past three weeks. The elder Jones brother currently leads the nation with 170.70 rushing yards per game (306 rushes for 1,707 yards, 15 TDs and 5.6 per rush).\n\n? Julius Jones has totaled 533 all-purpose yards during the past three games, with 183 versus Navy (19 rushes for 146, 1 catch for 9, 2 punt returns for 5, 1 kick return for 23) and 176 at Tennessee (12 rushes for 46, 1 catch for 32, 1 PR for 5, 4 KR for 93) before totaling 174 at Pittsburgh (5 rushes for 10, 1 PR for 1, 7 KRs for 163).\n\n? Thomas Jones has racked up 753 yards in his last three games, including back-to-back games versus top-10 teams. He had 207 yards versus top-ranked Florida State (26 rushes for 164 and a TD, 6 catches for 26, 2 PR for 17), 215 versus ninth-ranked Georgia Tech (39 rushes for 213 and 2 TDs, 1 catch for 2) and 331 at Buffalo (32 rushes for 221, 2 catches for 110, including an 84-yard scoring play).\n\nTHE JJ CONNECTION\n\nPlayers with the initials “JJ” have had a particular impact for the Irish in 1999, especially in the comeback win over Navy:\n\n? Jarious Jackson – record-setting signalcaller who has ranked as high as third nationally in passing efficiency, has engineered several Irish comeback efforts in 1999 season, including thrilling wins over USC and Navy.\n\n? Julius Jones – rookie tailback who ran for 146 yards vs. Navy (most by an Irish rookie since 1975) on the same day that his brother Thomas took over the NCAA rushing lead with a 164-yard rushing day versus top-ranked Florida State.\n\n? Jay Johnson – senior receiver who caught game-winning TD pass from 16 yards out versus Navy with 0:36 left to play. Two of his first three catches in 1999 went for TDs (he also caught a 31-yarder in the win over Arizona State).\n\n? Jim Jones – key cog in young offensive line, starting first 10 games at left guard before suffering arch injury in Pittsburgh game.\n\n? Jackson (Tupelo HS) and Johnson (Starkville HS) are the only Mississippi natives on the Notre Dame roster and faced each other during their high school careers.\n\n10-GAME CHECKUP\n\n? With 10 of 12 regular-season games in the books, Notre Dame is on pace to challenge the team record for total passing yards (2,527 in 10 games during 1970, on pace for 2,848 in ’99, including a 10-game total of 2,373).\n\n? On a per-game basis, the 1999 Irish offense stacks up with the record-setting 1970 aerial game, with 27.6 pass attempts/gm (28.3 in ’70), 16.2 completions/gm (16.2 in ’70) and 237.3 passing yards/gm (252.7 in ’70). The Irish own a .587 pass completion pct. (the record of .638 was set in ’93) while averaging 8.60 yards/pass att. (record of 10.0 in ’93) and 14.07 yards per completion (record of 17.5 in ’64).\n\n? Jarious Jackson could challenge Irish record for single-season passing efficiency (142.07, record is 154.4) and could threaten the Irish season records for passing attempts (on pace for 316, record is 298), completions (187, 182), completion pct. (.593, .616), passing yards (2,764, 2,429) and TD passes (17, 19). On a per-game basis, Jackson also could be in the running to set records for pass attempts/gm (26.3, record is 28.1), completions/gm (15.6, 16.6), passing yards/gm (230.3, 242.9), passing yards per attempt (8.8, 10.1) and passing yards per completion (14.8, 18.1).\n\nTHE THREE KEYS\n\nIrish head coach Bob Davie has cited the following areas as keys to the success of the Irish during the past two seasons: turnover margin, “red-zone” efficiency and success in close games. Notre Dame was +7 in turnover margin during the 1998 season but is -1 in ’99. The Irish scored on 91.1 percent of their red-zone chances in ’98 while averaging 4.9 points per red-zone chance (those numbers are down to 66.7 percent, 3.9 points per chance in ’99). The Irish went 4-1 in 1998 in games decided by 1-7 points (they are 3-2 so far in 1999 close games).\n\nWINS AND LOSSES\n\nNotre Dame is averaging 263.4 rushing yards per game (5.2 per rush) in its five wins this season and just 104.6 in its five losses (2.8 per rush). Other noteworthy comparisons from 1999 wins and losses include: Jarious Jackson’s rushing yards (379 total in the five wins, 38 in the five losses), turnover ratio (+7 in wins, -8 in losses), third-down conversion pct. (.480, .391), first-quarter scoring (+20, -10) and third-quarter scoring (+32, -21).\n\nOFFENSIVE LINE FACES MORE CHALLENGES\n\nThe ND offensive line-which must overcome the injuries to three starters-has met the challenge at times during the 1999 season of helping ignite the offense, by playing its role in a win over Oklahoma that included 284 rushing yards and 566 yards of total offense. A quick glance at some comparative statistics show that the ’99 line has faced a different challenge than the veteran ’98 unit:\n\n’98 after 10 games (season total) ’99 after 10 games Rushing Offense 221.5 (212.5) 184.2 Rushing TDs 22 20 Scoring Offense 30.0 (27.3) 28.2 Sacks Allowed 9 for 45 yards 29 for 191 yards OL Starters Career Starts 102 35 Top Career Rusher Autry Denson, 4272 yds Jarious Jackson, 844 yds Top Rusher (yards/gm) Autry Denson, 113.0 Tony Fisher, 60.6\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nThe arrival of first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers has left its mark on the 1999 season statistics, as the passing game has become a bigger part of the Irish offense while the Irish have racked up more points in the first quarter than in 1998:\n\n’98 after 10 games (season total) ’99 after 10 games Passing Offense 177.5 (169.9) 237.3 Passing TDs 13 (13) 15 Total Offense 399.0 (382.5) 421.5 Rushing First Downs 112 87 Passing First Downs 81 105 Total First Downs 160 203 Pct. of First Downs Passing 39.7 pct. 51.7 pct. First-Quarter Scoring 61-58, plus 3 47-37, plus 10\n\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT\n\nA comparison of Notre Dame’s stats through the first nine games of 1998 (when the Irish were 9-1) and 1999 indicate several areas that are in need of improvement:\n\n’98 after 10 games (season total) ’99 after 10 games Turnovers 13 25 Turnovers Forced 23 24 Turnover Ratio +10 -1 Third-Quarter Scoring 94-16, plus 78 84-73, plus 11 Third-Down Conversion Pct. 47 pct. (63-135) 44 pct. (64-147)\n\nTAKING BACK HOME FIELD\n\nNotre Dame has won 14 of its last 15 games at Notre Dame Stadium.\n\n? After sporting a home record of just 17-7 from 1994-97, Notre Dame in 1998 surged to a 6-0 home record for the first time since the ’88 team went 7-0 at home.\n\n? The Irish ended ’97 with home wins over Boston College, Navy and No. 22 West Virginia, yielding a 10-game home winning streak (including the 1999 opener versus Kansas) that ended with the 23-13 loss to Michigan State on Sept. 18, 1999 (the Irish have bounced back to win the last four home games). That 10-game home win streak was the longest by an Irish team since a 19-game run at home from Sept. 19, 1987 to Sept. 29, 1990.\n\n? Notre Dame in ’98 posted its first unbeaten season at home since ’89 (5-0) and their second unbeaten home season with six-plus wins (the 1988 national championship team was 7-0 at home).\n\n? The longest home win streak at Notre Dame Stadium is 28 games, from Nov. 21, 1942, to Sept. 30, 1950. The program’s longest all-time home winning streak is 40 games, from Nov. 9, 1907 to Nov. 17, 1917 (Notre Dame Stadium opened in 1930).\n\nHOLDING ONTO THE BALL\n\n? The Notre Dame offense totaled no turnovers versus both Oklahoma and Arizona State, marking the first time that an Irish team had gone back-to-back games without a turnover since 1993. Taking care of the ball was a hallmark of that talented 1993 squad, which had six games without a turnover, including the second and third games of the season (vs. Michigan and Michigan State) and a four-game streak of no turnovers later in the season (vs. BYU, USC, Navy and Florida State).\n\n? The no-turnover stretch spanned 32 drives by the Irish offense and 151 plays from scrimmage (not including punts and field goal attempts).\n\nRED-ZONE REPORT\n\n? Notre Dame and its ’99 opponents have similar “red-zone” success, with the Irish totaling 164 red-zone points (converting 28-of-42 chances) while the first 10 opponents have combined for a lower red-zone point total of 159 (33-of-38). Despite a conversion edge for the opponents, the Notre Dame “bend-but-don’t-break” defense has allowed just 19 red-zone touchdowns (in 38 opponent chances) while the Irish offense has cashed in 23 TDs after crossing the opponent’s 20-yard line (in 42 chances).\n\n? Including the drive at Purdue that was halted when time ran out, Notre Dame has scored on just 19 of its last 32 red-zone chances (15 TDs, four FGs, four turnovers, six missed/blocked FGs, two failed fourth downs and one time-expired).\n\n? Despite scoring seven TDs in the ’99 opening win over Kansas, Notre Dame ventured into the “red zone” just three times (two defensive TDs, three long runs from scrimmage). The Irish scored two TDs and had a FG blocked in red zone chances vs. KU, which marched inside the Irish 20 just once (TD). The Irish scored TDs on all three red-zone chances at Michigan while UM had four FGs and two TDs in seven chances (missed FG). Notre Dame’s five chances at Purdue yielded three TDs, one FG and the final drive where time expired (Purdue cashed in all four chances, with two TDs and two FGs).\n\n? Michigan State was 4-for-4 in the red zone (TD, 3 FGs) while the Irish had a TD, FG, one INT and two fumbles on five chances. Oklahoma turned both of its red-zone chances into passing TDs while the Irish had three rushing TDs, one passing TD and two missed FGs.\n\n? Due to an assortment of big offensive scoring plays and an INT returned for a TD, the Irish had just three red-zone chances vs. ASU (rush TD, pass TD, missed FG). ASU had four chances, with two TDs , a FG and a missed FG. The Irish were 5-for-7 in the red zone vs. USC (2 FGs, 3 TDs, missed FG, turnover) while USC was 3-for-3 (2 TDs, FG). Notre Dame had two TDs and a missed FG in the red zone vs. Navy, which had a TD, FG and turnover in its three red-zone chances. At Tennessee, the Irish had two TDs, a FG miss and a failed fourth down on red-zone chances (UT had three TDs and was 1-2 on FGs). The Irish had a TD, FG and failed fourth down in three red-zone chances vs. Pitt (Pitt had three TDs and three FGs in six chances).\n\n? Notre Dame in ’98 came away with points in 41 of 45 red-zone chances (91.1 percent)-including TDs on 71 percent-while opponents posted points on just 72 percent of their chances (barely over half of the opposing chances, 22 of 43, produced TDs).\n\n? The Irish converted nearly 20 percent more of their red-zone chances than their ’98 opponents (.911-.721) and were +69 in red-zone points (219-150).\n\nNOTRE DAME IN ’99 Category ’99 OPPONENTS 42 Red-Zone Chances 38 9 Passing TDs 9 14 Rushing TDs 10 23 Total TDs 19 .548 (23/42) TD Pct. .500 (19/38) 5 FGs Made 14 5/2 FGs Missed/Blocked 2/1 164 Total Points (TD-6, FG-3) 159 .667 (28/42) Scoring Pct. .868 (33/38)\n\n1999 Notre Dame Opponent UPDATE\n\nBelow is a look at Notre Dame opponents’ recent results and upcoming games. Since ’77, when the NCAA started rating strength of schedule, Notre Dame’s schedule has been rated the most difficult five times in the last 21 years (’78, ’85, ’87, ’89 and ’95), with the ’99 schedule ranking 12th-toughest in the nation (as of Nov. 8), with a .596 opponent winning pct. (62-42) according to the NCAA formula (Alabama is first, at 64-28/.696). The NCAA formula compiles games vs. Division I-A schools and takes out the results vs. Notre Dame.\n\nOpponent ’99 Record Nov. 13 Nov. 20 Kansas 4-7 L, 13-45, at Oklahoma State Iowa State Michigan 8-2 W, 31-27, at Penn State Ohio State Purdue 6-4 Idle at Indiana Michigan State 8-2 W, 34-0, at Northwestern Penn State Oklahoma 6-3 W, 31-10, at Iowa State at Texas Tech Arizona State 5-5 L, 30-50, Stanford Arizona USC 4-6 Idle UCLA Navy 4-6 W, 45-21, Tulane at Hawaii Tennessee 7-2 L, 24-28, at Arkansas at Kentucky Pittsburgh 5-5 W, 37-27, Notre Dame Idle Boston College 7-2 W, 34-17, West Virginia at Notre Dame Stanford 6-3 W, 50-30, at Arizona State California\n\n1999 Opponents’ Combined Record (not including ND games): 65-42 (.608)\n\nIRISH IN THE ’99 NFL\n\nNotre Dame for the fifth straight season in ’99 had more former players on opening-day rosters in the NFL than any other school (42), ahead of Florida State (39), North Carolina (36), Penn State (33), Washington (33) and Florida (32). Former Notre Dame players occupied rosters on 23 different teams. Irish players currently in the NFL include nine OL, seven DBs, six DL, five WRs, four RBs, three LBs, three TEs, two QBs, two punters and one kicker.\n\nARIZONA CARDINALS\n\nTE Derek Brown\n\nBUFFALO BILLS\n\nOL Dusty Zeigler\n\nCAROLINA PANTHERS\n\nQB Steve Beuerlein, RB Anthony Johnson\n\nCHICAGO BEARS\n\nCB Tom Carter, DT Jim Flanigan, OL Jerry Wisne\n\nCINCINNATI BENGALS\n\nOL Mike Doughty, DL Oliver Gibson\n\nCLEVELAND BROWNS\n\nFB Marc Edwards, TE Irv Smith\n\nDALLAS COWBOYS\n\nFL Raghib Ismail\n\nDETROIT LIONS\n\nTE Pete Chryplewicz, LB Scott Kowalkowski\n\nINDIANAPOLIS COLTS\n\nLB Bert Berry, CB Jeff Burris, WR Lake Dawson, P Hunter Smith\n\nJACKSONVILLE JAGUARS\n\nDT Renaldo Wynn\n\nKANSAS CITY CHIEFS\n\nC Tim Grunhard\n\nMIAMI DOLPHINS\n\nC Tim Ruddy, CB Shawn Wooden\n\nNEW YORK GIANTS\n\nOL Luke Petitgout, OL Mike Rosenthal\n\nNEW YORK JETS\n\nQB Rick Mirer\n\nOAKLAND RAIDERS\n\nWR Tim Brown\n\nPHILADELPHIA EAGLES\n\nCB Bobby Taylor, CB Allen Rossum\n\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS\n\nFB Jerome Bettis, S Travis Davis, WR Malcolm Johnson\n\nST.

Notre Dame leads its series with Boston College 8-2, including a 4-1 mark in games at Notre Dame Stadium and four consecutive wins overall (1995-98).\n\n? The series has been continuous since 1992 (this will be the eighth consecutive meeting) and is slated to continue on a home-and-home basis through at least 2004.\n\n? The first game of the series was held at Foxboro Stadium in 1975 (a 17-3 Irish win in Dan Devine’s first game as head coach) while the other neutral-field game in the series was at Memphis, Tenn., in the 1983 Liberty Bowl (a 19-18 win for the Irish over the 13th-ranked Eagles).\n\n? The first eight games of the series saw at least one team ranked in that week’s AP poll, with the higher-ranked team holding just a 5-3 edge. The upsets: Notre Dame over No. 13 Boston College in the 1983 Liberty Bowl (19-18), No. 16 Boston College at top-ranked Notre Dame in 1993 (41-39) and unranked BC at home over No. 8 Notre Dame in 1994 (30-11).\n\n? Boston College’s win at Notre Dame Stadium in 1993 ruined an Irish undefeated season, a week after Notre Dame took over the top spot in the polls by beating Florida State (31-24). David Gordon’s field goal as time ran out handed Boston College that 41-39 victory.\n\nRECAPPING NOTRE DAME’S 1998 WIN AT BOSTON COLLEGE\n\nNotre Dame escaped with a 31-26 win, thanks to a goalline stand that included two tackles by senior ILB Bobbie Howard, a third-down stop at the goal stripe by senior ILB Jimmy Friday and junior FS Deke Cooper’s clinching stop of Mike Cloud at the two-yard line. The Eagles had first and goal from the four-yard line with 1:07 to play, with Cloud running each play (2 yards, 1 yard, no gain, loss of 1). Offensive heroes for the Irish included senior SE Malcolm Johnson (6 catches, 150 yards-most by an Irish players since 1994, 1 TD), senior TB Autry Denson (28 rushes, 128 yards, 2 TDs) and senior QB Jarious Jackson (10 for 21, 210 yards, 2 TDs). BC enjoyed a 318-210 edge in passing yards but Howard’s interception and 11-yard return to the BC 11-yard line set up Jackson’s eight-yard TD toss to Johnson for a 24-17 Irish lead. BC held a 17-14 halftime lead but the Irish scored 10 points in the third period. Denson’s one-yard run capped the opening Irish drive while Jackson threaded a 28-yard TD pass to sophomore FL Joey Getherall in the second quarter. Denson’s two-yard run gave the Irish a 31-20 lead with 9:23 left to play.\n\nCONNECTIONS\n\n? First-year Notre Dame assistant coach Jerry Rosburg (outside linebackers, special teams) spent the 1997 and ’98 seasons as the secondary coach at Boston College.\n\n? Notre Dame and Boston College are the only two Catholic universities playing Division I-A football.\n\n? Former Irish Hall of Fame coach Frank Leahy coached the Eagles for two seasons in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Notre Dame.\n\n? The winner of this game earns the Frank Leahy Memorial Bowl, given by the Notre Dame Club of Boston, and the Ireland Trophy, presented by Notre Dame student government. The Ireland Trophy is intended to inspire a spirit of sportsmanship and friendly competition between the schools.\n\nTHE CLOSE CALLS\n\nFour of the previous 10 games in the ND-BC series have been decided by a touchdown or less: Notre Dame’s upset of 19th-ranked Boston College in the 1983 Liberty Bowl (19-18), a 32-25 win by the No. 9 Irish in 1987, BC’s last-second, 41-39 win at Notre Dame in 1993 (the Irish were ranked No. 1 and the Eagles No. 16 in that game) and last year’s goalline stand by the Irish (31-26).\n\nFRIEND OR FOE?\n\nNotre Dame’s 1999 roster includes no Massachusetts natives and players from 30 states while the Boston College roster includes 15 Massachusetts natives and players from 15 others states (plus three players from Canada). Several Notre Dame and Boston College players hail from the same hometown and/or high school, among them:\n\n? Notre Dame senior TE Dan O’Leary (Westlake, Ohio) and two BC players all attended St. Ignatius (Ohio) HS: sophomore LB Nick Blevins (Westlake, Ohio) and senior DL Chris Hovan (Rocky River, Ohio).\n\n? Notre Dame sophomore LB Rocky Boiman and BC junior OL John Richardson were teammates at St. Xavier (Ohio) HS and are Cincinnati natives.\n\n? Irish senior OG Rob Mowl (Woodland Hills HS) and BC senior TE Bryan Arndt (Central Catholic HS) both hail from Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n? Irish junior OL John Teasdale and BC junior DL Pat Kneib both are natives of Kansas City, Mo., and are former Rockhurst HS teammates.\n\n? Notre Dame freshman TE Gary Godsey (Tampa) and BC sophomore TE Josh Cervie (Valrico) were teammates at Jesuit HS. BC sophomore DB Marco Williamis (Hillsborough HS) also hails from Tampa.\n\n? Irish junior C JW Jordan and BC freshman DB Brian Flores are natives of Brooklyn, N.Y., and were teammates at Brooklyn Poly Prep.\n\n? Notre Dame freshman punter Joey Hildbold (Centreville) and BC freshman QB Kevin Kiley (Fairfax Station) were teammates at Robinson (Va.) HS.\n\n? Irish sophomore CB Shane Walton (Bishops HS) and BC senior kicker John Matich (Mira Mesa HS) both hail from San Diego, Calif.\n\n? Notre Dame sophomore CB Clifford Jefferson (Carter HS) and BC sophomore punter Kevin McMyler (Jesuit HS) are natives of Dallas, Texas.\n\nRECORDS SET IN THE ND-BC SERIES\n\n? Mark Green is the last Notre Dame player to total eight consecutive rushing attempts, doing so vs. Boston College in 1987 (he shares that Irish record with three others).\n\n? Allen Rossum’s average of 26.4 yards per kickoff return vs. Boston College in 1997 (five returns for 132 yards) ranks second in the Irish record book.\n\n? Boston College’s Glenn Foley tossed four touchdown passes vs. the Irish in 1993 to earn a share of the Notre Dame opponent record (shared by six others, including current NBC commentator and former USC signalcaller Pat Haden).\n\n? Robert Farmer’s 81-yard run from scrimmage versus Boston College in 1996 is tied for 11th in Notre Dame history and remains the longest run by an Irish player since Eric Pennick’s memorable 85-yard scamper vs. USC in 1973.\n\nRECAPPING BOSTON COLLEGE’S LAST TRIP TO NOTRE DAME\n\nNotre Dame roared to a 28-0 lead, scoring on four of its first five possessions on its way to a 52-20 win over Boston College at Notre Dame Stadium on Oct. 25, 1997. The Irish accumulated 323 passing yards, their most since the ’92 Michigan State game, plus 203 more on the ground. That offensive dominance, combined with Irish TDs on their final three possessions, put the game away. Ron Powlus completed 18 of 31 passes for 267 yards and a pair of TDs while Jarious Jackson scored twice on short runs, completed three of four throws for 56 yards and led the Irish on scoring drives of 83 and 90 yards. Allen Rossum tied an NCAA career record with his eighth return for TD (combined interceptions, kickoffs and punts), thanks to an 80-yard kickoff return for a score. The Irish defense set the tone early, holding the Eagles without first downs on four of Boston College’s first five possessions.\n\nTHE BC SERIES\n\nAll-Time Series: Notre Dame leads 8-2-0\n\nAt Notre Dame Stadium: Notre Dame leads 4-1-0\n\nAt Alumni Stadium: Notre Dame leads 2-1-0\n\nSeries Streak: Notre Dame 4 wins (1995-98)\n\nSite Year Rank W/L/T ND BC 1975 4- W 17 3 1983 -13 W 19 18 * 1987 9- W 32 25 1992 8-9 W 54 7 * 1993 1-16 L 39 41 1994 8- L 11 30 * 1995 12- W 20 10 * 1996 17- W 48 21 1997 W 52 20 1998 13- W 31 26\n\nRankings refer to AP poll\n\n* – Notre Dame Stadium\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\n? Notre Dame faced teams from eight different conferences/affiliations during the 1998 season and is scheduled to face teams from six different leagues in 1999, including three each from the Big Ten (Michigan, Purdue, Michigan State) and the Pac-10 (Arizona State, USC, Stanford), two each from the Big 12 (Kansas, Oklahoma) and the BIG EAST (Pittsburgh, Boston College), plus Tennessee (Southeastern) and Navy (independent).\n\n? In 1998, the Irish played the above Pac-10 and Big-10 teams, in addition to Boston College, Navy, Army (Conference USA), Baylor (Big 12), LSU (Southeastern) and Georgia Tech (Atlantic Coast).\n\nNotre Dame vs. BIG EAST TEAMS\n\nSchool Won Lost Tied Pct.

Notre Dame has won nearly 73 percent of its games (69-27-2) vs. teams that currently comprise the BIG EAST Conference, with 58 of those 98 games vs. former independent Pittsburgh.\n\n? The Irish own a winning series record versus all six BIG EAST teams they have faced.\n\n? Notre Dame is 14-3 versus BIG EAST teams during the 1990s, including eight straight victories prior to last week’s loss at Pittsburgh.\n\n? Prior to last week, Notre Dame had not lost to a BIG EAST team since the 11th-ranked Irish were upset, 30-11, at Boston College on Oct. 8, 1994 … since that game, Notre Dame has posted a 20-10 win over BC in 1995, a 60-6 win over Pittsburgh in ’96 (the Irish were No. 14), a 62-0 victory over Rutgers in the ’96 season finale (the Irish were No. 10), a 45-21 win at Pitt in ’97, a 52-20 home win over BC in ’97, a 21-14 win over No. 22 West Virginia in the final home game of the ’97 season and a 31-26 win at Boston College in 1998.\n\n? The last Notre Dame-Miami game came in 1990 and is one of the most memorable games in the series, as Raghib Ismail returned a kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown and Craig Hentrich kicked a Notre Dame record five field goals to help the sixth-ranked Irish upset the No. 2 Hurricanes, 29-20, at Notre Dame Stadium.\n\n? ND capped its 1988 national championship season with a 34-21 Fiesta Bowl victory over third-ranked West Virginia.\n\n? Notre Dame’s last game versus Syracuse came in 1963, a 14-7 home victory for the Orangemen.\n\n? Notre Dame has never played Temple or Virginia Tech.\n\nTHE 1999 NCAA STATS\n\nUpdated 1999 NCAA stat rankings for Notre Dame and Boston College (top 50 for team ranks):\n\nTeam Rankings\n\nNotre Dame Boston College Rushing Offense 24th at 184.2 26th at 178.4 Passing Offense 36th at 237.3 202.2 Total Offense 19th at 421.50 380.67 Scoring Offense 45th at 28.2 24.9 Rushing Defense, yards 145.4 48th at 137.1 Passing Efficiency Defense 120.0 127.6 Total Defense 369.0 369.7 Scoring Defense 26.0 27th at 19.9 Net Punting 35.8 32.0 Punt Returns 46th at 9.8 32nd at 10.8 Kickoff Returns 19th at 23.2 39th at 21.7 Turnover Margin -0.10/gm (-1 overall) -0.11/gm (-1 overall)\n\nIndividual Rankings\n\nNotre Dame Boston College Rushing Cedric Washington 18th at 108.00 Passing Efficiency Jarious Jackson 13th at 142.1 rating pts Total Offense Jarious Jackson 16th at 272.00 Kickoff Returns Julius Jones 44th at 22.38 All-Purpose Runners Cedric Washington\n\nTHEY SHALL RETURN\n\n? During the past 14 seasons (’86-’99), Notre Dame has produced 49 TDs over the course of 43 games via kickoff, punt and interception returns-including A’Jani Sanders’ pair of interceptions vs. ASU (in ’98 and ’99), Bobbie Howard’s interception vs. LSU (in ’98) and Deveron Harper’s INT in the ’99 opener vs. Kansas. (Those numbers don’t include several fumble returns for touchdowns, with recent ones coming from Deke Cooper at Michigan State in ’98, Lamont Bryant vs. LSU in ’98 and Anthony Denman vs. KU in ’99).\n\n? By comparison, Notre Dame’s opponent in the past 14 seasons have combined for just nine total returns for touchdowns (on kicks, punts or interceptions).\n\n? Since the start of ’86, the Irish have produced their most returns vs. Pittsburgh (seven), with four each vs. Air Force, Michigan, Michigan State and Purdue.\n\n? The 49 returns have come from 27 players, including nine by Allen Rossum (an NCAA record), six by Raghib Ismail, five by Tim Brown and three by Ricky Watters.\n\n? Despite totaling 30 TD returns on kickoffs and punts during the past 14 seasons, Notre Dame is in the midst of a kick-return-for-TD drought.\n\n? The Irish have not returned a kickoff for a touchdown in the last 28 games, since Allen Rossum returned the opening kickoff 93 yards for a score versus Pittsburgh on Oct. 11, 1997 (Jarious Jackson later had a more unconventional return for a TD in that game, scoring from 40 yards out on an onside kick).\n\n? The Irish have gone 36 games since their last punt return for a TD, stretching back to the Nov. 16, 1996, game versus Pittsburgh that produced three Irish punt return TDs (two by Rossum, covering 83 and 55 yards, and the last by Autry Denson for 74 yards).\n\nCOACHING CONNECTIONS\n\nBC offensive line coach David Magazu has past coaching experience with several members of the current Irish football staff: offensive coordinator Kevin Rogers, defensive coordinator Greg Mattison, receivers coach Urban Meyer and director of football operations Bob Chmiel.\n\n? Magazu coached the OL at Navy from 1987-89, with Mattison coaching the DL from ’87-’88 and Rogers coaching the RBs in ’87-’88 and the QBs in ’89.\n\n? Magazu earlier had spent the ’81 season as OT/TE coach at Western Michigan, with Mattison serving as defensive coordinator at WMU from ’81-’86.\n\n? Magazu (OL, 1992-94) also crossed paths with Meyer (WRs, 1990-95) at Colorado State and with Chmiel (defensive assistant) on the 1983 Michigan staff (Magazu was an OL grad assistant).\n\n? Second-year Irish offensive line coach Dave Borbely and BC offensive coordinator Dana Bible were on the same staffs at Stanford from ’95-’97 (Borbely as OL coach, Bible as offensive coordinator).\n\n? Bible also coached with first-year Irish assistant Jerry Rosburg (OLBs, special teams) at Cincinnati in 1994 (Bible was the offensive coordinator, Rosburg the LB coach).\n\nPROBABLE STARTERS\n\nThe Head Coach\n\nThird-year Irish head coach Bob Davie owns a 21-14 (.600) career record at Notre Dame, including a 19-6 mark in the last 25 regular-season games. Davie was one of 10 finalists for the 1998 Walter Camp Foundation/Street and Smith’s Coach of the Year Award. His 1997 squad beat No. 11 LSU and No. 22 West Virginia in ’97 to mark the first time a Notre Dame team beat ranked foes on consecutive weeks since November ’92 while the ’98 opening win over No. 5 and defending national champion Michigan gave him a 3-4 record vs. ranked opponents (now 4-5). The ’99 season marks Davie’s sixth year at Notre Dame overall, after serving as defensive coordinator and inside linebacker coach from 1994-96. He coached nine seasons at Texas A&M (’85-’93), two at Tulane (’83-’84), four at Pittsburgh (’77, ’80-’82) and two at Arizona (’78-’79), spending both years at Tulane as defensive coordinator and the last five at Texas A&M in that role.\n\nCOACHING IN THE CLUTCH\n\nKnute Rockne owns the best career winning pct. among Notre Dame coaches in games decided by seven or fewer points, at 21-1-5 (.870). Among Irish coaches with 14-plus such games, the other top winning percentages in tight games belong to Elmer Layden (22-7-3, .734), Frank Leahy (17-5-8, .700), Bob Davie (11-5, .688), Ara Parseghian (13-6-4/.652), Dan Devine (15-9-1/.620) and Lou Holtz (20-18-2/.525). Holtz’s first season saw the Irish go 1-5-0 in games decided by a TD or less.\n\nNotre Dame’s Probable Starting OFFENSE\n\nPos.

Senior DL Brad Williams owns the longest active streak for consecutive starts (25) on the current Irish football team, followed by senior C John Merandi (22).\n\n? The longest active Irish streaks for consecutive games played belong to senior FS Deke Cooper (45) and senior SE Bobby Brown (35). Junior FL Joey Getherall saw his streak of 23 consecutive games played end at Purdue, due to a shoulder injury suffered at Michigan.\n\n? Just five Irish players have started 25 or more games in their careers at Notre Dame: Williams (32), senior DE Lamont Bryant (29), Brown (26), senior CB Deveron Harper (29) and junior TE Jabari Holloway (27).\n\nNEW SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nTwo former Notre Dame walk-on players were elevated to scholarship status prior to the start of the 1999 season. Offensive guard Brendan O’Connor and outside linebacker Anthony Brannan are now scholarship players.\n\nOFFENSIVE SCOUTING REPORT\n\nQUARTERBACKS\n\nSenior Jarious Jackson (156 for 263 in ’99, .593 pct., 14 TDs, 11 INTs, 230.3 passing yards/gm) is back for his second year as the starting QB and serves as team captain. Jackson finished ’98 ranked 13th nationally in passing efficiency (13th in ’99, at 142.07). His highlights include 85 rushing yards on 12 carries vs. Kansas (38-yard TD), 18 completions for 302 yards at Michigan (20-yard TD on fourth-and-one) and a career-best 22 completions for 267 yards at Purdue (one TD). He added a 15-for-26, 245-yard game vs. MSU (TD, INT) before a huge all-around game vs. Oklahoma: 15 for 21 for 276 yards and 2 TDs, 15 rushes for 107 yards and a TD. He tied an Irish record with four TD passes vs. ASU (10 for 17, 223 yards) while rushing nine times for 93 (44-yard run, 48-yard TD). He engineered the big comeback vs. USC (19 of 30, 257 yards, TD, INT) before fueling the comeback drive vs. Navy (200 passing yards, 74 rushing yards, career-best 57-yard TD run). Jackson’s last outing produced a 22-for-38 game at Pittsburgh for a career-best 317 passing yards (most by an Irish QB since 1979). Jackson headed into the USC matchup with 1,313 passing yards during the previous five games-ranking second-best in the long history of all-star Irish signalcallers. Jackson also ran 15 times for 48 yards at Michigan, with a twisting 12-yard TD run, and had two TD runs at Purdue (15 yards, 1 yard). His ’99 rushing gains include 592 yards on 96 carries (6.2 per carry), prior to subtracting 175 yards lost on 27 sacks (which knocks his average down to 3.4). Jackson is averaging 59.2 rushing yards per game (not counting his sack yardage). See pp. 14-15 for detailed information on Jackson. Sophomore Arnaz Battle worked his way into the backup spot in ’98, before a late-season shoulder injury. Battle ran two series in the ’99 opener vs. Kansas (one in the second quarter), misfiring on three pass attempts while rushing twice for 75 yards (he capped the Irish scoring with a 74-yard TD run). He also ran a first-quarter series vs. MSU (0-for-1 passing, one rush for five yards) and a second-quarter series versus Oklahoma (one completion for six yards, one incompletion). Battle ran the last full series of the second and fourth quarters of the ASU game (no pass attempts, five rushes for a net of three yards) and ran the final series at Tennessee (4-of-6 passing, with two first-down throws and a series-ending INT, plus a 12-yard rush and two sacks).\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nSophomore Tony Fisher leads the Irish with 123 rushes for 606 yards (60.6 per game, 4.9 per rush). Fisher-who also has taken some snaps at FB in recent games-enjoyed a huge game vs. Kansas in his first start (13 for 111, TD runs of two and 46 yards) before adding 75 yards on 12 rushes at Michigan, plus two catches for 51 (he had a 40-yard run and 47-yard catch and run vs. UM). Fisher added a career-best 140 yards on 26 carries vs. Oklahoma (55-yard burst on the game’s first play) and made a huge 28-yard catch late in the USC game. Freshman JULIUS JONES (62 carries, 307 yards, 5.0 per rush) provides backup at tailback, with Jones rushing 10 times for a team-best 35 yards vs. USC (he also caught a 49-yard pass) before erupting for 146 yards on 19 carries vs. Navy (most yards by an Irish freshman since 1975) and adding 46 yards on 12 rushes at Tennessee. At fullback, senior Joey Goodspeed and sophomore Tom Lopienski have shared the starting spot. Goodspeed (who started vs. Navy and Tennessee) caught five balls for 25 yards at Purdue while rushing four times for 11 (he has 17 rushes in ’99, for 51 yards). Lopienski-who did not see action as a freshman-has 25 rushes for 76 yards in ’99 and has four starts in ’99 (including last week at Pitt).\n\nOFFENSIVE LINE\n\nThe offensive line faces major injury losses, with sophomore LT Jordan Black going down with a torn MCL in the Tennessee game, then junior RT John Teasdale and senior LG Jim Jones suffering arch injuries in the Pittsburgh game (neither will play vs. BC). The line had a solid opening game vs. Kansas (343 rushing yards-most by an Irish team since ’96) and helped the Irish amass 566 yards of total offense in the win over OU (most by an Irish team since ’96). Senior center John Merandi is the only full-time OL returner from the 1998 team. Next on the list in terms of experience is senior guard Mike Gandy, who moved into the starting lineup for the last three games of ’98. Junior OT KURT VOLLERS made his first career start at Pittsburgh, in place of Black (Vollers played 11-plus minutes of game time at Tenn.). A pair of sophomores-OT SEAN MAHAN (44:09 career playing time, 12:05 at Pitt) and OG Ryan Scarola (22:56, 3:51 at Pitt)-are slated to make their first career starts in the BC game. Merandi, Gandy, Jones, Teasdale and Black each started the first nine games in ’99. The top healthy reserves include senior guard Rob Mowl and freshman center JEFF FAINE.\n\nRECEIVING CORPS\n\nA balanced and deep group of receivers is led by returning starters in senior SE Bobby Brown (89 career receptions for 1,419 yards) and junior TE Jabari Holloway. Brown has 31 catches (tied for team lead) for a team-best 532 yards and a team-high five TDs in ’99. He had four catches for 49 yards at Purdue (seven-yard TD), three for 84 vs. ASU (42-yard catch-and-run for a TD) and three for 38 vs. USC. Brown also latched onto a pass in the flat and raced 31 yards for a TD vs. Navy before making the crucial first-down catch on fourth and 10 to set up the winning score. Brown’s last game produced 12 catches (one shy of the Irish record) for 208 yards and a 42-yard TD at Pitt. Brown (tied for team-best with 17.2 yards per catch) is backed up at split end by sophomore Javin Hunter, who saw limited playing time as a freshman but ranks fourth on the ’99 team with 13 grabs for 224 yards (tied for team-best with 17.2 per rec.), including three catches at both Michigan and Purdue, a 43-yard catch vs. Michigan State and three catches for 27 yards at Tennessee. Senior Jay Johnson adds depth at split end, with five catches for 79 yards in ’99, a 31-yard TD vs. ASU and the winning 16-yard grab vs. Navy. Junior flanker Joey Getherall is tied for the team lead with 31 catches, for 397 yards (three receiving TDs). He had a strong game at Michigan, where he suffered a shoulder injury that sidelined him for the Purdue and MSU games (he returned for a career-best day vs. Oklahoma). Getherall caught three passes at Michigan for 29 yards, scored on a four-yard reverse and returned two kickoffs for 62 yards. He had six grabs for 133 yards vs. OU (both then-career highs), including a 58-yard catch-and-run for a score (he had two catches vs. ASU, including a 25-yard TD). Getherall then made a career-best seven grabs (73 yards) vs. USC, added six for 61 at Tennessee (he also scored on a 11-yard end-around) and had three catches at Pitt (including a five-yard TD). Senior Raki Nelson amassed 18 catches for 332 yards during a four-game stretch before suffering an ACL injury in the OU game (he has missed the last five games but could return this week). Nelson has 21 catches for 346 yards (16.5 yards per catch, 69.2 yards per game), after latching onto five passes vs. both Michigan (91 yards) and Purdue (68) before equaling a career-high with six catches vs. MSU (for a career-best 117 yards), plus two for 46 vs. OU. Sophomore flanker David Givens, who played sparingly as a freshman, caught two balls for 34 yards at Michigan, one for 13 yards at Purdue, one for 16 yards vs. USC and two for 20 vs. Navy (six total for 83). Givens also threw a 21-yard TD pass to Brown in the Pitt game while also catching two balls, including a 27-yard TD. Holloway is the team’s top returning receiver from ’98 (15 catches, 262 yards, one TD) while senior TE Dan O’Leary has played in 25 career games, with two grabs for 24 yards in the KU game, two for 30 at Purdue, two for 28 vs. OU, a six-yard TD vs. ASU, a seven-yard TD vs. USC and two catches for a career-best 54 yards at Pitt (he has 10 total catches for 149 yards). Holloway latched onto three catches for 51 yards at Michigan, including the late go-ahead score. He also caught a 27-yard pass at Purdue, two passes for 21 yards vs. OU (including a memorable cross-field pass for a 15-yard TD), made an 11-yard catch vs. USC and caught two passes for 18 yards vs. Navy. Holloway has nine total catches for 128 yards and two TDs, with his biggest play coming when he recovered Jarious Jackson’s fumble in the end zone for the game-winning TD vs. USC\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS\n\nFreshman JOEY HILDBOLD has averaged 39.8 yards on 43 punts. Senior JIM SANSON opened ’99 with plenty of kicks vs. Kansas (one FG missed, one FG blocked, 6-of-7 on PATs). Sanson converted a 20-yard FG and 2-of-3 PATs at Purdue before hitting two FGs (33, 34) and one extra point vs. MSU. Sanson missed twice from short range vs. OU and once from close range vs. ASU, then replacing injured sophomore DAVID MILLER at Pitt (FGs from 36, 39, with a 45-yarder blocked). Sanson has made five of 11 FG tries in ’99, with his career stats including 27-of-46 on field goals (58.7 pct.)-including 25 of 35 from 40 yards or closer-and 105-of-120 on PATs (87.5 pct.). Miller-who missed the Pitt game with a hip flexer-assumed PK duties early in the ASU game, making 6-of-7 PATs (one blocked). Miller made both PATs vs. USC and was 2-of-3 on FGs (miss from 29, good from 37 and 33) before converting 3-of-3 PATs vs. Navy and seeing a 43-yard FG try blocked (he missed a 25-yarder at Tenn.). Junior JOEY GETHERALL averaged 25.8 yards on four kick returns (41-yarder at Michigan) and 9.8 yards on five punt returns in the first two games. While Getherall was sidelined for the Purdue and Michigan State games (shoulder injury at Michigan), the Irish turned to freshman JULIUS JONES on punts (12 returns in ’99, avg. of 9.1 yards with a long of 20) while kickoffs were handled by sophomore Terrance Howard (16 total, avg. of 21.5, long of 36, out for regular season due to hamstring injury at Tenn.) and Jones (16 for avg. of 22.4, long of 36). Senior walk-on JAMES CAPUTO is the holder for placekicks while sophomore GERALD MORGAN took over long-snapper duties on FGs and PATs from senior DAN O’LEARY (he handles punts), beginning with the Navy game.\n\nSINGLE-GAME BESTS\n\nCAREER BESTS – RUSHING YARDS\n\nArnaz Battle 75 yards vs. Kansas, ’99 Tony Fisher 140 vs. Oklahoma, ’99 Joey Goodspeed 109 vs. Arizona St., ’98 Jarious Jackson 107 vs. Oklahoma, ’99 Julius Jones 146 vs. Navy, ’99 Tom Lopienski 20 vs. USC, ’99\n\nCAREER BESTS – COMPLETIONS\n\nArnaz Battle 7 vs. USC, ’98 Jarious Jackson 22 vs. Purdue, Pitt. ’99\n\nCAREER BESTS – PASSING YARDS\n\nArnaz Battle 94 vs. USC, ’98 Jarious Jackson 317 vs. Pitt, ’99\n\nCAREER BESTS – RECEPTIONS\n\nBobby Brown 12 vs. Pitt, ’99 Joey Getherall 7 vs. USC, ’99 David Givens 2, vs. Michigan, Pitt. ’99 Joey Goodspeed 5 vs. Purdue, ’99 Jabari Holloway 4 vs. Purdue, ’98 Javin Hunter 3 vs. Mich./Purdue, ’99 Jay Johnson 2 vs. Tennessee, ’99 Tom Lopienski 2 vs. Michigan St., ’99 Raki Nelson 6 vs. BC, ’97, MSU ’99 Dan O’Leary 4 vs. Purdue, ’97\n\nCAREER BESTS – RECEIVING YARDS\n\nBobby Brown 208 vs. Pitt, ’99 Joey Getherall 133 vs. Oklahoma, ’99 David Givens 34 vs. Michigan, ’99 Joey Goodspeed 25 vs. Purdue, ’99 Jabari Holloway 94 vs. Purdue, ’98 Javin Hunter 84 vs. Michigan St., ’99 Julius Jones 49 vs. USC, ’99 Raki Nelson 117 vs. Michigan St., ’99 Dan O’Leary 54 vs. Pitt, ’99\n\nCAREER BESTS – TACKLES\n\nRocky Boiman 7 vs. Michigan, ’99 Lamont Bryant 9 vs. Ga.

The Irish defense forced four turnovers in the Kansas game, extending one of the ’98 team’s high points (the Irish also were guilty of four turnovers vs. KU). In ’98, Notre Dame tied for 21st in the nation with a +0.64 regular-season turnover ratio. Just 11 Div. I-A squads had fewer turnovers than the 18 by the Irish in ’98 (the Irish also had just 13 in ’97). The Irish have turned it over 25 times so far in ’99 while forcing 24 (-1).\n\n? The ND offense posted low turnover averages in ’97 (1.18/gm, 13 total) and ’98 (1.63, 18) but is averaging 2.50 turnovers during the first 10 games of ’99 (25 total, none in back-to-back games vs. OU and ASU-the first time that has happened for the Irish since 1993).\n\n? The Irish finished the 1998 season with a +7 overall turnover ratio but are -1 so far in 1999 (the Irish defense has forced 13 fumbles and 11 interceptions while the Irish offense has 13 fumbles and 12 interceptions).\n\nDEFENSIVE SCOUTING REPORT\n\nDEFENSIVE LINE\n\nJunior Grant Irons (34 tackles, four sacks, forced fumble, fumble recovery) has moved to DE, after spending his first two years as a LB (he had his best game of ’99 at Tennessee, with six tackles and a sack). Senior Lamont Bryant (42 tackles, four sacks) is at the other end spot. Bryant had two sacks at Michigan, seven tackles at Purdue and six vs. MSU before totaling seven tackles and a sack at Pitt. The starting tackles are senior Brad Williams (21 total tackles in ’99, six tackles and a sack vs. MSU, forced fumble vs. Navy) and senior DT Lance Legree, who missed the Kansas and Michigan games with a strained right knee but has returned to play a key role, with 14 total tackles in ’99, including six vs. Navy and a starting assignment at Tennessee and Pittsburgh. Sophomore DT/DE ANTHONY WEAVER started at DT for seven games, after missing the Kansas game due to a knee injury. Weaver made four tackles (one for loss) at Michigan, four vs. USC, five vs. Navy and four at Tennessee (he has 18 total). Sophomore Ryan Roberts (sack vs. KU, five total tackles) provides backup at DE while senior Antwon Jones (started ’99 opener vs. Kansas, five total tackles) and junior Andy WisNe (10 tackles, one sack in ’99) provide depth inside.\n\nLINEBACKERS\n\nThe most experienced returner is junior Anthony Denman, who starts inside (weakside). Denman (second on team with 70 tackles, seven for loss) had seven tackles and scooped up a fumble for a 31-yard TD vs. KU, shared the team lead with 10 tackles at Michigan and added nine tackles, a sack and a forced fumble vs. MSU. He led the team with eight tackles vs. ASU, seven vs. USC and a career-best 13 at Tenn. (he also recovered fumbles vs. USC and Navy and had an interception at Pitt). Senior Ronnie Nicks opened ’99 as the starter at the other inside spot (strong side) but missed most of the Michigan game and the Purdue, MSU and OU games with an ankle injury. Nicks also missed the Pitt game (quadricep) and has 18 total tackles (seven vs. KU). Senior JoeY Ferrer (20 tackles) has started the past four games at dropback LB, with a career-high five tackles vs. both USC and Navy (he had a sack in the ASU game). Sophomore Rocky Boiman started the first six games at OLB, making his presence felt with two fumble recoveries vs. KU. Boiman (30 total tackles in ’99, fumble recovery vs. Navy, sack at Pitt) had seven tackles at Michigan but was used mostly on special teams at Purdue (the Irish used five and six DBs for most of the game). Sophomores Carlos Pierre-Antoine (17 tackles in ’99) and Tyreo Harrison and senior Anthony Brannan provide depth inside. Harrison-who started two games in place of Nicks (including last week at Pitt)-had five tackles at Michigan, was second on the team with 10 vs. MSU (three for loss) and led the Irish with 11 at Pitt (he has 32 total tackles, plus a blocked FG at Tenn.).\n\nDEFENSIVE BACKFIELD\n\nSenior right CB DEVERON HARPER started the previous two years and is fifth on the ’99 team with 47 tackles. Harper returned an interception for 22 yards for a TD vs. KU and added INTs vs. ASU and Pitt. Sophomore CLIFFORD JEFFERSON (third on ’99 team with 65 tackles) made his debut at left CB vs. KU (seven tackles), adding nine at Michigan and 10 at Purdue (he also recovered a fumble vs. the Boilers). Sophomore SHANE WALTON, in his first year with the Irish football program after playing soccer last year, also is in the mix. Sophomore DONALD DYKES also sees action at corner along with freshman JASON BECKSTROM (he plays the nickel package as the extra corner). Senior DEKE COOPER (top returning tackler from ’98 with 78) is the starter at free safety, ranking fourth on the ’99 team with 58 tackles. Cooper had six tackles and caused a fumble vs. KU before making seven tackles at Michigan and seven at Purdue. His big game vs. ASU included seven tackles, two fumble recoveries and a 33-yard INT. He added an INT vs. USC, forced a fumble vs. Navy and had nine tackles at Tennessee. Fifth-year veteran A’JANI SANDERS (58 tackles, team-high three INTs in ’98) is back at strong safety, with a team-best 76 tackles in ’99 (nine for loss, plus three INTs). Sanders had seven tackles and a caused fumble vs. KU before sharing the team lead with 10 tackles at Michigan and a team-best 11 at Purdue (plus a 10-yard INT). He added a team-best 12 tackles vs. MSU, had a 28-yard INT return for a TD vs. ASU and made a team-best nine tackles vs. Navy. Freshman JEROME SAPP is the most healthy FS backup, with junior JUSTIN SMITH possibly making a return this week after knee surgery (he played on special teams at Pitt). Junior RON ISRAEL is the top SS backup, but missed the Pitt game with a fractured hand. Israel was a key part of the nickel/dime package at Purdue before suffering an ankle injury that sidelined him for the MSU game. Israel started vs. Purdue and OU, in a six-DB set, and had two key plays in the USC game (a 16-yard sack and a forced fumble on a blitz that led to an Irish TD).\n\nPRESEASON AND ’99 Honors\n\nWR Bobby Brown\n\n?

Notre Dame’s 566 yards of total offense vs. No. 23 Oklahoma were most by an Irish team since the 1996 squad amassed 648 yards against Rutgers. The 566 yards were the third-most by an Irish team since ’92 and 11th-most in the last 22 seasons-since a 680-yard day vs. Air Force in 1977.\n\n? Notre Dame’s 566-yard output represented the Irish program’s third-highest total versus a ranked team in the last 30-plus seasons (1969-99), behind: 650 yards of total offense versus No. 16 Washington in 1996 (397 rushing, 253 passing) and 576 vs. ninth-ranked Boston College in ’92 (340 rushing, 236 passing).\n\n? Notre Dame’s 566 total yards vs. OU included a balance between the rushing (284) and passing (282) yards.\n\n? Previous ND teams have totaled 280-plus rushing yards and 280-plus passing yards in the same game just once since 1986 and seven times since the end of the 1963 season (all vs. unranked teams).\n\nIRISH ALREADY ACCUSTOMED TO CLOSE FINISHES\n\nThe Irish finished 9-3 in ’98 based mainly on their ability to win the close games, with comeback and/or close wins over Michigan (36-20), Purdue (31-30), Army (20-17), Boston College (31-26) and LSU (39-36).\n\nIn 1999, the Irish lost their first three close games before winning the three straight and losing a 10-point game last week at Pitt:\n\n? Michigan – Notre Dame and Michigan traded dramatic TD drives in the final few minutes (the Wolverines surged ahead 26-22), with the Irish nearly scoring again before time expired at the Michigan 12-yard line.\n\n? Purdue – Purdue used a pair of late field goals to take a 28-23 lead but the Irish drove to the Boilermakers’ one-yard line … before again seeing time expire.\n\n? Michigan State -The game’s decisive play came with five minutes remaining, when Bill Burke found Gari Scott open in the left flat for a stunning 80-yard touchdown play and a 20-13 MSU lead (the Spartans won, 23-13).\n\n? Oklahoma – The Irish rallied from a 30-14 deficit with 10 minutes left in the third quarter, fashioning three straight TD drives en route to a 34-30 win.\n\n? USC – ND overcame a 24-3 third-quarter deficit to win 25-24, with Jabari Holloway recovering a Jarious Jackson fumble in the end zone on the winning drive.\n\n? Navy – The Irish drove in the closing minutes for a 28-24 win, with Bobby Brown narrowly converting a first down on fourth-and-10 before Jarious Jackson completed a 16-yard, third-and-10 pass to Jay Johnson for the winning score.\n\n? Pittsburgh – Notre Dame trails 30-27 before Pitt clinches the game with a 10-play, 44-yard touchdown drive with 1:41 left to play.\n\nLIVING ON THE EDGE\n\n? Over the past three seasons, Notre Dame is 11-5 in games decided by a touchdown or less, with losses to No. 6 Michigan (21-14) and USC (20-17) in 1997, vs. Georgia Tech in the 1998 Gator Bowl (35-28), and in 1999 at seventh-ranked Michigan (26-22) and 20th-ranked Purdue (28-23).\n\n? The Irish posted close wins over Georgia Tech (17-13), Navy (21-17), No. 22 West Virginia (21-14) and Hawaii (23-22) in the ’97 season before beating Purdue (31-30) and Army (20-17) on late field goals in ’98, turning in a goalline stand to hold off Boston College (31-26) and rallying to beat LSU (39-36). The Irish have added close wins in 1999 vs. Oklahoma (34-30), USC (25-24) and Navy (28-24).\n\n? Included in the above 16 games is an 10-3 mark in games decided by 1-5 points.\n\n? Notre Dame won seven straight close games (1-7 points)-from Nov. 1, 1997, to Nov. 21, 1998-before losing its next three close games (vs. Georgia Tech, Michigan and Purdue), followed by wins over Oklahoma, USC and Navy.\n\n? 10 of Notre Dame’s last 13 games have been decided by 10 points or less: 39-36 win over LSU in ’98, 10-0 loss at USC, 35-28 Gator Bowl loss to Georgia Tech, all three ’99 losses (26-22 at Michigan, 28-23 at Purdue, 23-13 vs. MSU), ’99 wins over Oklahoma (34-30), USC (25-24) and Navy (28-24) and the 37-27 loss at Pitt.\n\nJARIOUS JACKSON NOTES\n\nJACKSON ON VERGE OF SEVERAL IRISH RECORDS\n\nSenior QB Jarious Jackson could set several Notre Dame records during the final two regular-season games of the 1999 season:\n\n? He needs 36 passing attempts and 27 completions to break the single-season records set by Ron Powlus in 1997 (298 and 182).\n\n? He needs 127 passing yards to surpass the long-standing season record total of 2,429, set by Joe Theismann over 10 games in 1970.\n\n? His 14 TD passes are five shy of tying the Irish record, set by Powlus in 1994 (Rick Mirer is the only other Irish QB to throw more than 16 in a season, with 18 in 1991).\n\n? On a per-game basis, Jackson also is in the running to set records for pass attempts/gm (26.3, record is 28.1), completions/gm (15.6, 16.6), passing yards/gm (230.3, 242.9), passing yards per attempt (8.8, 10.1) and passing yards per completion (14.8, 18.1).\n\nEFFICIENT AND PROFICIENT\n\nJarious Jackson is one of nine players in the nation who rank among the top 16 for both passing efficiency (13th, 142.1) and total offense (16th, 272.00). The others include Georgia Tech’s Joe Hamilton (1st, 3rd), Marshall’s Chad Pennington (2nd, 6th), Louisiana Tech’s Tim Rattay (4th, 1st), Florida State’s Chris Weinke (7th, 15th), Western Michigan’s Tim Lester (8th, 10th), BYU’s Kevin Freterik (9th, 7th), Louisville’s Chris Redman (4th, 11th) and Colorado’s Mike Moschetti (15th, 13th).\n\nUNCHARTED WATERS\n\n? Prior to the Oct. 9th ASU game, Jarious Jackson had passed for 240-plus yards in each of four straight games, becoming the first player to accomplish that feat in the storied history of Notre Dame quarterbacks. He had a career-best 302 passing yards as Michigan, followed by 267 at Purdue, 245 vs. Michigan State and 276 vs. Oklahoma.\n\n? Jackson’s combined passing total of 1,090 yards in those games ranks as the second-best stretch over four games in Irish history, trailing only Joe Theismann’s 1,231 in 1970 (284 vs. Pittsburgh, 272 vs. Georgia Tech, 149 vs. LSU and an Irish record 526 vs. USC).\n\n? Theismann followed up the USC game with 176 yards vs. Texas in the Cotton Bowl, for a record five-game total of 1,407 (Jackson’s 223 vs. ASU gave him 1,313).\n\n? Other top four-game passing totals at Notre Dame: 1,009 by Rusty Lisch in ’79 (160 vs. Georgia Tech, 227 vs. Air Force, 286 vs. USC, 336 vs. South Carolina), 995 by John Huarte during his 1964 Heisman Trophy-winning season (209 vs. UCLA, 300 vs. Stanford, 274 vs. Navy, 212 vs. Pittsburgh), and 947 by Steve Beuerlein in ’86 (119 vs. Air Force, 248 vs. Navy, 269 vs. SMU, 311 vs. Penn State).\n\n? Jackson’s passing streak included three opponents that were ranked in the AP poll at game time, plus an MSU team that was ranked the next week. The other four players listed above faced just three ranked opponents combined in their four-game passing streaks: Theismann (LSU), Lisch (USC), Huarte (none) and Beuerlein (Penn State).\n\n? Jackson’s combined passing yards over a two (569) and three-game (814) stretch ranked third at ND since 1970, behind Lisch (622, 848) and Beuerlein (580, 828).\n\nJACKSON POSTS FIFTH 300-YARD PASSING GAME AT ND SINCE 1970\n\n? Jarious Jackson’s 302 passing yards (18-for-29, TD, INT) at seventh-ranked Michigan and 317 last week at Pitt (22-for-38, 2 TDs, INT) represent just the fifth and sixth games with 300-plus passing yards by an Irish quarterback in 29 seasons (and first since ’91)-dating back to the USC game on Nov. 28, 1970, when Joe Theismann threw for an Irish record 526 yards (33 of 58) versus the unranked Trojans.\n\n? The only other Irish QBs to throw for 300-plus yards since 1970 are: Rusty Lisch (336 vs. South Carolina in ’79, 24 of 43, TD, INT), Joe Montana (358 at No. 3 USC in ’78, 20 of 41, TD), Steve Beuerlein (311 vs. No. 3 Penn State in ’86, 11 of 20, TD), and Rick Mirer (303 yards vs. Navy in ’91, 17 of 27, 3 TDs, INT).\n\n? Career-best passing games for other noteworthy Irish QBs since 1970 include: Tom Clements (287 vs. Purdue in ’72) and Ron Powlus (293 at Purdue in ’97).\n\nJACKSON YEAR-BY-YEAR\n\nComp-Att. (Pct.)

Jarious Jackson ignited the win over Kansas with a 38-yard touchdown run, then the longest TD run of his career and second-longest run overall (he had a 43-yarder versus Baylor in ’98).\n\n? Jackson scampered for the two longest runs of his career vs. ASU, burning the Sun Devils defense for 44 yards on one play before scoring on a 48-yard option keeper later in the game (he then pushed his career-best run mark to 57 yards with a long TD run vs. Navy).\n\nCAPTAIN SOLO\n\nSenior quarterback Jarious Jackson (Tupelo, Miss.) was elected captain of the 1999 Notre Dame football team, the third time in 32 seasons that Notre Dame has featured a single football captain (joining Mike Kovaleski ’86 and Rodney Culver ’91).\n\nAN EFFICIENT SEASON\n\nDue in part to a solid TD-to-INT ratio (13/6), Notre Dame senior Jarious Jackson was 9-2 as a starter in 1998 and ranked 13th in the nation with a 149.50 passing efficiency rating. That QB rating ranks second among Irish QBs in the ’90s (behind Kevin McDougal’s 151.29 in ’93) and marked the eighth time in the last nine seasons that an Irish QB has finished in the NCAA top 20.\n\nFIRST-START MAGIC\n\nJackson became the ninth straight Notre Dame QB to see the Irish win in his first start, after leading Notre Dame in ’98 to the 36-20 win over then-No. 5 Michigan.\n\nHITTING THE CENTURY MARK\n\nJackson’s 100 rushing yards vs. Stanford in ’98 represented the most yards on the ground by an Irish QB since Tony Rice ran 26 times for 141 yards and two TDs, vs. Penn State on Nov. 18, 1989 … Jackson also had three rushing TDs in the ’98 Stanford game-most by an Irish QB in 32 seasons, since Paul Hornung ran for three TDs (and kicked the PATs) in a 21-14 win over North Carolina on Nov. 17, 1956.\n\nJACKSON IN THE NOTRE DAME RECORD BOOK\n\n? Jarious Jackson continues to make his mark in the Irish season record book, with his ’99 passing yards per game (230.3) ranking second (behind Joe Theismann’s 242.9 in 1970) while his .593 completion pct. is close to Kevin McDougal’s record (.616, 1993).\n\n? His 147.3 career passing efficiency rating ranks second in Irish history (behind McDougal’s 154.4) while his .576 career completion percentage also ranks second and is first among passers with more than 200 attempts.\n\n? His low interception total (6) in ’98 produced an “interception avoidance” ratio of 0.0319 INTs per attempt, ranking among the top eight in Irish single-season history.\n\n? Jackson’s career interception ratio of .0373 is fourth all-time at Notre Dame while his 9.05 yards/att. and 15.7 yards/completion both rank third in Irish history.\n\n? Jackson’s 188 passing and 113 rushing attempts in ’98 produced 301 total offense attempts, ninth-most in Irish history. He has 386 total plays in ’99 (263 pass, 123 rush), good for second all-time behind Theismann (391 in 1970). Jackson is on pace for 463 total offense attempts, which would shatter Theismann’s record (Theismann averaged 39.1 plays over 10 games in 1970 while Jackson is averaging 38.6 in 1999).\n\n? Jackson has eight games with 200-plus yards of total offense in ’99, tying the record set by Theismann in 1970 (Jackson had six games with 200-plus total yards in ’98).\n\n? Jackson’s 2,181 yards of total offense in ’98 (1,740 passing, 441 rushing) ranks fourth all-time at Notre Dame, behind Theismann (2,813 in 1970), Rick Mirer (2,423 in 1991) and Steve Beuerlein (2,246 in 1986). He already has 2,720 total offense yards in 1999 (just 93 behind Theisemann’s record) and is on pace for 3,264.\n\n? During the past two seasons, Notre Dame is 8-0 when Jarious Jackson has rushed for 60-plus yards, 7-2 when he has totaled more than 260 yards of total offense and 4-0 when he has completed 63-plus percent of his passes.\n\nJACKSON’S TOP SINGLE-GAME EFFORTS\n\n(italics – ND loss, rankings based on AP poll at time of game, min. 14 carries for avg. list)\n\nPASSING YARDS\n\nOpponent (Date), Comp.-Att.-TD-Int.

Notre Dame was No. 1 when the college football teams in the Sept. 1 wire service rankings were reranked by graduation rate, and the overall graduation rate of the University’s athlete’s third among the nation’s Division I-A colleges and universities, according to the latest annual report compiled by the NCAA.\n\n? The report covers students who enrolled between 1989 and 1992 at 312 Division I institutions, including 112 in Division I-A. The NCAA bases graduation rates on the raw percentage of student-athletes who entered an institution and graduated within six years. Students who leave or transfer, regardless of academic standing, are considered nongraduates.\n\n? Using the NCAA formula, Notre Dame graduated a four-year average of 88 percent of its student-athletes, third only to Duke and Northwestern at 91 and 90 percent, respectively. The national average for Division I-A schools is 58 percent. (Among student-athletes who complete all four years of athletic eligibility at Notre Dame, i.e., not considering those who leave or transfer, 99 percent earn their degree).\n\n? Notre Dame graduated 85 pct. of all men competing in varsity athletics, fourth behind Duke, Northwestern and Stanford Universities. Among women, Notre Dame’s 94-percent graduation rate is bettered only by Northwestern and Boston College, both at 96 pct..\n\n? Fighting Irish football players graduated at a 78-percent rate, seventh overall but tied for first with Penn State among the top 25 programs in the Sept. 1 polls.\n\n? Among BIG EAST institutions, the 83-percent graduation rate of the Notre Dame men’s basketball is second only to St. John’s University at 92 percent.\n\n? Notre Dame graduated 78 percent of its African-American student-athletes, ranking behind only Duke, Vanderbilt, Northwestern and Stanford.\n\nNOTRE DAME RANKS THIRD ON SPORTING NEWS “REPORT CARD”\n\n? The Notre Dame athletic program ranks third in the nation among 112 NCAA Division I programs, according to a survey by The Sporting News (Sept. 13) in which schools were graded according to standards ranging from on-field to academic performance.\n\n? Notre Dame received two A’s, an A- and a B for a 3.67 GPA. The Irish finished behind only Penn State (3.92) and North Carolina (3.75). Rounding out the top 10 behind Notre Dame were Stanford, Florida, Duke, Purdue, Virginia, Nebraska and Michigan State.\n\n? Schools were rated based on grades in four areas: “Do We Play Fair?” (Notre Dame received an A) – number of teams sponsored, their success rates, graduation rates for all sports and Title IX compliance, “Do We Graduate?” (A) – graduation rates for classes entering from 1989-92, based on the most recent statistics published by the NCAA, “Do We Rock?” ( A-) – fan support, attendance, merchandise sold, size of athletic budget, number of teams and points awarded in Sears Directors’ Cup competition, “Do We Win?” (B) – wins, regular-season conference championships, conference tournament championships, rank in The Sporting News polls and performance in NCAA tournaments.\n\n“Play Fair” “Graduate” “Rock” “Win” Total 1. Penn State A A A A- 3.92 2. North Carolina B+ A- A A 3.75 3. Notre Dame A A A- B 3.67 4. Stanford A A B B+ 3.58 5. Florida B- A- A- A 3.50\n\nTicket Details\n\n? All seven ’99 Notre Dame home football games are sold out. That’s no surprise, considering 149 straight games at Notre Dame Stadium?and 197 of the last 198 back to ’64?have been sellouts (including all seven 1999 games).\n\n? The 1997-99 seasons have produced nine of the 10 highest number of ticket requests in Notre Dame history, thanks to the availability of nearly twice as many tickets through the alumni lottery (33,779 in ’98, 16,000 prior to ’97). The 1999 home game with USC attracted 46,658 requests from alumni, ranking fourth all-time (see chart at left). Contributing alumni are graduates who have contributed at least $100 to the University within the last calendar year.\n\n? Ticket requests for ’97-the first year of the expanded Notre Dame Stadium-increased by 90,000 for six games, compared to the highest previous figure. Thousands more contributing alumni received tickets in ’97 and ’98 compared to any previous year. Additional tickets were made available to parents of current students, and an alumni family game was designated, providing alumni the chance to order more than the customary two tickets. All University staff also now have the opportunity to obtain tickets.\n\n? The increase of nearly 21,000 seats provided 16,000 more to the lottery, 3,000 to faculty and staff and 2,000 to University allotments, including trustees, advisory councils, alumni board, alumni clubs, and major benefactors."
