        "text": "In 1969, Sports Illustrated put Hank Aaron on its cover for the first time. The Atlanta Braves were challenging for the pennant and “Hammerin’ Hank” was closing in one of the most revered marks in baseball. No, not Babe Ruth’s record of 714 home runs, but 3,000 hits.\n\nThe author wrote that Aaron, in part because he’d played in small markets (Milwaukee then Atlanta), and because of his quiet demeanor, had failed to achieve the level of stardom accorded to lesser players. However, this wrong was being righted as Aaron chased down hit 3,000.\n\nMickey Mantle was quoted calling Aaron the “most underrated great hitter of all time.” The story noted that, yes, Aaron would almost surely reach 3,000, but Ruth’s home run mark? “Since he is now 35, it is doubtful that Aaron will stay around long enough to hit the 176 homers he needs to pass Ruth,” the author wrote.\n\nHenry Louis “Hank” Aaron was born in 1934 in the area of Mobile known as, “Down the Bay,” one of eight children of Herbert and Estella Aaron. One of his siblings, younger brother Tommie, joined him in the majors with two stints with the Braves.\n\nWhen Hank was a boy, the Aarons moved to Toulminville in a home his father built with scrap wood and whatever other supplies he could find. Aaron picked cotton as a child, and credited the labor with giving him the powerful hands that helped make him one of the most feared hitters in history.\n\n“I tell a lot of people I was a vegetarian before they knew what a vegetarian was,” Aaron told a reporter on the occasion of his 80th birthday. “We didn’t eat meat but once every two or three weeks.”\n\nAaron, batting cross-handed, was a terror on the playgrounds. As a young teen, he played with semi-pro black teams, including the Mobile Black Bears. Local scout Ed Scott saw great promise in young Henry, and in 1951, signed him with the Negro League Indianapolis Clowns.\n\nIn 1952, the Boston Braves purchased Aaron’s playing rights from the Clowns. Aaron destroyed minor league pitching for two years and in 1954 the Braves—by then in Milwaukee—called him up. There was no learning curve for Hank Aaron. In his second year, he was chosen for the first of 21 consecutive All-Star games.\n\nBecause of the Braves’ lackluster record in the last half of Aaron’s career, it’s easy to forget that “Hammerin’ Hank” enjoyed winning seasons his first 13 years in the league. From a personal and team standpoint, Aaron’s greatest season was probably 1957. He led the National League in home runs (44) and RBIs (132), hit .322, and was named the National League MVP.\n\nAaron was carried off the field after rocking an 11th inning homer late that season to clinch the Braves first league title since 1914. In the World Series, he batted .393 as the Braves beat the New York Yankees in seven games. The Braves made it back to the series the next year, but lost to the Yankees.\n\nIn 1959, the player so associated with hitting for power led the league with a stratospheric .355 batting average.\n\nIn 1966, the Braves moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta. The team’s performance was lackluster, despite Aaron’s consistently Herculean output.\n\nIn 1973, the home run chase began in earnest. Aaron, at 39, hit 40 homers that year, but finished the season one shy of Ruth’s mark. The chase, which had become a national obsession, would have to wait until the next season. Sports Illustrated reported that Aaron received almost a million letters in 1973. While some of it was hate mail, bigots angry that a black man would break Ruth’s record, most came from fans rooting for the quiet, dignified Aaron.\n\nOn opening day of the 1974 season, he tied the record with a blast against the Reds in Cincinnati. From that point on, every Aaron at-bat was a national event.\n\nFour days later—against the Dodgers, and in Atlanta—Aaron connected on his historic shot. Two fans ran onto the field chasing the loping Aaron from second to third base. At home plate, his teammates hoisted the home run champ. His mother Estella raced onto the field and gave him a hard, long hug as Atlanta, and the nation, exulted. It was one of the most spine-tingling moments in the history of sports.\n\nIn 1975, Aaron returned to Milwaukee when the Braves traded him to the Brewers. He would hit his final 21 home runs—734 to 755—in the American League, his final dinger coming in 1976.\n\nNo player in baseball history has put up greater overall hitting numbers than Hank Aaron. Consider the following hitting categories, and Aaron’s rank in each:\n\nRBIs: First, with 2,297.\n\nExtra-base hits: First, with 1,477\n\nTotal bases: First, with 6,856\n\nHome Runs: Second, with 755\n\nHits: Fourth, with 3,771.\n\nRuns: Fourth, with 2,174\n\nWithin months of his retirement as a player, Aaron was back with the Braves. As the team’s director of player development, a position he held for years, Aaron was instrumental in turning the franchise from a cellar-dweller to a perennial playoff team.\n\nAaron was overwhelmingly voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, his first year of eligibility. In 1997, the City of Mobile built Hank Aaron Stadium, the home for the minor league Mobile Bay Bears.\n\nIn 2007, Barry Bonds broke Aaron’s record. However, Bonds’ use of steroids during his career mars his record and many still consider Aaron the true holder of the career home run mark.\n\nIn 2010, the Bay Bears moved Aaron’s childhood home to the stadium facility and opened the Hank Aaron Childhood Home & Museum. Joining Aaron for the grand opening were his old friend, Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, and Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Bob Feller, Rickey Henderson, Bruce Sutter, Reggie Jackson and Ozzie Smith.\n\nIt seems impossible that’s it’s been more than 40 years since Aaron broke Ruth’s record. In 2014, the Braves honored “Hammerin’ Hank” by wearing a patch on their uniforms commemorating the record-breaking blast by Mobile’s most famous citizen.\n\nHailing from Magnolia, Alabama, Tommie Agee played football and baseball at Mobile County Training school with future teammate Cleon Jones. After one season playing baseball at Grambling State University in which he batted a .533, he signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1961. He played in Iowa’s farm leagues for the better part of two seasons before making his major league debut for the Indians in the fall of 1962. In 1965, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox but spent the first season playing for AAA Indianapolis. In 1966, Chicago called him up as a starting center fielder, and he proved his worth by batting .273 in 160 games with 22 home runs, 88 RBIs, and scored 98 runs. He successfully stole 26 bases that season, and was named the American League Rookie of the Year, earned a Gold Glove and was named to the All-Star team in 1966 and again in 1967.\n\nIn 1968, Agee went to play for the New York Mets joining his childhood friend Cleon Jones. After a slow start that season, Agee came back for redemption in 1969, hitting the legendary home run into Shea Stadium’s upper decks and eventually leading the underdog Mets to the World Series that year. The “Miracle Mets” as they were known were not the favorites against the Baltimore Orioles that year, but Tommie Agee took charge of Game Three in what Sports Illustrated calls, “the most spectacular World Series game that any center fielder has ever enjoyed.” The Mets went on to win game three as well as the series, and Agee played for three more seasons with the Mets before being traded to the Houston Astros in 1972 and the St. Louis Cardinals in 1973. The Cardinals traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he was released in March 1974.\n\nTommie Agee’s last major league baseball appearance was September 30, 1073 at Busch Stadium playing for the Cardinals, even though his final baseball card depicts him as a Dodger. He finished his career one hit shy of 1,000 hits, with a batting average of .255, 130 home runs, 433 RBIs and 167 stolen bases.\n\nIn retirement, Agee was active in youth camps in New York and Mobile and he owned a bar called The Outfielder’s Lounge near Shea Stadium. In 1999 he appeared as himself with other Mets teammates in an episode of the TV show, Everybody Loves Raymond (season 3, episode 19, “Big Shots”). Tommie Agee died of a heart attack in 2001 at the age of 58 and is buried in Pine Crest Cemetery in Mobile, AL. He was posthumously inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nIn 1963, the University of Georgia lured Auburn basketball coach Joel Eaves to Athens, but with a new title: Athletic Director. Bulldog fans thought their new AD was off his rocker when he chose, for the biggest hire of all, a 31-year-old with zero head coaching experience.\n\nNo one was more surprised than Vince Dooley. In his book, “Dooley’s Dawgs,” he told how Eaves stunned him with a call and an amazing job offer. He asked Eaves to give him five minutes, to talk to his wife. When he called back, he said, “If you are crazy enough to stick your neck out, I’m crazy enough to come.”\n\nIt must stand as the finest decision in the history of University of Georgia athletics.\n\nIn 1964, Vince Dooley’s first season as Georgia’s head football coach, the “Dawgs” went 7-3-1 record, enjoyed their first winning season in years, and capped it with a victory in the Sun Bowl.\n\nDooley never looked back, and Georgia—its football program, its entire athletic program—has never been the same.\n\nVincent Joseph Dooley was born in Mobile in 1932, the second of three children. Though known to fans as Vince, to his family and friends he has always been Vincent. His wife, for example, never calls him Vince. The Dooley’s were not destitute, but money was always a concern. In his book, Dooley recalled his mother’s fear that the family would be evicted for getting behind on the rent and utility bills. But Vincent Dooley’s childhood was a happy one, and active.\n\n“The streets were where the action was but the action was sports, not crack or the criminal activity so pervasive now,” Dooley wrote. “There was a game of some kind going on all the time, and I loved to play the games. I loved to compete and enjoyed being involved in any kind of sports, even those that were invented.”\n\nThe Dooley boys, as Catholics, attended McGill Institute (now McGill-Toolen). In his favorite sport, basketball, Dooley set state tournament scoring records in 1949 and 1950. He played quarterback on the football team and was named Mobile’s prep “Athlete of the Year.”\n\nDooley arrived at Auburn at about the same time as its new football coach, Ralph “Shug” Jordan. In 1953, with Dooley as team captain and quarterback, the Tigers recorded their best season in 17 years, a 7-2-1 mark that included a berth in the Gator Bowl.\n\nUpon graduation, Dooley enlisted in the Marines. After a two-year hitch, he returned to Auburn to join Jordan’s staff. Back in those days, the head basketball coach was low on the totem pole, and did double duty as an assistant football coach. Eaves, the basketball coach, was assigned to scout opposing teams and recruits.\n\nDooley often accompanied him—a role that proved fortuitous when Eaves got the Georgia job.\n\nHere’s the Dooley record by the numbers:\n\nCoached 25 seasons, most in Georgia history.\n\nWon 201 games, and became only the ninth coach in NCAA history to win more than 200 games.\n\nWon six SEC titles, was named SEC coach of the year seven times, national coach of the year once, and led the Dawgs to 20 bowl games.\n\nFrom a fans’ standpoint, it didn’t hurt that Dooley made a habit of whipping Georgia’s two biggest rivals—Georgia Tech and Florida. His teams won 19 of 25 games against the Yellow Jackets and compiled a 17-7-1 record against the hated Gators.\n\nThe most memorable of those wins was the 1980 miracle comeback against Florida. Georgia trailed 21-20 with less than a minute to go, on its seven yard-line, facing a third and eight. Dooley’s hopes for an undefeated season and the national title were about to expire.\n\nThen quarterback Buck Belue, scrambling into and out of the end zone, spotted Lyndsay Scott at the 25. Scott made the grab, headed for the left sideline, and sped untouched for one of the wildest wins in Georgia history.\n\nDooley, known for his somewhat comic gyrations on the sideline, started racing down the sideline. “I outran him for about five yards, then he bolted into the clear,” Dooley was to recall.\n\n“How About Them Dawgs!” was the cheer heard around the world.\n\nGeorgia beat Notre Dame 17-10 in the Sugar Bowl to finish 12-0 and claim the undisputed national title, with Dooley being named National Coach of the Year. Herschel Walker, probably the greatest player in Georgia history, was the Sugar Bowl MP and, two years later, won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nDooley, who’d been given the dual role of coach and athletic director in 1979, retired from coaching in 1988 but continued on as athletic director. Under Dooley, Georgia athletics—including the likes of tennis and gymnastics—achieved new levels of success, and saw unprecedented growth in the quality and size of its facilities.\n\nVince’s son Derek has been head coach at Louisiana Tech and Tennessee. He’s now the wide receivers coach for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDooley has been inducted into the National College Football Hall of Fame, and the Georgia and Alabama sports halls of fame. In 2001 he was given the Amos Alonzo Stagg Lifetime Achievement Award by the American College Football Association. In 2000, Georgia Trend magazine named him one of the Top 100 Georgians of the Century.\n\nEd Dyas would be a in the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame with room to spare if he’d never kicked a field goal. He started at fullback and linebacker on some of Shug Jordan best Auburn Tiger teams, and was first team All-American at fullback in his senior year, 1960.\n\nBut in terms of the history of his sport, Dyas is remembered as one of the true pioneers of the field-goal. In the early days of football, field goals counted for five points, and touchdowns, just four. By 1912, the field goal was the three points it is today, and the touchdown, six points.\n\nOver the next 50 years, the field goal played a marginal role in the game. That began to change in 1959, when the NCAA widened the goal posts.\n\nEnter Auburn, and Ed Dyas. In 1960, his senior year, Dyas booted 13 of 17 field goal attempts, smashing the NCAA record. At Auburn he set four NCAA field goal records, including the career field goal mark of 17. Needless to say, he kicked straight on, as opposed to, “soccer style.”\n\nBack then, Sports Illustrated had a feature called, “Saturday’s Tough Ones,” in which the magazine issued brief summaries of that Saturday’s college games and picked a favorite. “Auburn over Georgia,” the magazine predicted, before that year’s renewal of Auburn’s second biggest rivalry. “The Tigers are menacing again, and there is always Ed Dyas to kick field goals. Georgia’s Francis Tarkenton will have to throw against one of the nation’s best pass defenses.”\n\nSI was right on. Auburn didn’t score a single touchdown, but defeated Georgia 9-6—all of the Tigers points coming off Dyas’s foot.\n\nThat year, famed Atlanta Constitution sportswriter Furman Bisher chronicled what he accurately saw as the dawn of the three-pointer as a game-changer in the sport.\n\n“The field goal, previously a wallflower, has been drafted and put to heavy labor, to the point that around one third of the decisions in the sturdy southern belt have been rendered by the instrument,” wrote Bisher. “None, however, have made it quite so important a feature of attack as Auburn University.”\n\nAuburn went 8-2 that year, with four of those wins coming on Dyas’ field goals.\n\nThat year Dyas finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting. He won the Cliff Hare Award, which is presented to the outstanding Auburn senior student-athlete, and the Bill Streit Award, which goes to the football player with the highest grade point average over four years.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, the Auburn pre-med was selected captain of the 1960 Scholastic All-America team.\n\nAfter graduating from Auburn, Dyas was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, and offered a $5,000 signing bonus and $10,000 a year. But he had another love, the good sense to pursue it.\n\n“In high school I got taken with the idea (to become a doctor) when I was introduced to biology we had good teachers at McGill,” Dyas said, of the Mobile high school now called McGill-Toolen. “And I made the decision to go to (med) school rather than play any more football, and I’m glad I did.”\n\nDyas chose Tulane Medical School over pro football. He finished in the top 10 percent class, returned home to Mobile, and helped build one of the largest orthopedic practices in the state.\n\nHe was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1999, and 10 years later, into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nDr. Ed Dyas died in 2011, at age 71, from stomach cancer.\n\nCliff Ellis grew up in Marianna, Florida, and began his career in music as lead singer for The Villagers. They were the hottest band in northwest Florida in the 1960s, and they recorded the hit “Laugh It Off” at the legendary FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He played with the likes of Roy Orbison and Etta James, and his band had a contract with Atco Records. But in 1968, he gave it all up to coach basketball.\n\nEllis began his coaching career in 1968 as an assistant at Ruckle Junior High in Niceville, Florida. After a season, he became an assistant basketball coach at Niceville High School and later head coach at Vanguard High School in Ocala, Florida.\n\nIn 1972, Cliff Ellis began his college coaching career at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee where he was head basketball coach and athletic director. In 1975, Ellis accepted the head coaching position for the University of South Alabama Jaguars and remains the school’s winningest coach with a record of 171-84 in nine seasons. He also led the Jaguars to three SunBelt titles, two NCAA tournament appearances and two NITs. Ten years after Ellis became head coach, South Alabama’s basketball team was ranked in the nation’s top ten teams.\n\nEllis was named head basketball coach at Clemson University in 1984 where he also stands as the winningest coach in the school’s history. Under his guidance, the Tigers won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in 1989-90 and made it to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA Tournament that year. Ellis was named ACC Coach of the Year in 1987 and 1990.\n\nIn 1994, Ellis became head coach at Auburn University, where, in 1999, he led the Tigers to an SEC championship and the most wins (29-4) ever recorded by a Division I team in the state of Alabama. Under Coach Ellis, Auburn made it to the NCAA Sweet Sixteen twice, and in 2002, Ellis achieved his 500th career Division I win against Georgia State, becoming one of only 34 coaches to reach that milestone.\n\nIn 2007, Cliff Ellis was named head basketball coach for the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers, and two years later led the team to two back to back Big South Conference championships. In the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 seasons, the Chants again took the Big South Conference title and made it to the second round in the NCAA Tournament both seasons.\n\nEllis was named Coach of the Year in 1999, and in addition to the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame, he is a member of the Cumberland Athletics Hall of Fame and the Clemson Athletics Hall of Fame. He has published three books: Zone Press Variations for Winning Basketball, The Complete Book of Fast Break Basketball and Cliff Ellis: The Winning Edge.\n\nThe year was 1969—at the very height of Willie McCovey’s career—and he was taking batting practice at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park.\n\nPitchers from the visiting team watched, in equal parts awe and fear. Among them: Jim Bouton, not much of a pitcher, but author of one of the greatest of all sports books, “Ball Four.” Here’s how Bouton described the scene in his book:\n\n“A group of terrorized pitchers stood around the batting cage watching Willie McCovey belt some tremendous line drives over the right-field fence. Every time a ball bounced into the seats we’d make little whimpering animal sounds. ‘Hey, Willie,’ I said. ‘Can you do that whenever you want to?’ He didn’t crack a smile. ‘Just about,’ he said, and he hit another one. More animal sounds.”\n\nNo less than Bob Gibson, as fearless a pitcher as there was, called McCovey “the scariest hitter in baseball.”\n\nMcCovey was nicknamed Stretch because of his arms, long even for his massive 6-4 frame. He batted left-handed, threw with his left, and only played one position—first base.\n\n“On ground balls hit down to the second baseman, there’s no need to throw, the second baseman just hands the ball to Willie.” wrote the great Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray.\n\nWillie Lee McCovey was born on January 10, 1938 in Mobile, the seventh of 10 children by his railroad laborer father Frank and mother Esther.\n\n“Kids in Mobile either hung around street corners and went into gangs, or they hung around street corners and went into sports. I was lucky. The kids who were my friends went into sports,” McCovey once told an interviewer.\n\nHe had the ill-fortune early in his career of playing behind Orlando Cepeda, the Giants’ All-Star first baseman.\n\nIn 1963, five years after his first major league game, McCovey was inserted into the starting line-up, for good. That year McCovey tied fellow Mobile native Hank Aaron for the league lead in homers, with 44, and drove in 102 runs.\n\nOne of McCovey’s hallmark moments came in 1969. In that year’s All-Star Game he walloped two gargantuan home runs and was named the game’s MVP. There’s a wonderful picture of McCovey, his face the picture of joy, being welcomed at the plate by Hank Aaron after one of the round-trippers. That season was also McCovey’s best. He led the league with 45 home runs and 126 RBI, hit .320, and was intentionally walked 45 times, at the time a major league record.\n\nCincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson frequently ordered his pitchers to walk McCovey. “If you pitch to him he’ll ruin baseball. He’d hit 80 home runs. There’s no comparison between McCovey and anybody else in the league.”\n\nMcCovey spent much of his career playing alongside his close friend Willie Mays, who was also from Alabama. “I don’t know what it was about him, but anywhere he went he felt he had to take somebody with him. And that somebody was usually me,” McCovey told an interviewer.\n\nStretch McCovey’s career was slowed, quite literally, by a seemingly endless series of leg and foot injuries. Though a part-timer late in his career, he played all or part of 22 seasons, finishing with 521 home runs. Had McCovey enjoyed better health, he might have joined Aaron’s chase of Babe Ruth’s record.\n\nMcCovey is still beloved in his adopted second home of San Francisco. In 2003, a statue of big number 44 was erected outside Candlestick Park and overlooking McCovey Cove—the unofficial name of a section of San Francisco Bay where some of McCovey’s homers were said to land with a splash.\n\nMcCovey was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked as the 56th greatest player of all time by The Sporting News.\n\nIn September 1971, after a hard-fought, one-run win over the Milwaukee Brewers, a policeman entered the Kansas City Royals locker-room, walked over to Amos Otis’ cubicle, and told the Royals’ centerfielder he was under arrest. “That was pure larceny out there tonight,” the policeman told Otis.\n\nOtis, whose sense of humor almost matched his abilities as a ballplayer, chuckled.\n\nYears later, and just prior to his induction into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame, Otis told a Mobile reporter that the Brewers’ game stood out more than any other memories in his 17-year, 2,000-plus hits career.\n\n“I stole five bases in one game, in ’71 against the Brewers. It was the first time in something like 50 years that had been done,” Otis recalled. “I will always remember that game. I was a pretty good reader of pitchers and their moves, including the two pitchers I faced that day.”\n\nAmos Joseph Otis was born in 1947, his home just eight blocks from the Aaron family. Hank Aaron, at the time slugging his way into history, was home visiting his family when Otis’s dad saw him. He tried to introduce young Amos to his hero. “I was too scared to say anything,” Otis recalled later.\n\nWilliamson High has produced many great athletes, but Otis holds the distinction of being the only Lion selected in the baseball draft. He was picked by the Boston Red Sox, but later traded to the New York Mets.\n\nOtis made his major league debut in 1967, but bounced back and forth from the majors and minors. In 1969—the year of the Miracle Mets and their historic World Series win—Otis struggled at the plate. Though he didn’t make the series roster, his teammates—including Mobilians Cleon Jones and Tommie Agee—voted him a share of series pay.\n\nThere’s a great picture of from that year of four Mobile big leaguers—Otis, Jones and Agee, all smiles and joined by Tommie Aaron, then with the Atlanta Braves.\n\nAt season’s end, the Mets traded Otis to the Royals. In Kansas City, he started from day one, and his career took off. Years later, Sports Illustrated ranked the Otis trade as the worst in Mets history, even worse than when the team traded Nolan Ryan.\n\nWith his blazing speed and strong arm, he was probably the best centerfielder in the game in the 1970s. He won three Golden Gloves, and was credited with popularizing the one-handed catch. Otis said it helped him get rid of the ball faster.\n\nIn August 1971, he made the cover of The Sporting News. The story ran under the headline: “Royals Otis En Route to Super Star Status.” That year—when he stole five bases in a game—Otis finished with a league-leading 52 steals.\n\nIn 1973, he finished third in the American League’s MVP voting, behind Reggie Jackson and Jim Palmer. Most importantly, the five-time All-Star played a huge role in delivering the Royals from baseball’s basement to a perennial challenger.\n\nOtis said his biggest regret was that the Royals won the AL West three straight years—1976, 1977 and 1978—but each year lost to the Yankees. In 1980, though, the Royals won the West again, and this time, whipped the hated Yanks.\n\nKansas City faced the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series, and Otis came to play. “I hit a home run my first time at bat in the World Series,” he said. “I felt what you call great. I ended up hitting three in the Series but that first was the icing on the cake.”\n\nIn addition to three homers, Otis hit .478, drove in seven runs, and in game three, set a series record for putouts by an outfielder with nine. But Otis’s heroics were not enough, as the Phillies prevailed in six games.\n\nOtis was released by the Royals in 1983. He played one year with the Pittsburgh Pirates before retiring, at 37.\n\nHis career numbers: 2,020 hits; a .277 career batting average; 193 career home runs; 992 RBI; and 341 stolen bases.\n\nUpon retirement, Otis served stints as a hitting coach for the San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies. Now, he’s living in Las Vegas, playing lots of golf, and is a regular at Royals reunions. “I am retired in every sense of the word,” he told a reporter several years ago. “I’m just enjoying myself these days. Life is good.”\n\nIn 1986, the Royals inducted Otis into its Hall of Fame. He’s also a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. There are five Mobile natives in the Baseball Hall of Fame: Satchel Paige, Hank Aaron, Willie McCovey, Ozzie Smith and Billy Williams. If there’s to be a sixth, it will be Otis.\n\n“The part I really miss about the game is the camaraderie, the laughing and joking around with the guys,” Otis said years after his retirement. “I don’t miss the pressure of trying to hit a 100 mph fastball.”\n\nThere’s a difference between fame and folklore. Think of Babe Ruth, and, across the color line, Leroy Robert “Satchel” Paige.\n\nImagine the duels Paige and Ruth would have had if not for the prohibition against blacks in the major leagues. Think of the high-kicking Paige, by many accounts the hardest thrower of the era, firing fastballs at the Sultan of Swat.\n\nIn Paige, Mobile can lay claim to a man whose charisma matched his pitching exploits. According to ESPN, Paige “threw more pitches for more fans in more places for more seasons than anyone else did. Black or white. Then or now.”\n\nThe famously lanky Paige is believed to have pitched 2,500 pro games, winning some 2,000. He named his pitches. Among them: the Midnight Rider, the Four-Day Creeper, and the Bee-Ball, so named because, like a bee, it hummed.\n\nIn the 1930s, Negro League all-stars began playing exhibitions against white Major League stars. Joe DiMaggio called Paige “the best I’ve ever faced, and the fastest.”\n\nIn 1934 and 1935, Paige pitched against Dizzy Dean six times, winning four. “My fastball looks like a change of pace alongside that pistol bullet old Satch shoots up to the plate,” Dean said. “If Satch and I were pitching on the same team, we’d clinch the pennant by the fourth of July and go fishing until World Series time.”\n\nPaige’s outsize personality, like Ruth’s, comes through in the old black and white photos. You see it in his eyes, his posture.\n\nHis, “Six Rules for a Happy Life,” is pure Americana, and great advice as well. They are:\n\nAvoid fried meats, which angry up the blood.\n\nIf your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts.\n\nKeep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move.\n\nGo very lightly on vices such as carrying on in society. The social ramble ain’t restful.\n\nAvoid running at all times.\n\nAnd, the last and most famous of Paige’s rules:\n\nDon’t look back, something may be gaining on you.\n\nHe was born Leroy Robert Page on July 7, 1906, in Mobile, the sixth of 12 children, his father a gardener, his mother a domestic worker. The family changed the spelling to Paige to distance itself from Paige’s abusive, law-breaking father. Young Leroy earned his nickname after fashioning a device to help him carry four suitcases at a time while working at the Mobile train station.\n\nHistory knows Paige as much for his looping gait, his easy-going personality and legendary storytelling as his pitching exploits. But as a boy, Paige found trouble easily, the last straw an arrest for shoplifting. In his early teens, he was sent to a detention home near Montgomery then called the Alabama Reform School for Juvenile Negro Law-Breakers. It was there that Satchel Paige learned to pitch.\n\nPaige’s first experience with organized baseball came in 1924, with the Mobile Tigers, a semi-pro black team. Paige would later recall that the Tigers paid him “$1 when the gate was good and a keg of lemonade when it wasn’t.”\n\nHe began his professional career in 1926, with the Chattanooga Black Lookouts of the Negro Southern League.\n\nHis talent and exploits were to make him the highest paid player in Negro League history.\n\nPaige was famously well-traveled, with stints in Cuba and Mexico. He pitched for, among others, the Baltimore Black Sox, the Chicago American Giants, the Nashville Elite Giants, the Cleveland Cubs, the Crawford Colored Giants, and the Birmingham Black Barons.\n\nIn 1948, the year after Jackie Robinson broke the color line, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League history when he signed with the Cleveland Indians. Almost 79,000 fans jammed Cleveland’s ballpark to watch Paige’s debut.\n\nHe was 42, and the oldest rookie in Major League history. Paige, who arrived midseason, went 6-1, with an ERA of 2.48, and helped the Indians get to and win the team’s first World Series in 28 years.\n\nPaige was the first black pitcher in the American League, and the first black pitcher to take the mound in a World Series game.\n\nIn 1969, Major League baseball did a wonderful favor for a player it had denied for most of his career. The Kansas City Athletics (soon after to become the Oakland A’s) brought Paige out of retirement, allowing him to become the oldest player to play in the majors. The 59-year-old Paige allowed one single over three scoreless innings against the Boston Red Sox.\n\nIn 1971, Paige became the first Negro League player inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1999, The Sporting News—known as the Bible of Baseball—put out its list of the top 100 players of all time. Paige was ranked 19th.\n\nSatchel Paige died in 1982 at his home in Kansas City, a month before his 76th birthday. Satchel Paige Elementary School in Kansas City is named in his honor.\n\nIn 2006, the baseball Hall of Fame unveiled a statue of Paige. His left leg pointed skyward, his right hand below his right knee, perfectly capturing the famous Paige wind-up. The inscription reads: “In honor of the Negro Leagues’ most celebrated pitcher and dedicated to all of those whose contributions to the national pastime were too long diminished simply because of the color of their skin.”\n\nThough many forget that Ozzie Smith was ever anything but a St. Louis Cardinal, he started out as a San Diego Padre.\n\nDuring warm-ups in his rookie year of 1978, Smith would entertain teammates with back flips. A Padres promotions director, desparate to generate fan excitement for the woeful Padres, asked the rookie shortstop if he’d do a flip before the team’s final home game.\n\nSmith initially balked. It seemed too flashy. But he ultimately agreed. His flip was a sensation, and for much of his career, he thrilled opening and closing day crowds with the high-flying routine.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Smith worrying about seeming the show off. As a fielder—by many accounts, the greatest fielding shortstop in baseball history—Ozzie Smith dazzled, not with mere consistency, but demonstrations of athleticism and creativity, stopping balls few shortstops could touch and following through with extraordinary throws to make outs.\n\nIn 1980, a sportswriter dubbed Smith the “Wizard of Oz,” later shortened, by fans and media, to, “The Wizard.”\n\n“I used defense as a hitter uses his bat,” Smith told an interviewer. “Most people look at momentum as strictly offensive. I looked at defense as also being momentum, how you could change the momentum of ballgame.”\n\nOsborne Earl “Ozzie” Smith was born in Mobile in 1954, the second of six children of Clovi and Marvella Smith. His father worked as a sandblaster at Brookley Air Force Base. When Ozzie was six, the Smiths moved to the Watts section of Los Angeles.\n\nSmith was small, but blessed with astonishing quickness and hand-eye coordination. He gravitated to baseball, played college ball, and was on a semi-pro team when the Padres drafted him.\n\nIn some ways, Smith’s most admirable accomplishments were those he produced at the plate. Whereas fielding seemed to come natural to him, hitting did not.\n\nIn 1979, Smith’s second year with the Padres, he bottomed out. He didn’t get a hit until his 33rd at-bat. He won what might be called the Reverse Triple Crown. Of players with the necessary at-bats to qualify for the real Triple Crown, Smith finished last in batting average (.211), home runs (0), and runs batted in (27).\n\nIn 1982, the Padres traded Smith to the Cardinals. What followed was a love affair between city and player that continues to this day.\n\nCardinals manager Whitey Herzog made a deal with Smith: He would pay Smith a dollar for every ground ball Smith hit—out or not—and Smith would pay Herzog a dollar for every ball hit in the air. Smith won almost $300 from Herzog that year, and more importantly, developed into an offensive as well as a defensive threat. No longer would they say of Smith that he was, “all field, no hit.”\n\nSmith finished his career with 2,460 hits and 580 stolen bases. His best year at the plate was 1987. Batting second, Smith hit .303, stole 43 bases, drove in 75 runs, scored 104, and won the Silver Slugger Award for the best hitting shortstop in the National League.\n\nDuring Smith’s years in St. Louis, the Cardinals reached the World Series three times, winning it once, in 1982, over the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nHe retired in 1996, after 18 years. He set major league records for career assists (8,375) and double plays (1,590) by a shortstop (the latter since broken). He holds the National League record for most games at shortstop (2,511), and the record for consecutive Golden Gloves at shortstop, with 13.\n\nHe played in 15 All-Star games, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2002.\n\nAfter retirement, Smith spent several years as a television and radio commentator. He later turned businessman, which included Ozzie’s, a restaurant and sports bar in St. Louis.\n\nOzzie Smith is one of those rare athletes. He was a human highlight reel. No one who followed sports during the 1980s and 1990s will ever forget him.\n\nThe NFL draft has become a true spectacle, preceded by months of sports stories, ESPN features and “mock drafts” endlessly speculating on which players will be drafted when and by whom.\n\nBut the first draft, in 1936, was barely a blip on the radar. Jay Berwanger, a Heisman Trophy halfback from the University of Chicago, was chosen first by the Philadelphia Eagles. Berwanger asked to be paid $1,000 a game. It was too rich a demand for those days, and he never played a down of pro football.\n\nAs a result, the second pick became the answer to the trivia question: Who was the first player chosen in the NFL draft to play in the NFL?\n\nAlabama quarterback, defensive back, “blocker,” kicker and punter Riley Smith was, of course, far more than merely the answer to a trivia question. History knows him as one of the greatest all-around players to ever suit up for the Crimson Tide, and a fine pro player, if only for a few years.\n\n“I signed because I wasn’t ready to quit playing ball,” Smith recalled years later. “I just wanted to keep playing. I signed for $250 a game and a little bonus.”\n\nRiley Henry Smith was born in Greenwood, Miss., and spent some of his childhood in an orphanage. He led Lee High to the Mississippi state championship, then left for Tuscaloosa and the University of Alabama.\n\nIn 1934, Smith, All-American receiver Don Hutson and another receiver by the name of Bear Bryant led the Tide to an undefeated season, a Rose Bowl win over Stanford, and the national championship.\n\nSmith and Bryant were the best of friends at Alabama and for the remainder of their lives.\n\nIn 1935, his senior season, Smith was named All-American and won the Jacobs Award, given to the best blocker in the Southeastern Conference. That a quarterback could win such an award says something about the evolution of the game since then.\n\nIn Smith’s first year in the NFL, the Redskins were still based in Boston. The new quarterback from Alabama led the team to its first ever winning season and an appearance in the NFL championship game.\n\nIn 1937, the team moved to Washington. The Redskins first game in nation’s capital home was a win, and it came on the back of the rugged Smith. Washington beat the New York Giants 13-3, with Smith accounting for every point. He returned an interception 60 yards for a touchdown, made the extra point, and booted two field goals.\n\n“With deft toes and hands and a streaky change of pace when that need arose, the comparatively unheralded Smith projected himself full into the spotlight of last night’s scene to win the game for Washington,” wrote Washington Post sportswriter Shirley Povich.\n\nBut he was no longer the team’s quarterback. The Redskins had drafted the great Sammy Baugh. That year, led by Baugh and Smith, Washington again made the NFL championship game and this time, won it, defeating Coach George Halas and the formidable Chicago Bears.\n\nAfter three years with the Redskins, a leg injury and the realization that the pay just wasn’t worth it led to Smith’s decision to retire and become football coach at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va. There he met his wife, Frances Boykin, daughter of legendary Alabama congressman Frank Boykin.\n\nHe was a Navy officer during World War II, and after the war, moved to Mobile. Smith had a highly successful real estate career and was a prominent figure in the city for the remainder of his life.\n\nHe could be forgiven for losing count of all the halls of fame into which he was inducted. They included the National Collegiate Football Hall of Fame, the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1988, Smith joined Hank Aaron as the first two inductees into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame. He died in 1999, at 88.\n\nThe NFL has seen better quarterbacks, and certainly ones with stronger arms, but for charisma and entertainment value, there is and will only ever be one Kenny Stabler. With his long silver mane, south Alabama twang and bad boy swagger, Stabler was the leader of the unforgettable renegade Oakland Raiders of the 1970s.\n\nPlaying for the equally colorful coach John Madden, Stabler and the Raiders were among the NFL’s dominant teams that decade. Stabler benefitted from an extraordinary trio of receivers in Fred Biletnikoff, Cliff Branch, and tight end Dave Casper.\n\nStabler was the AFC player of the year in 1974 and 1976. He and the Raiders drubbed the Minnesota Vikings in the 1977 Super Bowl.\n\nHe left an indelible mark on every fan lucky enough to have watched him create in the pocket, whether hurling long, flinging sideways, or, most memorable of all, pretending to fumble.\n\nStabler’s creativity in the face of situational desperation spawned one of the most famous plays in NFL history. The Raiders trailed the San Diego Chargers by six, with 10 seconds left in the game. Former Alabama star Woodrow Lowe had Stabler in his grasp at the 24-yard line. On his way down, Stabler gave the ball a sneaky underhanded wrist flick forward.\n\nRaiders running back Pete Banaszak and tight end Dave Casper took turns kicking and batting the ball into the end zone, where Casper fell on it, giving the Raiders a remarkable 21-20 win.\n\n“I fumbled it on purpose,” Stabler admitted after the game.\n\nFew NFL plays have been replayed more often than the, “Holy Roller,” as it was dubbed.\n\nIt led to a new rule: Any fumble in the final two minutes of either half or on fourth down can only be advanced—as in, picked up and run with—by the offensive player who fumbled the ball. It’s best known by its unofficial name: “The Ken Stabler Rule.”\n\nKenneth Michael Stabler was born on Christmas Day, 1945, in Foley. He grew up and attended high school in the small town by the Gulf.\n\nDuring Stabler’s three years as Foley High’s starting quarterback, the Lions went 29-1. In one of those wins, Stabler took off on a long, winding touchdown run. His coach dubbed him, “Snake,” and the name stuck.\n\nIn the winter, Stabler played basketball, averaging 29 points a game. In the spring, the left-handed ace baffled opposing batters. The New York Yankees and Houston Astros both offered Stabler minor league contracts. Instead, he chose to go to Alabama and play for the Bear.\n\nNot until 1966, his junior year, did Stabler get the starting job. That year the Snake led the Tide to an 11-0 record, capped by a 34-7 spanking of Nebraska in the Sugar Bowl. It’s been decades, but if you want to get a rise out of Alabama fans, bring up the final rankings for 1966. Notre Dame and Michigan State, who tied during their meeting that season, finished one and two. Alabama, despite its perfect season, was third.\n\nAlabama went 8-2-1 in Stabler’s senior year, but in the biggest game of every Alabama season, he delivered with his famous, “Run in the Mud.” The Tide trailed Auburn 3-0, with rain having turned Legion Field into a muddy mush. Stabler took off around right-end on a keeper, and out-raced the Auburn defense for a 53-yeard touchdown run and a 7-3 Tide win.\n\nIn his later years as a pro, Stabler, his knees wobbled by injuries, could barely run. The “Run in the Mud” is a reminder of just how swift he was in his younger days.\n\nIn 1980, the Raiders traded Stabler to the Houston Oilers. The Oilers, under Bum Phillips, made the playoffs that year, but lost to the Raiders. Stabler stayed in Houston for one more season, then was traded to New Orleans.\n\nThe 37-year-old quarterback, grey-bearded, and with a pair of bum knees, was unable to work his old magic on a Saints franchise that was bad before he arrived, while he was there, and for some time after he departed. He retired in the middle of the 1984 season after losing the starting job to Richard Todd, another former Tide star and Mobile Hall of Famer.\n\nStabler was almost as famous for his off-the-field partying exploits as his play. He liked to drink and, well, chase women. And he didn’t apologize for either.\n\n“To be perfectly honest, I’m not going to change, because I don’t know any other way. I’m going to live the way I want to live,” he told Sports Illustrated in 1979. “I’m not going to let football control my entire life. I play and I work as hard as I can, and in the off-season I do the things I like to do. That’s not going to change.”\n\nFollowing retirement, Stabler embarked on a second career—as color commentator. His distinctive Southern twang became familiar to NFL fans, during his time as a TV color commentator, and then as Eli Gold’s partner on the Alabama football radio network.\n\nFor many years, Stabler hosted a celebrity golf tournament in Baldwin County. Dozens of his friends from football and Hollywood descended on Lower Alabama to play golf, have fun, and raise money for Ronald McDonald House of Mobile.\n\nKenny Stabler died on July 8, 2015 from complications resulting from Stage 4 colon cancer.\n\nNo Alabama quarterback—not Joe Namath, Kenny Stabler, nor A.J. McCarron—can match Richard Todd’s astonishing success in games against members of America’s toughest conference.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975, the Todd-led Tide went undefeated against Southeastern Conference foes, and had an overall record of 33-3.\n\nThe tall, strapping Todd operated Alabama’s wishbone offense with efficiency and brio, whether handing off or pitching to the likes of Wilber Jackson or keeping it and rumbling through defenses for first downs and better.\n\nHe is also the answer to an all-Alabama trivia question: Can you name the Crimson Tide quarterback who replaced Joe Namath as the New York Jets quarterback and, years later, as a New Orleans Saint, replaced Kenny Stabler?\n\nRichard Todd was born in 1953, in Birmingham. His parents moved to Mobile when he was a boy. Hollywood handsome and nice to boot, Todd was the big man on campus that everybody liked. He starred in basketball, football and track, setting a state record in the shot put.\n\nTodd undoubtedly benefitted by playing for Glenn Yancey, one of the greatest high school coaches in Mobile history. Yancey—a 2006 inductee into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame—had helped develop another member of the Hall, quarterback Scott Hunter, when at Vigor.\n\nIn his senior season, Todd received one of the greatest honors available to a prep athlete—he was named to the Parade All-American team.\n\nTodd had some reservations about going to Alabama, because of its running-oriented, wishbone offense. But he wanted to play for Bear Bryant, and he wanted to win. And win he did. Alabama went 11-1 in each of Todd’s three seasons at the helm.\n\nTodd considered his final game against Tennessee—a 30-7 drubbing of the Vols in 1975—as his greatest college game. He ran for 90 yards and three touchdowns and passed for another.\n\n“I always told people I was just a glorified fullback, and in that game I had the chance to run the ball a lot, and I had some success,” Todd was to say later.\n\nNotre Dame edged the Tide in a pair of heartbreaking bowl games after the 1973 and 1974 seasons. In Todd’s final game at Alabama, the Tide beat Penn State in the Sugar Bowl to end a long bowl drought. Todd was named the game’s MVP.\n\nTodd did not generate big passing numbers operating Bear’s wishbone, and hoped to be drafted, at best, in the middle rounds. Lucky for Todd, he was from Mobile. He would say later that the Senior Bowl would not have chosen him were he not a hometown boy who’d played for Alabama.\n\nToo many players to count have seen their stock rise from good performances at the Senior Bowl, but few benefitted more than Todd. He threw for 332 yards, including an 82 yard touchdown pass.\n\nDespite his lack of big numbers at Alabama, the New York Jets chose Todd with the sixth pick of the 1976 draft. Remarkably, no Crimson Tide quarterback has been selected in the first round since. That’s 38 years and counting.\n\nThe Jets had dwelled in the NFL cellar pretty much since winning the 1969 Super Bowl, and remained there in Todd’s early years, when he was largely a back-up.\n\nIn a 1980 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Jets fell behind and Todd was directed to fire away. He did, setting an NFL record for completions in a game with 42. The mark stood for 14 years.\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, Todd guided the Jets to the playoffs. They lost in the wild-card round in 1981 but in 1982 beat the Bengals and the Raiders to advance within one game of the Super Bowl, but lost to the Miami Dolphins in the AFC championship game.\n\nHopes were high for Todd after the Jets made the playoffs two straight years. In August 1983, at the start of preseason, Sports Illustrated put Todd on the cover. “Still On The Hot Spot: Jets Quarterback Richard Todd Battles On Against the Namath Legend.”\n\nTodd never took the Jets to the Super Bowl or developed into top-tier pro quarterback. His lack of passing experience in college may probably contributed to that.\n\nNew York traded Todd to New Orleans in 1984. In mid-season, he unseated Stabler as the Saints starting quarterback. He stayed with the team for two years and retired in 1986, after 10 years in the league.\n\nTodd lives in Atlanta with his family, and is an investments professional at J.P. Morgan Securities. He’s also a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the first half of the 1900s, many of the means we now take for granted that allow an athlete to shine and climb the ladder didn’t exist. Imagine, if you can, being an extraordinarily fast teenage black girl in Wilcox County during the mid-1940s.\n\nYour likelihood of being discovered and making the United States Olympic team would be, what, one percent? Less?\n\nNot the Olympics and assuredly not a trip to London, England, was on the mind, even in the dreams, of little Mabel Walker. She and her friends at all-black Camden Academy just wanted their school to have a May Day, with activities and competitions.\n\n“There was a school in a little town called Pineapple, and they had a May Day, and they were an even smaller school than us, and we always wanted to go to their May Day,” she recalled recently, her mind going back some 70 years.\n\n“We asked one of our teachers, ‘Why can’t we have a May Day at Camden?’”\n\nThornton (her last name since her marriage in 1950), though born in Mobile County, was raised in Wilcox County by her grandparents. Her grandparents had to return to Mobile when she was a young teen. Mabel remained in Camden, as a boarding student.\n\nYou can still hear the gratitude in her voice when she talks about the teacher, Nora Francis Smith, who taught them physical education.\n\nSmith agreed that her students should also have a May Day. She explained that the events would include running track. “We didn’t know what that was,” Thornton said. “We asked her, ‘What is running track?’’\n\n“She put us on the football field and said, ‘Just run down the field,’ and she observed,” Mabel said, stressing that last word.\n\nWhat Smith observed was astonishing speed, especially from the short, pretty girl from Mobile. Smith was so impressed that she called the track coach at all-black Tuskegee Institute. She asked if her “team” could compete in the Tuskegee Relays, the oldest African American track meet, and a hotbed of black talent in those days.\n\nThe Tuskegee coach reluctantly allowed Smith to bring her young girls to the meet. “We had these black and orange uniforms—basketball uniforms—and we just ran over those people,” said Walker, laughing. “Many of the attendees were confused.They were told we were from Camden, and they asked, ‘Camden, New Jersey?’”\n\nThe Tuskegee coach asked Smith if Mabel and her cousin could run for his team. Smith thought the girls too young and declined. But the next year, she let them run for Tuskegee.\n\nBecause of World War II, there had been no Olympics in 1940 or 1944. The London games, then, were to be the first in 12 years.\n\nThe U.S. track trials were held in Providence, Rhode Island, itself quite a haul from rural southwest Alabama. Though she raced against other hopefuls, the team was selected on times. You could win your trial race, but if your time didn’t measure up, you didn’t make the team.\n\nWalker, just 18, turned in the fastest time in the 100 meters. She would go to London, and become the first athlete from this area to compete in the Olympics.\n\n“Wilcox County was in the country, and there was no TV. We had never seen anything like London,” she said.\n\nIn London, she ran the 100 meters and the first leg of the 4×100 meters relay.\n\n“It was amazing,” she said in an interview after being chosen for the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame. “The only thing I knew about the Olympics was what we had studied about the Greeks. It was awesome to me, growing up in Wilcox County, and in one year to get to this.\n\n“I didn’t understand how I got that great opportunity except my coach had great foresight. She kept saying, ‘You can do it.’”\n\n“I can still talk for days about it,” she said. “The fellowship you create and the friendships with people of all different cultures was amazing.”\n\nOnly two members of the U.S. women‘s track team medaled. Not Walker, but not for lack of trying. “I wish I had done better but I honestly gave it my all,” she said.\n\nAfter the Olympics she had a fine career running for Tuskegee’s track team. She returned to Mobile, and married in 1950. The Walkers had two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Walker earned a different sort of fame—for making thousands upon thousands of Mobilians happy by serving them ice cream.\n\nShe managed a staff of teenagers at the Widemire’s Old Dutch Ice Cream Shoppe on Old Shell Road, just west of McGregor Ave.\n\nNot until years later, upon her induction into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame, did her thousands of old customers know that Mabel, the sweet pretty woman at Old Dutch, had been a star.\n\nIn 1946, some shipyard workers read an unusual notice in the newspaper: A professional women’s baseball team was holding try-outs in Pascagoula.\n\nThe men thought of a scrappy 13-year old girl who seemed to live at the school field in her neighborhood in Prichard. She played with the boys there during the day, and when the workers from the shipyards and paper mill came to play in the later afternoon, joined them as well.\n\nThe workers went to see Delores “Dolly” Brumfield’s mother and offered to drive Dolly to the tryouts. Dolly’s mother wasn’t having that, but ceded to her daughter’s pleas to be given a shot.\n\n“She borrowed my grandmother’s car, and took me out of school one day and drove down to Pascagoula and I tried out,” said Dolly. “Max Carey, who was president of the league, said I was too young, but told me to come back the next year.”\n\nThat was little Dolly Brumfield’s introduction to the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was immortalized in the 1991 movie, “A League of Their Own,” starring Tom Hanks, Madonna and Rosie McDonnell.\n\nBrumfield’s story really begins in 1942. America—the world—was in the midst of unparalleled upheaval. Major League baseball was far and away the country’s most popular sport, but some 500 major leaguers exchanged their baseball uniforms for service uniforms.\n\nChicago Cubs owner Philip Wrigley, fearing for the cancellation of the 1943 season, hit upon an idea to maintain interest in the sport: Have women play! And darn if he didn’t do it.\n\nEvery team in the league was located in a four state area around Chicago. Gas was rationed during the war and post-war years so the teams had to be near enough to one another to limit long trips, Brumfield said.\n\nFast forward to 1947: Though the war was over and major league ball resumed, the women’s league remained popular. The year Brumfield was deemed too young, another Mobile girl, Margaret “Margie” Holgerson, had tried out and made the league, as a member of the Rockford Peaches.\n\nHolgerson was a pitcher and infielder. As a pitcher, she had a career record of 76-69 and an outstanding career ERA of 1.07. She was married in 1948 and played under her new name, Margie Silvestri, until her retirement from the league, in 1952. Silvestri died in Mobile, at 63.\n\nIn the spring of 1947, Holgerson met with Brumfield’s parents, and they agreed to let Dolly play in the league.“She became my chaperone, and we boarded a train to Miami, and then to Havana,” Dolly recalled. “That was Jackie Robinson’s first year, and because of segregation, the Brooklyn Dodgers held spring training in Cuba. When they finished, we followed them in.”\n\nThe living arrangements of the women’s league were likely unique in the annals of pro sports. The younger players—and there were many—had chaperones, and the players lived with fans.\n\n“When I was with the Sound End Blue Sox, my landlord worked at Sears & Roebuck and his wife stayed home. He was an usher at the ballpark. My roommate was from Tampa and the two of us rented a bedroom in their home,” she recalled.\n\n“We had a chaperone who was responsible for where we lived and who we lived with. It was a very controlled situation.”\n\nIn the girls league, the distances—between mound and plate, and the bases—were shorter. “The outfield was cut down some too, but there were not that many fences,” Brumfield said. ”It wasn’t like ball fields today and it was different in every city. In Grand Rapids, right field stopped at a factory wall.”\n\nBrumfield played with three teams: the South Bend Blue Sox, the Kenosha Comets and, lastly, the Fort Wayne Daisies. She played every position but pitcher and catcher.\n\nIn 1952, she joined the Daisies and their coach, legendary major league slugger Jimmy Foxx. He was said to be the inspiration for Jimmy Dugan, the role played by Tom Hanks in, “A League of Their Own.”\n\nThe Hanks’ character talked a mile a minute. Brumfield recalls Fox somewhat differently, as a “great guy” who was “quite reserved, very down to business.”\n\nShe tells a story about Foxx directing her to second base. “I never played second base,” Brumfield told him.\n\nTo which Foxx replied, “That’s OK,” and off she went to second.\n\nBrumfield’s best season was in 1950. In 108 games, she amassed 108 hits, scored 58 runs, drove in 37 runs, and stole 37 bases.\n\nShe retired in 1953 and the league, suffering from low attendance, folded the next year.\n\nThough she barnstormed in the summers, Brumfield was able to go to high school at Murphy High in Mobile, then college. In 1954, she graduated from the Alabama College for Women—now the University of Montevallo. Later, she earned her master’s and doctorate degrees in physical education at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nBrumfield coached softball at Henderson State University in Arkansas for 31 years. While there, she met and married her husband, Joe White.\n\nIn 1988, the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown installed a permanent display called, “Women in Baseball,” to honor those who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball Association.\n\nShe has been inducted into the University of Montevallo and Henderson State halls of fame. In 2003, Dr. White was invited to the White House by President George W. Bush, a big baseball fan. She served as first base coach in one of the South Lawn tee ball games hosted by the president."
