Mr. Blumenfeld studied at Juilliard School of Music under John Mehegan, and received his M.A. in music composition from Rutgers University, New Brunswick for his research into early jazz piano music, which eventually resulted in two published books on the art of blues and barrelhouse piano improvisation. He received a grant from the New Jersey Council on the Arts to compose his Barrelhouse Piano Concerto, which was performed in the S.F. Bay Area in 1980. Many of his extensive list of compositions include movements of jazz music. He has been a frequent recipient of ASCAPLUS (ASCAP) AWARDS. He taught a popular course, Free Improvisation at the Piano at the University of California, Berkeley Extension School for twenty years and at the Berkeley Jazz School for five years. Prior to his work in the field of Jazz, Mr. Blumenfeld worked extensively in the field of Jewish music as a composer, teacher, cantor and conductor of synagogue choirs. He has composed several large symphonic works on Jewish themes. Mr. Blumenfeld is primarily a classical composer. He has composed eleven piano concertos (three have been performed,) many works for various chamber ensembles, much music for solo piano and many art songs. Ten songs from his two operas were recently performed in Berkeley as part of the (Berkeley, CA) Trinity Chamber Concerts series, a venue which has presented much of his chamber music for several years. All of Mr. Blumenfeld’s original manuscripts are in the music archives of the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Blumenfeld has performed multiple times at Yoshi’s, Oakland. <pastedGraphic.png> www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obx- shYx1Kg Mr. Blumenfeld lives in Richmond California where he composes, writes & teaches. 2019-05-01 Robert Birgeneau, Chancellor Emeritus, UC Berkeley Undocumented Graduate Students: A Forgotten National Resource eRev 05-06-2019 2019-04-24 Professor Alonzo Addison Crowds, Clouds and Culture: The Future of the Past.

Kupers, M.D., M.S.P. , Institute Professor Emeritus, Wright Institute The Social Costs of Mass Incarceration and Supermax Isolation While “lock-‘em-up-and-throw-away-the-key implies prisons exist somewhere apart and prisoners are all heinous criminals, the truth is that prisons are very much part of our social fabric and the huge majority of prisoners are fairly ordinary people who saw their lives go awry earlier on. When nearly 2 1/2 million people are disappeared behind bars (plus another million immigrants in detention), society is impacted in many subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The turn toward solitary confinement is merely one example of the harm that results. Some re-thinking about criminal justice is urgently needed. Terry A. Kupers, M.D., M.S.P. is Institute Professor Emeritus at The Wright Institute and Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association. He provides expert testimony in class action litigation regarding the psychological effects of prison conditions including isolated confinement, the quality of correctional mental health care, and the effects of sexual abuse in correctional settings. He is author of Solitary: The Inside Story of Supermax Isolation and How We Can Abolish It (Univ of California Press, 2017); Prison Madness: The Mental Health Crisis Behind Bars and What We Must Do About It (1999) and co-editor of Prison Masculinities (2002). He is a Contributing Editor of Correctional Mental Health Report. He received the 2005 Exemplary Psychiatrist Award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). 2018-07-11 Demotion of 2017-2018 President Tina Etcheverry Demotion of 2017-2018 President Tina Etcheverry Demotion of 2017-2018 President Tina Etcheverry 2018-07-10 Michael Trumpis, Current Topics In Neural Interfacing Satellite Club: Current Topics In Neural Interfacing: Brain-machine interfaces Satellite Club: Series of Talks and Discussion about Science and Technology in Berkeley Current Topics In Neural Interfacing: The physiology and technology behind brain-machine interfaces 2018-06-27 Matthew O'Brien, Photographer and Author An alternative view of Colombia: Colombia in Photographs 2018-06-20 Peter Kasin The Music and Lore of Sea Chanties The Music and the Lore of Sea Chanties.
