        "text": "BRIDGEPORT, Pa. — Former Washington & Jefferson College men’s and women’s swimming/water polo coach Mike Orstein added another accolade to his resume as part of the 2020 Pennsylvania Aquatics Hall of Fame induction class.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Aquatics Hall of Fame was established by the Pennsylvania State University in 1968 and recognizes those Pennsylvanians who have exhibited extraordinary service and achievement through aquatics. The Hall of Fame is located in McCoy Natatorium Building on the University Park Campus. It includes a plaque with appropriate inscription, nameplates, framed pictures of elected members, and a brief summary of their accomplishments.\n\nOrstein is no stranger to the world of aquatics, a sport that he has been a part of his entire life. His 487-219-3 record W&J over 30 years made him the most successful swimming and diving coach in the college’s history. For his accomplishments, Orstein was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame for Washington-Greene County Chapter in May of 2014. He is also a May 2015 inductee into the Western Pennsylvania Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nOn May 7, 2016 Orstein was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame for the Susquehanna Valley Chapter. He earned his 400th career victory at W&J during the 2011-12, while also coaching four student-athletes to individual conference championships, including diver Bethany Haver, who made her second-straight appearance at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III National Championships.\n\nCoach Orstein’s continued success has also been recognized at the national level, as he was awarded the prestigious Master Coach Award at the May 1996 College Swimming Coaches of America Association’s (CSCAA) national convention. This honor was only conferred upon eight NCAA coaches that year.\n\nRecently, Orstein has been honored by the American Swimming Coaches Association with a Certificate of Excellence for outstanding achievement (2006-2008).\n\nCoach Orstein’s career record, which has spanned 34 years, is 547-244-4. During the 2014-2015 season, he passed a major milestone as he earned his 500th college swimming victory.\n\nCoach Orstein had been at the helm of the swimming and diving programs at W&J for 30 years, and earned the Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) Swimming Coach of the Year award an impressive 15 times. His other accomplishments during his career at the college include producing eight national champions, 17 All-America honorees, 36 NCAA Division III Swimming and Diving Championship qualifiers and 251 PAC Champions. He has coached teams to nine PAC titles, 221 school records and 61 conference records.\n\nDuring the 2010-11 season, Haver earned a pair of First All-America awards after placing among the top eight finishers (5th, 3-meter; 7th 1-meter) at the NCAA Division III Diving Championships.\n\nFrom 2004-08, Orstein coached his daughter, Kaitlyn, to one of the most impressive careers in the history of NCAA Division III swimming. Kaitlyn won eight national championships and earned 14 NCAA All-America citations. She won 25 conference championships and was a four-time PAC Swimmer of the Year.\n\nAn equally impressive and important accomplishment is his team’s success out of the water. Coach Orstein’s teams consistently earned CSCAA All-Academic recognition for having one of the highest GPA’s in the country.\n\nHis most prized possession is being honored with the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Distinguished Service Award for outstanding leadership on January 17, 2005, by Washington & Jefferson College.\n\nPrior to his tenure at Washington and Jefferson College, Coach Orstein served as the Athletic Director at York Country Day School and Head Women’s Swimming Coach at York College (PA). During his time there he built the York team into a regional Division III power, earned a winning percentage of .847, and rewrote the college’s record books.\n\nFrom 1979-1982 Coach Orstein gained international experience through his position in Bermuda as the first Aquatics Director at Warwick Academy. During his time in Bermuda, he coached numerous national champions and record holders, and was integral in the revival of water polo through his position as the player/coach for the Belmont team.\n\nIn much the same way, Orstein was responsible for the emergence of water polo at W&J when he secured a $60,000 grant from the United States Olympic Committee in April 1999. This victory came after eight years of effort on Coach Orstein’s part to bring the sport to the college. During his four seasons as head coach, both men’s and women’s teams were ranked nationally in the Top 10 every year. The women’s team traveled to the Collegiate III National Championships, where they finished seventh in 2000 and sixth in 2001. In this short amount of time the team produced three All-America selections. Orstein also received the honor of being named the Division III Tournament Championships Coach of the Year in 2002 and as well as earning Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) Southern Division Coach of the Year that same season.\n\nPrior to Coach Orstein’s involvement in the successful water polo program, he served as the W&J men’s and women’s track and field coach. Under Orstein, Jaimee Heffner became the first W&J female athlete to win an individual NCAA championship when she won the 1997 Division III Championship in the women’s javelin. She ended her career at W&J with honors including being a four time All-American, nomination as one of 10 finalists for the NCAA Woman of the Year Award, and the reception of an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship Award.\n\nOrstein’s athletic accomplishments are nearly as weighty as his achievement in coaching. He is a four time All-America swimmer from Springfield College (Mass.), where he completed both his B.S. and M.Ed. in Physical Education.\n\nCoach Orstein was born and raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania where he was an All-State swimmer, an All-District III track and field athlete and a graduate of Manheim Township High School.\n\nCoach Orstein has been happily married to his wife Heather for 40 years. Mike and Heather are the proud parents of their two adult children, Jepthah and Kaitlyn. Jepthah is a 2004 graduate of Washington & Jefferson College and a 2008 graduate of the Duquesne University School of Law. He is a successful lawyer for Ainsman, Levine, LLC in Pittsburgh. He has been recognized for five consecutive years as a Pennsylvania Super Lawyer, Rising Star. Kaitlyn, a 2008 W&J graduate, works for Fife Heating & Cooling as their office manager.\n\nHe is among three water polo coaches/players inducted in the Class of 2020 by joining Henry Jamison “Jam” Handy and John Bayes Norton:\n\n2020 Pennsylvania Aquatics Hall of Fame Class:\n\nAnthony “Tony” Bartle was a four-year high school All-American swimmer who competed at LaSalle College before attending North Penn HS for his senior year.

On the National and International level, Tony was a 6-time High Point Award winner at the Middle Atlantic Swimming Championships and a two-time Kiputh Award winner at the Eastern Long Course Swimming Championships. Most impressively, Tony is a two-time American record holder. He placed fourth at the US Olympic Trials in the 200-meter butterfly and was ranked fifth in the world in that event. Tony was a silver medalist at the US National Championships on three different occasions and was a 5 time US National team member. Over the years he was ranked in the top 10 in the world in 4 events (200 butterfly, 200, 400 and 1500 freestyle). Tony closed his career at the 1980 US Olympic Trials with a 4th place finish in the 400 Freestyle and a 6th place finish in the 200 Butterfly. In his last swim at that meet, all 8 finalists bettered the silver medalists time from the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. Tony proudly joins his brother Bill, as a member of the PA Aquatics Hall of Fame.\n\nWilliam Ronald Forrester, Jr. was born in Darby, Pennsylvania and is an Olympic medalist and former world record-holder. He represented the United States as an 18-year-old at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, where he won a bronze medal in the men’s 200-meter butterfly, finishing behind U.S. teammates Mike Bruner and Steve Gregg. At the 1975 World Championships, Bill Forrester won the gold medal in the 200m butterfly and the bronze in the 100m. He bettered that performance at the 1978 World Championships, winning golds in the 200 freestyle and on the 4×200 freestyle relay, adding a bronze in the 400m free. Forrester also won\n\nthe AAU 200m butterfly in 1976. He graduated from Auburn in 1980 and later became a swim coach, founding the Georgia Coastal Aquatic Team in 1994.\n\nG.

Mike has been the Director of Competitive Swimming at the WSY since 1989. Mike has coached High School teams at Central Dauphin East (1992-1994), Trinity High School (2002-2013) and since 2014 has been the Head Coach for Cumberland Valley High School. Mike’s philosophy, in and out of the water, is one that allows the ambitious student-athlete to excel both in the pool and in the classroom. In this philosophy, goals and preparation must match and athletes are taught and expected to budget their time effectively. Coach Mike participates actively in swimming legislation and political bodies. A member of the Olympic International Operations Committee, Coach Mike has served on the Olympic International Operations Committee, as well as previously served on the YMCA of the USA Coaches executive committee and the Middle Atlantic Swimming Inc, Board of Directors.

Handy was noted for the number of training films that he produced over the years. As a swimmer, Handy introduced a number of new swimming strokes to Americans, such as the Australian crawl. He would often wake up early and devise new strokes to give him an edge over other swimmers. Swimming led to him earning a bronze in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri. Twenty years later he was part of the Illinois Athletic Club water polo team at the 1924 Olympics in Paris, France. He broke the record of the longest period of time between first and last competition. The team won the bronze at that Olympics. Handy briefly attended the University of Michigan and competed for the Chicago AA and the Illinois AC while working for the Chicago Tribune. He was forced to do most of his training at 3 AM after the newspaper had been put to bed. Handy was an innovative swimmer and would have won more championships had all his ideas stood the test of competition. However, in many fields he was years ahead of his time; he was, for example, the first to use the alternate arm style in the backstroke. He also pioneered underwater photography for stroke analysis and in his later years, set up the Jam Handy Corporation, which specialized in motivational and training films, notably producing many films for the auto industry. The Jam Handy Organization was probably best known for producing the first animated version of the then-new Christmas story Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer directed by Max Fleischer.\n\nStu Marvin is a 1978 graduate of Bloomsburg, Stu was an 11-time All American performer for the Huskies, winning five PSAC titles, and setting six conference records.
