John was Plainville’s own “wild thing” before there was a wild thing. I had the benefit of watching John pitch and I can say that there were many more “happy feet” in the batter’s box that set feet. John was effectively wild at times that even the best opposition knew not to get comfortable in the batter’s box. John Pitched 4 seasons in the Houston Astros organization, Compiling a 13-8 record, 7 Saves and 134 K’s in 169.1 innings and was named to the1999 Midwest League All-Star team.\n\n1958-59 State Champion Football Team:\n\nWho can forget the names of Steve Vargo, John Gacek, Jim Parilli , Joe Natale, Tom Graney, Brian Brooks, Larry Biskupiak, Bob Dalke, Dave Christiansen, Roger Roy, Dick Synott , Bob Browne and so many others.

The team outscored its opponents 278 to 12, The 266 point margin still stands as the school record for scoring supremacy. It was also mystifying to the opposition how an offensive line that averaged 155lbs could dominate the line of scrimmage with stability every game that year. Hard work and team work under the guidance of coach Charlie Palmer brought out the best in every team member.\n\nRobin “RJ” Anderson,\n\nA 1998 graduate who was a three sport star athlete in Football Basketball and Baseball.

On a side note, RJ won the regional Punt Pass and Kick as a 12 year old in Foxboro.

John’s breakout game came Oct. 17, 1970 when he rushed for 238 yds on 25 carries, and scored 5 touchdowns in a 32-6 win @ Bloomfield.\n\nA compact 5’9”, 198 lb combination of power,& speed and piston like drive as a running back was unequaled in any era.\n\nJohn’s track career was a Coach’s dream. He ran the 100 yd dash, 110yd high hurdles, 220 low hurdles, and threw the shot put.

After a 2-6 outing in 1936, PHS welcomed new teachers and coaches Charles “Chuck” Hardy and Ivan Wood to help turn the program around. Not only were they instrumental in selecting the PHS nickname but were able to motive 32 young athletes to achieve the impossible. The 1937 Football Team achieved greatness by winning the Farmington Valley League and State Class C title while producing the only undefeated and unscored upon team in Plainville history. Their 7-0 record was highlighted by scoring 90 points while not allowing any points to be scored. The Farmington Valley League was considered to be strong in 1937 and the Blue Devils were not expected to show much. The season opened at Farmington and fullback Louis Tucker crashed through the line for a touchdown with 3 minutes left. It was all they needed to start this miraculous run. In the second game Simsbury then headed to Plainville and Dick West’s 2 touchdowns secured the victory. The 3rd game of the season was pitted against Berlin who expected to stop the run. However, led by Tucker’s three touchdowns Plainville went on to a 20-0 victory. Mid-way through the season was the annual game against the alumni. This was a classic defensive battle and the only score came on a pass play from Tucker to Alden Doughty for six. The team then traveled to Winsted to face a tough Gilbert team. The scoring opened with a 55-yard pass play to Dick West. Tucker and Dom Forcella added 2 touchdowns each for a 31-0 victory. The team that was expected to be mediocre had now played 5 games, scored 77 points, and allowed none. At this point of the season the state had only 9 unscored upon teams and Plainville led in scoring with Hillhouse next at 76 points. The team was put to the test against Collinsville and only a second quarter passing attack that put Dick West in the end zone for 6 showed any offense on the part of Plainville’s game. The contest from start to finish was a bitter defensive battle. The only remaining challenge was arch rival Southington who was coming into this game outscoring their opponents 129-14. The game would decide the league championship and state C title. On Plainville’s first possession they marched 63 yards capped by a Tucker rush for the touchdown. Early in the 2nd quarter Tucker was injured and was put out of the game, thus immobilizing the offense. The defense with West the leading tackler and Hubert Royce’s booming punts held the ferocious air attack unleashed by Southington. The final stand was in the fourth quarter when the defense held Southington to a “four and out”. At that point the score ended at 7-0 capping the miraculous season of unbeaten and unscored upon as the most successful season in Plainville Football history.\n\n2012\n\nHall of Fame Inductees 2012\n\nBrian Biskupiak\n\nBrian Biskupiakcould make a fastball sing and put a break on his curve that would make even his cap’s seem marginal.“He was a competitor to the nth degree,” said former Plainville coach Rob Freimuth (Hall of Fame Class of 2006). “He had a bulldog mentality. He had three pitches he could throw for strikes and all you need at the high school level to be successful is two.“He was mature beyond his years and had a great concept how to get people out.” Biskupiak’s concentration and the intimidation factor he had on his success cannot be documented, but he posted a 15-2 lifetime mark for the Blue Devils, his junior year standing out as a lasting signature. He went 8-0 for the season, 3-0 in the Class L tournament without yielding a run. He pitched in 21 of the 28 innings in four tournament wins.In 65 innings, he struck out 79 batters. He also batted .328 and scored 25 runs.He earned All-State honors as a junior and a senior, when he posted a 6-2 mark for the team that lost in the ‘L’ final to South Windsor, 5-4, in extra innings.

It culminated with Palmer pushing into the end zone from a yard out. Palmer connected with Vet Mason Jr. for a 32-yard touchdown with 1:16 left to set off a celebration. Palmer, called “the best quarterback in the state” by his coach Jim Lynch, went 10-for-20 for 124 yards, but his fourth-quarter numbers are more defining: 7-for-10, 113 yards. Jeff was a three-sport, four-year standout with the physical attributes and competitive presence second to none.

He was also a three-year varsity participant as a defensive-minded forward on the basketball team and a catcher for the baseball team, but that grey day in November will always stand as Palmer’s legacy.\n\nMary BoiczykWestkott\n\nThe girls swimming records displayed at the Plainville High pool still bear a familiar name from the mid-1990s, familiar enough that she will be inducted into the Plainville Sports Hall of Fame on October 6th as a member of the 2012 class. That name is Mary Boiczyk. She qualified for the State Open to gain All-State honors all four years. She was also an All-State discus thrower as a senior and threw the javelin at an all-Northwest Conference level. She competed in the discus event in the New Englands. She was named captain in both sports.Boiczyk, swim team MVP in 1993 and 1994, set individual records in the 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard butterfly. Her talents contributed considerably to records in the 200-yard medley and 200-yard freestyle relays. The 200-yard medley record still stands 20 years later. Her teams went 45-8.In track and field, Boiczyk was a four-year letter-winner and three time state qualifier. She qualified for the State Open and New Englands as a senior. She earned the Best in Field Award at the Greater Bristol Open in 1995. She set a school record throwing the discus.\n\nIn the classroom, she achieved All-Academic Northwest Conference recognition all four years. She was the Athletic Backers’ Outstanding Female Athlete her senior year.Her accomplishments led to achieving Plainville High’s highest honor – the William Cassidy Outstanding Athlete award – in 1995. She also won the Joseph Dehm Physical Education Award.She went on to Springfield College where she competed on the swim team all four years. She was a national qualifier and received All-America Honorable Mention in three of them. She established records in the 100-yard and 200-yard butterfly, and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays.\n\nNever one to put athletics above academics, Boiczyk won the Springfield College Female Scholar-Athlete Award in 1999. After making the Dean’s List all four years, she graduated magna cum laude with a degree in physical education in 1999 and earned a Masters in special education at Southern Connecticut State University. She was the female athlete of the year for her first three years and scholar-athlete of the year as a senior. She was recognized by her professors at Springfield with the Frisbie-Weisbrod Award, emblematic of being among top senior students in physical education, athletic training, health fitness and sport management. As a junior, she was a United States Achievement Academy All-American scholar and professors bestowed the Eric Palmer Award – the most prestigious physical education student – upon her.She is currently a member of the physical education faculty at the United States Coast Guard Academy and is in her 13th year as the assistant swim coach for the women’s team.\n\nEarl Snyder\n\nThe moment on a day in late spring was frozen in time. The year was 1994. The Plainville High baseball team was playing Holy Cross-Waterbury in the Class L championship. Earl Snyder caught a pitch on the sweet spot and sent a towering drive, the like rarely seen, that would become legendary for all who watched it soar. The ball disappeared into the woods well beyond the left field fence at Middletown’s Palmer Field, and it didn’t dribble in. It cut through branches halfway to the top of the majestic evergreens well beyond the fence. It came in the first inning, setting the tone for the Blue Devils’ 10-6 win. Snyder went on to glory at the University of Hartford (1996-98) and in a professional career that included big-league time with the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox.The Devils advanced to state title games for three seasons, winning crowns in 1992 and 1994. In 1993, he batted .361, whacked six homers and drove in 21 runs. As a senior, he hit .378 with five homers and 28 RBI.\n\nSnyder went on to rewrite the University of Hartford record book. He remains first in home runs (53), RBI (173), hits (222), total bases (423) and runs (146). He was second in slugging and third all-time with a .374 batting average. He still shares season records for the most RBI (58 in ’96) and hits (66 in ’96) with Jeff Bagwell and has the highest season slugging percentage in school history (.822 in ’98).Snyder was chosen by the New York Mets in the 36th round of the 1998 amateur draft and assigned to Pittsfield of the Class A (Short-Season Rookie League) New York Penn League. He advanced to the full-season South Atlantic League with Capital City in 1999 (25 doubles, 28 HR, 97 RBI) and to the Mets’ Advanced Class A team in St. Lucie (Florida State League) in 2000 (36 doubles, 25 HR, 93 RBI). He was given the Nelson Doubleday Award emblematic of the team’s most valuable player in both 1999 and 2000. In 2001, he hit .281 with 20 homers and 35 doubles with Binghamton in the Eastern League. He was named EL Player of the Month for June by batting .367 with eight homers and 25 RBI. He played in the Double-A All-Star Game July 11 and hit a home run in the National League’s 8-3 win.By again winning the Doubleday Award, he became the first Mets minor leaguer to win the award for three consecutive seasons.Snyder was sent to the Cleveland Indians in 2001 and made his major league debut on April 28, 2002 and played in 18 games that season.He was selected off waivers by the Boston Red Sox in January 2003, and turned in two strong seasons for the Pawtucket Red Sox. He was named International League Player of the Week on May 3 and chosen as both a midseason and postseason all-star.Snyder earned a promotion to Boston and played in one game – Aug. 18. Earl finished his final campaign (2007) with the White Sox’ Triple-A club in Charlotte.\n\nJeffrey Sengle\n\nJeff Sengle was blessed with an astounding blend of strength and speed to carve out a Hall-of-Fame worthy career as a baseball and football player at Plainville High.On the diamond, no leadoff hitter could possibly wreak more havoc with the opposition’s pitching and defense. His exquisite talents placed him in varsity competition right from the start, enabling him to set a record that can be tied but never broken. Sengle was among three Blue Devils to have played in four state championship games.On the gridiron, he establish a school record in all-purpose yardage (2,803) and to become the Blue Devils’ first 1,000-yard rusher since Johnny Gacek in 1957. Sengle’s legacy should lead off with baseball as he led off so proficiently during an era that validated Plainville High as the seat of one of the sport’s great scholastic dynasties. He scored 42 runs in 88 plate appearances. Early in his junior season when he truly emerged as a superstar, he went 2-for-2, was hit twice by pitches and scored three runs in a win over Naugatuck. He batted .333 with 17 stolen bases as a junior. As a senior co-captain, he hit .340 and stole 25 sacks.Plainville pounded Maloney, 15-3, in the 1995 Class L final, and Sengle played his role exquisitely, drawing three walks, stealing three bases and scoring three runs. The Devils may have not even reached that final if Sengle hadn’t blasted a two-run, eighth-inning homer to sink Jonathan Law, 5-3, and advance Plainville to a quarterfinal game with Watertown. He went on to hit .403 and steal 19 bases for the Plainville American Legion team that summer.\n\nSengle established himself as one of the school’s great running backs in the fall of his junior year. He scored three touchdowns in the opening day 27-20 win over Notre Dame-Fairfield. He ran for 100 yards on 11 carries in a win over Avon in which he raced for a 63-yard touchdown on the second play of the game. AgainstBullard-Havens Tech of Bridgeport, he scored four touchdowns, amassed 233 all-purpose yards and ran back the second-half kickoff for an 86-yard touchdown.He broke a Plainville season rushing record with 1,010 yards as a senior He ran for 131 yards to help secure a 19-8 victory despite having missed the previous two games. Sengle received an endorsement from a local scout about his potential as a professional baseball player, but went on to play football and baseball at Middlebury (Vt.) College.\n\nRichard Buchanan\n\nBuchanan was a three-sport athlete for the Blue Devils from 1953-57, gaining attention in basketball, baseball and football, but he noted that statistics and team achievements pale in comparison to the lessons in life that team sports and great coaches teach. He selflessly passed what he learned on to the impressionable Plainville athletes who succeeded him. He was a starting guard on the basketball team as a sophomore in 1955. As a junior in 1955-56, he was selected the Most Valuable Player on a winning team that was building toward Plainville’s golden years – the state championships crafted by Riera in 1959 and 1961.Richie was proficient from the foul line. His teammates made note of his leadership capabilities and unanimously elected him captain for his senior year. Richie’s exploits on the hardwood stand foremost in memory. He led the 1956-57 squad in scoring, foul shooting percentage and assists. He broke the school record for field goal percentage.\n\nOn the diamond, the southpaw was a starting pitcher and outfielder as a sophomore and junior. As a senior, he batted over .300, but the regret of not qualifying for the state tournament despite posting a winning record is a deep-seated memory. Plainville defeated Southington in the final game, and the Blue Knights went on to state finals.\n\nIn football as a senior, he was a two-way starter at end for a team that won the Connecticut Valley Conference championship and went 6-3. Two of the losses were to Bristol (one high school in those days) and Southington, both of which more than doubled PHS in enrollment.The hardships he endured in committing everything he had to his teams went a long way in making the man, who coached PHS sports from 1963-83.\n\nAfter attending Southern Connecticut State College, Buchanan returned to his roots.He spent 13 seasons as an assistant basketball coach, as the Devils posted winning records across the board. The 1965-66 team went to the state final but lost a 59-52 decision to East Catholic.He served as head soccer coach for the program’s first seven seasons. The Devils qualified for their first tournament and battled defending state champion Guilford on the road but lost in double overtime.“Never was I so proud of a team I coached,” he says. “They were only exposed to soccer for the first time as high school students.” Statistics meant little to Richie Buchanan, especially next to his devotion to the student-athletes of his town.\n\n1983 State Champion Baseball Team\n\nThe Blue Devils have won eight state championships and the first came in resounding fashion in 1983.The Blue Devils, under the guidance of head coach Ron Jones, went 23-0 to become the school’s first undefeated team since 1938. They outscored their opposition 194-58 and placed three players on the All-State squad. Plainville defeated Sheehan-Wallingford, 5-1, in the final on June 12 at Southington High School. Plainville had posted some exceptional teams in the first seven years of Jones’ tenure, but none was able to break through to a title. The 1981 season ended at the hands of Sheehan, so the season-ending victory over the Titans two years later was sweet revenge.The Devils burned Farmington (9-4), Watertown (6-4, quarterfinals), Joel Barlow-Redding (7-0, semifinals) along the way.\n\nWhen the23-game mission was complete, the Plainville program was honored by being selected the top team in District 1 – one geographical region out of eight nationally – by the American Baseball Coaches Federation. Plainville was the lone unbeaten team among the eight.\n\nJones summed the season up in a quotation borrowed from the late Hal Levy of the Shore Line Times in Guilford, who covered the championship game against Sheehan:“You’re dealing with a 17-year-old mind. If you can control a 17-year-old mind for a length of time, you’re going to make a million dollars and have a best seller.”Whether Jones’ squad was the best in Plainville’s regal baseball history may be subject to debate, but not too much.\n\n1984 State Champion Baseball Team\n\nThe expectations for the 1984 Plainville High baseball team were astronomical as they very well should have been. Jeff Howes, the toast of the undefeated 1983 Class M champion team as a leader, a sensational pitcher and timely slugger, returned for his senior year with plenty of support. Rick Ouellette was productive at the plate and in spot duty on the mound. Both were All-Staters as juniors. Four other starters returned.\n\nIn an early season National High School Baseball Poll published by Collegiate Baseball magazine, Plainville was positioned where New England teams rarely tread. The Devils were ranked 15th.But expectations have a tendency of weighing heavy on the shoulders of high school athletes. After crushing Middletown and Goodwin Tech to start the season, the Blue Devils lost consecutive games to Naugatuck, ending a 25-game unbeaten skein, and Bristol Eastern. They got back in the win column against Wolcott but lost three straight to Avon, Woodrow Wilson and Wilcox Tech. On May 2, Plainville was 3-5. “It’s the fat-cat syndrome and I’m not happy with it,” head coach Ron Jones told the Plainville News after the Wilson loss. “I was concerned with the attitudes. They didn’t think anyone was going to be able to beat them. You’re not going to win a championship with words. It takes a lot of hard work and discipline.”\n\nOn June 12, after a stirring 7-5 win over Berlin in the legendary Class M title game played before about 3,500 at Beehive Field, the Devils had finished 20-5.Starting with a 12-1 win over Farmington after the Wilcox Tech loss, Plainville produced double-digit run totals in 12 of the 17 successive victories, outscoring foes by a jaw-dropping 195-42. The Devils avenged all five losses, completed a three-game sweep of Berlin in the championship and scored less than eight runs only once (4-2 win over Naugatuck on May 24).The Devils collectively batted .320 compared to .167 for the opposition. They outscored them 251-75 and out-hit them 286-151 to secure their position with the finest that Plainville has ever produced.\n\nThe championship game was Jones’ last at Plainville. He went 153-40 over his nine-year tenure including 62-7 over the final three.\n\n2011\n\nHall of Fame Inductees 2011\n\nFred Kalbach\n\nPlainville High School’s track coach from 1961-64, racking up a record of 48-2 in dual meets while winning three straight league titles, two Class M State titles and four consecutive indoor Class M track titles. His cross country teams were 44-1 and won the Class M State championship in 1962. One of his team members won the New England championship in 1962.\n\nTed Davis\n\nWas a key member of Plainville’s first state championship basketball team in 1958-59. The Blue Devils won the Class B title thanks in large part to Davis’ long-range shooting, who earned All-State recognition in his senior year. “I was fortunate because I played with John Gacek, Brian Brooks, Steve Vargo and Jim Tufts,” Davis says humbly. “I had a good year. A road win at East Haven, a perennial Class B power in that era, to break their 66-game home winning streak was one of Ted’s proudest moments. “I’ve had a lot of them and getting into the Hall of Fame is right up there with them,” he says.\n\nTed supplied rebounding as well as an uncanny ability to stretch a zone with his great outside shooting. Davis went on to play two years of basketball during his time in the Air Force. His unit won a Southwest District championship playing against area colleges, army bases and naval stations, but it was the championship season at PHS that will always be his most indelible memory. “It was a great year. I’ll never forget it,” Davis says. “It was a team effort, not about individuals. That’s what I am most proud about.”\n\nEric Misko\n\nEric Misko can be anointed as the godfather of Plainville High wrestling. During his senior season, he became the first Blue Devil to win three straight Northwest Conference titles, the first to place in a State Open meet, the first to win at a CIAC meet and the first to qualify for the New England championships. He lettered in wrestling all four years, compiling a record of 97-15. He was a two-time state finalist and was team captain as a junior and senior. He was Most Outstanding Wrestler in the Northwest Conference in 1988 and 1990.\n\nAn experience late in his sophomore season ignited his love for wrestling when he met a returning state champion from Berlin in an NWC title bout. He was pushed around for most of the first two periods until he used a headlock and throw late in the second to put his foe on the brink of defeat. He couldn’t finish, but re-created his move in the third period to register the upset. “He was squirming and choking and I just squeezed and settled in as he flipped around trying to free himself,” Misko recalls. “He fought and fought, and I feared the period would run out on me again, but I just kept making that headlock tighter and trying to pin his shoulders down. Suddenly the referee hit the mat and called the pin. “I recall running across the mat and jumping into my coaches arms. I was hooked.” Misko burst into prominence as one of the state’s best wrestlers his senior year by taking the prestigious Bristol Central Invitational by storm. In winning a championship, he was also Most Outstanding Wrestler and won the Fastest Fall Award. Misko earned the Michael Hawksley Memorial Award and was the most outstanding Blue Devil wrestler in 1990.\n\nTom BorioThe Plainville High baseball legacy hadn’t yet reached its golden years when Tom Borio came along and boosted the Blue Devils toward statewide recognition. He played three seasons for Hall of Fame coach Rob Freimuth. “It was fun for me to watch him evolve as a baseball player and as an athlete,” Freimuth says. “He was a big kid physically, but lacked strength. I told him he had to do 100 push-ups at practice and 100 at home each night. “He worked hard to improve his physical condition and turned into a bulldog who loved to compete.”\n\nBorio, a three-time All-Northwest Conference third baseman/pitcher, had 20 hits as a sophomore for a league title team. As a junior when he went 5-2 with a 1.89 ERA. In his senior season, he was 6-3 with a 0.88 ERA, striking out 65 batters in 55 innings.\n\nHe was selected to the Connecticut High School Coaches Association All-Star Game and was the recipient of the Tom Gaudette Award as Plainville’s outstanding senior player.\n\nBorio went on to a career at Western Connecticut State University that still lists him among the school’s all-time best pitchers. He went 17-7 with a 4.25 ERA from 1991-95. His winning percentage of .708 is third in school history. His 17 career wins tie him for second. He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in 1990. “His attitude and work ethic led him to a very successful collegiate career and this led him to being offered a professional contract,” Freimuth says. “He certainly typifies Winston Churchill’s famous quote, ‘The price you pay for excellence is your own sweat.’”\n\nWilliam Biskupiak\n\nBill Biskupiak was a three-sport star playing football, basketball and baseball, but his love for baseball stood out. He played shortstop for the venerable and versatile coach Ted Knurek, who called him “the best prospect in five years,” after he rapped out five hits over three preseason games. He was a four-year starter and captained the 1957 squad under first-year coach Robert Proulx. He played semi-pro ball for the New Britain Falcons and was team captain. Bill also starred in basketball, putting in four years as a starter for Plainville and its legendary mentor Pat Riera. He was named the team’s Most Valuable Player as a senior. On the gridiron, Bill played tailback for Knurek over three seasons.\n\nCompeting in one varsity sport in college is challenging enough, but Bill played both baseball and basketball for Southern Connecticut State College. He graduated with a degree in Physical Education/Health and Recreation and earned his Master’s from the University of Hartford in elementary education. When his playing days were over, Bill continued to contribute to local athletics through coaching and officiating. He coached the PHS freshmen basketball team and the junior varsity baseball team as well as Rocky Hill’s varsity baseball in 1980. Bill officiated high school basketball from 1961-90 and slo-pitch softball in Wethersfield from 1963-85.\n\nAmy Bisson Sykes\n\nVince Lombardi popularized the phrase that winning isn’t everything, it’s the only thing, but Amy Bisson Sykes is living proof that even the legendary Packers coach wasn’t always right. Amy vividly recalls small victories as a member of the Plainville High soccer team with great pleasure. Her greatest memory from her days as a Blue Devil was “going from an incredibly losing soccer team to making the state tournament my senior year”. “We ended up tying against New Britain to get in. I will never forget that game or that team. We had so much heart. It was fun to play and fun to be around. The girls all hung out outside of soccer. The seniors became big sisters to the younger players. We knew we weren’t going to win the state tournament. We just wanted to make it. We did, and I’ll never forget.”\n\nAmy scored 33 career goals (15 as a senior) and 12 assists over four years of varsity play. She was All-Northwest Conference four times and All-NWC Academic twice.\n\nBut it was her prowess in softball that earned her two All-State plaques and a scholarship to American International College in Springfield. She was a catcher in a career that ended with trips to the Connecticut High School Coaches Association All-Star Game and the inaugural game between the best from Connecticut and Massachusetts. Amy played four years of softball at AIC as a catcher and second baseman. As a freshman, her team finished sixth in the nation. Amy went on to become a legend in the world of women’s professional duckpin bowling. She is the winningest female on the tour and was Bowler of the Year in 2010.\n\nShe appears in the independently produced documentary, “Duckpin,” which focuses on the life and history of the sport.\n\n1961 Plainville High State Championship Basketball Team\n\nAs the 1960-61 season began to unfold, junior center Earle Jackson wasn’t convinced great results were on the horizon. Bill Lasher, the Blue Devils’ 6-foot-5 junior with a college career at Providence ahead of him, was injured early in the season. Newington and Simsbury appeared the teams to beat. But tenacity and unity joined hands under the guidance of coach Pat Riera. The Devils went 18-6 and went on to sweep away all competition to win the Class B state championship.\n\n“Surprising as it may seem, 1961 was not thought to be a good year prior to the season,” Earle relates. “Bill Lasher was injured early in the season. We had lost at least once to three of the teams predicted to win. There was not an All-State player on that team, yet we won.”\n\nThe Devils began the season by dropping a 49-45 verdict to the alumni, games that were often included in teams’ records in those days. After a 12-point loss to James Memorial of Simsbury, the Devils rebounded to win eight straight before losing to Simsbury again.\n\nAmong the victories was a rare “sudden death” win over St. Thomas Aquinas when a shot by Hoyt sealed a 52-50 win. “We won using a slowdown game,” Jackson said. “If you look at the scores, we averaged (50.2, to the opponents’ 43.9) per game. It was a very controlled game. Other teams may feel panicked, but we were so well-conditioned that we’d run a play until we found an opening. It may have taken us 30 or 40 seconds. The scores reflect that kind of play.” Plainville was seeded sixth in the tournament. The first hurdle was Newington, which the Devils had split with during the regular season. Jackson had 20 points to lead Plainville to a 47-33 triumph and a quarterfinal trip to Yale’s Payne Whitney Gym. The Devils stung Abbott Tech of Danbury, 49-31, with Jackson and Lasher combining for 37 points. Plainville lost both games against semifinal foe Simsbury during the Central Valley Conference season but gained revenge when it really counted, 39-35. Teamwork and defense mesmerized Lyman Hall of Wallingford in the final, a 45-36 conquest.\n\n1961 Plainville High State Championship Track Team\n\nCoach Fred Kalbach’s team strung together 27 successive dual-meet victories en route to a Central Valley Conference championship followed by Class B title in both indoor and outdoor competition.\n\n“Plainville had a span of about eight or nine years in track where everybody wanted to knock us off,” Earle Jackson recalls. “We didn’t lose a track meet in any of my three years and I don’t think we lost one for quite a while before I got there. “If you look closely, you might see that Plainville had one of the greatest track traditions in Connecticut that would rank up there with Weaver, Hillhouse and New Britain.\n\n“Plainville dominated the CVC in the mid-60s to mid-70s with more undefeated seasons than any team in the state and maybe in any sport, yet for some reason, the track team has received little recognition.”\n\nJackson established state records in the high jump, shot put and discus in leading the team to three consecutive state championships. Captain Gary Johnson ran the 100, 220 and was on the relay squad. “The reason I was chosen captain probably had a lot to do with Coach Palmer of the football team,” Johnson said. “I was a running back and as a junior, I tore ligaments in my knee and the coach said I needed to strengthen my legs. He wanted me to be captain so I would lead the team.”\n\nIndoor track meets were limited to only a few each year, generally held at state’s college facilities at Yale, UConn and Fairfield. The team recognizes Kalbach and Dino Iorli (Hall of Fame Class of 2004) as great track coaches. “Our coaches developed so much talent that they were able to position people like it was a chess game. They were able to put players where they best needed them,” Jackson says. “There were no selfish people. You took the egos out of it and you can get off on an ego trip in track very easily. That’s why we won a lot.”\n\nThe team won the Class B title by out pointing New Canaan, 30-28. The 8-0 CVC season was capped by a 62-42 win over Southington.\n\n2010\n\nHall of Fame Inductees 2010\n\nMichael Lantiere\n\nMike Lantiere has received many individual awards because of his involvement in sports, especially Little League Baseball. In 1995 when he was one of the umpires for the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. Lantiere worked in 20 of the 30 games and was part of the umpiring crew that worked the championship game. And this year he added something new to his resume-he was one of the replay officials at the Little League World Series. Mike is the head umpire of the East Region, which extends from Maine to Maryland. He has won the Little League’s President’s Award for outstanding volunteer. He also has been honored by the Connecticut High School Coaches Association as assistant coach of the ear for his work with the Southington baseball team. He is also a member of the Southington High baseball Hall of fame and received the Good Sport Award form the Connecticut Sports writers Alliance.\n\nLantiere, however, puts the people he’s met along the way far ahead of the plaques. He started making those friends when he played baseball, football and basketball at PHS playing with Hall of Famers such as Earl Jackson, Bill lasher, John Gacek, Steve Vargo and Rusty camp. Mike played on the 1961 state championship basketball team. He played quarterback on the football team and was a four year letter winner in baseball. Lantiere played shortstop as a senior tri-captain and went the entire season without making an error.\n\nVictor Paradis\n\nVictor Paradis had it drummed into his head at an early age how difficult it was to be a three sport athlete. “All I heard is that it’s easy to be good in one sport. But it’s challenging to be really good in all three sports”. Paradis pulled it off. He starred in three sports at PHS-football, basketball and baseball-to earn a ticket into the Hall of Fame. As a football player, he played tight end and led the team in catches and receiving yards as a senior. In basketball, he played on Plainville’s Colonial Conference Championship team. As a back-up during his junior year and was a starter as a senior, averaging 18 points per game. He led the team in field goal percentage (62 percent) and foul shooting percentage (88 percent). His best sport was baseball. He batted .320 as a junior and made the All Conference team. He was even more productive as a senior. He batted .438 with a team leading 23 RBI’s. He was first team All State and first team All Conference and was the starting catcher for the Connecticut All Star game.\n\nVictor went to UCONN on a baseball scholarship and won the starting catching job as a freshman during the fall season. A shoulder injury, however, ended his baseball career. Two years later when the shoulder healed, Paradis changed sports and became a basketball player at Valley Christian College in Pennsylvania, a NAIA school. He set eight records that still stand today and as a senior, was second in the nation in scoring and 11th in rebounding.\n\nHe said his experience at PHS was the perfect foundation for success in college. “Plainville sports did nothing but positive things for me, Paradis said. “I took a lot of what I learned and applied it to academics and to business.”\n\nJim Salomone\n\nJim Salomone’s first exposure to PHS athletics came courtesy of his brother John, the captain of the 1960 football team. “He used to bring his football buddies home with him, Salomone said, and they were all heroes to me”. Jim was the quarterback of a football team that won its first eight games, winning the Class B Merit Award, which was the equivalent of a state championship. His most memorable moment took place against Torrington, when he led a dramatic comeback to give Plainville its eighth straight win. The only blemish on that season was a loss to Southington on Thanksgiving Day. He carries that momentum into the basketball season and was the captain and staring guard of a team that advanced to the championship game of the Class B State Tournament before losing to East Catholic of Manchester in the title game, 59-52.\n\nSalomone made All Central Valley Conference team as a senior and in basketball he made All Conference in both junior and senior years. He was also regarded as one of the best foul shooters in school history. Following high school, Jim became a pilot in the Air Force for 12 years.\n\nSara DoncetOn land, Sara was just another athlete. But put her in the water and she became a star. She has the accomplishments to prove it becoming one of the most celebrated swimmers in the history of PHS. Not only did she compete for four years, she was All State for those four years and was the MVP of her league, the Connecticut Valley Conference, for four years. In state meet competition, she set the Class S record in the backstroke in 1991 and broke her own mark in 1992, a record that stood for 14 years. She set school records in the 100-yard backstroke, 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle and the 200-medley relay. Sara qualified for the state open meet in all four years.\n\nIn her senior year, she qualified in the 100-yard backstroke with an All-America time of less than 58 seconds.
