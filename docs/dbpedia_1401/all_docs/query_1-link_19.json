In 1957, the UAMS campus was under construction on the western edge of Little Rock. Along with the hospital and the educational building, a much needed dormitory and student union building was built and opened on July 1, 1959. It was slated to be dedicated later that year. In September, the untimely death of the beloved Dr. Banks stunned and saddened the entire campus. Shortly after his death, students, former students, friends and faculty in unison demanded that the new dormitory and activity center be named in Dr. Banks’ honor. Thus on Nov. 20, 1959, the “Jeff Banks Memorial Student Union” was officially dedicated as a tribute to a man who had but one passion and one family – his students.\n\nRoger C. Bone, M.D.\n\nDr. Bone led a remarkable life as a physician, educator and author. Dr. Bone, who was born in Bald Knob, Ark., in 1941, earned his medical degree from the UAMS College of Medicine and became a professor of medicine and served as chief of the pulmonary and critical care division of University Hospital and at the Central Arkansas Veterans Hospital. In 1984, Dr. Bone left UAMS to become a professor of medicine at Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke’s Medical Center in Chicago and in 1992 was named dean of the Rush Medical College in Chicago. In 1995, he was named a master fellow of the American College of Chest Physicians, becoming the sixth physician in the organization’s 61-year history to receive the honor. He was also a master fellow of the American College of Physicians. Dr. Bone was the recipient of 57 research grants, the author of more than 1,000 articles and the editor of 56 books. In 1993, when he was diagnosed with renal cancer, he continued to teach others by writing his own thoughts on the disease and on the care of terminally ill patients in publications, including the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>, where he penned a column titled “Piece of My Mind” that shared his innermost feelings about the dying process and how to deal with it. Just prior to his death, he established the Roger C. Bone, M.D., Presidential Endowed Chair, committing the interest from the chair’s endowment to the medical center’s Institute for the Education and Study of the Dying Patient.

Bruce, M.D.\n\nDr. Bruce, a native of Mountain Home, Ark., and a 1955 graduate of the UAMS College of Medicine, has served UAMS in several capacities. He returned to his alma mater from the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, where he served as head of the Cardiovascular Section of the Department of Medicine, to become dean of the College of Medicine in 1974. Dr. Bruce quickly garnered high praise from faculty and students alike when he dramatically restructured the governance system of the school. Known as imaginative and articulate, he shared the need to continue to grow the College of Medicine with his predecessor, Winston K. Shorey, M.D. In the early 1970s, when rural communities in the state and the rest of the country were without physicians, Dr. Bruce, along with several others in cooperation the Rockefeller Foundation and other state agencies, set out to reverse this trend. In less than 10 years, Arkansas developed a mature modular health education network – the Area Health Education Centers (AHECs). The AHECs delivered physicians to rural areas but also revealed that the state was one of the more unhealthy places to live in the nation, and placing more doctors in rural communities was not the sole answer.\n\nDr. Bruce left UAMS in 1985 to become program director for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Michigan. Dr. Bruce retired and moved back to Arkansas to help care for his aging parents, but soon “unretired” when Chancellor I. Dodd Wilson, M.D., asked him to head the College of Public Health (COPH) (created as a part of the state’s tobacco settlement) and serve as interim COPH dean. Dr. Bruce continued his quest on behalf of the people of the state of Arkansas as associate dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service. He established a family foundation which has benefited both UAMS and its students.\n\nWilliam M. Burns, M.D.\n\nDr. Burns was admitted to the medical school in 1899, and was licensed to practice in 1899, during a time when county boards reviewed and licensed physicians. In 1912, Dr. Burns moved his practice to North Little Rock and returned to medical school to receive his formal medical degree in 1914, while making house calls at night to support his family. In his medical practice, he delivered more than 8,000 babies, made thousands of house calls, and was said to have walked from house to house during the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, searching for those with the disease. In many cases, he received no compensation other than kind words.\n\nDr. Burns served as member of the School Board of North Little Rock for 37 years. He was instrumental in the placement of North Little Rock High School which resulted in a school that soon became central to the growing city. He served as mayor for two terms, and while in his second term, he completed a water line over the Broadway Bridge that provided the city with a reliable source of purified drinking water. He championed the purchase of 870 acres of surplus government land adjoining Camp Robinson Military Reservation for a large park, against opponents who argued that the land was too far from the city to be used adequately. In 1949, the city of North Little Rock purchased the land for $20,000, and today the park that bears his name, Burns Park, reminds us of his vision for the future. His lasting legacy to us all was the support and vision for a city, school and park that remains today.\n\nGil Campbell, M.D.\n\nDr. Campbell’s extensive experience has entailed numerous leadership positions at various renowned organizations. Dr. Campbell served in the United States Army Medical Corps, where he earned two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart.

Darby, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nDr. Darby significantly increased our knowledge of the human requirements for protein, iron, folic acid and zinc through his career in research. The Galloway, Ark., native’s contributions to the improvement of mankind’s overall health are outstanding as one of that nation’s leading nutrition researchers. He earned his medical degree in 1937 from the UAMS College of Medicine and published his first article on nutrition in 1933, based on research he conducted with Paul L. Day, Ph.D. This research, which included a series of vitamin experiments, led to the discovery of folic acid and brought the university national recognition. Dr. Darby obtained his doctorate from the University of Michigan and joined Vanderbilt University in 1944, with a dual appointment in its Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry. He was appointed chair of the Department of Biochemistry at Vanderbilt in 1949, and served in that capacity until 1971. While at Vanderbilt, Dr. Darby successfully established the first separate identifiable nutrition unit in an American medical school. As a result of his efforts in the field of nutrition, he was elected to membership of the prestigious National Academy of Science and also became president of the Nutrition Foundation.\n\nKatherine “Katie” Dodd, M.D.\n\nDr. Dodd was a much loved and admired professor of pediatrics at the University Medical Center and head of the Pediatrics Department from 1952 to 1957. At a time when few women were in leadership roles, especially in the medical field, Dr. Dodd was indeed a rising star. Dr. Dodd was extremely proud of the accomplishments that her field had delivered in her lifetime. Upon news of her retirement, a self-appointed committee of former students originated the idea for a “Katie Dodd Day.” Speeches, reminiscences, a luncheon and a trip to Winrock Farm on Petit Jean Mountain highlighted the celebration of her 32 years of teaching the next generation of pediatricians. Dr. Dodd wrote almost weekly for”The Medico,” the official student medical school newspaper, while at UAMS. One such article quotes Dr. Dodd as saying”Pediatrics is a unique specialty in many ways. It is the only specialty, except possibly geriatrics, which confines itself to an age group.” Dr. Dodd completed her career as a distinguished professor of Pediatrics, University of Louisville School of Medicine, and as a professor of Pediatrics at Emory University.\n\nW. Thompson Dungan, M.D.\n\nDedicated to the lives of children, Dr. Dungan received his medical degree at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1954 then served as a captain in the United States Air Force and the chief of pediatrics at the United States Air Force Hospital, Elgin Air Force Base, in Florida before coming back to Arkansas.

She served as an assistant professor in pediatrics at UAMS beginning in 1967, was promoted to associate professor in 1971, and then to professor in 1976. In 1987, Dr. Elders was appointed Director of the Arkansas Department of Health by Governor Bill Clinton. Her accomplishments in this position included a ten-fold increase in the number of annual early childhood screenings and almost a doubling of the immunization rate for two-year-olds in Arkansas. Dr. Elders was appointed Surgeon General of the Public Health Service in 1993 by President Clinton. She was the first African-American to serve in the position. In late 1994, after resigning as Surgeon General, she returned to UAMS as a professor of pediatrics.\n\nRobert Harold Fiser Jr., M.D.\n\nA 1966 graduate of the UAMS College of Medicine, Dr. Fiser was the only person in his class to enter into the field of pediatrics. He was inspired by the excitement and challenge of working with children. Dr. Fiser became the youngest pediatric department chairman in the country at the age of 32. With exceptional leadership, determination and vision, Dr. Fiser helped to increase the number of full-time faculty in the Department of Pediatrics from six to 125, representing 16 subspecialties. The combination of his personal interest in the teaching program, along with the new faculty, laid the foundation for the tremendous growth in the size and quality of the pediatric residency program and helped attract more high-caliber residents. Dr. Fiser also helped increase the number of hospital beds from 60 to 263 and boosted the department’s annual budget from $800,000 to $20 million. Perhaps Dr. Fiser’s greatest contribution was the large number of pediatricians trained under his leadership. Many of these individuals entered academic roles throughout the nation. Many more remained in Arkansas, where they revolutionized the care of children in the state. No person in the history of the College of Medicine was more admired by his residents than Dr. Fiser, for he embodied all that was best in a pediatrician. In the late 1970s, Dr. Fiser played a key role in moving the Department of Pediatrics’ base to Arkansas Children’s Hospital. He also contributed to the establishment of the Arkansas Children’s Hospital Research Institute.\n\nIsaac Folsom, M.D.\n\nDr. Folsom was an 1866 graduate of the St. Louis Medical College and was a friend of Edwin Bentley, a founder of the College of Medicine and its third dean. Dr. Folsom, a Lonoke, Ark. native, admired and respected the efforts of Dean Bentley to establish a free clinic. Since he had no heirs to perpetuate his name, on Jan. 30, 1892, he bequeathed a gift of $20,000 that would endow the College of Medicine’s dispensary. His bequest asked in return that the faculty was to mention the endowment in annual announcements and catalogs published and issued by the school and was to include on diplomas issued by the institution that the recipient had attended instructions at the Isaac Folsom Clinic. Later, upon receipt of the money, the school was to erect a substantial and suitable building to be called the “Isaac Folsom Clinic.” Dr. Folsom died in September 1892 but the bequest was not received until after 1905. The “Isaac Folsom Clinic,” located on East Sherman Street, opened in September 1917 at a cost of approximately $55,000. Approximately one-half of the funds needed had been generated by the Folsom bequest.\n\nHenry W. Foster Jr., M.D.\n\nWhile serving as chief of Obstetrics/Gynecology at John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital at Tuskegee University, Dr. Foster initiated a national model for regionalized perinatal health care systems that led to his induction into the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine in 1972. The Pine Bluff, Ark., native earned his medical degree from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1958 and devoted five years as a senior program consultant for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and directed its program to consolidate health services for high risk young people. His involvement with this program inspired him to launch his “I Have A Future” program in 1987 to reduce teen pregnancy, which received recognition from President George Bush in 1991 as one of the nation’s “Thousand Points of Light.” In 1995, Dr. Foster was nominated by President Clinton to become the next United States Surgeon General. He was subsequently appointed as President Clinton’s senior advisor on Teen Pregnancies and Youth Issues and was a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Foster’s exceptional leadership abilities have earned him such awards as the Appreciation Award for Research and Teaching in Sickle Cell Anemia (Tuskegee Institute), the first White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities Faculty Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, and an Honorary Doctor of Science Degree from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1993.\n\nJames H. Growdon, M.D.\n\nIn 1949, a National Cancer Institute grant allowed the establishment of a Department of Oncology at UAMS and the appointment of Dr. Growdon, a graduate of Washington University, as an associate professor and head of the department. Dr. Growdon was promoted to professor and chairman of the Department of Surgery in 1953, a position he held for 13 years. He is credited with planning and establishing the present department during its transition from the former medical school on McAlmont Street to the present UAMS site. He served as chairman of the Arkansas chapter of the American Cancer Society, was a diplomat of the American Board of Surgery, and served as a clinical professor of surgery after his retirement on a voluntary basis. Dr. Growdon received the Distinguished Service award in 1973. Dr. Growdon chaired the much-needed and well-organized continuing education program. He chaired a committee on statewide post-graduate medical education and formally established the CME program at UAMS. Under Dr. Growdon’s direction, the committee coordinated, planned refresher courses sponsored by the various clinical departments, and gained the State Medical Society’s endorsement and financial support.\n\nMasauki Hara, M.D.\n\nThe ground-breaking surgical achievements of Dr. Hara earned him national recognition during his career. The native of San Rafael, Calif., joined UAMS as an instructor of surgery in 1949. He was promoted to professor in 1955 and proceeded to courageously lead the open heart surgery team that conducted the first open heart surgery in Arkansas in 1957, as well as the first bypass operation in 1959. Under Dr. Hara’s guidance, the UAMS College of Medicine kidney transplant team was developed in 1964 and proceeded to perform more than 24 transplants in four years. In 1964, he was presented with the St. Louis City Hospital Alumni Association’s Award for Meritorious Service. Dr. Hara authored over 50 research papers published in various scientific journals. He died in 1968, at the age of 51 after a long illness, one month after the first successful heart transplant surgery in the world. The College of Medicine established the Masauki Hara, M.D., Memorial Lectureship in 1969, in his honor.\n\nJames W. Headstream, M.D.\n\nDr. Headstream, born in Batesville, Ark., received his medical degree from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1939 and joined the faculty as an associate professor of surgery after serving the United States Army for five years. He became head of the Department of Urology in 1950. His leadership abilities and strong determination led to the establishment of a training program in urology that was approved by the American Board of Urology. Under this program, Dr. Headstream trained six residents who went on to obtain board approval. Dr. Headstream resigned as head of the department in 1958 but remained available as needed for several years thereafter. He established a private practice consisting of five urologists called Urology Associates before retiring in 1988. Dr. Headstream’s contributions to the Department of Urology were acknowledged in 1986, when he was honored with the Arkansas Caduceus Club Alumnus Award.\n\nHenry Hollenberg, M.D.\n\nDr. Hollenberg was born in 1902 in Little Rock, Ark. He became a professor in the Department of Surgery at UAMS in 1938, and then joined the United States Army in 1941, before returning to Little Rock to open a private practice. While at UAMS, Dr. Hollenberg performed everything from thyroid and gallstone removal surgeries to brain surgery. He also served as chief of staff at St. Vincent Infirmary Medicine Center (now John L. McClellan Medical Center) and was a driving force behind the establishment of Arkansas Children’s Hospital. He was awarded the American College of Surgeons membership and passed the first examination ever held by the American Board of Surgery in New York and Philadelphia. Dr. Hollenberg’s ground-breaking work with penicillin led to the discovery that the antibiotic cured chronic cases of syphilis and gonorrhea. Consequently, he was honored with the Legion of Merit Award and gained membership to the American Surgical Association. Dr. Hollenberg remained active in the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Surgery in several capacities until he retired in 1978.\n\nP.O. Hooper, M.D.\n\nDr. Hooper was the College of Medicine’s founder and first dean. Born in Arkansas in 1833, Dr. Hooper graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and became a noted politician and the leader of Arkansas’ first medical associations. In May 1879, Dr. Hooper wrote to the president of the Arkansas Industrial University (University of Arkansas at Fayetteville) regarding the establishment of a medical department under the school’s charter. The trustees voted and granted the establishment of a medical department in Little Rock on June 17, 1879. Dr. Hooper was designated as principal of the department and president of the faculty. By July of that year, a faculty had been selected; the school was incorporated under the laws of the day with eight proprietors, each holding 25 shares valued at $25 each; and $5,000 was borrowed to purchase the building formerly occupied by the Sperindio Hotel at 113 West Second Street. Thus the College of Medicine was born. Dr. Hooper’s tireless efforts as a physician, teacher, entrepreneur, mentor and leader created the College of Medicine.\n\nEdith Irby Jones, M.D.\n\nDr. Irby-Jones became a national role model when she became the first African-American student enrolled in what had previously been a segregated medical school. The Conway, Ark., native received money to go to medical school from members of a Hot Springs Church who told her that if she needed more money, to see Daisy Bates, the editor of the African-American newspaper in Little Rock. Dr. Jones did need additional funds so she approached Bates, who provided her the money from her “coffee can bank.” Dr. Jones, as the only African-American in the medical school, was given her own bathroom and a special table in the library where she ate meals. However, she rarely dined alone as many of the students chose to join her. She earned her medical degree from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1952.\n\nIn 1985, she was elected as the first woman president of the National Medical Association. She was also the only female founding member of the Association of Black Cardiologists and the first black female chairman of the Board of Trustees for Knoxville University. The internationally renowned physician taught and consulted in medicine and health care in many countries and has had clinics established in her name in Haiti and Mexico. She was also a charter member of the Physicians for Human Rights organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998. Dr. Jones served for over 50 years as a practicing internist and gerontologist in the Third Ward community of Houston. She was also a clinical assistant professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Texas, Houston. She served as medical director for Universal HealthPlan of Texas, Prospect Medical Laboratory and medical consultant for the Social Security Administration, Texas Public Welfare Department, Texas Rehabilitation Commission and the Vocational Rehabilitation Association. Her achievements in the field of medicine are limitless.\n\nMollie King, M.D.\n\nDr. King became a member of the Pathology Department in 1917 and was the first full-time female faculty member at UAMS. Dr. King was an active researcher who worked with the energetic Joseph D. Aronson, head of the Department of Pathology and Bacteriology. They investigated such problems as the toxicity of cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking, the actions of drugs on the vagus center of the medulla, and the bifurcation of the seventh cranial nerve long before others considered research in these fields. She accepted a position in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in 1920, and later practiced in Union City, Indiana. She was a member of the American Medical Association and the Association of Anesthetists of both the United States and Canada – joining some of the first females in these prestigious medical organizations.\n\nSamuel L. Kountz, M.D.\n\nDr. Kountz was one of the first African-American graduates of the UAMS College of Medicine. A native of rural Lexa, Ark., Dr. Kountz did not qualify for admission initially to Arkansas AM&N College (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff). However, at the urging of the college president, Dr. Lawrence Davis, Sr., he enrolled in additional courses, was admitted and subsequently graduated. He earned a master’s degree in chemistry from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and was a 1958 graduate of the UAMS College of Medicine. His research focused on transplants and immunology and contributed to advances in controlling tissue rejection in kidney patients. While at the University of California at San Francisco, he worked with a team to develop the prototype of a machine that preserved a kidney for 50 hours after its removal from a donor and developed techniques that aid the ability to predict when rejection of a transplanted organ begins, thus providing for more dosage control. He served as head of surgery at State University of New York at Downstate in Brooklyn, New York. In 1973 he was awarded an honorary Juris Doctorate from the University of Arkansas.\n\nWhen Dr. Kountz accepted the position at Downstate Medical Center, he told friends he wanted to improve medical care in the African-American community and help to heighten the public awareness regarding the need for organ donations. He was among the world’s leading kidney transplant surgeons and a true medical pioneer, who performed over 500 kidney transplants at a time when this procedure was limited to only a few institutions. Dr. Kountz’s many outstanding contributions and accomplishments remain an important legacy.\n\nBetty A. Lowe, M.D.\n\nDr. Lowe graduated first in the class of 1956 from the College of Medicine. Dr. Lowe served UAMS, Arkansas Children’s Hospital, and the state of Arkansas with distinction as an outstanding clinician teacher and advocate for children’s health. She was in private practice in Texarkana from 1960 to 1975, and returned to UAMS and ACH for the duration of her career. She retired with distinction in 2001, after serving 29 years at UAMS. She received numerous awards including the UAMS Golden Apple, the Distinguished Faculty Award presented annually by the Arkansas Caduceus Club, and the UAMS/ACH Distinguished Award. She held the Harvey and Bernice Jones Distinguished Chair in Pediatrics from 1996 to 2001.\n\nDr. Lowe touched many lives over the years and is fondly remembered by medical students, residents, colleagues, and families throughout the state and region for her thorough, straightforward, and no-nonsense approach to the practice of pediatrics. She was deeply involved in shaping the face of pediatrics in America through her strong and tireless advocacy for children’s health. Her most prominent role was her service as president of the prestigious American Academy of Pediatrics. Closest to her heart were her own patients and the children of Arkansas. She earned the devoted respect of former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and served as their daughter Chelsea’s pediatrician for 12 years. She worked closely with them during their years in the Governor’s Mansion and the White House. Dr. Lowe continued to advocate for children’s health and to serve in many civic and community roles after her retirement. She died in 2013.\n\nRaymond Miller, M.D.\n\nDr. Miller, born in Cotton Plant, Ark., began college at Arkansas AM&N (now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff ) to study agriculture in 1956. He changed his major to pre-medicine during his sophomore year and went on to graduate at AM&amp;N. He obtained his medical degree at UAMS in 1963 and served his internship and residency in internal medicine, as well as a fellowship in pulmonary disease, at UAMS. He was then called on by the United States Army to serve at the Pulmonary Disease Service at Walter Reed General Hospital for two years. Dr. Miller returned to Little Rock in 1970, and established the Little Rock Internal Medicine Clinic, the state’s first racially integrated medical practice. Two years later, his outstanding reputation led to his appointment as the first African-American to serve on the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, where he served for 10 years, including a term as chairman from 1981 to 1982.\n\nHe was also involved with the boards of Boatmen’s Bank of Arkansas, Entergy Corporation and the Razorback Foundation. Dr. Miller became active with the athletic programs at the University of Arkansas to boost minority enrollment and participation. The Razorback Foundation recognized his efforts in 1995 with the Distinguished Service Award, which included a $100,000 scholarship endowed in his name. Dr. Miller received the National Humanitarian Award at the National Conference of Community and Justice for the Arkansas region in May 2004. He later served as staff emeritus at the St. Vincent Infirmary Medical Center and trustee emeritus of the University of Arkansas System Board of Trustees. Dr. Miller died in 2005.\n\nHayden C. Nicholson, M.D.\n\nDr. Nicholson, a native of Michigan, arrived at a pivotal time in the history of the College of Medicine and assumed the combined duties of both vice president and dean of the College of Medicine in 1950. His experience and personal characteristics made him a perfect dean for the College of Medicine that at this point in time was dependent entirely upon the good will of the citizens of Arkansas and the state medical profession. He and University of Arkansas President Lewis Webster Jones requested that the General Assembly add the final funding to construct the new medical center located on West Markham Street. Thus the dream of many for a modern medical center became a reality. Dr. Nicholson was witty, persuasive, confident and amiable; he worked tirelessly with the press, the Legislature, physicians and the Arkansas Medical Society to ensure the taxpayers of the state that their tax dollars were spent wisely and that the public’s expectations of the institution were met. Dr. Nicholson served as dean of the College of Medicine and provost of the Medical Center from 1950 to 1955.\n\nPhillip L. Rayford, Ph.D.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Army, Dr. Rayford wanted to become a physician but medical schools were not open to African-Americans at that time. Thus began Dr. Rayford’s struggle to become one of the top scientists in the world. He studied at Howard and American Universities, both in Washington, D.C., and received a master’s degree in zoology from the University of Maryland in College Park. During this time, Dr. Rayford conducted cancer research with several prominent researchers at the National Institutes of Health. He spent the next two-and-a-half years in Accra, Ghana, helping the U.S. State Department set up a much-needed medical school for West Africans. He came to UAMS in 1980, and began an 18-year tenure as chairman of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics as well as associate dean for minority affairs. Under his chairmanship, the Department of Physiology and Biophysics significantly increased extramural grant support for research, saw increased faculty recruitment, and was awarded six doctoral degrees. UAMS awarded two of those doctorates to African-Americans – a first at UAMS – and Dr. Rayford played a pivotal role in this achievement. He served as a counselor, role model and friend to all minority medical and graduate students.\n\nWilliam G. Reese, M.D.\n\nDr. Reese came to the UAMS College of Medicine to develop the Department of Psychiatry in 1951. He was professor and chairman of psychiatry at the UAMS College of Medicine and served twice as chief of staff of the University Hospital. He retired in 1987, as the Marie Wilson Howells Professor and Chairman, Emeritus. During his tenure, Dr. Reese founded the Arkansas Psychiatric Society and received the Society’s Meritorious Service Award. He was a charter member of the American College of Psychiatrists and received numerous awards, including the Arkansas Caduceus Club’s Distinguished Faculty Award in 1974, and an honorary degree (D.Sc.) in 1990. An annual “Reese Award” was established in his honor in 1987 to recognize psychiatry residents for scholarship and research. Noted for his wit and anticipating an eventual obituary, Dr. Reese stated, “This is a hard way to get newspaper publicity, but I won’t complain about any errors in the account.”\n\nWinston K. Shorey, M.D.\n\nAt 42 years of age, Dr. Shorey was selected by a search committee to become the dean of the UAMS College of Medicine in 1961. A native of Vermont, he was known for his even temper, decisive actions, thoughtfulness and sense of humor. His willingness to entertain new ideas in curricula and programs made him an effective leader and earned him the respect of his colleagues. In short, Dean Shorey possessed the traits of character that provided vibrant leadership during a decade of growth that saw the College of Medicine rise to serve the citizens of Arkansas.\n\nThe most obvious growth was in the size of the student body at the College of Medicine. With both Arkansas and the nation deficient in physicians, (in 1960, the state had one physician for every 1,041 residents) the legislature mandated that the 1961 class size increase by 12 more than the previous year, and that all entering freshmen were required to be Arkansas residents. Dr. Shorey recognized that the growth rate did not immediately translate into new physicians, but rather forced the College to admit students who were inadequately prepared. Dr. Shorey enlisted the support of his colleagues and both medical societies to launch a successful campaign that resulted in a new law that permitted the admission of non-residents of up to 15 percent of the total freshman class. Dr. Shorey also played a prominent role in the planning and implementation of programs that were designed to improve the state’s health delivery system, most notably the family practice residency program and the Area Health Education Centers (AHECs). Dr. Shorey assumed directorship of the AHEC program until his untimely death in 1976. In 1981, the Education Building One was renamed in his honor.\n\nH. Elvin Shuffield, M.D.\n\nDr. Shuffield, born in Nashville, Tenn., attended Georgia Military Academy and Little Rock Junior College before graduating from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1944. He served his internship and one-year residency at Arkansas Baptist Hospital and served in the Army Medical Corps for 15 months. In 1947, he joined his father in private practice, specializing in orthopaedic surgery and traumatic surgery. Dr. Shuffield was extensively involved with the Arkansas Medical Society, serving as secretary of the society, chairman of the society’s Legislative Committee and as chairman of the society’s Committee on Veteran’s Administration Affairs. Dr. Shuffield lobbied for the legislation that resulted in the establishment of regulations on training physician assistants, and he testified about the importance of having a law to allow persons to donate vital organs after death. He was the secretary of the medical staff at Arkansas Baptist Hospital and in 1957, served as the chief of staff at the Baptist Medical Center. Dr. Shuffield was also the vice president of the Arkansas Medical Board and was advanced to the rank of fellow in the International College of Surgeons in orthopaedic surgery in 1977. Dr. Shuffield was honored in 1981, with the UAMS Distinguished Service Award and was named honorary past president of the Arkansas Medical Society in 1984.\n\nMorgan Smith, M.D.\n\nDr. Smith was born in El Dorado in 1868 and was an 1889 graduate of the University of Arkansas Medical Department. He practiced medicine in his home town until 1903, when he entered Tulane University as a special student. He received his second medical degree the following year, moved to Little Rock and joined the faculty of the Medical Department. He served as dean from 1912 to 1923, and 1924 to 1927. Dr. Smith wrote a health code that in 1913 was embodied in the law creating the State Board of Health. Dr. Smith also drafted the 1907 amendment to the Medical Practice Act that required graduation from a recognized medical school as a prerequisite to examination by the state licensing boards.\n\nDr. Smith was active in civic arenas and served three terms in the Arkansas House. He worked diligently to improve the college’s facilities and gained the Old State House for the medical school. He worked tirelessly to obtain funds from the legislature to build and address the school’s clinical needs. He attained the “A” rating for the school that propelled the institution into full accreditation. In an effort to solve the clinical needs while construction on a new hospital ceased, Dr. Smith obtained a clinical working agreement with Baptist, St. Vincent and St. Luke’s, in order to resume a four-year medical program. Dean Smith resigned in 1923, rather than support the lower entrance standards being promoted as an effort to create more physicians for rural Arkansas. He was reappointed to the position, however, in 1924, and served until 1927.\n\nEugene J. Towbin, M.D.\n\nFor over 41 years, Dr. Towbin was a distinguished faculty member at UAMS and the Central Arkansas Veterans’ Healthcare System, where he served as associate chief of staff for Research and Education beginning in 1960, and chief of staff in 1968. Under his leadership the VA Hospital – College of Medicine program was launched and blossomed. Anticipating the needs of an aging population, Dr. Towbin developed a model system of geriatrics and long term care and established the first Veterans Health Administration Geriatric Research Education Clinical Center. His vision and efforts culminated in the building of the John L. McClellan Memorial Veterans’ Hospital in Little Rock and a new 1,000-bed facility in North Little Rock. He received numerous awards during his career, including the Distinguished Service Award from the College of Medicine, the Abernathy Award of Excellence in Internal Medicine, and the Exceptional Service Award from the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was a Fellow of both the American College of Physicians and the Gerontological Society of America. In 1985, Dr. Towbin received the William F. Rector Award for Distinguished Civic Achievement and in 1988, an honorary doctor of science from UAMS. Dr. Towbin developed one of the strongest veterans health care systems in the nation.\n\nTom Ed Townsend, M.D.\n\nDr. Townsend, a native of Willow, Ark., received his medical degree from the UAMS College of Medicine in 1950. Dr. Townsend established his private practice children’s clinic in Pine Bluff. He served as chief of staff at Jefferson Regional Medical Center, president of Jefferson County Medical Society, chairman of the Council of the Arkansas Medical Society, president of the Arkansas Medical Society, delegate to the American Medical Association, diplomat of the American Board of Pediatrics, and fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Dr. Townsend also served as clinical professor of Pediatrics at UAMS and Arkansas Children’s Hospital. He received the Distinguished Alumni Award presented by the Arkansas Caduceus Club in 1990. Dr. Townsend was known for his love and care of children, enthusiasm, diligence, wit, intelligence and wisdom. Dr. Townsend taught many medical students in senior rotations, and all but one has chosen pediatrics as their specialty. He died in 2013.\n\nFrank Vinsonhaler, M.D.\n\nDr. Vinsonhaler was an 1885 graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Dr. Vinsonhaler trained initially as a general practitioner but in 1891, went to Europe, studied ophthalmology and returned to Little Rock to establish an ophthalmology practice. Dr. Vinsonhaler was appointed dean of the College of Medicine at the age of 63 in 1927 and served until 1939, a period of difficult and unfortunate economic and political times. Dr. Vinsonhaler’s principal goal as dean was to ensure the school’s accreditation by the American Medical Association, the evaluating body for medical schools. Determined to solve the problems that threatened the institution’s academic standing, he set out on the mission to secure funds to build a medical school. Dr. Vinsonhaler remained steadfast in his vision and in 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Public Works Administration (PWA), he immediately began work to obtain PWA funds. He delivered the much needed funds through his persistent lobbying efforts and the personal interest of Arkansas Senator Joe T. Robinson. In 1935, the University of Arkansas Medical School on McAlmont Street towered six stories high and housed a student body of 300. The building is still in use today as the University of Arkansas School of Law. Dr. Vinsonhaler truly helped lay the foundation of learning for the College of Medicine.\n\nHarry P. Ward, M.D.\n\nA man of determination, compassion, and commitment, Dr. Ward was selected to serve as Chancellor and to lead UAMS into its second century as UAMS celebrated its centennial year in 1979. The “Ward Decades,” as they are called, saw remarkable growth in student enrollment and facilitated the growth of external research dollars to increase 20-fold in 20 years. Under his leadership, the physical size of UAMS increased five-fold, including the expansion of the hospital that bears his name, Ward Tower. UAMS rose through the ranks to become one of the state’s largest employers during these decades. More than $200 million in major construction projects were completed, due in no small part to his ability to interest the private sector in philanthropic giving.\n\nThe UAMS Area Health Education Centers (now known as Regional Centers) expanded their programs, and an extensive interactive television network was created that delivered courses throughout Arkansas. Dr. Ward coined the phrase that “UAMS is a university without walls.” He restructured the hospital administration and began an active renovation program. During his tenure Dr. Ward would shepherd the opening of the Ambulatory Care Center, the hospital gift shop, the Center of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, the Family Medical Center, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging building, the Arkansas Cancer Research Center, the Biomedical Research Center, Education Buildings II and III, the Harvey and Bernice Jones Eye Institute, and the Donald W. Reynolds Center on Aging. He worked diligently to increase the number of endowed chairs and helped to establish the Double Helix society to honor major donors. UAMS evolved from a local center to a nationally and internationally recognized academic health center during the 21 years with Ward at the helm.\n\nRobert C. Watson, M.D.\n\nDr. Watson was just a teenager in Mena, Ark., working in the local drugstore when he discovered he wanted to become a physician. He passed on to many students and friends his remembrance of bandaging cut fingers and how much he enjoyed this simple task. Upon graduation from the UAMS College of Medicine, he had not decided which specialty he would pursue, but that changed while he cared for a young girl with a brain injury during his internship at Detroit City Hospital. He furthered his training in Brooklyn, N.Y., at King’s County Hospital, where his fascination with the brain grew. In 1944, he became the 108th physician to receive accreditation from the American Board of Neurological Society. Dr. Watson returned to Arkansas to practice neurosurgery and began a 27-year volunteer career as a teacher educating young physicians about diagnosing neurological cases. His accomplishments also included serving as chief of staff of Baptist Medical Center, president of both the Arkansas and the Pulaski County Medical Societies, and president and founder of the Southern Neurosurgical Society that was later renamed in his honor."
