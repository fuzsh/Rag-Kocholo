        "text": "Each week, Nevada Sports Net’s Chris Murray will rank the Mountain West football teams. Here are this week’s rankings, with each team’s overall record, its ranking last week, its result last week, its next opponent and a brief comment. This feature is presented in partnership with .\n\n1. Boise State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: at No. 10 Washington, 12:30 p.m. (ABC)\n\nComment: The Broncos open the season as our team to beat after going undefeated in MW play last year before losing to Fresno State in the conference title game. I see a clear gap between Boise State and the rest of the MW this season, so we’ll see if the Broncos can claim MW title No. 5. That goal starts on the road at No. 10 Washington, one of the most difficult games any MW team will play in 2023.\n\n2. Air Force\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: vs. Robert Morris, 10 a.m.\n\nComment: Air Force eases into the season against FCS opponent Robert Morris, which went 0-11 last year and has gone winless in two of the last three seasons if we include the truncated 2020 campaign. The Falcons must replace offensive stalwarts QB Haaziq Daniels and RB Brad Roberts, who led the nation in rushing in 2022. But this team should remain elite on defense and always figures it out on offense.\n\n3. Fresno State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: at Purdue, 9 a.m. (Big Ten Network)\n\nComment: The Bulldogs have a winnable power-conference game out of the gates when it plays at Purdue as a 3.5-point underdog. The Boilermakers have a new coach in Ryan Walters, who is making his head-coaching debut at age 37. For Fresno State, UCF transfer Mikey Keene was named the team’s starting quarterback, and he has big shoes to fill replacing current NFL gunslinger Jake Haener.\n\n4. San Diego State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nLast week: Beat Ohio, 20-13\n\nThis week: vs. Idaho State, 7:30 p.m. (CBSSN)\n\nComment: San Diego State was stout on defense in its season-opening 20-13 win over Ohio in Week 0. The Aztecs forced three turnovers and got two passing touchdowns from QB Jalen Mayden to TE Mark Redman. Mayden also accidentally threw the ball into the face off a referee. SDSU gets an easier task this week when it hosts FCS school Idaho State, which has gone 1-10 in each of the last two seasons.\n\n5. Wyoming\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: vs. Texas Tech, 4:30 p.m. (CBS)\n\nComment: Wyoming is one of four MW teams hosting a Power 5 opponent this week with the Cowboys being a 14.5-point underdog against Texas Tech. Wyoming last hosted a power-conference team in 2019 when it upset Missouri, 37-31, in its season opener. Texas Tech is coming off an 8-5 season in which it scored 34.2 points per game, so Wyoming’s stout defense will be tested early on.\n\n6. Colorado State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: vs. Washington State, 4 p.m. (CBSSN)\n\nComment: Colorado State also hosts a power-conference team in Week 1 as it plays a Washington State squad it lost to 38-7 on the road last season (could these teams be conference-mates soon?). The Rams’ big challenge this season is getting their offense on track after the team scored just 13.2 ppg last season, third fewest in the nation. Colorado State was held below 20 points in all 12 of its games in 2022.\n\n7. San Jose State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-1\n\nLast week: Lost to USC, 56-28\n\nThis week: vs. No. 18 Oregon State, 12:30 p.m. Sunday (CBS)\n\nComment: This is our third straight MW team that will host a Power 5 opponent in Week 1 (and second straight against a potential future MW member). San Jose State’s offense was good in a Week 0 loss to USC as the Spartans threw for 198 yards and three touchdowns; ran for 198 yards and a score; and had 24 first downs and zero turnovers. That will win you a lot of games. Just not against USC’s elite offense.\n\n8. Nevada\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: at No. 6 USC, 3:30 p.m. (Pac-12 Network)\n\nComment: The Wolf Pack was one of two winless teams in MW play last year, so this is an optimistic ranking to start the season. We might not get a great gauge on Nevada after its season opener considering the game is against No. 6 USC, with Nevada being a program-record 38-point underdog. But it’s worth watching the offensive production after MW cohort SJSU moved the ball fine on the Trojans.\n\n9. Hawaii\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-1\n\nLast week: Lost to Vanderbilt, 35-28\n\nThis week: vs. Stanford, 8 p.m. Friday (CBSSN)\n\nComment: Hawaii nearly rallied to beat Vanderbilt on the road last week. The seven-point loss was more competitive than last year’s season opener, a 53-point home loss to the Commodores. This week, Hawaii hosts the Pac-12’s Stanford as a 3.5-point underdog. The MW needs to win some of these home games against power-conference competition after going 1-16 against the Power 5 in last year’s regular season.\n\n10. Utah State\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: at No. 25 Iowa, 9 a.m. (FS1)\n\nComment: Utah State is one of five MW teams playing a ranked opponent in Week 1 as it takes on Iowa, which should be helmed by Damonte Ranch High QB Cade McNamara, who’s questionable as he recovers from offseason knee surgery. From Utah State’s perspective, quarterback play will be big after the Aggies threw 21 interceptions last season (against 18 touchdowns). Utah State has 59 newcomers.\n\n11. UNLV\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: vs. Bryant, 1 p.m.\n\nComment: UNLV is one of three MW teams playing an FCS opponent this week, doing so in Barry Odom’s debut as the Rebels’ head coach. Bryant went 4-7 last season, but two defeats came in overtime and five were by one score. This is a mid-grade Big South-Ohio Valley team UNLV should roll at home before stepping way up in competition level next week when it plays Michigan at the Big House.\n\n12. New Mexico\n\nRank last week: N/A\n\nRecord: 0-0\n\nLast week: Did not play\n\nThis week: at No. 23 Texas A&M, 4 p.m. (ESPN)\n\nComment: New Mexico enters a crucial season for head coach Danny Gonzales, who is 7-24 in three years leading the Lobos. New Mexico is one of nine MW teams playing a power-conference school this week and is tied for the biggest underdog at 38 points with a total of 49, so Vegas has the Lobos scoring 5.5 points. Offense will be key this year for New Mexico, which has posted 12.7 ppg the last two seasons.\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
