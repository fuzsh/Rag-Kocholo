        "text": "The Charter Award Dinner is a hallmark event of St. Francis College that spans over decades This esteemed gathering pays homage to our founding values and celebrates the exceptional achievements of our distinguished honorees. Rooted in tradition yet forward-looking, the Charter Award Dinner serves as a testament to our enduring commitment to excellence in education and Franciscan service.\n\nAt the heart of this event lies the spirit of our Franciscan brothers, whose vision continues to guide us in shaping future generations of leaders. As we gather to honor outstanding individuals who embody the values of compassion, integrity, and service, each year we invite you to join us in celebrating the enduring legacy of the Charter Award Dinner.\n\nThanks to the unwavering support of our incredible community, the 2024 Charter Award Dinner was celebrated on May 2, 2024 at Gargiulo's in Coney Island. The event raised over $300,000 in support of our students through the Franciscan Brothers Fund. The event was a testament to our collective dedication to make a difference in the lives of students. Thank you for being part of a special night celebrating the Best of Brooklyn: Randy Peers, President & CEO of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, and the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn.\n\nWe hope you can look back on the evening and be reminded of the wonderful memories we have created together. We hope you enjoy the photo album here."
