First up, Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar — and the hearts of American audiences — as restless European princess Ann, who escapes her stifling duties for a bit of adventure in Roman Holiday (1953). When a comic mishap lands Ann in the company of American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), excitement and romance await. Peck himself was so taken with Hepburn’s performance that he insisted her name join his above the title in the film’s PR materials. Next, just before she became the real-life princess of Monaco, The Swan (1956) saw Grace Kelly play exiled Princess Alexandra, whose domineering mother presses her to marry Prince Albert (Sir Alec Guinness) and restore their noble status. But Alexandra’s heart may already be claimed. Pre-Code musical The Love Parade (1929) stars Jeanette MacDonald in her film debut as Queen Louise of Sylvania and Maurice Chevalier as rapscallion Count Alfred, who by turns charms and challenges his queen. Adapted from the 1924 operetta of the same name, The Student Prince (1954) sees stodgy Prince Karl (Edmund Purdom) of the small German kingdom Karlsburg shipped off to university to learn a more charming — and wife-winning — manner. But the plan backfires when young Karl discovers he enjoys student life over royal life and becomes smitten with winsome barmaid Kathie (Ann Blyth). Next up, Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945) stars Hedy Lamarr as lovelorn widow Princess Veronica who travels to New York City to track down Paul MacMillan (Warner Anderson), the handsome American writer who captured her heart years before. Will a series of madcap events involving the hotel’s goodhearted if misguided bellboy lead to royal heartbreak — or a pair of storybook romances?

To celebrate the centennial of this icon, Turner Classic Movies has made her its December Star of the Month. Each Thursday night (except Dec. 22, which falls during TCM’s weeklong marathon of Christmas movies), the network will feature several of Gardner’s films, ranging from her early appearances and breakout roles in the 1940s to her heyday as a box office star in the ’50s and more. Tonight’s initial lineup, which continues well into tomorrow morning, fittingly begins with The Killers (1946). This film noir finally gained Gardner notice after years of bit parts. She gives a memorably sultry performance as femme fatale Kitty Collins, who draws an ex-boxer (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) into the criminal underworld. Following that are three other late 1940s films that continued to propel the actress to stardom: The Hucksters (1947), a drama led by Clark Gable and Deborah Kerr in her American film debut; The Bribe (1949), a film noir also starring Robert Taylor, Charles Laughton and Vincent Price; and East Side, West Side (1949), director Mervyn LeRoy’s crime drama that also features Barbara Stanwyck and James Mason. The remaining five films are from the early to mid ’40s, with Gardner in pre-fame bit parts: We Were Dancing (1942), a Norma Shearer-led romantic comedy that included one of Gardner’s earliest appearances in a feature film, an uncredited walk-on; Ghosts on the Loose (1943), a comedy/horror entry in the East Side Kids franchise that finally gave Gardner her first screen billing; Maisie Goes to Reno (1944), the eighth film in the Maisie Ravier series of comedy/dramas with Ann Sothern as the title character; Three Men in White, a 1944 entry in the Dr. Kildare series; and the comedy She Went to the Races (1945).\n\nLuxe for Less\n\nHGTV, 9pm\n\nNew Series!\n\nPeople are always looking for ways to have high-end design, all while protecting their pocketbooks.
