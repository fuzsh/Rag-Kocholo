        "text": "I tried watching this for the first time on Thursday and couldn't get through even the first third of it. Rex Harrison pompous as usual; bony Audrey Hepburn thrashing around and yowling in bad fake Cockney.\n\nThis picture was well received when released and still admired today, so I can only conclude my judgment is off.\n\nWhat do DLers think of this movie?\n\nOP, my recommendation would be never to put up a poll for something like this if you weren't genuinely interested in other people's opinions that differed from your own. Just state your opinion and let people respond without a poll. No one likes \"whimsical\" polls that are meant just to reinforce the OP's own particular opinion.\n\nIt's generally understood now that the head of Warner Brothers really miscalculated by not letting Julie Andrews star in this, since she proved in the same year with \"Mary Poppins\" that she had box office charisma and was considered lovable by film audiences. Audrey Hepburn is lovely after the transformation, but as Pauline kael pointed out she's just completely unconvincing before then as a guttersnipe, and because Marnie Nixon's voice is so impersonal dubbed over her. And, as Kael pointed out, Harrison let almost all the surprise fall out of his performance since he had performed it too often on stage. but it's worth seeing because of the lavish period recreations, and the beautiful costumes (especially the famous black, white, and grey ones for the Ascot sequence), and because it's generally agreed MFL is one of a handful of the very greatest scores from the Golden Age of the Broadway musical\n\nThe best Higgins I've ever seen was Leslie Howard in the 1930s \"Pygmalion\". He was fortyish and quite handsome, and he was the only actor I've ever seen in the role who didn't ham it up and yell! He wasn't the huge character some actors try to make him, Howard's Higgins was just this bright, obnoxious, intelligent, subtly sexy man who had no filter, because he didn't see why he'd want one.\n\nAnd as such, you can believe that a real human woman like Wendy Hiller's Eliza might be genuinely attracted to him!\n\nNot so with Rex Harrison. Oh, NOT so! He's sixty or looks it, and he hams the hell out of it all.\n\nI love MFL -- think it's one of the best musicals from Hollywood ever. Hepburn was a beautiful Eliza, and that mattered more than being a believable flower girl. She actually did do her own singing, and no one told her until much later that she was going to be dubbed. Harrison is indeed too old for the part and they had to write songs for him (in the original) that didn't require much of a voice. He doesn't have one.\n\nAndrews would have made a more convincing flower girl but the transformation into a beautiful object of Freddy's desire -- no, she couldn't have pulled that off, she's just not a very attractive woman. A great actress and singer, yes. Beauty? No.\n\nMFL's strong suit is the production values; the beautiful sets, costumes and photography -- which are larger than life but don't overwhelm the action like Hello Dolly's do. The look of the film is very stylized and stagey, but yet it doesn't feel stage bound.\n\nPeriod films always have a good deal of contemporary style in the costumes and especially the hair and make-up of the female leads, since they wanted the original audience to see the stars as currently attractive. What I like about MFL is how heavily and knowingly the production design leans into this -- it's not an Edwardian piece that has 60's style around the edges by unwitting osmosis - it is very much a High 60's take on the Edwardian era; which again contributes to the film's stagey storybook-confection appeal.\n\nIt's a hit=and-miss movie for me. I love Audrey but the Marni Nixon vocals take me out of the movie. Rex Harrison is fantastic in his arrogance and I'm glad his iconic performance was captured on film. He's not supposed to be a lovable character and there isn't supposed to be more than a hint of romance between the two of them. Not even a hint really, just an \"I grew accustomed to her face\" thing so those who say he's too old for her, yes well, he's not her beau.\n\nBut the movie doesn't really find a dramatic climax and that's my problem with it. The climax should probably be the ball when she transforms spectacularly into a divine presence that seduces everyone. But the movie doesn't stay on her enough during the ball and the whole thing plays flatter than it should, and then we go back to Higgins' house and so on. It could have been so much better but it's still pretty damn good.\n\nOne of my favorite films. A beauty. Magnificent production design which the actors fill with their presence. I think the Hiller Howard film is a bore They're just marking.\n\nThe climax of Eliza's transformation is when she appears at the top of the stairs in the ball gown. And I don't know if it was Moss Hart or George Cukor but when Higgin leaves to go to the ball and Eliza stands there not moving and Higgins goes back to take her arm is brilliant. A surprising and very moving end to the first half. Andre Previn 's conducting of that glorious score helps enormously. And the tea party scene in MFL is hilarious where in the original film it goes for nothing. Though I could as well do without Rex putting the teacup on his hat which I'm sure on stage got a huge roar.\n\nR76 Something is not quite right about your history because Gigi was made in 1957-58 and MFL was released in 1964. Maybe the bidding for the rights was in the 50s but they couldn’t make the film until the show had finished its run?\n\nAnyhow, Vincente Minnelli was in the running to direct this Jack Warner production we’re talking about - he was first choice. But from what I’ve read, his wife at the time was negotiating for him and wanted a certain amount of money and it dragged on so long Warner finally hired George Cukor. Who was willing to work for less than Minnelli was asking.\n\nWhen he was later asked what he would have done differently had he directed it he said something like “It would have had more color, for one thing.” I really like this comment because Cukor was not a lover of using a lot of color and would even tell cinematographers not to add color gels, saying “The sets are well painted, we don’t need more color.”\n\nI think this movie is not very visually interesting or very colorful, particularly for a musical. There’s a lot of gray, a lot of brown, taupe, and avocado green. And just a lot of neutral color in general. So that when the black and white Ascot sequence happens, it’s not that big a change.\n\nr83: I was mistaken iin believing that the film rights toi MY FAIR LADY were sold after the show opened on Broadway in 1956. Broadway cast albums were huge business when “My Fair Lady” opened, so CBS, through its Columbia Records division, financed the play just so they could put out the cast album. Later, when Warner Bros. Pictures co-founder Jack Warner wanted the movie rights, he paid a then record $5.5 million in 1962 plus 47 ¼% of the gross over $20 million. And all rights to the movie went back to CBS after a mere 7 years.\n\nThe budget for the film was the highest in Hollywood history - $17 million.\n\nBy that reasoning, it appears that MGM was unable to secure the rigthts after the Broadway musical opened in 1956 and made GIGI as an 'answer' to it (and just maybe an unofficial advertisement to show CBS what MGM could do with a similar story and composer and lyricist)\n\nR84 I don’t think Minnelli said strong color. he said more color. But you’d have to argue with him, not me. I always found the film dull-looking. Minnelli was adept at using color but not to the point of garishness (Gigi is a great example of it). I haven’t seen My Fair Lady for a while but I remember Get me To The Church On Time being mostly blacks and browns, and On The Street Where You Live being mostly grays and neutral colors. Cukor always used the “color consultant” George Hoyningen-Huene on his films probably because he had no particular eye for color or design, unlike Minnelli who had done sets, costumes, window dressing and other visual jobs before becoming a director.\n\n[quote] It IS very stagey. In that the camera keeps its distance, there are many shots of all the characters standing around together, comparatively few closeups, and hardly any close closeups. AND the actors are projecting their voices like stage actors throughout, which is offputting.\n\nI think it was deliberately stagey and I'm glad it was. Everything was shot in the studio, with no exteriors, which kept it purposely close to the stage play. I wish they did this more often with musicals when they are adapted for the screen. They frequently ruin them by opening them up and letting the visuals overwhelm the story, like in Into the Woods.\n\nThere are no close-ups because they filmed it with the intention to have almost everyone see it in a theater on a giant screen in Super Panavision 70mm. In those days they didn't frame theatrical films for the small television screen which they started doing in the 70's. That's why old widescreen films use relatively few close-ups and are more epic looking.\n\nAndrews's reign at the top of the box office was extremely brief. She had massive hits with \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Mary Poppins\", and then... didn't follow them with more massive hits. And just as she was having some box-office disappointments the late sixties hit and the zeitgeist was all about hippies, revolutionaries, war, and race riots, and she seemed suddenly out of step with the times. And Hollywood didn't have much of an idea what to do with her, then as now the major female roles in most mainstream films were for pretty, sexy, compliant young women, and that just wasn't her.\n\nWell, doing the \"My Fair Lady\" film would have given her more time at the top, but I don't think it would have had a huge effect on her career as a whole. For all her talent, she just wasn't a good fit for the Hollywood of the sixties and seventies.\n\nI love Audrey in Lady. I think she's charming as hell and very very beautiful. She is brilliant in her tryout at ascot and is wonderful in her dramatic scenes in the second half. I doubt Harrison cared who played Eliza over which he had no say. He wasn't even sure he'd get the role as he was third choice. Eliza could have been Connie Stevens Warner Brothers contract player for all he cared. How many decades has Audrey been dead and yet she is still known by young people. Alone with Monroe as the only person known by young people from old Hollywood.\n\nBy the way Shaw wrote the role of Eliza for a 49 year old actress. So much for Higgins looking 60. And the original actor as Higgins in its first production through his own acting made it clear at the end he was in love Eliza and not done with her. Shaw was furious. the actor said Ha! I've made your play a hit!\n\nI was a boy during the 60s and Andrews was a goddess. Even though Star! was a flop I think it was Darling Lili that really finished off her career. I wish she had done Chitty, Oliver or Bedknobs all of which she was offered. I got through Lili once but never again. And if they could get 1776 made why not the far preferable She Loves Me with Van Dyke which would have given her some clout again and then maybe 40 Carats.\n\nEdwards really fucked up her career. Why as a lesbian was she so obsessed with him?\n\nAnd she could not have done all three due to timing Poppins, Lady and Music. One had to go.\n\nr96, Saul Bass and his wife did that title sequence for \"Age of Innocence,\" and it's one of the best they ever did.\n\nThe novel's and film's story involves the late Victorian \"language of flowers\" (Newland sends lilies of the valley to May Welland ever day while they are engaged to tell them how much he values her innocence, but then on a whim sends Ellen a big bunch of yellow roses, which technically just means friendship but comes to signify splendour and excess after he starts to send them every day). Also, the flowers are shown to bloom quickly in time-lapse photography signifying how little time Newland has (and how all this happened long ago in his past anyway), and they are filmed behind screens of white period handwriting (to show how in their world words are used to hide feelings). Finally, the last shot of flowers is of stage daisies, one of which is then picked by Marguerite at the Old Met to start the \"Flower Duet\" from \"Faust\"--which is of course where the action of original novel begins.\n\nIt's also set against that gorgeous dark lush music from the overture to Gounod's \"Faust\" that suggests both eroticism and a deal with the devil.\n\n[quote]Incidentally, is there any truth to the story that the singer originally hired to dub Kerr in THE KING AND I died in a car accident so Nixon replaced her at the last minute?\n\nI believe it was also mentioned in Nixon's memoir, which is probably where they got the info from the obituary, so no reason to believe it's not true. It would be interesting to learn the name of the singer who died in the accident, but on the other hand, it's likely not a name we would recognize.\n\n[quote]I seem to remember Marni Nixon dubbed Audrey Hepburn after the film was shot and edited, that's why Audrey would not have been able to adjust her acting to Marni's voice. I'm not sure about WSS.\n\nNo, it was for WSS that Marni looped the entire vocal performance of Maria after the film was shot. Natalie had filmed the musical numbers lip-synching to her own tracks. For MFL, I believe what happened was that both Marni and Audrey pre-recorded all or most of the songs, and I think Audrey sometimes filmed to her own tracks and sometime to Marni's, but I'm not sure.\n\nWe've gotten off track from the original discussion, but it's worth taking a moment to note that the reason Marni Nixon was used for all of these projects is that the songs themselves were difficult (from eras where people who wrote musicals expected stars who had some vocal chops) and she had a good even vocal instrument and very clean diction without the exaggerated vibrato and huge projection style of the majority of opera singers. There's a reason why pop albums of opera singers rarely sell well and why the classical albums of pop stars are rarely critical successes. Each genre, whether pop, rock, jazz, country, musical theater, or opera, places different demands upon voices, and upon listeners' expectations, and it's the rare person who can bridge styles successfully and convincingly. So Marni Nixon was a known quantity who could deliver musical theater songs without sounding like an opera diva, and yet, in her own career, she could sing operatically when she was in an opera setting. Millions of Americans grew up singing \"Getting to know you\", \"I feel pretty\", and \"the rain in Spain\" or \"I could have danced all night\" right along with Marni Nixon's voice and felt that that voice defined music theater just fine to them, while really having no idea who Marni Nixon was - any idea of what she looked like, what the rest of her career was all about, or even recognizing her name.\n\n\"What seems really weird to me is that anyone would have ever hired Marni Nixon to be the singing voices of Wood and Hepburn\"\n\nMy assumption is that she was under studio contract, and since she was the most suitable singer they had under contract rather than the best possible singer for these roles, she got the jobs under discussion. Which is a pity, she may have had good diction and pitched her voice to a semi-operatic level rather than operatic, but she just wasn't an interesting singer. She sang all the songs clearly, sweetly, and correctly, but she never made anything *soar*, never infused anything with joy, sorrow, or humor.\n\nAs for \"MFL\", for years I've thought that there was one bit where Audrey's own voice was used in a song, the beginning of \"Just You Wait 'Enry 'Iggins\", where the viciously funny lyrics are half-shouted rather than sung sweetly. I always assumed that this was because that bit wasn't technically difficult to sing, and Hepburn was rather better than Nixon at working enough anger and humor into the song.\n\nR228 The films in question were all made by different studios, so I doubt her being under contract was the reason she got the jobs. She was an expert at dubbing and she had a sort of all-purpose voice and an ability to do accents and to initiate to some extent the people she was dubbing. Like her English accent in An Affair o Remember and The King And I, or her Puerto Rican accent in West Side Story.\n\nI really have a hard time watching the “Marni Nixon musicals” as I call them. Her voice is so weird, at least coming out of other people’s mouths. Sort of alien. And she didn’t sing with any personality or passion.\n\nBut R230, the whole point of hiring a star actor is that they inject personality into whatever they do! So if someone like Marni Nixon is dubbing the songs for a big star, the dubber really needs to work with the actor to bring whatever feeling the actor wants to project into the singing. And Marni Nixon never did that, she sang everything sweetly, correctly, and without feeling.\n\nAnd she really did need to let things soar on occasion. Like I've never forgiven her for the huge \"Tonight\" ensemble in \"West Side Story\", where all the groups of characters start singing together in counterpoint, and Tony and Maria start singing a duet that carries over the counterpoint, and Maria's soprano soars above the full orchestra and the entire cast... and Nixon sang that beautiful solo the way she sang everything else! Sweetly, primly, and correctly! It is SUCH a disappointing moment.\n\nFascinating connections between MY FAIR LADY and GIGI , the most remarkable being that Alan Jay Lerner wanted Audrey for GIGI. Audrey had performed Anita Loos adaption of Colette's play on Broadway but had no desire to make the musical version for MGM.\n\nHollywood producer Arthur Freed first proposed a musicalization of the Colette novella to Alan Jay Lerner during the Philadelphia tryout of MY FAIR LADY in 1954. When Lerner arrived in Hollywood two years later, Freed was battling the Hays Code to bring his tale of a courtesan-in-training to the screen. Another roadblock to the project was the fact Colette's widower had sold the rights to her novella to Gilbert Miller, who planned to produce a film version of the 1954 stage adaptation by Anita Loos. It cost Freed more than $87,000 to purchase the rights from Miller and Loos.\n\nLerner's songwriting partner Frederick Loewe had expressed no interest in working in Hollywood, so Lerner agreed to write the screenplay only. He and Freed discussed casting; Lerner favored Audrey Hepburn, who had starred in the Broadway production written by Loos, but Freed preferred MGM contract star Leslie Caron, who had co-starred in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS for him. Both agreed Maurice Chevalier would be ideal for aging boulevardier Honoré Lachaille, and Lerner proposed Dirk Bogarde for Gaston. Lerner agreed to write the lyrics if Freed could convince Bogarde and designer Cecil Beaton to join the project. He decided to approach Loewe once again, and when he suggested they compose the score in Paris, Loewe agreed.\n\nIn March 1957, the duo began working in Paris. When Chevalier, who already had agreed to appear in the film, first heard \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\", he was delighted. When he discussed his waning interest in wine and women in favor of performing for an audience in cabarets, Chevalier inadvertently inspired the creation of another tune for his character, \"I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore\". The lyrics for another of his songs, the duet \"I Remember It Well\", performed with Hermione Gingold as his former love Madame Alvarez, were adapted from words Lerner had written for LOVE LIFE, a 1948 collaboration with Kurt Weill. \"Say a Prayer for Me Tonight\", a solo performed by Gigi, had been written for Eliza Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY but was removed during the pre-Broadway run. Lerner disliked the melody, but Loewe, Freed, and Minnelli voted to include it in the film.\n\nLerner recalls that for the film GIGI, \"The casting was so haphazard, I don't know how they ever got it on.\" He wrote the part of Honoré Lachaille for Chevalier, but the rest of the casting was still undecided. Having second thoughts about Audrey Hepburn, Freed asked Lerner to meet with her in Paris, but she declined the role. The producer then asked him to fly to London to speak to Leslie Caron, who was living there with her husband Peter Hall. Lerner was surprised to discover the star had become anglicized to the point of losing her French accent. She had recently starred in an unsuccessful stage production of GIGI but when she heard Lerner's interpretation of the story greatly differed from that of the play, she accepted his offer. Her singing voice was dubbed by Betty Wand, though Caron filmed mainly to her own tracks (a brief clip of Caron's voice is heard in the DVD extras). Dirk Bogarde expressed interest, as well, but ultimately was unable to free himself from his contract with J. Arthur Rank. Recalling Louis Jourdan from his performance in THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN, Freed offered him the role of Gaston.\n\nBosley Crowther in the The New York Times opened his rave review of GIGI describing it as \"a musical film that bears such a basic resemblance to MY FAIR LADY that the authors may want to sue themselves\". He added, \"But don't think this point of resemblance is made in criticism of the film, for GIGI is a charming entertainment that can stand on its own two legs. It is not only a charming comprehension of the spicy confection of Colette, but it is also a lovely and lyrical enlargement upon that story's flavored mood and atmosphere ... Vincente Minnelli has marshaled a cast to give a set of performances that, for quality and harmony, are superb.\"\n\nI knew GIGI was a hit and won the Best Picture Oscar, but I did not realize how big a hit it was: \"With all 9 nominations, GIGI won a record-breaking nine Academy Awards (at the 1959 Oscars ceremony); however, this record only lasted for one year, as BEN-HUR broke this record the following year with 11 Oscars. In tribute to GIGI'ds domination of the Oscars, the MGM switchboard answered calls the following day with \"M-Gigi-M\". GIGI, eventually along with 1987's THE LAST EMPEROR held the record as the film(s) with the most Academy Award wins in every category in which it was nominated, until 2003's THE LORD OF THE RINGS - THE RETURN OF THE KING broke the record at the 2004 Oscars ceremony with 11 Oscar nominations and 11 Oscar wins.\n\n[quote]My assumption is that she was under studio contract, and since she was the most suitable singer they had under contract rather than the best possible singer for these roles, she got the jobs under discussion.\n\nCompletely incorrect.\n\n[quote]Which is a pity, she may have had good diction and pitched her voice to a semi-operatic level rather than operatic, but she just wasn't an interesting singer. She sang all the songs clearly, sweetly, and correctly, but she never made anything *soar*, never infused anything with joy, sorrow, or humor.\n\nAnyone who is familiar with Marni's recordings of the songs from THE KING AND I, especially \"Hello, Young Lovers\" and \"Getting to Know You,\" knows that you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n[quote]As for \"MFL\", for years I've thought that there was one bit where Audrey's own voice was used in a song, the beginning of \"Just You Wait 'Enry 'Iggins\", where the viciously funny lyrics are half-shouted rather than sung sweetly\n\nReally, Sherlock? This has been a matter of record for years, and has even been covered in documentaries.\n\n[quote]The whole point of hiring a star actor is that they inject personality into whatever they do! So if someone like Marni Nixon is dubbing the songs for a big star, the dubber really needs to work with the actor to bring whatever feeling the actor wants to project into the singing. And Marni Nixon never did that, she sang everything sweetly, correctly, and without feeling.\n\nAs per Marni's memoir, and many interviews she gave over the years, THE KING AND was the only time when she had the opportunity to work closely with the actress she was dubbing for, because Deborah Kerr was under no illusions that she could sing the score herself, and she worked very closely with Marni to make the dubbing seamless. So it's no coincidence that many people consider Marni's dubbing of THE KING AND I as the most successful of her three most famous dubbing jobs.\n\nThanks r270 and I'll have a look at that if I can find it streaming.\n\nI did find the one I was looking for on youtube. It's called Dubbing Through the Decades and it's in 2 parts, possibly also produced by the same guy with Charles Bush in the doc upthread. Just one short clip after another another from the late 1920s through the early 2000s with no narration, just captions of the actor and their dubber. Very well put together and quite fun, especially the earlier decades with lots from non-musicals but stars like everyone from John Wayne, Norma Shearer, Myrna Loy, Louise Brooks, Stephen Boyd, Kim Novak, etc. in dramas and westerns where they had a single number.\n\nSorry nit to link it but very easy to find.\n\nAgreed, R282. I honestly think Bartlett Sher came up with that ending because he was desperate and simply couldn't think of anything else to do other than the original staging, which is now considered unacceptable. Meanwhile, other people who are not Tony Award winning directors and are not artistic directors of major NYC theater companies have suggested several alternate endings that would have been far more plausible. For one example: When Higgins says \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\" in that final scene, Eliza points to where they are but doesn't go and fetch them, instead, Higgins moves to her slowly, and the two of them stand looking at teach other at close distance as the curtain falls. That ending would have had a wonderful ambiguity to it, which I think is what we want from the final scene of MY FAIR LADY.\n\n[quote]In a touring revival of MFL I saw some 10 or 15 years ago with Christopher Cazenove, when he says \"Where are my slippers?\" she crosses her arms defiantly, he gets up, looks at her and then he crosses his arms defiantly. Curtain down.\n\nThat touring production was based on a Cameron Mackintosh revival that I originally saw in London and later on tour in the U.S. You left out an important detail. After they both cross their arms defiantly and briefly glare at each other, they both break out in laughter. The show thus ended with a warm moment between the two of them. It remains my favorite version of the ending.\n\nPeople today seem unbearably dumb, to me. They seem to have no sophistication or understanding of subtlety. I guess I’m not really surprised, because what in their entertainment today is subtle?\n\nFirst, Eliza and Higgins are each saying a line they have already said earlier, in very different contexts. “I washed my face and hands...” and “Eliza, where the devil...?” They’re now both I love and are aware of it. Higgins is not a man to declare his emotions or to be vulnerable, He says to her, “Where, the devil are my slippers?” Because he’s still Henry Higgins. And she smiles, because she understands and loves Henry Higgins. But he’s not saying it as a bossy demand. He’s saying it much the way a husband would say it to a wife. Not demanding that she fetch them like a dog. I’m surprised it needs to be explained.\n\nThere are very very few things wrongs with the film and so much magnificently right. The glorious score, the magnificent production, the excellent cast down to the bit players, Harry Stradling's beautiful cinematography... You must have it mixed up with Star! or Darling Lili.\n\nAnd everyone keeps forgetting that the one time she does get his slippers for him(which she does on her own without being asked) she throws them at him violently.\n\nLeslie Howard sleepwalks through Pygmalion. Harrison bites into and savors every line. Audrey really is a consort for a king. The Freddie alone in Pygmalion is so goddamn awful he practically ruins the entire film. What was Pascal thinking?\n\nEliza uses arse because in Shaw Eliza uses the word bloody which means nothing to American audiences and it is an American musical made for Broadway audiences.\n\n[quote]There are very very few things wrongs with the film and so much magnificently right. The glorious score, the magnificent production, the excellent cast down to the bit players, Harry Stradling's beautiful cinematography... You must have it mixed up with Star! or Darling Lili.\n\nI don't have it mixed up with anything, I just don't agree with you. In my opinion, there are many huge flaws in the film of MY FAIR LADY, including (but not limited to) the unsuccessful dubbing of Eliza and Freddy, the very sloppy editing in some sections of the film, the slack direction and pacing in much of it, and the near total destruction of \"Get Me to the Church on Time\" because of the elimination of almost all of the dancing.\n\nI find Freddy's dubbing perfect as well. Everybody thinks it was Jeremy Brett but there's that one guy(the one guy in the universe)who thinks the voice type is all wrong for Brett's voice.\n\nI saw Lady once on stage. It was the 20th Anniversary production done by the original producer Herman Levin. Except for the reproduction of the Ascot costumes it was meh and showed nothing of the brilliance of why the show was such a hit. I remember no choreography for Get Me To the Church on Time but I suppose it was there. Turning it into a pub crawl for the film I thought was brilliant. There is so little dancing in the film turning it into a dance number would have been out of place. Wouldn't it be Loverly is beautifully staged but it is movement by a group of middle aged and elderly people rather than dancing.\n\nThere is one scene that is a riot of color. It is the opening where the people are leaving the opera house. The Edwardian wraps of the women are so lush and rich in their colors you wonder if this was just a Beaton fantasy or if they really wore such colors. The richly designed ball is all in pastels despite the beauty of the costumes. The red flowers at The End title really pop because you've seen so little of it during the movie. You see this especially in the recent bluray and 4k.\n\nAlso about the ending. It is all done to music so I bet Andrews and Harrison stayed there just as long on stage.\n\n[quote]I find Freddy's dubbing perfect as well. Everybody thinks it was Jeremy Brett but there's that one guy(the one guy in the universe)who thinks the voice type is all wrong for Brett's voice.\n\nI can't believe that you or anyone else finds that dubbing acceptable, let alone \"perfect.\" The change in timbre between Brett's speaking voice and Bill Shirley's singing voice is so huge that it's very jarring whenever there's a switch from one to the other, not to mention the fact that Shirley only vaguely attempts a Brit accent, and that accent is quite different from Brett's.\n\n[quote]I saw Lady once on stage. It was the 20th Anniversary production done by the original producer Herman Levin. Except for the reproduction of the Ascot costumes it was meh and showed nothing of the brilliance of why the show was such a hit. I remember no choreography for Get Me To the Church on Time but I suppose it was there. Turning it into a pub crawl for the film I thought was brilliant. There is so little dancing in the film turning it into a dance number would have been out of place.\n\nWhy would dancing have been out of place amongst a group of people drinking and celebrating during a pub crawl? Anyway, the main reason why the elimination of dancing from that number was such a mistake is that, of course, they also cut the dance music. Instead, Stanley Holloway and the chorus just keep singing the same lyrics over and over, which is tremendously boring.\n\n\"If you're old like me you spent a lot your childhood in the knotty pine family rec room listening to 3 OBC albums on the new hifi - South Pacific, West Side Story and MFL.\"\n\nFor my early childhood it was the original cast album of \"West Side Story\", and the soundtracks from \"Mary Poppins\" and \"The Sound of Music\", because my parents weren't as tasteful as yours! To this day I can sing every damn note of \"West Side Story\" and consider it the best musical ever written, while the Disney soundtracks have mercifully faded out of my memory bank.\n\nAnd that's one thing Kids Today Don't Understand, how scarce recorded music was when we were kids. The average house had a few dozen records and a radio, and you just had to listen to the same things over and over and over.\n\n[quote]or my early childhood it was the original cast album of \"West Side Story\", and the soundtracks from \"Mary Poppins\" and \"The Sound of Music\", because my parents weren't as tasteful as yours! To this day I can sing every damn note of \"West Side Story\" and consider it the best musical ever written, while the Disney soundtracks have mercifully faded out of my memory bank.\n\nBut MARY POPPINS was a Disney soundtrack. Has that one also \"mercifully\" faded out of your memory bank?\n\nAs popular as the OBC recording of WEST SIDE STORY was, the film soundtrack was exponentially more popular -- not only one of the best selling movie musical soundtrack albums of all time, but literally one of the all-time best-selling LPs in any genre of music. Quite an amazing achievement.\n\n\"Has that one also \"mercifully\" faded out of your memory bank?\"\n\nYes! Mercifully, because the music from that movie isn't that great. I watched for the first time in about forty years when I got Disney+, and well, meh. Not that good a movie, score is fine but not earthshaking. \"Saving Mr. Banks\" was actually a lot more fun, because it gave Emma Thompson the rare chance to play a hilarious cunt.\n\nBut over 50-odd years of listening, \"West Side Story\" has never lost an iota of its glory. The music is utterly sublime, and even the recent remake was pretty damn good!\n\nIn The Good Old Summertime is a Joe Pasternak musical, not an Arthur Freed musical. Pasternak made very light musicals, usually with some classical element (probably why they fit in the pretty classical violinist Marcia Van Dyke). They weren’t going to have an attempted suicide in a Pasternak musical (probably not in a Freed musical, either, but Freed and Minnelli did go for darker themes).\n\nThe movie was originally announced to star June Allyson and Frank Sinatra.\n\nYes this was supposed to be one. Of Judy’s most pleasant assignments near the end of her MGM career. Van Johnson said he gave her positive attention and little gifts, etc. But also she didn’t really have to learn any major choreography, she wasn’t dancing with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire, and there were no production numbers, so that would make a musical easier for anyone.\n\n[quote]It was also because of the success of film's soundtrack lp that he claimed he lost a lot of money which he never forgot.\n\nCan you please explain? Sondheim has said that he declined a larger share of the royalties as offered to him by Bernstein while the Broadway show was being written, after it became clear that Sondheim would be writing nearly all of the lyrics. (The original plan was that SS would collaborate with Bernstein.) Is that what you're referring to? If so, that deal was made long before the movie was even planned. Anyway, Sondheim still got a lot more money from the sales of the WSS movie soundtrack album than he would have gotten if the movie hadn't been made, or if that album hadn't been such a spectacular success. And he certainly didn't \"lose\" any money from the soundtrack LP, so you seem confused.\n\nR339 Well, if you wanted dancing, I saw the London revival in the early 1980s I think somewhere in the middle of the run where since Dame Anna Neagle was playing Higgins' Mother that they actual added a dance break for her to do at the Embassy Ball! It wasn't such a good production, not with touches like Alfred Doolittle picking lice out of his clothes when he visited Higgins' house. Yuck. Liz Robertson had left the production by then (apparently having gotten excellent reviews), and the Eliza I was adequate. I later saw Robertson, one of Alan Jay Lerner's wives, in NY in the dreadful \"Dance a Little Closer\" a/k/a \"Close a Little Faster\" where she had like zero presence, Len Cariou had no voice left from \"Sweeney Todd\" and while you could tell there were some very nice melodies by Charles Strouse, the show was so bad that even George Rose didn't come off well.\n\n[quote]Yes Sondheim said he was so happy to receive full credit for the lyricist's contribution that he said it wasn't necessary to receive full lyricist royalties which then went to Bernstein. The soundtrack lp went on to be such a monster success so he 'lost' half of what he should have made. Which I assume was a hell of a lot of money.\n\nRight, but of course, he didn't \"lose\" it -- he just didn't earn anywhere near as much as would have earned if he hadn't made the unfortunate decision to decline full lyricist's royalties. But he still got paid co-lyricist's royalties for the spectacular sales of that soundtrack album, which must have amounted to a very tidy sum. And also, I assume those royalty payments would have continued till Sondheim's death, even though in lesser numbers as the years went by. But there was probably a huge spike when the album was first transferred to CD.\n\nR401, I'm not sure that he ever explained his reasoning. Maybe that he was just starting out as a very young man and was so grateful to be given full lyric writing credit, as he was initially hired to collaborate with Bernstein on the lyrics. And, of course, Sondheim had no way of knowing what a phenomenon WEST SIDE STORY would become, and that he would be earning considerable amounts of money from it for the rest of his life from countless productions and recordings, including a remake of the film by one of the most popular directors of all time, which was made not long before Sondheim's death.\n\n[quote] Julie Andrews, is totally unappealing, totally homely and sexless, and is as elegant, graceful and feminin as and Ikea cupboard\n\nI had a big crush on her as a little kid in Mary Poppins. I thought she was beautiful with her big blue eyes, bright red lips and her firm but caring demeanor. I had no idea she was the same person in The Sound of Music, where I didn’t care for her.\n\nI was probably 6 years old when I learned how to use my parents record player and I would quietly sit on the couch listening to The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins and The Three Little Pigs. I loved looking at the albums. Can you imagine kids doing that today?\n\n[quote]I miss the \"Leo the Lion\" first six notes \"Da-Da-Da-DUM-Da-Dahhh ___ Da-Da-Da-DUM-Dah-DAhhh\" which portend a horror movie (which is def. true in parts!) I never realized they form a dark dramatic version of 'Glinda;s theme\". Thank you for pointing that out.\n\nYou're welcome. I didn't realize that myself until maybe about 15 or 20 years ago, when I read it somewhere. I had gone all my life loving that opening music of THE WIZARD OF OZ without realizing it was a dark, majestic arrangement and orchestration of the Glinda theme. As far as I'm concerned, whoever had the idea to use that music in such a brilliant, different, creative way was a true genius.\n\nProblem with SOM and Peggy Wood singing \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" were not result of Margery MacKay's.\n\nRather great actress she was Peggy Wood kept missing starting her \"singing\" in sync with dubbed track. So finally it was suggested Ms. Wood turn away from camera and sing with her back towards Sister Maria in sort of darkness. This solved the problem and Ms. Wood was able to get herself together for balance of song.\n\nWhen people saw the takes by Ms. Wood facing away from camera it gave whole thing sort of an other world feeling, as if Mother Abbess was receiving some sort of divine inspiration, so a decision was made in end to leave things as they were.\n\nIt's amazing what Hollywood was able to get up to under studio system. So called great stars of musicals like Rita Hayworth were consistently dubbed.\n\nThat whole sequence when Eliza comes to Higgens' home to see if he will teach her is magnificently directed by Cukor and beautifully acted by everyone and the tea sequence alone(except the tea cup on the hat already discussed) merited Cukor his Oscar. They are master classes in direction and acting.\n\nAlso there are beautiful moments that could never be done on stage. The early morning in Convent Garden that starts out with the actors suddenly freezing, the camera scanning all those flowers and Eliza looking at all the old women as she hears Higgin's voice in her head. The people leaving Ascot in the carriages and the shadows and the ending of On the Street Where You Live.\n\n[quote]I hate those freezes, because they're so stagey that they take me out of the movie.\n\n[quote]But characters suddenly bursting into song, accompanied by full orchestrations, don't take you out of the movie?\n\nNo, because characters bursting suddenly into song, accompanied full orchestrations, is an established convention of musicals on stage and film, whereas that moment of people freezing in their tracks while walking through Covent Garden is a form of stylization that's rarely if ever seen in movies. Come to think of it, that same bit is also done in the opening number of the film of HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING, and I don't like it there, either.\n\n[quote]Well, it's been used to great effect in the X-Men movies!\n\nI'm pretty sure that, in those movies, the actors' images are frozen through special effects, rather than them just freezing in place.\n\n[quote]I love those freezes. It is perfectly matched to the music(the intro to wouldn't it be loverly) and the early morning chimes. It matches the freezes in the Ascot scene. It is part of the stylization of the whole film. It is also a technical tour de force because those dancers are really holding still just like in the Ascot. I guess the Ascot takes you out of the film as well.\n\nI was going to mention the Ascot scene. And yes, I also think that scene is not completely successful, because as well done as it is from a costume design perspective, it takes me out of the film because of the way in which the singers' movement (and non-movement) is stylized -- and also because it's the ONE scene in the entire film that's very obviously shot on a sound stage rather than at an actual location. The filmmakers went out of their way to remove ALL non-diegetic dancing and choreography from the movie, but then they have two scenes where some of the actors very unnaturally freeze in place, and that what takes me out of the movie. Of course, you are perfectly entitled to disagree.\n\nR481, please re-read what I wrote. I'm well aware that the whole movie was shot on sound stages, but my point is that the Ascot scene is the one scene in the film where it's very OBVIOUSLY a sound stage, because of the backdrops.\n\nI was going to clarify that I knew the whole thing was shot on sound stages, but I didn't think it necessary. For example, you may disagree, but I think the Covent Garden scenes, especially the scenes at the very beginning of the film, look very much as if they were shot on location -- though I KNOW they were not. (Is that clear enough for you?)\n\nR493 I'm surprised Doris Day wasn't one of the first. She was the #1 movie star in 1960, 1962, 1963, and 1964. She was also among the Top 10 bankable actors in 1951, 1952, 1965, and 1966.\n\nElizabeth Taylor was #1 in 1961 and was among the Top 10 in 1958, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1967, and 1968.\n\nOn the other hand, Audrey Hepburn never made the list, so I don't know why she was considered a bankable actress. That's presumably why Warner wanted her over Julie Andrews, who indeed made the list several times in the latter '60s (1965, 1968), twice at #1 (1966, 1967).\n\nI like the Black Hills Of Dakota song. I like I Can Do Without You and I like that it was obviously recorded live, not pre-recorded.\n\nBy the way, where do you folks think My Fair Lady could have been filmed, if not on sound stages? The back lot? On location? What would have been the point of traveling to England and spending gazillions to close down locations and take out all the modern things? To show a street corner? Did you want them to film on location at Ascot? That scene was supposed to be stylized.\n\n[quote]By the way, where do you folks think My Fair Lady could have been filmed, if not on sound stages? The back lot? On location? What would have been the point of traveling to England and spending gazillions to close down locations and take out all the modern things? To show a street corner? Did you want them to film on location at Ascot? That scene was supposed to be stylized.\n\nI don't think anyone's suggesting that any of the movie should have been filmed on actual locations. But yes, it would have been smart if the Ascot scene had been filmed outdoors -- or, at least, if they could have made it SEEM like it was filmed outdoors through the use of better backdrops or matte paintings or whatever.\n\nR521, I think R524 stated it perfectly. Sorry, but it’s you who don’t understand.\n\nIt’s funny, I see this a lot - audiences back then, though probably way less educated than today’s viewers, were more sophisticated.\n\nThis was a big movie, if they wanted to film at a race track, they could have. They presented the scene as artificial and theatrical - it’s introduced by a song, the whole thing is a mood. If you saw it on the stage, you would notice they did the same thing onstage - it was the most stylized scene in the show. This is why we never see the race. You’e supposed to accept and enjoy what they’re trying to do - if you manage get what they’re trying to do.\n\n[quote]This was a big movie, if they wanted to film at a race track, they could have. They presented the scene as artificial and theatrical - it’s introduced by a song, the whole thing is a mood.\n\nI understand all of that, and I don't object to the fact that the number is stylized -- that is, indeed, the whole point of the number. I object to the fact that the very odd color of the backdrops makes the scene look so very, very weird. If everything about the Ascot scene were the same except that the backdrop had been painted to look more like an actual sky, I would have no problem with it.\n\nI find the Ascot a highlight of the movie. Especially going from the darkness of Eliza's room to the sudden brilliant black and white still images of the people frozen in place(based on the photos of the actual black Ascot.) Then when the main music starts the entire soundstage is filmed in one shot as the performers start swanning about with the camera lowering until it pulls in.\n\nAlso when we see first see Eliza in her Ascot dress looking so amazing walking within the latticework with Pickering as he squeezes her hand with her smiling nervously.\n\nThen she goes off like a shooting star recounting her aunt dying of influenza(possibly) where Hiller doesn't even come close.\n\nToo bad none of you see supreme cinematic craftmanship when it stares you right in the face.\n\nR537, I admire all that about the scene, as well. I only object to the fucking backdrops :-)\n\nHere's an interesting story about the stylization of the scene. Years ago, in a Facebook group devoted to Hollywood musicals, someone posted about the huge \"mistake\" in the Ascot scene, where the crowd is staring straight ahead during the race, rather than following the horses with their eyes. Although it was difficult for me to refrain from calling this person a complete idiot, I controlled myself and patiently and politely explained that the \"Ascot Gavotte\" is a satire on upper-class Brits being very rigid and showing no emotion, so that staging was done specifically to show how unexcited and uninterested they were in the race. And then the idiot responded by attacking ME for pointing out his stupidity, but he stuck to his guns that this was a terrible mistake in that scene made by the the director and the cinematographer. Incredible, but true.\n\nYou need a star I had no voice You had no choice Dub me\n\nThough I'm all throat My neck's too thin Call Marni in Dub me\n\nHere we are together in the middle of a song If I sang out I'd get the gong Anyone whose ever heard me sing will tell you that My talent's wearing a hat\n\nI'll play the scene You'll sing the song I'll mouth along Dub me\n\nNever do I ever want to sing another song There isn't one I won't sing wrong Deborah Kerr and Cyd Charisse and Natalie and me We can lip-sync right on key"
