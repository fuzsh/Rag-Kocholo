The book musical was the spine of American musical theatre since the dawn of Broadway’s golden age in the 1920s and flowered with such composers, lyricists, and book writers as George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, and Vincent Youmans. Through the succeeding decades, fewer and fewer book musicals with new music were produced on Broadway. The 1960s saw ninety-eight new book musicals with new music, and one commercial revival. For comparison, the period from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2009, offered thirty-eight musicals with new music, and forty-two revivals. During the decades following the 1960s, fewer new musicals were seen on Broadway, and instead the jukebox musical, the composer/lyricist tribute revue, and commercial revivals flourished. The jukebox musical of the Mamma Mia variety used preexisting popular songs to tell its story. For the jukebox musical, songs that had been written years if not decades before were now grafted into a storyline and were expected to further plot, develop character, and create atmosphere, a daunting expectation for pop songs that had been written independently for popular mass consumption. The composer and lyricist tribute revue also became a distressing trend as the Broadway decades wore on. This genre began Off-Broadway in 1963 with The World of Kurt Weill in Song (aka A Kurt Weill Cabaret), and over the next fifty years some sixty such tributes were seen Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway. Soon largescale tributes to Eubie Blake, Johnny Burke, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, and Fats Waller were produced on Broadway, in addition to a spate of tributes to pop-song lyricists and composers (The Look of Love) and singing groups (Jersey Boys). Revivals also flourished. During the 1960s, revivals were essentially relegated to noncommercial venues such as City Center and Lincoln Center. But as the decades passed more revivals than new musicals were seen in New York. If the 1960s were the last hurrah of the traditional book musical with new music, it was also a period that looked forward. The era institutionalized the concept musical, which didn’t always tell its story in traditional linear fashion. The concept musical minimized plot and character and instead emphasized mood and atmosphere to convey a particular point of view. All aspects of the concept musical (book, lyrics, music, direction, choreography, visual design, and performance) were fashioned into a narrative that generally embraced an abstract point of view that didn’t necessarily resolve the plot with a neat, clear-cut ending. In earlier years there had been the occasional concept musical, such as W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten’s Paul Bunyan (1941) and Alan Jay Lerner and Kurt Weill’s Love Life (1948). The former used the concept of Paul Bunyan as a force of nature necessary in the development of a new nation (and a force that must necessarily be discarded once the nation is established), and the latter used vaudevillian techniques in its view of marriage in America over the decades. But Hair was the first commercially successful one, and its popularity institutionalized the concept musical, which soon found its niche and paved the way for Celebration (1969), Promenade (1969), Company (1970), Follies (1971), Mass (1971), A Look at the Fifties (1972), Chicago (1975),\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA Chorus Line (1975), Pacific Overtures (1976), 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (1976), Swing (1980), Nine (1982), Sunday in the Park with George (1984), Into the Woods (1987), Assassins (1991), and The Voyage (1992). The Complete Book of 1960s Broadway Musicals examines in detail all 271 musicals that opened on Broadway from January 1, 1960, through December 31, 1969. The musicals discussed are: ninety-eight book musicals with new music, three book musicals with preexisting music, twenty-two revues, sixteen personality revues, eight revues seen at the 1964 New York World’s Fair, twenty-five imports, fifty-seven institutional revivals, one commercial revival, seven return engagements, five transfers from Off Broadway, and twentynine pre-Broadway closings. To be as inclusive as possible, I’ve included productions that don’t fall into the traditional classifications of drama, comedy, book musical, and musical revue, such as A Thurber Carnival, Beyond the Fringe, and From the Second City, which were primarily evenings of comic sketches with incidental music and songs. Each entry includes technical information and commentary. My goal is to capture basic information about each production and to provide for the reader a reference source that examines in minute detail the technical aspects surrounding each show as well as commentary that often focuses new light on many of the decade’s hit musicals. I try to personalize these productions by including obscure details (e.g., the visual joke that both closes the first act and opens the second act of Nowhere to Go but Up; Michael Kidd’s brilliant staging of the opening dream sequence for Skyscraper; the filmed overture for 13 Daughters). The technical information for each production includes: opening and closing dates; name of theatre (including transfers, if applicable); number of performances; the show’s advertising “tag” (Sherry! is “The Intoxicating New Musical!”); names of book writer, sketch writer, lyricist, and composer; names of director, choreographer, musical director, producer, and scenic, costume, and lighting designers). The names of cast members are included, with each performer’s name followed by the name of the character portrayed; e.g., Carol Channing (Dolly Gallagher Levi). Performers’ names in italics reflect those who were billed above the musical’s title. Also included are the number of acts; for book musicals, the time and place of the musical; and the titles of all musical numbers, by act (following each song title is the name of the performer, not character, who introduced each song). If a musical is based on source material, such material is referenced. The commentary includes a brief plot summary (in the case of revues, representative sketches are discussed); brief quotes from the critics; informative trivia; details about London and other foreign productions; and information about recordings, published scripts, and film and television versions. The entries also include background information about a musical’s gestation and pre-Broadway tryout history. Tony Award nominees and winners are noted, along with Pulitzer Prize and Drama Desk Award winners. Bold type indicates the nominee was the winner in its category. Throughout the book, bolded titles refer to productions that are discussed elsewhere in the text. The book includes twelve appendixes: an alphabetical listing; a seasonal chronology; a chronology divided by classification (revue, import, etc.); discography; filmography; a list of all Gilbert and Sullivan operettas produced during the decade; a list of musicals revived by the New York City Center Light Opera Company; a list of musicals revived by the New York City Opera; a list of musicals revived by the Music Theatre of Lincoln Center; a list of operettas (other than Gilbert and Sullivan) produced in New York during the decade; published scripts; and a list of all theatres where the musicals played, including transfers. The bibliography identifies the sources that were helpful in the writing of this book. Further, most of the information used in the book was drawn from source materials (playbills, souvenir programs, window cards, flyers, recordings, scripts, films, newspaper advertisements) as well as personal observations based on my attendance at many of the productions (including A Thurber Carnival, Subways Are for Sleeping, No Strings, Here’s Love, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, Wait a Minim!, The Apple Tree, At the Drop of Another Hat, Mata Hari, Celebration, Dear World, Come Summer, Billy, and Coco).\n\n• 1959–1960 Season\n\nBEG, BORROW OR STEAL “A MUSICAL FABLE\n\nOF THE\n\n1950S”\n\nTheatre: Martin Beck Theatre Opening Date: February 10, 1960 Closing Date: February 13, 1960 Performances: 5 Book: Bud Freeman Lyrics: Bud Freeman Music: Leon Pober Based on the unpublished short story “Steal—A Disc Jockey’s Handbook” by Marvin Seiger and Bud Freeman and the 1959 LP recording Clara.

The musical cut short its pre-Broadway engagement at Philadelphia’s Erlanger Theatre, where it had been scheduled to play through February 13. With a run of just five performances, it was also the decade’s first musical flop. But it had an interesting genesis. It first saw life as a concept album called Clara (the “musical comedy without a production” was released by Commentary Records LP # T-02) with Betty Garrett in the title role; the album also included Jimmie Komack (as Junior [Komack had been one of the “Heart” quartet in the original 1955 production of Damn Yankees]) as well as Johnny Standley (“Mother”) and Sid Tomack (A.C.), two “lost, lonely, addicted” types whom the era might discreetly have called Not the Marrying Kind. The quartet of characters was backed by a trio called The Sad Apples (Betty Bolling, Dee Norvus, and Jody Wilder). For Broadway, Garrett reprised her role of Clara, and Biff McGuire was Junior (the characters of “Mother” and A.C. didn’t make it beyond the record album). The liner notes for Clara and commentary in the critics’ reviews for Beg, Borrow or Steal reveal two completely different stories. There were also major differences in the scores of the album and the stage version. Of the thirteen musical sequences on the album, eight were retained for the Broadway production (“What Are We Gonna Do Tonight?,” “Rootless,” “I Can’t Stop Talking,” “It’s All in Your Mind,” “No One Knows Me,” “You [You’ve] Got Something to Say,” “Think,” and “Little People”) and five were not (“It Ain’t Gonna Be Easy,” “The Avalon Ballroom,” “Goin’ Home Blues,” “Interlude for Passage of Time,” and “It’s Never Been Done Before”). The stage production added twelve numbers (“Some Little People” [different from “Little People”], “Poetry and All That Jazz,” “Don’t Stand Too Close to the Picture,” “Beg, Borrow or Steal” [Recitative], “Beg, Borrow or Steal,” “Zen Is When,” “Zen Is When” [Ballet], “Clara,” “Presenting Clara Spencer,” “In Time,” “Rafesville, U.S.A.,” and “Let’s Be Strangers Again”). The album’s plot centered on Clara, a lonely New York City butcher who’s attracted to a customer named Junior, whom she takes home to meet the self-centered twosome “Mother” and A.C., both of whom live off her earnings. Clara and Junior’s romance has its ups and downs, and for a while “Mother” and A.C. do their best to break it up; but ultimately “Mother” and A.C. help the estranged couple reunite. If the New York reviews are any indication, the plot of the Broadway production was a somewhat confusing spoof of the era’s beatniks (John Chapman in the New York Daily News quipped that the book was a “plotnik”). The action centers on Junior (McGuire), Clara, Rafe (Larry Parks), and Pistol (Eddie Bracken, who was also one of the musical’s coproducers). Junior is a square, gray-flannel-suit type who under the inspired name of Rex All (one of the musical’s few witticisms) has written purposely bad beatnik poetry as a joke; but the real joke is that his poetry is highly regarded by the beat set. Chapman reported that Junior writes his poetry with the help of a few books and a pair of dice: he shoots craps for the book, page, and line, and from there strings words together for his poems. Junior is searching for Clara, an old girlfriend who now works in a health-food store, which also sells books on Zen Buddhism (a couple of the critics noted that when selling a particular food item, Clara tells her customers, “If you take this, it will give your hair body, and your body hair”). Soon Clara is hired by con artist Rafe, the part-owner of a beat club called Chez Pit who pretends to embrace the beatnik lifestyle but is only interested in making money off the beat scene by luring tourists into the club. Clara begins working in the Pit, where she dances in what seems to be a burlesque of a bull ring dance (at least according to Frank Aston in the New York World-Telegram), beats bongo drums with her hips, and reads poetry. The Pit is co-owned by Clara’s brother Pistol, who’s clueless about Rafe’s greed and underhandedness and whose only interest is in Zen. Ultimately, Junior and Clara become a happy twosome and Rafe takes off for parts unknown, ready to con the “Numb Generation,” his term for the next “in” group which will follow the beatniks.\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n3\n\nThe critics gave the musical a unanimous drubbing, praising only the cast members for their valiant efforts (Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times said they were “cheerful and lively as if they believed” they were in a musical masterpiece by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, and Cole Porter, with Leonard Bernstein acting as consultant). And two or three critics made note of the evening’s funniest moment, a visual joke depicting a kind of mobile-cum-collage of flowers adorning Pistol’s apartment in which the petals reach out and grab anyone who gets too close to it. The flower was certainly cousin to Audrey II, the celebrated man-eating plant in Roger Corman’s The Little Shop of Horrors, which was released in September 1960, nine months after Beg, Borrow or Steal opened and closed on Broadway. The cult film was of course later adapted into the 1982 hit Off-Broadway musical Little Shop of Horrors (book and lyrics by Howard Ashman, music by Alan Menken). Aston warned that “man, any square” who sees Beg, Borrow or Steal “is going to get beat, real beat. Be warned”; Richard Watts in the New York Post said the evening offered “quite a bit of story” which was often “obscure” as well as “heavy-handed and disorganized”; and Walter Kerr in the New York HeraldTribune noted that the Zen aphorism “Do not try, and do not try not to try” was endlessly repeated several times during the course of the evening, and he assured his readers that the musical’s creators were “faithful” to this saying. Chapman said Garrett was a “beautnik,” but noted the “scorenik” had “more bounce than beauty” (as for the ballet “Zen Is When,” he said it lasted so long that he was thrown into “a deep state of contemplation in which I wondered dreamily if I’d ever get outdoors again”); John McClain in the New York Journal-American felt the “raggedy and meandering” musical was peopled with “dreary” characters, but singled out six numbers (“Poetry and All That Jazz,” “Zen Is When,” “You’ve Got Something to Say,” “Presenting Clara Spencer,” “Little People” [which Atkinson had also praised], and the title song); and Robert Coleman in the New York Mirror said the “musical mishmash” forced him to gaze “longingly” at the theatre’s exit signs. Watts concluded his review by noting that the previous Broadway season had offered another beatnik musical, one which had been “cruelly treated” by the critics, and so his “apologetic alternate title” for Beg, Borrow or Steal was Bring Back “The Nervous Set.” Broadway and Off-Broadway musicals of the mid- and late 1960s frequently looked at hippie culture, but the beats were represented in just two Broadway musicals, The Nervous Set (1959) and Beg, Borrow or Steal. They were also satirized in Off-Broadway revues of the era, and Lewis Funke in the New York Times once noted that beatniks, television, Marilyn Monroe, and Tennessee Williams were “all subjects of standing in the revue world.” As for The Nervous Set, it played for just twenty-three performances, but its one-of-a-kind score (its jazzy, intimate midnight-at-the-coffee-house sound is unlike any Broadway music of the era) was happily preserved by Columbia Records (LP # OL-5430 and # OS-2018; later issued on CD by DRG Records # 19020). Tommy Wolf’s sparkling music and Fran Landesman’s clever lyrics offer many delights, including two minor standards, “The Ballad of the Sad Young Men” (perhaps the first openly gay song in musical theatre since “Green Carnation” was heard in Noel Coward’s Bitter Sweet [London and New York, 1929]) and “Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most” (which was dropped during the musical’s tryout and thus not on the cast album). The score includes a batch of terrific topical “beat” numbers (“Man, We’re Beat,” “New York,” “How Do You Like Your Love?,” “Party Song,” “Night People”), some haunting and moody ballads (“What’s to Lose,” “Stars Have Blown My Way,” “Laugh, I Thought I’d Die”), a driving, pulsating “I’ve Got a Lot to Learn About Life,” and the infectious and irresistible Kingston Trio–flavored “Travel the Road of Love” (in which a young Larry Hagman is the featured singer). Beginning in the 1970s, it was common for “concept” studio cast recordings to be adapted into stage musicals (such as Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Chess, The Life, and Jekyll & Hyde). But such a practice was unusual in earlier years, and, in fact, the recording of Clara was just the second album to inspire a Broadway musical. The first was Columbia Records’ 1954 studio cast recording archy and mehitable, which was later adapted into the 1957 Broadway musical Shinbone Alley. Coincidentally, Eddie Bracken, who sang on the recording of archy and mehitable, also appeared in the stage productions of both Shinbone Alley and Beg, Borrow or Steal; further, he was in the cast of the live-action 1960 television adaptation of Shinbone Alley and was the voice of archy in the 1971 cartoon film version; he can also be heard on the belated 1993 release of the complete cast recording of Shinbone Alley, which was recorded live through the theatre’s sound system and includes the complete dialogue and musical numbers.\n\n4\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nTHE CRADLE WILL ROCK Theatre: New York City Center Opening Date: February 11, 1960 Closing Date: February 21, 1960 Performances: 4 Book, Lyrics, and Music: Marc Blitzstein Direction: Howard Da Silva; Producer: The New York City Opera Company; Choreography: Billy Parsons; Scenery: David Hays; Costumes: Ruth Morley; Musical Direction: Lehman Engel Cast: Tammy Grimes (Moll), Seth Riggs (Gent, Reporter), Arnold Voketaitis (Dick), Dan Merriman (Cop), Kenneth Smith (Reverend Salvation), Jack Harrold (Editor Daily), Michael Wager (Yasha), Chandler Cowles (Dauber), John Macurdy (President Prexy), Philip Bruns (Professor Trixie), Maurice Stern (Professor Mamie), Howard Fried (Professor Scoot), Joshua Hecht (Doctor Specialist), William Griffis (Harry Druggist), Lehman Engel (Clerk), Craig Timberlake (Mr. Mister), Ruth Kobart (Mrs. Mister), Keith Kaldenberg (Junior Mister), Nancy Dussault (Sister Mister), Frank Porretta (Steve), Sophie Ginn (Sadie Polock), Robert Kerns (Gus Polock), George Del Monte (Bugs), David Atkinson (Larry Foreman), Jane Johnston (Ella Hammer), William Zachariiesen (Reporter); Ensemble: The New York City Opera Chorus The musical was presented in two acts.

But on June 10 the WPA announced that funding cuts precluded the opening of new FTP productions before July 1 (including The Cradle Will Rock). The cuts are clearly documented, but the “street” interpreted the cancellation as evidence that the government was repressing Blitzstein’s left-leaning “labor opera.” On the night of June 16, ticket-holders for the world premiere performance of The Cradle Will Rock found the Maxine Elliott closed, but the creators of the musical were determined the show would go on, and soon found an empty theatre uptown, the Venice, and so the cast and the audience marched uptown for a decidedly one-of-a-kind opening performance. As discussed in Eric A. Gordon’s biography of Blitzstein (Mark the Music: The Life and Work of Marc Blitzstein, published by St. Martin’s Press in 1989), the performers couldn’t appear on the stage of the Venice because they were still technically under the employ of the FTP, but nothing could prevent them from performing from the orchestra section of the theatre itself. The last-minute acquisition of a piano allowed Blitzstein to play the score while the actors, scattered across the auditorium, performed their roles as if they were on the stage. The original cast members included Howard Da Silva (Larry Foreman) and Olive Stanton (Moll).\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n5\n\nA total of fourteen performances were given at the Venice (some sources cite nineteen), and on June 27 a sequence from the musical was broadcast on radio. On the following December 5, the work was presented over four consecutive Sunday nights at the Mercury Theatre for four performances, and on January 3, 1938, the musical “officially” premiered, playing first at the Windsor Theatre and then returning to the Mercury for the final weeks of the run, for a total of 108 performances. The script of The Cradle Will Rock was published by Random House in 1938, and was one of the first musicals to appear in hardback book format (the first major musicals to be published in hardback editions were all in one way or another political in nature: Of Thee I Sing [1931], Let ’Em Eat Cake [1933], Johnny Johnson [1936], I’d Rather Be Right [1937], The Cradle Will Rock [1938], and Knickerbocker Holiday [1938]). The original cast album of The Cradle Will Rock was recorded in April 1938 by Musicraft Records on seven twelve-inch records (album # 18, with the individual records numbered 1075–1081). The recording marks the first American musical to receive a full-length recording by a domestic company (a few Broadway musicals had previously been recorded in London with their original West End casts). The Cradle recording was later released on a limited-edition LP of 1,000 copies by American Legacy Records (# T-1001). The Cradle Will Rock takes place in Steeltown, U.S.A., and the “labor opera” depicts capitalists (including Mister Mister, who owns the steel mill and runs the town) as evil and union workers (such as Larry Foreman) as saints. The political stance of the work was simplistic and lacked subtlety, but was nonetheless powerful because of the convictions Blitzstein brought to it. And unlike so many diatribes, the work was not without humor (including the characters’ names, such as Mister Mister, Mrs. Mister, Junior Mister, Sister Mister, Moll, Harry Druggist, and Larry Foreman), and Blitzstein insured his work was infused with melody and tongue-in-cheek wit (“Art for Art’s Sake,” “Croon, Spoon,” and “Honolulu”). There were also powerful character songs (such as Moll’s “I’m Checkin’ Home Now” and “Nickel under the Foot”), and the energetic, anthem-like title song. The work was revived in a “complete concert performance” at City Center for two showings on November 24 and 25, 1947. Leonard Bernstein conducted the New York City Symphony, and Howard Da Silva reprised his original role of Larry Foreman; the cast included Estelle Loring (Moll), Shirley Booth (Mrs. Mister), Jack Albertson, Will Geer, Robert Chisholm, Muriel Smith, and Jo Hurt. A month later the production transferred to Broadway at the Mansfield (now Brooks Atkinson) Theatre on December 26 for a run of thirty-four performances. The production’s cast included Alfred Drake (Larry Foreman) and Vivian Vance (Mrs. Mister), along with some of the performers who had appeared in the concert version (such as Estelle Loring). The current 1960 revival opened for a limited engagement at City Center on January 11, 1960. The cast included David Atkinson (Larry Foreman), Tammy Grimes (Moll), Craig Timberlake (Mister Mister), Ruth Kobart (Mrs. Mister), Nancy Dussault (Sister Mister), and Frank Porretta (Steve). Howard Taubman in the New York Times had seen the original production at the Venice in 1937 and he noted the musical was “dated and corny” and that Blitzstein depicted his characters as either “pure white or villainously black.” But he said the work “bursts with vitality . . . [and] it fills a theatre with excitement,” and he praised Blitzstein’s score (“torch song, Hawaiian undulation, waltz, fox trot, Bach chorale gone native, patter, recitative, and, as [Blitzstein] once put it, silly symphony”). Over the years the musical may have lost its “inflammability,” but it nonetheless “blows up a storm in the theatre that you should appreciate whatever your political allegiance.” He also noted the production’s “Broadway sheen,” and applauded the cast and musical director Lehman Engel. Howard Da Silva, who created the role of Larry Foreman in the original 1937 production, here directed the revival. On April 19, 1964, the work was revived in an abridged version as part of the Marc Blitzstein Memorial Concert (Blitzstein had been murdered the previous January 22), and the cast included Howard Da Silva, Barbara Harris, and Leonard Bernstein at the piano. On November 8, 1964, the musical was revived Off-Broadway at Theatre Four for eighty-two performances. Directed by Da Silva, the production’s cast included Jerry Orbach (Larry Foreman), Lauri Peters (Moll), Clifford David (Dauber and Professor Trixie), Nancy Andrews (Mrs. Mister), Joseph Bova (Junior Mister), Rita Gardner (Sister Mister), Micki Grant (Ella Hammer), and Gershon Kingsley (Clerk). The production was recorded by MGM Records on a two-LP set (# SE-4289-2-OC). On September 12, 1978, the musical was seen Off-Off-Broadway at the Eighteenth Street Playhouse for four performances, and on May 9, 1983, it was revived Off-Broadway at the American Place Theatre, later reopening at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre on July 12, for a total of sixty-four performances. The American Place Theatre cast included Patti LuPone (Moll) and Randle Mell (Larry Foreman); for the reopening, Lisa Banes was Moll. The American Place Theatre production was shown on public television in 1986.\n\n6\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nOn August 5, 1985, the musical was seen in London at the Old Vic, with LuPone and Mell. The production was recorded by Polydor Records (LP # 827-937-1-Y-1), and a complete cast recording was later issued on a two-CD set by That’s Entertainment Records (# CDTEM2-1105). A later Los Angeles production from 1994 was recorded by Lockett Palmer Records (CD # LPR-940411). Some songs from the musical are included on the soundtrack of Cradle Will Rock, a 1999 film that dealt with the drama surrounding the opening of the 1937 production. The album was released by RCA Victor/ BMG Records (CD # 09026-63577-2), and Cradle Will Rock, a coffee-table book about the film (which includes the screenplay by Tim Robbins and lyrics by Blitzstein), was published by Newmarket Press in 2000. The story of the musical’s genesis was the inspiration for Jason Sherman’s play It’s All True, which opened at the Terragon Theatre in Toronto on January 6, 1999. Blitzstein’s musical No for an Answer is another look at labor and management issues, but this time around Blitzstein was more bitter and less satiric about this seemingly eternal conflict. The work was first seen at the Mecca Auditorium (now the City Center) for three performances beginning on January 5, 1941.\n\nSTREET SCENE Theatre: New York City Center Opening Date: February 13, 1960 Closing Date: February 19, 1960 Performances: 3 Book: Elmer Rice Lyrics: Langston Hughes and Elmer Rice Music: Kurt Weill Based on the 1929 play Street Scene by Elmer Rice.

The action unfolded on the stoop and front sidewalk of a New York City tenement during a hot summer’s day, and depicted both the trivialities and tragedies of the people who live and work there. The action centered on the Maurrant family: the doomed Anna is unhappily married to Frank, who is insanely jealous of her, and their daughter Rose seems prey to the bitterness and futility of the hardscrabble underside of Manhattan life. Kurt Weill and Langston Hughes’s operatic adaptation of the play opened at the Adelphi Theatre on January 9, 1947, for 148 performances. The cast of the original production included Polyna Stoska (Anna), Norman Cordon (Frank), and Anne Jeffries (Rose); Maurice Abravanel conducted. While not a financial success, the opera is one of the crown jewels of American musical theatre and is frequently revived. As of this writing, the opera has been produced eight times by the New York City Opera Company. The first revival opened on April 2, 1959, at City Center for seven performances; the cast included Wilma Spence (Anna), William Chapman (Frank), and Helena Scott (Rose). Other principals were Ruth Kobart, Frank Porretta, and Nancy Dussault, and Samuel Krachmalnick was the conductor. The second revival opened on September 27, 1959, for two performances; Chapman, Scott, Kobart, and Dussault reprised their roles, and Elisabeth Carron was Anna; Krachmalnick again conducted. The current 1960 revival opened on February 13 for three performances. The cast included Carron (Anna), Norman Atkins (Frank), Joy Clements (Rose), and Porretta (Sam), and Julius Rudel conducted. J.B. in the New York Times found the revival “remarkable,” noting the music had retained its “freshness” and the story its “dramatic impact.” He praised the “extraordinarily well-chosen cast,” and noted that Rudel’s “well-paced” conducting added to the power of the dramatic story. The fourth revival opened in 1963, and the fifth in 1966 (see separate entries for these productions). The sixth revival opened on October 8, 1978, at the New York State Theatre for four performances. Chapman was again Frank, and other cast members were Eileen Schauler (Anna) and Catherine Maltifano (Rose); John Mauceri conducted. These cast members as well as Mauceri were seen in the next revival, which opened on October 13, 1979, for five performances. City Opera’s eighth and most recent revival of the opera opened on September 7, 1990, for six performances; Chris Nance conducted, and the cast included William Parcher (Frank), Margaret Cusack (Anna), and Sheryl Woods (Rose). The cast album of the 1947 production was recorded by Columbia Records (LP # OL-4139; later released on CD by CBS Records Masterworks # MK-44668). For the recording, the role of Frank is sung by Cordon’s understudy Randolph Symonette, who eventually assumed the role in the Broadway production. A 1949 radio broadcast from the Hollywood Bowl was released by Naxos Musicals Records (CD # 8-120885) with Polyna Stoska and Brian Sullivan from the original Broadway cast; other singers on the recording are Dorothy Sarnoff (Rose) and Norman Atkins (Frank). Both the 1947 and 1949 recordings are abridged, but there are two fulllength two-CD interpretations of the score. The English National Opera version of a production that opened\n\n8\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\non October 13, 1989, was released by That’s Entertainment Records (# CDTER-2-1185), and the cast includes Kristine Ciesinki (Anna), Janis Kelly (Rose), Bonaventura Bottone (Sam), Richard van Allan (Frank), and Catherine Zeta Jones (Mae); Carl Davis conducted. Another two-CD set was a studio cast recording released by Decca Records (# 433-371-2) with a cast which included Josephine Barstow (Anna), Samuel Ramey (Frank), Angelina Reaux (Rose), and Jerry Hadley (Sam); John Mauceri conducted. “Italy in Technicolor” was cut during the tryout of the original Broadway production, and is included in the collections Kurt Weill Revisited (Painted Smiles Records CD # PSCD-108) and Lost in Boston II (Varese Sarabande Records CD # VSD-5485). The New York City Opera’s 1979 revival was telecast on public television on October 27, 1979, and a DVD of a joint production by the Huston Grand Opera, Theatre im Pfalzbau Ludwigshafen, and the Theatre des Westens, Berlin, was released by Image Entertainment (# ID924ORADVD). All lyrics, spoken dialogue, and music were included in an undated softcover edition published by Chappell & Co.\n\nTHE CONSUL Theatre: New York City Center Opening Date: February 14, 1960 Closing Date: February 21, 1960 Performances: 2 Libretto and Music: Gian-Carlo Menotti Direction: Gian-Carlo Menotti (magic sequences created and directed by Fred Keating); Producer: The New York City Opera Company; Scenery and Costumes: Horace Armistead; Lighting: Jean Rosenthal; Musical Direction: Werner Torkanowsky Cast: Chester Ludgin (John Sorel), Patricia Neway (Magda Sorel), Evelyn Sachs (The Mother), Joshua Hecht (Secret Police Agent), William Zachariasen (First Plainclothesman), Sam Kirkham (Second Plainclothesman), Regina Sarfaty (The Secretary), Arnold Voketaitis (Mr. Kofner), Maria Marlo (The Foreign Woman), Maria Di Gerlando (Anna Gomez), Ruth Kobart (Vera Boronel), Jack Harrold (Nika Magadoff [The Magician]), Dan Merriman (Assan), Mabel Mercer (Voice on the Record) The opera was presented in three acts. The action takes place somewhere in Europe during the recent past. Gian-Carlo Menotti’s Cold War opera The Consul premiered on March 15, 1950, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre for 269 performances, and won the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award for Best Musical and the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for music. It was a powerful self-described “musical drama” that depicted an unnamed totalitarian country whose citizens are persecuted by secret police and a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Underground protestor John Sorel has escaped from the country, and has sent word to his wife Magda to get visa papers so that she, their baby, and his ailing mother may join him. But Magda is shadowed by the police and becomes entangled in the spider’s web of the bureaucratic maze of the consul’s office, which is run by his coldly efficient secretary (the consul himself is never seen) who tells Magda that “Your name is a number, your story is a case, your need a request, your hopes will be filed.” But the visas are elusive, as there is always one more document that must be executed in the unending morass of papers and questionnaires. Ultimately, John returns to help his family, but it’s too late: he’s arrested, his mother has succumbed to illness, the baby has died of starvation, and Magda has committed suicide. Menotti’s powerful score offered a number of highlights, including a first-act quintet (“In Endless Waiting Rooms”) for petitioners waiting in vain for their visas, and a surreal sequence in which a magician hypnotizes them (“art is the artist’s only transport”) into a dream of sweet music and waltzes (but even in this fantasy they dance in “mechanical tick-tock fashion,” and when the consul’s secretary asks the magician to produce his papers, all he can do is pull a rabbit out of his hat). The opera began with a song (“Tu reviendras”) heard on a distant radio; the voice on the recording was that of cabaret singer Mabel Mercer, and it’s become a tradition for most if not all productions of the opera to include her recording of the song. Other gripping moments were Magda’s arias “To This We’ve Come” and “I Never Meant to Do This.” And there was a tender “Lullaby” (“I shall find you shells and stars”) for the mother-in-law.\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n9\n\nIn his review of the original production, Robert Coleman in the Daily Mirror said the opera might “open the eyes” of the “local comrades . . . dim-witted dupes . . . who think life behind the Iron Curtain in just dandy.” Virgil Thomson in the New York Daily Mirror said that while Menotti “was not quite a first-class composer,” his opera “may well have its place in our century’s history of the stage.” The original cast album was released by Decca Records (LP # DX-101). The original production was conducted by Lehman Engel, and starred Patricia Neway (Magda), Cornell MacNeil (John), Marie Powers (The Mother), Gloria Lane (The Secretary), Leon Lishner (Secret Police Agent), Andrew McKinley (The Magician), and George Jongeyans (Mr. Kofner). Jongeyans was later known as Jon Geyans (and still later as George Gaynes); as Jongeyans, he appeared in the original 1950 production of Cole Porter’s Out of This World (as Jupiter) and introduced “I Jupiter, I Rex” and “Hark to the Song of the Night.” As Gaynes, he created the role of Robert Baker in the original 1953 production of Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green’s Wonderful Town, and introduced “A Quiet Girl” and, with Edie Adams, the duet “It’s Love.” There are two other recordings of the score, one from the Spoleto Festival (Chandos Records CD # CHAN9706-2) and one from the Berkshire Opera Company (Newport Classic Records CD # NPD-85645/2). The libretto was published in softcover by G. Schirmer in 1950. The opera was revived eight times by the New York City Opera Company. The first revival opened at the City Center on October 8, 1952, for three performances (Neway, Lane, and Jongeyans [now Jon Geyans] reprised their original roles), the second the following spring on April 16 (original cast members Neway, Lane, and Lishner were joined by Richard Torigi [John], David Aiken [Mr. Kofner], Norman Kelley [The Magician], and Mary Kreste [The Mother]). The current 1960 production was the third revival, opening on February 14 at the City Center. Neway reprised her original role of Magda, and the cast included Chester Ludgin (John), Evelyn Sachs (The Mother), Regina Sarfaty (The Secretary), Joshua Hecht (The Police Agent), Arnold Voketaitis (Mr. Kofner), Jack Harrold (The Magician), and Ruth Kobart (Vera Boronel). Maria Marlo, who was the Foreign Woman in the original production, re-created her role for the revival. This production was filmed for closed-circuit pay television in 1960, and was shown in 1961. The cast included most of the performers seen at City Center (however, for the televised version, Leon Lishner recreated his original role of The Police Agent, and Norman Kelley sang the role of The Magician). The telecast was presented by Telemeter/Theatre-in-the-Home (Jean Dalrymple, executive producer, and Leslie Winik, program director), and was directed by Bill Butler and William A. Graham. It was shown over the period of one week, from March 16 through March 22, 1961, with both afternoon and evening showings at $1.50 per viewing. Television viewers were sent a special Playbill that included cast and other information, and they also received a “ticket” for the performance (indicating the theatre was “Your Living Room” and your seat was “A 1”; it also noted the ticket “entitles you to park your car in your own garage free during the performance”). The production was filmed at TV Studio 65 on West 26th Street, and the program notes indicated that Werner Torkanowsky conducted a thirty-eight-piece orchestra in one section of the studio while the stage action with the performers was filmed on five sets located in another part of the building (Torkanowsky watched the performers via television monitors). The Playbill stated there would be three more productions following the telecast of The Consul: Show Girl (the 1961 revue that starred Carol Channing); the 1960 Off-Broadway production of Hedda Gabler; and An Evening with Edith Piaff [sic] in Paris (the latter was filmed at the Olympia Theatre in Paris). Later pay-per-view offerings included From the Second City (as The Second City Revue). The DVD of the television production of The Consul is available on Video Artists International (# 4266). Because Neway was appearing as the Mother Abbess in the original 1959 Broadway production of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II’s The Sound of Music, she was free only on Sundays, and so the 1960 revival was given twice on two consecutive Sunday evenings. For The Sound of Music, Neway won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and introduced “Climb Every Mountain,” and (with Mary Martin) “My Favorite Things.” Besides the Mother Abbess, Neway created “mother” roles in three more New York productions within the two-year period of 1958 and 1959: New York City Opera’s 1958 premiere of Marc Bucci’s Tale for a Deaf Ear; the 1958 Broadway production of Menotti’s Maria Golovin; and New York City Opera’s 1959 world premiere of Hugo Weisgall’s Six Characters in Search of an Author. If all these mother roles weren’t enough, Neway created one more, the bitter, unforgiving mother in Fred Ebb and Paul Klein’s 1963 Off-Broadway musical Morning Sun.\n\n10\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nFor the 1960 revival of The Consul, Ross Parmenter in the New York Times said Neway’s Magda was a performance of “stunning impact. . . . It is not often one experiences such a sense of shattering reality in the opera house.” The opera’s fourth revival at City Center opened on March 28, 1962 for four performances (with Neway); the fifth opened on March 17, 1966, for three performances at the company’s new home at Lincoln Center’s New York State Theatre (the cast included Neway, with Sherrill Milnes as John); and the sixth revival, which opened on October 6, 1966, played for two performances. This production marked Neway’s last New York performances in her signature role of Magna, a role she had played for over a period of sixteen years. The revival’s cast also included Julia Migenes. The seventh revival opened on March 27, 1974, for four performances (Olivia Stapp was Magda, and Muriel Costa-Greenspon was The Mother), and the eighth and most recent one opened on March 22, 1975, for two performances (with Stapp and Costa-Greenspon). Besides the 1960 telecast of The Consul, there have been numerous televised versions of the opera. Ken Wlaschin’s Gian Carlo Menotti on Screen: Opera, Dance and Choral Works on Film, Television and Video lists seven other television productions: a May 28, 1951, British telecast on the BBC with Neway and Powers re-creating their original Broadway roles; a February 1952 American version on the Cleveland Play House series; a January 17, 1954, adaptation on Canada’s CBC; another Canadian telecast on March 19, 1959, from a Toronto revival with Neway; an Australian production telecast on December 12, 1962; an Austrian version seen on April 19, 1963; and a 1977 Spoleto Festival production which was telecast on public television on March 29, 1978.\n\nA THURBER CARNIVAL Theatre: ANTA Theatre Opening Date: February 26, 1960 Closing Date: June 25, 1960 Performances: 127 Sketches: James Thurber Music: Don Elliott Based on various short stories and other writings by James Thurber.

Despite the small nine-member cast and four-man orchestra (the Don Elliott Quartet), the enjoyable revue lost money. Perhaps the quirky material would have been better served in an intimate Off-Broadway venue than in a traditional Broadway house. As a result, the revue played for just 127 performances at the ANTA (now Virginia) Theatre, opening there on February 26, 1960. During the following season, the revue was seen at the ANTA for a return engagement of ninety-six additional performances, for a total of 223 Broadway showings (see entry for the second engagement). John McClain in the New York Journal-American noted Thurber’s humor was based on the notion that “somebody is playing a big joke on humans and animals alike,” and Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times said the “freshest and the funniest show of the year” found its humor in the “simple predicament of being alive,” adding that the “wonderful” revue offered a “glorious world of meaningful nonsense.” Walter Kerr in the New York Herald-Tribune found the evening a “sheer delight . . . [a] small, cozy, and completely captivating revue,” and he praised the array of comics who made merry with Thurber’s humor, including Paul Ford, Alice Ghostley, Tom Ewell, Peggy Cass, John McGiver, Peter Turgeon, and Wynne Miller (Kerr noted Cass “achieves the impossible distinction of looking both beautiful and maniacal”); Robert Coleman in the New York Mirror liked the “smart revue,” and praised the “skilled comedians” and the “real cool” Don Elliott Quartet; Frank Aston in the New York World-Telegram liked the “perfect” cast, and told his readers the revue offered the “clean, lovable crackling of sharp fun”; Richard Watts in the New York Post said that “humor and imagination are mixed with a fine, urbane intelligence, there is cause for nothing but delight”; and John Chapman in the New York Daily News gave his readers the address of the ANTA Theatre, noting that “anybody who shuns this house of laughter is crazy.” The evening began and ended with “Word Dance,” in which the players delivered surreal-like one-liners in time to Elliott’s musical accompaniment, comments such as: “Meet Miss Gorse, she’s in embalming”; “He’s having his books translated into French; they lose something in the original”; “How can an explosion increase population?”; and “My husband wanted me to live in sin even after we were married.” Among the sketches were a mini-version of Thurber’s “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” (itself the basis for a 1964 OffBroadway musical of the same name); “The Macbeth Murder Mystery,” in which a mystery-novel fan proves Macbeth is innocent of murder; and “If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox,” in which the dead-drunk Grant is told he’s in the “Appomattox Court House, Virginia,” to which Grant replies, “Don’t call me Virginia.” During the run, two fables in the second act (“The Owl Who Was God” and “The Clothes Moth and the Luna Moth”) were dropped. The cast album was recorded by Columbia Records (LP # KOL-5500 and # KOS-2024, and reissued on # CKOS-2024), and was released on CD by Arkiv Music/Sony Masterworks Broadway Records (# 88691-911382). The script was published in softcover by Samuel French in 1962. Cast member Wynne Miller, who later in the year appeared in Tenderloin, was the niece of legendary band leader Glenn Miller.\n\n12\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nThe London production opened at the Savoy Theatre on April 11, 1962, for twenty-seven performances; Tom Ewell reprised his New York role, and others in the cast were Betty Marsden, Donna Cameron, June Thody, Mary Laura Wood, David Bauer, John Cater, Tom Chatto, Deny Graham, and the Stan Stacey Quartet. The musical director was Johnny (John) Dankworth.

His five Broadway musicals (Where’s Charley? [1948; revived in 1966], Guys and Dolls\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n13\n\n[1950; revived in 1965 and 1966], The Most Happy Fella [1956; revived in 1966], Greenwillow [1960], and How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying [1961; revived in 1966]) were completely different from one another, and ranged from traditional musical comedy to virtually sung-through opera. Guys and Dolls is considered his masterpiece, but perhaps Greenwillow is Loesser’s “desert-island” score. With shimmering, ethereal ballads (“Walking Away Whistling,” “Never Will I Marry,” “Faraway Boy”), full-bodied choral numbers (“The Music of Home,” “Greenwillow Christmas,” “Summertime Love” [the latter was reprised as a gentle solo]), an enchanting promenade that seems to have been composed of musical notes and stardust (“The Autumn Courting” / “The Spring Courting” [titled “Greenwillow Walk” on the cast album]), and alternately jubilant and sardonic comedy numbers (“The Sermon,” “Could’ve Been a Ring,” “What a Blessing,” “He Died Good”), Loesser’s entrancing score for Greenwillow was the finest heard on Broadway since the premiere of Candide in 1956. Greenwillow offers one of the greatest scores in the history of musical theatre. Based on B. J. Chute’s lovely and charming but virtually plotless 1956 novel of the same name, the musical was set in a timeless, geographically vague small village (the novel’s first sentence tells us that “long ago, centuries perhaps, the village of Greenwillow had been stood in the corner and forgotten”) which looked at the lives of its townspeople through the change of seasons. The leading character is Gideon Briggs (Anthony Perkins), who fears he’ll soon fall victim to his family’s curse: the oldest male in each generation is doomed to incessantly wander the earth and can only occasionally return to Greenwillow in order to sire a child and thus perpetuate the family’s curse and bloodline. As a result of Gideon’s fears, he’s wary of committing himself to Dorrie (Ellen McCown), whom he loves. The musical also focused on Greenwillow’s two ministers, Reverend Birdsong (Cecil Kellaway) and Reverend Lapp (William Chapman), both of whom have wildly divergent views of religion; two of Greenwillow’s elders, Grandma Briggs (Pert Kelton) and Thomas Clegg (Lee Cass), who once upon a time had a “cozy close to mostly, mighty near to nearly” relationship; and the various children living in the town, including Gideon’s young brother Jabez Briggs (John Megna, who walked, if not scampered, away with some of the best reviews of the decade). Bruce McKay, Grover Dale, Margery Gray, Marian Mercer, and Jere Admire played other villagers in the large forty-two-member cast. Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times wrote that the musical brought Chute’s novel “to life on the stage just as if it had always been there,” and thanks to the “virtuosity and taste” of the musical’s creators, the “humors and sweetness” of the novel were preserved in an “ideal” libretto. As for Loesser, “out of his bountiful music box” came a “warm and varied score,” and Atkinson singled out “Summertime Love” and “Never Will I Marry” (Perkins’s “first-rate” voice brought a “lonely beauty” to the songs); “Walking Away Whistling” (“rueful”); “Faraway Boy” (“wistful”); “Could’ve Been a Ring” (“good rowdydowdy music”); and “The Sermon” (“irresistible”). He also praised Peter Larkin’s “cut-out village scenery” set against an “epic” willow, and said Joe Layton’s dances were “joyous” (including the show-stopping “Halloweve” ballet in which Master Megna played a pivotal role). John McClain in the New York Journal-American found the book “warm and tasteful” and the score “haunting.” While the music wasn’t as “socko” as the score Loesser composed for Guys and Dolls, it was “musically more ambitious” (he singled out “Summertime Love,” “The Music of Home,” “Gideon Briggs, I Love You,” “The Spring Courting,” and “What a Blessing”). But the remaining five critics were less than enchanted with the musical, and most noted that the plot didn’t go anywhere (one of the main events in the story dealt with the blessing of a cow); but they still found a lot to like in the score, the performances, and the choreography. But with more negative than positive notices, Greenwillow lasted just three months. Robert Coleman in the New York Mirror found the book “sketchy” and the humor “primitive.” He seemed slightly disappointed with the score, but nonetheless added that it had “the stamp of integrity on it” and suggested the “folk opera” score and Don Walker’s skillful orchestrations could easily be transferred directly to the New York City Opera when that company got around to “adding Greenwillow to its roster.” He also praised the “exciting” “Halloweve” ballet. Frank Aston in the New York World-Telegram noted the musical had “flashes of excellence,” the cast was “superb,” and Loesser’s contributions were “worth re-hearing,” but for all that the evening “skittered,” and he wondered what happened to Loesser’s theatrical compass. Richard Watts in the New York Post said the evening had “moments of fresh charm,” but otherwise was “upsettingly flat, stodgy and lacking in emotional effectiveness.” While he praised the cast, the choreography, and the scenic design, he felt Loesser’s score “rarely represents him at his best . . . [but] a few of the numbers are of the expected excellence.”\n\n14\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nJohn Chapman in the New York Daily News liked the “robust, lilting . . . charming . . . splendid” songs, and said the company was “one of the best.” But he noted he was “blessed if I can tell you just what it is about.” Besides the score and the cast, he also liked the beguiling dances (particularly the “fanciful” “Halloweve”). But he cautioned that his review was an “incomplete report, because I have not yet figured Greenwillow out.” He promised to see the musical again, and if it turned out he was “just plain stupid” on opening night, he would file a second review. Walter Kerr in the New York Herald-Tribune said Greenwillow was theatrically “nowhere—not in Brigadoon, not in Glocca Morra,” and he chided the musical’s creators for their “do-it-yourself folklore,” which “may just be the one dish in the world that can’t be cooked to order.” But he noted that Loesser’s contributions were “honorably done,” and he singled out “The Sermon” (a lively “brimstone-and-peaches duet”); “Could’ve Been a Ring” (“a jiggy little melody”); and “The Music of Home” (when the chorus attacks “the rafters” with this number, “you do suddenly wish that these robust yeomen did have a home of their own”). He also noted that “few musicals” could boast the “legitimate, fiery-eyed intensity” that Perkins brought to his role, and he praised the “imaginative improvisation” of Layton’s “Halloweve” ballet. Two songs in the musical make interesting companions to songs introduced on Broadway during the two seasons following Greenwillow’s premiere. “He Died Good” was a tongue-in-cheek threnody about the unmourned death of the town’s Scrooge, a character who’ll be as little missed as the late husband in Johnny Burke’s mock-lament “Sad Was the Day” from Donnybrook! (1961). In “Faraway Boy,” Dorrie muses that because the “born to wander” Gideon is the first man to win her heart, any future lover must be indebted to him. Stephen Sondheim’s “That’ll Show Him” from A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962) was completely different in style and tone from “Faraway Boy,” but it too found the heroine noting that any spark she brought to a second romance was due to her first one. During the tryout, the following songs were deleted: “My Beauty,” “A-Tangle, A-Dangle,” “The Call to Wander,” “A Head on Her Shoulders,” “Yes,” and “Riddleweed.” Zeme North was replaced by Ellen McCown in the role of Dorrie. Earlier in the 1959–1960 season, North made her first and only Broadway appearance in the role of Robert Morse’s sister Mildred in Take Me Along. As for McCown, she appeared in just two Broadway musicals; besides Greenwillow, she had a major role in the 1951 musical Seventeen (with Dick Kallman, she introduced “After All, It’s Spring,” the score’s finest number). Songs written for, but never used in, Greenwillow were: “Amos Long Entrance,” “All A-Tousle” (an early version of “A-Tangle, A-Dangle”), “Buzz a Buzz,” “Percussion Ballad,” “Heart of Stone,” and “Down in the Barley.” Although not listed in Playbill, the brief song “Blasphemy” (for Gideon) may have been performed in the Broadway production. Except for “Yes,” all the lyrics for the used, cut, and unused songs can be found in the collection The Complete Lyrics of Frank Loesser (published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2003, and edited by Robert Kimball and Steve Nelson). (The book’s index indicates the lyric of “Yes” is on page 212, but the song is unaccountably omitted from the collection.) The cast album of Greenwillow was originally scheduled for recording by Columbia Records, and it was assigned release numbers (LP # OL-5470 and # OS-2022). However, the album was instead recorded and released by RCA Victor Records (LP # LOCD/LSOD-2001). Since Anthony Perkins had previously recorded for RCA, it’s possible that at the time of Greenwillow’s production he was still under contract to RCA and thus was precluded from recording for another company. So if RCA did indeed pull an Abbe Lane on him and didn’t allow him to record for Columbia, then perhaps there was no choice but for the musical’s producers to sign with another company, in this case, Perkins’s home company of RCA. Abbe Lane was under contract to RCA, and under its terms wasn’t allowed to record for other companies; although she was the female lead in the 1958 musical Oh Captain!, she couldn’t participate in Columbia Records’ cast recording of the show, and so for the album her role was assumed by Eileen Rodgers. Later, on a pop album for RCA, Lane recorded two songs from the musical, her saucy “Femininity” (here she complains that whenever she’s with a man she always finds herself staring at the ceiling) and “We’re Not Children” (which in the show was performed by Jacquelyn McKeever and Paul Valentine). RCA also issued a lavish limited-edition numbered and boxed set of Greenwillow, whose cover was festooned with willow leaves. The recording “returned” to Columbia when it was reissued under the Columbia Special Products label (LP # P-13974), and the CD was issued by DRG Records (# 19006). Music from Frank Loesser’s “Greenwillow” was an instrumental reading of the score by the Melachrino Strings that was released by RCA (LP # LSP-2229). The unused song “Heart of Stone” was recorded by Loesser’s daughter Emily\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n15\n\nfor the collection Loesser by Loesser: A Salute to Frank Loesser (DRG Records CD # S-170), which also included a medley of songs from Greenwillow (“Summertime Love,” “Gideon Briggs, I Love You,” “The Music of Home,” and “Never Will I Marry”) performed by Emily Loesser, Jo Sullivan Loesser (Loesser’s widow, who created the role of Amy/Rosabella in The Most Happy Fella), and Don Stephenson. The collection Frank Loesser Revisited (Painted Smiles Records CD # PSCD-115) includes “Bless This Day” (sung by Emily Loesser). The liner notes indicate the song may have been intended for Greenwillow, but the Complete Lyrics reveals that the song’s manuscript is dated October 1960, some seven months after Greenwillow’s Broadway premiere. It’s more likely the song was intended for How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying. The musical was revived by the Equity Library Theatre for the period December 3–20, 1970. As for scene-stealer John Megna, the seven-year-old boy must have certainly walked away whistling, what with the rave reviews he received from all seven New York critics. McClain noted Greenwillow couldn’t fail as long as two and a half members of the cast were in the show, Perkins, Kellaway, and the “preposterous” Megna, “who isn’t really big enough to add up to half an actor.” McClain said that “Master Megna . . . naturally stole every scene in which he appeared, and completely took charge of the ‘Halloweve’ ballet . . . [he] sings, dances, and is thrown around the premises like a basketball, enjoying every minute of it.” Chapman began his review by praising “a captivating small boy whom I cannot identify from the program,” and ended the review with a “P.S. The little boy who stole the show is named John Megna.” Aston found Megna a “whiz,” Coleman found him “impish,” and Watts said he “has the usual little boy actor’s success.” Atkinson noted the “business-like tot . . . brings down the house,” and Kerr said the boy had a “fine time giving the devil a bit more than his due” in the “Halloweve” ballet. After his appearance as Jabez, John Megna was seen the following season as Rufus, the little boy whose father dies, in Tad Mosel’s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama All the Way Home, which was based on James Agee’s 1958 Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel A Death in the Family. But Megna is best known for his performance as Dill, the quirky little boy in the 1962 film version of Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Incidentally, Megna was actress and singer Connie Stevens’s half-brother, and his sister Ave Marie Megna appeared in the 1963 Off-Broadway musical Morning Sun, one of Fred Ebb’s earliest New York musicals.\n\nAwards Tony Nominations: Leading Actor in a Musical (Tony Perkins); Featured Actress in a Musical (Pert Kelton); Conductor and Musical Director (Abba Bogin); Scenic Designer for a Musical (Peter Larkin); Costumer Designer (Alvin Colt); Choreographer (Joe Layton); Stage Technician (James Orr)\n\nBYE BYE BIRDIE “A NEW MUSICAL” Theatre: Martin Beck Theatre (during run, the musical first transferred to the Shubert Theatre and then to the 54th Street Theatre) Opening Date: April 14, 1960 Closing Date: October 7, 1961 Performances: 607 Book: Michael Stewart Lyrics: Lee Adams Music: Charles Strouse Direction and Choreography: Gower Champion; Producers: Edward Padula in association with L.

Written by Norton, Goldstein, and Carol, and sung by Genee Harris, the song wondered how America’s teenagers would cope without Elvis, “Hound Dog,” and “Don’t Be Cruel” (and just what would they sing and dance to after school?). But somehow the country survived, and the nation got through Elvis’s stint in the Army (and so did Elvis). Two years later, Broadway saw a spoof of the Elvis-into-the-Army phenomenon with Bye Bye Birdie, in which the about-to-be-drafted rock ’n’ roll superstar Conrad Birdie (Dick Gautier) sings “One Last Kiss” on national television to lucky Kim MacAfee (Susan Watson), a teenager from Sweet Apple, Ohio. The musical dealt with both the MacAfee family’s newfound celebrity when Kim is chosen for the signal honor of receiving Conrad’s last kiss on The Ed Sullivan Show as well as the on-again, off-again romance of Conrad’s manager Albert Peterson (Dick Van Dyke) and Peterson’s secretary Rosie (Chita Rivera), who, like Adelaide in Guys and Dolls, has been waiting a long time for that trip to the altar. Unlike Adelaide, Rosie has to deal with a troublesome prospective mother-in-law in Mae Peterson (Kay Medford), who’s convinced that Allentown, Pennsylvania–born Rosie is really a hot tamale from south of the border. But all ends well: Birdie goes into the Army, sanity is restored to the MacAfee household, Kim can resume being a normal teenager and date her boyfriend Hugo (Michael J. Pollard), and Albert decides it’s high time he untied the silver cord and tied the knot with Rosie. The production marked the first time Gower Champion had both directed and choreographed a book musical (he had earlier choreographed the 1948 revues Small Wonder and Lend an Ear and the 1951 musical Make a Wish; and in 1955 choreographed, directed, and starred in the revue 3 for Tonight), and with the success of Bye Bye Birdie he was soon one of the most sought-after directors and choreographers of the era. His\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n17\n\nlater successes included Carnival! (1961; 719 performances), Hello, Dolly! (1964; 2,844 performances), I Do! I Do! (1966; 561 performances), and 42nd Street (1980; 3,486 performances). Bye Bye Birdie also introduced the team of Charles Strouse and Lee Adams to Broadway, and their lively score for Birdie offered a number of popular hits (“Put on a Happy Face,” “A Lot of Livin’ to Do,” and the Charleston-inspired “Kids!”). Brooks Atkinson in the New York Times felt the two stories, one of Birdie, Kim, and the issues surrounding the nationwide “one last kiss,” and the other of the Albert-Rosie-Mae “triangle,” never quite meshed, and while the opening night audience was “beside itself with pleasure,” he was “able to contain” himself. He concluded that Birdie was “neither fish, fowl nor good musical comedy. It needs work.” But he praised the cast, including Paul Lynde, Michael J. Pollard, and “the very funny dame” Kay Medford. He also noted Champion had devised “original” dances, including the nightmarish dream ballet “How to Kill a Man” (in which Rosie conjures up macabre ways to do away with the marriage-phobic Albert) and the “jumping-jack vaudeville” of the “Shriners’ Ballet” (in which Rosie inadvertently gets mixed up with some randy Shriners). Although Walter Kerr in the New York Herald-Tribune felt Michael Stewart’s book sometimes started “to break down and cry,” Lee’s lyrics leaned toward a “‘talk-out-the-plot’ routine,” and Strouse’s “jaunty” music was “whisper-thin,” he nonetheless enjoyed the evening and the performers, and singled out “How to Kill a Man” (“a very nice nightmare of firing squads, tumbrils, and what I took to be the Mafia”) and the even “greater inventiveness” of the “Shriners’ Ballet” (Rivera was “exhilarating” in this “impudent” dance sequence). Richard Watts in the New York Post found the new musical “bright and delightful,” saying the evening offered “fun and surprising charm.” He praised the “excellent” dances (including the “hilarious” “Shriners’ Ballet”), said the score had “freshness and imagination,” and noted that “rare and intelligent taste” was shown by having the evening end not with an “elaborate chorus number” but instead with Van Dyke and Rivera singing a “simple and charming romantic” song (“Rosie”) on a bare stage. John Chapman in the New York Daily News said Birdie was one of the “funniest, most captivating and most expert musical comedies one could hope to see in several seasons of showgoing . . . pure, plain musical comedy . . . a happy, zestful, clean, smart musical.” Frank Aston in the New York World-Telegram wrote that as far as musicals went, Birdie was “the peak of the season . . . what a show!”; John McClain in the New York Journal-American found the musical “bright, new, funny, fast, [and] crazy,” and praised the “gay and frivolous and unpretentious score”; and Robert Coleman in the New York Mirror said the show “looks like a champ” with its “satiric, tuneful, fast-stepping material.” The dances “How to Kill a Man” and “Shriners’ Ballet” received rave reviews from the critics, but ironically these two numbers have all but disappeared from subsequent revivals of the show (the film offered a truncated version of the latter as “The Sultans’ Ballet”). But the celebrated “Telephone Hour” has in one form or another remained with the musical in its later incarnations. For this song, Champion and scenic designer Robert Randolph came up with the ingenious notion of having the teenagers sing snatches of their telephone conversations on a huge three-story multi-leveled jungle gym of a set which incorporated separate cubicles for each teenager. The hardback script was belatedly published by DBS Publications in 1968. The original cast album was released by Columbia Records (LP # KOL/OL-5510 and KOS/OS-2025). The CD was issued by Sony Classical/Columbia/Legacy Records (# SK-89254), and includes a bonus track of Charles Strouse performing “Put on a Happy Face.” It appears that an early version of this song (as well as an early version of “Once Upon a Time” from All American [1962]) was first heard in the 1958 regional revue Take Me to Your Leader. (An early version of “Once Upon a Time” seems to have also been heard in the 1957 regional revue Off the Top, which opened in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on May 11, 1957, at the Craft Theatre.) The score’s demo recording by Adams and Strouse includes the unused song “All Woman.” The song “Older and Wiser” wasn’t used in Birdie (early on it was replaced by “What Did I Ever See in Him?”), but was recorded for the collection Lost in Boston III (Varese Sarabande Records CD # VSD-5563). The London production opened at Her Majesty’s Theatre on June 15, 1961, for 268 performances; Chita Rivera reprised her role of Rosie, Peter Marshall was Albert, and other cast members included Angela Baddeley (Mae) and Marty Wilde (Birdie). The cast recording was released by Mercury Records (LP # MGW-13000; the CD was issued by Decca Broadway Records # 314-586-432-2). The reasonably faithful 1963 film version found Dick Van Dyke reprising his original role of Albert, and the cast included Janet Leigh (Rosie), Ann-Margret (her performance suggests Kim attended high schools in\n\n18\n\nTHE COMPLETE BOOK OF 1960S BROADWAY MUSICALS\n\nboth Sweet Apple and Las Vegas), Maureen Stapleton (Mae), Bobby Rydell (Hugo), Jessie Pearson (Birdie), and Paul Lynde (as Mr. MacAfee, here reprising his Broadway role). Ed Sullivan appeared as himself. The film included one new number, a title song that was sung both in pre-credit and ending sequences by Ann-Margret. The film was directed by George Stevens, choreographed by Onna White, and the screenplay was by Irving Brecher. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor Records (LP # LOC/LS0-1081-RE), and a later CD release by RCA/BMG Heritage Records (# 82876-54217-2) included three outtakes, “We Love You, Conrad,” “One Last Kiss” (gym rehearsal version), and “The Sultans’ Ballet.” Bobby Rydell also recorded an album of songs from the musical on Cameo Records (LP # C-1043); for the recording, “How Lovely to Be a Woman” was refashioned for Rydell as “How Lovely to Love a Woman.” In 1989, the musical was revived by The Muny in St. Louis, Missouri, with Tommy Tune (Albert), Ann Reinking (Rosie), Marcia Lewis (Mae), Alan Sues (Mr. MacAfee), and Susan Egan (Kim). In 1991, a national tour of the musical found Tune and Reinking reprising their Muny roles; the delightful production included one new song,” Take a Giant Step” (for Albert), and, in a nod to political correctness, Rosie’s tongue-in-cheek “Spanish Rose” was reworked as “He’s Mine” for Rosie and Mae. The cast included Egan, Marilyn Cooper (Mae), and Marc Kudisch (Birdie). On December 3, 1995, a dreary television adaptation of the musical was seen on ABC; directed by Gene Saks and choreographed by Ann Reinking, the cast included Jason Alexander (Albert), Vanessa Williams (Rosie), Tyne Daly (Mae), Marc Kudisch (Birdie), Chynna Phillips (Kim), George Wendt (Mr. MacAfee), and Sally Mayes (Mrs. MacAfee). Two songs were written for this version, “Let’s Settle Down” (for Rosie) and “When a Mother Doesn’t Matter Anymore” (Daly). The production included the film’s title song as well as “Take a Giant Step” from the 1991 tour; “Spanish Rose” was also included. The soundtrack was released by RCA Victor Records (CD # 09026-68356-2), and the DVD by Crown/America Video. On October 15, 2009, Birdie was revived on Broadway for the first time, in a production by the Roundabout Theatre Company at Henry Miller’s (now Stephen Sondheim) Theatre for 117 performances. The cast of the rather cooly received production included John Stamos (Albert), Gina Gershon (Rose), Bill Irwin (Mr. MacAfee), Dee Hoty (Mrs. MacAfee), Nolan Gerard Funk (Birdie), and Jayne Houdyshell (Mae). The production included the title song written for the film version and reinstated “Spanish Rose,” but didn’t use the new songs written for the 1991 tour and 1995 television version. In preproduction, Bye Bye Birdie was first known as Love and Kisses and then later as Let’s Go Steady. Twenty-one years after Birdie’s Broadway opening, Michael Stewart, Lee Adams, and Charles Strouse wrote a sequel to the musical called Bring Back Birdie, set twenty years after the original story took place. The show opened on March 5, 1981, at the Martin Beck (now Hirschfeld) Theatre, the home of the original production. Albert and Rosie are now married, and Rosie’s wish has come true: Albert is an English teacher. But he’s called back into show business when the producers of the Grammy Awards offer him twenty-thousand dollars to find Conrad Birdie so that the former rock ’n’ roll star can be part of a tribute to former pop singers on the upcoming award show. It seems Birdie has drifted into obscurity, and so it’s up to Albert to track him down. Donald O’Connor played Albert, and Chita Rivera reprised her original role of Rosie. Albert’s mother Mae also figured into the plot, and this time around was played by Maria Karnilova. Birdie was played by real-life Elvis impersonator Marcel Forestieri, and Maurice Hines played a detective. Joe Layton directed and choreographed the musical, which was lambasted by the critics for its lame plot and weak score (Joel Siegel on WABC-TV said that while Bye Bye Birdie “cooked,” Bring Back Birdie was “defrosted”), and so the musical closed after just four performances. Although not listed in the Playbill, the score interpolated “Rosie” from the original production, and the number was included on the cast album issued by Original Cast Records (LP # OC-8132; later issued on CD by Varese Sarabande Records # VSD-5440). Sequels were not kind to Charles Strouse. Annie 2: Miss Hannigan’s Revenge, with Dorothy Loudon reprising her role of Miss Hannigan, was probably the most anticipated musical of the 1989–1990 season. But the sour sequel to Annie (1977) was a cheerless affair, and closed at the Kennedy Center prior to its scheduled Broadway premiere. Incidentally, Bye Bye Birdie was one of fourteen Broadway plays and musicals whose poster artwork was featured on colorful tiles/trivets released in the early 1960s by a company called Theatre Tiles. Besides Birdie, the following shows were represented in the series: Becket, Camelot, Carnival!, Do Re Mi, Fiorello!, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Gypsy, Irma La Douce, Milk and Honey, My Fair Lady, No Strings, A Shot in the Dark, and The Unsinkable Molly Brown (although the tiles were released in the early 1960s, a few shows in the series had opened in the 1950s).\n\n1959–1960 SEASON\n\n19\n\nAwards Tony Awards and Nominations: Best Musical (Bye Bye Birdie);

There was also a twenty-seventh number (“&”), the song “What Next?,” which was performed for the finale. Today the revue is best remembered for introducing Jerry Herman, Fred Ebb, and Woody Allen to Broadway. The opening number (“Best Gold”) was by Herman, whose previous musicals, all revues, had been produced Off-Broadway (I Feel Wonderful [1954], Nightcap [1958], and Parade, the latter of which opened on January 20, 1960, three months before the premiere of From A to Z).
