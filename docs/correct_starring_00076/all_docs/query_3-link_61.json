        "text": "Taking off from my recently published list of my 50 most wanted films, this is the start of a new series which I’m calling Most Wanted Films Found (MWFF). As some of the films on that list are easier to track down than others, I decided that, once the list was up, I would try to start crossing films off of it. And I decided to start with a film which I had already missed one window of opportunity to see and wasn’t going to waste another: Ernest Pintoff’s 1965 comedy, Harvey Middleman, Fireman.\n\nFirst, a quick rundown of the story:\n\nHarvey Middleman (Eugene Troobnick) is a New York City fireman, living a cheerfully average life in the New Jersey suburbs with his wife Harriet (Arlene Golonka) and two young children. One day, responding to an apartment fire, he rescues pretty young Lois (Patricia Harty), and they impulsively kiss. Harvey grows infatuated with her, and the feeling seems to be mutual; meanwhile, he begins to lose his temper at Harriet and his co-workers more frequently.\n\nWhile trying to decide just what to do about his feelings for Lois, Harvey decides he needs professional help, and consults Mrs. Koogleman (Hermione Gingold), a psychiatrist working for the city health department, who seems more than a bit preoccupied with her own affairs.\n\nMy rationale:\n\nAnimator Pintoff made his live-action debut (he also wrote the script) with this comedy about a Walter Mitty-ish fireman, and what happens when he rescues his literal dream girl (shades of Brazil?). Hermione Gingold plays his psychiatrist, which in of itself sounds quite promising. I’m also quite curious to see how Pintoff adapted his style to live actors (notably, he seems not to have returned to animation thereafter), and from I’ve read it sounds like an agreeably offbeat diversion, if not a lost classic.\n\nIt’s incredibly obscure and will probably never see the light of day on home video…but it can be found online. (I had actually been able to find it online at one point, then lamented when the upload was removed; that’s how long I’ve been working on this post.)\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI’ll start by saying I was fairly mistaken about the film’s basic premise; there’s nothing Mitty-ish about Harvey, and Lois doesn’t appear in his dreams prior to their first meeting. I’m not sure quite where I got the notion that she did, but it matters not.\n\nIn retrospect, Harvey feels a bit like a proto-Annie Hall; Harvey breaks the fourth-wall frequently, he’s a quintessential New York-Jewish nebbish (albeit living in a WASPy suburb), and the film makes use of comic flashbacks to his childhood and adolescence (in which, regardless of age, Harvey is played by Troobnick). And, assuming Harvey is coded as Jewish, his relationship with the cool blonde Lois anticipates Alvy and Annie’s. Unfortunately, there the similarities end; Harvey is nowhere near as funny, incisive, inventive, or touching as Annie Hall (though not many films are).\n\nPintoff’s script is a big part of the problem; it lacks much in the way of wit or depth. Why Harvey would be tempted to cheat on Harriet in the first place, let alone why he lets the affair with Lois go as far as it does (it’s not clear if they sleep together or not, but the relationship definitely lasts at least a few weeks), is never really made clear. At one point, Harvey admits he misses how, in the early days of their marriage, Harriet was more dependent upon him, but this facet of his character isn’t really explored. As for the dialogue, it’s not bad, but it’s not particularly memorable either; it’s mostly sitcom-level humor.\n\nHis direction doesn’t do all that much to help, and aside from the flashbacks (which are monochrome with a heavy yellow tint for some reason), there’s not much visual flair on display. Compared to, say, Frank Tashlin, whose background in animation shone through in his live-action work (just look at the brilliant The Girl Can’t Help It), Pintoff’s handling of Harvey is nothing special. Admittedly, he isn’t helped by the obviously low budget he had to work with, or the fairly terrible editing.\n\nThe editing really does bring the film down a few notches; at times, it feels like the idea was to spoof or ape the fragmented editing increasingly in vogue at the time, but especially in the second half of the film it makes the story seem merely disjointed, all the way up to the abrupt, unsatisfying conclusion. While there’s no firm evidence either way, the film’s choppiness and brief length (a mere 76 minutes) leads me to suspect the studio stepped in to re-cut it.\n\nThere are good things here, to be sure. Troobnick is quite solid as Harvey; coming off a bit like a cuddlier Alan Arkin, he makes Harvey a much more likable and engaging character than he really has any right to be. Mostly a character actor in film and TV (he also worked a lot on the stage), this was most likely Troobnick’s only shot at playing the lead in a film, and he does quite well. He gets far more room to shine than anyone else in the cast, but as the women in his life, Golonka and Harty both do pretty well.\n\nGingold, I’m sorry to say, just doesn’t get much to do; Mrs. Koogleman is always cutting their appointments short or being cut off by the haphazard editing, and aside from one dream sequence where she reads a children’s book to an infantilized Harvey, she isn’t able to do much with the thin material. I should also note that Charles Durning makes his film debut as one of Harvey’s fellow firemen, and his brand of surly charm is always very welcome.\n\nUltimately, what strikes me about Harvey is how much, in hindsight, it feels as if it were caught between two eras. It’s a last gasp of the sitcommy little comedies the major studios used to put on the bottom half of double bills and a late example of the 50s sitcom ethos, but it’s also hinting at the culture shift which was about to shake up Hollywood for good, and at the character-driven comedy-dramas which would soon supplant the kind of pleasant little films that Harvey defines; films that would be edgier, funnier, and more thoughtful.\n\nHarvey isn’t a bad film, it just lacks much beyond a good lead performance to make it memorable. I’m glad I was able to see it, but I’m also glad I wasn’t really expecting much from it. I will say, though, that it’s the only film I’ve seen to date which directly references Kenneth Patchen. So that’s something."
