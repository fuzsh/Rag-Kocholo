(Posted December 15)\n\nDVD Collectibles:\n\nAt the very first Academy Awards in May, 1929, two directors cemented their place in cinematic history as F.W. Murnau's \"Sunrise\" took home the prize for Unique and Artistic Picture and Frank Borzage garnered Best Director for \"7th Heaven.\" At the time, both men were under contract with William Fox, owner of Fox Film Corp., who had invested heavily on making sure that movie directors were the stars of his films, gambling that audiences would gravitate to strong stories told by brilliant filmmakers. These awards validated Fox's vision for movies as an art form and these two director's craft. (Posted December 8)\n\nFox Home Entertainment releases this week a collection saluting Murnau and Borzage, whose daring camera movements and visually extravagant styles were integral in the development of modern movies and the studio that allowed them to flourish with \"Murnau, Borzage and Fox.\" Celebrating their collected works, their influence on director's to follow and their collaborations with William Fox in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the set features 12 films from the Hollywood legends including newly remastered versions of Murnau's \"Sunrise\" and Borzage's \"7th Heaven,\" as well as an all-new feature length documentary from filmmaker John Cork. Additionally, the set features two exclusive hard-cover books showcasing rare, unpublished photos from the careers of both filmmakers, one of which focuses solely on Murnau's \"4 Devils,\" the lost film considered by those that saw it to be the greatest movie ever made, pushing the boundaries of what Hollywood movies were at the time.\n\nWhile his career was cut short due to a fatal auto accident in 1931 at the age of 42, the impact of Murnau on the film community can still be felt to this day. William Fox brought the expressionist director from Germany to Hollywood after he saw his 1924 film \"The Last Laugh.\" Borzage's career at Fox lasted only seven years, but it would be the silent films he helmed at the studio that would come to define his career as he won the first Best Director Oscar for \"7th Heaven\" and again in 1931 for \"Bad Girl.\"\n\nA rich collection of true historical significance, \"Murnau, Borzage & Fox\" will be available for a suggested retail price of $239.99.

(Posted December 1)\n\nThere's a nice medley of releases this week from the impetuous folks at The Criterion Collection: In \"Bottle Rocket\" (1996), Wes Anderson first illustrated his lovingly detailed, slightly surreal cinematic vision in this witty and warm portrait of three young middle-class misfits. Fresh out of a mental hospital, gentle Anthony (Luke Wilson) finds himself once again embroiled in the machinations of his best friend, elaborate schemer Dignan (Owen Wilson). With the aid of getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave), they develop a needlessly complex, mildly successful plan to rob a small bookstore-then go \"on the lam.\" Also featuring Lumi Cavazos as Inez, the South American housekeeper Anthony falls in love with, and James Caan as local thief extraordinaire Mr. Henry, \"Bottle Rocket\" is a charming, hilarious, affectionate look at the folly of dreamers. Shot against radiant southwestern backdrops, it's the film that put Anderson and the Wilson brothers on the map. On standard DVD and Blu-ray Disc. In a new, restored high-definition digital transfer supervised and approved by director Wes Anderson and director of photography Robert Yeoman; Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 on Blu-ray).

In a new, restored high-definition digital transfer on standard DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack supervised by director Wong Kar Wai (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 on Blu-ray) ... and lastly there's \"The Spy Who Came in From The Cold\" (1965). John Le Carre's acclaimed bestselling novel, about a Cold War spy on one final, dangerous mission, is every bit as precise and ruthless onscreen in this adaptation directed by Martin Ritt. Richard Burton delivers one of his career-defining performances as Alec Leamas, whose hesitant but deeply felt relationship with a beautiful librarian (Claire Bloom) puts what he hopes will be his last assignment, in East Germany, in jeopardy.
