        "text": "A computer animated movie that I feel is underrated is Surf's Up. Monster House was also pretty good. Wall-E and UP! are pretty spectacular.\n\nFor super heroes there's Batman: Assault on Arkham, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (although it makes more sense if you watched the TV series), Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Batman: Under the Red Mask, Batman and Superman Movie: World's Finest, Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox, Planet Hulk, and Megamind,\n\nOn the hand-drawn side I would recommend Winnie The Pooh (2011) it was made as a swan song for Winnie (and hand-drawn in general) movies. I would also like to toss in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Akira plays more like a horror movie if you are looking for something more intense. Persepolis is great if your looking for a more character-driven movie. A Goofy Movie if you want feel good family fun. If you want a sense of adventure The Brave Little Toaster and Treasure Planet, If you want more of an epic there's The Prince of Egypt (if you don't mind religious stories), If you want just great storytelling then look up The Great Mouse Detective, An American Tail, and All Dogs Go To Heaven. For cult classic territory there is The Sword in the Stone, Antz, and The Triplets of Belleville. If you want more music focused films there's Fantasia 2000 and Yellow Submarine are in your spirits. And finally if you want princesses I recommend Anastasia and Thumbelina.\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nR23’s list is tasteful & comprehensive, and the best so far in this thread. Allow me to second ANASTASIA & THUMBELINA, AN AMERICAN TAIL (and the sequel FIEVEL GOES WEST), THE PRINCE OF EGYPT (if you need to cry your feelings out), BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD (another one to cry over, Jason Todd is so tragic), ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN (will melt a heart of stone tbh), BASIL THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, A GOOFY MOVIE (and the sequel AN EXTREMELY GOOFY MOVIE), and SURF’S UP (truly underrated, with a killer OST).\n\nAnother poster said THE SECRET OF NIMH, which is an exquisite choice and Bluth’s finest work. THE IRON GIANT is beautiful beyond belief. FANTASTIC MR. FOX is quotable even long after you first see it.\n\nEMPEROR’S NEW GROOVE, TREASURE PLANET (underrated), MULAN, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (that score!) & SLEEPING BEAUTY are the best Disney recs from upthread so far imo. Unpopular opinion but THE LION KING II: SIMBA’S PRIDE had a better story & songs than the original, and ALADDIN & THE KING OF THIEVES was far more intricate & interesting than the first ALADDIN film.\n\nI’ll add some of my favorites: WATERSHIP DOWN, ONCE UPON A FOREST & THE PLAGUE DOGS (none of these for young kids or depressed adults, though), Disney’s THE FOX & THE HOUND (even though it is very unfaithful to the book and to real life, it has great gay subtext) & HERCULES (ditto), BALTO (and the sequel WOLF’S QUEST), and SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON (Dreamworks’ most underrated picture, with excellent songs by Bryan Adams).\n\nTitan AE: haven't thought of that film in ages! It's been about 15 years since I've seen it and I'm pretty surprised to learn about how badly it flopped and how it only has a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes. I don't remember all of it, but I do remember enjoying it a lot and thinking it had a kickass soundtrack. Granted, I was just a kid when I saw it, but I was a kid with discriminating taste. I thought Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was crap, didn't like Antz, was disappointed by Pokemon: The First Movie, found The Road to El Dorado to be just ok, and didn't really understand all the fuss about Finding Nemo.\n\nNow I have the urge to re-watch Titan AE as an adult and see how it holds up.\n\nBTW the movie has a scene where the main character (voiced by DL fave Matt Damon) is completely naked as he's being treated in a medical facility of some sort. It's something I distinctly remember from viewing it as a gayling.\n\nThe best animated film of all-time, at least on a technical level, is Richard Williams' THE THIEF AND THE COBBLER. It was in and out of production for over 30 years and then it was bought and butchered by Miramax in the 90s and was never finished. The quality of the animation, all hand drawn by some of the best animators of all-time, is phenomenal. If you can get hold of a copy of \"The Recobbled Cut\", which is a fan-made reconstruction of the film, and uses bits of unfinished workprint or still frames to give you an idea of the bits that weren't finished. It's incredible, but also very sad considering its fate and the hard work and time that went into it.\n\nAlso, Disney--who owned Miramax by then--stole lots of stuff from the film for their later, lesser movies..."
