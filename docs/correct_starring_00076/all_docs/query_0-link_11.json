        "text": "Eight years before Disney released their romantic tale of cats in Paris, The Aristocats (1970), Abe Levitow directed Gay Purr-ee, a superficially similar tale set in late 19th century France. It was produced by United Productions of America (UPA), their second and last feature-length animation after the Mr Magoo “starring” 1001 Arabian Nights (1959) and was the first to be distributed by Warner Bros. When Warners found out that the film was written by their own Chuck Jones (in collaboration with his wife Dorothy), they invoked an exclusivity clause in his contract and fired him, leading to Jones taking many of his old colleagues off to form the independent Sib Tower 12 Productions that would make the late run of Tom and Jerry cartoons.\n\nFor all its flaws, The Aristocats handled the superficially similar basic story far better than Levitow and the Jones’. In 1895, on a small farm in rural Provence, Mewsette the cat (voiced by Judy Garland, nearing end of her film career and making her only role in voice acting) is courted by the local mouser Jaune Tom (singer Robert Goulet) but she rejects him as a “clumsy country clod” and sets her sights on the glamour of Paris. She runs away, hopping a train to the city and runs into the caddish Meowrice (Paul Frees) who places her in the care of Madame Henretta Reubens-Chatte (Hermione Gingold), promising to transform her into a debutante. His real plan is to sell her off as a mail-order bride to a rich American cat, Mr Henry Phtt of Pittsburgh. Jaune Tom and his enthusiastic kitten friend Robespierre (Red Buttons) soon arrive in Paris looking for Mewsette and the race is on to rescue her before Meowrice can pack her off to the States.\n\nLevitow had worked with Jones at the Warner Bros. cartoon unit, affectionately known as “Termite Terrace,” and had jumped ship for UPA earlier, directing 1001 Arabian Nights for them, as well as the first American made-for-television animated special, Mister Magoo’s Christmas Carol, broadcast the day after Gay Purr-ee was released theatrically in December 1962 (the ubiquitous Mel Blanc, voice of all of the classic Warner Bros. animated characters, was also on hand). Sadly, Gay Purr-ee abandons the anarchic, often surreal madness of the best of the Looney Tunes with a more whimsical and conventional humour and Jones, a master of the animated short form, fared less well at feature length, struggling to fill the 85-minute running time with interesting incident and allowing the story to meander aimlessly too often.\n\nThe many songs were written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg who, nearly a quarter of a century earlier, had written the songs for The Wizard of Oz (1939) which had, of course, also starred Garland. There’s nothing here to rival such immortal classics as Over the Rainbow, Follow the Yellow Brick Road or We’re Off to See the Wizard, though their ditties are pleasant enough if largely forgettable. That said, Little Drops of Rain, released as a single in the UK and the States in 1962 with Paris is a Lonely Town on the B-side, is rather lovely and Garland herself claimed it to be one of her favourites.\n\nGarland heads an unusually starry cast for an animated feature. Today, we fully expected our feature-length animations to be packed to the rafters with the pick of the Hollywood crop, but it was an unusual move back in 1962 – so unusual in fact that Garland’s billing on some of the posters is bigger than the title of the film itself. Goulet made his film debut voicing Jaune Tom (he’d just come off a successful run as Lancelot in the Broadway production of Lerner and Loewe’s Camelot), the unmistakable tones of Red Button are perhaps a little too abrasive to playing a tiny if exuberant kitten and Gingold could, perhaps, have been given more to do, but overall, this was an impressive roster of names for what would still have been considered a “kid’s cartoon” at the time. As well as Blanc, other familiar voices filling up the supporting roles include those of The Mellomen, the popular singing quartet who had appeared in Disney’s Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953), Lady and the Tramp (1955), The Jungle Book (1967) and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977), along with the original voice of Kellogg’s Tony the Tiger and also frequent Disney collaborator, Thurl Ravenscroft.\n\nThe animation is more limited than the Disney films – UPA had pioneered a simpler style and their budgets were lower than Disneys – the characters less detailed and more static. Gay Purr-ee‘s visual masterstroke was the way the backgrounds often mimicked the styles of famous French artists (or at least those with French connections, many of them post-impressionists) like Paul Cézanne, Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso,Auguste Renoir,Henri Rousseau, andHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The effect is striking and gives Gay Purr-ee a unique look, though sadly it can’t resist the temptation to bring the already flagging plot to a complete standstill while it lectures its young, and probably couldn’t-care-less audience on the styles of each artist."
