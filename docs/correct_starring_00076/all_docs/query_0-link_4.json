        "text": "Gay Purr-ee (1962)\n\nFor some odd reason, animated films with singing cats must be set in France. As you see above this sentence, I am not writing on Wolfgang Reitherman's The Aristocats (1970) released by Disney, but Abe Levitow's Gay Purr-ee, which - and this surprised me - predates The Aristocats by eight years. Though this film is most notable for Judy Garland's only role in an animated film, a crew including Looney Tunes regulars in voice actor Mel Blanc and Chuck Jones (co-writer with wife Dorothy Jones) and former Disney and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) animators contributes to a film that fuses the styles of all three of those studios and foreshadows the beginning of the Dark Age of Animation (to my estimation, this Dark Age roughly begins around Disney's death in 1966 and ends in 1988) and the end of the Silver Age (approximately 1942-1966). On its own merits, Gay Purr-ee is a solid animated film which is probably more mature than the title and plotline suggests.\n\nPrepare for shameless cat puns (don't blame me, blame Chuck and Dorothy Jones!).\n\nIt is 1895 and in the rural province of Provence lives a white cat named Mewsette (Garland) in love with mouse-hunting tabby Jaune Tom (Robert Goulet), who is often accompanied by friend Robespierre (Red Buttons). Mewsette finds herself disappointed in Jaune Tom's uncivilized, \"plebian\" mouse-catching ways and dreams of social gaiety and life in Paris. She runs off to a train bound for Paris where she meets a shady tuxedo cat named Meowrice (Paul Frees... yes, he plays a cat named Meowrice). Meowrice, who runs an illicit mail-order bride program with his stick-thin henchmen (one of which is voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft in a musical number), gives Mewsette to Mme. Reubens-Chatte (Hermione Gingold in the best voice performance... just listen to her when she says \"Meowrice\") to teach her patrician social mores and behaviors. Jaune Tom and Robespierre are concerned for Mewsette's safety and have set off for Paris to find her. The drama of this film revolves around Meowrice's manipulative stratagems to ship off Mewsette to a rich Pittsburgh cat named \"Henry Phtt\" (other than Meowrice, Phtt's name is the most entertaining to say aloud), Mewsette's realization that her dreams are not as she wanted them to be, and Jaune Tom and Robespierre's bungling.\n\nAs Gay Purr-ee is a combination of animation styles employed by Walt Disney, MGM, and Warner Bros./UPA, this is an animated film that looks like nothing else from its time period. The stylizations will recall the works of Vincent Van Gogh (and especially Van Gogh in the opening scenes), Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. This aesthetic is established early alongside the opening number \"Mewsette\". The prominence of browns in the background instead of blacks softens the image, making the rural frames far less grittier than in the Parisian scenes. Colors are also far more saturated in the opening rural scenes than when everybody is running around the cobblestone streets of Paris. This amalgam of pastel-aided foregrounds and watercolor backgrounds is a sheer delight to behold and is a richer experience than most projects by United Productions of America (UPA, known for their limited animation style that influenced how American animated films looked from the 1950s to the 1980s). One particular psychedelic moment appears to have been inspired by Dumbo's pink elephants scene (the scene is done well and I found myself laughing at the delivery of the lyrics) and more than a few sequences are less refined Fantasia-like moments (in fact, some of the animators involved worked on Dumbo and Fantasia). Anyone familiar with Looney Tunes and any of Chuck Jones' work will be able to notice similarities in facial expressions, character design, and certain types of movement as they largely dominate the MGM and Disney influences.\n\nThough Gay Purr-ee never reaches the heights of the best animated musicals, it feels like the film is comfortable being what it is. It doesn't strive for masterpiece status even though the complementing animation styles result in a gorgeous-looking film. The Jones' screenplay is problematic. The story - when not focused squarely on Mewsette's journey to and time in Paris - is an absolute mess. For example, in the course of a light-hearted 105 minutes, Jaune Tom and Robespierre walk hundreds of kilometers from Provence to Paris while only trying to board a train once. When they arrive in Paris, they find themselves diverted to Alaska where Robespierre inadvertently strikes it rich during the Alaskan Gold Rush. For a film that is trying its hardest to appeal to both children and adults, this distraction and many more distractions like it prove unnecessary. Although I will admit that, because of my low expectations going into Gay Purr-ee, it could have been far worse.\n\nThe divide between one's dreams and reality can be heartbreaking, as Mewsette learns soon after arriving in Paris. How beautiful life must be in the big city where anybody who is anybody are there to socialize, live, love, and laugh with each other. But don't attempt to extract too many lessons from Gay Purr-ee as it is just here to entertain.\n\nAnd entertainment it has in spades. The musical numbers - featuring Wizard of Oz songwriting team Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg - are excellent as a collective. Arlen and Harburg, who surely knew how to tailor a song to Garland's identifiable contralto - are excellent as a collective. The first number of note is \"Take My Hand Paree\" (drawn in a Warner Bros./UPA style) as Mewsette first showcases her lofty dreams and shows us how vulnerable and moldable she is. With such a well-known, big voice, some may find Garland's singing voice to be too much for a small white cat. Thankfully, the animators decided to accompany almost all the songs with fantastical sequences where we almost never have to see the characters mouthing along to the songs. But the one other ballad that also defies time is the powerhouse \"Paris Is a Lonely Town\". This song best exemplifies the increased use of blacks, grays, and other darker shades to make the images harsher, sharper, and gloomier in contrast to the softness of the rural scenes. \"Paris Is a Lonely Town\" is the foil to \"Take My Hand Paree\" in musical key, narrative function, and animation techniques. One stanza of lyrics stands out in that desolate song:\n\nEach glamorous bridge is a bridge of sighs. River, river, won't you be my lover? Don't turn me down For Paris is such a lonely, lonely town.\n\nI don't know about you, but that stanza alone is an incredible set of lyrics that implies far more. Thankfully, the film never acts on those lyrics for everybody's well-being.\n\nGay Purr-ee proved to be the second and final animated feature for UPA/Warners as Chuck Jones actually wanted this film to be released through United Artists instead. Warners was furious at Jones and Jones retaliated by leaving soon after. UPA shut its doors the following year and Jones found himself working on the last set of Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions (observant viewers will notice Jones' take on Tom altered Gene Deitch's and Hanna-Barbera's character design by adopting a facial structure like Meowrice's).\n\nConsidering how well Gay Purr-ee works for what it is, UPA's closure and the spat between Jones and Warner Bros. may have hastened and exacerbated the Dark Age of Animation as only Disney (speaking of Disney, is The Aristocats ripping off of Gay Purr-ee a little?) had the means and interest in crafting broadly entertaining animated features. It's a shame. But Gay Purr-ee itself is not. As a bridge between two eras of American animation, it is a fascinating effort from an animation and musical standpoint. It's an entertaining movie - with too many strange twists in the Jaune Tom-Robespierre subplot, mind you - that has been largely forgotten only because it is not a Disney animated feature. For Judy Garland fans and those who are studying the history of American animated film, Gay Purr-ee is an essential. For everyone else, it is the perfect (oh how I wanted to make that a terrible pun) comfort movie that children and adults alike - for different reasons - will enjoy. Gay Purr-ee is, considering what was to come for the next two decades in animation circles, a strong production.\n\nMy rating: 7/10"
