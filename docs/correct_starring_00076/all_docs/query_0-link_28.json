        "text": "Well, Animation April has come to an end. But, since we’re such big fans of alliteration, we’ve decided to turn this month into Musical May! We each chose a musical to cover this month, which means we’re bringing you three episodes focused on some of our absolute favorites!\n\nAdam got to choose first! And he picked (drumroll please) The Music Man! Based on Meredith Wilson’s Broadway hit, this film adaptation was released in 1962, starring Robert Preston and Shirley Jones. It was a huge success, and is still considered to be one of the most popular classic musicals among younger viewers. For a lot of us, The Music Man introduced us to musicals. It’s funny and entertaining (although a bit dated) and often it’s a great musical to watch if you’re just getting started in the genre. Plus, its songs are SO DAMN FUN to sing!\n\nSo, this week we’re taking a little trip to River City, Iowa where we will pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little, cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more!\n\nBefore we dive deep into the history of this movie, let’s talk first about Meredith Willson, and the original play! Way back in 2019, we briefly touched on this movie in our Case of the Movie Musical: Part 1! So go check that out if you’re in the mood for some classic BCD.\n\nMeredith Willson was a talented flutist, composer, and songwriter from Mason City, Iowa. He wrote The Music Man as a salute to his home state. He was born in 1902, 10 years before the events of the musical, meaning he would have been about Winthrop’s age when “The Music Man” came to town. Imagine young Winthrop growing up to write the story of Harold Hill!\n\nWhen he was in his early 20’s, he actually traveled with John Philip Souza’s band as a flutist. He also played in the New York Philharmonic! After serving in WWII, Willson returned to songwriting and was the music director of ABC radio and TV networks. He’s in the songwriting hall of fame, and even though he’s best known for writing the Music Man, he also wrote a lot of popular songs like, “It’s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas!” He also wrote “The Unsinkable Molly Brown,” another great musical. But of course, his crown jewel was The Music Man, an ode to his hometown and state, which earned him a Grammy and a Tony.\n\nOriginally, Willson intended on writing a book about the happy childhood he had in Mason City Iowa. In the late 1940’s, he decided to write a play instead, incorporating songs that he had written, and basing some of the characters on actual people!\n\nWhen Willson had trouble securing the funding for the show, it almost became a TV special for CBS. That deal didn’t come to fruition, and when Willson finally found the support for a stage production, the next hurdle was casting the title role.\n\nApparently, many potential leads turned down the part, from Danny Kaye to Gene Kelly. The show’s director, Morton DaCosta, eventually selected actor Robert Preston to play Harold Hill, even though Meredith Willson was doubtful he could pull it off, since Preston has never starred in a musical before.\n\nThe Music Man premiered on Broadway in December of 1957. It was a critical and commercial success, and had a 5-year run that included 1,375 performances! The show was nominated for eight Tony awards, winning 5, including Best Musical - beating out \"West Side Story!\"\n\nAfter its successful Broadway run, it was a no-brainer that this show needed the Major Motion Picture treatment. Warner Brothers purchased The Music Man for $1,000,000 (a fairly nice sum in the late 1950’s)!\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe Music Man follows esteemed con man Professor Harold Hill, as he heads to the town of River City, Iowa. He’s been warned that this town is full of people that are impossible to trick, salt of the earth folk that see through every sly-by-night salesman. At first, it seems that this town has met its match, as Hill is able to convince the residents that they are in need of a boys band to keep their children out of trouble. Of course, the local librarian is skeptical, concerned that he will hurt her friends and family by getting them to believe in something and be ultimately let down. Over time, she too sees the magic in the eponymous “Music Man,” just as Harold discovers that his music isn’t really a con at all.\n\nMaking of the Movie\n\nIn the early 1960’s, Hollywood was past the gigantic, sweeping musicals of its Golden age. The Music Man looked and felt like a stage performance, but with a technicolor pop and innovative camera work.\n\nMorton DaCosta directed both the stage and film productions. He brought with him from the stage, choreographer Onna White. White was instrumental in creating the famous “Madame Librarian” dance scene, an iconic moment for the film.\n\nLead actress Shirley Jones warned Onna that she wasn’t a very good dancer, but Onna assured her that she would be after making the film!\n\nShirley Jones was actually the first person cast in the movie, since she was already a bonafide film star. The studio wanted a big name for Harold Hill, to draw in even more audiences. They reportedly asked Carey Grant and were considering Frank Sinatra, but it was clear that Robert Preston was the only Music Man for the job.\n\nCary Grant was even quoted saying, \"Not only will I not star in it, if Robert Preston doesn't star in it, I will not see it.\"\n\nShirley Jones said that “I don’t know if you knew this or not, but Warner Bros., who produced Music Man, wanted Frank Sinatra to play Harold Hill. They were about to sign him, but Meredith Willson came in and said, ‘Listen, unless you use Robert Preston, you don’t do my show.” And that’s how Preston got the part.’”\n\nThe sets were simple. Three of River City’s major establishments, City Hall, the library, and the firehouse, were all located in one facade on the Warner Brothers lot. DaCosta was well-known for his inventive camera work, and he used angles and editing to trick the audience into thinking that these were three different structures.\n\nThe music was conducted by Ray Heindorf, and all of the songs were pre-recorded. It became clear that Preston was a master of performing the songs as if they were live.\n\nThe film took nine months to shoot, as each musical number was shot in about three weeks. Only one number was practiced at a time, with intense rehearsals. The goal was to get each scene done in one take, much like watching a musical performed on stage.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the film premiered in Mason City, Iowa! It was a star-studded event with box socials and band events as well!\n\nMusic\n\nWhen Meredith Willson sat down to write the music for The Music Man, he wrote new songs and included others he had written over the years. He ended up writing about 40 songs, and only 17 made it into the film. Not all of them were used on the stage, either. Willson obviously took the advice to write what you know. This is apparent in the scene when Harold Hill coaches The Buffalo Bills. He says, “Singing is just sustained talking,” a piece of advice that vocal coaches have been using for thousands of years. In a lot of ways, Harold Hill really is a music man more than a con man.\n\nSo while we’re talking about the music, let’s go over some of the songs from the film!\n\nMain Title/Rock Island/Iowa Stubborn\n\nFor the Main Title track, Pacific Title created miniature music men! Just a bit of early film stop-motion to start off the film.\n\nThe song Rock Island is actually a favorite of Hugh Jackman, and he’s said that doing the number in High School actually got him interested in Show Business.\n\nIowa Stubborn is one of the bigger numbers of the film, involving most of the ensemble cast. It perfectly captures the attitude of smalltown America.\n\nYa Got Trouble\n\nPreston was perfect at appearing like he was doing the numbers live, but they were indeed pre-recorded! This number is definitely a masterpiece of this.\n\nPiano Lesson/You Don’t Mind My Saying So\n\nThis song, sung by Marian and her mother, sets up both characters and depicts a realistic relationship between a mother and daughter. It also is a great musical representation of how adults can have a conversation with a child present, and the child has no understanding of what they are talking about.\n\nGoodnight My Someone/76 Trombones\n\nArguably the most famous song from the musical is 76 Trombones, the stand-out number where Harold Hill inspires the town to imagine life with a band. It’s the perfect theme song for the character, as he’s attempting to swindle everyone. But of course, the song comes back around at the end, as the boy’s band in town turns out to be more than what they imagined it would be.\n\nConversely, “Goodnight My Someone” is Marian’s song. She first sings it with her piano student, as she says goodnight to her true love on the evening star. It’s a song defined by innocence and love, and seemingly the perfect foil to Hill’s song.\n\nThat’s why it’s perfect that both songs are actually the same melody, with different tempos! By the end of the story, the characters are no longer foils, and the two songs become one in a literal and figurative sense.\n\nSincere/Lida Rose/Every song by the Buffalo Bills\n\nWhen Harold Hill unites the members of the school board, the rest of the town is skeptical that they will stop fighting. Of course, after the group is brought together with music, they appear multiple times in the show, singing.\n\nPick a little, Talk a little/Goodnight Ladies\n\nGoodnight Ladies was one of the few songs featured in the film that was not written by Meredith Willson. The song was written long before The Music Man takes place, and would very likely be sung by the residents of River City.\n\nPick a Little, Talk a Little is an incredible depiction of gossip in a small community. The film even hilariously places the imagery of hens against the group of women as they pick and talk about Marian’s scandal.\n\nThe Sadder but Wiser Girl for Me\n\nThis song is about how he prefers an experienced woman, either in sex or life. In some ways it’s liberating but in other ways it is insulting and crass.\n\n“No wide-eyed, eager,\n\nWholesome innocent Sunday school teacher for me.”\n\nMarian the Librarian\n\nAs we said before Onna White was instrumental in creating this number. Since Shirley Jones did not feel entirely confident in her dancing abilities she appreciated that the male dancers were able to lead and guide her around the room and the number. She said they were such amazing dancers that they could make anyone look good!\n\nBeing in Love\n\nYou know, the bathroom song.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Wagon\n\nThis song has been used in Wells Fargo commercials to promote the bank. According to Google it is one of the four biggest banks in America.\n\nThis film is still beloved by so many that SNL did a sketch where the wagon was coming and offering the townsfolk of River City bogus accounts. This sketch addressed the scandal around Wells Fargo while singing the upbeat musical number from the film.\n\nGary, Indiana\n\nRon Howard recently sung a bit of this song (lisp and all) in an interview.\n\nShipoopi\n\nFor this song, Willson invented the term Shipoopi to mean a woman that won’t kiss until the third date. The song is fun, but seems random, and is often made-fun-of by fans.\n\nThis was the biggest dance number in the film, showing off the musical stylings of Buddy Hackett. The scene was shot with an elaborate overhead camera.\n\nTill There Was You\n\nAccording to IMDB, when The Beatles covered this song, Meredith Willson got more money than from the play or show combined!\n\nThis turns out to be the love ballad between Hill and Marian, and highlights the emotional moment when he decides to stay for love instead of running for his life.\n\nThis is the moment when Winthrop angrily confronts his hero, Harold Hill. This causes Harold to really consider his own motivations as he utters the famous line, “I always think there’s a band, kid.”\n\nBeethoven’s Minuet in G\n\nOtherwise known as the song used in the Think Method! This little theme gets repeated throughout the film, and ends up saving Harold Hill from getting tarred and feathered at the end!\n\nCast\n\nAwards/ How It was Received\n\nThe movie received critical acclaim and was well liked across the board.\n\nThe Music Man won the Tony for Best Musical in the 1957-1958 Broadway season which put it ahead of West Side Story. Unfortunately when the movies were made Music Man won only one Academy Award, for Best Score, but West Side Story won 11. Though West Side Story is still used often in schools and won more awards, The Music Man continues to be a fan favorite today. This is demonstrated by the fact that a remake was made by Disney and released in 2003.\n\nIn a 2009 forum, professor Stefan Hall said, “In some ways, The Music Man (1962), based on Meredith Willson’s 1958 Tony Award-winning musical, anticipated the later 1960s as a transitional moment in American culture. While not overtly patriotic (indeed, some might argue the opposite given that the plot involves con man “Professor” Harold Hill’s attempt to swindle the citizens of River City, Iowa), the film uses early 20th century Americana to comment on the present. The confrontation between the angry mob and Hill (Robert Preston, reprising his Tony Winning Broadway turn), who throws his con in the name of love, presages the conflict between the hawks and doves that would divide the country during Vietnam. Also, the imaginative power of the youth movement, and an equivalent in Hill’s boy band that learns to play instruments without ever touching them via the “Think System.” And it is fitting that part of the film takes place on the Fourth of July, including the famous “Seventy-Six Trombones,” number, because the restoration of faith that reunites Hill with his love interest also finally roots him in an American home.”\n\nThe Music Man is the kind of musical that ends up surprising you. Non-musical fans might turn their noses up at it, as it appears to be just like any other classic hollywood musical. But, this film is different. The Music Man is funny, sincere, and filled with nostalgia. It’s a biting commentary on the world in 1912, the world in 1957, and the world today. In some ways, it’s timeless, while in others it may be a bit dated. But all in all, it’s the classic tale of a lovable con-man that finally meets his match of a town filled with people that makes him question why he started conning in the first place.\n\nSo, even if you don’t like musicals, stop being so Iowa Stubborn, and give this one a try! We promise you won’t be let down.\n\nBefore we go, we’d like to thank our Patrons!
