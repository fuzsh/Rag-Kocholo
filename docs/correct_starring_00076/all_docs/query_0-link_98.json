        "text": "1. Pride and Prejudice is a novel by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. Though the story is set at the turn of the 19th century, it retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of 'most loved books' such as The Big Read.[1] It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen's memorable characters or themes. To date, the book has sold some 20 million copies worldwide.[2] The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy young bachelor, moving into Netherfield house in the neighbourhood of the Bennet family. Mr Bingley is soon well received, while his friend Mr Darcy makes a less favourable first impression by appearing proud and condescending. Mr Bingley singles out Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane, for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other.On paying a visit to Mr Bingley's sister, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catches cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr Darcy, who begins to perceive his attachment to her.Illustration by Hugh Thomson representing Mr Collins protesting that he never reads novels. Mr Collins, a clergyman, pays a visit to the Bennets. Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer, the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self- important and pedantic nature. It soon becomes apparent that Mr Collins has come to Longbourn to choose a wife from among the Bennet sisters and Elizabeth has been singled out. At the same time, Elizabeth forms an acquaintance with Mr Wickham, a militia officer who claims to have been very seriously mistreated by Mr Darcy, despite having been a ward of Mr Darcy's father. This tale, and Elizabeth's attraction to Mr Wickham, adds fuel to her dislike of Mr Darcy.At a ball given by Mr Bingley at Netherfield, Mr Darcy becomes aware of a general expectation that , Mr Bingley and Jane will marry, and the Bennet family, with the exception of Jane and Elizabeth, make a public display of poor manners and decorum. The following morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress. Mr Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth's close friend Charlotte. Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns to London, and Elizabeth is convinced that Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley's sister have conspired to separate him from Jane. In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to Rosings Park, home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Darcy's aunt; and where Darcy also arrives to visit. Darcy again finds himself attracted to Elizabeth and, impetuously, proposes to her. Elizabeth, however, has just learned of Darcy's role in separating Mr Bingley from Jane. She angrily rebukes him, and a heated discussion follows; she charges him with destroying her sister's happiness, with treating Mr Wickham disgracefully, and with having conducted himself towards her in an ungentleman-like manner. Mr Darcy, shocked, ultimately responds with a letter giving a good account of (most of) his actions:\n\n2. Wickham had exchanged his legacies for a cash payment, only to return after gambling away the money to reclaim the forfeited inheritance; he then attempted to elope with Darcy's young sister, thereby to capture her fortune. Regarding Mr Bingley and Jane, Darcy claimed he had observed no reciprocal interest in Jane for Bingley. Elizabeth later came to acknowledge the truth of Darcy's assertions. Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia and Wickham. This is one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and Prejudice.[3] The clothing styles reflect the time the illustration was engraved (the 1830s), not the time the novel was written or set. Some months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, believing he will be absent for the day. He returns unexpectedly, and though surprised, he is gracious and welcoming. He treats the Gardiners with great civility; he introduces Elizabeth to his sister, and Elizabeth begins to realise her attraction to him. Their reacquaintance is cut short, however, by news that Lydia, Elizabeth's sister, has run away with Mr Wickham. Elizabeth and the Gardiners return to Longbourn, where Elizabeth grieves that her renewed acquaintance with Mr Darcy will end because of her sister's disgrace. Lydia and Wickham are soon found, then married by clergy; they visit Longbourn, where Elizabeth learns that Mr Darcy was responsible for finding the couple and negotiating their marriageâ€”at great expense to himself. Now Mr Bingley returns to Longbourn and proposes marriage to Jane, who immediately accepts. Lady Catherine de Bourgh bursts in on Longbourn; intending to thwart local rumour she warns Elizabeth against marrying Mr Darcy. Elizabeth refuses her demands. Darcy, on hearing this, 'dares to hope' that Elizabeth's opinion of him may have changed. He travels to Longbourn and proposes again; and now Elizabeth accepts. [edit]Main characters [show]Character genealogy [edit]Elizabeth Bennet[4] Elizabeth Bennet is the protagonist of the novel. The reader sees the unfolding plot and the other characters mostly from her viewpoint.[5] The second of the Bennet daughters, she is 20 years old and is intelligent, lively, attractive and witty but with a tendency to judge on first impressions and perhaps to be a little selective of the evidence upon which she bases her judgments. As the plot begins, her closest relationships are with her father; her sister, Jane; her aunt, Mrs Gardiner; and her best friend, Charlotte Lucas. As the story progresses, so does her relationship with Fitzwilliam Darcy, who belongs to a higher social class than Elizabeth. The course of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when\n\n3. Darcy overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading to them both surrendering to the love they have for each other. [edit]Mr Darcy[6] Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy is the male protagonist of the novel. Twenty-eight years old and unmarried, Mr Darcy is also the wealthy owner of the famous family estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, and is rumoured to be worth at least ten thousand pounds a year (which, in 2010, amounts to about one million dollars a year). Handsome, tall, and intelligent, but not sociable, his aloof decorum and rectitude are seen by many as an excessive pride and concern for social status. He makes a poor impression on strangers, such as the landed gentry of Meryton, but is valued by those who know him well. When Darcy first meets the female protagonist of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, she instantly labels him as prideful and rude, refusing to see the good in him. Throughout the progression of the plot, Darcy and Elizabeth are forced to be in each other's company, causing each character to see the other in a different light. At the end of the work, both overcome their differences and judgements, falling in love with each other. [edit]Mr Bennet Mr Bennet is a bookish and intelligent gentleman with a wife and five daughters. He is amused by the indecorous manners and nonsense of his wife and three younger daughters, and he offers little beyond mockery by way of correcting them. He relates very well with his two eldest daughters, particularly Elizabeth, showing them much more respect than his wife and younger daughters. [edit]Mrs Bennet Mrs Bennet is the wife of her social superior Mr. Bennet and mother of Elizabeth and her sisters. She is frivolous, excitable, and narrow-minded, and she imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations. Her public manners and social climbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth. Her favourite daughter is the youngest, Lydia. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off well. Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth about Darcy, on the title page of the first illustrated edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel. [edit]Jane Bennet Jane Bennet is the eldest Bennet sister. Twenty-two years old when the novel begins, she is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood. Her character is contrasted with Elizabeth's as sweeter, shyer, and equally sensible, but not as clever; her most notable trait is a desire to see only the good in others. Jane is closest to Elizabeth, and her character is often contrasted with that of Elizabeth. She is favoured by her mother because of her beauty.. [edit]Mary Bennet\n\n4. Mary Bennet is the only plain Bennet sister, and rather than join in some of the family activities, she reads mostly, although she is often impatient for display. She works hard for knowledge and accomplishment, but she has neither genius nor taste. She is as silly as her two younger sisters, Kitty and Lydia, though she thinks she is very wise. She is included very little in the book. [edit]Catherine Bennet Catherine \"Kitty\" Bennet is the fourth Bennet sister, aged 17. She is portrayed as a less headstrong, but equally silly, shadow of Lydia. [edit]Lydia Bennet Lydia Bennet is the youngest Bennet sister, aged 15 when the novel begins. She is frivolous and headstrong. Her main activity in life is socialising, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. She dominates her older sister Kitty and is supported in the family by her mother. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society and is remorseless for the disgrace she causes her family. [edit]Charles Bingley Charles Bingley is a handsome, good-natured, and wealthy young gentleman of 22, who rents Netherfield Park near Longbourn. He is contrasted with his friend Mr Darcy as being kinder and more charming and having more generally pleasing manners, although not quite so clever. He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others. [edit]Caroline Bingley Caroline Bingley is the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley; she has a dowry of twenty thousand pounds. Miss Bingley harbours romantic intentions for Mr Darcy, and she is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth and is disdainful and rude to her. She attempts to dissuade Mr. Darcy from liking Elizabeth. [edit]George Wickham George Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy since childhood, having been under the guardianship of Mr Darcy's father. An officer in the militia, he is superficially charming and rapidly forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He spreads tales about the wrongs Mr Darcy has done him, adding to the local society's prejudice, but eventually he is found to have been the wrongdoer himself. He runs off with Lydia and marries her. [edit]William Collins William Collins, aged 25, is Mr Bennet's clergyman cousin and heir to his estate. He is \"not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society.\" Mr Collins is obsequious, pompous, and lacking in common sense. Elizabeth's rejection of Mr Collins's marriage proposal is welcomed by her father, regardless of the financial benefit to the family of such a match. Mr Collins then marries Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas.\n\n5. [edit]Lady Catherine de Bourgh Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who possesses wealth and social standing, is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending, although her manner is seen by some as entirely proper and even admirable. One such, Mr Collins, encourages these characteristics by deferring to her opinions and desires. Elizabeth, by contrast, is duly respectful but not intimidated. Lady Catherine's nephew, Mr Darcy, is offended by her lack of manners, especially towards Elizabeth, and he later courts her disapproval by marrying Elizabeth in spite of her objections. [edit]Aunt and Uncle Gardiner Aunt and Uncle Gardiner: Edward Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother and a successful businessman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is close to her nieces Elizabeth and Jane. Jane stays with the Gardiners in London for a period, and Elizabeth travels with them to Derbyshire, where she again meets Mr Darcy. The Gardiners are quick in their perception of an attachment between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, and judge him without prejudice. They are both actively involved in helping Mr Darcy arrange the marriage between Lydia and Mr Wickham. [edit]Georgiana Darcy Georgiana Darcy is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable, and shy younger sister, aged 16 when the story begins. When 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr Wickham, who sought her thirty thousand pound dowry. Miss Darcy is introduced to Elizabeth at Pemberley and is later delighted at the prospect of becoming her sister-in-law. [edit]Charlotte Lucas Charlotte Lucas is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years old, fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr Collins to gain financial security. [edit]Interrelationships A comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in Pride and Prejudice [edit]Major themes Many critics take the novel's title as a starting point when analysing the major themes of Pride and Prejudice; however, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \"After the success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would\n\n6. have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title. It should be pointed out that the qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.\"[7] A major theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing on the development of young people's character and morality.[8] Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world, and a further theme common to Jane Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr and Mrs Bennet (particularly the latter) as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment; Darcy, on the other hand, has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable, but he is also proud and overbearing.[8] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[9] [edit]Style Pride and Prejudice, like most of Jane Austen's works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech. This has been defined as \"the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke\".[5] By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, that of Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\".[5] [edit]Title The title \"Pride and Prejudice\" is very likely taken from a passage in Fanny Burney's popular 1782 novel Cecilia, a novel Jane Austen is known to have admired:[10] \"The whole of this unfortunate business,\" said Dr. Lyster, \"has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. ... Yet this, however, remember: if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination...\"[11] [Capitalization as in the original.] [edit]Publication history\n\n7. Title page of a 1907 edition illustrated by C. E. Brock Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[12] The novel was originally titled First Impressions by Jane Austen, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797.[13] On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return of post.[14] Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for First Impressions between 1811 and 1812.[13] She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice. In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the \"sufferings and oppositions\" summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called \"Pride and Prejudice\", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.[8] It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.[14] Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton of Whitehall in exchange for Â£110 (Austen had asked for Â£150).[15] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her Â£140,[14] she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around Â£450 from just the first two editions of the book.[16] Egerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three hardcover volumes in January 1813, priced at 18s.[13] Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in November that year. A third edition was published in 1817.[15] Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish.[17] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.[15] The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become the standard edition from which many modern publications of the novel are based.[15] [edit]Reception The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication.[16] Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron called it \"the fashionable novel\"[16]. Noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he \"would rather have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the Waverley Novels\".[18]\n\n8. Charlotte BrontÃ«, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and Prejudice was a disappointment, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck.\"[18] [edit]Modern popularity In 2003 the BBC conducted the largest ever poll for the \"UK's Best-Loved Book\" in which Pride and Prejudice came second, behind The Lord of the Rings.[19] In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and Prejudice came first in a list of the 101 best books ever written.[20] [edit]Adaptations [edit]Film, television, and theatre See also: Jane Austen in popular culture â€“ Pride and Prejudice Pride and Prejudice has engendered numerous adaptations. Some of the notable film versions include that of 1940 starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier,[21] (based in part on Helen Jerome's 1936 stage adaptation) and that of 2005 starring Keira Knightley (in an Oscar-nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.[22] Notable television versions include two by the BBC: the popular 1995 version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. A 1936 stage version was created by Helen Jerome played at the St. James's Theatre in London, starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. First Impressions was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold.[23] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by Bernard J. Taylor, with Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy and Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet.[24] A new stage production, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical, was presented in concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell as Darcy.[25] Bride and Prejudice, a movie by Gurinder Chadha, starring Aishwarya Rai, is a Bollywood adaptation of the novel; while Pride & Prejudice: A Latter-Day Comedy (2003), starring Kam Heskin and Orlando Seale, places the novel at a Mormon university in modern times.[26][27] The Off-Broadway musical I Love You Because reverses the gender of the main roles, set in modern day New York City. The Japanese comic Hana Yori Dango by Yoko Kamio, in which the wealthy, arrogant and proud protagonist, Doumyouji Tsukasa, falls in love with a poor, lower-class girl named Makino Tsukushi, is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice. A 2008 Israeli television six-part miniseries set the story in the Galilee with Mr Darcy a well- paid worker in the high-tech industry.[28] Pride and Prejudice has also crossed into the science fiction and horror genres. In the 1997 episode of science fiction comedy Red Dwarf entitled \"Beyond a Joke\", the crew of the space ship relax in a virtual reality rendition of \"Pride and Prejudice Land\" in \"Jane Austen World\". The central premise of the television miniseries Lost in Austen is a modern woman suddenly swapping lives with that of Elizabeth\n\n9. Bennet. In February 2009, it was announced that Elton John's Rocket Pictures production company was making a film, Pride and Predator, based on the story, but with the added twist of an alien landing in Longbourn.[29] Also in production is the movie Pride and Prejudice and Zombies based on the book of the same name written by Seth Grahame-Smith, where the village of Longbourn is terrorized by zombies. [edit]Literature Main article: List of literary adaptations of Pride and Prejudice The novel has inspired a number of other works that are not direct adaptations. Books inspired by Pride and Prejudice include: Mr. Darcy's Daughters and The Exploits and Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy by Elizabeth Aston; Darcy's Story (a best seller) and Dialogue with Darcy by Janet Aylmer; Pemberley: Or Pride and Prejudice Continued and An Unequal Marriage: Or Pride and Prejudice Twenty Years Later by Emma Tennant; The Book of Ruth (ASIN B00262ZRBM) by Helen Baker (author); Jane Austen Ruined My Life and Mr. Darcy Broke My Heart by Beth Pattillo; Precipitation â€“ A Continuation of Miss Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice by Helen Baker (author); Searching for Pemberley by Mary Simonsen and Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife and its sequel Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberly by Linda Berdoll. In Gwyn Cready's comedic romance novel, Seducing Mr. Darcy, the heroine lands in Pride and Prejudice by way of magic massage, has a fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story. In March 2009, Quirk Books released Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which takes Austen's actual, original work, and mashes it up with zombie hordes, cannibalism, ninjas, and ultra-violent mayhem.[30] In March 2010, Quirk Books published a prequel which deals with Elizabeth Bennet's early days as a zombie hunter, entitled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls.[31] Marvel has also published their take on this classic, releasing a short comic series of five issues that stays true to the original storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was written by Nancy Hajeski.[32] Pamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story of Pride and Prejudice from Mr. Darcy's point of view entitled Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman. The books are An Assembly Such as This, Duty and Desire and These Three Remain.[33] The six-part BBC comedy series Blackadder the Third (1987), set vaguely in the late 18th to early 19th centuries, parodies the double titles Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice in the titles of its episodes: \"Dish and Dishonesty,\" \"Ink and Incapability,\" \"Nob and Nobility,\" \"Sense and Senility,\" \"Amy and Amiability,\" and \"Duel and Duality.\" A graphic novel sequel entitled Mary King[34] was written by Sophie St. Clair and released in 2011. In 2009 MJF Books released Darcy's Passions, A Novel written by Regina Jeffers. It tells the story of Pride and Prejudice through Darcy's eyes based on Darcy's three passions: his sister, Pemberley, and his love for Elizabeth Bennet, spanning from when he meets Elizabeth to the beginning of their married life. \"Pride and Prejudice: The Jewess and the Gentile\" written by Lev Raphael (2011) reimagines the novel\n\n10. with the Bennets as an Anglo-Jewish family. In September 2011, Proxima Books, an imprint of Salt Publishing, released Mrs Darcy versus the Aliens, a humorous sequel to Miss Austen's original book in which Elizabeth Darcy is forced to team up with her old adversary George Wickham to defeat the tentacled alien hordes threatening Regency England. Detective novel author P.D. James has written a book titled Death Comes To Pemberley, which is a murder mystery set six years after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage.[35] Volume 1, Chapter 1 Elizabeth Bennet is one of the five daughters of Mrs.Bennet and Mr. Bennet, and she is the most practical of all the women in her family. Mrs. Bennet, very conscious of the rules of polite society, tells her husband that he must go and meet Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, young bachelor who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet has no desire to go meet the man, but Mrs. Bennet insists that he must introduce himself to Bingley so that the family can get to know him. Everyone of this time felt that \"[i]t is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife,\" Volume 1, Chapter 1, pg. 1. Therefore, Mrs. Bennet expects that Bingley may want to marry one of the Bennet daughters, for \"the business of [Mrs. Bennet's] life [is] to get her daughters married.\" Volume 1, Chapter 1, pg. 3 Mr. Bennet says that he doesn't care what the proper custom is, if Mrs. Bennet wants to meet the young man, he thinks she ought to be the one making the visit. He insists that he won't oblige his wife's silly wishes, and Mrs. Bennet pouts because of her husband's refusal. She is worried that Bingley will meet someone else's daughter first, and then Mrs. Bennet will be stuck with the disgrace of five unmarried daughters.\n\n11. Volume 1, Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet had always intended to call on Mr. Bingley, but he enjoys contradicting his wife and disagreeing with her because she is a nitwit. Therefore, he doesn't tell his wife or his daughters that he has met Bingley until the evening after he visited the young man. While they are involved in their after-dinner pastimes, Mr. Bennet announces that he has met Bingley and his wife and daughters are all very surprised and quite happy, which was his plan. Mrs. Bennet announces her prediction that Lydia, though the youngest, will be the one that Mr. Bingley dances with most at the upcoming ball, and all the Bennet girls are excited to see how things play out at the ball. Volume 1, Chapter 3 Bingley is the source of all excitement for the Bennet household as they wait for him to return their father's visit, which is the polite custom. They fully expect Bingley to accept their mother's invitation to dine at their home in the next few days as well. Things don't follow that plan, however. Although the Bennet girls catch a glimpse of Bingley as he visits their father, they are unable to see him face to face before the ball because he has to return to London to bring some of his friends to their neighborhood for the ball. The women of the neighborhood are worried that perhaps Bingley is returning with his sweetheart, but it turns out only to be his sisters, a cousin, and his friend, Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet has bright hopes that one of her daughters will land Bingley, and it is with this goal in mind that she takes her daughters to the ball. Darcy is far more handsome than Bingley and he is wealthier as well, but it escapes no one's notice that Darcy is a snob. Mr. Darcy refuses to dance with any of the ladies at the ball because he does not find any of them attractive enough to dance with. Elizabeth even overhears Darcy say that she, in particular, is not pretty enough for him to ask her to dance. Elizabeth, being a good natured girl, shakes off the insult, but her dislike for Darcy remains. Bingley, however, dances with Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, twice, and the evening is considered a success by the Bennet family."
