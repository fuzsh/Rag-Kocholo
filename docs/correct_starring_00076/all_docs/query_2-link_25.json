        "text": "Cute as a kitten and just as comfortably ignorable after a few minutes of doting, \"Gay Purr-ee\" was an unprofitable tuft of Disney-chasing animal-cartoon frivolity of the early '60s by the animation studio UPA that mostly did shorts before and after this, one of only two films they ever produced (the other was the even less well-known 1959 \"1001 Arabian Nights\" featuring Jim Backus, not voicing Mr. Magoo).\n\nIf you can endure the boilerplate story (girl wants glamorous lifestyle, goes to the big city, gets taken in by sleazy grifters, but all's well after she's saved by new friends and dashing suitor) and inappropriate content for a kid's movie (she's basically forced into prostitution), the corny humor and corner-cutting animation…\n\nRelease date: October 24, 1962\n\nThis is the tale of three Country cats who travel to Paris and meet some duplicitous City cats.\n\nThis was released on a Wednesday; also released to movie theaters on that very same day was 'The Manchurian Candidate (1962)'.\n\nSo which film would you have chosen to see?\n\nI should mention that earlier in that week, on Monday, President Kennedy announced the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis with a naval blockade of Cuba, and on Wednesday, two Russian ships tried unsuccessfully to run that blockade. So there was that real life news.\n\nThis happy film features the singing talents of Judy Garland and Robert Goulet. The story is honestly simple in design , the art backgrounds are great, and the animation and the songs in the film are at best average.\n\nStill, average might have been just what the audience needed on that Wednesday in October.\n\nGay Purr-ee isn't a \"forgotten masterpiece\" or anything but it's extremely endearing and clearly a passion project. Someone was so obsessed with French art styles that they constructed an entire talking cat musical just to show them off and I think that's incredible. The narrative and songs are nonsensical and pretty middle-of-the-road for me, but DAMN this movie is great to look at most of the time, and you always gotta appreciate a Judy Garland number even if the lyrics are all over the place. I had fun!! YouTube kept subtitling bits as [SEXY PURRING] so you KNOW this is a wild one.\n\nUgh despite the beautiful sketches, backgrounds etc, this is such a boring movie with some very boring character design and really bad songs. The villain Meowrice is a conman with the silliest plan ever. Even Chuck Jones' involvement couldn't make this good or even charming really. It's like a full length adaptation of one of the more mediocre Looney Tunes cartoons. One of the most \"look at your phone while watching\" movies there is.\n\nDid I just watch an animated film where a pretty country cat was tricked into sexual slavery?\n\nThis movie features an all-star cast of voice actors, including Judy Garland, Robert Goulet, Red Buttons, and Hermione Gingold, who bring their characters to life with humour, charm, and heart. The animation is also a standout feature of the film, with vibrant colours and intricate details that capture the beauty and romance of Paris. It is the art direction that makes this animated entry really stand out.\n\nThe film's musical numbers are also a highlight, with catchy tunes and lyrics that are both entertaining and memorable. Judy Garland's rendition of the film's main song, \"Paris is a Lonely Town,\" is particularly noteworthy, showcasing…\n\nA nonsensical plot is saved by dazzling animation, classy and peppy musical numbers, and excellent voice acting from Judy Garland, Paul Frees and Robert Goulet. The comedic timing is also on-point.\n\nGay Purr-ee isn’t amazing, but it’s an adorable animated gem that is worth watching for more than the reason I watched which is for Garland in her only animated role. There’s some truly magical scenes in here, a particular favorite of mine being the homage to famous painters and their styles used to create a collage of murals of Mewsette.\n\nDefinitely relies on it’s charm more than anything. If only some more effort were put into the story, it could be something really extraordinary."
