        "text": "Hermione Gingold (1897-1987) was a British actress who performed in London revues and later in such films as Gigi (as Madame Alvarez) and The Music Man (as the mayor's wife). Gingold was a popular US talk show guest, appearing on The Jack Paar Show and The Merv Griffin Show.\n\nGingold appeared on The Mike Douglas Show on the July 21, 1966 broadcast co-hosted by the Muppets, notably engaging King Louie in discussion about the particulars of his royal stature. The pair sang a duet of \"I Remember It Well\" together. She also visited with Rowlf (including having him join her for \"Thank Heaven for Little Dogs,\" reworking another Gigi song) and played charades with Mike Douglas, Rowlf, and the other guests.\n\nOther credits included a few Broadway collaborations with Stephen Sondheim, notably A Little Night Music (originating the part of Madame Arnfelt and reprising it in the film version) and Side by Side with Sondheim. For the animated feature Gay Purr-ee, she lent her distinctively uppity tones to feline charm instructress Madame Rubens-Chatte.\n\n[]\n\nIMDB\n\nHermione Gingold -Foosie focuses on her revues\n\nInternet Broadway Database"
