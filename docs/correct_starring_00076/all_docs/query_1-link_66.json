Born on February 27, 1932, in London to American parents, she moved to Los Angeles before the outbreak of World War II where her beauty attracted the attention of film studios. The young starlet's first taste of fame came with the film National Velvet in 1944, which catapulted the twelve-year-old into overnight stardom. Over the course of her six-decade-long career, Taylor appeared in more than 50 films, earning recognition for her talent as much as her striking violet eyes. Taylor's personal life often garnered as much attention as her professional one. She was married eight times, notably twice to actor Richard Burton, an affair that began scandalously on the set of Cleopatra in 1963. Her turbulent relationships, health issues, and battles with addiction were often publicized, yet she remained unapologetic about her choices. Despite her tumultuous personal journey, Taylor's acting prowess remained undiminished. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress - for Butterfield 8 in 1960 and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966, cementing her place among Hollywood's greats. Beyond her acting career, Taylor was a vocal and dedicated philanthropist. After her close friend Rock Hudson died of AIDS in the mid-1980s, she became deeply involved in raising awareness about the disease. She co-founded the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) and established the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, both of which have made significant contributions to HIV/AIDS research, education, and patient care. Elizabeth Taylor passed away in 2011, leaving behind a legacy as a versatile actress, a passionate activist, and a woman who lived her life on her own terms.\n\nDec. at 32 (1977-2009)\n\nBirthplace : Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nBrittany Murphy, born on November 10, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, was a versatile American actress and singer who left an enduring mark on Hollywood. Raised by her mother, Sharon Murphy, in Edison, New Jersey, she began her journey into the world of entertainment at a young age. With an insatiable drive to perform, she set off for Los Angeles at the age of 14, accompanied by her mother, to pursue her dreams. Murphy's career took flight when she secured a role in the television series Drexell's Class in 1991. However, it was her breakthrough performance as the socially awkward Tai Frasier in the 1995 film Clueless that catapulted her into stardom. From then on, she continued to impress audiences by showcasing her wide-ranging acting prowess in various film genres, from romantic comedies like Just Married to psychological thrillers like Don't Say A Word. In addition to her on-screen performances, Murphy also lent her distinctive voice to popular animated series such as King of the Hill. Beyond her acting career, Brittany Murphy was also known for her singing talent. She demonstrated her vocal abilities in several of her films, most notably Happy Feet where she voiced Gloria, the soulful penguin. Despite her untimely death in 2009, Murphy's contribution to the entertainment industry continues to be celebrated. Her dynamic performances and unique charisma carved a path for many aspiring actors, making her a timeless icon in Hollywood's history.\n\nDec. at 77 (1911-1989)\n\nBirthplace : Jamestown, New York, USA\n\nLucille Ball, an iconic figure in American television history, was born on August 6, 1911, in Jamestown, New York. Her journey to stardom was a fascinating tale of perseverance and innovation, marked by her unique comedic flair and business acumen. The loss of her father at a young age and the responsibility of managing a household as a teenager fostered a strong sense of independence and resilience in Ball, traits that would later define her career. Ball began her entertainment career as a model in the 1920s before turning her attention to Broadway and Hollywood. Initially, she played minor roles in several films, but it was her performance in the radio show My Favorite Husband that caught the attention of CBS executives. They offered her the opportunity to adapt the show for television, and this led to the creation of I Love Lucy in 1951. The sitcom, which also starred her real-life husband Desi Arnaz, was a tremendous success, earning Ball four Emmy awards and immortalizing her as a comedy legend. Off-screen, Ball made significant strides in the entertainment industry. In 1962, she became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu Productions, which produced several popular series including Star Trek and Mission: Impossible. Her pioneering spirit, combined with her talent and tenacity, made her a legend in the world of entertainment. Lucille Ball passed away on April 26, 1989, but her legacy continues to inspire comedians and entertain audiences worldwide.\n\nDec. at 89 (1908-1997)\n\nBirthplace : Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA\n\nJames Stewart, also known by the stage name Jimmy Stewart, was an influential figure in the world of Hollywood, with an acting career that spanned over 50 years. Born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Stewart's humble beginnings were far from the glitz and glamor of Tinseltown. He graduated from Princeton University in 1932 with a degree in architecture but soon found his passion lay elsewhere. After joining the University Players, a summer stock theater group, he made his way to Broadway before eventually landing in Hollywood. Stewart's acting prowess shone brightly, and he quickly established himself as one of the most reliable and versatile actors of his generation. His filmography is a testament to his range, encompassing a wide variety of genres from romantic comedies to gripping thrillers. His role in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) earned him his first Academy Award nomination, but it was his performance in The Philadelphia Story (1940) that clinched the award for Best Actor. However, perhaps his most iconic role was that of George Bailey in Frank Capra's timeless classic, It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Beyond his illustrious acting career, Stewart was notable for his service during World War II. In 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, where he flew numerous combat missions and rose to the rank of Brigadier General. This commitment to his country, combined with his talent and charm on screen, cemented his place as a beloved figure in American culture. Despite passing away on July 2, 1997, James Stewart's legacy continues to live on, his exceptional body of work serving as a beacon for future generations of actors and filmmakers.\n\nDec. at 59 (1901-1960)\n\nBirthplace : Cadiz, Ohio, USA\n\nClark Gable, born on February 1, 1901, in Cadiz, Ohio, is an enduring icon of classic American cinema, best known for his role as Rhett Butler in the timeless epic Gone with the Wind. An embodiment of Hollywood's \"Golden Age,\" Gable's magnetic performances and unmistakable charisma solidified his place in film history. His life off-screen, marked by personal tragedy and resilience, mirrored the complexity of the characters he so masterfully portrayed. Raised in a working-class family, Gable's journey to stardom was anything but conventional. After dropping out of high school, he worked a series of odd jobs before pursuing a career in theater. It wasn't until the late 1920s that he made his way to Hollywood, where he quickly ascended to leading-man status with his breakout role in The Painted Desert (1931). His rugged charm, good looks, and distinctive voice captivated audiences, making him one of the most sought-after actors of his era. Despite his successful career, Gable faced numerous personal struggles, including the heartbreaking loss of his third wife, actress Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Throughout his career, Gable took on a range of roles that showcased his versatility as an actor. From romantic leads in films like Mogambo (1953) to hard-bitten heroes in war dramas such as Command Decision (1948), his performances often reflected the grit and determination that characterized his own life. Gable's final screen appearance was in the western The Misfits (1961), alongside Marilyn Monroe. The legendary actor passed away later that same year, leaving behind an inimitable legacy in Hollywood. To this day, Clark Gable remains a symbol of classic American cinema, his life and work continuing to inspire new generations of actors and filmmakers."
