        "text": "There are some interesting, daresay clever, ideas in this story. I think the main takeaway for me is that some can lure others into relationships, though it has to be questioned if such arrangements are based on love. Women, as well as men, can charm the opposite sex (and I suppose they can charm the same sex too). Other words might be mesmerize, beguile or even fool the other person into a relationship.\n\nAnother takeaway for me watching the film— what is the definition of free will? In this case, you have to ask whether James Stewart’s character Shep has much free will, if he is so easily manipulated by Kim Novak’s Gillian and her cat Pi.\n\nIf the individual willingly discards his free will and gives into love, that is still a sort of free will, because they are making a conscious choice to take their live in that direction. But Stewart’s character is often left without any choice.\n\nThere is a sequence later in the story where he goes to see an older sorceress named Bianca (Hermione Gingold ). Her features look somewhat grotesque thanks to studio makeup and lighting tricks.\n\nShe fixes a bowl of green slop that seems to look like pea soup and has the consistency of porridge. He must eat the whole bowl, and this will cure him; will free him of the spell that Novak’s cast on him. It’s a mighty ridiculous scene, but at least he’s getting his mojo back.\n\nThe other male characters in the story have their own afflictions. Ernie Kovacs plays a novelist who writes about the occult but is struggling with his latest book. He’s been brought to New York by Novak as a favor to Stewart who’s a publisher. Kovacs’ role is not fully fleshed out, but he appears to be okay with the idea of being drawn into Greenwich village life, despite how quirky or unorthodox it may be. Near the end, he finds enchantment with Gingold’s character, without any foreshadowing whatsoever that he ever had the slightest interest in her.\n\nThen we have Jack Lemmon in a supporting role as a warlock relative of Novak’s who enjoys causing mischief. Though Lemmon’s character is also not fully fleshed out and he does not have any girlfriend or other love interest, he does make the most of his limited scenes. Lemmon seems to understand the satiric edge of the piece and what it means to not be fully human. He lights up the screen, even when he’s turning out street lamps.\n\nRounding out the supporting cast is Elsa Lanchester, another scene stealer, who plays Queenie the aunt. Though Lanchester often specializes in off-the-wall absurdity in many of her more outrageous character parts, she does manage to bring a kind and wistful nature to the Queenie character. When she realizes Novak’s truly in love with Stewart, she almost wishes it were happening to her, which I found rather endearing.\n\nAs for Novak and Stewart, they had worked together in Hitchcock’s VERTIGO, released the same year by a different studio. They seem to get along well and their interactions are mostly genuine. However, I did feel Stewart was too old for this role. In VERTIGO, he’s a bit more desperate for the love of a young gal, which works for that story. But here, it’s a bit hard to believe that he would not have already married his long-time girlfriend (Janice Rule) or been married to someone else.\n\nHe doesn’t seem to have any real hang-ups, like Novak’s character does, preventing him from already finding a successful long-term relationship. I guess I can overlook some of Stewart’s unnaturalness in the role, but would Novak really desire him as much as she does? After all, he’s no aging Clark Gable. He’s not even a cool cat, to borrow the lingo, like Pi is."
