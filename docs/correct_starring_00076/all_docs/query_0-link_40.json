        "text": "Okay, I was going to move on, but I just had to share this. Thanks to Facebook friend and great KHJ 20/20 Newsman, Roger Aldi for alerting me to this -- here is Will Smith on Arsenio Hall's show.\n\nThe band member had alopecia, by the way. \"Aw, these are jokes! C'mon.\"\n\nI guess it's a good thing for Will the bass player's wife wasn't in the audience.\n\nUPDATE: There's some conjecture that the bass player didn't have alopecia. If so, the joke was merely a gratuitous shot at someone else's expense. The key is Smith trying to justify it by saying \"Aw, these are jokes!\" Bottom line is if you're going to dish it out you have to be willing to take it. That's certainly the rule of the writing room.\n\nIronically, Will Smith tried his hand at stand-up comedy a couple of years ago. Here's his tweet:\n\nI did Stand Up last night... FIRST TIME EVER! I opened for Dave Chappelle. I AM HOOKED.\n\nDave Chappelle? If you think Chris Rock is rough...\n\nLook, none of this brouhaha would have happened if Rock didn't make an uncalled for joke and Smith didn't over-react on a world stage. Both come off looking like assholes. I don't want to seem like I'm playing favorites, but I can't find any clips on the internet of Chris Rock hitting anybody.\n\nWas I right? People were talking about the Oscars all day yesterday.\n\nMy post on Monday was on the impact of the incident to the Oscarcast and purposely not a discussion of the merits of the slap.\n\nBut today, let me weigh in like everyone else. (And thanks for all the comments yesterday.)\n\nI agree with those who said Will Smith should have been removed from the building.\n\nViolence should not be condoned. And just because you’re a celebrity doesn’t give you license to not play by society’s rules. Same goes for sexual assault or throwing a full can of Coca Cola at a producer’s head because you didn’t like a joke (Yes, Bret Butler, I’m talking about you).\n\nIn watching the clip again (and again and again), Smith laughed originally and then saw that his wife was pissed. But his initial response was telling.\n\nI love how some people are outraged at this violence but seem to be okay with the January 6 insurrection.\n\nSome are saying they should take away Smith’s award. I don’t think that’s necessary. It’s already tainted. And might as well let him have it since he will never win another thing ever. Just throw him out of the Academy if they want to be punitive. He’s probably destroyed his career, so that's sort of a punishment.\n\nThe Academy came out with a statement that they “condemn” his action. Oooh, they’re really sticking their necks out. They will “formally review” the incident. So the bullshit continues. They maintain there was talk of removing Smith but that the decision makers were all in different parts of the audience and couldn’t mobilize in time. What a crock of shit that is. You don’t need a committee. You need the president of the Academy saying “Have security escort him out of the building. Now!”\n\nSAG/ AFTRA also condemned him. If SAG/AFTRA wants to right any wrongs they should fix their own health insurance plan that screws over its members. Work on that awhile.\n\nEnough people now hate Smith that he’s Hollywood’s next Mel Gibson.\n\nI agree that Chris Rock’s joke was a cheap shot.\n\nIf you’re a celebrity — especially now with social media where everyone with a Twitter account can become an Oscar host — you better develop a thick skin.\n\nThe reality is the only real laughs award show hosts get these days is from cheap shots. It’s encouraged. That Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globes more than once, that’s all you need to know.\n\n(What if Will Smith hit Ricky Gervais? Would the reaction be different???)\n\nSo where do you draw the line? When half the audience is offended by anything and the other half is angry and offended by nothing?\n\nOf all the truly despicable people in the world — people who want to destroy the world, destroy Democracy, all for their own personal gain and quest for power — you’re going to hit a comedian?\n\nNow comedians are worried this is going to become a thing. No, I don’t think comedy club audiences are going to start beating up on the stand-ups. Unless you’re Will Smith you go to jail and it costs you a lot of money you can't afford. As a general note — you can’t just start smacking people.\n\nRatings were up marginally. 15 million instead of 10 — the second lowest rated Oscarcast ever. Compare that to 1998 when TITANIC won. 55.3 million viewers.\n\nTo me, an even sadder moment was seeing Liza Minelli and the horrible shape she’s in. Truly heartbreaking. Kudos to Lady Gaga for handling the situation with class and compassion.\n\nLet's see... anything else? I can't think of... oh wait. Yes. Congratulations to the winners.\n\nWhat’s exciting about the Oscars is that it’s live and there’s the occasional unexpected crazy incident. That’s what people remember. That’s what people talk about the next day. Usually, it’s a major fuck up — like the year they announced the wrong Best Picture. That was an unexpected moment I'm sure the Academy wishes to forget.\n\nBut it seems to me that years ago there were more of these happy unplanned incidents. The streaker, Sacheen Littlefeather, Jack Palance doing a push-up, etc. What made the Oscar hosts great wasn’t their opening monologue but their ability to ad lib and comment on the memorable moment. Bob Hope, Johnny Carson, and Billy Crystal all had that gift.\n\nIncidents like that would electrify the ceremony. Now the audience is waiting to see the ramifications, reactions, and whether more craziness ensues.\n\nWill Smith revitalized all that with one slap. By slapping Chris Rock for telling a joke at the expense of his wife, Will Smith suddenly made the Oscars interesting. Whether you agree with whether he should have done it or not, the result and subsequent Smith tirade to Rock — “Keep my wife’s name out of your FUCKING MOUTH!” — was great live theatre. It was a shared event. People are talking about it today, aren’t they? We have so few shared events anymore that aren't insurrections.\n\nAnd then Smith finally wins an Oscar and has this insane pompous endless speech filled with pauses and suddenly we’re now hanging on every word. (By the way, what bullshit! He’s a “protector.” He’s a self-absorbed talented actor — not a protector, not chosen by God to spread love.) At any moment he could say the most bizarre thing. When he began by launching into how much love he was put on this earth to spread and then got teary, I don’t know about you, but I was thinking “this guy is going to have a complete breakdown on worldwide television” — I’m not switching over to Netflix.\n\nFew people (if any) can remember anything about the last few years of the ceremony. Yeah, there were incoherent speeches (Frances McDormand) and actors mispronouncing names, but big whoop. Will Smith slapping Chris Rock will be remembered for years. And I guarantee you, as a result, next year’s Oscars will go up in the ratings. If for no other reason, Smith will probably be a presenter. We’ll all tune in to see who he slugs next.\n\nUPDATE: My follow-up tomorrow. And no, I don't condone the violence.\n\nLet’s “Spring” into some Friday Questions.\n\nscottmc has left a new comment on your post \"How to boycott Russia\":\n\nWhen directing an episode for television have you ever used a take that you knew contained a mistake, or goof? (The reason I ask is that I just saw the DICK VAN DYKE SHOW episode 'Bupkis'. Rob opens the phone book looking for a number after having already dialed the number. Both the studio audience and Van Dyke seemed to notice the mistake but nonetheless they used that take.)\n\nI never leave mistakes in consciously, but sometimes in editing you notice things you missed on the stage. Usually these are matching issues — his collar is up in one take and down in the other, the cover is on the tray in one take and not in the other, etc.\n\nYou’re left with two choices. Either go with the take where everything matches perfectly even though it may not be the best performance, or go with the best performance and hope the audience doesn’t really notice the mistake.\n\nThat’s the camp I’m in. Unless the mistake is glaringly obvious I opt for the best performance.\n\nIn an ALMOST PERFECT episode I directed, there was a big pie fight with several pages of dialogue after. We shot it Monday night after camera blocking, then cleaned everything up and re-shot Tuesday night in front of the audience. Needless to say the two takes didn’t match. Watch Matthew Letscher (Rob). The glob on his face doesn’t match from shot to shot. I guarantee you wouldn’t have known that if I didn’t tell you. Here, watch the scene:\n\n404 asks:\n\nFriday question about your writing/thought process: I've noticed that most of your posts end with some sort of call-back zinger, where you reference something mentioned earlier in the piece. I know this is a pretty standard bit of comedy writing, and in general a good way to end a piece no matter the genre.\n\nMy question is how do you, Ken Levine, typically go about setting those up?\n\nCallbacks (as they are called) are a great way to button a scene. I rarely have a final callback in mind when I’m writing a post, but as I get towards the end I start to look back at what might be worth calling back.\n\nIn fairness, sometimes it works better than others and I’m left with pie on my face.\n\nAnd finally, from Brian:\n\nAre show titles hard to come up with? Have they fallen out of favor? I recall seeing a title in the opening credits recently. I was reminded of show titles since on a recent airing of Jeopardy, contestants had to name the shows from the titles of the final episodes. The clues included \"Farewell, Goodbye and Amen\" and \"One for the Road”.\n\nEpisode titles are a pain-in-the-ass. You need them for production schedules. At one time it wasn’t worth spending a lot of time on them because they’d never be made public. But now episode titles are available as are descriptions of each episode.\n\nIn some cases, the titles give away major plot points. It didn’t matter when no one but the production staff saw it, but now it matters a lot.\n\nI always liked what FRIENDS did. Every episode title began with “The one where…” You didn’t have to wrack your brain. You could just say “The one where Phoebe gets hit with a pie” and be done with it.\n\nWhat is your Friday Question?\n\nWhat is the benefit of doing a sitcom in a mockumentary format?\n\nAt one time it was very fresh. Rob Reiner’s THIS IS SPINAL TAP used the device as a novel and fun way to tell a movie story.\n\nRicky Gervais’ British version of THE OFFICE also used it to good effect. But it made sense there. There were only a few episodes shot. So you can understand that a documentary crew filmed them for a few months and distilled all the footage into just a few episodes.\n\nThe American version of THE OFFICE strained credibility. Why was this crew shooting for years and years? Still, you overlooked that because, at the time, THE OFFICE was a fresh way to mount a sitcom.\n\nNot sure why a documentary crew would follow around the folks at PARKS & REC but the show developed into such a funny and charming sitcom you didn’t mind. At least I didn’t mind.\n\nBy the time MODERN FAMILY hit the airwaves the device seemed tired. It reached a point when the mockumentary style detracted from the series.\n\nAnd then there are the logistics. Where are all these cameramen? In MODERN FAMILY there’s the episode where the kids catch their parents having sex. We see them bring up breakfast in bed and open the bedroom door. We see their point of view suggesting the parents are busily engaged. The kids are horrified, slam the door closed, and leave. Then we cut inside the bedroom where the parents are discussing what just happened. So wait a minute — for a camera to be in the bedroom to capture that exchange it already had to be there — when they were having sex. I brought that up to one of the show’s producers and he said, “Hmmmm. Never thought of that.”\n\nThe mockumentary formal causes limitations. How intimate can characters’ conversations be when they know they’re being filmed? And when you watch these shows, sometimes the characters know and react to being filmed and other times they act as if they’re oblivious to it.\n\nThis year we have ABBOTT ELEMENTARY, a well-written well-received new sitcom. But they too utilize the mockumentary device. And I ask the question: why? What added value does it serve? It’s certainly no longer fresh. And a lot of the jokes revolve around people squirming knowing they did something embarrassing that now is being seen by the world. They’re the same jokes THE OFFICE did a thousand times twenty years ago.\n\nIf there’s an organic reason why a series needs to tell stories through this device, that’s fine. Or if the characters are hoping this “documentary” will result in more funding or change in any way then I say great. But to do it just to do it — to me it’s the new laughtrack.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nWARNING: This is cranky Ken today.\n\nI will on occasion repost a story from years gone by on the weekend. I figure enough time has passed that most of the people reading it are new to the blog. I used to say they were reposts but figured if the subject matter hadn’t dated then why announce it’s a rerun? Someone might say “Oh, then I probably read it” and skip it when in fact they hadn’t and miss out. And often times I will revise the stories so they’re not dated or new information will be added. Again, someone sees rerun and doesn’t bother.\n\nOnce a month I try to repost a Friday Questions entry from ten years ago or more. And for those I specifically say when they first appeared. Context is important in that regard I believe. I’ve answered well over 3,000 questions and at least six of them deserve to not just be buried in the archives.\n\nOkay, so that’s my policy.\n\nLately, I’ve received some angry comments from readers ripping me because I don’t post that certain weekend entries are reruns. (Here comes the cranky part.). To those people and anyone else who has major issues with this humble blog:\n\nHow much are you paying for this? Or, put another way, how much am I making for this? Sixteen years of posting mostly every day and my compensation is what again? How many blogs are even still going after sixteen years?\n\nYou’ll also notice I don’t clutter my blog with ads. I’ve been approached numerous times to do that. I’ve also been approached to move my blog to a subscription site behind a paywall. I’ve declined.\n\nThe bottom line is after sixteen years it’s getting harder and harder to maintain this blog. The reruns are necessary. And how I choose to frame them is my call. The alternative is ending the blog altogether. And when that day finally comes, I fully expect these same people to angrily write in demanding refunds.\n\nHopefully I never have to rerun THIS post again.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for the wonderful comments yesterday. I'm not cranky anymore.\n\nI suffered through something I haven’t done in years — watching an ABC primetime show live — with commercials and all. I don’t recommend it. I don’t know how anyone does it. With so many ways to record content and fast-forward through the commercials, watching live makes absolutely no sense.\n\nThe show was SHARK TANK. We were looking for some mind-numbing thing to watch to distract us from all the news channels (for the obvious reason).\n\nIt was an ordeal.\n\nAnd again, it demonstrated to me just how totally clueless broadcast networks are today. Now, I should say I haven’t watched any of the other networks live during primetime so I can’t say that all networks do this. But ABC did.\n\nThe avalanche of commercials — that I expected. Any sponsor who pays big money to be the fifth straight commercial is insane. Everyone is in the kitchen, bathroom, their room to get the computer — anywhere but the TV screen. Take the tiny audience you have for the show itself and figure more people bail after every commercial. So if you have the fourth or fifth spot, the only one watching is the family dog. Hope you didn’t pay $100K for that privilege.\n\nBut here’s what I wasn’t expecting. A slew of ABC promos — in some cases the same promo. That’s fucking crazy! You could have five or six more minutes of program content. You could have made the commercial breaks somewhat more tolerable. Sure, networks need to promote their upcoming shows, but Jesus, how many times do I have to see THE ROOKIE? And the promos are usually buried in the commercial breaks. So even the family dog has left the living room.\n\nNetworks claim they’re working hard to enhance the “viewer experience.” That’s their excuse for cutting credits. Time is too precious to acknowledge the people who made the show, but not too precious to show the same damn ROOKIE promo over and over.\n\nAre networks short-sighted? Or worse, do they just not give a shit? Do they know the end is coming and they’re trying to squeeze every dollar they can? Is their focus so on the future and streaming that the broadcast networks are now just a foster child?\n\nI’m sure only us Boomers care. ABC used to mean something. All the networks used to mean something. To someone born in this century they mean nothing. So I’m one of the few who is still pained by the way broadcast networks are hastening their own demise. I wonder if anyone inside ABC feels that way? I’m guessing no.\n\nSpring Training should be starting now, but no — because of the ridiculous lockout and both sides being assholes. How do you sanction “stupid?” Oh well, onto real Friday Questions.\n\nDavid P starts us off.\n\nOf all the comic actors you've worked with, who do you think would be best as a President rallying their nation under attack?\n\nThat’s easy. Alan Alda.\n\nWhen Alan was running for president on THE WEST WING I would’ve voted for him. And his character was a Republican. (Of course that was when the Republican Party believed in Democracy and not destroying the country.)\n\nJeff wonders:\n\nHow uncomfortable is it to have to hire an actor to play a person the script describes as homely, unattractive, etc. I am thinking of Coach's daughter for one.\n\nIt is a little awkward, but you try in the casting breakdown to be somewhat delicate in your description. “Large” not “Obese,” etc.\n\nAlso, there is the understanding that hair, make-up, and wardrobe can make you less attractive than you are. (In features that’s how beautiful actors get their Oscar nominations.)\n\nSo the actress knows that she’s not unattractive but the character she is playing is.\n\nAnd then there are actors who don’t care. Jackie Gleason encouraged fat jokes. He knew he was fat and he knew he could get laughs out of that.\n\nOf course, nowadays everyone is so sensitive that in casting breakdowns you also can’t say someone IS attractive.\n\nFrom Rhonda Aghamalian:\n\nWhat do you think would have happened to Sam and Diane if Shelley had stayed on the show?\n\nI think they would have killed each other.\n\nBut seriously, I don’t know. We pretty much exhausted the Sam-Diane relationship by the end of season 5.\n\nDuring that fifth season, when David and I wrote episodes of CHEERS we asked for Carla stories. We had done numerous Sam & Diane episodes by that point and were happy to explore the other characters.\n\nAnd finally, a longer question than an answer from Frank Adkisson:\n\nI took a long weekend and had time to binge \"Inventing Anna\" on Netflix.\n\nThe main character is in the midst of a pregnancy at the beginning so there is a bit of a timeline for the 9 episodes. Early portion is probably second trimester. Then comes the birth. And later episodes, it is revealed the baby is now 3+ months old.\n\nThe series is set in NYC.\n\nI'm no meteorologist but I'm fairly certain NYC has an actual SUMMER! And a pretty hideous one at that Jun/Jul/Aug.\n\nYet people are wearing lengthy overcoats and gloves in pretty much every scene. Even in episode 9 where two characters are on a park bench and the grass surrounding them is lush ballpark-groundskeeper-aided-green and there is no snow on the ground whatsoever. Overcoats.\n\nIs it for continuity reasons like where Hoss and Little Joe always wore the same clothes? Is it because everyone expects a lawyer or Wall Street businessman to always be wearing a heavy overcoat?\n\nAs the months progressed, from episode to episode, I was (mentally) screaming, is it NYC or is it the North Pole? (Which coincidentally now is also having summer temps due to climate change.)\n\nThe short answer is that certain productions are lazy and others are cheap.\n\nGood wardrobe people at the production meeting are always asking what time of year and what time of day and how dressy should they be? They take great pride in having the right clothes. If the director says the scene is in the fall they’ll ask when in the fall? In September the weather is much different than November.\n\nShooting New York in the winter doesn’t require snow — just winter wear. And maybe the Naked Cowboy stays out of the shot.\n\nAs for characters always wearing the same thing that’s so they could use the same stock shots over and over. DRAGNET did that. Webb & Morgan wore the same suits in every episode so whenever they got out of the car, or they entered the precinct their wardrobe always matched. Producer Jack Webb was just flat out cheap.\n\nMaybe that was the case too with BONANZA. To be honest, I haven’t seen an episode of BONANZA since it left NBC. And at the time I didn’t notice the wardrobe. I was too busy wondering whether Lorne Greene wore a toupee.\n\nWhat’s your Friday Question?\n\nHere's a shocker: One of the greatest sitcoms in the history of television is 44 years old.\n\nBut that's not the shocker.\n\nThe shocker is most people have never heard of it.\n\nTime really does march on. It won the Emmy for Best Comedy three years in a row. You think it'd be famous.\n\nTAXI was created and run by James L. Brooks and the fine folks that brought you THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. Among the writers were the Charles Brothers (CHEERS), David Lloyd, and Sam Simon (THE SIMPSONS). The director was the incomparable James Burrows. What a staff!\n\nThe all-star cast included Judd Hirsch, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Tony Danza, Jeff Conaway, Randall Carver, Carol Kane, and Andy Kaufman. It was set in the garage of a Manhattan cab company. Most had dreams and were biding their time. The stories were hilarious, smart, and deeply human. One or two of the streaming services are featuring it. Treat yourself.\n\nOne of the reasons it has sunk under the radar is that only 114 episodes were made. The show lasted a mere five seasons. The first four were on ABC. They gave it bad time slots and canceled it after three years (despite winning Emmys every year -- now they'd KILL for a prestigious show like that) and NBC picked it up for a fourth season. Unfortunately, that was the period when NBC was in the toilet. TAXI was paired with a brand new show called CHEERS. Between the two the ratings were awful. CHEERS won the Best Comedy Emmy that year and survived. TAXI didn't.\n\nWhen my son Matt was a teenager we took a trip to Hawaii. Early in the morning one of the local stations was showing TAXI. He had never seen it. So I put it on. He loved it, was laughing out loud. Every morning we watched TAXI. If you're not familiar with it, I invite you to discover it as Matt did. I bet you'll have the same reaction.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter did an article a few years ago interviewing a lot of the principals. You can find it here.\n\nPeople always ask me what shows I wish I had written for. Tops on my list is always TAXI. I've been saying it for 44 years."
