After this, he toured the United States, where he met the American composers George Gershwin and Irving Berlin and brought the operetta Dédé to Broadway in 1922.He developed an interest in acting and had success in Dédé.When talkies arrived, he went to Hollywood in 1928, where he played his first American role in Innocents of Paris.In 1930, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in The Love Parade (1929) and The Big Pond (1930), which secured his first big American hit, \"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight\". In 1957, he appeared in Love in the Afternoon, which was his first Hollywood film in more than 20 years.In 1958, he starred with Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in Gigi.In the early 1960s, he made eight films, including 'Can-Can' in 1960 and 'Fanny' the following year.In 1970, he made his final contribution to the film industry where he sang the title song of the Disney film The Aristocats.He died in Paris, on January 1, 1972, aged 83."
