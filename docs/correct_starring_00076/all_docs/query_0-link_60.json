Cinerama was among the novel techniques developed by the movie industry at the time to keep audiences coming to theaters in the face of increasing competition from television. Starting with its initial title, This Is Cinerama, which debuted Sept. 30, 1952, Cinerama’s first decade of usage produced travelogues and documentaries. Only two films with stories were produced using the original, three-strip Cinerama process, and both of those will be airing on TCM this evening. While even the best of modern TVs cannot replicate the full Cinerama experience, it is easy to see why these epic productions were chosen to be presented in that immersive manner. Up first is The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), producer/codirector George Pal’s film that combines biography and fantasy to tell the story of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm (Laurence Harvey and Karlheinz Böhm) interspersed with fanciful presentations of some of the classic fairy tales the siblings collected. Following this is the TCM premiere of the 2021 documentary short Rescuing a Fantasy Classic, which details the daunting technical effort that went into restoring Brothers Grimm in its original Cinerama format. After that is the second and last story-based feature to have been produced in the three-strip Cinerama format, also from 1962 — How the West Was Won. Boasting three directors — Henry Hathaway, John Ford and George Marshall — and a large cast including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Debbie Reynolds, Karl Malden, Spencer Tracy and more, this Best Picture Oscar-nominated film tells the story of America’s westward expansion through five stories set between 1839 and 1889.\n\nTrolls Holiday in Harmony\n\nNBC, 8:30pm\n\nThis half-hour animated special from 2021 is based on the hit Trolls feature-film franchise and includes four original songs.

Meanwhile, Tiny Diamond (Kenan Thompson) comes down with a bad case of writers block trying to think of a special holiday rap for his dad. The voice cast also includes Rachel Bloom, Ron Funches and Kunal Nayyar.\n\nMy Lottery Dream Home: “New Money, New York City!”\n\nHGTV, 9pm\n\nAfter winning a whopping $1,000 dollars a day for life, Texas-born Stephen generously bought his family a dream home in Houston with David Bromstad’s help, but that was just the beginning.

Terminally ill clerk Lionel Barrymore. Ruthless tycoon Wallace Beery. Scheming stenographer Joan Crawford.

Whether with or without birds at hand, Stroud spent a life sentence in prison becoming a self-taught — and eminent — ornithologist. John Frankenheimer directed this remarkable study, which costars Karl Malden, Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee Thelma Ritter, Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee Telly Savalas, Neville Brand and Edmond O’Brien. Birdman of Alcatraz is the centerpiece of this evening’s lineup of Lancaster classics; preceding it is Trapeze (1956), a drama set under the big top costarring Gina Lollobrigida, and in which the actor put his skills as a former circus acrobat to use. Following Birdman are Brute Force (1947), a film noir that was Lancaster’s second movie, and which also features Hume Cronyn; Seven Days in May (1964), John Frankenheimer’s political thriller costarring Kirk Douglas, Fredric March and Ava Gardner; and The Crimson Pirate (1952), a comedy/adventure swashbuckler.\n\nTuesday, Nov. 29\n\nPiano y Mujer II\n\nHBO Max\n\nFollowing the success of the concert special and album Piano y Mujer, acclaimed pianist Arthur Hanlon returns alongside some of Latin music’s most prominent female vocalists in this follow-up special.

First up, Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar — and the hearts of American audiences — as restless European princess Ann, who escapes her stifling duties for a bit of adventure in Roman Holiday (1953). When a comic mishap lands Ann in the company of American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), excitement and romance await. Peck himself was so taken with Hepburn’s performance that he insisted her name join his above the title in the film’s PR materials. Next, just before she became the real-life princess of Monaco, The Swan (1956) saw Grace Kelly play exiled Princess Alexandra, whose domineering mother presses her to marry Prince Albert (Sir Alec Guinness) and restore their noble status. But Alexandra’s heart may already be claimed. Pre-Code musical The Love Parade (1929) stars Jeanette MacDonald in her film debut as Queen Louise of Sylvania and Maurice Chevalier as rapscallion Count Alfred, who by turns charms and challenges his queen. Adapted from the 1924 operetta of the same name, The Student Prince (1954) sees stodgy Prince Karl (Edmund Purdom) of the small German kingdom Karlsburg shipped off to university to learn a more charming — and wife-winning — manner. But the plan backfires when young Karl discovers he enjoys student life over royal life and becomes smitten with winsome barmaid Kathie (Ann Blyth). Next up, Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945) stars Hedy Lamarr as lovelorn widow Princess Veronica who travels to New York City to track down Paul MacMillan (Warner Anderson), the handsome American writer who captured her heart years before. Will a series of madcap events involving the hotel’s goodhearted if misguided bellboy lead to royal heartbreak — or a pair of storybook romances?
