        "text": "- Where does the inventory ship from?\n\nOur inventory is divided between New York and Toronto.\n\n- Where do you ship to?\n\nWe can ship anywhere. Typically when we ship within North America we prefer to use FedEx or DHL. To Europe, Asia and beyond we generally use DHL.\n\n- How much does it cost to ship?\n\nFor shipments within North America, we typically charge a flat rate fee. Many items on our site will list the rate. For shipping outside of North America, we can easily provide a quote and will look for the most efficient and economical option.\n\nMost of the items on our site can be easily shipped internationally.\n\nOccasionally we will recommend that an artwork be removed from its frame for shipping. Larger framed works are typically framed with plexiglass. We export over 80% of what we sell, so we are comfortable shipping anywhere.\n\n- Are there additional taxes or fees?\n\nWhen a work is valued above $2,500 usd there is a possibility of tax of 0.35%, but this is applied sporadically. There can similarly be an additional fee for customs brokerage and this can range from $20 - $65. US Taxes, duties and customs brokerage are not included in our flat rate shipping. However most of our shipments to the US enter without any additional fees.\n\n- Do you provide a certificate of authenticity?\n\nYes, we guarantee everything we sell. We can provide both a digital and printed version of our certificate of authenticity.\n\nWhat is your return policy?\n\n- Caviar20 wants you to be 100% satisfied with your purchase. We have a 7 day no-questions full refund return policy for your purchase. Shipping charges are non-refundable. Return shipping is the responsibility of the customer. After 8 days returns are given a credit note. There is no expiration for our credit notes.\n\n- What payment methods do you accept?\n\nIf purchasing directly online, Caviar20 accepts all major credit cards as well as Paypal. If invoiced, Caviar20 accepts all major credit cards on regularly priced merchandise.\n\nDiscounted material must be paid by wire transfer, or with Paypal (if funds are sent as 'friends and family'). There is a 3.5% administration fee for credit cards on discounted material."
