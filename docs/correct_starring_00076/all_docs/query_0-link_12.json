Jack, a confirmed bachelor, is determined to keep clear of Ann’s matrimonial designs on him. He flees across continents and even, in the legendary dream act of DON JUAN IN HELL, to Hades for a chat with the Devil and back again to avoid having to meaningfully connect to another person. But, finally, her intelligent will is too much for him. This play gleefully examines the importance of embracing our true self without artifice so that we may connect to and understand ourselves and, ultimately, become a part of our community and the world around us.\n\nThis is one of Shaw’s most enduringly delightful, famously iconic, and yet least known plays, which will be performed (almost) complete in a pithy but substantially cut two½ hour version created by David Staller\n\nOur spectacular cast will include:\n\nJack Tanner/Don Juan … SANTINO FONTANA\n\nAnn Whitefield/Dona Ana … NIKKI M. JAMES\n\nRoebuck Ramsden/The Statue … ROBERT CUCCIOLI\n\nMendoza/The Devil … JOHN-ANDREW MORRISON\n\nOctavius … VISHAAL REDDY\n\nViolet … LAUREN MOLINA\n\nMrs. Whitefield … CHRISTINE TOY JOHNSON\n\nHenry Straker … ROB McCLURE\n\nMr. Malone … LENNY WOLPE\n\nHector Malone … CLAYBOURNE ELDER\n\nDirected and Narrated by DAVID STALLER\n\nA BENEFIT FOR THE ACTORS’ FUND!\n\nSIMPLY CLICK: HERE\n\nWe missed you! This event is now over…\n\nShaw’s CAESAR & CLEOPATRA\n\nThe ALMOST historical epic!\n\nA BENEFIT FOR THE ACTORS’ FUND!\n\nAdapted and directed by David STALLER\n\nOUR SPECTACULAR CAST!\n\nFtatateeta … Brenda BRAXTON\n\nCaesar … Robert CUCCIOLI\n\nCleopatra … Mirirai SITHOLE\n\nRufio … Jeff APPLEGATE\n\nBritannus … Jonathan HADLEY\n\nPothinus … Rajesh BOSE\n\nApollodorus … Dan DOMINGUES\n\nCAESAR & CLEOPATRA. One of Shaw’s most famous and least known plays, this remarkable comedy hadn’t been given a full NYC production in over 40 years before GTG’s production last year! As an early draft of the Eliza/Higgins relationship in Shaw’s Pygmalion, this highly entertaining play boldly addresses women’s rights, gender roles, empowering the disenfranchised, and being an active and contributive member of the community. In this delightful fantasy, Shaw dares us to imagine how theatrically magical the past might have been! This adaptation, created by David Staller, incorporates Shaw’s various versions over the years including his original hand-written draft, four of his production scripts from over the years, and even an early draft screenplay he had worked on during WWII.\n\nThese are readings presented in an online performance platform.\n\nOur last event:\n\nShaw’s high-flying comedy\n\nMISALLIANCE\n\nA BENEFIT FOR THE ACTORS’ FUND!\n\nIn Misalliance, the high-flying comedy, Shaw examines a variety of mating combinations. The social and the political collide with the romantic and the practical; the aristocrats take on the middle classes and vice versa, and-to top it all off there’s a glamorous lady aviatrix and a tipsy gun-toting socialist loose on the grounds! This is one of Shaw’s most beloved of plays.\n\nOur Spectacular Cast!\n\nJohnny Tarleton … Jamie Sanders\n\nBentley Summerhays … Ryan Spahn\n\nLord Summerhays … Peter Francis James\n\nHypatia Tarleton … Midori Francis\n\nMrs. Tarleton … Sharon Washington\n\nJohn Tarleton … Thom Sesma\n\nJoey Percival … Marc delaCruz\n\nLina Szczepanowska … Teresa Avia Lim\n\nJulius “Gunner” Baker … Dan Domingues\n\nDirector and Narrator … David Staller\n\n“Keeping a creative link to our community has never seemed more urgently vital, so we’re thrilled to have the opportunity to partner once more with Seth and James at Stars In The House! MISALLIANCE has been one of our most requested plays and, with this cast, it’s sure to be sheer joy,” says David Staller\n\nShaw’s MRS. WARREN’S PROFESSION\n\nWas performed on Saturday, June 20, 2pm\n\nFREE! A benefit for the NAACP\n\nOur amazing cast:\n\nTonya Pinkins…Mrs. Kitty Warren\n\nMidori Francis…Vivie Warren\n\nDavid Huynh…Frank Gardner\n\nJames Monroe Iglehart…Reverend Samuel Gardner\n\nThom Sesma…Praed\n\nRaphael Nash Thompson…Sir George Crofts\n\nMRS. WARREN’S PROFESSION by Bernard Shaw, 1895. The struggle for equal rights has always been the hot topic for Shaw. This early play of his was considered so incendiary in its time that it was banned for years in Britain and, when it finally debuted here in New York City, the entire cast was arrested on opening night. It’s not the plot point of prostitution that offended the officials, but the notion that a woman would struggle to create a successful life for herself in spite of the constraints set against her by law and society, and thrive without apology. With this, our third free online presentation, we have a dream cast to bring you this highly entertaining story involving a mother and daughter who, for the first time, reveal their true self to each other. The issue of women’s rights permeates all of Shaw’s work and perhaps never, before or since, has the topic been more explosively examined.\n\nThis event was performed on May 20th:\n\nShaw’s CANDIDA\n\nFREE!
