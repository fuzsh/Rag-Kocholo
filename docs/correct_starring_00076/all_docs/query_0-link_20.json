        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for longer reviews &cet.\n\nAliens (1986) The Alien franchise is so well-established now and its horrific contours so much a part of the popular culture after nearly 45 years, it may be difficult to explain to younger people how striking Alien was to moviegoers in 1979. (When that thing burst out of John Hurt’s chest I had an attack of hyperventilation in the theater.) As much as one hates, and hated even then, to praise that appalling egotist and self-confessed plagiarist James Cameron,* his 1986 sequel had nearly as great an impact as Alien, at least on me. Cameron hasn’t anything like Ridley Scott’s contemplative qualities, nor his deliberate sense of pace; he grabs you by the throat early on and shakes you repeatedly, at strategically-placed intervals, making Alien look almost like an art-film by contrast. Of course, Cameron had the advantage over Scott in that he didn’t have to take time setting up the alien xenomorph or its violent, parasitic reproductive biology, and it cannot be denied that his action-movie approach is remarkably effective; I’ve seen Aliens on, first, video-tape and later, DVD and Blu-ray, more times than I can count since 1986 — I’m one of those suckers who can usually be counted on to purchase the new editions of certain favorite movies as they are released, even as I grumble about paying more than once for essentially the same item — and the picture gets to me every time, and in such a visceral manner my temperature rises before the encounter at the power station and remains elevated until after the end credits.\n\nThe new 4K UHD edition looks spectacular and is not, as I had feared (and as is sometimes the case with 4K transfers) murkier than the original.\n\nLittle Miss Marker (1980) The fourth screen adaptation of the Damon Runyon story; it was filmed in 1934 with Adolphe Menjou and Shirley Temple, in 1949 as Sorrowful Jones starring Bob Hope and Lucille Ball, and in 1962 as 40 Pounds of Trouble with Tony Curtis, none of which I have seen. (My tolerance for both Temple and Menjou is nearly as low as Joe Biden’s for the First Amendment.) Engagingly written and cleverly directed by the formerly Blacklisted Walter Bernstein, the 1980 edition has a sunny quality that goes down like a glass of Cocomalt, with approximately as much nutritional value. Jennings Lang, who produced the picture with his star Walter Matthau, was a longtime producer at Universal and may have thought he had a Sting-like entertainment on his hands, with a cast of lovable 1930s rogues and the ante upped to include an adorable child. Matthau, I assume, as a degenerate gambler could not resist a comedy in which he plays a bookie and the backdrop is an illicit casino.\n\nRunyon’s original is a curious little tale, bordered on the one side by comedy and on the other by a bathos that quickly drops into rank, manipulative sentimentality. Centered on the bookie Sorrowful Jones and the three or four-year-old girl left at his joint as a marker it’s essentially comic but takes a catastrophic turn at the end — the little girl dies — and none of the previous versions, as nearly as I can determine, has gone anywhere near Runyan’s deadly climax. (Two of them apparently end with either miraculous cures for the child or anyway the strong suggestion she will survive.) Bernstein, happily, avoids this complication, which in the story is unbearably maudlin, entirely. Where Runyan merely tells his readers that the girl’s presence in his single life alters the gruff, unlovable Sorrowful Jones to a more kindly, loving figure the writer-director shows us Jones thawing, slowly and not at all unbelievably, as he assumes responsibility for the child’s welfare and slowly stops seeing her as an impediment to be gotten rid of as quickly as possible. What makes this work is not merely Matthau’s peerless hangdog persona and his gift for subtle change but the girl herself; Sarah Stimson, whose only acting job this picture was, brings a calming presence to the situation. She isn’t precocious, or cutesy and there’s nothing calculating about either her performance or Bernstein’s conception of the character. She has a grave, polite mien, accepting what’s happening to her, never questioning her faith that her father (Andrew Rubin) will come back for her and unintimidated by Jones’ perennial irascibility.\n\nBernstein adds plot wrinkles in the persona (not in the story) of the dumber-than-he-thinks-he-is gangster played by Tony Curtis and the woman (Julie Andrews) whose ancestral home he is turning into his casino and who, it will hardly surprise you to learn, attaches herself to “The Kid” and to Jones. Bernstein also turns Regret, a minor character in the Runyon story, into Sorrowful Jones’ bookie-joint manager who, in the single bit of miscasting in the movie, is played by Bob Newhart. Newhart’s essential character, the stammering low-key voice of, if not reason, at least stability, is all wrong for Runyon. Curtis and Matthau are much better suited to his style, as are Brian Dennehy as Curtis’ chief goon and, in smaller roles, Tom Pedi, Joshua Shelley and Kenneth McMillan as that perpetual oxymoron, a decent cop, albeit one who, if he succeeds in his aim of protecting the little girl, will ensure her misery by having her placed in an orphan asylum. Where Bernstein goes slightly awry, as far as stylistic integrity is concerned, is in the women’s roles, which seem to have drifted in from the work of another author. Andrews is appealing as she nearly always is, and Lee Grant gives a good reading of the gently exasperated judge at the climax but neither feels to me like an organic Runyon character.\n\nPhilip H. Lathrop’s photography is colorful and clear, Henry Mancini score consists largely of lively pastiches of 1930s music and Wayne Fitzgerald and David Oliver Pfeil designed the charming main title sequence featuring period wheeled children’s toys including, in a winking cameo, Fontaine Fox’s Toonerville Trolley.\n\nPardon Us (1931) Laurel and Hardy’s first feature, a spoof of the early talkie The Big House, was intended as a short subject and it feels padded out, with long, dry and mostly unfunny stretches and one appalling sequence in which the boys, after escaping from prison, hide out in a black sharecroppers’ enclave. The black performers surrounding Stan and Ollie are neither more nor less stereotyped than in other movies of the time (although as usual they are happy laborers, singing spirituals during work and more secular fare after); what’s really insulting is that we’re asked to believe they’re so simple they can’t spot in their midst two white men in obvious minstrel-show blackface complete with exaggerated lips. The casual racism is even more of a shame because it detracts from our enjoying Hardy’s beautiful tenor in the communal sequence. (Speaking of music: When a prison quintet played by The Avalon Boys sings in the exercise yard, their a cappella number is an uncredited “I Want To Go Back To Michigan,” the 1914 ballad by Irving Berlin later memorably performed by Judy Garland in Easter Parade.)\n\nThe occasional funny bits involve Stan’s speech impediment, caused by a dental problem, which makes it sound as if he’s blowing raspberries at tough cons like Walter Long and Wilfred Lucas’ psychotic Warden, the schoolroom sequence featuring James Finlayson as a lunatic pedagogue and a scene in the prison dental clinic where (naturally) it’s Ollie’s healthy tooth that gets pulled. The dialogue is credited to L & H’s usual scenarist of the period H.M. Walker, the team’s frequent shorts director James Parrott staged it (often poorly and in so enervated a manner than its 55-minute running-time feels like two hours) and the uncredited gag-men include Parrot, Charley Rogers and, as usual, Stan. Those who grew up on Our Gang comedies (called The Little Rascals on television) will recognize the music in the score, comprised of stock-music composed by Leroy Shield used by Hal Roach in both L & H and Our Gang short subjects.\n\nThose Calloways (1964) If Paul Annixter’s 1950 coming-of-age novel Swiftwater did not exist, this Disney conservationist epic might suffice, but the adaptation by Louis Pelletier softens, complicates or reverses nearly everything that made Annisxter’s beautifully written book enthralling, and refreshingly candid.\n\nBlind Date (1987) The screenwriter Dale Launer’s 1980s specialty was a certain witty nastiness with a marshmallow center: Ruthless People, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and this exercise in comedic mayhem, directed by Blake Edwards and featuring the first starring movie performance by Bruce Willis. The way to enjoy the picture is to accept that nothing about it is related in any way to reality; once you realize that it takes place in an invented comic universe where a young woman can get insanely drunk and destructive on a single half-glass of champagne, a maniac lawyer can smash up several businesses without charge and, later, represent a client in front of a judge who it turns out is his father you may relax and perhaps, as I did, get a lot of laughs from it. Although Edwards was not, at least officially, the writer, Blind Date feels like a Blake Edwards picture, especially in the elaborate last third, and there are wonderful surprises for those paying attention, as when during a wedding ceremony the judge played with dyspeptic irritation by William Daniels snarls at his butler to shoot his incessantly barking Doberman and, a couple of minutes later, we hear a distant gunshot, which goes unnoticed by the guests, and uncommented on. The surprise of the delayed effect is as large as our hilarity at the filmmakers’ audacity.\n\nKing of Hearts (Le Roi de cœur) (1966) The captivating Philippe de Broca war-fable starring Alan Bates, given a glorious restoration in 2018 by Cohen Media Group.\n\nPaint Your Wagon (1969) There was probably no way, at the time of its release, for this Lerner and Loewe musical about the 1849 California gold rush to get a fair evaluation because everyone knew how much was spent on it; budgeted at $10 million it eventually cost the struggling Paramount Pictures twice that, at a time when a million dollars was actual money. The critics were aware of the cost overruns, and of the protracted Oregon shooting schedule — of the general spectacle of American movie studios hurling good money after bad, in obscene amounts, for ever more bloated musicals, few of which made a profit and even fewer of which (Oliver!, Funny Girl, Darling Lili, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, Sweet Charity) were any good. In the case of Paint Your Wagon, the manic-depressive Joshua Logan was stuck for months in the literal wilderness, with a cast of hundreds and a makeshift Western town he first had to build, then destroy in a spectacular fashion. He was also saddled with a producer who was not only the show’s lyricist and author of the Broadway book but the man with whom he had made another disastrous adaptation (Camelot) two years earlier and who, after entrusting Paddy Chayefsky to put together a new, hipper, screenplay, one involving a (heterosexual) ménage à trois, which he then (out of jealousy? insecurity? sheer perversity?) rewrote himself, to its diminution. Both Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood signed up on the basis of the Chayefsky screenplay and both were astounded to find much of what they had loved removed by Lerner’s fine Italian hand. (Chayefsky retained an “adaptation” credit but the screenplay itself is credited solely to Lerner.) Marvin gave up The Wild Bunch for this, so one can only imagine his reaction to the new lines that were filmed, although I hasten to add that you can detect Chayefsky’s unique way with a monologue, especially a rhetorical one, in several of the speeches that remain in the movie: Jean Seberg’s wedding-night monologue is one, and Marvin’s “let’s all be married” speech at the end of the first act is another.\n\nThose names are worth pondering: Lee Marvin. Clint Eastwood. Jean Seberg. Stars who didn’t sing, in a big-budget musical. That was the madness abroad in the land in those days, when the likes of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave were routinely called upon to carry a musical. Eastwood, at least, could more or less carry a tune, and had an appealing, unemphatic, slightly jazz-flavored way with a lyric. Marvin got, of all things, a Top 10 European hit out his melancholy, whiskey-laced rendition of “Wand’rin’ Star.” Eastwood had to strain too much in the higher registers for his “I Talk to the Trees” to land as sweetly as it should have, but he did rather well by “I Still See Elisa” and, especially, “Gold Fever,” one of several new songs on which Lerner collaborated with André Previn, whom he did his best to drive insane. (Speaking of not knowing when to quit: Previn then allowed himself to be driven even madder writing songs with Lerner for the Broadway musical Coco starring yet another non-singer, Katharine Hepburn. What an era. No wonder Hair seemed so fresh to people then.) Seberg was dubbed, by Anita Gordon, on her single number, the evocative, Previn-composed “A Million Miles Away Behind the Door” which contains one of my two favorite song lyrics: There’s so much space between the waiting heart and whispered word/It’s never heard.† Harve Presnell is, thankfully, on hand to sing a hair-raising version of “They Call the Wind Maria” (Pauline Kael: “Where did he come from?”) and I have always like Nelson Riddle’s orchestrations of the songs, except for the one we hear when Marvin sings “The First Thing You Know” and which feels like a last-minute demand from someone to “make it sound more like a musical-comedy song!” The banjo-and-harmonica arrangement on the soundtrack album is much simpler, and more relaxed. I assume Riddle preferred it.\n\nLerner can, I suppose, be excused to a degree on the grounds that he was being given daily injections of “vitamins” by the notorious Max Jacobson, put up in Oregon at Paramount expense, and was probably not in complete possession of his mind. Logan later revealed the extent of his own manic-depression, and, again, one supposes he couldn’t help making a mess of things. But where was everyone else? The wonder is that anything entertaining came out of it, yet the movie is much more enjoyable than it had a right to be, Ray Walton’s appalling performance notwithstanding. William A. Fraker’s cinematography was roundly condemned at the time of the picture’s release for being as muddy as the streets of “No-Name City,” but on the recent Kino Blu-ray, looks awfully good. (The 4K disc emphasizes the mud. Why is it so hard to get these color balances correct?) Superfluous side-note: I’ve always been amused that someone — Chayefsky, possibly — plunked Horace Tabor down in No-Name City, in the person of William O’Connell, complete with prince-nez and fastidious Boston Brahman accent. Tabor, the noted Leadville, Colorado silver miner and magnate, became one of the three principals in another musical piece, the Douglas Moore/John LaTouche opera The Ballad of Baby Doe, but wasn’t in the West in 1849, and if he had been, would have been all of 18 or 19.\n\nI used to refer to Paint Your Wagon as a guilty-pleasure. I no longer do. The phrase is not in my personal vocabulary now. If a picture provides enough basic entertainment, relatively brightly, with some talent expressed behind the camera and in front of it, and doesn’t embarrass you or insult your intelligence while you’re watching, it isn’t “guilty” anything; God knows there are enough truly shitty movies out there that don’t even give you the modicum amount of those criteria, and they routinely make millions.\n\nStranger at My Door (1956) An interesting little B-Western with pretentions that, despite the way it pushes its conventional Christian piety, has the virtues of an intelligent script, vivid acting, accomplished direction and photography, and brevity; at 85 minutes, it is no shorter nor longer than it should be. A bank-robber on the run from the law (Skip Homeier) hides out with the family of a frontier minister (Macdonald Carey) who sees in him a project for redemption. The preacher has a young son (Stephen Wootton) and a newish wife (Patricia Medina) the outlaw tries to get around by claiming she isn’t cut out to be a minister’s spouse, and he reads her rather well at that: Medina seems more dance-hall floozie than pious churchwoman, and the camera is as fascinated with her bust as Homeier’s outlaw is.‡ Although Barry Shipman’s dialogue is occasionally a bit on the nose, it’s often remarkably honest even while pushing that Judeo-Christian through-line rather insistently. William Witney’s direction, like Bud Thackery’s black-and-white cinematography, is sharp and clean, and the cast seizes its opportunities without recourse to overdoing things. There are, however, some moments of bad back-projection that betray the picture’s budget limitations, and when the little boy’s dog is injured, the child pretty obviously rescues a stuffed animal, and a stiff one at that.\n\nA secondary redemption narrative involves the seemingly mad horse sold to the minister by Slim Pickens (that’ll teach him) and it’s here that the picture soars off into realms of surrealist imagery as the horse fixes its ire first on one character (or animal; the dog also comes in for some menacing) and then another. How this horse was trained to perform as it does, and as convincingly, is one of the great mysteries of the Hollywood past, but you’ll seldom see a more terrifying specter in a Western than this violently-inclined equine maniac.\n\nGambit (1966) Beginning with the unexpected success of the blacklisted American writer-director Jules Dassin’s Rififi and 1955, and accelerating steadily after the Peter Stone/Stanley Donen Charade in 1963, there was an explosion of caper-thrillers and comedies, many but by no means all composed of a single intriguing word (the original French title for Rififi was Du rififi chez les hommes): Everything from, on the higher end, The Pink Panther, Arabesque, Mirage, Kaleidoscope, How to Steal a Million, Who’s Minding the Mint? and Hot Millions to Topkapi and Ocean’s Eleven in the middle, to, in the dregs, Assault on a Queen, The Italian Job and Caprice. Gambit placed near the end of the original cycle and while it was modestly budgeted — except for a few fleeting glimpses of Hong Kong, most of it was shot at Universal Studios (or, in one hilarious case, Santa Barbara subbing for the Riviera) — didn’t make much money anyway. Too bad, because the picture, charmingly written by Jack Davies and (of all people) Alvin Sargent, expertly directed by Ronald Neame and winningly played out by Michael Caine, Shirley MacLaine and Herbert Lom, is consistently appealing. The posters suggested to contemporary ticket-buyers that it was okay to give away the ending, but not the beginning, and it’s in that 26-minute stretch that I most detect the hand of the story’s originator, Sidney Carroll, author of, in the comic Western A Big Hand for the Little Lady, perhaps the most satisfying surprise ending I’ve ever seen.\n\nThe then-98 year old Neame in his commentary on the Kino Lorber Blu-ray says it was MacLaine who suggested her character remain silent throughout the extended phony-opening, which is in keeping with what one hears about her instincts and intelligence as an actress, although as she plays an Amerasian dance-hall girl, the entire enterprise would doubtless be considered intolerably racist today, as would the casting of Lom as a Middle Eastern millionaire, although for my part I don’t think I’ve never seen this wonderful character actor look more strikingly handsome than he does here. Speaking of commentaries: Avoid the second set on the Kino disc, by three nonentities who show off their collective ignorance by repeatedly confusing Sargent with Arthur Laurents, alleging first that he wrote the Gambit script for MacLaine, which Neame in no way corroborates and second that Sargent (not Laurents) did the same with The Turning Point… which was not only not written for MacLaine but was also not written by Sargent. Continuing on this weird tract the three movie stooges on the commentary further declare, with the confidence of the ignoramus whose thought process is entirely unclouded by fact, that Sargent also wrote Laurents’ The Way We Were! Needless to say after that, I did not follow these roaring fools any further.\n\nAmong the myriad pleasures Gambit offers are the comic interplay between the proletarian MacLaine and the phlegmatic Caine, the surprisingly winning score by the highly variable Maurice Jarre and the expert lighting and widescreen cinematography by Clifford Stine, of which I have appended a representative sample above, a small masterpiece of character contrast.\n\n*For The Terminator, Cameron cynically plagiarized elements (particularly the opening) from Harlan Ellison’s short story “Soldier from Tomorrow” and from Ellison’s own adaptation of it, as “Soldier,” as a 1964 episode of “The Outer Limits.” He even said to a friend of Ellison’s who asked where the plot came from, “Oh, I ripped off a couple of Harlan Ellison stories.”\n\n†My other favorite, from “Skylark,” lyric by Johnny Mercer: Faint as a will-o-the-wisp/Crazy as a loon/Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon... although I suppose we’re not allowed to sing that one any longer.\n\n‡It says something about this performer, formerly a child actor, that when he achieved his majority he had his name legally changed from “Skippy” to “Skip.” That’s progress, I suppose, of a sort.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nTwo Mules for Sister Sarah (1970) An entertaining seriocomic Western with what in retrospect seems a very unlikely pair of co-stars: The left-leaning Shirley MacLaine (as a Juarista nun, yet… or is she?) and the rightist Clint Eastwood as Hogan, the mercenary who saves her from gang-rape and reluctantly joins in her quest to destroy a French garrison in Mexico. Sharply re-written by Albert Maltz — his first screen credit since his 1947 blacklisting — from a screenplay by Budd Boetticher, the director of numerous Randolph Scott Westerns (Boetticher despised the eventual movie; he had written the role of Sarah for Deborah Kerr) and directed with economy and intelligence by Don Siegel, the picture is one of the most beautiful of its time thanks to the luminous cinematography Gabriel Figueroa. Figueroa, a master of chiaroscuro, was best known in America for his color photography on The Fugitive, John Ford’s adaptation of The Power and the Glory, and for his shimmering black-and-white work on The Night of the Iguana for John Huston. (He also shot the impressive-looking if morally reprehensible Kelly’s Heroes.) MacLaine and Eastwood are fun to watch, and there are some memorable set-pieces such as Sarah assisting Hogan in cauterizing his arrow-wound, her unsettling climb up a desert railroad trestle to plant dynamite and the final assault on the garrison, unusually brutal for 1970. The stars are virtually the whole show, but Manolo Fábregas and Alberto Morin, as Mexican and French officers respectively, are impressive, and there is a typically flavorsome score by Ennio Morricone featuring recurrent evocations of ecclesiastic choruses contrasted with the musical equivalent of a donkey’s “hee-haw.”\n\n“Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” (1979) Although by the end of the 1970s there had been a couple of big-screen adaptations of John le Carré’s complex espionage novels (notably The Spy Who Came in from the Cold in 1965 and The Deadly Affair in 1966) and would be many more in the decades to come, the ideal form for dramatic recreations of his intellectually bracing and richly detailed books was the television “mini-series,” pioneered in Great Britain where novels are and were routinely adapted in varying lengths for the small screen. Given the relative leisure of time, le Carré’s labyrinthine plots have a chance to breathe, and the audience to catch up. Even better, we get to spend more time with his characters, particularly his fascinating spymaster George Smiley and especially as Alec Guinness plays him.\n\nSmiley is le Carré’s great creation, a gentle, warm-hearted, honorable man who knows his business is not merely a dirty one but morally and ethically questionable as well, and Guinness’ astonishing performance takes in every aspect of Smiley’s personality from the unspoken hurt with which he bears his off-stage wife’s serial infidelities and the uneasy solicitude of those around him who are well aware of that open secret to the steely resolve with which he pursues the “mole” within MI5 (called “The Circus” here). It’s a performance he might well have given in a standard two-hour theatrical release, but would have had to sacrifice far too much to a shorter running-time. Arthur Hopcraft’s dramatization is as good, and as taut, as can be imagined and John Irvin’s direction brings patience and intelligence to material that demands it. The superb cast includes Alexander Knox as Control, an old man desperately trying to hold on to his position and knowing that his being right will not be enough when everything blows up in his face; Michael Jayston as Smiley’s aide-de-camp Peter Guillam; Anthony Bate, all false bonhomie and professional cowardice as the Under-Secretary Oliver Lacon; the marvelous Ian Richardson, witty in himself and appreciative of the wit of others as the duplicitous Bill Haydon; Ian Bannen as the betrayed and wounded ex-field agent Jim Prideaux; Hywel Bennett as the unforgettable Ricki Tarr; Beryl Reid (whom le Carré claimed Guinness was terrified of) as the indefatigable researcher Connie Sachs; Joss Ackland as the planted journalist Jerry Westerby; Nigel Stock, gossipy and malicious as Roddy Martindale; Susan Kodicek as the doomed Irina; Michael Aldridge, smooth-tongued and sneeringly pedantic as Percy Alleline; Thorley Walters as the wonderfully-named Tufty Thessinger; a young Patrick Stewart as Smiley’s Soviet nemesis Karla; and Siân Phillips as George’s wayward wife Ann. The only odd note is struck by the filmmakers declining to make Toby Esterhase Hungarian, robbing Bernard Hepton, the actor who plays him, of Toby’s distinctive voice and much of his character.\n\nWatching this splendid series unfold in six “Masterpiece Theatre” installments when I was 19 was one of the great compensations of 1980, the year my country unleashed Ronald Reagan on an unsuspecting world. Despite that unpalatable association it was a pleasure to revisit it over 40 years later and to find it as satisfying now as it was then.\n\n“Smiley’s People” (1982) The second BBC mini-series concerning George Smiley’s pursuit of his Soviet coeval Karla was as a novel actually the final volume of three in the series. In the second, The Honourable Schoolboy, the dissipated reporter Jerry Westerby takes center stage and Connie Sachs is nearly as important a character as he. Presumably because that book placed Smiley on the periphery (where he often is in John le Carré’s novels) and Guinness-as-Smiley had become a worldwide phenomenon, it was elided over in favor of the last in the trilogy. I miss much of the detail the second novel filled in, but if you haven’t read the books you may not notice. I was pleased, however, that, perhaps due to le Carré’s input on the teleplay — he revised the credited scenarist John Hopkins’ original — Toby Esterhase’s accent and speech patterns were returned to him, along with a great deal of his seedy if oddly charming persona. For Smiley aficionados, Smiley’s People is a special treat, as he is the fulcrum about which the lever of the story turns, working outside the Circus, going into the field as his own agent, putting his personal safety on the line for a change and following his nearly unerring instincts. That his quest is to destroy the life of one Russian man and to compromise him to such an extent that he must seek asylum in the West is mitigated only slightly in that the object is Karla (Patrick Stewart again). The whole business carries a stink of horror, which adheres itself to Smiley more than anyone else.\n\nGuinness does not so much deepen his conception of Smiley here as burnish the work he did in “Tinker, Tailor,” so that by the end he is able, finally, to place the perennially unfaithful Ann in the box to which he should have consigned her decades earlier. Beryl Reid, Anthony Bate, Siân Phillips and Bernard Hepton reprise their earlier roles, the latter considerably improved in both conception and performance by Toby’s Hungarian voice being returned to him this go-round. Eileen Atkins gives a beautifully-considered portrayal of the Russian émigré in Paris for whom the promise of an unexpected benison sets the plot in motion; Barry Foster a cold, calculating one as Saul Enderby; Michael Lonsdale a marvelous turn as a Soviet attaché who becomes Smiley’s cats-paw; Bill Paterson is unsettling as the ugly face of official thuggery; Mario Adorf is surprisingly amiable as a flesh-peddler with crucial information; Curd Jürgens is memorable as an ex-Soviet operative; Michael Gough equally so as his compatriot; Rosalie Crutchley delivers a superb vest-pocket portrait of the Mother Superior of a high-class asylum; Tusse Silberg is heartbreakingly mercurial as Atkins’ schizophrenic daughter; and Alan Rickman delicious as an accommodating MI5 factotum. Simon Langton was the director, and expertly handled the intricacies of the narrative and the increasing tension that gradually accrues as the series progresses.\n\nScrooge (1970) With the 1971 short version animated by Richard Williams, this is one of my two favorite adaptations of A Christmas Carol. As a non-believer I agree with much of Ebeneezer Scrooge’s philosophy, if not the manner in which he expresses it, but in any case Albert Finney’s wide-ranging performance grows each time I see it, and the Leslie Bricusse songs, like Alec Guinness’ creepily-rendered Ghost of Marley and Oswald Morris’ rich, textured cinematography, seem to me just about perfect for a pleasant holiday evening’s entertainment.\n\nFritz the Cat (1972) R. Crumb hated the writer and director Ralph Bakshi’s animated adaptation of his underground comic so much he killed Fritz off by having one of his girlfriends stab him in the head with an icepick. It didn’t help; the first X-rated cartoon feature, made for a mere $700,000, raked in $90 million at the box-office, all but ensuring a sequel. (The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat, which Bakshi had no part in.) Although the picture is dated by its take on college students playing at revolutionary action, it’s a wild, frequently hilarious collection of vignettes, most of them sexual in nature, with many others examining urban racial parameters through a satirical prism. While Crumb may have been disgruntled by the whole of it, Bakshi at least honored the artist’s well-known penchant for big female backsides, making Fritz, I suppose, the Sir Mix-a-Lot of his time. There are subversive touches throughout, as with the New York cops represented by literal pigs and, during a race-riot Fritz self-righteously sets in motion, when the Air Force drops napalm on a black neighborhood, silhouettes representing Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck and Donald cheer them on. Skip Hinnant, the original Schroeder of the Off-Broadway musical You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, provides the voice of Fritz (Bakshi chose him for the phoniness he heard in it) and a number of veterans worked on the picture, including Manny Perez, Dick Lundy, Virgil Ross, Norm McCabe and one of Bob Clampett’s key animators, the certifiably insane Rod Scribner, who must have relished the assignment.\n\nHomebodies (1974) An enjoyable black-comedy about elderly residents of a condemned urban building who when threatened with eviction take matters into their own hands. It’s amusing, even charming, although it does take a strange, vicious turn in the last third. (For my part, anyone who murders Ruth McDevitt deserves everything she gets, but let that pass.) It’s certainly a unique picture, and fascinating to watch, The macabre screenplay was by Howard Kaminsky, Bennett Sims and Larry Yust, the latter of whom directed with a fine eye for the revealing detail. Aside from McDevitt the wonderful cast of old troupers includes Peter Brocco, Frances Fuller, William Hansen (whom aficionados of the musical 1776 will remember as Caesar Rodney), Ian Wolfe and the amazing Paula Trueman as their unbalanced leader.\n\nMr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol (1962) The first animated television special for television which, despite some slight fudging of the order of things (the Christmas Past episode here occurs between Christmases Present and Future) and one extraneous musical number, is as likeable and surprisingly buoyant now as it was when I was a small child. (I first saw it, I think, around 1965, when I was four.) For some weird reason the framing device, involving Magoo opening on Broadway as Ebeneezer Scrooge, has been whittled away over time; I gather there are people who hate it, but I suspect the excisions were made for purely mercenary reasons, to squeeze in a few more commercials. This was the first of a long line of Magoo specials in which the nearsighted codger appeared as literary characters, and it’s the most memorable, although I will always be grateful to the series for introducing me at an early age to that perfect romantic hero, Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nThe Jule Styne/Bob Merrill song score for Magoo’s Christmas Carol is lovely, especially “Winter Was Warm,” the ballad for Belle, the Cratchitt’s holiday anthem “The Lord’s Bright Blessing” with its memorable evocation of razzleberry dressing and the boy Ebeneezer’s haunting lament “Alone in the World,” which Scrooge joins to make a moving duet. The only number I regard as unnecessary is “We’re Despicable,” performed by the ghouls selling off Scrooge’s belongings after his future death. It’s an amusing number but with only 53 minutes in which to tell Dickens’ story feels entirely disposable. Otherwise, Barbara Chain’s script is admirably concise, Abe Levitow’s direction strong and the production design (by, among others, Corny Cole and Lee Mishkin) strongly atmospheric and remarkably detailed. Jim Backus is Magoo, of course, and there is excellent support from Marie Matthews (young Ebenezer), Morey Amsterdam in a pair of comedic roles, Jack Cassidy in splendid voice as Bob Cratchit, Royal Dano as Marley’s Ghost, Joan Gardner as Tiny Tim, the Ghost of Christmas Past, and the Charwoman, Jane Kean as Belle and, in several parts, Paul Frees.\n\nSwing Time (1936) With the 1935 Top Hat one of the two best Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals, with a pair of the team’s most exhilarating dances and, in Jerome Kern’s music and Dorothy Fields’ lyrics, just about the greatest score of its kind ever written for a movie musical. Despite its occasional longueurs (and a truly silly finale), the picture inspired Astaire to one of his supreme achievements as a choreographer: The dance with Rogers to “Never Gonna Dance.” This breathless medley not only dramatically recaps the romance of the characters in this movie but almost everything for which we love these two. The final portion, shot in a single fluid take, required 46 re-takes and somewhere in the middle of it all Rogers’ feet started to bleed.\n\nThe Howard Lindsay/Allan Scott screenplay is a bit overstuffed, or maybe it only feels that way because it was directed by George Stevens, seldom remembered for concision. It has the same clean, Art Deco look as its predecessors, thanks in part to David Abel’s gorgeous cinematography, and there’s a good supporting cast which includes Victor Moore as Astaire’s card-sharp sidekick, the always witty Helen Broderick as Moore’s eventual inamorata and, as a dyspeptic dance-school manager, the peerless Eric Blore. Kern, who more than any figure until Richard Rodgers had the most profound influence on the Broadway musical, composed a score so rich in melodic invention it dwarfs the work of almost everyone else in movies, and Fields matches him in words. Her lyrics always sparkled, but she was also a musical dramatist, beautifully evidenced in the witty “A Fine Romance”: It’s hard to imagine any male lyricist of the time other than perhaps Cole Porter writing a couplet like, “I never mussed the crease in your blue serge pants/I never get the chance,” and I am always moved by the way she constructed the lyrics for “Never Gonna Dance.” First, there is the repeated Depression-era invocation of the wolf at the door; second, the unspoken metaphor of the movies’ greatest male dancer seeming to put away up his dancing shoes (“on beautiful trees”) as renunciation of an unrequited romance; third, her sharp sense of rhythmic and dramatic ascension. Ginger’s character is called Penny here, and from Fred’s repetition of the phrase, “‘Though I’m left without a penny…” Fields builds to, “So, I’m left without my Penny…” [Emphasis mine.] That’s as good in its way as Stephen Sondheim in A Little Night Music‘s “The Miller’s Son” repeating, “We’ll go dancing” and finally resolving the image as, “We’ll have dancing.”\n\nKern was uncomfortable with swing, so the rapturous “Waltz in Swing Time” was cobbled together by the orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett from themes the composer provided. Of the lyrical ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” Fields said, “The first time Jerry played that melody for me I went out and started to cry. The release absolutely killed me. I couldn’t stop, it was so beautiful.” (The song is also, at 68 bars, more than twice the length of the 32-bar standard.) The single number in Swing Time that raises eyebrows today is Fred’s “Bojangles of Harlem”; although Astaire is wearing tan make-up on his head and neck, it’s not “blackface,” which is exaggerated and used to demean and ridicule (even when black performers did it themselves) — here it’s the dancing equivalent of an actor playing Othello. Oddly, however, although Fields’ lyric certainly evokes Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, the dancer whose moves Astaire imitates in his solo is John W. Bubbles, from whom he took tap lessons, and he’s dressed in a manner similar to Bubbles’ starring role as Sportin’ Life in Porgy and Bess. If there is shame to be apportioned to the number it may lie in the music sheets bearing a notation on a certain passage as corresponding to Fred’s “jig dance,” in acknowledgment of an old child’s toy, which often (but not always) depicted a stereotyped black man. Jig (or “jigger”) dance toys do not, however, automatically represent a racist viewpoint, so one could argue about this matter endlessly instead of enjoying Astaire’s performance, especially when he’s dancing in front of, and competing with, three gigantic, identically-dressed silhouettes.*\n\nIn Swing Time Fred’s a dancer (although he makes his living as a gambler… I said the finale was silly, and it is, but not any sillier than that plot-point) but when he meets Ginger, a dance instructor, pretends he isn’t so she’ll be forced to teach him. This leads to what seems to me the most joyous dance in the series, “Pick Yourself Up,” wherein when Astaire is forced to show off to save Rogers’ job they, in Arlene Croce‘s memorable phrase, “leave the place in flames.” With “Never Gonna Dance,” Astaire’s and Rogers’ characters bid heartbreaking adieu to each other in dance, and it’s arguably the most dramatic dance number the movies had ever seen to that time. Nothing the pair did before or after comes close… which of course means no one else could either.\n\nThe Homecoming: A Christmas Story (1971) I vividly recall watching this lovely TV movie at the age of 10, on its first airing, and thinking it was the most remarkable small-screen drama I’d ever seen. A lot of other people must have felt the same way because two years later Earl Hamner, Jr.’s warm and essentially happy Depression-era family (based on his own and called the Spencers in his books) re-emerged on CBS as “The Waltons,” under which rubric they reigned for nine seasons. A few things were gained in the transition: That genial old radical Will Geer replaced Edgar Bergen as the grandfather and the splendid Ralph Waite took over from Andrew Duggan as the patriarch John Walton. (Bergen is fine in the movie, mind you, but Geer was intensely memorable.) One casting change was essentially a draw: Joe Conley replacing Woodrow Parfrey as Ike Godsey. Two others, however, represented if not a loss at least a disappointment: While Helen Kleeb and Mary Jackson as the innocent elderly bootleggers the Baldwin sisters in the series were amusing, Josephine Hutchinson and Dorothy Stickney in the movie provided the story’s modest diadem with two sparkling gems.\n\nAll of the movie’s children returned for “The Waltons,” thankfully, including the marvelous Richard Thomas as the eldest, as did Ellen Corby as their flinty grandmother. The single gravest loss between movie and series was in their respective Olivia Waltons. I remember my friend Laura complaining to me at age 12 that Michael Learned was far too beautiful for the role, but beauty isn’t really the issue. A woman can be conventionally pulchritudinous and raise seven children in the mountains of Virginia. It’s the wear that matters. No one would have called Patricia Neal unattractive, but her Olivia looks as if she has lived every year of that experience, and earned every crow’s foot. More important, Neal was a great actress, and Learned merely a good one. The way, when her husband returns after being thought lost, hurt or dead, Neal’s Olivia turns her back to the family and staggers slightly, briefly giving in to the tears she has been holding back all day and night in her vigil, is quietly shattering and I suspect her performance, taken in toto, was the finest American television ever knew.\n\nShall We Dance (1937) The financial returns on this, the seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, were less than half those of its predecessor, which suggested to some that the partnership was slipping with the public but there’s little reason, it seems to me, to suppose that. Rather, it was the way the team was being treated by their studio that pushed the audience away. It certainly didn’t help that they are expected to accept Fred as a Russian ballet star, a thing I’m surprised Astaire didn’t quash in the writing; he had no sympathy with the ballet and certainly little aptitude for it, and the central complication (are the pair married or aren’t they?) is at best mildly diverting and at worst annoying. It’s telling that, in addition to the credited scenarists Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano, Lee Loeb and Harold Buchman got story credit, P.J. Wolfson adaptation credit and at least three uncredited writers (Anne Morrison Chapin, James Gow and Edmund H. North) either worked on the treatment or the final script. The whole thing has a feeling of polished desperation about it, and that many writers on as slight a story as this surely indicates something.\n\nGeorge Gershwin, whose last full score this was, complained bitterly that the filmmakers did not exploit his and his brother Ira’s songs sufficiently, and he had a point. Fred sings a brief “(I’ve Got) Beginner’s Luck” to Ginger but there is no dance to go with the vocal, for example, and where a dance of loss seems absolutely required after he sings “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” to her, they’re on a fog-bound ferry so there’s no place for them to dance. Astaire has a great routine with a luxury liner’s engine room crew to “Slap That Bass,” one of his engaging specialties, but I don’t see how the song could have become a hit. “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” did eventually find its way into the American song book, despite rather than due to Fred and Ginger’s Central Park roller skating routine to it as did “They All Laughed,” which Rogers sings wearing a wonderfully designed flowered skirt that shows off her remarkably slender waist and which she and Astaire perform in one of their charming challenge dances. But the title number had no real chance to catch on, not only because the dance to it is based on a gimmick (a chorus of dancers wearing Ginger masks and which Rogers joins to Fred’s consternation) but largely because it is introduced by the gruesome contortions of the alleged prima ballerina Harriet Hoctor, the worst routine in the Astaire-Rogers filmography. And to think they offered her the lead in this picture!\n\nDie Hard (1988) Despite the godawful performances of Paul Gleason, William Atherton, Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush and, especially, the appalling Hart Bochner, this exercise in style, smoothly directed by John McTiernan, excitingly filmed by Jan de Bont and wonderfully scored by Michael Kamen, remains one of the few superior “high concept” pictures of its time. The 4K UHD edition looks spectacular, and the witty war of attrition between Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman is evergreen.\n\nEaster Parade (1948) If while watching this Irving Berlin songbook musical you have the sense that Fred Astaire’s character might have been better suited to the more caddish Gene Kelly, it was written for him. When Kelly broke an ankle his role was offered to Astaire, then in semi-retirement and bored. The screenplay, by Sidney Sheldon, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, is merely serviceable and of the four major characters one, played by Peter Lawford, floats in and out of the action to no discernable purpose. What matters most in Arthur Freed musicals, however, is the music, and Berlin largely delivers, from Astaire’s cleverly-conceived “Drum Crazy,” performed to distract a child holding the plush bunny Fred wishes to buy, to “We’re a Couple of Swells,” his comic hobo duet with Judy Garland, which became a staple of her stage act for years afterward. I suppose these days hoboes, like hillbillies, are a protected species and can’t be joked about any longer.\n\nAstaire got a good ballad (“It Only Happens When I Dance With You”) but his big specialty number, “Steppin’ Out with My Baby,” is one of his very few routines that is more irritating than pleasurable, what with his weird vocal that sounds as if he filled the lower part of his face with air before singing, plus all that slow-motion dancing, which couldn’t happen on a stage anyway, so why was it done? Was Fred just that indifferent to it? (The insert of Garland pantomiming her ecstatic approval while he dances wasn’t fooling anyone; the number is a lox.) Even worse is that lugubrious snooze “The Girl on the Magazine Cover,” crooned by some po-faced vocalist called Richard Beavers whom no one ever heard of again, and Ann Miller’s typically manic tap-routine to “Shakin’ the Blues Away.” Garland, although looking thin and wan and entirely unhealthy, still lands an emotional ballad (“Better Luck Next Time”) which for my money is one of Berlin’s finest. Charles Walters directed efficiently, and the rather good Technicolor cinematography is by Harry Stradling. The orchestrations, however, are for a story set in 1912 as phony and oppressive as Miller’s grin.\n\nThe central concern of the movie for Don Hewes, the Astaire figure, is his inability to get over his former dancing partner, played by Ann Miller. But how could anyone become obsessed with Ann Miller?\n\nJFK (1991) The late Richard Belzer liked to remind people that, whatever their feelings about John F. Kennedy, or how and why and by whom he was killed, a man died that day in Dallas — horribly. 60 years on the number of those who remember has dwindled considerably, that of those who know at all has been alarmingly reduced, and those who care constitute an even smaller minority. But it was a coup d’état, and we (and the world) have been increasingly the poorer for it ever since.\n\nRoyal Wedding (1951) Alan Jay Lerner wrote the script and lyrics for this often beguiling musical about an American brother-and-sister act re-opening their latest Broadway stage hit in London at the time of Elizabeth’s nuptials. The team played by Fred Astaire and Jane Powell was based by Lerner on Fred and his sister Adele, with whom he enjoyed an extremely popular partnership from their childhood to her own marriage with an English Lord in 1932. The screenplay was originally developed for Fred and June Allyson, who had to back out due to her pregnancy, when it was re-imagined for Judy Garland. She was at her lowest emotional ebb at the time, however, and when she insisted on only working half-days the producer, Arthur Freed, had her replaced with Jane Powell. (Whew!) All of them were too young to be believably Astaire’s sister (he was in his 50s at the time) but Powell, with her diminutive stature and elfin smile, was a good choice; although Adele Astaire was not the singer Powell was, the actress essentially playing her seems to me ideally suited to expressing the irrepressible qualities that made Fred’s sister such a beloved figure, on and off the stage.\n\nMuch of Royal Wedding floats on a cloud of charm and its songwriters knew it. After several such numbers Burton Lane, the composer, suggested to Lerner that they come up with something raucous or the movie would charm itself to death. This led to their broad vaudeville turn for Astaire and Powell, “How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Love You When You Know I’ve Been a Liar All My Life,” which a lot of people now assume when they hear of it to have been a county-and-Western song. It’s the sort of thing no one associated with Astaire (or Lerner), brassy and utterly untroubled by subtlety. Powell and Astaire are so well matched in the number, and so funny, you may wish there were more routines in the picture like it. The odd thing about this movie concerning siblings is that in their three on-stage numbers the pair are depicted as lovers, something Fred and Adele avoided in their shows. (The pieces from Astaire and Powell’s show are all also, in typical Freed Unit style, obvious revue numbers at a time when the musical stage revue was dying if not already dead.) Unfortunately, Astaire got paired with Sarah Churchill, the faintly equine offspring of the late Prime Minister, and she doesn’t dance, so he’s left to his own devices. On the other hand, this may have spurred him to work even harder on his solos and so we get the wordless “Sunday Jumps,” where he does a workout in a ship’s gymnasium and makes a coat-rack look elegant, and the invigorating “You’re All the World to Me,” in which he famously dances on the ceiling of his hotel suite, a visual metaphor that summed up Astaire’s appeal.\n\nSome of the comedy is a bit wan, as when we’re supposed to believe that the identical twins played by Keenan Wynn could speak in different accents, American and British, or stomach a subplot involving Albert Sharpe and his estranged wife, but overall the picture is a treat, especially in an approved DVD; Royal Wedding went out of copyright several decades ago and until recently the only way to see it was in a washed-out video copy that robbed Robert Planck’s color photography of nearly all its values. Stanley Donen provided the crisp direction, Nick Castle (with Astaire) the spritely choreography, and the ballads by Lane and Lerner are gorgeous, especially when sung by Jane Powell. Although her “Open Your Eyes,” danced with Astaire, is deliberately sabotaged for comic effect, “Too Late Now” is as supple and lovely a number as can be imagined and “The Happiest Day of My Life” a romantic dream. The picture finishes up, musically anyway, with “I Left My Hat in Haiti,” a number so sensuous and colorful you may be forgiven for not noticing that all of the Haitians in it are, er, Caucasian.\n\nLonesome (1928) An imaginative dramatic comedy directed by the Hungarian stylist Paul Fejös which tries perhaps a bit too hard to be different but which is filled with fascinating compensations. There are those who place the picture on the same shelf as Murnau’s Sunrise; I certainly wouldn’t go that far, but this slightly wan fable about two lonely, unattached working-class New Yorkers meeting by chance at Coney Island on the Fourth of July is often beautifully observed (the screenplay was by Tom Reed and Edward T. Lowe, Jr. from a story by Mann Page) when it isn’t banging around, pushing your face in frenetic whimsy and throttling you with its cinematic cleverness. It’s obvious that Fejös (born Pál Fejős), working with the cinematographer Gilbert Warrenton and the editor Frank Atkinson, saw in the material a chance to experiment, although his previous work The Last Moment, depicting the final thoughts of a suicide, was described by a contemporary reviewer as being filled with “dizzying wipes, multiple superimpositions and vertiginous camera movements,” which Lonesome is as well, somewhat to its detriment.\n\nWhat’s best about the picture is what’s simplest: The tremulous love story between Barbara Kent and Glenn Tryon, devastatingly threatened when they are separated through an accident and neither knows the other’s surname. (The resolution is impossible but it works emotionally, so its lack of logic in a sense doesn’t matter.) There are also some lovely effects, such as when hand-tinted color turns a tawdry amusement park into a place of magic, and the rollercoaster sequence, presumably filmed using the hand-held Imo camera, puts you in the front car (and at night!) decades before Mike Todd captured the experience for moviegoers in This is Cinerama. Unfortunately, Universal added dialogue scenes without Fejös’ input, and although Tryon plays them well enough they’re stilted and weirdly isolated, as if a spotlight has been turned on the actors and everything around them elided out. Kent is rather obvious in her pantomime but Tryon is oddly engaging and even when his character is being a braggart to impress the girl you empathize with him instead of finding him off-putting. That’s a lot more interesting than a bunch of vertiginous camera movements.\n\nChristmas in July (1940) Preston Sturges’ second picture as a writer-director is a fast (67 minutes), funny satire on American commercialism and acquisitiveness that is also its maker’s sweetest comedy. Dick Powell plays an office drudge with dreams of winning the grand prize in a jingle contest for coffee with his punning entry — “If you can’t sleep at night it’s not the coffee, it’s the bunk,” a line that gets funnier the more it’s invoked, although I wonder how many people now understand what it means — and Ellen Drew is his girl. It’s full of Sturges’ trademark pithy observations and marvelously skewed dialogue and, of course, his unofficial stock company including Raymond Walburn, William Demerest, Ernest Truex, Harry Rosenthal and Franklin Pangborn. Just when the outcome is tightening your belly, Sturges rescues his hapless protagonists with a deus ex machina that sends you out on a high. (And yes, that cat is grinning. The effect was achieved with a slightly terrifying bit of animation.)\n\nCasablanca (1942) It’s rather sobering to watch this perennial favorite now, when the America to which the refugees of 1942 wished to escape from the Nazis in Europe has become a nation that officially supports neo-Nazis in Ukraine and Jewish proto-Nazis in Israel/Gaza.\n\nOh, well. The 4K UHD edition looks lovely.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\n*And no, Virginia, “jig” when applied to dance is not racist terminology, despite the teeth-gnashing of the Woke Ignoratti. (Nor is it, even if Millennials and their Gen-Z successors believe so, interchangeable with the word “gig.”) “Jigger,” it will shock them to learn, is innocent as well. These people are like the old movie censors: By their hysteria they suggest that their own racist impulses are at work in their protestations; by their volubility, they only encourage the rest of us to use the words they object to more often.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click the links on the capsules for the complete reviews.\n\nHopscotch (1980) Brian Garfield’s engaging espionage thriller transformed by him (and Bryan Forbes) into a comic spy caper and a terrific vehicle for Walter Matthau. Interestingly, Garfield’s book ends with a gesture by the Matthau character the author appears to have lifted from the 1973 Charley Varrick, which also starred Matthau but it’s less a literary steal than a likeable homage. Although entirely implausible — if a CIA agent actually did what Matthau’s Miles Kendig does in the movie, even that bunch of incompetents would track down and kill him — it’s thoroughly enjoyable watching Kendig twit his petty martinet of a boss (Ned Beatty, exquisitely frustrated) and evade, not merely his bright underling (Sam Waterston) but the KGB faction headed by the imperturbable Herbert Lom. Glenda Jackson had so much fun with Matthau making the delightful sleeper hit House Calls two years earlier that she signed on for what amounts to an enjoyable recurrent cameo as Miles’ sly inamorata. Pleasantly directed by Ronald Neame, warmly photographed by Arthur Ibbetson and Brian W. Roy and scored by Ian Fraser with (at Matthau’s request) some lively bits of Mozart, Hopscotch is as inconsequential as mousse au chocolate, and nearly as delicious. (Sole cavil: I could have done without the Jackson character referring to a particularly hapless spy as a “Follett the faygelah.”) Amusingly, as in Paddy Chayefsky’s script for The Hospital, several of the characters share surnames with notable mystery and thriller writers: not only Follett but Ross, Ludlum, Fleming and Westlake (first name: Parker).\n\nDestry Rides Again (1939) The enormously entertaining James Stewart-Marlene Dietrich Western, perfectly judged and with a sumptuous look courtesy of its inspired lighting director, Hal Mohr.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (1940) Nunnally Johnson’s very fine adaptation of the epoch-capturing John Steinbeck novel, directed with extraordinary sensitivity by John Ford, photographed by Gregg Toland with almost shocking documentary realism, and among the least artificial sound pictures of Hollywood’s so-called Golden Age.\n\nWhat a Way to Go! (1964) A big, bloated, spasmodically amusing shaggy-dog comedy starring Shirley MacLaine in her adorable kitten period and with a host of guest-stars (Dick Van Dyke, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Gene Kelly) as her ill-fated husbands, who get comic material of highly variable quality. The central joke of this DeLuxe-colored bauble is that Shirley, as the hapless Louisa May Foster, hates money but each of her successive husbands somehow inadvertently becomes obscenely rich and then is killed in ever more outrageous ways, leaving her yet another fortune. It’s fairly anemic to have come from the authors of Singin’ in the Rain and the director of The Guns of Navarone; the Betty Comden and Adolph Green script indulges the team’s penchant for overstated satire, only snippets of which (particularly those involving MacLaine and Van Dyke) are funny. An extended sequence featuring ever more ludicrous Edith Head costumes and poking fun, I think, at Ross Hunter (“Lush Budgett presents…”) goes on and on (and on) until you never want to see MacLaine again in anything more haute couture than a burlap sack.\n\nAside from the Mitchum character, who turns his back on his fortune, the gentle Jekylls Louisa marries turn so quickly, and so completely, into ravenous Hydes when money is in their grip that the situations become ridiculous even for an overblown farce like this one. Examples: Newman, who as an American artist in Paris resembles an Actors Studio dropout imitating a Teamster, with success suddenly sounds like Richard Burton (one of several Burton jokes in the picture); the passive, agreeable Van Dyke becomes a parody of the worst, barking CEO; and Kelly, a sweet-natured nightclub comedian content with being an employed failure, turns into a nightmare version of Harry Langdon, every shred of his charm obliterated. The best moments in the picture occur early and involve Margaret Dumont (whose last movie this was) as Louisa’s harpy of a mother and Van Dyke and MacLaine in a silent movie parody.\n\nThe redoubtable Leon Shamroy provided his customary beautiful color cinematography and Nelson Riddle an infectious musical score, but the best that can be said of J. Lee Thompson’s direction is that it is a professional job without the slightest individual characteristics or visual interest. The movie was originally developed for Marilyn Monroe and, after her death, reconfigured for Elizabeth Taylor. It’s possible to imagine Monroe in the role although I can’t see her bringing to it the intelligence MacLaine projects. (Taylor, who given a good enough line could seem witty, was never a comedian and would have been utterly wrong save for the fact that Louisa’s multiple marriages mirrored her own busy nuptial life.) Bob Cummings’ performance as Louisa’s psychiatrist is as unsubtle as the rest of the picture, and Dean Martin seems merely along for the ride. For those interested in coincidental trivia, Newman’s painter character is named Larry Flint.\n\nAn Unmarried Woman (1978) Paul Mazursky’s miraculous study of a woman whose life is turned upside down by her husband’s infidelity. Jill Clayburgh gives a luminous performance in the central role.\n\nThe Last Valley (1970) I was enormously impressed by this intelligent parable of the Thirty Years’ War the first time I saw it, less so on seeing it a second time after reading the bracing short novel by J.B. Pick upon which it is based. The book (whose original American title, A Last Valley, is far superior to that used by the filmmakers — what a difference an article can make) is a poetic-philosophic rumination on theology, violence, the natures of war and of men, conducted via a narrative of power and survival waged between civil forces in a secluded German glen. Pick’s story is so tightly structured that to pull out a single thread means remaking it anew. Alas, thread-pulling is what James Clavell, who adapted and directed The Last Valley, seems to have been intent on. It’s still a beautifully mounted production, with glorious cinematography by John Wilcox, a splendid Lion in Winteresque score by John Barry and superb central performances by Michael Caine as the cynical military Captain who no longer knows nor cares whose side he is fighting on and Omar Sharif as the former academic-turned-hardscrabble-survivor desperately trying to navigate between factions. Although both characters die at the end of the book as well as in the movie, the way they die matters enormously, and Clavell I’m afraid drains the meaning from those deaths, as well as the author’s savage yet eminently sensible irony.\n\nThe Flight of the Phoenix (1965) An effective thriller with a tight screenplay by Lukas Heller, efficient direction by Robert Aldrich and sterling ensemble acting by its mostly male cast. Heller’s script hews closely to the intelligent, entertaining novel by Elleston Trevor, the author (under the nom de plume Adam Hill) of the Quiller books, and even improves on it a little. Beautifully photographed by Joseph Biroc and edited with panache by Michael Luciano the picture, about a group of men stranded in the Arabian desert when their transport plane crashes in a sandstorm, stars James Stewart as the captain devastated by the disaster, Richard Attenborough as his humane navigator, Peter Finch as a soft-spoken military man and Hardy Krüger as a maddeningly aloof and arrogant designer. Krüger’s character is so psychotically rigid he seems almost a new edition of the wartime Aryan. (In the novel he was British, as was everyone else.) The only major change from the book is the addition of a French doctor played by Brando’s old playmate Christian Marquand; he’s able to attend an injured youth, and later goes off with the Captain on his doomed, self-determined mission. His inclusion, however, adds little or nothing of value to the narrative. Of much greater interest are Ernest Borgnine as a pitiable mental case, Ian Bannen as a sarcastic oil fields laborer, Dan Duryea as a gentle worrier, Ronald Fraser as a career soldier who despises his superior officer, George Kennedy as a more easy-going worker, and, in a vision of the delirious soldier, Barrie Chase.\n\nThe picture ends with this rather curious dedication: “It should be remembered that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer, gave his life in the making of this film.” No, he didn’t. Someone on the filmmaking team fucked up on the safety of the movie’s makeshift airplane, and got Mantz killed through negligence. His life was taken from him, he didn’t give it.\n\n“Gave his life”! For a movie. Jesus wept.\n\nFearless (1993) Speaking of improvements on literary originals, Rafael Yglesias’ script for Fearless trims the self-indulgent fat from his own otherwise very good novel and focuses the narrative sharply, very much to the story’s benefit. It’s about two survivors of a commercial airline crash, unknown to each other before the event, and what the life-altering incident does to each of them. Carla, whose toddler was lost during the crash, becomes nearly catatonic with grief, depression and guilt; Max, who survived because he moved from his seat to comfort a frightened young boy traveling alone, behaves as if he’s invincible, unkillable. Meanwhile Max’s faltering marriage slips further away from him, his own young son is a stranger and he closes his successful architectural firm, drifting without purpose when he isn’t challenging death by performing such seemingly self-destructive stunts as balancing on the ledge of an apartment building, eating the strawberries he’s allergic to or, with (to her) apparent selflessness, proving to Carla that she could not have prevented her son’s death and nearly killing himself in the process.\n\nMax is a maddening character in the novel and would probably be equally as difficult to like with an actor less charmingly natural than Jeff Bridges playing him. Bridges has one of the most expressive faces in movies, and when he smiles in pleasure, the effect is almost like seeing the emotion depicted onscreen for the first time. It makes you understand what Max is feeling without your being told in words; you’re plugged into the character in a way that somehow eludes you on the page. As Carla, Rosie Perez gives a performance so completely raw, unstudied and without artifice it’s searing, and in a way we seldom experience movie acting. I’m tempted to say that Perez turns grieving into an art form, but that’s not exactly what I mean. Her performance in Fearless has the sort of impact we get from watching the young Brando, or from seeing Sally Field in the TV miniseries “Sybil.” It’s one of those things that seem to be beyond acting, and in that way Jeff Bridges is the perfect co-star for her. Together they create a kind of documentary realism, each complementing and in a sense completing the other’s work.\n\nFearless was directed by Peter Weir with both sensitivity and an impressive lack of sensationalism. Taking his cue from Yglesias’ writing, Weir and his gifted cinematographer Allen Daviau shoot the airplane sequences (they occur largely in flashback) not as if he’s trying to wring your guts through suspense yet making it abundantly clear what going through an airplane crash must be like. These scenes, and those following the accident, have a surreal quality which if you’ve ever been through a freak violent crash of any sort you recognize immediately. The three editors (William M. Anderson, Armen Minasian and Lee Smith) deserve real credit here as well for the impressive way these sequences play out, and for the excellence of the movie generally. Fearless was one of those rare, thoroughly satisfying, ’90s movies aimed at adults and which, naturally, was a flop at the box office. No one involved need experience the slightest sense of shame for that.\n\nSlap Shot (1977) This thoroughly engaging Paul Newman comedy about a slipping Pennsylvania hockey franchise whose fortunes change when it starts playing with greater violence got a lot of ink in its day not entirely because it was perhaps the most consistently, and often hilariously, foul-mouthed American movie up to that time but due to its having been written by (gasp!) a woman. Nancy Dowd, who a year later shared an Academy Award for the gaseous screenplay for Coming Home, based some of the picture’s plot and incidents on things her hockey-playing brother Ned told her. (He appears in Slap Shot in a funny bit as a bad-tempered goon.) As might be imagined in a frank sports movie, there are things said by some of the characters, including Newman’s Reggie Dunlop, that would cause picketing at the very least today. One of the movie’s funniest moments in 1977 involved Reggie telling the mercenary owner of the team that her young son was “a faggot.” The boy is just a child, and has exhibited no unusual behavior so it’s clear the remark isn’t directed at him at all but at his insufferable mother; Reggie knows it’ll get a rise out of her, and it does, and the shock of it for the audience was nearly as pronounced. People (including myself) roared because of the outrageousness of the line, and Newman’s nonchalance with it. I won’t spoil your possible pleasure by quoting it in full, and I presume you are broadminded enough not to be offended by it. I trust you will not betray my faith in you. Or am I being a foolish optimist?\n\nJust about everything in the picture works. The only tiresome gambit is the older player (Brad Sullivan) who talks about little other than sex, and women’s breasts, and seems (to me, anyway) by these excessive displays of heterosexual lust to be trying to prove something to himself. But he’s a minor character, and he’s more than offset by Strother Martin as the prevaricating team manager, Michael Ontkean* as the single player who refuses to go along with the changeover from skill to violence, Lindsay Crouse as his discontented wife, Jerry Houser as a sweet-natured player who decides on the utterly inappropriate nickname “Killer,” Andrew Duncan (complete with trademark wretched toupée) as a grinning fool of a local sportscaster, the young Swoosie Kurtz as a jolly player’s wife and the riotous team of Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson as the Hansen Brothers, a trio of bespectacled idiots who kick off the Charlestown Chiefs’ violent turn. The only member of the cast who weighs the picture down is Jennifer Warren; as Reggie’s ex-wife she gives the same sort of weird line-readings that put me off her equally irritating performance in the otherwise splendid Night Moves. George Roy Hill directed with his usual intelligent grace, and while we didn’t realize it at the time, his movie depicted the beginnings of the phenomenon, sped up by Reagan and his successors, of the destruction of American labor through the closure of native manufacturing. Seeing Slap Shot now, this depressing sub-theme gives the comedy an underlying frisson of sadness.\n\nBlue Skies (1946) One of those dispiriting “songbook” musicals highlighting a composer or composer/lyricist team — in this case Irving Berlin — that, aside from the songs and the stars, offers very little in the way of entertainment. (The previous Berlin extravaganzas, Holiday Inn and Easter Parade, are almost infinitely better, and they weren’t all that great to begin with.) Worse, it’s yet another Fred Astaire picture in which he either barely dances, or for which the choreography is minimal. Berlin gets the lion share of the blame here because the alleged story was his idea: A singer (Bing Crosby) and a dancer-singer (Astaire) spend years fighting over the same woman, who inexplicably loves the less reliable of them. There is in Arthur Sheekman’s perfunctory screenplay absolutely no trace of the man Groucho Marx called “The Fastest Wit in the West,” merely of a man dejectedly following orders. The only laughs in the movie stem from Billy De Wolfe’s “Mrs. Murgatroyd” routine, an early example of what would later be called gender-fuck. For the rest of the picture he runs around pretending to be heteroseuxally enamored of Olga San Juan. Pull the other one, Billy.\n\nThere are three good dances, and of these one is full of wan “comedy” (“A Couple of Song and Dance Men”) and another (“Heat Wave”) is truncated by the drama of a drunken Astaire falling from an absurd stage height. The best of this trio, however, is a masterpiece: Astaire’s magical challenge dance with nine little Freds to a slightly censored version of “Puttin’ on the Ritz” sans the original’s tone of mockery towards Blacks. Ever the perfectionist, Astaire filmed each of his alter egos separately. The rest of the numbers are just Berlin plugging his old songs in a Technicolor soup so garish you have to amuse yourself by watching the shadows on the ceilings just to keep your eyes from watering in irritation. The crowning glory is the performance by the singularly un-gifted Joan Caulfield, which is of such a mind-numbing badness it beggars belief. When I saw her co-star billing in the credits I wondered who her agent was. Later I discovered she was at the time Crosby’s mistress, and imposed on the picture over the objections of the director, Stuart Heisler. Let that serve as a demonstration of what can happen when you mix business with pleasure.\n\n*When Ontkean’s character gets thrown out of the team’s last game he does an elaborate strip-tease on the ice. It’s one of Slap Shot‘s comic highlights, and all too predictably led to that professional homophobe Richard Shickel, writing in Time, singling out the moment. “[I]n the dénouement,” Shickel whinged, “[Ontkean] is forced to go for a broader, cheaper kind of comic response.” Dig that “forced.” Did Shickel think Ontkean didn’t read the script before he signed on to be in the movie? I wonder what really bugged him: The idea of the male striptease, or the sight of an attractive young actor’s naked flesh?\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSee also:\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Three\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/11/the-magic-factory-part-three-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-screenwriters-screenwriting-and-screenplays/\n\nPart Four\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/the-magic-factory-part-four-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-individual-films-and-miscellaneous-titles/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive, and highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices, my self-education and my reading. Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to celebrate, and to recommend, a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the numbered list, when it is finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the totals. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same or a similar topic, I will count them all as one entry.\n\nIt’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nWhen I first began to get interested in movies as something other than a pleasurable pastime I was fortunate to do so in the midst of a veritable explosion of interest in old pictures (most of which were, I realize with a shudder, far younger then than I am now) and a concomitant plethora of books about these movies as the so-called “film generation” of the late 1960s began to publish. In early adolescence I began to buy some of these books, and many of them are still in my library. As with anything one discovers in youth, I retain an affection for many of the movie books I encountered then. Since they are all what I consider good books, I feel no need to apologize for their inclusion here. Most of the titles below do reflect the period of my autodidactic education in film, and my current preference for movies of the past over the seemingly computer-conceived, written, directed and performed inanities of this so far appalling century. I have lost interest in new movies generally, and not because I’ve become a cranky old man — I’ll have you know I was a cranky young man — but because movies, at least in America, alienated me (and, I suspect, legions of others) by their nearly complete capitulation to sequels, remakes, comic-book adaptations and idiot comedy, as well as their disinterest in anything recognizably human. (I dunno, Marge. He sounds cranky to me.) (Yeah? Well, in your hat, fellah.)\n\nI. Actors\n\nSince, generally speaking, even the most self-excoriating memoirs are suspect if only because it’s given to very few to express complete honesty about themselves, their experiences or their memories, I tend to prefer biographies. There too, of course, we are at the mercy of expectation, and all too often, hackery. Fortunately, there have been a number of excellent titles, in both biography and memoir and, for lack of a better term, celebration.\n\n1. “Don’t Fall Off the Mountain” Shirley MacLaine (1970)\n\nThe first of MacLaine’s periodic memoirs was also the freshest; here was a simultaneously sincere and sardonic voice, describing not only her early struggles, her mother-of-all-clichés discovery by Hal Wallis, her important roles (she’s especially piquant concerning her unusual research for Irma La Douce) and her travels, particularly in Africa and Tibet. Among the highlights: The day she slapped the closet-case gossip columnist Mike Connolly.\n\nSee also: You Can Get There from Here (1975) in which MacLaine chronicles her trip to China to film the documentary The Other Half of the Sky.\n\nMy Lucky Stars (1996) MacLaine’s acute dissection of the people with whom she’s worked, including what at the time was arguably the most incisive depiction extant of the manic-depressive wonder that was Frank Sinatra. That one cost her a decades-long friendship.\n\n2. Astaire Dancing: The Musical Films John Mueller (1985)\n\nMueller’s is that rare thing: A useful coffee table book. Its author analyses every one of Fred’s dances, whether solo, duet or ensemble, using multiple frames from the pictures for which Astaire created them to illustrate his descriptions. The insights are often superb and if you occasionally disagree with their author (as when he derides both Judy Garland’s affecting emotional reading of Irving Berlin’s “Better Luck Next Time” in Easter Parade, and the song itself) you can still enjoy the pictures, which so lovingly piece together the joys and intricacies of Astaire’s choreography.\n\nA more recent, 25th anniversary edition from Zip Publishing reproduces the frames in far better quality, with those from Astaire’s color pictures now… er… in color.\n\n3. Changing Liv Ullmann (1977)*\n\nA terse, tart, poetic, beautifully written book by a demonstrably great film actress. She is open about her relationship with Ingmar Bergman, revealing about the ways Hollywood attempted to make her a conventional mainstream figure, and amusing about at least one of her co-stars (Charles Bronson). One of the finest such memoirs ever written, in part because for Ullmann, how she tells her story, and what she has to say about it, is as important as the events she recounts from it.\n\n“I have attained one dream – and acquired ten new ones in its place.\n\n“I have seen the reverse side of something that glitters.“\n\n4. The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book Arlene Croce (1972)\n\nAlthough Pauline Kael in her New Yorker review quarreled a bit with some of Croce’s observations she also wrote, “I think it’s perfectly safe to say that this is the best book that will ever be written about Astaire and Rogers.” That may or may not be the case, but nothing I have read in the years since Croce’s book was published has even come close. The founder of Ballet Review magazine, Croce was for a quarter of a century the dance critic for the New Yorker, so she knew her apples. She was also a lively stylist; since reading this book 40-plus years ago I have been unable to watch the “Pick Yourself Up” dance in Swing Time without recalling what Croce wrote about the climax of it.\n\nAs with Astaire Dancing, Zip has also reissued this book with corrections by Croce and sharper frame reproductions.\n\n5. Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers Joe Adamson (1973)\n\nSpeaking of published studies that haven’t been bettered, no analysis of the Marx Brothers has approached Adamson’s for breadth, intelligence, erudition or wit… although in 1973 he was pilloried for daring to be funny about the Marxes. This quintessential guide to the greatest of all comedy teams was, with The Marx Brothers Scrapbook (see below) my first exposure to Minnie’s boys, before I ever got to see one of their movies (Animal Crackers, in 1976) and the author’s quotations from the films, especially Groucho’s militantly anti-romantic dialogues with Margaret Dumont, made me weak from laughing. As a result of Adamson’s whetting my appetite for all things Marxist, I couldn’t wait to see the actual pictures, and if that is not the highest benefit of great writing about the movies, I’m not sure what is.\n\nSee also: Groucho Hector Arce (1979) The first biography of the Great Grouch, published just two years after his death, is still, somewhat shockingly, pretty much the only one of note. It’s both well researched and richly detailed; the author was an old friend of and ghost writer for Groucho, his book was authorized and he’d been working on it for years when his subject died.\n\nHarpo Speaks! Harpo Marx with Rowland Barber (1961) Although its author makes too many sneering references to “fags” (not bad for someone who counted Alexander Woollcott as one of his best friends) Harpo’s book is for the most part as charming as the whimsical illustrations prepared for it by his beloved wife Susan.\n\nHello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends Charlotte Chandler (1978) A pleasant, wide-ranging collection of interviews with and about Groucho.\n\nThe Marx Brothers Scrapbook Groucho Marx and Richard J. Anobile (1973) Anobile, whose claim to minor fame was concocting books of frame enlargements with dialogue captions, got Groucho and a number of his friends to sit down for interviews, broken up with photographs, newspaper and magazine clippings and programs from the Marx Brothers’ stage shows and movies. The result was so interesting Groucho sued to stop publication, mostly over his own occasionally blue observations. Best example: The photo caption, for a group portrait of the cast of the Broadway Cocoanuts with a conspicuously empty chair at the center for Chico, who according to Groucho “was too busy fucking or playing pool.”\n\nRaised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho’s House Steve Stoliar (1996) Vincent Canby described The Marx Brothers Scrapbook in his review of it as “funny, sad and revealing.” Stoliar’s memoir is all that and more. The young man who as a college student in the 1970s spearheaded the movement to get Universal to restore and reissue Animal Crackers came to work for Groucho as an archivist and stayed long enough to witness Marx’s companion Erin Fleming’s descent into narcissistic abuse, and Groucho’s own concomitant physical decline, undoubtedly hasted by Fleming’s increasing madness. He was still occasionally as sharp as ever: Toward the end when a nurse said she needed to see whether he had a temperature Groucho replied, “Don’t be silly. Everybody has a temperature.” I hear a movie is to be made of this book, with Geoffrey Rush as Groucho. (Hello, Academy nomination!) I’m sure the sale helped Stoliar’s bank account, but I hope the picture never happens. Why must we be confronted so frequently, not with great movie stars, but with facsimiles?\n\n6. I.E., An Autobiography Mickey Rooney (1965)\n\nI first got wind of this one in an admiring “movie book roundup” article in the late 1970s in the West Coast Review of Books and was surprised by how revealing it sounded of an actor I had scant knowledge of or opinion about beyond having moaned at his staggeringly insensitive caricature of Mr. Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany’s and enjoyed his “Let’s put on a show!” montage with Judy Garland in That’s Entertainment! So when a mass-market paperback met my eye in a second-hand book shop not long after, I snapped it up. There is something to be said for writing a memoir when you’re on your uppers; probably Rooney thought he had little to lose in letting down his hair, and although it’s been over four decades since I opened my copy there are a number of passages in it I recall without effort, such as Rooney’s comment on marriage to Ava Gardner (“The quality of [her] womanhood… had pinned me wriggling to a wall”) and L.B. Mayer’s throwing the studio’s one-time box-office savior bodily off the MGM lot for good. Years after reading his book I was unpleasantly surprised by the Rooney interviews in the Turner MGM documentary When the Lion Roared; I had been anticipating his reiterating his litany of complaints about the studio generally (and Mayer specifically) and was nonplussed by his mealy-mouthed, butter-wouldn’t-melt turnabout. Suddenly MGM was a wonderful place, no one at the studio ever hurt Judy Garland, and how dare anyone criticize it, or Mayer? I shouldn’t have been shocked, although I think I was right to be disgusted: This was the ageing Rooney speaking, the rediscovered Rooney, the post-Sugar Babies Rooney — the Rooney who was no longer a has-been but who had become an institution; naturally he had to defend his fellow institutions. While no one else can defend Rooney himself for Mr. Yunioshi, or indeed the young Mickey when he’s behaving almost like a feral Jerry Lewis prototype avant la lettre, like the little girl of fame, when he is good in a movie he is very good indeed. So is his book.\n\n7. John Wayne’s America Garry Wills (1997)\n\nI won’t say Wills’ magisterial study of the 20th century’s most popular American movie star changed my life. That would be absurd. It is, however, perhaps the most influential book about the movies I’ve ever read. It, and a weekend-long AMC film preservation festival of John Ford pictures about 20 years ago re-formed my ideas about Ford and Wayne, and indeed concerning the entire Western genre, about which I had been an appalling snob. My life has been considerably enriched since I invited these men and their movies into it, and I owe much to Wills’ book for relaxing my rigidity. He not only sees his subject plain, but with a fairness that is not sullied by ideological bent; books on Wayne prior to this one tended to be hagiographic, and written by either hacks or love-it-or-leave-it types, or both. Wayne for Wills is not the monolithic figure of rectitude favored by those who share the late movie star’s politics nor the hateful bugbear of left-liberalism but a man of strong gifts and beliefs, and equally strong contradictions and flaws. Wills brings a thoughtfulness to his subject that verges on, if it does not spill over into, genuine profundity.\n\n8. The Laurel and Hardy Book Leonard Maltin, editor (1973)\n\nThis was the earliest movie book I ever purchased, at around age 12, and that copy is still in my collection. (And still in surprisingly good condition, all things considered). A nearly perfect pocket history of L & H, the book provides a complete filmography, including extensive lists of the dozens of shorts Stan and Babe made before their teaming, accounts of the filming of specific titles, and knowledgeable chapters celebrating the recurrent character actors (James Finlayson, Charley Chase. Arthur Housman, Charlie Hall) whose appearances were so indelible a part of Laurel&Hardyland. The Curtis Film Series was one of the happiest paperback events of the early 1970s, with, among other things, several titles written and/or edited by Maltin on child stars and character actors (The Reel Stars) as well as individual volumes on Boris Karloff, Don Siegel and Preston Sturges. About the only complaint one could lodge against the series was that the paper Curtis chose for it rendered the many photographs in each book notably fuzzy. (In the same period Curtis also produced mass market reprints, in conjunction with the Broadway musical olio Lorelei, of Anita Loos’ Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes with, alas, poor facsimiles of Ralph Barton’s wonderful illustrations.) Naturally, the Curtis Film Series was a good thing that couldn’t last long; the publisher closed up shop in 1974.\n\nSee also: Mr. Laurel & Mr. Hardy: An Affectionate Biography of Laurel and Hardy John McCabe, Introduction by Dick Van Dyke (1966) The subtitle says it all. McCabe spent much of a lifetime researching and writing about L & H. He also established the international Sons of the Desert society for L&H aficionados. I don’t know how I neglected this lovely book on the first go-’round, but thanks to Eliot M. Camarena for the reminder!\n\nStan and Ollie: The Roots Of Comedy – The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy Simon Louvish (2001), which delves deeply into Stan’s extensive creative input, for better or worse, into the comedies he made with Babe Hardy.\n\n9. Montgomery Clift Patricia Bosworth (1980)\n\nBosworth — her surname so appropriately close to Boswell — was an incisive, sympathetic biographer, which God knows Clift needed. She presents him in all his contradictory glory and effectively (if depressingly) limns Clift’s precipitous personal decline following his disfiguring 1955 automobile accident. For a man who from adolescence habitually stared at himself in mirrors, not merely in narcissism but apparently out of lust, losing his vaunted looks was a massive blow to Clift’s psyche. (Montgomery Clift makes it clear that, while Monty was bisexual, his chief attraction was to men.) That he was one of the most beautiful men ever to have been photographed by a movie camera is self-evident. That he brought a new style of acting to the screen, before Brando, and a remarkable sensitivity to his performances, has been largely forgotten. Bosworth reminds you why Clift was important.\n\nSee also: Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman (2011) Bosworth was a nearly lifelong friend to Fonda, and wrote what is, as far as I am aware, the most unflinching and honest portrait of her. Despite her having given some superb performances including what I maintain is the finest film portrayal of the last 50 years, the woman herself has long seemed to me confused to the point of needing professional help. Who else, in the turbulent 1960s, had to deliberately seek out a cause about which to concern herself (because everyone else had one) when they were practically growing on trees? Further, who, having finally decided on Vietnam as her cause, allowed herself to be manipulated into being photographed, laughing, with anti-aircraft machinery by the nation against which, whatever you think of that stinking conflict, her country was at war? Fonda’s family was practically the textbook example of dysfunctional, yet she has spent much of her life searching for a Daddy surrogate and marrying one after another. And while she considers herself a feminist, moreover, Fonda routinely pays the men who work for her more than the women. She is, in short, and for all her thespic gifts, exceptionally reactionary, even for Hollywood. Bosworth cannot tell you exactly why Fonda behaves as she does, but she gets the details down in all their painful prolificacy. After reading her book I still admire Jane Fonda the screen actress; I’d be a fool not to. But Fonda the woman sends shivers of despair up my spine.\n\n10. Who the Hell’s In It: Portraits and Conversations Peter Bogdanovich (2004)\n\nForty years’ worth of appreciations of and interviews with several of the most durable of film stars, conducted by a man besotted by the movies. Although Bogdanovich could be repetitious (take a drink each time he writes that some couple or other “fell in love”) and a bit narrow-minded (no one he admired , even Cary Grant, could ever be anything other than absolutely heterosexual, even in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary) this is by and large a splendid collection.\n\nSee also: Pieces of Time: Peter Bogdanovich on the Movies (1973) A few of the chapters in Who the Hell’s In it appeared first in this smaller volume of Bogdanovich’s magazine writing and which includes a fascinating view of John Ford filming Cheyenne Autumn on location and a memorable interview with James Stewart in which the man I consider the finest of all American movie actors gave his interviewer his book’s title.\n\nII. Animation\n\nFor nearly as long as I can remember, I have been under the spell of animated cartoons. As a child I was mad about them, more so than about any other form of filmed (or broadcast) entertainment, and much more so than anyone else I knew of my own age and weight. This extended to the comic books I also came under the thrall of even before I began to read on my own. I was an inveterate “funny animal” reader; Tom and Jerry and Bugs Bunny reprints, the Paul Murray Mickey Mouse and Goofy adventures and the Carl Barks duck stories were my meat, and the only humans who entered my comics universe were Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam, a few of the Harvey characters (and most of them were ghosts or imps) and, especially, the miraculous Little Lulu. I had no interest in superheroes then, and have little now.\n\nBut I see I’ve strayed from my text. Herewith a few of what I consider the best books on the animated cartoon.\n\n11. The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes Cartoons Jerry Beck (2010; reprinted 2020)\n\nA terrific little book buttressed by hundreds of cell reproductions. You can argue with the choices, but fortunately the rankings are alphabetical rather than numerical. What’s Opera, Doc? isn’t the greatest cartoon ever made just because people keep saying it is; it’s not even the best Chuck Jones cartoon. But then, Citizen Kane isn’t Orson Welles’ best movie either, let alone the greatest ever made, and that pointless debate has gone on for decades.\n\nMy only real quarrel with Beck’s book: Why are the titles of these cartoon shorts listed as “Episodes”? Why don’t words mean what they mean any longer?\n\n12. Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare Joe Adamson (1990)\n\nAdamson, one of the best things to happen to the study of classic movie comedy, turns his attention to the greatest of all cartoon stars. The book is not only beautifully laid out but wonderfully written, from its punning subtitle to the witty captions for the illustrations.\n\nSee also: Goofy: The Good Sport Walt Disney Studios (1985) Although this one suffers a bit from the way the studio was pushing “Sport Goofy” as a brand in the mid-’80s, it’s a nice little volume that pays tribute to my favorite animated cartoon character other than Bugs.\n\nI Tawt I Taw a Putty Tat: Fifty Years of Sylvester and Tweety Jerry Beck (1991) A nice volume on the adversarial team. Both characters were created, separately, by Bob Clampett, but redefined and put together by Friz Freleng for his peerless series of visual gag shorts.\n\n13. Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist Chuck Jones (1989)\n\nNo creative artist has given me more pleasure throughout my life than Charles M. Jones. (Desert island cartoon: The Rabbit of Seville.) His thoughtfulness, erudition, wit and self-reflection made him a uniquely literary figure among animators. They could also overlard his later work with far too much philosophical verbosity. But these attributes were decided assets when he came to write his lavishly illustrated memoirs. Chuck Amuck was my favorite new book of its year, the volume I’d been pining for most of my life without knowing it.\n\nSee also: Chuck Jones: A Flurry of Drawings Hugh Kenner (1994) This bright, intelligently written little monograph is a worthy addition to Jonesiana.\n\nChuck Redux: Drawing from the Fun Side of Life Chuck Jones (1996) Not as great a book as its predecessor, but well worth savoring.\n\n14. Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson (1984)\n\nTwo of Walt Disney’s “Nine Old Men” of animation, Thomas and Johnson were also best friends, next-door neighbors, beloved instructors for younger animators and authors of numerous informative books on the craft. This is their finest work, a rich, and richly illustrated, guide to Disney’s achievement. Thomas and Johnson (universally known at Disney as “Frank and Ollie”) were also masters at the art of character, or personality, animation; separately and together they were responsible for some of the loveliest sequences in feature animation: Ollie animated Smee in Peter Pan, the Stepsisters in Cinderella, Icabod Crane in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, King John in Robin Hood and, with Thomas, a great deal of The Jungle Book while Frank animated the dwarves weeping over Snow White’s coffin, Pinocchio’s performance of “No Strings on Me,” Cinderella‘s Stepmother, Captain Hook in Peter Pan, the wizard’s duel in The Sword in the Stone, Mary Poppins‘ dancing penguins, much of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet for the early featurettes and, supremely, the beautiful scene of Lady and Tramp eating spaghetti and exchanging an unexpected kiss. Whether evoking the movement of the natural world is or should be the ultimate goal of animation is highly debatable — Tex Avery’s cartoons don’t give a damn for reality, and there are none funnier — but there is no denying that the Disney artists in their full-length features approximated it better than anyone else. This treasurable volume shows you how.\n\nWhile DVDs fall outside the purview of this survey, I also recommend the lovely 1999 documentary Frank & Ollie without reservation.\n\nSee also: Too Funny for Words: Disney’s Greatest Sight Gags Thomas and Johnson (1987) Thomas once recounted Walt at a story conference complaining, “You guys all think that the world is made up of gags! There isn’t one of you left who could write a lullaby or a love-affair romance in a picture, you all want gags, gags, gags!” Fortunately, most of those gags were good, many were brilliant and quite a few were masterful.\n\nTreasures of Disney Animation Art Walton Rawls, ed. (1982) Not merely a quintessential coffee table book, but practically the size of a piece of furniture.\n\nWalt Disney’s Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation John Canemaker (2001) A beautiful tribute, by a man who is not only an historian of the subject but an animator himself, of the master animators and animation directors on whom Walt relied, more and more as he became distracted by theme parks and other diversions: Les Clark, Marc Davis, Ollie Johnston, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, John Lounsbery, Wolfgang (“Woolie”) Reitherman and Frank Thomas.\n\nWalt Disney and Assorted Other Characters: An Unauthorized Account of the Early Years at Disney’s Jack Kinney (1988) Kinney worked as an animator at the Walt Disney studios from 1932, eventually becoming the director of the great Goofy shorts (which no less an authority than Roger Rabbit called “genius”) in 1940. His book is a fascinating glimpse of the studio in its heyday, written with what one senses is a well-natured, and well-earned, bitterness: Kinney was offered the spot at MGM which Tex Avery eventually accepted, and was foolish enough to ask Walt’s advice about whether he should take it. Disney never forgave him for thinking about leaving. It took nearly 20 years but he finally edged Kinney out in 1958.\n\n15. The F"
