Chump (voiced by Awkwafina) is a supporting character in Illumination's feature film, Migration, and the main protagonist of its short film, Fly Hard. She is the leader of a New York pigeon gang who initially comes into conflict with a duck family but ultimately befriends them and becomes their guide around New York to help them complete their migration to Jamaica.

Personality[]

Pugnacious, cynical and surly, Chump is openly hostile to the first person who dares to denigrate her or her species just as she hates it when people invade her territory. Choleric by nature, she is easily touchy and will raise her voice at insults and wrong words, just as she sometimes ironically confuses the pronunciation of her name with an insult. Initially, she looks down on ducks for always being pampered by humans. She can also be a bit dishonest when it comes to sharing, having initially demanded eighty percent of a sandwich instead of half. Beneath her nonchalant exterior, Chump turns out to be quite sensitive and not all that vile. She quickly took a liking to the Mallards after Pam stood up to her for sandwich shares, earning her respect and friendship while becoming incredibly good-natured towards the duck family. According to her, her anti-social behavior is just a mood swing due to the hypersensitivity of pigeons. She even comes to like Mack following his altercation with the chef, never imagining that one day she would think that from a duck. Her other personality traits include an excessive confidence that leads her to be recklessly hit by vehicles, a relaxed and cool attitude when she is at her most social, and being genuinely sensitive to compliments from others. In terms of interaction, Chump mainly expresses herself with colloquial nicknames whether unfriendly or friendly, such as when she warmly said goodbye to the Mallards by openly saying that she loves them.
