        "text": "It is important to note a few things. Airplane! is a satirical comedy, and the writers were making a joke about language. Jive shares traits with African American Vernacular English (AAVE), but it is not the same. The writers and actors have said that Jive was fabricated, which can be seen in the video here. All of what the Jivemen said was a fabrication of the writers and actors, so trying to translate it without their help would be impossible.\n\nFortunately, they included subtitles for the first scene, which can be found in the full script (subtitles emphasized by me):\n\nJiveman1: Sheeeet, man, that honkey mus' be messin' my old lady got to be runnin' col' upsihd down his head!\n\nSubtitle: GOLLY, THAT WHITE FELLOW SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE OR I WILL PUNCH HIM.\n\nJiveman2: Hey Holm, I can dig it! You know he ain't gonna lay no mo' big rap upon you man!\n\nSubtitle: YES, HE IS WRONG FOR DOING THAT.\n\nJiveman1: I say hey sky, s'other say I won say I pray to J I get the same ol' same ol.\n\nSubtitle: I KNEW A MAN IN A SIMILAR PREDICAMENT, AND HE ENDED UP BEING SORRY.\n\nJiveman2: Knock yourself a pro slick. Gray matter back got perform' us' down I take TCBin, man'.\n\nSubtitle: DON'T BE NAIVE ARTHUR. EACH OF US FACES A CLEAR MORAL CHOICE.\n\nJiveman1: You know wha' they say: See a broad to get that bodiac lay'er down an' smack 'em yack 'em.\n\nSubtitle: EARLY TO BED, EARLY TO RISE, MAKES A MAN HEALTHY, WEALTHY AND WISE.\n\nTogether: Col' got to be! Yo!\n\nSubtitle: HOW TRUE!\n\nTogether: Sheeeeeeet!\n\nSubtitle: GOLLY.\n\nWhen it comes to the second scene you've transposed, the joke is that the older white woman can translate Jive for the stewardess. It doesn't need subtitles for the first part because that would ruin the joke. As Shane Finneran pointed out, there were subtitles for the later part of that interaction:\n\nSecond Jive Dude: What it is, big mama? My mama no raise no dummies. I dug her rap!\n\nSubtitle: Ma'am, I'm not stupid. I understand what she just said.\n\nJive Lady: Cut me some slack, Jack! Chump don' want no help, chump don't GET da help!\n\nSubtitle: Give me a break! If you don't want help, I won't help you!\n\nFirst Jive Dude: Say 'e can't hang, say seven up!\n\nSubtitle: Damn, she implied that he didn't understand!\n\nJive Lady: Jive-ass dude don't got no brains anyhow! Shiiiiit.\n\nSubtitle: Nevermind. He's stupid, anyway."
