        "text": "Dear Readers: The following Q&A first ran in 2020.\n\nDear Amy: My family and I came to America from the Soviet Union when I was a teenager. We became citizens. I got educated here and own a successful business. I write well and speak correctly, with almost no accent. I feel like I am an American.\n\nI love America, and try to learn new things every day, but I feel like something is missing in me.\n\nSince I spent my formative years in a communist country (truly like another planet, compared to the USA), my “autopilot” reactions are not like those of typical American-born people. For instance, my manners, topics of conversation, humor, dress, attitude toward money, and even body language can seem “foreign.”\n\nI feel like it is hurting me to be “culturally different.” I don’t think I say or do anything straight-up offensive – it’s more like a lot of little things.\n\nHow can I fix this “handicap”?\n\nI would love to know how to be more American, but I can’t find any books or courses on the subject.\n\n– NOT Born in the USA\n\nStories by Amy Dickinson\n\nBest of Ask Amy: What are her most-read advice columns of 2024?\n\nAsk Amy: In her final column, Amy shares some wisdom and laments ‘I’ll miss having coffee with you’\n\nAsk Amy: It's wedding season! Check out these hilarious mishaps gathered from Amy's files\n\nDear NOT: As we approach the celebration of another Independence Day, I appreciate this unusual and provocative question, which, honestly – has no “correct” answer.\n\nFirst, I urge you not to see your own cultural background and habits as a “handicap,” but as an asset.\n\nYes, America is a country. But America is also really a series of concepts, experiments, and experiences. It is no one thing.\n\nBut here is a beautiful “American” ideal (so different from the culture you were raised in): All Americans have the right to be uniquely themselves, and that definitely includes you.\n\nHowever, reinvention is baked into the American experience, and so if you want to affect “American” mannerisms, I suggest you become a student of American culture. Take a history course at your local community college. Follow up with a class on cinema and popular culture. Read Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, Sherman Alexie, Gary Shteyngart, and Jericho Brown. Listen to Dolly Parton. Watch “Singing in the Rain,” “Goodfellas,” “Barbershop,” “13 th,” and “Ramy.”\n\nBecome a volunteer firefighter. Teach English as a second language to other newer citizens (teaching American concepts to others will show you how much you actually know). Work at your local polling station during the next election.\n\nWhen you say or do something you believe is “off,” ask a friend to break it down for you. They might choose to tell you what I’m trying to tell you now – which is that your effort makes you the most “American” person they know."
