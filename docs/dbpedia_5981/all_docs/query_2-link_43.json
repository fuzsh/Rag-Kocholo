        "text": "Catscratch is an American animated television series and the twenty-first major Nicktoon created by Doug TenNapel for Nickelodeon. It is a light-hearted adaptation of TenNapel's graphic novel, Gear. The series features music, which was composed by longtime TenNapel collaborator, Terry Scott Taylor. The show is twenty episodes long, tying with The X's and Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is has six episodes less than El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, Tak and the Power of Juju, Bunsen is a Beast, Planet Sheen, and Robot and Monster, and has ten episodes less than Welcome to the Wayne. It, along with The X’s, had the least episode premieres.\n\nShow Summary[]\n\nGordon Quid, Waffle, and Mr. Blik were raised in a mansion by Mrs. Edna Cramdilly, who left them her house and her fortune when she died. The brothers live a life of freedom, adventure, and total madness. They are served by a butler named Hovis, who often supports them on their countless adventures. They will even stop the Chumpy Chump Brothers from annoying and causing them trouble once and for all!\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain article: List of Catscratch characters\n\nGordon Quid[]\n\nGordon is an orange & white cat who is highly generous. He has a Scottish accent and claims to be part of the Highland Quint Clan, despite Blik telling Gordon he was born under the couch like him and Waffle, though later on he is made into an honorary member of the clan. He is highly addictive to food and makes traditional Scottish meals that other people completely despise or does not have the chance to eat it before he does. He is also best friends with Kimberly whom he loves though she sees him as merely a friend due to her young age. He has a low singing voice, which annoys his elder brother, Blik.\n\nWaffle[]\n\nWaffle is a mau and an innocent bonehead. He is one of the only characters of the show that care for others apart from him. He has a newt he named Gomez. Waffles personality is perky, but dumb and is always happy-go-lucky. However, there are some moments where Waffle demonstrates incredible intelligence, such as giving the definition, explanation of a particular word and/or even its circumstance.\n\nMr. Blik[]\n\nMr. Blik is a greedy black cat and a total jerk, but still cares for his brothers in his own way. He has a little bit of heart for Waffle, as seen in To The Moon. He cries for Waffle as they fly back to earth and leave him behind. He is the only one who is highly intelligent, but is greedy.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMany of the cast members in Catscratch were cast in Disney's Lilo & Stitch: The Series, which was airing around the same time.\n\nLiliana Mumy, who voiced Human Kimberly also portrayed Mertle Edmonds.\n\nRob Paulsen, who voiced Gordon, portrayed Experiment 625 (Reuben).\n\nKevin McDonald, who voiced Waffle, portrayed Pleakley.\n\nFrank Welker, who voiced Randall the Bear, portrayed multiple experiments.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nMain article: Catscratch episode list\n\nBroadcast history[]\n\nNickelodeon (original run, July 9, 2005-February 10, 2007; reruns, February 11-June 3, 2007; November 22, 2007)\n\nNickToons (November 25, 2007-January 1, 2009; December 19, 2015)\n\nComics[]\n\nConfirmed by an e-mail from Doug TenNapel, there were some 2-page Catscratch comics in the works for Nickelodeon Magazine.
