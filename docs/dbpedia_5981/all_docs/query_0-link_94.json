        "text": "For companies (not for people), the term \"take it out of petty cash\" could be used.\n\nPetty (from the French, \"petit\", small) cash is designed to be \"effectively ignorable money that can be used for stuff that costs less than the internal cost of expensing it\". Donuts for a meeting; a box of pens; that sort of thing.\n\nNow big companies - especially big companies in the financial sector like Goldman Sachs - tend to actually be more \"rule-bound\" about tiny expenses than many small companies. Partly it's a \"you can't be blamed if you follow the rules even when they're stupid, but you absolutely can be blamed if you don't, even if you save money\"; partly it's the fact that they're under significantly more onerous and more powerful auditing r√©gimes (\"failed SEC audit\" is a heart-stopping phrase on Wall Street); and partly it's because petty cash embezzlement and reporting fraud has in the past been common, and can add up quickly. But the idiom still exists.\n\nWhen I was taking a training course for a ridiculously high-paying (at the time) contract in the Middle East, we were constantly being reminded by our lecturer in \"cultural acclimatisation\" that we would be in a position such that lack of money for casual (and not-so-casual) recreational espenses would in due course not be an issue.\n\nThe phrase he used for the monetary quantities involved, over and over again, was:\n\n\"A mere bagatelle.\"\n\nAnother possibility is 'spare change'. In the UK, the phrase 'spare change' is regularly used and heard. It is associated with people living on the streets as they appeal for 'spare change' from passers by.\n\nAs has already been mentioned 'small change' is also regularly used to describe the few coins people may have in their pockets, but I would say the more common phrase for that would be 'spare change'.\n\nThis is a rarer idiom than some of the others listed like \"pocket change\" and \"peanuts\", but common in my area is the phrase \"decimal dust\". It refers to the small value, when compared to a large value, as being so small it's like dust particles.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"The cost to [add precipitation reporting] is almost decimal dust when it comes to the overall federal budget,\" says Berginnis, whose group wrote to NOAA about the matter. \"We're only talking about $3 million to $5 million a year to produce these data.\" NPR, An unexpected item is blocking cities' climate change prep\n\nAnd,\n\n\"Before you dismiss four-tenths of one percent as decimal dust, consider this: Although student loans make up only 10% of all consumer debt, the amount of seriously past due student loan payments total nearly one-third of all seriously past-due debt payments.\" USA Today, Student loan debt: America's next big crisis\n\nThis idiom may be seen more frequently to refer to budgets of large organizations and governments, but use it and have heard it used to refer to family and individual budgets as well.\n\nA related idiom (although one that doesn't use the word \"change\", and isn't strictly related to money) is a drop in the bucket, which indicates a small, insignificant amount. It could be used to describe almost any negligible quantity, although it can carry an additional connotation of insufficiency, where the amount is smaller than what you need or want."
