A acts hot and cold, gives mixed signals, and acts in a way that leads B to believe that A and B might get together/hook up/become a couple. Unfortunately, A never intends to commit to B and is playing with B’s feelings for fun or to boost their own ego. But A never tells B this, so B keeps acting sweetly towards A, like a chump who has no awareness of the truth.|sorry to say if someone said that to you but chump mean a foolish person meaning she is playing you as in i played him for his money as in (she or he used you) for something.|yeah is someone says to you she played me like if a friend says that,that means you or whoever was used.Oh nice what grade are you in?",
