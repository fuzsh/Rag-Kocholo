While this is not a new thing, the popularity this show has garnered may bleed into the creative community of Liverpool, resulting in us seeing a lot more of this rough and ready flavour in our industry. what are examples of theatre performed in 'unconventional settings' that you've seen and how was your experience with it? The more we discuss these ideas, the more can be done in ways of making this style of theatre more accessible for the masses! put your opinions in the comments below\n\nYou wanna #protest, good. But don't be a moron and ruin an #opera performance for thousands of people. https://lnkd.in/evHXVrpQ I am sick of idiots who think it is a good idea to attack art with destructive displays, just to get attention. This tactic has zero impact on a very serious issue, undermines effective advocacy, and is all about self-promotion.

Leave art alone. #climatechange\n\nDelve into the magic behind the scenes!

I shall be talking about the challenges and success of working, or attempting to work to the Theatre Green book targets. üåûThis will be a mix of short talks and a Q&A session with myself and fellow pms, designers and backstage folk. #theatre #sustainability #collaboration\n\nA key resource to understand the ongoing challenges to artistic freedom, Freemuse's annual report is such an important read! It covers all regions, but their focus on the impacts of conflict and violence on artists and cultural spaces in #Gaza and #Sudan is harrowing. As always, you can count on Cecilia Noce to give such an important overview on this issue for #LatinAmerica.\n\nThis is how you get tickets to YULDEA by Bangarra Dance Theatre before everyone else: This is how you get tickets to YULDEA by Bangarra Dance Theatre before everyone else.
