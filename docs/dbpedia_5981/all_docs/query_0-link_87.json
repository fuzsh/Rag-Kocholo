        "text": "It didn’t take Jorge Posada long to realize he had to utter two of the toughest words in the English language yesterday – “I’m sorry.”\n\nHe had to do it as soon as possible. He had to do it sincerely. And he has to hope his apology to umpire Greg Kosc is accepted, and that no ill will is harbored against the Yankee catcher or his teammates.\n\nPosada, usually as easygoing and non-combative baseball player as you’ll find, erupted after the Yanks’ 7-3 loss to the Orioles in a sweltering Yankee Stadium on Sunday.\n\nHe crossed the line by ripping into Kosc, the plate ump who had called Posada out on strikes in the sixth and then had to leave the game in the seventh suffering from heat exhaustion.\n\nPosada blasted Kosc for being out of shape and enlarging his strike zone. When Posada read his comments in yesterday’s Post, he knew he had to issue an apology.\n\n“When you’re mad you say a lot of things you shouldn’t say,” said Posada, who did not play in the Yankees’ 9-1 loss to the Orioles last night. “I was obviously mad because of the game. It was hot. I was frustrated. I screamed at him. I never scream at people. I was very edgy and I took it out the wrong way.”\n\nPosada wasn’t able to apologize to Kosc in person yesterday. Crew chief Larry Barnett said that Kosc was told to return home and see his personal physician. So Posada made his apology to Barnett and the remainder of the crew, which includes Dan Morrison and Ed Hickox.\n\n“It’s over,” said Barnett. “It’s over. It’s done with. I can think of 10,000 smart things to say but why keep it going? It was an unfortunate situation. It’s over. It’s forgotten about. It’s done. End of story.”\n\nThe Yanks can only hope that’s the case.\n\nPosada’s words were strong, and the umpiring fraternity is a close one. Surely umps around the country are aware of Posada’s angry outburst.\n\n“The bottom line is the guys are not in shape,” he said. “I know it was hot but you’ve got to be able to get through the game. They’re not prepared. They’re not in shape. He gets hot, the [strike] zone gets bigger. One can’t go with the other.”\n\nWill Posada’s words haunt the Yankees? Well, when Joe Torre was asked if he winced after learning about Posada’s comments, he didn’t hesitate.\n\n“Yes,” said Torre, a former catcher.\n\nTorre then was asked if he worries about getting calls.\n\n“You never know,” said Torre. “It was unfortunate and, as you mentioned, Jorge was sorry he did it. You can’t change it. You can just go on and apologize and acknowledge the fact that you’re human.”\n\nPosada stuck to his guns on one count yesterday. He still contends the pitch on which Kosc called him out was a ball. Posada said he knew what Kosc was going through when the heat and humidity turned the stadium into a giant sauna.\n\n“The whole day I was taking care of him, I brought him water and everything,” said Posada.\n\nPosada said he doesn’t expect to hear from the American League or be fined for his outburst, nor should he. Worse things have been said in the heat of a game. But that doesn’t mean the AL turned a deaf ear to the situation. When Yank GM Brian Cashman was asked if he had heard from the league, he hedged.\n\n“Mmm, no comment,” said Cashman.\n\nTranslation: The league probably called Cashman and told him it would be a good idea to have a word with his catcher and encourage him to apologize to Kosc.\n\n“He beat me to the punch,” Cashman said of Posada. “He woke up this morning and obviously realized when he got to the park he had to take responsibility.”"
