        "text": "It’s long been a source of frustration for Laurel and Hardy fans: Most of the greatest comedy team’s films readily available on DVD have come from the tail end of their careers in the 1940s and early 1950s, when the aging comedians had little or no control and few opportunities to shine in formulaic comedies. For this reason, today’s arrival of “The Essential Laurel and Hardy” — which finally collects all 40 of their English-language talkie shorts and 10 of the 13 features they made while under contract to Hal Roach studios, where they collaborated with sympathetic writers and director on all of their finest work — is one of the year’s most eagerly-awaited DVD collections.\n\nLaurel and Hardy were a well-established comedy team, and a top international draw, by the time their first talkie short, the playfully titled “Unaccustomed as We Are,” was released in May 1929. They made the transition more easily than any other silent comedies, partly because their voices — Laurel’s high-pitched English accent and Hardy’s soft Southern drawl — perfectly fit their screen personas. There isn’t lot of talk in their early sound shorts, which don’t date like many early talkies because of this and remarkably fluid camerawork. Many of these early shorts now exist only in reissue versions with an added music track, but the charming “Men of War” and “Perfect Day,” both from 1929, can be watched with the original soundtracks (as well as a 1937 reissue track for the latter).\n\nFollowing the practice of Roach’s distributor, MGM, and other studios, some of the early shorts were filmed in foreign-language versions before the less-expensive practices of dubbing and subtitles came into use. Not only did Stan and Ollie record their own dialogue in French, Spanish and German (reading some of it phonetically from off-camera blackboards), but the shorts were often lengthened. “Ladrones,” the Spanish version of “Ladrones” is 36 minutes long, 16 minutes longer than the U.S. version with new gags and a different ending. Soon Roach sought feature bookings in foreign markets by combining elements from two shorts into short features — the 49-minute “Noche de Duendes” is a cross between “The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case” (1930), the team’s most successful short, and 1929’s “Berth Marks.”\n\nDifferent supporting cast members were brought in for “Les Carottiers,” a very funny 1931 French-language mashup of “Be Big!” and “Laughing Gravy.” The team finally entered the domestic feature market that same year with “Pardon Us” (1931), a spoof of MGM’s “The Big House” and continued to make one or two features a year until their last short, “Thicker Than Water,” was released in 1935. Many aficinados believe that Laurel and Hardy did their best work in two-reel shorts, where their comic bits were very finely honed. The spectacular, Oscar-winning exception is one of several three-reelers in the set — “The Music Box” (1932). Arguably, this is Laurel and Hardy at their classic hilarious best, struggling to carry a piano up a set of very steep steps in a remake of their lost silent short, “Hats Off.”\n\nBoth of their best-loved features are included in “The Essential Laurel and Hardy.” I’d give the edge to William A. Seiter’s “Sons of the Desert” (1933), wherein the boys sneak off to a fraternal convention in Chicago –only to be caught in the lie by Laurel’s wife, unforgettably played by Mae Busch (who alternates in this role in the shorts with Anita Garvin). Their other unassailably classic feature is “Way Out West” (1937), directed by frequent shorts helmer James W. Horne. Stan Laurel identified this charmer as his favorite work. Both feature commentary tracks — two for “Sons of the Desert,” one with Tim Conway and Chuck McCann.\n\nBy this point, Roach was concentrating on features that became more and more elaborate. “Blockheads” (1938), the team’s last film distributed by MGM. is said to have cost more money than two of their previous features and two shorts combined. Roach let Laurel and Hardy’s contracts expire after he parted ways with MGM for distribution through United Artists, but brought L & H back for two 1940 features — Alf Goulding’s “A Chump at Oxford” (presented in a 42-minute version that was shelved until 1942, as well as the 63-minute original theatrical release that’s substantially different) and their very snappy Roach finale, Gordon Douglas’ “Saps at Sea.”\n\nBesides nine full discs of shorts and features — looking far better than I’ve ever seen before — there’s a 10th disc of bonus material. This includes a trio of two-reelers in which Laurel and Hardy make guest appearances in concurrent Roach series featuring Our Gang, Thelma Todd (their doomed leading lady in the 1936 operetta “The Bohemian Girl”) and Zazu Pitts, and their sometimes director Charley Chase. There are also newly-filmed tributes by Jerry Lewis and Dick Van Dyke, as well as an interactive map of locations used in the shorts.\n\nA true labor of love, “The Essential Laurel and Hardy” is packaged in a handsomely illustrated album with excellent liner notes by Laurel and Hardy expert Richard Bann. This treasure trove carries a very reasonable $66 pricetag at Amazon.\n\nA note about the other L & H features produced by Roach that are not in the set. “Babes in Toyland” (1934) is available on DVD from various distributors under its re-release title “The March of the Wooden Soldiers.” I’d recommend the one from MGM’s, which — like everything in “The Ultimate Laurel and Hardy” — restores the original credits and MGM logo.\n\nTwo other Roaches, “The Devil’s Brother” (1933) and “Bonnie Scotland” (1935) are available as part of Warner Home Video’s “TCM Archives: The Laurel and Hardy Collection” (2006), which also includes L & H’s guest appearances in non-Roach features as well as a feature-length documentary on theatrical shorts based on Leonard Maltin’s book. A steal at $15 on Amazon.\n\nLaurel and Hardy were a huge influence on other comedy teams, including some that were animated. Perhaps their principal spirtual heirs at MGM were Tom and Jerry, the perpetually frustrated cat and his perennial mouse prey, who made their first appearance under other names in “Puss Gets The Boot” (1940). This surprise hit changed the fortunes of Metro’s cartoon operation, which had long been struggling to find an identity — there were a lot of cloying Disney imitations — and lost a bundle on its “Captain and the Kids” cartoons.\n\n“Puss Gets the Boot” was the first cartoon created by the team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who weren’t even credited at first. The hugely successful series that resulted ran until MGM shut down its cartoon studio in 1956 (H & B became TV legends) and collected seven Academy Awards — ending Walt Disney’s awards dominance in the field of animated shorts. As the included booklet says, the Tom and Jerrys “were considered the fastest, funniest and, above all, classiest Hollywood cartoons during the golden age of animation.” It’s hard to argue with that.\n\n“Tom and Jerry: Golden Collection Volume 1,” Warner Home Video’s first classic cartoon set in the Blu-ray format, collects Tom and Jerry’s first 37 Technicolor shorts in chronological order, ending with 1948’s “Professor Tom.” The bright, sharp and richly colored high-definition transfers include the Oscar-winning “The Yankee Doodle Mouse,” “Mouse Trouble,” “Quiet Please!” and “The Cat Concerto” plus the Oscar-nominated “The Night Before Christmas” and “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse.”\n\nFive of the animated shorts have commentary tracks with experts like Jerry Beck — the wonderful “The Night Before Christmas,” which introduced the idea that Tom had conflicted feelings about Jerry, has two of them.\n\nA must for fans of classic animation, “Tom and Jerry: Golden Collection Vol. 1” includes a new featurette on Tom and Jerry’s slapstick roots as well as two standard-definition featurettes carried over from earlier DVD releases — plus their appearance in the feature-length musical “Anchors Aweigh” (1945).\n\nToday the Warner Archive Collection rescues Richard Brooks’ “The Last Time I Saw Paris” (1954) — adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short story “Babylon Revisited,” updated to post World War II Paris, with Elizabeth Taylor and Van Johnson — from decades in public-domain hell. Taylor also stars in two other new manufacture-on-demand DVD releases: Brian Hutton’s “Night Watch” (1973), her only horror film, with Laurence Harvey; and, as a teenager, supports Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in Jack Conway’s comedy “Julia Misbehaves” (1948). Also out today is Bud Yorkin’s Mel Brooks-like genre spoof “Start the Revolution Without Me” (1970) starring Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland and narrated by Orson Welles.\n\nWAC is taking pre-orders for a raft of musicals releasing on Nov. 1, including the notorious “Hollywood Party” (1934) starring Jimmy Durante and Lupe Velez, with guest appearances by Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, and Robert Young among others. The Stooges also appear in the DVD debut of the elusive Monogram musical “Swing Parade of 1946” as well as “The Lost Stooges,” a made-for-TV 1990 documentary written, produced and narrated by Leonard Maltin that includes several of their MGM shorts as well as excepts from their MGM features.\n\nOther musicals coming Nov. 1 in one of WAC’s largest wave of pre-orders to date include “The Affairs of Dobie Gillis” with Debbie Reynolds, Bobby Van and Bob Fosse; Stanley Donen’s “Give a Girl a Break” with Marge and Gower Champion and Reynolds; Eleanor Powell in “Ship Ahoy” (with Red Skelton and Frank Sinatra) and “Honolulu” (with Burns and Allen) — as well as the Esther Williams vehicles “Duchess of Idaho” (with Powell’s final screen appearance), “Texas Carnival” and “Skirts Ahoy!”\n\nWAC is also taking pre-orders for three of Buster Keaton’s early ’30s MGM talkies on Nov. 8: “Doughboys,” “What! No Beer!” with Durante and “Sidewalks of New York.”"
