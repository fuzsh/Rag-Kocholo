        "text": "###Some 680,000 Brits share the U.S. with their American cousins. They all speak English, but do y’all understand each other?\n\nAmericans and Brits share a lot of commonalities: a love of spectator sports, hard work ethic and, oh yeah, the English language. Yet many Brits will find themselves scratching their heads at various American idioms and expressions. Here’s a quick guide to three of the most common.\n\nClutch\n\nWhile you might be quick to assume that 'clutch' refers to a women’s hand bag, all sports fans in the U.S. know that clutch means getting \"exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.”\n\nThere were only 2 seconds left in the game when he hit that jump shot. LeBron James is so clutch.\n\n####Shooting the breeze\n\nAn American might proclaim that they’re spending a lazy weekend with friends, “just shooting the breeze.”\n\nThey most likely haven’t brought out rifles at a windy shooting range, but are rather engaging in idle chatter. The saying did, however, originate from the Wild West when cowboys with extra time on their hands would fire into the sky.\n\n####Chump change\n\n'Chump change' refers to a small or insignificant amount of money that you aren’t concerned about.\n\nThe term first popped up in the mid 20th century and is widely used across America.\n\nIf you're moving money to and from the UK, don't get stung by a bad exchange rate. Sign up with Wise today and save time and money.\n\nSave up to 8x when sending money overseas. Unlike banks, with Wise you don't pay a markup in the exchange rate when your money is converted into another currency. And you'll save even more by avoiding the international Swift fees and the intermediary banks, when you send and receive money abroad.\n\nCheck here how much you'd save with Wise.\n\nIt's cheap, fast, and you know exactly how much you pay and how much reaches the destination. With no unpleasant surprises."
