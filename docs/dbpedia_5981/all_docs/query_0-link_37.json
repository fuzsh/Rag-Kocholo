These Americans are greeted by tourist trade workers who assume that they speak better English than the \"language-impaired American\" speaks French. I have never found anyone selling baguettes on St. Barth who wasn't fluent in English, and very anxious to use it, with Americans.\n\nJimB said:\n\nI agree with Cassidain, when he says, \"What bothers me is having to insist to service personnel that we converse en français rather than en anglais.\" This is my main irritant about St. Barth.
