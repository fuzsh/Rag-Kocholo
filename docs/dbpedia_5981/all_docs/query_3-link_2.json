        "text": "Violence & Scariness\n\nsome\n\nThe ducks are often on the run from predators, some animal, some human; they dodge fire, vehicles, people, etc. The frequent peril creates scares that are generally mild and comical, although some visuals can be intense, especially on a big screen. A mean chef is relentless in pursuing the ducks, wielding a knife and eager to capture them to use as ingredients. Family members are separated from each other, with some trapped and in danger. A bird's wings are hurt, making flight difficult. Herons are portrayed as scary -- in a story, they squish ducklings, and one who takes the family in seems very creepy/predatory, even holding a knife. A bird is smacked by a bus and a scooter; characters are hit with a shovel. A caged bird is sad and lonely, far from home. A duck bites a human on the nose. Arguing.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nPositive Role Models\n\na lot\n\nMother bird Pam leans into adventure and is a loving and supportive wife and mother. Father bird Mack is cautious and overprotective, but that comes from the love he has for his family, and he learns to be more open to change and new experiences. Son Dax is brave and shows leadership during a family crisis. When one group of birds meets another group of birds, it might initially seem worrisome, but they look out for and protect each other.\n\nParents need to know that Migration is a charming animated adventure that follows a family of four ducks, led by parents Mack (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani) and Pam (Elizabeth Banks) Mallard, as they set out on a migration adventure. Mack is an overprotective parent, terrified of something happening to his ducklings in a world full of predators. He's not wrong: Larger birds and knife-wielding chefs do see the ducks as dinner, and they're frequently trying to escape. But the peril is always balanced with comedy, and the ultimate message is that fully experiencing life is worth taking some risks. One notably creepy sequence involving a heron is shot like a horror movie, and little kids will likely feel the tension even more when the movie is viewed on the big screen. Still, the Mallards get through it, and so will most kids. Language is limited to insults like \"chump,\" \"psycho killer,\" \"stupid,\" and \"trashy vermin,\" and the phrase \"bustin' your bills\" is used. (Note: In theaters, the Minions short \"Mooned\" screens ahead of Migration. It contains comic peril, a Minion who drinks a martini, and a short-fused, silly villain who uses the words \"stupid,\" \"dork,\" and \"poop.\") To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails."
