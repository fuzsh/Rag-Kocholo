        "text": "In 2001, Darren LaCroix, The World Champion of Public Speaking, outspoke 25,000 contestants from 14 countries to win that title. Since that victory, Darren has traveled the world demystifying the process of creating a powerful speech. He has roused audiences in faraway places like Oman, Malaysia, and Taiwan with his inspirational journey from first-rate chump to first-class champ, proving anything is possible if you are willing to work for it.\n\nDarren may have been \"born without a funny bone in my body,\" but he possessed the desire to learn and the willingness to fail necessary to achieve his dream. The self-proclaimed \"student of comedy\" is living proof that humor is a skill that can be learned.\n\nDarren interviewed CEOs and business owners who made humor part of their business plan, culling from their successful practices innovative principles that could be applied to any company. He developed an innovative technique of \"customizing\" humor that reveals the common frustrations and pet peeves about an organization, giving him ammunition that has audiences laughing down to their toes.\n\nFrom the Boston Globe to Northwest Flight Magazine to the LA Times, Darren LaCroix has been interviewed and quoted. Classic terms like Funsuckers - people in organizations that suck the fun out of everything- are quickly becoming part of pop corporate culture. \"He's revolutionized the way we hold meetings,\" a client told Business Today.com.\n\nHis successful book, Laugh & Get Rich: How to Profit from Humor in Any Business, contains interviews with corporate executives who share his philosophy. Now translated into three languages, it is a mainstay on business bookshelves.\n\nAs co-founder of The Humor Institute and a co-creator of The Humor Boot Camp, Darren directs seminars that help presenters wisely use the power of humor to \"lighten up\" their presentations.\n\nAn award-winning producer, his film Living and Laughing with Cancer: A Comedian's Journey was honored at the Worldfest Houston film festival for its groundbreaking insights into humor and healing. The inspirational documentary about his best friend's battle with cancer, brings humor and hope to those touched by life-threatening conditions.\n\nDarren's unique brand of humor is featured in numerous corporate training videos. His extensive list of clients include Fidelity Investments, Sheraton Hotels, IBM, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Dunkin' Donuts, Motorola, EMC2 Corporation, CVS, and ERA Key Realty Services.\n\nTitles\n\nOUCH! How I Went From Chump to Champ\n\nChange or Die (Enough said)\n\nLaugh & Get RICH: How to Profit from Humor in Any Business"
