        "text": "Major Player\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2003\n\nLocation: Miller Place, NY\n\nPosts: 820\n\nOoh, sneaking a peek at the films before the official announcement tomorrow? Tisk, tisk. And thank you, 'cause now I'm all excited.\n\nTruth be told, the reason I have ready access to my parents as help for these movies is because I still live with them. Rent's ridiculous these days, I can't afford to live on my own.\n\nYeah, that's it.\n\nAnyway, as such, I'm limited in terms of space, and the 'wall' you see is a king size bedsheet stapled to the drywall ceiling of my bedroom. Folded it in on one end to create the illusion of a corner, since the room's walls are bright red, the place is a mess, and I have no real place to go with all this crap.\n\nThe house, as dearest mother is--understandably--quick to point out, is also not in the most organized condition. My dad's a bit of a junk collector (a trait I've inherited), and between the three of us, every room in this house is stuffed full of crap. The garage is traversable, if you're a mountain climber, and the basement (with its seven foot ceiling height) is the kind of thing you'd find underneath an abandoned house in the ruins of an ancient city. It was an effort to clean up my room (enough) to arrange all the props and equipment, so I did the best with what I have.\n\nI'm with you on the desire for other angles, but in the past I've neglected to shoot basic coverage of my scenes, and wanted to get myself set with that before moving on to more complicated setups. Grabbed a master from the dolly's resting position, two medium close ups for my face and the coins, then got some inserts. Getting the simple things down, and just generally going through the motions of 'production', if you can call it that, is important to me. If I don't do this kind of thing over and over and over, I never learn.\n\nThank you very much for the compliment, and look forward to some production stills sometime tomorrow. Grabbed one or two while everything was in place, they might give you a better idea of what I'm dealing with.\n\nMajor Player\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2003\n\nLocation: Miller Place, NY\n\nPosts: 820\n\nCome now, Lorinda, I do happen to hold the opinion that one learns more from negative comments (rather, comments about negative aspects of a film, not comments that themselves are negative in tone), but I appreciate the positive ones just fine. They put a big ol' smile on my face, and make me feel good. Who doesn't appreciate that? Particularly the \"great music\" bit; that's just me noodling around with Acid. The Sony software, not the drug. I just used some of the loops that came with it. The Horncraft, Discrete Drums II, and Sweet & Low Bass promo packages work fairly well together, it seems, and the result is what you hear. The Tascam control surface I got helped immensely, just being able to easily shuttle, play, stop, and fast forward/rewind, and though it's overkill, it's the least expensive thing I could find with motorized faders. I wanted motorized faders, I paid for 'em. Worth every penny! The MIDI keyboard saw no use for this project, but I still wanted to learn the piano, so it's not at all a loss.\n\nAttached, please find some stills of the 'set'. It's still here, as a matter of fact, and the room that I cleaned up to shoot this is still a mess. Gotta love the vicious cycle of independent films, huh? The first two show the relationship between all my movie stuff and the rest of the room (the second one's kind of redundant, but you get to see what we did to the ceiling), and the third is the dolly my dad and I built as it was arranged when shooting. Excuse the flash; the lighting does look strange with it, but I don't know how to make this point and shoot Kodak do what I want it to in low light. Every shot I got without the flash is unusable.\n\nI did the little ring of coins on the table, according to instructions found in that link I posted up above; the first photo on the second page is more or less what I did, but with quarters instead of pennies. I had to rebuild it on Sunday, after knocking it over during the last shot, so I could get some pick ups (see how professionally I use industry lingo?). I did three or four rehearsals without actually dropping the book on Saturday night, then I went for it, it worked great, everything was fine. Until the next day, when I needed two shots to make the whole movie make some kind of sense. The first closeup, where you see the penny in the center, and the close up on the book jacket you see later, were shot after the fact. I'd left everything in place overnight, just in case, and sure enough, I needed it. This time it was inserts instead of reshoots, though, so I'm improving. Honestly, that little thing only took about ten minutes to throw together, and I didn't screw up too many times. Made one stack of eleven quarters when the rest were ten, and had to knock part of it over to fix that, but it was a small price to pay for a movie that makes sense, you know?\n\nYou also see, in that third photo, the 'bracket' we designed for my 35mm adapter. After adjusting the length to be optimal for my camera, the adapter is so long it would put a whole lot of stress on the threads. A piece of flat aluminum we had left over from a job we did a few months back (took a break from plumbing for a while to help a friend by cleaning out scrap metal from the old Sunnydale plant in Brooklyn) did the trick. Got a number seven drill bit, a quarter-twenty tap, and made a little mount for my camera. Another underneath takes the Beachtek, which itself takes the tripod's quick release plate. Concern was expressed on my dad's part about aluminum's ability to hold these threads under the strain of constantly connecting and disconnecting my accessories, but we didn't have a choice in this time frame, so there it is. A chunk of Styrofoam (that I never cut to width) supports the adapter just under the lens mount, and does a wonderful job of taking the weight off of my filter threads.\n\nThen there's the dolly. Took the better part of my ten day limit, but I wanted a dolly move, and that's how I did it. After reading about roller blade wheels in \"Killer Camera Rigs\" and then seeing them in action on the set of \"Two Guys\", I was convinced they were the way to go, and we stopped at a local sporting goods place on the way back from work last week. Should have gotten the salesman's name for inclusion in the credits, but it slipped my mind. If you're ever in Rocky Point, New York, here on Long Island, and need sporting goods, stop by Plaza Sports on 25A. In the same shopping center as the Capital One bank. There, I feel better.\n\nWith that out of the way, my dad designed and built (I'm not as good with this kind of thing as he is; I can use a die grinder, but not very well) the triangular base you see for my tripod out of some spare angle iron--there's a special name for the kind we used, he couldn't remember it--then added the rails to hold the wheels. We tried a few different arrangements for the axles, ultimately going with something akin to what's found in KCR, and they worked best. Dropped some ten foot lengths of 3/4\" copper into matching ten foot lengths of 3/4\" Kindoff (Kindorf? I hear people say the name all the time, I just can't figure out if it's just a New York accent that drops the R, or if it's not actually there), and there we go! Stops the pipe from rolling, has holes for mounting to whatever you want, and the best part, if you stagger the joints, you don't need anything at all to join two or more lengths of track. Haven't tried it yet, but they should just butt up against one another.\n\nAs for operating it, Pops says--good naturedly--that there was a lot of pressure to get it right, and he didn't want to screw up. A man of few words for a change. Usually he never shuts up. If you ever meet him, don't look to start a conversation. Me, well, I don't speak much, but I type like a madman. I'd run a great conspiracy theory website, wouldn't I?"
