        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n13 Jul 2024, 12:08\n\nCredit: Rex / Getty\n\nIt seems the Grand Tour trio, made up of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, are reportedly going their separate ways - in the telly business at least.\n\nThe MailOnline has revealed that all three Top Gear stars have “signed off on the dissolution of their company, W. Chump and Sons, which made the shows.”\n\nAs part of the dissolution, Hammond, Clarkson and May have declared solvency and appointed a liquidator to “wind up” the business. According to the publication, the most recently filed accounts showed an annual turnover of £6 million and assets of £3.8 million.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reveal if Deadpool and Wolverine are Wrexham fans\n\nStrictly Come Dancing pro Graziano Di Prima confirms he's been axed from upcoming series - read his full statement here\n\nWho is the new guide dog in the House of Commons? All the details on the new pup in Parliament\n\n------------------------------------\n\nVirginradio.co.uk has reached out to representatives for Clarkson, Hammond and May for comment.\n\nThe future of The Grand Tour had been in question following reports that Amazon Prime Video had “parted ways” with Clarkson in 2023 following comments he made about Meghan Markle in The Sun.\n\nNot only that, but during the latest Grand Tour special, Sand Job, all three TV presenters hinted they would be calling time on the travel series soon, and that their next outing, already being filmed in Zimbabwe, might be their last project together.\n\nCo-star Hammond appeared to reveal that Sand Job would be the penultimate special, telling The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with webuyanycar earlier this year: “We've sort of confirmed that it kind of probably is.”\n\nOn there seemingly being only one more Grand Tour to follow, Richard explained in February: “Above all else, we wanted to land this thing at a time, in a place, and in a manner of our choosing. That was absolutely key to us. And we realised that, I don't know, 15 years ago when it first got carried away and became big. Because we didn't take off on purpose, this just happened.\n\n“We set out to make a car show and it grew into something we didn't expect. So when the time comes to stop, we want to be the ones to say ‘stop’. Rather than any one of us, for instance, getting us massively fired. Or one of us die in a crash, or any other way of ending.”\n\nHammond and Clarkson originally joined forces for Top Gear in 2002, with May joining in series two. It became a smash-hit for the BBC, but in 2015 the partnership came to an end and the stars moved to Prime Video for The Grand Tour, and was yet another success for the streamer.\n\nClarkson has since had a major hit with his Clarkson’s Farm series, also on Prime Video, and recently purchased a pub to help expand his ever-growing Diddly Squat empire."
