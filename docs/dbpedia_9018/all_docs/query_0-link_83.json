Trieste and the surrounding region became a political football in the nascent cold war after its joint occupation by New Zealand and Yugoslav forces in 1945. A free territory was established to defuse any potential clash with Yugoslavia, but the establishment of a civil administration was blocked by the USSR. Therefore Zone A (which included the city) stayed under Anglo-American military control, while Zone B, to the South, was governed by Yugoslavia. The latter's split with the USSR eventually led to a peaceful resolution in which Zone A became Italian and Zone B Yugoslavian. This was not finally ratified until 1975 however.\n\nHistory note\n\nThis flag was the last one flown in the city of Trieste, within Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste, before the area was handed to the Italian State in 1954.\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nEquipment\n\nRelated period\n\nSecond World War (production), 1945-1989 (association)\n\nMaterials\n\nwhole: cloth\n\nDimensions\n\nwhole: Length 275 cm, Width 169 cm\n\nCatalogue number\n\nFLA 572\n\nObject associations\n\nAssociated places\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
