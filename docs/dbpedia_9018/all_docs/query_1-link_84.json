The flag of Trieste as well as the flag of the former Free Territory of Trieste, are plain red with the top of a lance in white.The proportions I found are 7:10, but there could be other.\n\nPascal Vagnat, 22 September 1998\n\nThe exact name for the lance is \"halberd\" (in Italian \"alabarda\"), like the lance used by the Vatican Swiss Guard.\n\nPaolo Zaccaria, 16 June 2000\n\nAccording to my handy encyclopedia, the pole-arm whose head appears on these Trieste flags is called a ranseur. A halberd has an ax-head in place of one of the hooks\n\nJohn Ayer, 5 October 2000\n\nAlthough technically the Trieste's coat of arm should be named ranseur rather than helberd, everybody in Trieste name it \"alabarda\", i.e. helberd.\n\nPaolo Zaccaria, 7 April 2005\n\nCity Gonfalone\n\nimage from <www.retecivica.trieste.it>, located by Jarig Bakker , 27 February 2000\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nimage by Alex Belfi, 29 September 2000\n\nThis is the coat of arms of Trieste, but it represented the whole Trieste territory, which is the small region of which Trieste is part, giving its name to it; so, i disagree with Pascal Vagnat (on your site), who says that Trieste isn't a region but a town, because actually it's both of them. This coat of arms was the official coat of arms of the Free Territory of Trieste as mentioned in the consitution of the FTT. It was mainly used in Zone A. This coat of arms in not used officially today; but it is commonly used as general identification for this territory, and politically by independentists (i.e. people who want to bring back the FTT).\n\nAlex Belfi, 29 September 2000\n\nAssociazione per Trieste - Autonomy Movement\n\nimage by Ivan Sache\n\n\" Trieste (Associazione per Trieste autonomy movement) - North-East Italy.\" - Red field with a white spearhead.\n\nThis flag is listed under number 48 at the chart \"Flags of Aspirant Peoples\" [eba94].\n\nIvan Sache\n\nHistorical Flags and Coat of Arms\n\n1464\n\nimage by Paolo Zaccaria, 16 June 2000\n\nFrom 1382 to 1918 Trieste was Austrian, so the previous flag was a golden halberd on an Austrian flag (red/white/red horizontal stripes).\n\nThe coat of arms of the town was similar and was confered by the emperor Friedrich III of Habsburg in 1464. Here is a scan of a more recent copy of the conferal document, dated 1691 and conserved in the Trieste's library.\n\nPaolo Zaccaria, 16 June 2000\n\n1933\n\nimage by Alex Belfi, 29 September 2000\n\nThis coat of arms was used before World War II and most of the times (and officially after 1933), it featured fasces.\n\nAlex Belfi, 29 September 2000\n\nStr�hl [stl04] describes the historical arms of Trieste:\n\nPer fess: in chief Or, the imperial eagle Sable; in base Gules, a fess Argent, overall an halberd Argent (see image).\n\nGranted 22 February 1464 by Emperor Frederick III, reconfirmed 26 February 1852 by Emperor Francis Joseph I.\n\nSo Strohl takes the \"historical\" arms and therefore also the \"traditional\" flag to be of post-1918 origin, i.e. had been introduced under Italian rule. Of course the Italians were eager to remove the Austrian and imperial emblems in the arms.\n\nM. Schm�ger, 9 August 2010"
