        "text": "\"These two lectures will illustrate some important issues of contemporary European history, through the Trieste ‘case study’. The peculiar history of the city and its geopolitical location allow to analyze the transition processes occurring in Europe between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Trieste is a sort of small laboratory where it is in fact possible to find, on a local scale, the events that affected an entire continent. Supranational empires. The city belongs to the Austrian Empire from the fourteenth century and flourishes in the nineteenth century as the Empire only seaport, becoming a busy “emporium” in the northern Mediterranean. National rivalries. The end of the nineteenth century century marks the beginning of tension between Italians and Slavs: the Italians are the majority in the city and hold the political power, the Slavs are numerically dominant in the rural hinterland around Trieste. Irredentism. Trieste becomes a symbol in Italy: part of the public opinion firmly believes that the conquest of the city would have concluded the unfinished unification of the Italian State. War. The primary Italian objective in World War I against Austria is the conquest of the Italian-speaking territories, still administered by the Empire. Several citizens from Trieste refuse to fight for the Empire: they desert and recruit volunteers in the Italian army. Collapse of empires. The outcome of the war leads to the fall of great empires and to the emergence of new nation states, based on self-determination. New Boundaries. Trieste passes from Austria to Italy. It is the decline of the so-called “Mitteleuropa”. Trieste becomes a city on the border of the Italian State. Nationalism. After the war, the Italian government suppresses in several ways the rights of the Slav population living in the border areas of the new state. Peaceful co-existence is a memory of the past. Totalitarianism. A few years after the war, the fragile Italian democracy is replaced by fascism. The regime has particularly harsh traits on the eastern border. Political violence. In 1943 the city is occupied by the Nazis. The Germans build a concentration camp with a crematorium: Jews are imprisoned and taken to Germany; the captured partisans are killed in so-called “Risiera di San Sabba”. In 1945, the Nazis withdraw and the city is occupied by the Yugoslav army. The new communist Yugoslavia, allied with USA, UK and USSR, wants to annex Trieste. Several thousand people are killed or deported from Trieste as fascists or simply anticommunist. Return to democracy and reconstruction. After two decades of dictatorship and the lost World War II, Italy loses Trieste for ten years. The city is governed until 1954 by Anglo-Americans. A slow reconstruction begins: material, political and civil. Cold War. Trieste is located a few kilometers from the “Iron Curtain”. The city borders the Communist Yugoslavia and becomes one of the several places of the Cold War. Population displacement. About 300 thousand Italians, resident in the hinterland of Trieste (transferred to Yugoslavia after the peace treaty), leave their homes and shelter in Italy. It’s the so-called Exodus. European integration. Trieste returns Italian in 1954, ten years after the end of the war. The tension on the border, however, lasts up to very recent times. The main problem is the never appeased mistrust between Italians and Slavs. Only recently, the opportunities offered by the European Community and the fall of the last borders prefigure a new era of mutual understanding, coexistence and cooperation.\"\n\nDuring the years that followed the end of the Great War, the Adriatic area found itself in a period of deep economic crisis due to the emptiness caused by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The ancient Habsburg harbours, which ha recently turned Italian, had lost their natural positions of Mitteleuropean economic outlets toward the Mediterranean due to the new political order of Central-Eastern Europe. Rome, then, attempted a series of economic manoeuvres aimed at improving Italian trade in the Julian harbours, first of all the port of Trieste, and at encouraging Italian entrepreneurial penetration in the Balkans. Resolved in a failure, the desire for commercial boost toward the oriental Adriatic shore coincided with the Dalmatian Irredentism and became a topic for claiming the 1941 military intervention across the Balkan peninsula. Italian geopoliticians, who had just developed the geopolitical discipline in Italy, made the Adriatic-Balkan area one of their most discussed topics. The fascist geopolitical project aimed at creating an economic aisle between the Adriatic and the Black Sea, in order to bypass the Turkish straits and become completion and outlet toward the Mediterranean of the Nazi Baltic-Mitteleuropean space in the north. Rome attempted the agreement with the other Danubian States, which subscribed the Tripartite Pact, in order to create a kind of economic cooperation area under the Italian lead. Therefore, the eastern Italian geopolitical border would have been traced farther from national limes. Rome would have projected his own interests as far as the Danubian right riverside, sharing with Berlin the southern part of that area consisting of territories historically comprehended (and contented) between German and Russian spheres of interest, which the Reich intended to reorganise after the alleged Soviet Union defeat. These Countries, framed by the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black See shores, found themselves entangled once more by geopolitical ties enforced by the interests of foreign Countries. However, these projects remained restricted to paper: the invasion of Yugoslavia turned into a failure and exposed Italy's military weakness; Rome proved to have no authority about the New Order organisation. Italy could dream up about its power only among magazines pages.\n\nIn the fall of 1945, Allied Headquarters in Trieste drafted and circulated a report recounting the experiences of Italian soldiers and civilians living under Yugoslavian occupation (1943-1945). In Trieste, one of the largest cities in the province of what is now Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Yugoslavian occupation, known as the “Forty Days,” lasted just over a month from 1 May to 12 June 1945 — while in the former eastern borderlands of Istria, Dalmatia and Zara, partisan warfare and Yugoslav occupation had progressed sporadically for almost two years following the Italian armistice with Allied forces in September 1943, culminating in the official Yugoslavian annexation of these regions in 1954. This essay will examine the frameworks of understanding and multifaceted geopolitical concerns which impacted both the development of the Allied investigation and subsequent responses to the report’s findings —namely, the silencing of public discussion of these events in an effort to secure postwar peace in the newly established border region. As will be discussed in this essay, the investigation and eventual “submersion”1 of these atrocities occurred within the context of two important postwar movements—the \"defascistizzazione\" of Italy and the escalation of tensions preceding the Cold War. This essay argues that the Allied investigation was, in fact, a part of the process of “submersion”—pursued in an effort to gain information about the Yugoslavian position, to appease and diminish discussions of these events, and to control narratives in order to protect the Allied position in the region. Although the Allied governments did achieve a favourable solution to the border dispute in 1954, resulting in the Italian administration of Trieste and Venezia Giulia, the “submersion” of these events and limited response to the persecution and expulsion of ethnic Italians in the zones of Yugoslavian occupation were ultimately counterproductive in establishing any long-lasting resolution or effective process of reconciliation between the border region and the Italian state, or amongst the Italian, Slovenian and Croatian communities living within and across the border.\n\nThe first visible Slavonic presence in Trieste dates back to the mid-18th century, when some Illyric families responded to the invitation Maria Theresa had issued to merchants of Greek faith, to settle in the Porto Franco and make the most of both economic and religious privileges. “Illyric” was the name that had come to prevail in the Habsburg administration since the early 18th c. for the Southeastern Slav population of the Greek rite. Within the Greek religious community in Trieste, congregated around the newly-built St. Spyridon church, there were soon enough Greeks and Illyrics who took to competing for hegemony. The Austrian administration settled the dispute in favour of the Illyrics, as was to be expected, given the special loyalty of the Illyric Mitropolija and the Illyric regiments to the crown. At the time, Illyric merchants in Trieste were mostly engaged in high-risk trade, which allowed some of them to quickly amass great fortunes while the less fortunate went under. A fleeting but meaningful chapter of Trieste’s intercourse with the Slavonic world was the repeated appearances of the Russian navy in the port’s waters during the Napoleonic wars. All in all, the main feature of the Illyric community in Trieste was that of a confessional “nation”, well-rooted and visible in the local institutions of mercantile self-government, but at risk of being sidelined because of its limited numbers. The human basis of Trieste’s rapid urban development was a dual immigration flow, from the nearby provinces of Carniola, Gorizia and Istria to the municipality of Trieste, and within the municipality itself, from the suburban districts to the port. Both flows were to feed the phenomenon of the so-called sub-urban Slavism, an expression that has been recently retrieved by historians because of its descriptive efficacy, after having long been used in a demeaning sense. The effects of this dual immigration flow were mostly perceivable in town through the Catholic church’s regulations concerning the “Carniolian” or “Slavic” language that the priest should be able to use for the care of souls in the parish of the New Town. In those days, the Carniolian/Slovenian presence in the town concerned the church alone, because the fate of so-called Slav urbanism was simply to be assimilated into the Italian environment, with no strain involved. After the Napoleonic wars, the town (by then grown to 36,000 inhabitants) was returned to the self-government of the merchant class, led by a recognized Italian-speaking but cosmopolitan élite of Borsa merchants. Some prominent Illyric members of that élite took part in the opening of new sea routes to the Black Sea and in starting that huge insurance and navigation company that was the Austrian Lloyd. The old merchant-adventurer type survived in just a couple of intriguing individuals who both had links to their Illyric nation, to Russia, and to the corn trade with the Black Sea. In the meanwhile, by 1846, the town had grown to 66,000 inhabitants. Were it not for the church of St. Spyridon and the numerous buildings erected by Illyric merchants in the Theresian and Josephin districts, this element of the Slavonic dimension of Trieste would have gradually become invisible. But there was another Slavonic component in the city at the time, much more significant in numerical terms, which is revealed by the fact that from 1830 to 1914 the local church was led by an almost unbroken series of Slovenian bishops – in accordance with the idea that the Austrian government in Vienna had of the Catholic flock in the diocese of the Littoral (including Gorizia and Istria, besides Trieste). In the eighteen-fifties, the matter was still devoid of political implications, but things were changing fast. In 1848, the liberal-moderate Pietro Kandler gave shape to a new way of looking at the language issue. The Austrian census confirmed the Italianity of Trieste as far as the urban population was concerned. The municipality’s external circle, equated with the countryside, was admittedly “Slav”, but the Slav language had never gained the status of a learned language. According to Kandler, then, the city of Trieste had every right to stay true to its language and culture in the offices and schools. Ironically, a “Slav Society” was set up in Trieste in the very same year, and in the decades to come, it developed into a burgeoning network of Slovene associations with a Slavic solidarity leaning. The product of a rising Slovenian middle class, this movement culminated in the founding of a large-scale bank and in the construction of a “National House” in the Theresian district, in the first years of the 20th c. In such rapid progress toward full urban assertion, the Slovenes had to confront the local administration, which had shifted from the old cosmopolitan Italophone group to the new leadership of Italian national-liberals, who were grimly determined, under the banner of autonomism, to prevent the Slav presence within the town perimeter from becoming visible through external signs. The Italian nationalists were gripped by a fear of Slav encerclement and above all, of Slav infiltration in the city. To combat this, they made strenuous efforts to advance monopolistic Italian elementary education in urban districts, particularly in those areas where the Slovenian population was growing apace. In this way, something which for over a century had been a spontaneous process of assimilation, was turning into planned policy. Surprisingly enough, however, at some point between 1900 and 1910, the assimilation mechanism got “jammed”. The population of Trieste had seen impressive growth in the second half of the 19th c., fuelled initially by the arrival of poor or landless peasants from Slovenian Carniola, and then by migrants mainly from Istria and from Italy, attracted to Trieste by job opportunities in the “nuovissimo” port under construction. In the face of the rising Slav/Slovenian presence in the city, Austrian censuses (based on Umgangssprache) recorded a steady decline of Slovenian percentages. Such trend was suddenly and dramatically reversed in the 1910 census, showing that the immigrants were by then making the most of the Slovenian alternative to Italian assimilation."
