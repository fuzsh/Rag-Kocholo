        "text": "Much of the graceful city-center area north of Corso Italia dates to the 18th-century reign of Empress Maria Theresa, including the photogenic Canal Grande. Reflecting centuries of religious tolerance, here you will also find the mosaic-laden 1868 Serbian Orthodox Santo Spiridione church juxtaposed with the neoclassical 1842 Sant’Antonio Taumaturgo’s one, the largest Catholic church in the city. On the Via Roma bridge stands a life-sized statue of James Joyce, and the Piazza Hortis is home to a similar bronze of the Italian iconic writer Italo Svevo.\n\nElisabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria, nicknamed Sissi, was known as one of the most beautiful and famous women of 19th-century Europe. With her husband, Emperor “Kaiser” Frances Joseph, she visited Trieste’s Miramare Castle 14 times. The stunning castle, perched on a rock overlooking the gulf, remained ever-ready for the royals’ brief stops along the way to their favorite destinations in the South Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe autumn season is a lovely time to visit Trieste for what the Guinness World Records calls the world’s “Greatest Sailing Race.” The Barcolana55, officially known as the Barcolana Autumn Cup Regatta, will take place from September 29th to October 8th. Founded in 1969, this is the most romantic and crowded regatta in the world.The famous race initiated by the Yacht Club Società Velica of Barcola and Grignano in Trieste always takes place on the second Sunday of October. In 2019, when the Guinness record was announced, the race had 2,689 boats and over 16,000 sailors on the starting line.The course of the 2023 race will be the same as last year’s edition: a quadrangle with fixed points in the Gulf of Trieste for a total length of 13 nautical miles.\n\nThe regatta is a thrilling sight, but there is so much more happening in Trieste at the time. On October 4th to 6th the international Barcolana Sea Summit will meet to raise awareness on the seas’ health and climate change. Barcolana Week will offer fun for all ages on land and sea.\n\nIrish writer James Joyce lived nearly 16 years in Trieste after first arriving in the Adriatic city in October 1904. This is where he wrote or saw published all of his early works—Chamber Music, Dubliners, Portrait, Exiles, and Giacomo Joyce—and began and wrote significant episodes of Ulysses, a novel that had already begun to change the course of modern literature even before its publication in 1922.\n\nOn December 15, 2018, the dream of the waltz became a historic spectacle when 1,598 couples danced in the Piazza Unità d'Italia, Italy’s largest sea-facing piazza. Recorded as the largest waltz in the world, the event broke the record previously held since 2010 by the city of Tuzla in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had included 1,510 waltzing couples.\n\nA fun little museum found at 9 Via Belpoggio in Trieste tells us about Bora, an honorary citizen of the city. Bora is the impetuous and sudden strong wind that blows on Trieste for several day per year, sometimes reaching an incredible speed of 290 miles per hour. The dramatic natural phenomenon is named after Bora, the young and capricious favorite child of Aeolus, the Greek God of the winds.\n\nAt 229 Viale Miramare you’ll discover one of Trieste's most unusual buildings. Known as the Onion Villa for its Russian-looking onion domes, the mansion was built in 1896 by Anton Jakic, a former priest who is said to have abandoned his vows to become a spy for the Tsar.\n\nThe food and wine in Trieste are unique for their eclectic mix of Austrian, Hungarian, Jewish, Slavic, and Asian influences, especially the use of spices and aromas. Among the typical dishes of the province of Trieste we advise you try are Jota, a soup with beans and sauerkraut; plum and potato gnocchi; bread, egg, and ham gnocchi and pork with sauerkraut.\n\nThe vineyard-draped hinterland of the karst will show you the real magic of Trieste is dishes like goulash, a soup prepared with onion, meat, and chili. Among the typical Tristini desserts are the Sacher Torte, an Austrian must; apple strudel, Putizza, with its sweet filling of dried fruit and potato Kipfels. Trieste’s excellent wines are worth discovering, namely Teran Karst, Karst Cabernet Sauvignon, Malvasia Karst, and Vitovska Karst."
