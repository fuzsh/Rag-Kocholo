        "text": "Because we were discussing Trieste in another thread, I looked up my old Britannica's article on Trieste and it said:\n\n\"The statute of the Free Territory of Trieste was as unworkable as that of the Free City of Danzig. A simple frontier, when agreed between the countries directly interested, was always better than such artificial constructions as free territories, free cities or condominia.\"\n\nDo you agree or not? Consider not only whether the Free City of Danzig might have worked (however imperfectly) if the Nazis had not come to power. Also consider the various other proposals for free cities or free territories (Constantinople, Jerusalem, etc.).\n\nAs far as condominiums are concerned, there are plenty of cases where they've turned out fine. One example is Vanuatu, which was an Anglo-French condominium between 1906 and 1980. I'm not going to say that Vanuatu is perfect or even necessarily especially good, but it's also not particularly bad or worse off than other Oceanic nations that were only colonized by one nation, so far as I know.\n\nCondominiums and similar arrangements are probably best for situations where there is a dispute of some kind which neither nation is especially invested in or interested in changing to their benefit. In such a situation, creating a \"free territory\" or a condominium or the like is essentially a way of neutralizing or eliminating a dispute which neither side is totally willing to give way on (otherwise they would) but which neither one considers so important that they must have a totally favorable outcome, in other words in which the status quo is fine. Thus, ironically they are badly suited for the exact kind of situation where they are most likely to be proposed, since one or more parties to the agreement will be very interested in abnegating it for their own benefit.\n\nAs far as condominiums are concerned, there are plenty of cases where they've turned out fine. One example is Vanuatu, which was an Anglo-French condominium between 1906 and 1980. I'm not going to say that Vanuatu is perfect or even necessarily especially good, but it's also not particularly bad or worse off than other Oceanic nations that were only colonized by one nation, so far as I know.\n\n“Since gaining independence, Vanuatu has established itself as an offshore financial and shipping centre.”\n\nNot a bad way to leverage its island status.\n\nIt all really depends. Does the city have its own national identity? If so, possibly. Anywhere with distinct attachment to a certain country will always eventually integrate back into said country.\n\nTrieste was a free city which resisted Venetian domination (although came to speak a dialect of Venetian) throughout history and remained separate from the rest of the Austrian littoral, so it's a pretty key example of what a free city might do.\n\nTrieste declined as the collapse of the Austrian Empire cut off it's traditional hinterland and WWII made things even worse, but if the city has free trade with its neighbours than it can easily retain it's status. I think it could easily be like San Marino where it remains closely associated with Italy yet never joins them.\n\nIn the modern age, I think Hong Kong and Macau are good examples of free cities who will survive as long as they have the choice. As for an example like Jerusalem, that seems dependent on how the rest of Palestine is treated (by 1945 it's probably too late for an International City of Jerusalem to work), while Constantinople is very dependent on the Great Powers and probably unsustainable in the long run."
