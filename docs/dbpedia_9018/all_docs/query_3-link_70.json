Having been publishing since its inception in 1961, the catalogue being archived currently contains nearly 27,000 items found on OECD iLibrary. This content will now be accessible for future users long after the platform ceases to exist.\n\nChanges to OECD statistics offer\n\nJanuary 2024 - OECD statistical databases are being migrated to a new platform, the OECD Data Explorer, but will continue to be available via OECD iLibrary. Due to this migration, CSV archive files of the databases will no longer be created, although past archive files will continue to be available. A number of statistical periodicals (PDF files) also have been discontinued; past issues remain available on OECD iLibrary.\n\nIEA Statistics discontinued on OECD iLibrary"
