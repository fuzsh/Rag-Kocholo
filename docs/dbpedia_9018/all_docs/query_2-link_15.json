        "text": "C.F.M. Documents: Lot M–88: Box 2079: CFM Documents\n\nProposals by the Soviet Union Regarding the Free Territory of Trieste20\n\nPeace Treaty With Italy\n\nFree Territory of Trieste\n\n[Note—The words underlined are those proposed by the U.S.S.R. Delegation. Words in brackets are those which the U.S.S.R. Delegation proposes should be deleted.]22\n\nU.S. Proposal (Part A)\n\n1.\n\nThere is hereby constituted the Free Territory of Trieste which is recognized by the Allied and Associated Powers and by Italy. They agree that the integrity and independence of this Free Territory shall be assured by the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n2.\n\n(Description of the frontiers)\n\n3.\n\nItalian sovereignty over the territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and the frontiers as defined in Article 4 of the Treaty terminates upon the coming into force of the Treaty.\n\n4.\n\nOn the termination of Italian sovereignty, the Free Territory of Trieste shall be governed in accordance with a provisional régime to be established [by the Security Council] by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which shall remain in force until such date as the Security Council shall fix for the coming into force of the Permanent Statute which shall have been approved by it. The Free Territory shall thenceforth be governed by the provisions of such Permanent Statute.\n\n5.\n\nThe Free Territory of Trieste shall not be considered as ceded territory within the meaning of Article 13 and Annex III of the present Treaty.\n\n[Page 1157]\n\nFrench Proposal\n\n1.\n\nThe integrity and independence of the Free Territory is assured by the Security Council. This responsibility implies that the Council shall:\n\na.\n\nensure the observance of the Permanent Statute and, in particular, the protection of basic human rights;\n\nb.\n\nensure maintenance of the fundamental principles of public order and security in the Free Territory.\n\n2.\n\nThe Free Territory shall be demilitarized and declared neutral. No armed forces, except upon direction of the Security Council, and in event of a threat to the integrity and independence of the Free Territory of Trieste, shall be located in the Free Territory.\n\n3.\n\nIn conformity with the principle that the legislative and executive authority of the Free Territory shall be shaped on democratic lines, the Permanent Statute of the Free Territory shall provide for the creation of a Popular Assembly elected on the basis of proportional representation by means of universal, direct, equal and secret suffrage, and a Council of Government formed by and responsible to the Assembly.\n\n4.\n\nBy reason of the responsibilities imposed upon the Security Council in regard to the Free Territory it is inevitable that certain limitations shall be imposed upon the powers of the Popular Assembly and the Council of Government. These limitations result from the rights now conferred upon the Governor, subject to any modification which the Security Council may subsequently determine.\n\n5.\n\nThe Governor shall be appointed by the Security Council after consultation with Yugoslavia and Italy. He is the representative of the Security Council in the Free Territory, and shall [in particular] have the duty of supervising the observance of the Statute.\n\n6.\n\nIn matters which [in his view] affect the responsibilities of the Security Council as defined in paragraph 1 above the Governor shall have the right to propose legislation to the Popular Assembly and to prevent the entry into force of legislative measures which are in contradiction with the Statute, subject to reference to the Security Council if the Popular Assembly does not accept his views and recommendations.\n\n7.\n\nAt the meetings of the Council of Government the Governor shall express his views on all matters affecting his responsibilities.\n\n8.\n\nThe primary responsibilities of the Governor shall be:\n\na.\n\nto supervise the maintenance of the fundamental principles of public order and security\n\nb.\n\nthe conduct of foreign relations in close liaison with the elected authorities of the Territory (issue of exequaturs and patents)\n\nc.\n\nthe appointment of the judiciary, except in cases where the Constitution provides for elections, on the advice of the Council of [Page 1158] Government, and subject to safeguards to be established by the Constitution, the removal of members of the judiciary for conduct incompatible with their judicial office.\n\n9.\n\nIn cases where, as a result of exceptional circumstances, the independence and integrity of the Free Territory, public order and security or human and civic rights are endangered, the Governor, in conjunction with the Council of Government, may take all necessary measures.\n\nIn cases where delay is inadmissible the Governor shall take the necessary measures, subject to his making an immediate report to the Security Council. [Under the same reservation he may proclaim a state of siege]\n\n10.\n\nCitizenship\n\na.\n\nDomicile in the Free Territory on June 10th, 1940, as provided in Article 13 of the Peace Treaty with Italy shall be the qualification for acquiring original citizenship of the Free Territory.\n\nb.\n\nThe conditions for the acquisition of citizenship by persons not qualifying for original citizenship shall be determined by the Assembly of the Free Territory and embodied in the Constitution.\n\nc.\n\nThe right of acquiring Trieste citizenship shall not be enjoyed by active members of the Fascist régime in Italy, active members of the Fascist party, war criminals, former members of the Italian police and government officials who came from Italy after the year 1922.\n\n11.\n\nFree Port and Economic Questions\n\n(Proposals will be submitted later)\n\nProvisional Government"
