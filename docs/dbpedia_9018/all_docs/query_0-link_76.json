        "text": "Trieste is one of Italy’s most intriguing cities. For reasons of history and geography Trieste is perhaps both the most and least Italian city in Italy. Let’s explain this concept a bit more – because of its location, in a corner of Europe where the Italian, Slavic, and German cultures meet, Trieste has always been a strategic point. For much of its history it was in conflict with, and overshadowed by, nearby Venice, and so voluntarily sought protection from other powers – mainly the Austrian Hapsburgs. Up to the start of the first World War the city was the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s only mediterranean port, and was a bustling cosmopolitan city. After WWI the city officially became the Free Territory of Trieste being governed up until 1954 by the United Nations. In 1954 the city was officially returned to the Italian state, amidst national celebrations, in 1955 the city’s famous square, known variously as Piazza Grande (in Italian) or Veliki trg was renamed Piazza dell’Unità d’Italia. The immediate postwar years were tense, with Trieste famously marking one point on Churchill’s famous Iron Curtain speech. Tensions remained high with Yugoslavia, after the years of fascist violence and vicious reprisals. Visitors to Trieste today, though, will find a city enjoying a certain renaissance. While off the usual tourist trail for visitors to Italy, it is a gateway to Mitteleuropa, and relations with Slovenia, Croatia, and Austria are better than they have been for decades. It is a thriving city, the capital of one of the richest regions of Italy – Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. In 2012 Trieste was voted one of the most under-rated destinations in the world by the Lonely Planet, and it regularly crops up as one of Italy’s best kept secrets.\n\nHere we’ve put together a number of articles, travel tips and guides for Trieste to help you get the best out of your trip."
