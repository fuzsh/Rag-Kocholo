While she is best known as the iconic Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, Sarah Jessica Parker’s roles in theater, television and film have run the gamut from instant classics like 1984’s Footloose and 1991’s LA Story to cult favorites like 1994’s Ed Wood and 1996’s Mars Attacks! Parker began performing as a child, making her Broadway debut in The Innocents in 1976 and Annie in 1979. She gained a wider audience with performances in Footloose and 1986’s Flight of the Navigator, then went on to play a broad range of romantic comedies and independent movies, such as 1996’s First Wives Club and 2006’s Strangers with Candy. From 1998–2004 she starred in and co-produced Sex and the City, earning four Golden Globes, three SAG awards and two Emmys. While she continues to act in movies and films such as 2005’s The Family Stone and a recurring role on Glee, in 2009 she created a production company, Pretty Matches, which creates content for HBO and other channels such as City.Ballet, which follows the lives of dancers in the New York City Ballet.
