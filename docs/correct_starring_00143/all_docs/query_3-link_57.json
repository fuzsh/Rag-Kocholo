        "text": "There was no real soothing of the cold war between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nWhile fans rejoiced in the news that Cattrall will reprise her iconic role as Samantha Jones in the Season 2 finale of And Just Like That, she did so without seeking or speaking with arch-enemy Parker, nor any of the co-stars, RadarOnline.com has confirmed.\n\nSeason 2 will premiere on the newly rechristened Max, formerly HBO Max, with 11 episodes on June 22.\n\nCattrall was cut out of the much-hyped season one of And Just Like That when writers jettisoned her to London to run her public relations business.\n\n\"I went past the finish line playing Samantha Jones because I loved Sex and the City. It was a blessing in so many ways but after the second movie I’d had enough,\" Cattrall told The Guardian in August 2019.\n\n“I couldn’t understand why they wouldn’t just replace me with another actress instead of wasting time bullying. No means no.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for the RadarOnline.com newsletter to get your daily dose of dope. Daily. Breaking. Celebrity news. All free.\n\nDuring an October 2017 interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall also claimed she was “never friends” with her Sex and the City co-stars.\n\n\"We’ve been colleagues and, in some way, it’s a very healthy place to be,\" the actress said at the time."
