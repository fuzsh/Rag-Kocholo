        "text": "It is a momentous day for Sex and the City fans around the world as Sarah Jessica Parker celebrates her 50th birthday. While the role of Carrie Bradshaw made Sarah a fashion icon and a superstar, she has starred in a wide variety of films and television shows over four decades. Parker began her career as a child star on the stage in Annie, and has gone on to become an enduring fixture in pop culture.\n\nHer movie career was launched with supporting roles in '80s teen comedies Footloose and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, but soon she grew into a leading lady with memorable roles in a string of early 1990s comedies. Parker might be best known for romantic comedies these days, but over the last 30 years she's impressed critics in roles as diverse a mystical witch, an egotistical talkshow host and the embodiment of a single woman of the 2000s.\n\nWe celebrate Sarah Jessica Parker's 50th birthday by looking back at six of her finest movie roles below:\n\n1. Footloose (1984)\n\nThe roots of Sarah Jessica's career derived from working on the stage in musicals from a very early age. Taking a role in the Broadway production of Annie provided the young actress with a wealth of dance training. That experience served her well in the 1984 blockbuster Footloose. Director Herbert Ross's film was adapted from the true story of a small religious community in Oklahoma that banned rock music and dancing on moral grounds.\n\nParker's casting in Footloose followed her breakthrough television role as a poised but unpopular teenager in Square Pegs. Playing the gregarious and fun-loving Rusty, Sarah and her on-screen love interest Chris Penn brought a much-needed comic spark to Footloose. The awkward budding romance between Rusty and Willard (Penn) was perhaps more relatable to many teenagers than the forbidden courtship of Chicago bad boy Ren (Kevin Bacon) and the minister's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer).\n\nAll of the dance training came in handy for a particularly memorable scene as the strains of Kenny Loggins compelled her to cut loose on the dance floor at a local bar, while a dejected Willard could only watch. Sarah Jessica Parker effortlessly capturing Rusty's quirky charm was key to the enduring appeal of Footloose, a film that revived the movie musical for a whole new generation of teenagers.\n\n2. Hocus Pocus (1993)\n\nSarah Jessica Parker transitioned into leading roles with a string of well-received comedies by the 1990s. She earned plaudits for her work in LA Story and Honeymoon in Vegas, but her career took a sharp left turn with her next project. Rather than continue on with more conventional rom-coms, Parker signed up to share the screen with Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy in Disney's horror comedy Hocus Pocus. The trio were a revelation as the mystical Sanderson Sisters, resurrected accidentally by a rebellious teenager to inflict revenge on humanity.\n\nInterestingly, Parker had a loose familial connection to Hocus Pocus's tale of witchcraft. She is descended from Esther Elwell, one of a group of women accused of witchcraft in colonial Salem, Massachusetts. Clearly, Parker was born to play the seductive yet dopey witch Sarah Sanderson. The supremely talented Parker, Midler and Najimy elevated Hocus Pocus above typical kids' fare of the time.\n\nAll three actresses indulged their inner-pantomime villains for Hocus Pocus, and in doing so made the Sanderson Sisters classic Disney villains. Unlike most successful Disney movies of its era, a sequel to Hocus Pocus never quite materialised. Surely the time is right for some poor fool in Salem to resurrect Winifred, Mary and Sarah for more spooky escapades.\n\n3. Miami Rhapsody (1995)\n\nA hidden gem from Sarah Jessica Parker's filmography is Miami Rhapsody. The 1995 movie is the best Woody Allen movie not written, directed or having any involvement from Woody Allen. David Frankel's romantic comedy was clearly aping the all-star casts and tangled love affairs of Woody Allen's best films â€“ but he aped them well! Here, Sarah Jessica Parker was almost a proto-Carrie Bradshaw as a self-sufficient, successful career woman whose love life was nonetheless always in shambles.\n\nWhile Miami Rhapsody is far from a perfect film, Parker particularly sparked when paired with Antonio Banderas. Banderas has always been underrated, and he shined here as a nurse caught up in affairs with both the daughter (Mia Farrow) and granddaughter (Parker) of his elderly patient. The inherent chemistry between Parker and Banderas's conflicted lovers boiled over into a scintillating embrace for one climactic moment â€“ but instantly it's clear that their tryst couldn't last.\n\nMiami Rhapsody might share some of its DNA with the best Woody Allen films, but it also stands on its own as genuinely funny and often-times touching portrayal of the complexities and dysfunctions of love. The film greatly benefits from cinematographer Jack Wallner lovingly capturing the bright and shiny colours of Miami in all of their glory.\n\n4. Mars Attacks! (1996)\n\nMars Attacks! was infamously maligned by critics upon its 1996 release, and its struggle at the domestic box office certainly didn't help its reputation. Admittedly, a movie based on a science fiction trading card game was always going to be a tough sell for middle-America in the 1990s. Director Tim Burton's sci-fi comedy has in recent years undergone a critical re-evaluation as younger viewers give Mars Attacks! credit for being innovative and adventurous.\n\nBurton spared no expense in bringing aboard Hollywood superstars like Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J Fox, Annette Bening, Martin Short and then-current James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan. In a film that included no shortage of bombastic performances, Sarah Jessica Parker earned some of the biggest laughs as opportunistic chatshow host Nathalie Lake.\n\nOne of the film's most memorable scenes featured Nathalie and her pet Chihuahua undergoing the absolute worst kind of alien experiment â€“ the body switch. Parker and Brosnan shared their most prominent screen time in Mars Attacks! together, and exhibited real romantic chemistryâ€¦ even as Sarah Jessica's head was grotesquely implanted on a dog's body. In the triumphant call of the Martians, \"Ak! Ak! Ak!\"\n\n5. The First Wives Club\n\nOne of the consequences of so convincingly playing an air-headed villain in Hocus Pocus was the potential for Sarah Jessica Parker to be typecast. While she would in fact play several villainous characters in mainstream Hollywood films in the mid-1990s, Sarah Jessica turned in interesting and layered performances in each instance. The First Wives Club cast the Hollywood veteran as Shelly, the stereotypical mistress from hell.\n\nParker's natural gift for comedy was display as she made a thoroughly detestable character a delight to behold. Her scenes with Bronson Pinchot as a scheming interior decorator were a particular delight. The actress also more than held her own when paired opposite three all-time great comedic actresses in Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and her Hocus Pocus co-star Bette Midler. That in and of itself was no small feat!\n\n6. Sex and the City: The Movie (2008)\n\nRumours swirled about Sex and the City making the leap from the small screen to the big screen even before its heavily-hyped 2004 finale aired on HBO. The adaptation of a popular television show into a film can be treacherous for very practical reasons. It's not always easy to transplant characters who have been anchored by long-term story arcs into a film that has to introduce and (hopefully) wrap up a totally new challenge for them in two hours. Sex and the City has to be considered one of the more successful TV adaptations, based solely on the first feature film.\n\nThe central question of Sex and the City: The Movie was remarkably simple and yet compelling: What if the happy ending that Carrie Bradshaw appeared to have in the television finale wasn't quite so happy after all? For six years, viewers pined for Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big to end up together in spite of all of the emotional baggage, affairs and dishonesty that continuously tore them apart. Sex and the City: The Movie asked the unsettling question of whether 'happily ever after' was really possible for Carrie Bradshaw.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Chris Noth's undeniable chemistry transferred remarkably well to the big screen. The love story of Carrie and Big has to be considered one of the best in modern fiction, having inspired a generation of singles around the world. If only they'd left it at one movie! Sex and the City 2 was such a wasteful exercise that it almost tainted all that came before it, but it shouldn't be forgotten that the first film was a poignant and ultimately hopeful meditation on modern marriages."
