        "text": "I'm very surprised that I've had these experiences\n\nin certain movies that have really been impactful\n\nin some way, often surprising.\n\nYou know, even Hocus Pocus and LA Story or Ed Wood,\n\nMars Attacks, Sex and the City, these are all things\n\nthat they've been resonant with people for many years.\n\nI feel that's an unusual experience to have\n\nmore than one of those and I feel lucky.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHocus Pocus.\n\nI've only seen it once. [laughing]\n\nI saw the premier the week before it opened, I guess.\n\nThere was a premier in Los Angeles\n\nand that's the only time I've seen it.\n\nSo, I'm often not able to answer a lot of questions.\n\nI mean, I just, obviously we just...\n\nThere's a big anniversary right now,\n\nso I did an interview and I've been reminded of some stuff,\n\nbut most mostly, I only see something one time.\n\nIt's preferable for me.\n\nIt's not pleasant for me to watch myself.\n\nWhen you're watching, at least I find, myself in a movie,\n\nI feel like I'm paying attention to thing that I think\n\nare less important than the story that it's telling.\n\nSometimes you're experiencing the day\n\nthat you were shooting,\n\nbut I really do think audiences remember\n\nmuch more about it than I do.\n\nI remember more the experience of shooting it\n\nthan I do the story.\n\nI'm not entirely sure I could tell you\n\nthe main character's names,\n\nthe children's character's names,\n\nbut the process of shooting was very long.\n\nIt was an unusually long shooting schedule\n\nbecause I think of the special effects.\n\nAnd actually, a bunch of people got sick\n\nso we shut down for a while.\n\nSomebody said to me, well,\n\nwere you surprised it wasn't a bigger hit?\n\nAnd I was like, I had no idea.\n\nI thought it was.\n\nAnd I remember specifically the weekend that it opened\n\nI was in Los Angeles still\n\nI guess because I was out there doing press\n\nand the phone rang very early on a Saturday morning I think\n\nand it was Jeffrey Katzenberg\n\nscreaming we made nine million...\n\nSo, my experience was that it was a great success.\n\nWell, it certainly made its money back.\n\nLA Story.\n\nI got a call from my agent\n\nand there was a casting director in Los Angeles.\n\nI think her name was Mindy Maren,\n\nand she was casting this new Steve Martin movie\n\nthat he'd written,\n\nand I loved Steve Martin and knew a huge amount\n\nabout his work and very particular things\n\nabout the way he worked.\n\nAnd so I loved him and I very much wanted the part,\n\nbut it seemed like a real long shot to me.\n\nAnd for some reason, I understood her.\n\nI understood, or I thought I understood,\n\nwhat I sort of assumed Steve Martin imagined\n\nas he wrote this part.\n\nAnd I enjoyed myself.\n\nIt wasn't an audition where I was really nervous,\n\nwhich one can be.\n\nAnd then I just kept getting called back\n\nand I did a screen test with Steve Martin,\n\nwhich was really fun and terrifying also.\n\nBut yeah, then I got the part and got to play it.\n\nSandy in LA Story is, she has no definition, really.\n\nShe's sort of this floating, ever-changing,\n\nthis person who's soaking up other ideas\n\nof a definition or an identity,\n\nand she's foolish and silly\n\nand doesn't seem terribly bright.\n\nI mean, she's probably brighter than she lets on,\n\nbut for some reason I think she has to...\n\nMaybe she's more attractive if she's not smart.\n\nSome memories on movies become sort of mushy.\n\nYou remember an experience rather than specificity,\n\nbut I yeah, I remember vividly many scenes.\n\nIn particular, I think from the beginning I had this idea\n\nthat she would be moving all the time.\n\nThat wasn't really written so much in the script,\n\nthe bouncing.\n\nThere was a specific movement\n\nthat was almost written as stage direction\n\nand almost like choreography,\n\nbut there was others that I just started doing.\n\nAnd eventually, the director, Mick Jackson,\n\nwho I loved and I had, he done all these,\n\nhe had done great films in the UK and in London,\n\nhe would eventually just get to the point\n\nwhere he just had a megaphone.\n\nHe'd say and bounce and action,\n\nlike he would just tell me to bounce around.\n\nBut yeah, I sort of remember all the scenes\n\nand time off camera as well.\n\nSitting, waiting, kind of staring at Steve.\n\nI guess for some people it feels a little bit\n\nlike it's a little bit an amber.\n\nIt was a very specific time and a way of observing\n\nthe larger sort of ideas about Los Angeles.\n\nI'll have a decaf coffee.\n\nI'll have a decaf espresso.\n\nI I'll have a double decaf cappuccino.\n\nDo you have any decaffeinated coffee ice cream?\n\nI'll have a half double decaffeinated half-caf\n\nwith a twist of lemon.\n\nI'll have a twist of lemon.\n\nMy guess is that they'd be still really accurate.\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas.\n\nI think I got the part in Honeymoon in Vegas\n\nbecause of LA Story.\n\nThat's what Andy Bergman told me when I met him.\n\nI didn't even audition for Honeymoon in Vegas,\n\nthey just offered me the part,\n\nwhich I really couldn't believe.\n\nI couldn't believe.\n\nI'd never been offered a part, especially a lead in a movie,\n\nand a real major motion picture.\n\nAnd she wasn't similar at all to Sandy,\n\nwhich is what surprised me\n\nabout being cast based on LA Story.\n\nBut Betsy in Honeymoon in Vegas is really bright.\n\nShe's a schoolteacher,\n\nshe's a professional person and shows up every day\n\nand is, in fact, very conventional,\n\nwhich is the opposite of Sandy who defies all convention\n\nand doesn't believe in any conventions period.\n\nBetsy is a teacher who believes in kind of rules\n\nand a model for living,\n\nbut funny because she's written by Andy Bergman\n\nwho's one of the great comedy screenwriters.\n\nYou brought me to Las Vegas\n\nand you turned me into a hooker, Jack!\n\nI read with all the men.\n\nThere were many many auditions and screen tests,\n\nand it was very apparent to everybody\n\nthe minute that Nick came in.\n\nI mean, there was just nothing more to be said\n\nand nobody else to meet.\n\nWorking with him was fantastic.\n\nI mean, it was truly great and inspired\n\nand fun and surprising, very very surprising,\n\nand it just made my job easy in a way.\n\nI mean, it's not easy,\n\nbut there was really the most perfect example\n\nof listening responding because he's so compelling opposite.\n\nAnd yeah, I mean, I loved him.\n\nWorking with James Caan was incredible.\n\nHe has this very kind of amazing thing\n\nthat I've never seen in another actor's eyes\n\nin my entire life,\n\nand I've stared across and looked in the eyes\n\nof a lot of actors, and especially male actors.\n\nHis eyes actually flicker.\n\nIt's a very...\n\nI've not seen anybody else's eyes actually spark.\n\nThey sort of have flashes in them.\n\nThat is, it's really something,\n\nand it can be both terrifying and seductive,\n\nbut when it's terrifying, it's really quite something.\n\nEd Wood.\n\nTim just had been pondering this, making this,\n\ntelling this story for a very long time,\n\nand he just had a wealth of stuff\n\nfor me to read and look at, and that was really important.\n\nBut then there comes a point\n\nwhere you're just trying to be real\n\ngiven your script and the scenes that I had to play.\n\nI think the harder part is just\n\nI really wanted to mimic those scenes\n\nthat we were recreating, which was an amazing experience.\n\nWe were really within the scale everything, and to me,\n\nthat was the most...\n\nThat's the thing I wanted to be most authentic about.\n\nThe rest of it you can't quite do\n\nwhen you're playing somebody real.\n\nYou don't wanna...\n\nThen you get too caught up in things\n\nthat you have no control over.\n\nBut the recreation of those scenes was hugely exciting\n\nand fun to sort out and get right,\n\nand I listened over and over again\n\nand watched those clips over and over again.\n\nI think they're pretty close.\n\nWorking for Tim Burton, and that was the first time,\n\nI did another movie with him shortly after that,\n\nand he's just absolutely fantastic to work for\n\nbecause he's so clear and so specific.\n\nEvery frame is...\n\nYou understand so well what he wants.\n\nI think his specificity is enormously helpful.\n\nYou're really fitting into a painting\n\nthat he's kind of already created, and I like that.\n\nI love working with Johnny Depp.\n\nI thought he was really sweet and great to work with,\n\ngreat on the set to everybody, human, deeply human,\n\nand just loved his work.\n\nHe loved his work.\n\nHe loved being an actor.\n\nAnd Martin Landau played Lugosi, and he won an Oscar.\n\nIt was thrilling and so deserved.\n\nI mean, he'd been around for so long\n\nand had been doing great work for a really long time\n\nand he was such a good, kind man.\n\nSo humble, you know, he was journeyman.\n\nHe was just working all the time\n\nand so happy to be working when he was,\n\nand he was a great, lovely person.\n\nMars Attacks!\n\nTim Burton just asked if I would do Mars Attacks!\n\nand I said yes.\n\nI mean, anybody would've.\n\nI mean, when I read the script I was like really?\n\nAlright, you know, sure.\n\nI mean, I just think anybody would want\n\nto work with Tim Burton and would wanna do,\n\nno matter how strange, kinda help him fulfill his vision.\n\nI wasn't at all familiar with those kids of movies.\n\nI mean, with the exception of familiarizing myself\n\nwith Ed Wood genre and those movies,\n\nI didn't really know as much the movies\n\nthat he was sort of kind of recreating in a way.\n\nYou kinda do what you're told in a way that I really like.\n\nThere's always a really strong costume designer\n\nwhose point of view is playing a really pivotal part\n\nin what an audience is experiencing,\n\nand the hair and makeup department's always really strong.\n\nI mean, there's all these other creative influences\n\nthat are helping you so much.\n\nYeah, I turned into, was it her dog?\n\nI think it was her dog.\n\n[Man] Natalie, is that you?\n\nYes.\n\nHow are you feeling?\n\nPierce Brosnan was involved in that.\n\nWas he a wild, like a crazy scientist, like a mad scientist?\n\nSomething like that. Yeah, something like that.\n\nThe Family Stone.\n\nI loved that part, and once again,\n\nthat was the kind of part I've never played before\n\nand I really, I really liked it.\n\nI mean, I was very nervous in a way making that movie.\n\nNot daily on the set, but trying to figure it out.\n\nTom Bazucha who wrote and directed it,\n\nTom was really helpful.\n\nTom was really, he was strict with me in an interesting way.\n\nHe wanted me to play this part,\n\nbut he also wanted pieces of me gone.\n\nSo, it was interesting and I was very happy to...\n\nI didn't feel that he was not appreciative\n\nof what I have to bring or my own skills,\n\nbut he wanted something else for me.\n\nAnd part of that was really scary\n\nbecause it was being watched in a way, I felt.\n\nAnd I was intimidated by Diane Keaton\n\neven though I had known her.\n\nWe did First Wives Club years before,\n\nbut this was so intimately...\n\nWe were in each other's faces so much,\n\nand I wanted her to like me, but I loved that movie.\n\nI was really proud of it.\n\nI was proud of everybody's work, I was proud of my work,\n\nand when I saw it, I loved it.\n\nI mean, I really loved it.\n\nI love Craig T. Nelson.\n\nI mean, the whole cast is many people have gone on.\n\nThere were some folks in that movie\n\nwho were relatively unknown at the time.\n\nNot unknown, but you know,\n\nRachel McAdams and Elizabeth Reaser.\n\nThese were actresses that were just starting to emerge,\n\nand I thought Luke Wilson was so great in it and Dermott.\n\nI thought they were such great performances.\n\nSex and the City.\n\nThat part and that story and that...\n\nI think they are so daily in my life\n\nin ways that are probably very obvious\n\nand then ways that aren't,\n\nwhether it's people on Instagram\n\nor walking down the street of New York\n\nor people seeing me or me having a memory of a cross street\n\nwhere I shot two dozen or more scenes.\n\nSo, I feel like it's not far away,\n\nbut the experience is in many ways, and I feel,\n\nfor the most part I feel fine about it.\n\nI mean, I had hopes that we would get to make another movie,\n\nand I as excited I think\n\nbecause it finally felt right in the story.\n\nSo, I mostly feel great,\n\nlike I love where we got to leave all of them.\n\nI think they're all probably doing really well\n\nand still enjoying that friendship and their city\n\nor maybe some hame left.\n\nCharlotte might have finally moved to the suburbs,\n\nmy guess is.\n\nBut it's a real privilege to have that.\n\nNot just the memory of the experience,\n\nbut have the connection with the audience\n\nthat was initially along with us and discovering us,\n\nbut today, a whole new generation of young women\n\nstop me literally every single day of my life\n\nto share their feelings and thoughts and affection\n\nfor this show and the movie,\n\nand that's a privilege and it's a professional blessing,\n\nno doubt.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIt's not so much that I feel Carrie within me.\n\nI mean, we would have stretches of time\n\nand then we'd come back to work\n\nand you would sort it out pretty quickly.\n\nYou'd rediscover like it's a muscle or something\n\nthat is slightly atrophied on a hiatus.\n\nSo, you'd find that stuff very quickly,\n\nbut it's part of you in ways that you can't...\n\nIT's hard to articulate the ways in which it sort of,\n\nit's in you.\n\nIt's part of your memories,\n\nit's part of your most important professional moments\n\nand years and time spent,\n\nit's incredibly sentimental and nostalgic.\n\nBut the character isn't in me because I...\n\nShe's somebody else's creation, really,\n\nand I long to play other people and other parts.\n\nBut if asked to find her again, I could manage.\n\nHere and Now.\n\nWell, the character in Here and Now,\n\nher name is Vivian and she is a singer\n\nwith relative success in New York.\n\nShe's had a career that she's both,\n\nthat is both a source of pride and frustration.\n\nThe movie really is a story\n\nabout a woman who gets a diagnosis,\n\nand it's a portrait of this next 24 hours in her life\n\nas she absorbs this information.\n\nAnd it's about love and loss and I think coming to terms\n\nwith the role you've played in your own life\n\nand the relationships you have with those around you\n\nand with the city that both loves and betrays you."
