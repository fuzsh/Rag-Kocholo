        "text": "Sarah Jessica Parker (born March 25, 1965, Nelsonville, Ohio, U.S.) is an American actress who was perhaps best known for her role on the television series Sex and the City (1998–2004).\n\nParker took ballet and acting classes as a child, and at age 11 she moved with her family to New York City so that she and her siblings could pursue careers in entertainment. In 1978 she landed the lead role in Broadway’s Annie, and she stayed with the musical for some three years. Other stage work followed, and in 1979 she made her film debut in Rich Kids. In 1982 Parker portrayed a high-school nerd in the television series Square Pegs. Although the show lasted only one season, it developed a cultlike following and led to several film offers, including Footloose (1984) and Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nParker continued her work in theatre, appearing in The Heidi Chronicles (1989); The Substance of Fire (1991); Sylvia (1995), for which she earned critical praise for her portrayal of a dog; and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1996). In the latter play she appeared with her longtime boyfriend, Matthew Broderick; the couple married in 1997. Parker also starred in the Broadway revival Once upon a Mattress (1996–97). In 2022 she and Broderick headlined a production of Neil Simon’s Plaza Suite.\n\nIn 1991 Parker’s film career received a boost with her performance opposite Steve Martin as the bouncy SanDeE* in L.A. Story. Other movies quickly followed, notably Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), Hocus Pocus (1993), Ed Wood (1994), and The First Wives Club (1996), but the roles failed to establish Parker as a leading lady. That changed, however, with Sex and the City. Premiering in 1998, the series, inspired by the best-selling book by Candace Bushnell, brought Parker unprecedented attention. The show centred on four friends—Carrie Bradshaw (played by Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), and Charlotte (Kristin Davis)—searching for Mr. Right in New York City. Broadcast on the cable channel HBO, the series became a pop culture phenomenon with its uncensored, humorous, and, at times, risqué look at the lives of thirtysomethings. Parker’s comedic and compassionate performance as relationship columnist Carrie won numerous honours, including Emmy Awards (2001 and 2004) and Golden Globe Awards (2000–02 and 2004).\n\nAfter Sex and the City ended in 2004, she starred in such movies as The Family Stone (2005) and the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006). Parker later reprised her role as Carrie in the film versions of Sex and the City (2008 and 2010). In 2009 she starred with Hugh Grant in Did You Hear About the Morgans?, a comedy about a married couple who enter a witness-protection program after seeing a murder. She later appeared as an overworked mother in the comedy I Don’t Know How She Does It (2011) and provided the voice of an alien in the animated Escape from Planet Earth (2013).\n\nParker later returned to HBO with a starring role in the comedy series Divorce (2016–19), in which she played a wife and mother who decides to end her marriage. She then reprised the role of Carrie Bradshaw in And Just Like That… (2021– ), a series that was described as a “new chapter” of Sex and the City. In 2022 Parker returned to another earlier character when she costarred with Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy in Hocus Pocus 2, a sequel to the 1993 cult classic."
