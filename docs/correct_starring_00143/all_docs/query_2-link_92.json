        "text": "Background\n\nSarah Jessica Parker was born on 25 March 1965 and is one of eight children. The actress spent her early life helping her mother and stepfather as much as she could. She earned money through singing and dancing gigs, thanks to her schooling at the American Ballet Theater, and started to gain attention from a young age. Her first Broadway role saw the actress taking a spot in “The Innocents,” followed by “The Sound Of Music,” which saw her and four of her siblings touring the country. Her family decided to move to New Jersey at this point, encouraging the future star’s career in the limelight and helping her work towards a successful Broadway career. The actress’s first Broadway role saw her take over the title role in the Broadway show “Annie,” further cementing her place in the spotlight! While Parker could have gone on to have a very successful career on Broadway, in 1982 the actress found herself starring in her first T.V. sitcom “Square Pegs.” The years that followed would see this star rise through the ranks as she starred in other T.V. roles in “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” and “Footloose.”\n\nA breakthrough in this actress’s career was her evolution from teen roles to more adult ones and in 1991, she starred in “L.A. Story,” further cementing her name in Hollywood. Roles that followed include “Honeymoon in Vegas,” where she played Betsy Nolan, and “Ed Wood,” where she played Dolores Fuller. Her most notorious role was as Carrie Bradshaw in the hit T.V. series “Sex In The City”. Winning several different Golden Globe awards, the Critically Acclaimed T.V. Show, and later movie series is a well-known and beloved series that thrust the star into the spotlight even further, cementing her name as one of Hollywood’s biggest names!\n\nHer marriage to her husband, Matthew Broderick, did not slow the actress in the slightest and they must have been doing something right as they are still married today! The couple welcomed their son, James Wilke Broderick, five years after they married; born in October 2002. In 2009, the power couple had twin daughters, Marion Loretta Elwell and Tabitha Hodge."
