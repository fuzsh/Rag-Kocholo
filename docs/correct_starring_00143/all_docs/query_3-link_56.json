        "text": "For 94 television episodes spanning almost a decade, the friendship of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda in Sex and the City was set as the highest benchmark for female friendship.\n\nEven when they returned for two feature films - one good, one not so good - it was proof that such friendships were indestructible.\n\nAfter all, if Sex and the City 2 couldn't kill it, what could?\n\nIt turns out just three words did it in.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan last year actress Kim Cattrall - who played Samantha - said she and her co-stars had \"never been friends\", just colleagues.\n\nSpeaking overnight on the US talk show Watch What Happens Live, actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who played Carrie, said Cattrall's words left her \"heartbroken\".\n\n\"I found it very upsetting,\" Parker told host Andy Cohen. \"That's not the way I recall our experience. So it's sad.\"\n\nParker said she hoped the four women who starred in the hit series were bound in friendship by their \"singular experience\".\n\n\"It was a professional experience but it became personal because it was years and years of our life,\" Parker said.\n\nTo put some context to Cattrall's comments, they were made in the aftermath of confirmation that a third Sex and the City film would not be made.\n\nThe media narrative around the film's cancellation was more or less that Cattrall had sunk it by attaching additional demands around her agreement to star in the film.\n\nUnlike many established pop culture franchises which could withstand a recast, Sex and the City is one of those rare properties where actor and character alchemy is key; without all four actresses on board a third film would have been impossible.\n\nCattrall denied sinking the project in her interview with Morgan.\n\n\"To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous,\" she said.\n\nShe then said this: \"We've never been friends. We've been colleagues and in some way, it's a very healthy place to be.\"\n\nPlans for the third film solidified last year.\n\nParker had described the planned third film - most likely a final chapter to the larger story - as a \"beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story\".\n\nThe series, which ran between 1998 and 2004, was based on the book of the same name by Candace Bushnell, about the friendship of four women living and working in New York.\n\nParker played journalist Carrie Bradshaw and Cattrall played publicist Samantha Jones; co-stars Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon played art dealer Charlotte York and lawyer Miranda Hobbes.\n\nThe series was followed by two feature films, Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010), as well as a teen-aged prequel television series, The Carrie Diaries."
