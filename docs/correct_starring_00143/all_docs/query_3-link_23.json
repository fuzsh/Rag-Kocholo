        "text": "Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big are back in the City of Love.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Chris Noth were spotted filming the upcoming “Sex and the City” revival, “And Just Like That…,” on the Pont des Arts in Paris on Sunday.\n\nThe footbridge is popular among couples who write their names on padlocks, attach them to the railing and then throw the keys in the Seine river as a sign of their love.\n\nWhile it’s unclear what the scene was about, Parker, 56, wore a dress and lace cropped cardigan while Noth, 66, had on a black suit.\n\nThe duo previously filmed in Paris for the series finale of “Sex and the City” in 2004 when Mr. Big came to find Carrie while she was abroad with her boyfriend, Aleksandr Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov).\n\nHe told her that he wanted to be with her, and they got back together in the end.\n\nSunday’s sighting may come as a shock to fans who read rumors about Noth’s character potentially being dead in the upcoming series.\n\nA leaked script also pointed to Carrie and Mr. Big divorcing.\n\n“And Just Like That…” began filming in New York City in June and has continued production despite the Sept. 21 death of Willie Garson, who played Carrie’s best friend Stanford Blatch.\n\nParker called Garson’s death from pancreatic cancer “unbearable,” writing on Instagram last month that her initial silence on the news was “a statement. Of the gravity. The anguish. The magnitude of the loss of a 30 + year friendship.\n\n“A real friendship that allowed for secrets, adventure, a shared professional family, truth, concerts, road trips, meals, late night phone calls, a mutual devotion to parenthood and all the heartaches and joy that accompany, triumphs, disappointments, fear, rage and years spent on sets (most especially Carrie’s apartment) and laughing late into the night as both Stanford and Carrie and Willie and SJ.”\n\nShe concluded her post, “Willie. I will miss everything about you. And replay our last moments together. I will re-read every text from your final days and put to pen our last calls. Your absence a crater that I will fill with blessing of these memories and all the ones that are still in recesses yet to surface.”\n\nGarson had been photographed filming scenes for the revival shortly before his death."
