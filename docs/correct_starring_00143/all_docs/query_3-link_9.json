I'll buy just about any premise Hollywood is selling, provided it is sold well. Did You Hear about the Morgans? proves thes...\n\nEd Wood\n\nA title like \"the Worst Director of All Time\" virtually assures that people will remember Ed Wood, although perhaps not in exactly the way the filmmaker would have preferred. Tim Burton, with a biopic that is as much a parody as a tribute, has bro...\n\nFailure to Launch\n\nFailure to Launch fails at more than just launching. It fails at romance and comedy. It fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable. And it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend...\n\nFamily Stone, The\n\nIt's a tough thing for a dysfunctional-family-at-Christmas movie to avoid doses of melodrama, and it's fair to say that The Family Stone contains its share. But the nice thing about the movie is that it avoids overt manipulation.
