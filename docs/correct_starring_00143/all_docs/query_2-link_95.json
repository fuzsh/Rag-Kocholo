        "text": "Square Pegs (1982-3)\n\nSJP's first lead role came in CBS teen comedy Square Pegs. The show followed a group of high school freshmen attempting to navigate student cliques, fit in, and ultimately attain popularity, “Even if it kills us”, as Lauren (Amy Linker, pictured above) would say to Parker’s character Patty at the start of each episode. It was through a co-star on this show that she landed the role as Ariel's friend Rusty in Footloose the next year.\n\nGirls Just Want to Have Fun (1985)\n\nThe Disney Channel currently owns the rights to this film, about two girls (played by SJP and Helen Hunt) who audition to perform on their favourite dance show Dance TV. Parker’s character Janey is paired with naturally gifted Jeff, but a spoiled rich girl Natalie tries to stop her success by underhand means. The next year, she played a friendly NASA intern in Disney's Flight of the Navigator.\n\nStriking Distance (1993)\n\nParker plays the new partner of detective Tom Hardy (Bruce Willis), who has been demoted to water-way patrol after speaking out against the police force in a murder investigation. The action thriller sees Hardy investigating a series of murders the victims of which are all women he has previously been close to.\n\nEd Wood (1994)\n\nTim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Parker on the set of Ed Wood. Parker starred alongside Depp as Dolores Fuller, girlfriend of the eponymous struggling director. The biopic charted the time in which Wood made his most well-known films (such as Plan 9 From Outer Space), and somewhat ironically garnered more critical acclaim that Wood's films ever did.\n\nSex and the City (1998 – 2004)\n\nSJP landed her most iconic role as New York socialite and columnist Carrie Bradshaw on the HBO sitcom in 1998. After the pilot, she didn’t expect the show to be commissioned, and didn’t want to commit to Carrie for a full series, let alone six years. However, after feeling as though the show was “just not the right fit”, she later admitted that she “didn’t regret one moment spent on it”. In 2012, the New York apartment production used as Carrie’s home sold for nearly $10 million.\n\nSpinning into Butter (2007)\n\nParker stepped into the producing role for the first time on Spinning into Butter, a movie adaptation of a play by Rebecca Gilman in which she also starred. Her character, Sarah Daniels, is the dean of upper class new England college who has to confront her own prejudices when it becomes her job to deal with a speight of racially motivated hate crimes.\n\nSex and the City: The Movie (2008)\n\nAfter a four year hiatus, Parker reprised her role as Carrie Bradshaw in the Sex and the City film, directed by SATC series writer Michael Patrick King. It was the highest grossing romcom of 2008, and recorded the highest ever grossing opening weekend for a film with all-female leads.\n\nDid You Hear About the Morgans? (2009)\n\nParker starred alongside Hugh Grant for the second time in this romcom about a New York power couple on the verge of divorce, who are relocated to a small Wyoming town under a witness protection programme.\n\nSex and the City 2 (2010)\n\nThe SATC film sequel saw Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte travel to Abu-Dhabi. Director Michael Patrick King aimed to make an extravagant and escapist movie due to the recession. The location was chosen for its relevance in the world of fashion and also for the fact that it was not hit as hard by the recession. Since its release, speculation about a third film has been rife, but never officially confirmed.\n\nI Don't Know How She Does It (2011)\n\nParker starred as Kate Reddy in I Don't Know How She Does It, an adaptation of Allison Pearson’s novel of the same name about a finance executive who is the breadwinner for her family of four. It earned SJP a Razzie Worst Actress nomination, although she was beaten to the award by Adam Sandler performing in drag in Jack and Jill. In 2012, she appeared in three episodes of teen musical-drama Glee, as an editor for Vogue in New York, who takes on Kurt as a fashion assistant. Her latest film is set for release later this year. True to form, she plays a glamourous although uptight American woman in a plot that sees her character, Maggie, embark on a roadtrip across Italy to with her former lover, on the tail of her rebellious teenage daughter (played by British actress Rosie Day)."
