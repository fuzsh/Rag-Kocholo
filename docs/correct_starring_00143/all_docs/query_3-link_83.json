        "text": "The rejoice was audible the world over when it was announced that a Sex And The City sequel was on its way and, upon And Just Like That’s release in 2021, conversations - both positive and some decidedly less so - erupted around its stable of protagonists.\n\nFrom the titular Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, and her tumultuous relationship with John James Preston, portrayed by Chris Noth (aka 'Big'), to Cynthia Nixon’s character Miranda Hobbes’ sexual awakening, the series has tackled a bevy of lingering questions in its two season run, many of which Sex And The City left unanswered. It's also introduced a trickle of new, but no less fabulous, leading ladies into its midst, with the inimitable Lisa Todd Wexley, played by Nicole Ari Parker, and Dr. Nya Wallace, played by Karen Pittman, among them. The best part is that it’s set to return for a third season too, with our favourite New Yorkers set to reprise their roles once again.\n\nIn case you’re missing the gang a little too much and wondering, besides sipping on Cosmpolitans, just what they’ve been up to since AJLT premiered in 2021, we rounded up exactly where they’ve been and what they’ve been doing."
