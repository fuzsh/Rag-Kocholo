        "text": "We give great kudos to mononymous celebrities, known only by a single name, be it Madonna, Cher, or Beyoncé. Yet how many famous faces can be conjured by the still smaller designation of an acronym – and conjured the world over to boot? Not since JFK has the planet bowed down to a three-initial phenomenon in the way that it salutes SJP, the actress, Sex and the City style icon, and all-round good egg that is Sarah Jessica Parker. SJP is currently demonstrating that good eggness about the nation’s capital: a love-in which she adores London and London sure as hell adores her.\n\nThe city was a formative childhood passion. She has revealed: “I first came to London when I was 11. I’d watch the Changing of the Guard and, one day, I took my cardigan off and draped it over the gate of Buckingham Palace. I went back the next day and it was still there. My dad exclaimed: ‘Look how civilised the people of London are – they’re so honest and honour-bound!’ Then I said: ‘Some day when I’m a grown-up, I’ll live in London because that’s where grown-ups live.”\n\nAnd here she very much is. Parker, 58, and her husband of almost 30 years, Matthew Broderick, 61, are in town to star in Plaza Suite at the Savoy theatre, the performer’s West End debut. Tickets are going fast, its run extended, and the stage door nightly besieged.\n\nIts audiences have included Bill Nighy, Ralph Fiennes, David Tennant and James McAvoy. Ticket prices are not cheap – up to £300 with packages including champagne and sundry extras for £395 – the play’s marital relationships lent frisson by having a celebrity couple at the helm. Yet, The Telegraph’s Dominic Cavendish has declared our heroine “terrific entertainment value”, another critic declaring her a “revelation”.\n\nThis latter commentator was a woman. All I mean by this is that Parker is a brilliant actress by anybody’s reckoning, but she is particularly fluent in femininity. And her frolic about the capital has been brimming with girlish delight. Of course, there was the gala to celebrate the play’s opening, at which she embodied Hollywood glitz in a sequined frock by local girl Jenny Packham, teamed with diamonds and coruscating arm candy (her bag rather than Broderick). Such is SJP hysteria that, back in September, even cool broads Cara Delevingne and Charlotte Tilbury posed excitedly for pictures with the woman who gave the world Carrie Bradshaw.\n\nHowever, SJP’s London life is not all glam – far from it. As her Instagram feed reveals, her adventures also embrace shopping, seeing plays, reading novels, clocking graffiti, even – this from a 2019 trip – visiting Timpson’s the shoe heeler (“with Manolos?” a million foot fetishists sighed). She is a fan of Sadiq Khan, makes Tate Modern her “first stop”, and even professes a pash for London Transport; a step further than many are prepared to go, civilian or sleb. And, from her packing – in a suitcase adorned with shoes on which her cat, Lotus, was perching – to waking up to the London Eye, she has carried us every step of the way.\n\nI know how approachable SJP is because I have my own capital-based anecdote. Back in my dancing days, I was sipping pink fizz after-hours in Claridge’s Foyer Library with a couple of dashing bachelors. The hotel was silent, its doors now locked. SJP, who had been mobbed hours earlier at the centre of a magnificent bash, crept downstairs in her pyjamas to admire the place sans gawkers. “Hello,” she whispered shyly, like any girl caught in her pjs, then sighed “Beautiful!” while gazing at the pictures of Hollywood legends gracing its walls. We raised our coupes, but left her to her own devices, allowing her privacy in the home-from-home in which she sups on spag bol with Hugh Grant, and her portrait too hangs on the wall.\n\nAnd this is the glory of SJP, a businesswoman who manages to be a mother of three, hold down a relationship – with Ferris Bueller, no less! – with a chap she first ventured on a date with in 1992, and yet a bestower of all-powerful pizzazz. Sarah Jessica Parker is one of the last old-school stars. She knows what responsibilities come with this status, and that it demands not merely magic, but manners, humanity, and genuine charm. And we, in turn, respect – and cherish – her.\n\n“She feels like my sister – only a lot nicer,” confides one fan. Perhaps this is because, not only does SJP issue from humble Ohio beginnings (her step-father was a truck driver), but she had a host of actual siblings (seven, “full” and “half”). Funds were understandably tight. Either way, SJP is the sister-by-choice who is your closest friend. As such, she boasts soul siblings not merely in London, but around the world, girls and gays ready to take a bullet for her, let alone fork out 400 quid.\n\nTake me, not even a particular Sex and the City groupie. Unslept, I have consumed an entire tin of the 18th Century Barcelonan brand Amatllons’s pralines in order to pen this panegyric. And, I know that SJP would not only approve, she’d go and get me another, relishing a conversation about how I will reuse said tins. I may go and leave a box at the Savoy’s stage door.\n\nUntil April 13. Tickets: plazasuiteuk.com"
