        "text": "2008\n\nCity Locations\n\nNew York, Los Angeles (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nApartment, House, Restaurant, Cafe, Storefront, Mansion\n\nLocation Styles\n\nMediterranean, Modern Building, Beachfront, Beach House, Colonial\n\nAbout Sex and the City\n\nSex and the City showcased a fantastic reunion of four women we grew to love from the same-titled TV series. Michael Patrick King directed the movie, starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon.\n\nViewers catch up with Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), who is still involved with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and consumed with her passion for name-brand accessories. Meanwhile, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) adjusts to married life and motherhood. At the same time, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) hangs on to her dreams, and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) lives with her handsome TV star boyfriend, Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis), in Los Angeles.\n\nThe movie follows familiar themes from the series as all four friends navigate their lives through love, energy, and friendship while exploring fashion, career, and identity. It touches on complicated subject matters such as relationship dynamics, homosexuality, sexual freedom, and gender roles.\n\nSex and the City generally received mixed reviews from critics. It was commercially successful, making over $415 million in worldwide box office receipts against a budget of $65 million.\n\nSex and the City Locations\n\nThe production of the popular romantic comedy Sex and the City took place in multiple locations around New York City. Lower Manhattan and Upper East Side neighborhoods provided the setting for most scenes. The bustling streets of SoHo, with its narrow cobblestone roads and cast-iron buildings, served as a backdrop for several other sequences.\n\nOther places seen on film include Central Park, with its tranquil nature trails and rolling meadows, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Chinatownâs colorful streets. One of the highlights from Sex and the City includes Carrie Bradshawâs beautiful apartment across from The Met. The canopied entrance is around East 82nd Street, but a different house served as the filming set for the interior scenes.\n\nIn addition to these exciting locales, tours are available that will help fans retrace the steps taken by their favorite characters from the show. A trip to New York would be worthwhile for those wishing to experience some of these locations firsthand. With breathtaking views, well-known landmarks, delicious food, and fascinating cultures, there is no shortage of things to see or do while taking a self-guided tour through some of historyâs most memorable spots.\n\nSet a few years after the events of the Sex and the City TV series, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) finds herself in a committed relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), and they begin searching for apartments to move in together. Carrie falls in love with a penthouse that exceeds their budget.\n\nCarrie is astounded by the beauty of the building, and a classical score emphasizes her dreaminess. Fans can recall her line. \"Hello! I live here!\" Big surprises her with the dream apartment at 1010 Fifth Avenue, directly across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nHowever, the actual canopied entrance is around the corner on East 82nd Street, just a few blocks from the apartment. An entirely different house provided the setting for the interior scenes.\n\nBoth locations are on the same street and only a 10-minute walk apart. They are privately owned residences, so visitors can only view the exterior of the buildings. To get there from Brooklyn, take a private car ride via I-278 E or public transportation by bus.\n\nCharlotte (Kristin Davis) announces the news of Carrieâs (Sarah Jessica Parker) engagement to Big (Chris Noth), and all the restaurant patrons cheer. The location where this momentous event takes place is The Modern, a chic French/New American restaurant at 9 West 53rd Street, located inside the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).\n\nAs its name implies, The Modern offers an inviting modernist space with garden views that add to its aura of sophistication. The MoMA opened in 1929 and has one of the most impressive collections of modern art, architecture, and design. It also has an extensive cinema collection of over 22,000 films and four million film stills.\n\nFans can easily visit two locations to relive the scene and enjoy the museum.\n\nTo reach The Modern, take a train or bus from Brooklyn or nearby areas to the 5th Avenue & 53rd Street station, which serves this location. You can easily walk to the museum, between Fifth and Sixth Avenue, from the bus stop.\n\nSamantha (Kim Cattrall) relocates to Los Angeles near Smith (Jason Lewis). She frequently flies back to New York to spend time with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), and Charlotte (Kristin Davis). Upon returning to Los Angeles, Samantha appears lonely, as Smith is often busy filming from morning until night.\n\nThe scene shows an aerial view of the house featuring its three levels, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, and modern design. It perfectly encapsulates her loneliness despite being with Smith; the emptiness of their relationship against the backdrop of such a luxurious home speaks volumes about her inner state.\n\nLiving on the West Coast, Samantha is adapting to a monogamous life in a striking three-level glass-arch house at 24826 Malibu Road, situated in the luxurious beachfront properties east of Malibu itself, close to Malibu Bluffs Park. Fans can rent the place or admire the exterior views of this iconic house.\n\nTake Pacific Coast Highway (Route 1) and turn onto Ramirez Canyon Road in Malibu. Continue driving past the Ramirez Canyon park until you reach the dead end. From there, you can find Samantha's home at 24826 Malibu Road.\n\nTo comfort Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the women take her on the planned honeymoon to Mexico, where they unwind and regain their composure. The group enjoys their time together, but it takes a while for Carrie to find laughter again. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) confronts Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) about letting herself go.\n\nCharlotte (Kristin Davis), paranoid about consuming the water, accidentally drinks some in the shower. Regrettably, this results in an awkward bout of diarrhea.\n\nFrom Charlotte's paranoid sanitizing routine to Samantha's uncharacteristically supportive advice, it set up one of the critical moments in the movie.\n\nSamantha's home is near Villa Lizton, an opulent resort with a Mexican flair, where the team filmed the Mexican scenes. Regrettably, the resort is not open for reservations. The private Mediterranean-style residence, sitting on four acres, is above La Piedra State Beach, just west of Malibu, at 4440 Encinal Canyon Road.\n\nFly to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Van Nuys Airport (VNY), approximately 35 miles from Villa Lizton. Alternatively, rent a car or take a taxi.\n\nThe pavilion offers a serene setting for the conversation between Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), with Central Park Lake views framed by refined cast-iron arches and graceful white balustrades. Sunlight filters through the trees as they discuss their friendship, with Miranda seeking forgiveness from Carrie and Carrie urging her to forgive Steve (David Eigenberg).\n\nThe elegant cast iron Ladies' Pavilion in Central Park, initially built in 1871 as a shelter for a trolley stop, is found on the Hernshead peninsula, along the northwest shore of Central Park Lake, near West 75th Street. As a charming illustration of 19th-century American decorative arts, the Ladies Pavilion holds historical significance. When construction began on the Maine Monument in 1912, they relocated the pavilion inside the park.\n\nGet there using public transportation or walk from nearby locations, such as Columbus Circle or the Central Park W/W 75 St bus stop.\n\nIn the final scene, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha (Kim Cattrall), dressed in eye-catching designer ensembles, are sitting around a table in the heart of a stylish restaurant, enjoying their signature Cosmopolitans.\n\nA cozy yellow glow lights up the room as refined music sets the backdrop, evoking an opulence ambiance. The women gather to commemorate Samantha's 50th birthday, with Carrie raising a toast to the next 50 years.\n\nDespite being faithful to the New York locations, there is a bit of deception in the final round of cocktails. Regrettably, you will not conclude your tour with a Cosmopolitan at Samantha's 50th birthday celebration venue.\n\nThe interior scene is not a place to grab a drink; it was created just around the corner at the Diane Von Furstenberg store, 440 West 14th Street. Established in 1972, Diane von Furstenberg has evolved into a global luxury fashion brand renowned for its daring use of color, print, and sensual femininity. The store is still open.\n\nTo get to Diane von Furstenberg Studio Store from Manhattan, take the A/C/B train to 14th Street Station. From there, it is a few minutes walking distance away.\n\nOverall, Sex and the City is an enjoyable movie that fans of the show will appreciate. The actors all do an excellent job of reprising their characters, and Sarah Jessica Parker, in particular, delivers a strong performance as she always does.\n\nThe film has been very successful since its release and has sparked a cultural revolution with its frankness about sex. Additionally, it became one of the most successful comedies ever made and has made an indelible mark on pop culture.\n\nThe fashionable garb of the star-studded cast also deserves mention, alongside the selection of production sites that brought the story to life. Any fan of the show and film will enjoy tracing the steps of the stars to visit the Sex and the City filming location.\n\nOverall, Sex and the City is worth watching if you enjoyed the TV series or want to watch something relatable yet still funny. There are plenty of memorable moments, and the performances from all four leads are standouts."
