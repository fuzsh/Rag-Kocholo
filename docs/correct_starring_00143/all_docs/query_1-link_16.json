        "text": "The last decade or so may have seen Tim Burton and Johnny Deep fall somewhat into caricature and self-parody (and allegedly worse) but back in the mid 1990s the two were hitting their peak and in Ed Wood they found possibly the perfect vehicle for their respective talents.\n\nTelling the story of infamous filmmaker Edward D. Wood Jr. (Depp) as he attempts to break ‘into pictures’, his apparently chance encounter with fallen horror star Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) and the making of his ‘masterpiece,’ Plan 9 From Outer Space, this film could easily both be rather prosaic and, given Wood’s reputation as the worst film director ever, mean spirited — in Burton’s hands though it is neither.\n\nFrom the opening introduction by (the undeniably problematic) Jeffrey Jones as TV psychic of the time, Criswell, and a tracking shot over an intentionally obviously fake model of Hollywood the scene is set for something that exists somewhere between reality and fantasy and, whatever the reality may have been, it feels this is the best location for this story.\n\nThis is added to by the film being shot entirely in black and white which adds to both the period feel and the slightly otherworldliness while also allowing Burton and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky to throw is some great effects around Landau aping the old Universal horrors of the 1930s.\n\nThroughout the production design also treads this line with real locations either recreated or shot in such a way to look like sets with an inescapable feeling of artifice from street scenes to the iconic Brown Derby restaurant all looking just the right side of phoney.\n\nDepp’s performance as Wood also exists in this hinterland and in a way is what leads us into that same place through a kind of almost entirely misplaced and apparently unbreakable optimism.\n\nPrefiguring his outing as Hunter S. Thompson cypher Raoul Duke in Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas it shares similarities with it in several ways, including commenting in one way or another on the so-called ‘American dream’, while being in someways more understated.\n\nAs Wood’s, for the time, problematic sexual peccadilloes are revealed though extra levels to the character come to light making it the equal in performance terms even if the physical transformation isn’t so immediate (though the slight lisp caused by Wood’s dentures is a great touch in creating the character).\n\nThe ensemble cast around Depp’s Wood firmly keep the Hollywood fantasy going with the aforementioned Criswell, Bill Murray in a terrifically typical Murray-esque performance as John ‘Bunny’ Breckinridge and former wrestler George ‘The Animal’ Steele as wrestler turned ‘actor’ Tor Johnson all keeping the fantasy going.\n\nAs the film goes on though chinks in this dream world do begin to appear from the likes of Lisa Marie’s Vampira, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller and any of the studio execs Wood encounters.\n\nThis, I think, is the film’s master stroke and is personified most in the stand out, Oscar winning, performance from Martin Landau as Lugosi.\n\nWith some minimal prosthetics Landau’s Lugosi is the epitome of tragic Hollywood – a faded star, fallen from grace and still clinging onto the role that made his name while harbouring a bitterness that is spectacular.\n\nThe performance from Landau captures this in astonishing fashion bringing the fantasy facade crashing down on several occasions while at other times building it and maintaining it almost more than any other.\n\nDespite happening several times the crashes are always terrifically effective in away that serves to perfectly highlight the delusional world Wood inhabits and, even more so than Depp, Landau really seems to transform in the role and all but steals the film.\n\nIt’s this crashing contrast of reality and fantasy, embodied in Lugosi but seen elsewhere as Wood encounters both the ‘real’ Hollywood system and skid row studios, that helps make the film more than just a novelty love letter to a terrible and undeniably problematic filmmaker.\n\nAlong with this it’s hard to avoid the fact that Burton clearly, whether intentionally or not, has emulated Wood to quite some degree throughout his career, not just with an apparent obsession with rendering (generally far more successfully) less than mainstream ideas in mainstream media, but also but surrounding himself with a cast and crew of eccentric regular players (most of whom are seen here).\n\nWhether this was as obvious at the time I’m unsure, though I suspect it was certainly heading that way, and just adds another wrinkle to what makes Ed Wood so successful and possibly Tim Burton’s most complete film stand alone film."
