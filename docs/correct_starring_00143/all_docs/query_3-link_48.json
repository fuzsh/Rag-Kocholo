        "text": "There’s no place like home for the holidays! The Family Stone put a new spin on a popular Christmas movie trope and proved to be an underrated gem.\n\nThe film, which was released in December 2005, stars Sarah Jessica Parker as an uptight businesswoman who celebrates Christmas with her boyfriend’s eccentric family. Dermot Mulroney plays her beau, who plans to propose, while Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson, Elizabeth Reaser and Tyrone Giordano portray the Stones.\n\nWilson revealed in December 2021 how the cast bonded prior to filming to seem like a realistic family.\n\n“We definitely had rehearsals, which is kind of unusual in this day and age. And then we worked together on — some of us would go to sign language training together. Craig T., I remember doing it with those guys,” the Legally Blonde star exclusively told Us Weekly, referring to the skill the actors picked up to communicate with Giordano’s character, who was deaf. “We did wind up spending more time together and had a couple of nice dinners. It’s very helpful.”\n\nWilson noted that he was in awe of his castmates. “Diane — we all kind of admired her,” he recalled. “And in my mind, here’s Sarah Jessica and she’s sort of this icon of fashion and humor from Sex and the City and then here’s the original icon of fashion and humor — Diane. … And then Rachel McAdams was great. … I just remember those [days] being kind of exciting where you’re going to dinner alone meeting all these people. Some of them that you know and most of them you don’t, so you are a little bit uncomfortable walking in. And then I just remember the idea of leaving and saying like, ‘These people are great! I can’t wait to work with them.’”\n\nScroll through the gallery below to see where the cast of The Family Stone is now:"
