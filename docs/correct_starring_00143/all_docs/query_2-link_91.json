        "text": "Director: Tim Burton\n\nEntertainment grade: A–\n\nHistory grade: B+\n\nEdward D Wood Jr made low-budget Hollywood films in the 1950s, including Jail Bait, Night of the Ghouls and Plan 9 From Outer Space. In 1980, Plan 9 was voted the worst film of all time in the Golden Turkey awards. Wood was posthumously voted worst director.\n\nTalent\n\nIt's 1953, and aspiring film-maker Eddie Wood (Johnny Depp) is thrilled to hear that a producer is filming the story of a famous transsexual. The reason? Wood himself loves wearing women's clothes, particularly angora sweaters. He pitches himself as writing, directing and starring – \"just like Orson Welles did in Citizen Kane\". The result – Glen or Glenda? – fell slightly short of the critical acclaim bestowed upon Welles's movie. The New York Times said \"It isn't quite a camp classic, although it's dreadful enough to have a certain comic appeal\" – one of the kindest mainstream comments Wood ever received.\n\nCelebrity\n\nTo make the film sell, Wood ropes in horror hasbeen Bela Lugosi (played sublimely by Martin Landau). Lugosi is a morphine addict who hasn't worked in four years. In real life, he had worked – the screenplay has somehow forgotten the 1952 classic Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla – but it is true that he was an addict and a mess. The film portrays him as an isolated figure, sitting alone in a suburban bungalow wearing his Dracula cape and clutching his ex-wife's yapping chihuahuas like a pair of loaded pistols. It leaves out his teenaged son Bela George Lugosi, his marriage to his fifth wife Hope Lininger, and his greatest fan, Frank Sinatra. When Lugosi entered rehab, as shown in the film, Sinatra apparently sent him a cheque for $1,000 (and/or a lavish gift hamper, depending on which biography you read) with a note: \"Thank you so much for many, many wonderful hours of entertainment.\"\n\nFinance\n\nWood follows Glen or Glenda? with Bride of the Monster, and discovers Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (George \"The Animal\" Steele, a dead ringer for the real thing). To finance his next production after that, Grave Robbers From Outer Space, he turns to a Southern Baptist church. The Baptists want to make a series of religious movies, but they only have enough money for one. Wood talks them into funding his horror exploitation flick, on the basis they'll make so much profit they can then make as many religious movies as they like. Far-fetched as this may seem, it's all perfectly true.\n\nReligion\n\nIn order to appease his backers, Wood renames the movie Plan 9 From Outer Space – and the entire cast is baptised. A motley collection of freaks and misfits find themselves at a Beverly Hills swimming pool – \"because Brother Tor couldn't fit into the sacred tub\" – grudgingly submitting to full immersion. Again, this is accurate, though in real life only Tor Johnson and Ed Wood were baptised. Johnson, then weighing 412lbs, crashed straight through the preacher's hands and lay there on the bottom of the pool like a massive Swedish rock, while the preacher struggled vainly to heave him out. \"Always the showman, Tor allowed the suspense long enough for the drama to build, then swam away,\" remembered Wood affectionately.\n\nPeople\n\nThough Wood's character here certainly sounds like the man himself in his earnest, didactic memoir, Hollywood Rat Race, the film trims off a few rough edges. Only at the very end does a title card admit Wood was an alcoholic. While the real Wood was remembered fondly by colleagues, he was a boozehound and a womaniser throughout the 1950s. His drinking contributed to his break-up with Dolores Fuller. His impulsive and shortlived marriage to Norma McCarty after Fuller left him is cut entirely. \"It only lasted for days, minutes,\" said Kathy O'Hara, who married Wood three years later – ending, she added, \"as soon as he put on a goddamn nightgown.\"\n\nVerdict\n\nEd Wood is a beguiling portrait of 1950s Hollywood. It may not be exactly how things were, but it's a million times more watchable and more credible than anything Edward D Wood Jr ever made."
