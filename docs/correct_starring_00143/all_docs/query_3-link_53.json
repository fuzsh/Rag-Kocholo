        "text": "Sarah Jessica Parker is to make her West End stage debut opposite her husband, Matthew Broderick, in a comedy about marriage by Neil Simon.\n\nPlaza Suite will open in London in January. It is the West End transfer of a production directed by John Benjamin Hickey in 2022 in New York, where it became one of the highest-grossing play revivals in Broadway history. The London run is at the Savoy theatre, fittingly for a play set in a hotel suite.\n\nBroderick and Parker, who have been married since 1997, play three characters each in the production. In the first act, Visitor from Mamaroneck, they are a couple about to celebrate their anniversary. In the second act, Visitor from Hollywood, Broderick plays a movie producer and Parker is his former high school girlfriend who is now married. The last act, Visitor from Forest Hills, casts them as parents of a terrified bride on her wedding day. All three acts are set in Suite 719 of the Plaza hotel in New York.\n\nReviewing the Broadway production, the Guardian’s Alexis Soloski called Plaza Suite “a referendum on modern marriage”, which “smuggles in bitter underneath the sweet, like a plate of cream puffs laced with cyanide”.\n\nBroderick last appeared in the West End opposite Elizabeth McGovern in Kenneth Lonergan’s play The Starry Messenger in 2019. Parker has had several roles on Broadway including playing the eponymous orphan in the musical Annie in the late 1970s."
