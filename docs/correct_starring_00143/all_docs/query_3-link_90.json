        "text": "I don’t want to relitigate the age-old cat v. dog debate, but given that I have a little black cat sleeping on my leg as I type this, you need not wonder where my loyalties lie. (I’m only catsitting, but I’m a big fan of any creature that will purr while watching Will & Grace with me for hours on end, and dogs just don’t roll like that.) The latest celebrity to back Team Cat, though, has assured me that my allegiances are correct, as pretty much everything she does is inherently on-trend: I’m referring, of course, to Sarah Jessica Parker, who recently adopted Shoe, the cat that her character Carrie Bradshaw fell hard for on the second season of And Just Like That...\n\nI was inherently suspicious of Carrie Bradshaw becoming a cat mom (cats pee on things, including expensive footwear!), but I buy it way more for Parker, whose family already has two cats, Rémy and Smila. Shoe’s real name is Lotus, Parker has decked him out in an adorable collar adorned with a pink bell, and I fully trust that he already knows what not to pee on. Seriously, can you imagine any living creature being so bold as to ruin a pair of the shoes that SJP sells down by the seaport?"
