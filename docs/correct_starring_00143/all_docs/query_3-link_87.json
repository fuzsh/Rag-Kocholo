        "text": "Film 3 of 12 days of Christmas movies\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nHallooooo!\n\nRecommend by a colleague and an Instagram friend, I could not not give the Family Stone a try.\n\n‚ÄúChristmas is not ‚Äúclothing optional‚Äù this year ‚Äì we have a guest.‚Äù ‚Äì Sybil Stone\n\n** spoilers **\n\n2005\n\nDirector: Thomas Bezucha\n\nCast: Rachel McAdams, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Diane Keaton, Claire Danes, etc.\n\nLength: 1h 43min\n\nGenre: Rom com, drama\n\nBen Stone (Dermont Mulroney) brings home his girlfriend, Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), for Christmas to introduce her to his entire family. It is soon obvious that Meredith and the family Stone live by different standards.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the movie. The title never appealed to me, but when the movie was recommended to me by two different people, I gave it a shot, not knowing exactly what the movie was about.\n\n2/3 of the movie is your cheesy rom com. The predictable, over the top, some what annoying part. Meredith for one annoying part, the fact that she ends up with her boyfriends brother and that her (ex)-boyfriend ends up with her sister and that there are no hard feeling from either side. Not realistic at all. But then there is 1/3 of the movie that is emotional and serious. I cried, I laughed, I got annoyed and rolled my eyes. It was a proper rollercoaster for about 1 hour and 43 minutes.\n\nI‚Äôm not the biggest Sarah Jessica Parker fan and I really didn‚Äôt like the character she played in this film. I just couldn‚Äôt relate to her at all. Which shows she actually is a good actor. The annoying ticks Meredith has, her social awkwardness, the things she says‚Ä¶ Jeez, really annoying. So props to S.J. Parker.\n\nAs for the rest of the cast, I was pleasantly surprised. I absolutely love Rachel McAdams! She can‚Äôt do anything wrong in my opinion. And then Diane Keaton and Claire Danes are the big names in the cast line up. Luke Wilson, Dermot Mulroney, Paul Schneider, Craig T. Nelson, Elizabeth Reaser, etc are all very familiar faces if you have seen a rom com in the past 10 years. Although I‚Äôd never picture these stars in one film, they work as a dysfunctional family (but aren‚Äôt all families dysfunctional?)\n\nThrough the film, you can see the characters go through personal changes. Meredith starts the movie in suits and tight knot, but ends in a casual outfit and hair down. Amy (Rachel McAdams) wears very sloppy clothes at the beginning of the film, doesn‚Äôt have a real purpose in life. But then right before the end credits roll, you see her more put together. Those subtle, but noticeable details help a film to be a good film. Love it.\n\nBut yeah, I didn‚Äôt expect anything else other than a light hearted rom com, which it turned out not to be. Well, for that 1/3 anyway. Sybil Stone (Diana Keaton) turnes out to be very ill and can‚Äôt be cured. The type of illness is never addressed nor is there a grand announcement. So you get to see the reactions of all the individual family members as they learn their mother hasn‚Äôt long to live. Heart breaking. I couldn‚Äôt keep my eyes dry.\n\nAnd then 2 minutes into an emotional scene, Meredith does something annoying again, a bit later someone says something really funny (not your standard rom com) to be then followed by something really silly and over the top (your standard rom com). You are on an emotional rollercoaster. That‚Äôs the only way I could describe watching this film.\n\nIt‚Äôs not my favourite Christmas film, but I‚Äôll probably watch it again üôÇ So yeah, a solid 7/10 for me!\n\nThe trailer:\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nxo ‚Äì Sara"
