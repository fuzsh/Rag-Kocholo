        "text": "Before stepping onto the stage for the March 28 opening night performance of Plaza Suite, stars Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker stepped onto the red carpet outside Broadway's Hudson Theatre. Parker, whose name has become synonymous with fashion, did not disappoint.\n\nThe two-time Emmy winner, who stars in the Neil Simon comedy with her husband, two-time Tony winner Broderick, teased her gown on Instagram earlier in the day, saying \"Just wait until you see the front.\"\n\nThe dress was designed by Prabal Gurung, whose own Instagram post described it is as a \"New York Pink Satin empire-waist gown and hand-embroidered crystal, sequins, and bugle beads deco floral sulk tulle overlay.\"\n\n\"To me, nobody epitomizes New York like Sarah Jessica, in every possible way, so it was a great honor,‚Äù said Gurung on another post showing the dress.\n\nPlaza Suite, directed by John Benjamin Hickey, finds Parker and Broderick playing three different twosomes each spending an evening in the famed Plaza Hotel: one couple dealing with difficulties in their marriage on their 24th anniversary, a pair of high-school sweethearts reuniting after many years apart, and the frenzied parents of a jittery bride on her wedding day.\n\nPlaza Suite marks the first time Broderick and Parker have worked together since they appeared as J. Pierrepont Finch and Rosemary Pilkington in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying in 1996.\n\nThe limited engagement runs through June 26."
