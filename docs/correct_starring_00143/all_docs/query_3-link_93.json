        "text": "A man was detained by police Tuesday after apparently interrupting Sarah Jessica Parker as she filmed the new season of And Just Like That…, the Sex and the City sequel, on 10th Avenue.\n\nThe man was led away by two officers to an ambulance, saying repeatedly “you’ve got no right to handcuff me,” and driven off in the back of the vehicle. His status was not immediately known, but filming with Parker quickly resumed on the block, outside and inside BondVet at the corner with W45th Street.\n\nWhy Carrie Bradshaw would be at a vet’s surgery is unclear; Parker herself was described by friend Andy Cohen as “not a dog person,” and her character has not had a pet in SATC or the first season of And Just Like That…, although Charlotte York Goldenblatt, played by Kristin Davis, has a bulldog called Richard Burton and her character in SATC had a King Charles Spaniel called Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nThe second season of the SATC sequel began filming in October and this month HBO released images revealing that Parker’s character Bradshaw would be reunited with former love interest Aidan Shaw, played by John Corbett.\n\nShaw was a furniture designer in season three of SATC, and a very different lover from Mr. Big, played by Chris Noth, whose character was killed off in the opening episode of And Just Like That… Noth was accused of five claims of sexual assault shortly after the show debuted in December 2021, and was edited out of flashback scenes. He continues to deny wrongdoing and has not been charged or sued.\n\nParker was wearing a long herringbone pattern cape coat, a gray cable-knit sweater and wide peach pants as she filmed in Hell’s Kitchen. There was no sign of her co-stars Davis and Cynthia Nixon at the shoot. Both are known to be in the sequel, but there appears to be no prospect that Kim Cattrall will appear. She and Parker have had a very public split, and the Canadian actress has declared herself “done” with Samantha.\n\nShowrunner Michael Patrick King told Variety, “I have no realistic expectation of Kim Cattrall ever appearing again,” although her character remained a presence in the first season of And Just Like That… with the three friends texting her after she was described as having moved to “London.”\n\nThe second season’s filming in Manhattan has, like the first, been followed by paparazzi and fans, meaning that fans know in advance that Carrie will be seen in her Vivienne Westwood wedding dress from the first Sex and the City movie, and that she might be seen with a bag marked with the names of high-profile Democratic candidates from the November 2022 elections (although it could have been well-known Democrat SJP’s own bag.)\n\nThe release date for the new season has yet to be announced, although King suggested to Variety that it would be in the summer of this year."
