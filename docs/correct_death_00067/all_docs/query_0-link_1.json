He is widely regarded as one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time, his Rama and Space Odyssey series being considered classics of the genre. He also wrote the screenplay for the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, a critically-acclaimed piece of modern cinema, based on his novels and directed by Stanley Kubrick.\n\nIn 1948, Clarke sent Irish author Lord Dunsany, one of H. P. Lovecraft's literary inspirations, a copy of The Arkham Sampler containing a segment of The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Dunsany was appreciative of the piece, stating \"I see Lovecraft borrowed my style, & I don't grudge it to him\" [1].\n\nSelected Bibliography[]\n\nShort Fiction[]\n\n\"At the Mountains of Murkiness\" (1940)\n\n[]\n\nArthur C.
