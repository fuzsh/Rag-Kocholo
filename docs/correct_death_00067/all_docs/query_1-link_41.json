        "text": "In the autumn of 2019, Emigre co-ed. ASH Smyth moved from the UK to Sri Lanka. A lot of people (mainly cricket fans) immediately swore that they would visit—until You Know What hit pause on everything. One of these was doctor Tia Iqbal, who had her own reason for wanting to re-connect with the 'pearl of the Indian Ocean' (Sri Lanka, not ASH Smyth).\n\n*\n\nIn the autumn of 1996, I was working as a junior doctor on the Isle of Wight, doing a surgical house job. I'd recently got married, and we'd booked a fortnight in Sri Lanka for our honeymoon.\n\nOne day I was chatting to the guy who delivered the newspapers to the wards (incl. my personal copy of Private Eye, with my name on it in biro), and mentioned the forthcoming holiday. I idly said that I would really love to meet Arthur C. Clarke, as he was one of my heroes.\n\nThe guy told me he was a member of the Isle of Wight Astronomical Society—and said he reckoned he could get me Clarke's address!\n\nSomewhat to my surprise, he pretty soon came up with the goods, which I excitedly scribbled down on the back of some consultants' overtime.\n\nWe flew to Sri Lanka, and did the 7-day circuit of the country that all tourists do, and then checked into a beachside hotel in Negombo for a week. From there, I sent a postcard to Mr Clarke, introducing myself, and no doubt gushing about how much I loved his work. I probably didn't really think that I'd get a response, but I may have mentioned I'd brought several 1960s paperback editions of his novels in my luggage, hoping he might sign them.\n\nAnyway, the soon-to-be Sir Arthur rang me at the hotel! I was so chuffed. He said he'd be very happy to meet in Colombo, but unfortunately was 'down country' at that time, in Yala National Park.\n\nI explained—to my lifelong regret—that we'd be flying out only a few days later. Clarke said what a pity, never mind, and so forth—but I must come and visit Sri Lanka again some time, and if I did, then I should be sure to call, and we would meet.\n\nAlas, I never did—and it has been too late for more than 15 years now. But I still have that little scrap of paper. I came across it just the other day, in fact—and here it is!"
