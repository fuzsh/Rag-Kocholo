        "text": "In 2015, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum Archives acquired the personal papers of famed science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke from his trust and estate in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Over the past year, I completed the task of scanning and digitally ingesting the correspondence series from this collection and now these materials are available to researchers via the Smithsonian Online Virtual Archives. With every box and folder that I have gone through, I have found surprising connections between Clarke and a variety of people and institutions that he became acquainted with throughout his long life. In a previous blog post, I explored his relationship with the major movers and shakers in the realms of literature, entertainment, and science. For this entry, I want to pull back the curtain and show that before his death in 2008, Clarke had contact with the Smithsonian Institution, both directly and indirectly, throughout the years.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Clarke moved to Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) to indulge in his passion for scuba diving. He set up a diving business there with his associate Mike Wilson to support his hobby. Both Clarke and Wilson would explore the sea around Sri Lanka. In 1961, the pair discovered the remnants of a shipwreck in the Great Basses Reef, around the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The wreck contained silver rupees, cannons, and other artifacts. Clarke and Wilson carefully documented their discovery, and in 1964, Clarke used this discovery as the basis for his non-fiction book The Treasure of the Great Reef. However, Clarke and his associate didn’t just limit the word of their shipwreck discovery to the pages of a book. During 1961, both Clarke and Wilson corresponded with the Smithsonian Institution, specifically to Mendel L. Peterson, the Smithsonian’s Head Curator for the Department of Armed Forces History at the National Museum of History and Technology (now the National Museum of American History), in helping to identify their findings from the Great Basses Reef shipwreck."
