        "text": "From covering Apollo Moon landings to probing mysterious phenomena, he became well known to millions of television viewers around the world. His advice was sought – and respected – by space programme managers in both the US and former Soviet Union.\n\nIn the end, however, he wanted to be remembered most as a writer – “one who entertained readers, and, hopefully, stretched their imagination as well,” as he said in his 90th birthday reflections video in December 2007.\n\nHis literary output was formidable. In a career spanning over six decades, he authored 100 books as well as over 200 short stories and numerous essays on a broad range of topics.\n\nAmong his best-selling science fiction novels are Childhood’s End, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Rendezvous with Rama. In total, he wrote 22 science fiction novels, and won all the major awards in this literary genre at one time or another. In 1986, Science Fiction Writers of America named him a ‘Grand Master’ of science fiction.\n\nA short story titled ‘The Sentinel’ was later expanded to make the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, which Clarke co-wrote with director Stanley Kubrick. Half a century later, 2001 is still regarded as the most important science fiction film made.\n\n“\n\nI’ve had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space promoter and science populariser. Of all these, I want to be remembered most as a writer – one who entertained readers, and, hopefully, stretched their imagination as well. ”\n\n”\n\n“\n\nI’ve had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer, space promoter and science populariser. Of all these, I want to be remembered most as a writer – one who entertained readers, and, hopefully, stretched their imagination as well. ”\n\n”\n\nThe influence of his writing has been far and wide, and been documented only anecdotally. For example, one of his short stories (‘Dial F for Frankenstein’) inspired British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee to invent the World Wide Web.\n\nIn another instance revealed decades later, NASA rocket designer Wernher von Braun had used Clarke’s 1951 book, The Exploration of Space, to convince US President John F Kennedy that Americans could and should go to the Moon.\n\nBest known is “Extra-terrestrial Relays”, a 1945 paper where he was the first to outline the principles of global broadcasting via communication satellites in geostationary orbit. His vision, imagined a dozen years before the Space Age began, became a reality in the 1960s.\n\nClarke never patented the idea of communication satellites, and derived no financial benefits from the multi-billion dollar satellite industry that soon emerged. The geostationary orbit is now called ‘Clarke Orbit’ in his honour.\n\nAnother big idea he kept promoting is the space elevator — a cable anchored to the planet’s surface and extending into space, using which payloads can be launched into orbit costing much less energy than do rockets. Originally conceived by Russians and known to the technical community for decades, it was Clarke’s 1979 novel, The Fountains of Paradise, which popularised the concept to a global audience.\n\n“\n\nI’m sure we would not have had men on the Moon if it had not been for Wells and Verne and the people who wrote about this and made people think about it. I’m rather proud of the fact that I know several astronauts who became astronauts through reading my books. ”\n\n”\n\n“\n\nI’m sure we would not have had men on the Moon if it had not been for Wells and Verne and the people who wrote about this and made people think about it.

He had grown up close to the sea, and later realized that he could find underwater something close to the weightlessness of outer space. He was among the first generation of divers to use the aqua-lung, invented in the mid 1940s, to explore Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and then the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn his 1960 book The Challenge of the Sea and through his association with Wernher von Braun, Clarke showed NASA how weightlessness in space could be simulated underwater. It soon became an integral part of astronaut training.\n\nIt was diving in the tropical seas that first led him to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he settled down in 1956. Through his company Underwater Safaris, he pioneered dive training and underwater tourism in his adopted homeland.\n\nSerendip was one of many ancient names for modern day Sri Lanka – it was used by Arab traders. The English term ‘serendipity’ means a “fortunate happenstance” or “pleasant surprise”. It was coined by English historian Horace Walpole in 1754.\n\nExactly 200 years later, Arthur C Clarke accidentally discovered the land of Serendib while on his way to Australia. “My life has been dominated by three Ss – Space, Serendip, and the Sea” he wrote in 1978. “Space came first, and indeed led to the others in a roundabout but now apparently inevitable route.”\n\nIn fact, Clarke soon became Sri Lanka’s best known foreign resident (while remaining a British citizen). For half a century, he played an active role in the island as a public intellectual and a patron of art, science and higher education.\n\nIn 1998 Queen Elizabeth II honoured him with a Knighthood ‘for services to literature’. The Sri Lankan government presented him the country’s highest civilian honour in 2005. Additionally, Clarke received many honorary doctorates, awards and fellowships from literary, scientific and academic bodies worldwide.\n\nMore uncommon honours also came his way. In 1996, the International Astronomical Union named asteroid No 4923 in his honour. Palaeontologists at the University of Monash, Australia, named a newly discovered dinosaur species as Serendipaceratops arthurcclarkei in 2003.\n\nBorn in Minehead, Somerset, England, on 16 December 1917, Arthur C (Charles) Clarke was the eldest in a family of four children who grew up on a small farm. Their father died when Arthur was 13.\n\nThe young Arthur experimented with discarded telephone and telegraph equipment, built his own telescope, and became an avid reader of science fiction pulp magazines. At 15, he joined the British Interplanetary Society set up in 1933 to promote space exploration, then merely a fantastic idea.\n\nEducated at Huish’s Grammar School, Taunton, he worked briefly in the British civil service and served as a radio instructor in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Afterwards, he earned a first class degree in physics and mathematics from King’s College, London, and became a full time writer in 1950."
