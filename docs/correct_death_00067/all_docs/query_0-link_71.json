The high hills adjoining Limerick are called the Keepe Mountains, from the highest of them.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nBernard DOWD* 1839 - 1890 Chart 1 No. 12\n\nIt has been difficult to find information on Bernard DOWD* because of the convoluted nature of his relationships.\n\n1853 - 1864 The New Zealand Electoral Roll has him as a resident of the Southern Division Auckland New Zealand.\n\nHis first marriage was to Stella BEONE 1849 - his second to Stella GOODMAN. The issue is that they two marriages may have been to the same woman.\n\nWe need to disentangle this strange set of relationships and clarify the actual events and people involved.\n\n1871 August 15 marriage of Bernard DOWD to Stella BEONE at 174 Gertrude street Fitzroy, Melbourne Australia. On the marriage certificate he is stated to be a bachelor and mariner from Dublin in Ireland. He was aged 32 of Church Street, Melbourne. His parents are recorded as Patrick DOWD and Hannah DOWD nee KENNY. Patrick DOWD is stated to be a Medical Officer. Stella BEONE is a spinster of Kentucky, America. Stella was 22 years old and a housekeeper of Church Street Melbourne. Her parents were Theodoer (sic) BEONE and Stella BEONE nee Washington. Theodore BEONE was a Master Mariner. They were married in the Victorian Free Church. Reg No 3497\n\nBoth the names BEONE and WASHINGTON can be found in Kentucky USA.\n\nDanial BEONE is said to be the first settler in Kentucky in the book \" Biographical Memoir of Daniel Beone the First Settler of Kentucky Interspersed With Incidents in the Early Annals of the Country \" by Timothy Flint written in 1837. This seems to be the same person as the Col. Daniel BOON/BOONE. The 1837 copy of the Book uses BEONE in the title while in 2010 edition BOONE is used.\n\nThe interesting thing about all this is the events surrounding his marriages - Bernard DOWD has probably intended to mislead. He signs his name in his earlier marriage and in the later one he uses a cross - as if he cannot write. Upon his second marriage in 1875 he said that he was a bachelor. Were Bernard and Stella trying to hide their/her background? Reading the judgement against Bernard DOWD indicates that the judge did not think Stella was a dependable person.\n\nBoth wives gave different parents so presumably were not the same person. In my research, I could find no evidence of a Sarah GOODMAN prior to her marriage. Stella BEONE, Stella GOODMAN and Sarah GOODMAN are the same age. The articles below show that Bernard may have tried to find a form of formal separation from Stella BEONE.\n\nDid he then \"remarry Stella/Sarah after he was released from gaol?\n\nA further complication was that Bernard DOWD spent 18 months in gaol in 1971-1872 because he stabbed Stella BEONE !\n\nSaturday 18 November 1871 Argus REMAND OF BERNARD DOWD\n\nA case of a husband stabbing his wife in consequence of jealousy came before the City Court yesterday. A labouring man named, Bernard Dowd was accused of stabbing his 'wife and using threatening language towards her landlady, Anne Murray. It appeared that the couple had only been recently married, but that the husband had been away for some weeks, and on returning thought he had reason to believe that his wife had been unfaithful to him. On Thursday evening he went to the house of Murray, at which his wife was stopping, and with a large open pocket knife in his hand, threatened to stab anyone who attempted to leave, and declared ; that some one's life must be sacrificed. He also threatened his wife's life, and his hands were seized while the wife made an attempt to run out, He got one arm loose, however, and stabbed at her as she passed, inflicting, it was afterwards found, a wound in the stomach, and was locked up on a charge of threatening language, it not being noticed in the disturbance that the woman had been stabbed. Afterwards, she was conveyed to the hospital, where the surgeons stated that she had been severely wounded, and would not be able to leave the hospital for some days. Dowd was remanded for a week.\n\nMonday 18 December 1871 Argus\n\nBernard DOWD, WOUNDING WITH INTENT. The Trail\n\nBernard Dowd, a sailor, about 35 years of age, was charged with having stabbed his wife, Stella Dowd, on November 16th, with intent to do her grievous bodily harm.\n\nThe facts of this case were of a somewhat peculiar character. Some three months or so before the assault was committed, Dowd became acquainted with a servant-girl in a boarding house at which he was stopping. He asked her one day why she did not get married, and she replied that he was the only man she cared to become united to. He, it seems, took her at her word, and they got into a cab, went to a registrar, and were married, after an acquaintance of only a week. Dowd, according to his own statement, was drinking heavily at the time, and was unconscious of what he was about. His wife, however, asserted that he was as sober then as ever she had seen him. At any rate, next day, on learning that he had been unknowingly married, Dowd refused to have anything more to do with his wife. She insisted that he should maintain her, threatening that if he did not, she would appeal to the law. He subsequently wished her to live with him at Sandridge, but she refused to go there, and he was obliged to go to sea, leaving her in a boarding house, kept by a married woman, in Lonsdale Street. On returning from one of his voyages, he was informed that his wife had been on more than one occasion guilty of immoral conduct during his absence, and though this was denied by her, there were, as the judge pointed out in his charge to the jury, circumstances almost sufficient to justify the suspicion. As she still refused to live with him, and denied that she was at all sorry for what she had done, Dowd obtained her signature to a document, purporting to be, a separation between them for'ever. The next evening, however, he crept into the boarding house where she was staying, in by the back way, took off his boots, and suddenly entered the room where she and several of her acquaintances were. He demanded that certain things which he claimed; should be given up to him, but Mrs. Murphy, the landlady, told him there was no property of his in the house and ordered him to leave, at the same time endeavouring to push him out of the room. A man named Jones, who happened to be present, assisted Mrs. Murphy, and a scuffle ensued, in the course of which Mrs. Dowd attempted to escape. As she was passing through the door Dowd stabbed her in the right side, inflicting a wound which would have been very dangerous had it not been that the violence of the blow was diminished by the quantity of clothing his wife was wearing at the time. Dowd's explanation of the affair was, that he was desirous of seeing his wife to get from her some jewellery she had of his and knowing that he would be prevented from seeing her if he went to the front door, he got in the back way, and took out his penknife to cut his bootlaces, in order that he might take off his boots so as to enter the house without giving the alarm. He forgot to close the knife, and in the scuffle that subsequently ensued might have struck his wife, but if he did so it was unintentional.\n\nThe jury found the prisoner \"Guilty,\" and he was sentenced to l8 months' hard labour.\n\nRECEIVI\n\nOLD COURT-HOUSE - SATURDAY, DEC. 16\n\n(Before his Honour Mr. Justice Molesworth.)\n\nMr. C A. Smyth prosecuted for the Crown.\n\nPart of the Lonsdale Street area was the red light district of Melbourne at the time - know for its houses of ill repute.\n\nJustice Molesworth's comments indicate that he did not think that Stella was a dependable person and that Bernard had evidence that was \"almost sufficient to justify the suspicion.\" It is difficult to see this clearly from the present day. You will have to draw your own conclusions.\n\nThere is more to the story - read on.\n\nThe further history concerns the names Stella GOODMAN and Sarah GOODMAN. There are I believe a number of links that, I believe, lead to the conclusion that his wife named Stella GOODMAN* 1849 - and Sarah GOODMAN* are the same person. I also think that Stella BEONE 1849 - is the original name for this person.\n\nThese are -\n\nThe similarity between the names Stella GOODMAN and Sarah GOODMAN.\n\nStella GOODMAN and Sarah GOODMAN were the same age.\n\nThe age gap between their ages and their husband's ages as were very similar.\n\nBoth husbands were born in 1839.\n\nBoth woman were said to be born in Melbourne.\n\n\"Both\" DOWD families lived in Carlton.\n\nThe marriage of Stella GOODMAN* 1849 - and Bernard DOWD* occurred on 11 of January 1875 Reg No.1190. The marriage (only reported on the Birth Certificate of Bernard Thomas DOWD) between Sarah GOODMAN* and Bernard DOWD* was on the same day and month - 11 of January - only on a different year -1871 the year he married Stella BEONE.\n\nI could find no official record of a marriage between Sarah GOODMAN* and Bernard DOWD*.\n\nBernard DOWD* signed his marriage Certificate to Stella GOODMAN* with a cross so someone else must have entered the part concerning his history. I think that he was asked where he was from and answered Auckland which is were he was from but it is not where he was born.\n\nThe children of Bernard DOWD* included many names that are also found in the New Zealand branch of the family.\n\nFor example - Hannah, John, Charles and Thomas\n\nA possible snippet of counter evidence may lay in the fact that one of the children carried Edward as a second name. This is the name given on her marriage certificate of Stella GOODMAN'S* father Edward GOODMAN*.\n\nLet us look at Bernard DOWD* from this perspective.\n\n1839 birth on May 19 and baptism on May 24 of Bernard DOWD* in St Paul's Arran Quay, (Roman Catholic) Co Dublin, From the Church Baptism Records. Record 222 form 1839.\n\nOne record has his parents as Patrick DOWD* and Francis KENNY*. though it is clear from his birth record that his parents names were Patrick DOWD* 1808-1873 and Hannah KENNY* . The name Frances only has to become Hannah.\n\nThere is also record of birth for a Bernard DOWD 1839 Co. Dublin – from “Obbie” on http://www.british-genealogy.com/forums/member.php/33731-obbie - probably the same person.\n\n1839 Birth of Bernard DOWD* in Dublin, Ireland (on the birth certificate of B T DOWD , also see the 1847 passenger list of the MINERVA in Auckland)\n\n1847 July 1 Emigration to Auckland, New Zealand on the MINERVA from Gravesend, England to Auckland.

After staying in Hobart for some time, Mr and Mrs Smith came to Victoria. At this time Melbourne was not in existence.” It seems that he died in the 1840s in Victoria possibly in an “asylum” near Brunswick of a paralytic stroke. Agnes lived with her son in the Shepparton area, looked after Mrs Lee in Cobram when that lady was a child and went to live in the Benevolent Asylum when her son died in 1884. Then went back to Shepparton and later returned to live in the Benevolent Asylum in 1892 until her death. The full story is in the newspaper articles below.\n\nNote: The word “asylum” in those days did not have the same connotations we put to the word today.\n\n1833. When about 100 years old Agnes stated that she left Greenock in 1833 for Tasmania in the ship Eldon (Lord Eldon), the name of the captain being McAlpine, and her brother and his family were fellow passengers.\n\nThe voyage seems to have actually arrived in 1834. Here is the record\n\nArrival: ship Eldon 1834 March 6\n\n203 tons\n\nMaster: McAlpine\n\nOrigin: Greenock Left 23 October 1833 Destination: Hobart Town\n\nBackground: 23 passengers, 17 passengers for Sydney, cargo goods SH: 17/3/1834\n\nhttp://www.blaxland.com/ozships/\n\nSource: Kate Beadle\n\n“I guess if there were 23 passengers and 17 went on to Sydney that would leave six for Hobart. Robert, his wife Agnes Ferguson and their two daughters, plus Agnes and her husband James Anderson. Or maybe James was already dead and it was Agnes and her son John Anderson. I noticed that the reference to the death of John Anderson mentions his father as being James not John so maybe the marriage in 1832 is another couple. I did note in the past that is seemed to be a rather long voyage as they left 23 Oct 1833; it is interesting to see why it took so long. It would seem very likely that this is the voyage that Agnes refers to. I know for sure that Robert came with two daughters who were born in Glasgow, the last on 18 Nov 1832, so the voyage can have been no earlier than that.” – From: Kate Beadle\n\nThe voyage took longer than usual as the ship got lost! – see the recollections of Agnes MANN below.\n\nAgnes married Isaac Smith in 1834 so the person with her on the ELDON was most likely her son John ANDERSON.\n\nThis would place her with settlers who arrived in the very early 1830s.\n\n“Indigenous” Australians were the first settlers followed approximately 40,000 years later by Europeans. Many Indigenous people were killed by Europeans or died of introduced disease as the Europeans wrested possession of Australia from Indigenous tribes.\n\nTasmanian History: From site- cultureandrecreation.gov.au\n\nVan Diemen’s Land\n\nThe first British settlement on the island was made at Risdon in 1803 when Lieutenant John Bowen landed with about 50 settlers, crew, soldiers and convicts. The site was abandoned and in 1804 Lieutenant David Collins established a settlement at Hobart in February 1804. This group included 3 female convicts and Mr and Mrs Birt, free settlers.\n\nVictorian History: From site- cultureandrecreation.gov.au\n\nIn 1851 Victoria (Port Phillip District) separated from New South Wales. The first attempt at settlement was made in 1803 by Lieutenant David Collins but the harsh conditions forced him to move on to Tasmania where he eventually settled Hobart in February 1804. It was not until the Henty brothers in Portland Bay in 1834, and John Batman settled on the site of Melbourne, that the Port Phillip District was officially sanctioned (1837). The first immigrant ships arrived at Port Phillip in 1839.\n\nChild:\n\nc 1834. Birth of John ANDERSON*(1/10) in Glasgow, Scotland\n\n1898. November 2. Death of Agnes MANN* (Smith) at the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, Agnes Smith, was thought to be one of the oldest colonists, and opened\n\nthe first Wesleyan Sunday School in Brunswick.\n\nFrom the death certificate of Agnes Smith it states her age\n\nas 116 years and daughter of John MANN and Agnes\n\nPatterson. See below for the full story.\n\nAgnes MANN’S* Extraordinary Life!\n\nThe Melbourne Argus\n\nSaturday December 6, 1884\n\nTHE OLDEST COLONIST\n\nTo the editor of the Argus\n\nSir, the colony now has something to tell of quite surprising for a settlement that is celebrating on our Jubilee Exhibition. The end of the first half century only. We have a colonist amongst us a century and two years old. The Melbourne Benevolent Asylum among its applicants today, has an old lady of that age and honoured the application, and the institution is admitting her as an inmate. There were many other applicants whom it was heart-breaking to deny admission to, but there was but one vacancy for females, and one bearing the burden of 102 years was unanimously held, entitled to the vacant place.\n\nAs I have no doubt that she will excite much interest with the public, I may mention that this Mrs Agnes Smith is an intelligent and superior looking woman, wearing no spectacles, and having good hearing faculty. There is that, however, in the much furrowed face that speaks of great age, but there is nothing of senility about her. To the questions put by the chairman of the committee as to some old colonist, her answers were clear and satisfactory, dating back to nearly 50 years. She described herself as a native of Glasgow, the daughter of a solicitor, long time a widow, and arriving here with one son who has since died. It is easy to read her endorsement made on her application paper, that this relict of the past century, whose youthful days were also of Bonaparte and Wellington, was suffering only from “old age and debility.” Now that Great Britain is so jubilant over Sir Moses Monteflore’s completed 100 years, we, of Victoria may be, in sporting language, proud of beating that record in this case of our oldest colonist.\n\n(Agnes must have applied to enter the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum in 1884 when her son died. It seems it did not suit her at that young age. Agnes left and re-entered in 1892 as she grew older)\n\nThe Melbourne Argus\n\nFriday February 26, 1892.\n\nA REMARKABLE CENTENARIAN\n\nMrs Agnes Smith, a widow who claims that she will be 109 years of age on Tuesday next, was a few days ago admitted into the Benevolent Asylum. Her maiden name was MANN, and she was born in Glasgow, in which city, she avers, her father occupied a prominent position. His office was in the gaol, and he kept a couple of clerks. She avers that she left Greenock in 1833 for Tasmania in the ship Eldon (Lord Eldon), the name of the captain being McAlpin, and her brother and his family were fellow passengers. Those were not the days of steamships, so that under fairly favourable circumstances, the voyage would have been a long one, but the captain had the misfortune to mistake his course, and it was not until six months after the voyage had been commenced that the vessel arrived at its destination.\n\nThe party lived at Hobart, and whilst there Miss MANN* was married to a farmer named Smith, and who she alleges, was the first white farmer in the colony, she herself was the first white woman. Her brother was subsequently murdered in Hobart by his own servant. After staying in Hobart for some time, Mr and Mrs Smith came to Victoria. At this time of course, Melbourne was not in existence. The presence of the newcomers did not meet with the approval of the blacks, so hostile being their attitude, that, according to Mrs Smith they contemplating burning her and her husband and child (a son). A long time passed and many white people come to the colony, she herself being the first white woman. Mrs Smith conceived the idea of getting a school and commenced on a very unpretentious scale, having only one scholar, this being a half caste girl. The state of affairs for a considerable time in the colony must have been far from comfortable, but when the police came into the country, the blacks became quieter. The aborigines had not always lived on the most amicable terms between themselves. On one occasion Mrs Smith saw about 400 of them. There had been a great fight between two parties, one of them being from Geelong and the Geelong party proved the victors. She once had an unpleasant experience, being attacked by five natives and violently seized by the throat. Twice she raised the cry of “Murder” and this fortunately was heard by a Mr Thompson, who in consequence of the alarm, put spurs to his horse and rode to the rescue, the animal when he arrived was covered in blood. The blacks made off, and though a reward of £200 was offered for their capture, they were never brought to justice. Mr Smith purchased 12 acres of land. In addition to farming, he sold wood, a load which could fetch 2/6d a load and Mrs Smith would cut up to two loads a day. Mr Smith died a good many years ago, his death taking place in a lunatic asylum after a paralytic stroke. His widow sold her interest in the farm, and subsequently she and her son went to the diggings, but if they had visions of great fortunes, they were not destined to see them realised. On the contrary, they quickly lost all the money they possessed, which amounted to £200. Later on however the son prospered. The latter married and dwelt at Shepparton, his mother living with him and assisting to bring up his family until his death, which occurred between nine and ten years ago. After this Mrs Smith lives at Dr Singleton’s remaining there for some years.\n\nSubsequently she was admitted into the Benevolent Asylum. This institution she quitted in order to go and live with friends at Shepparton, but now as already indicated, she has again become an inmate of the Benevolent Asylum. Notwithstanding her great age she retains her faculties. She is capable of holding quite a long conservation, and is by no means confined to a bed or even her ward. She is able to walk around the garden of the institution without assistance, but finds it necessary to stop for a rest now and again. As for sight she can write a letter and thread a needle without glasses. Indeed she asserts that she cannot use glasses now. Mrs Smith is not the only member of the family who has lived to a centenarian, for she states that her father’s mother reached the age of 105.\n\nThe Melbourne Argus,\n\nThursday November 3, 1898\n\nDEATH OF A VERY OLD WOMAN\n\nA claimant to 116 years.\n\nA very old woman, probably the oldest in Australia, died at the Benevolent Asylum yesterday, where she has been an inmate, off and on since December 4, 1884. She was Mrs Agnes Smith, who claimed to be 116 years old, though, when she was interviewed some years ago by a representative of the Argus, the statements she made was so ridiculous and confused as to render her claim open to grave doubt. Her knowledge of life in the early days of the colony was romantic. Nevertheless, if not quite 116 years old, Mrs Smith must have attained a very great age, for there still living in Cobram, on the Murray, a Mrs Lee, who in her infancy by Mrs Smith. Mrs Lee states that she has frequently heard by relatives refer to the great age of Mrs Smith and avers that they stated she was an old grey haired women at the time she acted as the nurse.\n\nMrs Smith arrived in Australia with her husband in 1830 and is said to be the first white woman who undertook the task of educating and Christianising (sic) the aborigines.\n\nHer husband died 50 years ago, and subsequently one of her sons was murdered in the bush.\n\nMrs Smith’s father was a Glasgow solicitor, named John MANN, who left a family of 21, the youngest of whom was 74 at the time Mrs Smith first entered the asylum.\n\n(From Kate Beadle - The story of the 21 children may be a bit overstated unless there were many daughters. James Corkindale MANN’s death notice states he was the second eldest son, meaning I guess that my Robert was the eldest. Perhaps John MANN didn’t marry until he was in his thirties.)\n\nThe Melbourne Argus\n\nTuesday November 8, 1898\n\nCLAIMANT TO 116 YEARS\n\nLetter to the Argus\n\nSir, I note in your issue of today the death of Mrs Agnes Smith, who claimed to be 116 years of age. Seeing you express doubt of her getting to great age as claimed, some of your readers may be interested to learn the result of enquiries made by me 11 years ago when Mrs Smith was an inmate of my home in Brunswick. I traced out her brother, who was then living in Hobart, a retired bailiff and he ridiculed the idea of her then being 105 years of age. Proving from various family circumstances that she would at that time be more than 90 years, if as much, assuming the brother’s statement being correct. It would make her 101 or 102 at time of death, an age justified by many statements made by her when cross-questioned by me. That Mrs Smith was of great age possibly 100, their need be little doubt, but her memory was often at fault.\n\nYours etc. A.

Her knowledge of life in the early days of the colony was romantic. Nevertheless, if not quite one hundred and sixteen years old, Mrs Smith must have attained a very great age, for there is still living in Cobram, on the Murray, a Mrs Lee, who was nursed in her infancy, sixty years ago, by Mrs Smith. Mrs Lee states that she was frequently heard her relatives refer to the great age of Mrs Smith, and avers that they stated that she was an old grey haired women at the time she acted as the nurse.\n\nMrs Smith arrived in Australia with her husband in 1830, and is said to be the first white women who undertook the thankless task of educating and Christianising the aborigines.

Birth of John DOWD 1847- 1924 either in Manchester, England in 1847 or at sea in the SS MINERVA on the way to New Zealand.\n\nThere was famine in Ireland at this time.\n\n1848 November 7 Birth of Thomas DOWD 1848 – 1913 in Howick, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nA Thomas DOWD, seaman, from New Zealand served on the USS AUGUSTA in the American Civil War 1861 - 1863.\n\nOur Thomas DOWD would have been too young.\n\nSee Chart 38 for this family and their descendants.\n\nPatrtick DOWD* and Hannah KENNY* and their family migrated with the Chelsea Pensioner group to Howick in New Zealand.\n\nThe Settlement at Howick\n\nHowick was the largest of the fencible settlements. ‘Fencible’ comes from the word ‘defencible’, meaning ‘capable of defence’. These soldier-settlements, called the Royal New Zealand Fencible Corps, had served in the wars for Britain in the 1830s & 1840s & had retired on a pension (English military pensioners – “Chelsea Pensioners”)\n\nThey were offered a new life in New Zealand, a free passage with their families, & a cottage with an acre of land to become theirs after a seven year term, in return for certain military duties including compulsory Sunday church parade. Patrick DOWD was with the group but possibly not a soldier-settler/pensioner as he was only 42 years old.\n\nPatrick’s history and the New Zealand O'Dowds\n\nThe New Zealand branch of the O'DOWDS (and DOWDS), are descended from Patrick O'DOWD and Anna (nee: Kenny). Patrick O'DOWD was born in Easky, Sligo in Ireland in 1805. He enlisted into the 97th Regiment of Foot (The Earl of Ulster's - also known a the \"Celestials\" due to the colour of their flashes on their uniforms) in 1824, aged 16 (note that the Chelsea Pensioner’ records have Patrick being born in 1808). He was a Private and served 16 years in the British Army, including 11 years with the Regiment in Ceylon. In November 1832, the regiment's cricket team played the Colombo Cricket Club at the Rifle Green in Colombo, in the first recorded cricket match in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Upon his retirement from the British Army he was living in Manchester with his wife Anna and 4 children. He enlisted into The Royal New Zealand Fencibles] (from the word defencible) and sailed for New Zealand from Gravesend, with his family aboard the \"SS Minerva.\n\n1847 Record of arrival in New Zealand\n\n1847 October 8 The SS MINERVA, barque, 691 tons, which left Gravesend 1 July 1847, arrived in Auckland, 8 October 1847.\n\nThe ship was one of three carrying the Fencibles, 2nd Detachment under the command of Capt Charles HM Smith, 55th Regt. and included 80 Fencibles, 67 wives and 145 children.\n\nThe Minerva was anchored in Auckland harbour at the same time as the 'Ramillies' and 'Sir Robert Sale'.\n\nThe Fencibles from the Minerva mainly settled the Howick area, in Auckland New Zealand, during the early period of colonisation of Auckland.\n\nPassengers on the Minerva\n\nDowd, Patrick 1805 SLG IRE - 1875 Auckland\n\nDowd, Anna (Kenny) (This is Hannah KENNY*)\n\nDowd, son 1837 (This I believe is Bernard DOWD*)\n\nDowd, Sarah 1841\n\nDowd, Charles 1843\n\nDowd, John 1847”\n\n1848 November 7 Birth of Thomas DOWD 1848 – 1913 in Howick, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nSee: John DOWD 1847- 1924\n\nThe New Zealand Jury list has Patrick DOWD as a resident of the Auckland, New Ulster area in 1848.\n\nThere are about 180 families living in New Zealand, mainly in the Auckland region with the surname O'Dowd or Dowd. Craig Dowd the well known All Black is one of these descendants.\n\nFrom - http://en.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/793408\n\n1866 October 10 John DOWD married Mary Margaret PEARCE who was born on the 5th of October 1847, one of the five children of Patrick PEARCE , born 1801 and Mary Ann ALLEN born 1813. Patrick PEARCE was a Chelsea Pensioner with a rank of Colour Sargent. His wife, Mary Ann ALLEN was most likely the daughter of a serving soldier as she was born at Brampton Barracks.\n\nPatrick’s Profession:\n\nBoth brothers in different countries, and without reference to each other, stated on significant documents that he was a surgeon.\n\nHe is described as a surgeon on the marriage certificate for his son, Bernard DOWD* 1839 - 1890 Reg No. 1190.\n\nJohn DOWD’s Golden Wedding notes state that Patrick DOWD was assistant surgeon to Dr Mahon, of Onehunga, who was identified with the old pensioners' settlement in Howick, near Auckland in New Zealand.\n\nPatrick was also a signatory to a letter to the Local Member of Parliament on behalf of the Howick community. It the kind of task requested of a respected, well established member of the community.\n\nContrary evidence:\n\nPatrick DOWD*’S history on Wikipedia states he joined the army aged 16.\n\nPatrick DOWD* was the Informant on Charles DOWD’S death information as father of deceased, labourer, of Howick\n\n1850/98 March 18 A person named Patrick DOWD was employed as orderly at the expense of the Medical Officer during the period Hospital orderlies were disallowed (S. A. S. Bacot, Howick)\n\nThe discrepancy may be due to confusion with another Patrick DOWD present in Auckland. I have found several records of other people named DOWD and of another person(s) named Patrick DOWD living at the same time and in the same area.\n\nSee http://ouraucklandstuff.freeservers.com/CFPatrickPearce.htm\n\n1873 May 23 death of Patrick DOWD* of Provincial Hospital, in Auckland, New Zealand\n\nBurial: Under the Church.
