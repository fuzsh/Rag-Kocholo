Bill became manager of Colonial Loans in 1946 and was later named president, serving in that role until 1991. He made his living doing the work that credit card companies would later claim as their territory: making small loans that allowed people to get married, take vacations, or replace cars or household appliances. He wrote out agreements in longhand and became a friend to customers, dealing with three generations of many families. In August 1942, Bill enlisted in the Army Signal Corps, which later became the Air Force, and he served in the 98th Airborne Squadron, working as a teletype operator in Burma, China and India. Following his honorable discharge in January 1946, Bill worked for Southern Bank and Trust Co. in Richmond before joining Colonial Loans in Fredericksburg. He was a longtime member of the Virginia Consumer Finance Association and served at various times as president, public relations chairman, and membership chairman. He served on the Mary Washington Hospital Board of Trustees, including a stint as treasurer. He also served on the Virginia Financial Services Board and on the board of the Association of Retarded Citizens in Fredericksburg. He was a deacon of the Fredericksburg Presbyterian Church. Bill was born in 1923 in Louisa County, the son of Martin Edward Nuckolls and Myrtle Imogene Nuckolls. His mother died shortly after giving birth, and Bill was raised by his aunt and uncle, John Clayton Whitlock and Bessie Nuckolls Whitlock in Mineral, Virginia. An older brother, Lester H. Nuckols, was killed in World War II. Another brother, Martin Nuckols, and his sister, Margaret Nuckols Nealis, predeceased him.
