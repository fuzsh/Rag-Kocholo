        "text": "By JOHN F. BURNS\n\nOLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Arthur C. Clarke, author of \"3001: The Final Odyssey,\" a chronicle of deep-space travel 1,000 years hence that is pushing its way up best-seller lists, chuckles at the friends who still puzzle over his decision more than 40 years ago to flee the roots of his success as a science fiction writer in England, and briefly in the United States, for a home on this lovely Indian Ocean island.\n\nHe especially savors a remark by Stanley Kubrick, the American film maker with whom he wrote the screenplay for the 1968 movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" From his own place of self-exile, in the Hertfordshire countryside outside London, Kubrick has joked about Clarke, who came here on a scuba-diving trip in 1955 and settled down for good the next year.\n\n\"Arthur Clarke?\" Kubrick is said to have remarked. \"Isn't he a nut who lives in a tree in India someplace?\"\n\nAs he watches CNN trace winter storms across northwestern Europe, Clarke, now 79, retorts, \"I just think of it as 40 English winters escaped.\" He says he has never had reason to doubt what he felt on that first trip, that he had found paradise on this tropical island off India's southeast coast.\n\nBut behind the kibitzing over life in the tropics lies something more serious. A desire to be celebrated in the world left behind may have been crucial to Clarke's return to writing, after years away, to round out the series that began with \"2001,\" which as film and book mesmerized a generation with the hope and dread of deep-space travel.\n\nIn the years when he wasn't writing, Clarke seems to have found that he was like Frank Poole, an astronaut in \"2001\" who was killed by HAL, his spacecraft's renegade computer, when it cut his air hose during a spacewalk and sent him spinning off into space.\n\n\"3001\" begins 1,000 years later as another manned space voyage retrieves a piece of space junk that turns out to be the deep-frozen Poole, who is revived with fourth-millenium technology and goes on to become the story's chief protagonist. And for Clarke, living without a recent best seller turned out to be about as grave as a severed air hose.\n\nMatters might have been different had Clarke been living in London or New York. But his life in Colombo has been relatively anonymous, and by his own admission he is a man with a hunger for applause. Visitors to his home are asked to wait in what he calls his \"Ego Chamber,\" an anteroom to his office festooned with plaques and citations from NASA and other scientific and literary institutions.\n\n\"Fame,\" he says, \"is the ultimate spur.\"\n\nAs if to reassure himself that he still counts in the world, Clarke spends a good part of each day scanning Web sites dedicated to him and his books or spinning off faxes and e-mail to his famous friends and awaiting their replies.\n\nMeetings with visitors are interrupted frequently as he scours his desktop for choice correspondence, as if letters from Neil Armstrong, the Dalai Lama and Tom Hanks (urging him to press forward to the writing of \"4001\") are stronger testament to his talent than the scores of books and articles carrying his name that fill his study's bookshelves.\n\nClarke acknowledges the paradox of having chosen a distant home and then craving approbation from afar. \"I fear I am a failed recluse,\" he says.\n\nBut he also insists that praise, like futurology, be reality-based. Paging through a new fax from an admirer suggesting that \"3001\" has confirmed him as the greatest science fiction writer of all time, he furrows his brow and motions to a sepia-tinged photograph above his desk. \"Forgive me,\" he says, \"but wasn't there a fellow called H.G. Wells?\"\n\nAlready \"3001,\" the fourth novel in the series (the others are \"2010\" and \"2061\"), shows signs of becoming the greatest success of Clarke, who has more than 70 million copies of his novels and short stories in print. The book, No. 5 on the New York Times best-seller list, is selling strongly in Britain and a score of other countries and is being translated into more than a dozen languages.\n\nTo hear Clarke tell it, the main reason he stirred himself to write a new novel more than a decade after \"2061\" was the advance of as much as $2 million from his American publisher, Del Rey/Ballantine Books. The figure, said to have set a new benchmark for science fiction, does not include payment for a movie version that is under discussion, possibly again with Kubrick.\n\n\"They waved a lot of greenbacks at me until my eyes glazed over,\" Clarke says.\n\nHe can certainly find uses for the money. In addition to the house in Colombo, he maintains a holiday villa down the coast, at least nine secretaries and valets here and in England, and a Sri Lankan family that has lived with him for many years, caring for him in ill health and overseeing the scuba-diving company they own with him. Friends say Clarke suffered major financial losses in the 1980s when he left his affairs to an associate in New York.\n\nStill, it is clear from spending time with Clarke that something besides money -- something linked to residing far from the world that nurtured him -- helped him break the promise to stop writing that he made to himself in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter publishing articles and stories almost nonstop since his first science-fiction efforts appeared in his school magazine in his native Dorset in the early 1930s, Clarke had come to see writing as a form of imprisonment. \"When you're writing, you're not living, and I wanted to live,\" he says.\n\nClark's health had also deteriorated as a result of the polio he contracted in Sri Lanka in the 1960s. For several years, he has been unable to walk without help, and his labored breathing can cause him to move rapidly to the private quarters of his home for bursts of oxygen.\n\nThough he makes light of his condition -- \"I'm 80 percent operational in water, only 10 percent on land\" -- he acknowledges that writing 10 to 12 hours a day, his usual routine when he has a book to finish, strains the limits of his energy. After roughing out a draft of \"3001,\" he completed the 263-page book in 20 days of crash writing in the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo last June.\n\nBut neither money nor fame would have helped, had Clarke run dry of new ideas, and \"3001\" follows soundly in the Clarke tradition. As well as being one of the century's most prolific science-fiction writers, he has prided himself on being perhaps the best-grounded scientifically, with a background that goes back to his work as a radar pioneer in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Few writers in the genre, not even Wells, could claim his extraordinary record in foreseeing future technologies.\n\nJust one of his many ideas, a worldwide communications network based on satellites orbiting Earth, envisioned in a 1945 article in Wireless World, is already a reality, relaying telecommunications -- including CNN broadcasts -- to tens of millions of people who 10 or 20 years ago may not have had television. He has had fun poking some of the world's media magnates in the ribs. \"You owe me 10 percent of your gross,\" he told Ted Turner, CNN's founder, when the men met for the first time.\n\nOther Clarke ideas, like the talking, reasoning computer, HAL, which took on human characteristics in \"2001\" killed four of five astronauts on a Jupiter mission in an attempt to avoid being shut down, remain in the realm of science fiction. But experts in artificial intelligence say computers with some of HAL's faculties could be a reality during the first half of the 21st century.\n\nBill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, has said that his own vision of the potential of computers was inspired when he saw \"2001\" as a boy.\n\nWith \"3001,\" Clarke has stretched his imagination yet again. The novel features \"braincaps,\" helmetlike devices tailor-made for individuals that are attached to units the size of computer diskettes that can download all the knowledge acquired in the history of humankind.\n\nThe population on earth has been reduced to a billion, about a fifth of the current population, with the rest living in four huge towers that rise 20,000 miles from the equator into outer space, eliminating the need for earth-launched spacecraft.\n\nHousework and other routine domestic tasks are performed by tiny robots called \"microts.\" Humans no longer eat meat, referred to as \"corpse food,\" because of a mad cow-like contamination of all food animals that caused a shift to synthetic nourishment. Every human carries a personal ID in microchips embedded in each hand, and a new, limitless energy source, clean and virtually free, has emerged from a scientific breakthrough into something called the Quantum Vacuum.\n\nPerhaps most controversially, religions of all kinds have fallen under a strict taboo, with the citizenry looking back on the religious beliefs and practices of earlier ages as products of ignorance that caused untold strife and bloodshed. But the concept of a God, known by the Latin word Deus, survives, a legacy of man's continuing wonder at the universe.\n\nIn this, Clarke is giving vent to one of the few things that seem to ruffle his equable nature. \"Religion is a byproduct of fear,\" he says. \"For much of human history, it may have been a necessary evil, but why was it more evil than necessary? Isn't killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity?\"\n\nThe world of \"3001\" also introduces, through creatures Poole encounters on Europa, an ice-bound planet of Jupiter, what Clarke believes will be the most extraordinary development in human history, one he believes may come much sooner than the fourth millenium: the discovery of other intelligent forms of life. Radio beams transmitted from Earth have traveled at least 50 billion light years into space, he said, raising the possibility that other intelligent beings could already be alert to our existence.\n\nClarke calls \"3001\" his last hurrah, but hearing him talk, it is easy to imagine that he is already reviewing his vow to close his writing days with finality. At moments, it is even possible to imagine that he may be rehearsing the opening passage of another novel, one that could top anything he has written."
