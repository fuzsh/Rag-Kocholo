Berlin (West) lost its postwar insularity and Berlin (East) its status as capital of the German Democratic Republic as they fused into a center of inﬂuence in the middle of Europe. The New Berlin’s reputation as a global city has risen consistently since the end of the Cold War and the concomitant shift of relations of power. Now one of the pillars of the European Union, the German capital faces its challenges with a diverse—and some argue inconsistent—set of policies and approaches. In the current political context, Berlin stands as a symbol for the perception of Germany as Europe’s status-quo power that in the wake of Brexit will increasingly attract ﬁnancial and human capital and expand its presence on the global stage. From the postwar years onward, narratives, images, and metaphors forefronting opportunity and novelty have painted Berlin as an economic and avant-garde playground. Provocative monikers such as “urban frontier” imply adventure, danger, advantage to be gained in the overcoming of adversity, and a paucity of inhabitants relative to abundant resources. Deploying postcolonial critique more frequently brought to bear on earlier histories and Southern geographies, Christine Hentschel illuminates this phenomenon today. She quotes an “activist for creative newcomers” to highlight his way of seeing a working-class neighborhood of Berlin: “Neukölln’s charm is that it is raw and rough. Like a raw diamond. One can still jump around, can realize one’s dreams. . . . There is the space and you can still occupy it.”1 Such wide putatively open spaces beg for exploitation and promise blooming landscapes of opportunity for the enterprising. Of course, as contributors to the invaluable anthology The Berlin Reader show in their analyses, this frontier is not void of inhabitants, but full of resistance. Importantly, the urban frontier concept, which expanded in the 1960s into a core element of city planning, is market-based and privileges economic growth. In Berlin’s case,\n\n2 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nit comes with a particular twist, because the integration of East and West Berlin uniquely maps a phenomenon that Saskia Sassen has noted in relation to U.S. cities: “[N]eglect and accelerated obsolescence produce vast spaces for rebuilding the center according to the requirements of whatever regime of urban accumulation or pattern of spatial organization of the urban economy prevails at a given time.”2 The “poor but sexy” New Berlin has undergone a rapid process of urban renewal that has signiﬁcantly altered its central neighborhoods and its entire social and cultural fabric. While the effects are felt throughout, the impact of this gentriﬁcation is to date most visible in the central areas. Simultaneously, perceptions of what constitutes the “center” have and are continuously shifting toward quartiers that were once considered peripheral—the former margins of Neukölln, Friedrichshain, and Wedding are now the new hot spots. Gentriﬁcation is also expressed and furthered by the city’s branding and “Imagineering” campaigns that spin Berlin as the city of clubbers, advertising and management consultants, designers, architects, restaurateurs, and contributors to the everexpanding art, music, ﬁlm, and literary scenes. Seen critically, these groups are associated with the plague and opportunity of urban accumulation and touristiﬁcation and belong, in more general terms, to what Richard Florida has infamously termed the “creative class,” behind whose glitzy lifestyle images and practices often lurk economically dubious realities. The de facto economic precarity of many freelancers and startup workers reminds by extension that being truly poor may not truly be sexy. For those endowed with the wealth of their parents’ generation, their appropriation of a typically marginal label garners them cultural capital that compensates for the tangible commodities that they do not produce. Contemporary Berlin is perceived to be a liberated place inhabited by free spirits, a central German outpost where raw urbanity still shines through. It is the meeting place of former dissidents from East and West, underground punks and political activists, conscientious objectors, alternative lifestyle advocates, and bohemians. Its gritty underbelly remains part of its lure and lore. Like the old West Berlin and the Berlin of the 1990s, the New Berlin still holds the reputation of a place that has not cleaned itself up completely and that remains a fertile ground for radical and edgy subcultures and for countless associations and communities that mobilize on glocal levels against the myriad effects brought about by rampant speculation, globalization, and gentriﬁcation. The New Berlin harbors enclaves of political, social, and technological disenchantment and a preference for physical over virtual realities. Increasingly,\n\nIntroduction • 3\n\nartists who ﬂocked to Berlin in search of inspiration, community, and a germane working environment have come to take on activist roles defending community projects and access to affordable work and living spaces against urban development driven by investors, politicians, and “imagineers.” Johannes Novy and Claire Colomb have found an “increasing mobilization of cultural producers in oppositional movements in an era of wholesale instrumentalization of culture and ‘creativity’ in contemporary processes of capitalist urbanization.”3 This volume probes recent developments and their inherent contradictions, including the tensions between Berlin’s creative city identiﬁcation and its urban challenges, multiculturalism and Germanness, historical memories and institutionalized memorialization, slick surfaces of redevelopment and rough underground economies, forward-looking attitudes and nostalgia, and the uncompromising honing of radical edges amid concomitant institutionalization and domestication of squatters, subcultures, and other alternatively capitalized communities and geographies. In examining both the governmental and institutional strategies of shaping the New Berlin and the practices on the ground, this volume offers multifaceted perspectives that seek to intervene in and complicate official narratives and broaden the horizon of scholarly inquiry of cultural, memory, and urban studies. It brings together the expertise of scholars from an array of disciplines who engage their topics from interdisciplinary perspectives. The contributions assembled here offer historicized perspectives on the ways in which participation in urban life and contestation of urban developments since the 1990s are negotiated by those who occupy, experience, and study the city. As Berlin scholars we are keenly aware of our own roles in the material production of the New Berlin, as well as in the production of signifying practices codifying the city as sign, metaphor, text, and symptom. In studying Berlin, many of us have been occupying physically and intellectually the “free” spaces, the “voids” available in the 1990s and the early 2000s and the gentriﬁed spaces of today, thus participating in the very production of the space that we research and critique. As a site of memory and memorialization, Berlin is, as Karen E. Till points out, “haunted with landscapes that simultaneously embody presences and absences, voids and ruins, intentional forgetting and painful remembering.”4 The continuing relevance of these landscapes of memory lies in the questions they raise in the present. In the past twenty years, the “voids” of Berlin have disappeared at an unanticipated rate and speed and with them the “spaces of hope” for alternative urban re-\n\n4 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nstructuring with which these “voids” were invested.5 As Andreas Huyssen remarked, “Since much of central Berlin in the mid-1990s is a gigantic construction site, a hole in the ground, a void, there are indeed ample reasons to emphasize the void rather than to celebrate Berlin’s current state of becoming.”6 Huyssen is here referring to spaces vacated or destroyed in order to build the economic and governmental heart of the New Berlin. Uncritically describing as “voids” sites such as the terrain of the former Wall—the strip of land between the inner and outer walls—or the formerly dilapidated Gründerzeit apartment buildings in East Berlin’s Mitte and Prenzlauerberg risks forgetting their historical and contemporary meanings and the practices that shaped and were shaped in them. The putative emptiness of the “death strip”—in which, moreover, protesters of gentriﬁcation and globalization settled post-1990—and the dilapidated buildings of central city Eastern Berlin—which many citizens, particularly dissenters, called home—testify to the economic and ideological schisms between and within East and West that still have not been overcome. Furthermore, mislabeling economically underleveraged areas as voids can legitimate re-focus on proﬁt maximization. Consider why in the 2000s, a Tacheles at the site of the former Kaufhaus Wertheim with its bomb-damaged roof half-open to the sky is seen so differently from the Gedächtniskirche with its bomb-damaged “hollow tooth” standing open to the sky, although their conditions were both results of aerial assaults. Over the last decades, each of these less-thanfully-intact buildings was an integral part of Berlin’s and the national landscape. Today, the former alternative art and meeting space Tacheles sits barricaded, awaiting redevelopment,7 yet the Gedächtniskirche remains a prominent memorial. The diverging status of these two locations indicates a very different perception of voids, ruins, or “authentic sites”—one that stems primarily from the ideological point of view of the stakeholder. As Huyssen reminds us, human-made voids are created with particular intent and purpose: excavating what had been there in order to create space for the timely, planned, managed, and branded arrival of the New. Topographies understood to be caught in the past become “there and then” frontiers awaiting “here and now” plentitude.8 Already in 1997, Huyssen found much of the hope invested in Berlin’s urban development misplaced. He speculated that “Berlin may be the place to study how this new emphasis on the city as cultural sign, combined with its role as capital and the pressures of large-scale developments, prevents creative alternatives and represents a false start into the twentyﬁrst century. Berlin may be well on the way to squandering a unique\n\nIntroduction • 5\n\nchance.”9 This volume reassesses “the city as cultural sign” by probing the impact of urban development (Ward, Erek and Gantner), marketing and branding strategies (Sark, Kutch), image politics (Ingram, Janzen), imaginary cityscapes (Steckenbiller, Gölz, Schütze), debates of ethnicity and integration (Ülker, Schuster-Craig, Amit), and ideological battles for primacy of historical meaning and interpretation (Eisenhuth and Krause, Pogoda and Traxler, Kranz and Cohen). The contributions examine a wide array of debates, art works, texts, ﬁlms, comics, and practices that reﬂect on the forces that have shaped the New Berlin since the 1990s. Framing their investigation in historical terms, the contributions examine how these developments are impacting perceptions of the city, as well as the experiences and lived practices of its inhabitants today. Along with Henri Lefebvre we assume that all space is social space, a product of complex interpersonal, political, and economic processes. This volume brings together investigations that highlight the interrelation of the modes of production of what Lefebvre refers to as the triad of “perceived—conceived—lived” realms.10 Lefebvre distinguishes between “spatial practice” (the way in which perceived space and daily urban reality intersect), “representations of space” (space as conceived by urban planners, social engineers, and strategists asserting scientiﬁc knowledge, governmental and professional authority), and “representational space” (the lived spaces of inhabitants and of artists, writers, and philosophers who describe, imagine, and represent it).11 The differentiation between perceptions, conceptualizations, and representations of the lived city usefully reminds us of the “centrality of embodied experience to the production, reproduction and contestation of urban space.”12 “Space considered in isolation is an empty abstraction,” because space is produced through physical, mental, and social ﬁelds that interact in a dialectical fashion.13 In examining the functions of various urban spaces and experiences, including subcultures (Ingram, Sark); alternative spaces and cultures (Amit, Ward); monuments, historic sites, and cultural memory (Eisenhuth and Krause, Pogoda and Traxler, Erek and Gantner, Kranz and Cohen); festivals (Janzen); and artistic expressions (Schuster-Craig, Kutch, Janzen, Steckenbiller, Gölz, Schütze), the contributions to this volume reﬂect on a wide array of material, mental, and everyday practices that constitute and construct the social space of Berlin. Resonant, too, for thinking through the constructions of Berlin, is Michel de Certeau’s differentiation between the notions of strategy and tactics. Linked to institutions, governments, corporations, and organizations, strategies aim at creating and maintaining regulations that support hegemonic power structures. Perhaps more loosely applied, strategies,\n\n6 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nin the context of our volume, refer to policies that attempt to construct and regulate the “city as sign,” and several contributions examine aspects of how these strategies are forged and deployed (Ward, Eisenhuth and Krause, Pogoda and Traxler, Erek and Gantner, Ülker, Janzen). In contrast, tactics are created and deployed by users and consumers—literally and ﬁguratively by those walking the streets. Tactics evade strict boundaries and may poach, oppose, undermine, and interfere with the order and structures established by the strategic exercise of power. Several contributions here examine tactics used to disrupt strategies and to contest dominant concepts, planning activities, perceptions, representations, and images (Sark, Ingram, Kutch, Schuster-Craig, Steckenbiller, Amit, Janzen, Kranz and Cohen). In reﬂecting on recent transformation in historical perspective, the contributions highlight that as the “voids” disappear, the material traces of Berlin’s history turn into contested territory. Berlin as “palimpsest of different times and histories”14 implies forgetting, ﬁlling, rewriting, and reshaping of memory and remembrance. As history is appropriated, revised, managed, and showcased, certain historical sites become monuments and certain historical events are memorialized, while others are abandoned. In contesting “forgetting,” appropriation, and economically and politically motivated erasures of historical and cultural memory, this volume presents a complex, multifaceted view of Berlin, a montage—to speak in Huyssen’s terms—and an affirmation of the “necessarily palimpsestic texture of urban space.”15 In choosing “cultural topographies” as a title to this volume, we want to buttress our emphasis on the connection between spatial production and historical memory. In using the plural rather than the singular, we indicate our commitment not only to plurality and the illumination of the heterogeneous character of the present but also to the continuing scrutiny of Berlin’s storied history as it manifests physically. The chapters of this book delineate an uneven and contested territory that is always also a work in progress. Topographies are not mere descriptions of places but refer to the spatial mapping and delineation of features and surface conﬁgurations.16 Drawing on J. Hillis Miller’s concept of topography, this volume is conceived as a multilayered montage “like the transparencies superimposed in palimpsest on a map, each transparency charting some different feature of the landscape beneath … the landscape ‘as such’ is never given, only one or another of the ways to map it.”17 Resonating with Certeau’s “Walking in the City,” this volume maps a layered, fragmentary topography via un- and underexplored\n\nIntroduction • 7\n\npathways, writing the urban text much like the pedestrian in the city whose “intersecting writings compose a manifold story.”18 What is Berlin today? In asking this question, the contributions to this volume seek to understand the multifaceted cultural shifts taking place in contemporary Berlin within the context of its storied history. Berlin today still bears the open wounds and hidden scars of some of the most signiﬁcant historical transformations of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. From Imperial Germany, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, the Cold War, and the fall of the Wall, contemporary Berlin is a metropolis of “ghosts.” A multicultural city with an as-yet comparatively low cost of living, a highly educated workforce, decent economic prospects, and engaged residents, Berlin has considerable potential and the opportunity to create a unique and inclusive urban environment that will foster strong local communities, equity, and civic participation. While the New Berlin promotes itself as a creative center populated by a young, dynamic, cosmopolitan class of globalized citizens from all over the world, its economy is fragile; its debt load and unemployment rates are high. The city’s promotional and branding strategies are driven by urban managers and marketing experts who recognize and value creativity as it relates to the bottom line. In other words, creative endeavors are not thought of as alternatives to “extant market-, consumption- and property-led development strategies, but as low-cost, feel-good complements. Creativity plans do not disrupt these established approaches to urban entrepreneurialism and consumption-oriented place promotion, they extend them.”19 Such reinvention of urban space has entailed the forgetting and deletion of certain marginalized cultural identities in favor of “sexier” urban pleasures: “Current conﬂicts over the right to the city in Berlin, especially those led by new social movements challenging neoliberal urban policies, often mask the endurance of old forms of exclusion as well as the formation of new kinds of dispossession. … [T]here seems to be little reﬂection on the way in which [these movements] have also activated mechanisms of revalorization that have destabilized existing use and led to the continued economic marginalization and displacement of other groups, most notably East Berliners, migrants, and the poor.”20 Cautionary accounts of urban development are all the more relevant and urgent with the New Berlin having become a new home for nearly 80,000 refugees and asylum seekers in 2015 and with more migrants expected to settle or stay temporarily in the city in the next years. Like other urban centers and other parts of Germany and Eu-\n\n8 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nrope, Berlin’s most urgent challenge is not just to provide shelter but to ﬁnd effective ways to integrate the newcomers and sojourners into the economic, political, social, and cultural fabric of the city. Institutions and many private Berliners have mobilized, trying to meet the challenge of welcoming refugees into the fold of urban life by offering language courses and vocational training, and organizing beneﬁts and neighborhood events. Artists, musicians, and writers are founding initiatives to facilitate cultural integration of the new residents, inviting participation in and offering free tickets to cultural events. These initiatives take place amid fervent debates among Germans who doubt or oppose Germany’s official immigration and refugee policies. Angela Merkel’s famous “We can do it!” is often met with skepticism. Some Germans unconvinced by their chancellor’s optimistic message ask how it can be done, while others angrily demand her ouster and the closing of the borders; violence simmers, and right-wing political parties and groups have seen considerable gains in state and local elections. Implicit to questions of “how” to facilitate the settlement of refugees are not only economic concerns but also anxieties about what is perceived to be an unprecedented challenge to German national and cultural identity. The arrival of 140,000 new residents within a two-year period of time puts Berlin’s “culture of welcome” (Willkommenskultur) to the test while setting in motion yet another transformation of a city perpetually in ﬂux. Marike Janzen’s examination, in this volume, of the internationale literaturfestival and Jenny Erpenbeck’s novel Gehen, ging, gegangen (Going, Went, Gone) offers a critical reﬂection on efforts to engage new arrivals to the city and interact with the refugees. Johanna Schuster-Craig’s contribution provides a salient critique of the broader implications of integration debates, arguing for a shift from models of integration to models of participation. This collection addresses some of the most salient issues facing Berlin, offering an impetus for reﬂection, further research, and debate about its present, past, and future in the hope that the newish capital will continue to be built on its resistance potential. Our contributors ask an array of questions, including: What are the social and institutional barriers hindering civic engagement? How do non-German residents navigate Berlin? How does the New Berlin engage the social and political imagination? How is Berlin represented and with which effects? What is distinct about its urban aesthetic and imagery? What role has Berlin to play in the articulation of a contemporary German national and supranational identity? All of them illuminate how particular cultural narratives about the city are deployed for concrete ends.\n\nIntroduction • 9\n\nIn the November 2016 special issue of Seminar on Berlin, we wrote: Cities have long challenged, captivated, and inspired the cultural imagination of their inhabitants and non-inhabitants alike. In contemporary society, urban areas seem to gain importance in every imaginable way and are recognized as privileged sites. … However, these urban narratives of ambition and creation are often undercut by material realities and ethnic, religious, and social tensions and are shot through with a myriad of thwarted aspirations.21\n\nSince our work in that project, Berlin and other German and European cities have been challenged to rethink their positions and aspirations as the doors are being pried open to what some term Fortress Europe. European cities have been experiencing what seem to be unprecedented shifts due to global upheaval and concomitant movement of people. Northern cities in particular function as beacons for better futures. While the magnitude of the current refugee situation in Europe is unprecedented, the changes affecting European cities through economic factors and migration participate in a much larger global pattern that scholars such as Mike Davis have recently historicized. While in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century city centers were occupied by well-off urban dwellers, Davis shows the shift that took place as impoverished workers and peasants gradually took up their “right to the city,”22 which included work, even under poor conditions mightily shaped by global market forces. Often governments did not strengthen infrastructure and opportunities in response to needs of the new arrivals.23 The resultant urban slums in the developing world are part of what today’s migrants reaching the Global North are ﬂeeing; although Northern gatekeepers mostly turn these “economic migrants” away. Meanwhile, a culture of “new urbanism” has been attracting middleand upper-class nationals and internationals back to reconstructed city centers across the globe. Urban renewal promises cities with less crime and grime and more productivity and pleasure through enterprises and tax bases, yet such gentriﬁcation also reconﬁgures the city back to a situation akin that of the early twentieth-century demographics Davis describes. The deep privilege of revitalized city centers is so ubiquitous as to be invisible or expected, so commonplace as to be normative. Yet, few city governments have developed successful policies even for securing affordable housing, and it is more often than not due to the determination of principled protestors and housing activists that cities are stalled in succumbing to the demands of real-estate developers and venture capitalists. Berlin in the 1990s seemed different from these\n\n10 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nold-growth bastions of self-legitimating inequality. Its new arrivals experienced openness and affordability that engendered what seemed to be the creation of new solutions for many a malaise. In this new central European capital with space to grow, many believed themselves to be creating new narratives rather than different expressions of old problems. The chapters in this volume variously touch upon, illuminate, and analyze what is turning out to be in many instances a limited-time offer, a space of utopian Zwischennutzung—take the famous case of Tacheles—that is increasingly becoming or being made unsustainable in the face of global, national, and local pressures. Under the heading “Contesting Gentriﬁcation: Subculture to Mainstream,” we bring together three contributions that examine various ways in which gentriﬁcation is negotiated and contested in contemporary Berlin. In “Cultural History of Post-Wall Berlin: From Utopian Longing to Nostalgia for Babylon,” Katrina Sark articulates shifts in the Zeitgeist of the city from the early 1990s to the present. The investigation treats a broad selection of cultural artifacts such as ﬁlm, ﬁction, and visual arts read in the context of demographic alterations and urbanplanning agendas to identify a nostalgic turn that, Sark argues, differs from Ostalgie and Westalgie. Rather, the nostalgia for Babylon responds to “the systematic gentriﬁcation and rebranding of the city throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the gradual disappearance of its open spaces, and the increasing impossibility of utopian dreams, desires, and longing for alternative modes of existence and creativity in a globalized and reconstructed city.” Sark’s chapter resonates with the examinations of several other contributions, particularly with Lynn Kutch’s treatment of critical antigentriﬁcation comics and the contributions that probe the reconﬁgurations of spaces and historical sites. Sark’s intervention that conceptualizes cultural shifts in Berlin may well map onto and illuminate other urban situations. No individual narrative embodies the underbelly of Berlin society as saliently as the autobiographically inspired story of Christiane F. Hers is the life story unfolding in Berlin’s subcultural milieu, seemingly out of sight and untouched by processes of gentriﬁcation. In “Taking a Walk on the Wild Side: Berlin and Christiane F.’s Second Life,” Susan Ingram examines the second life of this most iconic Berlin subcultural ﬁgure, the drug addict best known for her 1979 autobiographical Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo (We Children of Bahnhof Zoo) and the ﬁlm based on the book. Ingram’s chapter establishes the centrality of Christiane Felscherinow’s life story to Berlin’s current incarnation and the global reach of its urban aesthetic and imaginary. Seeking to understand the\n\nIntroduction • 11\n\nappeal of drug culture within the urban cultural imaginary, Ingram reads Felscherinow’s 2013 follow-up autobiography Mein zweites Leben (My Second Life) together with two other autobiographies from the drug milieu: Sven Marquart’s 2014 Die Nacht ist Leben (The Night Is Life) and Michael W. Clune’s White Out: The Secret Life of Heroin (2013). Felscherinow’s autobiographies, Ingram shows, are central to creating and maintaining the image of Berlin as a “poor but sexy” nightlife capital and as a subcultural space where one may “walk on the wild side.” But they also arguably conﬁrm Christiane F.’s status as an undeterred nonconformist who continues to escape the conﬁnes of strict bourgeois norms and refuses to submit to the dictates of the capitalist marketplace. It is thus that Ingram identiﬁes Felscherinow, the marginalized underground drug addict, as a prototypical Berlinerin. Countering mainstream notions of Bildungsbürgertum (educated bourgeoisie), Lynn Kutch argues against the marginalization of comics as a trivial art form. In the chapter titled “Representations and Interpretations of ‘The New Berlin’ in Contemporary German Comics,” Kutch persuasively demonstrates the pivotal role of comics artists in shaping the creative and sociocritical environment of Berlin. In fact, comics are seeing a revival in Berlin, which hosts an annual comics festival and other events to promote it. Kutch analyzes the visual and textual strategies deployed by comics artists Ulli Lust and Tim Dinter to address urban planning, marketing trends, gentriﬁcation, and other issues of concern to the everyday life of Berliners to show comics’ critical engagement with the city. Berlin comics, Kutch convincingly demonstrates, enrich our understanding of the New Berlin. Comics expose its contradictions and failures, as well as its charm and appeal. By reading the comics in the context of Clare Colomb’s study of Berlin’s urban development and branding and marketing strategies, Kutch shows how the artists challenge its official images as the city of prosperity under the tutelage of marketing experts. Their work points to the shadow side of gentriﬁcation that displaces people through high rent and real-estate prices, destroys neighborhoods and communities, and yields few beneﬁts for average Berliners and even for the very creative class that is supposed to be driving Berlin’s economic growth. Simon Ward’s “Reconﬁguring the Spaces of the ‘Creative Class’ in Contemporary Berlin” heads off the volume’s next section titled “Spaces, Monuments, and the Appropriation of History.” In it, he takes up contemporary art in Berlin as well, considering shifting urban planning politics in relation to artists and a youngish, relatively newly arrived slice of Berlin citizenry, most of whom participate in what is often called the\n\n12 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nNew Economy. Ward builds upon Sharon Zukin’s work on contemporary modes of artistic production that emphasize ways of doing over ways of seeing; through their connection to speciﬁc sites of production and display, such art practices inﬂuence the urban spaces that house them. In Berlin, as in other global cities, artists and artistic practices are thus ambivalently implicated in the enrichment of daily life and in the gentriﬁcation of which Zwischennutzung of abandoned sites for artistic purposes is a part. Ward focuses on several projects meant to facilitate studio space for artists—ID-Studios, BLO-Studios and Funkhaus, showing how these projects have variously negotiated the pressures and possibilities that the market and city government brought to bear. Finally, Ward uses the example of the mixed-use project of Allianz bedrohter Berliner Atelierhäuser (Alliance of Threatened Berlin Studio Spaces—AbBA), which is in turn inspired by a nonproﬁt ExRotaprint, to show how diverse sets of stakeholders mobilize against their impending displacement. Ward sees these projects as models offering the potential of a sustained resistance to the homogenization and ﬂexibilization of the creative class. By advocating for the distinct needs of studio artists, Ward argues, these groups decelerate the process by which transitional artist spaces increase commercial property values only to catch the eyes of real-estate investors. Zwischennutzung—the term denoting the temporary, transitional use of buildings and lots—seems, too, an appropriate way to describe how historical meaning is assigned within the vast memoryscape that deﬁnes contemporary Berlin that is examined in the other contributions in this article grouping. Selective and provisional, memory is made relevant to the task at hand. Stakeholders compete for particular interpretations of German history, contingent perspectives that are temporarily concretized in the use of historical sites and the remembrance, narration, and memorialization of events. Not only are the physical uses of historical sites contested, but the meanings attached to and constructed around them are as well. Stefanie Eisenhuth and Scott E. Krause maintain that the city government has thus far not developed a cohesive strategy on how to exhibit Berlin’s shattered past. Examining the complexities of creating an urban memoryscape in Berlin, the chapter “Negotiating Cold War Legacies: The Discursive Ambiguity of Berlin’s Memory Sites” focuses on three historical sites linked to Cold War memories—Checkpoint Charlie, the former Ministry of State Security, and Tempelhof Field. These historical sites proﬁt from the boom in tourism, rising interest in historical localities, and the longing for historical authenticity. They are urban capital, and as part of the “history industry,” they play a major role in\n\nIntroduction • 13\n\nthe constitution of historical meaning. Eisenhuth and Krause’s chapter sheds light on the political, ideological, and institutional investments that shape these locations and their competitive struggle for funding and recognition. Their analysis shows how the discursive and material construction of memorial and historical sites is shaped by societal, political, and institutional negotiations taking place in the present. They conclude by pointing to the irony that after decades of having been perceived as the most un-German city, the New Berlin has risen to represent the focal point of German history and identity. Like Eisenhuth and Kraus, Sarah Podoga and Rüdiger Traxler touch on the Berlin branding campaigns. Indeed, several contributions in our volume consider this striking and inﬂuential phenomenon. Podoga and Traxler consider the “Be Berlin” campaign and the initiatives of groups such as Berlin Partners in order to understand debates around monumentalization and memorialization in the city. Podoga and Traxler’s “Branding the New Germany: The Brandenburg Gate and a New Kind of German Historical Amnesia” compares the possible meanings and deployments of the Brandenburg Gate and the planned National Freedom and Unity Memorial at the Humboldt Forum. They demonstrate how the Freedom and Unity Memorial may further simplify the vicissitudes of German history by accentuating an unequivocally positive interpretation that would also suggest a relentless march into a slick, shiny future. For them, this type of political myth-building, perhaps common in today’s highly competitive attention economy, moves away from the Habermasian constitutional patriotism that has for decades informed a thoughtful engagement with the past, the present, and consideration of future action. Podoga and Traxler outline the complex cultural meaning of the Brandenburg Gate as a way of arguing for the beneﬁts of employing this historically signiﬁcant monument to represent the freedom and unity of a German people who have important responsibilities in the contemporary world. Ayse N. Erek and Eszter Gantner come to similar conclusions about the simpliﬁcation of the German past in their claim that a persistent focus on the present and the future helps to market the New Berlin. “Disappearing History: Challenges of Imagining Berlin after 1989” uses three case studies: the redevelopment of a former Jewish Girls’ School, the “Be Berlin” campaign, and the promotion of the city as the global capital of contemporary arts. Erek and Gantner show how in each case history is selectively appropriated to increase Berlin’s cultural capital. This practice glosses over complexities and exoticizes otherness to achieve its marketing goals. Both the medialization of the Girls’ School redevel-\n\n14 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nopment and the “Be Berlin” campaigns weight their narratives toward the present and the future, the former by emphasizing novel uses of the site and the latter by articulating what Berlin might be rather than what it has been. To further support their argument about the disappearance of history in the discursive production of Berlin today, Erek and Gantner consider Berlin’s rebirth as an art city, outlining how Berlin has been purposely developed and touted as a global urban gallery on par with New York, at times its urban heritage appropriated with new uses. Such city marketing invested in contemporary artistic production also aims toward the present and the future in lieu of the past. Erek and Gantner explore the ways in which history has been disappearing in the urban imagineering processes of Berlin over the last twenty-ﬁve years and examine what replaces it and repositions this new capital nationally and globally. As do Ward and Johanna Schuster-Craig, Barış Ülker uses the quickly changing Neukölln as an example for the ways in which societal and urban planning narratives are brought to bear upon and reworked by various stakeholders. In the next section, “Reimagining Integration,” Ülker lays out an optimistic history of entrepreneurship and ethnic entrepreneurship with a focus on Berlin politics. “Governing through Ethnic Entrepreneurship” offers a case study of Rojda Jiwan, a Turkish-German immigrant who has built up and runs a successful healthcare business that serves its elderly population primarily born in Turkey in accordance with their speciﬁc cultural needs. Jiwan is also engaged in a variety of related activities to further the economic and social robustness of migrant communities in Berlin and has been variously recognized, for example with Berlin’s integration prize in 2008. In 2010, she was Berlin’s entrepreneur of the year. Ülker argues that, rather than simply adhering to deﬁnitions of ethnic entrepreneurship and to the precise objectives and mandates of the Berlin government’s Neighborhood Management program, this businesswoman has successfully negotiated an iteration of ethnic entrepreneurship that expresses her multifaceted values and aims. Schuster-Craig’s exploration of Neukölln offers a differing perspective. Her work on the gentrifying area of Neukölln unpacks how the notion of “parallel societies” furthers racism in the media, public policy, and the general public. As with the creative classes that Ward in particular discusses, parallel-societies discourses can legitimate policies that privilege the individual inputs of certain actors while neglecting the efforts and aspirations of others. Schuster-Craig examines two very different projects based in Neukölln, a working-class neighborhood character-\n\nIntroduction • 15\n\nized by non-German (im)migrants and hipster transplants. She shows how Anna Faroqhi’s comics/graphic novel Weltreiche erblühten und ﬁelen (Empires Rose and Fell), which was commissioned by Neukölln Cultural Commission and aims to articulate “simple stories” of the quarter’s residents, and “Playing-in-the-Dark,” a series of community conversations about racism curated by Philippa Ebéné and the Werkstatt der Kulturen (atelier of cultures), variously expose racist agendas. “Resisting Integration: Neukölln Artist Responses to Integration Politics” examines the contributions of these projects to the debate sparked by Thilo Sarrazin’s book Deutschland schafft sich ab (“Germany does away with itself”). Pointing out the difficulties of creating a sustained resonance with these community-based projects in a media landscape that is seemingly more partial to the position articulated by Sarrazin, Schuster-Craig probes how publicity functions in heterogeneous societies to further and hamper public discourse on issues of multiculturalism. Hila Amit’s “The Revival of Diasporic Hebrew in Contemporary Berlin” focuses on another conception of alternative community in her examination of the political function of the attempts to revive the Hebrew language in the New Berlin. Leaving open the question whether such a revival is indeed taking place there, she examines the work of Tal Hever-Chybowski, a Hebrew activist and PhD student of history at Humboldt University, and Berlin-based Hebrew author Mati Shemoeluf within the historical context of Zionism and Jewish emigration. Amit explores how Hever-Chybowski and Shemoeluf undermine the connection drawn by Zionist thought between the Hebrew language and the land of Israel. Opposing the Zionist “blood” and “soil” connection, they seek to promote diasporic, nonhegemonic Hebrew as a deterritorialized language and culture functioning and developing outside the conﬁnes of Israeli borders. However, according to Amit, they maintain the Zionists’ utopian aspirations to create a new and different culture. Amit reads this disassociation of Hebrew from the Israeli territory as an attack on the Israeli regime. Its effectiveness remains to be seen. For now, the promotion of Hebrew language and culture in Berlin remains a marginal phenomenon driven not only by a desire to resist but also by passion, grand pronouncements, and a measure of exaggeration. Yet, these reestablishment efforts might also speak to the recent endeavors to incorporate transnational narratives into Berlin’s self-portrayals, showcasing ethnic and cultural diversity in shaping historical and promotional urban narratives. As Eisenhuth and Krause and Podoga and Traxler have shown in their analyses, debates and public events inﬂuence how meanings are\n\n16 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nascribed to the historical sites in which they are held, and, indeed, event culture plays an important role in promoting trans- and international narratives that speak to the self-deﬁnition of contemporary Berlin—as it does increasingly in other cities around the globe as well. In “The Eventiﬁcation of Place: Urban Development and Experience Consumption in Berlin and New York City,” Doreen Jakob traces the recent trend to link urban and economic development policies to the promotion of experiences. Within this experience economy, the production and consumption of products and places is transformed into “theater.”24 Berlin is the stage for a myriad of festivals aimed to attract cosmopolitan visitors. Marike Janzen’s analysis of one of these high-proﬁle events, the internationales literaturfestival berlin (ilb), tests the notion of the ﬂuidity of boundaries that Christiane Steckenbiller thematizes in Emine Sevgi Özdamar’s ﬁction and asks how new non-German residents may truly weave their stories into the master narratives of Germanness. In 2015, the annual ilb—one of the largest and most prestigious literary festivals in Germany—made the refugee condition its theme. It featured readings and discussions on the topic and the publication of a volume of short prose and poetry contemplating the fate of refugees and asylum seekers. Janzen problematizes ilb’s claim to globality in her chapter “Berlin’s International Literature Festival: Globalizing the Bildungsbürger” by scrutinizing ilb’s approach to the theme of the refugee condition and exposing it as a self-interested investment into German Bildung. She investigates whether ilb’s support of German intellectual self-formation indeed productively expands notions of Germanness, posing the question in how far the festival’s explicit and implicit indebtedness to the notion of Bildung and its fusion of education and citizenship leaves room for the non-citizens to represent themselves. The festival, Janzen argues, is an event where a privileged “globalness” is performed in a way that sharply circumscribes and thus contains the refugee voice. Rather than creating an international space for literature, reading, and debate, Janzen concludes, ilb reinforces the German national project of self-affirmation through Bildung. Janzen buttresses her argument with an analysis of Jenny Erpenbeck’s 2015 novel Gehen, ging, gegangen (Going, Went, Gone), which was ﬁrst presented publicly at the festival and which Janzen so ﬁttingly identiﬁes as mirroring ilb’s problematic approach to the theme of refugees and asylum seekers. Erpenbeck’s novel focuses on the encounter of a Berlin Bildungsbürger—a retired professor of literature—with asylum seekers. The story is told from the perspective of the German professor, and while his experience and development in the course of the novel are posited as an\n\nIntroduction • 17\n\naffirmative contrast to the barriers and prejudices imposed on asylum seekers, the novel simultaneously undermines its goal to raise awareness about the plight of refugees. It does so, as Janzen’s analysis shows, by privileging the white male German voice and by ﬁltering the voices of non-citizens through it. This narrative form prevents, Janzen argues, non-citizens from being known and heard and turns the novel—like the ilb—into a self-motivated and self-involved project of Bildung. Thus, although Erpenbeck’s novel does assert the refugee’s agency and right to claim space within Berlin, it ultimately affirms a speciﬁcally German project of Bildung as the appropriate mode for the handling of the refugee crisis, one that, in the case of the novel, is taken on by the Bildungsbürger. Janzen concludes by identifying potential spaces and media through which refugee voices may be heard: ilb’s extra-festival series of events connected to Berlin liest, where citizen and non-citizen Berliners read texts and engage in discussions, and the radio programs such as the “Refugee Radio Network.” These and other initiatives provide hope that the voices of refugees and asylum seekers will be heard and will garner attention. Christiane Steckenbiller explores Berlin as a ﬁctionalized transnational cityscape through her close reading of Özdamar’s ﬁnal installment of the 2006 Istanbul-Berlin-Trilogie, Seltsame Sterne starren zur Erde (2003). In “Transnational Cityscapes: Tracking Turkish-German Hi/ Stories in Postwar Berlin,” part of our ﬁnal grouping titled “Berlin Memoryscapes of the Present,” Steckenbiller argues that Özdamar’s novel compels its reader to understand the New Berlin as a product of over ﬁfty years of migration history. Situated in Berlin, the novel writes across cities, nations, borders, cultures, and time, presenting urban space as a lived and embodied experience to be explored and inhabited through everyday practices. Highlighting the entwinement of spatiality and memory, Steckenbiller draws on critical geography to expose the layers and textures of Berlin’s multifaceted land- and memoryscape shaped by shifting realities and memories that invest city narratives with multiple cultural, political, and symbolic meanings. As Steckenbiller shows, Özdamar’s Seltsame Sterne is indicative of the efforts of a new generation of Germans with migrant backgrounds to inscribe transnational narratives into the German master narrative. The novel also draws attention to Berlin’s legacy as a diverse, cosmopolitan space of transcultural interaction that importantly contests and rewrites accounts of Germanness. Özdamar’s work consistently emphasizes the ﬂuidity of borders and boundaries, illustrating how already in the 1970s both East and West Berlin were deeply transnational and transcultural cityscapes\n\n18 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\nand, Steckenbiller argues, preﬁgure the vibrant and diverse postmigrant culture—expressed also in its theater scene—that is emerging in Berlin today. While people of Turkish heritage have long been integral to West Berlin and the New Berlin, Israeli Jewish (im)migrants are newly shaping the transnational cityscape. Hadas Cohen and Dani Kranz’s and Amit’s ethnographically informed contributions present complementary insights into the Israeli Jewish diaspora. Both highlight how Israeli Jewish emigration contradicts the ideological and political project of Zionism and the Israeli state, marking the emigrant as a traitor while exposing them to various levels of discouragement and reproaches from the Israeli state and society. In “Israeli Jews in the New Berlin: From Shoah Memories to Middle Eastern Encounters,” Cohen and Kranz argue that while Jewish Israeli identity is constructed around memories of the Shoah and while these collective, transgenerational memories shape their initial experience of the New Berlin, it is current Israeli social and geopolitical issues, in particular the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict, that ultimately shape the self-understanding and experiences of the Israeli emigrants. Berlin, Cohen and Kranz conclude from their ﬁeldwork, provides an escape from the constraints and conﬂicts that dominate life in Israel. They ﬁnd that Israeli emigrants stress their dissatisfaction with the intrusion of religion into the private sphere and with the political stalemate surrounding the Middle East conﬂict. For them, Berlin is a place of the present and the future rather than the past. As Cohen and Kranz’s contribution and most others here suggest, temporally palimpsestic layerings imbue Berlin topographies with complex and contested meanings; they may similarly garner the elusive mystique of authenticity. In his investigation of the angelic in Wim Wenders’s classic Der Himmel über Berlin (aka Wings of Desire) (1987) and the vampiric in Dennis Gansel’s more recent We Are the Night (2010), Peter Gölz picks up on the notion of authentic places as glossed by Jennifer Jordan. Jordan points out that such sites are not ontologically authentic; rather, they gain authenticity through their claim to having hosted important events.25 Several of our studies obliquely address memorials and memorialization through such a notion of authenticity; here, Gölz investigates how two ﬁction ﬁlms deploy geographical authenticity for distinct ends. Gölz writes that “the reﬂective, thoughtful, passive angels of the past and the hedonistic, action-driven consumer vampires of the present complement each other. … They depict the city’s history both as a dialogue with a past that is always present and as an unmediated\n\nIntroduction • 19\n\nexistence among (and out of) the ruins of the previous century.” Yet, it would seem that Gansel’s ﬁlm gestures toward erasure and cooptation. Gölz describes how the vampire ﬁlm presents Berlin’s history in a punctuated form that nearly elides the period of the Wall that gives a raison d’être to Wenders’s story of angels. Der Himmel über Berlin invites viewers to engage with Vergangenheitsbewältigung (working through the fascist past) through its extensive, lyrical deployment of overdetermined sites of militarism and war such as the Gedächniskirche (Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church) and the Siegessäule (Victory Column). Gansel’s We Are the Night, in contrast, depicts and seemingly valorizes a self-focused and instrumentalizing vampirization of weighty Berlin histories, celebrating the night-lifestyle that emerged in and upon urban sites that are now beginning to signify proﬁtable accumulation of capital. This more contemporary ﬁlm resonates with what Ingram reads in the autobiographies of Felscherinow, Marquart, and Clune as allegorical alternatives to and individualistic rebellion against the productivity that the new metropolis demands. Complementing the notion of the vampirization of Berlin, Andre Schütze examines the cinematic tradition of the “uncanny Berlin” as inscribed in four recent action ﬁlms/thrillers: Paul Greengrass’s The Bourne Supremacy (2004), the European coproduction Jaume Collet-Serra’s Unknown (2011), Farhan Akhtar’s Indian blockbuster Don II (2011), and Ryoo Seung-wan’s South Korean The Berlin File (2013). In these ﬁlms, the German metropolis no longer holds a peripheral status but is portrayed as an international city with global communication and transportation connectivity. Although the physical Wall has disappeared and faded into memory, for Schütze it reasserts itself and its concomitant history through its very absence. Material absence turns into uncanny presents, and the New Berlin remains haunted by its history of violence and division. It is the stage for the protagonists’ crisis of identity, loss and recovery of memory, ﬂight from and ﬁght with shadowy enemies, and dealings with uncertainty and danger. Past and present are inextricably intertwined. As Schütze shows, the protagonists’ emplacements in and engagements with the city are not driven by rational knowledge or an understanding of Berlin’s history or current status but rather by strong senses of emotional discontent. Against the backdrop of Berlin’s continuing reputation as the world’s historic capital of terror, crime, and struggle for political domination, the ﬁlms, Schütze proposes, utilize the New Berlin not primarily to stage the struggle of the individual in a vast metropolis but to show new post–Cold War struggles in which the in-\n\n20 • Karin Bauer and Jennifer Ruth Hosek\n\ndividual is pitted against anonymous organizations that are no longer connected to the city or to unambiguously identiﬁable economic and ideological interests and political powers. While Berlin’s iterations are in some ways unique, they resonate with global patterns of action and thought that are radically and even violently shaping our world. With this volume we aim to shed light on both the New Berlin’s speciﬁcity and its global resonance today. We share our contributors’ appreciation of the historic and cultural complexity of this city, as well as their unease about certain recent developments foreboding a future of urban growth dominated by market logics. In bringing together a multitude of perspectives and voices, we seek to reﬂect and cultivate the multitude that is Berlin. It is our hope that the critical import of our contributors’ multifaceted and nuanced analyses will reshape our understanding of the intricacies of Berlin’s current status as a global city and initiate debates, while evoking solutions to questions about how to create inclusive, equitable, and just urban communities.\n\nAcknowledgments The editors would like to thank Kathrin Spiller and Elena Kennedy for their professionalism, generosity, and patience in assisting with the preparation of this manuscript.

And Berlin is ﬁlling itself again with image-campaigns that imply new economic energies and well-known promises that communicate only one message: new here, different here. That difference is still under construction. It is still sought daily and sometimes caught. Berlin accomplishes this easily because it reminds us of so much, because it was so much, and has still so much to reveal. –Petra Sorg and Henning Brüns\n\nAs the editors of the short essay and ﬁction compilation Sehnsucht Berlin (Berlin Longing, 2000)1 recognize in their preface, the changes Berlin underwent in the 1990s and 2000s were accompanied by a signiﬁcant amount of projected longing and simultaneously by forward-looking urban and cultural image and identity construction. These two modes of reﬂection and construction deﬁne post-Wall Berlin and much of its cultural production. In this chapter I argue that contemporary Berlin is characterized by what I call “nostalgia for Babylon”—for the pre-gentriﬁed Berlin voids and subcultures of the early 1990s. This nostalgia marks a shift from the established Ostalgie and Westalgie that manifested in literature, memoirs, photography, ﬁlms, and exhibitions of the postWende years. Nostalgia for Babylon is a Berlin-speciﬁc phenomenon\n\n26 • Katrina Sark\n\nthat hinges on utopian desires for creativity, new modes of living, and alternative social and cultural communities, unleashed in the voids of the 1990s by artists, musicians, ﬁlmmakers, and writers who began forging the subcultural scenes and cultural wealth that have transformed contemporary Berlin into a cultural capital. In this volume, Susan Ingram also refers to Berlin as the “de facto (sub)cultural capital of Europe” (quoting Enis Oktay) with a “cultural life beyond the mainstream,” which contributed to its status as a “nightlife destination” and its “subcultural popularity.” I argue that this popularity was forged in the pre-gentriﬁed voids and ruins of the Babylonian Berlin of the 1990s. Nostalgia for Babylon began to manifest itself in art, literature, and ﬁlms produced in Berlin after reuniﬁcation, speciﬁcally after the major (re)construction was complete, and after Klaus Wowereit adopted the creative city agenda and branding campaigns upon his second reelection as mayor in 2008. Nostalgia for Babylon does not simply aim to restore (to use Svetlana Boym’s terminology) or recreate a disappearing past (as Ostalgie and Westalgie had done), but rather to reﬂect on the creative possibilities the spatial and economic voids made possible, as well as their effects on the new, reconstructed, and rebranded Berlin. Nostalgia for Babylon is evident in multiple memoirs, short stories, and essays that look back onto Berlin’s creative scenes of the 1990s, as well as in many post-Wall Berlin documentary ﬁlms, art projects, and photography collections, such as Berlin Wonderland (2014), discussed further by Simon Ward in this volume. My goal in this chapter is to map out a cultural-historical chronology of Berlin’s transformation from a “city of voids” (as Andreas Huyssen calls it) in the aftermath of the Wende, to what Time magazine referred to in November 2009 as “Hip Berlin: Europe’s Capital of Cool,” celebrating its many subcultural scenes and its globally recognized and consumed cultural output. Understanding the ways in which this transformation came about, the various economic, political, and cultural forces at play, as well as the cultural and collective consequences of such rapid and signiﬁcant change manifested through nostalgia and protest allows us to grasp not only the contemporary cultural history of Berlin but also the ways in which we reinvent cities and culture in the “creative economy” of late capitalism. Post-Wall nostalgia is merely one lens through which these transformations can be traced; urban branding and topographical transformations others. But we cannot really grasp the cultural history and cultural meaning of contemporary Berlin without understanding the roots and signiﬁcance of its nostalgic expressions and its collective utopian longing and desires.\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 27\n\nI divide the city’s cultural history into two phases: pre-1999 Berlin Babylon (as ﬁlmmaker Hubertus Siegert called it)2 and post-1999 New Berlin (a name introduced by the Berlin Partner marketing agency for its urban branding campaign shortly before the government move from Bonn to Berlin). As German cultural studies scholars including Barbara Mennel have noted, 1999 marked the year in which nostalgia (in the form of Ostalgie and Westalgie) resurfaced in German culture. I take this argument further, analyzing the ways in which Berlin’s nostalgic turn emerged in response to the systematic gentriﬁcation and rebranding of the city throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the gradual disappearance of its open spaces, and the increasing impossibility of utopian dreams, desires, and longing for alternative modes of existence and creativity in a globalized and reconstructed city. The New Berlin after 1999, while heralded as open, free, and creative by the Berlin Partner, proved to be a less fertile ground for utopian dreams than East and West Berlin, or the Babylonian city of voids of the early 1990s. The examples of Berlin literature, ﬁlm, and contemporary art produced during Berlin’s reconstruction that I bring together came to be regarded as the “Babylonian chorus of competing opinions”3 and demonstrate a vital mix of utopian and nostalgic longing that is at the core of nostalgia for Babylon. This nostalgia emerged as a reaction to Berlin’s waves of urban transformations, in which ongoing gentriﬁcation and city branding feed and sustain a perpetual sense of longing and point to the unmaterialized and unlived utopian desires that erupted after the fall of the Wall. I examine post-Wall Berlin cultural production in relation to key historical events, social and political changes, as well as urban transformations that spurred multiple nostalgic waves. In an attempt to deﬁne and describe the current phenomenon that I understand as nostalgia for Babylon, I look closely at the differences between these nostalgic waves and the collective longing that continues to fuel them. I begin with a cultural-historical overview of post-Wall Berlin, and include my cultural analysis of how these changes were represented in ﬁlms, documentaries, literature, and art, and I cross-reference my analysis with other German cultural scholars who have attempted to understand post-Wall Berlin and its culture. The Babylonian Berlin of the 1990s has been continuously mythologized—as demonstrated by the authors and photographers of Berlin Wonderland: Wild Years Revisited 1990–1996, a volume of testimonies and photographs that accompanied a photo exhibition, edited and curated by Anke Fesel and Chris Keller in 2014, and discussed further in\n\n28 • Katrina Sark\n\nthis volume by Simon Ward in regards to Berlin’s cultural memory, its spaces of Zwischennutzung (transitional use), and the eventual displacement of its artists by the creative economy. In today’s post-reconstructed and post-gentriﬁed city, the voids and open spaces originally occupied by the artistic communities and subcultural scenes have been largely replaced by commercial real estate. As Ward notes in his chapter in this volume, quoting David Harvey (2002), culture and oppositional movements form in “transitional spaces,” of which Berlin had more than plenty in the 1990s, and most of which have now been subsumed by capitalist ventures or remain dormant (as the current slumber state of Tacheles—the former artists’ community mentioned in Karin Bauer and Jennifer Hosek’s introduction). In order to unpack and understand the collective mythologizing attempts that underlie the cultural phenomenon of nostalgia for Babylon, we have to grasp how different Berlin of the early 1990s was from its contemporary reconstruction. The years 1989 to 1999 in Berlin were largely characterized by the removal of the Wall from the city’s core and the creation of vast open spaces and voids in its place, followed by extensive reconstruction projects and economic and demographic shifts in response to the Bundestag’s vote in 1991 to transfer the capital from Bonn to Berlin. This time was accompanied by debates about memory, history, and borders,4 as well as by urban marketing campaigns that aimed to construct a new image for the reuniﬁed city, attract tourism, and generate revenue and investments. After the creation of Berlin Partner, the marketing agency responsible for capital city marketing, and the initial series of events in 1994 around Potsdamer Platz labeled Baustellensommer (summer of construction sites), Berlin’s branding gradually evolved into the elaborate and much-cited campaign series Schaustelle Berlin (exhibition site Berlin) that spanned from 1996 to 2005.5 The ﬁrst ten years after reuniﬁcation were also characterized by massive institutional reorganizations, as the Berlin Senate merged the administration of all cultural institutions (museums, theaters, opera houses, concert halls, galleries, etc.) of the former East and West Berlin. What distinguished representations of Berlin at this time was the iconoclastic, self-ironizing symbol of its construction-crane-ﬁlled skyline. In 1994 construction at Potsdamer Platz began—the symbolic ground zero of post-Wall reconstruction—charged with contentious debates about reappropriations of this space. That same year, ﬁlmmaker Hubertus Siegert began ﬁlming the various construction sites in Mitte for his documentary ﬁlm Berlin Babylon (2001), which shows Berlin as an uninhabitable city of voids and construction sites, with only one reference to its vibrant cultural scenes—the Love Parade. Also in 1994 the German\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 29\n\nFigure 1.1. Palace of the Republic. Permission Katrina Sark.\n\nfederal government canceled the subsidies that made up 30 percent of the city’s budget.6 Along with the mass exodus of many former East and West Berlin7 ers, as well as the increased unemployment throughout the 1990s,8 the city’s income tax revenues dropped, all contributing to the massive debt accumulation and eventually to Mayor Wowereit’s 2003 proclamation of Berlin as “poor but sexy.”9 In her contribution to this volume, Susan Ingram points out that this was also the title of two works on the New Berlin, by Agata Pyzik (a nonﬁction volume) and Geoff Stahl (an edited collection). In 1995 Johannes Gross coined the term “Berlin Republic” to signal the changes that would accompany the government move to Berlin10 and promise a hopeful future based on values of democracy and freedom. Characterized by both spatial and ideological openness, as well as by immense creativity and establishment of subcultural scenes, this period was marked by utopian imaginaries that can be traced in music, art, photography, and ﬁlms produced in Berlin at this time. As Dimitri Hegemann, the founder of Tresor techno club, explained in the documentary ﬁlm Sub Berlin: The Story of Tresor (2009): It was a kind of anarchy that was so favorable for subcultural movements and cultural activists because during that time, in the two years between 1990 and 92/93, the authorities had other problems than closing down illegal clubs. It was paradise!11\n\n30 • Katrina Sark\n\nThis celebratory anarchic spirit of the early 1990s is precisely what some Berliners, including Hegemann (as can be seen in the documentary ﬁlm In Berlin from 2009), have become nostalgic for in the new, gentriﬁed Berlin. The Babylonian practices of largely unregulated mobility, creativity, experimentation, artistic and entrepreneurial appropriation of spaces and voids began to taper off and fragment with the arrival of the New Berlin. The year 1999 marked the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the completion of major construction projects such as the Reichstag, the government quarters, and Potsdamer Platz. It was the year the federal government moved from Bonn to Berlin, and thus the official start of the Berlin Republic in the new capital, made explicit by the city marketing campaign announcing its arrival (“Das neue Berlin ist da!”). In the same year, nostalgia resurfaced in German cultural production—ﬁrst in the form of Ostalgie, as in Thomas Brussig’s short novel Am kürzeren Ende der Sonnenallee (At the Short End of Sun Alley, 1999), followed by Leander Haußmann’s ﬁlmic adaptation that same year, and subsequently by Westalgie, in works such as Florian Illies’s Generation Golf (2000) and Sven Regener’s Herr Lehmann trilogy (2001–8), the ﬁrst part of which was adapted by Leander Haußmann in 2003.12 The works draw extensively on references to lifestyles and products that marked the affluent society of West Germany and the subsidized, leisurely existence of West Berlin in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The proliferation of these popular texts point to the nostalgic undercurrents of reuniﬁed Berlin, characterized by what Linda Shortt identiﬁed as “the dynamics of memory contests.”13 Moreover, two dominant streams become apparent in the course of the two decades after reuniﬁcation in Berlin culture: namely, utopian desires and nostalgic longing. Brad Prager, in an essay on the “Re-emergence of Utopian Longing in German Cinema,” provides a useful summary of the history of utopian desire in German culture and more recently in German ﬁlm. Prager identiﬁes utopian impulses in Tom Tykwer’s Heaven (2002) and in Yüksel Yavuz’s Kleine Freiheit (A Little Bit of Freedom, 2002) as manifested in romantic relationships rather than in landscapes of division and reuniﬁcation.14 This search for utopian ideals in relationships corresponds with David Clarke’s reading of the 1990s post-reuniﬁcation ﬁlms, such as Tom Tykwer’s Run Lola Run (1998) and Wolfgang Becker’s Das Leben ist eine Baustelle (Life Is All You Get, 1997), which he describes as set in the Deleuzian espace quelconque or “anyspace-whatever” of the postmodern, empty, alienating landscape of post-Wall Berlin, where the only possibility of meaning, identity, and belonging can be found in interpersonal connections and relationships.15\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 31\n\nFurthermore, Barbara Mennel demonstrates links between the utopian aspirations of the West Berlin squatting and revolt culture, the subsequent “lack of utopia” in the Berlin Republic, and the nostalgic impulses of post-Wende ﬁlms, such as Was tun, wenns brennt? (What to Do in Case of Fire, 2002) and Herr Lehmann (2003).16 She identiﬁes the “nostalgia for a leftist West German past” in these ﬁlms marked not by the revolt era of 1968 but rather by the “lesser-known, anarchist, and creative alternative scene of West Berlin’s 1980s.”17 This Westalgie is part of what she describes as the “nostalgic turn” in popular cinema,18 which in part emerged as a countermeasure to the numerous literary and cinematic manifestations of Ostalgie, as identiﬁed in Sonnenallee (1999) and Good Bye, Lenin! (2003)—both of which prescribe a union of friendship or romance as the solution to the protagonist’s respective experiences of loss. As the cultural historian Svetlana Boym asserted, “[T]he twentieth century began with a futuristic utopia and ended with nostalgia,”19 noting that utopian and nostalgic longing are indeed closely linked. Thus, Berlin’s nostalgic turn can be seen as having emerged in response to the systematic reconstruction and gentriﬁcation of the city, the gradual disappearance of its open spaces, and the increasing impossibility of utopian dreams, desires, and longing for alternative lifestyles in a more globalized city based on a new “creative economy” (as discussed by Ward and others in this volume). By the second decade after reuniﬁcation, with the arrival of the New Berlin, the most common denominator among all the ﬁlms of the nostalgic turn, such as Good Bye, Lenin! and even popular ﬁlms such as Sommer vorm Balkon (Summer in Berlin, 2005), was an acute sense of longing, which in mainstream cinema is often resolved through interpersonal relationships. Thus, many of the post-reuniﬁcation ﬁlms reveal a gradual shift from collective utopian ideas, previously found in a community or ideology, to a more individual sense of utopia, found in a private union between like-minded individuals, where the idea of utopian possibilities of existence could still be kept alive. I argue that 2009 marked another shift within the nostalgic turn with the emergence of nostalgia for Babylon, as the year marked the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall with an internationally broadcast celebration, titled “Fest der Freiheit” (Festival of Freedom), bringing together state leaders, former East and West Berliners, and a whole generation of Berliners who had come of age with no ﬁrsthand experience of pre-uniﬁed Berlin. Along with numerous exhibitions dedicated to the theme of reuniﬁcation,20 personal testimonies and narratives of how the fall of the Wall shaped people’s lives were collected and\n\n32 • Katrina Sark\n\npresented in the media.21 Many of the German ﬁlms released that year were documentary ﬁlms, including In Berlin, The Invisible Frame (2009), and the commissioned Deutschland 09—a compilation of both ﬁction and nonﬁction short ﬁlms by Germany’s leading ﬁlmmakers. Unlike the feature ﬁlms that focused on interpersonal relationships, many of these documentary ﬁlms featured elements of nostalgia for Babylon with a critique of the reconstruction, gentriﬁcation, and commercialization of urban space. In order to understand what this nostalgia means and how there can even be nostalgia for spatial emptiness and voids (in which multiple creative subcultures emerged in the 1990s), we ﬁrst have to examine the process of transformation of Berlin’s divided Mitte, which had remained culturally uneventful, “wie ein Dornröschenschloss” (as sleeping beauty’s castle), until 1989, as Ulrich Gutmair observed in his memoir Die Ersten Tage von Berlin: Der Sound der Wende (The First Days of Berlin: The Sound of Reuniﬁcation, 2013).22 We also have to look closely at the thwarted hopes and utopian desires of artists and entrepreneurs of the post-Wende pioneer phase in the early 1990s. The ﬁrst few years following the fall of the Wall, from 1990 to about 1994, were a time of seemingly limitless possibility, mobility, and creativity, when “property ownership was unclear and public authorities didn’t yet work properly,”23 which is crucial for understanding both utopian and anarchic impulses and the subsequent nostalgic turn. In his memoir, Gutmair described this time as a “turbulent transition, marked by constant demonstrations, art happenings, and parties,” conﬁrming that in the vacuum between the political systems something was emerging that was close to what the “utopians of the nineteenth century called anarchy, an order that seemed to function almost without authority.”24 Today it may be hard to imagine what the sudden openness and freedom manifested by the fall of the Wall meant for people on either side of the Iron Curtain. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, each of the cities had fostered vibrant underground cultural scenes in music, art, ﬁlm, and fashion, made subversive and avant-garde, radical and rebellious by the opportunities (and subsidies), restrictions and lack of mobility imposed by the Wall. Within the avant-garde scenes of both East and West Berlin, the emerging punk culture expressed the rebellious and anarchic sentiments during the last decades of the Cold War. Marco Wilm’s documentary ﬁlm Comrade Couture: Ein Traum in Erdbeerfolie (Comrade Couture: A Dream in Strawberry Foil, 2009) captured this punkish, anarchic creativity of East Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district of the 1980s, its underground fashion scene, as well as the protagonists’—including photographer Robert Paris, mentioned in Ingram’s contribution to this\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 33\n\nvolume—subsequent nostalgic sentiments and attempts to recapture the past feelings and creativity that have been subdued in the new, gentriﬁed Berlin. Similarly, Ulrich Gutmair, who had moved to West Berlin in October 1989, only a month before the Wall fell, remained haunted by the disappearance not of West Berlin but of the Babylonian landscape of “Brachen” (voids), the Love Parade, and the artists’ community at Tacheles, with the graffiti on its facade asking Berliners “How long is now?”—which for him summed up the spirit of Wende and the city in transition.25 In his memoir, Gutmair laments the disappearance of the Babylonian city that created the “art scene” and the “excessive party culture” (which Susan Ingram discusses further in this volume as “subcultural hedonism”), the fact that the former anarchy has become a marketing ploy to lure tourists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and that the early nineties seem like a dream, reﬂected in the “sound of reuniﬁcation” comprised of breakbeats, house and techno, but also of construction noise.26 These sentiments of loss of a particular subcultural creative freedom that erupted in the empty and abandoned spaces of Berlin’s pre-reconstructed Mitte can be found in numerous memoirs, novels, short ﬁction, art, and documentary ﬁlms produced after 2009. After the initial euphoria of unity subsided, Berlin was not yet a very safe “place to be,” with high unemployment, population mobility, and\n\nFigure 1.2. Tacheles: How Long Is Now? Permission Katrina Sark.\n\n34 • Katrina Sark\n\nurban ruins (akin to that in Detroit over the last two decades, which Peter Gölz discusses in relation to the “ruiniﬁcation” of Berlin after reuniﬁcation in this volume)27; violent outbursts against foreigners in the former East; Eastern European maﬁa mobility; and the drug scene forming around Berlin’s vibrant nightlife (detailed in Ingram’s interpretation of the techno and punk memoirs). This often gloomy and unsafe atmosphere inﬂuenced the mood of many ﬁlms set in post-Wall Berlin, such as Ostkreuz (1991), Das Leben ist eine Baustelle (Life is All You Get), Nachtgestalten (Nightshapes; 1999), and later Knallhart (Tough Enough; 2006) and We Are the Night (Wir sind die Nacht, 2010)—discussed in Gölz’s contribution to this volume. The West Berlin city officials in charge of reunited Berlin sought to cover and ﬁll the empty spaces and abandoned buildings as quickly as possible, creating subsidies for corporate investors and interim-use leases for buildings whose future had not yet been determined. Federal officials in charge were busy establishing institutions such as the Treuhand, responsible for appropriating and selling former GDR industry and manufacturing businesses, while the Berlin Senate was subsidizing investors and selling off real estate in the city center to Daimler, Sony, and other multinational corporations. In this turbulent period, subcultural creative communities also began to emerge, fueled precisely by the temporary lag in regulations of property ownership laws for the empty industrial buildings in the formerly East districts of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, and along the Spree River. (Stefanie Eisenhuth and Scott H. Krause’s chapter examines developments at what is now called the Mediaspree.) In addition to topographical transformations, vibrant nightlife, and avant-garde creativity, the Babylonian Berlin of the 1990s was also marked by migrant cultures, multiculturalism, and linguistic transitions. The Russian-born author Wladimir Kaminer described the ﬁrst few years after the dismantling of the Wall as the “gold rush years” in his autobiographical collection of short stories, Russendisko (2000; Russian Disco), vividly restaged by director Oliver Ziegenbalg in collaboration with Kaminer for the ﬁlm adaptation in 2012.28 Since relocating from Moscow in 1990, Kaminer has been writing about the transformations in post-Wall Berlin and contributing to its diverse music scene with his Russendisko events, having established himself as a Russian DJ before becoming a Berlin author. The social mobility spurred by the fall of the Wall brought not only Russians and Eastern Europeans to Berlin but also West Germans and Western Europeans who contributed to the transformation of reuniﬁed Berlin into the techno capital of the world.\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 35\n\nThe Love Parade, perhaps more than any other cultural movement of the 1990s, symbolized utopian dreams in the reuniﬁed Berlin Babylon. In her autobiography The Beauty of Transgression: A Berlin Memoir (2011), artist, musician, fashion designer, and author Danielle de Picciotto, who was a co-founder of the Love Parade, described the gradual transformation of the gloomy, melancholy, and rebellious West Berlin into the post-reuniﬁcation “party metropolis” during the techno revolution. De Picciotto and her then-partner DJ Motte (Matthias Roeingh), owner and DJ at the well-known club Turbine Rosenheim, traveled to London in 1988 to visit a rave club and came back to Berlin to stage the ﬁrst Love Parade on Kurfürstendamm in West Berlin in the summer of 1989, only a few months before the Wall fell. In the next few years, the techno wave and the Love Parade expanded and captured not only national but global imaginations, and gradually replaced the anarchic punk culture of the 1980s with a colorful and playful style of techno and electro music and fashion culture in the 1990s. De Picciotto described the ﬁrst Love Parade as “true anarchy” that consisted of a “small truck, a record player, and crowds of policemen” which had “managed to traumatize the whole city.”29 She contends that this techno utopia allowed the city to earn “millions thanks to the Love Parade, ﬁnally having something to attract thousands of fun-loving tourists, spending much more money in clubs, bars, hotels, and stores than those who went to see the somber historic landmarks” and also functioned as a cultural platform, allowing artists, DJs, and musicians to “originate projects within the event, promoting the idea that art and music can have a social inﬂuence.”30 But much like the new reconstructed Berlin, the Love Parade, which was originally registered as a political demonstration, soon became commercialized and stripped of its original anarchic spirit of celebrating individuality and freedom. De Picciotto and Motte have moved on to other artistic endeavors. Signiﬁcantly, de Picciotto was featured as one of the protagonists of the documentaries In Berlin and Sub Berlin, while both Kaminer and Motte appear in Mauerpark (2011), speaking out against the systematic gentriﬁcation and urban transformation of the city, which Ward discusses in this volume to be the consequence of capital’s need to “destroy a location’s uniqueness.” As representatives of the Babylonian Berlin, they all comment on the gradual disappearance of Berlin’s voids and the ultimate threat to creative subcultures and artistic communities. Svetlana Boym identiﬁed Berlin between 1989 and 1999 as characterized by “both the euphoria and anxiety of transition,” noting that “at\n\n36 • Katrina Sark\n\nFigure 1.3. Kastanienallee Squat. Permission Katrina Sark.\n\nthat time, East German police no longer had power over the city and West German police had not yet taken control, so Berlin’s abandoned center became a kind of utopian commonwealth of alternative culture with Oranienburger Straße at its core.”31 It was in this mixed atmosphere of endings and beginnings, transitions and dismantling, openness and yet unforeseen future structures that the techno movement and its many artistic and entrepreneurial ventures erupted in the voids, and continue to echo to this day.32 During her visit to Berlin in 1998, Boym noted that “the participants of the parade crisscrossed the former territory of the Wall with happy indifference, as if walking in a weightless cosmic zone, shaking to a subdued Techno beat.”33 It is precisely this “weightless cosmic zone” temporarily occupied and reinvented by the techno movement that later became the object of nostalgia for Babylon. De Picciotto’s account of Berlin’s “Babylonian state of life” in the early 1990s that was about nonconformity and “breaking down boundaries, building new bridges, discovering something untouched, unnamed, unpredictable,” carried out by a group of “ever-changing, multilingual pioneers,” is inextricably linked with the creative scene of West Berlin and is not without hints of Westalgie for the “feelings of community” that existed among the members of the art and music scenes established in the 1980s.34 Throughout the second half of her book, de Picciotto expressed her difficulties adjusting to the increasingly fragmented and\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 37\n\ncommercialized life in the New Berlin and identiﬁed the initial closure of the White Trash Fast Food restaurant and the Tresor nightclub in 2005 and 2006, as well as the subsequent repopulation of Berlin by “hipsters,” as an end of an era.35 Despite her sense of increasing “displacement” and the fear of losing the very values of “liberty of the mind” and artistic expression that have been forged in the experimental years of the early 1990s, she found hope in the uncompromising music of Einstürzende Neubauten (and in her romantic union with band member Alexander Hacke, also a protagonist of In Berlin), which, for her, kept the utopian dream of nonconformity alive in the New Berlin. At the end of the book, she concludes, I had been watching the surface of the city changing and not understood that the truth lies beyond the facade. As long as I stayed close to this character trait, maintaining my sense of integrity and inquisitiveness, the city I had known when I ﬁrst arrived in the 1980s would continue existing as a metaphor, and I could ﬁnd happiness anywhere. I ﬁnally understood that happiness did not require living in a certain city but having a certain state of mind.36\n\nIn her attempt to come to terms with the New Berlin, de Picciotto constructed a metaphor of a “Berlin state of mind” to encapsulate her utopian dreams. She described her transference of utopian ideals from a geographical and temporal location to a metaphorical state of mind, which she linked with nonconformity and individuality. This transference from collective to individual utopian possibilities became especially acute after the completion of the major construction projects at Potsdamer Platz (1998) and the government quarters (1999), the arrival of the New Berlin, and following the years of the ﬁnancial scandal and crisis that lead to the election of Mayor Klaus Wowereit (SPD) in 2001.37 Just as Gutmair, Hegemann, Motte, and other members of the techno movement (and several other protagonists of In Berlin), de Picciotto presents the Babylonian Berlin that has disappeared in the New Berlin with a sense of longing and nostalgia to which most creative people who came to reuniﬁed Berlin in the early 1990s can relate. This disappearance and nostalgia are strongly tied to the urban spaces in Mitte that have been utterly transformed and gentriﬁed, as well as to the gradual fragmentation and displacement of artistic communities and scenes out of the new, gentriﬁed neighborhoods. Another key element of the Babylonian Berlin was its active protest culture; its treatment in sociological and urban studies,38 as well as ﬁlm and literature, also suggest links between utopian and nostalgic long-\n\n38 • Katrina Sark\n\nFigure 1.4. LinienStraße Squat. Permission Katrina Sark.\n\nings. While German feature ﬁlms of the 1990s and early 2000s envision the possibilities of utopian impulses and escapes through romantic relationships, documentary ﬁlms, such as Hito Steyerl’s Die leere Mitte (The Empty Middle, 1998), and short ﬁction, for example Inka Bach’s “Besetzer” (“Squatters,” 1997), recorded the ephemeral and short-lived protests of the young squatters at Potsdamer Platz in June 1990, actively opposing Daimler-Benz’s acquisition and reconstruction of the former death strip. Both Steyerl and Bach were interested in borders, physical and symbolic, as well as in the border crossers from Eastern Europe who made their living at the unlicensed bazaars and souvenir stands in the voids.39 Steyerl’s ﬁlm shows the protests of unemployed German construction workers, who demonstrated (not always peacefully) against Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s employment of low-wage foreign laborers, even in projects as symbolically and economically signiﬁcant as the reconstruction of the Reichstag. Her ﬁlm documents the transformation of Potsdamer Platz from marginality to centrality,40 and the contested claims to these spaces now divided by the less visible walls of class boundaries and the metal fences of capital. In the ﬁnal segment of Steyerl’s ﬁlm, entitled Utopie, the female voiceover narrator informs us that in “June 1990, the squatters announced the founding of a Socialist Republic in the death strip. Afterwards their traces are lost.” The squatters’ utopian vision of a “Free Socialist Republic at Potsdamer Platz,” where people who are\n\nCultural History of Post-Wall Berlin • 39\n\nexpats of both East and West Berlin can come together and live an alternative lifestyle, is juxtaposed and visually superimposed with images of construction of the Infobox (a documentation center for the future design of Potsdamer Platz erected in 1995) at Leipziger Platz. This superimposition signals that the 1990s and early 2000s marked the gradual eradication of the West Berlin squatting culture, which has largely been replaced by the branding culture and the creative economy of the New Berlin. The ﬁlm presents a rather bleak portrait of the Berlin Republic under construction yet ends on a hopeful, perhaps even utopian note, referencing Siegfried Kracauer’s quote narrated over images of holes in the chipped Berlin Wall: “There are always holes in the wall we can slip through and the unexpected can sneak in.” Thus, the ﬁlm ends with the hope that possibilities of escape and change exist in the cracks of established systems of domination. The Wall, itself a former symbol of oppression, is reappropriated by Steyerl as a projection screen of utopian possibilities of freedom and escape. As Brad Prager reminds us, utopian impulses tell us more about the present than about the future,41 and Steyer’s ﬁlm, Bach’s short ﬁction, and the techno memoirs remind us to look for the seeds of these unfulﬁlled desires and collective longing not only in the Babylonian Berlin of the 1990s but also in the post-gentriﬁed New Berlin, where the unlived utopian ideas began to be transformed into nostalgia. Gentriﬁcation became a key factor in the transformation of Berlin Babylon into the New Berlin. In the conclusion of her discussion of Was tun, wenns brennt?, Barbara Mennel refers to the post-Wende social mobility of squatters from the formerly West Berlin neighborhood of Kreuzberg to East Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg: At the happy end, the characters ﬁnd themselves at the new center of Berlin, having left behind Kreuzberg. This move reﬂects part, but not all, of the real story of the generation of squatters from the 1980s. … A great many of those involved in the alternative movement in Berlin left Kreuzberg after uniﬁcation and moved to Prenzlauer Berg in the former East. By bypassing the 1990s, the ﬁlm avoids confronting the role played by the former squatters, who displaced East Berlin working-class residents of Prenzlauer Berg and, through their departure, turned Kreuzberg into a neighborhood of primarily Turkish-Germans, branded by the media and politicians as “a Turkish ghetto.”42\n\nOf course, today Kreuzberg is no longer a “Turkish ghetto,” and Prenzlauer Berg no longer houses West Berlin squatters.
