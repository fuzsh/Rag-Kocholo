        "text": "[Whats happening in the British Empire in 1854?]\n\nHOME CORRESPONDENCE. London, June 3rd, 1854.\n\nSouth Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)Monday 21 August 1854 p 2 Article\n\nHOME CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nLondon. June 3rd. 1854.\n\nThe Fates have again been adverse to our Australian correspondence, and this time it has been the great Peninsular and Oriental Company who have failed in the performance of their contract. The mails of the Great Britain were forwarded via Southampton by the powerful new steamship Simla, which left on the 6th May for Gibraltar, Malta, and Alexandria, with the India, China, and Australian mails, besides a very large and valuable cargo, 300 tons of stores and provisions for the Government, to be landed at Malta for transmission to the fleet in the Black Sea, and specie to the value of about £90,000 sterling. The screw, it appears, was broken by having struck some portion of a floating wreck; and, no spare one being on board at the time, the Simla had to trust entirely to her canvas She was going about eight knots, with a fair wind, when spoken by the Sultan. It is supposed she would make Gibraltar, and there endeavour to repair the damage ; but the delay thus caused will sadly disarrange all the postal service on your side. There is no blame attaching anywhere ; but it is mortifying nevertheless. Although no important legislation has been undertaken since the date of my last epistle, the discussions and divisions in the House have not been without interest. The Ways and Means have been carried through, though not without much debate, and some few useless divisions. Ministers have been subjected to two further defeats on their own adopted measures. One of them the Scottish Education Bill was thrown out at its second reading by a majority of nine against the Government. On Thursday, May 25, the second reading of the Oaths Bill having been moved, Sir F. Thesiger moved its second reading that day six months. He opposed the measure at great length, contending that it would level the last defences of Christianity in the legislature. The Bill was also opposed by Mr.Napier, Mr. Phillimore, Mr. Liddell, Mr. Newdogate, Mr. Whiteside, Mr. Disraeli, and Mr. Muntz. It was supported by Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Miall. and Lord John Russell. The second reading was negatived by a majority of 251 against 247. The Jews are therefore once more rejected by the Legislature from seats in the House. Besides these, Mr. M. Gibson succeeded in carrying a motion, affirming the necessity of some legislation in respect to the stamping of periodical publications; and Sir W. Clay has obtained leave to bring in a Bill for the abolition of Church rates. On Monday, the 29th, on the motion by the Attorney-General for the withdrawal of sundry Bribery Prevention Bills, Mr. Disraeli made a telling speech upon the failures of the Coalition Ministry, which, as he showed, in spite of possessing \"all the talents,\" had during the present session been defeated on three of their most important measures, and had felt compelled to withdraw three others. Lord John Russell and Sir George Grey replied, the former with some acrimony, which brought the leader of the Opposition again on his legs, who made one of his most ingenious and powerful harangues, maintaining his own consistency, the honesty and industry of Lord Derby's Administration, and the rottenness of the present, ending with bitter taunts as to the tenacity with which they, cling to office in spite of repeated defeats and failures. These speeches read well enough ; but to those who were fortunate to hear them delivered they possessed attractions which no printed orations can pretend to. Since the bombardment of Odessa, the combined fleets have confined their operations to the Circassian coast, and \"shelling\" the out works of Sebastopol at a long range, with a view to test the strength of those fortifications preparatory to a future general attack. This is not thought likely to come off until a land force, can be sent to co-operate with the fleets, but of which we expect to hear almost daily. Nicholas makes it appear in the Russian official journals that our ships were compelled to retire from Odessa with great damage ! Amongst other acts of braggadocia we hear that the Governor of Moscow had caused a Te Deum to be sung in honour of the victory gained by the Russians at Odessa. The Russian journals announce that, in virtue of a decision of the Government, the military stores, batteries, and all the other works of defence, destroyed by the division of the combined squadron, shall be reconstructed at the expense of the city of Odessa. Those journals hypocritically add, that the Government of the Czar, in taking that decision, merely acceded to the patriotic demand of the inhabitants of that city. The following sequel to the Odessa affair came off in the early part of last month : On the 12th May, the Tiger, an English steam-frigate, having run aground near Odessa, was attacked by artillery sent from the city, and destroyed after a gallant resistance, and her surviving crew made prisoners and carried into Odessa. The particulars show that Captain Gifford, her commander, had a leg shot off, that a midshipman was killed, having lost both his legs, and that many of the crew were killed and wounded. Since the above, Admiral Dundas sent to demand the release of the captured crew of the Tiger, but without effect ; upon which he sent word to the Governor, that if they were not released within 48 hours, he would lay Odessa in a heap of ruins. Considerable reinforcements have been sent to the Circassian chief Schamyl, both in arms and ammunition, under escort of British and French ships of war. The operations on the Danube, contrary to general expectations, have been of a very unimportant nature. The Russian forces withdrawn from Little Wallachia have remained concentrated in the neighbourhood of Silistria, against which place they have been for some time preparing to act. They have at length regularly invested it, and for many days past we have heard of its siege and bombardment. Hitherto, however, the most furious attacks of the Imperial troops have been met with the determined and obstinate resistance of the Turks, who have always repulsed them with heavy loss. On the 25th May the Russians were manoeuvring to cut off the communication between Varna and Silistria. An English division was to embark at Constantinople for Varna, while the French force was to march on the Balkans. On the 11th May the combined fleets were still cruising before Sebastopol. The Times correspondent at Vienna confirms the fact, already published, of the signature of a Protocol by the representatives of the Four Powers, asserting their determination to maintain the integrity of Turkey. He adds, that Austria and Prussia will now demand the evacuation of the Turkish territory, and that accordingly a note to Russia, sent by the Conference to Berlin for the approval of the Prussian Government, has been duly agreed upon and dispatched by Austria and Prussia, as an ultimatum to Russia. The latter Power will, of course, take its own time to reply, and, perhaps, may attempt a little cajolery ; but the two great German states can hardly allow themselves to be fooled as we have been, and then, if they really be honest, they must declare war. In the Baltic, also, less has been done than the public generally expected; but the main body of the French fleet has only now reached those waters, and Admiral Napier, it was known, would attempt nothing until they had joined him. Besides this, however, it is certain that, though Revel and Riga could offer no sort of effectual resistance to our fleets, yet to attack their strongholds at Sveaborg and Cronstadt, wherein are lying the Russian fleets, some further aid is needed in the shape of gun-boats, and even a land force. The latter is now in preparation in France  indeed, it is said that a portion has already left for the Baltic, for there they do these things much more quietly than in this country. The navigation of the Gulf, of Finland is now open as far as Cronstadt and St Petersburg. Advices from the former place, via Germany, inform us that two American ships which had recently arrived had sailed with cargoes, and two other foreign vessels had entered, making a total of 13 since the opening of the navigation. The merchants were using active efforts to send away as much produce as possible overland, but opinions were greatly divided as to the quantities which the means of transport during the season would allow of being dispatched. From Riga the advices mention that the captain of the Amphion had given notice of a blockade to commence on the 15th May, and that meanwhile large amounts of hemp and flax had been shipped off a circumstance which had increased the recent reaction in the price of hemp in the London market, which was about £10 per ton below what had been demanded a few weeks previously. The boats of the Amphion and another war steamer had entered the Russian harbour of Libau, and cut out eight prizes from the harbour. Each steamer took four vessels in tow, and made for Memel for them. Great consternation prevails at St. Petersburg, in spite of the false reports concerning Odessa, and the most active preparations were being made in that capital to defend it against an enemy a hopeless task, if Cronstadt really be not impregnable, and an unnecessary one if that fortress be as strong as reported. The French expedition of occupancy had arrived at the capital of Greece, but at the last moment the King had given way. Rather than see his country in the possession of a foreign army he consented to dismiss his Ministry, and recall all the officers then with the insurgents, and abandon the cause of Russia. It is to be hoped, however, that we shall not allow ourselves to be fooled by this petty potentate, but keep him in proper order with a man-of-war in his close vicinity. Piracy in the Greek seas has been very prevalent of late. With the view of augmenting that friendly feeling which, in consequence of political relations, is now so agreeably established between this country and France, a number of gentlemen, at the head of whom are Messrs.Stanfield and Maclise, have instituted an annual exhibition of the French school of painting. For the first display the small gallery in Pall-mal opposite the Opera Colonnade, has been selected. The opening of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham is now fixed for the 10th June, when Her Majesty, the Court, the Ministers, the Royal Commissioners of the Great Exhibition, Mayors of chief towns, &c., will be present. The building and grounds are far from being complete, yet they present a magnificent spectacle as now seen. Thirty-five thousand season tickets have been issued to the present date. The Madai  the husband and wife whose persecution in Italy has made so strong a sensationhave now received a provision for life. The committee entrusted with the care of the fund for their benefit have recently purchased an annuity of £63 5s. at the National Debt Office, for which they paid £1.078 1s. 6d. This ia augmented by a sum of £40 in foreign annuities, making their yearly receipts from Christian benevolence upwards of £100. The Bishop of Bath and Wells died on the15th instant, at Brighton, in his seventy second year. Admiral Sir Hyde Parker died at Ham on the 26th inst. Mr. James Jobnstone, for 20 years principal engineer at the Russian Admiralty works at Kolpino on the Neva, has returned to Scotland. When the war broke out, he resigned ; the Emperor offered him the post of engineer-in-chief at Cronstadt, on condition that he would become a Russian subject. Mr. Johnstone refused the offer, and again when it was made without that condition. Last month the French Ambassador gave a Bal Costume of great magnificence, which was rendered still more conspicuous from the fact of its being honoured by the presence of Her Majesty, an occurrence of great rarity, but of sufficient political importance at the present moment. When the Queen and Prince Albert arrived, at 10 o'clock, they found the house brilliantly illuminated, their own initials and that of the Emperor of the French being conspicuous in the blaze; and they alighted under a spacious awning, on a carpeted path. Count Walewski stood to receive them almost at the carriage door ; and, leaning on the Ambassador's arm, preceded by the Secretaries of the Embassy, the Queen entered the house. The decorations and costumes were of the most magnificent description. The Queen danced more than once with Count Walewski, and, after, partaking of an elegant supper, retired between 1 and 2 o'clock. The Great Britain is positively to leave Liverpool on the 10th, with a fresh mail, and most of her former passengers and cargo. The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the week show a considerable decrease. They have comprised but three vessels  two to Adelaide, with an aggregate burden of 976 tons, and one to Port Phillip, of 660 tons. Their total capacity was consequently 1,636 tons. The rates of freight continue very heavy, shipments having latterly been limited. The Highbury has arrived at Penzance, from Adelaide, whence she sailed so far back as December 17th. She brings 16,469 ounces of gold, and has also 170 tons of copper ore on board, consigned to the English and Australian Copper Smelting Company. The Henrietta Sophia has arrived from Adelaide, but brings only 47 ounces of gold, worth about £190. The Circassian has arrived at Swansea, where she is discharging. The Thetis has sailed from Plymouth for Adelaide, with about 250 passengers, of whom a large proportion are Cornish miners. The Nestor, for Portland Bay, has already embarked 120 emigrants at Plymouth, and will sail early next week. The William Prowse is also at Plymouth, embarking free emigrants for Adelaide. Besides the above vessels, the Emigration Commissioners have the following ships under engagement to sail during the present month to your colony : Confiance, Pestonjee Bomanjee, Dingo, and Emigrant. Of these two at least will, it is hoped, carry out a fair proportion of Cornish miners and their families. The probable movements of the Russian fleet in the Pacific have been the subject of farther discussion in some of our papers, but without, I believe, exciting any real apprehension on the part of our Australian firms, who appear to place the fullest reliance on the activity and efficiency of the British and French cruizers in those waters. Although there is still not a little heaviness in our colonial produce market, and a general unwillingness on the part of buyers to touch more than is absolutely needed for immediate wants, it cannot be said that in other respects there are any unfavourable or unhealthy symptoms in the commercial world. The money market necessarily feels the present political state of matters ; but with the improving aspect of German politics, the excellent accounts of the harvest, the sound state of our trade generally, and, lastly, the continued shipments of large quantities of gold from Australia, all tend to place the finances of the country in an improving position. Consols have touched 92, and are now quoted at 91¾, whilst the Paris stocks are equally buoyant. At a meeting of the General Screw Steam Company, recently held, it did not appear that the abandonment of the Cape and Indian line was determined upon, but only suspended pending consideration. The loss entailed by that portion of their undertaking, however, prevented the Directors from declaring any dividend for the past half-year. The Lady Jocelyn takes out a number of your colonists: amongst those most deserving of mention are Mr. J. Taylor and Capt. Hall. In the former tho Colony will gain an accession of a member of society whose worth is well known, but his absence from this side will be felt, where, though quietly, he had never failed to labour on behalf of South Australian interests. Amongst other fruits of his usefulness, I may mention the improved tone and feeling of a certain colonial journal published here. Fortunately for your interests, we have still good men and true\" on this side; and whilst South Australia has such advocates as Captain Bagot and Mr. Waterhouse with us, you need not fear that the colony will be for gotten. Last night Mr. Divett drew from the Under Secretary for the Colonies that nothing would be done with the South Australian Constitution until the Bills from the other colonies had arrived. Looking to the reluctance of Parliament to undertake any but the most pressing legislation, I feel no hesitation in stating that nothing will bs done this year in the way of Australian Constitution-making. You will, therefore, have ample breathing time to discuss the present plan, and to exploit all its errors and weak points. Mr. Wentworth has arrived in London from Sydney, by the overland mail of this week, but we may well doubt if his presence here will in any way expedite colonial matters in the present juncture. The petition from your colony against the intended Constitution is believed to be on its way with the heavy portion of the Southampton mail from India, but which, owing to the Simla's accident, is not looked for earlier than the 12th instant. Whilst on this subject, I may mention that the good folks of Edinburgh have established an Australian Room, where, at certain hours, gentlemen connected with the colonies may assemble and discuss Australian topics. Some thing of this sort is needed in London. A good club for Australians would meet with warm support, for the want of such an establishment is already felt. Amongst other passengers proceeding to your colony by the present opportunity, I may mention a Mr. Robertson, who is in connection with a South Australian Copper Mining Company, and, I have reason to believe, represents the Strathalbyn mining interest. The colonial wool sales, which commenced on the 11th May, have just terminated. The attendance of both the home and foreign trade was unusually good, and the greater part of the offered parcels, found buyers. At one time, the reduction on last sales prices was fully 2d. per lb. ; but this bringing in foreigners, a rally was made, and the closing quotations show within 1d. of last figures. Some of the Adelaide lots were in prime order and sought for, which was not the case with most of the Australian fleeces, those from Victoria being very badly washed and wasty, while much of the Sydney wool was far from clean. The tallow market has lost much of its firmness ; and at the present time Australian beef cannot be called better than 45s. to 55s. 9d. Sheep, 55s. 3d. to 60s. The copper market is extremely quiet, the quotations being £126 to £128 per ton.\n\nGOVERNMENT IMMIGRATION.\n\nSouth Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)Monday 5 November 1855 p 2 Article\n\nGOVERNMENT IMMIGRATION.\n\nAmongst the papers laid on the table of the Legislative Council at the opening of the session was a series of classified tables descriptive of the immigration and emigration of the year 1854. From these returns it appears that in that year the number of persons landed on the shores of South Australia was 8,824, being nearly double the number that arrived in 1853. During the year last mentioned 4,583 Govern- immigrants landed. In 1854 the immigrants were brought in 30 ships ; in 1853 they came in 14 ships. Judging from the number of vessels engaged in this service, the immigrants in 1854 would appear to have had more ship room than those in 1853 ; but, as the tonnage of the ships employed in the last-mentioned year is not given, we are unable to arrive at any certain conclusion. The Immigration Agent says that \"the Land and Emigration Commissioners have used every means in their power to improve the general management of emigrant vessels.\" This remark, however, must apply rather to the choice of ships than to arrangements for maintaining discipline on board. The report further states that whereas during 1853 the average number of deaths in ships was 4 per cent., in 1854 it was only 2½ per cent. It also shows that whilst in 1853 one in 78 of all persons above 14 years of age died on board, in 1854 only one in 155 of similar age died before landing. The speed of vessels conveying emigrants has increased; the average voyage in 1853 requiring within a trifle of 106 days, whilst in 1854 the average only reaches 100 days per ship. Of the 30 ships bringing immigrants in 1854, only three, the Nugget, the James Fernie, and the Dirigo, were over 1000 tons burthen, the largest being the Dirigo, of 1286 tons. The smallest class of ships range from 500 to 600 tons, although one vessel, the Ostrich, of 426 tons, was chartered by the Commissioners. The greatest number of persons embarked in any one vessel was 481, on board the Dirigo; the smallest number being 188, on board the Ostrich. The greatest number of births on the voyage was 13, on board the Royal Charlie ; the smallest number was 1, on board the William Hammond. On board two ships, the Royal Charlie and the Fortune, no death occurred ; the greatest number of deaths on board any one ship being 29, in the John Bunyan. The total of births on the passage during 1854 was 166, of which 82 were males and 84 females. The total of deaths was 228, of which 41 were above 14 years of age, and 187 under. The mortality continues very great at sea amongst young children, as many as 79 having died under one year old during 1854. The average of deaths on the whole number embarked amounts to 2½ per cent.; but the average under 14 years is 7 per cent. Between the ages of 7 and 14 only four males and seven females died at sea during 1854. The average deaths per ship is 7 3-5. The longest voyage in 1854 was that of the Time and Truth, which arrived in May, after a voyage of 118 days. The quickest was that of the Taymouth Castle, which arrived five days before the Time and Truth, having started nearly a month after her, and making a fine run of 86 days. Had it not been for the imperfect returns supplied by the Standard, Taymouth Castle, Fortune, and Lord Raglan, we should have had complete schedules of the several counties of England, Ireland, and Scotland from which the immigration for 1854 was supplied. These four vessels brought 1,219 souls, which must, therefore, be deducted from the 8,824 actually landed, leaving 7,605 to be accounted for. Of this number 3,982 were from ascertained counties in England and Wales ; 920 from Scotch counties, and 1,982 from counties in Ireland. The English county standing first in respect of numbers is Cornwall, whence we derived 708colonists in 1854. Next to Cornwall is the metropolitan county of Middlesex, which supplied us with 659 arrivals. From the agricultural county of Cambridge we obtained 328 ; from Devonshire, 233 ; from Wilts, 202; from Somerset, 190 ; from the island of Guernsey, 187. The manufacturing districts stand lower. Lancaster sent out 128; Nottingham, 53; Cheshire, 27; Yorkshire, 33; Warwickshire, 31; Staffordshire, 14 ; and Worcestershire, 6. The total number of English, including those in the four ships, not specifying counties, was 4,956 souls. The Scotch county most prolific in this respect is Lanarkshire, whence 112 persons arrived in 1854. Then follow Fifeshire, 96;Inverness, 83 ; Ayrshire, 74 ; Forfarshire, 49 ; Roxburgh and Renfrewshire, 46 each ; Aberdeen, 15 ; Kincardine and Kircudbright each furnish 1 to our population. The total from Scotland, including 17 per Standard, whose counties were not given, was 937 souls. The great source of our supply from Ireland is Clare. From this county alone 587 are entered, being nearly three times the amount of the next highest on the list, and about a quarter of the entire immigration from Ireland. Following Clare is Tipperary, whence 217 persons arrived here in 1854. Limerick sent 160; Wicklow, 159; Cavan, 148; Kilkenny, 100. The next highest to Kilkenny is King's County, 60 ; after which the numbers rapidly diminish. Donegal, Down, Louth, Londonderry, Monaghan, Wexford, Queen's County, Tralee, and Antrim only sent 42 between them. The number of Irish immigrants brought out by the four ships without distinction of county was 228. The total number of ascertained Irish immigrants from all places amounted in 1854 to 2,210 souls. As a further correction of this classification, we must observe that two ships the Dirigo and the Time and Truth  behaved worse than the four already mentioned, inasmuch as these two not only neglected the specification of counties, but brought out 721 souls without knowing whether they were English, Irish, or Scotch. The trades of the adult immigrants of 1854 are given under 31 heads. Female \"domestic servants\" stand at the head, and represent 1,405 of the total number, or rather more than 25 per cent. Agricultural labourers are down at 370 ; farm servants, a similar class, at 336. Ordinary labourers are given at 283; miners are 349. Amongst artisans we find  bricklayers, 58; sawyers, 29 ; carpenters, 258 ;shoemakers, 31 ; blacksmiths, 56 ; tailors, 13. Female labour, in addition to the domestic servants already quoted, includes 31 laundresses, 47 needlewomen, 27 cooks, 70 dairymaids, and 271 farm servants. Associating labour with nationality, we find that in 1854 all the bakers, sawyers, bricklayers, wheelwrights, and brick makers were from England and Scotland. Of the agricultural labourers 195 were from England, 52 from Scotland, and 123 from Ireland. Ordinary labourers were, from England, 150; Scotland, 29 ; Ireland, 104. Gardeners were 30 English, 2 Scotch, and 2 Irish. Shepherds were 11 English, 23, Scotch, and 13 Irish. Sawyers were 25 English and 4 Scotch. No Scotchman was a tailor ; the numbers being  English, 11 ; Irish, 2. Out of the 258 carpenters 198 were English. Of the dairymaids 62 were Irish. The masons were 67 English, 29 Scotch, and 7 Irish. Out of the 8,824 Government immigrants arriving in 1854, the number of persons unable to read or write is given at 2,537; the number that can read only at 1,926; the number that can read, and write at 4,361. As very few persons, if any, can read well and be unable to write, we may safely put the two first numbers together as representing entirely uneducated people. What amount of mental culture may be possessed by the 4,361 who \"read and write\" we have no means of correctly estimating ; but this portion of the returns proves the necessity of extending and promoting the cause of popular education. The documents before us supply some particulars relative to the cost of immigration. The average contract price for a statute adult in 1850 was £10 18s. 5d.; in 1851, £10 13s. 3d. ; in 1852, £13 12s. 7d.; in 1853, £18 11s. 1d.; in 1854, £20 2s. 2d. The lowest contract was taken by the David Malcolm, the price being £15 12s. 10d. per statute adult; and the highest, by the Pestonjee Bomanjee, £24 15s. The total cost of immigration in 1854, charged to the colonial fund, was £156,232 ; of which £7,383 was paid in the shape of gratuities to surgeons, officers, constables, &c. The total expenditure in England and in the colony, on account of immigration in 1854, was £165,020. The number of persons paying their own passages to this colony in 1854 was nearly as great as the number of Government immigrants, the former being 8,434, and the latter, as already stated, 8,824. Of course a large proportion of this self-paying immigration is intercolonial; but there were in 1854 as many as 1,287 persons who paid their own passage-money to this colony. From Foreign States the number of self-paying immigrants was 1,091. The total immigration of all kinds in the year under consideration was 17,258, being an excess of 11,791 over the immigration for the same period.\n\nHARD-WON SUCCESS. Mr. J. H. Watson's Life Story.

A fine-looking old gentleman with keen eyes, ready to twinkle with mirth, and with, all his faculties unimpaired, this Anglo-Australian is ready to declare that this young country will always grant success to a young man, provided he is prepared to work hard enough for it. In that simply stated tribute to his adopted land, Mr. Watson unconsciously reveals his own career. For he was faced with unusually heavy responsibilities when, a mere lad, had to endure many hardships, also, and yet succeeded in providing a comfortable old age, for himself, and his wife.\n\nA Tragic Beginning.\n\nIt was a cold, showery day upon which a representative of The Register called upon Mr. Watson, and asked for a sketch of his life. Had it been less stormy, the old gentleman might reasonably have been out on one of his excursions. I have, so little to tell,\" was the modest protest. Plenty of hard work, of course, but that was a general rule in the earlier times of the State. It seemed to me that life goes in for extremes. I had to toil too hard for my dry bread, whereas the young fellow of to-day gets bread and butter and luxuries, too, for the least possible exertion. But I doubt, if he will make 'old bones,' not very sturdy ones, anyway.\n\nAsked when he arrived in the colony, Mr. Watson said it was on October 7, 1854, on the, Pestonjee Bomanjee, which took 112 days fromSouthampton. The boy of nine years, who was so light-heartedly interested in the new adventure, little dreamed of the tragic happening that was about to cloud his bright hopes. The father had been so attracted by reports of the possibilities awaiting migrants overseas that he left St. James, in Lincolnshire, with his wife, son, and daughter, determined to have a hard try to win fortune. But his hopes were never realized, for he contracted typhus fever while on the vessel, and six weeks after landing passed away, leaving an almost distracted household. But the mantle of the father fell upon, that boy, for he set to work immediately in the Mc Laren Vale district, where the family had just settled. Jobs were not easy ones in a primitive bushland, and the young breadwinner had to take to bullock driving and kindred work that rightly belonged to a man. For example, he was sent to draw water from, a deep well. The heavy bucket proved too much for his strength, and pulled him into the well. Fortunately, he was not seriously hurt, but still bears a relic of that misadventure in the form of a deep groove on his fore head. Then, a year and a half later, a bullock kicked him, breaking his thigh. But my mother had an equally hard time, declared the loyal son. \"I bless her memory. To help us kiddies she used to walk two miles and do a day's washing for half a crown. The pay did not tend to breed extravagant notions, anyway. Every thing was primitive, even to the matches we sparingly used. They were about the size of a pencil, and were called posts and rails. But the tinder box and flint were the usual ignitors.\n\nA 600-mile Droving Job.\n\nAfter a while young Watson managed to get away from a cruel master, who frequently used the bullock whip upon his young employees. On one occasion several strokes were given because the cows were brought in late, and no explanation was allowed. As a matter, of fact, he had sore eyes, and so had to wait until the sun had set ere he could see anything clearly. The west coast, a wilderness then, was his next objective. There were no farms, but the country was occupied by sheep runs. On Horn's Station the newcomer was \"shepherd's mate,\" watching that the sheep did not stray and get lost. When a mob of sheep was required to be delivered for Dr. Brown, of Port Lincoln, round to Booborowie, it necessitated going right to the head of the Gulf of Port Augusta. This meant 200 extra miles, and the whole trip amounted to 600 miles. Despite the lack of proper routes, and all the difficulties attendant upon such a journey, there were only seven drovers to manage 6,000 sheep. Some of the flock got stuck in the mud, while rounding the gulf, and could not be rescued: When only 16 years of age, the subject of this biography drove a team of bullocks with a load of wood 100 miles to Port Lincoln. For safety's sake (more probably on account of the wool!) another lad was sent to drive another team, with wool, and they kept close together through a sometimes almost impenetrable country. Bullocks were the staple means of conveying vehicles at that period, the few horses serving merely as hackneys.\n\nBut times improved for all of us, observed Mr. Watson. \"I managed to get a fairly decent job, and my mother wisely married again. My stepfather, John Gribble, of Noarlunga, was a successful farmer.\"\n\nThe Road to Success.\n\nHaving had his fill of country experience, Mr. Watson turned his steps city wards. Building was in great demand in a young and rapidly growing capital, so Mr. Watson was apprenticed to the masonry, to Alfred Gully, of Halifax street. Determined to win out, the youth accepted his articles at £1 per week, but had to pay that sum in board and lodging.\n\n\"But the dear soul who kept that boarding house had a mother's heart,\" said her ex-boarder, for she used to throw me back a part of the money, saying I had to live. I never forgot her goodness, for, in after years, when success came; she used to be an honoured guest at our Christmas Day gatherings.\"\n\nIn three years Mr. Watson was a master mason, and went in for extensive building operations. Among the constructions were:  Hooker's Buildings, at the west end of Hindley street, shops at the East-End Market which were recently burnt down, the first institute at Payneham, and many hundreds of residences in and about Adelaide. In 1869 Mr Watson married Annie Arden Ekins at St. John's, Halifax street, the Rev. Robetson performing the ceremony. \"When I had paid the parson,\" observed this optimist, \"I had only 10 shillings in the world. But, in those times, when one had youth and strength, the future was taken on trust. I doubt not, we found real domestic happiness in winning success together, than many do to-day who want every comfort before they set up housekeeping. Mrs. Watson died in 1919, and in 1924 the widower married again, Miss Fanny Williams being his choice. Despite so busy a life, Mr. Watson found time to indulge in lodge and Oddfellow pursuits, beginning at 24 years, of; age, and going through all the offices, besides being a trustee. He was also, a keen Mason. His lodges are St. Andrew's, of the city, and Emulation, at Norwood, in which latter district he resided for very many years. Church work also, received its due snare, both at Kent Town Methodist and Maylands churches. For some years Mr. Watson was a Councillor for the Norwood Corporation. He was one of the first landholders in the Henley Beach district, watching its gradual development, and only recently sold his last allotment there. \"There is continuous talk of the North-South Railway,\" remarked the old gentleman. \"Sixty years ago I was one of the moving spirits in a deputation to the Government of that day, that offered to build that railway, on the land-grant system. But the offer was turned down.\" Discussing mining ventures, this many sided experimenter spoke of visits to Western Australia, in connection with the Burbank Gold Mine, near Coolgardie, and the White Range Extended Gold Mine in South Australia, in the MacDonnell Ranges. But neither of them fulfilled expectations.\n\nOf a family of 10 children, six survive. They are: Robert Watson, of Norwood; John Henry, of Fullarton; Alfred Edward, of Boulder, Western Australia; Harold Ekins, of Rose Park; Mrs. G. C. King, now in London: and Mrs. A. A. Wauchope, of Balingup, Western Australia. There are nine grandchildren living. One of the deceased was Capt. King, who was killed in France during the war.\n\nPestonjee Bomanjee passengers:\n\nWATSON Ann\n\nWATSON John, Builder\n\nWATSON Robert, Agricultural Labourer\n\nDigger - South Australian Marriages, Registrations 1842-1916\n\nGroom: WATSON, Given names: John Henry, Bride: EAKINS, Given names: Annie, Date: 1869-06-10, Groom Age: 24, Status: S, Groom's Father: Robert WATSON, Bride Age: 21, Status: S, Bride's Father: William EAKINS, Place: St John Church [Adelaide], District: Ade, Book/Page: 79/618\n\nGroom: WATSON, Given names: John Henry, Bride: WILLIAMS, Given names: Fanny, Date: 1924-09-02, Groom Age: 79, Status: W, Groom's Father: Robert WATSON, Bride Age: 55, Status: S, Bride's Father: John WILLIAMS, Place: Res of J H Watson Parkside, District: Ade, Book/Page: 300/599\n\nDigger - South Australian Births 1842-1906 (c) SAGHS\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Alfred Edward, Date: 1881-12-27, Sex: M, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Kent Town, District Code: Ade, Book: 274, Page: 375\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Annie Arden, Date: 1870-04-01, Sex: F, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Adelaide, District Code: Ade, Book: 84, Page: 229\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Emma Jane, Date: 1875-03-27, Sex: F, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Adelaide, District Code: Ade, Book: 149, Page: 300\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Harold Eakins, Date: 1886-12-22, Sex: M, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Kent Town, District Code: Nor, Book: 390, Page: 36\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: John Henry, Date: 1879-03-30, Sex: M, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Kent Town, District Code: Ade, Book: 217, Page: 444\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Robert, Date: 1871-12-15, Sex: M, Father: John Henry , WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Adelaide, District Code: Ade, Book: 103, Page: 512\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: William Stanley, Date: 1877-03-18, Sex: M, Father: John Henry WATSON, Mother: Annie EAKINS, Birth Place/Residence: Kent Town, District Code: Ade, Book: 180, Page: 422\n\nDigger - South Australian Deaths, Registrations 1916 to 1972\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: Annie, Date: 1919-03-25, Sex: F, Age: 71y, Status: M, Relative: John Henry WATSON [H], Residence: Maylands, Death Place: Maylands, District Code: Nor, Book: 426, Page: 417\n\nSurname: WATSON, Given Names: John Henry, Date: 1927-06-06, Sex: M, Age: 82y, Status: M, Residence: Parkside, Death Place: Parkside, District Code: Ade, Book: 495, Page: 351\n\nCross Reference:"
