        "text": "Using health-system-wide data to understand hepatitis B virus prophylaxis and reactivation outcomes in patients receiving rituximab.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmajuk, Gabriela; Tonner, Chris; Trupin, Laura; Li, Jing; Sarkar, Urmimala; Ludwig, Dana; Shiboski, Stephen; Sirota, Marina; Dudley, R Adams; Murray, Sara; Yazdany, Jinoos\n\n2017-03-01\n\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in the setting of rituximab use is a potentially fatal but preventable safety event. The rate of HBV screening and proportion of patients at risk who receive antiviral prophylaxis in patients initiating rituximab is unknown.We analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from 2 health systems, a university center and a safety net health system, including diagnosis grouper codes, problem lists, medications, laboratory results, procedures codes, clinical encounter notes, and scanned documents. We identified all patients who received rituximab between 6/1/2012 and 1/1/2016. We calculated the proportion of rituximab users with inadequate screening for HBV according to the Centers for Disease Control guidelines for detecting latent HBV infection before their first rituximab infusion during the study period. We also assessed the proportion of patients with positive hepatitis B screening tests who were prescribed antiviral prophylaxis. Finally, we characterized safety failures and adverse events.We included 926 patients from the university and 132 patients from the safety net health system. Sixty-one percent of patients from the university had adequate screening for HBV compared with 90% from the safety net. Among patients at risk for reactivation based on results of HBV testing, 66% and 92% received antiviral prophylaxis at the university and safety net, respectively.We found wide variations in hepatitis B screening practices among patients receiving rituximab, resulting in unnecessary risks to patients. Interventions should be developed to improve patient safety procedures in this high-risk patient population.\n\nDevelopment of a novel remote patient monitoring system: the advanced symptom management system for radiotherapy to improve the symptom experience of patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaguire, Roma; Ream, Emma; Richardson, Alison; Connaghan, John; Johnston, Bridget; Kotronoulas, Grigorios; Pedersen, Vibe; McPhelim, John; Pattison, Natalie; Smith, Allison; Webster, Lorraine; Taylor, Anne; Kearney, Nora\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe use of technology-enhanced patient-reported outcome measures to monitor the symptoms experienced by people with cancer is an effective way to offer timely care. This study aimed to (a) explore the feasibility and acceptability of the Advanced Symptom Management System with patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy and clinicians involved in their care and (b) assess changes in patient outcomes during implementation of the Advanced Symptom Management System with patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy in clinical practice. A repeated-measures, single-arm, mixed-methods study design was used involving poststudy interviews and completion of patient-reported outcome measures at baseline and end of treatment with 16 patients with lung cancer and 13 clinicians who used this mobile phone-based symptom monitoring system. Only rarely did patients report problems in using the handset and they felt that the system covered all relevant symptoms and helped them to manage their symptoms and effectively communicate with clinicians. Clinical improvements in patient anxiety, drowsiness, and self-care self-efficacy were also observed. Clinicians perceived the use of \"real-time\" risk algorithms and automated self-care advice provided to patients as positively contributing to clinical care. Reducing the complexity of the system was seen as important to promote its utility. Although preliminary, these results suggest that monitoring patient symptoms using mobile technology in the context of radiotherapy for lung cancer is feasible and acceptable in clinical practice. Future research would be most beneficial if the use of this technology was focused on the postradiotherapy phase and expanded the scope of the system to encompass a wider range of supportive care needs.\n\nHypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving hemodialysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nButani, Lavjay; Calogiuri, Gianfranco\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTo describe hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. PubMed search of articles published during the past 30 years with an emphasis on publications in the past decade. Case reports and review articles describing hypersensitivity reactions in the context of hemodialysis. Pharmacologic agents are the most common identifiable cause of hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving hemodialysis. These include iron, erythropoietin, and heparin, which can cause anaphylactic or pseudoallergic reactions, and topical antibiotics and anesthetics, which lead to delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Many hypersensitivity reactions are triggered by complement activation and increased bradykinin resulting from contact system activation, especially in the context of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. Several alternative pharmacologic preparations and dialyzer membranes are available, such that once an etiology for the reaction is established, recurrences can be prevented without affecting the quality of care provided to patients. Although hypersensitivity reactions are uncommon in patients receiving hemodialysis, they can be life-threatening. Moreover, considering the large prevalence of the end-stage renal disease population, the implications of such reactions are enormous. Most reactions are pseudoallergic and not mediated by immunoglobulin E. The multiplicity of potential exposures and the complexity of the environment to which patients on dialysis are exposed make it challenging to identify the precise cause of these reactions. Great diligence is needed to investigate hypersensitivity reactions to avoid recurrence in this high-risk population. Copyright Â© 2017 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, are increasingly being provided in the ambulatory care setting. Cancer treatments are commonly associated with distressing and serious side-effects and patients often struggle to manage these themselves without specialized real-time support. Unlike chronic disease populations, few systems for the remote real-time monitoring of cancer patients have been reported. However, several prototype systems have been developed and have received favorable reports. This review aimed to identify and detail systems that reported statistical analyses of changes in patient clinical outcomes, health care system usage or health economic analyses. Five papers were identified that met these criteria. There was wide variation in the design of the monitoring systems in terms of data input method, clinician alerting and response, groups of patients targeted and clinical outcomes measured. The majority of studies had significant methodological weaknesses. These included no control group comparisons, small sample sizes, poor documentation of clinical interventions or measures of adherence to the monitoring systems. In spite of the limitations, promising results emerged in terms of improved clinical outcomes (e.g. pain, depression, fatigue). Health care system usage was assessed in two papers with inconsistent results. No studies included health economic analyses. The diversity in systems described, outcomes measured and methodological issues all limited between-study comparisons. Given the acceptability of remote monitoring and the promising outcomes from the few studies analyzing patient or health care system outcomes, future research is needed to rigorously trial these systems to enable greater patient support and safety in the ambulatory setting.\n\nBenefits of remote real-time side-effect monitoring systems for patients receiving cancer treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKofoed, Sarah; Breen, Sibilah; Gough, Karla; Aranda, Sanchia\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn Australia, the incidence of cancer diagnoses is rising along with an aging population.

They, therefore, represent a widely used therapeutic modality. Nevertheless, post-marketing studies reveal an increased risk of infection in patients taking these drugs, especially granulomatous infections such as listeriosis. We aimed to evaluate the reported cases of listeriosis in patients treated with biologic treatments. We used the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) from 2004 to 2011. We also perform a literature review of previously reported cases of listeriosis in patients taking biologic therapies. We identified 266 cases of Listeria monocytogenes infection associated with biologic therapies. The majority of patients were receiving infliximab (77.1 %), followed by etanercept (11.7 %), adalimumab (9.8 %), rituximab (4.1 %), abatacept (0.4 %) and golimumab (0.4 %). Indications for the use of biologics were as follows: 47.7 % for rheumatologic diseases, 38 % for inflammatory bowel diseases, 3.4 % for haematological diseases and 10.5 % for other indications. Seventy-three percent of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressant drugs, especially steroids (56 %) and methotrexate (31.6 %). The median time to the onset of infection was 184 days. Mortality rates range from 11.1 % in adalimumab-treated patients to 27.3 % in rituximab-treated patients (pâ=â0.7). Listeriosis is common in biologics-treated patients, especially related to infliximab use given concomitantly with other immunosuppressive therapies. Infections after treatment with biologics mostly occurred in the first year after initiating treatment.\n\nA Clinical Study on Administration of Opioid Antagonists in Terminal Cancer Patients: 7 Patients Receiving Opioid Antagonists Following Opioids among 2443 Terminal Cancer Patients Receiving Opioids.\n\nPubMed\n\nUekuzu, Yoshihiro; Higashiguchi, Takashi; Futamura, Akihiko; Ito, Akihiro; Mori, Naoharu; Murai, Miyo; Ohara, Hiroshi; Awa, Hiroko; Chihara, Takeshi\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThere have been few detailed reports on respiratory depression due to overdoses of opioids in terminal cancer patients. We investigated the situation of treatment with opioid antagonists for respiratory depression that occurred after administration of opioid at optimal doses in terminal cancer patients, to clarify pathological changes as well as causative factors. In 2443 terminal cancer patients receiving opioids, 7 patients (0.3%) received opioid antagonists: 6, morphine (hydrochloride, 5; sulfate, 1); 1, oxycodone. The median dosage of opioids was 13.3âmg/d, as converted to morphine injection. Respiratory depression occurred on this daily dose in 4 patients and after changed dose and route in 3 patients. Opioids were given through the vein in 6 patients and by the enteral route in 1 patient. Concomitant drugs included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in 3 patients and zoledronic acid in 2 patients. In morphine-receiving patients, renal functions were significantly worsened at the time of administration of an opioid antagonist than the day before the start of opioid administration. These findings indicate that the proper use of opioids was safe and acceptable in almost all terminal cancer patients. In rare cases, however, a risk toward respiratory depression onset is indicated because morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide become relatively excessive owing to systemic debility due to disease progression, especially respiratory and renal dysfunctions. At the onset of respiratory depression, appropriate administration of an opioid antagonist mitigated the symptoms. Thereafter, opioid switching or continuous administration at reduced dosages of the same opioids prevented the occurrence of serious adverse events.\n\nImpact of Prior Platinum-Based Therapy on Patients Receiving Salvage Systemic Treatment for Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nSonpavde, G; Pond, G R; Di Lorenzo, G; Buonerba, C; Rozzi, A; Lanzetta, G; Necchi, A; Giannatempo, P; Raggi, D; Matsumoto, K; Choueiri, T K; Mullane, S; Niegisch, G; Albers, P; Lee, J L; Kitamura, H; Kume, H; Bellmunt, J\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTrials of salvage therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma have required prior platinum-based therapy. This practice requires scrutiny because non-platinum-based first-line therapy may be offered to cisplatin-ineligible patients. Data of patients receiving salvage systemic chemotherapy were collected. Data on prior first-line platinum exposure were required in addition to treatment-free interval, hemoglobin, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, albumin, and liver metastasis status. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to evaluate their association with overall survival (OS) after accounting for salvage single-agent or combination chemotherapy. Data were obtained from 455 patients previously exposed to platinum-based therapy and 37 not exposed to platinum. In the group exposed to prior platinum therapy, salvage therapy consisted of a single-agent taxane (nÂ = 184) or a taxane-containing combination chemotherapy (nÂ = 271). In the group not exposed to prior platinum therapy, salvage therapy consisted of taxane or vinflunine (nÂ = 20), 5-fluorouracil (nÂ = 1), taxane-containing combination chemotherapy (nÂ = 12), carboplatin-based combinations (nÂ = 2), and cisplatin-based combinations (nÂ =Â 2). The median OS for the prior platinum therapy group was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval, 7.0, 8.1), and for the group that had not received prior platinum therapy was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval, 6.0, 11.0; PÂ = .50). In the multivariable analysis, prior platinum therapy versus no prior platinum exposure did not confer an independent impact on OS (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.75, 1.64; PÂ = .62). Prior platinum- versus non-platinum-based chemotherapy did not have a prognostic impact on OS after accounting for major prognostic factors in patients receiving salvage systemic chemotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma. Lack of prior platinum therapy should not disqualify patients from inclusion onto trials of salvage\n\nPatient actions and reactions after receiving negative results from expanded carrier screening\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKraft, Stephanie A.; Schneider, Jennifer L.; Leo, Michael C.; Kauffman, Tia L.; Davis, James V.; Porter, Kathryn M.; McMullen, Carmit K.; Wilfond, Benjamin S.; Goddard, Katrina A.B.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWith the expansion of carrier screening to general preconception and prenatal patient populations, most patients will receive negative results, which we define as indicating <25% risk of having a child with a genetic condition. Because there is limited experience with expanded carrier screening, it is important to understand how receiving negative results affects patients, especially as providers, payers, and policymakers consider whether to offer it. In this mixed-methods study, we asked preconception patients enrolled in the NextGen study about their expectations and experiences receiving negative expanded carrier screening results. Participants completed surveys at study enrollment (n=110 women, 51 male partners), after receiving carrier results (n=100 women, 38 male partners), after receiving secondary findings (n=98 women, 36 male partners), and 6 months after receiving results (n=95 women, 28 male partners). We also interviewed a subset of participants 12â24 months after receiving results (n=24 women, 12 male partners). We found minimal negative emotional impact and privacy concerns, increased confidence in reproductive plans, and few changes to health behaviors, although some patients made health decisions based on misunderstandings of their results. These findings suggest that expanded carrier screening causes minimal psychosocial harms, but systems are needed to reduce the risk of misinterpreting results.

This study was undertaken to examine access issues in Iowa and determine a methodology for conducting a similar national analysis. Patients and Methods: All Iowa residents who received radiation therapy regardless of where they were diagnosed or treated were identified through the Iowa Cancer Registry (ICR). Radiation oncologists were identified through the Iowa Physician Information System (IPIS). Radiation facilities were identified through IPIS and classified using the Commission on Cancer accreditation standard. Results: Between 2004 and 2010, 113,885 invasive cancers in 106,603 patients, 28.5% of whom received radiation treatment, were entered in ICR. Mean and median travel times were 25.8 and 20.1 minutes, respectively, to the nearest facility but 42.4 and 29.1 minutes, respectively, to the patient's chosen treatment facility. Multivariable analysis predicting travel time showed significant relationships for disease site, age, residence location, and facility category. Residents of small and isolated rural towns traveled nearly 3Ã longer than urban residents to receive radiation therapy, as did patients using certain categories of facilities. Conclusion: Half of Iowa patients could reach their nearest facility in 20 minutes, but instead, they traveled 30 minutes on average to receive treatment. The findings identified certain groups of patients with cancer who chose more distant facilities. However, other groups of patients with cancer, namely those residing in rural areas, had less choice, and some had to travel considerably farther to radiation facilities than urban patients.

Pathologic response in the form of pathologic complete response (pCR) and grading systems of partial response, such as the residual cancer burden (RCB) system, gives valuable prognostic information for patients and is used as a primary endpoint in clinical trials. The breast cancer and pathology communities are responding with efforts to standardize pathology in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this review, we summarize the challenges that postneoadjuvant systemic therapy surgical specimens pose and how pathologists and the multidisciplinary team can work together to optimize handling of these specimens. Multidisciplinary communication is essential. A single, standardized approach to macroscopic and microscopic pathologic examination makes it possible to provide reliable response information. This approach employs a map of tissue sections to correlate clinical, gross, microscopic, and imaging findings in order to report the presence of pCR (ypT0 ypN0 and ypT0/is ypN0) versus residual disease, the ypT and ypN stage using the current AJCC/UICC staging system, and the RCB.\n\nBreakthrough Clostridium difficile Infection in Cirrhotic Patients Receiving Rifaximin.\n\nPubMed\n\nReigadas, Elena; AlcalÃ¡, Luis; GÃ³mez, Javier; MarÃ­n, Mercedes; Martin, AdoraciÃ³n; Onori, Raffaella; MuÃ±oz, Patricia; Bouza, Emilio\n\n2018-03-19\n\nPatients with cirrhosis are at high risk of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Rifaximin is commonly used in cirrhotic patients as prophylaxis for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of rifaximin in the treatment of CDI; however, resistance to rifaximin has also been reported. Few studies have assessed the risk of developing CDI in cirrhotic patients receiving rifaximin. Our objective was to assess the incidence and characteristics of CDI in patients with cirrhosis, especially in those who received rifaximin. We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of CDI in cirrhotic patients over a 6-year period in our hospital. Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed. Ribotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all strains against rifaximin were performed. A total of 388 cirrhotic patients were included, of whom 127 patients had at least 1 episode of diarrhea in which a sample was sent to the laboratory. CDI was detected in 46 patients. Fourteen patients (30.4%) were receiving rifaximin as prophylaxis for HE. The main ribotypes detected were 001 (30.4%), followed by 014 (19.6%). Resistance to rifaximin was 34.1% overall, and 84.6% in patients who had received rifaximin. Multivariate analysis showed that rifamycin therapy and ribotype 001 were significant risk factors for having a rifaximin-resistant C. difficile strain. A high percentage of CDI cases were detected in cirrhotic patients receiving rifaximin, mostly owing to selection of rifaximin-resistant C. difficile strains. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of CDI in cirrhotic patients, even in those receiving rifaximin.\n\nEUTOS CML prognostic scoring system predicts ELN-based 'event-free survival' better than Euro/Hasford and Sokal systems in CML patients receiving front-line imatinib mesylate.\n\nPubMed\n\nUz, Burak; Buyukasik, Yahya; Atay, Hilmi; Kelkitli, Engin; Turgut, Mehmet; Bektas, Ozlen; Eliacik, Eylem; Isik, AyÅe; Aksu, Salih; Goker, Hakan; Sayinalp, Nilgun; Ozcebe, Osman I; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThe validity of the three currently used chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) scoring systems (Sokal CML prognostic scoring system, Euro/Hasford CML scoring system, and the EUTOS CML prognostic scoring system) were compared in the CML patients receiving frontline imatinib mesylate. One hundred and fourty-three chronic phase CML patients (71 males, 72 females) taking imatinib as frontline treatment were included in the study. The median age was 44 (16-82) years. Median total and on-imatinib follow-up durations were 29 (3.8-130) months and 25 (3-125) months, respectively. The complete hematological response (CHR) rate at 3 months was 95%. The best cumulative complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate at 24 months was 79.6%. Euro/Hasford scoring system was well-correlated with both Sokal and EUTOS scores (r = 0.6, P < 0.001 and r = 0.455, P < 0.001). However, there was only a weak correlation between Sokal and EUTOS scores (r = 0.2, P = 0.03). The 5-year median estimated event-free survival for low and high EUTOS risk patients were 62.6 (25.7-99.5) and 15.3 (7.4-23.2) months, respectively (P < 0.001). This performance was better than Sokal (P = 0.3) and Euro/Hasford (P = 0.04) scoring systems. Overall survival and CCyR rates were also better predicted by the EUTOS score. EUTOS CML prognostic scoring system, which is the only prognostic system developed during the imatinib era, predicts European LeukemiaNet (ELN)-based event-free survival better than Euro/Hasford and Sokal systems in CML patients receiving frontline imatinib mesylate. This observation might have important clinical implications.\n\nOutcomes of microvascular flap reconstruction of the head and neck in patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaverien, Mark V; Dean, Riley A; Myers, Jeffrey N; Fang, Lin; Largo, Rene D; Yu, Peirong\n\n2018-05-03\n\nFor organ transplant recipients, cancer secondary to immunosuppressive therapy threatens long-term survival. The associated multiple comorbidities make major free flap reconstruction following cancer surgery a complicated event. This study evaluates the outcomes of free flap reconstruction in this population. A retrospective chart review of all head and neck free flap cases in patients with a history of organ transplantation receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy between 2005 and 2017 at a single-institution was conducted. Of 57 organ transplant patients, 25 patients (28 flaps) were included. Flaps used included the anterolateral thigh (nâ=â17), radial forearm (nâ=â4), latissimus dorsi (nâ=â3), fibula (nâ=â2), lateral arm (nâ=â1), and thoracodorsal artery perforator (nâ=â1) flaps. The most common organ transplant was kidney, then lung, liver, and heart. Mean inpatient stay was 8.2 days (range, 4-28). Complications occurred in 15 patients, with no total or partial flap losses. Major head and neck free flap reconstructive surgery can be performed safely in organ transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Meticulous multidisciplinary care is required to achieve consistently successful outcomes.

Limited data support the clinical benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis. In this double-blind, multicenter trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the ultra-low-molecular-weight heparin semuloparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. Patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors who were beginning to receive a course of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive subcutaneous semuloparin, 20 mg once daily, or placebo until there was a change of chemotherapy regimen. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of any symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, any nonfatal pulmonary embolism, and death related to venous thromboembolism. Clinically relevant bleeding (major and nonmajor) was the main safety outcome. The median treatment duration was 3.5 months. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 20 of 1608 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin, as compared with 55 of 1604 (3.4%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21 to 0.60; P<0.001), with consistent efficacy among subgroups defined according to the origin and stage of cancer and the baseline risk of venous thromboembolism. The incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was 2.8% and 2.0% in the semuloparin and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.21). Major bleeding occurred in 19 of 1589 patients (1.2%) receiving semuloparin and 18 of 1583 (1.1%) receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.99). Incidences of all other adverse events were similar in the two study groups. Semuloparin reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with no apparent increase in major bleeding.

Rousettus leschenaultii's left ear constitutes the model for the design of the optimal receiver for this sonar system and 3D printing was used to fabricate receiver structures comprising of two truncated cones with an elliptical external perimeter and a parabolic flare rate in the upper part. Measurements show one receiver has a predominant lobe in the same region and with similar attenuation values as the bat ear model. The final sonar system is to be mounted on vehicular and aerial robots which require remote control for motion and sensors for estimation of each robot's location.\n\nDentist-prescribed drugs and the patients receiving them.\n\nPubMed\n\nWall, Thomas P; Brown, L Jackson; Zentz, Ronald R; Manski, Richard J\n\n2007-01-01\n\nOutpatient prescription drugs continue to play an ever-increasing role in health care delivery in the United States. This paper focuses on the drugs prescribed by dentists and the patients who receive those drugs. The authors analyzed data from the 2001 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the U.S. community-based population. They developed estimates of the total market for prescription drugs related to a dental visit in terms of total number of prescriptions, total expenditures, and sources of payment. Also included are breakdowns by the type of dentist and the therapeutic class of drug prescribed. They also present a model that identifies the patient characteristics that best predict the likelihood of receiving a dental visit related prescription drug. Dental patients who were 18 years and older, African American patients, patients whose education level was less than a college degree, patients whose dental visit frequency was less than twice a year, and patients without medical insurance were most likely to report a prescription drug. Respondents' socioeconomic background and other demographic factors were related to the likelihood of receiving a prescription drug related to a dental visit. Patient age was related to the therapeutic class of the drug prescribed. Patients with fewer than two dental visits per year were more likely to report a dental prescription than patients with at least two visits per year.\n\nAntiproteinuric effects of renin-angiotensin inhibitors in lung cancer patients receiving bevacizumab.\n\nPubMed\n\nNihei, Satoru; Sato, Junya; Harada, Toshiyuki; Kuyama, Shoichi; Suzuki, Toshiro; Waga, Nobutsugu; Saito, Yoshitaka; Kisara, Shigeki; Yokota, Atsuko; Okada, Kouji; Tsuchiya, Masami; Terui, Kazufumi; Tadokoro, Yumiko; Chiba, Takeshi; Kudo, Kenzo; Oizumi, Satoshi; Inoue, Akira; Morikawa, Naoto\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) on bevacizumab (BV)-induced proteinuria in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NSCLC patients receiving BV between 2008 and 2014 at 11 hospitals. The patients were categorized into three groups according to their antihypertensive drug use: RASI user, non-RASI user, and non-user groups. The primary outcome was a proteinuria event of any grade during the first 6 cycles of BV treatment. A total of 211 patients were included, 89 of whom received antihypertensive drugs. Of these 89 patients, 49 were in the RASI user group, and 40 were in the non-RASI user group. The non-user group comprised 122 patients. The occurrence of proteinuria in the RASI user group was significantly lower than that in the non-RASI user group (Pâ=â0.037) but was not significantly lower than that in the non-user group (Pâ=â0.287). Patients using RASIs had a lower rate of proteinuria than those who did not use RASIs according to multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.86; Pâ=â0.024). Our study suggests that RASI administration reduces the risk of proteinuria in patients receiving BV.\n\nPrognostic role of a multigene reverse transcriptase-PCR assay in patients with node-negative breast cancer not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nEsteva, Francisco J; Sahin, Aysegul A; Cristofanilli, Massimo; Coombes, Kevin; Lee, Sang-Joon; Baker, Joffre; Cronin, Maureen; Walker, Michael; Watson, Drew; Shak, Steven; Hortobagyi, Gabriel N\n\n2005-05-01\n\nTo test the ability of a reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay, based on gene expression profiles, to accurately determine the risk of recurrence in patients with node-negative breast cancer who did not receive systemic therapy using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. A secondary objective was to determine whether the quantitative RT-PCR data correlated with immunohistochemistry assay data regarding estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. We obtained archival paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with invasive breast cancer but no axillary lymph node involvement who had received no adjuvant systemic therapy and been followed for at least 5 years. RNA was extracted from three 10-microm-thick sections. The expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes was quantified using RT-PCR. A gene expression algorithm was used to calculate a recurrence score for each patient. We then assessed the ability of the test to accurately predict distant recurrence-free survival in this population. We identified 149 eligible patients. Median age at diagnosis was 59 years; mean tumor diameter was 2 cm; and 69% of tumors were estrogen receptor positive. Median follow-up was 18 years. The 5-year disease-free survival rate for the group was 80%. The 21 gene-based recurrence score was not predictive of distant disease recurrence. However, a high concordance between RT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status was noted. RT-PCR can be done on paraffin-embedded tissue to validate the large numbers of genes associated with breast cancer recurrence. However, further work needs to be done to develop an assay to identify the likelihood of recurrent disease in patients with node-negative breast cancer who do not receive adjuvant tamoxifen or chemotherapy.\n\nReceiver System: Lessons Learned from Solar Two\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLitwin, R.

A prognostic classification system in this disease may facilitate interpretation of outcomes and guide rational drug development. We performed a retrospective analysis to identify prognostic factors in men with PSCC receiving first-line systemic therapy for advanced disease. Individual patient level data were obtained from 13 institutions to study prognostic factors in the context of first-line systemic therapy for advanced PSCC. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to examine the prognostic effect of these candidate factors on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS): age, stage, hemoglobin, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, albumin, site of metastasis (visceral or nonvisceral), smoking, circumcision, regimen, ECOG performance status (PS), lymphovascular invasion, precancerous lesion, and surgery following chemotherapy. The effect of different treatments was then evaluated adjusting for factors in the prognostic model. The study included 140 eligible men. Mean age across all men was 57.0 years. Among them, 8.6%, 21.4%, and 70.0% of patients had stage 2, 3, and 4 diseases, respectively; 40.7% had ECOG PS â¥ 1, 47.4% had visceral metastases, and 73.6% received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The multivariate model of poor prognostic factors included visceral metastases (P<0.001) and ECOG PS â¥ 1 (P<0.001) for both PFS and OS. A risk stratification model constructed with 0, 1, and both poor prognostic factors was internally validated and demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability (c-statistic of 0.657 and 0.677 for OS and PFS, respectively). The median OS for the entire population was 9 months. Median OS was not reached, 8, and 7 months for those with 0, 1, and both risk factors, respectively. Cisplatin-based regimens were associated with better OS (P = 0.017) but not PFS (P = 0.37) compared with noncisplatin\n\nReceiver System: Lessons Learned From Solar Two\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLITWIN, ROBERT Z.; PACHECO, JAMES E.\n\nThe Boeing Company fabricated the Solar Two receiver as a subcontractor for the Solar Two project.

The first of these technologies consists of off-the-shelf mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detectors and amplifiers. The vendor for this system is Kolmar Technologies. This system was fielded in the Tan Trailer I (TTI) in 1995 and will be referred to in this paper as GEN I. The second system consists of a MCT detector procured from Santa Barbara Research Center (SBRC) and an amplifier designed and built by LANL. This system was fielded in the Tan Trailer II (TTII) system at the NTS tests in 1996 and will bemoreÂ Â» referred to as GEN II. The LANL CALIOPE experimental plan for 1996 was to improve the lidar system by progressing to a higher rep rate laser to perform many shots in a much shorter period of time. In keeping with this plan, the receiver team set a goal of developing a detector system that was background limited for the projected 100 nanosecond (ns) laser pulse. A set of detailed simulations of the DIAL lidar experiment was performed. From these runs, parameters such as optimal detector size, field of view of the receiver system, nominal laser return power, etc. were extracted. With this information, detector physics and amplifier electronic models were developed to obtain the required specifications for each of these components. These derived specs indicated that a substantial improvement over commercially available, off-the-shelf, amplifier and detector technologies would be needed to obtain the goals. To determine if the original GEN I detector was usable, the authors performed tests on a 100 micron square detector at cryogenic temperatures. The results of this test and others convinced them that an advanced detector was required. Eventually, a suitable detector was identified and a number of these single element detectors were procured from SBRC. These single element detectors were witness for the detector arrays built for another DOE project.Â«Â less\n\nEconomic Evaluation of a Patient-Directed Music Intervention for ICU Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilatory Support.\n\nPubMed\n\nChlan, Linda L; Heiderscheit, Annette; Skaar, Debra J; Neidecker, Marjorie V\n\n2018-05-04\n\nMusic intervention has been shown to reduce anxiety and sedative exposure among mechanically ventilated patients. Whether music intervention reduces ICU costs is not known. The aim of this study was to examine ICU costs for patients receiving a patient-directed music intervention compared with patients who received usual ICU care. A cost-effectiveness analysis from the hospital perspective was conducted to determine if patient-directed music intervention was cost-effective in improving patient-reported anxiety. Cost savings were also evaluated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined the influence of input variation on the cost-effectiveness. Midwestern ICUs. Adult ICU patients from a parent clinical trial receiving mechanical ventilatory support. Patients receiving the experimental patient-directed music intervention received a MP3 player, noise-canceling headphones, and music tailored to individual preferences by a music therapist. The base case cost-effectiveness analysis estimated patient-directed music intervention reduced anxiety by 19 points on the Visual Analogue Scale-Anxiety with a reduction in cost of $2,322/patient compared with usual ICU care, resulting in patient-directed music dominance. The probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis found that average patient-directed music intervention costs were $2,155 less than usual ICU care and projected that cost saving is achieved in 70% of 1,000 iterations. Based on break-even analyses, cost saving is achieved if the per-patient cost of patient-directed music intervention remains below $2,651, a value eight times the base case of $329. Patient-directed music intervention is cost-effective for reducing anxiety in mechanically ventilated ICU patients.\n\nInfectious complications in patients undergoing marrow transplantation: a prospective randomized study of the additional effect of decontamination and laminar air flow isolation among patients receiving prophylactic systemic antibiotics.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetersen, F B; Buckner, C D; Clift, R A; Nelson, N; Counts, G W; Meyers, J D; Thomas, E D\n\n1987-01-01\n\n99 patients with hematological malignancies underwent allogeneic marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors and were randomized to receive one of two forms of infection prophylaxis while granulocytopenic: (1) prophylactic systemic antibiotics in a conventional hospital room (PSA, 50 patients) or (2) decontamination, isolation in a laminar air flow room and the administration of prophylactic systemic antibiotics (LAF + PSA, 49 patients). Only 1 patient (3%) in the LAF + PSA group acquired septicemia while granulocytopenic compared to 11 (24%) patients in the PSA group (p less than 0.005). Three patients (6%) in the LAF + PSA group acquired major localized infections compared to 9 (18%) in the PSA group (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in days in hospital post transplant, days of granulocytopenia, days of fever, incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, interstitial pneumonitis or overall survival. We conclude that the use of prophylactic systemic antibiotics added to decontamination and laminar air flow isolation of patients undergoing marrow transplantation significantly reduces the incidence of septicemia in the granulocytopenic period.\n\nWhich patients receive advice on diet and exercise?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSinclair, Jennifer; Lawson, Beverley; Burge, Fred\n\n2008-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To examine whether patientsâ characteristics, familiarity with the clinic, or perspectives on the quality of their care predict whether they receive advice from physicians regarding diet and exercise. DESIGN Secondary data analysis of responses to the Primary Care Practice Survey. SETTING Capital District Health Authority in Nova Scotia. PARTICIPANTS Residents of the Capital District Health Authority 18 years old and older (N = 1562). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of patients who reported frequently receiving advice from their family physicians regarding diet and exercise. RESULTS Almost 38% of respondents reported frequently receiving advice from their physicians on diet. Those more likely to receive advice on diet were male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.1), were 35 to 54 years old (compared with those aged 18to 34) (AOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.2), had more chronic illnesses (AOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.6), had good relationships with their health care providers (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1), or reported higher scores on an enablement scale (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.1). Respondents who reported their health status as excellent were less likely toreceive advice on diet (AOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). About 42% of respondents reported frequently receiving advice on exercise. Men (AOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.2), those older than 35 years (AOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4 for those aged 35 to 54; AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3 for those 55 and older), those rating their health as good (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4), those with more chronic illnesses (AOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5), and those reporting higher scores on communication (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 2.3 to 4.4) and enablement (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.4) scales were more likely to receive advice on exercise. CONCLUSION Strategies to increase the number of patients who receive advice on diet and exercise would likely include enhancing communication between patients andtheir physicians\n\nDosing algorithm to target a predefined AUC in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma receiving high dose methotrexate.\n\nPubMed\n\nJoerger, Markus; Ferreri, AndrÃ©s J M; KrÃ¤henbÃ¼hl, Stephan; Schellens, Jan H M; Cerny, Thomas; Zucca, Emanuele; Huitema, Alwin D R\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThere is no consensus regarding optimal dosing of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Our aim was to develop a convenient dosing algorithm to target AUC(MTX) in the range between 1000 and 1100 Âµmol l(-1) h. A population covariate model from a pooled dataset of 131 patients receiving HDMTX was used to simulate concentration-time curves of 10,000 patients and test the efficacy of a dosing algorithm based on 24 h MTX plasma concentrations to target the prespecified AUC(MTX) . These data simulations included interindividual, interoccasion and residual unidentified variability. Patients received a total of four simulated cycles of HDMTX and adjusted MTX dosages were given for cycles two to four. The dosing algorithm proposes MTX dose adaptations ranging from +75% in patients with MTX C(24) < 0.5 Âµmol l(-1) up to -35% in patients with MTX C(24) > 12 Âµmol l(-1). The proposed dosing algorithm resulted in a marked improvement of the proportion of patients within the AUC(MTX) target between 1000 and 1100 Âµmol l(-1) h (11% with standard MTX dose, 35% with the adjusted dose) and a marked reduction of the interindividual variability of MTX exposure. A simple and practical dosing algorithm for HDMTX has been developed based on MTX 24 h plasma concentrations, and its potential efficacy in improving the proportion of patients within a prespecified target AUC(MTX) and reducing the interindividual variability of MTX exposure has been shown by data simulations. The clinical benefit of this dosing algorithm should be assessed in patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Â© 2011 The Authors.

There were four intertrochanteric and 11 femoral neck fractures. 10 of the 11 femoral neck fractures and one of the four intertrochanteric fractures were treated with cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Two intertrochanteric fractures fixed with sliding compression screws. External fixation was used for stabilization in two patients who had femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures. Two intertrochanteric fractures that were treated with sliding hip screw showed radiological union postoperatively at the 6th month. Of the 11 hemiarthroplasty, four hips developed aseptic loosening (36%). According to Harris hip score grading system, three (37.5%) poor, two (25%) fair, two (25%) good and one (12.5%) case had excellent outcome in the hemiarthroplasty group. The survival of dialysis patients with a hip fracture is markedly reduced. Initial treatment of hemiarthroplasty allows early mobilization and prevents revision surgery.\n\nPalliative care for patients with cancer: do patients receive the care they consider important? A survey study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeins, Marianne; Hofstede, Jolien; Rijken, Mieke; Korevaar, Joke; Donker, GÃ©; Francke, Anneke\n\n2018-04-17\n\nIn many countries, GPs and home care nurses are involved in care for patients with advanced cancer. Given the varied and complex needs of these patients, providing satisfactory care is a major challenge for them. We therefore aimed to study which aspects of care patients, GPs and home care nurses consider important and whether patients receive these aspects. Seventy-two Dutch patients with advanced cancer, 87 GPs and 26 home care nurses rated the importance of support when experiencing symptoms, respect for patients' autonomy and information provision. Patients also rated whether they received these aspects. Questionnaires were based on the CQ index palliative care. Almost all patients rated information provision and respect for their autonomy as important. The majority also rated support when suffering from specific symptoms as important, especially support when in pain. In general, patients received the care they considered important. However, 49% of those who considered it important to receive support when suffering from fatigue and 23% of those who wanted to receive information on the expected course of their illness did not receive this or only did so sometimes. For most patients with advanced cancer, the palliative care that they receive matches what they consider important. Support for patients experiencing fatigue may need more attention. When symptoms are difficult to control, GPs and nurses may still provide emotional support and practical advice. Furthermore, we recommend that GPs discuss patients' need for information about the expected course of their illness.\n\nCost differential by site of service for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHayes, Jad; Hoverman, Russell J; Brow, Matthew E; Dilbeck, Dana C; Verrilli, Diana K; Garey, Jody; Espirito, Janet L; Cardona, Jorge; Beveridge, Roy\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo compare the costs of: 1) chemotherapy treatment across clinical, demographic, and geographic variables; and 2) various cancer care-related cost categories between patients receiving chemotherapy in a community oncology versus a hospital outpatient setting. Data from the calendar years 2008 to 2010 from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database were analyzed. During 2010, the data set contained approximately 45 million unique commercially insured patients with 70,984 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. These patients were assigned to cohorts depending on whether they received chemotherapy at a community oncology or hospital outpatient setting. Cost data for 9 common cancer types were extracted from the database and analyzed on a per member per month basis to normalize costs; costs included amounts paid by the payer and patient payment. Community oncology and hospital outpatient setting chemotherapy treatment costs were categorized and examined according to cancer diagnosis, patient demographics, and geographic location. Patients receiving chemotherapy treatment in the community oncology clinic had a 20% to 39% lower mean per member per month cost of care, depending on diagnosis, compared with those receiving chemotherapy in the hospital outpatient setting. This cost differential was consistent across cancer type, geographic location, patient age, and number of chemotherapy sessions. Various cost categories examined were also higher for those treated in the hospital outpatient setting. The cost of care for patients receiving chemotherapy was consistently lower in the community oncology clinic compared with the hospital outpatient setting, controlling for the clinical, demographic, and geographic variables analyzed.\n\nIncidence, source, and nature of complaints received in a large, urban emergency medical services system.\n\nPubMed\n\nCurka, P A; Pepe, P E; Zachariah, B S; Gray, G D; Matsumoto, C\n\n1995-06-01\n\nTo document the incidence, source, and reasons for all complaints received by a large municipal emergency medical services (EMS) program. A retrospective review of all complaints received during three consecutive years (1990-1992) in a centralized EMS system serving a large municipality (population 2 million). All cases were categorized by year, source, and nature of the complaint. In the three study years, EMS responded to 416,892 incidents with nearly a half-million patient contacts. Concurrently, 371 complaints were received (incidence of 1.12 per thousand); 132 in 1990, 129 in 1991, and 110 in 1992. Most complaints involved either: 1) allegations of \"rude or unprofessional conduct\" (34%), 2) \"didn't take patient to the hospital\" (19%), or 3) \"problems with medical treatment\" (13%). Only 1.6% (n = 6) were response-time complaints. Other complaints included \"lost/damaged property,\" \"taken to the wrong hospital,\" \"inappropriate billing,\" and \"poor driving habits.\" The most common sources were patient's families (39%) and the patients themselves (30%). Only 7.8% were from health care providers. Reviews of complaints provide information regarding EMS system performance and reveal targets for quality improvement. For the EMS system examined, this study suggests a future training focus on interpersonal skills and heightened sensitivities, not only toward patients, but also toward bystanders and family members.\n\nWhich patients receive advice on diet and exercise?

Calcium is vital for coagulation, but hypocalcemia commonly occurs during massive transfusion due to citrate and serum calcium chelation. This study was conducted to determine the incidence of hypocalcemia and severe hypocalcemia in trauma patients who receive massive transfusion and to compare characteristics of patients with severe versus nonsevere hypocalcemia. This was a retrospective study of trauma patients who received massive transfusion between January 2009 and November 2013. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypocalcemia (ionized calcium [iCa] < 1.12 mmol/L) and severe hypocalcemia (iCa < 0.90 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes included calcium monitoring, calcium replacement, and correction of coagulopathy. There were 156 patients included; 152 (97%) experienced hypocalcemia, and 111 (71%) had severe hypocalcemia. Patients were stratified into iCa â¥ 0.90 (n = 45) and iCa < 0.90 (n = 111). There were no differences in demographics or baseline laboratories except the severe hypocalcemia group had higher baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (29.7 [23.7-50.9] versus 25.8 [22.3-35.9], P = 0.003), higher lactic acid (5.8 [4.1-9.8] versus 4.0 [3.1-7.8], P = 0.019), lower platelets (176 [108-237] versus 208 [169-272], P = 0.003), and lower pH (7.14 [6.98-7.28] versus 7.23 [7.14-7.33], P = 0.019). Mortality was higher in the severe hypocalcemia group (49% versus 24%, P = 0.007). Patients in the iCa < 0.90 group received more blood products (34 [23-58] versus 22 [18-30] units, P < 0.001), and calcium chloride (4 [2-7] versus 3 [1-4] g, P = 0.002), but there was no difference in duration of MTP or final iCa. Neither group reached a median iCa > 1.12. Hypocalcemia is common during MTP, and vigilant monitoring is warranted. Research is needed to effectively manage hypocalcemia during massive transfusion.

The study of biologic and immunomodulator naive patients in Crohn's disease (SONIC), advocates combining infliximab with an immunomodulator in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Unfortunately, combined immunosuppression increases risk for HSTCL. We herein review all cases of HSTCL reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients receiving TNF-Î± inhibitors. Individual reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database for lymphomas from the biological agents - infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab, and etanercept were downloaded and analyzed with Microsoft Access. Full reports for all identified HSTCL cases were obtained from the FDA. Twenty-five cases of HSTCL were identified. Twenty-two (88%) patients had inflammatory bowel disease and three had rheumatoid arthritis. Four cases (16%) were in women and four patients were above 65 years of age. Twenty-four cases (96%) also received an immunomodulator (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Two patients received adalimumab alone. HSTCL is no longer restricted to the previously identified risk group of young male patients, but can also occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, females and older adults receiving TNF-Î± inhibitors and immunomodulators. Improved disease outcomes using combination therapy should be tempered by the risk of developing HSTCL.\n\nIntegrated billing and accounts receivable management system needed to maximize payments and cope with managed care.\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, J; Wold, D; Sullivan, T\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe billing and accounts receivable management process in medical practices today has evolved into a multidisciplinary function. This function requires efficient, coordinated performance by physicians and all staff members, from the point of initial patient contact through aggressive follow-up on delinquent payments for services rendered. Offices with deficient or nonexistent billing and accounts receivable management systems typically experience collection ratios that are less than industry norms. They also experience poor cash flow and unnecessary overhead costs. To avoid costly inefficiencies and ensure that it maximizes payments from third-party payors and patients, a medical practice must have an integrated billing and accounts receivable management system that includes components outlined in this article.\n\nPatiromer in patients with kidney disease and hyperkalemia receiving RAAS inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeir, Matthew R; Bakris, George L; Bushinsky, David A; Mayo, Martha R; Garza, Dahlia; Stasiv, Yuri; Wittes, Janet; Christ-Schmidt, Heidi; Berman, Lance; Pitt, Bertram\n\n2015-01-15\n\nHyperkalemia increases the risk of death and limits the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in high-risk patients. We assessed the safety and efficacy of patiromer, a nonabsorbed potassium binder, in a multicenter, prospective trial. Patients with chronic kidney disease who were receiving RAAS inhibitors and who had serum potassium levels of 5.1 to less than 6.5 mmol per liter received patiromer (at an initial dose of 4.2 g or 8.4 g twice a day) for 4 weeks (initial treatment phase); the primary efficacy end point was the mean change in the serum potassium level from baseline to week 4. Eligible patients at the end of week 4 (those with a baseline potassium level of 5.5 to <6.5 mmol per liter in whom the level decreased to 3.8 to <5.1 mmol per liter) entered an 8-week randomized withdrawal phase in which they were randomly assigned to continue patiromer or switch to placebo; the primary efficacy end point was the between-group difference in the median change in the serum potassium level over the first 4 weeks of that phase. In the initial treatment phase, among 237 patients receiving patiromer who had at least one potassium measurement at a scheduled visit after day 3, the mean (Â±SE) change in the serum potassium level was -1.01Â±0.03 mmol per liter (P<0.001). At week 4, 76% (95% confidence interval, 70 to 81) of the patients had reached the target potassium level (3.8 to <5.1 mmol per liter). Subsequently, 107 patients were randomly assigned to patiromer (55 patients) or placebo (52 patients) for the randomized withdrawal phase. The median increase in the potassium level from baseline of that phase was greater with placebo than with patiromer (P<0.001); a recurrence of hyperkalemia (potassium level, â¥5.5 mmol per liter) occurred in 60% of the patients in the placebo group as compared with 15% in the patiromer group through week 8 (P<0.001). Mild-to-moderate constipation was the most common adverse event (in 11% of the patients\n\nPatients With Brain Tumors: Who Receives Postacute Occupational Therapy Services?\n\nPubMed\n\nChan, Vincy; Xiong, Chen; Colantonio, Angela\n\n2015-01-01\n\nData on the utilization of occupational therapy among patients with brain tumors have been limited to those with malignant tumors and small samples of patients outside North America in specialized palliative care settings. We built on this research by examining the characteristics of patients with brain tumors who received postacute occupational therapy services in Ontario, Canada, using health care administrative data. Between fiscal years 2004-2005 and 2008-2009, 3,199 patients with brain tumors received occupational therapy services in the home care setting after hospital discharge; 12.4% had benign brain tumors, 78.2% had malignant brain tumors, and 9.4% had unspecified brain tumors. However, patients with benign brain tumors were older (mean age=63.3 yr), and a higher percentage were female (65.2%). More than 90% of patients received in-home occupational therapy services. Additional research is needed to examine the significance of these differences and to identify factors that influence access to occupational therapy services in the home care setting.

Serial surveillance cultures of the nasal passages, oropharynx and feces performed twice a week showed that patients who received the former regimen had higher elimination rates and significantly lower acquisition rates (p = 0.027) for aerobic gram-negative bacilli than did patients who received the latter regimen. However, therapy with moxalactam plus ticarcillin also resulted in significantly higher acquisition rates for yeasts (p = 0.004). This was associated with a significantly higher fungal superinfection rate among these patients than among those who received tobramycin plus ticarcillin (40% v. 16%) (p less than 0.05). Moxalactam plus ticarcillin therapy created a greater microbial ecologic vacuum by the elimination of intestinal anaerobes, which, in turn, permitted fungal colonization and an increased risk of superinfection. Our results support the recommendation that an antipseudomonal penicillin plus an aminoglycoside be selected as empiric therapy for suspected infection in febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer. Such a regimen would spare the anaerobic intestinal microflora, thereby reducing the risk of fungal colonization and infection.

However, diagnoses of depression defined by current diagnostic criteria may not be more common in patients receiving beta-blockers than in patients with the same medical disorder receiving other medications. Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization for evaluation of chest pain received a semi-structured diagnostic psychiatric interview. Twenty-one percent of the patients receiving beta-blockers and 33 percent of the patients receiving medications other than beta-blockers met the current American Psychiatric Association criteria for major depressive disorder (DSM-III) (p = NS). The mean heart rate and state anxiety scores for patients taking beta-blockers were significantly lower than those measured in patients taking medications other than beta-blockers. No other medical or demographic differences were observed between the two groups. Despite the methodologic limitations of the study, there does not appear to be a difference in the point prevalence of depression between patients receiving beta-blockers and those receiving other medications.\n\nSugammadex Improves Neuromuscular Function in Patients Receiving Perioperative Steroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzer, A B; Bolat, E; Erhan, O L; Kilinc, M; Demirel, I; Toprak, G Caglar\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSugammadex has steroid-encapsulating effect. This study was undertaken to assess whether the clinical efficacy of sugammadex was altered by the administration of steroids. Sixty patients between 18 and 60 years of age with the American Society of Anesthesiologists I-IV and undergoing elective direct laryngoscopy/biopsy were included in this study. Patients were assigned to two groups based on the intraoperative steroid use: those who received steroid (Group S) and who did not (Group C). After standard general anesthesia, patients were monitored with the train of four (TOF) monitoring. The preferred steroid and its dose, timing of steroid administration, and TOF value before and after sugammadex as well as the time to recovery (TOF of 0.9) were recorded. SPSS software version 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. There is no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of age, gender, preoperative medication use, and TOF ratio just before administering sugammadex. The reached time to TOF 0.9 after sugammadex administration was significantly shorter in Group S than Group C (P < 0.05). A within-group comparison in Group S showed no difference in TOF ratio immediately before sugammadex as well as the dose of sugammadex in those who received prednisolone; time to TOF 0.9 was higher in prednisolone receivers as compared to dexamethasone receivers (P < 0.05). In patients receiving steroids, and particularly dexamethasone, an earlier reversal of neuromuscular block by sugammadex was found, in contrast with what one expect. Further studies are required to determine the cause of this effect which is probably due to a potential interaction between sugammadex and steroids.\n\nUse of complementary and alternative medicine among patients with cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy in Taiwan.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Che; Chien, Li-Yin; Tai, Chen-Jei\n\n2008-05-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence and types of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) used among patients with cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy in Taiwan. This study was a cross-sectional survey. The study participants were 160 patients with cancer receiving outpatient chemotherapy at a medical center in northern Taiwan. The vast majority of the participants reported CAM use (n = 157, 98.1%). The two most common groups of CAM used were \"biologically based therapies\" (77.5%) and \"mind-body interventions\" (60.6%). Fifteen percent (15.3%) of patients took grapeseed and ginseng, which might affect the efficacy of some chemotherapy regimens. Fourteen percent (14.4%) of patients did not know the name of the herbs they took. The most commonly reported reasons for CAM use were to boost the immune system (55.4%) and relieve stress (53.5%). Approximately two thirds of patients (66.2%) had never informed their physicians of CAM use. This survey revealed a high prevalence of CAM use among patients with cancer receiving out-patient chemotherapy in Taiwan. The types of CAM used by patients with cancer in Taiwan differed from those in Western countries. Health professionals need to be cautious about the potential herb-drug interactions.\n\nPrevalence and characteristics of patients with metastatic cancer who receive no anticancer therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmall, Alexander C; Tsao, Che-Kai; Moshier, Erin L; Gartrell, Benjamin A; Wisnivesky, Juan P; Godbold, James H; Smith, Cardinale B; Sonpavde, Guru; Oh, William K; Galsky, Matthew D\n\n2012-12-01\n\nA subset of patients who present with metastatic solid tumors never receive anticancer therapy. Reasons may include poor functional status, comorbidities, and patient preference. To the authors' knowledge, the prevalence and characteristics of this population have not previously been described. The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed with metastatic (stage IV according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer) solid tumors (including those of the breast, cervix, colon, and kidney; small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; and tumors of the prostate, rectum, and uterus) who received neither radiotherapy nor systemic therapy. Log-binomial regression analysis was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the percentage of untreated to treated patients with stage IV cancer. Between 2000 and 2008, 773,233 patients with stage IV cancer were identified, 159,284 of whom (20.6%; 95% confidence interval, 20.5%-20.7%) received no anticancer therapy. Patients with NSCLC accounted for 55% of the untreated population. Patients with cancers of the kidney and lung had the highest rates of no treatment at 25.5% and 24.0%, respectively, whereas patients with prostate cancer had the lowest rate of no treatment at 11.1%. Across all cancer types, older age (PR range, 1.37-1.49; all P < .001), black race (PR range, 1.05-1.32; all P < .001), lack of medical insurance (PR range, 1.47-2.46; all P < .001), and lower income (except for cancer of the uterus; PR range, 0.91-0.98 for every $10,000-increase in income [all P < .001]) were associated with a lack of treatment. Approximately 20% of patients who present with stage IV solid tumors do not receive anticancer therapy. Although there are likely multiple reasons for this lack of treatment, including appropriate indications, these findings have potential implications with regard to health care policy and access to care.

When patients receive surgical intervention and general anesthesia, they are always exposed to stimulation to bronchial mucosa. Prevention method of bronchial asthma attack during surgical intervention is not established yet. We investigated that clinical course of patients with bronchial asthma who received general anesthesia and surgical intervention. Seventy-six patients with bronchial asthma were received general anesthesia and surgical intervention from 1993 to 1998. Twenty-four patients were mild asthmatic patients, 39 were moderate asthmatic patients and 13 were severe asthmatic patients. Preoperative treatment for preventing asthma attack was as follows; Eight patients were given intravenous infusion of aminophylline before operation. Fifty-two patients were given intravenous infusion of aminophylline and hydrocortisone before operation. Three patients were given intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone for consecutive 3 days before operation. Thirteen patients were given no treatment for preventing asthma attack. One patient was suffered from asthma attack during operation. She was given no preventing treatment for asthma attack before operation. Three patients were suffered from asthma attack after operation. No wound dehiscence was observed in all patients. To prevent asthma attack during operation, intravenous infusion of steroid before operation is recommended, when patients with asthma receive general anesthesia and surgical intervention.\n\nIodine Supplementation for Pediatric Patients Receiving Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantoro, Jonathan D; Nespor, Colleen; Poole, Robert L; Kerner, John A\n\n2016-04-01\n\nPatients dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) are among a group at risk of developing iodine deficiency. Supplementation with iodine in this population has been debated in a number of studies, resulting in variable clinical practices. The Committee on Clinical Practice Issues of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition recommends a dose of 1 mcg/kg/d of parenteral iodine for patients receiving PN. At our institution, PN trace elements do not include iodine, although this is not the case internationally. Our study sought to assess iodine levels and thyroid function in a cohort of PN-dependent pediatric patients. A retrospective analysis studied 32 pediatric patients with a variety of medical diagnoses who received PN as a primary means of nutrition for 6 months or longer. Patients received variable proportions of their total caloric intake as PN, which ranged from 14%-100%. Iodine and thyroid function levels were obtained by serum sampling. No patient in our cohort of 32 demonstrated thyroid dysfunction or developed iodine deficiency. The length of time on PN and the percentage of total nutrition intake as PN were not associated with iodine levels (P < .89 and P < .73, respectively). There were no significant associations between age (P < .342), clinical diagnosis (P < .46), or sex (P < .43) on iodine status. There were no incidences of abnormal iodine levels in our cohort. Our study suggests that pediatric patients older than 6 months receiving PN may not benefit from iodine supplementation, but further investigation is needed.

T.; Appleby, Niamh; Bruce, David; Kriek, Neline; Nock, Sophie H.; Sage, Tanya; Hughes, Craig E.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib induces platelet dysfunction and causes increased risk of bleeding. Off-target inhibition of Tec is believed to contribute to platelet dysfunction and other side effects of ibrutinib. The second-generation Btk inhibitor acalabrutinib was developed with improved specificity for Btk over Tec. We investigated platelet function in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving ibrutinib or acalabrutinib by aggregometry and by measuring thrombus formation on collagen under arterial shear. Both patient groups had similarly dysfunctional aggregation responses to collagen and collagen-related peptide, and comparison with mechanistic experiments in which platelets from healthy donors were treated with the Btk inhibitors suggested that both drugs inhibit platelet Btk and Tec at physiological concentrations. Only ibrutinib caused dysfunctional thrombus formation, whereas size and morphology of thrombi following acalabrutinib treatment were of normal size and morphology. We found that ibrutinib but not acalabrutinib inhibited Src family kinases, which have a critical role in platelet adhesion to collagen that is likely to underpin unstable thrombus formation observed in ibrutinib patients. We found that platelet function was enhanced by increasing levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) ex vivo by addition of intermediate purity FVIII (Haemate P) to blood from patients, resulting in consistently larger thrombi. We conclude that acalabrutinib avoids major platelet dysfunction associated with ibrutinib therapy, and platelet function may be enhanced in patients with B-cell NHL by increasing plasma VWF and FVIII.

Published pediatric frequent dialysis experiences demonstrate similar improvement but all used conventional HD machines, which employ a treated municipal water supply, thereby frequently exposing patients to proinflammatory components. We report our pediatric experience with six-times-weekly HD using the NxStage system, which uses sterile dialysis fluid to provide dialysis in the home or center setting. Four patients (weight range 38-61.4 kg) completed the 16-week study. Patients exhibited progressive reductions in casual pretreatment systolic and diastolic blood pressures, discontinuation of antihypertensive medications, and decreased blood pressure load by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Mean serum phosphorus improved without change in phosphorus binder medication, and all three patients with a normalized protein catabolic rate <1 g/kg per day at the beginning of the study improved to a normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) of >1.1 g/kg per day. Patients reported no adverse effects. Variable changes in proinflammatory cytokine levels were observed. We suggest that frequent HD with the NxStage system be considered for children who would benefit from home-based maintenance dialysis.\n\nPlasma Aluminum Concentrations in Pediatric Patients Receiving Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition.\n\nPubMed\n\nCourtney-Martin, Glenda; Kosar, Christina; Campbell, Alison; Avitzur, Yaron; Wales, Paul W; Steinberg, Karen; Harrison, Debra; Chambers, Kathryn\n\n2015-07-01\n\nPatients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (PN) are at increased risk of aluminium (Al) toxicity because of bypass of the gastrointestinal tract during PN infusion. Complications of Al toxicity include metabolic bone disease (MBD), Al-associated encephalopathy in adults, and impaired neurological development in preterm infants. Unlike the United States, there are no regulations regarding Al content of large- and small-volume parenterals in Canada. We, therefore, aimed to present our data on plasma Al concentration and Al intake from our cohort of pediatric patients receiving long-term PN. Plasma Al concentration was retrospectively gathered from the patient charts of all 27 patients with intestinal failure (IF) receiving long-term PN at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, and compared with age- and sex-matched controls recruited for comparison. In addition, Al concentration was measured in PN samples collected from 10 randomly selected patients with IF and used to determine their Al intake. The plasma Al concentration of patients with IF receiving long-term PN was significantly higher than that of control participants (1195 Â± 710 vs 142 Â± 63 nmol/L; P < .0001). In the subgroup of 10 patients for whom Al intake from their PN solution was determined, mean Â± SD Al intake from PN was 15.4 Â± 15 Âµg/kg, 3 times the Food and Drug Administration upper recommended intake level, and Al intake was significantly related to plasma Al concentration (P = .02, r (2) = 0.52). Pediatric patients receiving long-term PN for IF in Canada are at risk for Al toxicity.

In Libya there are several barriers to AVF creation including lack of adequate preparation for dialysis and surgical services. We aimed to conduct the first comprehensive study of VA utilisation in HD patients in Libya. A prospective observational study included all adult patients receiving HD treatment in 25 HD facilities in Libya from May 2009 to Nov 2011. Researchers gathered data regarding VA through interviews with staff and patients as well as medical records. Patients with definitive VA were re-interviewed after 1 year. At baseline the majority of patients (91.9%; n=1573) were using permanent VA in the form of AVF or arteriovenous graft. Patients with permanent VA were more likely to be male and less likely to be diabetic than those with CVCs. Most patients had commenced HD using a temporary CVC (91.8%). VA-related complications were: thrombosis (46.7%), aneurysm (22.6%), infection (11.5%) and haemorrhage (10.2%). Incident VA thrombosis was reported by 14.7% in 1 year. Independent risk factors for incident thrombosis were female gender and diabetes. Hospitalisation for VA related complications was reported by 31.4%. Few patients in Libya initiate HD with definitive VA, but most achieve it thereafter. Improved dialysis preparation and increased provision of surgical services are required to increase the proportion of patients initiating HD with definitive VA and should be a priority in rebuilding health services in Libya after the recent conflict.\n\nAssessing Selenium, Manganese, and Iodine Status in Pediatric Patients Receiving Parenteral Nutrition.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnsen, Jacob Clarke; Reese, Susan Anne; Mackay, Mark; Anderson, Collin R; Jackson, Daniel; Paul, Irasema Libertad\n\n2017-08-01\n\nPediatric patients who are receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) unsupplemented with trace minerals can become deficient. Due to shortages in trace mineral products and the 2004 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition report stating that individualized trace element supplementation may be warranted, a review was conducted concerning the trace minerals selenium (Se), manganese (Mn), and iodine (I). A retrospective review of pediatric patients receiving PN that contained Se and Mn was conducted to determine if a difference existed between them and patients receiving PN without Se and Mn. Statistical analysis was done to assess a difference between trace mineral levels and the time to deficiency between supplemented and unsupplemented patients. Unsupplemented I patients had urine I levels assessed to determine deficiencies in patients receiving PN. Plasma Se levels were measured at a mean of 20 days for supplemented patients (n = 131) and 19 days for nonsupplemented patients (n = 57) with no difference between groups ( P = .2973). Plasma Mn levels were measured at a mean of 28 days, showing no statistical difference ( P = .721). Of the 177 nonsupplemented I patients, 74% demonstrated I deficiencies without supplementation. Time to the development of a Se, Mn, or I deficiency is important to guide supplementation of exclusive PN in children when trace mineral products are short in supply. Our retrospective experience supports assessment of the trace minerals Se at 21 days and Mn at 30 days. It also suggests that some pediatric patients receiving PN are deficient in I.\n\nOut-of-hospital mortality among patients receiving methadone for noncancer pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nRay, Wayne A; Chung, Cecilia P; Murray, Katherine T; Cooper, William O; Hall, Kathi; Stein, C Michael\n\n2015-03-01\n\nGrowing methadone use in pain management has raised concerns regarding its safety relative to other long-acting opioids. Methadone hydrochloride may increase the risk for lethal respiratory depression related to accidental overdose and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. To compare the risk of out-of-hospital death in patients receiving methadone for noncancer pain with that in comparable patients receiving sustained-release (SR) morphine sulfate. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using Tennessee Medicaid records from 1997 through 2009. The cohort included patients receiving morphine SR or methadone who were aged 30 to 74 years, did not have cancer or another life-threatening illness, and were not in a hospital or nursing home. At cohort entry, 32â742 and 6014 patients had filled a prescription for morphine SR or methadone, respectively. The patients' median age was 48 years, 57.9% were female, and comparable proportions had received cardiovascular, psychotropic, and other musculoskeletal medications. Nearly 90% of the patients received the opioid for back pain or other musculoskeletal pain. The median doses prescribed for morphine SR and methadone were 90 mg/d and 40 mg/d, respectively. The primary study end point was out-of-hospital mortality, given that opioid-related deaths typically occur outside the hospital. There were 477 deaths during 28â699 person-years of follow-up (ie, 166 deaths per 10â000 person-years). After control for study covariates, patients receiving methadone had a 46% increased risk of death during the follow-up period, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.17-1.83; Pâ<â.001), resulting in 72 (95% CI, 27-130) excess deaths per 10â000 person-years of follow-up. Methadone doses of 20 mg/d or less, the lowest dose quartile, were associated with an increased risk of death (HR,â1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.51, Pâ=â.046) relative to a comparable dose of morphine SR (<60 mg/d). The increased risk of death\n\nRomiplostim for Immune Thrombocytopenia in Neuroblastoma Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nFassel, Hannah; Bussel, James B; Roberts, Stephen S; Modak, Shakeel\n\n2018-04-20\n\nThrombocytopenia, a serious complication of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in cancer patients, is managed with platelet transfusions until recovery of platelet counts. However, children receiving chemotherapy can rarely develop immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that is refractory to transfused platelets. This limits the ability to achieve adequate platelet counts and administer further myelosuppressive chemotherapy safely, especially if first-line ITP therapy is ineffective. We report 2 cases of intravenous immunoglobulin refractory ITP in children receiving chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma. ITP was successfully treated with the thrombopoietin-receptor-agonist romiplostim, allowing safe and timely continuation of antineuroblastoma therapies in these high-risk patients.\n\nSolar receiver performance of point focusing collector system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWu, Y.

The effects of variation in the ratio of receiver area to aperture area are considered.\n\nSurvival benefit of zoledronic Acid in postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Sung Gwe; Kim, Sung Hyun; Lee, Hak Min; Lee, Seung Ah; Jeong, Joon\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA growing body of evidence indicates that zoledronic acid (ZA) can improve the clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer and low estrogen levels. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the survival benefit of ZA administration in postmenopausal Korean women with breast cancer who were also receiving aromatase inhibitors. Between January 2004 and December 2010, 235 postmenopausal breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy were investigated. All patients were postmenopausal, as confirmed by laboratory tests. Of these patients, 77 received adjuvant upfront ZA for at least 1 year in addition to conventional adjuvant treatment. The remaining 158 patients never received ZA and were treated according to the St. Gallen guidelines. The baseline characteristics for ZA treatment were not different between the two groups. The median follow-up time was 62 months, and the patients who received ZA in addition to aromatase inhibitors showed a better recurrence-free survival compared to those who received aromatase inhibitors alone (p=0.035). On multivariate analysis, the patients who received ZA showed a better recurrence-free survival independent of the tumor size, nodal status, progesterone receptor, and histological grade. For this model, Harrell c index was 0.743. The hazard ratio of ZA use for recurrence-free survival was 0.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.99). Our findings suggest that upfront use of ZA as part of adjuvant treatment can offer a survival benefit to postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitor treatment.\n\nCryptococcal infections in two patients receiving ibrutinib therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nStankowicz, Matthew; Banaszynski, Megan; Crawford, Russell\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCryptococcal infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Reports of these infections in patients on small molecular kinase inhibitors have not been widely reported in clinical trials. We describe one case of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis and one case of cryptococcal pneumonia in two patients who were receiving ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Despite different sites of cryptococcal infection, both patients had similar presentations of acute illness. Patient 1 was worked up for health care-associated pneumonia, as well as acute sinusitis prior to the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. He also had a more complex past medical history than patient 2. Patient 2 developed atrial fibrillation from ibrutinib prior to admission for presumed health care-associated pneumonia. Cryptococcal antigen testing was done sooner in this patient due to patient receiving high-dose steroids for the treatment of underlying hemolytic anemia. We conclude that patients who develop acute illness while receiving ibrutinib should be considered for cryptococcal antigen testing.\n\nDeterminants of survival in patients receiving dialysis in Libya.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlashek, Wiam A; McIntyre, Christopher W; Taal, Maarten W\n\n2013-04-01\n\nMaintenance dialysis is associated with reduced survival when compared with the general population. In Libya, information about outcomes on dialysis is scarce. This study, therefore, aimed to provide the first comprehensive analysis of survival in Libyan dialysis patients. This prospective multicenter study included all patients in Libya who had been receiving dialysis for >90 days in June 2009. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected upon enrollment and survival status after 1 year was determined. Two thousand two hundred seventy-three patients in 38 dialysis centers were followed up for 1 year. The majority were receiving hemodialysis (98.8%). Sixty-seven patients were censored due to renal transplantation, and 46 patients were lost to follow-up. Thus, 2159 patients were followed up for 1 year. Four hundred fifty-eight deaths occurred, (crude annual mortality rate of 21.2%). Of these, 31% were due to ischemic heart disease, 16% cerebrovascular accidents, and 16% due to infection. Annual mortality rate was 0% to 70% in different dialysis centers. Best survival was in age group 25 to 34 years. Binary logistic regr"
