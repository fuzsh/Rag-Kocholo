Methods 223 patients from the Registro EspaÃ±ol de Lupus Eritematoso SistÃ©mico inception cohort were studied. The cumulative dose of prednisone-1 and prednisone-2â12 were calculated and recoded into a four-level categorical variable: no prednisone, low dose (up to 7.5â mg/day), medium dose (up to 30â mg/day) and high dose (over 30â mg/day). The association between the cumulative prednisone-1 and prednisone-2â12 doses was tested. We analysed whether the four-level prednisone-1 categorical variable was an independent predictor of an average dose >7.5â mg/day of prednisone-2â12. Adjusting variables included age, immunosuppressives, antimalarials, methyl-prednisolone pulses, lupus nephritis and baseline SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Results Within the first month, 113 patients (51%) did not receive any prednisone, 24 patients (11%) received average low doses, 46 patients (21%) received medium doses and 40 patients (18%) received high doses. There was a strong association between prednisone-1 and prednisone-2â12 dose categories (p<0.001). The cumulative prednisone-1 dose was directly associated with the cumulative prednisone-2â12 dose (p<0.001). Compared with patients on no prednisone, patients taking medium (adjusted OR 5.27, 95% CI 2.18 to 12.73) or high-dose prednisone-1 (adjusted OR 10.5, 95% CI 3.8 to 29.17) were more likely to receive prednisone-2â12 doses of >7.5â mg/day, while patients receiving low-dose prednisone-1 were not (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 0. 0.38 to 5.2). If the analysis was restricted to the 158 patients with a baseline SLEDAI of â¥6, the model did not change. Conclusion The dose of prednisone during the first month after the diagnosis of SLE is an independent predictor of prednisone burden during the following\n\nCustirsen in combination with docetaxel and prednisone for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (SYNERGY trial): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nChi, Kim N; Higano, Celestia S; Blumenstein, Brent; Ferrero, Jean-Marc; Reeves, James; Feyerabend, Susan; Gravis, Gwenaelle; Merseburger, Axel S; Stenzl, Arnulf; Bergman, Andries M; Mukherjee, Som D; Zalewski, Pawel; Saad, Fred; Jacobs, Cindy; Gleave, Martin; de Bono, Johann S\n\n2017-04-01\n\nClusterin is a chaperone protein associated with treatment resistance and upregulated by apoptotic stressors such as chemotherapy. Custirsen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits clusterin production. The aim of the SYNERGY trial was to investigate the effect of custirsen in combination with docetaxel and prednisone on overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. SYNERGY was a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial set at 134 study centres in 12 countries. Patients were eligible for participation if they had: metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and had received no previous chemotherapy; prostate-specific antigen greater than 5 ng/mL; and a Karnofsky performance score of 70% or higher. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 centrally to either the docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen combination or docetaxel and prednisone alone. Patients were not masked to treatment allocation. Randomisation was stratified by opioid use for cancer-related pain and radiographic evidence of progression. All patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously with 5 mg of prednisone orally twice daily. Patients assigned docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen received weekly doses of custirsen 640 mg intravenously after three loading doses of 640 mg. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Patients who received at least one study dose were included in the safety analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01188187. The trial is completed and final analyses are reported here. Between Dec 10, 2010, and Nov 7, 2012, 1022 patients were enrolled to the trial, of whom 510 were assigned docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen and 512 were allocated docetaxel and prednisone.

Since the role of daily corticosteroids in improving cabazitaxel efficacy or ameliorating its safety profile has not been adequately investigated so far, we compared outcomes of patients receiving cabazitaxel with or without daily corticosteroids in a retrospective single-Institution cohort of mCRPC patients. Patients and methods: Medical records of deceased patients with documented mCRPC treated with cabazitaxel following prior docetaxel between January, 2011 and January, 2017 were reviewed at the single participating center. Patients who were receiving daily doses of systemic corticosteroids other than low dose daily prednisone or prednisolone (<= 10 mg a day) were excluded. The primary end point of this analysis was overall survival (OS). Secondary end-points were exposure to cabazitaxel as well as incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate prednisone use and other variables as potentially prognostic for overall survival. Results: Overall, among 91 patients, 57 patients received cabazitaxel concurrently with low dose prednisone and 34 patients did not receive concurrent prednisone. The median overall survival of the population was 9.8 months (interquartile range, 9 to 14). Patients receiving prednisone had an overall survival of 9 months (interquartile range, 8 to 12) vs.14 months (interquartile range, 9.4 to 16.7) for patients not treated with prednisone. Approximately 45% of patients had a >30% PSA decline at 12 weeks. Prednisone use was not significantly prognostic for overall survival or PSA decline â¥30% rates on regression analyses. Importantly, a >30% PSA decline at 12, but not at 3, 6, 9 weeks, was prognostic for improved survival at multivariate analysis Conclusions\n\nThe Influence of Prednisone on the Efficacy of Cabazitaxel in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBuonerba, Carlo; Sonpavde, Guru; Vitrone, Francesca; Bosso, Davide; Puglia, Livio; Izzo, Michela; Iaccarino, Simona; Scafuri, Luca; Muratore, Margherita; Foschini, Francesca; Mucci, Brigitta; Tortora, Vincenzo; Pagliuca, Martina; Ribera, Dario; Riccio, Vittorio; Morra, Rocco; Mosca, Mirta; Cesarano, Nicola; Di Costanzo, Ileana; De Placido, Sabino; Di Lorenzo, Giuseppe\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Cabazitaxel is a second-generation taxane that is approved for use with concomitant low dose daily prednisone in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after docetaxel failure.

Prospective case study. 24 dogs with severe primary IMT PROCEDURE: All dogs received immunosuppressive doses of prednisone (1.5 to 2 mg/kg [0.7 to 0.9 mg/lb] of body weight, PO, q 12 h). In addition, 12 dogs received a single dose of vincristine (0.02 mg/kg [0.01 mg/lb], IV). Platelet count, transfusion requirement, and outcome were monitored. A response was defined as an increase in platelet count to > or = 40,000/microl. Dogs in the prednisone group that failed to respond received 1 dose of vincristine on day 7. Dogs that received prednisone and vincristine had a significantly faster increase in platelet count to > or = 40,000 platelets/microl than dogs that received prednisone alone (mean +/- SD, 4.9 +/- 1.1 vs 6.8 +/- 4.5 days, respectively). A similarly rapid response was observed in dogs that received vincristine on day 7 after treatment with prednisone alone failed. Furthermore, duration of hospitalization was reduced in the vincristine group, compared with the prednisone group (5.4 +/- 0.3 vs 7.3 +/- 0.5 days, respectively). No adverse effects attributable to vincristine were observed in any dog. Administration of combined vincristine and prednisone is associated with more rapid increase in platelet numbers and shortened duration of hospitalization in dogs with IMT, compared with use of prednisone alone. Early use of vincristine seems warranted in dogs with severe primary IMT.\n\nEffect of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan and theophylline in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nChi, K N; Tolcher, A; Lee, P; Rosen, P J; Kollmannsberger, C K; Papadopoulos, K P; Patnaik, A; Molina, A; Jiao, J; Pankras, C; Kaiser, B; Bernard, A; Tran, N; Acharya, M\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo assess the effect of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan HBr (CYP2D6 substrate) and theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Men with progressive metastatic mCRPC who failed gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy and â¥1 lines of chemotherapy were enrolled. Patients received two doses of dextromethorphan HBr-30 mg (n = 18; group A) or theophylline-100 mg (n = 16; group B) under fasting conditions; one dose on cycle 1, day -8, and the other dose on cycle 1, day 8. Only patients with extensive CYP2D6 metabolizing status were assigned to group A. All patients received continuous daily oral abiraterone acetate (1,000 mg) plus prednisone (10 mg) starting on cycle 1, day 1. Coadministration of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone increased the systemic exposure of dextromethorphan by approximately 100%. Ratios of geometric means for maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) (275.36%) and area under plasma concentration-time curves from time 0 to 24 h (AUC(24h)) (268.14%) of dextromethorphan were outside the bioequivalence limit. The pharmacokinetics of theophylline was unaltered following coadministration of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Ratios of geometric means [C(max); 102.36% and AUC(24h); 108.03%] of theophylline exposure parameters were within the bioequivalence limit. The safety profile of abiraterone acetate was consistent with reported toxicities. Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone increased the exposure of dextromethorphan, suggesting a need for caution when coadministrating with known CYP2D6 substrates. The pharmacokinetics of theophylline was unaffected when coadministered with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.\n\nPhase III, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter Trial Comparing Orteronel (TAK-700) Plus Prednisone With Placebo Plus Prednisone in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer That Has Progressed During or After Docetaxel-Based Therapy: ELM-PC 5\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFizazi, Karim; Jones, Robert; Oudard, Stephane; Efstathiou, Eleni; Saad, Fred; de Wit, Ronald; De Bono, Johann; Cruz, Felipe Melo; Fountzilas, George; Ulys, Albertas; Carcano, Flavio; Agarwal, Neeraj; Agus, David; Bellmunt, Joaquim; Petrylak, Daniel P.; Lee, Shih-Yuan; Webb, Iain J.; Tejura, Bindu; Borgstein, Niels; Dreicer, Robert\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, nonsteroidal, reversible, selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor. This study examined orteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel therapy. Patients and Methods In our study, 1,099 men were randomly assigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and non-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain InventoryâShort Form worst pain score. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points (radiographic progression-free survival [rPFS], â¥ 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primary end point analysis was significant. Results The study was unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundary. The median OS was 17.0 months versus 15.2 months with orteronel-prednisone versus placebo-prednisone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.886; 95% CI, 0.739 to 1.062; P = .190). Improved rPFS was observed with orteronel-prednisone (median, 8.3 v 5.7 months; HR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.653 to 0.885; P < .001). Orteronel-prednisone showed advantages over placebo-prednisone in PSA50 rate (25% v 10%, P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median, 5.5 v 2.9 months, P < .001) but not pain response rate (12% v 9%; P = .128). Adverse events (all grades) were generally more frequent with orteronel-prednisone, including nausea (42% v 26%), vomiting (36% v 17%), fatigue (29% v 23%), and increased amylase (14% v 2%). Conclusion Our study did not meet the primary end point of OS. Longer rPFS and a higher PSA50 rate with orteronel-prednisone indicate antitumor activity.

Limited information exists regarding response to subsequent androgen signaling-directed therapies following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with mCRPC. We investigated clinical outcomes associated with subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (55 patients) and enzalutamide (33 patients) in a post hoc analysis of COU-AA-302. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was assessed. Median time to PSA progression was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PSA response rate (â¥50% PSA decline, unconfirmed) was 44% and 67%, respectively. The median time to PSA progression was 3.9 mo (range 2.6-not estimable) for subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and 2.8 mo (range 1.8-not estimable) for subsequent enzalutamide. The majority of patients (68%) received intervening chemotherapy before subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide. While acknowledging the limitations of post hoc analyses and high censoring (>75%) in both treatment groups, these results suggest that subsequent therapy with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide for patients who progressed on abiraterone acetate is associated with limited clinical benefit. This analysis showed limited clinical benefit for subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following initial treatment with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. This analysis does not support prioritization of subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide following initial therapy with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone.

Retrospective analyses suggest some cross-resistance between these two drugs when used sequentially, but robust, prospective studies have not yet been reported. To fulfil a regulatory postregistration commitment by evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment. Multicentre, single-arm, open-label study, enrolled patients with progressing mCRPC after â¥24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment. All patients maintained castration therapy during the trial. Prior chemotherapy was allowed but not required. Patients received enzalutamide 160mg/d orally. The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and time-to-PSA progression. Safety data were also assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to descriptively analyse time-to-event endpoints. Overall, 214 patients received enzalutamide treatment, 145 of whom were chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 8.1 mo (95% confidence interval: 6.1-8.3); median overall survival had not been reached. Unconfirmed PSA response rate was 27% (48 of 181). Median time-to-PSA progression was 5.7 mo (95% confidence interval: 5.6-5.8). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (32%), decreased appetite (25%), asthenia (18%), back pain (17%), and arthralgia (16%). No seizures were reported. Enzalutamide showed antitumour activity in some patients with mCRPC who had previously progressed following â¥24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment. Patients with mCRPC who progressed on previous abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment, with or without prior chemotherapy\n\nPrednisone Pharmacokinetics During Pregnancy and Lactation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRyu, Rachel J; Easterling, Thomas R; Caritis, Steve N; Venkataramanan, Raman; Umans, Jason G; Ahmed, Mahmoud S; Clark, Shannon; Kantrowitz-Gordon, Ira; Hays, Karen; Bennett, Brooke; Honaker, Matthew T; Thummel, Kenneth E; Shen, Danny D; Hebert, Mary F\n\n2018-05-07\n\nTo evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of prednisone and its metabolite prednisolone in pregnant and lactating female subjects, 19 subjects received prednisone (4-40 mg/day orally) in early (nÂ =Â 3), mid (nÂ =Â 9), and late (nÂ =Â 13) pregnancy as well as postpartum with (nÂ =Â 2) and without (nÂ =Â 5) lactation. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over 1 dosing interval. Prednisone and its metabolite, prednisolone, steady-state noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. During pregnancy, prednisone apparent oral clearance increased with dose (35.1Â Â±Â 11.4 L/h with 5 mg, 52.6Â Â±Â 5.2 L/h with 10 mg, and 64.3Â Â±Â 6.9 L/h with 20 mg, PÂ =Â .001). Similarly, unbound prednisone apparent oral clearance increased with dose. In addition, prednisolone renal clearance increased with dose (0.3Â Â±Â 0.3 L/h with 5 mg, 0.5Â Â±Â 0.4 L/h with 10 mg, and 1.3Â Â±Â 1.1 L/h with 20 mg, PÂ =Â .002). Higher prednisone (rÂ =Â 0.57, P â¤Â .05) and prednisolone (rÂ =Â 0.75, P â¤Â .05) concentrations led to a higher percentage of unbound drug. Breast-milk/plasma area under the concentration-time curve ratios were 0.5-0.6 for prednisone and 0.02-0.03 for prednisolone. Relative infant doses were 0.35% to 0.53% and 0.09% to 0.18%, for prednisone and prednisolone, respectively. Prednisone and prednisolone exhibit dose- and concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics during pregnancy, and infant exposure to these agents via breast milk is minimal.

We evaluated the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1199 patients to receive either androgen-deprivation therapy plus abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily, given once daily as four 250-mg tablets) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) (the abiraterone group) or androgen-deprivation therapy plus dual placebos (the placebo group). The two primary end points were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. After a median follow-up of 30.4 months at a planned interim analysis (after 406 patients had died), the median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (not reached vs. 34.7 months) (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.76; P<0.001). The median length of radiographic progression-free survival was 33.0 months in the abiraterone group and 14.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.55; P<0.001). Significantly better outcomes in all secondary end points were observed in the abiraterone group, including the time until pain progression, next subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, initiation of chemotherapy, and prostate-specific antigen progression (P<0.001 for all comparisons), along with next symptomatic skeletal events (P=0.009). These findings led to the unanimous recommendation by the independent data and safety monitoring committee that the trial be unblinded and crossover be allowed for patients in the placebo group to receive abiraterone. Rates of grade 3 hypertension and hypokalemia were higher in the abiraterone group.

Patients with a poor prednisone response (PPR) have a poor event-free survival as compared to those with a good prednisone response (PGR). Causes of prednisone resistance are still not well understood. We hypothesized that GC resistance is an intrinsic feature of ALL cells which is reflected in the gene expression pattern and analyzed genome-wide gene expression using microarrays. A case-control study was performed comparing gene expression profiles from initial ALL samples of 20 patients with PPR and those of 20 patients with PGR. Differential gene expression of a subset of genes was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and validation was performed in a second independent patient sample (n=20). We identified 121 genes that clearly distinguished prednisone-resistant from sensitive ALL samples (FDR<5%, fold change>or=1.5). Differential gene expression of 21 of these genes could be validated in a second independent set. Of importance, there was a remarkable concordance of genes identified by comparing expression signatures of PPR and PGR cells at diagnosis and those previously described to be up- or downregulated in leukemic cells persisting under GC treatment. Thus, GC resistance seems at least in part to be an intrinsic feature of leukemic cells. Leukemic cells of patients with PPR are characterized by gene expression pattern which are similar to those of resistant cells persisting under glucocorticoid treatment.\n\nBudgetary impact on a U.S. health plan adopting abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nSorensen, Sonja; Ellis, Lorie; Wu, Ying; Hutchins, Valerie; Linnehan, John E; Senbetta, MekrÃ©\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAbiraterone acetate, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, received FDA approval in 2011 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel. To estimate the projected budgetary impact of adopting abiraterone for mCRPC patients from a U.S. health plan perspective. A decision analytic model compared mCRPC treatment cost before and after abiraterone acetate adoption based on a hypothetical 1,000,000-member plan. Plan mCRPC prevalence was derived from prostate cancer incidence reported in U.S. epidemiology statistics and disease progression data from published trials. Market shares for comparator mCRPC treatments (prednisone alone; cabazitaxel + prednisone; mitoxantrone + prednisone; docetaxel retreatment + prednisone) were derived from market research simulation. Abiraterone + prednisone uptake (8% - scenario 1 to 55% - scenario 3) was based on assumptions for illustrative purposes. Treatment costs were computed using prescribing information, treatment duration from phase III trials, and drug costs considering common U.S. cost listing and reimbursement schemes. Prevalence and costs of managing treatment-related toxicities were estimated from literature, treatment guidelines, and expert clinical opinion. The model evaluated the perspectives of a commercial payer with no Medicare beneficiaries and a commercial payer with a subset of Medicare beneficiaries. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess changing input values. In each modeled scenario, 57 patients with prior docetaxel therapy received treatment for mCRPC. For the commercial perspective, the incremental per-member-per-month (PMPM) cost attributable to abiraterone ranged from $0.0019 in scenario 1 to $0.0133 in scenario 3. For the commercial/Medicare perspective, the incremental PMPM ranged from $0.0026 in scenario 1 to $0.0176 in scenario 3. The average incremental PMPM cost over 3 scenarios is $0.0112.

The mean 2,3-DPG level of three patients on vincristine alone did not vary significantly from the control level of the leukemia patients on prednisone and vincristine. No significant change in serum inorganic phosphate level was observed. The mean erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentration of 17 nephrotic syndrome patients being treated with chronic prednisone therapy was 14.0% higher than a control group of 20 nephrotic syndrome patients not being treated with prednisone (P small than 0.01). A significant positive correlation was observed between the dose of prednisone and 2,3-DPG level.\n\nHealth-related quality-of-life in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the FIRST trial: lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone versus melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelforge, Michel; Minuk, Leonard; Eisenmann, Jean-Claude; Arnulf, Bertrand; Canepa, Letizia; Fragasso, Alberto; Leyvraz, Serge; Langer, Christian; Ezaydi, Yousef; Vogl, Dan T; Giraldo-Castellano, Pilar; Yoon, Sung-Soo; Zarnitsky, Charles; Escoffre-Barbe, Martine; Lemieux, Bernard; Song, Kevin; Bahlis, Nizar Jacques; Guo, Shien; Monzini, Mara Silva; Ervin-Haynes, Annette; Houck, Vanessa; Facon, Thierry\n\n2015-06-01\n\nWe compared the health-related quality-of-life of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged over 65 years or transplant-ineligible in the pivotal, phase III FIRST trial. Patients received: i) continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone until disease progression; ii) fixed cycles of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone for 18 months; or iii) fixed cycles of melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide for 18 months. Data were collected using the validated questionnaires (QLQ-MY20, QLQ-C30, and EQ-5D). The analysis focused on the EQ-5D utility value and six domains pre-selected for their perceived clinical relevance. Lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone, and melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide improved patients' health-related quality-of-life from baseline over the duration of the study across all pre-selected domains of the QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D. In the QLQ-MY20, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in the Disease Symptoms domain compared with melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide at Month 3, and significantly lower scores for QLQ-MY20 Side Effects of Treatment at all post-baseline assessments except Month 18. Linear mixed-model repeated-measures analyses confirmed the results observed in the cross-sectional analysis. Continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone delays disease progression versus melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide and has been associated with a clinically meaningful improvement in health-related quality-of-life. These results further establish continuous lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone as a new standard of care for initial therapy of myeloma by demonstrating superior health-related quality-of-life during treatment, compared with melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide.

D.; Halloran, B.; Fong, L.; Steinbach, L.; Shellito, J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nGlucocorticoid administration is a well established cause of osteopenia. Mechanisms underlying the deleterious effect of glucocorticoids on bone may include direct inhibition of bone formation as well as indirect effects through changes in intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium excretion, and/or levels of the calciotropic hormones. To further examine the potential role of the calciotropic hormones we measured serum levels of PTH and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], as well as serum and urine levels of calcium and vertebral bone density in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being managed with or without prednisone. Patients treated with prednisone had lower spinal bone density (53 vs. 106 mg/cm3) and higher serum calcium (2.40 vs. 2.33 mmol/l), urine calcium (6.9 vs. 2.7 mmol/24h), and 1,25(OH)2D levels (147 vs. 95 pmol/L). Compared to the patients not treated with glucocorticoids. PTH levels also tended to be higher (33 vs. 26 microliters-eq/ml), but the difference was not significant. Serum and urine calcium levels correlated positively with 1,25(OH)2D levels, but none of these measurements correlated with PTH levels. Our results suggest that prednisone treatment alters the regulation of 1,25(OH)2D production, and this may contribute to the loss of bone mineral induced by prednisone.\n\nRandomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial of sunitinib plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in progressive, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nMichaelson, M Dror; Oudard, Stephane; Ou, Yen-Chuan; SengelÃ¸v, Lisa; Saad, Fred; Houede, Nadine; Ostler, Peter; Stenzl, Arnulf; Daugaard, Gedske; Jones, Robert; Laestadius, Fredrik; UllÃ¨n, Anders; Bahl, Amit; Castellano, Daniel; Gschwend, Juergen; Maurina, Tristan; Chow Maneval, Edna; Wang, Shaw-Ling; Lechuga, Maria Jose; Paolini, Jolanda; Chen, Isan\n\n2014-01-10\n\nWe evaluated angiogenesis-targeted sunitinib therapy in a randomized, double-blind trial of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Men with progressive mCRPC after docetaxel-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive sunitinib 37.5 mg/d continuously or placebo. Patients also received oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily. The primary end point was overall survival (OS); secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS). Two interim analyses were planned. Overall, 873 patients were randomly assigned to receive sunitinib (n = 584) or placebo (n = 289). The independent data monitoring committee stopped the study for futility after the second interim analysis. After a median overall follow-up of 8.7 months, median OS was 13.1 months and 11.8 months for sunitinib and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.914; 95% CI, 0.762 to 1.097; stratified log-rank test, P = .168). PFS was significantly improved in the sunitinib arm (median 5.6 v 4.1 months; HR, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.591 to 0.890; stratified log-rank test, P < .001). Toxicity and rates of discontinuations because of adverse events (AEs; 27% v 7%) were greater with sunitinib than placebo. The most common treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs were fatigue (9% v 1%), asthenia (8% v 2%), and hand-foot syndrome (7% v 0%). Frequent treatment-emergent grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities were lymphopenia (20% v 11%), anemia (9% v 8%), and neutropenia (6% v < 1%). The addition of sunitinib to prednisone did not improve OS compared with placebo in docetaxel-refractory mCRPC. The role of antiangiogenic therapy in mCRPC remains investigational.\n\n[Effects of jingui shenqi pill combined prednisone on expression of glucocorticoid receptor and its clinical effect in treating bullous pemphigoid patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Bao-guo; Li, Zhi-ying; Du, Ming\n\n2006-10-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of Jingui Shenqi Pill (JSP) on the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the skin lesion and its clinical effect in treating bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients. Thirty BP patients were randomly divided into the treatment group (n=15) treated with JSP plus prednisone and the prednisone group (n=15) with prednisone alone both for 4 weeks. And a normal control group was set up also. Expressions of GR-alpha and GR-beta in the skin lesion of BP patients and the normal skin of the normal control were detected by immunohistochemical assay. Results The total effective rate was 93.33% in the treatment group, significantly higher than that in the prednisone group which was 73.33% (P < 0.05); GR-alpha expression was higher in the treatment group than that in other two groups (P < 0.01), while GR-beta expression in the treatment group was lower than that in the prednisone group (P < 0.01). JSP could increase GR-alpha expression and decrease GR-beta expression in the skin lesion of BP patients, so as to improve sensitivity of skin to glucocorticoid.\n\n[Granulomatous mastitis in a patient treated with prednisone].\n\nPubMed\n\nFetveit, T; Uggerud, R\n\n1993-09-30\n\nA 36 year old woman, mother of a two year old child developed, in the course of one night, a tender mass in the upper medial quadrant of the left mamma. Treatment with antibiotics had no effect, and after a week the patient was admitted to hospital for drainage of the abscess and further examination. She had then developed reactive arthritis. Histological examination of a specimen from the mamma revealed lobular granulomatous mastitis. This connection has not been described before in the literature. Further examination showed no signs of infectious disease or sarcoidosis. Surgical drainage had only a minor effect on the breast-mass. The patient was treated with prednisone for six months, and after one year of observation the mass has disappeared, but the arthralgias persists.\n\nSonographic Features of Cervical Lymph Nodes in Patients With Hashimoto Thyroiditis and the Impacts From the Levothyroxine With Prednisone Therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nLyu, Guo-Rong; Zheng, Wei-Kun; Lin, Wan-Ling; Zheng, Li-Ping; Guo, Hai-Xin; Li, Li-Ya\n\n2017-11-06\n\nThis study aimed to evaluate the ultrasonographic pattern of cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) and whether levothyroxine with prednisone therapy is effective for lymphadenopathy in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT). This retrospective study was looking at patients with confirmed diagnosis of HT who underwent comprehensive neck ultrasound examination. We reviewed sonographic findings in 127 patients with HT, 234 euthyroid patients with goiter, and 122 healthy subjects. In addition, 30 untreated HT patients with cervical lymphadenopathy were recruited for the levothyroxine with prednisone therapy. We rescanned the patients 9 months after treatment with levothyroxine and prednisone. Patients with HT had a higher rate of CLN detection on ultrasound than euthyroid patients with goiter and healthy subjects at cervical levels III, IV, and VI (P < 0.01). In addition, patients with HT had a higher rate of detection of CLNs with abnormal sonographic features than the other 2 groups, most notably at cervical levels III, IV, and VI (P < 0.01). After the treatment, the mean thyroid volume, thyroid nodule volume, CLN volume, symptom score, and cosmetic grade of 30 HT patients were remarkably decreased (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). Hashimoto thyroiditis seems to be associated with an increased rate of detection of CLNs with abnormal sonographic features, particularly at cervical levels III, IV, and VI. Therapy with levothyroxine with prednisone is effective for cervical lymphadenopathy in patients with HT.\n\nOctreotide LAR and Prednisone as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Patients with Primary or Locally Recurrent Unresectable Thymic Tumors: A Phase II Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKirzinger, Lukas; Boy, Sandra; Marienhagen, JÃ¶rg; Schuierer, Gerhard; Neu, Reiner; Ried, Michael; Hofmann, Hans-Stefan; Wiebe, Karsten; StrÃ¶bel, Philipp; May, Christoph; Kleylein-Sohn, Julia; Baierlein, Claudia; Bogdahn, Ulrich; Marx, Alexander; Schalke, Berthold\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTherapeutic options to cure advanced, recurrent, and unresectable thymomas are limited. The most important factor for long-term survival of thymoma patients is complete resection (R0) of the tumor. We therefore evaluated the response to and the induction of resectability of primarily or locally recurrent unresectable thymomas and thymic carcinomas by octreotide Long-Acting Release (LAR) plus prednisone therapy in patients with positive octreotide scans. In this open label, single-arm phase II study, 17 patients with thymomas considered unresectable or locally recurrent thymoma (n = 15) and thymic carcinoma (n = 2) at Masaoka stage III were enrolled. Octreotide LAR (30 mg once every 2 weeks) was administered in combination with prednisone (0.6 mg/kg per day) for a maximum of 24 weeks (study design according to FlemingÂ´s one sample multiple testing procedure for phase II clinical trials). Tumor size was evaluated by volumetric CT measurements, and a decrease in tumor volume of at least 20% at week 12 compared to baseline was considered as a response. We found that octreotide LAR plus prednisone elicited response in 15 of 17 patients (88%). Median reduction of tumor volume after 12 weeks of treatment was 51% (range 20%â86%). Subsequently, complete surgical resection was achieved in five (29%) and four patients (23%) after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Octreotide LAR plus prednisone treatment was discontinued in two patients before week 12 due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effects or adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (71%), infectious (65%), and hematological (41%) complications. In conclusion, octreotide LAR plus prednisone is efficacious in patients with primary or recurrent unresectable thymoma with respect to tumor regression. Octreotide LAR plus prednisone was well tolerated and adverse events were in line with the known safety profile of both agents.

As hypothyroid dogs receiving thyroid supplement need periodic monitoring, knowledge of whether prednisone alters thyroid hormone concentrations would be useful to determine whether testing can or should be done while the dog is receiving therapy and whether dose adjustments are appropriate. In this study, the effect of short-term anti-inflammatory prednisone was determined in dogs with naturally occurring hypothyroidism. Eight adult dogs were given prednisone (1.0 mg/kg, orally) daily for 7 days and then on alternate days for 14 days. Serum total thyroxine (T(4) ), free T(4) (fT(4) ), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured on days 7, 21 and 28 and compared with baseline data. Total T(4) concentrations were significantly decreased after 7 days of anti-inflammatory prednisone, but were not significantly altered from baseline on days 21 or 28. Free T(4) and TSH concentrations were not significantly altered from baseline at any point during the study. Two dogs had decreased total T(4) concentrations on day 7, which may have resulted in an alteration in thyroid supplementation. Results showed that administration of prednisone at a dosage of 1 mg/kg, orally, once daily for 7 days decreased total T(4) , while fT(4) was unchanged, suggesting that fT(4) may be less affected by daily prednisone administration. Anti-inflammatory doses of prednisone administered every other day did not interfere with thyroid hormone monitoring. Â© 2010 The Authors.

Methods: The HP1100 high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system was employed. The HP Lichrosphere C8 column (250 mm Ã 4 mm, i.d., 5 Î¼m particle size) was used. The mobile phase was methanol, tetrahydrofuran and water in the ratio 25:25:50. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The sample was monitored by UV absorbance at 240 nm. Acetanilide was used as the internal standard, and methanol was added into the serum for depositing the protein. Results: The chromatography was effective and was not interfered with by the serum components. Good linearity was observed, within the range of 10-500 Î¼g/L for prednisone, and the detection limit was 5 Î¼g/L. The serum concentrations of prednisone between the nephrotic syndrome (NS) group and the control group were significantly different (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the females and males of the NS group (P > 0.05). The serum ncentration of prednisone in the steroid-resistant group was lower than that in the steroid-sensitive group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: HPLC is a practical and reliable method to determine the serum concentration of prednisone with high accuracy, precision, linearity and repeatability.

In all 122 courses of treatment were given. Of 22 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who received this as their first treatment, all achieved complete remission. The complete remission rates were 82% for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in their first relapse, 63% in the second relapse, and much lower in subsequent relapses and in the patients with other types of acute leukaemia. Alopecia and gastrointestinal and neuromuscular toxicity occurred respectively in 51%, 29%, and 21% of instances, only the last of these side-effects of vincristine being dose-related. Most of the complete remissions were obtained with a total dose of vincristine which carried only a low risk of neurotoxicity.

While oral liquid formulations of prednisone enable weight-based dosing, children frequently find them to be objectionable due to bitter taste. This limitation of prednisone can adversely impact patient acceptance and may result in non-compliance. Efforts to mask flavors often result in poorly controlled, heterogeneous particle distributions and can provide ineffective taste masking. The present work utilized a novel drug delivery technology developed by Orbis Biosciences, Inc., to create an oral taste-masked formulation of prednisone. Methods The study examined the palatability of Orbisâ microsphere prednisone formulation in healthy young adults (n=24). Four test articles were used in the study including a reference formulation (Roxane Laboratories), a control, and the test formulation (Orbis) prepared in two different ways. Study participants were randomized in a crossover design. Key Findings Results indicated that the test prednisone formulation was indistinguishable from the control, and both were preferable to the reference formulation in every category of palatability assessed using a validated 9-point Hedonic Scale. The data also suggested that preparing the microsphere suspension immediately prior to administration results in the most ideal palatability properties. Conclusions In conclusion, the novel microsphere formulation technology was effective in taste-masking prednisone.

Two groups consisting of six dogs each served as controls. Treatment for two weeks with oral prednisone at 1.2 mg/kg body weight or at 4 mg/kg body weight daily decreased the serum amylase activities, but increased the serum lipase activities. Postmortem examinations revealed microscopic evidence of mild pancreatitis in only one dog given prednisone, that clinically appeared normal.

Randomized controlled clinical trial. 20 client-owned dogs with primary IMPA. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive prednisone (starting at 1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h; n = 10) or cyclosporine (5 mg/kg [2.3 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h; 10) for 90 days. Cyclosporine-treated dogs also received carprofen, tramadol, or both for the first 7 days for analgesia. Data collection, physical examination, and cytologic analysis of synovial fluid samples were performed on days 0, 14, 45, and 90. Trough whole blood cyclosporine concentrations were determined on days 7 to 17 for cyclosporine-treated dogs. Treatment failure was defined as lack of clinical improvement by day 14, lack of cytologic improvement by day 45, or need to change treatment because of adverse effects. Treatment was successful for 7 prednisone-treated dogs and 7 cyclosporine-treated dogs. Absence of synovial fluid cytologic abnormalities on day 45 was identified for 5 prednisone-treated dogs and 8 cyclosporine-treated dogs. Prednisone-treated dogs were more likely to develop polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia than were cyclosporine-treated dogs. Opportunistic infections (ie, demodicosis or Erysipelothrix bacteremia) were identified in 2 cyclosporine-treated dogs and 0 prednisone-treated dogs, and diarrhea developed in 1 cyclosporine-treated dog, requiring treatment discontinuation. Although the number of dogs evaluated was small, limiting generalizability, results of this study suggested that cyclosporine offers promise as a suitable alternative to prednisone for treatment of IMPA in dogs.\n\nDaratumumab plus Bortezomib, Melphalan, and Prednisone for Untreated Myeloma.\n\nPubMed\n\nMateos, MarÃ­a-Victoria; Dimopoulos, Meletios A; Cavo, Michele; Suzuki, Kenshi; Jakubowiak, Andrzej; Knop, Stefan; Doyen, Chantal; Lucio, Paulo; Nagy, Zsolt; Kaplan, Polina; Pour, Ludek; Cook, Mark; Grosicki, Sebastian; Crepaldi, Andre; Liberati, Anna M; Campbell, Philip; Shelekhova, Tatiana; Yoon, Sung-Soo; Iosava, Genadi; Fujisaki, Tomoaki; Garg, Mamta; Chiu, Christopher; Wang, Jianping; Carson, Robin; Crist, Wendy; Deraedt, William; Nguyen, Huong; Qi, Ming; San-Miguel, Jesus\n\n2018-02-08\n\nThe combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone is a standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. Daratumumab has shown efficacy in combination with standard-of-care regimens in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 706 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for stem-cell transplantation to receive nine cycles of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone either alone (control group) or with daratumumab (daratumumab group) until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival. At a median follow-up of 16.5 months in a prespecified interim analysis, the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 71.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.5 to 76.8) in the daratumumab group and 50.2% (95% CI, 43.2 to 56.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.65; P<0.001). The overall response rate was 90.9% in the daratumumab group, as compared with 73.9% in the control group (P<0.001), and the rate of complete response or better (including stringent complete response) was 42.6%, versus 24.4% (P<0.001). In the daratumumab group, 22.3% of the patients were negative for minimal residual disease (at a threshold of 1 tumor cell per 10 5 white cells), as compared with 6.2% of those in the control group (P<0.001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were hematologic: neutropenia (in 39.9% of the patients in the daratumumab group and in 38.7% of those in the control group), thrombocytopenia (in 34.4% and 37.6%, respectively), and anemia (in 15.9% and 19.8%, respectively). The rate of grade 3 or 4 infections was 23.1% in the daratumumab group and 14.7% in the control group; the rate of treatment discontinuation due to infections was 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively.

The pharmacokinetics of prednisolone were examined in postmenopausal women taking conjugated estrogens and age-matched control women. The subjects received iv bolus doses of 0.14 and 0.55 mg/kg prednisolone. Expected increases in clearance and volume of distribution with increasing dose were observed for total prednisolone in all subjects. At both doses, significant decreases in total and unbound prednisolone clearance were observed in the women taking estrogen compared to the controls. Volume of distribution was unchanged. The decreases in clearance are smaller than those observed in youngmoreÂ Â» women taking oral contraceptives indicating that factors other than estrogen administration may influence prednisolone clearance in oral contraceptive users. While the protein binding of prednisolone is well characterized, little is known about the protein binding of prednisone. Equilibrium dialysis employing (/sup 3/H)prednisone was used to study the binding of prednisone in human plasma containing endogenous hydrocortisone. Plasma was obtained from volunteers with normal and elevated transcortin binding capacities (CAP/sub T/). Prednisolone binding exhibits marked concentration dependence and sensitivity to CAP/sub T/. In contrast, prednisone binding is independent of concentration and CAP/sub T/.Â«Â less\n\nTacrolimus Improves Symptoms of Children With Myasthenia Gravis Refractory to Prednisone.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Chanchan; Gui, Mengcui; Cao, Yayun; Lin, Jing; Li, Yue; Ji, Suqiong; Bu, Bitao\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMyasthenia gravis tends to affect children in China. Oral pyridostigmine and prednisone could effectively improve the symptoms, but multiple side effects become a major concern after long-term oral prednisone. To avoid the long-term complications of prednisone therapy and to obtain more satisfactory improvement, we tested the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in children with myasthenia gravis. Children with myasthenia gravis who had not achieved satisfactory improvement or who experienced severe side effects after prednisone therapy were recruited between January 2015 and December 2016 at Tongji Hospital. All the children were treated with tacrolimus 1 mg to 2 mg daily and the dose was adjusted on the basis of the clinical response and the serum concentration. The dosage of prednisone, the severity of symptoms, blood samples, the serum concentration of tacrolimus, and titers of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies were evaluated every four weeks. Fourteen children were enrolled. One child withdrew two weeks after the enrollment. Thirteen children have completed the therapy for one year. At the end point, the dosage of prednisone was significantly decreased (Pâ<â0.05), the symptoms were evaluated by the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, and myasthenia gravis-specific manual muscle testing and myasthenia gravis-activities of daily living scores were significantly improved (Pâ<â0.05, Pâ<â0.05, and Pâ<â0.01, respectively). More importantly, ten (76.9%) patients had completely discontinued prednisone, and the major side effects were nearly reversed. The mean titer of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies significantly dropped from 1.96Â±2.62 nmol/L to 0.70Â±1.04 nmol/L (Pâ<â0.05). No severe adverse events were reported. Our results suggest that tacrolimus is a promising agent for children with refractory myasthenia gravis. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the observation.

Based on a simplified glucocorticoid therapy scheme and the peri-operative observation, we investigated its efficacy and safety up to 6 months post-adrenalectomy in this cohort study. We found the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were normal post-adrenalectomy, and sufficient to stimulate the recovery of the dystrophic adrenal cortex, thus exogenous supplemental ACTH might not be necessary. Patients were grouped by oral reception of either hydrocortisone or prednisone since day 2 post-adrenalectomy. Both groups had similar baseline responses to adrenalectomy, regarding the correction of hypertension (10/15 vs.12/19), hyperglycemia (6/11 vs. 7/10), and hypokalemia (12/12 vs. 11/11). Most patients lost weight (17/20 vs. 20/22). Both groups reported significant improvement in a subjective evaluation questionnaire. Hydrocortisone showed advantages over prednisone in improving liver function (7/8 vs. 2/7, p = 0.035), but also caused significant lower extremety edema ( p = 0.034). Both groups developed adrenal insufficiency (AI) during glucocorticoid withdrawal, with no significant difference regarding the incidence rate (7/20 vs. 10/22) or severity. Most AI symptoms were relieved by resuming the prior oral doses, while two severe cases were hospitalized. The withdrawal process may last longer time for hydrocortisone than prednisone. In conclusion, our data supports the use of both hydrocortisone and prednisone in the glucocorticoid replacement therapy post-adrenalectomy for patients of adrenal adenoma or Cushing's disease. Hydrocortisone showed advantages over prednisone in improving liver function, and prednisone exhibited significantly lower risk of edema.\n\nTreatment of severe poison ivy: a randomized, controlled trial of long versus short course oral prednisone.\n\nPubMed\n\nCurtis, Gabrielle; Lewis, Amy C\n\n2014-12-01\n\nToxidendron (poison ivy, oak, and sumac) contact dermatitis is a common complaint in the outpatient primary care setting with little evidence-based guidance on best treatment duration. This randomized, controlled trial examined the efficacy and side effects of a 5-day regimen of 40 mg oral prednisone daily (short course) compared to the same 5-day regimen followed by a prednisone taper of 30 mg daily for 2 days, 20 mg daily for 2 days, 10 mg daily for 2 days, and 5 mg daily for 4 days over a total of 15 days (long course) in patients with severe poison ivy dermatitis. In 49 patients with severe poison ivy, non-adherence rates, rash return, medication side effects, and time to improvement and complete healing of the rash were not significantly different between the two groups. Patients receiving the long course regimen were significantly less likely to utilize other medications (22.7% vs. 55.6%, P = 0.02, number needed to treat 3.05). This study suggests that a longer course prescription may save patients' time and exposure to excess medication in the treatment of severe poison ivy. Application of this information to clinical practice will save return visits and reduce excess non-prescription medication administration to individual patients.\n\nLow incidence of pneumocystis pneumonia utilizing PCR-based diagnosis in patients with B-cell lymphoma receiving rituximab-containing combination chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarreto, Jason N; Ice, Lauren L; Thompson, Carrie A; Tosh, Pritish K; Osmon, Douglas R; Dierkhising, Ross A; Plevak, Matthew F; Limper, Andrew H\n\n2016-11-01\n\nRecent literature has demonstrated concern over the risk of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) when administering rituximab with combination chemotherapy such as in R-CHOP; however, the exact risk and potential need for prophylaxis is unknown. We sought to determine the incidence of PJP infection following R-CHOP administration in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Consecutive patients diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma receiving R-CHOP were evaluated from chemotherapy initiation until 180 days after the last administration. The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of PJP infection. Secondary endpoints included the association of rituximab, prednisone and subsequent chemotherapy with PJP infection risk. A total of 689 patients (53% male, median age 66 years) were included. Seventy-three percent of patients completed at least 6 cycles of R-CHOP treatment. Median rituximab and prednisone cumulative doses were 3950 mg and 5325 mg, respectively. Median daily prednisone dose through end of treatment was 45 mg (range 7.6 mg to 119 mg). The cumulative incidence of PJP was 1.51% (95% CI 0.57-2.43, at maximum follow-up of 330 days), below 3.5%, the conventional threshold for prophylaxis. Univariate analysis did not detect a statistically significant association between PJP and rituximab, steroids, or receipt of additional chemotherapy in this patient population. Our results demonstrate a low occurrence of Pneumocystis pneumonia during R-CHOP treatment of B-cell lymphoma and argue against universal anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis in this setting. Further investigations should focus on targeted anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis for patients presenting with high-risk baseline characteristics or when receiving rituximab-inclusive intensive combination chemotherapy regimens as treatment for other aggressive lymphoma subtypes.

This phase I trial tested the combination of pasireotide, docetaxel, and prednisone in pretreated mCRPC. Chemotherapy naive mCRPC patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days and pasireotide intramuscularly every 28 days at escalating dose levels of 40, 60, and 80Â mg. Maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were assessed. Eighteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 65 (range, 49-75) years, and pretherapy prostate-specific antigen of 259.9 ng/mL. The dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 4 hyperglycemia unresponsive to therapy and Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for > 7 days in 1 patient each occurring at the 80-mg dose level of pasireotide. The RP2D was determined at 60 mg every 28 days. Four patients at the 60 mg dose had Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia, which responded adequately to therapy. Median time to progression and survival were 7.2 and 18.3 months, respectively. Three of 6 patients with circulating tumor cellsÂ â¥5 converted to circulating tumor cellsÂ < 5 post therapy. The insulin like growth factor-1 levels revealed a median 51% decrease after therapy. The neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin did not show any marked change. The addition of pasireotide to docetaxel and prednisone is clinically feasible at a dose level of 60 mg every 28 days. The combination showed potential for clinical efficacy but needs to be compared with the standard docetaxel and prednisone regimen. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

What dosing strategy has the best balance between effect and side-effects is largely unknown. We analyzed change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and weight during different prednisone doses used in daily practice for treatment naÃ¯ve pulmonary sarcoidosis patients. Multilevel models were used to describe FVC and weight change over time. Correlations were calculated using linear regression models. Fifty-four patients were included. FVC changed over time (pÂ <Â 0.001), with an average increase of 9.6% predicted (95% CI: 7.2 to 12.1) at 12 months. Weight changed significantly over time (pÂ <Â 0.001), with an average increase of 4.3Â kg (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.6) at 12 months. Although FVC and weight changed significantly over time, there was little correlation between prednisone dose and FVC change, while weight increase correlated significantly with cumulative prednisone dose at 24 months. In patients treated with a high cumulative prednisone dose, baseline FVC was on average lower (pÂ =Â 0.001) compared to low dose treated patients, while no significant differences were observed in need for second/third-line therapy or number of exacerbations. A strategy leading to a low cumulative dose at 12 months was defined by rapid dose tapering to 10Â mg/day within 3.5 months. These results suggest that prednisone therapy aimed at improving or preserving FVC in newly- treated pulmonary sarcoidosis can often be reduced in dose, using a treatment regimen that is characterized by early dose tapering.

On the 6th day of each treatment course, they received 5h intravenous infusions of L-[1-14C]-leucine and L-[1-13C]-glutamine in the postabsorptive state 1) under baseline conditions (prednisone only day), and 2) after 24h of treatment with phenylbutyrate (prednisone+phenylbutyrate day), a glutamine chelating agent. Results Phenylbutyrate treatment was associated with 1) an â15% decline in plasma glutamine concentration (627Â±39 vs. 530Â±31 Î¼mol.L-1; P<0.05), 2) no change in leucine appearance rate, an index of protein breakdown (124Â±9 vs. 128Â±9 Î¼mol.kg-1.h-1; NS) nor in non oxidative leucine disposal, an index of whole body protein synthesis (94Â±9 vs. 91Â±7 Î¼mol.kg -1.h-1; NS); and 3) a â25% rise in leucine oxidation (30Â±1 vs. 38Â±2 Î¼mol.kg-1.h-1, P<0.05), despite an â25% decline (p<0.05) in leucine concentration. Conclusions In a model of mild, stress-induced protein catabolism, depletion of plasma glutamine per se may worsen branched chain amino acid and protein wasting.

In this setting, few drugs have demonstrated efficacy in inducing steroid-free remission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding granulocyte/monocyte apheresis [GMA] to oral prednisone in patients with steroid-dependent UC. This was a randomized, multicentre, open trial comparing 7 weekly sessions of GMA plus oral prednisone [40 mg/day and tapering] with prednisone alone, in patients with active, steroid-dependent UC [Mayo score 4-10 and inability to withdraw corticosteroids in 3 months or relapse within the first 3 months after discontinuation]. Patients were stratified by concomitant use of thiopurines at inclusion. A 9-week tapering schedule of prednisone was pre-established in both study groups. The primary endpoint was steroid-free remission [defined as a total Mayo score â¤2, with no subscore >1] at Week 24, with no re-introduction of corticosteroids. In all 123 patients were included [63 GMA group, 62 prednisone alone]. In the intention-to-treat analysis, steroid-free remission at Week 24 was achieved in 13% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6-24) in the GMA group and 7% [95% CI 2-16] in the control group [p = 0.11]. In the GMA group, time to relapse was significantly longer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7 [1.16-2.48], P = 0.005) and steroid-related adverse events were significantly lower [6% vs 20%, P < 0.05]. In a randomized trial, the addition of 7 weekly sessions of GMA to a conventional course of oral prednisone did not increase the proportion of steroid-free remissions in patients with active steroid-dependent UC, though it delayed clinical relapse.\n\nMultidrug resistance-1 in T lymphocytes and natural killer cells of adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: effect of prednisone treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-Karpovitch, Xavier; Graue, Gerardo; Crespo-SolÃ­s, Erick; Piedras, Josefa\n\n2008-07-01\n\nHigh P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance-1 (P-gp/MDR1) activity in lymphocytes from idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients may affect disease outcome. ITP treatment includes glucocorticoids that are substrates of P-gp; hence, P-gp functional activity and antigenic expression were assessed by flow cytometry in T and natural killer (NK) cells from ITP patients before and after prednisone therapy. Herein, patients' T and NK cells did not show increased MDR1 functional activity, whereas P-gp antigenic expression was significantly enhanced in both therapy-free and prednisone-treated patients.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed articles in the Medline, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. We selected studies meeting the following criteria: comparing at least two groups or time points (prednisone vs. control, prednisone vs. another drug, or pre- vs. post-treatment with prednisone); and evaluating parameters before and after prednisone use, including values for sputum eosinophils, sputum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and sputum IL-5-with or without values for post-bronchodilator FEV1-with corresponding 95% CIs or with sufficient data for calculation. The independent variables were the use, dose, and duration of prednisone treatment. The outcomes evaluated were sputum eosinophils, IL-5, and ECP, as well as post-bronchodilator FEV1. RESULTS: The pooled analysis of the pre- vs. post-treatment data revealed a significant mean reduction in sputum eosinophils (â8.18%; 95% CI: 7.69-8.67; p < 0.001), sputum IL-5 (â83.64 pg/mL; 95% CI: 52.45-114.83; p < 0.001), and sputum ECP (â267.60 Âµg/L; 95% CI: 244.57-290.63; p < 0.0001), as well as a significant mean increase in post-bronchodilator FEV1 (â8.09%; 95% CI: 5.35-10.83; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severe eosinophilic bronchitis, treatment with prednisone caused a significant reduction in sputum eosinophil counts, as well as in the sputum levels of IL-5 and ECP. This reduction in the inflammatory response was accompanied by a significant increase in post-bronchodilator FEV1.

A 4.5-year-old, female spayed Yorkshire Terrier presented to the ICU with acute onset of respiratory distress following a 24-hour cytarabine infusion. The patient was previously diagnosed with meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUO), caudal occipital malformation, and syringohydromyelia, and was being treated with oral prednisone and levetiracetam, and cytarabine infusions. The patient developed tachypnea and dyspnea, and had diffuse crackles on auscultation of all lung fields, and hypoxemia 6 hours following completion of the fourth cytarabine infusion (300 mg/m 2 ). Thoracic radiographs revealed diffuse, bilateral infiltrates consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory distress and hypoxemia persisted despite oxygen supplementation and furosemide therapy and led to initiation of mechanical ventilation. Approximately 12 hours later, the dog became progressively hypoxemic with worsening pulmonary edema. The owners elected euthanasia. Postmortem examination revealed pulmonary edema and diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Histopathologic evaluation revealed pulmonary edema, severe acute neutrophilic and histiocytic pneumonia, and multifocal interstitial fibrosis. Bacterial culture yielded no growth. Drug-induced ILD is rarely reported in the veterinary literature, and has not previously been reported in dogs receiving cytarabine. As with administration of any medication, adverse events may occur. While ILD is unlikely to be commonly recognized, it may be considered in veterinary patients receiving chemotherapy that acutely become dyspneic.

Five Italian hospitals enrolled 375 non-diabetic, ischaemic patients without contraindications to dual anti-platelet treatment or corticosteroid therapy in a randomized controlled study. The primary endpoint was the event-free survival of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and recurrence of ischaemia needing repeated target vessel revascularization at 1 year, and this was significantly lower in the BMS group (80.8%) compared with the prednisone (88.0%) and DES group (88.8%, P = 0.04 and 0.006, respectively). The long-term analysis of the primary endpoint was a pre-specified aim of the trial, and was performed at 1447 days (median, IQ range = 1210-1641). Patients receiving BMS alone had significantly lower event-free survival (75.3%) compared with 84.1% in the prednisone group (HR: 0.447; 95% CI: 0.25-0.80, P = 0.007) and 80.6% in DES patients (HR: 0.519; 95% CI: 0.29-0.93, P = 0.03). Prednisone-treated patients did not develop new treatment-related clinical problems. Drug-eluting stents patients suffered more very late stent thrombosis as a cause of spontaneous myocardial infarction. The need for target vessel revascularization remained lower in the prednisone and DES groups (13.6 and 15.2%, respectively), compared with BMS (23.2%). The clinical benefits of prednisone compared with BMS only persisted almost unchanged at 4 years. Drug-eluting stents performed better than BMS at long-term, although the advantages observed at 1 year were in part attenuated because of the occurrence of very late stent thrombosis and late revascularizations.

The study group consisted of 18 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), ten with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one with acute undifferentiated leukemia. Only one patient had previously received Adriamycin. Overall, there were ten CRs and two partial remissions. The five CRs and one partial remission in patients with AML occurred among those with one prior induction attempt; none of the eight AML patients with more than one prior induction attempt responded. The actuarial median duration of CR was 15 weeks and was similar for AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Responders had a longer median survival (30 weeks) than nonresponders (9 weeks). Thus, although a reasonable number of responses in previously treated patients were obtained with this program, improvements in maintenance therapy are clearly needed.\n\nCost-effectiveness of modified-release prednisone in the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness based on directly elicited public preference values.\n\nPubMed\n\nDunlop, William; Iqbal, Itrat; Khan, Ifty; Ouwens, Mario; Heron, Louise\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAssessing the cost-effectiveness of treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of growing importance due to the chronic nature of the disease, rising treatment costs, and budget-constrained health care systems. This analysis assesses the cost-effectiveness of modified-release (MR) prednisone compared with immediate-release (IR) prednisone for the treatment of morning stiffness due to RA. A health state transition model was used to categorize RA patients into four health states, defined by duration of morning stiffness. The model applied a 1-year time horizon and adopted a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Health benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the final output was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Efficacy data were derived from the CAPRA-1 (Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis) study, drug costs from the British National Formulary (BNF), and utility data from a direct elicitation time-trade-off (TTO) study in the general population. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Mean treatment costs per patient were higher for MR-prednisone (Â£649.70) than for IR-prednisone (Â£46.54) for the duration of the model. However, the model generated an incremental QALY of 0.044 in favor of MR-prednisone which resulted in an ICER of Â£13,577. Deterministic sensitivity analyses did not lead to significant changes in the ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported that MR-prednisone had an 84% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Â£30,000 per QALY. The model only considers drug costs and there was a lack of comparative long-term data for IR-prednisone. Furthermore, utility benefits were not captured in the clinical setting. This analysis demonstrates that, based on the CAPRA-1 trial and directly elicited public preference values, MR-prednisone is a cost-effective treatment option when compared with IR-prednisone for RA patients with morning stiffness over\n\nThe prednisone dosage in the CHOP chemotherapy regimen for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL): is there a standard?\n\nPubMed\n\nMoreno, A; Colon-Otero, G; Solberg, L A\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDiscrepancies in the quoted prednisone dosages in the regimens reported as the only standard CHOP regimen stimulated our interest in reviewing the medical literature regarding this issue and to assess whether practicing hematologists and oncologists in the U.S. are aware of the different dose schedules of prednisone in the published CHOP programs. Sixteen textbooks and chemotherapy reference books were reviewed. A MEDLINE search of English-language articles published between January 1970 and December 1998 was performed. An eight-point questionnaire was sent via e-mail with responses obtained from 421 hematology/oncology physicians in the U.S. Sixteen textbooks and chemotherapy reference books reviewed quoted only one prednisone dosage as part of the standard CHOP regimen; the prednisone dosages quoted as standard varied between publications. More than 4,000 eligible non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients have been treated with the CHOP chemotherapy as part of 43 different clinical trials reviewed. The dosages of prednisone and prednisolone used varied among six different levels. Thirty percent (127/421) of practicing U.S. physicians were not aware of the existence of more than one prednisone dose schedule as part of the CHOP regimen. The three most frequently used dosages are 100 mg/days 1-5 (67%), 100 mg/m(2)/days 1-5 (17%), and 60 mg/m(2)/days 1-5 (13%). Discrepancies in steroid dosages used as part of the reported standard CHOP regimens are common and not well recognized in the medical literature nor by practicing U.S. hematologists/oncologists. Based on this study, a prednisone dose of 100 mg/day for five days should be considered the standard dose.\n\nComplete remission of coronary vasculitis in Churg-Strauss Syndrome by prednisone and cyclophosphamide.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiksen, Niels P; Gehlmann, Helmut; Brouwer, Annemarie E; van Deuren, Marcel\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe heart is involved in up to 50% of all patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome, but vasculitis of the coronary arteries has only been rarely documented. We present a young patient with severe coronary aneurysms and stenotic lesions due to a Churg-Strauss vasculitis. Prompt therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide resulted in the complete resolution of all lesions.\n\nCost-effectiveness of modified-release prednisone in the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with morning stiffness based on directly elicited public preference values\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDunlop, William; Iqbal, Itrat; Khan, Ifty; Ouwens, Mario; Heron, Louise\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Assessing the cost-effectiveness of treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is of growing importance due to the chronic nature of the disease, rising treatment costs, and budget-constrained health care systems.

The results obtained demonstrate that oxazacort in short-term teatment with a high dose has no significant effect on the urinary elimination of calcium and hydroxypyroline in experimental conditions in which prednisone produces statistically significant and clinically relevant increase, both when given at the same dose and when given at half that dose. On the other hand, the oral absorption of 47Ca is decreased by oxazacort, but less than by prednisone at the same dose. As the antirheumatic activity of oxazacort appears to be only slightly lower than that of prednisone (activity ratio of about 0.84: 1), these findings may have interesting therapeutic implications.\n\nSimultaneous voltammetric determination of prednisone and prednisolone in human body fluids.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoyal, Rajendra N; Bishnoi, Sunita\n\n2009-08-15\n\nA sensitive, rapid and reliable electrochemical method based on voltammetry at single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) modified edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode (EPPGE) is proposed for the simultaneous determination of prednisolone and prednisone in human body fluids and pharmaceutical preparations. The electrochemical response of both the drugs was evaluated by osteryoung square wave voltammetry (OSWV) in phosphate buffer medium of pH 7.2. The modified electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic properties towards prednisone and prednisolone reduction with a peak potential of approximately -1230 and approximately -1332 mV respectively. The concentration versus peak current plots were linear for both the analytes in the range 0.01-100 microM and the detection limit (3 sigma/slope) observed for prednisone and prednisolone were 0.45 x 10(-8), 0.90 x 10(-8)M, respectively. The results of the quantitative estimation of prednisone and prednisolone in biological fluids were also compared with HPLC and the results were in good agreement.\n\nRandomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase III Trial Comparing Docetaxel and Prednisone With or Without Bevacizumab in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: CALGB 90401\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelly, William Kevin; Halabi, Susan; Carducci, Michael; George, Daniel; Mahoney, John F.; Stadler, Walter M.; Morris, Michael; Kantoff, Philip; Monk, J. Paul; Kaplan, Ellen; Vogelzang, Nicholas J.; Small, Eric J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose A randomized, placebo-controlled study based on preclinical and clinical data that supports the potential role of vascular endothelial growth factor in prostate cancer was performed to evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to standard docetaxel and prednisone therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients and Methods Patients with chemotherapy-naive progressive mCRPC with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status â¤ 2 and adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour for 21 days plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice per day (DP) with either bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (DP + B) or placebo. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen, objective response (OR), and toxicity. Results In total, 1,050 patients were randomly assigned. The median OS for patients given DP + B was 22.6 months compared with 21.5 month"
