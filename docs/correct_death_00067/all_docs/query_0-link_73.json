        "text": "This thesis aims to characterise a series of lime mortar samples removed from Stirling Castle, Scotland. Additional limestone samples were collected from potential quarry sites identified through archival analysis. An additional sample from Falkland Palace was selected for use due to its constrained source material locations. The samples were petrographically analysed using macro analysis, polarised light microscopy, point counting and XRD analysis. Chemical analysis was performed on the plaster and limestone samples using ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS. The aims of the analyses were to determine the provenance of the original source limestone and aggregate used to create the plasters, and to determine the age of the samples. The archival investigation allowed a preliminary provenance determination to be made, which was further investigated through the use of the petrographic and chemical analysis. It was found that the binder in the lime plasters from Stirling Castleâ€™s Palace Block were sourced within a five mile radius of the Castle, from a nodular limestone and a nearby outcrop of Murrayshall limestone. The outcrop of limestone was exposed along the Bannock Burn and was used from a West to East direction. Once the source became exhausted, the nodular limestone was employed. The aggregates were determined to be locally sourced from the River Forth. The samples were all found to represent a range of dates from the late 17 th Century to the early 19 th Century, representing the period of alteration performed to allow the Castle to host a garrison. The analysis also showed how the source of limestone altered over time and allowed for a sphere of influence to be determined based on the distances from which the material needed to produce the lime mortar, was sourced. This thesis will contribute new knowledge to the lack of data that exists in regards to the study of provenance using binder characterisation and isotopic analysis, in particular the use of LA-ICP-MS and ICP-MS. As such a new methodology for the examination of lime mortars by ICP-MS has been developed. Additionally this thesis will address a lack of knowledge that exists in regard to the materials used in the construction of Stirling Castle and the social implication implied by the results."
