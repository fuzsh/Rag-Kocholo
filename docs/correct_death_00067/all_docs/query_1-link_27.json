        "text": "Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, Sri Lankabhimanya (December 16, 1917–March 19, 2008) was a British science fiction author, inventor, and futurist, most famous for the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, written in collaboration with director Stanley Kubrick, a collaboration which led also to the film of the same name; and as a host and commentator in the British television series Mysterious World.[2][3]\n\nClarke served in the Royal Air Force as a radar instructor and technician from 1941-1946, proposed satellite communication systems in 1945[4][5] which won him the Franklin Institute Stuart Ballantine Gold Medal in 1963 and a nomination in 1994 for a Nobel Prize, and 1999 for literature [6], and became the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1947-1950 and again in 1953.[7] Later, he helped fight for the preservation of lowland gorillas.[8] He won the UNESCO-Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science in 1961.[9]\n\nClarke professed little interest in religious questions, but considered himself an atheist. He was knighted in 1998.[10] He emigrated to Sri Lanka in 1956 largely to pursue his interest in scuba diving,[11] and lived there until his death.\n\nBiography\n\nClarke was born in Minehead, Somerset, England.[12] As a boy he enjoyed stargazing and reading old American science fiction pulp magazines. After secondary school and studying at Huish's Grammar School, Taunton, he was unable to afford a university education but instead took a job as an auditor in the pensions section of the Board of Education.[13]\n\nDuring the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force as a radar specialist in the early warning radar defense system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) radar as documented in the semi-autobiographical Glide Path, his only non-Science Fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use in the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a Corporal instructor on radar at No 9 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury. He was commissioned as a Pilot Officer (Technical Branch) on May 27, 1943.[14] He was promoted Flying Officer on November 27, 1943.[15] He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley and was demobilized with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. After the war he earned a first-class degree in mathematics and physics at King's College London.\n\nIn the postwar years, Clarke became the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1947-1950 and again in 1953.[6][16] Although he was not the originator of the concept of geostationary satellites, one of his most important contributions may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the BIS in 1945. The concept was published in Wireless World in October of that year.[17][18][19] Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight. The most notable of these may be The Exploration of Space (1951) and The Promise of Space (1968). In recognition of these contributions the geostationary orbit 36,000 kilometers (22,000 mi) above the equator is officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union as a \"Clarke Orbit.\"[20]\n\nIn 1953, Clarke met and quickly married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American divorcee with a young son. They separated permanently after six months, although the divorce was not finalized until 1964.[21] \"The marriage was incompatible from the beginning,\" says Clarke.[21] Clarke never remarried but was close to Leslie Ekanayake, who died in 1977. Journalists who inquired of Clarke whether he was gay were told, \"No, merely mildly cheerful.\"[22] However, Michael Moorcock has written, \"Everyone knew he was gay. In the 1950s I'd go out drinking with his boyfriend.\"\n\nWriting career\n\nWhile Clarke had a few stories published in fanzines, between 1937 and 1945, his first professional sales appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in 1946: \"Loophole\" was published in April, while \"Rescue Party,\" his first sale, was published in May. Along with his writing Clarke briefly worked as Assistant Editor of Science Abstracts (1949) before devoting himself to writing full-time from 1951 onward. Clarke also contributed to the Dan Dare series published in Eagle, and his first three published novels were written for children.\n\nClarke corresponded with C. S. Lewis in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, The Eastgate, to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke, after Lewis's death, voiced great praise for him, saying the Ransom Trilogy was one of the few works of science fiction that could be considered literature.\n\nIn 1948 he wrote \"The Sentinel\" for a BBC competition. Though the story was rejected it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only was it the basis for A Space Odyssey, but \"The Sentinel\" also introduced a more mystical and cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but prejudiced mankind confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of The City and the Stars (and its original version, Against the Fall of Night), Childhood's End, and the 2001 series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution. In Clarke's authorized biography, Neil McAleer writes that: \"many readers and critics still consider [Childhood's End] Arthur C. Clarke's best novel.\"[21]\n\nClarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, having emigrated there when it was still called Ceylon, first in Unawatuna on the south coast, and then in Colombo.[22] Clarke held citizenship of both the UK and Sri Lanka.[23] He was an avid scuba diver and a member of the Underwater Explorers Club. Living in Sri Lanka afforded him the opportunity to visit the ocean year-round. It also inspired the locale for his novel The Fountains of Paradise in which he described a space elevator. Clarke believed that space elevators will ultimately replace space shuttles obsolete, and that these moreso than geostationary satellites will be his main legacy.[24]\n\nHis many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of essays in various magazines that eventually became Profiles of the Future published in book form in 1962. A timetable[25] up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a \"global library\" for 2005.\n\nEarly in his career Clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel Childhood's End. He also said that he was one of several who were fooled by a Uri Geller demonstration at Birkbeck College. Although he eventually dismissed and distanced himself from nearly all pseudoscience he continued to advocate research into psychokinesis and similar phenomena.\n\nLast years\n\nIn the early 1970s Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was Rendezvous with Rama in 1973, which won him all the main genre awards and has spawned sequels that, along with the 2001 series, formed the backbone of his later career.\n\nIn 1975 Clarke's short story \"The Star\" was not included in a new high school English textbook in Sri Lanka because of concerns that it might offend Roman Catholics even though it had already been selected. The same textbook also caused controversy because it replaced Shakespeare's work with that of Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Isaac Asimov.\n\nIn the 1980s Clarke became well known to many for his television programmes Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World, Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe.\n\nIn 1986 he was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.[26]\n\nIn 1988 he was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, having originally contracted polio in 1959, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter.[22] Sir Arthur C Clarke was for many years a Vice Patron of the British Polio Fellowship.[27]\n\nIn the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka.\"[28] The same year he became the first Chancellor of the International Space University, serving from 1989 to 2004 and he also served as Chancellor of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002.\n\nIn 1994, Clarke appeared in a science fiction film; he portrayed himself in the telefilm Without Warning, an American production about an apocalyptic alien first contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast.\n\nOn May 26, 2000 he was made a Knight Bachelor \"for services to literature\" at a ceremony in Colombo.[29] The award of a knighthood had been announced in the 1998 New Year Honours,[30] but investiture with the award had been delayed, at Clarke's request, because of an accusation, by the British tabloid The Sunday Mirror, of paedophilia.[31] [32] The charge was subsequently found to be baseless by the Sri Lankan police.[33][34][35][36][37] According to The Daily Telegraph (London), the Mirror subsequently published an apology.[38] Clarke was then duly knighted.\n\nIn September 2007, he provided a video greeting for NASA's Cassini probe's flyby of Iapetus (which plays an important role in 2001: A Space Odyssey).\n\nIn December 2007 on his ninetieth birthday, Clarke recorded a video message to his friends and fans bidding them good-bye.[39]\n\nClarke died in Sri Lanka on March 19, 2008 after suffering from breathing problems, according to Rohan de Silva, one of his aides,[40][41][22][42] only a few days after he had reviewed the final manuscript of his latest work, The Last Theorem, co-written with Frederik Pohl.[43][44] He was buried in Colombo in traditional Sri Lankan fashion on March 22, with his younger brother, Fred Clarke, and his Sri Lankan adoptive family among the thousands in attendance.[45]\n\nPosition on religion\n\nThemes of religion and spirituality appear in much of Clarke's writing. In 2000, Clarke told the Sri Lankan newspaper, The Island, \"I don't believe in God or an afterlife,\"[46] and he identifies himself as an atheist.[47] He was honored as a Humanist Laureate in the International Academy of Humanism.[48] He has also described himself as a \"crypto-Buddhist,\" insisting that Buddhism is not a religion.[49] He displayed little interest about religion early in his life, for example, only discovering a few months after marrying his wife, that she had strong Presbyterian beliefs.\n\nIn a three-day interview described as \"a dialogue on man and his world\" with Alan Watts, Clarke said that he could not forgive religions for the atrocities and wars over time and admitted a bias against religion in a 1972 interview.[50]\n\nIn his introduction to the penultimate episode of Mysterious World, entitled, Strange Skies, Clarke said, \"I sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers.\"\n\nNear the very end of that same episode, the last segment of which covered the Star of Bethlehem, he stated that his favorite theory was that it might be a pulsar. Given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story, The Star (1955), and making Mysterious World (1980), and given the more recent discovery of pulsar PSR B1913+16, he said, \"how romantic, if even now, we can hear the dying voice of a star, which heralded the Christian era.\"\n\nClark left written instructions for a funeral that stated, \"absolutely no religious rites of any kind, relating to any religious faith, should be associated with my funeral.\"[51]\n\nThemes, style, and influences\n\nClarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the solar system. His early-published stories would usually feature the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough into the underlying decadence of his own society.\n\n\"The Sentinel\" (1948) introduced a spiritual theme into Clarke's work, a theme that he later explored more deeply in The City and the Stars (and its earlier version, Against the Fall of Night). His interest in the paranormal was influenced by Charles Fort and embraced the belief that humanity may be the property of an ancient alien civilization. Surprisingly for a writer who is often held up as an example of hard science fiction's obsession with technology, three of Clarke's novels have this as a theme. Another theme of \"The Sentinel\" was the notion that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods, which was also explored in his 1953 novel Childhood's End. He also briefly touched upon this idea in his novel Imperial Earth. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book Last and First Men that \"No other book had a greater influence on my life ... [It] and its successor Star Maker (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career.\"[52]\n\nAdapted screenplays\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nClarke's first venture into film was the Stanley Kubrick directed 2001: A Space Odyssey. Kubrick and Clarke had met in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, it was decided that the story for the film was to be loosely based on Clarke's short story \"The Sentinel,\" written in 1948 as an entry in a BBC short story competition. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but this proved to be more tedious than he had estimated. Instead, Kubrick and Clarke decided it would be best to write a novel first and then adapt it for the film upon its completion. However, as Clarke was finishing the book, the screenplay was also being written simultaneously.\n\nClarke's influence on the directing of 2001: A Space Odyssey is also felt in one of the most memorable scenes in the movie when astronaut Bowman shuts down HAL by removing modules from service one by one. As this happens, we witness HAL's consciousness degrading. By the time HAL's logic is completely gone, he begins singing the song Daisy Bell. This song was chosen based on a visit by Clarke to his friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility. A speech synthesis demonstration by physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr was taking place. Kelzly was using an IBM 704 computer to synthesize speech. His voice recorder synthesizer, vocoder, reproduced the vocal for Daisy Bell, with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews. Arthur C. Clarke was so impressed that he later told Kubrick to use it in this climactic scene.[53]\n\nDue to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelization, and that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film is a bold artistic piece with little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of \"cause and effect\" for the events in the novel. James Randi later recounted that upon seeing 2001 for the first time, Clarke left the movie theater during the first break crying because he was so upset about how the movie had turned out.[54] Despite their differences, both film and novel were well received.[55][56][57]\n\nIn 1972, Clarke published The Lost Worlds of 2001, which included his account of the production and alternate versions of key scenes. The \"special edition\" of the novel A Space Odyssey (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke, documenting his account of the events leading to the release of the novel and film.\n\n2010\n\nIn 1982 Clarke continued the 2001 epic with a sequel, 2010: Odyssey Two. This novel was also made into a film, 2010, directed by Peter Hyams for release in 1984. Due to the political environment in America in the 1980s, the novel and film present a Cold War theme, with the looming tensions of nuclear warfare. The film was not the revolutionary artistic success that 2001 was, but the reviews were still positive.\n\nClarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984. Titled The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010, and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on different continents. The book also includes Clarke's list of the best science-fiction films ever made.\n\nEssays and short stories\n\nMost of Clarke's essays (from 1934 to 1998) can be found in the book Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds! (2000). Most of his short stories can be found in the book The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke (2001). Another collection of early essays was published in The View from Serendip (1977), which also included one short piece of fiction, \"When the Twerms Came.\" He wrote short stories under the pseudonyms of E. G. O'Brien and Charles Willis.\n\nConcept of the geostationary communications satellite\n\nClarke's most important scientific contribution may be his idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. He described this concept in a paper titled Extra-Terrestrial Relays—Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?,[58] published in Wireless World in October 1945. The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honor.\n\nHowever, it is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. John R. Pierce, of Bell Labs, arrived at the idea independently in 1954 and he was actually involved in the Echo satellite and Telstar projects. Moreover, Pierce stated that the idea was \"in the air\" at the time and certain to be developed regardless of Clarke's publication. Nevertheless, Clarke described the idea so thoroughly that his article has been cited as prior art in judgments denying patents on the concept.\n\nThough different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating with satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in Hermann Oberth's 1923 book Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen[59](The Rocket into Interplanetary Space) and then the idea of radio communication with those satellites in Herman Poto_nik's (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums—der Raketen-Motor[60] section: Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety [61] published in Berlin. Clarke acknowledged the earlier concept in his book Profiles of the Future.[62]\n\nLegacy\n\nFollowing the release of 2001, Clarke became much in demand as a commentator on science and technology, especially at the time of the Apollo space program. The Command Module of the Apollo 13 craft named \"Odyssey.\" In 1986, Clarke provided a grant to fund the prize money (initially £1,000) for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for the best science fiction novel published in Britain in the previous year. In 2001 the prize was increased to £2,001, and its value now matches the year (e.g., £2,005 in 2005). Clarke served as a distinguished vice-president of the H. G. Wells Society, whose influence Clarke acknowledged.\n\nAwards, honors and other recognition\n\nClarke shared a 1969 Academy Award nomination with Stanley Kubrick in the category, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen for 2001: A Space Odyssey.[63] Clarke received a CBE in 1989,[28] and was knighted in 2000.[30][29] Clarke's health did not allow him to travel to London to receive the honor personally from the Queen, so the United Kingdom's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka invested him as a Knight Bachelor at a ceremony in Colombo. In 1994, Clarke was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by law professor Glenn Reynolds.[64] In 1999, Clarke was nominated for a Nobel Literature Prize[65] by professor Petar Bosnic Petrus. On November 14, 2005 Sri Lanka awarded Arthur C. Clarke its highest civilian award, the Sri Lankabhimanya (The Pride of Sri Lanka), for his contributions to science and technology and his commitment to his adopted country.\n\nPartial bibliography\n\nNovels\n\nPrelude to Space (1951)\n\nThe Sands of Mars (1951)\n\nIslands in the Sky (1952)\n\nAgainst the Fall of Night (1948, 1953) original version of The City and the Stars\n\nChildhood's End (1953)\n\nEarthlight (1955)\n\nThe City and the Stars (1956)\n\nThe Deep Range (1957)\n\nA Fall of Moondust (1961)\n\nDolphin Island (1963)\n\nGlide Path (1963)\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nRendezvous with Rama (1972)\n\nA Meeting with Medusa (1972)\n\nImperial Earth (1975)\n\nThe Fountains of Paradise (1979)\n\n2010: Odyssey Two (1982)\n\nThe Songs of Distant Earth (1986)\n\n2061: Odyssey Three (1988)\n\nCradle (1988) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nRama II (1989) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nBeyond the Fall of Night (1990) (with Gregory Benford)\n\nThe Ghost from the Grand Banks (1990)\n\nThe Garden of Rama (1991) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nRama Revealed (1993) (with Gentry Lee)\n\nThe Hammer of God (1993)\n\nRichter 10 (1996) (with Mike McQuay)\n\n3001: The Final Odyssey (1997)\n\nThe Trigger (1999) (with Michael P.
