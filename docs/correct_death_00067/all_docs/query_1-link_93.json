        "text": "The news of Arthur C Clarke’s death took me back to 1983, when I was a student at Columbia University’s journalism school. I interviewed Clarke for one of the biggest stories of my career and in the process earned my 15 minutes of fame.\n\nA few weeks into the semester, India Today magazine carried an interview with Satyajit Ray. The interviewer asked Ray about a script he had written in the 1960s — The Alien — and whether he still planned to make it into a film. Ray’s response was that two of Steven Spielberg’s films – Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. (1982) would not have been possible, had it not been for the fact that there were several copies of The Alien’s script circulating in Hollywood.\n\nArthur Clarke suggested that Ray should take up the issue with Spielberg&nbsp;\n\nRay had not seen E.T. But Clarke, his friend, had seen it in London. And Clarke told Ray that there were a lot of similarities between E.T. and The Alien, the script. He suggested that Ray should raise the issue with Spielberg and not take it lying down.\n\nRay had shown his script to Clarke in 1967 and the writer connected the film-maker to Hollywood. Columbia Pictures planned to produce the film. Shooting was scheduled to begin in 1969, but the project was shelved after several delays.\n\nThe India Today story reminded me of author Marie Seton’s biography, Portrait of a Director: Satyajit Ray. In it, she had reproduced Ray’s sketches of the alien, which looked very similar to Spielberg’s creatures that we met towards the end of Close Encounters.\n\nArmed with the story idea, I went to see a professor at Columbia. One of the courses in the programme was writing for a news service. Students were expected to develop feature stories, which would then be sold to publications across the US.\n\nMy professor’s response was something like this: “Great idea! But you have to interview Ray, Clarke and most important, Spielberg. The story can only work if you get all the players to speak.”\n\nSomehow I accepted the challenge and the next few weeks were extremely exhilarating — stuff that most reporters can only dream about.\n\nI wrote a letter with a set of questions to Clarke, through his agent at Random House. The agent would not give me Clarke’s direct address in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Then, maybe because I was becoming impatient, through the AT&T international operator, I managed to get two very important phone numbers — Seton’s in London (Seton gave me Ray’s direct number in Kolkata) and Clarke’s in Colombo. Both the numbers were listed.\n\nI remember sitting in my dorm room in New York City, dialling Clarke’s Colombo number and the author picked up the phone. I was shaking at the thought of talking to one of the greatest writers of the century (I had a similar sensation when I talked to Ray from the same room). And I remember Clarke to be very friendly and receptive to talking to a young student.\n\n“I’ve suggested that he (Ray) should write politely to Spielberg and say, ‘Look, there are a lot of similarities here.’” Clarke told me. “But don’t make any charges or threats. It has been around almost 20 years,” he added, referring to The Alien script, “and it’s quite possible that one can unconsciously pick up ideas. I mean, even if Spielberg did get it — and I am not saying that he did — he may not even know that he may have unconsciously got these ideas from Ray. But if so, if the identification is good enough, it’s up to Spielberg to do something.”\n\nMy story broke out at the peak of the Oscar season, when E.T. was in stiff competition with Gandhi and created a mini sensation in Hollywood.\n\nA few weeks after the Oscar ceremony, where E.T. lost to Gandhi, I received a letter from Random House. The author — an assistant, I suppose — wrote that Arthur C Clarke was too busy to answer my questions, but he appreciated my interest in his work.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed here are the author's own.
