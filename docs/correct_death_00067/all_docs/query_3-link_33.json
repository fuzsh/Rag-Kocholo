Clarke, a visionary science fiction writer who wrote “2001: A Space Odyssey” and won worldwide acclaim with more than 100 books on space, science and the future, died early today, an aide said. He was 90.\n\nClarke, who had battled debilitating post-polio syndrome for years, died in his adopted home of Sri Lanka after suffering breathing problems, aide Rohan De Silva said.\n\nThe 1968 story “2001: A Space Odyssey” — written simultaneously as a novel and a screenplay with director Stanley Kubrick — was a frightening prophesy of artificial intelligence run amok.\n\nOne year after it made Clarke a household name in fiction, the scientist entered the homes of millions of Americans alongside Walter Cronkite anchoring TV coverage of the Apollo mission to the moon.\n\nClarke also was credited with the concept of communications satellites in 1945, decades before they became a reality. Geosynchronous orbits, which keep satellites in a fixed position relative to the ground, are called Clarke orbits.\n\nHis nonfiction volumes on space travel and his explorations of the Great Barrier Reef and Indian Ocean earned him respect in the world of science, and in 1976, he became an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n\nBut it was his writing that shot him to his greatest fame and gave him the greatest fulfillment.\n\n“Sometimes, I am asked how I would like to be remembered,” Clarke said recently. “I have had a diverse career as a writer, underwater explorer and space promoter. Of all these, I would like to be remembered as a writer.”\n\nFrom 1950, he began a prolific output of both fiction and nonfiction, sometimes publishing three books in a year. He published his best-selling “3001: The Final Odyssey” when he was 79.\n\nA statement from Clarke’s office said Clarke had recently reviewed the final manuscript of his latest novel. “The Last Theorem,” co-written with Frederik Pohl, will be published later this year.\n\nSome of his best-known books are “Childhood’s End,” 1953; “The City and The Stars,” 1956, “The Nine Billion Names of God,” 1967; “Rendezvous with Rama,” 1973; “Imperial Earth,” 1975; and “The Songs of Distant Earth,” 1986.\n\nWhen Clarke and Kubrick got together to develop a movie about space, they used as basic ideas several of Clarke’s shorter pieces, including “The Sentinel,” written in 1948, and “Encounter in the Dawn.” As work progressed on the screenplay, Clarke also wrote a novel of the story. He followed it up with “2010,” “2061,” and “3001: The Final Odyssey.”\n\nIn 1989, two decades after the Apollo 11 moon landings, Clarke wrote: “2001 was written in an age which now lies beyond one of the great divides in human history; we are sundered from it forever by the moment when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out on to the Sea of Tranquility. Now history and fiction have become inexorably intertwined.”\n\nClarke won the Nebula Award of the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1972, 1974 and 1979, and the Hugo Award of the World Science Fiction Convention in 1974 and 1980, and in 1986 became Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He was awarded the Commander of Order of the British Empire in 1989.\n\nBorn in Minehead, western England, on Dec. 16, 1917, the son of a farmer, Arthur Charles Clark became addicted to science fiction after buying his first copies of the pulp magazine “Amazing Stories.”\n\nOriginally Published: March 18, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
