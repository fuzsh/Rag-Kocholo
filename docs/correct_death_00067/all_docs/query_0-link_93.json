I have transcribed the Northern State Hospital register entry for J.R. Nucklas and that transcription is attached as a Word document. I was also able to locate a death certificate for him, which I have scanned and attached, as well. I think I mentioned on the phone that the register entry indicated that he was buried in the hospital cemetery. However, the death certificate and death register (which I didn't scan  it only has duplicate information on the other two documents I have provided) both indicate that his body was sent to the University of Washington. If you still want a hard copy of either document, please let me know and I can mail them to you. I hope this information is useful to you. Please let me know if you have further questions. Kind Regards, Megan Shoemaker Washington State Archives Bellingham, Washington Tel: 360.650.2813 Cell: 360.485.5822 [email protected]\n\n[HI10743] (Research):I checked and was unable to locate a death record or an obituary for James Nuckles/Nuckols.

Rese archer, Mary Kegley, of Wythe County found the record for me in the baseme nt of the courthouse. Have made three trips to Wythe Co., VA trying to located the marriage reco rd of Elizabeth Nuckolls and William A. Pope. I do not think the marria ge was ever recorded and neither was the marriage of her sister, Nancy Nuc kolls to Abner Thompson. Author and researcher Mary Kegley of Wythe Co. to ld me that she has never been able to find these marriages either. I ha ve also searched neighboring counties of Grayson and Carroll. I do have co urt documents for this family Martha Gwen Williams [email protected] Soon after the 4th child was born, Elizabeth died and William A. Pope rema rried Elizabeth Rickee (Rickey) in 1845. I believe Elizabeth is buri ed in the same Catron Cemetery as William A. Pope. William A. Pope's na me was placed on gravestone, Elizabeth is possibly buried beside h im in an unmarked grave (she died much earlier than he).His second wife d id not wish to be buried at this location and is buried across the creek w ith their son Ezra, Ezra's wife, and one of their children. Over 40 unmar ked grave exist in this cemetery! I believe that many of these graves belo ng to the Nathaniel Nuckolls Family Elizabeth Nuckolls Pope is on the 1840 Wythe Co., VA Census in the age gro up 20-30, therefore she would have been born between 1810 and 1820.

He was born on July 24, 1918. He was a son of James and Alice (Hammond) Nuckles. He attended elementary school through the fifth grade in the England or Sherill communities in Lonoke County, Arkansas. After he became of age as a young man, he was called upon to serve this nation by serving in the United States Army for four and one-half years during the theater in Europe during World War II. William was captured by the German forces and spent approximately three months in a German prison camp as a prisoner of war (P.O.W.)William had joined the Assembly of God Church as a young man. On June 15, 1962, William \"Snookie\" joined the Central Baptist Church in Sherill, Arkansas and was baptized that same night. He met and fell in love with a sweet young lady named, Edna Faye Williams. After a courtship, they became engaged and later married by Justice of the Peace, C. W. Meador at the local drug store in Dumas, Arkansas on June 27, 1948. Together, they resided in Dumas having raised five children. The names of the children are: James Gordon Nuckles, Shirley Nuckles, Sammy Nuckles, Jerry Nuckles and Phyllis Kaye Nuckles (Lunsford). William Gordon Nuckles, was a true American war hero, having suffered at the hands of the Germans under duress and extremely harsh conditions that affected his respitory health for years after his release and honorable discharge from the United States Army. His experience as a Prisoner of War had always haunted his mind but never weakened his resolve to finish the course to defend freedom and to liberate a captive people as he was sent to do. Recently, he was awarded posthumously, many more war medals in a local ceremony on November 5, 2011 at the American Legion in Dumas, Arkansas. (See attached photos of this account) His two daughters, Shirley and Kaye, were presented the American flag and also a proclamation in honor of his service as a soldier and prisoner of war. This high honor was belated but brought much pride to his daughters, nieces, nephews, and other relatives and friends that were in attendance of this honorable event. (See additional story on this site for the proclamation from United States Senator, John Boozman in honor of William Gordon Nuckles)William Gordon Nuckles, served his God, served his Nation, and above all served his family with hard work, devotion and with a bountiful enduring love. William Nuckles passed away on February 7, 1965 from complications from pneumonia, a chronic respitory ailment that persisted since his days that weakened his lungs during his captivity on foreign soil. He gave up his spirit on that cold day and went to be in the presence of his Savior and Lord. On the day of his funeral, many stood in the rain, or got under the crowded tent as the heavens poured out heavy drops of rain as if tears flowed from the throne of God himself on that somber sad winter day near England, Arkansas at the 'Mulberry Cemetery.'William Gordon Nuckles, was laid to rest, he later recieved a military issue flat gravestone marking his place of interment and also indicated his service to this great free Republic fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. (See gravestone photo)He is missed by all who knew him and are looking forward to the day when a reunion in Heaven takes place sometimes in the future. He served his God, family and Nation well !! Rest forever upon the everlasting eternal arms of your blessed Redeemer, Lord and Master.

Nuckolls. Just discovered your website for the Nuckolls family - my great grandmoth er was Sarah Belle Nuckles, daughter of Calvin Nuckles (b ~1810, d. aft er 1870)and Hester Ann Graham (Grimes) (b.~1820,d. after 1870). Sarah Be lle (1851-1918)was the second wife of Thomas Altizer, my maternal great gr andfather. They were married in McDowell Co., WV, and lived their li fe in Tazewell Co., VA where my grandmother and my mother were born/raise d. My grandmother was Lydia Cordillia Altizer, married Robert Timothy Ril ey, lived most of their life in Tazewell Co., then McDowell Co., WV. I believe that Calvin was son of Nathaniel Nuckles (b. 1757, d 1823), wi th 2nd wife Martha (Patsy) Toler. This is based on records obtained fr om another researcher, and were from the files of a Ruth Kidd. B. F. Nuck olls speaks of Calvin in Pioneer Settlers of Grayson Co., VA., but he h as a younger Nathaniel (b. 1789)listed as Calvin's father. I believe he m ay have had the wrong information, have seen it both ways in the LDS recor ds. Seems like that Nathaniel was very young to have had several childr en and been married twice by the time Calvin was born in 1810.

I was 15 yrs old & in Jr. High School. When I came home from school Daddy was in the living room with the tv on & reading his news paper. I asked \" Where's Nanny ?\" He said she was in bed. Said she had fallen & wouldn't let him call an ambulance. I went in to see her & you could tell she was hurt & in pain. I tried to talk to her & she still refused an ambulance ride to the hospital. I suggested we take her. \" NO !! \" She had never been in a hospital & she wasn't going then either ! I begged her to let me do something, anything. She said \" Call Grace \" So I called her sister Grace & she said bring her there ! This was ridiculous, but if it got her to the hospital then it was all we could do. She couldn't walk. I have no idea how she got into the house after her fall. Well, I picked her up & carried her to the car. Daddy & I took her to Aunt Grace's house & Aunt Grace wouldn't take no for an answer, she was going to the hospital whether she liked it or not ! You didn't mess around with her; Aunt Grace was a tough old bird & you did what she said or she'd pinch ! Nanny went to the hospital & had hip surgery, then to a convalescent center next to Baylor, where she had the surgery. I rode the city bus there every day after school. I was the only one going. I tried feeding her & she refused to eat. The only thing I could get her to eat was grapes. It broke my heart to see her like that. That is where she died. When she died, the nephew that was there with her, it may have been Carlton, was the nephew she was there to help with his birth. She saw him into this world & he saw out.

I remember they lived on Ann Street in Dallas, not far from my Clark grandmother, whom lived on Ann Street in a 2 story white house. He smoked sweet smelling cigars in a darkened room that had heavy drapes & heavy, bulky furniture, upholstered in a tapestry type material of dark colors. There was a smoking stand & a floor lamp next to his chair. The smoke would curl slowly up & around the lamp & shade of white or cream color. He wore suspenders & dark pants with dark colored shirts.

He undertook huge projects: he built most of the \"modem\" (in the 1920's) buildings on the William and Mary College campus in Williamsburg, VA as well as the P. Lorillard and Company buildings in Richmond, VA. Now, both John Thomas, Sr. and Annie Dean Warren Bowden died before I was born, so I did not know my grandparents personally, although I have heard some funny stories about both of them. For his time, JTN, Sr. was very well to do, but he was also very frugal. There was a fee per person for people riding across the bridge over the James River in Richmond, and he made the children get out of the car and walk across the bridge although he could easily have afforded the minimum fee. I think he was tight, but he may also have been concerned that his children might feel superior because of his wealth. He was very private-secretive even. For a number of years he had supported several poor families in Richmond without the knowledge of his own family. They found out about his generosity only when the families attended John Thomas' funeral to express their gratitude for his support.\n\n[DI11258] Per recording of will on June 6, 1933, dated October 31, 1932, Buckingham County Will Book 3) resided in Richmond, Virginia.

He began working with his brother Elmo in Nuckols Construction. His family always called him Ed or Edmund. His name was George E. for anything that was govemmental- for the Navy the rule was 1 st name, middle initial, with no exceptions and he maintained that form for his years in the Veteran's Administration Loan Guarantee Division. He inspected houses built for World War II wounded or paraplegic veterans. Woe be to any contractor who tried to cheat or short change a vet! He worked for the Veteran's Administration for over 20 years. Mary Lovie was a lab technologist. Daddy was named after his grandfather, Edmund Smith Nuckols. His grandfather preferred the name Edward and went by that incorrect name. I was glad to see that the Nuckols Kindred got his name correct. JTN, Sr. surely knew his father's correct name; it clearly should be Edmund, just as he named Daddy. He married Mary Lovie Floyd; she was always called by both names: Mary Lovie. They had 2 children: Ann Marie Nuckols (Harrison) and Mary Lu Nuckols (Yavenditti). I was named in honor of my maternal grandmother (Luphelia Herring Floyd) but thank heavens Mother only changed the spelling of my middle name and did not stick me with Luphelia. Although he had 2 young daughters, my father, George Edmund Nuckols volunteered at age 38 to join the Navy in their Construction Battalion, called the Sea Bees. He could easily have avoided service, but he volunteered to go. He served as a Drill Instructor and became a Chief Petty Officer. He was offered a promotion, but refused it because he wanted to stay with his men.[The Sea Bees were responsible for building airstrips, housing, roads, bases etc so they were usually the first group ashore. They preceded the Marines who needed those roads and airstrips. Okinawa was still under attack when the Sea Bees landed. Daddy was hit, but the Japanese bullet was stopped by an old Zippo lighter in his left breast pocket over his heart which saved his life. He kept that old Zippo as long as he lived.\n\n[DI11268] Richmond Times-Dispatch (VA) - September 8, 1992 Deceased Name: Nuckols, George Edmund Nuckols, George Edmund, 87, of Winston-Salem, N.C., formerly of Richmon d, a Navy veteran of World War II and retired assistant loan guaranty offi cer with the Veterans Administration, widower of Mary Lovie Floyd Nuckols.
