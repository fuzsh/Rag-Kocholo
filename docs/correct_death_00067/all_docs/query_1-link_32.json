        "text": "Servo (57069) on 3/19/2008 1:18 AM · Permalink · Report\n\nLink\n\n<hr>\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka - Arthur C. Clarke, a visionary science fiction writer who won worldwide acclaim with more than 100 books on space, science and the future, died Wednesday in his adopted home of Sri Lanka, an aide said. He was 90.\n\nClarke, who had battled debilitating post-polio syndrome since the 1960s and sometimes used a wheelchair, died at 1:30 a.m. local time after suffering breathing problems, aide Rohan De Silva told The Associated Press.\n\nClarke was regarded as a technological seer as well as a science-fiction writer, and was known as \"the godfather of the telecommunications satellite.\"\n\nHis most famous novel, \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" was the basis of the 1968 film of the same name, co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film and the book elevated the plot's mentally unbalanced computer, HAL 9000, into the pantheon of great fictional characters.\n\nThree \"2001\" book sequels followed, and one of them — \"2010\" — was made into a movie as well.\n\nIn addition to the \"2001\" series, some of Clarke's best-known works are \"Childhood's End\" (1953), \"The City and the Stars\" (1956), \"The Nine Billion Names of God\" (1967), \"Imperial Earth\" (1975) and \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" (1986). His 1973 novel \"Rendezvous With Rama\" is reportedly being adapted for film, with actor Morgan Freeman as producer and star.\n\nA statement from the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation said that Clarke had recently reviewed the final manuscript of his latest novel. “The Last Theorem,” co-written with Frederik Pohl, will be published later this year, the foundation said.\n\nClarke won the Nebula Award of the Science Fiction Writers of America in 1972, 1974 and 1979; the Hugo Award of the World Science Fiction Convention in 1974 and 1980, and in 1986 became Grand Master of the Science Fiction Writers of America. He became an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1976, and was awarded British knighthood in 1989.<hr>\n\nArthur C. Clarke is probably my favorite author; \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" is my favourite book of all time, and seeing \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" in 70mm with 6 channel sound can't be beat!\n\nDepeche Mike (17454) on 3/19/2008 3:22 AM · Permalink · Report\n\nMorgan Freeman and David Fincher have been trying to get Rendezvous With Rama off the ground for quite a while but they can't get any writer to script it properly. All the screenwriters that have taken a crack at it have inserted lots of explosions and action. So it's still docked at the moment.\n\nArthur C Clarke was a brilliant man and always gave the the feeling that he knew more then he led on. He was one of a kind and there won't be anyone ever like him. I think it's kinda sad how under-appreciated he was these last few decades but his legacy will constantly be reminded to everyone as his imaginings become realities over the next decades.\n\nShoddyan (15006) on 3/21/2008 3:32 AM · Permalink · Report\n\nJust thought I'd quickly mention that Clarke himself makes cameos in the Sierra version of Rama. Despite the name, it's based almost entirely on the Rama II book and is a first person adventure game (e.g. Myst-like) rather than the typical side-scrolling Sierra adventure game.\n\nIf you have the game and are wondering how to get Arttie to show up? Well... just manage to do something that will kill your character and lose the game. In many of these, Arthur Clarke will personally appear on the screen and offer hints on how to succeed or simply chide you for some of the more obvious goofs. I think there might also be some bonus features with Clarke. Naturally since I'm writing a post about it, I can't seem to find which box I put my copy in..."
