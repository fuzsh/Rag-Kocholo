        "text": "SETI@home Users Dedication to the Memory of Sir Arthur C Clarke\n\nBritish born Author, Science Fiction Writer and SETI@home supporter Arthur C Clarke died on the 18th of march 2008 in his adopted home country of Sri Lanka.\n\nSir Arthur C. Clarke was one of the visionaries of our time. Through the vehicle of his research, time spent actively exciting the imagination of many people through his novels, stories and what was seen on the Big Screen. That vision is evidenced in a portion of the users here at Seti and many other BOINC Projects. Because of his belief in the chance that Seti could find that we are not alone in the universe. Sir Arthur C Clarke was chosen to represent Seti. His signing for information released from Seti to the public and other communications with other groups have provided a means that the lack of government/corporate funding should not kill a very important project. He inspired \"us\" as a single user here, that \"we\" together can make a difference.\n\nCollectively, we have read his books and many remember the first really visual look at the future 2001: a Space Odyssey. To an extent it set the bar for what the public expected as a viewed reality for movies and television with respect to Space and interaction with aliens.\n\nHe has touched our lives in a positive manor; we will miss that inspiration and help.\n\nOur Greatest Respect,\n\nSeti Users\n\nSome links and news stories about Arthur C. Clarke\n\nNew York Times\n\ndBTechno\n\nCNET News.com\n\nGuardian\n\nInformationWeek\n\nSpace.com\n\nSome youtube videos about Arthur C Clarke\n\nSir Arthur C Clarke: 90th Birthday Reflections\n\nArthur C.

Clarke by SETI@home users\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nHe was a great man who captured the imagination of millions. Its a great loss.\n\nBy; Johnney Guinness\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n. . . a sad day indeed, he shall be missed to say the least\n\nBy Dr. C.E.T.I.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI have enjoyed his books...and have benefited from his technological vision...I will miss his presence on this planet...\n\nArthur C. Clarke...and the message he sent for his 90th birthday.\n\nBy; Daniel Michel\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nRest in peace, Sir.\n\nBy; mrgrey\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSir Arthur was a great friend of this project. Rest in peace, Sir Arthur.\n\nBy; Fuzzy Hollynoodles\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI won't say \"I will miss him\", because I never knew him. But I know I will miss his wonderful books, and that they will never be missing from my bookshelves. Thanks for the stories.\n\nBy; Ice\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a sad day. The passing of a Very Great Person, he was concerned about many things in life (in many areas of science) that he felt important. One of those small things that he felt was important is Seti.\n\nWhat is not known was that the Donation Letter for the current Donation drive (and others) were always sent to Sir Arthur Clarke for approval. One other thing that followed was a small check from Sir Arthur showing his support for the SETI@home project.\n\nThis year, there was no response when the letter was sent to Sir Arthur, now \"we\" know why.\n\nRest In Peace, Fair Winds and Following Seas!\n\nor the mis-quoted, \"Straight on until tomorrow to the first star on the left.\"\n\nRegards\n\nBy; Al (pappa)\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nArthur C Clarke was born in Minehead in Somerset (UK), a small town just down the coast from where I live.\n\nA sad day indeed\n\nBy; Andy Worth\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nArthur C's writings will now freeze in time, the fate of all of us.\n\nRest in peace\n\nBy; The Curmudgeon\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA very sad Day and a very bad News.\n\nSETI@Home loosed a very great Friend of this Project.\n\nRest in Peace Sir Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nRegards SEARCHER\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nMy heart is broken.\n\nTeam ACC - Arthur C. Clarke Fans\n\nSir Arthur C. Clarke\n\nBy; candorchasma\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nR.I.P\n\nGreetings from Germany NRW\n\nBy; Sir Ulli\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nJust look up, my friends. farewell to our friend and benefactor Arthur.\n\nBy; msattler\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis site provides a small glimpse into the impact Arthur C. Clarke had. Unbelievably impressive.\n\nBy; Philadelphia\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nArthur C. Clarke now joins Isaac Asimov in the stars of our memories. My early years were very much shaped by both of those great men. They towered over SF in a way that is now unimaginable. I love the fact that they knew in a way that they were rivals but also knew that they were colleagues and they were, of course, the greatest of friends.\n\nBoth those great men were also the nicest, kindest and most generous people it is possible to imagine.\n\nMay not just their books and memory linger on but also their philosophy on life, the world and everything.\n\nI owe an awful lot to both.\n\nBy; KWSN Ekky Ekky Ekky\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nArthur C. Clark was one of my favorite Authors. I especially remember one of his books of short stories, \"Tales of The White Hart\". Truly one of the great authors.\n\nBy; John McLeod VII\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA great loss to science and fiction. His writing bought the two together in an exciting and accessible way..even now I use his short stories in my classes to help illustrate principles from physics to my students. I hope I can ignite their enthusiasm for the subject in the way his writing helped ignite my own.\n\n\"I don't pretend we have all the answers. But the questions are certainly worth thinking about..\" ~ Arthur C. Clarke\n\nBy; Es99\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWe have lost a true visionary, and I enjoy a lot of his books. But probably what impressed me the most was his publication in Wireless World, February 1945, was his proposal for Geostationary Satellite Communications.\n\nBy; Andy (WinterKnight)\n\n-----------------------------------------------"
