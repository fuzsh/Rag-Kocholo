        "text": "Sir Arthur Charles Clarke (Arthur C. Clarke) CBE FRAS (16 December 1917 – 19 March 2008) was an English science-fiction writer, science writer, and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.\n\nHe co-wrote the screenplay for the 1968 film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", one of the most influential films of all time. Clarke was a science writer, an avid populariser of space travel, and a futurist of a distinguished ability. He wrote over a dozen books and many essays for popular magazines. In 1961, he received the Kalinga Prize, a UNESCO award for popularising science. Clarke's science and science-fiction writings earned him the moniker \"Prophet of the Space Age\". His science-fiction writings in particular earned him a number of Hugo and Nebula awards, which along with a large readership, made him one of the towering figures of the genre. For many years Clarke, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov were known as the \"Big Three\" of science fiction.\n\nClarke was a lifelong proponent of space travel. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the British Interplanetary Society. In 1945, he proposed a satellite communication system using geostationary orbits. He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946–1947 and again in 1951–1953.\n\nClarke emigrated from England to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving. That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient Koneswaram temple in Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his popularity in the 1980s, as the host of television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.\n\nClarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 \"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\". He was knighted in 1998 and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.\n\nBiography\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring the Second World War from 1941 to 1946, he served in the Royal Air Force as a radar specialist and was involved in the early-warning radar defense system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on ground-controlled approach (GCA) radar, as documented in the semiautobiographical \"Glide Path\", his only nonscience-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the Berlin Airlift of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a corporal instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, RAF Yatesbury in Wiltshire. He was commissioned as a pilot officer (technical branch) on 27 May 1943. He was promoted flying officer on 27 November 1943. He was appointed chief training instructor at RAF Honiley in Warwickshire and was demobilised with the rank of flight lieutenant.\n\nSri Lanka and diving\n\nClarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, first in Unawatuna on the south coast, and then in Colombo. Initially, his friend Mike Wilson and he travelled around Sri Lanka, diving in the coral waters around the coast with the Beachcombers Club. In 1957, during a dive trip off Trincomalee, Clarke discovered the underwater ruins of a temple (Koneswaram temple - The Temple of the Thousand Pillars), which would subsequently make the region popular with divers. He subsequently described it in his 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane. This was his second diving book after the 1956 The Coast of Coral. Though Clarke lived mostly in Colombo, he set up a small diving school and a simple dive shop near Trincomalee. He dived often at Hikkaduwa, Trincomalee, and Nilaveli.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government offered Clarke resident guest status in 1975. He was held in such high esteem that when fellow science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein came to visit, the Sri Lanka Air Force provided a helicopter to take them around the country. In the early 1970s, Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was \"Rendezvous with Rama\" in 1973, which won all the main genre awards and spawned sequels that along with the 2001 series formed the backbone of his later career.\n\nIn 1982, Clarke received the Marconi International Fellowship Award from Prince Claus of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1986, Clarke was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.\n\nIn 1988, he was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, having originally contracted polio in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter. Clarke was for many years a vice-patron of the British Polio Fellowship.\n\nIn the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours, Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka\". The same year, he became the first chancellor of the International Space University, serving from 1989 to 2004. He also served as chancellor of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002.\n\nIn 1994, Clarke appeared in a science-fiction film; he portrayed himself in the telefilm Without Warning, an American production about an apocalyptic alien first-contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast.\n\nClarke also became active in promoting the protection of gorillas and became a patron of the Gorilla Organization, which fights for the preservation of gorillas. When tantalum mining for mobile phone manufacture threatened the gorillas in 2001, he lent his voice to their cause. The dive shop that he set up continues to operate from Trincomalee through the Arthur C Clarke Foundation.\n\nTelevision series host\n\nIn the 1980s and early 90's, Clarke presented his television programs \"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\", \"Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers\", \"and Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe\".\n\nPersonal beliefs\n\nIntelligent life\n\nClarke believed, \"The best proof that there's intelligent life in outer space is the fact that it hasn't come here...the fact that we have not yet found the slightest evidence for life — much less intelligence — beyond this Earth does not surprise or disappoint me in the least. Our technology must still be laughably primitive; we may well be like jungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms, while the ether around them carries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime\"\n\nClarke also believed \"Two possibilities exist: Either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying\"\n\nParanormal phenomena\n\nEarly in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel Childhood's End. Citing the numerous promising paranormal claims that were shown to be fraudulent, Clarke described his earlier openness to the paranormal having turned to being \"an almost total sceptic\" by the time of his 1992 biography. During interviews, both in 1993 and 2004–2005, he stated that he did not believe in reincarnation, saying that there was no mechanism to make it possible, though he stated \"I'm always paraphrasing J. B. S. Haldane: 'The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it's stranger than we can imagine.'\"He described the idea of reincarnation as fascinating, but favored a finite existence.\n\nWikipedia article: Arthur C.
