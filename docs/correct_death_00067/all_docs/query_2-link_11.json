        "text": "Sir Arthur C. Clarke, legendary science fiction writer, has passed away at age 90. This video may have been his last message to the world.\n\nIt was uploaded to YouTube in December, and displays his enduring optimism — despite the dark cloud of failing health.\n\nThe golden age of space is only just beginning… Space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet.\n\nPeace was high on his mind as well.\n\nI hope that we have learned something from the most barbaric century in history — the twentieth. I would like to see us overcome our tribal factions, and begin to think and act as if we were one family. That would be real globalization.\n\nClarke said that if he was granted three wishes, he would want: proof of extra terrestrial life, freedom from dependence on oil, and an end to the civil war in Sri Lanka. Although he has had a diverse career in underwater exploration, space and science promotion, and communications technology the aging legend said that he would most like to be remembered as a writer.\n\nUpdate: The IEEE Spectrum has published a very recent interview with Clarke. You can listen to the audio of that meeting too.\n\nSee Also:\n\nArthur C. Clarke: The Wired Words\n\nMaelstrom II: ILM Independent Production of an Arthur C. Clarke Story\n\nMaelstrom II Short Film Delayed, Rough Footage Available Online\n\nHappy Birthday, Arthur C. Clarke!\n\nAging Might Not Be Inevitable\n\nThere are biological underpinnings to aging—and so researchers are investigating cell manipulations, transfusions of young blood, and chemical compounds that can mimic low-calorie diets.\n\nAir So Polluted It Can Kill Isn’t Being Taken Seriously Enough\n\nToxic air kills over half a million children every year, yet only once has air pollution been listed as a cause of death on a death certificate.\n\nWith AI Tools, Scientists Can Crack the Code of Life\n\nGoogle’s AI research lab DeepMind is steadily building knowledge of how genes and their products work inside the body—and how and why they sometimes go wrong.\n\nEverything You See Is a Computational Process, If You Know How to Look\n\nComputer scientist Lance Fortnow writes that by embracing the computations that surround us, we can begin to understand and tame our seemingly random world.\n\nIf Betelgeuse Explodes, Just How Bright Will It Get?\n\nThis supergiant star is in our celestial neighborhood, and it’s threatening to go supernova. What would that look like from down here?\n\nExtreme Hail Storms Are Wrecking Solar Farms—but Defending Them May Be Easier Than It Seems\n\nClimate change is making hail storms more intense, so designers have to find novel solutions to protect panels from expensive damage.\n\nThe UK’s NHS Going Digital Would Be Equivalent to Hiring Thousands of New Doctors\n\nMore than 30 million Brits have the NHS app. This represents an opportunity to transform the health service, which shadow health secretary Wes Streeting calls “an analog system in a digital age.”\n\nHurricane Beryl Isn’t a Freak Storm—It’s the Exact Nightmare Meteorologists Predicted\n\nA hot ocean provides the energy hurricanes need to grow—and can limit the cooling that happens in their wake, making it likelier that the storms that follow will be powerful ones."
