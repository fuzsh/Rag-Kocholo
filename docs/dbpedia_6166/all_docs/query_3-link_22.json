        "text": "The Fundamentals of Supply Chain Structure\n\nAt its very essence, a supply chain boils down to the process that helps a product or commodity move from the manufacturing stage to the market. This factors in the people, equipment, transportation, and technology involved in the processes that make up that sequence of events.\n\nWhile the word chain may imply a straight line that simply runs from raw materials, to the supplier, to the manufacturer, and then the consumer, in today's fast-paced and tech-infused global supply economy, a supply chain is more akin to an intricate web with the manufacturer at the heart.\n\nThese webs are referred to as supply chain modeling and they can vary, morph, and change depending on a businesses' unique supply chain requirements. Some supply chain models require flexibility and adaptability to frequent change, while others need outstanding levels of efficiency - especially in fiercely competitive markets or industries.\n\nNo matter the form, supply chain modeling is used to empower a company to make the correct supply chain decisions and adopt the best practices to bring order into the supply chain while ensuring it aligns with the operational objectives. These objectives can range from timely delivery to the ability to cope with threats or disruptions.\n\nMost Common Supply Chain Models\n\nSupply chain models can be broken down into two primary categories - efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nThe efficient models tend to work best in highly competitive industries or markets that are schedule-based with an aim to maximize efficiency across the supply chain and utilize all assets at a lower cost. A responsive supply chain model, on the other hand, is used primarily in industries or markets with high levels of uncertainty or when mediation costs are the highest priority.\n\nThe following 3 supply chain models are categorized under the efficiency category-\n\n1. The Efficient Supply Chain Model\n\nWith a focus on high-level efficiency from raw material production right through to the delivery of the end-product to consumers, this model works well with commoditized businesses where the rate of production is not only scheduled but in sync with predicted sales.\n\nThis model further complements industries where competition is largely based on the price, such as the steel industry, or where market competition is rife. Accurate forecasting and the use of machinery to reduce costs and maintain efficiency is key to the success of this model.\n\n2. The Fast Supply Chain Model\n\nIn industries subject to fast-changing fashions, such as clothing or furniture, the fast supply chain model is highly recommended as it allows companies to utilize a system that treats time as a commodity. By reducing the time from idea to market and incorporating highly accurate forecasts, the fast supply chain model empowers companies to efficiently deliver products with reduced lifecycles based on changing fashions or trends, and thus lowering market mediation costs. It also allows for greater end-to-end efficiency to reduce expenses.\n\n3. The Continuous-Flow Model\n\nCompanies in mature industries that require high demand stability frequently adopt the continuous flow model as it enables them to create an ongoing and reliable flow of products and information. Industries with little movement in the customer demand profile also benefit from this format.\n\nThe following 3 supply chain models fall under the responsiveness category-\n\n4. The Agile Supply Chain Model\n\nFor companies operating in an industry that has unpredictable demand, the agile supply chain model is beneficial as it is based on a make-to-order decoupling point. This essentially means that a product is made after the customer order is placed. This system also works well for companies that deal in small batches as it enables managers to keep a tight rein on those stock levels.\n\n5. The Custom-Configured Model\n\nThis model is incredibly effective in industries where product configurations are regularly required, such as motor vehicle companies. This model incorporates a strong correlation between the asset and total cost while combining elements from both the continuous flow model and the agile model.\n\n6. The Flexible Supply Chain Model\n\nIndustries that are impacted by high peak seasons work best with a flexible supply chain model as this highly flexible and adaptable system allows management to rapidly reconfigure manufacturing processes to meet last minute and specific customer requirements. Flexibility is crucial in this system, alongside fast responses."
