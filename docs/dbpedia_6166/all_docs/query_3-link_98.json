        "text": "Searching for just a few words should be enough to get started. We’ll suggest common engineering terms as you type.\n\nOur search algorithm leverages our proprietary taxonomy to suggest the most relevant search results – these results include not only matches on your exact search phrase, but also matches on synonyms and sub-terms of your search phrase, as well as near-phrase matches. As a result, this search engine does not support Boolean searching.\n\nUPDATE: In April 2024, we implemented improvements to our search engine to ensure we deliver the most relevant results. You may notice fewer results for certain searches; this is intentional as the search is now better at eliminating results that do not fit your search criteria. No content was removed from the site as part of this update.\n\nYou can also use the search filters to narrow down the results to exactly what you want."
