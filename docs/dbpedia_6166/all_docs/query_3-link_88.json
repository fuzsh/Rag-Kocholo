        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nMcDonald's is the largest and most recognized foodservice organization in the world and has a high level of local development, utilizing new supply chain technology to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The company operates on the foundation of a franchise model, within which independent operators run approximately 85 percent of McDonald's 31,700 fast food locations around the world. McDonald's has a deep value chain integrated by suppliers, who are considered strategic business allies, owning thousands of independent fast-food restaurants worldwide and having the majority of sales generated by franchise system sources from raw materials purchased by suppliers. Supply chain management (SCM) has become a very significant issue for all manufacturing and service firms in order to meet the needs and wants of customers that are constantly changing at competitive prices. Respondents, who were selected from the procurement and logistics departments of ten current food and paper product suppliers to McDonald's in the southeastern part of the USA, participated in a competitive environment. Based upon survey findings, the research extends conclusions made by other researchers' viewpoints and provides managerial implications and issues associated with applying technology in global supply chain operations. It identifies the problems in using new technology and factors which fast food industry suppliers should consider to improve supply relationships with McDonald's, as well as other fast food chain operators, while relieving the information technology (IT) personnel burden with troubleshooting needs on technology enhancements.\n\n2. The Importance of Supply Chain Efficiency in the Food Industry\n\nSupply chain efficiency is the key to improved shareholder value and reduction of the total cost of ownership (TCO). A supply chain includes all the activities and partners involved in fulfilling a customer request. The objectives of a well-managed supply chain are to maintain the right amount of inventory, reduce stock-outs and overstock situations, minimize costs, be environmentally responsible, ensure that all activities that add value to the product align, and maintain good relations with customers, partners, and suppliers. The processes and techniques to achieve these objectives in a wide range of industries have been developed over the last 60 years. The high technology used by many manufacturers and distributors of high-velocity consumer goods in very mature supply chain industries. The tools and techniques available to them, which include business process change, supply chain collaboration, efficient consumer response, radio frequency identification, transportation optimization, advanced trading partner scheduling management, as well as advanced order management, location strategies, network optimization, customer segmentation, and network management, are leading-edge technologies with demonstrated paybacks. The tools focus on improving speed to market, reducing the risk of loss or damage in transit, replacing physical assets with the minimization or maximization of inventory and personnel. Peace improvement alternatives have not kept pace with the goods that these organizations.\n\n3. Technology Solutions in McDonald's Supply Chain\n\nFood safety, efficient distribution, and recycling of different items are some factors that make the supply chain more streamlined. Supply chain management involves collecting raw materials, from their extraction or production and flow of goods and services until reaching the ultimate consumer. McDonald's is a multinational company that manages its physical flow of products with the help of technology. The main aim behind this is to meet customer requirements and thus increase profitability. The company profited from the cost-saving technologies that were incorporated into the supply chain systems. This case study discusses the impact of McDonald's IT on its supply chain efficiency. Many supply chain managers would say that technology has been the linchpin of improvement in their work. Few disagree that companies need to find the correct technology solutions to their supply chain dilemmas. Technology has made it easier and less expensive to uncover hidden capacity, manage flow, and optimize resource and information management within supply chains. McDonald's, a powerful American brand, operates in 119 countries. The company is a franchise system experienced in fast food production. In the supply chain, however, preparation is anything but fast. Maturing upward is a global retail force that needs a very carefully managed supply chain. Few supply chains have reached the degree of success like McDonald's. McDonald's supply chain is steep and deep, prompt and solid, and expensive—a perfect 10 within the supply chain world, yes? The company's profitability soared after the implementation of IT solutions.\n\n3.1. 1.1. Inventory Management Systems\n\nWithin its warehouses, McDonald's employs various types of real-time inventory management systems that include devices such as Vocollect voice-directed systems. These systems enable workers to interact instinctively with the operations system at any time, assuring accurate stock records. Voice-managed programs are designed to support order selection, replenishment, and put-away operations. Specifically, these programs confirm a picker's identity before allowing any operations. In order to confirm a task and a picker's place in a pick assignment, the application sends a voice message and expects to get a spoken response. These systems improve order precision, speed up new picker training procedures, and provide long-lasting cost advantages in workforce and operational efficiencies. The Vocollect system is implemented to provide real-time visibility into specific job performance levels. By displaying customizable management and employee dashboards, the business is able to analyze fulfillment and corrective actions. Additionally, the voice recognition program also allows for a substantially error-free inventory. Considering that McDonald's store operations revolve around the product that food should be prepared fresh daily, a high inventory accuracy rate is critical. A warehouse mobile system that is voice-activated is just one stock management method. Other technologies in inventory management include real-time replenishment systems which help to ensure that inventory levels are optimum.\n\n3.2.1.2 Demand Forecasting Tools: Sales Information Systems: Sales Information Systems. Current POS Systems. Technology, such as the point-of-sale (POS) systems, is used to automate the ordering system and improves the speed and accuracy of order fulfillment. These systems also store orders and customer preferences for later use during the demand forecasting process. The customer's order information and the series of off-store data are downloaded and analyzed at the store level, regional zone, and national level. Current POS Systems, we are actively researching technologies that will enable us to capture individual store sales and inventory data more frequently. As we develop and deploy near real-time flexible reporting tools, managers will be able to react to changes in sales and inventory conditions more rapidly. 3.2.1.2.1 Drive-Thru Optimization: Limiting Wait Time. Enough Menu Items to Limit the Wait To 2½ Minutes or Less; Open for Breakfast at 5:30 AM, Lunch and Dinner until 10 PM; Simplify the Menu and Standardize On Uniform Prep Procedures. There are many factors that come into play when trying to limit the wait time through drive-thru facilities. McDonald's states it has taken steps to limit the wait time to 2½ minutes or less, and that they brought the time down on average to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. However, for some locations, this also involves having the menu items to be able to meet the demand in a timely manner and still be driven through the window from 5:30 AM to 10 PM rather than having a breakfast or an all-day lunch/dinner menu. Enterprise-wide, we will open for breakfast at 5:30 AM. Breakfast is a good day opener, after which store operations may be set up for the next part of the day.\n\n3.3. 1.3. Supplier Relationship Management Software\n\nSupplier Relationship Management (SRM) systems provide for the integration of supplier and customer relationship management. Suppliers come to understand the overall strategic purpose of procurement, while customers understand the capabilities of their key suppliers. This knowledge facilitates mutual performance improvement. For organizations like McDonald's that demand a high level of quality and consistency over geographically dispersed locations, these types of systems are ideal. At the high level, the main function of these systems is controlling and driving strategic developments across organizational boundaries. Their organizations include employees, customers, and the relationship with suppliers. The systems act as a focal point for managing supply chain relationships, communication, and more tightly integrating the two supply chain processes. Typical systems include: Supplier Performance Management, Supplier Recommendations, Evaluation and Rating, Supplier Development, Price Agreements, Co-Development, Supply Chain Resource Planning, and Cost Estimations. An advantage claimed for the management of such a system is a reduction in both inventories and lead times. It is achieved through maintaining appropriate numbers of suppliers needed to sustain the real-time nature of re-supply and having visibility of real-time information from both suppliers and their suppliers. In the 2004 Americas Awards, PRTM's operational excellence practice gathered and analyzed supplemental data to better understand the relationship between supply chain technology investments and business performance such as improving supply chain operations, raising speed of products to market, reducing product cost, and increasing revenue.\n\n4. Case Study: Implementation of Technology in McDonald's Supply Chain\n\nTechnology affects every aspect of operations. The benefits of implementing technology are no different for either the inbound or outbound logistics flows. The bottom-line gains are of a total experience nature. Improved service levels, reduced lead times, better asset control, and the provision of an environment where staff only need to react to order-specific information replace the mundane, time-consuming information gathering tasks that previously cluttered staff activities. Internal users are immediately able to utilize critiquing exception reporting applications to devote their attention to managing source variances, and not chasing them. Management information is provided in a preformatted, exception-organized, structured presentation that speeds decision making and enables action to be taken in a timely, cost-effective manner. No decision occurs without the availability and prior analysis of specific data. With the data readily available, decision makers may no longer delay gathering cost information or delay as information is processed into a usable format. Leaders in the fast food industry have long recognized the competitive advantages that will accrue from providing world-class effective and efficient service. With each passing day, the volume of transactions generated becomes increasingly larger. Continuous improvements that control costs, provide information in a structure that will assist users in promoting sales growth, and enhance company profits are imperative. A critical success strategy of any eating establishment is being profitable, and profitable sales growth depends upon the availability of timely, accurate, specific, internal, and external total service-related information. McDonald's achievement of this competitive advantage is supported by the basic business principles established and maintained within its logistics environment.\n\n5. Challenges and Future Directions\n\nFuture McDonald's supply chains can be expected to exhibit even greater levels of information intensity and organizational integration than at present. These further improvements in supply chain efficiency will be driven by a growing number of fundamental challenges which business is facing, challenges which technology will play a major role in addressing, including: a growing list of products and services offered by the organization, increasing customer demand for customization and differentiated products and services, expectations of individualization in mass production, and rapidly declining product life cycles. These challenges, and others, will significantly increase the demand placed on supply chains in terms of the number of products and services they support, the speed, flexibility, and reliability of delivery expected, the level of product and service customization required, the need to reduce the costs of reverse material flows, the need to cope with rapidly changing technology and ever-shorter product life cycles, and the ability to build in sustainable, environmentally sound production practices in the overall supply chain design. This environment is one in which we can expect technology development to focus on knowledge-based technologies, new means of presenting information across organizations and over networks, and supply chain integration and visibility. These are the foundations upon which more efficient business processes and ever more innovative supply chains, and even more innovative products and services, will be built."
