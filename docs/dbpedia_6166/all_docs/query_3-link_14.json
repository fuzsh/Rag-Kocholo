        "text": "Initially developed in 1996 by management consulting firm Pitiglio, Rabin, Todd, and McGrath (PRTM), the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model gained endorsement from the Supply-Chain Council, part of the Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), and underwent evaluations by industry leaders like Intel, IBM, Rockwell Semiconductor, and Procter & Gamble. The latest iteration, SCOR 12.0, was introduced in 2017 by ASCM, covering topics such as omnichannel, metadata, and blockchain.\n\nThe SCOR model provides a standardized approach to understanding and improving supply chain processes across industries, and serves as a comprehensive framework for effective analysis, design, and management of supply chain operations.\n\nHereunder are the key components of the SCOR model:\n\n1. Core Processes:\n\nThe SCOR model outlines six core processes encompassing all aspects of supply chain management. These processes are further divided into specific activities and metrics to facilitate analysis and improvement."
