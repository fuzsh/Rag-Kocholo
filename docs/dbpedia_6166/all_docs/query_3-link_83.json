        "text": "Written by Clarence Chen, Ashok Rao and Mark Stonich\n\nThe crisis in Japan underscores the toll natural disasters can take, not only on society, but on global supply chains. Since the country is home to key electronic manufacturing and assembly operations—90 percent of the world’s BT resin output, 20 percent of chip fabrication capacity, 50% of 300 mm wafers—the supply chain disruptions are far-reaching.\n\nBy our count, the crisis that began with the earthquake of March 11 has created shortages at the operations of more than 25 companies, including Sony (SNE), Panasonic (PC), Toshiba, Renesas, and Sandisk (SNDK). Some companies are lacking as many as 300 different electronic components.\n\nTo make matters worse, the full extent of the disruptions won’t be known until supply disruptions work their way through multiple, complex supply chains and bills-of-materials. Companies that manufacture products with complicated configurations can be looking at even more time for recovery. And companies that depend on a component manufactured by only one source may be forced to completely redesign their product.\n\nThat point is certainly not lost on global electronics firms, which are scrambling to assess the total impact of the crisis.\n\nBut, as companies are finding out, visibility into supply chains remains hazy at best. It’s especially bad for companies that build complex configurations, since the bill of materials will often have components that come from various levels of the supply chain: original design manufacturers, electronics manufacturing services companies, and Tier 1 and 2 suppliers. A company may not find out until much later that the supplier of a supplier is where the snag occurs. And though companies tend to concentrate on the most expensive components, it can be the lack of a one-cent part that prevents them from shipping.\n\nHow bad will the disruption turn out to be? What actions can companies take to respond to the immediate crisis and to better position their supply chains on an ongoing basis?\n\nGauging the Disruption Timeline\n\nOur firm, PRTM, developed a model that can help companies predict how long a disruption of this level can last. For each week that supply is not available, it takes approximately four to six weeks to recover overall supply-demand balance, re-prime, and rebuild inventories across the value chain. In the case of Japan, the disruptions to the electronics supply could last two to three quarters as original equipment manufacturers work through the chaos to re-balance supply chains and customer commitments. And that does not account for instances where an OEM depends on a component supplied by a single source.\n\nAct Now: Set Up a Material Crisis Room\n\nThe lack of visibility into the supply chain can greatly hinder a company’s ability to determine what components are available for building and meeting demand—and which are not. A coordinated effort is critical not only for estimating the revenue that could be held back by a dearth of the right components, but also for confirming the company’s ability to ship orders it had committed to before the disaster.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend establishing a material crisis management room, analogous to a war room, to monitor and manage exposure to supply and revenue-stream disruptions. The material crisis room is both a physical and virtual place where people—EMS partners, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, and internal allocations and supply chain teams—ask questions and get the answers they need to make good decisions. As events in Japan continue to unfold, the material crisis management room can help a company see to what extent the disruption has affected its own supply chain as well as its suppliers’ supply chains—critical information for estimating the impact on production capacity, inventories, customer deliveries, and revenue.\n\nIn our view, four steps are essential to setting up a material crisis room:\n\nSet up a physical location. Require your company’s component planners, supply chain planners, order schedulers, commodity sourcing specialists, and revenue planners to work in the material crisis room. The top operations executive should drive daily status assessments of supply and demand. Key customer account managers and regional leaders should also participate in these assessments.\n\nIdentify the affected pieces of the supply chain. Take stock of suppliers, EMS partners, customers, etc. located in Japan and affected by the crisis. Review suppliers’ supply chains to assess the potential impact from lower levels in the supply chain. In parallel, set up the capability to analyze the impact of component shortages on manufacturing, delivery, and revenue.\n\nDetermine what products can still be made with the components at hand. This is a daunting task when many products require the same components and materials, yet vary greatly in profitability. Analytical tools such as Clear to Build can help companies figure out how to make best use of what’s available and how those decisions will affect the bottom line.\n\nCommunicate internally and externally. For the first six weeks, conduct frequent briefings with the executives who head up sales and other functions in the company that deal directly with customers, such as marketing. Make sure this information is provided at the executive sales and operations planning sessions. At the same time, communicate often with suppliers to develop the most up-to-date supply picture while working through uncertainties. Focus on getting just the most critical information: Be careful not overwhelm your strategic suppliers with the amount of data you request.\n\nPrepare for the Future: Manage Risk Across Multi-Level Supply Chains\n\nIn the past, OEM supply risk management approaches often focused on the financial, geopolitical, and economic risk to the overall supply base. They also relied greatly on supply chain partners such as EMS and original device manufacturer partners to do the managing. Although no one could have predicted the extent of the Japanese crisis, it’s clear from this and other recent supply disruptions that risk management must be both comprehensive and deep across multiple levels of the supply chains. Moreover, even if a company outsources its supply chain, it should not outsource its risk management efforts. In many cases, the OEM is the only entity with the global visibility and relationships needed to identify risks across multiple levels of the supply chain.\n\nWhile the events in Japan are unprecedented, they serve to highlight an all-too-common truth: Companies developing global supply chains should not underestimate the importance of country and supplier diversification and other risk mitigation strategies. Hopefully, high-tech firms, along with the rest of the country, will recover quickly from with this crisis—and the lessons they learn will be of benefit worldwide."
