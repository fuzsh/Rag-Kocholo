        "text": "6 Insourcing, Outsourcing, Making, or Buying\n\nNote. From Gieling, 2020. Licensed for reuse under the Unsplash License.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nExplain why companies outsource.\n\nDescribe the reasons why the use of outsourcing and offshoring has grown.\n\nExplain some drawbacks companies face when they outsource their activities.\n\nUnderstand that choosing whether to make or to buy a product or choosing to have services performed by an outside company, are outsourcing decisions.\n\nCompare costs to keep the product or service in-house to the cost of buying the product or service from an outside party.\n\nWhat do you know about insourcing and outsourcing?\n\nOutsourcing\n\nWatch this video on why you should consider outsourcing.\n\nBigOutsource. (2013, February 17). Why Outsource? [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqhjNJkvC9w\n\nFord Motor Company no longer produces its own tires for its cars. It buys them from tire producers like Michelin and Goodyear. It’s still possible to “own” your supply chain, though. The diamond company DeBeers owns its own mines, distributorships, and retail diamond stores. The problem is that it’s very costly to own multiple types of companies and difficult to run them all well, too.\n\nFirms look up and down their supply chains and outside them to see which companies can add the most value to their products at the least cost. If a firm can find a company that can add more value than it can to a function, it will often outsource the task to that company. After all, why do something yourself if someone else can do it better or more cost-effectively?\n\nRather than own fleets of trucks, ships, and airplanes, most companies outsource at least some of their transportation tasks to shippers such as Roadway and FedEx. Other companies hire freight forwarders to help them. You can think of freight forwarders as travel agents for freight. Their duties include negotiating rates for shipments and booking space for them on transportation vehicles and in warehouses. A freight forwarder also combines small loads from various shippers into larger loads that can be shipped more economically. However, it doesn’t own its own transportation equipment or warehouses.\n\nOther companies go a step further and outsource their entire order processing and shipping departments to third-party logistics (3PLs) firms. FedEx Supply Chain Services and UPS Supply Chain Solutions (which are divisions of FedEx and UPS, respectively) are examples of 3PLs. A 3PL is a one-stop shipping solution for a company that wants to focus on other aspects of its business. Firms that receive and ship products internationally often hire 3PLs so they don’t have to deal with the headaches of transporting products abroad and completing import and export paperwork for them.\n\nThis type of analysis is also relevant to the service industry; for example, ADP provides payroll and data processing services to over 650,000 companies worldwide. Or a law firm may decide to hire certain research activities to be completed by outside experts rather than hire the necessary staff to keep that function in-house. These are all examples of outsourcing. Outsourcing is the act of using another company to provide goods or services that your company requires.\n\nMany companies outsource some of their work, but why? Consider this scenario: Today, while driving home from class, one of your car’s engine warning lights goes on. You will most likely take your car to an auto repair specialist to have it analyzed and repaired, whereas your grandfather might have popped the hood, grabbed his toolbox, and attempted to diagnose and fix the problem himself. Why? It is often a matter of expertise and sometimes simply a matter of cost-benefit. In your grandfather’s time, car engines were more mechanical and less electronic, which made learning to repair cars a simpler process that required less expertise and only basic tools. Today, your car has many electronic components and often requires sophisticated monitors to assess the problem and may involve the replacement of computer chips or electronic sensors. Thus, you opt to outsource the repair of your car to someone who has the knowledge and facilities to provide the repair more cost-effectively than you could if you did it yourself. Your grandfather likely could have made the repair to his car several decades ago as cheaply as the mechanic with only a sacrifice of his time. To your grandfather, the cost of his time was worth the benefit of completing the repair himself.\n\nCompanies outsource for the same reasons. Many companies have found that it is more cost-effective to outsource certain activities, such as payroll, data storage, and web design and hosting. It is more efficient to pay an outside expert than to hire the appropriate staff to keep a particular task inside the company.\n\nFundamentals of the Decision to Make or to Buy\n\nAs with other decisions, the make-versus-buy decision involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative component requires cost analysis to determine which alternative is more cost-effective. This cost analysis can be performed by looking at the cost to buy the component versus the cost to produce the component, which allows us to decide based on an analysis of unavoidable costs. For example, the production costs will include direct materials, direct labour, variable overhead, and fixed overhead. If the business chooses to buy the component instead, the avoidable costs will go away, but unavoidable costs will remain and need to be considered part of the cost to buy the component."
