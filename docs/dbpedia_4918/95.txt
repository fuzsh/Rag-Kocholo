Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic, Evangelos Venizelos, will visit Belgrade on 18 February, in the capacity as the Greek Presidency of the Council of the EU.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia Ivan Mrkic will play host to the Greek official. During his visit to Belgrade, Venizelos will also meet President Tomislav Nikolic, Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, and First Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic.
