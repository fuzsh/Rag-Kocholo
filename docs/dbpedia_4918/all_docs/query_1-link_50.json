        "text": "The Minister will address the Council’s Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) and join Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the Belarusian democratic movement, and Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto for a panel on how to reinforce democratic security across Europe in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAhead of these public engagements, Minister Coveney will meet senior leaders across the Council, including the Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatović, President of PACE Tiny Kox and the Council’s Secretary General Marija Burić. There, he will announce €865,000 in new financial contributions to support Ireland’s Presidency priorities, above all the Council’s revised Action Plan for Ukraine, the work of the European Court of Human Rights, and the implementation of the Istanbul Convention on violence against women.\n\nHe will also meet bilaterally with Katrín Jakobsdóttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland, to whom Ireland will hand the Presidency in November, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Kosovo, Donika Gervalla-Schwarz.\n\nIn his address to PACE, Minister Coveney will welcome Secretary General’s Burić appointment of former President Mary Robinson as a member of a High Level Group that, over the coming months, will reflect on the Council of Europe’s new realities and challenges and future work.\n\nThe Irish Presidency of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers began on 20 May and runs to mid-November. Further details are available on www.ireland.ie/coe\n\nIreland was amongst the organisation’s 10 founding members. Today, following the expulsion of the Russian Federation on 16 March, it comprises 46 member states, including the 27 EU member states, the United Kingdom, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\nThe organisation plays a leading role in the protection and promotion of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law across Europe and beyond – notably through the European Court of Human Rights, which ensures the observance by member states of their obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe European Convention on Human Rights is also a key element of the Good Friday Agreement. The Agreement saw the Convention’s incorporation into Northern Ireland law, ensuring citizens have direct access to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe Committee of Ministers is the principal intergovernmental decision-making body of the Council of Europe. Chaired on a rotating basis by member states over 6 month terms, Ireland has held the Presidency of the Committee on 6 previous occasions, most recently in 2000.\n\nThe Parliamentary Assembly is the second of the Council’s key statutory organs. It comprises 324 parliamentarians from the national parliaments of the 46 member states. The Standing Committee comprises the President and Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, the chairpersons of political groups, the chairpersons of national delegations and the committee chairpersons, totalling some 60 parliamentarians.\n\nOver the course of the 6 months, Ireland will chair more than a dozen meetings of the Committee of Ministers in Strasbourg, strengthening standards across a range of key areas, from media freedoms to the protection of human rights in conflict zones. Ireland will also host more than thirty Council of Europe conferences and seminars across Strasbourg, Dublin, Galway, Kerry and Cork.\n\nNotable events in Ireland include: a meeting of the Council’s 46 Justice Ministers in Dublin on 29-30 September, at which Minister for Justice Helen McEntee T.D. will chair discussions on how to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms; the annual meeting of the Board of the Council of Europe’s Development Bank in Dublin from 8-9 July; and European Conference on Global Education, at which Member States will adopt a Dublin Declaration on how through education we can build societal commitment to greater justice, sustainability, equity and human rights.\n\nThe voluntary financial contribution Minister Coveney announces in Strasbourg is in addition to Ireland’s annual budgetary contribution to the Council of Europe, of just over €5.5m. The organisation’s total annual budget is approximately €500m.\n\nAt the request of the Committee of Ministers under the previous Presidency of Italy, the Council of Europe’s Secretary General has set up a High-level Reflection Group to consider the institution’s responses to the new realities and challenges it faces.\n\nThe Group comprises 7 eminent individuals, all former heads of State or Government, Foreign Ministers or Parliamentary Speakers, selected by the Secretary General with consideration to balanced geographical distribution, gender and age, as well as diversity of competences. Alongside former President Robinson, its members are: Mr Bernard Cazeneuve, former Prime Minister of France; Ms Iveta Radičová, former Prime Minister of Slovakia; Mr Evangelos Venizelos, former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Greece; Ms Federica Mogherini, former High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Foreign Minister of Italy; Ms Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, former Foreign Minister of Norway; and Mr Josep Dallerès Codin, former General Syndic of Andorra."
