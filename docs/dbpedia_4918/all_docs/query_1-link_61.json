        "text": "Greece is preparing itself for political turmoil. There was no clear winner in the first round of local elections, held on 18 May, though the centre-right New Democracy party, which is led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, and the far-left Syriza party, led by Alexis Tsipras, were clearly ahead of the others. The second round of the local elections, to be held this Sunday, will coincide with the European Parliament elections, and it is guaranteed to be a bruising contest.\n\nThe European elections are therefore being subsumed into a national debate about austerity measures and unemployment. Greece has been dealing with a severe economic crisis for six years, but the economy is expected to return to growth this year. A primary budget surplus for 2013 was recorded, so Samaras is arguing that fiscal discipline is paying off.\n\nSyriza has positioned itself as the most effective opposition party, helped by the implosion of the socialist party, PASOK. Syriza is hoping to harness discontent with record high unemployment figures and widespread social disorder. Tsipras, who is also lead candidate of the European far-left for the presidency of the European Commission, has declared the European elections a “referendum” on austerity. “Our goal is to record a major victory so that the government will leave,” he has said.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that Syriza will win eight seats compared to six for Samaras’s New Democracy. In the 2009-14 Parliament, Syriza had just one MEP, Nikólaos Chountís, but he is not standing for re-election. The party’s candidate list is led by the composer Nikos Xydakis. Trade unionist Konstantina Kuneva is in third place.\n\nAnother party hoping to profit from discontent is the extreme-right Golden Dawn. The party is currently under criminal investigation, but on 12 May Greece’s Supreme Court gave the party permission to put up candidates in the European elections. Golden Dawn entered the national parliament in 2012 and is expected to win around 8% of the votes: enough to get into the European Parliament.\n\nContrary to the anti-austerity campaigns of both the far-left and far-right, Samaras presents New Democracy as the only party that can get Greece out of the crisis. “Do we want to be represented by those who are trying to put the country in a precarious position again, who want to tear up the old bail-out memorandums and lead us to new ones? No, we want to exit the memorandums step by step,” Samaras argues.\n\nRodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou is the only current MEP standing for re-election on the New Democracy candidate list. The lead candidate is Giorgos Amyras – a former television presenter and local municipal councillor, followed by television journalist Maria Spyraki and Theodoros Zagorakis, a former captain of the national football team.\n\nSupport for the social-democratic PASOK, a partner in the national coalition, has almost completely disappeared. At the 2009 European elections, it was the biggest party, winning eight seats out of 22 (this time round, Greece will have only 21 seats). The current prediction is for it to win only two seats in the next Parliament. PASOK’s leader, Evangelos Venizelos, the minister for foreign affairs, argues that the survival of the party is vital for the country. The ND/PASOK government holds a majority of just 152 out of 300 seats in the national parliament. Further defeat in the European elections might yet destabilise the national government."
