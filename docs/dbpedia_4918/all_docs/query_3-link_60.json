        "text": "Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has changed his finance minister in an attempt to push through unpopular austerity measures demanded by the EU.\n\nEvangelos Venizelos has been promoted to the finance ministry and tasked with tackling a crippling debt crisis.\n\nThe proposed reforms have sparked riots in Athens and nationwide strikes, while rattling global markets.\n\nThe French and German leaders have called for swift agreement on a new rescue package for Greece.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy are meeting in Berlin to discuss further assistance aimed at preventing Greece defaulting on its sovereign debt - which amounts to some 340bn euros.\n\nAthens is seeking to make budget cuts worth 28bn euros (Â£24.6bn; $40.5bn) over the next four years.\n\nThe policies are required for the release of the next tranche of aid - 12bn euros - from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\n\nFrench and German banks have the most exposure to Greek debt, holding, between them, 55% of Europe's total exposure.\n\nBerlin and Paris have differed over the handling of the Greek crisis - Mrs Merkel has been insistent that banks and private creditors holding Greek debt should accept losses as part of the rescue plan, in the face of domestic opposition to German taxpayers underwriting more of Greece's debt burden.\n\nFrance, meanwhile, is reluctant to accept those terms as three major French banks are heavily exposed to Greek debt and risk considerable losses if it is restructured.\n\nSimilarly, the European Central bank is worried any changes in terms of the bailout deal will set a bad precedent for nations in similar financial straits such as Portugal, Ireland and Spain.\n\nThe EU's top financial official Olli Rehn has indicated Greece is likely to get its next financial lifeline in July, even though EU finance ministers have yet to agree on a new bail-out package.\n\nDowngraded debt"
