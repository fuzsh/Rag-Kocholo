        "text": "Newly appointed Papademos, right, is tasked with putting the debt-laden country back on track [AFP]\n\nLucas Papademos, Greece’s new prime minister, has held urgent talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the bail-out for his debt-ridden country.\n\nBoth Sarkozy and Merkel underlined the need for Greece to implement the measures it had agreed to in return for the next instalment of an international loan, a statement from Sarkozy’s office said after Saturday’s talks.\n\n“The payment of the next tranche [of the bailout] can only take place when a decisive step has been taken in this matter.”\n\nIn separate talks, the French and German leaders “reaffirmed their determination to totally defend the euro”, the statement said.\n\nHowever, Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine, in a report due out on Monday, says the government had worked out contingency plans in the event that Greece had to quit the eurozone.\n\nMerkel was prepared for the possibility that Greece’s new government refuses to carry out the tough austerity programme required of it in return for the next tranche of the EU-IMF bailout, it reported.\n\nRace against time\n\nGreece’s new unity government faces a race against time to save the debt-stricken nation from bankruptcy after a landmark power-sharing deal struck between opposing political parties.\n\nGermany’s Der Spiegel says Berlin has contingency plan lined up if Greece were to quit the eurozone [Reuters]\n\nDaily newspaper Kathimerini has hailed the new cabinet – a power-sharing mix of Pasok socialists, New Democracy conservatives and far-right nationalist party Laos – as “a government of balance and agreement”.\n\nBut Greece’s financial daily Naftemporiki reminded the new government that its priority was “stabilising of the economy in difficult conditions, both at home and in the eurozone”.\n\nEvangelos Venizelos, the Greek finance minister, who kept his job, said on Friday he hoped the latest slice of the bailout agreed for Greece would be paid soon after another EU finance ministers meeting on November 17.\n\nFirst though, the Greeks have to implement the measures agreed at the EU summit in Brussels on October 26-27.\n\nVenizelos said this was “urgent” and would be done “no later than Monday or Tuesday”.\n\nAs part of the deal, private banks are to accept writedowns of 50 per cent, which will allow Greece to wipe out nearly a third of its $480bn debt.\n\nStrikes ‘set to continue’\n\nThe procedure to confirm the new government – which was voted in with a comfortable 254 out of 300 cross-party votes – in parliament will begin on Monday with a vote of confidence, expected on Wednesday.\n\nIt must then implement the unpopular austerity measures exacted as the price for a second EU rescue package of $135bn in loans, the same amount in debt reduction and a further $40bn in guarantees.\n\nGreece will also have to manage a delicate power-sharing deal and enact reforms quickly to appease public resentment.\n\n“The government will have to be very quick on economic issues,” Ilias Nicolakopoulos, a political analyst, told the AFP news agency.\n\n“We will have a 2012 budget vote before the end of December as well as the Brussels plan of 26-27 October.”\n\nThe strikes that started under Papandreou were set to continue as the main public service union Adedy called for three-hour stoppages, starting on Tuesday, in protest at rising taxes and 30,000 job cuts across the civil service.\n\nDemonstrations were expected on Thursday, November 17, a date laden with significance in Greece; it marks the anniversary of huge protests in 1973 by students at the Athens Polytechnic University against the then junta.\n\nThe government also faces continuing opposition from the KKE communist party and radical left party Syriza.\n\nBoth refused to join the new coalition, opposing what they termed Greek complicity with the International Monetary Fund and the EU-led policy that obliges Greece to impose austerity measures."
