        "text": "'Reading is an exercise in empathy; an exercise in walking in someone else’s shoes for a while.' Malorie Blackman To help understand some of the challenges facing the world the Institute for Global Negotiation is pleased to offer a very limited number of free ebooks from Apple Books of 'And Then What? Despatches From the Heart of 21st-Century Diplomacy, From Kosovo to Kiev' by Chair of our Advisory Council Baroness Catherine Ashton. Comment or message me privately by Friday 5th January for a code - very limited number of copies available. Other books that I read last year include: - My own 'Pond Life' where I try to distil the findings of my doctoral thesis into a novel … (signed copies available on request) - 'How to Have Impossible Conversations' by Peter Boghossian and James Linsday. A practical guide to talking to people you vehemently disagree with. - 'A Fairly Honourable Defeat' by Iris Murdoch. A dark comedy showing what happens when we struggle to communicate clearly. - 'Weinwanderung Schweiz' (Wine Hiking Switzerland) by Ellen Wallace. Nothing more to add.\n\nRead below to further understand: right now, the US is taking its time, so that the Iranian strikes, which have been paved for and fully justifiable now, will end in the desired results. Iranians are just waiting for the green right. The striking plan and the volume and amount and the targets have all been determined by the Americans and handed to Iran to execute. This is fun for me to watch. Knowing what the Israeli response, the US has prepared the post plan and distributed the roles among its puppets in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, in addition to the main puppet of Iran. I am certain beyond doubt that Jordan and all GCC countries are feeling the heat climbing fast. Israel? What Israel? The US is working on how post-Israel Middle East will look like. Again: read below to fully understand.\n\nOn May 16, the Open Estonia Foundation and Lennart Meri conference are organizing the conference pre-event titled “Россия и имперскость – сценарии развития (Russia and Imperial Tradition – Future Scenarios)“. During the discussion, we will delve into various questions related to Russia´s imperial tendencies and possible future scenarios, such as what is the specificity of the Russian empire and how does the Russian Empire relate to Russian nationalism? In what ways do the \"peripheral regions\" of Russia differ? What poses the greatest threat to the integrity of the Russian empire? How serious are the conflicts between Moscow and the \"provinces\" and could the \"Russian regions\" of Russia wish for independence? We will be addressing Russia´s future scenarios with artist, writer, professor and public intellectual Katia Margolis; Aleksandra Garmazhapova, President of the Free Buryatia Foundation; Dmitry Dubrovskiy, Research Fellow at Charles University and Anton Shekhovtsov, Director of the Centre for Democratic Integrity. The discussion will be moderated by historian David Vseviov. NB! The event will be held in Russian without simultaneous translation, watch the live below. https://lnkd.in/dNXr9qpm\n\nBalfour Project: Transcript from the podcast Nic Pelham interviewed Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of the British Academy. Excerpts: \"Karim Khan (ICC Prosecutor) is is extremely reluctant to progress this investigation because he doesn't want to hold Israel to account.\" \"....the indiscriminate bombardment of civilians, the killing of civilians, on an industrial scale...is a serious war crime.\" Nic Pelham: “There's a question from a listener who asked about the current fighting in in Gaza and says how realistic you think it is to expect that the shocking scenes we have witnessed in the last couple of months might be followed up by the International Criminal Court and whether justice will be done and I suppose that could be a question both for those who perpetrated the violence on October 7, and in the two months that were followed.” Avi Shlaim: “The National Criminal Court agreed three years ago, to launch a full investigation of war crimes in the occupied territories. But the new or not so new British chief prosecutor Karim Khan is extremely reluctant to progress this investigation because he doesn't want to hold Israel to account. We see Western hypocrisy when Russia invaded Ukraine. Within two days Karim Khan announced…he's a British barrister…he announced that he will reinstitute an investigation of war crimes. Within a week he sent an advanced party to Kiev to start gathering evidence for a war crimes trial. But with Israel he is very reluctant to move because against Russia he is supported by the West and particularly the United States and Britain. But to hold Israel to account, he doesn't enjoy the support of the West and therefore he is reluctant to act. But in answer to the question, the scale of the Israeli atrocities of the war crimes in Gaza is such that it verges to includes definitely ethnic cleansing, the forcible movement of 1.9 out of 2.3 million Palestinians the forcible displacement within Gaza. That's all crime. What Israel is doing the indiscriminate bombardment of civilians, the killing of civilians, on an industrial scale, the destruction of Gaza, and Israel has destroyed or damage 60% of the houses in Gaza. These are very serious war crimes. And I think it will be difficult for the ICC to ignore all the evidence that is mounting. So I hope that eventually they will pursue this investigation of Israeli war crimes.” https://lnkd.in/d72qvj6W"
