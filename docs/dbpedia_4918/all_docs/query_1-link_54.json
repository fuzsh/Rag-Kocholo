Now issues that were initially quite separate converged, complicating every response. What did one country’s choices imply for the rest of Europe? Heavily financialized, Ireland had been an immediate victim of the 2008 global financial crisis but seemed to have staved of a panic through a blanket bank guarantee that expired after two years—the country was thus on a countdown to disaster in the last months of 2010. A central issue that divided the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) was whether there should be a haircut imposed on bank creditors: the IMF thought that would help with debt dynamics, and the ECB thought it would destabilize banks everywhere in Europe. The ECB had leverage: it could stop crisis countries from accessing central bank liquidity—a threat that was brutally applied to Ireland as it contemplated “bailing in” banks. That debate spilled over into the question of Greece’s debt sustain-ability. Ireland’s difficulty also put a dramatic spotlight on the ECB’s stance and brought on substantial conflict between the IMF and the central bank. By the spring of 2011, Portugal, with much slower growth than precrisis Greece, but a heavy debt burden, seemed that it too might require an IMF program, and the issue of contagion from Greece thus became acute. It was easy to imagine a domino collapse, with Portugal falling, then Spain, then low-growth and high-debt Italy, and then perhaps even France. From this point on, the interactions among the European institutions; the IMF; the crisis countries; and the major creditor countries, France and Germany, were tied together in a complex skein.\n\nIreland marked a dramatic turning point in the way in which the IMF perceived the European problem. The intensification of the Irish crisis—together with the obvious vulnerability of Spain and Portugal—prompted new thinking at the IMF about the need to address Europe’s problem with a general overarching solution, not simply with a patchwork of responses to individual crisis situations. At this point, IMF officials began to develop a “holistic” view of the European debt crisis and to push European authorities to develop substantial mechanisms to deal with linkages—above all in the financial system—that tied together its multitudinous dimensions.\n\nIn the wake of the Irish controversy, the ECB stopped buying crisis country bonds, in an unannounced decision to which markets only slowly responded—but when the impact of the policy move was absorbed, in late April 2011, bond spreads soared. Greek bond yields rose by more than 1 percentage point. Irish two-year bond yields increased 75 basis points to 12.09 percent, and Portuguese yields jumped 21 basis points to 11.46 percent. The press rightly interpreted this step as the ECB challenging European governments to undertake more effective reform. The Financial Times commented that “The ECB’s deliberate abstinence is part of a strategy to encourage politicians to take corrective action needed to restore investor confidence. But it also reflects risks the Frankfurt-based institution is carrying by acquiring a total of €76 billion in Greek, Irish and Portuguese bonds.”1\n\nECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had already outlined the case in dramatic language during a speech to European parliamentarians of center-left parties on March 18:\n\nThe crisis has given us an opportunity. It has made plain the flaws in the Stability and Growth Pact that allowed countries’ fiscal policies to become a problem—not just for themselves, but for everyone else within the monetary union. We now have an obligation to fix the flaws. All of them. . . . Surveillance procedures have to be faster and more automatic, including the new macroeconomic surveillance framework. We have seen more than ever the importance of a timely correction of fiscal imbalances. Therefore, we cannot wait months or even a year until policies are corrected. In the meantime, spillovers would hurt other Member States. In the past, the Council has often suspended the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby weakening its credibility. This must not happen again. . . . Let me borrow the words of Willy Brandt, speaking as the first Head of Government of a member state of the European Communities to address the plenary of the European Parliamentary Assembly, back in 1973. “This is where the political will should, at long last, carry the day over the many national administrative egoisms, which may be justified individually, but all in all can no longer be tolerated. Having gone so much astray in the past years, we must now achieve a better harmonization of our economic policies. New decisions are needed which place more precise obligation on us, and bind Member States more closely.”2\n\nThe IMF also presented for the first time in a really systematic way its vision of the crisis as a crisis of the entire euro area driven by the diabolic loop between governments and banks: governments bailed out banks, which sent their own deficits and debt levels soaring, but then financed those deficits through sales of bonds to banks, where the bonds’ decreased valuation threatened bank solvency. General appreciation of the euro doom loop was underpinned by the release of the consequences of the European bank stress tests on July 15. Ninety banks had been surveyed, with a rather mild finding that, at the end of 2010, eight banks would fall below the capital threshold of 5 percent core tier 1 capital ratio over the following two years, with a modest overall shortfall of €2.5 billion.3 The worst case was that of ATE, the Agricultural Bank in Greece, whose core tier 1 capital ratio was assessed at minus 0.8 percent (against the pass mark of 5 percent). Five Spanish banks also failed: CAM, Pastor, Caja3, Unnim, and Catalunyacaixa. The fact that no Italian banks failed was widely interpreted not as vindicating the strength of the Italian banking system, but rather as indicating the inadequacy of the testing procedure. None of the banks deemed problematic were in France or Germany. Soon after the stress tests, the large Belgian-French bank Dexia—which had passed the stress test with a core tier 1 capital ratio of an apparently solid 10.3 percent but had a €3.4 billion exposure to Greek government bonds—needed a bailout. Journalists quickly pointed out that the result “potentially undermines claims the exercise was tough enough to restore investors’ faith in the eurozone financial system.”4 The exercise contrasted dramatically with the US stress tests, which had shored up confidence in the American financial system.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of that depressing European stress test, the IMF published its 2011 Euro Area Policies Article IV Report. The financial bank– sovereign doom loop was at the center of its analysis:\n\nA benign baseline scenario is not assured until euro area policymakers come to grips with the sovereign tensions. There was shared concern that the sovereign tensions could spill over into the core economies via the financial system with large adverse regional and global implications. Thus, strong program implementation would need to be complemented with private sector driven cross-border solutions, immediate capital raising throughout the euro area, and a further strengthening of crisis management mechanisms to help restore confidence in debt sustainability. . . . It was agreed that banks urgently need more and better quality capital, in part to be able to withstand the sovereign stresses.\n\nThe report also emphasized—as the ECB had—the need for urgent action to centralize more fiscal policy:\n\nStaff considers some delegation of policy power to the center necessary to ensure the integrity of EMU. The crisis has made the case for common policy execution, with better ex ante fiscal risk sharing, and a p an-euro area approach to the financial system, including a collective backstop to complete the new financial stability framework. Similarly, more efforts are needed to enable a truly free flow of goods, services, labor and equity capital across b orders.\n\nBut that did not mean abandoning the emphasis on fiscal retrenchment:\n\nThere was agreement that fiscal consolidation should continue broadly as planned. The 2010 fiscal deficit for the euro area remained at the previous year’s level of about 6 percent of GDP. The targeted adjustment that countries have agreed to under the Excessive Deficit Procedures (EDP) of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is substantial, mostly expenditure-based and frontloaded where funding pressures are most severe. . . . Consolidation is proceeding, but it will be important that announced plans are implemented and policy gaps filled. Faster growing economies should let automatic stabilizers work and reach their EDP targets earlier than planned. Crisis countries might have to extend their plans in line with program requirements, but consolidation will have to continue.\n\nThus, at this stage the troika partners, the European Commission (EC), the ECB, and the IMF, generally agreed that the key to stopping the doom loop was rapidly strengthening the financial backstop, a move that would have fiscal implications:\n\nThe crisis has changed a basic paradigm of the euro area, namely that all sovereign debt of euro area member countries is equal. This premise lost credibility in the eyes of market participants some time ago, with markets taking their cue from the discussion about the role of private sector involvement in the design of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the permanent successor of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). The Commission and the ECB shared the view that, while market discipline should be pursued, doing so in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis is poorly timed. The interconnectedness of the financial system argues for a rapid completion of the financial stability framework of the euro area, building on recent progress. The missing piece, crisis management and resolution with a common backstop (largely funded by the industry to protect the taxpayer), needs to be put in place without delay.\n\nBut that crucial step only occurred in the summer of 2012. In the meantime, the crisis was clearly volatile and contagious. Europe’s financial dominoes appeared to be falling rapidly.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, the ECB’s most obvious policy mistake in dealing with the global crisis was its decision on two occasions in 2011, April 7 and July 7, to raise interest rates in small moves (by 25 basis points) to combat developing inflationary pressures. At the time, the measures were controversial. Before the April move, stress tests revealed that Irish banks needed an additional €24 billion in capital, and the ECB promised more liquidity support. The Financial Times reported that “The European Central Bank faces an international backlash this week, when, in spite of the Eurozone debt crisis, it is expected to raise interest rates and to consider ways of weaning the weakest banks of its offers of unlimited liquidity.”5 After the July increase, Italy’s stock market fell nearly 9 percent over the week as the yield on government bonds surged.6 However, the IMF Article IV Surveillance Report, issued on July 1 with the second rate rise already expected, was remarkably sympathetic to the ECB’s position. Its assessment of monetary policy began with the observation that both headline inflation and underlying inflation had accelerated sharply in early 2011 on the back of higher energy and food prices and “dissipating disinflationary pressure from a closing output gap.” The report concluded that “The outlook calls for a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The ECB highlighted that the exit from record-low interest rates would help prevent the currently high rates of headline inflation from becoming entrenched and forestall excessive risk taking in search for yield.” The only area in which the IMF staff sounded a more cautious note was in its recommendation that “refinancing at a fixed rate with full allotment continues to be critical for banks with limited access to wholesale or interbank funding, and there is a need to keep it in place for now.”7\n\nIn the late spring of 2011, attention focused increasingly on who would take two of the central positions in the management of the euro crisis: ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet’s term was due to expire in November, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn seemed to be preparing to enter the French presidential race, which would culminate in elections in April 2012. In both cases, the nationality of the chosen successor was a critical issue. Angela Merkel’s allegedly preferred candidate to take over the ECB, Axel Weber, had stepped down from his position as Bundesbank president in February 2011 after he had criticized the ECB’s buying of government bonds. But Merkel had also told Weber that she needed someone who could do what she could not—with the implication that that person could not be a German official. Germany was thus without a candidate, and by March a wide swathe of public opinion, including the influential tabloid paper Bild Zeitung, came to endorse the Governor of the Banca d’Italia, Mario Draghi. Bild had originally seemed hostile, linking Draghi both with Italian inflationary proclivities and with his past work as a Goldman Sachs banker. In April, he burnished his anti-inflation credentials at the ECB Board by speaking forcefully for the rate increase that proved to be misjudged.8 In May, Merkel endorsed him in an interview, saying, “I know Mario Draghi. He is a very interesting and experienced person. He is very close to our image of the culture of stability and solid economic management.”9 His appointment was announced by the European Council on June 24, after some delay because Nicolas Sarkozy insisted on not having two Italians on the Board and Lorenzo Bini Smaghi refused for a time to bow to political pressure and step down.\n\nMeanwhile, on May 19, Strauss-Kahn had resigned in dramatic circumstances, following his detention on a charge of sexual assault in New York. Some commentators saw the affair as the outcome of an intrigue or a setup by Sarkozy to remove the most promising rival candidate for the French presidency. There were stories about phone calls between the French-owned New York hotel’s management and the Élysée Palace. Merkel also played a prominent role in the choice of the IMF’s Managing Director. Kazakhstan and other former Soviet republics lobbied Brazil, China, and India to push for Grigory Marchenko, the Kazakh central bank governor. There were also suggestions of a Turkish candidate, the respected economist and author of the 2001 Turkish stabilization program, Kemal Derviş; and of Singapore’s Finance Minister Tarman Shanmugaratnam. But China did not take a very strong position on the choice, and Merkel was quoted as saying: “Naturally the developing countries have a claim on the highest position of the IMF or World Bank but the current situation speaks for a European candidate, given the considerable problems of the euro.” That view was also endorsed in Brussels, where Olli Rehn, EC Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, also said the appointment should be “ merit-based,” but added: “in this current juncture it is a merit if the person has quite solid knowledge of the European economy and decision making.”10 At a very early stage it was clear that the European choice was the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, and her appointment was announced on June 28.\n\nThe two new principals in the multilateral response to the European debt crisis brought some new qualities. Draghi was much more familiar with financial markets—their incentives and their psychology—than Trichet had been. Lagarde had a close understanding of the psychology and interpersonal dynamics of European policymakers, and the French president did not see her as a rival or a threat."
