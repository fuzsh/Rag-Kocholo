        "text": "A Conversation With John Graham on CPP Investments Fiscal 2023 Results\n\nBarbara Shecter of the National Post reports Canada Pension Plan investing board posts 1.3% return for year: The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board posted a net return of 1.3 per cent for the fiscal year ended March 31, ending the year with net fund assets of $570 billion compared to $539 billion a year earlier. The CPP fund has a 10-year net return of 10 per cent. The $31 billion increase in net assets this year consisted of $8 billion in net income and $23 billion in net transfers from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). Net CPP cash flows in fiscal 2023 were higher than usual due to higher employment rates , an increased limit to the year’s maximum pensionable earnings, an increase to additional CPP contribution inflows and a lump-sum inflow in the fourth quarter due to forecasting adjustments made by the CPP. Since its inception in 1999, CPPIB has contributed $386 billion in cumulative net income to the fund. “Our strong long-term return of 10 per cent over 10 years\n\nCPP Investments' CEO Discusses Fiscal Year 2024 Results\n\nIan Bickis of The Canadian Press reports CPP Investments earned 8 per cent in latest fiscal year, net assets rose to $632 billion: Canada's biggest pension fund earned an eight per cent return last year, but significantly underperformed the 19.9 per cent return of its reference portfolio. The lower return for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in its fiscal year ending March 31 can be explained in part by higher volatility in the stock-focused benchmark portfolio compared with the diversified, long-term return focus for the pension fund, chief executive John Graham said on Wednesday. The reference portfolio, made of 85 per cent global equity and 15 per cent Canadian bonds, benefited last year from stock price surges in the seven largest U.S. tech stocks (known as the Magnificent Seven), while the pension fund has a much broader portfolio that is also invested in infrastructure, real estate, private equities and credit. \"Against a very simple, naive co\n\nHow CDPQ Used the Secondaries Market to Address Overallocation\n\nHannah Zhang of Secondaries Investors reports on how CDPQ used the secondaries market to address overallocation: For Canadian pension giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec , the secondaries market has played an indispensable role in rebalancing its private equity portfolio. CDPQ generated C$9 billion ($6.5 billion; €6 billion) in liquidity last year, including roughly C$6 billion from selling direct investments and receiving dividend recapitalisations, and around C$3 billion from selling private equity fund stakes in the secondaries market, head of PE Martin Longchamps tells affiliate title Private Equity International. Secondaries sales were part of Longchamps’ efforts to bring the pension’s PE allocation back on target. When he took over as CDPQ’s head of PE in late 2022, the institution’s allocation to private equity had reached 20 percent for the first time in its investment history, raising concerns over potential overallocation issues. From the start of his ten\n\nPriti Singh Named CPP Investments' New CRO and Heather Tobin Replaces Her\n\nBNN Bloomberg reports Canada Pension names its second chief risk officer in 18 months: Canada Pension Plan Investment Board moved Priti Singh to chief risk officer, replacing a former BlackRock Inc. executive who had been in the role for only a year and a half. Singh is taking over immediately from Kristen Walters, who was appointed in January of last year. CPPIB, Canada’s largest pension manager, made the decision two years ago to split the risk role from the chief financial officer’s job. “After more than 30 years in risk management, Kristen Walters will be leaving CPP Investments to be closer to home,” the Toronto-based fund said in a statement Wednesday. “Walters has made a significant contribution in establishing the CRO role as a standalone function and setting the enterprise risk strategy and we thank her for her service to CPP Investments.” A spokesperson for the $632 billion (US$462 billion) fund declined to comment further. In addition to BlackRock, Walters previ\n\nThis Week in Pensions & Investments: 10-11-2023\n\nThese are the top stories covering pensions & investments this week: 1) CPP Investments ended its second quarter of fiscal 2024 on September 30, 2023, with net assets of $576 billion, compared to $575 billion at the end of the previous quarter: The $1 billion increase in net assets for the quarter consisted of $488 million in net income and $700 million in net transfers from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). The Fund, which includes the combination of the base CPP and additional CPP accounts, achieved a 10-year annualized net return of 9.6% . For the quarter, the Fund’s net return was 0.1%. In the 10-year period up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2024, CPP Investments has contributed $311 billion in cumulative net income to the Fund. For the six-month fiscal year-to-date period, the Fund increased by $6 billion consisting of a net loss of $4 billion, plus $10 billion in net CPP contributions. For the period, the Fund’s net return was negative 0.7%. “Our\n\nRegulators Demanding More Disclosure From Private Equity and Hedge Funds\n\nLewis Jackson of Reuters reports Australian regulator warns pension funds over unlisted company valuations after Canva slump: Australian pension funds need to improve how they value private equity, the sector's regulator said on Monday after a review into the sector's treatment of Canva, an Australian technology startup whose lofty valuation tumbled last year. Sydney-headquartered software firm Canva hit a peak valuation of $40 billion in late 2021, only to be revised sharply lower to $25.5 billion last August amid a downturn in technology stocks. Major funds including Aware Super and Hostplus were investors . The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) on Monday said while most funds had \"appropriate\" valuation practices for Canva, \"several areas required improvement\", including instances where boards were not given appropriate information or were unwilling to challenge what they had been told. The regulator also said some valuation\n\nCDPQ Allocates C$600 Million to Quebec's Fiera Capital\n\nTrevor Abes of Stockhouse reports pension manager CDPQ parks C$600M with Quebec's Fiera Capital: Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the province’s most prominent pension manager, has invested C$600 million with Fiera Capital (TSX:FSZ), a leading Quebec asset management firm The allocation is part of CDPQ’s ambition, announced in 2023, to more than double its allocation to Quebec asset managers to C$8 billion by 2028 Fiera Capital, assets under management C$165.2 billion, delivers customized and multi-asset solutions across public and private markets to clients in North America, Europe and Asia Fiera Capital stock has added 25.38 per cent year-over-year, but has given back 25.79 per cent since 2019 Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), the province’s most prominent pension manager, has invested C$600 million with Fiera Capital (TSX:FSZ) , a leading Quebec asset management firm.

The move by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas — which manages $202 billion of assets — is another setback for an industry that has struggled with dealmaking and fundraising after a prolonged era of easy profits. Texas Teachers is the second of the largest public pensions to officially reduce its target allocation to private equity. It’s paring that to 12% from 14% — below the average 13% for all US public pensions, pension officials said at its board meeting Thursday. The pension estimates it will report a 9.3% gain for its latest fiscal year, Chief Investment Officer Jase Auby said at the meeting. That’s compare\n\nA Discussion with Jo Taylor and Co-CIOs on OTPP's Mid-Year Resuts\n\nLayan Odeh of Bloomberg reports Ontario Teachers’ fund posts 4.2% return, names ex-Brookfield executive as new CFO: Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan delivered a 4.2% return in the first half of the year as it boosted exposure to stocks and commodities and trimmed back on credit. The fund’s gains equaled C$10.8 billion ($7.9 billion) in net investment income, bringing it to C$255.8 billion of assets. “Our results for the first half of 2024 reflect an ability to generate positive returns in a range of market conditions across our investment teams,” Chief Executive Officer Jo Taylor said in a statement Tuesday. The fund doesn’t disclose returns by category in its midyear results. Credit became 14% of the portfolio on a gross basis as of June 30, down from 16% at the end of 2023.
