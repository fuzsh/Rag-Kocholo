        "text": "ATHENS — Antonis Samaras has worked his entire life to become prime minister of Greece. But now that he has achieved his dream job, the biggest question among both his friends and his enemies is how long he will be able to hold on to it.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Samaras, the leader of the New Democracy party, was sworn into office, ushering in a new coalition government that will put Greece back at Europe’s bargaining table and ending a seven-week leadership vacuum that had destabilized this already fragile nation and cast a shadow over the euro zone’s future.\n\n“I am fully aware of the critical moments we face as a country,” Mr. Samaras said during the transfer from the caretaker prime minister, Panagiotis Pikrammenos, adding that the Greek people were “injured” and needed “healing.”\n\nBut with Greece’s economy at a standstill and European leaders still uncertain about the country’s fate, Mr. Samaras, a pro-European nationalist known for his stubbornness as well as his tactical shrewdness, comes into power with little room for maneuvering and scant chance of comforting Greeks.\n\nThe new government can “incrementally develop a certain sense of stability and certainty, but it will always be vulnerable to any shock — whether political or economic,” said Marco Vicenzino, director of the Global Strategy Project, a geopolitical risk analysis firm based in London.\n\nMr. Samaras’s new role will require significant political contortion. Mr. Samaras, 61, must wrest enough concessions from Brussels in easing the terms of Greece’s austerity agreement to pacify the Greek public. Simultaneously, he needs to pursue root-and-branch changes to his nation’s sclerotic economy and dysfunctional government to persuade Germany and Greece’s other foreign lenders to keep Athens’s financial lifeline in place.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
