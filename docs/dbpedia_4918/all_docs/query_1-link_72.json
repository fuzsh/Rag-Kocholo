        "text": "In January, an EU report condemns \"severe irregularities\", external in Greek accounting procedures. Greece's budget deficit in 2009 is revised upwards to 12.7%, from 3.7%, and more than four times the maximum allowed by EU rules.\n\nThe European Central Bank dismisses speculation that Greece will have to leave the EU.\n\nIn February, Greece unveils a series of austerity measures aimed at curbing the deficit.\n\nConcern starts to build about all the heavily indebted countries in Europe - Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain, external.\n\nOn 11 February, the EU promises to act over Greek debts and tells Greece to make further spending cuts. The austerity plans spark strikes and riots in the streets.\n\nIn March, Mr Papandreou continues to insist that no bailout is needed. The euro continues to fall against the dollar and the pound.\n\nThe eurozone and IMF agree a safety net of 22bn euros to help Greece - but no loans.\n\nIn April, following worsening financial markets and more protests, eurozone countries agree to provide up to 30bn euros in emergency loans.\n\nGreek borrowing costs reach yet further record highs. The EU announces that the Greek deficit is even worse than thought after reviewing its accounts - 13.6% of GDP, not 12.7%, external.\n\nFinally, on 2 May, the eurozone members and the IMF agree a 110bn-euro bailout package to rescue Greece, external.\n\nThe euro continues to fall and other EU member state debt starts to come under scrutiny, starting with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn November, the EU and IMF agree to a bailout package to the Irish Republic totalling 85bn euros. The Irish Republic soon passes the toughest budget in the country's history.\n\nAmid growing speculation, the EU denies that Portugal will be next for a bailout.\n\nOn 1 January, Estonia joins the euro, taking the number of countries with the single currency to 17.\n\nIn February, eurozone finance ministers set up a permanent bailout fund, called the European Stability Mechanism, worth about 500bn euros.\n\nIn April, Portugal admits it cannot deal with its finances itself and asks the EU for help.\n\nIn May, the eurozone and the IMF approve a 78bn-euro bailout for Portugal.\n\nIn June, eurozone ministers say Greece must impose new austerity measures before it gets the next tranche of its loan, without which the country will probably default on its enormous debts.\n\nTalk abounds that Greece will be forced to become the first country to leave the eurozone.\n\nIn July, the Greek parliament votes in favour of a fresh round of drastic austerity measures, the EU approves the latest tranche of the Greek loan, worth 12bn euros.\n\nA second bailout for Greece is agreed. The eurozone agrees a comprehensive 109bn-euro ($155bn; Â£96.3bn) package designed to resolve the Greek crisis and prevent contagion among other European economies.\n\nIn August, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warns that the sovereign debt crisis is spreading beyond the periphery of the eurozone.\n\nThe yields on government bonds from Spain and Italy rise sharply - and Germany's falls to record lows - as investors demand huge returns to borrow.\n\nOn 7 August, the European Central Bank says it will buy Italian and Spanish government bonds to try to bring down their borrowing costs, as concern grows that the debt crisis may spread to the larger economies of Italy and Spain.\n\nThe G7 group of countries also says it is \"determined to react in a co-ordinated manner,\" in an attempt to reassure investors in the wake of massive falls on global stock markets.\n\nDuring September, Spain passes a constititional amendment to add in a \"golden rule,\" keeping future budget deficits to a strict limit.\n\nItaly passes a 50bn-euro austerity budget to balance the budget by 2013 after weeks of haggling in parliament. There is fierce public opposition to the measures - and several key measures were watered down.\n\nThe European Commission predicts that economic growth in the eurozone will come \"to a virtual standstill\" in the second half of 2011, growing just 0.2% and putting more pressure on countries' budgets.\n\nGreek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos says his country has been \"blackmailed and humiliated\" and a \"scapegoat\" for the EU's incompetence.\n\nOn 19 September, Greece holds \"productive and substantive\" talks with its international supporters, the European Central Bank, European Commission and IMF.\n\nThe following day, Italy has its debt rating cut by Standard & Poor's, to A from A+. Italy says the move was influenced by \"political considerations\".\n\nThat same day, in its World Economic Outlook, the IMF cuts growth forecasts and warns that countries are entering a 'dangerous new phase'.\n\nThe gloomy mood continues on 22 September, with data showing that growth in the eurozone's private sector shrank for the first time in two years.\n\nThe sense of urgency is heightened on 23 September, when IMF head Christine Lagarde urges countries to \"act now and act together\" to keep the path to economic recovery on track.\n\nOn the same day, UK Prime Minister David Cameron calls for swift action on the debt crisis.\n\nThe next day US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tells Europe to create a \"firewall\" around its problems to stop the crisis spreading.\n\nA meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington on 24 September leads to more calls for urgent action, but a lack of concrete proposals sparks further falls in share markets.\n\nAfter days of intense speculation that Greece will fail to meet its budget cut targets, there are signs of a eurozone rescue plan emerging to write down Greek debt and increase the size of the bloc's bailout fund.\n\nBut when, on 28 September, European Union head Jose Manuel Barroso warns that the EU \"faces its greatest challenge\", there is a widespread view that the latest efforts to thrash out a deal have failed.\n\nThe sense that events are spinning out of control are underlined by Foreign Secretary William Hague, who calls the euro a \"burning building with no exits\".\n\nOn 4 October, Eurozone finance ministers delay a decision on giving Greece its next instalment of bailout cash, sending European shares down sharply.\n\nSpeculation intensifies that European leaders are working on plans to recapitalise the banking system.\n\nOn 6 October the European Central Bank unveils emergency loans measures to help banks.\n\nFinancial markets are bolstered by news on 8 October that the leaders of Germany and France have reached an accord on measures to help resolve the debt crisis. But without publication of any details, nervousness remains.\n\nRelief in the markets that the authorities will help the banking sector grows on 10 October, when struggling Franco-Belgian bank Dexia receives a huge bailout.\n\nOn 10 October, an EU summit on the debt crisis is delayed by a week so that ministers can finalise plans that would allow Greece its next bailout money and bolster debt-laden banks.\n\nOn 14 October G20 finance ministers meet in Paris to continue efforts to find a solution to the debt crisis in the eurozone.\n\nOn 21 October eurozone finance ministers approve the next, 8bn euro ($11bn; Â£7bn), tranche of Greek bailout loans, potentially saving the country from default.\n\nOn 26 October European leaders reach a \"three-pronged\" agreement described as vital to solve the region's huge debt crisis.\n\nAfter marathon talks in Brussels, the leaders say some private banks holding Greek debt have accepted a loss of 50%. Banks must also raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future government defaults.\n\nOn 9 December, after another round of talks in Brussels going through much of the night, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announces that eurozone countries and others will press ahead with an inter-governmental treaty enshrining new budgetary rules to tackle the crisis.\n\nAttempts to get all 27 EU countries to agree to treaty changes fail due to the objections of the UK and Hungary. The new accord is to be agreed by March 2012, Mr Sarkozy says.\n\nOn 13 January, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgrades France and eight other eurozone countries, blaming the failure of eurozone leaders to deal with the debt crisis.\n\nThree days later, the agency also downgrades the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility.\n\nAlso on 13 January, talks between Greece and its private creditors over a debt write-off deal stall. The deal is necessary if Greece is to receive the bailout funds it needs to repay billions of euros of debt in March. The talks resume on 18 January.\n\nThe \"fiscal pact\" agreed by the EU in December is signed at the end of January. The UK abstains, as does the Czech Republic, but the other 25 members sign up to new rules that make it harder to break budget deficits.\n\nWeeks of negotiations ensue between Greece, private lenders and the \"troika\" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, as Greece tries to get a debt write-off and make even more spending cuts to get its second bailout.\n\nOn 10 February, Greece's coalition government finally agrees to pass the demands made of it by international lenders. This leads to a new round of protests.\n\nBut the eurozone effectively casts doubt on the Greeks' figures, saying Athens must find a further 325m euros in budget cuts to get the aid.\n\nOn 12 February, Greece passes the unpopular austerity bill in parliament - two months before a general election.\n\nCoalition parties expelled more than 40 deputies for failing to back the bill.\n\nOn February 22, a Markit survey reports that the eurozone service sector has shrunk unexpectedly, raising fears of a recession.\n\nThe next day the European Commission predicts that the eurozone economy will contract by 0.3% in 2012.\n\nMarch begins with the news that the eurozone jobless rate has hit a new high.\n\nHowever, the economic news takes a turn for the better just days later with official figures showing that the , externalunexpectedly in January by 0.3%, and the OECD reports its view that the region is showing tentative signs of recovery.\n\nOn 13 March, the eurozone finally backs a second Greek bailout of 130bn euros. IMF backing was also required and was later given.\n\nThe month ends with a call from the OECD for the eurozone rescue fund to be doubled to 1tn euros. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel says she would favour only a temporary boost to its firepower.\n\nOn 12 April, Italian borrowing costs increase in a sign of fresh concerns among investors about the country's ability to reduce its high levels of debt.\n\nIn an auction of three-year bonds, Italy pays an interest rate of 3.89%, up from 2.76% in a sale of similar bonds the previous month.\n\nAttention shifted to Spain the next day, with shares hit by worries over the country's economy and the Spanish government's 10-year cost of borrowing rose back towards 6% - a sign of fear over the country's creditworthiness.\n\nOn 18 April, the Italian government cut its growth forecast for the economy in 2012. It was previously predicting that the economy would shrink by 0.4%, but is now forecasting a 1.2% contraction.\n\nOn 19 April, there was some relief for Spain after it saw strong demand at an auction of its debt, even though some borrowing costs rose.\n\nThe 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 5.743%, up from 5.403% when the bonds were last sold in February.\n\nOn 6 May, a majority of Greeks vote in a general election for parties that reject the country's bailout agreement with the EU and International Monetary Fund.\n\nOn 16 May, Greece announces new elections for 17 June after attempts to form a coalition government fail.\n\nOn 25 May, Spain's fourth largest bank, Bankia, says it has asked the government for a bailout worth 19bn euros ($24bn; Â£15bn).\n\nOn 9 June, after emergency talks Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos says that the country will shortly make a formal request for up to 100bn euros ($125bn; Â£80bn) in loans from eurozone funds to try to help shore up its banks.\n\nOn 12 June, optimism over the bank bailout evaporates as Spain's borrowing costs rise to the highest rate since the launch of the euro in 1999.\n\nOn 15 June, former UK chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown underlined fears of contagion with a warning that France and Italy may need a bailbout.g\n\nOn 17 June, Greeks went to the polls, with the pro-austerity party New Democracy getting most votes., allaying fears the country was about to leave the eurozone."
