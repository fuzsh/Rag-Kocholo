        "text": "Eurozone finance ministers will on Monday (27 January) discuss the latest progress made by Greece in implementing the austerity policies and structural reforms that are a condition of a €240 billion bail-out granted to the country.\n\nYet the debate with Yannis Stournaras, the Greek finance minister, comes at an uncomfortable time. Greece took over the rotating presidency of the Council of Ministers on 1 January and on Tuesday (28 January) will chair a meeting of all European Union finance ministers for the first time under the current presidency. In addition, the Greek government has become increasingly outspoken in its criticism of how its international bail-out has been managed.\n\nEvangelos Venizelos, Greece’s deputy prime minister, on 9 January accused the troika – an ad hoc group of officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund that monitors Greece’s compliance with the austerity programme – of having “a problem of democracy and of legitimacy”.\n\nAt the same time Stournaras warned the troika to soften its stance on Greece, given the political upheaval caused by the programme and the government’s dwindling majority in the national Parliament, which currently stands at three seats.\n\nIn the European Parliament on Tuesday (21 January) Dimitros Papadimoulis, an opposition MP, criticised Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs and the euro, for mistaken projections on Greece and generating a “humanitarian crisis”.\n\nThe government – a coalition of centre-left and centre-right parties – fears that, if the troika discussions drag on, it will benefit Eurosceptic and extremist parties in the European and local government elections in May.\n\nOutperforming\n\nGreece last year outperformed the troika’s forecasts, according to government figures – another reason, the Greeks believe, for the troika to ditch some of its more painful demands. But Greece and its international creditors do not currently see eye-to-eye on whether it will meet its budget targets for 2014, with its lenders pushing the government to reform rules on collective dismissal, increase taxes on restaurants and up the pace of privatisations.\n\nNor have Greece’s creditors indicated that they are prepared to soften their stance. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told the Dutch parliament this week that there were still a number of “open issues” regarding Greece’s implementation of reform targets.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stournaras will explain the Greek presidency’s economic priorities to European Union finance ministers. Completing negotiations to create a single bank resolution authority and complete the EU’s banking union will top Greece’s short legislative agenda, with Parliament dissolving in April for elections in May.\n\nEU finance ministers will be briefed on the state of play of negotiations. They are also expected to authorise the Commission to increase its surveillance of Croatia’s budget, since the country has exceeded budget limits set in EU law."
