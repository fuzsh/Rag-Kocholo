        "text": "The President of the Republic of Macedonia, Dr. Gjorge Ivanov, received today the President of the Council of the European Union, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Evangelos Venizelos.\n\nDuring the meeting, the collocutors exchanged views and information on the process of European integration of the Republic of Macedonia during the Greek Presidency of the European Union\n\nPresident Ivanov wished Greece successful presidency with the European Union and expressed expectation that during the Greek Presidency, the policy of enlargement will still remain among the priorities.\n\nPresident Ivanov noted that the Republic of Macedonia has seen steady progress in key reform areas, as confirmed by the five consecutive recommendations for starting accession negotiations, and that a key obstacle to the European integration progress is still the name issue.\n\nAllowing parallel movement of the process for resolving the bilateral issue and the process of accession negotiations for the EU membership, proven to be a successful and positive practice, if applied in our case, would be beneficial not only for Macedonia but for Greece as well and for the entire region the Macedonian President said.\n\n\"Solution to the open question is possible only with strict adherence to the framework in which the process is led within the United Nations, respecting the existing Security Council resolutions, the Interim Accord, the international law and the Hague judgment,\" the Macedonian President told Minister Venizelos adding that tackling the area of identity and human dignity issues is not a part of the frame and does not contribute to the efforts to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nPresident Ivanov stressed that it is necessary to follow the example of the two societies and, thus, increase mutual trust, which is achieved through frequent contacts at all levels.\n\n\"It does not befit two neighboring European countries in the 21st century to have no communication at the highest political level. Among our countries, there are huge opportunities and potential for cooperation in all areas of mutual interest,\" said President Ivanov and reiterated the open invitation for a visit of the Greek President to the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nIn the context of the bilateral cooperation, the Macedonian President confirmed the interest of the Republic of Macedonia to intensify economic cooperation and strengthen cross-border cooperation, suggesting that broadening of bilateral legal framework for cooperation will contribute to the advancement and political relations between the two countries.\n\nAt the meeting, they exchanged views and information about the latest developments in the region, i.e. the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries."
