        "text": "In January 1975, the Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Caramanlis, stated in parliament: ‘The people have entrusted me with power. They did not tell me how to exercise it’.1 This statement has no particular significance if one sees it as an expression of the fact that, in contrast to direct democracy, in any contemporary representative democracy there is no day-to-day, direct control of the elected leaders by the electorate. However, the statement was made only six months after the collapse of the colonels’ regime and a few months after the general elections of November 1974 which Caramanlis had won with his new party, the New Democracy. The assertion by Caramanlis expresses a general conception of the role of the prime minister in Greece, and has been shared by other prime ministers who have succeeded Caramanlis in power. The general conception is of a prime minister who is unrestrained by other political institutions, such as parliament, the government, or the governing party."
