        "text": "— Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou replaced his finance minister Friday in a Cabinet reshuffle that raised hopes that austerity measures will now be passed to prevent a debt default.\n\nAfter two days of political chaos that threatened to topple the Greek government, Germany also appeared ready to provide billions more in aid to carry the debt ridden country through 2014. German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that the private sector would not be forced to assist in a second bailout.\n\nYields on Greek 10-year bonds dropped more than a percentage point to the still sky-high level of just less than 17 percent, while the Athens Stock Market closed up 3.8 percent at 1,254.02. U.S. stocks ended the week on a positive note, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 42.84 points to 12,004.36.\n\nPapandreou fired Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou, the target of ire\n\namong the ruling Socialists\n\nfor deepening budget-deficit\n\ncuts, in an overhaul aimed at\n\nfending off a party rebellion\n\nand ensuring the passage of\n\nausterity measures needed for\n\na bailout. Papaconstantinou retains a ministerial position.\n\n“The country must be\n\nsaved, and it will be saved,”\n\nsaid Evangelos Venizelos,\n\nwho moved from the Defense\n\nMinistry to take the reins at\n\nthe Finance Ministry. “I am\n\nleaving defense today to go\n\nto the real war.” By promoting Venizelos,\n\nwho challenged Papandreou\n\nfor the party leadership four\n\nyears ago, to the Finance Ministry, Papandreou will hope he\n\nmet demands of his deputies\n\nso that the new package will\n\nget passed. At a seven-hour\n\nmeeting Thursday, Socialist\n\nlawmakers demanded he re\n\nmove inexperienced loyalists\n\nfrom the Cabinet and replace\n\nthem with more experienced\n\nparty veterans.\n\n“We are facing the greatest\n\nthreat our country has experienced in recent decades,”\n\nthe prime minister said at\n\nthe first meeting of his new\n\nCabinet.\n\n“We are again at a critical juncture in the middle of\n\na difficult negotiation that is\n\ncrucial for the future of the\n\ncountry - for an immediate\n\nsolution of a major national\n\nproblem, the problem of debt\n\nthat threatens to destroy us\n\nand destroy the lives of mil\n\nlions of Greeks,” he said.\n\nPapandreou has struggled\n\nto build support for a new\n\npackage of about $40 bil\n\nlion in spending cuts and tax\n\nincreases demanded by the\n\nEuropean Union and International Monetary Fund, which\n\ngranted Greece’s first bailout\n\nloans last year in return for\n\nausterity measures. The pack\n\nage must be voted through\n\nParliament this month if the\n\ncountry is to continue receiving funds from its bailout.\n\nVenizelos, who is expected\n\nto attend a meeting of euro\n\nzone finance ministers in\n\nLuxembourg on Sunday and\n\nMonday, renewed a call to the\n\nopposition Conservatives to\n\njoin the effort of overhauling\n\nGreece’s economy.\n\nPapandreou will travel to\n\nBrussels on Monday to meet\n\nwith European Commission\n\nPresident Jose Manuel Barroso to assuage fears about\n\nGreece’s commitment to the\n\nbailout program. For weeks,\n\nthe commission has called\n\nfor cross-party support for\n\nthe new tax increases and\n\npay cuts, since the measures\n\nwould continue beyond the\n\nend of Papandreou’s term.\n\nThe prime minister had\n\ntried earlier this week to negotiate with Conservatives\n\nto form a coalition government, but the talks collapsed\n\nWednesday in Athens, and\n\nprotesters battled police in the\n\nstreets outside Parliament.\n\nThe reshuffle is partly\n\na response to the failure of\n\nthose talks. The appointment\n\nof Venizelos, the 57-year-old\n\nconstitutional law professor,\n\nis designed to give Papandreou the necessary votes in\n\nParliament, where his Socialists have a majority by five\n\nseats.\n\nVenizelos is considered\n\nPapandreou’s main internal\n\nSocialist rival. A veteran of\n\nseveral ministries, he handled\n\nthe run-up to Greece’s hosting of the Olympic Games in\n\n2004 as culture minister.\n\nGovernment portfolios\n\nwere also redistributed to\n\naddress demands for faster\n\nchange from Greece’s debt\n\nmonitors at the European\n\nUnion and IMF. A new Minis\n\ntry for Administrative Reform\n\nwas created to help scale back\n\nthe country’s public sector.\n\nVenizelos’ immediate\n\ntask is to get on top of bud\n\nget slippages and setbacks\n\nin cost-cutting changes as\n\nwell as pushing ahead with\n\na privatization drive worth\n\n$70.5 billion. At the same\n\ntime, he will have to negoti\n\nate a second bailout package\n\nwith Greece’s frustrated in\n\nternational creditors.\n\nAll this, though, hinges on\n\nwhether Papandreou’s new\n\ngovernment wins a confi\n\ndence vote in Parliament,\n\nlikely at midnight Tuesday.\n\nSocialist dissenters have\n\ngiven no indication they\n\nwill vote against the govern\n\nment, but one rebel said he\n\nwould not back new auster\n\nity measures without “major\n\nchanges.” If the government clears\n\nthat hurdle, there appears\n\nto be a greater chance that\n\nGreece will get a second\n\nbailout. On Friday, Germany’s\n\nMerkel agreed with FrenchPresident Nicolas Sarkozy that private investors should be part of the solution but that their participation had to be “voluntary.” “We would like to have a participation of private creditors on a voluntary basis,” Merkel said in Berlin at a joint news conference with Sarkozy. This “should be worked out jointly with the [European Central Bank] and there shouldn’t be any dispute with the ECB on this.” Merkel declined to give a date for the detail of the aid package to be worked out, saying the matter must be resolved quickly.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nanalysts wrote in a research note that “Germany appears to have backed down” and welcomed the move as the clearing of a key obstacle toa solution for Greece.\n\n“As of last night, there were two main obstacles to sealing a package for Greece: disagreement among European policymakers, and Greek politics,” said Nicola Mai, an analyst at JPMorgan. “Following a meeting between Merkel and Sarkozy this morning, the first of these two obstacles appears to have been lifted.” The government has also promised to cut its public service by 150,000 people by 2015 and effectively end lifetime government jobs. The privatization program will also have to kick up a gear or two, particularly in the energy sector.\n\nDealing with the debt burden is going to take years, analysts say. Many in the markets still think it’s an impossible job and that a default is inevitable.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Elena Becatoros, Derek Gatopoulos, Gabriele Steinhauser and Melissa Eddy of The Associated Press and by Maria Petrakis, Natalie Weeks, Tony Czuczka and Helene Fouquet of Bloomberg News."
