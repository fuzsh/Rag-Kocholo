        "text": "NUNTII: Parthenon Marbles\n\nThis is the sort of thing that makes me suspicious. First I read a piece via the Athens News Agency's email dispatches:\n\nThe exhibit titled, ''Reuniting the Parthenon Marbles - A Cultural\n\nOrder,'' which portrays the Parthenon marbles as they would be as a\n\nwhole, was inaugurated on Tuesday evening at the Athens Concert\n\nHall-Megaron Mousikis by President of the Republic Kostis\n\nStephanopoulos.\n\nAlso present were Parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis, Cultural\n\nMinister Evangelos Venizelos, and UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Marianna Vardinoyianni, among others.\n\nVenizelos described the event as ''a small exhibit with great symbolic\n\nmeaning.'' He also explained that the exhibit had already been held in\n\nParis with Vardinoyianni's initiative under the auspices of UNESCO and\n\nin cooperation with the Greek Ministry of Culture, since in light of\n\nthe upcoming Olympic Games the time is right.\n\nOkay ... so it's basically \"Marbles Reunited\" Lite (less filling, great taste, less filling, great taste). Anyhoo ... then I read from the email dispatch of the Macedonian Press Agency:\n\nThe return of the Parthenon Marbles from the British Museum to Greece\n\nsounded like a utopia 20 years ago but today it gains ground and it is\n\nseen by the international public opinion as a prospect which, if\n\nmaterialized, it will satisfy the sense of rightfulness.\n\nIt is a cultural call expressed by world heritage, stated Greek Culture\n\nMinister Evangelos Venizelos in a press conference he gave in Athens\n\ntoday on the occasion of the great photo exhibition on the Parthenon\n\nMarbles held at Megaron Music Building.\n\nThe exhibition will be inaugurated this evening by President Kostis\n\nStephanopoulos and will remain open for the public until March 28.\n\nMr. Venizelos expressed satisfaction for the results of an opinion poll\n\naccording to which, over 70% of the British, who responded to the\n\nquestionnaire, are in favor of the Greek proposal for the return of the\n\nParthenon Marbles.\n\n70%? Interesting. A week ago it was being trumpeted that 81% of the British public and 90% of British Museum employees were in favour. A couple of weeks before that, Athens News told us it was an \"overwhelming majority ... that almost reached 80%\". Shortly before that, the Scotsman told us rather more clearly, that 73% were in favour of the return, while 81% \"supported the new proposals\". It seems the numbers are 'okay', but not being used 'honestly'.\n\nSo, of course, that sets off all sorts of alarm bells in my head and I hope against hope that I can track down the question(s) asked in the poll itself. Mehercule! Why hasn't the press made a big deal about this poll? The actual questions -- conducted by ICM Research -- are available online. Just in case it disappears, though (that's my Tiberian paranoia kicking in), here's a summary:\n\n1. A random sample of 1002 folks 18+ were polled in December 2003; the results were \"weighted to the profile of all 18-24 year olds\". Hmmmm ... I wonder why (usually a reason is given, no?).\n\n2. The first question asked \"Which, if any, of the following have you heard of?\". The list included the Mona Lisa, Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel stuff, Venus di Milo, Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Rodin's Thinker, the Elgin/Parthenon Marbles, Rosetta Stone, Koohinor Diamond, or none of these. Significantly, only 48% of those polled had even heard of the Elgin/Parthenon Marbles.\n\n3. The followup question was: \"The Elgin Marbles is the section of the Parthenon Sculptures that was transported from the ancient Parthenon Temple in Athens, Greece in 1801 by the Earl of Elgin to Britain. The Elgin Marbles are currently on display in the British Museum. Do you agree or disagree that the British Museum should allow the Elgin Marbles to be reunited and displayed again in Athens, Greece? \" 73% responded affirmatively to this; 18% negatively; and 10% didn't know. (There must be some rounding of numbers, obviously).\n\n4. As if that weren't enough of a killer question to digest over the phone, there then came: \"Recently the Greeks proposed that the British Museum provide half of their Elgin Marbles for display in a new purpose built museum in Athens on loan. This would mean that the British Museum retain ownership of the Marbles, the Marbles would be reunited with the rest of the Parthenon Sculptures in a site overlooking the original temple, and in return the Greeks would provide precious artefacts for the British Museum and other regional museums around the UK. \" I note in passing that there is no mention of when the marbles would be returned; I also note that the proposal folks were asked about was in regards to HALF of the Elgin Marbles. This is something new to me ... I have never read anything except that Greece wanted ALL the marbles back.\n\nIn any event was followed by: \"Now I am going to read out some statements. Please tell me which one best reflects your opinion of the recent Greek proposal?\" There then follows the standard 'completely agree, mostly agree, mostly disagree etc.' set of questions. Perhaps not surprisingly, given that they apparently only wanted half of the marbles, 78% were in the category of completely or mostly agreeing.\n\n5. Those who agreed to any extent (apparently 808) were then asked why they agreed, and there came the usual laundry list ... apparently more than one answer was allowed. Perhaps significantly, only 47% were of the opinion \"The Elgin Marbles belong to the Greeks/should be returned to them. \" This is a number which should be getting far, far more attention. Only 15% agreed on the basis that the \"Greek offer was fair\". Only 13% agreed on the basis that \"The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the British/were 'stolen' by the British.\" 11%: \"The Marbles should be returned to their historical/original setting.\" There were other responses that aren't really of interest (to me, anyway).\n\n6. Those who disagreed (122) were similarly asked why. Interestingly, all of the reasons I would use came in rather low: The British Museum will take better care of the Elgin Marbles (12%), Cannot trust the Greeks to give the Marbles back (6%), The long term loan is really a way for the Greeks to take the Marbles back (3%), Would set a precedent/open up many more claims on British Museums and galleries (3%),The Elgin Marbles are more accessible to people from around the world in the British Museum (1%). The big, tantalizing reason for why folks disagreed was \"Other\" (54%). Heck, even \"Don't Know\" scored more than what I would have said. (23%)\n\n7. The final question was, \"Greece will be hosting the Olympic Games in 2004. Do you agree or disagree that the British Museum should make a commitment during the Olympic Year to display the Elgin Marbles in Greece? \" 77% were in the \"completely agree\" or \"mostly agree\" categories.\n\nSo let's see ... we're going to skew the results to the 18-24 year old age group, arguably the most 'politicized' group in regards to this sort of thing. But even more interestingly, we're going to have a poll of folks, over half of whom do not even know what the Elgin/Parthenon Marbles are. You can figure out the rest for yourself -- journalists should be ashamed for their lack of critical thinking on this one.\n\n9:22:19 PM"
