        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, UT November 1, 2017 – Bonneville International Corporation announced today that it has entered into an agreement to operate four radio stations in San Francisco and four radio stations in Sacramento, California, which have been divested as part of the merger between Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”) (NYSE: ETM) and CBS Radio, Inc (NYSE:CBS).\n\nThe stations Bonneville will operate in San Francisco are KOIT-FM, KMVQ-FM, KBLX-FM and KUFX-FM. In Sacramento, Bonneville will operate KYMX-FM, KZZO-FM, KHTK-AM, and KNCI-FM.\n\nBonneville will begin operating the stations under a local marketing agreement with the Entercom Divestiture Trust, on completion of the Entercom/CBS merger, and subject to FCC approval and other customary conditions.\n\n“Bonneville is honored to have been selected by Entercom and approved by the Department of Justice to operate and program these stations” said Darrell Brown, President of Bonneville. “We are excited to associate with such wonderful brands, in these great markets, and to have the opportunity to work with the talented employees at these stations.”\n\nBonneville has named Carl Gardner, previously its market manager in Seattle, as its market manager in San Francisco, and Steve Cottingim to remain as market manager in Sacramento. David Pridemore, current Director of Sales at Bonneville Seattle, will replace Carl Gardner as market manager.\n\nBonneville currently owns and operates stations in Seattle (KIRO-FM, KTTH & 710 ESPN), Phoenix (KTAR-FM, KMVP-FM & ESPN 620), Denver (KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM & KEPN-AM) and Salt Lake City (KSL TV-NBC, KSL NewsRadio-AM/FM, KSFI-FM & KRSP-FM). Kalil & Co., media brokers, represented Bonneville through this process."
