        "text": "I still can’t figure it out. Why on earth would any woman want to marry Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger?\n\nIs this just a bizarre publicity stunt?\n\nNah, too complicated.\n\nA really sick way of trying to put these accusations behind him?\n\nNope, too obvious.\n\nIs it the unthinkable? Could a pretty, blonde, twenty-something really see herself spending the rest of her life with him?\n\nNo way. Too… dramatic?\n\nAshley Harlan is someone’s daughter. Someone’s sister. Someone’s best friend.\n\nSo am I. But I’m single. And not dating an NFL quarterback. I’ve never been close to marriage. Now, I’m not completely unfortunate. My family has met several of my boyfriends. Some nice. Some not so nice. Kind of a mixed bunch of guys.\n\nMy parents have always been accepting of my dates from different backgrounds, less-than-perfect jobs and unique personalities. They’ve always been hopeful that I’ll end up with a nice guy who makes me happy.\n\nI was curious to see what my immediate family would think of me dating a guy like Big Ben, so I took a quick poll to find out.\n\nI asked my mom what she would say if I told her I wanted to marry a guy that had been publicly accused of raping two women. She laughed. Not exactly the reaction I was expecting but it made me realize just how ridiculous this situation is. Clearly she has confidence in the way she raised me. My mom knows I know better than that.\n\nMy brother asked, “marriage can be non-consensual?”\n\nHe just happens to be in the Marine Corp and could easily break Ben’s nose again.\n\nAnd my dad? Well, he said, “I’d ask you if you were crazy. And then I’d have you committed.”\n\nI’m guessing he’d probably not walk me down the aisle.\n\nAfter my pops’ response, I started thinking about that exchange between a father and daughter.\n\nHow exactly does that conversation go?\n\n“Hey, dad, I have something important to tell you. You know that guy that’s been on the news for being accused of sexual assault? The dude that was suspended from his job for violating the personal conduct policy?”\n\n“You mean Ben Roethlisberger?”\n\n“Yes, dad. That’s him. Well, I love him and we’re getting married.”\n\nInsert gasp followed by complete and awkward silence here.\n\nOK, OK, I’m sure Roethlisberger did the gentlemanly thing and called her father to ask permission. To think her dad actually agreed is just unbelievable.\n\nThe two-time Super Bowl champ tying the knot isn’t even the best part. Roethlisberger is claiming him and his fiancée aren’t living together until they are married because of “religious reasons.” What?! Since when is he so respectful of a women’s wishes?\n\nI wonder how Vegas will play this. What’s the over/under on the length of this marriage? Two months? Three months? I don’t think they’ll even make it to the chapel.\n\nThe Steelers quarterback is going to marry his girlfriend on July 23rd. The couple has been on and off for six years so she’s aware of the sexual assault allegations, drunken parties, strippers and obnoxious attitude.\n\nI hope she has friends sensible enough to tell her she’s making a mistake. I hope her family insists that she keeps her last name.\n\nThis girl knows exactly what she’s getting into. I know that love is supposed to be blind, but love never trumps common sense.\n\nWhere’s Tony Dungy when you need him?"
