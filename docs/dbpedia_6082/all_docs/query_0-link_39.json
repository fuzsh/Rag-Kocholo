ASU is 0-2 after a 26-6 loss at Brigham Young last week while the Mean Green are 0-2 following a 30-0 loss at Texas Tech. Game time this Saturday is 7:00 p.m. The game will be broadcast live on the ASU Radio network by flagship station KMVP and delayed by Fox Sports Arizona on Sunday at 4 p.m.\n\nSeries Summary\n\nASU holds a 3-1 edge in the series that dates back to 1953. The Sun Devils won 2 of 3 games played between 1953 and 1956 and did not meet North Texas again until 1996 when the Sun Devils defeated UNT 52-7 as part of an undefeated regular season. ASU head coach Bruce Snyder (41-29, 7th year at ASU) is 1-0 against North Texas in his career. UNT head coach Darrell Dickey is in his first year as a head coach.\n\nExposure\n\nASU flagship radio station KMVP (860 AM), its sister station KTAR (620 AM) and the Sun Devil radio network will carry the game live. Tim Healey and 1987 Rose Bowl MVP Jeff Van Raaphorst will handle the call. KMVP has teamed with Broadcast.com to provide all Sun Devil radio broadcasts on the internet. Each broadcast can be accessed at www.broadcast.com/sports/ncaa/arizonastate/football.stm. The game will also be shown on a tape-delayed basis on Fox Sports Arizona, Sunday at 4 p.m. Tom Dillon and Doug Plank will be on the call with former Sun Devil Kyle Murphy on the sidelines.\n\nLast Meeting\n\nASU picked up its second win of its undefeated 1996 regular season with a 52-7 win over North Texas on Sept. 14, 1996. No. 18 ASU rolled up 510 yds. of total offense against UNT, then in its second year of Division I competition. Keith Poole caught six passes for 121 yds. and 3 TDs, Jake Plummer was 15 of 22 for 213 yds. and Michael Martin led the Sun Devils with 62 yds. rushing. UNT managed just 128 yards of total offense (32 rushing and 92 passing). J.R. Redmond had 59 rushing yds. on 10 carries and caught 3 passes for 24 yards in the game. Lenzie Jackson, Kenny Mitchell and Creig Spann also had receptions in the game.\n\nPolling\n\nArizona State dropped out of both the AP and ESPN/USA Today poll. Arizona State began the season ranked 8th in the AP poll and 9th in the coaches' poll.\n\nLast Week\n\nArizona State dropped to 0-2 for the first time since 1979 with a 26-6 loss to Brigham Young in Provo, Utah. ASU's offense, which scored 38 points and piled up 544 yards of total offense against Washington, managed just 308 total yards of offense, 23 rushing yards and didn't score until the fourth quarter. Even though BYU's Ronney Jenkins rushed for 171 yards on 30 carries, ASU's defense showed improvement from week one. BYU's passing attack completed 7 of 27 passes for 166 yards.\n\nUniversity Libraries Day\n\nArizona State University libraries are the beneficiary of a $2 surcharge for the North Texas game. ASU's Athletic Department forwarded $50,000 to the ASU Library System in last year's Libraries Day.\n\nOn Deck\n\nASU resumes its Pac-10 schedule with Oregon State visiting Tempe. The Beavers are 2-0 for the first time since 1985 after wins over Nevada and Baylor. ASU has won four straight against the Beavers.\n\nJekyll & Hyde\n\nASU's 465 yards of total offense against Washington in its season opener was the most by an ASU squad in its season opener since 1981 when the Sun Devils rolled up 544 yards in a 52-10 win over Utah. Gerald Riggs rushed for 139 yds. and 2 TDs on 14 carries in that game. Last week, the Sun Devils scored just six points and rushed for only 23 yards. A statistical comparison between the two games:\n\nASU Offense Rush/Pass/Total Washington 163/302/465 at Brigham Young 22/286/308 Average 92.5/294/386.5\n\nBouncing Back\n\nArizona State has not lost three games in a row since 1994 when ASU closed out the season with three straight losses.\n\nSuccessful Program\n\nA look at some of Arizona State's recent success since the end of the 1995 season:\n\n3 ASU has won 24 of its last 31 games, including 19 of 24 regular-season contests.\n\n3 ASU has won 11 of its last 14 home games.\n\n3 ASU has won 10 of 12 road games.\n\n3 ASU has won 14 of its last 17 Pac-10 games.\n\n3 ASU has won 7 of its last 10 non-conference games.\n\nLeader of the Pac\n\nIf you compile the record of each Pac-10 team since 1995, Arizona State is the best team in the conference:\n\nCombined Record Last Three Seasons ('95-96-97) Team Record Pct. 1.

Redmond -- All Purpose Excitement\n\nSun Devil junior J.R. Redmond is one of the most exciting players to watch in college football. The Heisman Trophy candidate is, first and foremost, ASU's starting tailback. Redmond started only one game prior to this season after backing up the likes of Michael Martin and Terry Battle. Redmond has rushed for 1,302 yards in his three seasons in Tempe, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. Last year, Redmond led the Pac-10's top rushing offense with 86.5 yards per game and was named the Sun Devils' Offensive MVP in a vote of his teammates. He was also named an honorable mention All-Pac-10 player as a running back in 1997. Against Washington, he topped the 100-yard rushing mark for the fifth time in his career with 108 yards on 22 carries.\n\nRedmond Year-by-Year Rushing Year G/GS Att. Yds. Avg TD Lg. 1996 10/0 63 301 4.8 2 41 1997 10/1 142 865 6.1 7 93* 1998 2/2 38 136 3.6 1 22 Totals 22/2 243 1302 5.4 10 93* *5th longest run in ASU history (8/30 vs. New Mexico State)\n\nRunning the football isn't the only facet to Redmond's game. Redmond ranks 24th in the nation with 158.0 all-purpose yards per game. His 254 yards of all-purpose yardage against Washington was the fourth time in his career he had topped 200 all-purpose yards in a game. His 68 yards receiving against Washington was a career high. He was third in the Pac-10 and 12th in the nation in all-purpose yardage for 1997, averaging 159.0 per game. As a result, he was selected to the 1997 All-Pac-10 first-team as an all-purpose player. In 1997, he led his team in punt and kickoff returns while catching the fifth-most passes. He has totaled 2,685 all-purpose yards in his career, averaging 8.2 yards each time he touches the ball, whether it be via rush, reception, punt or kickoff return.\n\nRedmond Year-by-Year All Purpose (No.-Yds) Per Per Game Rush Rec. Punts KO Total Touch Game 1996 63-301 9-197 31-260 2-83 105-841 8.0 84.1 1997 142-865 15-186 24-236 14-303 195-1590 8.2 159.0 1998 38-136 7-94 5-74 1-12 51-316 6.2 158.0 Career 243-1302 31-477 60-570 17-398 351-2747 7.8 124.9\n\nRedmond has also electrified his teammates with big plays. Below is a breakdown of his \"big play\" capability as defined by a gain of 20 yards or more for a run, catch or punt return and a kick return of 40 yards or more. Redmond had three such plays against Washington -- a 47 yard reception, 22 yard touchdown run and a 61-yard punt return -- all of which were or led to touchdowns. Of the 25 ASU possessions that have included a \"big play\" by Redmond in his career, ASU has scored 18 touchdowns and 2 field goals. The Sun Devils have scored on 18 straight possessions that included a Redmond \"big play.\"\n\nRedmond Big Plays Yd Gain Total Rush Catch PR KR* Led to Score 20-29 10 5 3 2 -- 6 30-39 3 0 2 1 -- 3 40-49 6 1 2 0 3 5 50+ 6 3 1 2 0 6 Total 25 9 8 5 3 20 (18 TDs) *Big Play Kickoff Return must be more than 40 yards\n\nIn 1998, Redmond will also try his hand as a defensive back. Head coach Bruce Snyder plans to use Redmond in certain game situations as a safety.\n\nRyan Kealy -- The Dealer\n\nSophomore QB Ryan Kealy, a Sporting News first-team Freshman All-American in 1997, distinguished himself as the top freshman quarterback in ASU history and among the best in Pac-10 history last season. This year, Kealy is averaging 271.5 passing yards per game after two games that couldn't have been more different. Against Washington to open the 1998 campaign, Kealy passed for a career high 302 yards, completing 20 of 35 passes for 3 touchdowns with no interceptions. The last time an ASU QB had passed for over 300 yards was Jake Plummer's 316 yds. against Stanford on Oct. 16, 1996. Last week, Kealy was 16 of 34 for 241 yards as the passing game was never in sync. His interception against BYU was his first in 93 pass attempts. After two games, Kealy ranks 33rd in the nation in passing efficiency (134.5) and 19th in the country in total offense (265.5 ypg.). In his last nine games, Kealy has thrown 15 TD passes with only 4 INTs.\n\nKealy Year-by-Year Year G/GS Comp-Att. Pct. Yds. TD-Int Lg.

Equally as evident are his talent, tireless work ethic and leadership. Named the top center in the nation, Ruegamer is a candidate for both the Outland and Lombardi Awards after being a consensus preseason All-American selection. A first-team All-Pac-10 selection in 1997 and an honorable mention All-Pac-10 pick in 1996, Ruegamer has been a staple in ASU's offensive line in each of the last two seasons, with ASU leading the league in rushing each year. Versatility is also a quality of Ruegamer's as he has played center, left tackle and right tackle during his ASU career. In 1997, he graded out at 85 percent or better in all but three games, including a 92% rating against New Mexico State.\n\nLenzie Jackson -- Leader of the Pack\n\nSenior WR Lenzie Jackson heads an ASU wide receiving corps that has been rated as one of the best in the nation. Jackson is ASU's most consistent and dangerous pass catcher as he leads the team with 10 catches for 133 yards in 1998. Including bowl games, Jackson has a catch in 27 straight games and can tie John Jackson's (USC, 1986-89) Pac-10 record of 37 consecutive games with a reception. Last year, he led the team in 1997 with 53 catches for 733 yards and five touchdowns. The 53-catch season was tied for the sixth-best single season in ASU history and he is the ninth receiver in ASU history to pull in 50 or more catches in a season.\n\nHe also showed a new facet of his game against this year by returning kicks as he is averaging 23.1 yards per kickoff return which ranks 34th in the nation and fifth in the Pac-10. His 147.5 all-purpose yards per game ranks fifth in the Pac-10 and 35th in the nation.\n\nJackson Year-by-Year Receiving Year G/GS Rec. Yds. Avg.

Yds. Avg. TD Lg. Washington 4 67 16.8 0 36 at BYU 6 66 11.0 1 15\n\nKendrick Bates\n\nJunior TE Kendrick Bates has proven his 6-6, 246-pound frame can do more than block. Bates finished 1997 third on the team with 23 catches for 320 yards, averaging 13.9 yards per catch. Among Pac-10 tight ends, Bates finished second only to Oregon's Blake Spence in catches and yardage last year. This year, Bates has five catches for 42 yards after two games including a 13-yard touchdown catch against Washington.\n\nBates Year-by-Year Receiving Year G/GS Rec. Yds. Avg.

In the first two weeks, Kealy has connected with eight receivers. Five of those receivers have caught two or more passes in both games and three receivers have caught three or more in both games.\n\nReceiver vs. Wash at BYU Total Lenzie Jackson 4 6 10 Creig Spann 4 3 7 J.R. Redmond 4 3 7 Kendrick Bates 3 2 5 Tariq McDonald 2 3 5 Kenny Mitchell 2 1 3 Brian Forth 0 2 2 Todd Heap 1 0 1\n\nJeff Paulk -- The Incredible Paulk\n\nArizona State has led the Pac-10 in rushing for each of the last two seasons as the Sun Devils have totaled 5,372 rushing yards (including bowl games) from 1996-98. While the likes of Terry Battle, Michael Martin and J.R. Redmond account for much of that total, senior flyback Jeff Paulk's lead has been a huge reason why. The 6-1, 247-pounder is ASU's most intimidating presence and is the oft-forgotten component of an ASU backfield (QB-TB-FB) that was ranked among the top 3 in the nation by three different preseason publications.\n\nNotes on Defense\n\nMitchell Freedman -- Fright Night\n\nThe veteran leader of Arizona State's defense is senior free safety Mitchell Freedman. The most feared hitter in the Pac-10, Freedman is one of three first-team All-Pac-10 defenders returning this season. Having appeared in 33 games, starting in 31, Freedman has been a staple in ASU's defense for each of the last four seasons. Freedman's picked up the 200th of his ASU career against BYU when he totaled 8 tackles, including one sack. Freedman was the only freshman to be named to the All-Pac-10 first or second teams in his redshirt freshman season when he was credited with a career-high 80 tackles. A second-team All-Pac-10 selection again in 1996, Freedman gave a memorable performance against Nebraska when he forced three fumbles, recovering one, and was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week (all with a broken finger). Last year saw Freedman consistently play well, but once again shine in big games -- as evidenced by his career high 15 tackles against Washington and forced fumble that sealed ASU's win over eventual Pac-10 champion Washington State.\n\nFreedman Year-by-Year Year G/GS UT/AT TT TFL/Yds.

Battle started 11 games and totalled 44 tackles in 1997 and has appeared in 32 games (18 starts) over his Sun Devil career. Jackson was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection in 1997 when he started all 11 games. Jackson has moved from the right corner to the left corner position for this season. He has amassed 59 tackles, two interceptions and 14 pass deflections in 24 appearances (15 starts) as a Sun Devil.\n\nBack-to-Back\n\nArizona State has led the league in scoring defense for each of the last two seasons. ASU gave up just 17.8 points per game in its Rose Bowl year of 1996 and also led the league in rushing, passing and total defense. Last year, ASU had to replace six starters on the defensive side of the ball and ended the year allowing just 18.5 points per game, once again leading the league. The 1997 defense ranked third in passing and total defense and fourth against the run.\n\nInexperience\n\nWith only three starters returning, ASU's defense will look for previous back-ups to step into starting roles. Of ASU's 11 starters, six had started prior to this season and only four -- Battle, Trejo, C. Jackson & Freedman -- had started more than once in their career. For comparison sake, all but one of ASU's starting offensive unit had previously started a game before Washington with J.R. Redmond's one career start the fewest among them.\n\nOther Notes\n\nStephen Baker -- A Weapon on Special Teams\n\nASU freshman punter Stephen Baker has started his ASU career in excellent fashion. He is averaging 46.2 yards per punt and the Sun Devils rank fourth in the nation in net punting, at 43.3 yards per punt.

A list of Sun Devils in the NFL: Eric Allen (Raiders), Trace Armstrong (Dolphins), Mario Bates (Cardinals), Steve Bush (Bengals), David Dixon (Vikings), Eric Guliford (Saints), Paul Justin (Bengals), Jason Kyle (Seahawks), Randall McDaniel (Vikings), Craig Newsome (Packers), Anthony Parker (Buccaneers), Jake Plummer (Cardinals), Keith Poole (Saints), Damien Richardson (Panthers), Derrick Rodgers (Dolphins), Juan Roque (Lions), Dan Saleaumua (Seahawks), Jason Simmons (Steelers), Derek Smith (Redskins), Phillippi Sparks (Giants), Jeremy Staat (Steelers), Shawn Swayda (Falcons), J.T. Thomas (Rams), Pat Tillman (Cardinals) and Darren Woodson (Cowboys).\n\nTrue Talent\n\nFour Sun Devils from last year's squad made the NFL this year --Damien Richardson, Jason Simmons, Jeremy Staat and Pat Tillman. In addition, Vince Amey is on the Oakland Raiders practice squad. Amey, Richardson, Simmons and Tillman all played as true freshman and never redshirted while Staat was a JC transfer and also played immediately. Unfamiliar Territory\n\nASU's No. 8 preseason ranking by the Associated Press was the second time in Sun Devil history that ASU has been ranked in the top 10 by AP prior to a season. ASU's only other preseason top 10 appearance was in 1976 when it was ranked third, behind Nebraska and Michigan. ASU has appeared in the AP preseason poll a total of 15 times, most recently at No. 20 in 1996.\n\nMissing the Bruins\n\nThe Pac-10 schedule includes eight conference games and the conference rotates which team a school misses every two years.

It has provided ASU with a significant home field edge since its inception. Arizona State is 197-65-3 (.749) all-time in Sun Devil Stadium and 9-3 since the playing surface was dedicated as Frank Kush Field in 1996.\n\nAttendance\n\nASU has drawn six of the eight largest crowds in ASU history in the past two years, including a record 74,963 to the Rose Bowl-clinching win over California in 1996. ASU drew an average of 63,884 to seven home games in 1996, a jump of 15,003 from the previous season - the largest increase in the nation. Last year, ASU drew the fifth-largest crowd in ASU history to the Arizona game (73,682) and the sixth-largest to the WSU game (73,644). ASU bettered its 1996 average attendance by averaging 66,014 fans at home in 1997 -- 2,130 more than 1996. The Sun Devils sold over 52,000 season tickets for the 1998 season, the most since the 1987 season, and drew 72,118 to their season-opener against Washington, the 12th largest crowd in ASU history.\n\nTurnover Edge\n\nIn its last 31 games (dating back to 1995), ASU has a turnover ratio of +26 (72-46). In that span, ASU has accumulated 32 INTs and 40 fumble recoveries while opponents have registered 24 interceptions and 22 recoveries. ASU is 24-7 during the stretch. However, ASU is -4 this year.\n\nThe Century Mark\n\nASU had at least one person rush for 100 or more yards in six of its last seven and 11 of its last 18 games. J.R. Redmond cracked the century mark with 108 yards on 22 carries in ASU's season-opener against Washington this year. ASU is 223-38-5 (.848) all-time when it has someone top the century mark and is 24-6 (.800) since Bruce Snyder's arrival in Tempe.\n\nPac-10 Poll\n\nArizona State was picked to finish second in the Pac-10 in a preseason poll of West Coast media members that regularly cover the league. UCLA received 16 of 30 first-place votes to be tabbed as the favorite for 1997. ASU garnered the other 14 first place votes in the closest poll in 20 years. The complete poll:\n\n1. UCLA (16) 284 6. Oregon 157 2. Arizona State (14) 281 7. Washington State 109 3. Washington 217 8. Stanford 95 4. USC 197 9. California 81 5. Arizona 193 10.
