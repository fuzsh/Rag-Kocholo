        "text": "One of Phoenix Suns general manager James Jones’ best offseason moves was the acquisition of Damion Lee.\n\nLee played four seasons with the Golden State Warriors and his brother-in-law Steph Curry before making his way to Phoenix.\n\nThe wing averaged 8.1 points per game, 3.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists on a team that won an NBA championship, but Lee was ready for a new challenge.\n\n“(Head coach Monty Williams) was surprised I was looking elsewhere after winning a championship. For myself, just personal growth and wanting to blaze my own path, showcase who I am and how my skillset has gotten me to this point,” Lee told Arizona Sports’ Burns & Gambo on Tuesday.\n\nLee heard outside noise that many fans felt he was on the Warriors because of his connection with Curry.\n\nHe said that although it was not the driving factor in leaving the Bay Area, the idea he was on the team because of the world’s greatest shooter did not sit right with him.\n\n“I’m not going to say it didn’t. … The people that understand and watch the game vs. the people that take those lazy takes and say, ‘Damion is just on the team because of Steph,'” Lee said.\n\n“If I had a good game it was because of Steph, if I had a bad game it was ‘why does Steph have this guy on the team,’ not knowing I’ve played this game and I have played it at a high level dating back to my college days. … My trajectory is still going upwards.”\n\nLee played three seasons at Drexel before transferring to Louisville and going undrafted in 2016. He landed with the Atlanta Hawks after two seasons in the G League for one year before moving to Golden State.\n\nHe’s averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.2 assists while shooting 50% from three in 20.4 minutes in Phoenix. He has been a major part of the Suns’ thin bench without starters Chris Paul and Cam Johnson as well as the absence of Jae Crowder."
