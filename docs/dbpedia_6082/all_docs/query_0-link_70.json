        "text": "It didn’t take long for 49ers wide receiver Marquise Goodwin to use some of the money earned from his new contract extension to surprise his family in a big way.\n\nGoodwin unveiled a brand new home to his mother and sister and caught the gesture on video.\n\nWith blindfolds covering their eyes and a red carpet leading up to the steps of the house, Goodwin pulled out all the stops to really make the moment meaningful.\n\nEven though the video has no sound, the emotions shown are as real as ever after Goodwin removes the blindfolds, allowing his family to take in the sight for the first time.\n\n“I know mama… I can feel your energy in this video! All the obstacles WE have overcome… Man…I love you so much mama… thank you for EVERYTHING! Especially blessing me with a sis like my Deja!!!” Goodwin said in the Instagram post.\n\nHis sister, Deja, is 10 months younger than Goodwin and has cerebral palsy.\n\nThe receiver signed a three-year, $18.85 million contract extension with San Francisco in March and from the looks of it, is using the money the right way, helping out those close to him.\n\nThe former Olympian sprinter recorded 56 receptions for 962 yards and two touchdowns in his first year with the 49ers."
