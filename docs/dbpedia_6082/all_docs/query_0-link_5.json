Shares time with religious KPHF.\n\nKPHF 88.3 Phoenix (198?-)\n\nReligious station that operates only at night and shares time with KNAI.\n\nK205CI 88.9 Phoenix (19??-)\n\nTranslator for religious KEAR San Francisco.\n\nKBIE 89.1 Fountain Hills (2000-)\n\nYet another religious station.\n\nK207CO 89.3 Sun Lakes/Phoenix (1998-)\n\nSouth Mountain translator for KBAQ 89.5.\n\nKBAQ 89.5 Phoenix (1991-)\n\nClassical station jointly owned by ASU and the Maricopa Community College District. Transmitter is on White Tanks while studios are on the ASU and Mesa Community College campuses, the latter shared with KJZZ. They operate translators on 89.3 on South Mountain (licensed to Sun Lakes) and soon in north Scottsdale on 89.7.\n\nK210CP 89.9 Mesa (Not on air - target date unknown)\n\nStill another translator.\n\nKFLR 90.3 Phoenix (1985-)\n\nFamily Life Broadcasting operates this station which began in 1978 on AM 1230 when the company bought KRIZ. It sold the AM in 1985 when the FM frequency became available. The AM is now KOY after many format and call-letter changes.\n\nK214DN 90.7 Surprise (2000-)\n\nReligious translator.\n\nKGCB 90.9 Prescott/Wickenburg (1996-)\n\nAnother religious station.\n\nKFCA 88.5 Phoenix (1950-196?)\n\nKFCA 91.5 Phoenix (196?-197?)\n\nKMCR-FM 91.5 Phoenix (197?-198?)\n\nKJZZ 91.5 Phoenix (198?-)\n\nThe original educational FM station in the valley, located at Phoenix College. Started out as a 10 watter on 88.5, moved to 91.5 in the '60s.\n\nKFCA changed calls to KMCR-FM when they relocated to Mesa Community College in the early '70s.\n\nKJZZ carries NPR news & talk programming during the day, Jazz at night, Blues on Sunday nights.\n\nK220GO 91.9 Tempe/Phoenix (1999-)\n\nRebroadcasts a religious station in Idaho. Actually located on South Mountain.\n\nKXTC 92.3 Glendale (1972-1980)\n\nKJJJ-FM 92.3 Glendale/Phoenix (1980-1984)\n\nKEZC 92.3 Glendale/Phoenix (1984-1985)\n\nKKFR 92.3 Glendale/Phoenix (1985-)\n\nOriginally a Jazz station, they did Disco in the late '70s. After Disco died in 1979 they tried country, but I'm not sure if they simulcasted KJJJ AM-910. Changed calls to KEZC in 1984 and were called Easy Country for about a year before becoming KKFR (now Power 92).\n\nPower 92 was originally known as The Fire Station but changed to Power in 1988. Old call letters: KXTC, KJJJ-FM, KEZC.\n\nK224CJ 92.7 Phoenix (19??-)\n\nSouth Mountain translator for KAZL 101.1 Payson.\n\nKALF-FM 93.3 Mesa (196?-1968)\n\nKMND-FM 93.3 Mesa (1968-1971)\n\nKDKB-FM 93.3 Mesa/Phoenix (1971-198?)\n\nKDKB 93.3 Mesa/Phoenix (198?-)\n\nNot sure if KALF-FM was ever used on the air, but I did see a listing for this station in a mid-'60s station guide as a CP.\n\nKMND-FM was a Country station simulcasted with AM 1510. Went broke in the early '70s and was resurrected as KDKB AM & FM.\n\nKDKB is an AOR station that has been around forever. Originally on both AM (1510) and FM, the AM became KDJQ in the early '80s. KDKB is the FM home of the Phoenix Coyotes.\n\nKFMA 93.7 Wickenburg (1992-1993)\n\nKMEO 93.7 Wickenburg (1993-1995)\n\nKBSZ 93.7 Wickenburg(1995)\n\nKBSZ 94.1 Wickenburg(1995-1996)\n\nKSWG 94.1 Wickenburg (1996-)\n\nKFMA was a modern-rock station that didn't last long.\n\nKMEO was no relation to the old KMEO 740 & 96.9. This one was a \"New Age\" music station that was definitely in the wrong city. Almost no advertising either. Moved to 94.1 (which helped the signal) and changed calls to KBSZ but it still didn't make it.\n\nKSWG is a satellite-delivered country station.\n\nKOOL-FM 94.5 Phoenix (195?-)\n\nOne of the few (along with KUPD & KNIX) pre-1970 FM stations still using its original call letters.

This application has not been acted upon as of the time of this writing (7/28/2000).\n\nUPDATE 10/13/2000 - The new city of license will be Mayer, not Sun City West. The transmitter will be just south of Prescott and will cover the areas of Flagstaff, Payson, Prescott, and the northern part of Phoenix.\n\nKRFM 95.5 Phoenix (196?-197?)\n\nKQYT 95.5 Phoenix (197?-1987)\n\nKOY-FM 95.5 Phoenix (1987-1994)\n\nKYOT 95.5 Phoenix (1994-)\n\nKRFM & KQYT were easy-listening stations.\n\nKOY-FM (Y-95) was a Contemporary-Hit station in the late '80s.\n\nKYOT is a Smooth Jazz station.\n\nK242AG 96.3 Phoenix (19??-)\n\nSouth Mountain translator for KLVA 105.5 Casa Grande.\n\nKMEO-FM 96.9 Phoenix (196?-198?)\n\nKPSN 96.9 Phoenix (198?-1995)\n\nKCHT 96.9 Phoenix (1995)\n\nKHTC 96.9 Phoenix (1995-1997)\n\nKGLQ 96.9 Phoenix (1997-1999)\n\nKMXP 96.9 Phoenix (1998-)\n\nKMEO-FM was an easy-listening station simulcasted with AM 740. No relation to the later KMEO in Wickenburg on 93.7\n\nKPSN \"Sunny 97\" played '60s and '70s oldies similar to what KOOL-FM does today.\n\nKCHT was very briefly used after the demise of KPSN. Changed to KHTC after a couple of weeks when station owner Bonneville Communications figured that KCHT could be interpreted as \"K-SH#T.\" Uh huh.\n\nKGLQ \"Eagle 96.9\" was a classic-hits station with personality. KMXP plays '80s and '90s hits.\n\nKRXS 97.3 Globe (19??-)\n\nLow-powered \"Town & Country\" station from Globe, 70 miles east of Phoenix but does put a decent signal into the east valley. Need some history of this one.\n\nK248AL 97.5 Phoenix (19??-1999)\n\nThis translator for KRXS is currently off the air. They are located on Shaw Butte in north Phoenix and formerly were a translator for KRXS 97.3 Globe.\n\nKUPD-FM 97.9 Tempe/Phoenix (196?-1980)\n\nKUPD 97.9 Tempe/Phoenix (1980-)\n\nLong-time album-rocker and Top-40 before that, competing with KRIZ, KRUX, and KBBC in the early and mid '70s. Simulcasted with KUPD 1060 until 1980.\n\nKTAR-FM 98.7 Phoenix (195?-1972)\n\nKBBC 98.7 Phoenix (1972-198?)\n\nKKLT 98.7 Phoenix (198?-)\n\nKTAR-FM was a sister station to KTAR (obviously) but I don't know the format. KBBC was Top 40 competition to KRIZ, KRUX, and KUPD in the '70s, while KKLT has been Lite Rock since the late '80s.\n\nK257CD 99.3 Phoenix (1980-)\n\nThis translator (on Shaw Butte) used to rebroadcast KSTM 107.1 Apache Jct. but now carries KAJM 104.3 Payson.\n\nKNNN 99.9 Phoenix (1979-1982)\n\nKLZI 99.9 Phoenix (1982-1988)\n\nKESZ 99.9 Phoenix (1988-)\n\nFirst attempt at a Spanish-language FM in Phoenix. It didn't last - too early. KLZI was a soft-rock station that replaced KNNN. Evolved into KESZ.\n\nKnown as KEZ, KESZ is the home of Beth and Bill. Was KTVK's (TV 3) FM sister station for years until they sold to Owens Broadcasting (KNIX) in 1998, then to Clear Channel.\n\nKIKO-FM 100.3 Globe (195?-197?)\n\nKEYX 100.3 Globe (197?-19??)\n\nKGRX 100.3 Globe (198?-1994)\n\nKZRX 100.3 Globe/Phoenix (1994-1997)\n\nKHOT 100.3 Globe/Phoenix (1997)\n\nKDDJ 100.3 Globe/Phoenix (1997-)\n\nOne of the earliest FM stations in Arizona. It was on the air at least by 1958. KEYX and KGRX were later call letters. Info?\n\nKZRX \"Z-Rock\" was a Heavy-metal station that replaced KGRX. Became KHOT, a short-lived attempt at FM \"Hot-Talk.\" No relation to the current KHOT on 105.9.\n\nKDDJ relays KEDJ 106.3 for the east valley. A proposed frequency swap with KLVA 105.5 fell through last year.\n\nKDOT-FM 100.7 Scottsdale (196?-1978)\n\nKOPA-FM 100.7 Scottsdale/Phoenix (1978-1986)\n\nKSLX-FM 100.7 Scottsdale/Phoenix (1986-)\n\nKDOT-FM was an easy-listening station.
