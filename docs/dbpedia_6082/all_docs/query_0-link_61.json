        "text": "“Seems like in this state, you’re either a Sun Devil\n\nor a Wildcat.” – ASU head coach Dennis Erickson\n\nMy “relationship” with Arizona State University began in\n\n1978. Living in New York, my father had decided he’d had\n\nenough of life as a New York City police officer, and once\n\nhe was promoted to captain, he’d retire and move his\n\nfamily across the country for a new start. Destination:\n\nArizona.\n\nMy older sister, Lauren, had decided also to attend\n\ncollege at ASU, so she actually made the cross-country\n\ntrek before the rest of us.\n\nI was a seven-year-old sports nut who knew about\n\ndefensive end Al Harris of the Sun Devils. Being only a\n\nlad, I didn’t realize the vastness of the ASU campus, so I\n\npresented an assignment for my sister when she got to\n\nTempe: get me Al Harris’ autograph.\n\nWhen a manila envelope containing two signed black-and-\n\nwhite\n\nglossies of Outland Trophy candidate Al Harris a few\n\nmonths later, I was hooked.\n\nOur house was a Sun Devil one for the next several years,\n\nuntil my youngest sister Janine (who is 3 years older than\n\nme) announced to my parents that she wanted to move away\n\nfrom home for school, and she was headed to Tucson to\n\nattend [gasp!] the University of Arizona.\n\nWelcome to a house divided, Marotta family. Some of the\n\narguments my sister and I engaged in through the years\n\nwere epic, especially when we were both in college–her in\n\nTucson and me in Tempe. Some of them still exist, as we\n\neach take almost as much pleasure in a loss for our rival\n\nthan a win for our own team.\n\nThere are thousands of people in the state of Arizona that\n\nfind their homes divided by this rivalry, making this week\n\nand interesting, fun, and in some cases, tense.\n\nRob Reyes, 1998 ASU engineering graduate who lives in the\n\nBay Area, has a unique perspective of the rivalry. He’s\n\nbeen on both sides of it. Reyes grew up in Tucson, and\n\nhis parents were both avid Wildcats fans and tailgaters.\n\n“I didn’t know any better,” Reyes said about his Wildcat\n\nfandom. “The whole family was around U of A, and I got a\n\nregents’ scholarship to ASU and U of A, and for some\n\nreason I picked U of A.”\n\nReyes attended school in the Old Pueblo for a year and a\n\nhalf before deciding to change his collegiate address to\n\nTempe.\n\nOn the hatred scale, Reyes says since he was once a fan of\n\nthem, it’s hard to despise the Wildcats–for most of the\n\nyear, that is. “Come rivalry week, I detest everything\n\nabout them.\n\nI hate that red. I hate that blue. I mean, I don’t even\n\nwear my blue suit during rivalry week,” he said.\n\nWith the hate that exists between the two institutions,\n\nsurely a Sun Devil couldn’t marry a Wildcat, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nZack (2003 Kinesiology graduate from ASU) and Emily (2002\n\nJournalism graduate from U of A) tied the knot about six\n\nyears ago, and they claim the rivalry has never\n\nreally been an issue in their relationship.\n\n“Fortunately, the rivalry has always been a friendly one,”\n\nEmily said. “Though, I think my grandpa (one of the\n\nbiggest Wildcats I’ve ever known) had some angst when he\n\nfound out that I was marrying a Sun Devil.”\n\nFriendliness was put on hold for a few moments as they\n\neach took a shot at the other insitution to get\n\ninto the Territorial Cup spirit.\n\n“ASU’s colors are hideous, its mascot is scary and its\n\nfans are belligerent,” Emily said.\n\nZack countered with “UA’s colors are boring, its mascot is\n\njuvenile and its fans are delusional.”\n\nI think that qualifies as a fight–or at least a minor\n\nskirmish.\n\nOK, so what if your grandfather is a legendary figure in\n\none school’s history? Certainly you’d side with grandpa,\n\nright? Maybe not.\n\nThe late Dan Devine coached the Sun Devils from 1955 to\n\n1957, and guided them to a sterling 27-3-1 record.\n\nBut two of Devine’s grandchildren didn’t follow in the\n\nfootsteps of the family, and instead attended U of A.\n\nKyle Avery is Devine’s grandson, and is currently a\n\nsophomore at the University of Arizona. Avery’s older\n\nsister started the trend in heading down to Tucson to\n\nfurther their education, and he followed the lead.\n\n“As you would expect my parents were taken aback by the\n\nboth of us having interest in this school, but once we\n\nwent through the whole college process, they slowly, but\n\nsurely, warmed up to it,” he said. “I decided in early\n\nMarch of my senior year (2010) that I would be attending\n\nthe University of Arizona, but my whole life I never\n\nreally envisioned myself going there, so it did feel\n\npretty strange declaring my allegiance to my family’s\n\nrival school.”\n\nAvery will be torn on Territorial Cup Saturday, because\n\nthe maroon and gold is still in his blood despite where he\n\nattends college.\n\n“I really do not hate ASU and I am still a die-hard for\n\nthem, so I have to keep it a secret from my U of A buddies\n\nsince they would probably lay the smackdown on me for\n\nstill rooting for them,” Avery said, before adding that\n\nhe’d proudly be wearing his Zona Zoo shirt into the loge\n\nsection, where his parents have had season tickets for\n\nalmost 30 years.\n\nWhat do you do when you’re caught in the middle of the\n\nrivalry with a mom who’s a Wildcat fanatic, and dad who\n\nbleeds maroon and gold?\n\nI didn’t have to go far to find that answer; I asked my\n\nown 15-year-old son Branden, because this is the situation\n\nhe deals with every November. In his experience with this\n\nvenomous in-state rivalry, he’s become pretty adept at\n\nplaying the role of Switzerland–completely neutral.\n\n“Most of the time I cheer for both teams, but at some\n\npoint, I’ll choose one of them, and that’s where I’ll go\n\nto college,” he said.\n\nThat got Dad curious. So I asked him if he had to pick\n\nright now, where would it be? “I really don’t know,” he\n\nanswered. Damn.\n\nI regrouped. I asked him what he thinks will happen on\n\nSaturday.\n\n“ASU is more than likely going to win,” he said.\n\nYes! A minor victory. But in this rivalry, you’ll take\n\nany victory you can get."
