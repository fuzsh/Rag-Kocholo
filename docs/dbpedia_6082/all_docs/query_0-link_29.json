        "text": "KDYL launched in 1922 from Salt Lake City. Sidney Fox took over KDYL in 1926. The station later became an NBC affiliate. After bouncing around on a few frequencies, it settled on 1320 AM in 1941.\n\nFox launched an FM sister station in 1947 (the frequency now is held by KBEE-FM) and a sister TV station in 1948 (today’s KTVX-TV). Fox sold the stations in 1953.\n\nScreen Gems Broadcasting purchased the KDYL stations and renamed them KCPX in 1959. The KDYL call letters went to an AM station in Tooele, Utah (today’s KIHU-AM). Salt Lake City’s KWMS adopted the KDYL call letters in 1982, carrying an adult standards format, until flipping to news/talk KZNS in 2001. As of 2014, the station carries a sports format.\n\nKCPX-AM, the original KDYL at 1320 AM, became a Top 40 station. According to Duncan’s American Radio, it flipped to oldies in 1983, changing the call letters to KBUG. The station briefly went back to the KCPX call letters in 1988 before becoming KUTR. It flipped to news/talk KCNR in 1992 before Citadel Broadcasting acquired the station in 1996, flipping it to it its current sports format as KFNZ. Cumulus Media owns the station, as of 2014.\n\nSources: Wikipedia (KZNS-AM), (KIHU-AM), (KFNZ-AM)\n\nSam Adair and John Schilling signed WHB on the air in 1922 from Kansas City. Cook Paint and Varnish Company purchased the station in 1930. It was an independent station until becoming a Mutual Network affiliate in 1936.\n\nWHB operated as a daytime-only station until the FCC granted it full-time status in 1946.\n\nCook signed on WHB-FM in 1948 as a simulcast, but ended the FM service in 1950.\n\nIn 1953, Cook struck an agreement with Midland Broadcasting to share the new TV Channel 9 frequency. Under the arrangement, Cook would operate as WHB-TV for 90 minutes, followed by 90 minutes of Midland-owned KMBC-TV.\n\nCook sold WHB-AM to Omaha entrepreneur Todd Storz in 1954. He enjoyed success with a Top 40 pop format on his stations in Omaha and New Orleans. Storz flipped WHB to the nation’s first 24-hour Top 40 format. It became Kansas City’s most popular station by the end of the year.\n\nWHB-AM’s 10,000-watt signal made the station one of the most powerful Top 40 stations in the country. It became a model for many stations around the nation seeking to copy the success of the Top 40 format. Here’s a sample of what WHB sounded like in 1960:\n\nStorz built attention with elaborate promotions and contests. One treasure hunt led to traffic tie-ups as listeners searched for a turtle with the WHB logo painted on the back. In 1956, Kansas City’s police chief suggested Storz end his treasure hunts over WHB, but the station continued with its contests.\n\nWHB called itself the “World’s Happiest Broadcasters,” airing a mix of Top 40 music, local news and even a late-night talk program which took calls from listeners across the Midwest.\n\nIn the 1970s, listeners began abandoning AM music stations for the crisper sound of FM. WHB’s AM competition had acquired FM licenses, but after WHB-FM failed in the 1950s, the station never acquired an FM sister. WHB’s ratings declined, but the station remained strong into the early 1980s.\n\nStorz Broadcasting sold WHB to Shamrock Broadcasting in 1985. The new owner dropped Top 40 for a oldies. In 1989, KCMO-FM flipped to oldies, drawing away WHB-AM’s listeners.\n\nWHB began simulcasting a farm/country music format in 1993. It swapped frequencies with KCMO-AM in 1998, giving the station a larger daytime coverage area.\n\nUnion Broadcasting purchased WHB and flipped the station to its current sports format in 1999.\n\nSource: Wikipedia (WHB-AM) , Route56.com (WHB History)\n\nExperimental station 6XG became commercial station KGO in 1924, broadcasting from General Electric’s facility in Oakland, California.\n\nKGO’s early programming was comprised mostly of local talent, including a renowned dramatic group called the KGO Players. Local musicians also filled KGO’s broadcast schedule.\n\nInitially, GE hoped to create a three-station network connecting KGO with Denver’s KOA and Schenectady, N.Y.’s WGY. But RCA, owner of GE, launched NBC in 1926. KGO joined KPO in San Francisco as members of the NBC Orange Network, which was the company’s Pacific Coast chain of stations. KGO became the key station for the network in 1929. NBC then took over management and operation of the station and moved it to San Francisco.\n\nKGO became a 50,000-watt clear-channel station in 1941. Two years later, the FCC forced NBC to sell one of its two networks. NBC spun off the NBC Blue Network, which became ABC in 1945. KGO was a charter station of the new ABC Radio Network.\n\nKGO-FM signed on in 1947, simulcasting KGO-AM’s programming. KGO-TV signed on in 1949.\n\nAs network radio’s golden age ended in the early 1950s, KGO carried many live and recorded music programs. It also aired the first exercise program, hosted by fitness instructor Jack Lalanne, which later moved to KGO-TV.\n\nBy the late 1950s, KGO’s ratings were sliding. In 1962, KGO flipped to one of the country’s first full-time news/talk formats. It focused on live, local programming, support from ABC network news and developing a strong local news operation. The audience steadily grew, and KGO dominated San Francisco radio ratings for nearly 30 years as one of the nation’s premier news/talk stations.\n\nCitadel Broadcasting acquired the ABC radio stations in 2007.\n\nAs Arbitron’s new PPM ratings technology arrived, KGO’s ratings eroded. The previous diary method counted on listeners to recall and write down their listening habits, and KGO’s strong heritage may have led to over-reporting. All-news rival KCBS-AM overtook KGO for the top spot in 2010. KGO quickly dropped out of the top 10.\n\nCumulus Media acquired Citadel and KGO in 2011. It dropped the news/talk programming, firing many long-time talk hosts and drawing protest from listeners, for an all-news format. As of early 2014, KGO’s overall ratings have not rebounded.\n\nAccording to a July 2013 article at SFGate.com:\n\nAccording to several sources with strong connections to KGO, the station, along with KSFO, had $40 million in annual revenue in the years before the sale of the stations to Citadel, in 2007. Today, the figure is said to be around $9 million. Two of the sources (former KGO employees) credited the figures to an accounting firm that tracks station revenue, but, citing confidentiality concerns, an employee at the firm declined to comment. (Requests for interviews with KGO executives went unanswered.)\n\nKGO advertisers have gone over to KCBS, said one former staffer. And, he added, sales people departed. One former on-air employee said KGO was slashing rates; spots that personalities read live, once priced as high as $600, could be had for $150, he asserted.\n\nAnother former staffer who has attended sales pitches told me, “They’re not selling ratings anymore. They’re saying they’re a news station and KCBS is expensive, and that if you want the news audience, KGO is less expensive.”\n\nMeanwhile, KGO-FM flipped to a progressive rock format in the late 1960s. It was renamed KSFX in 1971. The station flipped to Top 40 in 1973. It switched to a disco format in the late 1970s before flipping to an album-oriented rock format in 1980. The station flipped to a talk format in 1982, reclaiming the KGO-FM call letters.\n\nABC sold KGO-FM in 1984 to the owner of San Jose’s KLOK-AM. The new KLOK-FM adopted an adult contemporary format known as “Yes/No Radio,” in which listeners phoned in votes for what the station would play. New owners changed the call letters to KKSF in 1987 and programmed a format known as “new adult contemporary,” which was a forerunner to the smooth jazz format KKSF eventually carried.\n\nClear Channel acquired the station in the late 1990s. The smooth jazz format continued until KKSF abruptly switched to a classic rock format in 2009. It flipped to classic hits in 2011 and was renamed KOSF in November 2013.\n\nAs of 2014, ABC/Disney still owns KGO-TV.\n\nRead more about KGO’s history, including pictures, articles and audio at the excellent Bay Area Radio Museum site.\n\nSources: Wikipedia (KGO-AM), (KOSF-FM)\n\nPatroon Broadcasting Company signed on WPTR in 1947 from studios in Troy, N.Y. It carried a mix of popular and country music and joined ABC in 1953.\n\nIn the late 1950s, WPTR adopted a successful Top 40 format. Its 50,000-watt signal attracted loyal listeners all over northeastern U.S. and Canada. A blog post on the Albany Times-Union website includes some WPTR history and links to audio files from the station’s Top 40 era.\n\nHere’s an air check from WPTR in 1977:\n\nAs FM stations began drawing music listeners in the mid-1970s, WPTR’s ratings steadily declined. The station dropped Top 40 for country in 1980, which halted the slide for a few years. In 1986, WGNA-FM switched to country, and WPTR dropped the format in 1988. The station tried several spoken word formats into the 1990s, but ratings continued to slide.\n\nIn 1995, Crawford Broadcasting purchased WPTR and renamed it WDCD, carrying a contemporary Christian format. In 2000, WDCD flipped to adult standards and brought back the WPTR call letters. The new format attracted higher ratings, but was doomed when rival WKLI-FM switched to the adult standards format in 2001.\n\nWPTR flipped back to religious programming as WDCD in 2004. The station went off the air in 2012. It returned to the air in 2013. As of 2014, it appears to be carrying a religious format.\n\nSource: Wikipedia (WDCD-AM)"
