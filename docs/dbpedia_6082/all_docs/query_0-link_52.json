        "text": "2004-10-31: The most widely reported story involving the regulators last week was not one of regulation but the reaction to it in the form of a call by Howard Stern to a San Francisco talk show that included Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Michael K. Powell as a guest (See RNW Oct 27). In terms of licence activity it was a fairly quiet week.\n\nIn Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) made only one licence announcement, that of the award of a new community FM for Dunedoo, New South Wales, to Talbrager Broadcasters Incorporated. Talbrager already operates as 2TRR under a temporary community licence and was the only applicant.\n\nThe ABA also reported that in the 2003-04 year investigations resulting in rulings of breaches of its regulations were down 22%.\n\nIn all it found a breach in 27 cases from 106 investigations completed - 19 of them relating to codes of practice and seven to licence conditions - compared to 50 breaches in the same total in 2002-03.\n\nOf the 27, 11 cases related to commercial TV stations, down from 18 the year befor.\n\nThere were code breaches in four cases involving commercial radio stations compared to two in the previous year; three of the cases involved complaints handling.\n\nIn addition there were three breaches involving code breaches by community radio- down from seven in the previous year, each relating to requirement to have written policy and procedures for conflict resolution in place, and three community radio breaches relating to the broadcast of proscribed advertisements, down from 13 in the previous year.\n\nThere was also one investigation that resulted in a breach of the Broadcasting Services Act, relating to a licensee of an open narrowcasting service providing a commercial broadcasting service without a licence.\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which next week will be holding hearings on applications for subscription radio licences, had a very quiet time.\n\nIt approved the application by Groupe Radio Antenne inc. to acquire, as part of a corporate reorganization, the assets of the radio station CHVD-FM Dolbeau-Mistassini, Quebec, and also, following receipt of an application for a commercial ethnic station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, issued a call for applications from other parties wishing to apply for a licence for services that will \"clearly reflect the diversity of languages, as well as the multicultural and multi-ethnic reality of Winnipeg.\" Applications have to be in by January 27 next year.\n\nIn Ireland, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) made no licence decision although it was involved in the release of latest ratings that showed listening in the Republic up on the previous survey (See RNW Oct 28).\n\nThere were no radio decisions in the UK but in the US the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was involved in a number of enforcement actions.\n\nThey included confirming a penalty of USD 17,000 on a Florida pirate operator (See RNW Oct 29) and of USD 4,000 on Lebanon Educational Broadcasting Foundation, licensee of noncommercial Station KTTK-FM, Lebanon, Missouri, for public file violations.\n\nIt had proposed the penalty in April 2003, reducing it downwards from the standard USD 10,000 because some of the documentation was in the file but not the station's contour map and issues/programs list, and copy of the \"Public and Broadcasting\" manual.\n\nLebanon sought cancellation on the basis that the contour map and manual were in the file but had not been shown to agents because the station's assistant manager had to leave before the inspection and the employee who was present was unfamiliar with the public file. It admitted that other documentation was missing but said the employee responsible had been disciplined and the file subsequently brought up to date. The FCC decided that a further reduction was not justified.\n\nThe commission also required two stations to show cause why they should not be reclassified to allow new services elsewhere.\n\nOne petition asks for Malkan FM Associates' KZFM-FM, Corpus Christi, Texas, to be reclassified from class C to Co to allow a second FM at Karnes City, Texas, and another for Citadel's KURB-FM, Little Rock, Arkansas, to be likewise reclassified to allow a first FM for Altheimer, Arkansas.\n\nBoth the existing stations are operating below Class C requirements.\n\nPrevious ABA:\n\nPrevious BCI:\n\nPrevious CRTC:\n\nPrevious FCC:\n\nPrevious Licence News:\n\nABA web site:\n\nBCI web site: CRTC web site:\n\nFCC web site:\n\n2004-10-31: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has announced that it has reached an agreement with Foxtel for its radio and TV services to be transmitted on the Foxtel Digital satellite and cable platform.\n\nThe service will include the ABC's Triple J, ABC Classic FM, Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, DIG Internet radio and some metropolitan and regional radio stations as well as its TV services.\n\nABC managing director Russell Balding said the outcome was \"of strategic importance to the ABC and is a matter we have been pursuing for some time as we believe that as the national public broadcaster all ABC services should be available on all platforms.\"\n\nHe added that the agreement was \"an extremely positive outcome for the ABC as it sees the growing subscription television sector as a primary element of its digital television aspirations.\"\n\nPrevious ABC, Australia:\n\nPrevious Balding: 2004-10-31: California broadcaster Pappas Telecasting Co., which last week announced that it had donated USD 325,000 in air time on its radio and TV stations to 13 Republican county committees has been told by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it must extend the same offer to other candidates.\n\nThe company had argued that the gifts did not trigger federal equal time rules because company president Harry J. Pappas purchased time at his own stations and donated it to Republican committees to be used any way they wanted: His attorney argued that as the gifts came from an individual the FCC had no jurisdiction.\n\nWilliam Johnson, deputy chief of the FCC's Media Bureau, ruled however that the broadcaster had given free time to a candidate and added, \"When a candidate is furnished time at no cost, competing candidates are entitled to receive the same amount of free time in comparable time periods.\"\n\nAn Associated Press report aid it was not clear if the company would appeal the ruling and quoted Tracy Westen, CEO of the nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies as saying, \"I would have been amazed if the commission had done anything else.\"\n\nWesten added that while Pappas could appeal the ruling FCC, it would have to decide whether to continue airing exclusively Republican ads in the meantime and could risk substantial fines if it did so.\n\nDemocratic Assemblywoman Nicole Parra filed a complaint with the FCC after a Pappas television station in Fresno began running free ads given to her opponent, businessman Dean Gardner. The company said only USD 3,600 of the USD 70,000 in donated time it had booked for Gardner had been used through Thursday and Parra said Pappas must now make USD 3,600 in free airtime available to her.\n\nRNW comment: Irrespective of the FCC ruling it would seem to us that such actions are clearly unacceptable in any reasonably ordered democracy and any owner who, using leased public airwaves, feels it proper to use resources allied to them in this way is unfit to hold a licence. It won't happen but it should: In our view all the company's licences should be revoked in our opinion as a most clear warning to all licensees, whatever their political viewpoint, that such donations are completely unacceptable. We're sure someone else would run the stations so the only losers would be owners who permit such action and we feel that had Sinclair gone ahead with its plan to air an anti-Kerry documentary as originally planned the same response would have been appropriate in that case as well.\n\nThere would, of course, be no reason to prohibit the individuals and companies concerned moving to cable and subscription services not using public airwaves.\n\nPrevious FCC:\n\nBaltimore Sun/AP report: 2004-10-31: A 34-years-old woman has pleaded guilty to stabbing California radio host Bonnie Campbell with scissors.\n\nCampbell, co-host with Bill Pecos of the Bill and Bonnie morning show on KRUZ-FM, Santa Barbara, was stabbed twice while walking her dog near her home in Goleta at the end of August.\n\nShe suffered a punctured lung and her assailant Renita Ausha Simmons charged with assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury. A sentencing is scheduled for December 8 at which she could face up to seven years in jail. 2004-10-30: In more US results, giant Clear Channel has reported third quarter revenues up 4% on a year earlier to USD 2.6 billion and net income of USD261.2 million (44 cents per diluted share), down from USD 636 million a year earlier when the figures had been boosted by approximately USD685.6 million of pre-tax gains related to the Company's investment in Univision Communications Inc. and the sale of an investment in American Tower Corporation.\n\nThe gains were offset by the impairment of investments totalling USD15.0 million pre-tax and excluding these items, 2003 third quarter net income would have been USD236.8 million 38 cents per diluted share) and the Company's third quarter 2004 net income growth would have been up 10% rather than 59% down and per share earnings would have been up 16%.\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Mark Mays said Clear Channel had \"delivered strong financial results during what proved to be a very challenging quarter.\"\n\n\"We generated 16% earnings growth and produced a significant amount of free cash flow during the quarter,\" he added, continuing, \"We continued repurchasing our shares during the past quarter and continue to believe that the purchase of our common stock represents an attractive opportunity to benefit the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. We are in excellent position to increase shareholder value over the long-term.\"\n\nIn divisional revenue terms, Outdoor had the strongest performance with revenues up 11% to USD 66.2 million, Live Entertainment edged into top contributor as a 4% increase took its total to USD 974.7 million; radio was down by USD 3.57 million to USD 960.1 million, and other revenues were up 6% to USD 147.3 million.\n\nNational radio advertising revenues fell, primarily in telecom and automotive advertising, but the fall was partially offset by increases in local advertising, traffic and network revenues. Large market revenues were down but small to mid-size market revenues (markets below the top 25) increased.\n\nClear Channel has now re-purchased some USD 1.6 billion of its shares and CFO Randall Mays commented, \"We have repurchased 45.0 million shares to date for a total of $1.6 billion, which represents just over 7% of our total shares outstanding. We continue to believe that this is the best use of our free cash flow, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Clear Channel expects full year operating income will increase in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and earnings per share will increase in the mid to high teens on a percentage basis excluding excludes gains from the sale of investments and operating assets, and the effects of early extinguishment of debt.\n\nViacom-operated syndication company Westwood One reported revenues for the third quarter up 5% to USD 141.4 million but operating income for the quarter was 13.6% down to USD 40.4 million; Among the prime factors if gave for the fall were costs linked to its 2004 Summer Olympics broadcasts and increased programming and distribution costs.\n\nNet income for the quarter was down 16.2 % to USD 23.2 million and per diluted net income was down 11% to 24 cents a share: Westwood One like Clear Channel and Viacom has been involved in share buy-backs, in its case some 2.6 million shares for USD 58.9 million during the quarter.\n\nPresident and CEO Shane Coppola commented, \"Despite an inconsistent overall advertising marketplace our local/regional businesses demonstrated consistent and improved growth. We expect our investments in our products and services to translate into growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. We continue to increase our audience and program offerings while at the same time controlling costs.\"\n\nCFO Andrew Zaref added that the company's recent stock performance had provided the company with an opportunity for continued acceleration of stock repurchases\" and noted that at the end of the quarter it had $196.4 million available under its buy back program.\n\nPrevious Clear Channel:\n\nPrevious Coppola:\n\nPrevious Mark Mays:\n\nPrevious Randall Mays:\n\nPrevious Westwood One:\n\nPrevious Zaref 2004-10-30: US radio advertising revenues in September were up 4% on a year earlier, reversing a drop of 1% in August, according to the US Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB): Within the figures local revenues were up 5% compared to flat in August and national ones up 1% compared to an August fall of 5%.\n\nRAB's Sales Index, which equates pre-dot com base year 1998 to 100 was a combined 139.9 for September with the local index 138.4 and the national one 143.9.\n\nFor the year to date, combined revenues were up 2% on a year ago with local revenues up 3% but national revenues down 2%: The corresponding indices were 140.3, 140.1 and 141.6.\n\nRAB has also started reporting non-spot revenues, which it has been collecting since January 2002, and these reveals healthy figures for September. Non-spot revenues for September were up 6% on a year ago taking the combined spot and non-spot revenues for the month 4% ahead of September last year.\n\nRAB President and CEO Gary Fries said of the introduction, \"We have been collecting and auditing non-spot revenue since January of 2002 and have found the reporting and accreditation to be accurate and sound. It is a truly legitimate revenue stream for Radio that deserves to be reported, and it is being reported by the broadcasting companies as part of their monthly and quarterly revenue.\"\n\nOn the overall picture he added, \"The increases for September point to Radio's strengthening in the national arena as well as its continued growth in the local marketplace,\" noted Fries. \"The mid-size markets seem to be leading the way in Radio's return to robust sales results, and pave the way for an industry-wide upturn that is expected by 1st quarter of next year.\"\n\nPrevious Fries:\n\nPrevious RAB & RAB monthly figures (Aug 2004): 2004-10-30: The past week has seen a steady run of US station deals albeit with no large ones. In descending order of value they included:\n\nNebraska: A USD 10 million sale by Grace University of Christian KGBI-FM, Omaha, to Salem (See RNW Oct 27)\n\nTexas: A USD 7 million sale by La Radio Cristiana Network Inc. of Tejano/Latin KJAV-FM, Alamo, to Border Media Partners.\n\nNew York State: A USD 4 million sale by Port Jervis (N.Y.) Broadcasting of oldies WDLC-AM and WTSX-FM , Port Jervis, to P.J. Radio run by James Morley, a radio broadcasting executive with no other current holdings.\n\nNew Mexico: A USD 1.3 million sale by Albuquerque-based Radio Property Development Inc. of good time oldies KVLC-FM, Las Cruces, to Radio Property Development of El Paso.\n\nIllinois: A USD 1.15 million sale by M&R Enterprises of RndB and Gospel WESL-AM, East St Louis, to Simmons Media Group.\n\nNebraska: A USD 1 million sale by Prairie States Broadcasting of oldies KAWL-AM and AC KTMX-FM, York, to MWB Broadcasting LLC. 2004-10-30: Chicago husband and wife team Don and Roma Wade could be back on the air as soon as Monday next week according to Robert Feder in the Chicago Sun-Times although he says it is unclear if they will sign up again with Disney-ABC's news-talk WLS-AM or for a re-launched WIND-AM, now with Salem..\n\nFeder notes that Salem is acquiring WIND through a swap with Univision (See RNW Oct 5) and says both Disney-ABC and Salem are thought to be actively pursuing the Wades with \"seven-figure offers.\"\n\nThe Wades on Thursday made their first comment since their contract extension with WLS expired, saying in a statement by Roma: \"We've missed our listeners tremendously these last few weeks and hope to have an announcement very soon. We love all the great listeners who supported us throughout this period, and we can't wait to talk to them again!\"\n\n\"These are juicy times -- in the city, the country, and the world. Don keeps saying he misses straightening out the news. Personally, I miss straightening out Don.\"\n\nFeder also reports that Bonneville is working on a change or revamp for its adult contemporary WNND-FM which, with its current 80's and 90's hits format, tied for 23rd place in the latest ratings for Chicago.\n\nHe says that insiders say Drew Horowitz, senior vice president of Bonneville International and head of its Chicago station group, was working with top programming executives Greg Solk and Barry James in devising a new sound and a new identity for the station.\n\nHorowitz has confirmed that Bonneville is \"evaluating\" its options for the station and Feder notes that imminent changes at WNND and the impending transfer of classic rock WLUP-FM to Emmis Communications in a swap for three stations in Phoenix (Also RNW Oct 5) have set the stage for a management realignment of Bonneville's Chicago operations under Horowitz.\n\nBonneville also owns modern rock WTMX-FM and classic hits simulcast duo WDRV-FM and WWDV-FM in the Chicago market.\n\nPrevious Bonneville:\n\nPrevious Disney-ABC:\n\nPrevious Emmis:\n\nPrevious Feder:\n\nPrevious Salem:\n\nPrevious Univision:\n\nPrevious Don and Roma Wade: 2004-10-30: Veteran Adelaide broadcaster Jeremy Cordeaux has retired from radio after a career that spanned 42 years, starting in 1963 on Sydney 2GB: He signed off with his customary \"believe in yourself\" in his final broadcast for news-talk 5DN.\n\nAmongst those who rang in to wish the host goodbye were Australian Prime Minister John Howard, South Australia Premier Mike Rann, who invited Cordeaux to become an ambassador for the state, and the host's son Saxon - who hosts an Adelaide community TV show - and 93-years-old mother. His daughter Amber joined him in the studio.\n\nCordeaux joined 5DN in 1976, also working on Channel 9 and 7 TV before moving to Sydney in 1990 just before 5DN converted to FM.\n\nHe returned to the city three years late to join Radio 1323, which was eventually renamed 5DN.\n\nIn 1996 he sold 5DN and 5AD-FM (now MIX 102.3) to the Australian Radio Network (ARN) for AUD 29 million (currently USD 21.7 million) but he told the Adelaide Advertiser did not rule out buying 5DN back if it was for sale at a good price.\n\n\"I'm emotionally connected to the place,\" he told the paper, which reported that the 59-years-old host is considering a future in advertising and television current affairs. \"In whatever capacity I will always serve and promote South Australia,\" added Cordeaux.\n\nPrevious ARN:\n\nPrevious Cordeaux:\n\nAdelaide Advertiser report: 2004-10-30: Fox News Channel TV and Westwood One syndicated radio host Bill O'Reilly has settled a sexual harassment case brought against him by his former producer Andrea Mackris.\n\nNo financial details were given of the settlement and all parties have agreed to keep details confidential.\n\nMackris had insisted that O'Reilly made explicit phone calls to her and told her about sexual fantasies involving her whilst O'Reilly had accused her and her lawyer Benedict Morelli of trying to extort USD 60 million from him.\n\nThe host said on his O'Reilly Factor show, \"This brutal ordeal is now officially over, and I will never speak of it again. This matter has caused enormous pain, but I had to protect my family, and I did. All I can say to you is please do not believe everything you hear and read.\"\n\nHe also said there was \"no wrongdoing in the case whatsoever by anyone.\"\n\nThe Washington Post speculates that in fact the settlement has involved payment of millions as insiders had the two sides were discussing an offer of well over USD 2 million when negotiations broke down.\n\nRNW comment: O'Reilly as a rather public pundit on sexual morality seems to us to have little credence in that area now although we suspect that, like Limbaugh's listeners, his audience won't be too worried about the morality involved: That, of course, in our view, also demeans them.\n\nOn a matter of public policy, however, it seems to us that at a certain stage in such cases, public interest demands that legal authorities should have and exercise the power to take over a case.\n\nHere there was either an attempt to extort a massive amount from the host - clearly a criminal matter if proven - or O'Reilly had in fact been involved in harassment. It would have been much better had a case of extortion been brought and, should it have been lost, the corollary had been a significant strengthening of a damages case against the host.\n\nThe current settlement tarnishes the parties and the law and yet again clearly indicates that justice in the US is frequently as much a matter of finances as of the rights and wrongs of the case involved.\n\nPrevious O'Reilly:\n\nWashington Post report: 2004-10-29: There has been another slew of strong radio results from North America although those from Viacom, the biggest company to report, went into the red as a result of a USD 1.5-billion charge related to its spinning off the Blockbuster video rental chain [RNW note:Blockbuster earlier this week posted a third-quarter loss of USD 1.42-billion after a USD 1.5 billion impairment. Without the impairment the black ink would have been USD 8 million compared to a profit a year earlier of USD 63.7 million.].\n\nViacom also announced a USD 8 billion stock buyback programme, significantly more than had been anticipated.\n\nAmongst those reporting - in alphabetical order- were:\n\nBeasley Broadcast Group reported third quarter net revenues up 8.2% to USD31.8 million and station operating income (SOI) up 13.2% to USD10.8 million: Net income was up 31.8% to USD4.1 million (17 cents per diluted share).\n\nFor the nine months to the end of September consolidated net revenue increased 7.8% to USD88.8 million, operating income from continuing operations rose 10.2% to USD21.0 million, SOI grew 8.7% to USD28.1 million from USD25.8 million.\n\nNet income was down to USD 8.1 million (33 cents per diluted share) compared to USD8.1 million (39 cents per diluted share) a year earlier: These figures reflected a 2004 USD2.4 million loss (6 cents, per diluted share) on the early extinguishment of long-term debt and 2003 gains of USD 4.5 million gain, or USD0.11 per diluted share on an after-tax basis, on the sale of investment securities and a USD1.4 million gain on the change in fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments.\n\nChairman and CEO George G. Beasley said, \"Our third consecutive quarter of revenue growth reflects continuing sales improvements at many of our market clusters and pockets of demand for radio advertising in certain regions of the country where we operate.\"\n\n\"Despite these improvements, the fourth quarter will be challenging due to the expected absence of several streams of revenue at our Miami cluster totalling approximately USD1.1 million, which existed during 2003 but will not occur in 2004, as well as the lingering effect of this year's hurricanes on demand for local advertising in Miami and Ft. Myers. Given these challenges, we plan to continue focusing on prudently managing costs and strengthening our balance sheet by using internally generated cash flow to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility.\"\n\n\"Additionally, we will continue to purchase shares from time to time in the open market, as we believe that, in addition to reducing debt, opportunistic share repurchases represent an excellent use of capital.\"\n\nFor the fourth quarter Beasley expects a net revenue decrease of approximately 2% compared to the same period in 2003.\n\nToronto-headquartered CHUM has reported fourth quarter profits nearly quadrupled over a year ago from CAD 2.03 million (USD 1.66 million - CAD 8 cents a share) to CAD 7.98 million (USD 6.53 million- CAD 29 cents a share) on revenues up 2.5% to CAD 130.8 million (USD 106.9 million).\n\nFor the full year, its profit was up 45.6% to CAD 37.03 million (USD 30.3 million - CAD 1.35 a share).\n\nCHUM notes a record performance from its radio division with revenues up 3.7% to CAD 122.8 million (USD 100.4 million) with TV revenues up 4% to CAD 427 million (USD 349 million): Radio EBITDA was up 21.7% to CAD 38.4 million (USD 31.4 million) whilst TV EBITDA was up 13.3% to CAD 68 million (USD 55.6 million).\n\nCox Radio reported net revenues for the third quarter up 4.2% to USD 117 million and net income up 0.5% to USD 18.36 million: For the first nine months net revenues were up 2.5% to USD 327 million and net income was up 8.3% to USD 49.7 million.\n\nPresident and CEO Robert F Neil said he was \"pleased with the performance of our company as a whole this quarter as we were able to outpace the revenue growth of both the industry as well as the markets in which we operate.\"\n\n\" Our revenue growth of 4.2% was solid and enabled us to deliver station operating income growth of 5.3% and a station operating income margin of almost 42%. We remain focused on executing our operating strategy, including investing in our station brands, building ratings and connecting with our listeners and advertisers at the local level.\"\n\n\"As we move into the fourth quarter of 2004, business remains erratic and visibility remains very difficult given the recent trend we've seen of business strengthening as each month comes to a close. While we are pleased to have this late business, it's proven to be rather unpredictable. As a result, we remain cautious in our guidance and expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter to be in the low single digits.\"\n\nJefferson-Pilot Communications said that in the third quarter its television and radio operations performed well with revenue up 12% on a year earlier and earnings up 19 % to USD13.5 million while broadcast cash flow grew 16 % to USD27.3 million from USD23.6 million for the quarter.\n\nFor the nine months, Communications' earnings were up 26 % to USD37.8 million from USD30.0 million, and broadcast cash flow grew 22 % to USD76.3 million from USD62.5 million.\n\nRegent Communications reported third quarter net broadcast revenues up 14.7% to USD 22.5 million, and net income nearly quadrupled - up from USD 2.1 million (5 cents a share) a year earlier to USD 8.1 million (18 cents a share): Excluding the effect of discontinued operations, net income for the quarter was up 38.9% to USD 2.5 million (6 cents a share). Same station net broadcast revenue for the third quarter of 2004 was up 4.4% to USD19.4\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, Regent net broadcast revenues increased 15.1% to USD62.1 million and net income was up from USD .4.2 million (9 cents s share) to USD 10.7 million (23 cents s share): Excluding the effect of discontinued operations net income was up 54.3% to USD 5,4 million (12 cents a share).\n\nRegent says it expects fourth quarter consolidated net broadcast revenues and station operating income of approximately USD21.9 to USD22.2 million and USD7.6 to USD7.8 million, respectively. Regent expects earnings per share to be USD0.04 for the fourth quarter of 2004.\n\nTerry Jacobs, Chairman and CEO of Regent Communications, commented, \"Our impressive performance this quarter highlights our success in implementing our strategy of building and nurturing leading local media franchises. Operating in middle and small-sized markets, we have continued to expand and strengthen our relationships with our listeners and advertisers. This local connection has always been the key ingredient to radio's success as an advertising platform and news and entertainment outlet. We are very confident and optimistic about the long-term outlook for our station group.\"\n\nSaga Communications reported net income for the quarter up 22.9% to USD 4.3 millions (20 cents per diluted share on net operating revenues up 12.6% to USD 34.3 million.\n\nSame station basis net operating revenue increased 6.7% to approximately USD32.5 million, and operating income increased 0.2% to approximately USD8.1 million.\n\nFor the nine months to the end of September, net income was up 24.5% to USD11.7 million (55 cents per fully diluted share) operating income increased 13.5% to approximately USD22.7 million add net operating revenue increased 11.5% to approximately USD98.6 million.\n\nOn a same station basis net operating revenue increased 6.1% to approximately USD93.7 million, and operating income increased 10.5% to approximately USD22.2 million.\n\nViacom revenues increased 4% to USD5.5 billion for the third quarter with overall advertising revenues growing 6% to USD3.1 billion. Third quarter 2004 operating income of USD1.34 billion increased 5% from USD1.28 billion in the same quarter last year, led by gains of 13% in Cable Networks, 7% in Television and 29% in Outdoor.\n\nOverall posted a third-quarter loss of USD487.6-million Thursday as its earnings were hit by a USD1.5-billion charge related to its separation from the Blockbuster video rental chain.\n\nFor the nine months to the end of September 30, 2004, revenues increased 9% to USD16.2 billion and operating income increased 13% to USD3.8 billion Net earnings from continuing operations for the nine-month period increased 25% to USD 2.1 billion, (18 cents per diluted share). Viacom notes that result for the nine-month included severance charges of USD56 million.\n\nChairman and CEO ,Sumner M.

It's important to listeners. We have to continue making these kind of programmes to make people go to the web.\"\n\nThe BBC has dramatised the last three Hitchhiker books - Life, The Universe And Everything; So Long and Thanks For All The Fish; and Mostly Harmless - as two new series, the second of which will be broadcast in May.\n\nAbramsky has also criticized part of the output of Radio 4, saying parts of the schedule were \"painful\" and said programming at times had been \"safe rather than innovative.\"\n\n\"There have been times when some programming has not been good enough. Some of the quizzes on Radio 4 have been painful,\" she said.\n\nThe paper says that Abramsky later tried to qualify the remarks saying they referred to shows in the 1980s and newly-edited Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer said parts of the schedule had become \"cosy\" although he added there would be no dramatic changes [RNW comment: A wise move in view of the controversy former Radio 4 controller James Boyle attracted when he shook up the service.]\n\n\"Radio 4 is not a museum.

Dean of Pensacola had traced an unauthorized station to his property and issued a warning about unlicensed operation after they were asked if they had a search warrant and then refused access.\n\nDean had argued that he was not given an opportunity or hearing to defend himself, that the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction, that the agents trespassed on his property and refused to leave when requested to do so, that there was no evidence he operated the equipment and that issuing a fine to a citizen for \"refusing to waive a constitutional right could be construed as unlawful punitive retaliation.\"\n\nThe Commission said the agents had merely knocked on Dean's door and asked to inspect the station, that his argument that someone else could have been operating the station was negated since he was in charge of the property and transmissions had ceased soon after the agents left, and that issuing the fine for operating a radio station without a license had no constitutional implications but simply represented enforcement of the law. It confirmed the full penalty.\n\nPrevious FCC: 2004-10-29: The BBC has rejected claims from DJ Andy Kershaw that his mentor and late colleague John Peel was \"worn out\" and had felt marginalized by the corporation before his death from a heart attack this week.\n\nKershaw, a former Radio 1 DJ who now hosts a world music programme on BBC Radio 3, said he had urged Peel to cut back his ours and told BBC Radio 4 Peel had said to him, \"'They have put my programme back further into the night and I feel marginalized. It's killing me.\"\n\nKershaw added, \"The last time I saw him he looked absolutely worn out. We went to a café near Radio 1 and I said, 'John, you look terrible.'\"\n\nUntil July Peel's show had been aired Tuesdays through Thursdays from 22:00 to midnight but was then moved back an hour to start at 23:00. He had rejected the idea of pre-recording the first two shows - the third was normally broadcast from his home in Suffolk.\n\nAlthough Peel's autobiography may not now be published (See RNW Oct 28) his estate could potentially benefit greatly from the record collection he had put together over the years.\n\nAccording to the UK Daily Mirror, quoting his manager Clive Selwood, a US radio company has already offered more than GBP 1 million (USD 1.8 million) for the collections and the British Library has also expressed interest.\n\n\"There are tens of thousands of records. It's got all his annotations on it - three asterisks meant the record must be played,\" the paper quoted him as saying. \"He had to extend his house in Suffolk to hold them all.\"\n\nThe BBC is

one of them in part, from eleven appeals that it considered: Ten of them concerned matters of fairness and accuracy and one, an upheld TV complaints matters of taste and decency relating to an experimental comedy and comments about Jesus Christ and Christianity.\n\nThe other two complaints upheld both involved radio with another three radio and five TV complaints not upheld.\n\nUpheld was a complaint against the Jon Gaunt Show on BBC Radio London in which the presenter, in relation to an incident in which two Greenpeace protesters had scales Big Ben.\n\nThe incident sparked security concerns and on his show Gaunt put forward the view that the protesters should have been warned to come down and then shot if they ignored the warnings.\n\nA complainant had called the remarks \"incredibly irresponsible\" and also complained about the way in which Gaunt dealt with a police officer who called the show.\n\nThe BBC's Head of Programme Complaints had already upheld the latter element of the complaint but did not uphold the complaint against the remarks that he held were \"were designed to promote discussion by putting forward extreme views.\"\n\nThe Complaints panel in upholding the complaint said that such extreme views should have been posed as rhetorical questions to provoke debate and concluded that it was unacceptable for a BBC presenter to express the personal view that the police should have shot at the protesters.\n\nPartially upheld was a complaint concerning an interview about the airship R100 in a Making History programme on BBC Radio 4 and the Head of Programme Complaints had already upheld complaints relating to inaccuracy in saying that the R100 was designed by Dennistoun Burney when in fact it was designed by Barnes Wallis but not another complaint relating to the degree of innovation in the design.\n\nThe appeals panel said it regretted that the Programme Complaints Unit had not drawn on a wider range of expertise in rejecting the comment but had simply returned to the original contributor for his comment and found that there was sufficient evidence that the programme had \"not accurately reflected the significant degree of originality in the R100 design.\"\n\nRegarding a further complaint about the \"rippling\" of the R100 outer covering it found that this contributed to the dissatisfaction with the report but did not raise significant issues of accuracy and upheld only the part of the complaint relating to originality in design.\n\nPrevious BBC:\n\nPrevious BBC Complaints Bulletin (Governor's Appeals):\n\nPrevious

again showed revenues growing strongly but losses also up.\n\nSirius says it had 662,289 subscribers at the end of September and is on target for a million by the end of the year: Its revenues increased from USD 4.3 million a year ago to USD 19.1 million and its adjusted loss from operations was up by USD 48.1 million to USD 125.7 million driven by increased subscriber acquisition costs.\n\nOverall Sirius had a net loss applicable to common shareholders of USD 169.4 million (14 cents a share) compared to a loss of USD 106.7 (11 cents a share) a year ago.\n\nDuring the quarter Sirius added 103,979 net subscribers from the retail channel, a 28% increase from the previous quarter and 75,659 net subscribers from its automotive, trucking and boating relationships, a 59% increase over the second quarter of 2004.\n\nCEO Joseph P Clayton said the company's \" progress during the third quarter was excellent, and these figures testify to this.\"\n\n\"With the introduction of exciting next generation products, more traction from our automotive channel, and our programming initiatives, such as the NFL, Eminem, and Maxim, you can feel the momentum building for SIRIUS,\"

He moved to KMEN-AM in San Bernardino in 1966 and a year later became a DJ on the pirate ship Radio London, where he took the name John Peel where he hosted a late night show The Perfumed Gardenand was the first to air the Beatles Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nWhen the pirates were outlawed he was one of the inaugural intake of DJs at the new BBC pop station Radio 1 where he initially presented the weekend Top Gea\" show and later in partnership with the late John Walters a regular weekday show.\n\nHe managed to survive at Radio 1, where has was until his death still hosting a late-night show three nights a week - Tuesdays through Thursdays - as well as, since 1998, a weekly tit-bits compendium Home Truths on BBC Radio 4 and also World Service shows.\n\nIn 2002 he was awarded the Sony Gold to mark his outstanding contribution to radio over 35 years of broadcasting.\n\nTributes were paid from figure sranging from British Prime Minister Tony Blair who said he was \"an extraordinary and unique personality\" through BBC director General Mark Thompson who described him as \"one of the giants of radio and will be missed, not just by everyone at the BBC, but by millions of listeners of all ages\" to fellow DJs and members of bands he had helped.\n\nThese ranged from groups such as the Small Faces and Pink Floyd in his early days, punk notables such as the Ramones, The Clash and the Sex Pistols, and played reggae and hip-hop groups whose music he introduced to many Britons.\n\nWhen Radio One announced his death it played The Undertones' Teenage Kicks, one of his favourite songs, followed by tracks from the White Stripes and the Strokes - two other groupts in the revival in guitar-based indie music that Peel was very much associated with.\n\nUndertones bass player, Michael Bradley, told the BBC Peel's death had robbed radio and the music industry of one of its greatest voices and added, \"He was a very funny, very warm man and we will always be grateful for what he did for The Undertones.\"\n\nTributes were also paid by members of many other bands including Blur, The Manic Street Preachers, New Order, Radiohead, The Smiths, and Supergrass - whose debut single Caught By The Fuzz was first played on radio by Peel,\n\nFellow BBC Radio One DJ Jo Whiley, who presented coverage of the Glastonbury Festival with Peel, said, \"John was simply one of my favourite men in the whole world - as a music fan and presenter he was simply an inspiration.\"\n\nRadio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said Peel's contribution to modern music and culture was \"immeasurable\" and added, \" \"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to John knowing that he really cared. \"\n\n\"His commitment and passion for new music only grew stronger over the years. In fact, when I last saw him he was engaged in a lively debate with his fellow DJs over the state of new music today.\"\n\nPrevious BBC:\n\nPrevious Thompson:\n\nPrevious Parfitt:\n\nPrevious Peel:\n\nPrevious Whiley:\n\nBBC News report: 2004-10-27: In Mexico, Grupo Radio Centro, which owns 14 stations, has reported third quarter broadcasting revenues running to the end of September down 29% on a year earlier to MXN 133.3 million (USD 11.6 million).\n\nBroadcasting expenses were also down - by 30.4% to MXN 94.6 million (USD 8.2 million) and broadcasting income was down 25.5% to MXN 38.7 million (USD 3.37 million).\n\nIt puts most of the decrease down to the ending of its broadcasting of news from Infored (See RNW Mar 4) but the costs savings more than outweighed revenue losses leading to an operating income increase of 7.9% to MXN 11,8 million (USD 1.03 million).\n\nOverall Grupo Radio reduced its net loss for the quarter to MXN 5.64 million (USD 490,000) from MXN 13.88 million (USD 1.2 million)\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, Grupo Radio has reported revenues down 43.6% on a year earlier to MXN 366.6 million (USD 31.88 million (as the revenue fall out from losing Infored was compounded by the absence of political advertising revenues from congressional elections that boosted its results a year ago.\n\nExpenses were down 23.8% but still left broadcasting income down 73% to MXN 70.87 million (USD 6.26 million) and an overall loss of MXN 68.9 million (USD 6.0 million) compared to net income of MXN 50.6 million (USD 4.4 million) a year earlier.\n\nPrevious Grupo Radio: 2004-10-27: Grokster founder Daniel Rung of Palm Springs, his brother Michael Rung, his son Matthew Rung and former Grokster President Wayne Rosso, have settled a piracy lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIt says that the men are to pay damages totalling USD 500,000 and in addition Sakfield Holding Co., the Spanish company the Rungs created to operate the Puretunes web site, has been ordered to pay USD 10 million although the paper comments that collection will be difficult because the site was closed down after operating for only a few weeks.\n\nPuretunes sold MP3s of songs at a cheap rate - unlimited downloads for as little as 83 cents a day - but did not obtain licences from either the recording companies or the Spanish associations of music publishers and performing artists that its lawyer said was all they were required to obtain under Spanish law.\n\nInvestigators said the Rungs, created an elaborate web of companies in various countries to conceal their ownership of Puretunes and Sakfield Holdings but were traced through it service providers and computers, which were based in North America.\n\nIt sold some 2 million downloads in its short time of operation according to the recording companies and RIAA president Cary Sherman said it \"duped consumers by claiming it was a legitimate online music retailer when, in fact, it was no such thing.\"\n\nPrevious RIAA:\n\nPrevious Sherman:\n\nLos Angeles Times report: 2004-10-27: XM satellite radio in conjunction with Delphi has introduced a portable version of its satellite radio that is due in stores in December and that it hopes will create a demand for it beyond its primary mobile market of vehicle owners.\n\nThe XM2GO receiver will cost USD 350: it weighs 7.3 ounces (210 grams) and includes a hard drive for pausing and recording up to five hours of transmissions, had up to 30-presets and has a rechargeable battery. Standard accessories include headphones and a remote control.\n\nLike rival Sirius satellite radio's smallest receiver, the Xact XTR1 \"Stream Jockey\", the MyFi has a built in FM transmitter enabling its signal to be received by a standard FM tuner but the Sirius product, which costs USD 149 including car kit, does not have its own battery, hard drive facility, or built-in antenna.\n\nOn the automobile receiver front, Sirius has also announced that it is to supply an interior windshield-mounted antenna, the SIGMA, developed in conjunction with RecepTec, plus factory-options for its system with the Mercedes-Benz SLK350 Roadster, 2006 BMW 3 Series starting in the Summer of 2005 and as a dealer-installed option in four 2005 model year Volvos\n\nIn the UK, a number of new digital audio receivers have been announced in advance of the Christmas shopping season.\n\nThey include the GBP 100 (USD 180) Pure Evoke-1XT DAB digital radio, an enhanced follow-up to the company's Evoke-1 that adds facilities such as a countdown times for kitchen use and a USB connector for updates; a GBP 200 (USD 360) portable Revo system that can be used in conjunction with a battery and headphones kit (an extra GBP 50, US D 80), in an automobile or with a home audio system; and a new range of M&G DAB radios that include the facility to recoin MP3 format on to internal memory or flash-memory cards..\n\nPrevious Sirius:\n\nPrevious XM: 2004-10-27: Salem has announced yet another acquisition. It is paying USD 10 million for Grace University's Christian station KGBI-FM, Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nCommenting o the deal, Salem president and CEO Edward G. Atsinger III said the company was \"pleased to have the opportunity to acquire KGBI-FM, a strong heritage Christian station in a growing market like Omaha, where we previously have not had a station presence.\"\n\n\"We look forward to continuing Grace University's tradition of public service to the greater Omaha community with Salem's distinctive Christian and public affairs programming,\" he added.\n\nGrace has operated the station since 1966 and its president President Dr. Jim Eckman said the sale achieves two primary University objectives, \"a strategic and tactical decision to focus the University's resources on higher education which is both our core competency and our central mission\" and \"the continuation of high-quality Christian radio for KGBI listeners in Omaha and surrounding communities.\"\n\nPrevious Atsinger:\n\nPrevious Salem: 2004-10-26: MobilTrak Inc. of Phoenix has set up in the Washington, DC, area a trial of its system that monitors which channels car drivers are listening to so that advertisers can better target their adverts.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that so far the company has put its devices in 14 locations and plans to add them in eight more: The system works by picking up the faint signals that car antennas emit and the solar-powered units can handle signals across six lanes of traffic from cars up to 140 feet away in the same way.\n\nThe information is not linked to individual vehicles at the moment and so is not causing serious privacy concerns although there are worries about its potential.\n\nBarry Steinhardt, director of the technology and liberty program at the American Civil Liberties Union told the paper, \"It would be a quick leap to connect that data with other data. Technology is moving at the speed of light. We've reached a point where there are few technological bars to doing anything.\"\n\nThe Post says that amongst advertisers most interested in the system are auto deals who expect to make most sales to people near their dealerships.\n\nJim Giddings, general manager of a dealers in Woodbridge, told the paper his dealership, which spends USD 90,000 a month on advertising, had until recently been spending USD 25,000 of that on a talk station and another on a contemporary music station that his advertising agency had recommended after examining Arbitron ratings.\n\nWhen he signed on with MobilTrak two months ago he found that Arbitron's top two stations didn't even rank in the top 10 for in-car radio listeners driving past his dealership and he shifted his budget, allotting the most money to a news show and a contemporary music station identified as popular by MobilTrak.\n\n\"It was a real eye-opener,\" he said but he reserved judgment on whether the changer is attracting more customers. \"I don't know yet,\" he said. \"I'll have a better idea 90 days from now maybe.\"\n\nResponding to a query about the differences, Arbitron spokesman Thom Mocarsky described MobilTrak as \"complementary\" to Arbitron's services and commented, \"MobilTrak tells you what your selection of stations should be but it doesn't tell you how many people you are reaching and what you should pay for it. The station with the biggest audience is not necessarily the best buy for a particular advertiser.\"\n\nThe system is also attracting interest from radio companies and Clear Channel and Infinity are trying it in the Washington area.\n\nBennett Zier, Clear Channel's vice president for the Washington-Baltimore area commented that if it shows his company's show a following for its stations in a particular area \"that's a chance for me to show all the retailers there that we're a good investment.\"\n\nInfinity SVP Michael Hughes singled out the speedy response as of value and cited information provided the day after a broadcast on listeners to a Washington Redskins game on WJFK-FM.\n\nHe said he knew the information was limited but added, \"Media these days is about immediacy. And to have immediate measurement is very attractive.\"\n\nMobilTrak was founded in Alabama in 1998 by Jim Christian, who once owned the software firm TapScan, which interpreted ratings from radio and TV stations and was sold to Arbitron in 1998.\n\nIt has been involved in other projects such as electronic billboards that could display a message tailored to profiles of typical listeners to particular stations (See RNW Dec 26, 2002) and also operates in Seattle, Los Angeles, New Jersey and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nIn April this year C. David Boice, its managing partner, in conjunction with his father Craig Boice, and partner Kevin Gallagher took an 80% interest in the company selling a Virginia software company they owned and have now boosted their marketing efforts.\n\nRNW comment: Although at first glance Arbitron's Portable People Meter (PPM) and the Radiocontrol wristwatch device that identifies the signals a wearer is listening to might seem to cover some of the same ground as MobilTrak, there are significant differences, the prime one of which is that MobilTrak picks up aggregate information on what is tuned to without requiring individual participation.\n\nThe other devices produce more detailed information as to what individuals are listening and thus allow calculation from the sample but this is, as Arbitron said, complementary information.\n\nPrevious Arbitron:\n\nPrevious Clear Channel:\n\nPrevious Viacom-CBS-Infinity:\n\nWashington Post report: 2004-10-26: Six times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong is to host his own show on Sirius satellite radio.\n\nThe cyclist, who in addition to his sporting prowess has conquered cancer, founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation that helps to fight it; the foundation has sold more than 18 million yellow Livestrong bracelets at a dollar apiece.\n\nArmstrong's show, which has yet to be named, will debut later this year on Sirius Faction, a music channel created especially for action and outdoor sports enthusiasts.\n\nSirius President of Entertainment and Sports Scott Greenstein commented, \"Lance Armstrong is arguably the greatest, most inspirational athlete and humanitarian in the sporting world. His accomplishments both as a cyclist, a two-time best-selling author and as founder of the Lance Armstrong Foundation are unparalleled.\"\n\nArmstrong added, \"Sirius has already gathered an amazing group of sports heroes for the Faction channel, and I'm honoured to be included among them. Each week, I'll share some of my experiences, speak with listeners, bring on special guests, and most importantly play some of my favourite music.\"\n\nPrevious Sirius: 2004-10-26: Veteran Canadian broadcaster Jeremy Brown who worked for Standard Radio's CFRB-AM, Toronto, for 29 years and retired in 1996 has died aged 74.\n\nFor a period in the 1980s he was broadcasting two entertainment commentaries a day for the station and also a daily City Comment essay for sister-station CKFM: He moved briefly at the end of the 80s to CJEZ-FM but then returned to CFRB and after his retirement worked for a while at Toronto classical station CFMX-FM.\n\n2004-10-26: Air America is now on the air in Seattle on Infinity's former classic country station KYCW-AM, which had been re--branded KPTK.\n\nKPTK has a 50,000 watt signal that covers an area from around Centralia to the south to the Canadian border to the north whereas most of its affiliates are much less powerful- only in Denver and Miami does it have a powerful signal.\n\nAir America president Jon Sinton told the Puget Sound Business Journal that it had taken time to get into the market because the company had been concentrating on major markets first, commenting, \"The top 10 markets are really critical, but that's not to say if someone had raised their hand in Seattle and said we've got to have you, we wouldn't have been on the air in Seattle.\"\n\nSeattle is known as a Democrat-leaning city and Dave McDonald, senior vice president and market manager at Infinity Radio Seattle, said they felt they'd \" be able to generate more audience with the new format,\" adding, \"The liberal view has been underrepresented in talk radio and there seems to be a great deal of interest in it.\"\n\nAir America says on its web site that it now has 36 affiliates: These are said to be able to reach some 40% of the US population.\n\nPrevious Piquant/Air America:\n\nPrevious Sinton:\n\nPrevious Viacom-CBS-Infinity:\n\nPuget Sound Business Journal report: 2004-10-25: For our look at print cover of radio this week we couldn't resist a radio review of a weekly programme from Finland, which is also on the internet: It came in the UK Sunday Times and Roland White who said it was his \"plan this week, as a change from the normal service, to seek out bizarre and unusual radio programmes from around the world.\"\n\n\"Well, that was my plan,\" he continued. \"Unfortunately, I could find only one in the time allotted. It's such a cracker, though, that I'm going to devote the entire column to it. I might even, if the facts are flagging a little towards the end, use this one small, foreign programme to draw a series of outrageous and unsustainable conclusions about British radio.\"\n\n\" What caught my imagination was a Finnish station that broadcasts a regular news service in classical Latin, an idea of outstanding eccentricity.\"\n\n\"The bulletins themselves sound like a Scandinavian satirist trying to perfect her impression of the Pope, but there are apparently thousands of listeners in Finland, not to mention an audience of Latin students in 50 countries who listen on short wave and the internet.\"\n\nWhite also comments on the nature of the programme, which began some 13 years ago with a feature that proved so popular that a decision was made to broadcast a regular Latin feature and also writes, \"You might also be thinking that Latin is not a suitable language for the hurly-burly of modern news, but in fact it is particularly suited to the current world situation.\"\n\n\"As anybody with the smallest experience of beginner's Latin will tell you, the Romans enjoyed nothing better than laying waste to their enemies, particularly the Carthaginians. So headlines such as 'Nulla in Iraquia arma interneciva' - no weapons of mass destruction (literally 'weapons of massacre') in Iraq - pose no translation difficulty.\"\n\nAnd as he concludes with relation to British radio, \"It's difficult to imagine anything quite as eccentric appearing on Radio 4, but who knows? Et nunc in Radio Quattuor, Sagittarii - an everyday story of country folk.[A rererence to the BBC Radio 4 Archers soap opera]\"\n\nNot as strange as a Latin bulletin but odd nevertheless is the idea in the US of what might be termed thoughtful conservative talk radio but that according to a report from Nathaniel Popper in Forward is what telecom mogul Howard Jonas, the founder of IDT Corporation, is pushing.\n\nJonas is aiming to useWMET-AM, Washington, D.C., that his company has bought as a launching pad for building a national network of conservative talk stations with a style more akin to that of NPR than Rush Limbaugh or Michael Savage.\n\n\"The problem,\" Jonas told the paper, \"is that I have no choice but to listen to [National Public Radio] even though it's full of pro-Palestinian propaganda, anti-Americanism and is definitely socialist in its outlook.\" [RNW note: To put those comments in context it should be borne in mind that Jonas is well known for his work for Republican and Orthodox Jewish causes and was vice chair of the recent Republican National Convention.]\n\nHe says he respects the success of the shock jocks and conservative talk hosts but adds, \"anybody who listens to Rush [Limbaugh] or Howard Stern is either unintelligent or needs to turn off their intelligence during the time they're listening.\"\n\nHis programming according to his advertising is going to be \"engaging, not raging\" but its perspective is certainly going to be partisan: The morning programming is hosted by Linda Chavez, a former adviser to Ronald Reagan, the afternoon is hosted by controversial Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach and William Kristol editor of the neoconservative Weekly Standard magazine supplies a daily news analysis and the station is developing a Sunday show for him and conservative Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer.\n\nJonas commented, \"We are not ashamed of values. They are going to come out.\"\n\nJonas has made serious attempts to purchase other stations towards building a network but, reports the paper, insiders think he faces an uphill struggle.\n\n\"There's a lot of competition in talk, and there's a lot of people who try it,\" said Robert Unmacht, a partner with iN3 Partners, a media consulting firm. \"History has shown us a lot of failed talk networks.\"\n\nUnmacht was also dubious about the basic conception of the show, saying, \"He's going to have to come up with a more exciting line-up of characters. Viewpoints come second. First you have to find someone people want to listen to.\"\n\nTom Taylor, editor of Inside Radio, said Jonas and WMET have the strength of a coherent philosophy and \"the bank roll\" to make things happen but concluded, \"It's not just a money-making proposition.\"\n\nRNW comment: Forward also notes that Salem is also a competitor for a similar market and we'd guess that its Christian orientation probably won't make the output that dissimilar, so we'd share the doubts about Jonas's likelihood of success.\n\nWe also remember many years ago, before satellite distribution that an attempt by Adolf Coors to build up a conservative TV news network failed despite significant financial backing. Unlike Salem and Murdoch with the Fox network, there were no other media resources and comparatively little media experience to sustain them but the comparative cost of radio may yet mean that Jonas can keep going. We doubt, however, that he'll make much money from the venture.\n\nNot mentioned as a possible competitor by Forward is satellite radio although the defection of Howard Stern when his current terrestrial contract expires has certainly put the matter on the agenda for many.\n\nSatellite, however, is already competing for talk radio audiences with a wide spectrum of programming on both Sirius and XM.\n\nThe latter stole a march on its rival with the hiring of former National Public Radio (NPR) Morning Edition host Bob Edwards to run his own show on its public radio channel but according to Steve Johnson in the Chicago Tribune, although Edwards is doing well for XM, Morning Edition is also, to quote Johnson \"retaining its stranglehold on those people who seek information in depth in the mornings -- people not unlike Edwards.\"\n\nThe article then quotes Edwards himself:\" \"It's still the best news program on radio. I said people should continue to listen to `Morning Edition' and then come over and listen to me after.\"\n\nThere is caution still, however, whether the protests over Edwards departure may have had an effect on the show's support and, although, as Johnson asks,\" where else are they going to go?\" some in public radio are not yet completely ruling out any possible long-term effects.\n\nJohnson notes that the audience is only down a little - from 13.07 million to 12.87 million a week according to NPR - and this could be due to what's actually been happening in the world.\n\nTorey Malatia, general manager of Chicago public radio station WBEZ-FM, said dire threats of loss of support had fallen off and added, \"My guess is it won't have an impact on our upcoming November drive.\"\n\nAnd as for the show, now hosted by Steve Inskeep and Renee Montagne in Washington and Los Angeles respectively? Although program directors at a number of NPR affiliates have said they're fans of the new hosts, Malatia was measured in his judgment. \"The new hosts are fine. Bob was fine,\" he said. \"There's no particular advantage to the change from Bob to Steve and Renee, and I think the two-city thing has minimum interest and impact.\n\nFor Edwards the change seems to have been a plus and although he says he \"still making public-radio money\" he added, \"Radio is fun again. Why? The fact that it's something new in a shop that is relatively new. The fact that everyone here is just so radio. The fact that I got to pick this little staff of eight. They're all old friends from public radio.\"\n\nJohnson says Edwards's show, made up of Edwards and guests, \"mostly works, although, even with the first interview relating to the news, a listener can feel the absence of that firm grounding that newscasts and a stable of correspondents give a show.\"\n\nHe also notes that, whilst not becoming a Stern, the absence of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation does give Edwards more freedom as for example accurately quoting profanities from the late President Johnson in an interview about the former president.\n\nAnd still with satellite radio, praise from Pennsylvania and Lara Brenckle in Centre Daily from Pennsylvania State College. When her boyfriend bought XM her first reaction was that \"he'd been swayed, like most men, by the latest electronic gadget.\"\n\nThe programming it would appear speedily changed her mind - she is now a subscriber - and she comments on the reasons:\" Commercial radio has become intolerable Adults, especially those in the coveted 18- to 34-year-old demographic, want to be treated like adults. We want music that doesn't suck stuck on an endless spin cycle. We actually like to experiment with music from different cultures and hear stories you won't find in mainstream media . We want news that's not interrupted by a sales pitch. And yes, we like our comedians to swear. We are not fooled by the bleeps and cuts.\"\n\n\"The only people I feel sorry for in this whole debate are the guys and gals on commercial radio. They're just looking to keep a job in a field they love. They can't help the rules set by everyone from their bosses to the FCC about what they can and can't do. They're just the mouthpiece, and they do what they're told with as much creativity, fun and silliness as they're permitted.\"\n\nOn then, to some picks for listening that is still available via the Internet.\n\nFirst courtesy of BBC Radio 4 is Good Vibrations, a programme that aired last Tuesday (on the Listen Again part of the web site) that tells the history of the theremin, the hands-off instrument named its inventor Leon Theremin (Lev Sergeivitch Termen), who was born in St Petersburg in 1896 and who patented the device in 1921- his US patent came some seven years later and the machine was made and distributed by RCA during the 30s although it was not commercially successful.\n\nA machine was presented to Lenin in 1924 - for use as a burglar alarm although Lenin was impressed enough to take some lessons in playing it and commission 600 machines - and in the same year Theremin began public performances of his \"'ether-wave music\".\n\nThe programme combines the story of the instrument and a complex life that included a time as an industrial espionage agent in the USA and a spell in a Soviet labour camp in Siberia and inventing the electronic \"bug\" as well as an instrument probably best known for its use in the Beach Boys' Good Vibrations and science fiction movies such as The Day the Earth Stood Still and indeed in part of the original Star Trek opening theme.\n\nStill with music, but moving to BBC Radio 2, this Wednesday (21:00 GMT) sees the third episode of Don't Look Back in Anger, a four part history of Britpop (the second episode is still on the site for now) and the same channel on Friday (18:00 GMT) has the second of Fascinating Rhythms, a six-part series of George Gershwin.\n\nAnd for music from different roots BBC Radio 3's Sunday Feature last week (again available via Listen Again) was You Dance Because You Have To, the story of how Katherine Dunham travelled to Haiti and the Caribbean, and Pearl Primus' to Africa and then returned to re-invigorate the tradition of African dance into a US where it had become watered down in minstrel shows and vaudeville.\n\nFor the more serious BBC Radio 4 on Saturday investigated the phenomenon of a book recently cited by George W. Bush as the most influential book he had ever read - The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\n\nFor a different perspective on the Bush family and a wider perspective on US politics we'd suggest a dip into the US National Public Radio site that is currently carrying Presidential Conversations on the Constitution, a series of conversations by NPR Senior News Analyst Cokie Roberts with former presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, a George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe latter is particularly revealing on the matter of the power to declare war and also on the way separation of powers worked in a situation where he had to work with a Democratic Congress, specifically in relation to taxes.\n\nOn to comedy and first with a bite we'd continue to recommend the News Quiz from BBC Radio 4 (Fridays at 17:30 GMT with a Saturday lunchtime repeat) and for those who appreciate dogs a dip into About a Dog: The last whimsical edition of this three-part series ran on Radio 4 last Wednesday.\n\nWe'd also suggest last week's Woman's Hour drama (available for a week so the first story dies today on the site): Community Flock by Richard Monks is based on the idea of keeping a flock of sheep on a green in London but is also fairly strong in its observations about humans.\n\nFor those with a religious cum historical bent, try Radio 4 tonight at 19:00 GMT when in The First Christian Document? Oxford academic, Alan Jarrow claims to have identified the record of crisis meeting in Jerusalem at which St Paul persuaded Jesus's Disciples that you didn't have to become a Jew to be a Christian.\n\nStill with history but this time of a much more recent provenance in The Secret Life of Phone Numbers Ian Peacock looks at the way in which the phone system developed in the UK.\n\nPrevious Columnists:\n\nPrevious Inskeep:\n\nPrevious Johnson:\n\nPrevious White:\n\nCentre Daily - Brenckle:\n\nChicago Tribune - Johnson:\n\nFinnish Radio web site:\n\nForward - Popper:\n\nUK Sunday Times - White: 2004-10-25: A feature in the New York Times on Opie and Anthony's (Anthony Cumia and Gregg Hughes) show on XM satellite radio not only looks at the way the duo are restraining themselves now they have been freed of the constraints of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations that in their case contributed to their firing by Infinity but also gives a tiny glimpse into the finances of their move.\n\nAlthough XM executive vice president of programming Eric Logan declined to say how many subscribers the duo had attracted - their show costs an extra USD 1.99 a month over and above the standard USD 9.999 monthly subscription - he said the show was becoming popular and emphasized that XM expected to reach 20 million subscribers by 2010.\n\nAlthough the hosts skirted mentions of Howard Stern who is moving to Sirius in 15 months on a USD 500 million five-year deal - which would mean they need to attract some 4 million subscribers to match his costs - they are going to come under increased pressure after his move and suggests the Times this may put them under increasing pressure to shock.\n\nThe pair say they hate being called shock-jocks and say they're out to do more than just shock, which poses its own problems when the main restrains are their own sense of what is permissible.\n\n\"That's what scared us,\" said Cumia said, \"because Anthony and I were trying to prove to them and everybody else out there that, 'Look, we're not shock jocks.' We hated that term. We do so much more than that.\"\n\nLogan commented of the show, \"I think what they're popular for is a unique kind of content that we realize is not for everybody, but there is a market for it.\"\n\nAnd the content not for everybody? The Times reports that a recent show was featuring a comedy segment \"Guess What's in My Pants\" in which a caller and her husband had agreed to have sex so the show's listeners could eavesdrop and one recent show included \"comedy\" items \"mocking mentally retarded and gay people, debating women's anatomy and making racist remarks, ostensibly as a way to make fun of racists or political correctness or both.\"\n\nIn addition to this - and the Times notes they could have done most of it \"(very carefully, with euphemisms) on public airwaves - the report says \"they were able to read verbatim, and to great comic effect, from the obscenity-laced lawsuit accusing the Fox television host Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, to have an old regular, the comic songwriter Stephen Lynch, perform a song called \"Craig Christ,\" about Jesus' little-known reprobate brother, which probably would have got them fired by the third stanza on regular radio, and to recite all seven of the words that George Carlin once identified as the ones you could never say on television.\"\n\nDespite this the duo have been avoiding swearing - Opie said this \"takes away from what we are, which is a very funny, clever, entertaining show \" and Anthony added that they were rationing the shock.\n\n\"There's \"a shocking element to the show,\" he allowed, \"but it's what we call the attention-getter. It's to get people in, to get people to spread the word. Then once they're in, now they're listening to a show that sounds like a discussion between their friends, of guys talking about guy things.\"\n\nRNW comment: The Times says these \"guy things \" mean, \"if their first shows are an indication, chiefly pornography, body odours, bodily functions, celebrities, sports, politics and having sex with prostitutes.\" We will leave further evaluation of how typical this is of the US male - and presumably subscription figures for the show and listening to Stern will eventually give a reasonable idea - to others but if it is other than a fairly small minority the combination of them and listeners to Limbaugh et al would indicate a somewhat deficient nation in our view both as regards knowledge and breadth of interests.\n\nPrevious Opie and Anthony:\n\nPrevious Stern:\n\nPrevious Sirius:\n\nPrevious XM:\n\nNew York Times report: 2004-10-24: Last week saw a steady run of activity from the regulators albeit without any major decisions.\n\nIn Australia, the main announcement from the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) was to invite applications for 68 open narrowcasting radio services to serve locations in New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia.\n\nEach licence will be sold via an auction-style allocation to the highest bidder in cases where there are competing applications and the reserve of AUD 4,000 (USD 3,000) applying should there only be a single bid.\n\nThe ABA has also allocated a new community licence for Gifford, New South Wales to Gosford Christian Broadcasters Limited, which was competing against applications from Radio Yesteryear Incorporated, which focused on people aged 40 to 70 and people who enjoy nostalgia music, and Gosford Progressive Community Radio Incorporated (PCR), which targeted minority groups, principally ethnic and youth.\n\nActing ABA Chair Lyn Maddock said of the award, \"The ABA considered that the non-denominational Christian service proposed by Gosford Christian Broadcasters, targeting the general Christian community in Gosford, would meet the needs of the community in the Gosford licence area to a greater extent than the services proposed by the other two applicants.\"\n\n\"Currently, there is no full time Christian broadcasting service based in the Gosford licence area. Gosford Christian Broadcasters demonstrated that there is a need for its proposed service in the area.\"\n\nThe ABA has also varied the Bourke radio licence area plan to make available FM channel capacity for community radio service 2CUZ Bourke at Goodooga, Lightning Ridge, Walgett and Weilmoringle, all within the 2CUZ licence area, and the removal of channel capacity for an unallocated open narrowcasting service at Walgett.\n\nIt opted, however, not to extend the licence area of community radio service 2WEB Bourke to include the township of Cunnamulla, Queensland, which is 228 km away across a state border, saying that the distance reduced the practicality of Cunnamulla residents participating in the operations of 2WEB and noting that strong objections were raised in submissions from the licensees of 4VL, Charleville, and the Rebel Radio Network.\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), was involved in a number of licence amendments: In order of province, they included:\n\nAlberta:\n\nApproval of frequency change for CKIS-FM-1 Banff (formerly CHRK-FM-1 Banff) and change of contours by decreasing the effective radiated power from 200 watts to 25 watts.\n\nApproval of contour change for transmitter CKLM-FM-1 Bonnyville, by decreasing the antenna height from 148.2 metres to 121.9 metres.\n\nApproval of contour change for transmitter CKUA-FM-6 Red Deer, by increasing the antenna height from 195 metres to 224.1 metres.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador:\n\nApproval of contour change for transmitter VOAR-12-FM, Wabush, linked to relocation and decrease of antenna height from 29 metres to 13 metres.\n\nApproval of application by Paradise Broadcasting Corporation for an extension of the time limit to commence the operation of the developmental community FM in Paradise.\n\nOntario:\n\nApproval of contour changes for new Ethnic AM in Toronto linked to transmitter relocation.\n\nQuebec:\n\nApproval of contour change for transmitter CBMT-1, Trois-Rivières, related to power increase from 14,000 watts to 15,200 watts.\n\nSaskatchewan:\n\nApproval of contour change for CFVZ-FM Moose Jaw linked to transmitter location and increase in antenna height.\n\nIn Ireland, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) announced that it had received three applications for the two licences in the third and final phase of its additional community service offerings (See RNW Oct 19) and also advertised a new Dublin City Talk-Based Broad Format Special Interest Service FM licence with an application deadline of December 17.\n\nIn addition it has now signed a ten-year contract with County Media Limited (trading as Cork's 96FM & 103FM County Sound) for the franchise areas of Cork City and County.\n\nIn non-licence related activity it has announced the winners of its Fifth New Adventures in Broadcasting Scheme, which it funded to the tune of Euros 120,000 (USD 150,00) and which was divided into three strands.\n\nClare FM took the Strand One award for a documentary Songmakers that focussed on the work of three songmakers with the aim of highlighting the wit, art and appeal contained in this pursuit.\n\nThe judges also gave special commendation to two other entries in this Strand: A Sense of Nick Drake from LMFM and The Boys from Brazil from Galway Bay FM.\n\nClare FM also took the Strand Two award for The Substance of Youth that aimed to take a more in-depth look at the cultural context in which alcohol use among young people prevails in the County Clare area and sought to go beyond the sometimes-sensational portrayal of alcohol use among young Irish people.\n\nSpecial commendation in this strand was given to WLR FM for their drama series Little Red Kettle, a production of ten five minute plays involving 28 children from the Waterford area.\n\nWired FM took the Strand Three award for Fonn na Seachtaine, a series of twelve programmes that aimed to teach traditional Irish music to listeners, teaching a tune each week with input from proficient musicians so that learners could hear high quality music.\n\nThe awards will be presented at a ceremony on November 17 and BCI Chief Executive Michael O'Keeffe said the scheme had once again \"proved to be an undoubted success with an increased number of entries and high quality programming submitted for the awards process.\"\n\nIn the UK, Ofcom had a fairly quiet week, upholding no complaints against radio in its latest complaints bulletin (See RNW Oct 10): It also announced the receipt of six applications for a new FM licence for Ashford in Kent. They came from:\n\nAshford FM - a music led bid featuring hits from the last four decades plus news and information.\n\nAshford Local Radio - a \"lifestyle\" bid with a broad music base.\n\nA-Ten FM - a broad based, popular music and local information and news service\n\nEast Kent Radio - a bid targeted at a 30-plus audience comprised of soft, classic and contemporary music from the mid 60s to the current day plus local news and information\n\nLark FM: KMfm - a full service bid mixing contemporary and classic music and locally-focussed news and information.\n\nTime FM (Ashford) Limited - a full-service, music-led bid with a local focus for listeners aged 25-54.\n\nIn the US the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been involved in a number of enforcement actions including the confirmation of a USD 21,000 penalty on a Mississippi AM (See RNW Oct 23), a USD 25,000 penalty relating to the supply of programming to a Mexican AM that was causing interference in the US and other penalties for technical regulation breaches (See RNW Oct 22), a USD 25,000 penalty on a Texas AM for EAS and Public File breaches (See RNW Oct 20).\n\nIt alsoconfirmed a maximum USD 27,500 indecency penalty against Infinity plus more technical breach and piracy breaches (See RNW Oct 19).\n\nPrevious ABA:\n\nPrevious BCI:\n\nPrevious CRTC:\n\nPrevious FCC:\n\nPrevious Licence News:\n\nPrevious Maddock:\n\nPrevious O'Keeffe:\n\nPrevious Ofcom:\n\nABA web site:\n\nBCI web site: CRTC web site:\n\nFCC web site:\n\nOfcom web site: 2004-10-24: Capital FM, London, breakfast show co-host Becky Jago is to leave the show when her contract runs out at the end of this year; she joined the show, then hosted by Chris Tarrant, from the BBC TV TV's Newsround children's TV bulletin in November 2002 as part of a revamp of the show (See RNW Nov 19, 2002).\n\nThe departure was unexpected and follows an audience loss of 144,000 listeners a week in the latest ratings (See RNW Oct 22).\n\nCapital said then that the company was happy with the progress of the show and Capital FM's managing director Keith Pringle said of the departure that the station was sorry to see her go and added that the station would reveal the identity of \"Johnny's new Capital Girl\" soon.\n\nHe told the UK Guardian, \"Having been part of the previous breakfast show with Chris Tarrant, Becky has not only provided continuity for our listeners but has also been invaluable in helping Johnny Vaughan settle in to life here at Capital.\"\n\nJago was quoted in the paper as saying, \"Following discussions with the Capital management team earlier in the summer, I decided to leave when my contract finishes at the end of this year. I just miss TV too much and feel that's where my heart is.\"\n\nPrevious Capital:\n\nPrevious Jago:\n\nPrevious Pringle:\n\nUK Guardian report: 2004-10-23: EMI has confirmed that is \"cooperating fully\" with an enquiry launched by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer into payments to New York radio stations to infl"
