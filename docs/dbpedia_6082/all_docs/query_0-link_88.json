        "text": "Time has a way of extracting emotion from memories. The\n\nmore removed\n\nwe are from the memory the more detail we forget. Our\n\nsenses add so\n\nmuch to recall and these are the very things that\n\ndissipate when\n\nobserved through the finite prism of time. The soul is so\n\nmuch more\n\nthan a recording devise but time has a way of creating\n\ncompatibility\n\nissues as well. What was burned into our memory in 1980\n\nmay not be\n\nrelevant in 2012 and like an old cassette in an mp3-\n\nplayer, becomes\n\nuseless.\n\nDon’t believe me? Keep reading.\n\nI was 17-years-old when I first saw Vladimir Krutov play.\n\nHe was in\n\nLake Placid, New York, competing in the 1980 Winter\n\nOlympics. He was\n\nnot the player that he would eventually become but he wore\n\nred and\n\nhad CCCP written in white across the front of his sweater.\n\nHe was a communist. And he played for the Soviet Union’s\n\nNational\n\nTeam. I thought being a communist and playing for CCCP was\n\nthe\n\ndefinition of evil.\n\nAlthough he didn’t have the reputation, he was one of the\n\nbest\n\nwingers in the world. Krutov would eventually play with\n\nteammates\n\nIgor Larionov and Sergei Makarov and form one of the most\n\npotent\n\nscoring lines the world of hockey had ever seen. They were\n\ncalled\n\nthe KLM Line.\n\nOn a Friday, February 22, of 1980 I was preparing to watch\n\nthe US\n\nHockey Team compete against the Soviets in a medal-round\n\ngame at\n\nLake Placid. Growing up in Buffalo, New York made me an\n\navid hockey\n\nfan by proxy. The Buffalo Sabres were as popular as the\n\nBuffalo\n\nBills and although I couldn’t skate (weak ankles) there\n\nwas nothing\n\nother than death that would have kept me from planting\n\nmyself in\n\nfront of a television. Hockey was awesome and the Soviet\n\nUnion was\n\nunbeatable.\n\nVladimir Krutov scored the first goal of the game.\n\nThe United States would come back three times in this game\n\nand we\n\nall know the rest of the story: The Miracle on Ice. A team\n\nof\n\namateur and college hockey players of US descent came from\n\nbehind\n\nthree different times to finally win the game 4-3, beating\n\nthe most\n\ndominant team, in any sport, the world has ever known.\n\nThe Soviet Hockey team had won nearly every world\n\nchampionship and\n\nOlympic Tournament since 1954 and they had just lost to a\n\nbunch of\n\nrag-tag amateurs who dared to believe.\n\nThis had a profound impact on my psyche.\n\nThat very night my brother Craig was preparing for the NFL\n\ndraft.\n\nHis agent said he could be drafted as high as the third-\n\nround, but\n\nwe were all filled with doubt as to what would happen\n\nafter that;\n\nthis was the National Football League, after all. Kids\n\nthat you\n\nknew, especially your brother, didn’t get drafted and go\n\non to play\n\nin the NFL. It might happen for Mike Webster, Drew\n\nPearson, Bobby\n\nBell and Mel Renfroe, but it definitely did not happen to\n\nyour\n\nbrother. A scholarship to Syracuse University was one\n\nthing but\n\nplaying professional football didn’t happen to kids that\n\ngrew up on\n\ndead end streets that emptied into a gravel pit. Being a\n\nson of a\n\ntruck-driver carried its own reality.\n\nVladimir Krutov’s goal, giving the Soviets a 1-0 lead,\n\nconfirmed\n\nthese realities. I was crushed not only by teenage\n\nimmaturity but by\n\nhow predictable life truly was. My shoulders slumped, I\n\npushed my\n\nback against the couch with my chin on my chest.\n\nWhat was I thinking? Did I really believe Team USA was\n\ngoing to beat\n\nCCCP? Did I truly think that a bunch of kids could compete\n\nand beat\n\nthe likes of this Vladimir Krutov guy? Krutov was a\n\nSoviet, part of\n\nthe CCP, the Red Army was strong — a superpower — and\n\nthe strong\n\nand privileged prospered in this world. Kids that grew up\n\nwearing\n\nshoes three-sizes too big and “I Dig Earth” t-shirts\n\ndidn’t beat the\n\nRed Army!\n\nDid I really believe Craig was going to go pro and help my\n\nmother\n\nand father financially?\n\nThat goal by Vladimir Krutov was the last time I allowed\n\nmyself to\n\nbelieve that dreams couldn’t or didn’t happen. The kids at\n\nLake\n\nPlacid never quit and there was a lesson to be learned\n\nfrom their\n\ndetermination.\n\nFebruary 23, 1980 was somehow different from the previous\n\nday. The\n\ndays following The Miracle on Ice included Craig getting\n\ndrafted by\n\nthe Pittsburgh Steelers and playing 12 years in the NFL. I\n\nreceived\n\na college scholarship to play at West Virginia University\n\nand played\n\nprofessionally as well. My younger brother Dale was better\n\nthan both\n\nof us put together and received a scholarship to my alma\n\nmater.\n\nWednesday, Vladimir Krutov died in a hospital in Moscow.\n\nAnd this is what poured out of me. All apologies."
