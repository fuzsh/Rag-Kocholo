        "text": "“Brother Dale” Desmond was born a poor white child in Rochester, NY. At age 13 he moved to Quincy, WA…population 6,000. Ask him if he’s recovered from culture shock yet! The autumn after he graduated high school, he answered a job opening at KWNC the local 1000 watt AM station to call play-by-play for Quincy Jackrabbit basketball…and he was terrible! But he got better & after 3 games, he knew this was his career for life! In 1999, Dale went to radio school at the Academy of Radio & TV Broadcasting in Phoenix while working part time at KTAR & KMVP as a producer & board-operator. He got his first shot at country mornings at KWIQ/Moses Lake, WA in 2001. His first programming gig came in Missoula, MT as the program director of Hot AC KMSO in 2004. He combined his experience as PD & morning show host when he moved to Idaho Falls, ID at KTHK from 2006-2013. A large market & a cross-country move came when he took as job as morning host & interim PD at WCKN in Charleston, SC in 2013. A couple years later, he took a job as an OM at Cherry Creek Media, Helena, MT while holding down country mornings at KBLL in 2015. A quick move back Idaho Falls to PD & country mornings at KUPI before landing as OM of Cherry Creek Media, St. George, UT while doing country PM Drive on KIYK/KCIN. Now he’s at the pinnacle of his career as the midday host on 102.3 Coyote Country. Dale has had more unbelievable experiences than he can count & feels overwhelmingly blessed to work in the radio industry & belong to the country music family. He’s been married to his wife Melinda since 1998 & they are the parents of 3 girls & 1 boy.\n\nMore Posts for Show: Brother Dale"
