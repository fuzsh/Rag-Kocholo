The only line right now, he says, is one to the Catholic Radio group. And that outfit is sending over chant music. Radio Unica, he says, hopes to have a local marketing agreement in place soon. The Motley Fool Radio Show i i has been picked up by KTAR-AM (620), and head fool Tom Gardner will be in town Thursday to promote it .\n\nGardner will be on KTAR with Bill Heywood and Pat McMa-hon from 7 a.m. to noon at Borders Books at Biltmore Fashion Park, 24th Street and Camelback Road. The program will air at 4 p.m. Sundays, starting Nov. 15 .\n\nGardner and his brother, David, whose newspaper column appears in The Arizona Republic, have built their success on humor, an unorthodox approach and easy-to-follow advice.

Chancellor is in the process of buying the stations for $90 million from the Broadcast Group.

Program directors Ed Walsh of KFYI and Bruce St .\n\nJames of KKFR, and sales director Mike Barna will run the place until a permanent general manager is appointed. Weber said at the time of the sale that Chancellor one of the nation's largest radio companies and owner of six other stations in town has promised not to make any personnel changes for the time being. But rumors are flying about potential changes at KKFR including one about The Doghouse morning show from KYLD-FM in San Francisco taking over mornings in a syndication deal.

Great attention is paid to the more intimate sets, such as room interiors, but obvious economies are practiced in the design of larger locations. Without the superimposed title, there would be no way of telling 1941 Chicago from the New York section of any back lot. The cast is enormous and uniformly excellent. Special praise, however, should be given to Blair Underwood, who plays son Willie; Van Peebles; and Erika Alexander, who plays Mama Flora as a young adult .\n\nAnd, of course, to Tyson, the glue that holds this miniseries 333- anchors excellent cast of 'Mama Flora' it fsfsli I (Q Vj ten MDS Harris ter of sharecroppers to her arrival as the matriarch of a family that takes pride in itself and its achievements. Teleplay writers David Stevens and Carol Schreder present these events in ways that reach straight to the heart, eliciting at times joy, indignation, admiration and sorrow. There is a lot of story here, maybe too much for the four hours. Many scenes, particularly in the first part, seem hurried and not developed to their full dramatic potential. Too much of the time, the story resembles a family photo album: Here's a shot of Mama Flora meeting Booker, and, whoops, in this next shot, they're married .\n\nEven the emotional satisfaction of the conclusion is sacrificed to the quick pace of the storytelling.
