        "text": "Cardinals linebacker Chandler Jones made a hasty exit from the Red and White practice at University of Phoenix Stadium on Saturday to catch a flight. His brother, Jon ‚ÄúBones‚Äù Jones, had a fight with Daniel Cormier in UFC 214.\n\nThat was in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nChandler made it in time, and Jon won the light heavyweight championship via a knockout. Afterward, he was celebrating with Chandler, their older brother Arthur and, of all people, Dwayne ‚ÄòThe Rock‚Äô Johnson.\n\nChandler even made an appearance on FOX‚Äôs post-fight interview with Jon and happily shrugged off comments from a pro-Patriot reporter who was openly championing Chandler to return to New England.\n\n‚ÄúGo, Cards!‚Äù he said in response.\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs Chandler just chillin‚Äô with former football player-slash-actor-slash-Siri-friend Dwayne Johnson.\n\nLook who @chanjones55 found after @JonnyBones‚Äò @ufc win!\n\nIt‚Äôs @TheRock! #UFC214\n\nüëª: https://t.co/RTU3WrZVGe pic.twitter.com/Z7We2KVfac\n\n‚Äî Arizona Cardinals (@AZCardinals) July 30, 2017"
