        "text": "The Phoenix Suns and their fans issued condolences on Tuesday as word spread about the death of Dave King, a long-time writer and editor of fan site Bright Side of the Sun.\n\nBright Side of the Sun deputy manager John Voita wrote that King died over the weekend at 56 years old after a battle with stage IV melanoma.\n\nKing is survived by his wife, three daughters, sister and parents. He wrote more than 2,800 articles and served as editor for the SB Nation website from 2010-23, according to Voita.\n\nKing is perhaps most well-known for organizing annual Bright Side Night, which fundraised to give underprivileged kids a chance at attending their first Suns game. The NBA team matched donations.\n\nKing’s family asked that fans honor his memory by donating to next season’s Bright Side Night.\n\nFans who read King’s website and media members at this organization and elsewhere — some of whom got their starts covering the NBA under King — reacted to the loss on Tuesday.\n\nSuns owner Mat Ishbia also issued a statement on behalf of the organization."
