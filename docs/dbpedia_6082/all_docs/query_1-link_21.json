It became one of the most profitable media companies in the U.S.\n\nEller was also known for running movie studio Columbia Pictures, putting the Circle K convenience chain on the map and his early investments in the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nHe also was inducted into the national Advertising Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nBill Heywood (2004)\n\nHeywood was a staple in the morning on Valley radio stations for decades, starting in the late 1960s and lasting through the early 1980s.\n\nHeywood worked four stints at KTAR and also spent time alongside fellow Hall of Fame member Pat McMahon for many years.\n\nHe even appeared in a 1970s television movie about a comet slamming into downtown Phoenix called “A Fire in the Sky.”\n\nHeywood was also named Billboard’s No. 1 radio personality three times.\n\nAl McCoy (2004)\n\nThe Phoenix Suns have been playing basketball in the Valley for 54 years, and calling the action for 50 of those years is none other than the legendary McCoy.\n\nMcCoy began calling games for the Suns in September 1972 and is the longest-tenured broadcaster for an NBA team.\n\nHe’s known for shouting “Shazam!” and “Wham-Bam-Slam” during games, phrases that have been repeated by generations of fans.\n\nThe team and McCoy will forever be connected as the Suns named their press room the Al McCoy Media Center in 2007 and inducted him into the team’s Ring of Honor in 2017.\n\nMcCoy also received the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis voice can be heard during Suns home games on 98.7 FM Arizona’s Sports Station.\n\nPat McMahon (2005)\n\nPat McMahon has been a Valley fixture in the media industry both on radio and television dating back to the late 1960s. He’s been heard on various KTAR shows, including “Arizona’s Morning News,” “The McMahon Group” and “The God Show.”\n\nMcMahon is also an actor, producer, recording artist, writer and one-third of the “The Wallace and Ladmo Show,” a celebrated Arizona comedy team that was on TV for more than three decades.\n\nHe has been honored with seven Emmys, multiple national and international radio awards, as well as civic, educational, religious and humanitarian awards.\n\nMcMahon also received the Arizona Broadcasters Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nCharlie Van Dyke (2005)\n\nVan Dyke worked for KTAR in the 1980s, serving as the morning host and the imaging voice of the station for several years.\n\nHe has spent more than five decades in radio, making stops in Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles and others.\n\nVan Dyke’s spoken-word record “The Flag” charted nationally in 1976.\n\nHe was also the narrator for the 1975 Albert Brooks Film “A Star Is Bought.”\n\nPreston Westmoreland (2008)\n\nWestmoreland was heard on Valley airwaves for decades. He began his time at KTAR in 1978 with a talk show called “Midday” and spent 26 years with the station.\n\nHe would interview up to 90 people a week, with guests the likes of Bob Hope, Joan Rivers, Jay Leno, Donnie and Marie Osmond, Larry King, John Denver, Ella Fitzgerald, Leonard Nimoy, Bart Starr, Arizona politician John McCain, Nancy Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nWestmoreland left the media industry in 2004 for real estate after interviewing more than 25,000 people and receiving the Marconi award for best large-market personality.\n\nNed Foster (2010)\n\nFoster joined KTAR in 1988 and kept audiences in the know on the award-winning “Arizona’s Morning News.”\n\nThe Massachusetts native retired in 2015 after a 47-year radio career, first signing on in Boston, followed by Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Los Angeles before making his way to the Valley in 1983.\n\nTodd Wallace (2014)\n\nWallace served as a programming director for multiple Valley radio stations, including KTAR.
