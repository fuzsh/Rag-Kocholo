        "text": "Football Travels to Provo\n\nSun Devils to face BYU.\n\nSept. 7, 1998\n\nArizona State (0-1) tries to rebound from a 42-38 season-opening loss to Washington by stepping out of the Pac-10 and traveling to Provo, Utah to face the Brigham Young Cougars (0-1). BYU also opened its season with a loss, falling 38-31 to Alabama. Game time is 7:00 p.m. in Provo (6:00 Arizona Time). The game will be televised live by espn2 and broadcast on the ASU Radio network by flagship station KMVP.\n\nSeries Summary\n\nASU holds a 20-6 edge in the series that dates back to 1935. The Sun Devils have won four of the last five and 13 of the last 16 meetings, but lost to the Cougars in Tempe last year by a score of 13-10. The Sun Devils are 8-3 in Provo. ASU head coach Bruce Snyder (41-28, 7th year at ASU) is 2-6 against BYU in his career (0-1 at ASU, 2-5 at Utah State). BYU head coach LaVell Edwards (234-87-3, 27th year) is 4-7 against ASU.\n\nExposure\n\nESPN2 will televise the game live to a national cable audience with Charlie Steiner and Todd Christensen on the call and Chris Marlowe on the sidelines. ASU flagship radio station KMVP (860 AM), its sister station KTAR (620 AM) and the Sun Devil radio network will carry the game live. Tim Healey and 1987 Rose Bowl MVP Jeff Van Raaphorst will handle the call. KMVP has teamed with Broadcast.com to provide all Sun Devil radio broadcasts on the internet. Each broadcast can be accessed at www.broadcast.com/sports/ncaa/arizonastate/football.stm.\n\nLast Year - BYU 13-10\n\nA 2-0 Arizona State squad, fresh off a 23-12 win at Miami and ranked 14th in the nation, suffered their first of three losses in the 1997 season by a count of 13-10 in Sun Devil Stadium. The loss broke a 13-game ASU regular-season winning streak, a four-game ASU winning streak against BYU and a string of 8 straight wins against the Cougars in Sun Devil Stadium.\n\nThe Cougars scored the only points of the second-half when Owen Pochman booted a 32-yard field goal with 4:39 remaining in the game to give BYU the decisive 13-10 edge. The Sun Devils couldnit find a consistent offensive attack and managed just 92 yards rushing and 245 yards of total offense, one of only two times since 1996 that ASU has been held to less than 100 yards rushing or 300 yards of total offense.\n\nPolling\n\nArizona State is ranked 14th in the latest AP poll and 15th in the coachesi ESPN/USA Today poll. Arizona State began the season ranked 8th in the AP poll and 9th in the coachesi poll. BYU is not ranked.\n\nUnfamiliar Territory\n\nASU's No. 8 preseason ranking by the Associated Press was the second time in Sun Devil history that ASU has been ranked in the top 10 by AP prior to a season. ASUis only other preseason top 10 appearance was in 1976 when it was ranked third, behind Nebraska and Michigan. ASU has appeared in the AP preseason poll a total of 15 times, most recently at No. 20 in 1996.\n\nLast Week\n\nArizona State has lost its season opener just three times in the last 13 years, and each time it has come against Washington. Last week the Huskies rode the arm of QB Brock Huard (27/47, 318 yds., 4 TDs) to a 42-38 victory. Huard's 63-yard TD pass to Reggie Davis on 4th down and 17 with 28 seconds remaining in the game spoiled the efforts of ASU's offense which rolled up 465 total yards including 302 yds. passing from Ryan Kealy and 108 yds. rushing from J.R. Redmond.\n\nOn Deck\n\nASU returns home Sept. 19 for a non-conference game against North Texas. It is University Libraries Day with a $2 surcharge benefiting the ASU Library system.\n\nFast Start\n\nASU's 465 yards of total offense against Washington was the most by an ASU squad in its season opener since 1981 when the Sun Devils rolled up 544 yards in a 52-10 win over Utah. Gerald Riggs rushed for 139 yds. and 2 TDs on 14 carries in that game.\n\nQuick Strike\n\nOf ASU's five touchdown drives against Washington, four came in three minutes or less and the average time was exactly 3:00. A look at ASU's TD drives:\n\nBouncing Back\n\nArizona State has not lost two games in a row since the 1995 season when the Sun Devils fell to USC and Stanford in consecutive games. Since 1995, ASU is 6-1 in games following a loss in the same season, including a 3-0 mark last year.\n\nRolling, Rolling, Rolling ...\n\nASU has been on a roll of late. The Sun Devils won four of their final five games in 1995, put together an 11-1 record in e96 and posted a 9-3 record in 1997:\n\n3 ASU has won 24 of its last 30 games, including 19 of 23 regular-season contests.\n\n3 ASU has won 11 of its last 14 home games.\n\n3 ASU has won 11 of 12 road games.\n\n3 ASU has won 14 of its last 17 Pac-10 games.\n\n3 ASU has won 7 of its last 9 non-conference games.\n\nAmong the Best in the Nation\n\nASU's 24-6 record in its last 30 games (since a 29-21 win over BYU Oct. 14, 1995) is among the top 10 marks in the country over that span. Here's a look at the top teams in the country over their last 30 games:\n\nRecord Over Last 30 Games Team Record Pct. 1. Nebraska 28-2 .933 (19-0 loss to ASU in 1996) 2.

Arizona State 24-6 .800 North Carolina 24-6 .800 Ohio State 24-6 .800 Penn State 24-6 .800\n\nLeader of the Pac\n\nIf you compile the record of each Pac-10 team since 1995, Arizona State is the best team in the conference:\n\nCombined Record Last Three Seasons ('95-96-97) Team Record Pct. 1.

California 13-22 .371 10. Oregon State 7-27 .206\n\nSnyder Era\n\nBruce Snyder's first season as head coach at Arizona State was in 1992 and since then the Sun Devils have the third-best conference record in the Pac-10:\n\nTeam Conf. Overall Washington 34-14-1 48-22-1 USC 30-17-1 44-26-3 Arizona 27-20-1 43-27-1 Arizona State 28-21-0 41-28-0 UCLA 27-21-0 41-28-0 Oregon 25-23-0 43-29-0 Washington State 25-23-0 41-29-0 Stanford 23-25-0 36-33-2 California 15-33-0 30-40-0 Oregon State 5-42-1 16-50-1\n\nNotes on Offense\n\nJ.R. Redmond - All Purpose Excitement\n\nSun Devil junior J.R. Redmond is one of the most exciting players to watch in college football. The Heisman Trophy candidate is, first and foremost, ASU's starting tailback. Redmond started only his second game in 21 games as a Sun Devil against Washington after backing up the likes of Michael Martin and Terry Battle.\n\nRedmond has rushed for 1,224 yards in his three seasons in Tempe, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. Last year, Redmond led the Pac-10's top rushing offense with 86.5 yards per game and was named the Sun Devilsi Offensive MVP in a vote of his teammates. He was also named an honorable mention All-Pac-10 player as a running back in 1997. Last week he topped the 100-yard rushing mark for the fifth time in his career with 108 yards on 22 carries against Washington.\n\nRedmond Year-by-Year Rushing Year G/GS Att. Yds. Avg TD Lg. 1996 10/0 63 301 4.8 2 41 1997 10/1 142 865 6.1 7 93* 1998 1/1 22 108 4.9 1 22 Totals 21/1 227 1224 5.4 10 93* *5th longest run in ASU history (8/30 vs. New Mexico State)\n\nRyan Kealy - Cool Under Fire\n\nSophomore QB Ryan Kealy, a Sporting News first-team Freshman All-American in 1997, distinguished himself as the top freshman quarterback in ASU history and among the best in Pac-10 history last season. Against Washington to open the 1998 campaign, Kealy showed that a knee injury that ended his season last year will not affect him in 1998 as he passed for a career high 302 yards, completing 20 of 35 passes for 3 touchdowns with no interceptions.\n\nThe last time an ASU QB had passed for over 300 yards was Jake Plummeris 316 yds. against Stanford on Oct. 16, 1996. After one game, Kealy ranks fourth in the Pac-10 and 23rd in the nation in passing efficiency (157.9) and first in the conference and 12th in the country in total offense (305.0 ypg.). In his last seven games, Kealy is 114 of 204 (.559) for 1,566 yards (223.8 per game) with 14 TDs and 3 INTs.\n\nKealy Year-by-Year Year G/GS Comp-Att. Pct. Yds. TD-Int Lg. Avg/G Eff. 1997 11/11 162-297 54.5 2137 15-7 67 194.3 126.9 1998 1/ 1 20- 35 57.1 302 3-0 47 302.0 157.9 Career 12/12 182-332 54.8 2439 18-7 67 203.3 130.2\n\nKealy vs. the Competition\n\nIn 1997, Ryan Kealy turned in the best year a freshman QB has had at ASU and among the best in Pac-10 history. Kealy broke ASU freshman records for completions, touchdowns and yards. He also ranked among the top four freshmen in Pac-10 history in yards (3rd, 2137), touchdowns (4th, 15) and completions (3rd, 162).\n\nGrey Ruegamer - Center of Attention\n\nCharacter is something senior center Grey Ruegamer certainly has. Equally as evident are his talent, tireless work ethic and leadership. Named the top center in the nation, Ruegamer is a candidate for both the Outland and Lombardi Awards after being a consensus preseason All-American selection.\n\nA first-team All-Pac-10 selection in 1997 and an honorable mention All-Pac-10 pick in 1996, Ruegamer has been a staple in ASU's offensive line in each of the last two seasons, with ASU leading the league in rushing each year. Versatility is also a quality of Ruegameris as he has played center, left tackle and right tackle during his ASU career. In 1997, he graded out at 85 percent or better in all but three games, including a 92% rating against New Mexico State.\n\nLenzie Jackson - Leader of the Pack\n\nSenior WR Lenzie Jackson heads an ASU wide receiving corps that has been rated as one of the best in the nation. Jackson is ASU's most consistent and dangerous pass catcher as he led the team in 1997 with 53 catches for 733 yards and five touchdowns. The 53-catch season was tied for the sixth-best single season in ASU history and he is the ninth receiver in ASU history to pull in 50 or more catches in a season. Jackson started the 1998 season with four catches for 67 yards against Washington. Including bowl games, Jackson has a catch in 26 straight games and can tie John Jacksonis (USC, 1986-89) Pac-10 record of 37 consecutive games with a reception.\n\nHe also showed a new facet of his game against the Huskies by returning kicks as he averaged 26.8 yards per kickoff return which ranks 19th in the nation and second in the Pac-10. He totaled 201 all-purpose yards in the game to rank 10th in the nation and third in the Pac-10.\n\nJackson Year-by-Year Receiving Year G/GS Rec. Yds. Avg. TD Lg. 1995 10/1 6 37 6.2 1 12 1996 11/10 36 505 14.0 3 52 1997 11/11 53 733 13.8 5 46 1998 1/1 4 67 16.8 0 36 Career 33/23 99 1342 13.6 9 52 (106 catches, 1457 yds, 10 TDs in career if bowl games included)\n\nKendrick Bates\n\nJunior TE Kendrick Bates has proven his 6-6, 246-pound frame can do more than block. Bates finished 1997 third on the team with 23 catches for 320 yards, averaging 13.9 yards per catch. Among Pac-10 tight ends, Bates finished second only to Oregonis Blake Spence in catches and yardage last year. He started the 1998 campaign with 3 catches for 32 yards including a 13-yard touchdown catch.\n\nBates Year-by-Year Receiving Year G/GS Rec. Yds. Avg. TD Lg. 1996 10/1 7 82 11.7 1 26 1997 10/8 23 320 13.9 1 38 1998 1 1 3 32 10.7 1 13 Career 21/10 33 434 13.2 3 38\n\nJeff Paulk - The Incredible Paulk\n\nArizona State has led the Pac-10 in rushing for each of the last two seasons as the Sun Devils have totaled 5,372 rushing yards (including bowl games) from 1996-98. While the likes of Terry Battle, Michael Martin and J.R. Redmond account for much of that total, senior flyback Jeff Paulkis lead has been a huge reason why. The 6-1, 247-pounder is ASU's most intimidating presence and is the oft-forgotten component of an ASU backfield (QB-TB-FB) that was ranked among the top 3 in the nation by three different preseason publications.\n\nNotes on Defense\n\nMitchell Freedman - Fright Night\n\nThe veteran leader of Arizona Stateis defense is senior free safety Mitchell Freedman. The most feared hitter in the Pac-10, Freedman is one of three first-team All-Pac-10 defenders returning this season. Having appeared in 32 games, starting in 30, Freedman has been a staple in ASU's defense for each of the last four seasons. Freedmanis next tackle will be the 200th of his ASU career. Freedman was the only freshman to be named to the All-Pac-10 first or second teams in his redshirt freshman season when he was credited with a career-high 80 tackles.\n\nA second-team All-Pac-10 selection again in 1996, Freedman gave a memorable performance against Nebraska when he forced three fumbles, recovering one, and was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week (all with a broken finger). Last year saw Freedman consistently play well, but once again shine in big games - as evidenced by his career high 15 tackles against Washington and forced fumble that sealed ASU's win over eventual Pac-10 champion Washington State.\n\nFreedman Year-by-Year Year G/GS UT/AT TT TFL/Yds. Sacks/Yds. Int.PD FF FR 1995 10/9 49/31 80 0/0 0/0 0 5 4 2 1996 11/10 39/20 58 3/16 1/11 1 4 3 1 1997 10/10 25/33 58 3/18 2/16 4 4 2 0 1998 1/1 1/2 3 0/0 0/0 0 0 0 0 Career 32/30 114/86 199 6/34 3/27 5 13 9 3\n\nThree Amigos\n\nFreedman, senior defensive tackle Albrey Battle and junior cornerback Courtney Jackson are the only returning starters for the 1998 defense. Battle started 11 games and totalled 44 tackles in 1997 and has appeared in 31 games (17 starts) over his Sun Devil career. Jackson was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection in 1997 when he started all 11 games. Jackson has moved from the right corner to the left corner position for this season. He has amassed 57 tackles, two interceptions and 13 pass deflections in 23 appearances (14 starts) as a Sun Devil.\n\nBack-to-Back\n\nArizona State has led the league in scoring defense for each of the last two seasons. ASU gave up just 17.8 points per game in its Rose Bowl year of 1996 and also led the league in rushing, passing and total defense. Last year, ASU had to replace six starters on the defensive side of the ball and ended the year allowing just 18.5 points per game, once again leading the league. The 1997 defense ranked third in passing and total defense and fourth against the run.\n\nInexperience\n\nWith only three starters returning, ASU's defense will look for previous back-ups to step into starting roles. Of ASU's 11 starters, six had started prior to this season and only four - Battle, Trejo, C. Jackson & Freedman - had started more than once in their career. For comparison sake, all but one of ASU's starting offensive unit had previously started a game before Washington with J.R. Redmondis one career start the fewest among them.\n\nOther Notes\n\nDraft Success\n\nOver the course of the last two NFL Drafts, Arizona State has had 13 players picked - the third-highest total among college programs in the nation. Here's a look:\n\nSun Devils in the NFL\n\nArizona State had 25 former players make NFL rosters (does not include practice squads) at the beginning of the 1998 season. A list of Sun Devils in the NFL: Eric Allen (Raiders), Trace Armstrong (Dolphins), Mario Bates (Cardinals), Steve Bush (Bengals), David Dixon (Vikings), Eric Guiliford (Saints), Paul Justin (Bengals), Jason Kyle (Seahawks), Randall McDaniel (Vikings), Craig Newsome (Packers), Anthony Parker (Buccaneers), Jake Plummer (Cardinals), Keith Poole (Saints), Damien Richardson (Panthers), Derrick Rodgers (Dolphins), Juan Roque (Lions), Dan Saleaumua (Seahawks), Jason Simmons (Steelers), Derek Smith (Redskins), Phillippi Sparks (Giants), Jeremy Staat (Steelers), Shawn Swayda (Falcons), J.T. Thomas (Rams), Pat Tillman (Cardinals) and Darren Woodson (Cowboys). Missing the Bruins\n\nThe Pac-10 schedule includes eight conference games and the conference rotates which team a school misses every two years. ASU will miss UCLA in 1998 and is scheduled to miss Oregon State in 1999 and 2000.\n\nOn the Road Again\n\nUnder Bruce Snyder, the Sun Devils are 15-14 in enemy territory, having won 10 of their last 11.\n\nSnyder in ASU History\n\nHead coach Bruce Snyder is the second-winningest coach in ASU history. Snyder's seventh year of service makes him only the fourth coach at ASU to have a tenure of more than five seasons. Frank Kushis 22 seasons and 176 wins are the most in Sun Devil history while Aaron McCreary (7 seasons, 1923-29) and ASU's first football coach, Fred Irish (8 seasons), each stayed longer than a half-decade.\n\nCoach Years Record Frank Kush 1958-79 176-54-1 Bruce Snyder 1992-Present 41-28-0 Darryl Rogers 1980-84 37-18-1\n\nSun Devil Stadium - 40th Anniversary\n\n1998 marks the 40th anniversary of Sun Devil Stadium. Originally constructed in 1958 with a capacity of 30,000, the Stadium has undergone a number of renovations and expansions in 40 years and is recognized as one of the best collegiate stadiums in the nation. It has provided ASU with a significant home field edge since its inception. Arizona State is 197-65-3 (.749) all-time in Sun Devil Stadium and 9-3 since the playing surface was dedicated as Frank Kush Field in 1996.\n\nAttendance\n\nASU has drawn six of the eight largest crowds in ASU history in the past two years, including a record 74,963 to the Rose Bowl-clinching win over California in 1996. ASU drew an average of 63,884 to seven home games in 1996, a jump of 15,003 from the previous season - the largest increase in the nation. Last year, ASU drew the fifth-largest crowd in ASU history to the Arizona game (73,682) and the sixth-largest to the WSU game (73,644). ASU bettered its 1996 average attendance by averaging 66,014 fans at home in 1997 - 2,130 more than 1996. The Sun Devils sold over 52,000 season tickets for the 1998 season, the most since the 1987 season, and drew 72,118 to their season-opener against Washington, the 12th largest crowd in ASU history.\n\nTurnover Edge\n\nIn its last 30 games (dating back to 1995), ASU has a turnover ratio of +29 (72-43). In that span, ASU has accumulated 32 INTs and 40 fumble recoveries while opponents have registered 23 interceptions and 20 recoveries. ASU is 24-6 during the stretch.\n\nSure Hands\n\nA big reason for ASU's turnover advantage has been the sure-handed play of its running backs. Sun Devil running backs have lost only seven fumbles on a rushing play since the start of the 1995 season, a span of 36 games. Thatis seven fumbles lost in 1,671 rushing attempts. However, six of those lost fumbles came in ASU's last 13 games.\n\nThe Century Mark\n\nASU had at least one person rush for 100 or more yards in six straight games and in 11 of its last 17 games. J.R. Redmond cracked the century mark with 108 yards on 22 carries in ASU's season-opener against Washington this year. ASU is 223-38-5 (.848) all-time when it has someone top the century mark and is 24-6 (.800) since Bruce Snyder's arrival in Tempe.\n\nPac-10 Poll\n\nArizona State was picked to finish second in the Pac-10 in a preseason poll of West Coast media members that regularly cover the league. UCLA received 16 of 30 first-place votes to be tabbed as the favorite for 1997. ASU garnered the other 14 first place votes in the closest poll in 20 years. The complete poll:\n\n1. UCLA (16) 284 6. Oregon 157 2. Arizona State (14) 281 7. Washington State 109 3. Washington 217 8. Stanford 95 4. USC 197 9. California 81 5. Arizona 193 10. Oregon State 36\n\nPac-10 Anniversary\n\n1998 marks the 20th anniversary of ASU men's sports joining the Pac-10 Conference. Since 1978, the Sun Devil football squad has finished in the upper-half of the conference standing 14 of 20 times including two conference championships (1986, 1996). Sun Devils have earned All-Pac-10 acclaim 205 times, including 57 first-team selections, 61 second-team selections and 87 honorable mentions. Since joining the Pac-10, ASU's conference record is 81-64-4 (.557) and 140-85-4 (.620) overall.\n\nFox Sports Arizona -*ASU's TV home\n\nFox Sports Arizona is the local television home of all Sun Devil athletic teams, including football.
