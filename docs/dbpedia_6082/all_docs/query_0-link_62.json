        "text": "KOY was the first radio station in the state of Arizona, signing on in 1921 as Amateur Radio station 6BBH on 360 meters (833 kHz). Earl Nielsen was the holder of the 6BBH call sign (there were no country prefixes for hams prior to 1928).[1] At that time, broadcasting by ham radio operators was legal.\n\nIn 1922, the station received its broadcast license, under the Nielsen Radio & Sporting Goods Company business name, with the callsign KFCB. While the KFCB call letters were sequentially assigned, the station adopted the slogan \"Kind Friends Come Back\" to match the callsign.\n\nA Phoenix teenager and radio enthusiast named Barry Goldwater was one of the new station's first employees.\n\nWhen the AM broadcast band was opened in 1923 by the Department of Commerce, KFCB moved around the dial, as did many stations at the time. It was on 1260, 1230, 1310, and 1390 before moving to its long-time home of 550 kHz in 1940. KFCB became KOY on February 8, 1929.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1949, KOY was the CBS Radio Network affiliate for the Phoenix area. It became the Mutual affiliate in 1949 after KOOL 960 took the CBS affiliation.\n\nIn 1936, Earl Nielsen sold KOY to Prairie Farmer, dba Salt River Valley Broadcasting Company. He remained Station Manager for a couple of years. Prairie Farmer was the owner of WLS radio in Chicago at the time.\n\nIn March 1937, KOY moved its transmitter from its long-time home on N. Central Ave. to 12th St. and Camelback Rd., though the station never maintained studios there. That location is now the home of a car dealership. The 550 transmitter was relocated to its present site, near 36th St. and Southern Ave. in south Phoenix, in 1968.[2]\n\nFor a brief period KOY entered the television business, sharing the operations of Channel 10 with KOOL (now KSAZ-TV). Because early television involved large expenses and very small income, it was decided that KOY would do much better if it concentrated on radio.\n\nKOY also had a sister station, KOY-FM (formerly KRFM, KQYT, now KYOT-FM 95.5), which was known in the 1980s and early 1990s as Y-95 after an attempt to move 550 KOY's adult contemporary format to FM failed. Y-95 was a contemporary hit radio (Top-40) station and was owned by Edens Broadcasting, headed by Gary Edens.\n\nKOY and its Adult Standards format moved to AM 1230 when station owner AM/FM (now iHeartMedia) purchased the call letters, studio, and sports-talk programming of KGME 1360, and moved it to 550 in April 1999.\n\nAs of August 19, 2013, KOY's format was business news, relying heavily on programming from Bloomberg Radio.\n\nFor many years, KOY was the Valley's top station. KOY still maintains a loyal audience and is regularly at the top of the Adults 55+ ratings and often in the top 10 in the Adults 35+ demographic.\n\nOn August 5, 2014, KOY flipped from Business Talk to Conservative Talk. It still branded itself as an extension of KFYI by rebranding with the change to KFYI 2; selected Bloomberg Radio programming is still carried during early morning and weekend hours.[3]\n\nOn September 14, 2017 KOY changed their format from conservative talk to regional Mexican, branded as \"93.7 El PatrÃ³n\" (simulcast on FM translator K229DB 93.7 FM Phoenix).[4]\n\n1230 kHz in Phoenix\n\n1230 kHz, and its pre-NARBA predecessor 1200 kHz, has been occupied in Phoenix since 1940.\n\nFrom sign-on in 1940 to March 1941, KPHO occupied 1200 kHz and was the home of the NBC Blue Network, which later became ABC. Prior to KPHO's sign-on, both NBC Red and NBC Blue network programs aired on KTAR. On March 28, 1941, KPHO and all other stations on 1200 moved to 1230, when NARBA took effect. On September 21, 1949,[5] KPHO moved to 910 kHz. 910 was later the home of KJJJ and KFYI, and is now XTRA Sports 910.\n\nIn 1950, AM 1230 returned to the air under a new license as KRIZ, which became an extremely successful AM top 40 station beginning in the late 1950s. KRIZ died in 1978, replaced by religious broadcaster KFLR. KFLR moved to FM 90.3 in the 1980s (they briefly simulcasted). After that, 1230 was KAMJ, KISP, KYOT, and KISO prior to becoming KOY in 1999,[6] running adult-contemporary (simulcast on 101.5 for a time), news/talk/sports, urban adult-contemporary, and classic country formats. While the station did carry the KYOT call sign, it never simulcast KYOT-FM. The call sign was parked on 1230 until Sundance finished acquiring what was then KOY-FM. The station did not change back to KISP after KYOT-FM launched despite its \"Kiss\" branding; when management decided to change it back, the KISP calls were not available so it settled for KISO. KAMJ was the original home of Rush Limbaugh, before he moved to KFYI.\n\nThe 1200/1230 transmitter has been located at 2345 W. Buckeye Rd. in Phoenix since sign-on in 1940; Howard Loeb, KRIZ's original owner, bought the facilities from KPHO (which had built new ones upon moving to 910).[7] The KRIZ studios were also located there. In 1984, the KRIZ call letters were assigned to a radio station in Renton, Washington."
