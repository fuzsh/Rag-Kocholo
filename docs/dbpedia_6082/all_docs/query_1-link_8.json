        "text": "Congratulations to Arizona Sports. The Phoenix sports brand received one of 10 Crystal Awards given out by the National Association of Broadcasters. The honor gave the Bonneville sports station the honor of becoming the first ever sports radio station to receive the prestigious award.\n\nWinners were announced at the We Are Broadcasters celebration on Tuesday at the NAB Show in Las Vegas. The 10 winners were chosen from a list of 50 finalists. Arizona Sports had been a finalist in 2023.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSince 1987, the NAB Crystal Radio Awards have recognized radio stations for their exceptional year-round commitment to community service. Winners were chosen by a panel of judges representing the broadcast industry, community service organizations and public relations firms.\n\n“It’s a major part of the fabric of what we do and to have it be recognized sort of brings it all into perspective why we do what we do,” said Bonneville Arizona Director of Programming Operations Brian Long about the commitment the station and cluster make to working within the community.\n\nBonneville Phoenix SVP, Market Manager Ryan Hatch added, “Thank you to all Bonneville Phoenix teammates for their efforts to build up, inform and uplift our community. Whether it’s connected to a station program or volunteering on a project to help improve our neighborhoods, it has a meaningful impact.”\n\nOne example of the work done by Arizona Sports and sister station KTAR News 92.3 saw the two brands team up with Phoenix Children’s Hospital for a Give-a-Thon week in 2023. The two outlets combined to help raise $2.15 million for kids and families in need."
