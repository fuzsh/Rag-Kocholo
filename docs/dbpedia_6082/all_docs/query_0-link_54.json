By Bob Cohn The Arizona Republic The record is the obvious way to mark the progress jnade by the Arizona State basketball program, but there are other, more subtle indications. Such as this: The Suri Devils won their Pac-10 opener Saturday, their first conference victory in nearly a year, and no one was really happy about it. I came into the locker room, and I don't hear a peep put of these guys,\" ASU Coach Don Newman said after the 84-8 1 victory over Southern California at the University Activity Center .\n\n\"It tells me a lot about the character of these guys. I don't think they were satisfied with their play.\" USC came in with a five-game losing streak, but the Trojans have been hard hit by injuries and only now are starting to reassemble. The Sun Devils are trying to rise above the multitude of teams that clearly rank below UCLA, Arizona and Stanford in the Pac-10, as if to prove the league is something other than the Big Three and the Seven Dwarves. Please see DEVILS, Page C12 By Lee Shappell The Arizona Republic TUCSON First, Arizona's national championship banner was lowered from the rafters of McKale Center on Saturday. Then, the eighth-ranked Wildcats lowered No .\n\n9 UCLA, their longtime nemesis, 87-75, in an emotional and hard-fought Pac-10 opener. There was a portention for the Bruins (9-2) shortly after the banner was unfurled to a thunderous reception from the sellout crowd of 14,551. The words of the national anthem came out \"through the perilous night,\" and it was, indeed, a perilous night during a perilous fight against the pressure and speed of the Wildcats, who ended a three-game skid against the Bruins. \"If you can't get excited about this game, there's something wrong,\" said guard Miles Simon, who led UA with a season-high 27 points.

No other word seems to describe Saturday's semifinals of the $3.65 million Andersen Consulting World Championship more perfectly. First, favorite Ernie Els got stuck by a cholla cactus on his way to the 14th tee at Grayhawk Golf Club.

Locked in his match with underdog Hajime Meshiai going into the 18th hole, Love hit the flag stick with his approach shot. The ball nearly landed in the cup before it settled 25 feet away. His resulting 2-putt birdie eeked out a 1-up win. Love also will get a shot at the $1 million jackpot .\n\nNot to be left out of this sticky situation was ABC television. Had Meshiai beaten Love, the network would have been stuck with a mundane final, at least from an American standpoint. Instead, golf fans and ABC were given Montgomerie vs. Love Europe vs. America .\n\nThe Ryder Cup might be mentioned once or twice during today's telecast.

But with the final seconds ticking off the clock in regulation, left wing Keith Tkachuk stuffed a rebound past goalie Tommy Salo, lifting the Coyotes to their fifth straight win, a 2-1 victory over the New York Islanders .\n\nIt's the first time the team has Jim PoulinThe Arizona Republic Davis Love III gets some help from his brother, Mark, on a putt.

He says that going with the flow is an important part of any figure skating routine. For that reason, he likes Michelle Kwan's chances in the women's finals at the U.S .\n\nnationals. By Norm Frauenheim The Arizona Republic Mike Tyson is considering a Sedona hotel as a possible training site, according to a representative for the former heavyweight champ and a Valley fight manager who said he was asked to make some tentative arrangements by Tyson promoter Don King. A Tyson manager, either Rory Holloway or John Home, is expected to visit the King's Ransom hotel in Sedona today, said Latondia Lawson, who often makes arrangements for the Tyson entourage. Lawson, of Las Vegas, said she also plans to visit the Sedona site today with Steve Eisner, a longtime Valley boxing promoter and manager. Lawson and Eisner said one of Tyson's managers Please see TYSON, Page C5 By Jeff Metcalfe The Arizona Republic Grant Marron and his juvenile pairs partner, Helen Thomas, are working in the chill of Oceanside Ice Arena on a death spiral that proves how fine the line is between tragedy and comedy .\n\nThe dramatic figure skating spin, when in the learning stage, is a funniest blooper. It's an ugly duckling that one day will become a swan, something to laugh about with the child skaters. So, Hal Marron chuckles, remembering when he first tried to muster enough strength to lower his sister, Lyndy, parallel to the ice and spin her. He is patient and agrees to a five-minute break when the 9-year-old Thomas sweetly asks if she and Grant, 13, can leave the ice to warm up.
