Sue had every- thiiifl thai a woman could wish for except a husband, a baby, and a title. She- pot all three, ami now she is unhappy. Whieh seems to prove that happiness doers not depend on riches. But it does not prove that, conversely, the poorest woman in (lie world is the happiest. Each has lo formulate her own reripe for happiness.

The poorest woman may have the advantage of her there. A capacity for being taken out of herself and sufficient means and leisure to indulge that capacity are ingredients of every woman's happiness. The rich woinan's_ contacts and variely of experience arc restricted by her wealth, those of the very poor woman by her poverty. Hie rich woman's way is made so easy that the inward satisfac- tion of meeting and solving for herseir the ordinary problems of life is withheld from her: the very poor woman never pets her head above hcrdifficidlies. After all, il is Ihe woman of moderate means who is host placed to experience the heallhv conflict of life, to seek human values and understand them, develop and control Ihe emotions — to discover within herself Ihe most reliable formula for happiness. —Till.
