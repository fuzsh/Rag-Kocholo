In 2019, he donated $100,000 to the local organization as part of the Devin Booker Starting Five campaign, his $500,000-per-year funding of charities of his choosing.\n\n“Special Olympics is honored to name Devin Booker as our newest Global Ambassador,” Special Olympics International CEO Mary Davis said in a press release. “People like Devin who have a sibling with intellectual disabilities possess inherent empathy for the population we serve. We are lucky to leverage his passion to inspire others around the world to join our all-out effort to end discrimination against and empower people with intellectual disabilities.”\n\nBooker joins fellow Suns guard Ricky Rubio as a Special Olympics ambassador.\n\nAt noon MST on Thursday, Booker will join ESPN’s Maria Taylor on the NBA’s Instagram account to discuss is new role, the offseason and his relationship with his sister."
