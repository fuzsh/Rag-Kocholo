Reporting financial data for the second quarter of 2022, Urban One – parent company of Radio One – reveals net revenue of $118.8 million, an increase of 10.4 percent over the same period in 2021. Consolidated net income for Q2 of 2022 was $15.8 million, a decline of 14.4% from the same period in 2021. Urban One reports financial data for six separate segments including Radio Advertising ($44.5 million, up 4.5%), Digital Advertising ($17.8 million, up 19.1%), and Event Revenue ($1.1 million, up 2.3%). Urban One CEO and president Alfred Liggins III says, “We had a strong finish to Q2, driven by continued robust growth in digital and cable television advertising, both of which were up double digits. Our spot radio business outperformed the markets in which we operate by 230 Bps, and I was pleased with our overall 10.4% revenue growth, as a result of which we were able to post adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.1% y-o-y. Like other media businesses, we have experienced a slow-down in Q3, particularly in core radio which is currently pacing down low-to-mid single-digits. Given our diversified mix of assets, I still anticipate consolidated net revenues to grow in Q3, and we remain well positioned for political advertising later in the year. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation decisions and our cash position remains strong. We finished the quarter with net leverage below 4.0x, in line with our goal to continue to reduce leverage over time.”\n\nRound Two of July PPMs Released.

The veteran radio broadcaster who rolled up his sleeves in 2019 and fulfilled his lifelong dream of owning and operating a radio station by acquiring news/talker KFNX (1100 AM) in Phoenix is this week’s guest on the award-winning PodcastOne series, “The Michael Harrison Interview.” Michael Harrison has known and closely followed the solid career of Bill Brady since hiring him as program director and afternoon drive host at WSPR, Springfield in 1986. Harrison says, “Bill Brady is one of the smartest, most-talented, and dedicated talk radio broadcasters on either side of the microphone that I have ever met, and I’m delighted to have him on the podcast this week to talk about hosting and managing in 2022.” In his steadfast career, Brady served in a number of key industry positions on air and in sales management in large market radio and television as well as the newspaper business. His resume includes stints with Clear Channel Radio, Citadel Communications, Comcast and the Miami Herald. His radio background includes the aforementioned WSPR, Springfield; WQBK, Albany and WPRO, Providence among others. When Brady purchased KFNX right before the pandemic hit, he vowed to upgrade the Phoenix talk outlet to competitor status by eliminating much of its brokered clutter, adding high-caliber syndication and local shows (including his own 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm daily program) bolstering the sales initiative, instituting a modern expansion of its digital presence and growing its community involvement and outreach. He is well on his way to achieving his goals. News/talk radio practitioners will find this interview illuminating.

To get America back on track, we must embrace our roots, rethink education and leadership, and take back control of ourselves, our families, and our country. I hope to inspire my listeners to join into this hopeful and mindful American mentality!

The latest Podcast Download – Spring 2022 Report from Cumulus Media and Signal Hill Insights that examines weekly podcast listeners has been released. Cumulus says the report is part of its commitment to share insights and research findings with the podcast community. Cumulus EVP, marketing and president, Westwood One Suzanne Grimes says, “Our new Podcast Download Report uncovers a major surge in video podcast audiences as YouTube becomes the most-used platform to access podcasts. Podcast advertising reaches millions of younger consumers who have abandoned linear television for advertising-free video streaming services.” Some highlights from the report: 1) Six in 10 weekly podcast listeners say they prefer podcasts with video. When asked how they prefer listening to podcasts, 28% say they like a podcast video they actively watch while listening and 29% indicate they have the video in the background/minimized while listening. 43% say they use audio only with no video; 2) YouTube is now the leading audience destination. When asked which platform they listen to the most to access podcasts, 24.2% say YouTube, followed by Spotify (23.8%) and Apple Podcasts (16%); 3) The greater the time spent with podcasts, the more the podcast ads generate consumer response and business outcomes. As a result of hearing a podcast ad, heavy podcast listeners (those who listen six-plus hours per week) are more likely to have searched online for a product, discovered a new product/service, made a purchase, used a promo code, or followed a brand on social media. See the complete report here.\n\nEdison Research: SiriusXM Top Podcast Network by Reach.

Longtime Denver talk radio personality Peter Boyles called in to his own show on Salem Media Group’s KNUS-AM while on vacation to tell his listeners that he will be retiring from his radio program. As reported by Westword, his March 21 call to substitute host George Brauchler included Boyles saying, “Everything has a beginning and a middle and an end. And I see an end coming.” Boyles recently suffered a health episode while on air that he referred to as an “event” and a “mini-stroke.” Boyles, who will soon turn 79, announced that there will be a five-hour “going away” show on April 1 that will include former KOA personality Mike Rosen. Boyles spent a large part of his Denver talk career at iHeartMedia’s KHOW where he hosted the morning drive show for almost 20 years. He was fired from KHOW in 2013 after getting into a physical confrontation with producer Greg Hollenback, but quickly landed his current gig with Salem’s KNUS. Boyles said during his call-in, “I remember the old-timers saying, ‘When the time comes, you’ll know it.’”\n\nCharlie Kirk Latest Talk Host to Have Twitter Account Frozen. A report from Benzinga indicates that Salem Media Group personality Charlie Kirk’s Twitter account was frozen yesterday (3/22) after the social media platform ruled that his tweet about transgender Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine violated its rules against “hateful conduct.” Kirk tweeted: “Richard Levine spent 54 years of his life as a man. He had a wife and family. He ‘transitioned’ to being a woman in 2011, Joe Biden appointed Levine to be a 4-Star Admiral, and now USA Today has named ‘Rachel’ Levine as a ‘Woman of the Year’ Where are the feminists??” Kirk responded, “Everything I said was precisely accurate and yet, Twitter still suspended my account. That should terrify every American, even those who disagree with me. What they want is submission. They have become the enemy of the truth.”\n\nLeila Rahimi Promoted at Chicago TV Station; Will Continue Part Time with ‘The Score.’ Chicago media writer Robert Feder reports that sports radio personality Leila Rahimi, co-host of the late morning show on Audacy’s WSCR-AM “The Score,” is being promoted at WMAQ-TV to full-time sports anchor. The move means that Rahimi will reduce her work with co-host Dan Bernstein at “The Score” to part time. WSCR program director Mitch Rosen says in an email to his staff, “Leila will be in studio each and every Wednesday [from 9 a.m. to noon], co-hosting with Dan and adding great commentary and her unique perspective on the world of sports. Leila is a tremendous asset to The Score, and we are grateful she remains a big part of our team and that Score listeners will continue to hear Leila across all of our platforms.”\n\nAudacy Rebrands Greenville-Spartanburg Sports Talker as ‘The Fan Upstate.’ Sports talk WORD-AM/WYRD-AM in Greenville-Spartanburg is rebranding as “The Fan Upstate” after Audacy ends the stations’ affiliation with ESPN and signs on with CBS Sports Radio.

Last Friday (1/28), TALKERS magazine reported the changes included in a Seattle Times piece about the former KOMO-AM/FM, Seattle. Now, Lotus Communications makes it official. The all-news outlet takes on the new call letters KNWN-AM/FM and adopts the slogan “Northwest Newsradio.” The company says that the change was a condition of Sinclair Broadcast Group’s sale of the station – and sister AC KPLZ-FM “STAR 101.5” and talk KVI-AM – to Lotus. Sinclair continues to own and operate KOMO-TV. Lotus says, “Our commitment as the market’s leader in local and global news will not change. The same voices and outstanding news coverage that the Northwest has depended on will remain, as well as the station’s news and weather content sharing partnership with KOMO television.” Station general manager Gary Greenberg adds, “We honor the 95-year history of KOMO radio and its importance to our region. Lotus is fully committed to growing KNWN as the Northwest’s news and information leader by further engaging our community, advertisers and listeners.”\n\nFOX News Channel Marks 20 Years as Top Cable News Channel. Citing data from Nielsen Media Research, FOX News Media says that its FOX News Channel “has accomplished another historic feat, marking its 20th consecutive year as the number one cable news network in total day and primetime. Since January 2002, FNC has remained the most-watched cable news network across both dayparts with total viewers and in the 25-54 demographic. FNC continued its ratings dominance for the month of January and was the only cable news network to show year- over-year growth in total day viewers, while MSNBC and CNN are experiencing massive declines, both shedding nearly three quarters of their audience.” FOX says that FNC continued to grow its audience share, occupying more than half the audience in total day viewers (55%) and the 25-54 demo (56%) and in primetime across both categories (56% P2+ and 56% A25-54). FOX News Media CEO Suzanne Scott comments, “I am immensely proud of this landmark achievement as it is a testament to the dedicated teams across FOX News Channel, who are the backbone in making us number one for 20 consecutive years with the most loyal and politically diverse audience in cable news.”\n\nSiriusXM Reports Q 2021 Net Revenue Up 4%. Reporting its fourth quarter and full-year 2021 financial results, SiriusXM says its Q4 revenue was $2.28 billion – an increase of 4% over the same period in 2020 – and its full-year revenue was $8.7 billion – up 8% over all of 2020. Net income for the fourth quarter was $318 million, compared to Q4 2020’s net loss of $677 million. Net income for the full-year of 2021 was $1.31 billion compared to 2020’s net income of $131 million. (The fourth quarter and full year 2020 was impacted by a $976 million non-cash impairment charge associated with Pandora.) SirtiusXM CEO Jennifer Witz says, “2021 was an outstanding year across the board. We added more than one million net new SiriusXM self-pay subscribers for the 10th time in the past 11 years; this growth continues to be sustained by a fifth straight year of improving churn. Once again, we outperformed all of 2021’s public guidance, and now our strong financial position enables us to declare a special cash dividend to our stockholders. Our performance last year is a testament to our strong execution – and staying true to our vision of connecting listeners to the content they love. We collaborated with renowned and emerging creators across our platforms to deliver curated premium content both in- and out-of-car; and delivered value to our advertisers with effective solutions to reach a massive audience of more than 150 million listeners.” The company reports data for two segments – the SiriusXM segment and the Pandora segment that includes podcast platform Stitcher. SiriusXM says that in 2021, Stitcher and the company’s off-platform advertising businesses contributed $348 million of revenue, representing nearly 23% of the Pandora segment’s total revenue. Off-platform revenue, excluding Stitcher, increased approximately $60 million or 36% compared to 2020.\n\nGood Karma Brands and WTMJ-AM, Milwaukee Giving Officer Shot in Line of Duty Trip to Super Bowl XVI. Milwaukee news/talk outlet WTMJ-AM and parent company Good Karma Brands are sending Milwaukee police officer Herbert Davis III, a Cincinnati Bengals fan who was shot multiple times while on duty on January 27, to the Super Bowl in Los Angeles. Davis was doing a welfare check on a person reportedly slumped over in their car. That person got into a struggle with Davis and shot him before stealing his cruiser and driving away. Davis says he’s taking his father with him to the game since his father instilled his love for the Bengals in him. WTMJ vice president Steve Wexler said on the WTMJ afternoon program, “It’s just a token of our appreciation for your service, your commitment, and your inspiration that you’ve brought to all of us.” Good Karma is giving Davis two tickets to the game, airfare to LA, a hotel room and several thousand dollars in spending money.\n\nTALKERS News Notes. Chicago media writer Robert Feder reports that former WGN-AM late night talk host Nick Digilio launches a new podcast called “The Nick D Podcast” on the Radio Misfits Podcast Network. Digilio tells Rick Kaempfer of Illinois Entertainer, “The podcast will be a lot like the WGN show. Tons of guests that were regulars on my show on WGN, and we cover the world of pop culture. We’ll do all the regular features that we did on the show. I’ll do movie reviews. And I get to swear a little. If you were a fan of the radio show, you’ll like this podcast.”…..Comic Byron Kennedy launches the podcast, “Hot Chicken & Cage-Free Conversation,” the first three episodes of which feature country artists Jimmie Allen, Brett Eldredge, and Lainey Wilson.
