        "text": "Bonneville’s “Arizona Sports 98.7” KMVP-FM Phoenix is revamping its on-air lineup starting Tuesday, September 7.\n\nMidday hosts Dan Bickley and Vince Marotta will move to mornings from 6-10am. Bickley joined KMVP-FM in 2013 after a stint at iHeartMedia’s 910 KGME and a long run as a sports columnist for the Arizona Republic. Marotta joined the station in 2011 and also serves as Editor of ArizonaSports.com and public address announcer for the NBA’s Phoenix Suns. He has previously hosted at KGME and co-hosted mornings at “103.9 The Edge” KEDJ from 2002 to 2007.\n\nThat will bring to an end the “Doug & Wolf” show that had been heard in mornings since 2017. Ron Wolfley, who is also the Arizona Cardinals radio broadcast analyst, will move to 10am to 2pm where he will be teamed with current 6-8pm host Luke Lapinski as “Wolf and Luke”. Doug Franz will become a digital contributor on ArizonaSports.com.\n\nDave Burns and John Gambadoro will remain in afternoons from 2-6pm."
