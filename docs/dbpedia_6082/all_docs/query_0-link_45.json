        "text": "As the Cesar Chavez Foundation moves off of the non-commercial band in Phoenix following its three acquisitions in the market last year, the now former 88.3 KNAI-FM (operating under new KCCF-FM call letters) has begun stunting with a loop redirecting listeners to the new home of its Regional Mexican “La Campesina” network.\n\nWith the 88.3 allocation operating as a shared-time facility with Family Stations’ 88.3 KPHF Phoenix and the Campesina network operating commercially in its other markets outside of Phoenix and Visalia CA, the Cesar Chavez Foundation’s Farmworker Educational Radio Network made three acquisitions in 2017 to allow them to operate 24/7 and commercially in Phoenix. First it purchased 860 KMVP (now KNAI) from Bonneville for $800,000. That was followed up with the $1.1 million purchase of 101.9 K270BZ Phoenix from Riviera Broadcasting. A new subsidiary Phoenix Radio Broadcasting then purchased Beautiful Music 102.1 KAHM Spring Valley, its AM sister and three translators from Southwest FM Broadcasting for $1.7 million. The programming of KNAI moved to 860/101.9 last summer while also continuing on 88.3."
