        "text": "The Arizona Diamondbacks and Arizona Sports 98.7 have agreed to a five-year extension that will keep Arizona Sports 98.7 as the official radio home of the D-backs through 2022.\n\n“There’s nothing like listening to baseball on the radio, and that’s why we take great pride in being the exclusive D-backs radio partner since day one,” said Scott Sutherland, VP/Market Manager of Bonneville/Phoenix. “We are honored that Arizona Sports 98.7 FM will continue to broadcast D-backs baseball for many years to come.”\n\nArizona Sports 98.7 features 12 hours of live, local programming each day beginning with Doug & Wolf (6 a.m. to 10 a.m.), Off the Edge with Bertrand Berry (10 a.m. to 12 noon), Bickley & Marotta (12 noon to 2 p.m. ) and Burns & Gambo (2 p.m. to 6 p.m.).\n\nAll 162 D-backs games every season can be heard on Arizona Sports 98.7 and brother station ESPN Phoenix 620 AM with Greg Schulte, Tom Candiotti and Mike Ferrin on the call.\n\n“I’ve long believed that we have the best radio broadcast team in baseball on the No. 1 sports station in the Southwest,” said D-backs President & CEO Derrick Hall. “We are thrilled to extend that partnership long-term alongside some of the most well-known sports personalities in the Valley.”\n\nSchulte, who has been behind the mic for every major moment in D-backs history, returns to handle play-by-play duties for his 20th season, while former big league pitcher Candiotti enters his 12th season as the D-backs’ radio color analyst. Ferrin will begin his second season as a member of the D-backs’ broadcast team, serving as the secondary radio play-by-play announcer and pre- and postgame show host.\n\nReturning in 2017 is a half-hour postgame talk show called “Diamond Talk.” The show, hosted by Ferrin, will follow the network postgame show after most regular season home games, adding an additional 35 hours of D-backs programming again this season.\n\n“Diamond Talk” will include analysis of the game and interviews from the clubhouse, while Ferrin will be joined each night by other members of the D-backs broadcast team. Ferrin will also host “D-backs BP Show,” a pregame show that starts half an hour before first pitch that features interviews, analysis and late–breaking news from around Major League Baseball."
