Stations were able to turn to their national news organizations for network coverage since most had reporters covering the rally. Many stations called in their local talent to connect with listeners who wanted to talk about the event. Bruce Collins is PD and news director at Cumulus Media Dallas-Fort Worth. He tells TALKERS, “We immediately texted and sent push notifications on WBAP and KLIF and then went to FOX News Radio for wall-to-wall coverage. I then called in our WBAP morning hosts Ernie Brown and Carla Marion to talk with medical experts, police officials, and Secret Service experts in between the FOX coverage. After Ernie and Carla, WBAP PM drive host James Parker took over and fielded local listener reactions in between the FOX coverage. Phones and social media were flooded. Local WBAP host Chris Krok then did a special national broadcast on Westwood One’s “Red Eye Radio” and took local calls throughout the night.” At Red Apple Media’s WABC Radio in New York, company CEO John Catsimatidis interrupted the live “Cousin Brucie’s Saturday Night Rock & Roll Party” and brought talk host Curtis Sliwa in to go on air and work with the news team throughout the evening. Throughout the evening, WABC Radio air personalities including Dominic Carter, Rita Cosby, Greg Kelly, and more called in. Catsimatidis says, “I am immensely proud of our team who at a moment’s notice dropped whatever they were doing to bring our listeners up-to-the-minute information. Emotions are high across America. By delivering the facts, we bring a sense of calm to our listening community.” At WMAL-FM, Washington, DC, brand manager Bill Hess says, “Corey Inganamort was hosting the final hour of our live local Saturday afternoon when he noticed some activity on the studio TV. He immediately began describing what he was seeing. After several minutes, we made the call to go to our network partner, FOX News Radio, for coverage. We stayed with the network through the evening.” Urban One’s WBT-AM/FM, Charlotte, program director Mike Schaefer tells TALKERS, “Saturday evening, Brett Winterble and news director Mark Garrison were on the air within an hour of the incident, delivering the information as it unfolded. Shortly thereafter, additional members of the WBT team called in to contribute their thoughts and analysis, including Bo Thompson, Vince Coakley, Pete Kaliner, and Brett Jensen. Our coverage continued through 9:00 pm Saturday night. On Sunday we broke from regular programming and went live and local from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm, with special continuing coverage from “Good Morning BT” hosts with Bo Thompson and Beth Troutman in the morning, Vince Coakley and Pete Kaliner in the midday, and Brett Winterble and news reporter Scott Hamilton in the afternoon.” At iHeartMedia’s KFI, Los Angeles, where it was just after 3:00 pm, Neil Saavedra was live on the air. Program director Robin Bertolucci says, “We immediately went wall-to-wall covering the story. KFI’s Neil Saavedra was on the air doing his regular Saturday show, ‘The Fork Report,’ when it occurred, and he immediately switched to in-depth news coverage of the assassination attempt. KFI news had the latest and we provided ongoing updates for all of our LA iHeart properties and put up the story on all social platforms. KFI’s Gary Hoffmann came in and took over at 5:00 and we covered it wall-to-wall till 8:00 pm.” Bill Brady owns KFNX-AM, Phoenix and happened to be on the air hosting his Saturday show when news broke. He tells TALKERS, “I was on the air ‘live’ Saturday afternoon. I began the show by saying, ‘This is a very different show than I normally do. Today’s show deals with a very sensitive story. Our president was grazed by a bullet today in Butler County, Pennsylvania. A half an inch difference in the bullet’s path and this could have been an assassination. Others have been killed and wounded. There is much still to learn. Let’s try to make sense of this. It is not a day for politics.'” Salem Radio Network says, “Talk host Mike Gallagher raced to Salem studios in Tampa for a rare, two-hour live special broadcast covering this major breaking news story. Joining Gallagher were SRN’s Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Dennis Prager as well as Salem New York morning host Joe Piscopo and Salem Dallas morning host Mark Davis. Former SRN host (and one-time GOP Presidential contender) Larry Elder also joined the broadcast, which fielded calls from listeners in New York, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Illinois and many other states.” Obviously, the coverage of a news story of this magnitude spilled over into Sunday. WBEN, Buffalo brand manager Lisa Polizzi says, “We went almost all local on Sunday with David Bellavia in the morning, our ‘Hardline’ political show that included a former FBI agent, a former Buffalo police captain, and the Erie County GOP chair, as well as ‘Reese on the Radio’ taking local calls in the afternoon.”\n\nJune 2024 PPM Data – Information for Nielsen Audio’s June 2024 ratings period (May 23 – June 19) has been released for: Washington, Boston, Miami, Seattle, Detroit, Phoenix, Minneapolis, San Diego Tampa, Denver, Baltimore, and St. Louis.\n\nNo share or rank thresholds are required for spoken-word stations to be included here.\n\nDNA – DNA = Did Not Appear – Does Not Appear\n\nComparisons are May 2024 – June 2024 (6+).\n\nWASHINGTON, DC\n\nNews/Talk\n\nWMAL 3.8 – 3.6, #11 – #11\n\nWFED .1 – .1, #31 – #30 (Nationals)\n\nNews\n\nWTOP & WTLP 8.2 – 9.5, #2 – #2\n\nBusiness News WDCH .6 – .6, #24 – #23\n\nBusiness News WDCH Stream DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA\n\nWMZQ-HD2 Black Information Network DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA\n\nWUST DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA\n\nSports Talk\n\nWJFK-FM 2.0 – 1.4, #16 – #17 (Nationals)\n\nWJFK-FM Stream .9 – .6, #19 – #23 (Nationals)\n\nWTEM .5 – .2, #26 – #27\n\nWTEM Stream .4 – .4, #28 – #28\n\nWSBN .1 – .1, #31 – #30\n\nWTSD .1 – DNA, #31 – DNA\n\nWJFK-AM DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA (Nationals)\n\nPublic Radio News/Talk\n\nWAMU 10.7 – 11.3, 32nd month in succession at #1\n\nBOSTON\n\nNews/Talk\n\nWRKO 2.9 – 2.9, #13 – #13\n\nWXKS-AM .6 – .6, #24 – #23\n\nNews\n\nNews – Talk WBZ-AM 4.5 – 4.7, #7 – #7\n\nBusiness news WRCA .2 – .1, #26 – #28\n\nBlack Information Network WJMN-HD2 DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA\n\nSports Talk\n\nWBZ-FM 11.0 – 9.9, sixth straight month at #1\n\nWEEI-FM 4.0 – 3.5, #8 – #10 (Red Sox)\n\nWEEI-FM Stream DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA (Red Sox)\n\nWEEI-AM DNA – DNA, DNA – DNA (Red Sox)\n\nPublic Radio News/Talk\n\nWBUR 5.4 – 5.4, #4 – #5\n\nWGBH 3.8 – 3.1, #9 – #11\n\nNote: While on top the sixth month in a row, sports talk WBZ-FM has Boston’s largest (6+) May 2024 – June 2024 decrease (11.0 – 9.9, -1.1).
