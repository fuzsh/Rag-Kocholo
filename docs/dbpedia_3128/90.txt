The CSLSA (west coast region) is one of nine regions of the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) which in turn is affiliated with the International Life Saving Federation (ILS).

As open-water lifesavers, our MISSION is to promote Beach Safety awareness and Professional Lifeguard standards through public education, training programs, exchange programs, junior lifeguard programs, competition and other means. The ultimate goal is to prevent and reduce aquatic injuries, accidents and death at open-water beaches in the United States and throughout the world.

Our mission is to promote beach safety awareness and professional open-water lifesaving standards. Our members include lifeguards, junior lifeguards, and open water rescue professionals from California (Santa Cruz south to the Mexican border)and Arizona. We accomplish our mission through public education, junior lifeguard programs, training programs, exchange programs, competition and other means. The CSLSA works to prevent and reduce aquatic injuries, accidents and fatalities at open-water beaches.

Lifeguard agencies are professional organizations like fire and police agencies. In fact, some lifeguard agencies are part of a fire rescue agency. Others may be their own departments or part of another department.

The CSLSA has 30 Chapter/Agencies and is the Southwest Region of the United States Lifesaving Association.
