In November 1956, the National Surf Lifesaving Associations of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ceylan, Hawaii, Great Britain and the USA created the International Council of Surf Life Saving (ICSLS).

In 1971, a Congress is held in Sydney (Australia) where the members of the ICSLS created a new organisation called World Life Saving (WLS). The WLS was founded on 24 March, 1971 in Cronulla, Australia. The constitution came into effect on 14 June 1977 with a formal agreement between the foundation nations: Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.

The World Life Saving was founded for the purpose of establishing educational marine safety and aquatic programmes on a people-to-people basis.

On 24 February 1993, the WLS merged with the FIS to form the International Life Saving Federation (ILS). By that time, the WLS represented more than 20 full member national life saving organisations.
