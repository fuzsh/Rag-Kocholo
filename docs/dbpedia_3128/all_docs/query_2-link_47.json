        "text": "From humble beginnings, when the first official rescue was recorded on a Queensland beach in 1909, SLSQ, which was formally established in 1930, has developed into a ground-breaking and highly innovative organisation. SLSQ has 58 established surf lifesaving clubs with members patrolling 8,000 kilometres of the Queensland coastline from Port Douglas to Rainbow Bay. More than 34,000 Queenslanders are volunteer members of a surf lifesaving club and more than 462,000 are a member of an affiliated supporters club. Our vision: zero preventable deaths in Queensland public waters.\n\nWe aim to strengthen our commercial capability, brand and reputation to equip, empower, develop, and support our people to deliver vital aquatic rescue and safety services to save lives across Queensland.\n\nOur organisation encompasses several diverse arms - lifesaving services, community education, membership services, surf sports, fundraising and commercial training, all contributing to our vision of zero preventable deaths in Queensland public waters.\n\nAs a not-for-profit organisation, SLSQ relies heavily on government funding, community support and donations to continue our vital work both on and off Queensland's beaches. It is only with this generous support that we are able to help keep beachgoers safe.\n\nOur activities include:\n\nWestpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter Service\n\nState Operations Communications Centre\n\nCoastal Auditing\n\nOperations Support\n\nCommunity Education Programs\n\nEducation\n\nUncrewed Aviation Australia (Drone Education)\n\nSurf Life Saving in Queensland (SLSQ) began in 1908, when an old line and belt was brought to Tweed Heads by Sydney dentist Harold Bennett for the purpose of forming a lifesaving club. Not long after, the first qualified surf lifesavers practised at Greenmount Beach.\n\nOn February 21, 1909, the first recorded rescue using a lifesaving reel was performed in surf off Greenmount. Lifesavers rescued four young women and a young man, who had been swept away by a rip.\n\nSLSQ was formally established in 1930 and is the governing body for surf lifesaving in Queensland. From these very humble beginnings, SLSQ has now achieved world recognition for the outstanding courage and service of its members."
