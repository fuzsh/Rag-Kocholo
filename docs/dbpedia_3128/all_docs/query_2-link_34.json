But in one park, a decade of conservation has brought the savanna roaring back to life. Now, Conservation International and Peace Parks Foundation are replicating this success on a massive scale.\n\nSurf breaks worldwide are loved for their natural beauty and the thrill of riding that next big swell. Now, a first of its kind study finds that they are also an ally in the fight against climate change."
