        "text": "Manly Council was among the first to protect surf bathers, employing two fishermen, the Sly brothers, to patrol offshore and, in 1905, a lifeguard, Edward ‘Happy’ Eyre.\n\nMostly, surf bathers had to look after themselves but some organised training sessions to improve their lifesaving skills. Local businessmen and councillors, often surf bathers as well, saw the economic benefits of providing safe beaches.\n\nThe first surf lifesaving club was founded at Bondi in February 1907 and several others followed soon after. In October that year, the Surf Bathing Association of New South Wales was formed to regulate and promote surf bathing. Australian surf lifesaving was born.\n\nPatrolling the beach\n\nSurf lifesavers are volunteers who have qualified for the surf bronze medallion. They patrol the beach on weekends and public holidays. Lifeguards are employed by local councils to patrol the busier beaches.\n\nSurf lifesavers had to qualify for the Royal Life Saving Society’s proficiency certificate or bronze medallion until the Surf Bathing Association introduced the surf bronze medallion.\n\nToday anyone over the age of 15 can qualify as a surf lifesaver. First you must pass a series of tests including a first aid exam and a simulated rescue. You must also complete a 200-metre run, a 200-metre swim then another 200-metre run in less than eight minutes.\n\nWomen and surf lifesaving\n\nArguing that women were not strong enough to operate the equipment or swim in heavy surf, the Surf Life Saving Association banned them from qualifying for the surf bronze medallion and therefore from patrolling.\n\nDespite this, many women worked behind the scenes or were valuable fundraisers. Others formed ladies’ surf clubs and competed in carnivals, especially outside Sydney, where clubs were less concerned with the rules and more focused on their immediate community.\n\nThe Surf Life Saving Association finally admitted women as full members in 1980. Since then, the number of active surf lifesavers has almost doubled.\n\nSurf lifesaving clubs began Nipper programs for boys and girls in the 1920s and 30s. These programs operated differently at each club, with some only accepting boys while others ran Nipperette or Mermaid programs for girls.\n\nWith falling memberships and some clubs facing closure, the Surf Life Saving Association established a national Nipper program in the 1960s. The program expanded rapidly after 1980 when girls were eligible for full membership. The parents of many Nippers also joined up. There are now nearly 40,000 Nippers training to be future surf lifesavers.\n\nBears on the beach\n\nIn the 1940s trainee Royal Australian Air Force pilots wore flying suits with fake fur on the inside. After the Second World War, the linings were available from war surplus stores. Surf lifesavers wore the linings with the fur on the outside. Known as bear suits, they were a cheap and comfortable way to keep warm while on patrol. Lifesavers also wore them to dances and on road trips.\n\nSafe from stingers\n\nLifesavers in northern Australia need protection from venomous box jellyfish and other marine stingers. In the 1970s they wore pantyhose while on patrol. This led to the development of the tight-fitting lycra stinger suit.\n\nBathing areas surrounded by stinger nets provide a safe place to swim. Lifesavers drag the enclosure with a net each morning to make sure no stingers have drifted in."
