In doing so, he became the first man from the Hunter and the fourth from a NSW club to win the Aussies title.\n\nThis was an incredibly exciting race with the conditions being very tricky - sideway winds, driving rain and messy surf. Dan entered the water for the last leg in 5th or 6th, but his swim leg is his strongest and it did not disappoint; he powered through the field to come out the convincing winner.\n\nDan maintains a busy schedule as a patrolling member and full-time lifeguard, but he still always finds time to give back to the movement.\n\nDJI Store AU Redhead SLSC Shaw and Partners Iron Series #AOE24 #d1storeau #nswawards #slsnsw #athleteoftheyear #redhead ...

These tools not only offer practical learning experiences but also keep young members engaged.\n\nCongratulations to Hunter Branch on being named the 2024 Branch of the Year!\n\nDJI Store AU #AOE24 #d1storeau #nswawards #slsnsw #branchoftheyear #hunter ...
