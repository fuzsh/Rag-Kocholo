        "text": "Like many sports, the surf sports were born out of a professional activity. As a result of the dangers of the ocean, the development of the maritime traffic and surf bathing in Biarritz, the locals decide to create the first organization “Bathers Guiders” and a Surf Life Saving club.\n\nIn 1836, a human -sized company was created to ensure the safety of bathing at sea.\n\nThe BSC Surf Life Saving Academy is opened to everyone and is managed by lifeguards and qualified educators. It aims to initiate surf life savers from early age to the adult age in a fun way with the skills and knowledge of surf awareness.\n\nAt Biarritz Surf Life Saving, we provide a wide range of training sessions to improve your skills whether you aspire to be a more competent lifeguard or represent your State or Country, Surf Sports at BSC has pathways to help you achieve your goals.\n\nThe sport season starts at the beginning of October and it wraps up with the French National Surf Life Saving championship.\n\nOur “Discovery group” caters for new members to discover the surf lifesaving (up to 2 years of continuity at the club). This group is tailored to acquire surf awareness and to initiate to the different surf sports disciplines.\n\nOnce the basics have been acquired, we propose them to participate to the local surf life saving competitions, whether is in “Pool Rescue” at the Biarritz’s Cup but also beach and surf events as the Carnival’s Cup and Carcabueno’s Cup (around spring/summer).\n\nOur “Improvement group” are suitable for surf lifesavers already familiar with the ocean and the surf sports. The aim of this group is to maintain and improve those skills with the possibility of participating to any local competition.\n\nThe “Advanced group” caters for members with a competition profile, whether is at a state or national level. This group will aim for a sporting progression to compete, or to professionally work as a Lifeguard at the beach. The youngest people in this group belong to a sport section from Jean Rostand high school in Biarritz. They aim for a qualification to the Nationals while ensuring their school project and having access to a medical and sport monitoring.\n\nThe “Expert group” is designed for national or international competitors.\n\nThe surfboat is a surf lifesaving discipline very popular in Australia and New Zealand. The surfboat was used for rescue at big surf conditions where lifesavers couldn’t swim or use theirs boards to rescue the victims. Boat crews were trained in life saving skills as well as boat handling technique. Powered vessels such as inflatable skis and Jet Ski personal watercraft have replaced surf boats as the primary tool for real world rescues efforts, but surfboat training and competition remain popular for Australians as recreational activities among both professional rescuers and athletes.\n\nThis sport was implemented in France back in 2001. It was started by Philippe Doimo from Bègles Surf Club. The first Surfboat competition organized in Europe was at the French Championships in Hossegor in 2001. The participant teams were Bayonne, Bordeaux and Hossegor.\n\nThese boats are fantastic to watch and require real team effort to row together through challenging conditions. Such was the showcase at the “Grande Plage” at Biarritz back on September 5th 2008 during an international competition organized in Europe.\n\nThe surfboat craft is up to 300kg. A crew is made of five members: four rowers and a sweep. The sweep stands at the back of the boat and steers using a long oar. The remaining four crew members have one oar each – it’s their job to haul the craft out through the swell. The surf boat requires to be fit and strong, have surf skills and a solid teamwork. The sweep leads the boat and has an important role to guide the rowers.\n\nWhen the gun goes off, the crews leap into their boats and begin the mad scramble out through the surf. If all goes to plan, the boats power through the waves and over the swells. Many crews will mistime their run or be bested by the ocean and can be flipped or carried backwards by the wave. The most experimented of the crew is responsible for navigating and avoiding a back-shooting.\n\nThe course used for surfboat rowing races are circular in shape which are specially designed with floating buoys and are about 400m in length. At the start of the race, all crew members of each boat stand close to their boats holding its hull in knee-deep water. All the boats are positioned about 23m apart from each other. The race begins with a starting signal, after which the crew members push their boats for a short distance to gain momentum and the jump on to it and start rowing. The boat that first crosses the designated flags from the seaward side is declared as the winner. Anyone has its chances, a boat from the back can take a wave and finish first.\n\nIt all started at the end of 60s in New Zealand, when 2 lifesavers Warren Mitchell and John Fuller imagined a motorized surf craft to be able to be deployed in any surf conditions to save lives.\n\nSince the 70’s, the Surf lifesaving Australia and Surf Lifesaving New Zealand implemented progressively their IRBs in the beach. In 2019, they were 780 IRB deployed that contributed to more than 4200 rescues.\n\nIn 2017, the BSC equipped with 2 IRBs to assure water safety and first aid rescue during sport events and cultural events.\n\nThus, in May of the same year, the summer temperatures being favorable to frequenting the beaches, but with strong oceanic conditions and a large coefficient, the city of Biarritz asked the association to allocate two IRBs. It was requested also to provide two lifeguards to the Main beach “The Grande Plage” and two others to the Milady beach to patrol the beaches and provide first aid assistance if needed.\n\nThe Biarritz Surf Lifesaving is convinced of the usefulness of IRB surf craft and particularly in to support the work of lifeguards before and after the season.\n\nSummer 2022\n\nBeach surveillance is generalized to all the beaches of Biarritz from July 1st.\n\nThe related regulations will lead to the end of our current schedule on Sunday June 26 and the implementation of our summer schedule from Monday July 4 and valid until Sunday August 28 included.\n\nSubgroups A and B of groups D2, D3, D4, P2 will merge.\n\nHere is the list of summer groups.\n\nWinter 2022-2023\n\nThe 2022-2023 season will start on Monday, October 3.\n\nThe re-enrollment campaign is open. Members of the 2021-2022 season have priority to join the association in September.\n\nThe 2022-2023 season begins on Saturday October, 1st.\n\nBelow is your training group for the 2022-2023 season.\n\nFor any new club registration, go to the dedicated page of the website.\n\nAt every competition registered in the schedule of sports competitions, the BSC provides a transport of surf craft, whether is with the trailer or with a small truck (for the youngest categories). Priority is given to the surf craft of the club, then to the personal surf craft of the youth people then to the adults.\n\nA bus trip is organized for the competitions requiring more than 2 hours of travel. For local trips, every member will arrange their transport. Some members recommend using the website Co-voit.net. The club is not responsible the management of the car sharing but supports the initiative.\n\nThe transport details for each competition will be communicated in the “Club news” section at least one week before the event. All information will be updated as soon as communicated by the club.\n\nFor local events (less than 2hrs travel), the club won’t manage the transport of the surf craft.\n\nFor events requiring an organized transport, the club will take in charge the transport of the surf craft and will request for a participation equivalent to catering costs and approximately 1/3 of the cost of the travel per competitor.\n\nCompetitions entries are billed when you register for the competition. Payment in DPS points is possible for those who wish to do so, by contacting Alexandra at alexandra.iribarren@biarritzsauvetagecotier.com.\n\nThey are supported by the club for all national competitions.\n\nYou or your child has expressed the wish to join Biarritz Coastal Rescue for the first time at the start of the 2022-2023 school year. Thank you for your interest in our association.\n\nNext season will start on Monday, October 3.\n\nPractical information for next season (age categories, groups, schedules, etc.) will be communicated in mid-August. In order to be contacted again in August for the rest of the registration procedure, please complete the following form.\n\nThank you for your understanding."
