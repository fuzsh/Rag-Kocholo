        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact:\n\nGreat Lakes Surf Rescue Project\n\nDave Benjamin, Executive Director of Public Relations, 708-903-0166\n\nBob Pratt, Executive Director of Education, 517-643-2553\n\nwww.GLSRP.org\n\nGLSRP to host ISLA “Surf Lifeguard Certification” course on Lake Michigan\n\nThe only open water / rough water course available on the Great Lakes\n\nGREAT LAKES, USA – The Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project (GLSRP) announces that it will be hosting a 30 hour ISLA “Surf Lifeguard Certification” course at Camp Geneva in Holland, MI, Friday, October 4, 8:00 a.m. to Sunday, October 6, 6:00 p.m.\n\nSince 2010, 321 people have drowned in the Great Lakes.\n\n“Right now most Great Lakes beaches do not have lifeguards and the beaches that do, do not have open water surf lifeguard certifications,” said Dave Benjamin, GLSRP executive director. “Many only have pool lifeguard certifications.”\n\nThe class participants are traveling from Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, and Connecticut. The participants consist of lifeguards, surfers, police officers, fire fighters, and paramedics.\n\nThe ISLA instructors are professional ocean lifeguard instructors from California. They normally travel to third world countries to teach these open water surf lifeguard skills, but they are making a special trip to the Midwest, USA (which is definitely not a third world country).\n\n“The course is by no means easy,” said Henry Reyes, ISLA President. “Participants will be pushed both physically and mentally in order for them to understand the dangers involved in being a surf lifeguard and to know their own limits. The course will be challenging and certification will be based on ability and is not guaranteed.”\n\n“The Great Lakes are a hot zone for drownings in the United States, with over three hundred drownings in the last four years. Our goal is to share our skills so that beach communities can develop professional open water surf rescue programs for their lifeguards and first responders.”\n\n“This is a unique opportunity for world class training,” said Bob Pratt, GLSRP executive director. “There are hardly any lifeguards at beaches anymore, and most drownings occur during moderate wave action of two to six feet. Most lifeguards on the Great Lakes are not trained to surf rescue standards.”\n\n“ISLA instructors are recognized throughout the world for their expertise, and course graduates are qualified to work in open water surf conditions on the Great Lakes and the oceans.”\n\nRegistration is Open – Limited seats available – To register for the “Surf Lifeguard Certification” course Friday, October 4-6 in Holland, MI, go to www.glsrp.org/classes, review the four payment options, and choose the one that works for you. Any questions, call Dave Benjamin, 708-903-0166.\n\nABOUT ISLA\n\nThe International Surf Lifesaving Association (ISLA) is a nonprofit organization working to prevent drowning. Since 2008, ISLA has been fighting against drowning on a global level by providing equipment, supplies, training and volunteers to beaches that have some of the highest drowning rates in the world and it has conducted humanitarian Projects in over 13 countries.
