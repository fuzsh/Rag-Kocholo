        "text": "Junior Guard Program Spotlight: Miami Beach Ocean Rescue, FL Miami Beach Ocean Rescue’s Junior Lifeguard Program was established seven years ago, with the goal of educating the youth of the greater Miami area about beach and ocean safety. The program runs for two weeks each summer, the first week for ages 8-10 and the second ages 11-13. Participants are taught the role of lifeguards, basic rescue skills such as a rescue board rescue, and first aid. The program incorporates plenty of fun as well such as paddle boarding, surfing small waves, and even a dedicated personal rescue watercraft day. MBOR believes that the Junior Lifeguard Program is very important to their community and neighbors since the ocean is their “backyard”, and they are surrounded by water ways. They encourage participants to attend swimming lessons to further develop their swimming skills. #usla #lifeguardsforlife\n\nOpen water lifeguards are often the first to respond in critical situations, yet they are not officially recognized as first responders. In partnership with FOX's new drama series, #RescueHISurf, we're working to change this. Voice your support to Congress by visiting RHSFirstResponders.com. If you’re in the area, join us at Seaside Heights on Saturday, August 24, to discuss the cause and enjoy a sweet treat. Your support truly makes a difference! Catch the drama and dedication of lifeguards on #RescueHISurf, premiering this fall on FOX. #LifeguardsFirst #SupportHCR41 #USLA\n\nCongratulations to first-time National Champions Sussex County (DE), who overwhelmed and dominated the competition.

Lifeguards and other beach services, such as park rangers, are fully funded through beach parking fees. Nauset Beach starts their season with tryouts every year in June, followed by a week of Surf Rescue School. Their staff of 25 is led by Chief Lifeguard Tom Miskiv, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant and FireFighter/Lieutenant for COMM Fire. Assisting Tom are two talented individuals and lead Captains, Sarah Newcomb-Baker and Christen Fiero, both of whom showcased their skills as competitors in the 2023 USLA Nationals. NB Lifeguards are well-equipped to handle various emergencies, ensuring beach safety until their season concludes with Labor Day Weekend. In addition to traditional lifeguard duties, the team at Nauset Beach actively collaborates with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to protect the public from the increasing White Shark population in the area. Utilizing technology like the Sharktivity App, the team stays vigilant and ready to respond to any potential threats, ensuring visitor safety. Moreover, Nauset Beach is committed to community engagement and education. Collaborating with the Orleans Recreation Department and supporting local non-profits such as the Cape Cod National Seashore Alumni Association and the Nauset Beach Lifeguard Alumni Associate, Inc., the beach fosters a sense of environmental stewardship and community involvement. Nauset Beach lifeguards host an annual lifeguard competition open to all lifeguard agencies in the New England Region called the SandShark Relays. Nauset Beach serves as not just a recreational destination but also a beacon of safety, community engagement, and environmental conservation, making it a cherished and valuable asset to the Town of Orleans and Cape Cod as a whole.

NOAA is predicting above average hurricane activity for 2024, with most activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October. Even when hurricanes don’t produce a direct hit to an area or stay out at sea, they can still cause dangerous ocean conditions such as: large surf, heightened rip current activity, above average tides and storm surges. As always, the USLA reminds the public: SWIM NEAR A LIFEGUARD. When you arrive at the beach, check with lifeguards for designated swim areas and their safety advice. There may be hazards and temporary restrictions in effect. And also, lifeguards: no matter your region or location, thank you for your continued efforts to keep the swimming public safe. #usla #lifeguardsforlife\n\nToday was the last day of the Jersey Mike's Subs USLA National Lifeguard Championships in South Padre Island, TX.

It’s time to change that. In partnership with the USLA for the “LIFEGUARDS FIRST” campaign, FOX’s new drama series #RescueHISurf highlights the heroic actions of lifeguards who patrol and protect life at sea.

Every letter counts in our mission to secure the benefits and recognition that lifeguards deserve. And once the hard work is done, relax and tune into the premiere of #RescueHISurf on September 22 on @foxtv to see the thrilling lives of lifeguards portrayed like never before! #LifeguardsFirst #SupportHCR41 #USLA\n\nCompetitors brought their all on day two of the Jersey Mike's USLA National Lifeguard Championships in South Padre Island, TX.
