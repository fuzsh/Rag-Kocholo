In 800, the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne enlarges this hospital and adds a library.\n\n1113 - The Order of the Knights Hospitaller is established in Jerusalem for the care and protection of Christian pilgrims. They grow into a powerful military force while maintaining a knowledge of field medical care and first aid treatment.\n\n1300sÂ - Resuscitation methods for drowning victims are developed in China.\n\n1500sÂ - Leonardo da Vinci sketches a type of life preserver.\n\n1700sâ1800sÂ - Nations in Europe, Asia, and America create lifesaving societies and lifeboat services to aid shipwreck victims. The 1708 Chinese Chinkiang Association for the Saving of Life was the earliest one of these.\n\n1740Â - The Paris Academy of Sciences officially recommends mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for drowning victims.\n\n1776 - The Amsterdam Rescue Society is formed. The Society places bellows along beaches for the resuscitation of drowning victims.\n\n1804Â - W. H. Mallison invents the first lifebelt, called the Seamanâs Friend. It was never adopted by the British Royal Navy because it might encourage desertion at sea. (For a brief history of life preservers, go here.)\n\n1832Â - Lt. Kisbee invents the Kisbee ring, a type of ring buoy.\n\n1854 - A cork lifebelt was invented by Navy Commander J.R. Ward.\n\n1855Â - William S.
