The GLA provides water safety materials distributed to beach patrons, purchases rescue and racing equipment, supports USLA national lifesaving competition, provides scholarships for lifeguard college students, and supports various community service projects locally and internationally.\n\nThe Galveston Island Beach Patrol (GIBP) is certified as an “advanced” level agency of the United States Lifesaving Association and is the designated lifeguard service for the city of Galveston. It is a Texas Department of Health certified first response agency employing over 100 people comprised of lifeguards, senior guards, supervisors, peace officers, and dispatchers. The mission of GIBP is to protect the 5-7 million people who visit the Galveston beaches each year, respond to aquatic emergencies 24/7/365, educate the public about beach safety, and be a good community partner."
