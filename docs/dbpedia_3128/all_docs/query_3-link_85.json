        "text": "THE INSIDE PEEK – SEPTEMBER 2015\n\nESPIRITU-DE-CORPS: UNITY, COMMON INTERESTS AND RESPONSIBILITY IN SURFING\n\nFolks on Playa Guiones last week were witness to quite a show, as Safari Surf School’s team of instructors underwent an arduous, week-long Lifeguard Training and Surf Rescue course.\n\nEspiritu de Corps comes from French origins. It translates to “a sense of unity and common interests and responsibilities as developed among a group of persons closely associated in a task, cause, enterprise, etc.”\n\nIn a largely unregulated “industry” worldwide, surf schools seemingly can open on a whim with few boards and a surfer-dude instructor; little thought is given to format, technique, safety, and professionalism. As the Founder and leader at Safari Surf, I am dedicated to the cultivation of a team of top-level, highly trained and qualified surf instructors, authenticated by my ongoing support of specialized training programs and events advancing this cause. It is my assurance that our team is certified to the highest degree of preparedness and professionalism in all areas of instruction and water safety. As recently as last week, I found great joy and pride watching our Safari Surf squad of instructors running drills on the beach.\n\nLifeguard Training and Surf Rescue certification are a prerequisite course for inclusion in the International Surfing Association’s (ISA) professional development programs. Recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the world governing authority for the sport of surfing, the ISA Surf Coaching & Instructing Educational Program is the international standard for accreditation of Coaches and Instructors in the surf school industry.\n\nLast week, such an intensive lifeguard training/surf rescue course was lead by Marvin Perez and his associate Kali Urena of Jaco Beach, on-site in Playa Guiones. “When we came to Nosara we didn’t know what to expect” stated Marvin. “We were so stoked to be received by such a dedicated group of guys, whom are now fully certified and ready to rock. Pura Vida!”\n\nAt Safari Surf School we take care of our team – they are our family, and we pay top dollar as well as cover their medical insurance, health insurance, retirement, social security, and vacation pay. We believe that this is not only fair, but the right thing to do.\n\nPura Vida, indeed!\n\nWarm-up: Daily conditioning began with stretching and calisthenics, to kick off our ISA certification.\n\nDaily Warm-Up: Morning exercise includes some laps around Olas Verdes’ new pool.\n\nCoach Marvin Perez delivers his presentation through his motivational instruction technique.\n\nWatching our lifeguard’s during sprints delivers a “Baywatch” effect, Safari-style!\n\nWalk this way: Lifeguards practice technique and build endurance with rescue efforts.\n\nMealtime: Safari Surf School’s Chef Maritza’s delivers a wonderful and well-deserved meal to our lifeguards.\n\nTurtle Arribada: Safari Surf School President Tim Marsh standing amidst an epic turtle arribada in Ostional.\n\nBig Achievement: We are again renewed as ISA (International Surfing Association) Certified as well as Surf Rescue / Lifeguard Certified lifeguards.\n\nSaludos amigos! A spirited send-off for Marvin and Kali. Thank you!"
