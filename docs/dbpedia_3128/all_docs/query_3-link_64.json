For safety reasons, surf life savers must demonstrate their knowledge of signals before commencing any activities in the water.\n\nEach signal should be made distinctly, and repeated until acknowledged.\n\nBeach to Water Signals\n\nAttract attention\n\nRemain stationary\n\nGo to the right\n\nGo to the left\n\nPick up swimmers\n\nReturn to shore\n\nProceed further out to sea\n\nPick up and adjust buoys\n\nMessage understood, all clear\n\nWater to Beach Signals\n\nAssistance required\n\nSubmerged patient missing\n\nSignal received and understood\n\nSearch completed\n\nBoat wishes to return to shore\n\nMessage understood\n\nAll clear/OK\n\nSearch complete\n\nOther Signals\n\nEmergency Evacuation Alarm (one long continuous blast of the siren)\n\nMass Rescue (three short blasts of the siren)\n\nHelicopter Signal (thumbs up to request permission to approach helicopter)\n\nThe diagrams below depict the SLSA and international surf life saving hand signals."
