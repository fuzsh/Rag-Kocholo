        "text": "Updated for 2024\n\nWant to do good for others while doing good for yourself? Volunteering or interning with an NGO can help you build capacity and support long-term goals in the underserved communities of developing countries. It also can enhance your resume as you gain hard and soft skills.\n\nNGOs, or non-governmental organizations, are nonprofit charities or citizen-operated agencies and groups that operate independently of governments, generally on an international level. They provide aid to people, animals, and the environment, and try to improve standards in the areas of humanitarian, educational, health care, public policy, social, human rights, and environmental issues according to their objectives. They rely on donations and funding by citizen groups to achieve their goals.\n\nNGOs seek volunteers who are highly motivated and self-driven, and who would like to gain work experience abroad. Their initiatives can be limited because of a lack of permanent staff and dwindling finances. Because of this, they rely on volunteers to help them in office work, fundraising, public relations, and even manual labor. NGOs often welcome creative and talented people who can help to keep their causes relevant and in the public’s eye. Without support or a shared common interest, an NGO’s work will founder and fail.\n\nSome great organizations that provide NGO support volunteer opportunities include International Volunteer HQ (IVHQ), which offers 10 NGO support projects in 9 destinations around the world. Their sister organization, Intern Abroad HQ, also offers an NGO support internship in Spain.\n\nAs another example, through Projects Abroad, a highly respected international volunteer organization, you could work with an NGO in South Africa that helps disadvantaged communities build an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Or, you could work with local NGOs in Vietnam that tackle tough issues like drug abuse and human rights. Your help as a volunteer is vital to keeping these NGOs running successfully.\n\nNGOs have come a long way in the last 75 years. The term “NGO” came to the public’s attention in 1945 when the United Nations was created, itself an intergovernmental organization. There are now about 10 million NGOs worldwide. Some of the more popular and influential NGOs include Doctors Without Borders, Greenpeace, Heifer International, Food and Water Watch, CERES, The Nature Conservancy, Oxfam, Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn this article, we will highlight some lesser-known charities and organizations that work with NGOs, such as the award-winning volunteer organization, Maximo Nivel, which is the top-rated volunteer organization in Latin America. They do truly great work with NGOs in countries like Costa Rica and Guatemala.\n\nNGOs are funded by donations normally, but many avoid formal funding and are operated by volunteers. A characteristic of an NGO is that they are not hindered by short-term financial objectives, and instead devote themselves to issues that are far-reaching and enduring. Because of this, they are regarded with public trust.\n\nWant to know more about how you can become involved with the mission of an NGO, working for positive and sustainable outcomes? Keep reading and learn about some of our partner’s initiatives in amazing locations.\n\nNGO Volunteer Opportunities & Internships\n\nInternational Volunteer HQ (IVHQ)\n\nInternational Volunteer HQ (IVHQ) works with community organizations and NGOs in more than 40 countries.

But more importantly to me, it helped me learn and understand the troubles that animals are faced with and what this particular organization is doing to protect endangered species, such as the cheetah. I have a lot of fond memories of the people who I worked with and the animals I was fortunate enough to get to know. Those memories will never fade.”\n\nBefore or after the trip, explore the rest of the Western Cape. The Cango Caves are located nearby and will amaze you. And vibrant Cape Town is within five hours.

Often compared to a closed sea, Lake Atitlan is surrounded by three volcanoes and was formed by their eruptions 87,000 years ago. The lake is surrounded by villages with direct descendants of the ancient Mayan culture that once lived here – and the lake also hides a hidden Mayan temple ruin!\n\nKnown as Samabaj, the site is the first underwater archaeological ruins excavated in Guatemala and scuba divers are still exploring its depths. The temple was a sacred island site where Mayan pilgrims worshipped, until rising waters caused by a catastrophe, such as another volcanic eruption or landslide, submerged it in 250 CE. Hidden beneath 50 feet of water, the important spiritual site contains six ceremonial monuments and four altars.\n\nThe lake once again is threatened by catastrophe, but this time it’s by human encroachment and pollution. You can help preserve Lake Atitlan and its natural resources by raising awareness and educating the surrounding population about sustainable resource management. As a volunteer, you’ll work with an NGO to learn more about conservation practices and to share information about proper waste management, environmental management, and improving the ecological conditions of the lake.\n\nDepending on the project’s needs, field conditions, and your Spanish language skills, you’ll support the NGO in these ways:\n\nEnvironmental education – teach residents about recycling, trash disposal, water conservation, and pollution\n\nManagement of natural resources – help restore the surrounding hillsides as part of a reforestation effort\n\nEnvironmental cleanup – work in water filtration, recycling, waste management programs, and seasonal clean-up\n\nThis is a great opportunity for travelers who are physically fit and interested in working outdoors.\n\nLearn more about this important program here.\n\nVolunteer in Eco-Agriculture in Latin America\n\nPrice for 1 week: $665 for Peru and Guatemala; $719 for Costa Rica\n\nPrice for 4 weeks: $1,295 for Peru and Guatemala; $1,544 for Costa Rica\n\nLearn about sustainable farming during this NGO volunteering experience! These eco-agriculture operations utilize modern, energy-efficient farming practices alongside traditional techniques. This reduces environmental damage and threats to human health. As an eco-agriculture volunteer, you’ll work with NGOs and farming cooperatives in one of the following destinations:\n\nCosta Rica: Journey to Monteverde Cloud Forest and learn all about coffee production, from bean to cup. You’ll get to have fresh Costa Rican coffee every day!\n\nPeru: Make your way to the Huyro Region in the highlands, about three hours from Cusco. There, you’ll get your hands dirty as you help with coffee, tea, and chocolate production.\n\nGuatemala: Head just outside Antigua and engage in the responsible farming of macadamia nuts and coffee.\n\nAs a volunteer, you’ll not only support farmers, but you’ll also help the environment and local people. Past volunteers give the project great reviews, like Curtis:\n\n“I had a great experience working at the Coffee Farm project. The host mom is a great cook, and the work we did every day with the local farmers felt important and impactful. Overall, I would definitely recommend this program to anyone interested in coffee and community service. I had a lot of opportunities to practice Spanish as well, in addition to exploring the area and playing soccer with a local team.”\n\nSo, are you ready to plant and grow coffee, tea, and more?\n\nDiscover more and apply here.\n\nProjects Abroad\n\nFounded in 1992, Projects Abroad has had a mission to make a true impact through its service programs since its beginning.

FTF’s field workers have worked on a variety of projects, including starting businesses, building schools, and providing healthcare. FTF field workers are not afraid to get their hands dirty: working on farms, sanding wood, and kneading dough are some of the ways that they integrate into the local community.\n\nFTF is looking for participants with a desire to better their souls by undertaking a serious challenge, an adventurous attitude, a willingness to learn new languages, make fun of themselves, and be made fun of. Field workers typically have completed 4 years of college or have an equivalent amount of experience.
