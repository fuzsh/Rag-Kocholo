        "text": "In a World of Many Worthy Causes - Why Support Surf Life Saving NZ\n\nIn terms of community impact, the value delivered through surf lifesaving is hard to match. The impact of one drowning death on a family and community can be devastating, so it's hard to comprehend the consequences of hundreds of more drownings if lifeguards were not on duty.\n\nWhile numbers only tell a small part of that story, with the Value of Statistical Life ('VOSL') at NZ$4.14 million (June 2016), the cost to society if only 10% of the 1300 people rescued in a typical year had drowned would be $538 million. If it was 20% the cost would be close to $14.1 billion. Every year!\n\nWHY NOW?\n\nFor over 100 years, the surf lifesaving movement has survived through the support of local communities. While it is an essential public service it is not a fully funded one, instead relying on volunteers own subscriptions, donations, and short term grant funding to get by on a year by year basis.\n\nIn the 21st century this is no longer sustainable - running a long term service organisation that needs significant ongoing investment in people and equipment. Not knowing if the funding will be around next year to keep operating is putting the future of the service at risk.\n\nSurf Lifesaving is a network of volunteer run charities - not a fully government funded emergency service that many mistakenly believe. Every year over $35 million dollars needs to be raised to keep lifeguards on beaches.\n\nThis is where the Foundation will make a difference - creating long term secure income streams to make sure the funding support is there to allow ordinary people to keep doing extraordinary things."
