By coming together, we can raise awareness of the importance of drowning prevention and eliminate preventable drowning deaths.\n\nOur work doesnâ€™t stop here. Please continue to share our messages to help us create a water-loving nation free from drowning.\n\nAnyone can drown, no one should.\n\nEvery year, Royal Life Saving produces the National Drowning Report, examining the factors that contribute to drowning deaths in Australia by examining who, where, when and how people have drowned in Australian waterways. We are ever mindful that these stories in this report are of real people whose lives have been lost or impacted by drowning. We seek to advocate and collaborate to reduce the impact of drowning on the community."
