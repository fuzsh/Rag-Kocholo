They are held at either the Pool, Beach or Ocean and include a combination of the following:\n\nPool Events\n\n100m Obstacle Swim (Masters)\n\nThe competitor swims 100m in freestyle during which he/she swims under four (4) immersed obstacles.\n\n200m Obstacle Swim\n\nThe competitor swims 200m in freestyle during which he/she swims under eight (8) immersed obstacles.\n\n50m Manikin Carry\n\nThe competitor swims 25m freestyle and then dives to recover a submerged manikin to the surface within 5 m of the pick-up line. The competitor then carries the manikin to the finish edge of the pool.\n\n100m Rescue Medley\n\nThe competitor swims 50m freestyle to turn, dive, and swim underwater to a submerged manikin located at 20m distance for men and 15m distance for women.\n\nThe competitor surfaces the manikin within the 5 m pick-up line, and then carries it the remaining distance to the finish edge of the pool.\n\n100m Manikin Carry with Fins\n\nThe competitor swims 50m freestyle wearing fins and then dives to recover a submerged manikin to the surface within 10m of the turning edge.\n\nThe competitor carries the manikin to the finish edge of the pool.\n\n100m Manikin Tow with Fins\n\nThe competitor swims 50m freestyle with fins and rescue tube.\n\nAfter touching the turning edge, the competitor fixes the rescue tube around a manikin floating at the surface at the edge and tows it to the finish.\n\n200m Super Lifesaver\n\nThe competitor swims 75m freestyle and then dives to recover a submerged manikin. The competitor surfaces the manikin within 5m of the pick-up line and carries it to the turning edge. After touching the wall, the competitor releases the manikin.\n\nIn the water, the competitor dons fins and rescue tube within 5m of the turning edge and swims 50m freestyle. After touching the wall, the competitor fixes the rescue tube around a floating manikin within 5m of the turning edge and tows it to touch the finish edge of the pool.\n\nLine Throw\n\nIn this timed event, the competitor throws an unweighted line to a fellow team member located in the water approximately 12m distant and pulls this “victim” back to the poolside.\n\n4x25m Manikin Relay\n\nFour competitors in turn carry a manikin approximately 25m each.\n\n4x50m Obstacle Relay\n\nFour competitors swim 50m freestyle each passing under two (2) obstacles.\n\n4x50m Medley Relay\n\nThe first competitor swims 50m freestyle without fins.\n\nThe second competitor swims 50m freestyle with fins.\n\nThe third competitor swims 50m freestyle pulling a rescue tube and after having touched the wall, passes the harness of the rescue tube to a fourth competitor who wears fins.\n\nThe third competitor, playing the role of “victim,” holds the rescue tube with both hands, while being towed 50m by the fourth competitor to the finish.\n\nBeach Events\n\nSurf Race\n\nWith a running start into the surf from the start line on the beach, competitors swim around the 400m (approximate) course designated by buoys, returning to shore to finish between the finish flags on the beach.\n\nSurf Teams Race\n\nWith a running start into the surf from the start line on the beach, all three (3) members of each team swim around the 400m (approximate) course designated by buoys, returning to shore to finish between the finish flags on the beach.\n\nRescue Tube Rescue\n\nThe event consists of four persons – a patient, a Rescue Tube swimmer and two rescuers.\n\nThe rescue tube swimmer swims out behind the buoy line to secure the rescue tube around the patient and then tow the patient back to the beach.\n\nOn return to the beach, two rescuers must drag or carry the patient past the finish line.\n\nRescue Tube Race\n\nOn the acoustic starting signal, the competitors race up the beach to recover their rescue tubes, don their belt/harness, enter the water and swim to their designated buoy and after touching it, lift their arm to mark the end of the event.\n\nRun Swim Run\n\nFrom the start line, competitors run to pass around the turning flag and enter the water to swim out to and around the buoys. Competitors swim back to the beach to again run round the turning flag before running to the finish line.\n\nBeach Flags\n\nFrom a prone starting position on the beach, competitors rise, turn and race to obtain a baton (beach flag) buried upright in the sand approximately 20 m away.\n\nSince there are always fewer batons than competitors, those who fail to obtain a baton are eliminated.\n\nBeach Sprint\n\nCompetitors take their positions in their allotted lanes. At the starting signal, competitors race the 90 m course to the finish line. The finish is judged on the competitor’s chest crossing the finish line. Competitors must finish the event on their feet in an upright position.\n\nBeach Run\n\n2 km: Competitors race 2.000m on the beach in four 500m legs\n\n1 km: Competitors race 1.000m on the beach in four 500m legs\n\nBeach Relay\n\nTeams of 4 individuals (3 in Masters) compete in baton relay fashion over a 90 m course.\n\nTo start, 2 (1 and 2 members in Masters) competitors take positions in their allotted lane at each end of the course.\n\nAfter the start each competitor completes a leg of the course with a baton held in either hand and passes the baton at the conclusion of the first, second, and third legs to the next runner.\n\nSurf Ski Race\n\nCompetitors steady their skis in line in knee-deep water about 1,5 m apart.\n\nCompetitors must obey directions from the starter or check starter concerning ski alignment at the start.\n\nOn the starting signal, competitors paddle their skis around the course marked by buoys and return to finish when any part of the ski crosses the in-water finish line – ridden, gripped, or carried by the competitor.\n\nSurf Ski Relay\n\nThe ski relay race shall be conducted under the general rules of the ski race. Teams shall consist of 3 competitors, who may use the same craft.\n\nBoard Race\n\nCompetitors stand on or behind the start line on the beach with their boards 1.5m apart.\n\nAt the start signal, competitors enter the water, launch their boards, and paddle the course marked by buoys, return to the beach, and run to cross the finish line.\n\nBoard Relay\n\nThe Board Relay event shall be conducted under the general rules of the Board Race event. Teams shall consist of 3 competitors, who may use the same craft.\n\nBoard Rescue\n\nIn this event, 1 member of the team races approximately 120m to a designated buoy, signals, and waits to be picked up by the second member of the team on a board.\n\nThey both paddle to shore and cross the finish line on the beach with the board.\n\nOceanman/Oceanwoman\n\nCompetitors cover a 1,200m course that includes a swim leg, a board leg, a surf ski leg, and a beach sprint finish. Conditions of racing of each leg are as generally required for the individual conditions of that discipline including the rules governing the component disciplines: surf ski races, board races, surf races, beach sprints.\n\nOceanman/Oceanwoman Relay\n\nTeams of 4 competitors (1 swimmer, 1 board paddler, 1 surf ski paddler, and 1 runner) cover the course in a sequence of legs determined by draw at the start of each world championship programme.\n\nThe run leg is always the final leg.\n\nIf the ski leg is first, competitors shall start with a typical in-water start.\n\n(Masters: Teams of 3 competitors – 1 swimmer, 1 board paddler, 1 surf ski paddler. There is no running leg in Masters Ocean Relay.)\n\nSimulated Emergency Response Competition (SERC)\n\nThe Simulated Emergency Response Competition tests the initiative, judgment, knowledge, and abilities of 4 lifesavers who, acting as a team, apply lifesaving skills in a simulated emergency situation unknown to them prior to the start. This competition is judged within a 2-minute time limit. All teams respond to the identical situation and are evaluated by the same judges.\n\nSurf Boat Event\n\nSurf Boat Race\n\nBoat crews stand in knee-deep water holding their boats about 23 m apart.\n\nAfter the starting signal, crews’ row around the assigned turning buoys positioned approximately 400 m from the start and return to the beach.\n\nThe finish is determined by any part of the hull crossing the finish line from the seaward side, between the designated flags.\n\nInflatable Rescue Boat (IRB) Events\n\nIRB Rescue\n\nTeams are comprised of 1 victim, 1 driver, and 1 crew member. The victim is positioned on the seaward side of the designated buoy.\n\nThe driver and crew member are on the beach side of the crew start / finish line adjacent to their beach position indicators.\n\nOn the starter’s signal, the crew launches the IRB, proceed through the surf to pick-up their victim, round their buoy, and return to shore to finish the event.\n\nIRB Mass Rescue\n\nEach team comprises of 1 driver, 1 crew person and 2 patients. Both patients are positioned in the water at their allocated patient pick-up buoy. The driver and crewperson are position adjacent to their respective beach position marker in readiness for a race start. On the starters “Go” signal, the driver and crew cross the start/finish line and proceed to the IRB, launch and proceed out to sea to pick up their first patient and then return to shore. The patient pick up commences on the seaward side of the patient pick up buoy. The driver and crew person may both assist with the patient lift.\n\nOnce back on shore, the driver exits and the crewperson controls the IRB and turns it around. The patient exits after the driver exits. The driver proceeds to the start/finish line, rounds their respective beach position marker and returns to the IRB. The IRB is relaunched and restarted and the crew proceeds out to sea to pick up their second patient and then returns to shore to finish the event.\n\nIRB Team Rescue\n\nTeams are comprised of 1 victim and 2 crews (1 driver and 1 crew member per crew). The victim is positioned on the seaward side of a designated buoy. Both crews are positioned on the beach side of the crew start / finish line adjacent to their beach position indicator.\n\nOn the starter’s signal, the first crew launch the IRB and proceed through the surf to the victim. On the inside of the turn as the IRB rounds the buoy, the crew member jumps overboard on the seaward side of the buoy. The driver completes the buoy turn and returns to shore alone.\n\nMeanwhile the crew member of the second crew moves into the water.\n\nThe first driver stays in contact and in control of the IRB until the second crew member secures and takes control of the IRB. The first driver runs up the beach and crosses the crew start/finish line to tag the second driver who proceeds to the IRB.\n\nThe second crew re-launch the IRB, proceed through the surf, to pick-up the victim and the first crew member, round their buoy, and return to shore to finish the event.\n\nIRB Rescue Tube\n\nTeams are comprised of 1 victim, 1 driver, and 1 crew member. Victims are positioned at their respective victim buoys, set approximately 25 m on the seaward side of the turning buoys. Crew members are positioned on the beach side of the crew start / finish line, adjacent to their respective beach position indicators.\n\nOn the starter’s signal, competitors launch their IRBs, proceed through the surf and turn around their respective turning buoy. The crew member dons the rescue tube harness.\n\nAfter the IRB has rounded the turning buoy, the crew member with harness donned and the rescue tube held in a secure grip, enters the water and swim past the turning buoy to their victims.\n\nThe crew member secures the rescue tube around the arms of the victim and tows the victim back to the IRB. Once the crew member contacts the IRB or driver, he or she may board before the victim. The driver may assist the crew member and / or victim into the IRB. Victims may assist themselves in boarding the IRB.\n\nAfter the “victim lift” into the IRB has commenced, the driver drives the IRB around the team’s respective turning buoy and returns to shore to fin."
