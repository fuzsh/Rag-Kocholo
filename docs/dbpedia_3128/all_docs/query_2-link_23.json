Both courses are free, but we ask a nominal fee of $10 to cover printing costs.\n\nThe Tide Pool Program is open to the general public and uses the iNaturalist app to photograph and record tide pool species. Certificates of completion of provided to those who pre-register. How iNaturalist Works: www.inaturalist.org | Visit Ocean Sanctuaries’ Tide Pool Project on iNaturalist: www.inaturalist.org/projects/ocean-sanctuaries-tide-pool-project\n\n‘Sharks of California’ uses a citizen science database provided by BSCS called ‘Fieldscope’ to record divers’ encounters with the various species of shark off the coast of California, always remembering to put safety first! Visit sharksofsandiego.fieldscope.org for more information.\n\n‘Sevengill Shark ID Project: this project also requires at least one photograph of this species of shark, commonly seen in the waters off California and Cape Town, which is uploaded to a database with a pattern recognition algorithm to ID sharks which are returning from year to year, visit sevengillsharksightings.org for instructions for uploading photos/videos, viewing videos in line for the database and the biology of sevengill sharks.\n\nYukon Marine Life Survey: this project is for Advanced divers who are certified to go below 100 ft, which is the depth of this artificial reef—a 366 ft. long former Canadian warship which was purchased and sunk by the City of San Diego in 2000. We use iNaturalist in this project as well: divers simply photograph any marine life they come across while diving on the wreck—vertebrates or invertebrates—and upload them to iNaturalist database at the conclusion of their dive.\n\nPacific Marine Mammal Center (PMMC): a non-profit organization staffed by volunteers whose mission is to rescue, treat, and rehabilitate marine mammals stranded on Orange County, California beaches then release healthy animals back to their natural habitat; and to increase public awareness of the marine environment through education and research.\n\nPRBO Conservation Science: Marine Ecology Division: PRBO’s Marine Ecology Division uses science to guide ocean ecosystem protection, conservation, and management. Projects focus on four key areas: 1) Ocean predators as bio-indicators of climate change and habitat quality. 2) Population dynamics, reproduction, and survival of seabird, marine mammal and white shark populations. 3) Life history characteristics: diet, feeding ecology, and energetic needs of seabirds in relation to marine fisheries and pollution. 4) Creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPA’s) and Marine Reserves (MRV’s) to protect ocean ecosystems.\n\nRestore America’s Estuaries: a non-profit whose mission is to preserve the nation’s network of estuaries by protecting and restoring the lands and waters essential to the richness and diversity of coastal life.\n\nSave the Manatee Club: to promote public awareness and education, fund manatee research, rescue and rehabilitate injured manatees, and lobby for the protection of manatees and their habitat.\n\nSea Turtle Conservancy: formerly known as the Caribbean Conservation Corporation, is the world’s oldest sea turtle research and conservation group. An international nonprofit 501(c) 3 organization, Sea Turtle Conservancy was founded in 1959 by world-renowned sea turtle expert Dr. Archie Carr to save sea turtles from eminent extinction through rigorous science-based conservation. Headquartered in Florida, the organization carries out worldwide programs to conserve and recover sea turtle populations through research, education, advocacy and protection of the natural habitats upon which depend upon. Over the course of nearly 60 years, Sea Turtle Conservancy’s research programs have yielded much of what is now known about sea turtles and the threats they face, and the organization is applying this knowledge to carry out the world’s most successful sea turtle protection and recovery programs.\n\nSeaturtle.org: dedicated to providing online resources and solutions in support of sea turtle conservation and research. Satellite Tracking Project provides real-time public access to the project with live maps of the turtles’ tracks provided online. Members of the public are invited to follow the movements of these turtles on a daily basis: “We have over 100,000 visits to our satellite tracking pages at http://www.seaturtle.org/tracking each month with the public marveling at the migratory endeavors of these amazing creatures.” Dr. Michael Coyne, Director of seaturtle.org and research scientist at Duke University.\n\nSea Watch | Dedicated to a Healthy Sea of Cortes: founded in 1993 by a small group of Americans and Mexicans disgusted with the destruction of fisheries in the Sea of Cortes. The following are their major accomplishments to date (click here).\n\nShark Research Institute (SRI): a US-based multi-disciplinary non-profit scientific research organization that sponsors and conducts research on sharks and promotes shark conservation. Whaleshark research is a large part of SRI and the public is invited to participate in SRI expeditions. SRI also maintains a database of shark attacks, and provides consultants to areas where attacks are clustered to determine the causes and to recommend environmentally sound solutions."
