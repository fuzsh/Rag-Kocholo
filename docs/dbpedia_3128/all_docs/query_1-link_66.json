This is the third Lifesaving World Championships I have had the honour of chairing and with the support of everyone involved, it is my goal to deliver the most inclusive, inspiring and best ever attended Lifesaving World Championships for your enjoyment.\n\nThe support offered by the Queensland Government, the City of Gold Coast and our important sponsors, will help make the Lifesaving World Championships 2024 a very memorable experience for our international visitors and all Australians who participate. The beauty and vast range of experiences available on the Gold Coast will make the visit very memorable for competitors, officials, their families and friends from around the World.\n\nOcean and beach events will be conducted on the pristine beach and parklands at Kurrawa, Broadbeach while all pool competition will be held in the city’s first-class Aquatic Centre at Southport. All meetings, functions and assemblies will be conducted in the Broadbeach precinct close to the beach and surrounded by a range of excellent accommodation and hospitality venues.\n\nIf you want to see the World’s best surf lifesavers in action including lifesavers from at least 50 nations and more than 7,000 competitors and officials, we invite you to come along. The Lifesaving World Championships have not been held in Queensland since 1988 and Surf Life Saving Queensland is doing everything to plan and deliver a world class event."
