HDS student organizations reflect the diversity of student needs and interests. Resources are given to those students with new ideas who would like to establish new groups, as well as to the further growth and development of existing groups. All student organizations register with the Office of Student Life on an annual basis. Current HDS students can find the paperwork to register a new organization on the Student Life page of my.hds.\n\nStudent Representation\n\nStudents at HDS have ample opportunity to influence this great community through a variety of leadership opportunities. Students are represented on every faculty search committee and most administrative committees. The HDS Student Association allocates funding for student groups and programming initiatives that it receives from collection of the student fee.\n\nThe HDS Student Association provides students a voice in the administrative and policymaking procedures of the School, and opportunities for social connection. It also facilitates discussion among students, staff, and faculty. The elected student officers meet monthly with the Dean to discuss student concerns and issues that affect the entire community and provide opportunities for conversation among students, faculty, and staff through roundtable discussions and Town Hall meetings.\n\nThe HDS Student Association can be reached via studentassociation@hds.harvard.edu.\n\nHDS Student Organizations\n\nFollowing is a list of student organizations currently registered for the 2022â€“23 academic year. While many organizations carry on from year to year, many new organizations form and others subside. As a courtesy to our student organization leaders, we maintain a policy of not publicizing or distributing their contact information, but all are happy to receive inquiries about their involvement here at HDS.\n\nRegistered student organizations wishing to create programming at HDS can use the Online Student Event Planning and Request Form found on the Student Life page of my.hds, to request program needs: funding, meeting space, A/V support, and so on."
