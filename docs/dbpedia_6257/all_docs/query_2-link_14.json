        "text": "NASHUA, N.H.- Join the Nashua Silver Knights on Saturday August 3rd as they help honor the Nashua Pride Baseball team, the longest tenured team to play at Holman Stadium. From 1998 to 2008, the Blue and Gold who called Holman home were a vital part of the city of Nashua and one of the most popular baseball teams in the area.\n\nAs we honor the team who played in the independent Atlantic League of Professional League and the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, come out to see many former Pride Staff players and staff as we celebrate the team’s 11-year history in Nashua.\n\nThe team was a place to play ball for many former big leaguers such as Brendan Donnelly, Dante Bichette, Rich “El Guapo” Garces, and Brian Daubach who dawned the Pride Jerseys over the years and even featured Olympic skier and New Hampshire native Bode Miller for a short stint.\n\nAs the Silver Knights prepare to officially retire the Pride at Holman Stadium, join us in celebrating one of the Gate City’s biggest attractions in a night full of family entertainment and exciting baseball.\n\nOn top of a great evening of baseball, it’s poster giveaway night, as the first 500 fans in attendance to Saturday’s game will receive a Butch Hobson poster, the Nashua Pride manager who coached from 2000 to 2007 and led the team to a 508-456 (.531) record.\n\nAs the Silver Knights wear special Nashua Pride throwback jerseys as part of Holman Stadium’s 75th Anniversary celebrations, come out to a great evening to remember a great team!\n\nTickets are still available by stopping by the ticket office, calling 603-718-8883, or visiting NashuaSilverKnights.com."
