        "text": "The Spartans are a junior drum corps from Nashua, New Hampshire. Founded in 1955, the Spartans is one of the most respected and established organizations in the activity today. The Spartans organization has an outstanding record in promoting youth involvement and participation, having attained numerous International Championships. The corps is a three time winner of the DCI Division II Championship (1997, 1998, and 2004).\n\nThe Spartans are not affiliated with any school or government sponsored group. They are a completely community based organization. The Spartans organization is run by a dedicated group of volunteer parents, and a professional teaching staff, who work in close harmony with all members to create and maintain a proud, responsible youth organization.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe corps was founded in 1955 By Albert Laflamme. The corps was originally founded as a way to keep at-risk youth off of the streets. The Spartan organization has remained under the Laflamme name for the duration of it's existence.\n\nSpartans have been Class A and Division II World Finalists in 1987, 89, 92, 95, 96, 99, 2001, 02, 03, 05, 06 and have been DCI Division II World Champions with first place victories in 1997, 1998, and 2004.\n\nMission[]\n\nThe Spartans mission is to offer young people quality educational and performance experiences in the area of performing arts. The corps provides a structured and positive learning environment for young people. The Spartans goal is to develop personal character through challenging physical, emotional, social and mental activities while promoting the values of dedication, hard work and commitment through a team effort.\n\nTraditions[]\n\nThe Spartans like their namesakes pride themselves in discipline. The stoic faces of the members while in uniform are proof of this concept. Several trademarks have become widely known fixtures in the Division 2 world. The Spartan helmet is unique within the division, and presents a strong appearance.\n\nThe Spartans also maintain a position that they are a place to learn. The staff is top notch, and you do not have to be a spectacular player to be a member of the corps. Members are also able to hold jobs until tour while being able to march in the corps. The flexibility allows many older members to have a life, and to succeed in an excellent organization.\n\nTrivia[]\n\n[]"
