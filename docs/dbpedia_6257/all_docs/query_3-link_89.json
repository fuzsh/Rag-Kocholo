        "text": "Will my son receive quality coaching?\n\nThe USPHL exists to move players to college hockey and the coaches are all highly regarded and respected within coaching circles. All of them have a wealth of experience in the game as both players and coaches. Most of all, they care about their players and work tirelessly to help them achieve their goals.\n\nWhat kind of training will my son have?\n\nPlayers in all USPHL teams will receive extensive on-ice training as well as a lengthy regular season schedule to further develop their skills. Additionally, the players participate in off-ice training to develop their strength, speed, and agility. The training programs are run by top-quality strength coaches and trainers and mirror those used by NHL and NCAA teams.\n\nWhat sort of medical care is available?\n\nEvery USPHL team has a full-time athletic trainer to care for any injuries that occur in practices or games. Clubs also rely on doctors to provide medical care and physical examinations to ensure the players’ health.\n\nWill my son have a good home environment?\n\nPlayers will be housed with teammates or families of younger players from the USPHL clubs’ youth programs. Great care will be taken to ensure a positive “home away from home” environment in the USPHL. Players are coming from around the country and the globe, so a positive living arrangement in a new home is vital to the transition into the USPHL.\n\n\"Our Billet player Tomi has been a wonderful addition to our Hockey loving family. This experience is one my young hockey players will never forget - A Big Brother they will miss when the season comes to an end. We are very proud to be a part of the Billet program, and the Palm Beach Hawks organization.\" -The Paradis Family\n\n“Jé is my hockey brother, can’t you tell we look alike!”\n\n\"Having Tyler stay with us has been so enjoyable. His friendly face and enthusiasm has made our experience as a Billet family wonderful. He blended in to our family and we consider him one of our own now.\" -The Miller Family\n\n\"As a first time billet family, our goal was to welcome a player who needed a home, and who could hopefully have a good relationship with our two teenage hockey player sons. Our experience has far surpassed our expectations. Orlando was almost instantly a part of our family, and it’s strange to think about what our house will be like without him. I can’t say enough about what a positive experience this has been. \" -The Klinsing Family\n\n\"“When hockey gives you another brother and he goes home for Christmas, our little girl loves and misses him and it’s only day 1 since he left. It has been a wonderful experience for all of us.\" -The Jendro Family\n\n\"We billet for Eric of the Minnesota Blue Ox. He is a great guy, helpful around the house, with our dog & our almost 9 month old. Reese is absolutely obsessed and gets so excited when Eric walks in the door. It’s great to be part of an organization that includes character and responsibility off the ice too.\" -The Ryan Family"
