        "text": "WESTON, Mass. – Regis College dropped a 1-0 decision to New England College on Wednesday night in non-conference women's soccer action in Weston, Mass. The Pride fall to 0-1-1 on the year, while the Pilgrims stay perfect at 3-0 in 2014. NEC's freshman duo of Jaycie Triandafilou (Newburyport, Mass.) and Sara Locke (Springfield, Vt.) connected for the lone goal of the game in the 47th minute of action.\n\nRegis had the first scoring chance of the day as Tais Salles (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) played a ball in the box that deflected off an NEC defender, leading to a Pride corner kick. Jackie Rocheville (Salem, Mass.) played a ball into the box that Hannah Bouvette (Mattapoisett, Mass.) got a head on, but the ball sailed wide of its mark.\n\nNew England College took control of the game with under 30 minutes to play in the half as a through ball was played to Lauren Smith (Nashua, N.H.). Smith juked the Regis keeper, and tried to slip a ball past Rachel Gagnon (Ashford, Conn.), but Bouvette was there to clear the ball and preserve the 0-0 tie. Nearly 16 minutes later, the ball was played into the box and Katie Hatch (Old Orchard Beach, Maine) received a one-touch pass for a shot, but Gagnon stoned her.\n\nWith less than a minute to play, Jaycie Triandafilou forced a turnover at the top of the box and blasted the ball on net. Gagnon made a sprawling save to her right, but the ball caromed out to Triandafilou. The freshman tried to go to the near post, but Gagnon got back on her line to make the save and make sure the game stayed 0-0 headed into the break.\n\nOnly two minutes into the second half, Locke raced down the left side for the Pilgrims. She played a low cross into the box that found Triandafilou, and she blasted the ball just inside the opposite post to put NEC on top 1-0.\n\nTais Salles (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) had a pair of chances to tie the game as she dribbled across the top of the box and fired shots on net, but one just missed the mark left, and the other was turned away by Tricia Sardagnola (Shrewsbury, Mass.). New England College nearly found an insurance goal in the 82nd minute as Ali Leizure (Washington, N.H.) received a through ball and tried to go opposite post, but Gagnon snared the ball out of the air to keep it a one goal game.\n\nUnfortunately for the Pride, they could not keep possession and could not get a final shot off in the last eight-plus minutes of action as NEC held on for the 1-0 victory.\n\nNew England College outshot the Pride at a 14-7 clip and held a 3-1 advantage in corner kicks. Tricia Sardagnola picked up her second shutout win of the year while making four saves. Rachel Gagnon suffered the setback while making nine stops.\n\nThe Pride return to action on Saturday afternoon when they travel to Mount Ida College for a1:00 p.m. matchup. NEC looks to move to 4-0 on Saturday when they travel to Wentworth for a 1:00 p.m. game."
