        "text": "Former Harwich High star and recent Wheaton College graduate Adam Laplante has signed a professional baseball contract with the Nashua, N.H., Pride of the Canadian-American Association.\n\nLaplante, a catcher, was expected to be in uniform last night when the Can-Am League season got under way with Nashua hosting North Shore in the opener of a four-game series at Holman Stadium.\n\nNashua is managed by former Boston Red Sox manager and player Butch Hobson. Among the players on the roster are Rich \"El Guapo\" Garces, a former pitcher with the Red Sox.\n\nLaplante recently ended his collegiate career on Harwich's Whitehouse Field, where he was a high school star with the Rough Riders. He led nationally ranked Wheaton into the NCAA Div. III New England Regional. The Lyons were knocked out in the semifinals.\n\nLaplante was named to the all-tournament team after batting .389 with six RBI in four games.\n\nThe Can-Am League is 10-team independent league with members in four states and one Canadian province. There are also teams in Brockton and Worcester."
