        "text": "NASHUA – The skyboxes still shadow the stands and the diamond, assuring that professional feel. They will mostly remain empty this summer, but Holman Stadium, while lacking professional baseball for the first time since 1997, will be anything but empty.\n\nIndeed, the schedule from now through Labor Day weekend has few, if any openings, filled by youth baseball a scattering of other events.\n\n“Isn’t it great?” said Alderman-At-Large David Dean, who spearheaded a group of a dozen or so on a committee formed by Nashua Mayor Donnalee Lozeau to explore ways to not only utilize the stadium throughout the spring and summer, but generating revenue so Holman could be maintained as it’s been since undergoing two rounds of renovations in the past dozen years.\n\n“We didn’t have to run out and court anybody, either. My position is that we don’t want to let that facility turn back into what it used to be (pre-Nashua Pride). We’ve spent too much time, energy and tax dollars.”\n\nThe committee’s final report, fee structure and potential sponsorship agreement terms are outlined on the city’s website (nashuanh.gov).\n\nAmong the amateur baseball events scheduled thus summer: The state American Legion Baseball Tournament (July 23-27), returning after an extended absence; the state Senior Babe Ruth tournament (July 17-20), and there will be several AAU baseball events. Also, with no professional team, the stadium will see an increase in regular season games for the city’s Senior Babe Ruth and Coffey Post American Legion teams.\n\nCurrently, as has been the case in the past, Bishop Guertin and Nashua High School North are playing the majority of their home games at Holman. Nashua South, which opts to play mainly on its own field, has three games there, versus Guertin, North and one versus Keene.\n\nClearly there are more dates available in the last couple of weeks of May than in the past. The high school Class L semifinals are scheduled at Holman, as usual, in the second week in June. Last year a rainout forced that event to be moved to Manchester.\n\nThere are more local baseball programs existing now than there were 15 years ago, giving the city no shortage of events to fill the stadium. But no rental fees are being charged to groups from youth baseball programs. For college-age teams and older, including Over-30 League baseball, the rental fees will start at $100 (day) and $150 (night), with an extra $25 charged for using the locker rooms.\n\nThe New Hampshire Men’s Over-30 League will have its All-Star game at Holman on July 14.\n\nSponsorship opportunities are outlined on the city website, deals that include outfield billboards use of the suites, but the suites would probably not be used for most youth baseball events, according to Dean. Right now, Nashua Park-Recreation Superintendent Nick Caggiano said, it appears about $8,000-10,000 has been raised in stadium rental fees, as some corporations are having outdoor events, and some colleges have booked dates in the facility in addition to locals Rivier and Daniel Webster. Franklin Pierce will hold a camp and Boston College has planned a four-day fall baseball tournament.\n\n“I challenged my staff, depending on what (sponsorships) we can sell, to try to get that $50,000 that would have been a pro team’s lease payment,” Caggiano said. “But we really have some exciting things going on. It was a great committee, they did a great job.”\n\nOne of the questions facing the committee was whether the stadium could be a venue for concerts. Lozeau said the city is working on trying to lure “a signature event” and a date has been kept open, Aug. 21. But Caggiano says the city was a little behind getting into the concert game.\n\n“We’ve been talking to some promoters, but we’re a little late,” he said. “We’d be talking about some type of soft rock, family-type event, something we could keep under control. Would it be someone recognizable? I wouldn’t think so, but it’s something we’re working on.”\n\nA couple of interesting baseball events linked to Lowell, Mass., will occur, one one of which could be the prelude for a major tenant in 2011. First, the Lowell Spinners short-season Single A Red Sox affiliate will hold a “Meet and Greet” clinic-type event on June 16, prior to the start of their season. There was talk of them holding some type of exhibition game, but according to Caggiano, minor league baseball’s territorial rules and liability factors scrapped that idea.\n\n“They want to do something for the community, for kids,” Caggiano said. “Have some players here, introduce them, let people in the community know what they’re about.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Lowell All-Americans of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer wooden bat circuit, will have three games at Holman, against NECBL New Hampshire entries Laconia and Keene, and an exhibition against a Canadian National Team. There’s been speculation that the franchise might be interested in re-locating all of its 21 home games to Nashua, perhaps as early as next year, but team owner and president Harry Ayotte wouldn’t address that possibility directly.\n\n“I’ve always enjoyed Nashua,” said Ayotte, a longtime Lowell area baseball figure who was the field manager for the ill-fated independent Nashua Hawks in 1995 and part of ’96. “We love to play up at Holman Stadium. Whether we go there or not, if anyone were, it would be the greatest venue in the league.”\n\nThere is one different non-baseball athletic event scheduled, a Police Athletic League Boxing tournament for late August. The stadium’s entire schedule of events, running from now through early September, can be found on the Park-Recreation Department’s website.\n\n“We put all the wheels in motion for the baseball events,” Dean said of the committee, which included local high school and college athletic officials, youth baseball officials, city and business leaders, including former Pride owner John Stabile. “We were focusing on covering the maintenance and operating costs.”\n\n“I thought it was good, the mayor tried to get a good cross-section of the community,” Rivier athletic director Joanne Merrill said. “The charge of the committee was that this was really a city gem. There was also some ‘think outside the box’ as what else in the summer can it be used for when youth things are essentially done (by early August). The main thing was looking at it as a city asset and how best to use it.”\n\nAs for the offices that were built for the Pride during the 2001 renovation, located above the right field concession stand, for now they will remain vacant, although Lozeau said she’s toying with the idea of having them become the Park-Rec Dept.’s home.\n\n“And one other thing is that we could use the ticket office as a city-wide ticket booth for city events,’’ Lozeau said.\n\nOne step at a time, says Lozeau, who believes that the city will certainly be without any professional baseball for the foreseeable future.\n\n“Not as long as there are teams in Lowell and Manchester,” she said. “Right now I think the concentration is to have a beautiful stadium that is self-sustaining. I wouldn’t ask for anything more than that.”\n\nNewsletter"
