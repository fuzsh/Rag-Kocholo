        "text": "April 21, 2008 – Tim Drew Talks April 21, 2008\n\nPosted by atlanticleaguenews in Uncategorized.\n\ntrackback\n\nNot How He Drew It Up: What is your definition of hanging out?\n\nFor many ballplayers, it could be sitting around in the hotel room.\n\nMaybe it’s going to the local bar or restaurant after the game and having a cold one.\n\nCould be playing cards with some teammates.\n\nBut when I spoke to Bridgeport’s Tim Drew a few days ago, he said he was “hanging out at a Christian bookstore” when I originally called.\n\nThat may start to explain how while some players loathe the Atlantic League experience, the former big leaguer said he’s taken this opportunity as a blessing.\n\n“I’m looking forward to sharing my experience with guys who might not have the amount of experience I do,” he said.\n\nThis is the 10th professional season for the 29-year-old righty, and he’s made three different stops at the big league level: Atlanta, Cleveland and Montreal.\n\nSomewhat unfortunately, independent baseball has become a family affair for the Drew brothers. J.D. elected to play in the Northern League after being drafted, and Stephen did something similar with the Camden Riversharks before eventually signing with the Diamondbacks.\n\nBut for Tim Drew, a January 2006 surgery to repair a torn labrum made the indy circuit a necessity, not a convenient option as it had been for his brothers.\n\nOut of affiliated baseball for the first time in his career, Drew signed on with Aiken of the now-defunct South Coast League last season and made 13 starts, going 4-5 with a 5.10 ERA.\n\n“The game doesn’t really change too much from one stop to another,” said Drew of playing in the league.\n\n“My shoulder was around 80 percent, I was still trying to gain some arm strength then.”\n\nAfter speaking to his brother Stephen about the Atlantic League, he got in touch with Bluefish manager Tommy John, whom he had gotten to know while in the Expos organization.\n\nWith the Georgia native no longer having a “hometown league” to play in, he decided to head up north and sign a contract to play with Bridgeport. The strength of his surgically repaired shoulder will play a large role in how successful the choice was.\n\n“I feel a little better than I did last year,” he said.\n\n“If I get picked up, great. If I don’t, I think I’ll probably retire.”\n\nDrew told me that he faced live hitters for the first time since last season on Friday, saying he “wasn’t that great, wasn’t that bad.”\n\n“Mechanically, there’s some things that need to be ironed out,” he said.\n\nDrew hopes to provide a veteran presence to a team that was one game away from making the Atlantic League playoffs last season. So far, he likes their chances of a trip to the postseason.\n\n“I think our team’s pretty solid,” Drew said.\n\n“We’ve got a good group of younger guys, and a good mix of older guys as well.”\n\nNow at the lowest rung of the baseball ladder, and four years removed from wearing a big league uniform, the closest he may get to putting on another one may be memories from games past.\n\n“My most memorable (big league moment) would have to be being in Atlanta with my brother (J.D.),” he said.\n\n“It was just a phenomenal time for both of us, and something I’ll never forget. Now, I hope I can get back up there with Stephen, too.”\n\nIndependent baseball served its purpose for both J.D and Stephen Drew.\n\nThe story of whether Tim can follow in their footsteps and make memories a reality will start to unfold this Friday.\n\nHe’s Just Good: Newark’s Mike Just went 5-for-5 in the Bears 7-2 win over the Somerset Patriots yesterday. Spring training or not, that’s impressive.\n\nBut that was the score after the game ended after the teams played into the top of the 11th.\n\nAfter the top of the 9th, when the game should have ended, the Patriots had shut out the Bears, 2-0.\n\nTechnically, Casey Cahill, who actually threw the first pitch at Healthquest Park as a high schooler, would have been credited with the save.\n\nBut the teams played on, and Bo Donaldson probably wished they hadn’t. The former Padres farmhand was knocked around in the 10th inning, allowing six runs on six hits and a walk.\n\nBobby Hill hit a home run to right center field, and then Cory Aldridge hit a bomb that would have been out of any ballpark to right field later in the inning. He knew he got it — he watched it quickly depart the stadium for a brief second — but so did everybody else. There was some audible “oohing and ahing” from the crowd.\n\nDonaldson faced nine batters in the inning, before it was ended with only two outs. Sitting about 10-15 feet away from home plate, it looked like his pitches didn’t have a lot of velocity, and he started trying to overthrow his fastball once he got into trouble.\n\n—\n\nBOX SCORE (Includes all 10 1/2 innings)\n\nBears\n\nJust: 5-5, R, RBI, SB\n\nHill: 1-4, R, HR, 2 RBI, BB\n\nReed: 1-3, R, 2 BB\n\nMajewski: 1-5, R, H\n\nAldridge: 2-5, 2 R, 2B, HR, 3 RBI, K\n\nBurgamy: 1-4, BB\n\nHaran: 1-4, K\n\nPachot: 0-5\n\nGutierrez: 0-3, K\n\nT.

The starter for the game in Newark on Saturday was Michael Bumstead, not Matt Sweeney. So just credit Sweeney’s stats I listed to Bumstead.\n\nRather embarassing when you go to the manager and ask why Sweeney is pitching again, only to find that out.\n\nChris Rubio isn’t listed on Newark’s spring training roster, but he pitched rather well in the late innings. The 23-year-old righty pitched for Slippery Rock of the Frontier League last year, and struck out four batters in two innings of work yesterday.\n\nThe Bears — well, more specifically Jim Cerny — have shown a knack for bringing in guys that next to nobody has ever heard of and getting the best out of them.\n\nMy educated guess is that the Patriots cut two pitchers and two position players. I have my guesses, but there doesn’t seem to be any sort of consensus just yet.\n\nBrandon Knight took a line drive off of his palm during his third inning of work, but came out for a fourth and pitched well. Brett Jodie told me Knight was OK after the game.\n\nSeems pretty clear that Knight will be the team’s opening day starter.\n\nMichael Ryan was not with Somerset, staying back at the hotel because he was sick.\n\nPete Moore served as the Patriots pinch runner a minimum of five times in the game.\n\nPatriots staffer Mike Desmond made his professional P.A. debut after two years of doing games at Stockton.\n\nReal nice turnout for the game…maybe 150-200 people were there. Seems like a lot of the kids there really took to Elliott Ayala.\n\nContrary to popular belief, noted country music enthusiast Travis Anderson did not provide the music for the game…instead, the honor went to Immaculata coach Tom Gambino, who went with a wide array of country music, including Rascal Flatts, Carrie Underwood and Josh Turner.\n\nOutside of some Trace Adkins being mixed in there, I was OK with all the choices…\n\nBlame/thank Scott Stanchak for getting me into country music, by the way. All his fault.\n\nAshmore Photo Gallery:\n\nJoe Welsh\n\nMatt Sweeney\n\nChris Rubio\n\nKeith Reed\n\nDavid Pellegrine\n\nJohn Pachot\n\nVal Majewski\n\nBrandon Larson\n\nScott Knazek\n\nSteve Kelly\n\nDavid Housel\n\nBobby Hill\n\nCasey Cahill\n\nJason Belcher\n\nBenito Baez\n\nElliott Ayala and Gerard Haran\n\nJodie Happy With Pitching Staff: Here’s some quotes from Patriots pitching coach and director of player procurement Brett Jodie:\n\nThoughts on the pitching staff…\n\n“I thought (the pitching staff) looked pretty good. They stayed ahead of hitters, all around it was pretty good. Knight looked really good, Steve Kelly I thought looked better than last time. Relievers did well. Bo didn’t have a real sharp outing, but the first time he pitched in a long time was the other day, so there might have been some lingering effects from the other day. I kind of expected that, but other than that, I thought it went well.”\n\nOn if he has an idea of what the roster will look like…\n\n“Every day you’re evaluating. Things become a little bit more clear the more you play. Obviously if you had another week, it becomes easier. We’ve got an idea right now. We talk about it pretty much every day, and we’re going to have to make a decision probably Tuesday.”\n\nOn what a position player on the bubble can do at this point in camp…\n\n“Look at what that Just kid did for them. Something like that, you do that…look at Elliott (Ayala), it’s not like he was on the bubble last year or anything, but he had a heck of a spring, and if he would have been on the bubble, he would have made the team. You’ve just got to show yourself. (Matt) Hagen’s been taking some great swings out there, I think. It looks like he’s on the baseball, and it looks like he can play some different positions and has been showing some things. That’s what you look for.”\n\nOn what a pitcher on the bubble can do…\n\n“For a pitcher, the number one thing for me is throwing strikes. The fact that we can put you in and you can throw strikes and have a chance to get somebody out. I don’t care if you get hit or give up a few runs, I’d rather see people throwing strikes. If they had a bad outing, but then they adjust and have a good one, I look for that too.”\n\nSomer-Stats: I may literally be the only person on Earth with all the box scores from the Patriots intra-squad games and exhibition games against the Bears from the past few days. There’s a certain mixture of pride and sadness that comes with that distinction.\n\nAnyway, sarcasm aside, let’s move to the semi-serious matter of posting the Patriots combined stats from those past four games. As I said, I have my guesses as to who stays and who goes — if there are cuts, see the news item a few blurbs below — and perhaps this will help you formulate your own opinions if you haven’t been fortunate enough to stop by and see the team.\n\nThese stats do not include the innings played after the regulation part of the game had ended on Saturday in Newark.\n\nDuncan: 3-11, R, HR, 3 RBI, BB, 2 K\n\nF. Moore: 3-11, BB\n\nRyan: 1-6, 2 BB\n\nAlvarez: 1-10, 2B, 3 K\n\nHagen: 2-7, R, 2B\n\nLarson: 2-11, HR, RBI, 3 K\n\nPressley: 4-11, BB, 2 K\n\nChiaravalloti: 3-9, HR, RBI, 3 BB, 3 K\n\nOlivares: 0-7, R, BB\n\nBelcher: 5-7, R, 2B, HR, RBI\n\nAyala: 3-10, BB, 4 K\n\nP.

He became a private investigator, and made headlines in 2005 for his arrest for allegedly firing a gun in a fight.\n\nThe former Red Sox draft pick had some great moments in a Patriots uniform, and I’ll be curious to see if he breaks camp with the team after five years away from the game.\n\nMateo To Mexico: With INF Randall Simon expected to join the team by today, it’s worth noting that the Bears have also lost a player. Bears manager Wayne Krenchicki told me yesterday that OF Ruben Mateo informed the team on Saturday that he would be leaving to play in Mexico.\n\nIn all likelihood, that opens up a starting spot for Val Majewski. In talking to several Bears players about this, they agreed with my assessment that it says a lot about their team and the league that a spot needed to open for someone of Majewski’s caliber to find a spot.\n\n27-28 Player Rosters?: Jason Guarente is reporting that the Atlantic League may allow teams to carry 27-28 players for evaluation purposes early in the season.\n\nI had heard some rumblings about this just yesterday, but didn’t expect it to be implemented as quickly as it may be. For some teams, this may be a welcomed change. For others, paying 23-24 guys was enough of a challenge.\n\nMy opinion? Why even have spring training if you’re going to use the beginning of the year to evaluate guys? Isn’t that what spring training is for?\n\nGuarente also writes that former Patriots P Robert Averette, who — like many of his teammates during that 2006 season — left Somerset due to “personal reasons,” was offered a tryout by the Barnstormers.\n\nMyette To Start Opening Day: Jim Seip reports that Aaron Myette is York’s likely Opening Day starter.\n\nIn another post, he writes that Tyler Von Schell has joined the team after all…\n\nBobby Darula, Actor: I was having a conversation with friend and Patriots radio broadcaster Brian Bender about a week ago, and he mentioned that he saw a commercial starring Bridgeport’s Bobby Darula, clad in a Bluefish uniform.\n\nSo I checked up on it with Bridgeport’s excellent PR man Nick Razzette, and it turns out it’s true. Darula, along with teammates Sean Fesh and Angel Espada, did a spot for “Certain Dri Feet,” which is apparently some sort of foot powder.\n\nIf anyone can throw this or any of Sparky Lyle’s old Miller Lite ads on YouTube, I’d love to see it…\n\nBonds Update: The guys over at Minor League Dugout — the guy who runs the site is actually the brother of former Atlantic Leaguer Brad King, believe it or not — have a paragraph about how Joe Klein offered Barry Bonds the opportunity to work out at Atlantic League spring training.\n\nI wrote this thing into the ground a few weeks back, but it’s interesting that Klein did actually get in touch with Bonds and a seemingly formal offer was made.\n\nThere was some buzz around the ballpark yesterday about Frank Thomas being released.\n\nMaybe him, Mike Piazza, Sammy Sosa and Bonds can all get together and turn the Ducks into a big league All-Star team.\n\nAbreu In Nashua: This was mentioned in the comments a few days back, but I was catching up on some reading and wanted to point you towards Tom King’s article in The Nashua Telegraph about long-time Camden OF Denny Abreu signing with the Nashua Pride.\n\nInterview Schedule: Scott’s got York’s Corey Thurman for you Tuesday, while I’ve got Southern Maryland’s Adam Johnson later this week. – Mike Ashmore\n\nChanges In The Barn: The Lancaster Barnstormers have released P Derek Forbes today. Not surprising considering he gave up 10 runs in less than two innings on Friday."
