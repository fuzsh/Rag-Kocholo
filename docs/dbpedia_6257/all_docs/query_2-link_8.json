        "text": "The stadium is surrounded by tall Pine Trees. I thought the seating was a bit far from the field (the seats are from old Fulton County Stadium). There are no covered seats at all, and no SkyBoxes. There are bleachers down the LF line, but they face straight out, so you have to sit on an angle to see the game. The food stands are located outside the seating area so if you get something to eat you miss some of the game. Actually, they are not stands at all but more like the food trailers you would find at a carnival. I could have done without the between inning antics, dizzy bat race, race the mascot and the dancing Monkey Boy. For a park that looks totally outdated in a league of sparkling new parks Holman has a real minor league feel to it.\n\nStadium Rating : A-"
