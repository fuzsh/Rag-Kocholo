        "text": "Archives: May 20-26, 2007\n\nAnnouncement on Reno’s Triple-A team delayed Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nPacific Coast League President Branch Rickey says there’s no hitch in the preliminary deal to bring a Triple-A baseball team to Washoe County in Nevada, although there won’t be an official announcement of the purchase for at least two weeks. The Washoe County Commission approved a pre-development and finance agreement on May 15 with SK Baseball and Nevada Land for the design and construction of a stadium, and SK Baseball’s Jerry Katzoff said he hoped to identify the franchise that would be moved to Washoe County for the 2009 season in a news conference this week in the city where the team is currently playing. Sales and announcements always take longer than many would like, so this isn’t a total surprise. The speculation has centered on the team being the Tucson Sidewinders, where owner Jay Zucker has denied the team is on the market; one surprising name has been floated by some insiders, however.\n\nNew for 2007: Rent One Park Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe Southern Illinois Miners (independent; Frontier League) will open their home history in a new ballpark with a new name: Rent One Park. The team sold naming rights to the new ballpark to a Southern Illinois business that rents and sells appliances, furniture and computers. Although financial terms were not made available, it was revealed that Rent One owner Larry Carrico has agreed to a 10-year contract with the team. In addition to the naming rights, the Rent One logo will be included on signage inside the stadium and be included on team merchandise.\n\nCity: Damaschke Field to be ready Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nRenovations to Damaschke Field are nearing completion, and the ballpark is expected to be ready for the home opener of the Oneonta Tigers (short season; NY-Penn League) on June 22. Contractors on Thursday, working on new first-base line bleachers, used a small crane to lift aluminum flooring into position. At the opposite end of the ballpark, a separate set of workers leveled an area to where the old first-base line bleachers will be moved, replacing wooden bleachers. Other workers applied finishing touches to the inside of a new clubhouse and concession stand.\n\nGiambi case turned over to Selig Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nCommissioner Bud Selig likely will decide within a week or two exactly what to do, if anything, with Jason Giambi. The New York Yankees designated hitter was questioned Wednesday by management lawyers for recent comments in USA Today that could have been interpreted as an admission of steroids use. Selig probably will issue a statement even if he doesn’t discipline Giambi, a baseball official familiar with the process said Thursday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the parties involved agreed not to discuss the matter publicly while Selig is deliberating. What likely will happen: Giambi will be publicly rebuked but not suspended.\n\nNew facilities in Vipers’ plans Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nWith amateur sports struggling to find space, the Calgary Vipers (independent; Northern League) are stepping up with plans to build a pair of indoor practice facilities near their ballpark. City council Monday will be asked to extend the team’s lease at Foothills Stadium and allow them to acquire an additional 3.8 hectares to build two training facilities that will primarily be used by amateur athletes. If council approves the amended lease, the Vipers will begin building a 16,000-sq.-ft. indoor practice facility for baseball as soon as possible, while a similar sized structure that will accommodate indoor soccer and lacrosse would likely begin construction in October. Each facility will cost the club between $1.4 million and $1.6 million.\n\nTake me out to the baggage check Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nWith Major League teams sticking to policies regarding the size of carry-ons allowed in the ballpark — they must be softsided and no larger than 16x16x8 — some entrepreneurs are addressing the issue of what fans do with cases that aren’t allowed in. In the case of Ball Park Lanes on River Avenue, they’re offering a luggage-check service: for $5 Yankees fans can store their luggage during the game at Yankee Stadium.\n\nPride working hard to make sure 10th season not last Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe Nashua Pride (independent; Can-Am Association) drew 1,852 fans to their home opener at Holman Stadium, a pretty decent number bolstered by a good walk-up crowd. The Pride installed a new beer garden, which will help, and the long-awaited presence of Rich Garces (delayed by visa issues) will be a boost as well. Pride chief operating officer Jim Stabile said he wanted to see 8,000 fans come through the turnstiles for the four-game series against the Spirit that runs through Sunday. The weather, long an enemy of the Pride in its previous nine seasons, should be a strong ally, with 95-degree temperatures expected today. More from the Nashua Telegraph.\n\nNew ideas for old ballpark Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe future of Durham Athletic Park — the original home of the Durham Bulls when that team was a fixture in the Carolina League — was discussed yesterday by Durham City Council members. Mayor Bill Bell says Minor League Baseball officials are enthusiastic about placing a museum at a renovated Durham Athletic Park, while also using the facility as a school for minor-league support staff. There are three plans on the table for renovating the venerable old ballpark; $4 million bond-backed funding is available. North Carolina Central University hopes to be playing there next spring as well, and it would be great if the current Durham Bulls (Class AAA; International League) played a game there each season, perhaps against a traditional foe like Charlotte.\n\nSome new ideas for Cubs’ old house Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe assumption here is that Wrigley Field will need to be updated by the next owners of the Chicago Cubs and the ballpark once the sale by the Tribune Company is final. We’re not so sure: the team has already undertaken some subtle yet effective renovations the past few years, and the rest of the renovation –which includes a new parking ramp, team office and Cubs museum — remains on the drawing boards, ready for implementation. The ideas here basically follow the Fenway Park model: rooftop seating, the closing of streets around the ballpark a la Yawkey Way, Jumbotrons on surrounding buildings and tapes music (as opposed to the organ music).\n\nCrowds enjoy first ‘Hounds home game Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe Aiken Foxhounds (independent; South Coast League) opened their inaugural season last night with a crowd of 1,785 at Roberto Hernandez Stadium, and the crowd seems to enjoy the festivities. (They also saw the home team win a 12-inning thriller, 11-10 over the Anderson Joes, with Jeff Timmons homering off Will Krout for the winning run.) The South Georgia Peanuts had a bigger opening, with 3,270 fans in attendance. So far attendance averages are mostly respectable for a startup league: South Georgia at 3,270, Macon at 2,503, Aiken at 1,785, Charlotte County at 1,204, and Anderson at 700. (Bradenton has yet to play a home game and opens tonight.) More from the Augusta Chronicle and the Anderson Independent Mail.\n\nChew on this: All you can eat at Dodger Stadium Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nMore on the all-you-can-gorge pavilion section in Dodger Stadium for Los Angeles Dodgers games. The Dodgers certainly have struck a nerve with the plan by filling some marginally popular seats, cleverly selling Old Buffet food at MLB prices. The Dodgers say the section has sold out eight times in 24 home games, with attendance averaging 2,000 in the 3,000 seats. Some other MLB teams, including Milwaukee, have discussed doing something similar next season, but turn loose some of those Brewers fans at a buffet and you run the risk of bankrupting the team.\n\nSummer’s here, it’s Skyhawks time Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nAlso opening last night: the Sussex County Skyhawks (independent; Can-Am Association), whose first season at Skylands Park wasn’t quite as successful as team officials anticipated. A crowd of 2,680 was on hand to see the Skyhawks take on the New Jersey Jackals (the Jackals would prevail in 10, 3-2); the team is shooting for an improvement over last season’s average of 2,183, and new business practices — like offering free parking — should help.\n\nBowling returns to Miller Park Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nIf there’s one major-league ballpark where you’d expect to see bowling, it’s Milwaukee’s Miller Park. And so you shall: On Oct. 28 the United States Bowling Congress Masters will take place at Miller Park with ESPN providing television coverage of the finals. Four lanes will be constructed primarily along the infield dirt from short right field to second base, a process which will take workers approximately 48 hours to install the lane set-up. In October of 2004, Miller Park also served as the site of the Masters finals.\n\nRainiers fire Lewis Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe new owners of the Tacoma Rainiers (Class AAA; Pacific Coast League) have parted ways with longtime GM Dave Lewis. President of Schlegel Sports Group Mike McCall informed Lewis of the decision Thursday morning. \"I just felt that where we need to go and what we need done in the next few years we needed to put someone in place who’s familiar with the ticket sales, sponsorship and game entertainment blue print we want to use,\" McCall said. \"I think Dave understands that.\" Lewis has been offered another post within the organization.\n\n2007 Mets ticket sales surpass 3 million Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe New York Mets today announced that they have surpassed 3,000,000 in ticket sales for the 2007 season at Shea Stadium, marking the earliest time since 1989 that the Mets have exceeded 3 million tickets sold. By comparison, the Mets reached the same benchmark last year on July 5. To date, the Mets have had five sellouts and nine crowds in excess of 50,000.\n\nChasing her dream job Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nGood for her. When the Tarrant County Blue Thunder (independent; Continental Baseball League) begins its season tonight at Cross Timbers Ballpark in Fort Worth, Michala Perreault will be there as the team’s announcer. After jobs in computer consulting and naturopathic healing, Perreault set her sights last year on a long-abandoned goal to become a baseball announcer. Her efforts began in August with a two-day apprenticeship with announcers for the Fort Worth Cats (independent; American Association), arranged by Vocation Vacations, a company that helps clients get a taste of careers in different industries.\n\nSuit makes a wreck of personal responsibility Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nJosh Hancock’s family has filed suit against Mike Shannon’s restaurant, alleging the bar served him too much alcohol, leading to his death. The opinion of Post-Dispatch columnist Bryan Burwell is that Hancock bears all the responsibility: this is \"the story of a 29-year-old man who was drunk, speeding, had a tin of marijuana in the front seat, was driving without his seat belt buckled, was talking on a cell phone, and who failed to brake before he barreled into this flatbed with the emergency lights flashing.\"\n\nBoston College buys land from Archdiocese, plans new ballpark Posted May 25, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston announced a $65 million deal yesterday to sell its administrative headquarters in Brighton to Boston College to complete a money-saving move to the suburbs. Boston College since 2004 has bought 46 acres of archdiocese property in Brighton for a total of about $107 million, including the ornate bishop’s mansion. The college plans to build dormitories, a ballpark and a residence for 70 to 90 Jesuits.\n\nCharles County approves bid for new AtL ballpark Posted May 24, 2007 (feedback) (submit story) (discuss)\n\nCharles County (Md.) commissioners cleared the way yesterday for pro baseball next spring, voting unanimously to accept a $19-million bid for construction of a new ballpark for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs (independent; Atlantic League). The ballpark, which will be built on the southern edge of Waldorf, carries a total price tag of $25.65 million, more than the county’s stated $21 million budget for the project. But county officials said that they need to accommodate the rise in construction costs since that budget was set last year and that they are confident that revenue from the stadium will cover nearly all county expenses. Charles County will pay about one-third of the cost of the 4,500-seat ballpark (a rendering is shown below) — $8.5 million — with an equal amount coming from the team’s owner, Maryland Baseball LLC. The state’s share will be about $8.7 million. The General Assembly had committed to paying $7 million, but local officials said they have informed the county’s delegation that the project will need more money.

Wednesday’s attendance is the highest total in Waterfront Park history, passing the 8,729 fans who watched the Thunder vs. the New Haven Ravens game on May 10, 2003 that featured Yankee SS Derek Jeter on a rehabilitation assignment. \"What an incredible night,\" said Thunder General Manger Brad Taylor. \"Once again Thunder fans proved that they are the best fans anywhere. Everyone who was here tonight will have a great memory to last a lifetime. We are truly grateful to be the Yankees’ Double A Affiliate.\""
