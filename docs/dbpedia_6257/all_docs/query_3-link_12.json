        "text": "Leading off, consider a news brief that features a team that no longer exists and a school that faded into oblivion.\n\nIt still annoys at least one University of New Hampshire grad that it dropped its baseball program in 1998. This represents an improved attitude for that disgruntled alum. He no longer responds to fundraising mail by sending the letter back with a scrawled plea to bring back baseball.\n\nAPRIL 24, 1951: “Former Nashua American Legion junior baseball star pitcher Pinky Johnson has been named by UNH baseball coach Hank Swazey to work the Wildcats’ opener against Lowell Textile at Brackett Field this afternoon.”\n\nNote: Lowell Textile has long since merged into a program as part of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.\n\nAPRIL 25, 1961: “Ray Brooks posted a 69 to win the holiday weekend Riverside Golf Club’s handicap tournament, topping a field of 103 entries.\n\n“Second low gross in the first division went to Ray Devlin, 73. Net winners: Armand Wallace, 75-66, and Adrian Zing, 75-66.”\n\nAPRIL 26, 1971: “Paul Malenfant’s 3-0 no-hitter against Dover highlighted a pair of season-opening Nashua High victories over the weekend, including an 11-8 decision at Manchester Central.\n\n“… The Panther southpaw was untouchable as he overpowered Dover batters with ease. He struck out 10 men while walking only two.”\n\nAPRIL 27, 1981: “Alvirne High School finished fourth in a girls track and field meet hosted by Winnacunnet High School in Hampton.\n\n“… Jana Cloutier was the 7-7 Broncos top performer. She was second in two events, the discus (20.57 meters) and shot put (7.57 meters). Valerie McNay was second in the long jump (5 meters).”\n\nAPRIL 28, 2001: “Kyle Jackson struck out six Red Raider batters over five innings and helped himself with two hits at the plate as the Broncos blanked Spaulding.\n\n“Jackson, now 3-0, was brilliant on the mound allowing only a bloop single in the fourth inning. Alvirne’s Jason Weaver had two hits, including a two-run home run, two runs scored and three RBIs; Bobby Tewksbary with a solo homer, two doubles and three runs scored and Jim McGrath making his first varsity start in left field with two hits, including a solo shot and two RBIs.”\n\nAPRIL 29, 2006: “The never-dull saga of the Nashua Pride took another surprising turn on Friday. With less than a month before Opening Night, the front office underwent another shakeup, including the resignation of general manager Marty Wheeler. In his place Jim Stabile, 32, the nephew of first-year team owner John Stabile, was named interim general manager and player acquisitions adviser Chris Hall joined the club in a full-time capacity as director of baseball operations.\n\n” ‘I didn’t want (Wheeler) to leave,” the elder Stabile said. “But he really didn’t want to be here. He told me, ‘I just wasn’t getting it done.’ “\n\nAPRIL 30, 2011: “The mercy rule was in effect as Campbell’s Conor Sahlin had his way with Derryfield batters, allowing only one hit while striking out eight in four innings of work in the Cougars’ 12-1 win. Travis Manning and Tyler Coughlin each went 2-for-2 with a pair of RBIs for Campbell.”\n\nNewsletter"
