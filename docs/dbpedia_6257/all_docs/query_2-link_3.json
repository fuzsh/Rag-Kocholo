        "text": "The Nashua Pride, a Canadian-American Independent league team, plays at historic Holman Stadium. The stadium was built in 1937 and received major upgrades in 1998 and 2002. This is the location where Branch Rickey continued the desegregation of baseball when he assigned Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe to the Single A Dodgers team in 1946. The Pride was playing the Brockton Rox and won 1-0 in the bottom of the 7th with the bases loaded and two outs a single between 1st and 2nd won the game. The box score was Rox R-0, H-4, E-0 and Pride R-1, H-10, E-0. Very interesting field lines especially in right field. RF down the line is 315' which move quickly out to 354' then to 380' and back to RC at 376', CF-401', LC-358' and a short LF-307' with a low 4' wall. Midway down the 3rd baseline and back a little ways is the football announcing booth, dark green, as at one time football was played on the same field. The game we saw was the first 7 inning game of a double-header. You can stand right by and behind the Pride bullpen. We stayed for the first two innings of the second game and saw the Pride fall behind 3-2. The Rox bunted on the first three batters in the first inning and scored 4 runs before getting their 3 outs. The mascot is Shag. Soda Pop and Lollipop are the official clowns of the Pride. William Hung from American Idol \"sang\" between the games and after the second inning of the second game. Sitting in front of us was a couple from California who have visited many baseball fields as he travels for business reasons. Roberto was able to give us many tips about some places we haven't yet seen. He knows the specialty food items from all the fields they have visited. 2009 New name and logo. 2011 team disbanded."
