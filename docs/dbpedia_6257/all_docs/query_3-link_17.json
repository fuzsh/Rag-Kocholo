        "text": "Archives: Jan. 1-Jan. 7, 2005\n\nKirk continues to court independent, affiliated teams for Charles County Posted January 7, 2005Peter Kirk, chairman of Maryland Baseball LLC, confirmed he received conditional approval from the independent Atlantic League to launch a new franchise at a new Charles County ballpark, but he’ll continue to seek an affiliated team to play at the $18-million ballpark. Kirk’s group owns a full or partial stake in three Atlantic League clubs — the Camden Riversharks, the Nashua Pride and the Lancaster Barnstormers — and is also seeking to place an Atlantic League franchise in York, Pa. However, Kirk says teams in the Class AAA International League, Class AA Eastern League and Class A Carolina League and Sally League remain possibilities to lease a ballpark. (An affiliated team in Charles County is problematic; it would appear to be covered by territorial rights from other MLB and MiLB teams.) The future of the ballpark is also in doubt: an effort to gain $6 million in state funding is stalled in the Maryland General Assembly.\n\nAurora steps to the plate for a swing at the minors Posted January 7, 2005The independent Central Baseball League — traditionally centered in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi — is moving westward, as league officials look at placing a team in Aurora, the third-largest city in Colorado. If all goes as planned, construction of a 4,500-seat privately financed ballpark near Buckley will begin this spring, and the team will start playing in 2006. More from the Rocky Mountain News.\n\nFlorence Freedom on track with new lease Posted January 7, 2005The new owner of the Florence Freedom (independent; Frontier League), Clint Brown, signed a new lease for Champion Window Field after paying $1.3 million to pay off contractors with liens against the ballpark. As part of the deal approved in U.S. Bankruptcy Court last month, Brown’s $1.3 million and $600,000 from the city will be put into a fund for the contractors. Most of the legal uncertainty surrounding the team is now resolved, although a lawsuit against former owner Chuck Hildebrant will continue. Brown has agreed to spend: $800,000 to finish the ballpark and build a sign, $300,000 for a video scoreboard and $100,000 for equipment and furnishings.\n\nDuPuy, Angelos meet; no deal Posted January 7, 2005MLB President Robert DuPuy met with Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos yesterday to discuss some sort of financial settlement regarding the move of the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C. The sides have been negotiating since late September, when Angelos — who bitterly opposed a second major league team just 40 miles away — said he might be persuaded to accept the move if a deal were struck to protect his franchise and the state’s investment in Oriole Park. D.C. was never part of Baltimore’s territory, so Angelos doesn’t have a lot of negotiating leverage, though he is reportedly is preparing a lawsuit (probably alleging a diminished valuation of the team) should talks break down.\n\nRichmond Braves’ home ready Posted January 7, 2005As you’ll recall, the end of last season was a bad time for the Richmond Braves (Class AAA; International League), as several games at The Diamond were postponed or moved because of problems with the field. Repairs to the field are now complete: After correcting a grade difference of almost two feet in the outfield, trucking in more than 100 loads of dirt, blending sand and another substance with the existing soil, installing more than a mile of drainage pipe and putting down 2.3 acres of new sod, the makeover was pronounced basically complete yesterday by the Richmond Metropolitan Authority.\n\nLas Vegas mayor says developer helps bid for big-league ballpark Posted January 7, 2005The city of Las Vegas signed a deal with real-estate developer The Related Cos. to develop 61 acres near downtown Vegas. The contract specifies that Related develop plans for the site would include some combination of a ballpark, hotel-casino, condominium tower, retail stores, new City Hall, performing arts center and an academic medical center. The Related Cos. is associated with part-time Vegas resident Reggie Jackson, who is seeking a MLB team for Sin City.\n\nWolff still considering purchase of A’s Posted January 7, 2005Lew Wolff, the Los Angeles developer advising the Oakland A’s on a future ballpark, is still deciding whether to exercise his option to buy the team. We reported on the option a few months ago. There are many issues to tackle: current co-owner Steve Schott wants to remain as a minority owner, and all sides would need to agree to a sales price.\n\nA’s, Giants will be just fine in ’05 Posted January 7, 2005The two MLB teams in the Bay Area — the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants — couldn’t be run any differently. The Giants are a big-buck outfit built around expensive veterans (one expects to see the ghost of the late George Allen showing up in the dugout), while the Oakland A’s are constantly rebuilding around low-priced youth. Still, both teams should be fine in 2005, though the A’s management may have panicked a little in dumping both Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson.\n\nMedia has final say in Angels name game Posted January 7, 2005Will Arte Moreno’s name change to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim actually pay off with increased revenues? Experts now say the additional revenues will be minimal at best. The team was already sold as a Southern California attraction — remember, the team was known as many years as the California Angels — and the television landscape in Los Angeles probably won’t yield the team a great contract anyway. Meanwhile, the Angels are fighting back as the city of Anaheim pursues a lawsuit over the name change, saying the city is trying to rewrite the lease in court.\n\nWindy City ThunderBolts trim owners to three Posted January 7, 2005The ownership group of the Windy City ThunderBolts (independent; Frontier League) was trimmed from six to three as Mike Stranczek, son of Crestwood Mayor Chester Stranczek, and Daniel Brennan, who owns Joe Daniels pub in Palos Heights, bought out three other original investors: former state Sen. Patrick O’Malley, Rich Mundo and Robert Stump, O’Malley’s father-in-law. John Kelly Jr. remains in the ownership group.\n\nMientkiewicz has tight grip on Series victory ball, but BoSox want it Posted January 7, 2005You know, when Doug Mientkiewicz was with the Twins, I defended him even though he could be a real jerk at times. Apparently I was wrong. Mientkiewicz, now a part-timer whose contribution to the Boston Red Sox was marginal, still has the ball he caught to end the 2004 World Series, breaking the Curse of the Bambino. The Red Sox want the ball so they can place it on display; Mientkiewicz says the ball is his retirement fund. What a jerk. The ball belongs in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\n\nLabor group eyes cut of RFK Posted January 6, 2005When there’s a large pot of money in D.C., there’s usually a group of \"community leaders\" looking to get a piece of it. That’s the current case in Washington, where some are questioning why Turner Construction — one of the largest and experienced ballpark-construction firms in the country — was awarded the contract to renovate RFK Stadium for the Washington Nationals. Given Turner’s experience, those questioning the firm’s qualifications are laughable, but they do raise one good point: they wonder if Turner will spend enough with minority subcontractors. Turner says it will; local officials say the District is on target to meet and actually exceed its goal of having 35 percent of the renovation contract go to local, small and disadvantaged businesses.\n\nCounty takes over Scranton sports authority Posted January 6, 2005Lackawanna County officially took over management of the Lackawanna County Stadium into county government. Officials say the ballpark and its main tenant, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (Class AAA; International League), will be run as a real business; the ballpark has lost $7 million since 1996. The team was under heavy surveillance both by the International League and Minor League Baseball at the end of 2004 for its debt management.\n\nSportsplex proposal pitched in Jackson Posted January 6, 2005Jackson (Tn.) city leaders are warming to the idea of funding a youth baseball/softball complex next to Pringles Park, the home of the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx (Class AA; Southern League). The rationale for the $11 million project: local kids can stay home on weekends and participate in baseball and software tournaments. In addition, they see some synergy with the project and Pringles Park, with families playing ball in the day and then taking in a game at night.\n\nGoodman raises hopes for baseball team in Las Vegas Posted January 6, 2005Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman says he’ll announce a ballpark-financing plan in the next month that will please local taxpayers and business groups as well as MLB officials. We’re guessing he’ll pitch a new ballpark near downtown Las Vegas as part of a larger project on city-owned land subsidized by expanded gambling in the area.\n\nMinor-league ball options fade for York’s Small Field Posted January 6, 2005Despite another market-research study to determine the feasibility of baseball in York (Pa.), it looks like one of the prime sites in the city won’t be available for a new ballpark. The York City School District is expected to proceed with plans for $4 million worth of renovations at Small Field, effectively ruling out the site as a possible location for a $24 million ballpark.\n\nPlaying ball in the Dominican Republic Posted January 6, 2005If there’s any question why so many natives of the Dominican Republican play baseball, it’s explained here: baseball is truly a national obsession in the Dominican Republic, where the kids began playing early and the winter leagues draw a huge following.\n\nSteinbrenner aiming for victory or profit? Posted January 6, 2005Normally we don’t cover player signings here, but there’s one situation that reflects on the business of baseball. Many in the baseball world are mystified by the New York Yankees’ seeming disinterest in Carlos Beltran, with the Mets, Cubs and Astros putting up a more spirited pursuit of the enigmatic center fielder. (Which Beltran will show up in 2005: the playoff hero or the disinterested Royal who single-handedly lost a few games against the Twins in previous years because of a lack of defensive focus?) The New York Times’ Richard Sandomir looks at the numbers and concludes the Yankees probably cannot afford Beltran after committing to a multiyear contract extension with Randy Johnson. Yes, there is a limit to how much the Yankees can spend.\n\nSolano T’birds returning for third season Posted January 6, 2005Despite some rumors about the independent Golden Baseball League moving a team into Travis Credit Union Park, the Solano Thunderbirds (college wood-bat; California Collegiate League) will return for the 2004 season. Travis Credit Union Park had previously been home to an independent Western Baseball League team. Team owner Curtis Stocking says the team will focus on building better community relationships in an effort to increase attendance."
