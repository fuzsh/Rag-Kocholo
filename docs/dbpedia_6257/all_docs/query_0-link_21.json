        "text": "April 4, 2008 - Canadian American League (Can-Am)\n\nAmerican Defenders of New Hampshire News Release\n\n(NASHUA, NH, April 4th, 2008) Long time Nashua Pride public address and play-by-play announcer, Ken Cail, has accepted a radio play-by-play announcing position for the Lowell Spinners, class-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nCail, who was hired by the Pride in 1998, became the unmistakable voice of Holman Stadium as the team's public address announcer and also called the play-by-play action during Pride away games on the internet broadcast. He will assume the duties as the Spinners full-time home and away announcer on WCAP radio in Lowell.\n\n\"It was a very tough decision,\" Cail said. \"The Pride have always been a part of me and have treated me in a first-class way....There have been a lot of thrills along the way.\"\n\nCail began his career in sports broadcasting at the age of 18, working as a producer for the Boston Bruins, Celtics, Red Sox, and New England Patriots on WBZ radio. In 1970 he earned his first baseball announcing job with the Manchester (N.H.) Yankees.\n\nThe well-known New England radio personality and once New Hampshire Sportscaster of the Year can be heard co-hosting the popular \"New Hampshire Wake-up Show\" on WTPL radio in Bow. Cail is also recognized as the voice of the Manchester Monarchs (AHL) since their inception in 2001.\n\nWe as an organization and the fans are certainly going to miss Ken on summer nights at Holman,\" said Pride General Manager Chris Hall. \"Not just his for voice but for everything he brought to the team as an upstanding person and friend. We definitely wish Ken the absolute best for his future and career away from the Pride.\"\n\nCail will leave his post behind the Holman Stadium microphone after ten years of service and having seen over 1,000 games. Along with being credited to giving \"World Famous Monkey Boy\" his nickname, Cail is also responsible for dubbing Holman Stadium, \"Historic Holman Stadium\".\n\nThe Nashua Pride Professional Baseball Club, entering its 11th season, provides a fun, affordable, community-based and fan-friendly source of sports entertainment. The 2007 Can-Am League Champions will be participating in its third year of play in the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball.\n\nFor tickets or more information call 603-883-BALL (2255), or visit www.nashuapride.com.\n\nâ€¢ Discuss this story on the Canadian American League message board...\n\nCanadian American League Stories from April 4, 2008\n\nVoice of the Nashua Pride Moves On - American Defenders of New Hampshire\n\nSkyhawks Add Another Major Leaguer - Sussex Skyhawks"
