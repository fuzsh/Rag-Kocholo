        "text": "Do you know what happens inside your chimney? Most people don’t!\n\n​\n\nThe flue liner is the most important component of your chimney, yet often the most neglected. Burning creates byproducts, which build up on the walls of the flue. In using fireplaces and wood stoves, the formation of creosote – a natural byproduct of burning wood – is unavoidable. With regular chimney cleanings and inspections, you will better understand what is going on in there.\n\nBurning wood causes the combustion of the oils in the wood, which are off-gassed as volatiles in the smoke. As the smoke rises through the chimney it cools, causing water, carbon, and volatiles to condense on the interior surfaces of the chimney flue. The black oily residue that builds up is referred to as creosote. Throughout a season, creosote deposits can become several inches thick. Chimney inspections are the only to determine the extent of the damage that the creosote has created.\n\nCreosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air to burn at high temperatures. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control is left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire.\n\nNFPA Code 211 states that, at a minimum, chimneys, fireplaces, and wood stoves should be inspected annually, so that we may be able to monitor any changes in the chimney, such as creosote buildup, structural integrity of the chimney itself. We would then recommend a cleaning schedule tailored for you based on your burning habits.\n\n​\n\nWe will tell you the level of inspection that we believe will be most appropriate for your chimney and venting system. Each level of inspection covers specific items depending on the individual appliance and venting system.\n\nOil furnaces leave a soot buildup on the walls of the chimney. Old or new, this is unavoidable. Also unavoidable is moisture in your chimney – a bi-product of burning. When soot mixes with moisture, it forms sulfuric acid, which will deteriorate the clay lining system.\n\n​\n\nNewer high efficiency furnaces create more condensation than older models. When these are installed into existing flues, the additional moisture combines with the leftover residue, unfortunately hastening the deterioration of your chimney liner.\n\n​\n\nIt is only a matter of time before this deterioration allows poisonous gasses to seep into your home. Each year thousands of people become ill and hundreds die from chimney failure of one type or another. Prolonged carbon monoxide poisoning can be fatal. A proper chimney inspection will answer any questions regarding these issues.\n\nChimneys should be cleaned every one to two years; more often if you use your fireplace, wood stove or pellet stove more frequently. We leave it up to our client’s discretion but, keep in mind the longer you wait, the harder it is to clean it and the cost can be more considerable than if you have it done regularly.\n\nIs your family getting sick frequently with no apparent reasons why?\n\nAre there dark stains on your walls?\n\nIs the outside of your fireplace black?\n\nAre you having draft issues?\n\n​\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions it may be time for a professional chimney cleaning.\n\n​\n\nAll of our chimney cleaning appointments start off as a comprehensive inspection of all of the systems present in your home. The cost of the inspection is included in all cleaning prices.\n\n​\n\nThe scope of work performed in the inspection or evaluation of a fireplace, wood stove, pellet stove or heating system had previously been left to the discretion of the chimney service technician."
