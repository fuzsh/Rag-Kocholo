        "text": "The New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox recently played a regular-season game on an adjacent ballpark in the cornfields of Dyersville, Iowa, next to the iconic field featured in the 1989 Academy Award-nominated film “Field of Dreams” starring Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones.\n\nAnd fans overwhelmingly approved, making the Fox Sports’ Field of Dreams broadcast the most-watched regular-season MLB game in 16 years, with nearly 6 million tuning in.\n\nCloser to home and long ago, the city of Nashua took pride in its own “Field of Dreams,” but instead of building a baseball diamond deep in the Iowa cornfields, Nashua built one in the middle of the woods.\n\nNot many people are aware of former Textile Field, but the ballpark really existed, and as the wonderful line in the Field of Dreams movie said, “If you build it, he will come,” and many others did.\n\nTo visualize any of this, we must step back in time.\n\nIt all began in 1823 with the establishment of Nashua Manufacturing Co.’s cotton textile business. By 1836, the company had constructed three cotton mills that produced 9.3 million yards of cloth yearly on 710 looms and an abundance of jobs that helped define the Gate City and its economic landscape.\n\nWhen the Depression hit, textile mills around New England suffered, and Nashua Manufacturing Co. was no exception.\n\nBut the water-powered mill also owned a major portion of the land located along the Nashua River. And that was not all.\n\nIn an old column my late newspaper editor father John wrote for the Nashua Telegraph, I found interesting information about our city’s former recreational spot.\n\n“At one time, it (Textile Field) had a regulation diamond, and on Sunday afternoons and also evenings, drew large throngs at baseball games involving industrial teams. And there were some good ones.\n\n“This was an era before Holman Stadium (1937), and the major diamonds included North Common, South Common and Textile Field,” my dad wrote. “Baseball prospered those days but not at today’s heights with so many leagues involving youth. But a high brand of semi-professional baseball was offered, not to mention the old New England pro league and the later Class B baseball presented by the Nashua Dodgers, 1946-1949.”\n\nMy dad’s newspaper column went on to say that Textile Field was later narrowed through the construction of Ledge Street Elementary School (1956). In the area, a Little League baseball park and a supervised playground were also built.\n\nSadly, Textile Field is no longer, and some Nashuans disagree about the former field’s exact location, but according to the sports expert I once asked, the elementary school holds the secret.\n\nEddie Lecius, former WSMN radio news and sports broadcaster, spoke with two other well-known Nashuans, Al Savage (age 92) and Greg Andruskevich (former New Hampshire sports writer/editor) about old Textile Field.\n\nAll three believe that a portion of Textile Field is now home to Ledge Street Elementary, and if you walked halfway into the school, you would possibly be standing where home plate was.\n\nNot so fast, says former Nashua resident, Larry Desrosiers. He told me that he grew up near the field on Fifth Street. Now in his late 70s, Larry would argue that, “Home plate on the original field was approximately where the basketball courts (at the school) are today. Later, a second and larger field was built west of the old field. Home plate was about where the right field foul pole is on the present field. I spent hundreds of hours on those fields and remember them quite clearly.”\n\nIt doesn’t matter exactly where home plate lay but that this amazing Field of Dreams existed, especially during times when folks didn’t have much money or the advantages we have today with digital technology and such.\n\nThe city of Nashua, like most communities, has gone through fascinating transformations over the decades and will continue to do so.\n\nI have a favorite quote by philosopher Henry David Thoreau: “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”"
