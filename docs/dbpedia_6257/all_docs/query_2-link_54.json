        "text": "If Chris Hall does his job well, baseball will be saved in Nashua, N.H.\n\nAn overstatement? Perhaps, but that's the daunting task facing the Brockton native as he takes over as general manager of the Nashua Pride of the Can-Am League.\n\n“This is a good opportunity for me to take us to the next level,” said Hall. “We want to keep baseball here in Nashua for a long time.”\n\nBaseball is in trouble in Nashua, but that's no secret to Hall. The 2007 Can-Am League champs struggled at the gate last season, longed for corporate sponsorships, yearned for outings from businesses and almost folded when the season ended.\n\nHall knows this well. He joined the team as vice president of baseball operations in 2006 and immediately reached out to the community for support. Among his duties were conducting corporate sales and spearheading community relations.\n\nNow, he's added the responsibility to building the team as well, but that won't mean anything if there's no franchise to build.\n\nHe knows it will be a struggle, but there are signs of life. The team started a big season-ticket push that increased the number sold from 260 last year to more than 500 for the upcoming season.\n\nAn advisory board consisting of current and former politicians and business leaders in Nashua has been established to reach out for community support. And sponsorship dollars are the highest they've been in the last several years.\n\nHall has helped with all this, of course. Ownership, obviously, is backing him and the entire front office is working hard to keep the franchise alive.\n\nBut Hall is the point man.\n\n“I can't do it alone, it's a complete team effort,” he said. “Hopefully, I'll be a piece of the puzzle and help build the pieces around the team.\n\n“We're on our way. The last two years, I've learned a lot. We've built a championship team and we'll be competitive this year.\n\n“The sponsorship dollars were the highest we've had in the last five, six, seven years; now it's our job to get people in the seats. We can do that; we're close.”\n\nHall looks to his hometown team for inspiration and guidance to get it done. Where the Rox average 3,500 to 4,000 fans for a game, the Pride hopes to average 1,500 to 1,700.\n\n“I'm proud being from the city of Brockton and having a successful franchise that's as family friendly as they are,” said Hall. “They have something for everybody, from the 2-year-old to the 90-year-old grandfather. They've done a tremendous job in this league. They're like the Red Sox; they do everything right. Everybody envies them.”\n\nHall, 35, was born and raised in Brockton and had visions of playing for the Red Sox one day.\n\nA catcher by trade, he played his ball at Thayer Academy and later at Brandeis University. He also caught for Brockton's Post 35 American league team and had a three-week stint with Falmouth of the Cape Cod League.\n\nThe dream of playing pro ball ended, however, after four surgeries, two to his right shoulder and two to his left knee.\n\nHe lives in Chelmsford now with his wife, Marianne, and two children, Olivia, 3, and Matthew, 1. It's a life he enjoys — baseball during the day and his family at night.\n\n“For me, as a father and husband, this works for me,” he said. “If I can make Nashua work, in 10 years I'd still love to be here. The kids can come to the game and I don't have to travel.\n\n“Theo (Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein) and those guys work 20 hours every day. I have some long days, but at league I can go home and have dinner with the kids, put them to bed at night and get back on the computer at work at night.\n\n“I enjoy the fact that I can keep in touch with the business community and take part in community relations and handle players. It's a good thing to be able to judge talent and make trades and try to build a championship team. Affiliate ball doesn't give you that option.”\n\nBut for now, Hall would be content to get the Pride on sound footing — maybe not as profitable as the Rox, but certainly as viable to Nashua as the Rox are to Brockton.\n\nIt's a challenge, perhaps an insurmountable one, but it's one Hall is ready to undertake.\n\n“Ten years from now, I hope to stay in baseball,” he said. “I took a chance to come into the professional baseball world. I love the game of baseball and the passion has never gone away.\n\n“I want to take the Pride to the next level, and if we do that the Pride will be here for another 10 years.”"
