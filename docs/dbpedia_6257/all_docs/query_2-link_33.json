        "text": "It only took a week, but I finally managed to get some pictures from last week’s Nashua Pride games that my wife and I attended. Big props to Mrs. OMDQ, who downloads these from the camera because I’m too technologically illiterate to do it myself.\n\nLooking at the field for the first time, Joey appeared a little unsure of what he was actually seeing. One of my favorite parts of being a dad is watching him look at things for the first time and trying to imagine what is going on inside that little brain.\n\nThe first game we went to, Opening Night, featured a pregame ceremony in which members of the Pride team and staff received 2007 Can-Am League championship rings. The first person introduced was former PA announcer Ken Cail, who served in that capacity for the team’s first ten seasons before moving down the highway to do radio broadcasts for the Lowell Spinners (A-Red Sox).\n\nOn hand to receive his ring was Olmo Rosario, the 2007 Can-Am League’s Most Valuable Player. While he was standing in line, a fan in the next section raced around trying to set up an “Ol-mo” chant that seemed like it was left over from last season. Didn’t really work out well. Olmo is currently playing for the Connecticut Defenders in the Eastern League, hitting .319 with three homeruns, 17 RBI and 10 steals.\n\nAfter the ring ceremony was complete, they raised the championship banner on the flagpole in right field. My wife managed to snap a picture just as the wind kicked up and made the banner wave, just like banners are supposed to do.\n\nGame 2 of the season. Joey hadn’t quite recovered from Opening Night.\n\nPrior to the game, longtime manager had his number 17 retired by the team. He was given a framed jersey and his number was hung on the wall below the press box. As you can see, I got a picture of one of those things.\n\nProblem was, I meant to get a picture on Opening Night and never did, so these were taken pregame, before Butch’s number was added. Next time I go, I’ll get a shot of his number, which actually hangs directly over one of the tunnels. The numbers on this side, on the left of the press box if you’re standing with your back to home plate, belong to Joe Grahe, Milt Cuyler, Felix Jose, and Glenn Murray. The first three used Nashua as a springboard back to the major leagues. Murray was a longtime fan favorite who broke the Atlantic League record for homeruns with the Pride.\n\nOn this side: Mike Easler, the first manager in 1998; Curtis Pride, who used to spend about a month with the team every spring before some team realized they should have signed him already; and some guy named D’Avilia. I wanna say his first name is Vic, but I’m not entirely sure, or why he’s up there.\n\nAnd finally, we need to include a photo of the Pride mascot, Stitches…or, as I like to call him, Mr. Met North."
