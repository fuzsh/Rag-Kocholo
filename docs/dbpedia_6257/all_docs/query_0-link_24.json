        "text": "A year ago the Worcester Tornadoes were a team pretty much in name only. The franchise had only a few players, and the process of transforming Holy Cross' Fitton Field from a college facility into a modern minor league ballpark hadn't commenced.\n\nToday, though, the Tornadoes are the defending Can-Am League champions. In addition to being a success on the field, Worcester's first professional baseball team since 1934 became a viable part of the community. The Tornadoes had the third-highest attendance (125,745) in the eight-team Can-Am League.\n\n\"Things are a little saner this year, but we are still very busy,\" said Tornadoes owner and CEO Alan Stone. \"We are in the process of getting things ready for the upcoming season. We are very pleased with the way ticket sales have gone. We've introduced a mini-season ticket plan (5 games) which have proven to be very popular.\"\n\nStone, who resides in Weston, said Fitton Field, which was renamed Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field last year, will have a new scoreboard.\n\n\"Last year, we were literally putting down the warning track just a few hours before the first game,\" said Stone with a chuckle. \"This year, the other changes will be more subtle. We want to be as fan-friendly as possible. We've kept our prices low. I think we have a product which is geared toward the fans.\"\n\nTornadoes ticket prices range between $5 and $18. Fitton Field was always a good college baseball facility by New England standards, but it's become an outstanding professional ballpark.\n\nRich Gedman will return as Worcester's manager. The former Red Sox catcher and Framingham resident served as a coach for the Can-Am League's North Shore Spirit before earning Manager of the Year honors last year in his first season as a skipper.\n\nStone is hopeful the remainder of the coaching staff also will be back. Ex-Red Sox hurler Bob Ojeda served as Worcester's pitching coach last year.\n\nWhat will be different is the composition of the team's roster. Four of Worcester's players have been signed by major league teams during the offseason. Teams in the Can-Am League aren't affiliated with major league organizations. Pitchers Eddie Pena (San Diego Padres) and Steve Palazzolo (Milwaukee Brewers), and infielders Alex Nunez (Washington Nationals) and Omar Pena (Kansas City Royals) will be reporting to spring training camps this month.\n\n\"We would like to keep the team intact as much as possible, but there are always going to be changes from year to year,\" said Stone. \"We are happy these players will get an opportunity with a major league team.\"\n\nTwo players from MetroWest joined Worcester during last season. First baseman Chris Colabello of Milford and pitcher Greg Montalbano of Westborough became key performers for the Tornadoes.\n\nColabello, who recently traveled to Arizona to attend a Brewers tryout camp, intends to return to the Tornadoes if he's not signed by a major league club. Colabello attended a Red Sox tryout last year and was told that be might be invited to work out for club officials again this year.\n\n\"I'd be very happy to return to the Tornadoes,\" said Colabello. \"It's a first-class organization. They guys on the team last year were great. I'm still only 22. I think it would help my career to play an entire season for the Tornadoes.\"\n\nMontalbano, who is currently working out in Florida, hopes to play for Italy in the upcoming World Baseball Classic. His plans for the 2006 season haven't been finalized.\n\nThe Can-Am League has undergone some changes during the winter. Nashua moved from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am League. The Pride, who are managed by former Red Sox infielder and manager Butch Hobson, replace the nomadic Grays, who played all of their games on the road last year. The Elmira franchise has moved to Augusta, N.J., and has been renamed the Sussex (County) Skyhawks.\n\n\"The addition of Nashua is going to be really good for the league and the Sussex team is in a strong market,\" said Stone. \"We now have in the league five teams in New England, two in New Jersey and a team in Quebec.\"\n\nThe Tornadoes will begin defense of their championship on May 23, when they open the season at home against the New Jersey Jackals."
