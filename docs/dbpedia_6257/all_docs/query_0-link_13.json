        "text": "Dennis Abreu quickly made his presence felt for the Brockton Rox Friday night.\n\nAbreu, acquired in a trade earlier Friday, delivered a game-winning RBI single in the bottom of the sixth inning that scored Lee Rubin to lead the Rox to a 2-1 come-from-behind Can-Am League win over the Sussex Skyhawks at Campanelli Stadium.\n\nAfter Sussex got a solo home run from Jorge Moreno in the top of the first inning, Brockton tied the game in the bottom of the third inning on a RBI groundout from Melvin Falu, which also had his 14-game hitting streak come to a end.\n\nJohn Kelly improved to 4-4 for the Rox after working six innings, giving up one run, walked four, struck out three and scattering six hits.\n\nBrockton, which improved to 2-3 in the second half and 24-28 overall, got two scoreless inning from closer Jerry Dunn for his 12 save of the season, who came in after a 55 minute rain delay. Matt Zachary worked a scoreless seventh for the Rox.\n\nGame three of the four game series will be played tonight at 6:05 and the final game will be played at 5:05 Sunday.\n\nRox add Abreu:\n\nThe Rox’s roster shuffles over the last two days ended with a blockbuster deal that brought Abreu, younger brother of New York Yankees outfielder Bobby Abreu, on Friday from the Nashua Pride in exchange for outfielder Ervin Alcantara.\n\nAbreu entered Friday night’s game with Sussex for Brockton riding an 18-game hitting streak and extended it to 19 with a RBI single in the fifth inning. Abreu left the Pride leading the team in hitting (.335) and stolen bases (12). Abreu had seven home runs and 26 RBI in 50 games for the Pride.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Rox released left-handed pitcher Chris McDonough and on Thursday, they released outfielder Vic Davilla, who they claimed off waivers earlier in the week."
