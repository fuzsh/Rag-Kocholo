Santoro finished the season a team-best .371 batting average with 29 RBI, 18 runs scored, 13 doubles, one triple, and one homer. He had a .459 on-base percentage while his slugging percentage was .516.\n\nSantoro recorded a team-high 16 walks for the year. In his two years in the green and white, Santoro was a .343 hitter with 60 RBI, 53 runs scored, 24 doubles, one triple, and five home runs in 84 games played. Santoro finished with 96 career hits in 280 at-bats for York.\n\nThe Can-Am league is comprised of eight teams as the Brockton Rox, the Nashua Pride, the New Jersey Jackals, the Ottawa Rapidz, Les Capitales de Quebec, the Sussex Skyhawks, and the Worcester Tornadoes join the Surf in the composition of the league."
