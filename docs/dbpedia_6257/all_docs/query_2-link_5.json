        "text": "NASHUA – The grand ol’ ballpark is turning 80, but she really only looks half her age.\n\nThis spring and summer, the city will be celebrating the 80th birthday of Holman Stadium, home to several youth and high school baseball teams, and from June to August, the Nashua Silver Knights of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League.\n\nAnd the Silver Knights are set to lead the celebration.\n\n“I’m looking into names who have played here, and putting together a list of targets to go after,” Silver Knights general manager Rick Muntean said. “Which is football, concerts, and baseball. What am I forgetting?”\n\nThe city will be forming a committee, slated to meet for the first time within the next week or two, to formulate a celebration plan.\n\n“There’s a committee and I’ll see what the committee wants to do,” Muntean said. “But let’s get some people here. I’d like for everybody in town to be talking about it. …I want to do something really special for it.”\n\nWhen Holman turned 75 five years ago, the Knights honored past professional teams that had played there, beginning with the Nashua Dodgers all the way to the Nashua Pride.\n\nMuntean would like to tie in the 80th anniversary of the stadium with the 2018 Futures League All-Star Game, which Nashua/Holman will host for the second time this summer.\n\nXXXXXX\n\nIt all began for Holman Stadium in 1937 where, fittingly enough, a man named Charles Frank Holman contributed $55,000 to its construction, which he said was a tribute to his parents. Holman’s father, Charles, was voted as Nashua’s mayor in 1879 had a successful confectioners business on Eldridge Street after beginning his time in town as a salesman who wasn’t exactly flush with money.\n\nBesides Charles Holman’s son’s contribution, the city also was able to secure federal money, thanks to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s recovery plan for the Great Depression.\n\nOf course, Holman’s place in history is greatly secured by the fact it was home to the first integrated minor league baseball team in the United States in the 20th century, the Dodgers.\n\nMurals which were dedicated to the Stadium in July of 2017 – the organizational work of former Silver Knights assistant general manager Cheryl Lindner – pay tribute to this fact, with Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella and future Cy Young award winner Don Newcombe as the principals. In fact, when Dodgers manager Walter Alston was ejected from a game during the 1946 season, Campanella took over as manager and that is said to be the first time in U.S. history that an African-American managed a team with caucasian athletes.\n\nThe Dodgers came to Nashua as Dodgers official Buzzie Bavasi, asked by Dodger president Branch Rickey to find a spot for a team in the newly re-formed New England League, was seeking a city with a population that had French Canadian ties. The Dodgers folded along with the New England League in1949.\n\nOf course, high school football had been a staple at Holman, with perhaps the most recognizable name being former Detroit Lions quarterback Greg Landry.\n\nThe Dodgers’ departure marked the end of professional baseball until the arrival of the Nashua Angels, an Eastern League Double A affiliate of the California Angels, in 1983. The franchise switched affiliations to the Nashua Pirates until it left due to poor attendance in December of 1986 for Harrisburg, Pa.\n\nHolman was the home to various concerts – top acts such as Tina Turner and Whitney Houston – in the early 1990s until independent professional baseball came of age and the Nashua Hawks arrived in 1995, but were locked out midway through 1996.\n\nBut then Nashua Mayor Don Davidson wanted a primary professional team tenant for the stadium, and that evolved into the Nashua Pride – the longest tenured pro baseball team that called Holman home (1998-2008). The Pride was responsible for two Holman renovations, the second one a multi-million dollar job in 2001 that gives us the Holman you see today with luxury suites, etc.\n\nThe Pride franchise was sold by then local owner John Stabile to a group that wanted to tie the baseball team in with the United States Military, known as the American Defenders of New Hampshire. It didn’t make it half a season, also locked out for lease violations. Holman went without professional ball again in 2010.\n\nEnter the Silver Knights in 2011, who are owned by New York-based businessman Drew Weber, who also at the time owned the Red Sox short season Single A affiliate, the nearby Lowell (Mass.) Spinners. Weber had an autograph event during June of 2010, the other year Holman lacked a major tenant, and said then, “There will be a team in Holman Stadium next year.”\n\nHis two major front office staffers, team president Tim Bawmann and VP Jon Goode, urged Weber to get involved on the ground floor of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League and get a franchise into Holman (Bawmann at the time lived in Nashua, just two miles or so from Holman).\n\nWhen the Knights won the second of their four FCBL titles in 2012, it marked the first time a primary summer tenant won a championship on Holman’s hallowed ground since the Nashua Dodgers did it in winning three Governor’s Cups. The last local football title won at Holman came in 1997,when Nashua topped Londonderry, 15-0. In 1999, in what proved to be the last football championship game played at Holman, Manchester Central blanked Nashua, 18-0.\n\nHolman has also been a neutral site for state baseball tournaments, high school and American Legion. Nashua High School South captured the Class L title at Holman in 2005, beating Salem 6-1.\n\nIn any event, any team’s success is always centered around Holman.\n\nThere was one positive from the Defenders brief time as they established a tradition of honoring past athletes, etc. who had their greatest days at Holman, the Holman Wall of Fame. Inductees are honored annually before the July 4 Fireworks show.\n\nLast summer, a crowd of well over 2,000 saw the U.S. National Baseball team beat Team Japan in the final game of a five-game series, the event held in conjunction with the Futures League and the Silver Knights.\n\nHolman remains the jewel in the eyes of those who come to attend its events.\n\n“It’s as picturesque as it gets,” Muntean said, “Because of the operators you’ve had here and Holman Stadium, it’s a recipe for success.”\n\nNewsletter"
