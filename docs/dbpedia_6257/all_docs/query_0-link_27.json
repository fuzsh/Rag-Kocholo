David Carcieri, Executive Director of the Sussex County YMCA, said, \"This ceremony is but a small token of our appreciation to the Capital Campaign Donors who helped build this YMCA into the success that it is today. Without their generosity, the Sussex County YMCA would not have had the opportunity to expand to meet the needs of the community and make a positive impact on the lives of thousands of Sussex County residents.\" What people know today as the Sussex County YMCA is actually a far cry from where they began in 1976, as a community outreach program from their sister branch at the Fairview Lake YMCA.

Then in 1995 a feasibility study concluded that a full service YMCA was not only possible, but was actually in very high demand, and so began the YMCA's planning and fundraising efforts. Thanks to a successful Capital Campaign, the YMCA was able to raise the necessary money and move forward with their plans to serve the fitness needs of Sussex County residents.
