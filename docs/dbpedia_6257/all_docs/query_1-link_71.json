Originally we asked you for the code for level 9999, and to answer three ques- tions. Alas, the code has now been published, so we feel that it’s unfair on people who’ve struggled to the top level to compete with others who don’t even have the game! So forget the code. What we want now is for you to produce a screen shot of a meanie on the Sentinel's tower. And we still want the answers to those three simple questions. Sidekick for BBC Maze Technology’s new SideKick - type pop-up program for the BBC is called Sideset. It allows you to freeze whatever program you are currently run- ning, and then use any of the other functions of the machine before resuming. The program could be useful as a de-bugging tool, as well as allowing the functions to be used at any time. For example you can use Basic commands from View, or suspend a spreadsheet to play a quick game of Repton 3! A number of utilities are supplied on disc to use with Sideset , including a calculator, diary, address book and notepad. The package, for the BBC B and Master series, comes on a ROM and DFS/ ADFS compatible disc and costs £39.95 plus VAT. RISC micro details revealed By Steve Mansfield It’s now thought the entry- level RISC-based machine will be under £1000. This micro will have 512k RAM, with a 1Mb version available. However, the system is capable of supporting 4Mb of memory - this is the amount of RAM on the RISC second pro- cessor development system - so a version with this amount of memory is possible. The development micro shown on BBC’s Micro Live programme ran the PCW Basic benchmarks 10 times faster than the BBC B. However, speed increases could be as much as 30-fold with machine code programs. Acorn has provided extensive add-on facilities on the micros. Master 128 owners still grap- pling with the machine’s con- figuration might benefit from Advanced Computer Products’ latest release. Co-incidentally bearing the same initials as the company, the Advanced Control Panel is based on the program supplied on the Master’s Welcome disc. But John Huddlestone told us: ‘We took the idea then threw away that program’. ACP’s chip-based program acts as a ‘front-end’ to the mic- ro. Pull-down windows enable you to load and save ROM images, switch ROMs on and off, go into another language : i v The new RISC chip The curiously-named ‘podulcs’ can be used for second processors, music inter- faces and other intelligent peripherals. Acorn has developed soft- ware to emulate the BBC mic- ro’s 6502 processor. Called 65cmu , this should run legal BBC software, but the emph- asis is heavily on languages, and unfortunately most games are still unlikely to work. Programs written properly in and set the machine configura- tion. Screen colours, disc drive options, serial port configura- tion and so on can be set from menus, and these set-ups can be saved and re-loaded, so you can use different configurations for different applications. The software also provides an on-screen calculator, which works in decimal, hex and bin- ary. And there is an alarm function which can either make a sound at the required time or issue a star command, such as :: 'EXEC. ACP is written as a language, so programmers can create their own control panels. ACP costs £34.50. Basic should run on the new machine’s standard language. Many software houses are working on programs for the machines including desktop publishing, databases, games and graphics (see page 17). ■ In a possibly unconnected move, Advanced Memory Sys- tems is changing the colour of its AMX mouse to pale grey with red buttons. Baker pushes new IT drive Education Secretary Kenneth Baker has unveiled a £19 mil- lion pre-election plan for mak- ing better use of information technology (IT) in schools, in- volving a new elite corps of classroom computer advisers. Raker: New hi-tech advisers The five-year package should improve the micro-pupil ratio, and attach more peripherals to school equipment. Most important was the deci- sion to set up a 750-strong team of advisers to train teachers in the effective use of their equipment.

It's now available in French and German versions, both giving you the option of editing characters and key assignments for special symbols. And a separate Euro- pean Language Development Pack provides facilities for creating complete alphabets, like Greek or Russian. As well as its language skills, Folio also provides access to a wide variety of printer fonts. Prices for these versions have yet to be finalised, but licence deals will be available. News in brief ■ A local viewdata system for networked BBC micros has been launched by Odyssey Software. TeleFax works across Amcom’s E-Net system and allows a database of teletext to be called up with a single com- mand. It comes with full screen editor for creating the pages and a program which can be used to display pages automati- cally. The price is £30 from Odyssey Software. ■ Rice Computer Electronics has updated the software for its drum synthesiser. The new software allows drum patterns to be saved under user-defined filenames, and there is greater control over timing. Other im- provements include echo effects and better graphics. The Rice Drums cost £45 with cassette- based software and £47.50 on disc. Existing owners can get the upgrade for the cost of postage and packing. ■ Terrell Electronics has a pro- duct which allows up to four micros to share one printer. Two versions are available to take three or four BBC micros. The system is very simple using taxdware switches. The prices are £59.50 and £69.50 for the three and four micro versions. Cables for the Compact are available at £2 extra each. An award scheme for products which help cerebral palsy chil- dren is generating a good re- sponse, including two devices designed specifically for the BBC micro. Datasolve launched the scheme on February 9, and some of the best entries were shown to companies at the Computer Industry Charity Ball in June. The award schemes open to small com- panies and individuals making micro-technology products, and has so far attracted 20 en- tries. Among them are the Photonic Wand from the com- pany of the same name, and a games joystick available from Interface Designs. The Photonic Wand is like a long-distance light pen. It’s used to point at the screen, but works up to two metres away. At this distance, very small movements are needed. The wand can also be used close to the screen, where larger movc- Tough joystick lets kids play games ments are required, which is useful if a child is prone to severe involuntary motion. The £100 Photonic Wand in- cludes keyboard emulation Wand helps movement problems software which allows it to be used with a wide range of prog- rams. It’s already being used with music, painting and even wordprocessing packages. The joystick is mainly in- tended for games. It features a rugged construction and large stick movement, which is essential for children with res- tricted limb movement or res- tricted control. There is a fire button set into the top of the stick but for children who can’t manage that, there is also an automatic fire option. The joystick uses digital switching, rather than full ana- logue control, as this helps make the product more robust, and fine control is rarely needed with cerebral palsy chil- dren. Only a few games, like Aviator , need analogue control, so the stick is compatible with the vast majority of BBC micro software titles. The price of the joystick is £60.40. Extra memory Morley Electronics has brought out two new products for the Master 128. The Master Board AA is an internal ROM board which takes up to eight 16k chips, or four 32k chips. It does this without occupying any of the slots used by the sideways RAM or the cartridge sockets. The Master Board comes with supporting software on a chip which provides file trans- fer routines and an ADFS disc formatter as well. The other product is a 256k memory cartridge which can be used with the standard disc fil- ing system (DFS). It obeys all the normal DFS commands, and allows files to be saved and loaded very fast. The prices are yet to be announced, but should be around the £40 mark. Wordwiser still Wordwise has been improved again. With the full backing of Computer Concepts, the mak- ers of the original Wordwise , Interface Electronics (IFEL) has produced Wordwise 4- II. With the new version, vir- tually every key has a special function when used with the Control key. For example, pressing CTRL-X allows search and replace operations while still in edit mode and CTRL-E allows you to choose printer codes from a drop- down menu. Over a dozen of these func- tions have been added. IFEL has included the programming language extensions from its previous product, Wordwise 4*. The new ROM is accompa- nied by a disc with utilities which include mail merging and label printing. The price is £53.95, but ex- isting Wordwise owners can get a discount of about £22. a The Word-Ex ROM from Norwich Computer Services adds to Wordwise 4-, rather than replacing it. The chip gives you facilities such as menu-driven loading and saving of files, function key editing, high speed sorting of paragraphs, automatic case changing and an on-screen help menu. The cost of the chip is £30, available from Norwich Computer Services, a The Wordpro disc-based package from Softec, which also adds extra features to Wordwise 4-, has been dropped in price from £23 to £15.95. ACORN USRR JULY 1987 9 Using second-rate components can make your hardware bite back. Over the past three years we at Mitsubishi have sold over a million disk drives; a record that makes us very much number one in the market. But we don’t impress just on quantity. There's quality too. Both our 3V2\" and SVe,\" floppy drives perform with the proven reliability that’s made us one of the world’s largest manufacturing companies. Within the units you’ll find high compliant heads that ensure less wear on the diskette. If the power is switched off or interrupted, our circuitry prevents data from being corrupted. The units themselves are tough and durable, so they’ll stand up to a lot of rough treatment and last longer. And because of their remarkably high precision, they enable far safer data interchange, even if the diskettes are worn or there’s interference from nearby monitors. So it’s hardly surprising that the list of companies using our disk drives reads like a who’s who of personal computer manufacturers. So don't get a mega-bite, ask for Mitsubishi by name.

It’s not uncommon to find many Pre- stel and bulletin board users on-line for hours. For them Mercury Com- munications has introduced the Mercury 2200 service. For an initial charge of around £50, which includes a smart push- button telephone, Mercury will connect you to its network. Its charges are 15-25 per cent cheaper than BT’s, and mini- mum charges for calls are less as the costs are based on a shorter time unit. Unfortunately, Mercury only works on trunk calls, so it doesn’t save on the local call to Prestel or your neighbour’s bulletin board. The system is digital, so the quality of the lines is dramati- cally improved - and you can connect to it using your ex- isting line and socket. Mercury deals with the billing, which is itemised call by call. It is probably not of much use to anyone whose quarterly bill is less than £80, but when long distance calls are a regular occurrence, Mercury could help keep down the bills. Con- tact Mercury on a free number, 0800 424 194. ■ Dataphone has launched a comprehensive comms package for just £6.50, offering call tim- ing and a 300-number store. It is compatible with Demon and Magic Modems. More details on (0733) 230240. ■ The Wizard’s Shop bulletin board has been renamed CLUB 1512 and is now running 24 hours a day, seven days a week on 01-204 8755. It is based on an Amstrad PC, and its memory contains a phenomenal amount of BBC micro software, including some Music 500 files. At present, 300/300 full duplex, and 1200/ 75 speeds are supported. Buzz Prestel turns to Gold Prestel has finally linked up with Telecom Gold in a move that heralds the end of incom- patibility between electronic mail systems. Using a special ‘gateway’, messages can now be sent be- tween the systems. Micronet has been the first to take advan- tage of this with a service called Interlink. This gives Micronet users access to Gold’s facilities. Other Prestel special interest groups are likely to follow suit with their versions of Interlink. Electronic mail companies, like Gold, One-to-One and Easylink, have been talking for a long time about linking their systems. A major problem with email is that the recipient has had to have an account on the same system as the sender. In- terlink is the first real step to overcoming the problem. When Micronet users join Micronet is expanding Interlink they are given a Tele- com Gold mailbox on system 74. This means they can go directly into Gold as well as through the Prestel gateway. The main advantage with In- terlink is for people who need both Prestel and Gold messag- ing facilities. One phone call will now allow you to read and send all your mail and telexes. One possible drawback is that you still have to use Pre- stel’s 40-column viewdata screen. But new software should help alleviate some of the problems, by splitting mes- sages into page-size chunks. There is no subscription charge or joining fee for Inter- link, but it docs incur normal Telecom Gold time charges, as well as the standard file storage costs. Micronet will also be adding a lp per minute charge very soon. However, it’s still cheaper than the Microlink ser- vice which imposes a £3 per month standing charge. Fun science on C4 Channel 4 has decided that education doesn’t have to be boring. A new series has just started, called Abracadabra , which is trying to put the fun back into technology and sci- ence for children. Aimed at the 8-14 year-old age group, the programme uses cartoons, music, visual effects and characters like superhero Captain Cactus, schoolgirl Nora Nucleus, Holly Gram and a greedy puppet, Antrillo- qus, to introduce children to a variety of complex subjects. The series of half-hour prog- rammes is being screened on Mondays at 5.30pm. It’s the result of two years* develop- ment by husband and wife Captain Cactus in action Holly Gram in the new series team Jan and Michelle Silchen- stedt, who worked with teachers, parents and children to produce the final format. Abracadabra aims to cover subjects like lasers, genetics, robotics, space travel and geol- ogy in its 13 programmes. Each subject is given a broad intro- duction followed by the history and mythology and explanation of how it works, what’s going on now, and how things might develop in the future. News in brief ■ Improvements have been made to the Beeb-Planner program, which uses critical path techniques to plan pro- jects. The extra facilities include using sideways RAM, if pre- sent, printer formatting, re- analysis after every change and cost scheduling. The software is available on disc for £39.95 from E J Sheffield. ■ A disc drive refurbishment service has been launched by RCS Computer Services in Aldershot. The company aims to help people who need work done on out-of-warranty equipment - something that might well be useful to schools and clubs. The company is par- ticularly strong on BBC micros as it’s an Acorn repair agency. RCA is on (0252) 333575. ■ Logo Software is replacing its Lego Lines software with Technical Logo. This is a lan- guage designed for driving Lego Technic models. It comes with programs for a number of models, including the two- motor buggy.

A new Z80-based sys- tem has just been launched by Kref Computer Services in Wales. Task-Master uses the little-known ZCPR3 operating system, which is compatible with CP/M2.2, but which claims to give advanced features normally only found on large, multi-user systems like Unix. These features include full support for BBC micro graphics and star commands, automatic recognition of disc formats, and a directory file structure. Over 70 utility prog- rams are supplied on the sup- port disc. Documentation in- cludes a 350-page manual. The package also includes an assembler, monitor and debug- ging system and a version of Borland's acclaimed Turbo Pas- cal software. Task-Master is aimed principally at people wanting to develop their own programs. However, some commercial CP/M packages have been successfully tested on the system — these include Wordstar 3, Multiplan , Super- Calc 2, dBase II and Aztec C. Task-Master uses the Tube to connect with the BBC mic- ro. It's compatible with the BBC B, B-F and Master 128. The system comes complete with a fast 64k second proces- sor for £374, or as a software pack for Torch Z80 second processors at £150. Logo sprites on a budget A new, low-cost Logo package gives users access to sprites without the expense of a special sprite board. Parasoft Logo and Sprites gives many of the same features as a board, but at a cost of £12. It allows 16 shapes to be pre- sent on the screen at one time, and a set of pre-defined shapes is provided including a car, a plane and a rocket, some ghosts and even Pacman. Special com- mands allow these sprites to be easily edited into new shapes, which can be saved. The program adds 18 new commands to the Logo system. Each sprite can be moved around the screen at a set speed or it can be animated. Sprite colours can be changed and so can the background. Normal turtle graphics or the Stamp command can be used to draw in backgrounds. Complete animated scenes can be created. Children can create games as there are com- mands to detect two sprites touching or colliding. Parasoft Logo and Sprites was written by a 12 year-olc pupil and is available from Marlborough First and Middle School, Marlborough Hill, Harrow, Middlesex HAl 1UJ.

Urgently required games software for Electron and BBC SHOW HEWS Software houses show new RISC packages It looks like it’s going to be an even busier show than we thought! Many companies will be demonstrating software and hardware for the forthcoming Acorn RISC machine. Electro Music Research is working in conjunction with Acorn to develop a complete MIDI software and designing a MIDI interface. EMR has written a wide range of MIDI software, and its products are used in a large number of schools for teaching music at O and A-level. Pro- ducts include performers, se- quencers, samplers and, accord- ing to the company, ‘the most advanced score writing prog- Delta database display designer Minerva Systems will be show- ing the latest utility for the System Delta database package - a programmable graphics manager called System Gamma. This is similar to ViewPlot and InterChart in that it allows you to produce graphics from the figures in your database. Un- like the other packages, howev- er, System Gamma lets you draw the graphs using very simple star commands. Other System Delta products on show will include the new Reporter package. This is used to extract information from your database files using special formats. A wide variety of user-defined formats are possi- ble, and the information can be printed or written to a file. Another package, Inter/View Link is designed to allow ex- isting data from Computer Concepts’ Inter suite of prog- rams and Acornsoft’s View packages to be read into a Sys- tem Delta database. ram for a home micro’. This gives an on-screen display of the music in proper musical notation with all note lengths, chords, time signatures, accidentals and so on. It will also produce a hard copy of your music in either a full orchestral form or just as a piano arrangement. The Performer allows you to ‘record’ in real time or step through your recording and edit it note by note. You can then add up to 63 other instru- ments and play the whole lot back. All of EMR’s RISC MIDI equipment will be sold under the Acornsoft name. EMR will also be developing If all goes according to plan, James Bond should be putting in an appearance at the show. Not James Bond himself, you understand - he’s far too busy fighting international subver- sion and charming beautiful women in far-off places. This particular 007 is the latest computer game spin-off from Domark. Based on the new Bond film, The Living software for the internal sound chip in the RISC machine which is very similar to the Music 500. At the show, EMR will be running a continuous live demo of the latest in elec- tronic music and MIDI - all run from a couple of BBC micros. The company will also be offering a MIDI interface for the BBC for £80 and will throw in The Performer free. Computer Concepts will also be demonstrating some RISC utilities alongside a book on Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) assembly language by Peter Cockerell. And Minerva’s RISC database (announced last month) will be on display. Daylights starring Timothy Dalton, the game promises 10 levels, each showing a different scene from the movie. The locations range as far and wide as Vienna, Tangiers and Rcchen Am See, which apparently is in Italy. The game should be available from normal software retailers. It’s expected that cassette ver- sions will sell for £9.99. Sideset on show Maze Technology hopes to have its Sideset utility (see page seven) at the show. But the software is already undergoing some upgrades - even before it’s launched. As a result of feedback from Maze’s early publicity, the soft- ware is being modified so that it works with even more ap- plications packages. Although Sideset works with all ‘legal’ software, a large proportion of potential customers also want it to work with unconventional packages like InterWord , according to company director Owen Cullum. The company is also looking at making the software work with co-processors. By enabl- ing users to switch between programs running in the main and second processors, it may be possible to achieve a crude kind of multi-tasking. News in brief ■ Final production versions of Genie - the pop-up desktop utilities by Permanent Memory Systems - are now ready, and PMS hopes to have them at the show. The £60 package pro- vides features like a notepad, address book and desk diary in a battery-backed module. The utilities can be called from within any other package, and work even with second proces- sors and other pop-up prog- rams, like Spell Master. ■ Beebug will be concentrat- ing on its Master ROM. The control panel features a Gem- like disc menu, an actual ‘con- trol panel’ for editing the CMOS RAM and a diary/ calendar similar to PMS’s Genie. The company will also be showing its new Command communications program. ■ Twillstar will have on sale the latest Teco printer. Retail- ing at £229, it features full Epson and IBM comparability with a draft speed of 180 cps and NLQ at 39 cps. Bond bytes back Does the cello feature in the computer game?

The Viglen Winchester is ready to plug straight into your BBC Master or if you have a B or B plus you will simply have to fit an ADFS ROM. You can use up to two floppy disk drives in conjunction with the unit and, fitted to the B+ or Master, the floppies can double their capacity by running in double density mode. The 112 MBytes Viglen Winchester System is equivalent in capacity to over 1000 I00K floppies or 250 400K floppy disks. It takes under 2.5 seconds to save 200K bytes, making it at least ten times faster than the equivalent floppy disk options. The system is designed for virtually every application from education or business to home use. WHAT DO I GET FOR MY MONEY /.
