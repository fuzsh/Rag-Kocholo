        "text": "STANDISH, ME - Former Monks shortstop Luke Enman â€˜08 (Milan, NH/Berlin HS) has signed a professional baseball contract with the Nashua Pride of the Can-Am League.\n\nEnman joins the Pride after posting an impressive senior campaign at St. Joe's where he was named the GNAC Player of the Year and also received New England Intercollegiate Baseball Association Second-Team honors. Enman led the Monks in '08 with a .368 (56-142) batting average and a .678 slugging percentage and finished tied for the lead with 56 hits, 7 home runs and 41 RBI's.\n\nIn four years as a starter for SJC Head Baseball Coach Will Sanborn, Enman accumulated 601 at-bats (1st all-time), 159 runs (3rd), 214 hits (tied 2nd), 42 doubles (2nd), 18 triples (1st), 29 home runs (tied 3rd), 162 RBI's (3rd), 90 walks (2nd), 38 stolen bases (tied 5th) and a .356 career batting average (tied 8th). Enman's seven triples hit during the 2008 season stands as the St. Joe's single-season record.\n\nEnman is the second Monks player from the 2005 freshman class to join the professional ranks. Left-handed pitcher Charlie Furbush (South Portland, ME), who transferred to Louisiana State University after his sophomore year, was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round in 2007.\n\nThe Nashua Pride Professional Baseball Club, in its 11th season, provides a fun, affordable, community-based and fan-friendly source of sports entertainment. The 2007 Can-Am League Champions are participating in its third year of play in the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball."
