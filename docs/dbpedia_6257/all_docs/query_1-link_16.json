        "text": "The dates of the Division 2 field hockey quarterfinals were incorrect in yesterday’s Telegram & Gazette. All Division 2 quarterfinal games will be played at 2:30 p.m. on Friday. The winner of the Littleton/Narragansett game will play at Quaboag, the Oakmont/Lunenburg winner will play at Uxbridge, the Bromfield/Grafton winner will play at Hopedale, and Nipmuc will host Blackstone-Millville.\n\nThe Worcester Tornadoes will be one of eight teams in next year’s Can-Am League, the league’s board of directors announced yesterday. The Tornadoes will be joined by the Atlantic City Surf, Brockton Rox, Grays (traveling team), Nashua Pride, New Jersey Jackals, Québec Capitales and Sussex Skyhawks. The North Shore Spirit and New Haven County Cutters will not operate.\n\nFormer Red Sox All-Star Jose Offerman was granted probation and ordered to get anger management treatment for a bat-wielding attack at a minor league game that injured two opposing players. Bridgeport, Conn., Superior Court Judge James Ginocchio also ruled that Offerman, 38, must pay the medical expenses of Bridgeport Bluefish catcher John Nathans and pitcher Matt Beech. Offerman had faced up to 10 years in prison on two felony assault charges. He was granted accelerated rehabilitation, a form of probation that will allow the charges to be dismissed after two years if he abides by the judge’s orders. Offerman, who was trying to return to the majors, was batting for the Long Island Ducks in a game against the Bluefish in Bridgeport on Aug. 14 when Beech hit him with a fastball. Offerman charged the mound with his bat and swung at least twice, striking Beech and Nathans.\n\nBoston Bruins center Patrice Bergeron skipped a fundraising dinner honoring him last night because of a concussion sustained last weekend when he was checked face-first into the boards. There is no timetable for Bergeron to return to the ice, but Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said concussions of this severity usually require at least a month of recovery time. Philadelphia defenseman Randy Jones was suspended by the NHL for two games because of the hit in the Flyers’ 2-1 win in Boston on Saturday.\n\nThe Bruins recalled goalie Jordan Sigalet from Providence of the AHL after Manny Fernandez strained his left knee in practice earlier in the day.\n\nCornerback Darrell Green and receivers Cris Carter and Herman Moore were among 124 modern-era players, coaches, and contributors on the preliminary list of nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2008.\n\nBrazil was chosen host of the 2014 World Cup, returning the showcase event to the soccer-mad country that held the tournament in 1950 and has captured the title a record five times."
