        "text": "He may not have heard the buzz at Yankee Stadium as he trotted to right field to begin yesterday's game or the cheers six innings later when he hit a home run, but the significance of the event could not possibly have escaped Curtis Pride.\n\nNot only was Pride, who is deaf, starting in a vital game between division and historic rivals, but he was also doing it after having been sent to the baseball scrap heap. The result was a thrill-filled afternoon for a 34-year-old journeyman who does not like to give up.\n\n''It was a great feeling, coming out on the field and seeing all those fans,'' he said. ''There were 55,000 people. That's something I never thought I'd see again. I never could have imagined this. It was like a dream. To be in Yankee Stadium in a Yankee uniform, I'm just glad I got the opportunity.''\n\nSince first being signed by the Mets in 1986, Pride has bounced between the minors and the majors. He did not play in the major leagues until 1993, and he has never gained a foothold with a team. He was let go by the Expos in 2001 and landed with the Pirates' Class AAA affiliate in Nashville the next season. Despite hitting .296 for Nashville, he was released and, it seemed, forgotten. With no offers from a major league team, he signed with Nashua (N.H.) in the independent Atlantic League.\n\n''That was a low point, not being able to get an offer after the good season I had last year,'' said Pride, responding to reporters after reading their lips. ''I had had five years at the major league level and I figured there'd be a team that would want to pick me up. I thought someone would need an experienced player. I was kind of frustrated, but I told myself to stay positive.''\n\nProbably the last place he expected to wind up was Yankee Stadium, but the Yankees, needing some outfield depth and a capable pinch-runner, decided to take a chance on a Pirates castoff.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
