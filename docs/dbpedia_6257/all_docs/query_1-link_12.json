        "text": "By NICK SABATELLO\n\nnsabatello@njherald.com\n\nAUGUSTA -- The Ottawa roster sheet reveals just about everything you need to know about Kyle Geiger.\n\nHe's listed as a 5-foot-11, 195-pound, right-handed hitting catcher.\n\nHe was born in May 1982. He lives in Greenwood, Ind. and played in New Britain, Conn. last season.\n\nIt leaves out the part about him owning the Skyhawks.\n\nGeiger went 3-for-4 in Ottawa's 9-5 victory over Sussex Thursday, snapping the Skyhawks' franchise record seven-game winning streak.\n\nIn 13 games against Sussex this season, Geiger is batting .473 (26-for-55).\n\n\"I'm not doing anything special against them,\" Geiger said. \"You try to take the same approach to every at-bat. It's just a matter of seeing the pitch and hitting it.\"\n\nHe insists there's no secret grudge he holds against the Hawks. He didn't even realize how well he was doing.\n\nSkyhawks manager Hal Lanier is just happy to see Geiger leave town. Lanier gave him a free trip to first base in the eighth. The next time Ottawa comes in he might be better off giving him a free trip to Hawaii.\n\n\"He's a pretty good hitter,\" Lanier said. \"They have a lot of pretty good hitters. I don't think their record speaks to how good of a team they are. They are tough. At least against us anyway.\"\n\nFive of last-place Ottawa's 23 wins have come against the Skyhawks. If Geiger owns Sussex, former Skyhawk Jabe Bergeron must be his Chief Executive Officer. Bergeron is batting .392 (22-for-56) against his former team. He was 1-for-4 with a homer and three RBIs Thursday.\n\nSussex ace Kyle Ruwe (10-5) took the loss, lasting 3 2/3 innings and allowing eight earned runs.\n\n\"It just wasn't Kyle's night,\" Lanier said. \"His ball was up in the zone and that's how you get hurt in this league. He just needs to turn the page.\n\n\"He's been outstanding for us all season. It was just one of those nights.\"\n\nThe Rapidz tagged him for three runs in the second on three doubles.\n\nAn inning later, Ottawa tacked on two more. The three runs he surrendered in the fourth sent Lanier to his bullpen.\n\nJamie Douglas answered the call, finishing the game and saving the bullpen from a long night.\n\n\"They hit everything I threw,\" Ruwe said. \"I didn't choose the best pitches in certain spots. And when I chose the right pitch, I didn't put it in the right place.\n\n\"(Douglas) threw the ball real well. There's no let down when we go to our bullpen. They've been great for us all season.\"\n\nThe Skyhawks received help from Brockton and Nashua Thursday. Since Brockton beat Quebec, 3-1, the Skyhawks stay 3 1/2 games behind Les Capitales for the second-half title.\n\nThey also remain four games ahead of New Jersey for the fourth and final playoff spot.\n\n\"We're playing really well,\" Ruwe said. \"One loss isn't gonna change that.\"\n\nHeading into Thursday, the Skyhawks were 9-1 in their previous 10. They fall to 10-3 in August and finish the homestand 5-1.\n\n\"It was nice to see us battle back,\" Lanier said. \"We just have to try to start another winning streak (tonight).\"\n\nSussex scored five unanswered before Ottawa slipped one past Douglas in the ninth.\n\nThe Skyhawks will travel to Nashua, N.H. tonight to play the first of three against the Pride."
