        "text": "Dear Downtowner,\n\nFor the past two years, Great American Downtown has worked with the City of Nashua Pride Committee to produce some great parades and festivals celebrating our LGBTQ+ family, friends, and neighbors, and Nashua’s welcoming spirit. With NH’s “Safer at Home” advisory still in place, we worked this year to put together a great virtual iteration of this event for 2020 – and we are so excited to enjoy the livestream with all of you tomorrow at 2pm!\n\nGreat American Downtown’s mission is to provide coordination, collaboration and partnerships that unify the entire Nashua community around a common vision for an attractive downtown that is vibrant, viable and truly reflects the character of our city. We are so proud to be a part of showcasing some great local talent and moving speakers – and are grateful for the opportunity to show off the quality of Nashua’s character. Our capacity to be open, accepting, affirming, and confident in our love for our neighbors is something that makes ours such a great community in which to live, love, work, and play.\n\nAs Pride Month comes to a close, let’s come together virtually to celebrate. We hope you will join us! More info, and links to the live-streamed event below!\n\nWarmly,\n\nPaul Shea\n\nExecutive Director\n\nGreat American Downtown\n\nSt. Philip Greek Food Festival\n\noffers pop-up event\n\nSaturday, June 27\n\n11 amâ 6 pm\n\nAre you sad that the annual St. Philip Greek Food Festival has to be postponed from May to October this year? Us, too! But great news: The church will give us a taste of our favorite Greek foods this weekend, by offering a drive-up mini event!\n\nSt. Philip Greek Orthodox Church will hold a GREEK FOOD POP-UP this Friday and Saturday from 11 amâ6 pm each day. They will be serving a limited menu including YiaYia’s famous meatballs, stuffed grape leaves with the secret egg-lemon sauce, spanakopita (spinach baked in filo pastry dough), cheese and spinach tiropita (triangles baked in filo) and of course, baklava!\n\nPRE-ORDER ONLINE HERE. Ordering is available now through the event dates, and call-in ordering is open on the days of the event at 603-889-4000.\n\nThis is a drive-thru event â please place your order before arriving at the church.\n\nSt. Philip Greek Orthodox Church is at 500 West Hollis Street. Visit the Facebook event page here.\n\nHelp young culinary students\n\nby donating to this scholarship fund!\n\nMola Foods presents culinary scholarship fund\n\nMola Foods â a local business that brings international flavors to Nashua â has announced the creation of a scholarship fund for aspiring chefs.\n\nCulinary students struggle with student loans after graduation because of the mediocre salary that they will be getting when starting working at restaurants. Many of them are bound to default on student loans and for this reason, Mola Foods is trying to help these student culinary dreams by providing them with a $500 scholarship to help pay their culinary program.\n\nMola Foods, Inc. creates seasonings, sauces, tea, chips and marinades from tastes and flavors from around the world, with the first being Mola Chili (TM). Relishes are made from authentic ancient Cameroonian tribal recipes that have survived by being passed from mother to daughter. Mola Foods sells a “world culture in a bottle,” with flavor and freshness.\n\nBe sure to visit Mola Foods at the Nashua Farmers Market every Sunday from 10 amâ 2 pm.\n\nYou can donate to the scholarship here. Those seeking the scholarship should contact them here.\n\nVisit Mola Food’s website and follow them on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nPartnership for Successful Living\n\nSince 1980, this group of organizations provides access to housing, primary and mental health care, substance use disorder treatment and prevention, education, employment, and supportive services to help individuals and families achieve sustainable independence.\n\nFour New Hampshire nonprofit agencies collaborate as members of the Partnership for Successful Living, creating an innovative network helping NH families and individuals solve many of lifeâs most challenging issues and gain sustainable independence.\n\nProgram services delivered through the Partnership members include:\n\nsubstance use disorder treatment, prevention, and recovery support services.\n\nprimary and preventive healthcare.\n\nHIV/AIDS education, case management, supportive services, affordable housing, and prevention.\n\nhealth care and homemaking services for elderly, disabled, and home bound individuals.\n\naffordable and supportive housing solutions for individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.\n\nWhile each of the Partnership members is a separate legal entity with its own 501(c)(3) status, mission, budget, and staff, they share back-end resources whenever it is efficient to do so, and collaborate on service delivery when it leads to better client outcomes.\n\nMost importantly, by sharing resources and working as one, the Partnership for Successful Living is able to coordinate a large variety of funding streams and, as a result, can better deliver a comprehensive array of interventions designed to empower individuals and families and ultimately build a stronger community without duplication.\n\nThe primary populations served include: very low to low income individuals who are chronically homeless or homeless individuals and families, homeless veterans and their families; individuals living with severe mental illness, substance use disorder, or co-occurring disorders; and individuals living with a chronic illness or disability such as HIV/AIDS, developmental disabilities.\n\nThe organizations are:\n\nHarbor Homes, Inc.creates and provides quality residential and supportive services for individuals, and their families, with mental illness and/or experiencing homelessness. www.harborhomes.org\n\nHealthy at Home, Inc. strives to enhance the lives of people with illness or injury through a cooperative relationship with the community, professional medical+ providers, and organizations that serve people in need of healthcare. www.healthyathome.org\n\nGreater Nashua Council on Alcoholism, Inc. provides comprehensive substance use treatment and recovery services to individuals and families in a supportive environment while providing a strategic framework for substance use prevention in New Hampshire.www.keystonehall.org\n\nMilford Regional Counseling Services, Inc. provides access to professional mental health care, regardless of income or geographical obstacles. www.mrcs.org\n\nThe Southern NH HIV/AIDS Task Force, Inc. increases the quality and availability of knowledge, services and resources in all matters relating to HIV infection and AIDS to the people in the Southern New Hampshire region, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, age, or sexual orientation. www.aidstaskforcenh.org\n\nWelcoming Light, Inc. provides event planning, quality training, technical assistance and staff development to the partnership agencies, for-profit businesses, government agencies, and other social service professionals to enhance their ability to provide mental health treatment, HIV/AIDS and minority health training and other related services. www.wli.org.\n\nRecent success stories from Partnership agencies includes:\n\nHarbor Homes and Keystone Hall have increased their ability to provide Medication Assisted Treatment by 300% in less than three years, thanks to fundraising and community support. Medication Assisted Treatment, or MAT for short, is considered an evidence-based best practice in the treatment of substance use disorders, including opioid use disorders and alcoholism.\n\nHarbor Homes Receives Funding to Help NH Veterans: Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of our veteran neighbors have found their places of employment closed, their hours sharply reduced, or lost their jobs entirely. As a result, more NH veterans are in tenuous financial circumstances. To make things worse, social distancing and proper hand-washing are next to impossible for those who end up homeless and live outdoors. To help combat this, we are grateful to be a recipient of additional federal funding that is earmarked to support the immediate needs of veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessnsess throughout NH. Through its Veterans FIRST programming, veterans and their families are stabilized in a safe environment, while Harbor Homes staff provides employment counseling, assistance with securing permanent housing, and a host of other wraparound support services.\n\nPartnership organizations are hiring! Want to help your community? Check out their career page here.\n\nTheir website is under construction, but you can follow them on Facebook or call them at (603) 882-3616 or email [email protected]."
