        "text": "MARION, Indiana — Spartans’ history is covered in competitive success, featuring an array of World Championship titles.\n\nEven still, at Tuesday night’s DCI Open Class World Championship Finals, the Nashua, New Hampshire corps received a title it hadn’t earned in decades — back-to-back champion.\n\n“This means the world to us,” Spartans drum major Ana Carolina Silva said. “We have been working so hard from November until now. We have people who have never played an instrument before or did anything drum corps related before, but they came in, and learned what they needed to learn to get to this moment. It’s just so amazing to be here.”\n\nSpartans, crowned the 2024 Open Class World Champion Tuesday at Indiana Wesleyan University’s Wildcat Stadium, won the corps’ second Open Class gold medal in a row and third in the last four competitive seasons.\n\nThe corps earned caption awards for general effect, visual proficiency, brass and color guard.\n\nView all scores from the DCI Open Class World Championship Finals\n\n“Everyone sees the side of the color guard where we’re performing, but few people see the hard work that goes into the performance,” Spartans color guard member Rae Layah said. “Us winning the color guard caption award really shows how hard we worked all season.”\n\n1. Spartans » 82.963\n\n2. Blue Devils B » 82.475\n\n3. Gold » 79.800\n\nIn the northern California corps’ first trip to the DCI World Championships since 2022, Blue Devils B earned its 13th medal in as many Open Class championship appearances, dating back to 2008.\n\nBlue Devils B also took home the caption award for percussion.\n\n“We’ve been waiting for this moment for a very long time, so to be right here, right now means a lot to everybody,” Blue Devils B drum major Mason Khan said. “We finally get to show the world who we are.”\n\nMuch like its Golden State brethren, Gold also continued a streak of medalist finishes. Since earning its first-ever top-three Open Class finish in 2018, Gold has earned bronze and silver medals at five consecutive championship events.\n\n“This is my third year with the corps, and being able to see all that competitive success makes me so happy,” Gold drum major Charlie Ly said. “Tonight’s run was a very emotional one for all of us. The members have worked so hard to put the show on the field.”\n\n4. The Battalion » 79.188\n\n5. Columbians » 78.550\n\n6. River City Rhythm » 76.675\n\nIn its 10th anniversary season, The Battalion made significant history, earning its highest-ever Open Class ranking and Open Class championship score. The Salt Lake City corps was also awarded the Open Class title of “Most Improved.”\n\nPrior to 2024, The Battalion had attended the DCI World Championships twice, taking seventh place in Open Class in 2022, and fifth a year ago. After finishing less than two points shy of the DCI World Championship Semifinals cutoff in 2022 and 2023, the Utah corps’ focus will now shift to events in Indianapolis as it aims to earn more historic milestones.\n\n“I’m honestly so humbled to be a part of the corps’ growth,” Battalion drum major Reece Davis said. “To be able to be with all the members, to feel their energy and be able to call myself a part of that is really something special. Being able to see the growth from when I started marching to where we are now fills me up with pride.”\n\n2024’s Open Class Finals marked Columbians’ second appearance at the Marion, Indiana event, and its second time ranking among the Open Class top five. On the scoresheets the Tri Cities, Washington corps ranked ahead of The Battalion in general effect 1 and visual analysis.\n\nRiver City Rhythm rounded out the top six with a wide gap of more than three points between itself and the remainder of Tuesday’s Open Class competitors, while finishing ahead of Columbians in percussion.\n\nWith a sixth-place ranking, River City Rhythm locked up its highest Open Class finish ever, and shattered its previous all-time high Open Class Finals score of 73.300, earned in 2018.\n\n“It’s hard to put into words,” River City Rhythm drum major Haley Herem said about the crowd’s reception to the corps’ 2024 production “Mine” on Tuesday night. “It means the world to me to see so much support from people who are not just for the corps, but people who are for the idea of drum corps.”\n\n7. Raiders » 73.375\n\n8. Colt Cadets » 72.050\n\n9. 7th Regiment » 71.225\n\n10. Les Stentors » 67.225\n\nOne of 2024’s more significant movers up the Open Class standings, Raiders — who took 10th a year ago — earned a seventh-place position, which marked the corps’ highest Open Class ranking since 2010.\n\nThe New Jersey corps improved upon its 2023 Open Class Finals tally by nearly five points, and fended off Colt Cadets by a slim margin thanks in large part to a sizable lead in general effect.\n\n“Tonight’s run was the best run we’ve had all season,” Mary Lopez said. “The success of the corps has been growing every day.”\n\nColt Cadets and 7th Regiment were two of the more closely-contested corps at Tuesday night’s event, separated by just 0.825 points.\n\nWhile 7th Regiment outscored Colt Cadets in general effect 2 and visual proficiency, leads in most other captions helped the Dubuque, Iowa corps earn its highest Open Class ranking ever.\n\n“There’s just so much energy within the corps when they step inside this stadium,” Colt Cadets drum major Luke Ortega said. “We were really excited to perform, and I really hope the corps is happy with that run.”\n\nLes Stentors, which landed in 10th place, improved upon its 2023 Open Class Finals score by 1.325 points.\n\nAll 10 of Tuesday’s competitors will make their way to Indianapolis for DCI World Championship events to be held Thursday, Friday and Saturday at Lucas Oil Stadium."
