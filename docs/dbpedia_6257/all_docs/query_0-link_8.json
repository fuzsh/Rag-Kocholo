        "text": "Third baseman Jeff LaHair went 4 for 5 with a double and a home run last night, sparking the Tornadoes over the Nashua Pride, 5-2, in Worcester’s first appearance at Holman Stadium.\n\nThe Tornadoes, who have won eight of their last 10, improved to 17-12 and moved into sole possession of second place in the Can-Am League, one game behind the Sussex Skyhawks.\n\nSussex was idle after its home game against the New Haven County Cutters was postponed because of rain, the second consecutive rainout for the Skyhawks.\n\nThis was the Tornadoes’ first game against the Pride, who played for the previous eight seasons in the independent full-season Atlantic League.\n\nStarting pitcher Junior Guerrero improved to 5-2, allowing only one run on six hits in six innings. David Byard pitched a perfect ninth inning to pick up his fifth save.\n\nOnix Mercado homered in the ninth inning for the Tornadoes, who left 16 runners on base. Nashua stranded 12.\n\nSecond baseman Ricardo Cordova went 2 for 3 and scored a run for the Pride (11-18), which has lost four straight. Bryan Duplissie, in his first professional start out of Franklin Pierce College, pitched 5-2/3 innings to take the loss for Nashua.\n\nThe four-game series resumes at 7 tonight, with Matt Weagle scheduled to start for Worcester against Jack Creighton.\n\nNew Jersey dealt starter John Kelly to Brockton in exchange for right-hander Jason Wylie. Kelly, who was dealt from North Shore to the Jackals in the offseason, had expressed a desire to pitch closer to his home in Leominster.\n\nKelly, playing in his 13th season of pro baseball, led the Can-Am League in wins last year. He was 2-2 with a 4.59 ERA for the Jackals this season, striking out 24 in 33-1/3 innings.\n\nWylie was 2-3 with a 4.15 ERA in 12 games for Brockton.\n\nTornadoes outfielder Josh Beauregard was selected as the Can-Am League’s Batter of the Week for the week of June 19-25."
