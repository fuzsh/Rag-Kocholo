        "text": "So far, this season has been either hit or miss for the Brockton Rox’s lineup.\n\nThis past weekend, the Rox piled on the hits at the expense of the Nashua Pride.\n\nThe Rox collected double-digit runs for the second consecutive game as they pummeled the Pride, 11-3.\n\nThe Rox’s 20-hit attack gave pitcher Rolando Viera his 21st career victory in a Rox uniform, tying the franchise record.\n\nComing off a 13-5 win Saturday night in which they collected 18 hits, the Brockton bats continued their recent tear.\n\nSince being shut out on May 29th, the Rox have scored 32 runs on 51 hits in three games.\n\n“They’ve really found their stride,” Rox manager Chris Miyake said of his lineup in which every batter had at least two hits Sunday. “Now, everything is falling in and we hope to keep it going.”\n\nViera evened his season mark at 1-1 with five solid innings before leaving the game in the sixth, two batters after taking a line drive off of his leg.\n\nThe Rox lefty allowed three runs on eight hits and struck out six.\n\nThe Rox gave Viera an early 2-0 lead and made it 4-0 in the fourth when Matt Maloney slugged a two-run homer to left.\n\nStaked to a 6-1 lead, Viera ran into trouble in the sixth where the Pride opened the inning with four straight hits, including the liner off Viera’s shin.\n\nFirst baseman Bryan Duplissie then hit a two-run double and when Viera issued a walk to load the bases with none out, Miyake brought in reliever James Baker.\n\nBaker got a shallow fly out to right and then a double play to end the threat.\n\nThe Rox put the game out of reach with five runs in the sixth. Second baseman Melvin Falu, the Can-Am League’s leading hitter, struck the big blow of the inning with a bases-loaded two-run double.\n\nBrockton travels to Sussex County, N.J., tonight to take on the Skyhawks for the second time this season."
