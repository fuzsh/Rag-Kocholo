        "text": "Many playing careers have been jump-started in the Can-Am League over the years and Brian Daubach is hoping the same is true for coaches.\n\nThe new batting coach for the Nashua Pride was in town yesterday getting his team ready to face the Tornadoes, before a heavy rain after batting practice soaked the outfield and flooded the visitors’ dugout, causing the game to be canceled. Daubach was a cult hero of sorts with the Red Sox from 1999-2002 and again on Boston’s World Series squad in 2004. After stints with the New York Mets in 2005 and the St. Louis Cardinals’ Triple-A team in 2006, a hand injury forced him to retire.\n\nHe spent a year away from the game just to make sure playing was out of his system, and now the 36-year-old said he’s looking to begin a new career path in baseball, this time in coaching.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if I was going to do it, but then I came back to Boston a few weeks ago, and I was doing some stuff with the Red Sox and (radio station) WEEI,” Daubach said. “When I came back and saw those people in New England, I had some memories come back. This is where I made my name in baseball.”\n\nDaubach has wanted to get into coaching for quite some time and said he was lucky to hook on with a club at midseason. Usually affiliated teams hire coaches around August and September, but Nashua had an opening since the first month of the season when Richie Hebner left to become the manager of the Frederick Keys in the Baltimore organization after their manager stepped down.\n\n“Obviously my goal is to get back to the big leagues,” Daubach said, “but I’m getting experience here and hopefully I’ll help the Pride while I’m here.”\n\nDaubach said he had some mutual friends with the Nashua front office, and they let the Pride know he would be amenable to a hitting coach job. Nashua is always looking to employ former Red Sox players, so the Pride jumped at the chance to hire Daubach. He will be reunited with former Red Sox teammate Rich Garces and will join former major leaguers Rick Miller and John Roper on the coaching staff.\n\nIn the later part of his career, Daubach was splitting time between the majors and Triple A, and he realized a lot of teammates came to him for help on their games.\n\n“Being a veteran a lot of younger guys were coming to me, and even though I wasn’t trying to step on our hitting coach’s toes, it was a nice feeling to help out like that. I was still playing and seeing the same stuff they were.”\n\nDaubach said yesterday he is strictly a hitting coach for the Pride and has no intentions to activate himself. Of course, that may change by the end of the year.\n\n“(Wednesday) night we were getting no-hit through eight innings and I was almost ready to grab a bat,” Daubach laughed. He is confident his playing days are behind him, even though the Pride could certainly use the help both on the field and at the gate.\n\n“Last year I didn’t play at all and I realized I was done playing,” Daubach said. “Sometimes you have to step back and reevaluate things and get it out of you.”\n\nFor now, Daubach is content with retooling the Pride bats, which rank last in the Can-Am League in hitting with a .253 team average and a league-high 264 strikeouts. He’s also going to explore a career in the media, as the Pride will let him continue making appearances on WEEI as he finds his radio voice.\n\n“I like either (playing or radio/TV), to be honest with you,” Daubach said. “As long as I’m around the game of baseball, I’m happy. I was a sports fan longer than I was a baseball player.”\n\nLast night’s game is tentatively scheduled to be made up on Thursday, July 10 at 6:05 p.m. as part of a doubleheader with the Pride. The Tornadoes head to Brockton at 7 tonight to start a four-game series with the Rox.\n\nFormer Southbridge High and Franklin Pierce College standout Keith Renaud took batting practice with Nashua before the game. Renaud hit .358 for the Ravens this year with 8 homers, 56 RBIs and 19 stolen bases. Renaud was talking to the Tornadoes earlier this month, but the sides couldn’t agree to a deal, and Worcester acquired outfielder Josh Farkes instead."
