        "text": "This paper traces the history of the narrative of Mary going to the temple at the age of three from the Prot. Jas. to the official celebration of this event as a great feast in the Byzantine church. The literary origins of this narrative and the authority this narrative had in early Christianity shows that narratives such as this one could morph in meaning and function from one text to another quite freely, while still retaining its basic literary authority. The narrative’s movement to become a separate great feast was far from straightforward, though its development out of an already well developed theological and eschatological setting influenced how this narrative was exegeted thereafter. Hence, in the homilies and hymnography of this feast the theological message of this event becomes not just a way to understand Mary by reference to Old Testament images, but it becomes a way to understand the mysteries of the Incarnation and salvation. Therefore, not only should the apocryphal basis of this feast be respected, but the feast itself should be recognized as having a very important theological message.\n\nImages of cities and their architecture are significant as works of art as well as source for history and culture. They are special case of representation of landscape that is of great importance for understanding and visualizing the world. Within the first, mostly schematized paintings of Medieval European cities that appeared only in the 15 C. the city has been turned into a formula that reduced it into a sum of important elements like gate, tower, and church in its center. The city walls with battlements and towers were symbol of power and sovereignty. The Ancient city depictions and small images of urban architecture within the maps were two dimensional or single-dimensional. Architecture and landscape depicted in the Byzantine icon paintings , and the Macedonian collection of icons show beautiful architecture of ancient origin, or modern eastern-Byzantine style buildings, and high quality stone used for capitals and columns. The architecture within the icons becomes independent and equally important part as the depiction of saints. It becomes an icon. Naturalistic and illusionistic representations are regarded as false, because humans cannot fully comprehend the God created world in its entirety. Byzantine paintings show reversed linear perspective , thus creating the illusion of expanding images in the distance. The impression of being looked upon or encircled by God is emitted, alluding thus to God's omnipresence. The heavenly space was visualized as the imperial palace and vice versa, political ideology dictated that the sacred palace and the imperial court be seen as replicas of the heavenly kingdom and the heavenly order. The images of buildings, parts of cities or church furniture with baldachin from the post byzantine period represent modern architecture. The number of ciboria used, many details , intensive colors of building facades plus various church models are the main differences with the previous period. Buildings are oriented in the same direction as the figures in the foreground. The Temple Veil as the flesh of Christ became an image of his sacrifice and one of the most widespread symbols in Christian culture. Buildings develop around the figures or the scene, or from the left to the right side, or repeat the same angle and position of the figures. There are three nave and one nave churches, or simple straight walls ending with barracks, and walls as bridges connecting buildings from the left to the right side. The wall behind the figures denoting the fortification of the Heavenly Jerusalem may have many towers, and even watchers from the windows, flying monochromatic figures etc.\n\nThis dissertation re-contextualizes the types, uses, and meanings of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period (843–1204). Relics are the remains of—or the materials associated with—Christ, the Mother of God, apostles, martyrs, and saints. For the faithful, they were the physical presence of the divine, imbued with miraculous power and grace. Reliquaries are the containers that enshrined, protected, and displayed this sacred matter. They are/were made of lavish materials—gold, silver, gems, and pearls—which conferred honor upon, and testified to the spiritual value of, the contents. Numerous Middle Byzantine reliquaries survive or are known through textual descriptions, but there has not been a study that examines these objects as a group. This dissertation fills this gap, charting out a paradigm for understanding the forms and functions of these objects. I take as my focus those reliquaries inscribed with metrical inscriptions, or epigrams. These texts provide a great deal of information about reliquaries, and they served a variety of functions—as ex-voto prayers, as expressions of identity, as performative texts, and as descriptions of the objects that they accompany. I demonstrate that epigrams are also visual, functioning as but one part of the reliquaries’ complex visual programs in which word, image, and sacred matter converge, complement, and interact with each other. I examine the mechanisms of these interactions, revealing the messages they conveyed on behalf of the patrons and the ways in which reliquaries and epigrams functioned in the artistic and literary culture of Byzantium. Chapter 1, “Introduction,” defines the critical terms of this dissertation, presents an overview of the scholarship, and outlines my methodological contributions. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the reader to the forms and functions of reliquaries in the Middle Byzantine period, and are thus the foundation for the dissertation. Chapter 2 outlines the different types of reliquaries that were inscribed with epigrams. It presents aspects of their design and form, including imagery and the placement of the epigrams. Chapter 3 provides a brief historical survey of the various contexts in which reliquaries were used, from personal possessions to public veneration practices. Chapters 4–6 focus on epigrams. Chapter 4 examines the ways in which epigrams—both in content and placement—function to make relics visually and haptically accessible to the faithful. Chapter 5 explores the relationship between reliquary and metaphor. What are the ways in which the ekphrastic character of epigrams describes, interprets, and presents reliquaries for and to their owners? Chapter 6 situates reliquaries in the context of religious gift-giving by addressing the various ways in which a patron articulates his/her identity, connection with a holy figure, and what he/she hopes to receive in return. Chapter 7 presents my conclusions concerning the forms of reliquaries, relic accessibility, viewer interpretations, and patron motivations. The Appendices catalogue the 74 Middle Byzantine reliquaries inscribed with epigrams. The case studies I present in these chapters demonstrate that Middle Byzantine reliquaries with epigrams are/were a complex system of texts, images, relics, and materials that interact with each other. I demonstrate that epigrams—in addition to being textual—have visual and spatial dimensions, wrapping the exterior, interior, front, back, and sides of reliquaries. They are dynamic texts that pulled the viewers in and taught them how to see, interpret, and handle the reliquaries, and how to access relics."
