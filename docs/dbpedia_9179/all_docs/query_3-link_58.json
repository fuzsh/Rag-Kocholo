During World War I, the British and French seized the southern part of the Ottoman Empire and parceled it out between themselves. The Treaty of Sèvres (1920-08-10) mandated Syria and Lebanon to France. Syria and Lebanon became independent and separate countries on 1944-01-01. Syria formed a union with Egypt, the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.), on 1958-02-01. They both became regions of the U.A.R. Syria withdrew from the union on 1961-09-29.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nArabic: al-Jumhuriya al-Arabiya as-Suriya (formal)\n\nDanish: Syrien\n\nDutch: Syrië, Syrische Arabische Republiek (formal)\n\nEnglish: Syrian Arab Republic (formal)\n\nFinnish: Syyria\n\nFrench: Syrie f, République f Arabe Syrienne (formal)\n\nGerman: Syrien, Arabische Republik f Syrien n (formal)\n\nIcelandic: Sýrland\n\nItalian: Siria f\n\nNorwegian: Den arabiske republikk Syria (formal) (Bokmål), Den arabiske republikken Syria (formal) (Nynorsk), Syria\n\nPortuguese: Síria, República f Árabe Síria f (formal)\n\nRussian: Сирийская Арабская Республика (formal), Сирия\n\nSpanish: Siria, República f Árabe Siria f (formal)\n\nSwedish: Syrien\n\nTurkish: Suriye Arap Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nSyria is probably from Phoenician tsur: rock\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nSyria is divided into fourteen muhafazah (provinces, or governorates).\n\nProvinceHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²) AleppoSY.HLSY094,045,16618,4987,142 Al ḤasakahSY.HASY011,275,11823,3349,009 Ar RaqqahSY.RASY04793,51419,6187,575 As Suwaydā'SY.SUSY05313,2315,5502,143 DamascusSY.DISY131,552,16111846 Dar`āSY.DRSY06843,4783,7301,440 Dayr az ZawrSY.DYSY071,004,74733,06012,765 HamaSY.HMSY101,384,95310,1633,924 ḤimṣSY.HISY111,529,40240,94015,807 IdlibSY.IDSY121,258,4276,0972,354 LatakiaSY.LASY02879,5512,297887 QuneitraSY.QUSY0366,5931,861719 Rif DimashqSY.RDSY082,273,07418,0186,957 ŢarţūsSY.TASY14701,3951,896732 14 provinces17,920,810185,18071,498\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.
