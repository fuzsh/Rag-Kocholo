        "text": "A car bomb exploded at a busy intersection in the coastal Syrian city of Latakia, killing one civilian and wounding 14, state-run media reported.\n\nTuesday’s blast was the second in Syria‘s government-controlled areas in the last two days, shattering a sense of relative calm in these territories that had somewhat stabilised after major advances by troops against rebel groups in different parts of the country.\n\nSyria’s state-run media said the explosion took place in the city’s al-Hammam Square. It also said specialised units dismantled a second bomb before it went off at the same location.\n\n“The terrorist explosion caused the death of one civilian and wounded 14 others,” it said, citing a top health official in the province.\n\nMost of those wounded were hit by shrapnel, the director of the city’s Tishrin hospital, Louay Naddaf, told state television.\n\nFootage broadcast on television showed people gathered around the wreckage of a smouldering car.\n\nLatakia has been a government stronghold since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011.\n\nBut the province has been targeted in “sporadic strikes” by rebel groups, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor.\n\nThe region borders the last major area outside of the government’s control, which includes much of Idlib province as well as adjacent parts of Hama and Aleppo provinces.\n\nThe blast came two days after an explosion struck a neighbourhood in the capital, Damascus. No casualties were reported.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, said it was rare for attacks to take place in government-controlled territories, which raises questions about security in those areas.\n\nKhodr said analysts who appeared on Syrian state media were warning that this might mark a “new phase in the conflict”.\n\nSyria’s war, now in its eighth year, has killed nearly half a million people and forced more than half of its prewar population from their homes."
