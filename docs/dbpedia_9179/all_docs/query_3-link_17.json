A “mandate”, was a legal right of a nation to administer a territory captured during WW1 in behalf of the League of Nations. In 1920, the Syria/Lebanon region was placed under French mandate and was divided into six sub-regions: Damascus, Aleppo, Alawites, Jubal Druze, the Sanjak of Alexandretta and Greater Lebanon.\n\nThe Alawites are located in the mountainous coastal region of central Syria.\n\nThe Alawite people are known to follow a particular “secretive” sect of Shia Islam, and for centuries maintained their distinction in this small corner of the Ottoman Empire. Through much of the rule of the Ottomans, most of the Alawites remained as peasants, primarily dominated by majority Sunnis in the rest of Syria and the Empire. While initially separated in the 1920 mandate, as the French began to consolidate power in the region, the Alawites were combined with Damascus and Aleppo into the Syrian Federation in 1922.\n\nWhen the federation was solidified into the “State of Syria” on 1 Dec, 1924, the Alawites refused to be part of the new state, instead choosing to create their own identity by forming the Alawite State. As the Alawites were somewhat separated from Syria, both in geography and religion, they had little participation in the unsuccessful “Great Syrian revolt” of 1925-1926 against the French.\n\nSunni landowners living in the more urban areas of the state, began advocating joining a greater Syria state, while the more rural Alawites supported continued separation. In a French concession to Arab nationalists, Alawite State was renamed the “Government of Latakia” on 22 Sept, 1930. As Arab nationalistic fervor continued to grow, the voice of the Sunnis were able to marginalize the Alawite protests and eventually on 5 Dec, 1936 Latakia re-joined Syria. Full independence was granted to Syria in 17 April 1946, as the mandate period came to a close.\n\nStamps\n\nALBUM\n\nFor Alawite State, stamps of France and Syria were overprinted and surcharged France and Syria in both French (Alaouites) and Arabic (العلويون) and used for postage. When the state transitioned to become the Government of Latakia, the practice of overprinting Syrian stamps for postage continued.\n\nBeginning in 1931, 22 stamps of Syria were overprinted in red or black with the new name: “LATTAQUIE” in French and “اللاذقية” in Arabic. Additionally, 11 Air Post and 2 Postage Due stamps were also issued with the same overprints.\n\nSince all Stamps from Latakia are overprints, there are some rarely seen variations, such as inverts, double overprints, and variations in color.\n\nStamps of Latakia were replaced with stamps of Syria in 1937.\n\nBanknotes\n\nThe Lebanese-Syrian Livre (Pound) were used throughout the French Madated area of Syria/Lebanon.\n\nLinks"
