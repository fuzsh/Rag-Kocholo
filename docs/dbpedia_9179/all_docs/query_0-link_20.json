        "text": "Introduction:\n\nBanias or Baniyas is a city of northwestern Syria, located at the foot of the hill of Qalaat el-Marquab, 55 km to the south of Latakia (ancient Laodicea) and 35 km north of Tartus (ancient Tortosa), and a Catholic titular see under the Latin name of Balanea, which is presently vacant.\n\nIt is famous for its orchards and its export of wood. Today it is best known for its oil refinery. It still contains citrus fruit orchards surrounded by green hills. On one of the hills is the imposing Margat Citadel, a huge fortress of black basalt stone."
