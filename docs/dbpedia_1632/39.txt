The History

The Type 15

While the 1956 Lotus Eleven sports racing car was still an international front-runner in the 1100cc classes, and the new Type 14 Elite road car was moving into production, by 1958 Chapman was looking to add further depth to his range of race cars with the launch of a larger engined version of the Eleven. This broadly mirrored the concept of the earlier 1500cc engined Mark VIII being followed by the larger engined 2000cc Mark X.

The 1957 single seater Lotus 12 had taken full advantage of the newly introduced Coventry Climax FPF engine series and Chapman was quick to see the potential of the larger capacity versions of this new engine in his next sports racing car.

The new car, the Type 15, looked very much like the Eleven but with an enlarged radiator opening, lowered frontal area, and aerodynamically improved windscreen with a lipped top edge. It also included a range of the technical features designed for the single seater Type 12. The car’s lowered frontal profile was achieved by canting the Coventry Climax FPF engine to lie virtually on its side. Engine capacity could be varied considerably with four options eventually ranging from 1475cc up to 2495cc.

The first Team Lotus Type 15 made its racing debut on 7 April 1958 in the Sussex Trophy race at Goodwood, driven by Graham Hill. The car impressed immediately by setting a new lap record but dropped out of the race with gearbox problems, an issue which had been troubling Lotus for some time. At this time Lotus were still using their own Lotus designed “Queer Box” transaxle/gearbox units. Nine of these Queer Box fitted “Series 1” Type 15s had already been produced when an alternative BMC transmission was sourced and made available from July 1958 in “Series 2” cars. Eight of these new Series Two cars were produced between July and December 1958.

But apart from the ‘Queer Box‘ issue, for most of its first season the Type 15 suffered from a range of mechanical problems whether brought about by its various re-design features or the stresses arising from the use of the larger capacity engines.

Both works and privately entered Type 15s (of which 27 were made overall) were campaigned with varying levels of success in both the UK and abroad between 1958 and 1960. Team Lotus fielded two Type 15s at Le Mans in 1958. Hill and Allison’s 2-litre entry proved extremely fast (5th fastest overall in practice, ahead of the 3-litre works Ferraris!) however this car plus the smaller engined 1.5-litre entry of Jay Chamberlain and Pete Lovely both retired early. By this time the extreme sideways canting of the cars’ engines had been causing lubrication problems so this canting was considerably reduced for the Le Mans cars (and for all future production models) leading to the appearance of a distinctive long narrow bulge on the bonnet.

A “Series 3” Type 15 was developed for 1959 featuring a number of upgrades aimed at improving the car’s reliability including a strengthened frame, differently configured front suspension, and updated bodywork. These Series Three cars were made available with either a (by now improved) Lotus “Queer Box” or BMC transmission. And by this time the Coventry Climax FPF series also included a substantially uprated 2.5-litre engine that was being used by Lotus in its F1 spec Type 12 cars. Naturally, a number of these found their way into some Type 15s and to clear the top of these engines an even larger bonnet bulge, now with front air scoop, became a feature on “big engined” S2 and S3 cars.

On the home front, one of the most successful Type 15s was that of race car owner John Coomb’s whose superbly prepared and well-developed 2-litre car made the headlines in the Sports Car event at the 1958 British GP meeting at the hands of Roy Salvadori, beating all the larger capacity cars apart from Stirling Moss’ Lister Jaguar. And later in 1958 Salvadori beat all the big-engined Lister opposition to triumph in the high profile Oulton Park International meeting.

A further Team Lotus appearance at the 1959 Le Mans event in a 2.5-litre Type 15 unfortunately proved no more successful than 1958, but the Type 15s continued to race widely at club events both at home and abroad. Its days however were effectively numbered as new more competitive rear-engined cars were by now beginning to appear across the race scene.

The second Team Lotus Type 15 to appear in the 1958 Le Mans event was the 1.5-litre engined car (#35) driven by Chamberlain and Lovely. It too retired relatively early.

The Type 17

In 1959, still persevering with front-engined design, Lotus released their intended replacement for their all-conquering 1100cc Type Eleven, the Type 17 sports racing car. The new Len Terry designed car was visually impressive, being much smaller and lower than its predecessor Type Eleven and it was also 110lb lighter. Two engine choices were available, both from Coventry Climax, the well tried and tested 1100cc FWA or the even smaller capacity 750cc FWM. Unfortunately for Lotus, the new car suffered serious handling problems right from the outset and while this was eventually resolved with a revised front suspension layout, the Type 17 failed in virtually every way to emulate its illustrious Type Eleven predecessor.

In support of the sole Team Lotus 2.5-litre Type 15 entry, in 1959 two privately owned Type 17s were entered in the annual Le Mans event, both housing diminutive 745cc Coventry-Climax FWMA engines. While the little cars proved promisingly quick, (the Stacey/Green car was in fact clocked as the fastest ever 750cc class car to race at Le Mans), the Taylor/Sieff car lasted only 23 laps before retiring with distributor failure. The Stacey/Green entry fared somewhat better but it too was forced to retire after 156 laps with a blown head-gasket.

Even with the improved handling tweaks from Lotus, few privateers looked beyond the car’s early woes and only 23 Type 17s were made (compared to some 270 Type Elevens!). And by the end of 1959 the 1100cc class laurels had been completely wrested from Lotus by Eric Broadley’s now all-conquering front-engined Mark 1 Lolas.

But in any case, the days of all front-engined sports racers were effectively coming to an end. And the next new Lotus sports racing cars to hit the circuits were all to follow the rear-engined trend being so emphatically set by Formula 1.

But more about that in a future article.

The Models

Unlike the Lotus Eleven, the Type 15 has been much less widely modelled and the Type 17 even less so. Indeed I am not aware of any contemporary models of either car.

One of the earliest Type 15 kits came from pioneer UK producers of 1:43 scale white-metal models Mikansue. And (almost inevitably) a scratch built wooden model of a Type 15 was produced by French artisan RD Marmande.

In the mid-1990s models of both the Type 15 and Type 17 were released in 1:24 scale resin for the slotcar market by Japanese producer H. Model. In more recent times we have (thankfully) seen the resin cast market show a modest degree of interest led by Italian producer Pinko who produced in 1:43 scale both Team Lotus Type 15 entries from the 1958 Le Mans event.

Resin bodied kits of Type 15s were produced also by Provence Moulage whose 1958 Le Mans entry driven by Cliff Allison and Graham Hill (#26) I have in my collection. This model features very clearly the defined Type 15 elongated “bonnet bulge” brought about by the reduced canting of the car’s Climax engine.

More recently French based MEA Kit 43 has released models of a Type 15 raced at Silverstone by Graham Hill (#5) in 1958 and the 2.5-litre Hill/Jolly Type 15 (#30) from the 1959 Le Mans event. In addition, MEA has also released a particularly unusual version of the Type 15 as raced by Harry Entwistle and Bob Hanna (#27) in the 1959 Sebring 12 Hours. These two 1959 models both feature the more bulbous bonnet bulge and front air scoop of the later Type 15s.

In 1:76 scale, Tony Bellm’s 1980’s “Piccolino” range offered a tiny white metal kit of a Type 15, one of which I am pleased to also have in my own collection.

Probably due in part to its relative failure on the racetrack, models of the Type 17 are much rarer still than the Type 15. The enterprising Mike Serrurier from South Africa may have been the very first to produce a 1:43 scale kit of a Type 17 while more recently MEA Kit 43 has released a resin based Type 17 in both kit and built versions. My collection includes an MEA Kit 43 factory built model of the Stacey/Greene Type 17 (#53) from the 1959 Le Mans event. The photographs accompanying this article feature a particularly well finished version of this same kit built by Hugo Kuijjer.

An interesting direct comparison in model form between the Lotus Eleven and its successor Type 17 showing clearly the much lower lines of the Type 17. The Eleven (#36) is built from a Provence Moulage kit while the Type 17 (#53) is an MEA Kit 43 factory build.

Another interesting group pic showing the significant evolution of front engined Lotus sports racing cars in the five short years between 1954 and 1959. #42 is a 1954 Mk VIII (MEA Kit 43), #48 is a 1955 Mk IX (Spark), #71 is a 1955 Mk X (MEA Kit 43), #36 is a 1956 Eleven (Provence Moulage), #26 is a 1958 Type 15 (Provence Moulage), and #53 is a 1959 Type 17 (MEA Kit 43). The size difference between the Mk VIII and the Type 17 is remarkable! This was the last front engined Lotus sports racer.
