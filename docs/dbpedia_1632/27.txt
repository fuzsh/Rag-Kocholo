For lowering the center of gravity, the Climax engine was tilted 28o from vertical in Series I. But due to problems in lubrication, in series II the inclination was reduced in 17o from vertical

"Queer Box" transaxle: sequential-shift five speed gearbox and a ZF limited slip differential in a common magnesium housing with a dry sump lubrication system (Like a motorcycle transmission, constant mesh gears and a simple fore-and-aft gearchange mechanism promised very quick gear changes)

Series I, used ZF/Lotus "Queer Box"

Series II (since Le Mans '58) and III (1959) used BMC B-series of ZF 4 speed manual gearbox for 2.0 lt and over and "Queer Box" only for 1.5 lt engines
