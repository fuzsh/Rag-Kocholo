        "text": "Footnotes\n\nThis most attractive and potentially very competitive Formula Junior Lotus 18 is thought to have been exported from the world-leading British factory to the United States, or perhaps more specifically to Mexico, in 1960. A batch of the cars had been ordered, perhaps with the assistance of 'Papa' Rodriguez, influential father of the world-famous Mexican racing brothers Pedro and Ricardo.\n\nInto the early 1990s this particular car had been converted for use in American autocross events, campaigned by a Mr Ratta, resident in Lorena, Texas. The chassis frame had been equipped with a wedge-shaped body and the running gear incorporated Lotus Type 41 front suspension and wheels from the later 1960s period.\n\nFor its American autocross use the car had been fitted with a 1600cc cross-flow Formula Ford 'Kent' engine. We are advised that the chassis still bears a stamp apparently applied by Texas border Customs, reading 'TEX 100968'.\n\nThe Lotus Type 18 was Colin Chapman's first rear-engined racing car design to reach production. It was initially a tailor-made design intended to accept a 2½-litre Coventry-Climax FPF 4-cylinder twin-cam engine for Formula 1. Virtually identical chassis/body assemblies with smaller fuel tanks equipped with 1 ½-litre Climax FPF power units then qualified for International Formula 2 use while a very much simplified rear-engined chassis frame along similar lines was fitted commonly with Ford 105E-based 998cc 4-cylinder production-based engines for Formula Junior.\n\nThe most successful of the Ford-engined Formula Junior tuning companies involved with these cars was Cosworth Engineering, whose power units breathed through twin-choke Weber 40 DCOE 40 carburettors, and which revved to a safe limit of 9,500rpm. These units drove through a Renault Dauphine-derived 4-speed close-ratio transaxle unit. To buy a Formula Junior Lotus 18 complete in 1960 would set back an enthusiastic new owner £1276 5s 0d complete ex-works.\n\nWhile Colin Chapman and his Lotus company had been relatively late in following the successful Cooper lead into rear-engined configuration – saving weight, complexity and frontal area - their Type 18 promptly achieved enormous success in every Formula to which it was tailored. Stirling Moss won the 1960 Formula 1 Monaco and United States Grands Prix, works No 1 driver Innes Ireland won in both Formula 1 and Formula 2 Type 18s, and the great motor-cycle multiple World Champion John Surtees made his F2 and F1 debuts in Type 18s. Above all, the Formula Junior Lotus 18s won almost everywhere they appeared, driven most notably by future Team Lotus Formula 1 stars, Jim Clark and Trevor Taylor. The\n\nfirst ever Cosworth-tuned Ford Formula Junior engine had meanwhile appeared in a prototype Type 18 FJ at the Brands Hatch Boxing Day meeting, 1959.\n\nAs now offered here, this Lotus-Ford Type 18 is a 2003 Class B Championship Winner (before Class restructuring - now Class C) and has benefited from a recent ground-up restoration in which Peter Denty Racing carried out the chassis refurbishment. The car features new wishbones, radius arms, brakes, all hydraulics, correct radiator, wiring loom etc. It is HLR-registered and is eligible for the Goodwood Revival Meeting whenever that event's feature Formula Junior event caters for the relevant year-batch of cars. (This particular car was invited and competed in last year's (2010) Chichester Cup race for Formula Junior at the Goodwood Revival).\n\nThis Lot is accompanied by a large spares package including a spare 1000cc engine (presently requiring a rebuild), wheels, suspension components and several spare engine blocks, heads and spare gearbox (also requiring overhaul) plus other miscellaneous items.\n\nIt is also supported by old-style FIA papers, current FIA HTP documentation, an RAC logbook, proof of tax-paid importation, a race history sample and relevant Historic Lotus Register articles.\n\nFormula Junior is one of the best supported of all present day Historic racing categories, packed with great cars, nice people and providing tremendous sporting entertainment for all participants around so many of the motor racing world's most illustrious venues. Here we offer a fine introduction for a newcomer, and a potentially very competitive contender for an experienced FJ old-hand."
