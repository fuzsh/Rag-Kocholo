As such, these units are not available on an Express dispatch or Next Day delivery. Please contact us for availability / Lead Time.This unit is based on a Denso 1.4kW starter motor which has been modified to suit this particular application.All of our starter motors are 100% brand new and are built to the highest standards to withstand the rigours of all forms of motoring including Road, Race & Rallying.Each unit is a direct replacement for the original starter motor and weighs less than the original with 2 - 3 time the power output.Every Denso starter motor mounts in a unique circular stepped register which enables it to be spun 360 degrees on its own axis with ease giving the unit an infinite number of mounting positions.Please note, if you require a multi-drilled end plate to enable the motor to be mounted in different locations please let us know at the time of ordering and we can supply these at no additional cost.The image shown is for illustration purposes only.",
