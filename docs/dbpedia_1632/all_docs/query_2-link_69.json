McLaren Engines built the aluminum Chevrolet “big-block” V8 engines for the McLaren cars that dominated Can-Am sports car racing from 1967 to 1971, and the Offenhauser engines that won the 1974 and 1976 Indianapolis 500-mile races. Team McLaren withdrew from the Can-Am series after the 1972 season and closed its IndyCar team at the end of the 1979 season to concentrate on Formula 1 in Europe. Following the departure of Team McLaren, McLaren Engines continued as a race shop, working with other Indy teams and expanded its scope of services to all forms of racing. It also took on an increasing number of non-racing projects, eventually morphing into an engineering services provider to the automotive industry. I had heard about McLaren Engines during the Can-Am era, when I was a college student and auto racing enthusiast. I watched Bruce McLaren win the 1969 Can-Am title at Texas World Speedway and saw him close up along with fellow Kiwi and McLaren team driver Denny Hulme in the paddock following the race, where Stirling Moss presented the championship trophy. I noticed that Bruce had a slight limp but thought it was just something minor related to his driving that day. I learned later about the childhood orthopedic condition that caused it. During the 1980s, I met McLaren Engines founder H. William “Bill” Smith and he asked me to provide legal assistance to McLaren Engines in Michigan, as the company planned a major expansion.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nI soon joined the company as the director of operations, working with company leaders Gary Knutson and Wiley McCoy to implement the plan, which included purchasing and completely renovating the building where McLaren Engines started. I also took on a sales and marketing role and became involved with the 1987 Buick GNX and 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo programs in addition to winning new customers, including the Ford Motor Co. Later, during the 1990s, I became a consultant, advising McLaren Engines on various legal and commercial matters. In 2009 McLaren engaged me to facilitate McLaren’s 40th anniversary event. There are many “McLaren” companies founded by or other­ wise directly related to Bruce McLaren, beginning with Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. in 1964. McLaren Engines, Inc., was the second company bearing his name. It was changed to McLaren Performance Technologies during 2000 before being acquired by Linamar Corp. in 2003. The company was then renamed McLaren Engineering in 2016. Other McLaren companies include McLaren North America, Inc., founded by Mayer and Smith during the 1970s to carry out racing projects with BMW North America. Nicholson McLaren Engines was founded in the U.K. by Mayer, Alexander, and John Nicholson to build engines for Formula 1 cars. McLaren International is the successor to Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. Going forward, we will ensure continuity by referring to the subject company, McLaren Engines, Inc., and its successors McLaren Performance Technologies, Inc., and McLaren Engineering as simply “McLaren.” Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. will be known as “BMMR” and the other McLaren companies will be addressed by their full names.\n\nxi\n\nacknowledgments\n\nThe idea of a McLaren Engines1 history came up when I was helping plan the 40th anniversary of the company in 2008. I was working with Wiley McCoy, then CEO of the company, and Scott Maxwell, then the general manager. Following a short discussion, we tabled the idea in favor of concentrating on the anniversary celebration. Wiley contacted me in 2015 to revive the history concept. I was, of course, all for it, but with a sense of urgency born of the loss of important voices from the past, brought on by the recent passing of Teddy Mayer and the serious illness of Tyler Alexander, who would soon pass away. We needed to interview the old timers before it was too late—and Wiley himself was admittedly in that category (a status that I have now achieved). When I mentioned the company’s impending 50th anniversary and suggested 1\n\nNow known as “McLaren Engineering.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nwe might also want to plan for it, he said, “Plan? I’m so old, I don’t even buy green bananas.” I collaborated on this story with Wiley and could never have completed it without his constant help—not only with company history (he was and continues to be the longest-tenured employee/ chief executive/technical leader/consultant for the company) but also for his strong mentorship. Thanks to then-McLaren General Manager Scott Maxwell. Without his support this book would never have been possible. We interviewed the late Bill Smith, a founding partner with Bruce McLaren and Teddy Mayer, as well as original General Manager Colin Beanland. I am also grateful to Colin’s wife Karen, the first McLaren Engines secretary, for her recollections. The late George Bolthoff, McLaren Engines’ first development engineer and engine builder, gave a concise overview of his history and work with McLaren. He was arranging to send a CD containing historical records, but he died before he could do so. Don Ewald, his longtime friend and fellow drag racer sent the CD later. Thanks also to Gary Knutson, the legendary racing engine guru who Bruce McLaren hired to work for BMMR in 1965, and Roger Bailey, who came to McLaren at the end of 1970. Bailey was the super salesman of McLaren’s Turbo DFV Indy engines and later led the BMW 320 Turbo racing program. He patiently endured hours of interviews and continuous phone calls and emails from me as I tried to get everything straight. I met Bailey in the 1990s through Jim Kinsler, owner of the Kinsler Fuel Injection company, who worked with McLaren on the fuel injection system for the Buick V6 and Cadillac racing engines and provided services for the McLaren Can-Am team’s Lucas injec­ tion components in 1970–71 (and for most other Can-Am teams).\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAt that time, I didn’t know that Bailey was one of the first McLaren Engines employees. I knew him only as the Indy Lights manager and that he was once Chris Amon’s racing mechanic at Ferrari. Thanks to Steve Widman for his stories about developing the Chevrolet marine and industrial business, and especially for his account of the epic “Project 734,” the 6.0-liter turbo­ charged Chevrolet big-block offshore racing engine for Mercury Marine. Thanks also to Bruce Falls for his account of his years at McLaren Engines, developing control systems for turbocharged marine engines and for the Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo, among many other projects. We were also lucky to have a weekend with the late Bill Smith and his wife Patsy at their home in Norwich, New York. I am grateful also to Alan Anderson, Dr. Tony Attard, Howden Ganley, Alec Greaves, and John Nicholson for their help in telling their part of story.

And I owe a great debt of gratitude to former McLaren Engines Indy team chief mechanic/crew chief Steve Roby, who contributed his detailed history of McLaren Indy car racing and the McLaren Turbo DFV program (see Appendix for the latter) and whose photographs grace many of these pages.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n© Larry Neuzel\n\nforeword\n\nIt was fall of 1972 and McLaren team’s Teddy Mayer flew to Indianapolis to meet with me. I was at the track, tire testing for Goodyear with the Gerhardt car. Teddy and I had breakfast together at the Holiday Inn, not far from the track. He outlined the deal. I agreed to it, and that was that. I was given the oppor­ tunity of my life. I would be driving for Team McLaren. In my early days with McLaren, two gentlemen—Bill Smith and Teddy Mayer—owned the McLaren Engines shop in Livonia, Michigan. Gary Knutson was chief engineer. Roger Bailey was the Indy engine man at the time. There they built the Turbo Offices for Indy while maintaining the British-made racing cars during the season. They had also built the big-block Chevy Can-Am engines until the year before I arrived. They also did research work for General Motors and any other manufacturer who wanted to develop secret projects.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nEveryone McLaren employed in the States — Americans, Brits, New Zealanders, and Australians — worked out of this shop. The job of organizing, the most important aspect of professional auto racing, was left to Tyler Alexander, who served as team manager. He was one of the best racing professionals I have ever worked with. They were like a family, a family of hard workers, and a culturally diverse family at that. Racing was their business as well as their passion. This was a team that was willing to work together to win — to be the best of the best! I could tell right away that I had found the magic. McLaren was a racing business. It was not a hobby. I always told my wife Betty that if I ever found a team that loved racing as much as I did, I’d be a winner. How true that was. We set track records, won two Indy 500s, and were victorious in many other races while I was there. When McLaren discontinued racing in the United States after the 1979 season, I moved to the Chaparral Indy car team and added one more Indy 500 win in 1980. Meanwhile McLaren Engines continued on at full speed, building racing engines and, more importantly, expanding its R&D work for the auto industry. This book chronicles the compa­ ny’s transition from racing to engineering R&D for the auto industry: work on marine engines, high-performance nichemarket cars such as the Buick GNX and the Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo, supercharger applications development, and eventually serious work on electric vehicle powertrain which continues at a fast pace today. I believe that the lessons learned from racing must have certainly transferred to the company’s R&D, engineering, and manufacturing activities. Creativity, attention to detail, hard work, and a drive to meet immovable deadlines are all qualities of successful racers and also successful businesses.\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nForeword\n\nDuring this time Bill and Teddy sold the company, and I understand that after several years it was acquired by Linamar Corporation. The new facilities on the original Eight Mile Road site are certainly impressive.\n\nMcLaren Engines hasn’t given up racing completely, though. The engines it services for Lamborghini won their third straight Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in January 2020 and the IMSA GTD championship in 2018 and 2019. Johnny Rutherford\n\n© Linamar\n\n© Linamar\n\npreface: two men, two visions The year was 1956. Significant events were taking place for two young men in widely different regions of the world—events that would have far-reaching consequences for each of them. One region was bathed in optimism while the other was the scene of a mortal struggle. While the two events were as different Bruce McLaren as one could imagine, these young men were risking their lives in hopes of a brilliant future. One of them, Bruce McLaren, a young New Zealander engineering student, risked it all—his engineering career and indeed his life—for a chance to become a professional racing driver at the highest level of motorsport. The other, a Hungarian soldier named Ferenc Hasenfratz, risked everything, including his Frank Hasenfratz life, to save his country. These two events would indirectly lead to the creation of two international business enterprises that would come together 50 years later in America. In January 1956, McLaren took his father’s place in a major support race for the biggest racing event in his country, the New Zealand Grand Prix. It was what he called his “lucky break” and it would lead to fantastic successes in New Zealand, Australia, England, Europe, Canada, and America. He founded a company in England named Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. (BMMR), from which came some of the most dominant road-racing cars that ever took to the track in North America. He also founded a company there, called McLaren Engines, Inc., which would build the powerful engines for those amazing cars and house that unbeatable McLaren racing team.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nMeanwhile in Hungary, Ferenc (Frank) Hasenfratz was fleeing for his life. In October 1956, he had joined a revolution in Hungary that began on October 23. The revolution deposed the Sovietdominated puppet government, drove occupying troops of the Soviet Union out of the capital, Budapest, and established a new government. Hasenfratz was elected a member of the Revolutionary Council, but the revolution collapsed when no foreign government responded to its desperate cries for assis­ tance. Moscow, after waiting a week and confirming that the outside world would not respond, sent its troops into Budapest on November 4 and the killing began. It was all over by November 11. Hasenfratz fled the country via a harrowing trek, arriving in Austria on November 22. By December he was in Italy, where he paused before embarking to Canada aboard an Italian freighter on May 7, 1957. He arrived in Quebec City 8 days later. During the next few years, Hasenfratz established himself as a machinist near Guelph, Ontario. In the early 1960s he started a machining and manufacturing company named H & M, which grew rapidly and in 1966 was re-established as Linamar Corporation. In 2003, Linamar bought McLaren Engines (then known as McLaren Performance Technologies, Inc.), 2 based in Livonia, Michigan. We will follow the McLaren branch of this story in the following pages. The Linamar story is told in the book Driven to Succeed: How Frank Hasenfratz Grew Linamar from Guelph to Global.3 2 3\n\nIn 2016 McLaren Performance Technologies was renamed McLaren Engineering.

(BMMR) headquarters in Colnbrook, England. “I was always first in and there was the telex,” said Nicholson. McLaren Engines general manager Colin Beanland soon arrived with his wife Karen, the company secretary. Colin noticed the concerned look on Nicholson’s face, and asked him what was wrong. Nicholson answered, “Bruce has been killed.” Bruce McLaren, 32, a native of New Zealand and the founder of Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. (BMMR), died in an accident earlier that day at the Goodwood race circuit near Chichester, England, while testing the company’s revised Can-Am racing car, the M8D. The car’s rear bodywork detached at high speed on the fastest section of the circuit, where the M8D could reach 180 mph. The rear wing of the car went with the bodywork, causing the loss of all aerodynamic down force and throwing the car off the road into an old earthen enclosure used by course officials during races. The violent crash broke the car apart; there was no possibility of survival.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n3\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER 1 The Beginning: Tragedy and Perseverance\n\nStunned, Beanland asked himself, “What do we do now?” He immediately called the U.K. headquarters and asked for Teddy Mayer, an American who was Bruce’s partner in BMMR. Mayer confirmed the terrible news. “Ted referred to my friendship with Bruce and said, ‘If you need some time off…’” but Beanland could not do that. The first race of the important 1970 CanadianAmerican Challenge (Can-Am) racing season was two weeks away, and he was vitally involved in the preparations. It wasn’t possible for him to take time off. The new M8D was expected to continue the company’s threeyear dominance of the Can-Am, America’s premier road racing series. Bruce and teammate Denis Hulme, a fellow “Kiwi,” had dominated the Can-Am since 1967, its second year. The McLaren team won all 11 of the races during the previous season and had just opened McLaren Engines, Inc. in Livonia, near Detroit, to support the team. Bruce, along with Americans Edward Everett “Teddy” Mayer and Mayer’s friend, former racer H. William “Bill” Smith, a businessman based in Norwich, New York, founded The Engine Company (as Smith usually called it) in November 1969. Its mission was to build the Chevrolet engines for the McLaren Can-Am cars that were competing in the American series. It was also to build the Offenhauser engines for the new McLaren M15 single seaters that raced for the first time at the Indianapolis 500-mile race on Saturday, May 30, 1970, two days before Bruce’s death. The new company also housed the race teams and provided logistics during the racing season. It was effectively McLaren’s North American headquarters. Engineer George Bolthoff, a former professional drag racer from California, ran the engine shop and was a director of the new company. He built the all-conquering Chevrolet Can-Am racing engines in England during the 1969 season and came to\n\nDetroit with Beanland to set up the shop for the upcoming 1970 season. “I found out [that Bruce died] when I came in to work that morning. It was devastating.” Tyler Alexander was in Indianapolis in the aftermath of BMMR’s first foray into the just-completed Indianapolis 500, running the new M15. He was having breakfast with Bruce’s friend, competitor, and sometime racing teammate Dan Gurney, when he was called to the phone to receive the news from Mayer. Alexander was one of the first BMMR employees and the McLaren racing team’s crew chief. He thought, “What the hell do we do now?”1 He flew back to England, to the McLaren headquarters in Colnbrook, near Heathrow Airport. “Of course, the factory was in a terrible state, with the feeling of doom and gloom as the shock, sadness and uncertainty all came to the surface,” he said. “It’s times like these when you have to get a hold of yourself and keep people together—in this case, the people who helped to make Bruce McLaren Motor Racing the team that it was. It was now time to use the things that we all had learned from Bruce, without showing personal sorrow. It was then that Teddy stood up in front of everyone at the factory and said, with no fuss or preamble, but in standard Mayer-speak, ‘We all realize that something not very pleasant has happened, but we have a company called Bruce McLaren Motor Racing, and it has a Can-Am race in two weeks—so best we get on with it!’”2 The McLaren team now had to build a replacement for the wrecked car and get both cars to the first race at Mosport Park\n\nAlexander, T., Tyler Alexander: A Life and Times with McLaren, David Bull Publishing, Phoenix, AZ, 2015, 97. 2 Ibid., p. 98. 1\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nnear Toronto on June 14.

They raced cars together, along with other friends, including Phil Kerr, who eventually joined McLaren in England. Bruce proved to be an exceptionally gifted racing driver. In 1957, he won the New Zealand International Grand Prix Association’s first “Driver to Europe” scholarship, which provided financial support for the 1958 racing season in Europe. Bruce went to the U.K. on the scholarship and Colin accompanied him to help run Bruce’s Cooper racing car. They found accommodations at The Royal Oak pub, which was just behind the Cooper Car Company works in Surbiton, Surrey, a suburb southwest of London.1 Cooper designed, built, and raced the cars Bruce drove in New Zealand and would now drive in Europe.\n\n1 The Cooper works, located at Hollyfield Road, received an English Heritage commemorative “Blue Plaque” on August 16, 2018.

Brabham was quite close to the McLaren family, basing his racing cars at the McLaren Garage when racing in New Zealand. He took notice of Bruce’s skills, not only in driving but particularly in his perceptive and intuitive engineering aptitude. Brabham said in his autobiography that he originally met Bruce at the New Zealand Grand Prix. Bruce’s father introduced them. “Bruce was a very keen youngster who read all the right books and probably knew more about engineering and racing cars than I did,” said Brabham. “I shall always remember how enthusiastic Bruce was.”2 Bruce sold the Cooper upon arriving in England and upgraded to a new Formula 2 model, which he and Colin built themselves from raw parts off the factory tube rack. The story was told that, when Bruce arrived at the factory, he asked where his new car was—and was directed to the steel tubing on a nearby rack from which he would have to build his own chassis, as did all the teams in those days. Roger Bailey3 said, “You didn’t buy a chassis from Coopers. You bought a pile of tubes; John Cooper would give you a jig and Ernie4 would help you weld it.” Bruce had already started fabrication by the time Beanland arrived and joined him in completing the car.\n\nFIGURE 2.1 Bruce and Colin with Bruce’s new Cooper F2 car.

That result put him firmly on the map in the road-racing world. He finished fifth overall, behind four F1 cars and was only 10 seconds behind a Ferrari team car driven by Wolfgang von Trips. Ian Burgess, also driving a Cooper, was Bruce’s main competition during the season with the prize being a possible Cooper works drive for 1959, according to Beanland. Beanland had a big thrill at the AVUS track in Berlin when he got to drive Bruce’s Cooper on the track. The circuit layout separated the paddock from the pits in such a way that the race cars had to drive all the way around the track to reach the pits. When Beanland got into the car to move it, Bruce said, “Have a go!” Colin was taken aback but decided to do just that, booting the Cooper down the Autobahn straight and through the high banking at speed before completing the circuit at the pits.\n\n© Courtesy of Revs Institute, Karl Ludvigsen Photograph Collection\n\nFIGURE 2.2 Bruce McLaren (R) and Ian Burgess with their Formula 2 Coopers near the AVUS track in Germany during the 1958 season. Burgess was injured in a crash during the race and missed the rest of the season.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n9\n\nDuring the race, Beanland saw a Cooper in a big crash some distance from his vantage point in the pits but did not know who it was until he saw Bruce go by. Unfortunately, it was Burgess. He was injured and out for the season. Bruce continued to do well during the rest of the season and was rewarded with an invitation to join the factory team for 1959. “When we got off the plane in Auckland,” said Beanland, “We were surprised to see that there was a crowd of people cheering Bruce and throwing their hats in the air.” Bruce was initially slated to run another season in F2, but Cooper—realizing Bruce’s great talent—decided he would be Jack Brabham’s teammate in F1, joining Masten Gregory, the American from Kansas City, who was already in place as a team driver. Bruce got off to a great start to the 1959 season by finishing fifth in the Monaco Grand Prix, his first-ever F1 race, which Brabham won. Bruce didn’t run in the Dutch GP, but Brabham took second and Gregory was third. Bruce came back to finish fifth in the French Grand Prix, with Brabham third while Gregory didn’t finish. The British GP at Aintree saw Bruce finish third while sensationally sharing fastest lap with Stirling Moss, who finished second to winner Brabham. Neither Bruce nor Jack finished the next two races, while Gregory took a second at one of them but was later injured in a crash and could not participate further. Coming into the last race of the season, The United States Grand Prix, held at Sebring, Florida, Brabham was leading the championship. But Stirling Moss and Maurice Trintignant, driving Coopers, were within striking distance. If one of the three drivers won the race and scored the single point for fastest race lap, he would be world champion. Moss took the lead at the start of the race and pulled out a 10-second gap over Brabham. McLaren followed closely in third. Trintignant had trouble and was well back. Then on the fifth lap\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 2 Bruce McLaren: Driver to Europe\n\nMoss fell out of the race, as Trintignant began a determined charge. He gained ground with each lap and recorded the fastest lap as he moved into third place, but Jack and Bruce were well ahead. FIGURE 2.3 McLaren takes his F1 Cooper T-51 through the hairpin at Sebring on the\n\n© Courtesy of Revs Institute, Karl Ludvigsen Photograph Collection\n\nway to his sensational victory in the 1959 United States Grand Prix.\n\nThen two turns from the end of the race Brabham ran out of fuel. “I coasted on down until we reached the second last corner, when Bruce came alongside me, almost stopping. Bruce was horrified … he had vague ideas of stopping to help me.”5 If he had done that, Trintignant could slip by to win the race, and the championship. Luckily, Bruce got back on the gas and drove the final 800 yards to become the youngest-ever F1 race winner at age 22. Trintignant finished second, so Brabham won the 1959 World Championship, pushing his car across the finish line in fourth place. McLaren started the 1960 F1 season with a win in Argentina, becoming the youngest driver ever to lead the Formula 1 Championship. He eventually ended up second in the series to Brabham who took the title for the second straight time. Following the season, Brabham left to start his own racing team. Bruce remained with Cooper, staying on through 1965. But he had plans.\n\n5\n\nJack Brabham, p. 139.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n3\n\nRev-Em Racing: Teddy, Tyler, and Bill Teddy Mayer, then a Cornell University law school student (he graduated in 1962), his brother Timmy, along with friends Tyler Alexander and Peter Revson formed a Formula Junior racing team in the eastern U.S. called “Rev-Em Racing.” Soon after, they invited Bill Smith, to join them.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n13\n\n14\n\nCHAPTER 3 Rev-Em Racing: Teddy, Tyler, and Bill\n\nFIGURE 3.1 H.W. “Bill” Smith (R), Teddy Mayer (center), and an unidentified person in\n\nFIGURE 3.2 Bill Smith on a victory lap in his Cooper.\n\n© barcboys.com\n\n© barcboys.com\n\nfront of Smith’s Ford store in Norwich, New York, with the three Rev Em Racing Cooper Formula Junior team cars.

Teddy Mayer, then in law school, served as team manager. They were friends having fun while creating a tradition of winning everything in sight.\n\nI didn’t even know I had to join the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA)—the sanctioning body then for road racing in the United States. I ran it [the Elva] on the back roads around my home. The car was so low I was lucky I didn’t get killed. That car was just terrible, but through it, I met Teddy Mayer. His brother Timmy had a Cooper Formula Junior. Then I read about Lotus and bought the new Lotus 20. I won at Watkins Glen with that car. By then, Teddy had acquired another Cooper and made a deal with Peter Revson to run it. They got together and started Rev-Em, and then added me to it.\n\nAlexander, Mayer, and Smith met Bruce McLaren during these years because Formula Junior served as a support race series at the United States Grand Prix and at other races in which Bruce competed. This led to their coming together when Bruce formed his own racing company. In 1963, Timmy did a season in Formula Junior with Ken Tyrrell’s factory-supported Cooper team,2 which led to an invitation to run F1 with Cooper in 1964.\n\n2\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nTimmy also raced a Cooper Monaco sports car that year.\n\n© Pete Lyons\n\nBruce McLaren bought the ex-Roger Penske Zerex Special, modified the chassis and rear suspension, installed a Traco-build Oldsmobile F-85 engine and re-named it the Cooper-Oldsmobile.

(BMMR) The Tasman Cooper In 1963, Bruce wanted Cooper to build two cars for the new 2.5-liter Tasman Series, which was to be staged in New Zealand and Australia during the winter of 1963–1964. Racing events Down Under were attended by many top drivers from Europe during their off season. Cooper declined, probably because the factory needed to get the F1 cars ready for next season. However, Cooper did agree to let Bruce build the cars himself. So, McLaren set up a new company, called Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. (BMMR) to build and run the cars. The company’s directors were Bruce, his wife Patty, and Eoin Young, a journalist friend from New Zealand who served as Bruce’s secretary/public relations agent at that time. Teddy Mayer made a deal with Bruce for his brother Timmy to drive one of the cars and contributed the 2.7-liter Coventry Climax FPF 4-cylinder engines from Timmy’s Cooper Monaco sports car. They fitted new short-stroke crankshafts to get\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n17\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 4 Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. (BMMR)\n\nthe engines down to the 2.5-liter Tasman engine displacement limit. Bruce’s Kiwi friend Wally Willmott1 and Tyler Alexander a certified aircraft airframe and powerplant mechanic—built two new “slimline” Coopers. They were similar to the Cooper F1 cars, but they had smaller fuel tanks (the Tasman races were shorter than those in F1) and narrower cockpits with stressed skin panels to stiffen the center section. They also added a new trailing-arm rear suspension with coil springs, replacing the traditional Cooper transverse leaf spring arrangement. Painted dark green with silver stripes, the cars would be called Coopers in deference to Bruce’s contract with that company, even FIGURE 4.1 The sleek and sparse Tasman Cooper, one of two built by the new Bruce\n\n© Roger Bailey collection\n\nMcLaren Motor Racing (BMMR) team for the 1964 winter race series in New Zealand and Australia. Mayer provided the Coventry Climax engines to the enterprise. The author counts this as the first McLaren because the BMMR crew built it to Bruce’s design—especially the completely new rear chassis structure and suspension.\n\n1\n\nBruce’s close friend Willmott came to England in 1962 (he was a part-time racer in New Zealand; running a Ford Special and a 500cc Cooper-Norton) and became Bruce’s personal mechanic. He left in 1967 to get married and live in Australia.\n\nthough the back half of the chassis and rear suspension was designed by Bruce and the entire car was built by the new BMMR team. Alexander was set to handle Timmy’s car. Colin Beanland joined Tyler for all eight races,2 while Willmott worked with Bruce. The Tasman series went exceedingly well for the team as Bruce won three races, finished second twice and third twice, and had already clinched the championship as they went to the last race, on March 2 at Longford, Tasmania, a circuit made up of public roads. Timmy had two seconds and two thirds at that point. The Longford track was the fastest in the series, but it was undulating and very bumpy, with two narrow bridges, an “S” bend under a viaduct, and a railroad grade crossing. Disaster struck at Longford corner during practice on Friday when Timmy’s car got airborne over the hump at King's Bridge. It landed wrong, got away from him and crashed against a tree. Mayer was ejected and died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Bruce parked his own car for the rest of the day and the next, but he participated in the main event on Sunday, starting at the back of the field. He finished second, while Graham Hill won in a Brabham. Teddy arranged to get everyone—Timmy’s wife Garrill, Alexander, and Timmy’s remains—back to the family home in Pennsylvania. After the funeral, Teddy received a phone call from Bruce that would bring Mayer and Alexander back to McLaren.\n\nCooper-Oldsmobile—The Zerex Special Bruce was looking for new opportunities.

Bruce asked Mayer to finalize the purchase and ship the car to the U.K. in time for the Oulton Park Trophy race, scheduled for April 11, 1964. Alexander left immediately for Pensacola, Florida, to pick up the car along with a new Tracobuilt Oldsmobile F-85 engine in a crate.3 He then drove nonstop back to New York to air-ship the car to England and follow there to help Willmott prepare the car for the race, which was only three days away. Bruce qualified the Cooper third at Oulton Park but did not finish. He won the next weekend’s Aintree 200 and also won the International Sports Car Race at Silverstone on May 2. After that, Bruce directed Alexander and Willmott to cut the chassis apart and insert a new back half that had room for the wider aluminum V8. They worked from a wire model Bruce had created. They changed the rear suspension to match the trailing-arm design Bruce created for the Tasman Cooper. There was no time to build an exhaust system for the new Olds V8, because the car had to be at Mosport for the Players 200, a major North American event, so they installed eight exhaust stacks that pointed up through the bodywork—and left them uncut—just haphazardly sticking out of the engine bay. This was rather uncharacteristic of a McLaren project.\n\n19\n\nThe car was then hustled to the airport and sent to New York, where Bill Smith took it to his Norwich shop to await the team’s arrival. “I sent Barney down to pick it up at the airport in New York,” said Smith: The car was … ugly. They never finished the exhaust pipes. It sat outdoors—I put a tarp on it until they got it ready and took it to the race at Mosport, in Canada. Jim Hall was there\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 4 Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd. (BMMR)\n\nwith the Chaparral. [Bruce’s] car kept throwing oil out. Right in the center of the block was an air vent and I got an orange juice can and some steel wool—put some holes in it and got by. The car was the fastest one there. So that was the first McLaren car. As Smith said, these cars, the “Cooper-Oldsmobile” and the Tasman Cooper, could possibly be called the first McLarens except for political considerations—Bruce was still on the Cooper team, and the cars, of course, were only half McLaren. Well, with Bruce driving they were more than half McLaren.

Like the CooperOldsmobile, the car was powered by the Olds F-85 V8. Featuring aluminum cylinder block and heads, the F-85 pushrod V8 was introduced by Oldsmobile in 1960 for the 1961 model year along with a similar engine for Buick. The two GM engines had virtually identical blocks, with capaci­ ties of 215 in.3 (3.5 liters). Both blocks extended below the crankshaft centerline for strength. Their only difference was the Olds used six bolts to attach the cylinder head and Buick used only five. Cranks and connecting rods were identical, but they had different pistons, cylinder heads, and inlet manifolds. Racers immediately adopted the engines for competition, taking advantage of their low mass. The Olds version weighed 266 lb. without starter, generator, and cast-iron exhaust manifolds. The almost-identical Buick version had a similar weight.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n23\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nThe Buick V8 was used in Mickey Thompson’s Harvey Aluminum Special, driven by Dan Gurney in the 1962 Indianapolis 500. The Mickey Thompson Buick engine was reportedly bored out to 256 in.3 (4.2 liters) as allowed by the United States Auto Club (USAC) rules and produced 330 hp at 6500 rpm with a 14.5:1 compression ratio. Repco, the Australian auto parts maker, used the Olds F-85 block as the basis of its single-overhead-cam racing engine that Jack Brabham and teammate Dennis Hulme used in their Brabham-Repcos to win the 1966 and 1967 Formula 1 World Championships.\n\nRacers always want more performance, so builders increased the Olds V8’s displacement—first to 4.5 liters, then 5 liters. The resultant increase in horsepower and torque proved to be too much for the cylinder block structure holding the rotating assembly—the crankshaft, rods, and pistons. Traco Engineering added a main bearing saddle, a ladder-like structure that enclosed and supported the main bearing caps. All of this was expensive, but Bruce’s philosophy was to have the lightest weight possible. The other teams were using the small-block Chevrolet V8, some enlarged to 365 in.3, also Traco-built, that delivered much more horsepower—but they were 100 lb. heavier.\n\nFIGURE 5.1 Traco-built Oldsmobile V8 in the McLaren M1B prototype. Bruce favored\n\nGary Knutson\n\nthis lightweight engine over the more powerful, but heavier, Chevrolet small-block V8—until the results of a test at Goodwood convinced him otherwise.\n\nTyler Alexander photo\n\nEngine engineer Gary Knutson came to McLaren in 1966 from Jim Hall’s Chaparral team. Knutson originally joined Chaparral after college through Hall’s younger brother Chuck, a fellow racing enthusiast whom he met in Colorado. The two hit it off. Knutson won a hot rod hill climb in Colorado when he was 16 years old, driving his friend’s ’32 Ford coupe powered by a Ford flathead V8 with ARDUN overhead-valve hemispherical cylinder heads that he built himself. Later he raced a Lotus 11, but his forte was building racing engines.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nFIGURE 5.2 Gary Knutson, age 16, with his Ardun Ford V8 in a friend’s 1932 Ford.

I met them all at races. Spent a week with them at Nassau Speed Week. I left Chaparral when they were going long distance racing. I didn’t want any part of that. I moved to Aspen in December of ‘65 to practice my skiing. In the spring [of 1966] Smith and Teddy and [Teddy’s wife] Sally showed up. They decided I should go to work for them in England.”\n\nThe F1 Indy Ford\n\nKnutson: “Boulder was my home. That’s where I got to know Chuck Hall, Jim’s brother. He was a good friend of mine from high school—the Fountain Valley School for boys. Their older brother sent these guys, Mike, Colleen and Chuck Hall, away to schools when their parents were killed with a sister in a private plane crash. I met Chuck down there. Didn’t know who he was. That’s what started the whole thing. I was Chuck’s contribution to Chaparral cars.” Knutson said that Chuck paid his salary with Chaparral, so he didn’t actually report to Jim. © 2020 SAE International\n\n© Courtesy of Revs Institute, Karl Ludvigsen Photograph Collection\n\n© Gary Knutson\n\nFIGURE 5.3 Teddy Mayer and Bruce McLaren with the converted Ford “Four-Cam” V8powered McLaren at the United States Grand Prix. The engine did not have the horsepower to go along with its extremely loud exhaust.\n\n26\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nWhen he joined McLaren, Knutson worked on the Ford Indy engine to convert its displacement to 3.0 liters for the 1966 F1 racing season. McLaren did not have a suitable engine for the new 3-liter formula. So, Bill Smith contacted Ford vice president Lee Iacocca to get the Indy engine. “I wrote to Iacocca. He said, ‘You know, they cost a lot.’ I said, ‘We need the stuff.’ Teddy took over from there. McLaren bought five Ford Indy engines. That was when Gary Knutson got involved.” Motoring journalist Eoin Young provided some details about the program in a letter to Road & Track magazine: “Klaus von Rucker was engaged as an engine design consultant when we first investigated the Indy Ford as a three-liter GP unit. He worked with Gary Knutson and English engine man Bill Lacey. These three worked out the route to take.” After some work in England, Knutson moved the development program to Traco’s engine shop in Los Angeles; George Bolthoff was there and remembered the project. Young said, “We are hoping for a reliable 330-350 horsepower for Monaco.” But there were problems with the engine. “We couldn’t get the compression ratio high enough,” said Knutson. “And the ports were way too big for a three-liter engine, so it couldn’t produce the torque needed to get the car out of the corners on a road course. But it sure produced a robust exhaust note. Too much, in fact,” he said. “Imagine racers complaining about engine noise! It was during the F1 race at Monaco, so the sound was bouncing off all the tall buildings around the course,” he added. McLaren temporarily gave up on the Ford and tried the Italian Serenissima road car engine. “I don’t know who got the idea,” Knutson said, “but Serenissima’s people were impressive. They shipped it to us and some Italians came with it.” The M166 3-liter V8 did not fit the car’s transmission, so the Italians, “went back to Italy on Friday and came back on Monday with a bell housing that they cast and machined over weekend.\n\nNearly killed them. But they did it and it was fine. Bolted right together. We couldn’t believe it.” But the engine lacked power—and reliability, so McLaren reverted to the Ford engine, but it wasn’t good enough. Finally, the team received the BRM V12 they had ordered some time earlier, but it wasn’t the solution either. McLaren’s F1 program struggled for want of a good engine until they acquired the new Cosworth DFV V8 for the 1968 season.1\n\nThe Chevrolet “Small Block” Though Bruce McLaren favored the aluminum Olds F-85 V8 because of its light weight, the rest of the McLaren team wanted the Chevrolet engine, but it took some convincing. Beanland recounted: The [F-85] was a tremendously expensive engine to build because of all the machining to get to five liters. You can imagine how fragile it was and there were gusset plates inside the timing cover behind the camshaft timing gear and so forth and also in the bell housing. And it was cross braced at the crankshaft simply with holes for the rods to go through—slots, that would be—to try and keep this thing together. Bruce was very keen on that Olds engine because it was light, and he maintained and defended his position many times because it weighed 100 lb. less than the Chevy engine. But the economics of it were that the Chevrolet engine was a relatively inexpensive engine to build, they simply put 1\n\n“In ’66 we should have used a three-liter [pushrod] Olds instead of the Ford,” Beanland reflected recently. “Three liters would have survived where the five-liter [Olds Can-Am engines] only lasted six hours, and that’s for an $8,000 engine.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nin a better set of con rods and the Moldex crank and so forth and basically that’s really all the deviation was from stock parts. The Olds engine from Traco was probably $8,000 or $9,000 where you could buy a $3,000 Al Bartz or Traco Chevrolet engine.\n\n27\n\nFIGURE 5.4 Bruce with Alexander and the M1B at Saint-Jovite with the new Webercarbureted small-block Chevy.\n\nAnyway, the first engine that Al [Bartz] built for us was a 333-cubic-inch version2, and it got shipped over to Boston. All the adapter parts arrived from the Colnbrook factory and Tyler and I fitted this thing in a little shed adjacent to Tyler’s parents’ home in Hingham for the first-ever Can-Am race, to be run at Mont Tremblant in St. Jovite, Canada. “In ‘66 we got together with Bartz,” said Knutson. Al Bartz left Traco in 1966 and opened his own engine shop (George Bolthoff replaced him). He supplied McLaren with 2\n\nBeanland: “I wouldn’t mind betting that there was a series of three engines built, a s­ econd one for the other car that Chris Amon was driving, and one spare. We also went to a ZF transaxle to transmit the power.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n© Wade Fuller\n\nAnd it came about that some of our guys were testing at Silverstone prior to the 1966 Can-Am season—Chris Amon was doing the driving—and they were mulling around this extra weight; what difference does it make to a lap time? So anyway, at lunchtime, Chris and mechanic Bruce Harre (much later the Firestone tire engineer) not only went for lunch but also came back with a big sheet of plumber’s lead. They put a big wad of it over the transmission, and they bolted a lot of it behind the seat—a hundred pounds of weight, which would be the weight difference from the Olds engine to the Chevy. And it didn’t make a difference in lap times. They went back and reported this to Bruce. And Bruce said, “I can’t fault it” and he calls out to Teddy Mayer, “Weiner, order us a Chevrolet engine.” And the answer came back, “I did. Two days ago.”\n\nprecision-machined iron blocks Knutson used to build up a racing engine. They were initially equipped with four twinthroat Weber carburetors. Later, Hilborn constant-flow fuel injection was tried. It sprayed fuel even when the intake valve was closed. The system was better at wide-open throttle but was not great at part throttle, which was more needed on road courses. So, for the 1967 Can-Am season Knutson decided to develop a Lucas timed fuel injection system for the\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nChevrolet engine. It provided fuel on the intake stroke—and it was mechanically metered according to throttle position. British Formula 1 cars used this Lucas-developed system. “Lucas—the old aircraft division—was not happy with us,” said Knutson. “Their metering unit was OK for Formula 1, but not for us. Not putting it on a Chevy engine!” They told him, “No you can’t make that work. Forget it.” He wouldn’t give up that easily. “Luckily BMMR production manager Harry Pearce3 knew somebody at Lucas,” he said. “And one day they showed up with a Mark 1 metering unit, eight nozzles, rolls of fuel line and said, ‘Here. We don’t want to know about this.’” Knutson had a Mickey Thompson magnesium cross-ram manifold he could use. It was designed for Weber carburetors, so he modified it for fuel injection. With it, the McLaren M6 FIGURE 5.5 Knutson’s new Lucas-based fuel injection systems for 1967 with Traco\n\n© Courtesy of Revs Institute, Karl Ludvigsen Photograph Collection\n\nthrottle bodies on a converted Mickey Thompson cross-ram manifold. The extremely short intake trumpets were a far cry from the towering intake stacks coming in 1968.\n\n3\n\nPearce was a successful motorcycle racer, retiring in 1955. He passed away in 2017 at 94 years of age.\n\nCan-Am cars were more drivable, an advantage against the Weber-carbureted or Hilborn-equipped competition. “We had an area for assembly of small blocks in Norwich [at Smith’s Ford dealership], then at Long Beach between California races,” said Knutson. “Wherever we could have some floor space. We were nomads. Smith provided the tow truck, pick-ups and trailers in the early stages. I remember driving across the country too many times, a whole Chevy small block in the back of a ninepassenger van, driving nearly non-stop across the country.” From 1964 through 1969, before McLaren Engines, Inc., was formed, Smith Ford was McLaren’s headquarters on the East Coast from 1966, housing the Can-Am cars when they ran eastern U.S. tracks: Watkins Glen, Mosport, St. Jovite, Bridgehampton, Road America, and Mid-Ohio. Smith provided shop space on the east end of the dealership building, and everyone on the Can-Am team worked out of there. “It was a leftover shop from the Rev-Em Racing days,” explained Smith. “Lee Muir built engines at my dealership. We sent Magnaflux work out to the [former] Franklin air-cooledengines factory nearby.” The racing team would take over an entire motel for the summer—though they didn’t like the two-guys-to-a-room arrangement, according to Smith. “Most of the year, I provided logistics and parts procurement services—engines, metals and fasteners,” he said. “When they needed anything, they couldn’t get in England, they got me on the phone to chase parts for them.” In the early days, for example, Smith bought Olds F-85 V8 engines wherever he could find them. Smith also provided tow vehicles to the team. Cars were hauled on open trailers. Later, McLaren made a deal with Roger Penske Chevrolet in Philadelphia to supply three 1-ton trucks, to which Smith had fitted with ramp bodies to transport the cars. Knutson said, “The race team would go on and we would do the engines. We ended up at Bartz’s at the end of season and © 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nstarted to work on the big block Chevy—at first an iron block with aluminum heads.

Chevrolet Engineering sent blocks and heads and Knutson adapted intake manifolds, dry sumps, and associated hardware to run the engine in the McLaren M8A. Initial testing had been done at the Goodwood circuit in the U.K. in 1967 on an M6 that McLaren modified to fit a big-block engine as a stressed member. The car was in effect the M8 prototype. Californian Muir and Bruce’s friend Colin Beanland assisted Knutson. “Ted Mayer sent me a ticket,” said Beanland, “and said, ‘Get to California.’ Gary met me at the airport. We got into the big blocks. And Gary and Lee Muir were still doing development on the cast-iron version until aluminum ones arrived.”\n\nThe Chevrolet “Big Block”4\n\n4\n\nFor details about the “Big-Block” engine see “McLaren-Chevrolet Big Block Develop­ ment History” in the Appendix.

It was based on the 427 “Mystery” engine used in NASCAR beginning with the 1963 Daytona 500.4 Prior to adopting the Chevy, Bruce was considering using an aluminum version of Ford’s 427 in.3 NASCAR engine for 1968 in the new M8A Can-Am cars. The big Ford V8 was already being supplied to Shelby, recalled Wiley McCoy, who was building the engines at Holman and Moody at the time. Bruce was close to Ford via the Ford GT40 racing program, and he won Le Mans with fellow Kiwi Chris Amon in a GT40 MK II powered by a cast-iron 427 in 1966. McLaren had also built the Ford GTX (dubbed “Big Ed” in the shop), the topless aluminum-chassis Ford GT that won the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1966. It certainly wouldn’t have been a surprise if the team switched to Ford for the 1968 Can-Am season. When Chevrolet Product Promotions Engineering manager Vince Piggins heard the rumors about McLaren using the Ford engine, he called a meeting with Bruce at the GM Technical Center. Piggins offered McLaren aluminum big-block engines from Chevrolet Engineering based on the “Chaparral” dry-sump blocks developed by the Chevrolet R&D group. Bruce accepted. The development program started in 1968 with Knutson in California, working at a shop in Van Nuys, but using machinery\n\n29\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 5 McLaren’s Engine Program—Before Detroit\n\nTesting was done at Bartz’s shop. Initial work was done using Chevrolet-supplied blocks and aluminum heads that Knutson and Beanland dressed with McLaren intake manifolds and Lucas fuel injection. The aluminum blocks came off temporary\n\ntooling from Chevrolet R&D until production parts became available. 5 “They were very much like a workshop or tool room engine,” said Beanland. “You could see the blue engineer’s marking ink. Not every engine was quite the same. You made a bracket for one and it didn’t necessarily fit another one.” Following the 1968 season, Knutson left McLaren to rejoin the Chaparral team. He said, “I remember [I was] at Colnbrook, getting ready to go. I was coming down from the design offices and met Tyler coming up the stairs and he said ‘Traitor!’ to me. I went to Midland. It was late ‘68.”\n\nFIGURE 5.7 From left, Knutson, Mayer, and New Zealand motorsports legend George Begg, help Hulme drive the prototype.

GM’s Performance Parts group came to McLaren Engines, Inc., with a program to develop a new aluminum big-block ZL1 “crate engine,” called the “Ramjet ZL1,” to be sold to the performance aftermarket. The author arranged this business with GM and provided liaison services. Gary Knutson helped with the fuel injection system. As of this writing, the ZL1 engine block was still available from Chev­ rolet Performance Parts.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n©Doug Nye/GP Library\n\nBolthoff in the engine shop at Colnbrook, UK, in 1969. Note the clean-up work in the ZL-1 engine’s valley, including the two welded-shut freeze plugs with their now-redundant square-drive cavities. Steel or cast-iron cylinder liners visible here would disappear with the advent of the linerless Reynolds blocks in the 1970 season.\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n6\n\nThe First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop Beanland recalled, When Gary quit [at the end of the 1968 season] we needed an engineer. And we decided we were going to build engines in England. I suppose it was the cost. It was hard to get good money from sponsors and I think they were trying to trim down. McLaren had a shop in England. I guess the freighting of the engines was cheaper than having a yearround facility. George Bolthoff was at Traco Engineering when Knutson left McLaren. Bolthoff knew Bruce McLaren because of his work at Traco. So, he called Bruce about the engine-building job, and Bruce hired him on the condition that he would set up an engine shop at McLaren in the U.K. Bolthoff was a mechanical engineer but started his engine-building career as a young drag racer in California. He belonged to The Throttle Merchants, one of the many hot rod clubs in the car-crazy Los Angeles area whose members included soon-to-be famous drag racers Tony Nancy and the Hampshire brothers, “Jeep” and Ronnie.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n33\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER 6 The First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop\n\nFIGURE 6.1 George Bolthoff, foreground, is hidden by tire smoke as he blasts off the\n\n© Bolthoff Family collection\n\nline in his supercharged Chrysler AA/Gas slingshot dragster. He set numerous national records in gasoline-powered dragsters during and just after the National Hot Rod Association’s nitromethane ban, which was lifted in 1963.\n\nHampshire remembers Bolthoff as being a meticulous engine builder, whose powerful Chevrolet and Chrysler hemi engines were well respected in drag- and salt-flats racing circles. In 1964 and 1965 Bolthoff won championships and held national records in his own supercharged Chrysler “AA” dragster, running on gasoline. Bolthoff hung out at camshaft-maker Jack Engle’s shop and knew many of the southern California racers of the time. “Monday mornings we’d go down to Engle’s and talk about what happened on the weekend,” he said, “so we were a pretty close-knit group.”\n\nWhen Bolthoff decided to retire from racing and get a job in 1966, Engle tipped him off about a position at Traco Engineering. Bolthoff said, “Well, I’ll try that.” When he joined Traco in March of 1966, Al Bartz was the head engine builder. “My job was to take over for him—he was leaving to set up a shop out in Van Nuys,” Boltoff noted. “Gary Knutson was there [at Traco], working for McLaren to convert the Ford Indianapolis engine into a road racing engine.” When Bolthoff arrived in England in early 1969 (with his wife and two children), Beanland took them around to see various places to rent. “An American arriving in London gets an awful shock to find the living conditions,” Beanland said, “particularly when you come straight from California. It was a calamity, really. The old houses had coal-fired furnaces and you didn’t just turn the heat on. You had to start the fire and keep adding coal and it would be days before the house would heat up. Harry Pearce was stoking the fires in my house [with its 18-in.-thick stone walls] for a week before Karen and I returned after our wedding in the winter of 1969. She said, ‘Can we turn the heat on?’ I said, ‘The heat is on.’” Bolthoff set up the engine shop in a corner of the Colnbrook factory and began to work out his engine build program. He reflected: London was horrible. Most of the guys there had never seen a V8 before and all the engine equipment was built around four-cylinder engines. You’d have to really work things out—boring cylinders was really time consuming. I spent so much time flying, there wasn’t time to do engine development. By the time I get back to London, I have to put together another engine set and then fly it back to wherever the race was that week.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 6 The First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop\n\nBeanland handled the logistics of getting engines to the races in America and back across “the pond” for rebuilding. He said there were six or seven engines in the program during the 1969 season. “Two would be in vehicles, and a couple of spares,” he said. “And after a race they would ship the used engines back.” Meanwhile Bolthoff was in Colnbrook finishing two more engine rebuilds. He originally intended to just send them back to the team when finished, because there was no dynamometer. Time was of the essence. Bruce, however insisted that the engines be run first. Bolthoff built a portable test stand that could be wheeled out behind the plant, where the engines were run briefly before shipment.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nFIGURE 6.3 A set of engine parts to be made into a 427 or 430 in.3 engine for the 1969 M8-B Can-Am car.

There wasn’t any tracking available in those days, so I had a list of contacts I could call at various airports to check progress.” Beanland could call and find out if a shipment changed flights at an intermediate point—say Los Angeles—to see if it had made the next flight out. John Nicholson arrived in the U.K. from New Zealand at about the same time. “He was a good engineer,” said Beanland. “His dad ran Associated Engineering, a big engine rebuilding service in Auckland. He knew engines.” Nicholson raced a Lotus Elan, then a Lotus 27, which he maintained himself.\n\nCHAPTER 6 The First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop\n\nHe had written to McLaren about a job—friends told him to give it a try because Bruce liked to hire Kiwis—and received an invitation to come to England. There were no guarantees, though. He said, “When I arrived at McLaren I was told to go into the shop. As I entered, an arm shot out from the side and handed me a shop coat.” He had a job. Beanland explained the tradition: “The first question a Kiwi asked after arriving in England was, ‘Where is McLaren?’ Then they would go there and get hired.” According to Doug Nye’s McLaren history1 Nicholson said, “George was a really good guy to work with. When I asked him how, he told me how. I didn’t give any aggro. We worked long hours and I enjoyed every minute of it.” Nicholson also did some M8B and M8D track testing for BMMR, his driving experience having been noticed by the team.2 Nicholson and Bolthoff built all the engines for the 1969 Can-Am season, with logistical help from Beanland. “We had a designated guy at GM to get us parts—gasket sets, etc. Bill Howell was involved with that. They shipped stuff express air. Everything was ‘no charge.’” McLaren M8Bs won all eleven races that year, even finished 1-2 in eight of them—and they were 1-2-3 at the race in Michigan when Dan Gurney drove the spare car, starting last. He carved up the field until he was third—and stayed there, in deference to his McLaren hosts. “He was under strict instructions not to beat either Bruce or Denny; Dan, being very quick, was quite capable of doing this,” said Alexander.3 Out of 23 starts, the McLaren: The Grand Prix, Can-Am and Indy Cars, By Doug Nye, Hazelton Publishing, Surrey, England, 1984, p. 39. 2 Nicholson said in an email to the author, “Many years later, Jan McLaren called and asked me to confirm my Mothers name. A family in NZ were doing a family tree and this request to Jan came from them. A few weeks later I received email from Jan saying, ‘Hello Cousin(!!!).’ Bruce and I never knew this at the time I went to work at McLaren. Cousin? I’m not sure, but definitely related.” 3 Tyler Alexander, p. 90. 1\n\nFIGURE 6.4 Bruce in his familiar #4 car and Denny attacking Turn 5 at Road America.\n\nThis is the view that the rest of the field saw all season as the McLaren team won all eleven Can-Am races and took the championship for the third straight year.

The third incident was a failed oil pump drive on Bruce’s car at the Mid-Ohio event, but the engine ran for nearly five laps at the end of the race with no oil pressure. Bruce finished second behind Hulme. Bill Howell was the Chevrolet engineer in charge of developing the Mark II4 and Mark IV big-block V8s for racing. He was also liaison engineer with McLaren, and he spent many hours at McLaren Engines where Chevrolet went for racing engine\n\n4\n\nThe NASCAR “Mystery Engine” that dominated the 1963 Daytona 500. It was developed from the 348/409/427 “W” engine, which was known internally as the “Mark I.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 6 The First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop\n\ndevelopment during and after the Can-Am series.5 Howell knew Bolthoff from Traco Engineering. “Bolthoff built the Trans-Am small blocks for Penske that we won the championship with in ’68,” said Howell. “He was an excellent builder. Travers hated to lose him. He said Bolthoff ‘was the fastest good builder’ he knew. “Fast, but never made a mistake,” he noted. Bolthoff was meticulous and single minded when building an engine. “I have an ability to focus on what I am doing—and focus on time,” he explained. “I was an engineer and I was interested in the engineering part of it, but when it came to building engines I was a fanatic, in that I had to put the thing together [myself].” Bolthoff built a 430 in.3 version of the big-block Chevrolet V8 for the 1969 season. The 430 had an enlarged (4.44-in.) bore and reduced stroke (3.475 in.) compared with the original 427’s 4.25 × 3.76-in. dimensions. Chevrolet developed the concept, according to Howell. “We knew that reducing the stroke would reduce friction and give more horsepower,” he said. This was proved out on GM’s electric dynos that could turn (“motor”) the engine and measure friction at various engine speeds. “We developed the engine using the MacKay intake manifold, but with constant flow fuel injection.” The Lucas timed fuel injection system wasn’t needed for engine development in a test cell. 5\n\nWhen the emissions standards came in, GM needed more dynamometer testing and development capacity and claimed the test cells Chevrolet engineering was using for racing projects. “They put us out,” said Howell, “so we went to McLaren.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n37\n\n“This engine was used for most of the races in 1969,” said Bolthoff. “The drivers liked it because it was very smooth and would rev easily.” The engine produced over 600 hp at 7,200 rpm and could be consistently turned to 7,500 rpm. Bolthoff also began developing a 465 in.3 version of the engine, which used the 4.44-in. bore with the 3.76-in. stroke using the 427 crankshaft. He reported that Hulme had no interest in that engine, and he had to cajole him into using it. “Denny had a very big liking for the 430,” said Beanland, “the way it spun up. It didn’t have as much power, but it was easy to drive. He would say, ‘Give me a 430 and I’ll win’—and he got what he wanted a couple of times.” Howell was impressed that McLaren won all the races in 1969. “I don’t know that they ever really had any failures,” he said. “I can’t recall any. I know they were working it hard enough that some stuff on a rebuild wouldn’t pass Magnaflux, so they’d have to put new parts in. Crankshafts and eventually a cylinder block would be replaced. They were quite reliable.” In 1970, Bruce McLaren was awarded the Segrave Trophy6 by Britain’s Royal Automobile Club. It was “Awarded posthumously for the design, development and driving of cars that won every round of the 1969 Can-Am Championship.”\n\n6\n\nThe Segrave Trophy is awarded to those with the “Spirit of Adventure” for the most out­ standing demonstration of transportation by land, air, or water. Sir Henry Segrave was the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. He was also the first person to travel at over 200 mph in a land vehicle. The Segrave Trophy was established in 1930 to commemorate Sir Henry’s life.\n\n38\n\nCHAPTER 6 The First “In-House” McLaren Engine Shop\n\n© Courtesy of Revs Institute, Karl Ludvigsen Photograph Collection\n\nFIGURE 6.5 Bruce’s naked M8-B with unidentified crew member.

They included team driver Dennis Hulme; team manager Teddy Mayer; chief engineer Tyler Alexander; chief design engineer Gordon Coppuck; engineering director George Bolthoff, and chief mechanic Cary Taylor. The award was presented to Bruce’s widow, Pat, in a ceremony at the 1970 British Grand Prix.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nSECTION II. FOUNDING McLAREN ENGINES, Inc.\n\nFrom left, Bruce L.McLaren, H. William Smith, and Edward E. Mayer founded McLaren Engines, Inc. Their signatures as directors are on the first corporate organization document along with the other directors, Colin Beanland and George Bolthoff.\n\nC H A P T E R\n\n7\n\nMoving to Detroit Bolthoff wasn’t happy with the arrangement as it played out in 1969—building engines in England and going to races in America was not logistically ideal and it would be better to move the operation closer to the action. He observed: I approached Bruce with the idea. “Why don’t we go to where the races are, and where our suppliers are?” Chevrolet was the supplier and we were getting tired of flying around back and forth to the races. The schedule was every two weeks. We spent a lot of time on airplanes. And I just pointed that out; spending a lot of time and money spinning our wheels, when we really need to be doing engine development, and Bruce bought into that. So, he just says, “OK.” I think Bruce assumed that I was talking about going back to California, and he says, “Where do you want to go?” And I said, “Detroit.” that caught him by surprise. I’m a native California boy, lived there most of my life. But I saw Detroit as the place to be—for getting stuff done and having access to General Motors and being able to go on short trips to races. That was all beneficial to everybody.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n41\n\n42\n\nCHAPTER 7 Moving to Detroit\n\nThe move to Livonia, Michigan, would make the Can-Am program much easier because the McLaren engine development facility was now less than an hour from Chevrolet Engineering in Warren, instead of a full day via transatlantic aircraft. It was not just Can-Am logistics on Bolthoff’s mind. Bruce McLaren had decided to build a car for the Indianapolis 500. It was an idea that Mayer and Smith had been kicking around. Smith even arranged a trip to the Indy 500 to show Mayer what it was all about. Also, Goodyear, McLaren’s tire sponsor, wanted to challenge Firestone at the Speedway. It was the biggest race in the world in terms of awareness among the tire-buying public, so the strategy could yield the desired benefit to Goodyear. To that end, Goodyear had sponsored Carroll Shelby’s ill-fated Indy turbine car effort at Indy in 1968 and put Bruce McLaren and Denny Hulme in the cars. Hulme had prior experience at the 500, having been named Rookie of the Year in 1967 after starting 24th and finishing 4th in the race. However, the cars, designed and built by Ken Wallis, were seriously slowed by USAC’s turbine inlet rules. There were also questions about the legality of the turbine air inlet system. Eventually, Shelby withdrew the cars. McLaren would build a car for Indy and it would use Goodyear tires. Goodyear would provide the assistance of an Indy engine-building legend—Herb “Herbie Horsepower” Porter, the “father” of the turbocharged Offy engine.\n\nMcLaren’s Headquarters in America Bill Smith was involved with the new company at its inception. “Teddy came to me and asked for help,” said Smith. “Bolthoff had said they needed to come to Detroit. The company included me, Bruce, Teddy, Bolthoff and ‘Beanie’ [Colin Beanland]. I put the majority of the money into the company. It was registered in Delaware on November 26, 1969 with the name McLaren Engines, Inc.”\n\nThe board of directors included Bruce McLaren, Mayer (also listed as president), Beanland, Bolthoff, and Smith (listed as vice president, even though he owned a controlling interest in the company). Smith would lead the company for the next 30 years, relinquishing ownership in 1999. Beanland said, “Karen and I left England at the end of November ’69, and we got off in Boston and brought one of the race car trucks and trailers over to Detroit. George Bolthoff had flown right in to Detroit. We picked up the truck from Tyler Alexander’s parents,” he said. “His dad looked after the vehicles over the winter for us.” Beanland and Bolthoff arrived in Livonia to move into a newly rented 4,500 square-foot unit—one of ten such units—in a brandnew, but nondescript, industrial building at 32233 West Eight Mile Road. “When we walked in, it was bare walls,” explained Beanland. “And the enormity of the thing about made us sick. We had left England where there was a machine shop, there’s an air system, there’s a lathe. Anything you wanted was there. And this place is bare walls, very little electrical and no air conditioning.” Beanland bought a used water-cooled air conditioner and had it installed on the roof. In 1970, “It was just the two of us,” said Beanland. His wife, Karen, served as secretary at Bruce’s request, and she became the de facto office manager during the time her husband was there. Beanland almost immediately added Lee Muir, the VW mechanic from southern California, to the staff. He had been volunteering to help the McLaren team at west coast races for years. Muir even did some work for the team out of Smith’s Ford dealership in New York. Beanland and Bolthoff collaborated to build space for the teams by placing a half-height wall down the middle of the shop space. For the existing Can-Am team and the new Indy car team, their crews and race cars were on the south side with access from © 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 7 Moving to Detroit\n\n1\n\nThe test cell is still there today, next to that same stairway.

George was able to project where the muffler went through the roof. We found the center of it and dropped a plumb bob. I don’t know how I got up on the roof, but I got up there with a piece of welding rod and a saber saw we rented. And I cut a circle in the roof. George caught the hole as it fell through. I recall that I did most of the flashing on the mufflers in 26-gauge material.” Forty-seven years later, Wiley McCoy commented to Beanland that he did a good job on the flashing because it never leaked there. “The roof leaked everywhere else,” said McCoy, “but not around the mufflers.” FIGURE 7.1 A 1970 Can-Am engine on the new McLaren Engines Heenan & Froude\n\nwater-brake dynamometer installed by Bolthoff and Beanland in 1969–1970.

The race teams, led by Alexander, were part of BMMR, while the engine builders and support staff were with McLaren Engines, Inc. Bruce arranged for a 1,000-hp Heenan and Froude G490 water brake engine dynamometer to be shipped over from England. It was installed inside a new acoustic concrete block test cell on the east wall, next to a stairway in the northeast corner of the room leading to a mezzanine above.1 “The dyno required getting some plumbers to tap into the water mains on the east side of the building,” said Beanland. “They were eight feet out. We tapped in with a two-inch pipe instead of an inch. George had figured that instead of putting a cooling unit up on the roof, water was so cheap that would be the way to go.” The cooling system would take city water, run it through the dyno, and then dump the water, which was not contaminated in the process, into the sewer system. “But getting tradespeople to understand the urgency was another thing. With time ticking away, we have Offy engines coming and now in March and April they’re starting to show up.” Beanland grew tired of the plumber’s broken promises, so one day he went to their shop and sat there. “They got sick of me waiting and said, ‘OK, c’mon,’ and we went back to our shop to do the work, but Lee Muir couldn’t stand it,” said Beanland. “The layout of the pipes inside the building was so haphazard. When he had a moment, he redid the pipes, so everything lined up.” We got the plumbing in, and the electrical was going in. And George and I built pretty well every piece of bench, grinding room, everything that was in the workshop. We were there seven days a week, and it never slowed down. George got a couple of mufflers made for the dyno room.

The window is still there, but the controls were later moved to the front of the cell around the corner to his left.\n\nThe dynamometer cell was known as “Cell 1” for years. It was the center of the McLaren Engines universe. Great things from McLaren Engines would go through Cell 1—the all-conquering Can-Am big blocks, the Indy-winning Offy and Cosworth engines, and others to come. It’s currently known as “Cell 4,” because that fits the layout of the dyno room, after three more dyno cells were built, but as of 2020 it hasn’t moved. The numbering system moved. The cell used the original control console for decades. It was built by Neil Clark, a GM engineer who helped Gary Knutson computerize McLaren Engines dynamometer controls and data acquisition systems.\n\n© Pete Lyons\n\n44\n\n“The whole [McLaren Engines enterprise] was operated on a reimbursement of expenses,” said Beanland. “Phil Kerr— BMMR’s general manager, who was Bruce and Colin’s buddy when they were teenagers in New Zealand—designed up a form and it had various categories, like parts purchased, shop materials, salaries. At the end of the month we’d tally up all these things, Karen would type it all up and I’d put it in the mail to Phil.” In 1970, McLaren Engines got really busy preparing for the Indianapolis 500. “We had to come up with Offy engines six weeks at least before they started sending vehicles over,” said Beanland. “George had to get into doing the Offy almost right away.”\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n© Daryl Harsha\n\nFIGURE 7.4 Offenhauser engines await processing in June 1970, just after the Indianapolis 500.\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 7 Moving to Detroit\n\n45\n\nGeorge Bolthoff checks sparkplugs during a practice session at Indiapolis 1970.

The Can-Am cars would not arrive until after their first race, which was at Mosport, two weeks later. Gordon Coppuck designed the M15 from Bruce McLaren’s concept, which was a simple solution. It was based on the M8 Can-Am car, but with a narrower central-seat tub. The suspension used M8 uprights and other bits from the M8, including the wheels. “The M15 Indy car was basically a single seat Can-Am car,” said Steve Roby, an Australian who was chief mechanic on the McLaren Indy team from 1976 to 1979. The turbocharged DOHC four-cylinder Offenhauser engine, built at Livonia, was mounted behind the driver in a manner similar to that used for the big Chevrolet V8 in the Can-Am car. The front of the engine was fastened to a wide plate, which in turn was attached to the rear bulkhead of the riveted aluminum chassis (called the “tub”). A pair of triangulated tubular reinforcements ran from that bulkhead to the\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\n47\n\nCHAPTER 8 1970: Indy and Can-Am\n\nbell housing at the rear of the engine to support the engine and transmit suspension loads to the tub. The BMMR team built three Indy cars in England. M15-1 was to be a test car. The others, M15-2 and M15-3, were for Denny Hulme and Chris Amon. “The test car was first run on November 3, 1969, at Goodwood in England,” according to Roby. “Bruce and Denny had to learn how to handle the Offy engine’s slow throttle response; it could instantly turn into a massive power surge when the turbocharger spooled up. Imagine a sudden several-hundred horsepower jump in the middle of a corner.” Roby continues: Tom Anderson, a McLaren mechanic on the Indy car team, recalls that the first U.S. test was in Indianapolis in 1969 during a bitterly cold November with both Denny and Bruce. The Goodyear test engine1 died before the end of the fourth day of the test and that failure, coupled with the cold weather, led to the test being terminated. Denny ran a lap at over 168 mph, which would have put him on the front row in 1969, and Bruce worked the test car up to 162 mph. Early in 1970 the three race cars were flown to Detroit and taken to McLaren Engines briefly before moving on to Indy. Chris Amon was slated to be Denny Hulme’s teammate, but he was not comfortable on the speedway and struggled to get up to speed. Amon finally told Bruce that he should 1\n\nBuilt by Herb Porter.\n\nfind another driver. With Goodyear’s assistance, they put Bobby Unser in the car. He immediately went eight-mph faster! Chris headed back to Europe, where he would join the new March Engineering Formula 1 team for the upcoming season.\n\nFIGURE 8.1 Hulme testing the new McLaren M15 at the Indianapolis Speedway in\n\nNovember 1969.

Earlier, USAC had required the team to modify the cap with springs to keep the closing lever secure. The organization thought that the team was responsible for the fire because they left the cap open. But, one day after the fire the team was warming the engine and mechanic Allan McCall saw the cap start to open on its own. The lever was oscillating due to engine harmonics. A quick redesign was done, approved by USAC, and the problem solved-unfortunately too late for Denny.\n\nengine-related problems. The Ontario track was quite a bit faster than Indy, Lloyd Ruby qualifying at 177.567 mph compared to Joe Leonard’s three-year-old Indy speed record of 171.551. The higher speeds may have been hard on the cars.\n\nFIGURE 8.4 From left, Hulme in the car, Tyler Alexander conferring with Teddy Mayer, and Tom Anderson walking around the back of the car.

Photographer unknown\n\nWith Hulme out due to his burns, McLaren ran Peter Revson in car #73 and Carl Williams, with sponsorship support from his friends in Kansas City, in #75. Revson qualified 16th, running quite well but dropped out on lap 87 with magneto issues. Williams qualified 19th and finished 9th, three laps down. The team raced again at the inaugural California 500 at the Ontario Motor Speedway on September 6, 1970. According to Roby, Eamon “Chalkie” Fullalove came over from the Can-Am team to help as pit crew on Revson’s Team McLaren M15-001 (#75) in which he started 10th and was running in second place before losing over eight minutes on the last pit stop, dropping to 9th place. He recovered to finish fifth. Gordon Johncock qualified 11th and finished 4th in one of the two M15s he purchased from McLaren after the Indy 500. Both Revson and Johncock completed the full 200 laps, which was quite a feat, considering that only 8 cars out of 33 were running at the finish with 18 of the dropouts having\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nThe 1970 Can-Am Season FIGURE 8.5 Dan Gurney, in the car at Mosport Park, was retained to take Bruce\n\n© Pete Lyons\n\nMcLaren’s place in the new McLaren M8D. Here he checks the view while Alexander adjusts the mirror. George Bolthoff rests his hand on the rear wing support and John Nicholson stands behind Alexander. Can-Am commissioner Stirling Moss is in the group behind the car, talking to the man in the Gulf jacket.\n\nAs previously mentioned, following Bruce’s death on June 2, the team had less than two weeks to build a new M8D in time for the first race of the season. They determined that the car’s design\n\n© 2020 SAE International\n\nCHAPTER 8 1970: Indy and Can-Am\n\n51\n\nwas good, but nevertheless the longitudinal fins that held the wing were strengthened and modified to raise the wing a bit. Dan Gurney was hired to take Bruce’s place on the Can-Am team. McLaren had close ties with Gurney. The two were on the Ford GT40 team, and Gurney gave Bruce a drive in his Eagle F1 when Bruce’s new McLaren F1 car was not available for lack of a good engine. McLaren reciprocated in 1969 when Gurney drove the spare M8B in the Can-Am race at Michigan International Speedway, where he finished third under “team orders.” At Mosport, Gurney spent a lot of time familiarizing himself with the car, tinkering with roll bars and springs. Finally, with only minutes left for qualifying, he went out and took the pole. Then he won the race. He won the next race, too—at St. Jovite. Gurney remained on the team for one more race, Watkins Glen, which Hulme won, but then his sponsor Castrol objected that Gurney was driving a Gulf-backed McLaren. So, he reluctantly stepped out of the seat and was replaced by Peter Gethin. After Gurney left, Hulme won four of the next six races to take the 1970 Can-Am championship. Gethin took the other two, but McLaren’s Can-Am win streak that started in 1968 ended at 19 when both cars failed to finish at Road Atlanta. Hulme retired early in the race after tangling with another car and Gethin retired near the end of the race with mechanical issues while safely in the lead. Tony Dean’s 3-liter, 350-hp Porsche 908 surprised everybody with the win.\n\nCHAPTER 8 1970: Indy and Can-Am\n\nReynolds Block FIGURE 8.6 A recent photo of an original McLaren linerless Reynolds 390 aluminum\n\n© Roger Meiners\n\ncylinder block.\n\nIn the late 1960s McLaren Engines’ sponsor Reynolds Aluminum was working with the General Motors Engineering Staff on a new rear-drive small-car concept code-named XP887, which became the Chevrolet Vega. It featured a new 140 in.3 overheadcam four-cylinder engine featuring a revolutionary aluminum cylinder block that did not use liners. The block was cast from Reynolds A390 aluminum, a hypereutectic alloy saturated with silicon that was precipitated out in crystalline form. The cylinders were processed in a way that exposed the silicon particles so that the pistons and rings would ride on the particles, not on the aluminum cylinder walls. This eliminated the need for iron or steel cylinder liners2 while reducing weight. An additional 2\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Vega went on sale as a 1971 model in September 1970 for a base price of $2,090. Chevrolet sold nearly two million of them until the brand was discontinued after the 1977 model year. The Reynolds 390 concept worked well, but the overall design of the engine caused problems unrelated to the alloy.\n\nadvantage to eliminating liners was that there was now room for larger bores—as wide as 4.5 in. in the case of the aluminum bigblock Chevrolet engine. The Can-Am series was already seeing such large bores in linered blocks, but the Reynolds 390 alloy made possible “lower friction, excellent sealing, improved dimensional stability, improved heat dissipation, reduced weight, and higher durability compared to the traditional aluminum block with cast-iron cylinder liners.”3 Reynolds Aluminum’s strategy was to show the durability of this new process by using it in McLaren’s 700-hp racing engines. Reynolds hoped this would not only help Vega sales but also spur sales of its A390 aluminum to GM and other auto manufacturers. According to Colin Beanland, the engine development began in 1970 after “six blocks arrived in Livonia one day.” Bolthoff built up 465 in.3 engines for testing and the team began development.
