        "text": "Cooper-Climax Formula 1\n\nThe first cars built by Cooper for âGrand Prixâ races in 1952 and 1953 had a front engine of 2,000 cm3 in cylinder capacity and did not stand out for their performance. They were just another car in the squad and were accessible to midline drivers who tried their luck and tried to earn a spot in the F1.\n\nLater, in 1957, Cooper designed new cars to compete in Formula 2. These new single-seaters stood out for having the engine in a central position, that is, behind the pilot and ahead of the rear axle.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1960, the Cooper Formula 2 cars won 33 races out of 51 races. Most of those winning Cooper cars were equipped with Coventry Climax FPF engines, thanks to the agreement between Cooper and the company Coventry Climax.\n\nThe association was so successful that they ventured into Formula 1 causing a stir. Cooper introduced for the first time in the official history of F1 a central engine car. Their success was so overwhelming that back then, even in the United States, they saw with astonishment those little Cooper cars. Influence spread to the whole world of car competitions.\n\nCooper-Climax's first Formula 1 victory came at the 1958 Argentina Grand Prix thanks to the great talent of Stirling Moss. That same year Maurice Trintignant won the Monaco Grand Prix, becoming the first French driver to win an F1 race.\n\nThe little F1 Cooper had excellent potential. Even having between 30 and 40 horsepower less than the Ferrari, he beat them smoothly thanks to superior agility and maneuverability. The Cooper was a simple construction car, equipped with a chassis of four longitudinal main tubes and a low overall weight.\n\nIn 1959 the driver Jack Brabham drove a Cooper with which he became World Champion, winning the Monaco and Great Britain Grand Prix. Drivers Stirling Moss and Bruce McLaren also won wins with Cooper cars. Moss won in Italy and McLaren in the United States and Argentina (1960).\n\nBy 1960 Cooper redesigned the chassis of his cars. Improvements to the Cooper T53 ensured the second consecutive Constructors Championship for the manufacturer. So also came the second consecutive championship for driver Jack Brabham, who won 5 Grand Prix in a row that year.\n\nFinally, changes in the Formula 1 regulation regarding engine sizes complicated Cooper's situation. By the time Cooper was able to obtain an engine according to the changes and with the necessary performance, the other teams already had new chassis and engines to outperform the Cooper.\n\nIt remains to be noted that in 1961 a Cooper car was presented in the 500 miles of Indianapolis with Jack Brabham as a driver. Despite having trouble at a pit stop, the Cooper came in ninth position.\n\nMore information\n\nRacing Cars"
