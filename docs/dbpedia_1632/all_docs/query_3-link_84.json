        "text": "Type 119 Lotus soapbox (July 2002)\n\nThe worlds fastest go-kart, capable of reaching 60mph in 4.3 seconds, and has a top speed of 207mph. The Lotus Type 119 weighs just 77lb, has a carbon fibre monocoque and utilises bonded aluminium in its construction. The engineless kart is designed to race on downhill courses where gravity will power it.\n\nIt competed for the first time at The Goodwood Festival Of Speed in the '2002 Goodwood Gravity Racing Soapbox Challenge' - where it was expected to reach a speed of around 60mph. More info here (Picture © MarkS)\n\nM120 - Elise Coupe (1998) & M121 - Europa S (2005)\n\nProject M120 was suspended in 1998. To answer the obvious question - the addition of a roof meant that the whole car was stiffer, which meant that lower sills could be used to accommodate larger doors - making entry and exit easier.\n\nMore powerful engines were also considered - including the Rover 2.5 KV6 and even (reportedly) the 1.6 V8 twin turbo used in the Suzuki concept car (250bhp). The Elise Coupe (codenamed Sepang) eventually emerged in Dec 2005 as the Lotus Europa, click here for more details.\n\nLotus ECO2S, 2002\n\nThe 2002 Geneva motor saw the launch of Lotus Engineering's project: 'ECO2s' (pronounced ECOS). The project uses a number of new techniques to reduce emissions and body weight with the ultimate goal of an environmentally friendly sports car.\n\nMore info here\n\nFederalised Elise, January 2003 (Elise 111R)\n\nIn January 2003 the first official announcement about a US bound Elise was made, to be based on the European Elise but with additional safety equipment to satisfy US legalities. At the same time as this announcement, it was also declared that the the Lotus Esprit would reach the end of its long and illustrious life in early 2004 in the USA and mid 2003 in Europe - with an all new replacement to be announced at a future date.\n\nIn September 2003 Lotus announced that the Toyota 2ZZ-GE 1.8 litre 4 cylinder 16-valve engine with Variable Valve Timing and Lift-Intelligent (VVTL-i) system had been chosen, to be mated to a six-speed gearbox and tuned by Lotus specifically for the U.S. and to produce around 190hp. The Federalised Elise was officially launched at the 2004 Los Angeles Auto Show where the weight was confirmed at 891kg, 0-60mph claimed at 4.8 seconds and top speed at 150mph. The additional weight is down to twin airbags, brake servo and TRW anti-lock brakes, climate control, air-conditioning, carpets and additional sound proofing and a larger fuel tank. It also has a starter button.\n\nIt was planned to get some in-life experience of the engine and to reduce potential launch issues and associated legal problems in the US by offering the same engine in the new Exige S2, due to be launched at the Geneva motorshow in 2004. The Toyota Elise was also made available in the UK under the name 111R in January 2004\n\nMotorsport Exige, Jan 2005\n\nA direct motorsport derivative of the successful Lotus Exige. This Lotus designed and engineered racecar was part manufactured by RTN, the team responsible for the Le Mans winning Bentley, using the latest motorsport techniques and procedures to produce a lightweight yet strong carbonfibre bodywork structure.\n\nMore details here\n\nLotus Sport Exige 240R, 25th Feb 2005\n\nLotus Sport, the performance division of Lotus Cars Ltd., developed the Lotus Sport Exige 240R, a limited edition of 50 cars. With a supercharged and intercooled engine producing over 240 hp and over 170 lbft of torque, 0- 60mph in less than 4s and 100mph (160 km/h) in less than 10s before topping out at 155 mph (249 km/h). At this top speed the aerodynamics produce 113 kg of downforce increasing grip, stability and safety. More details here and here\n\nLotus Circuit Car, June 2005\n\nTony Shute, Head of Product Development at Lotus Cars: \"The new product has allowed Lotus to once again apply its key \"performance through lightweight\" philosophy. This is in order to achieve an innovative product for the track day and club racing Lotus enthusiast whilst staying true to the key design attributes of the Elise and Exige products.\" Project delayed whilst Lotus focused on the Europa. More here.\n\nLotus Sport Exige GT3, Dec 2005\n\nA prototype of the Lotus Sport Exige race car was unveiled at the annual FIA GT Championship presentation ceremony outside the world famous Casino in Monte Carlo, Monaco on 02 December, 2005. This car was designed for the FIA series to start in 2006 for race cars that have an equal power to weight, and that have a direct lineage to their road going versions. In its maiden year (2006), Lotus Cadena ran in the Avon Tyres British GT Championship. More here\n\nAPX, VVA technology, Feb 2006\n\nDisplayed at Geneva, the Aluminium Performance Crossover (APX) concept - a showcase of Lotus Engineerings aluminium Versatile Vehicle Architecture (VVA). The design concept is expected to be used for the new Esprit replacement, but Lotus is also hoping to sell the concept to third parties. More details here\n\nExige 265E, Aug 2006\n\nLotus Cars has introduced the Exige 265E, which it describes as the most powerful road version of the car ever. The E suffix indicates that the Exige has been adapted to run on bio-ethanol. Lotus fitted a slightly modified version of the 2ZZ VVTL-i supercharged four-cylinder that powers the production Exige S. Running on E85, the car delivers 265 horsepower and sprints from zero to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds, with a top speed of 158 mph.\n\nLotus said it added two fuel injectors at the supercharger inlet to increase the amount of fuel being injected into the engine under higher loads and to cool the charge air before combustion. It also enlarged the four existing fuel injectors on the intake manifold and recalibrated the engine electronics. Lotus Engineering powertrain chief Geraint Castleton-White explained: \"We wanted to prove that green sports cars can also be very high-performing sports cars.\" Lotus said it has no immediate plans to put the Exige 265E into production. See here for full details\n\nGT3 Exige, 2007\n\nLotus Sport, the race car performance arm of Lotus Cars Ltd, unveiled the Lotus Exige GT3 concept road vehicle at the 77th annual Geneva International Motor Show. More details here\n\nTesla, 2006\n\nSilicon Valley startup firm Tesla Motors developed a pure-electric, high-performance two-seater called simply the Roadster. The carbon-fiber-bodied Tesla Roadster was originally designed by and jointly developed with Lotus.\n\nMore info here and at http://www.teslamotors.com/\n\nEVE HYBRID, March 2007\n\nThe EVE programme was undertaken by a cross-functional team of Lotus and Proton engineers working together at Hethel and Shah Alam, Kuala Lumpur. The resulting EVE Hybrid demonstrator, based on a Proton Gen.2 compact midsize car with a 1.6litre gasoline engine, but with tailpipe emissions down by 22% and fuel economy improved by 28%. See here for more details\n\nEvora, July 2008 (Type 124)\n\nOne of the stars of the London Motorshow was the launch of the Lotus Evora. This is the long awaited 'Project Eagle' 2+2 sports car. Later, in Geneva Switzerland, Lotus officially confirmed Evora (named after a town in Portugal) production specifications ahead of the May 2009 launch in Europe. See here for details\n\nAnnounced to the 2009 Frankfurt Motorshow, the Evora Type 124 to be homologated for either FIA or GT3-spec racing, but until the technical regulations for those series are finalised - and until Lotus knows exactly how quick the Evora Type 124 is - the two factory-supported cars will run broadly to VLN Nurburgring endurance championship regs.\n\nRUMOURS - past & present - see here ;)\n\nExos, 2010\n\nThe Exos Experience, initiated and operated by Lotus Motorsport, is an elite club. A club in which the limited number of Lotus 125 owner drivers can refine their driving skills and challenge themselves in Formula 1™ inspired technology combined with expert one-to-one advice from former Grand Prix drivers and trainers. Full press release here, full report from the Golden Gate Lotus Club here\n\nElite, 2014 (announced 2010)\n\nSet for release in spring 2014, this 2+2 GT will set a new benchmark in design, performance and emissions. A front-mid positioned 5.0l V8 engine delivering up to 620 PS meaning drivers can expect to go from 0-100 km/h in approximately 3.5 to 3.7 seconds. Petrol, hybrid optional with hybrid gearbox & integrated electric motors and KERS. Full press release here\n\nHave the wing mirrors fallen off already? ;)\n\nMotorsport Plans\n\nOctober 2010.
