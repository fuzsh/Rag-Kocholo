The Indianapolis venture had been profitable which would have appealed to Charlie Cooper.\nI can think of a few possible reasons. Jack Brabhams departure had placed significant pressures on the team.  The 1.5 litre Formula 1 needed considerable effort to...",

        "text": "Everything Emery did was a shoestring job, so he was pretty good at spending money carefully.\n\nAccording to Bill Morris, Andrew Getley bought the engines and let Paul have one - no idea if he had to pay for it, I suspect he didn't and the idea was to get it running, prove that it worked (312 Bhp on Chrysler's dyno in Kew) and then sell the others.\n\nApparently one of the oil companies was going to back the project with 1,000s of pounds of money but that fell through so the Shannon F1 project died and the car went on to F3 and the engines ended up with Doc Murfield.\n\nThe low budget followed the Shannon, John Wilson who raced the Shannon as an F3 car said that it was a good car (he did win a race in it) but the preparation was awful - such as when the engine seized because of a rag left in an oil line...\n\nYou're posting a comment my post contained initially.\n\nBut before hitting the post button I all of a sudden remembered two things.\n\nFirst: the Offy was also way more powerful than the 2.7 liter Climax that the Cooper did and I doubt that the used gearbox for the Cooper could have coped with the power and torque of the Offy. Remeber that Lotus used an adapted Colotti gearbox two years later for their app. 350 hp Ford V8. That gearbox was not available yet in '62, let alone '61.\n\nThere was a gearbox exisiting for the front engined roadsters that could cope with the Offy power and torque, also a rear end spool. But a single unit of gearbox and final drive as required for a rear engined car, strong enough to deal with the power figures as used at Indy at that time, it didn't exist yet.\n\nThe other thing was that the Offy ran on methanol and consumed quite large amounts of that fuel, most Roadsters had to stop at least twice if not three times for fuel and tires, tires due to the weight of the cars empty + loaded with the fuel quantities they needed for the stint. We're talking about up between 45-55 gallons for a stint.\n\nI honestly have no idea how a car like the Cooper could store some way over 150 liters of fuel anywhere within the frame without ballooning out into something like a forerunner of the Mickey Thompson Rollerskates of 1963 but at larger wheels than the tiny 12 Inch wheels these cars used.\n\nHi Rob,\n\nThanks for the added information. I really appreciate it.\n\nThe sole Cooper Indianapolis car ever built was finished April 28th, 1961 and was briefly tested the day after at Goodwood. It was then flown to Indy by Flying Tigers DC6B cargo plane and arrived in Chicago May 4th, 1961. It was trucked on an open trailer to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and arrived on May 5th, before Jack Brabham even made it there. After the race, its engine and the spare were used in the Cooper Monacos of Bruce McLaren and Jack Brabham for their terrific battle at the LA Times GP at Riverside. The car, as can be confirmed by the Speedway Museum, remained there until late 1962 when Kjell Kvale bought the chassis from Jim Kimberly and had Joe Huffaker install the Aston Martin engine that eventually ended in Project 215 in it. After it failed to qualify due to the exagerated power claim of this engine, the car was sold to a local racer in San Jose, California. Since May 1961, it NEVER left the United States until June 1994 when Lord March invited it to Goodwood for the Festival of Speed. This is very well documented today.\n\nAlso, regarding the color, here is an original panel as found (the car was NEVER repainted before we did so in 1991) and a shot of Jack before qualifying:\n\nAlso there are two color pics of the car in the beautiful Doug Nye/Jack Brabham book, \"The Jack Brabham Story\" on pages 132 and 133. One especially is very telling because it is very well preserved.\n\nBest regards,\n\nT54\n\nPS: I am curious to find out which Cooper you actually filmed. Is it possible that they hastily made a mock-up from a F1 chassis to celebrate their success? Why would John Cooper not have told me during the nearly all-day reminiscence of the event I had with him in 1994?\n\nAfter all, the Indy Motor Speedway has done the same thing for many years... and sure enough, their mock-up car is... green.\n\n(my highlighting)"
