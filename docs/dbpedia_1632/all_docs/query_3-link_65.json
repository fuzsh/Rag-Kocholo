        "text": "Image: Silverstone Auctions\n\nIn 1960 John Surtees decided that two wheels was two too few, hopped into this lovely Lotus 18 and made hay on making history.\n\nColin Chapman supplied Ken Tyrrell with the car, which featured a trick Cosworth Ford engine (promised only to run in the Lotus for the remainder of the season), and Surtees was the lucky (talented) old sod who got to drive it.\n\nThe pair made an instant friendship, going toe to toe with Jim Clark and Dick Prior at Snettertone in September of 1960, before a spin saw Surtees finish in fourth.\n\nSurtees was then called up to Formula 1 and Henry Taylor took the car out at the 1960 British Empire Trophy race at Silverstone, winning handily.\n\nEnjoying complete and current FIA HTP papers, the car’s been similarly-competitive in its current career. In 2008 it claimed first in class and Championship Winner, thanks to outright wins at Pembrey and in The Gold Cup at Oulton Park, and a mighty 18 class wins at tracks including Brands Hatch, Silverstone and Spa.\n\nIt’s since been held in a private museum, heading out only for a 2012 outing to the Goodwood Revival, for which it received an engine refresh by Stuart Rolt.\n\nThe current owner lavished the car with a complete rebuild to original specification in 2007 and it is presented in immaculate condition.\n\nFun, original and competitive with John Surtees history? Checks all the boxes for us!\n\nThe car will head to auction at Silverstone Auctions’ Silverstone Classic Sale on the 26th of July, 2014, and you can get all the official information right here at their website.\n\nVia Silverstone Auctions"
