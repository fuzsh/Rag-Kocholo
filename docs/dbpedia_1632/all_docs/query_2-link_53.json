        "text": "Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car columns by Karl Ludvigsen\n\nReturn to Karl Ludvigsen main page\n\nMotor Memories\n\nThis is the last of the more than 70 columns that I've written for Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car since its launch. I've hugely enjoyed sharing some thoughts and experiences with you as well as my more than 50 articles about interesting auto designs from Abarths to Yamahas. Now however I'm giving up monthly deadlines to concentrate on books. Two Porsche-related books will be out this year. My next projects are a history of supercharging and an update of my Corvette book.\n\nA lot of my columns have been quite personal, so I thought I'd sign off with some snapshots of experiences I've found especially interesting, enjoyable and perhaps even significant-in no particular order.\n\nTwice racing the turbocharged and space-framed Group 5 Zakspeed Capris at Hockenheim.\n\nLunching with Ed Cole and executives after Ed's historic debate with Ralph Nader on the Phil Donahue show.\n\nBeing the first outsider to see a test of the phenomenal Astro-Spiral stunt on a Buffal, New York airfield.

That Chaparral power was really something! Then riding in the March with Chris-awesome!\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nSoft Spot for Saab\n\n\"Bellowing deep in its metallic bowels, the hard, sharp little airplane hove up off the runway and balanced tentatively near the treetops as it tucked its wheels away. Then it nosed up and assaulted the low-lying clouds with a vertiginous vertical climb that left the mind behind with its sudden violence.\"\n\nIn this melodramatic manner I opened my article in Sports Cars Illustrated of May 1960 about my trip to Sweden in November of 1959. This was my first overseas junket in my new role as editor of SCI, courtesy of Saab. I knew it would be cold so a gloried in my big black greatcoat, just right for the trip. Of course I forgot it at Idlewild Airport, as it was then. But Saab's welcome was warm, including the double-delta-winged Draken demonstration described above. Sensational.\n\nThe air show was above the runway at Linköping, where Saab spent two years carving from solid rock the underground factory where they produced the supersonic Draken. They let us poke around these masterworks on their subterranean production line, the air in which was changed eight times an hour. Linköping was pressing the panels for the new 95 station wagon that was the point of our visit.\n\nThis visit was the second time I'd met Rolf Mellde, Saab's chief engineer. Deep-voiced and determined, the handsome Mellde had accompanied the first Sonett roadster, his creation, to New York in 1956 when I was SCI's technical editor and he was in charge of Saab testing. The monocoque-framed Sonett appeared at New York's Coliseum that year to launch the Saab brand in America.\n\nMellde was a keen rallyist who first took two Saabs to Monte Carlo in 1950, both finishing that demanding rally. In 1959 we journalists were given rides in rally-tuned Saabs by both Mellde and team driver Tom Trana. Over the loose forest roads Rolf drove with determination, thrusting through corners, while Trana in contrast had the 93 dancing lightly with mere touches on the wheel. Both were fast but in contrasting ways.\n\nThereafter I often saw Mellde when he came to Detroit for the annual SAE meeting. He briefed me on his hopes and dreams for the completely new 99 that he was developing with the help of Standard-Triumph, which initially made its overhead-cam slant-four. Using the styling ideas of Sixten Sason, who had conceived the first Saab, the 99 was both handsome and satisfyingly Saab-esque.\n\nOn the February 1969 press junket to introduce the 99 I covered the new model in depth, because US p.r. chief Len Lonnegren and I were planning a special marketing booklet that would explain the peculiarities of this unusual car to Americans-especially the troubling fact that it was costly for its size and power. Called Karl Ludvigsen answers your questions about SAAB cars, it was produced by my business, the Mobility Systems Company. Karen Spencer designed it, using special photography by Irv Dolin. Among the booklet's questions and answers were:\n\nCan we be comfortable in a SAAB?\n\nIsn't the new SAAB too expensive to be an \"economy car\"?\n\nWill my family be safe in a SAAB?\n\nDoesn't a small car like the SAAB feel \"funny\" on the road?\n\nHow can a little country like Sweden build such a good car?\n\nLonnegren told me that his dealers found the booklet really useful in explaining the unusual Saab proposition.\n\nAs for the 99, the ambitious Rolf Mellde rightly believed that he had created a car with the potential for immense pan-European market appeal. Just enough bigger and better than Europe's basic models, it had an upmarket character that was attractive to many. Mellde invested in his 99 the attributes needed to create the breakthrough model that would give Saab the higher volumes it needed to support its long-term sustainability.\n\nTo achieve higher sales at the right price, however, the factory would have to be expensively tooled to reach increased volumes and to reduce the 99's production cost. My friend Rolf lobbied hard with Saab's owners-the Wallenberg dynasty-and company chief Tryggve Holm but they balked at spending the money. This was the last straw for Mellde, who left to join Volvo.\n\nThe mortifying struggle for survival that Saab is experiencing as I write this can be traced back to this failure by its owners to back the transformational 99. This must be seen in retrospect as the moment at which Saab elected to be a regional rather than global player. When the decision was taken Sweden's Wallenbergs were acting as marriage broker at the wedding of Saab with truck-maker Scania, creating Saab-Scania in 1970. A new and more boring badge replaced the classic Saab emblem with its distinctive front view of an airplane, a badge that vividly reminded us of Saab's aeronautical origins.\n\nSaab's origin as the offspring of an aviation company, a designer and maker of front-line supersonic jets, gave it a heady reputation. It was ideal for a maker of upscale cars whose aerodynamics and interiors could only be seen by potential customers to benefit from the know-how of an airplane maker. Sadly during its ownership of Saab GM thought it more important to stress its independence from the aircraft company, thus wasting their brand's unique selling proposition. This was but one of the many false turnings that led Saab down a dead-end street.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nA Wave to Dave\n\nSo overarching are the many contributions of David E. Davis, Jr. to all aspects of auto journalism in America that his career, which ended on March 27 this year in Ypsilanti, Michigan, is all but impossible to encapsulate. Dave was 80. I've lost one of the few people whose life has paralleled mine in surprising ways over more than half a century.\n\nDave said that we first met in the R. Gordon book shop next to the St. Regis Hotel in New York. If I remember the story he used to tell, I pulled up outside in my 300SL Gullwing, a car that always makes an impact. It featured too in our lives in Detroit, where we were both based in the mid-1960s. Davis was coming off a car-selling career and making his mark as a Chevrolet copywriter at Campbell-Ewald.\n\nDave wrote amusingly about my 1960-61 stint as editor of SCI-C/D, saying that my baptismal editorial served notice that \"automotive enthusiasm was serious business and readers were on notice that they'd better get their act together.\" Darned right! Later as C/D editor himself Dave proved that a salty dose of irreverence, patterned after the style of Britain's CAR, was just what enthusiasts wanted.\n\nIn 1964 GM - whom I'd joined in 1962 - moved me to New York, as press chief of its Overseas Operations Division. This was an extremely interesting and rewarding job that made few demands on my automotive enthusiasm. With Dave's connivance I filled that gap by becoming technical editor of his Car and Driver. I did so as \"Eric Nielssen\", who wrote regular columns and technical think pieces for C/D. Later when David and I got together we talked about Eric: \"That guy was pretty good, wasn't he?\"\n\nBig changes came for both of us in 1967. I left General Motors to take up free-lance writing and Dave took the brave step of setting up The Davis Group, Inc. at 4 Park Avenue as an advertising and promotional company. When Chevy's Friends magazine joined his client list I became a contributor to Friends and writer of various papers for Chevrolet.\n\nFor Johnson's Wax, sponsor of the Can-Am series, The Davis Group organized \"Expert Driver Seminars\" at the races in 1968. I came on board-billed as \"the country's top technical journalist\"-to help organize the seminars and moderate discussions among drivers like Mark Donohue, Dan Gurney, John Surtees, Stirling Moss and Bruce McLaren. Subscribing race fans had access to drivers on the practice day, coffee and auto writers on race morning and a buffet supper for $50 a head. Sounds cheap today but in those days it cost me $74.55 to fly to Detroit and back to confer with Donohue. These were enjoyable events which I remember with great affection.\n\nI handled another rewarding project for The Davis Group. Somehow Dave wangled from Chevrolet a Nova coupe and the assignment to make it ride and handle like a European car. He subcontracted the job to me and I in turn enlisted the help of car builder Eno DePasquale's EDP Enterprises. We set to work on spring rates, damper designs and settings and anti-roll bars to come up with a remarkably good chassis setup, if I do say so myself.\n\nTo assess the Nova's handling I used the 400-foot traffic circle in Pelham Bay's parkways that I'd featured in the Car and Driver Road Research Report. One sunny day I was driving home, mulling my findings, when I was pulled over by a cop riding a motorcycle.\n\n\"You must have a lot on your mind,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"Why do you say that, officer?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"it isn't often that somebody passes me!\"\n\nAfter I moved to England in 1980 I kept in touch with D.E.D., Jr. and his wife Jeannie, who made frequent trips to my part of the world. When we dined at London's posh Boulestin restaurant they arrived with two freshly shot pheasants in hand. Another great dinner with the Davises in Geneva at motor-show time sticks in the mind.\n\nOur professional contacts continued as well. From 1987 through 1992 Dave and I were panelists in a series of wide-ranging seminars arranged in Detroit by Ogilvy & Mather for the benefit of their clients at Ford. Briefly Davis was editorial director of Motor Trend, which he had ridiculed in 1978 as \"that famed snapper-wrapper\". He gave me an entrée to MT that was only moderately productive.\n\nMore fertile was our mutual stint during 2006-08 at Winding Road, a really terrific web magazine. Dave came on board as a friend of the publisher to shape up the monthly, which he did with his usual panache. I was over the moon to be a contributor to this pioneering internet effort and dismayed when both David and I were excess to requirements when Winding Road was wound down.\n\nWhen I was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the IAMA in 2008 I asked David to represent me at the festivities in Detroit. They turned out to be less than festive; \"I raced home and had a glass of Irish whiskey,\" Dave reported. But I was thrilled that he agreed to be my stand-in. When it came to making the most of public appearances, Dave Davis was the best of the best. I'll always think of him that way.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nNew Renaults in the Camargue\n\nI no longer have my handsome white Air France carry-on bag. I doubt that many of my fellow passengers still have theirs. In fact I guess I'm one of the few survivors of the gang of American press people who flew to France in 1961 to try out a new Renault.\n\nIt was the style in those days to take pictures of such distinguished groups of passengers so I have photographic evidence of our gallant cadre. Some came all the way from California. Dennis Shattuck was the editor of Car Life, newly under the wing of Bond Parkhurst Publishing. John R. Bond himself was with us, editor and publisher of Road & Track, while his inimitable European correspondent Henry Manney III joined us in France.\n\nAnother West Coast arrival was author and journalist Griff Borgeson. This was the bearded Griff's first trip to Europe. It was destined to have a profound influence on his life. He soon scratched his itch to be a permanent European resident. His first stop was Turin, where he and his wife Jasmine mined Italian auto stories and history until they tired of the turbulence of life in Italy and moved to Southern France. That's where Borgeson ended his days.\n\nWalt Woron also joined us from California. Joint founding editor of Motor Trend, Walt was one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. It's entirely coincidental, I'm sure, that when Walt ended his career by setting up shop in public relations, Renault became one of his major clients.\n\nThen there were the New Yorkers. Most glamorous by far was Diana Bartley. Petite and elegant, Diana jointly edited Auto Age with Harvey Janes in the mid-1950s. They launched me on my career as a professional journalist while I was still studying industrial design at Pratt Institute. Superb researcher and writer Bartley became automotive editor at Esquire and a contributor to my Car and Driver.\n\nJack Steele was with us, industry journalist who was one of the founding members of the international Motor Press Association. Also on board was Larry Sanders, an editor at Mechanix Illustrated. An urbane, witty and silver-haired WWII veteran, he wasn't yet the Lawrence Sanders that he became in 1970 with publication of his debut novel The Anderson Tapes. Larry ultimately had some 30 best-sellers to his name.\n\nThis was the motley crew that passed through immigration at Paris's Orly Airport on June 25, 1961, clutching their Air France bags, before boarding a chartered Aeromaritime puddle-jumper for the flight to the Mediterranean. Our goal was the Camargue region, an unique ecosystem in the sprawling delta of the Rhône River. There we were welcomed by the genial Robert Sicot, already a legendary Renault press chief whose passion for the best included bringing his own bartender to car launches.\n\nWith its rolling countryside and marshlands in a varied ecology, home to unique breeds of birds and steer, the Camargue was the perfect region to launch a new utility model intended to appeal to the landed classes, the Renault 4. Hugely significant in the company's annals, this was its first front-drive car, aimed squarely at the Citroën 2CV category. Like the bigger Citroëns its four-cylinder engine was behind the front axle and the transaxle out in front.\n\nWe had great fun bombing around the winding roads of the Camargue, making the most of the 4's 32 SAE horses from its 747 cc. For the power-crazed an 845 cc version was optional. Among its novelties was a water-recovery tank for its cooling system to appeal to buyers who were used to the 2CV's air cooling. That included me because I drove a 2CV-see at left-in New York at the time. Thus I had no problem with the push-pull-and-twist shifting of the Renault's three-speed box.\n\nIts five doors and semi-wagon style made the 4 ideal as a load carrier. So did its long-travel springing, which used torsion bars at front and rear. Thanks to the lateral layout of the rear bars and their trailing arms the 4's wheelbase was 94.5 inches on the left side and 96.1 inches on the right. It didn't seem to mind. The 4's concept would spawn more front-drive Renault families including the hugely successful Renault 5.\n\nRenault treated us to warm hospitality in a region that was Spanish-influenced in its cuisine and flamenco dancing. We toured the Camargue's main town of Arles, famed for its magnificent bull ring and Vincent Van Gogh's spirited paintings of 1888-89. We duly reported on a new model that had little significance for the US market but turned out to be a global money-spinner for Renault.\n\nUltimately the 4 was built not only in France but also in England, Ireland, Australia, Morocco, Slovenia, Portugal and Spain. When Renault finally phased out the 4 in 1994 it had become the best-selling French car ever. Some 100 countries had taken more than eight million of them.\n\nIn 1984 the Renault 4 came back into my life. A red one was the chosen transport of my wife-to-be Annette, who used it to get to her teaching assignments around Hertfordshire. Its main failing was in the brake department. Once parking it on a grade, she later found it in the front garden of a house at the bottom of the hill. Seems like the agricultural 4 just couldn't resist another sniff of the soil.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nEnjoying an Insider's View\n\nI've long had in mind the writing of a book titled Why Cars Are So Bad. Its theme would be the steps and missteps of auto makers that ensure that automobiles don't come out as you might expect them to in a reasonable world. Cars are less bad than they used to be, but if you've seen the industry from the inside as I have you'll be amazed that they ever get around to making any cars at all.\n\nI was reminded of this ambition when I read a new book by Royden \"Roy\" Axe called A Life in Style, from the presses of ARPublishing. Though not the most professionally produced and edited book ever printed, it provides a fabulous inside view of car making at Rootes, the Rover Group and the international operations of Chrysler when it was acquiring both Simca and Rootes, maker of Hillmans, Sunbeam-Talbots and Humbers.\n\nYou've already met Roy Axe if you're a regular reader of Sports & Exotic Car. His was the team that styled the MG EX-E concept car of 1985, a hugely handsome execution that was created to tell the world that some bright and able newcomers in Rover Group's studios were determined to improve the look of the company's cars. Partly inspired by a Ferrari 308GT that Roy owned at the time, it was based on an elegant and ambitious four-wheel-drive chassis concept worked out by Spen King, who has featured in these columns.\n\nAmong those who contributed to the EX-E's design under Axe's supervision were Gordon Sked, Richard Hamblin, Gerry McGovern, Richard Woolley and David Saddington. They had to fight every kind of delay, objection and obstruction to get the car to concept stage. When the finished MG created a sensation at the Frankfurt Show all the nay-sayers claimed to have been right all along. \"Needless to say,\" wrote Axe, \"a few people who had sat on the sidelines or took a very minor role in promoting the project were quick to associate themselves with the EX-E but that is the way of the world!\"\n\nBorn in Yorkshire, Roy Axe became car-crazy hanging around his uncle's garage business. With a liking for Rootes products, Roy obtained an apprenticeship at the Coventry company that opened his eyes to the way cars were made.\n\n\"I remember working on the Humber Hawk line fitting dash panels into the bodies,\" Axe relates. \"The procedure was to set up a crude wooden bench where the front seats would eventually be. Sitting on this bench, two of us would have the whole dash assembly passed in to us. We would then locate it by banging it into place between the windscreen pillars with our feet and then driving a few metal screws to hold it in. All this does explain why cars in those days lacked a little refinement of build quality!\"\n\nIn the early 1950s Roy Axe achieved his goal of moving into the Rootes styling department. In the mid-1960s he was given his first project to manage, the design of a coupe version of the four-door Hillman Hunter. This was to be a new version of the Sunbeam Rapier. He succeeded in giving it a fastback but was told he couldn't have a wraparound rear window; it would have to be in three pieces.\n\nRoy made the best of this but was barred from making much-needed changes to the rest of the exterior panels if a good-looking coupe were to be the result. To his credit-and risk at an early stage of his career-he fought hard against the all-powerful body engineers to be released from some of their often arbitrary restrictions. \"Everything was an enormous struggle,\" Axe recalled, \"and it seemed to us often so frustrating.\" In the end he had to go along with the recycling of the Hunter's station-wagon tail-lamps on the Rapier coupe.\n\nBy the time he joined the Rover Group in 1982 Roy Axe was a seasoned design leader after a spell in Chrysler's Detroit studios. \"On the second day at the new job,\" he writes, \"I was exposed to the Maestro. I thought this design was a disaster. The proportions were bad and the detail awkward and clumsy. The concave sides made the design look weak and the whole thing looked totally dated.\"\n\nTold he couldn't make any changes to the Maestro because it was already tooled for production, Axe was then exposed to the longer and more upmarket Montego. He was told that in this case he had some time to make improvements. \"It is hard to know what to say in circumstances like this,\" he related, \"but my first remarks were that the design should be scrapped and the whole thing done again.\"\n\nIn his book Roy Axe entertainingly and candidly describes these struggles and the subsequent challenges of working with Honda's designers to create the jointly engineered Honda Legend and Rover 800. Hopes were high for new products that would enjoy some of the quality advantages of their Japanese counterparts, \"but manufacturing and engineering failed to deliver,\" Roy wrote ruefully, \"although a huge amount of money and effort had been expended.\" The result was the collapse and sale of Rover for reasons that Roy Axe makes clear in his revelatory book. It appeared last year just before the death of this most likeable and able of designers at the age of 73.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nCharmed Career of the Chrome Cobra\n\nBefore me as I write is an 8 x 10 glossy of the Opel Rekord II introduced at the beginning of 1972. It's a strikingly elegant two-door that could have come from the studios of Pininfarina, so tautly are its surfaces drawn and so finely are its moldings and details executed. Its four-door sedan and station-wagon sisters were similarly classy-easily Europe's most gorgeous series-production cars.\n\nThese Opels were the work of Charles Morell Jordan, a Californian who was 44 when his new Rekords were unveiled. Formerly Cadillac's studio chief, he'd been sent to the Opel works in Rüsselsheim, Germany by GM styling boss Bill Mitchell as part of his policy of getting more involved with the designs of GM's overseas models. In addition, running his own styling mini-empire would broaden and deepen Chuck Jordan's experience to prepare him to succeed Mitchell.\n\nDuring his tour of duty at Opel Jordan completely overhauled the looks of the company's products. He signaled his intentions at 1969's Frankfurt Show with a stunning concept car, the Opel CD. Based on the company's Diplomat running gear, powered by a Chevrolet V8, this was a stunningly low coupe with a swing-up wraparound canopy and under-nose air inlet.\n\nInspired by Jordan's CD, racer-entrepreneur Erich Bitter created a CD of his own and won GM's approval for the use of Diplomatic underpinnings for a production car. Suavely restyled for series manufacture by Stuttgart's Baur, the Bitter CD was a welcome addition to the world of exotic cars.\n\nFirst of Jordan's Opels to appear were the new mid-range models of 1970, the mainstream Ascona and the sporty Manta coupe on the same platform. These were sharply chiseled cars that substantially elevated Opel's image. The Manta in particular became a pan-European favorite.\n\nNext came the Rekord, whose beauty and refinement showed that Jordan was winning more of his battles with Opel's conservative engineers. For decades a company in which production demand took priority, Adam Opel AG was being dragged by Jordan to a new appreciation of the value of good looks. As part of this campaign he created a special \"skunk works\" studio for Tony Lapine, the iconoclastic engineer-designer who would later head Porsche's styling. Lapine designed and built space-framed sports-car and racing-car prototypes.\n\nIn 1973 Chuck and his team dropped the third shoe, their new look for the Opel Kadett. Immensely important to GM, this was the new T-Body model that went into production not only in Germany but also in Britain as a Vauxhall, in Japan as an Isuzu and in America and Brazil as the Chevrolet Chevette. Good-looking and easy to build, it was just the car that Chevy needed when the first Energy Crisis hit.\n\nBy that time Chuck Jordan was back in the Big PX with overall design responsibility for GM's American vehicle ranges. This positioned him perfectly to take over when Bill Mitchell retired in 1977. Controversially, however, the tall, ambitious and outspoken Jordan had gained a reputation for independence of thought and action that earned him his \"Chrome Cobra\" nickname. Wanting a quiet life after the bumptious Mitchell's incumbency, GM's directors instead chose the uncontroversial and biddable Irv Rybicki.\n\nThis was a crushing disappointment for Jordan. He told me he was taking it philosophically, resigned to playing a waiting game. Chuck finally gained the top job in 1986, after Rybicki's reign had produced cars that GM's competitors lampooned as banal and indistinguishable. Jordan invested GM's models with taste, variety and personality in the few years available to him before his retirement in 1992.\n\nHis European stint and his friendship with Sergio Pininfarina brought Ferraris into Jordan's orbit, starting with a 250GT Lusso and continuing with its successors including the Daytona. As just one of his many post-retirement activities he was one of the judges at the concours d'elegance held at Fiorano during Ferrari's 60th-anniversary party in 2008. Although we spoke later, it was the last time I saw him.\n\nI first met Chuck Jordan early in 1956 in Brooklyn, New York where I was a student at Pratt Institute. We had dinner under the elevated line on Myrtle Avenue at the Venice Restaurant, justly famed for its chocolate cheesecake. I'd heard of Jordan, for he was the most prominent graduate of an MIT course in creative engineering that I'd also taken before switching to Pratt.\n\nJoining GM in 1949, Jordan put his creative engineering to work on such projects as a twin-engined bulldozer, a Train of Tomorrow and the 1955 Motorama's l'Universelle, a front-drive predecessor of the modern minivan. He was working on another Motorama car, the Buick Centurion. When he told me that it would have a rear-vision TV system, I had the cheek to ask him if he'd reversed the dashboard image-as he should-so it would picture the view the same way a mirror did.\n\nChuck Jordan had been sent to recruit me to GM Styling Staff. He was just the right man to do it. Instead of finishing my degree at Pratt I left for Michigan and the spanking-new Warren Tech Center that spring of 1956. It was a move I've never had cause to regret, so I had a lot to think about when I heard that Chuck Jordan left us last December 9th at the age of 83. I realized that I never properly thanked him.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nThose Electric-Car Competitions\n\nWith so much interest in battery-powered cars, we're hearing about \"the first electric-car race\" here and \"the first green car competition\" there. Well, the first ones took place quite a while ago. In fact I covered a coast-to-coast electric-car race in 1968 in which Cal Tech narrowly beat MIT. But the first serious electric-vehicle competition of which I'm aware was quite a lot earlier than that-in 1900 to be exact.\n\nDuring November 6 through 9, 1900 the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland-forerunner of today's RAC-organized a trial for electric cars. They based the trial south-east of London at the Chislehurst Electric Light Station, which received its direct current from generators three miles away at Bromley. The cars were to tackle varying routes in the area during successive days. The same batteries were to be used in all the tests.\n\nWhen the routes were revealed only two days before the start the entrants cried foul, for they included the most hilly roads in the region. One called it \"a prolonged hill-climbing test\". Recent rains also made the unpaved roads rough and heavy. Making the best of it, the contestants set out from Chislehurst on Tuesday the 6th to see who could cover the longest distance on that day's prescribed route.\n\nAmong the eleven entries was the Powerful, built by Paris-based Louis Kriéger's company. It had 60 Lee-Coll cells giving 250 ampere-hours. This seemed a good formula to cope with the competition, which required an official on-board observer. Also expected to make a good showing were three entries from Luton's E. W. Hart, who was keen to establish a strong position in the then-active market for electric cars.\n\nBuilt by Wehrlé-Godard, one of Hart's entries was called Le Presque Contente, with a sly dig at Camille Jenatzy's electric record-breaker, Le Jamais Contente, while another was Hart's own creation. He commissioned his third entry from Jakob Lohner of Vienna, for whom Hart was the UK agent. It was powered by 70 Type 30EE Lee-Coll cells weighing a total of 3,970 pounds. The Lohner was in fact the only one of Hart's three entries to appear at Chislehurst.\n\nHart's Lohner was designed by the precocious Ferdinand Porsche, then only 25. Dubbed La Toujours Contente, it looked much like a battery box on wheels, which is just what it was. A unique feature was the separation of its battery container from the chassis by vertical coil springs, with the aim of protecting its fragile electric cells from harm. Drawing on the ample capacity of 270 ampere-hours, its controller gave four speeds forward, three in reverse, electric braking and battery recuperation on the overrun.\n\nThe batteries drove all four wheels through Porsche's ingenious electric-wheel motors, giving a potential 56 horsepower. With these alone weighing a total of 1,280 pounds, the weight of the complete vehicle was more than four tons. Nevertheless Continental's pneumatic tires carried it. The Lohner-Porsche creation had back-to-back seating for four atop its accumulators. Ferdinand Porsche himself was nominated to drive his creation.\n\nThe first two cars, Porsche's Lohner and Kriéger's Powerful, started out at 9:45 am. Destined to win the trial, Powerful rolled a proud 59 miles in its first outing, averaging about 10 mph. In La Toujours Contente Porsche had to cry enough with tire failures and fused wiring after 34 miles in a vehicle that in theory should easily have surpassed the magic 100 kilometers or 62 miles.\n\nLouis Kriéger's two-man Powerful had almost as much battery capacity as Porsche's machine and weighed more than a ton less. More importantly it had very large wheels-especially the rear drive wheels-that were kinder to their Michelin tires. La Toujours Contente, in contrast, had to ride on the smaller wheels that were compatible with Porsche's drive system. In a desperate attempt to lighten his vehicle Porsche removed its battery covers and rear seats, only to have to throw blankets and boards over the batteries to satisfy those who thought the naked cells were hazardous to bystanders.\n\nThat some other entrants managed only seven miles, and that the event's venue and organization were heavily criticized, were little consolation. Among the shortcomings, said one competitor, was that \"there were inches of mud on the floors; rain came through the roof; the sheds were doorless and the cars and attendants were nightly exposed to the full force of wind and rain.\" This was the last straw for Ferdinand Porsche, who had been driving himself hard to complete Hart's vehicle. His constitution was so weak that he caught a fierce cold during the first day's run.\n\nPorsche heaved himself out of his sickbed on the Wednesday but arrived at Chislehurst too late to start at his prescribed time. \"By dint of much doctoring he subsequently recovered,\" said The Motor-Car Journal, and would have driven the vehicle, but the judges adhered rigidly to the rules.\" They shrugged off Hart's heated protests. Porsche's lateness meant he couldn't compete officially. Nevertheless La Toujours Contente took part hors concours and \"in good style\" on the second day of the trials until tire collapses halted it again.\n\nPorsche's creation must have been among the cars which Hart sold off in an auction of the various vehicles which, said St. John Nixon, the man from Luton \"had foolishly bought\". Both men were more than a century ahead of their time.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nMeet Mister Mundy\n\nOn February 24, 1971 I had an appointment at Brown's Lane in Coventry to be briefed on the Jaguar's all-new V-12 engine. Chief briefer was a man with many stories to tell of his previous experiences at Bentley, Brooklands and Coventry Climax, chief power-unit engineer Wally Hassan. Of most interest to me, however, was his colleague Harry Mundy, Jaguar's chief development engineer for power units. Harry was a close personal friend of long standing.\n\nIn 1958 I was in Europe courtesy of the US Army Signal Corps. I used my leave time to go to the races, first of all to the Monaco Grand Prix on May 18, then the Belgian G.P. on June 15. At one of these I met Harry Mundy, who was then technical editor of The Autocar, because by July we were corresponding. He was nice enough to write that \"I knew of you because I have always admired your writings and read them with great interest.\"\n\nBorn on January 15, 1916, Harry was then 42 and had been in his post at The Autocar for three years. He was slender with a hawk-like visage, thinning hair and a distinct resemblance to English actor Trevor Howard. In fact Harry's bone-dry delivery and crusty demeanor-offputting to the uninitiated-were not unlike Howard's but we hit it off.\n\nMundy had a glistening résumé in the field of cars and racing. Born in Coventry, he was educated at the Henry VIII School and Coventry Technical College. After an apprenticeship at Alvis he was worked on details of both engines and gearboxes. In 1936 Harry joined a small design team at British racing-car maker ERA. That took him to the racing shops at Brooklands where Wally Hassan was a leading figure. The two engineers formed a close and life-long friendship.\n\nWith ERA struggling, by 1939 Harry Mundy was back in Coventry as a senior designer for Morris Engines. When war broke out the versatile Mundy served the Royal Air Force as an engineer officer. Late in the war Raymond Mays launched his bold effort to create an all-British Formula 1 car with industry backing. In 1946 Mundy came aboard to head the design office that created the elaborate and ambitious supercharged 1½-liter BRM.\n\nReporting to chief engineer Peter Berthon, Harry tried to restrain his boss's flights of fancy. Deciding on the car's engine configuration, Berthon and his colleagues went for the ultimate. When Mundy proffered the credentials of the V-8, easy to build and develop and compact in the chassis, \"they said no, that would be like the 1939 Tripoli-winning Mercedes-Benz. I couldn't see why that was bad!\" Instead Berthon and company plunked for a V-16 that gave no end of trouble.\n\nIn 1950 Wally Hassan, now technical director of Coventry Climax, thought of Harry when he needed to build up his engineering team. Together the friends designed engines that made history for Coventry Climax. Starting with an ultra-light fire-pump engine, Climax moved up to a single-cam four that powered countless Coopers and Lotuses as well as the Lotus Elite road car.\n\nWhen the new 2½-liter Formula 1 launched in 1954 the Hassan/Mundy team produced a four-cam V-8, one bank of which became the twin-cam FPF four. Making its debut in 1957 as a 1½-liter |Formula 2 engine, the FPF was gradually enlarged until in 2½-liter form it took Jack Brabham and the Cooper-Climax to the world championships of 1959 and 1960.\n\nAlthough he launched the FPF's design, by the time of its success Harry Mundy was at The Autocar, sagely commenting on its engineering. He was happy there, especially with the opportunities his job offered for foreign travel. In mid-1962 when I was a GM public relations man Harry spent a week with us in Detroit during which we refreshed our friendship.\n\nMundy's engineering talents weren't overlooked in these years. Colin Chapman in particular drew on his expertise. When he wanted a twin-cam cylinder head to sit on a new Ford block, Colin called on Mundy, who designed a winner that powered the Lotus Cortina and many other Lotuses.\n\nFor the 1962-63 edition of Automobile Year Mundy wrote a fabulous history of Grand Prix engine design. This inspired me to propose that we jointly write a history of the racing engine. I put an outline together which we jointly agreed and we received advances from an esteemed London publisher. It seemed, however, that we each thought the other was doing the writing! Finally we had to admit defeat and return our advances.\n\nAfter no little difficulty Wally Hassan persuaded Harry to leave the sybaritic life of a motoring journalist and join Jaguar as chief engine development engineer in 1964 to guide the creation of Jaguar's V-12. Mundy played a major role in persuading the company away from an elaborate four-cam design and toward the superb 5.3-liter twelve with a single cam above each bank that was introduced in 1971.\n\nIn 1980 Harry Mundy retired from Jaguar. That coincided with my arrival in England so I was able to visit him and Margaret at Kenilworth near Coventry. He stayed active as a consultant, penning his \"Trident\" engine, a W-12 proposal for the 3.0-liter Formula 1. When Harry died in 1988 British engineering lost one of its key figures, a designer who uniquely married innovation with practicality-when he was given the chance.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nEurope's Tremendous Twins\n\n\"Fiat will attend the 2010 Geneva Show next month with one of the most important technologies released in Europe in the last few years: the first two-cylinder on the Old Continent.\" That was a breathless report last February about a new engine that's now available in production for the Fiat 500, a vertical twin with turbocharging and a counter-rotating balancing shaft that smoothes the impulses of its two pistons.\n\nFiat makes major claims for its new twin, which uses its ingenious TwinAir system to control inlet-valve opening for optimum economy. Operating the valves hydraulically, the system is a joint effort between Fiat and Germany's Schaeffler Group, which makes the hardware. The new 900 cc twin is said to give comparable performance to Fiat's 1.4-liter twin-cam four while burning 30 percent less fuel. That's a big bonus in the form of lower carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe report's reference to \"the first two-cylinder on the Old Continent\" was made because India is the source of Tata's ultra-low-priced Nano. It also has a twin-cylinder engine, much smaller at 624 cc and delivering 35 horsepower. Industry interest in the twin is rising thanks to its lightness, compactness and much-reduced internal friction.\n\nThis is all very well for our environment and welcome improvements in car efficiency. But what about the claim \"the first two-cylinder on the Old Continent\"? Europe's first ever? Surely not! To sample this statement I pulled out the Swiss Automobil Revue catalogue issue of 1960. By then Europe's post-war auto world would have settled down. Twins would have been history.\n\nOr were they? Far from it, as it turned out. In 1960 no fewer than 23 European makes offered two-cylinder autos. Adding three makers of twins in Japan the global total came to 26. So the Old Continent was doing pretty well as a maker of twins.\n\nNone other than Fiat, with its 500, was a powerhouse of twin production then. That's why its relaunch of a two-cylinder engine in the new 500 is especially newsworthy. As its name indicated the 500's capacity was 479 cc, a vertical air-cooled twin in the rear producing 21 horsepower. The little 500 demanded driving skill with its unsynchronized \"crash\" gearbox.\n\nOthers rode piggyback on the 500's successful design. Fiat affiliate Autobianchi produced its charming Bianchina on the 500 platform. Another exploiter of the platform was Moretti, whose production by then was erratic at best. In Austria Steyr-Puch built its 493 cc 500D model based on the 500 but powered by an air-cooled flat twin of its own design in the rear, while in Germany NSU-Fiat also offered a 500 spin-off.\n\nPiggyback was also practiced in France, where Panhard's entire production was two-cylindered. After the war this venerable auto maker cast its lot with a brilliant air-cooled flat twin driving the front wheels in its Dyna, an advanced all-aluminum sedan. The engine had such advanced features as hemi heads and torsion-bar valve springs. In the Panhard PL17 it developed 42 net horsepower from 851 cc and 50 horses in \"Tigre\" tune.\n\nPanhard components were exploited by French makers of sporting cars Arista and Sera. Most prominent however was DB Deutsch & Bonnet. The 1938 creation of engineers Charles Deutsch and René Bonnet, it produced the DB sports cars that compiled outstanding records in rallying and racing, the latter especially at Le Mans with engines tailored to the 750 cc class. DB also made single-seaters, one of which was supercharged to compete in Formula 1-unsuccessfully-in 1955.\n\nIn 1960 France had two other makers of twin-cylinder cars. One was Vespa, which made a tiny auto with a two-stroke engine of 394 cc. Air-cooled, it was based on a prototype designed by Italy's Piaggio. The other of course was Citroën, with its evergreen 2CV. Its air-cooled 424 cc twin was flat-opposed, producing 12½ horsepower to motivate the classic French utility car.\n\nBritain offered a motley array of autos with air-cooled vertical twins. While the 244 cc Frisky was a three-wheeled two-stroke the Fairthorpe Atomota was a proper car-sort of-with a 646 cc BSA twin. Most sporting were the offerings of Berkeley, whose B95 featured a Royal Enfield four-stroke twin of 692 cc.\n\nNumerically Germany had the most twin-cylindered nameplates with a total of seven, including NSU-Fiat. Serious volume producers were BMW with its flat-twin 700 of 697 cc and two makers with vertical twins, Lloyd with its 596 cc 600 model driving the front wheels and NSU mounting its 583 cc engine in the back of its Prinz. All were air-cooled, as was the two-stroke 500 cc twin powering East Germany's staple transport, the famously smoky front-drive Trabant.\n\nOther German twins included Goggomobil's rear-engined T400 with 392 cc; its range also offered engines of 293 and 688 cc. Also in the ultra-small class was FMR's TG500 of 494 cc, based on Messerschmitt's tandem-seated design.\n\nMore Europeans were on the twin-cylinder bandwagon. A newcomer was Holland's DAF with its 590 cc flat twin. Poland produced its Mikrus and Syrena. Both were two-strokes, as was Spain's TZ Sider. Rounding out the global production of twins in 1960 were Japan's Subaru, Mitsubishi and Mikasa.\n\nThat's a pretty convincing array of two-cylinder-car producers. I welcome Fiat's return, not as a pioneer but as a returnee to an \"Old Continent\" that led the world by far in the production of twins for many years.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nRallying on All Fours\n\nMy first Geneva Salon as a freshly minted Ford of Europe vice president was in March of 1980. Ferrari showed its Mondial 8, Fiat its Panda, Renault its sporty Fuego and Lancia its Delta, already judged 1980's Car of the Year. Many of us, however, gravitated to Audi's spacious stand. There several show cars and a cutaway chassis displayed the Ingolstadt's company's innovation for the new decade: the Quattro.\n\nHere was a tremendously controversial new concept that had all of us at Ford speculating about its significance. Four-wheel drive was seen as the province of boxy Jeep-like vehicles of which many were on the market. Only two other companies were making all-wheel-drive passenger cars. One of course was Subaru while the other was American Motors with its Eagle, which had Jeep-type drive lines under Hornet unit bodies.\n\nThe Subaru and AMC entries were seen as utility-type vehicles, suitable for mailmen on bad roads or for foremen to drive to constriction sites. But here in the Quattro was a sporty-looking coupe with a turbocharged five-cylinder engine giving 200 horses! What were we to make of it? Was it a bizarre blind alley, adopted to exploit Audi's four-ringed emblem, or an important innovation that would change the industry?\n\nFerdinand Piëch, Audi's engineering chief, proudly patrolled his stand, openly explaining the background to the Quattro. Inspiration had come during a winter test of new models in Finland in February of 1977. Accompanying the front-drive Audis on ice and snow was a crude-looking VW Iltis, being developed by Audi's parent company for the German army. On the slippery Arctic roads the 4x4 Iltis-German for polecat-drove rings around the Audis. This gave the Audi men an idea.\n\nTesting chief Jörg Bensinger compared notes with his advanced-design colleagues Walter Treser and Karl Bauer. It would be easy enough, they decided, to put the drive system of the Iltis in an Audi 80. Presented with the idea, Piëch gave them the green light but stressed that it would have to be done in secret, a \"black project\", because Audi had no approval for such a wild idea.\n\nBy 1978 they had a prototype using the simple Iltis drive line, which had a fixed drive shaft between the front and rear differentials. This was all right for loose surfaces, but when they demonstrated their car to VW development chief Ernst Fiala in a Vienna parking garage his wife complained that it \"hopped\" around corners. A differential was needed in the drive between the front and rear wheel pairs. This was cleverly engineered by designer Franz Tengler.\n\nNow they had a car that they could demonstrate to VW chief Toni Schmücker, who would decide whether they'd get the money to develop a production version. With the passage of the seasons, however, no snow or ice was to be seen. On a steep slope at Ingolstadt the fire department hosed the surface down to make a reasonable facsimile. First Schmücker drove a BMW 3-Series which made it a third of the way up. The Audi 80 managed half the grade but the four-wheel-drive prototype easily topped the hill. \"Then the investment was approved,\" said a happy Ferdinand Piëch.\n\nAlready under development, a coupe version of the 80 was nominated to carry the 4x4 drive line. Add a turbo-blower to the five-cylinder engine and presto! The Quattro was ready. Walter Treser came up with the \"Quadro\" name which Piëch changed to \"Quattro\" to sound more gritty. And the concept did indeed perfectly suit Audi's four-ringed emblem, which was blazoned on the coupe's flanks.\n\nFor me and my chief of rallying Peter Ashcroft the Quattro posed a question: could this be a threat to our rally-winning Escort and the new rear-drive version of the latest Escort that we were developing? Our experts pooh-poohed the idea. Four-wheel drive was allowed in rallying; it had been approved earlier because Jeep though it might take part. But we'd concluded that it didn't offer the control options that a rally driver needed. After trying the Ferguson 4x4 system in a Capri Ford judged that it was all right for rallycross but not for rallying.\n\nOne of our rally drivers was the talented Finn Hannu Mikkola. We had no objection when Hannu told us he was being asked to test a rally version of the Quattro; we could only learn something. And learn we did. Hannu came back wide-eyed and voluble. The Quattro was awesome, he said, with remarkable grip and traction. This knocked all our calculations into a cocked hat.\n\nSoon we were revising the design of our Group B RS1700T rally car to be able to phase in a four-by-four version alongside the rear-drive model we hoped to be running in 1983. We found a way to homologate the 200-unit production of both versions with a total of around 300 units, but Ford's brass wouldn't wear what we viewed as a common subterfuge in the world of motor sports. The RS1700T was stillborn.\n\nHannu Mikkola went on to drive for Audi in 1983, winning both the driver and marque world championships. Sweden's Stig Blomqvist did likewise in 1984. From now on rally cars would be four-wheel-driven whenever the rules allowed. Though Audi would capitalize on its Quattro technology, other car makers offered 4x4 models too. In fact it became an important and profitable new option for the industry.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nThe Agnellis\n\n\"Do you remember what happened that time we landed here a few years back?\" asked my wife Annette as our British Airways flight touched the concrete a few days ago at Catania, an airport on the east coast of Sicily. \"It caused quite a stir as I recall.\" We'd gone into the then-modest terminal and were waiting for our bags when a man broke free from a sinister-looking group and walked toward us, smiling. It was the urbane figure of Umberto Agnelli, 13-years-younger younger brother of Gianni Agnelli, chief of the Fiat empire.\n\nAs Agnelli's many swarthy minders looked on in astonishment and some trepidation and to the amazement of other travelers, to whom the Agnellis were at the right hand of God, Umberto engaged us in casual conversation. He was in Sicily for a conference while we were en route to our usual holiday in Taormina.\n\nUmberto was darker and more slender than his older brother and blessed or cursed with large brown eyes that might all too often betray his emotions. Youngest of seven siblings, Umberto lived in the shadow of his silver-haired oldest brother, he of the boldly Roman profile. But I always had a soft spot for Umberto, mainly because we were about the same age.\n\nAlthough I had met him in the past as a journalist, my first serious contact with Umberto was during my years as an executive vice president of Fiat Motors of North America at the end of the 1970s. Umberto paid us several visits in Montvale, New Jersey, where our headquarters of handsome design measured up to the egos of visitors from the headquarters in Turin. My empire included relations with dealers, customers, the press, government and legal affairs, so there was much to discuss.\n\nLater when I was with Ford of Europe my contacts with the top floor at 10 Via Marconi in Turin were facilitated by my long friendship with Rudy Mailander. A former photojournalist and PR man at Daimler-Benz, Rudy was now the main point of contact between the Agnellis and all international governmental and business bodies. He carried on in this capacity with Umberto after his brother Gianni died.\n\nLater, when I was running a London consulting company, I saw that Umberto had effectively taken over at Fiat Auto after Gianni's death and would thus be an important business target for me. Though Rudy had since retired from Fiat I asked if he wouldn't mind setting up a meeting for me with his former chief. Somewhat to my surprise Mailander demurred. It turned out that before my friend's retirement there'd been talk of arranging an ongoing consulting relationship with Fiat that would have been to his considerable benefit. Umberto, however, scotched the idea.\n\nThis didn't surprise me, since I'd been treated in much the same manner by Walter Hayes and Bob Lutz when I left Ford of Europe. But it didn't make me eager to do business with Umberto. I last saw him at a Turin Salon in 2004, making the rounds in the company of Giorgetto Giugiaro. Only weeks later he died suddenly of lung cancer at the age of 69. He was the last Agnelli to lead the company.\n\nI had several opportunities to admire the poise and skill of Gianni Agnelli in my capacity as a journalist in the 1970s. He gave an impressive press briefing to the SAE in Detroit before making a keynote speech and his press conferences before Turin Salons were the stuff of legend. He was a shrewd observer of the automotive scene throughout the world, a role he had taken on when he shook off his youthful playboy persona and began to get to grips with Fiat.\n\nGianni Agnelli too visited us in Montvale. I remember well a meeting with him in my boss's office to go over some current matters during his stop with us. Although immaculately suited he was oddly booted in what looked like Hushpuppies, a style he adopted after his feet were injured in an auto crash. As usual he wore his wristwatch on the outside of his shirt cuff, a distinctive style that he originated and that was also adopted by my friend Rudy Mailander.\n\nWhen we launched the Fiat Ritmo in America, named the Strada for US consumption, we pulled out all the stops with a dealer meeting in Las Vegas. As a major coup for us Gianni Agnelli agreed to attend and address the crowd. One way and another I had made my bones in a quiet manner with Agnelli, who referred to me in discussions with Fiat insiders as \"that young American\". One of the attractions of a post with Fiat in Turin - which I was offered but turned down - would have been the chance to get closer to this most remarkable man.\n\nBoth brothers had sons who were seen as potential future leaders of Fiat. Born in 1954, Gianni's son Edoardo was looked to but he went well off the rails, finally ending a troubled life himself in 2000. Thereafter Umberto's son Giovanni Alberto was in the frame but tragically died of cancer in 1997 aged only 33. Immediately the mantle fell on the eldest son of Agnelli sister Margherita, John Elkann, who was named to the Fiat board at the age of 22. He now chairs both Fiat and the Agnellis' private investment group. There's nothing like keeping it in the family!\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nAll Gone Ghia\n\nWhen I first visited Carrozzeria Ghia in 1967 it was in a corporate hiatus but on a binge of fine design. Starting in the 1950s lively English-speaking entrepreneur Luigi Segre forged the first-class links that Ghia had with Chrysler. Ghia not only built Virgil Exner's concept cars but also created cars of its own on Chrysler chassis, leading to a series of ultra-luxury Crown Imperials and the Dual Ghias beloved of Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack.\n\nAfter Segre's premature demise in 1963 his widow sold control of Ghia to-of all people-the son of deposed Dominican dictator Raul Trujillo. Needing talent to revive the company, Ghia's manager hired a promising designer from Bertone named Giorgetto Giugiaro. His first efforts were visible at the 1966 Turin Salon in a magnificent new sports Maserati, the Ghibli, and an impressive mid-engined de Tomaso, the backbone-chassis Mangusta that I photographed during my visit..\n\nAt a time when mid-engined sports cars for the road were much in the news, the sleek Ford-powered Mangusta made headlines. The Mangusta was a \"de Tomaso\" because Ghia was bought by American interests that put émigré Argentinean Alejandro de Tomaso in charge. Though mercurial and capricious to a fault, de Tomaso had the style and daring to forge links with Ford's Lee Iacocca. For \"Lido\" he created a new mid-engined sports car, the Dearborn-engined Pantera designed by Tom Tjaarda.\n\nDuring February 7 through 9, 1970 I was in Rome and then at Ghia in Turin for the \"long-lead\" presentation of the Pantera. I helped push the engineless styling model around Rome's \"wedding cake\" monument to Victor Emmanuel II under the eye of Rick McBride's camera. In preparation for its American launch I wrote the Pantera's press kit.\n\nBy 1973 Ford owned most of de Tomaso's enterprises outright, including Ghia. Nominated to head Ford's \"Ghia Operations\" was Filippo Sapino, who had begun his career with Ghia but sheltered at Pininfarina during the chaotic de Tomaso years. Mild-mannered and thoughtful, the bespectacled Sapino was the antithesis of the excitable Italian and the ideal man to steer Ghia under its new owners.\n\nFord quickly began exploiting its Ghia brand for the benefit of its production cars. \"Ghia\" became the top range for the 1974-model Mustang II and also for 1974's European Granada. Meanwhile under its American liaison man Don DeLaRossa Ghia was producing increasingly bizarre concept cars.\n\nWhen I arrived at Ford of Europe in 1980 I was still dubious about Ghia's work. But its first concept built on our new front-drive Escort chassis, the Avant Garde coupe, was clean-lined and elegant. I learned that Ghia had come under the aegis of a genial Dearborn designer of taste, Don Kopka. Strangely, at that time there was no operating connection between Ford of Europe and its Turin sister. After warm discussions with Kopka we got the green light to start working directly with Ghia on design projects.\n\nDuring a visit to Turin my boss Bob Lutz and I huddled with Filippo Sapino to see where we had common interests. Filippo always made sure that our visits were on a day when nearby restaurant Tre Colonne was open for lunch, serving the best in Piemontese cuisine. When Sapino said that he was looking for a mid-engined chassis as a basis for some studies, I suggested Britain's Ford-powered AC 3000ME. We got out the Automobil Revue catalogue issue to show him the car and its specification. This resulted in the exciting AC-Ghia sports car (see Sports & Exotic Car of March 2006) and the five-seated Quicksilver.\n\nTwo other projects grew out of that meeting. One was the Cockpit, a tandem two-seater intended to show that Ford of Europe was ready if fuel prices skyrocketed. The other was the Barchetta, a delightful roadster based on the Fiesta platform. Lutz and I were adamant that Ghia shouldn't cheat in creating the Barchetta, that it had to have real potential for production. However Sapino requested - and got - my approval to move the position of its radiator.\n\nOne of Britain's multitude of kit-car builders soon offered its version of the Barchetta. Ford's own attempt to put it into production as originally conceived foundered under the weight of all the gizmos the American market would need, from crash-safety bolstering to air conditioning. Nevertheless the concept was too appealing to expire completely. In a bowdlerized version the Barchetta was finally introduced by Ford Australia on the Mazda 323 platform as the Capri in 1990 and sold in the US by Mercury.\n\nThese memories came flooding back when I heard that Ford was ditching the Ghia name for its upmarket series. The carrozzeria has long since gone to coachbuilder heaven, courtesy of styling chief J. Mays, who preferred a British base for his out-of-the-box thinkers. Now the Ghia name has been dropped from the European Galaxy and S-Max ranges and won't survive the planned facelift of the Mondeo.\n\nOne other memory pops up. One of our most important missions at Ford of Europe was readying versions of our Sierra and Scorpio for sale in America through Lincoln-Mercury dealers. What they needed was a brand name that was appropriate to a European product, yet in the Ford family. My recommendation was Ghia. Instead, the choice was Merkur. Who's to say that the venture wouldn't have been more successful under the banner of a well-known and respected Italian brand?\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nThe Voice of Spen King\n\nAt 85 Charles Spencer King was still going strong. He was out for a bike ride when injured by a collision with a van, a mishap that sadly resulted in his death last June 26th. Though best known for his creation of the Range Rover, one of history's most influential and successful vehicles, \"Spen\" King was the engineer behind such sophisticated Rovers as the 2000 and the SD1 and Triumph sports cars TR6, Stag and TR7.\n\nKing had a flair for the exotic. When he joined Rover in 1945 he worked on that company's trend-setting turbine cars. With colleagues he built the Rover-based Marauder sports car and a single-seater, also using Rover components. Its special de Dion rear suspension was a feature of King's mid-engined Rover P6BS prototype, a sports car so good that, fearing its threat, Jaguar's William Lyons demanded - and got - its cancellation.\n\nWhen I interviewed him in 1972, Spen King had just been made chief engineer of both Triumph and Rover. Plunged into the chaos of the mergers that created British Leyland, he was tasked with making the most of the available material at a time when America was throwing new regulations at the car industry right, left and center. Here's some of our dialogue:\n\nKarl: You came up to your present post through the Rover Company where, as well as in your present work, you've shown a highly individualistic approach to car design. Has a certain atmosphere at Rovers encouraged this?\n\nKing: I think so. Different companies have different prime interests. You've got sales-oriented companies or production-oriented companies, and sometimes you get an engineering-oriented company. The Rover Company has always been the latter, I reckon.\n\nKarl: You once built an experimental Rover turbine coupe, a rear-engined four-wheel-drive vehicle, the T3. Was that four-wheel-drive concept-ever considered for other types of cars?\n\nKing: The four-wheel-drive concept wasn't, but of course the Rover 2000's de Dion rear suspension was the T3 rear suspension, absolutely. And that suspension layout came out of the racing Rover Special some of us built in 1948-1950. They were direct descendants of one another.\n\nKarl: I suppose such interesting experimental cars are still being built by you today, but we just aren't allowed to see them.\n\nKing: We had a period of freedom to have a go at building cars for the sake of learning, but life's a bit harder these days. We don't have the same amount of time that we did then.\n\nKarl: Some of that time has to be spent on meeting our American legal requirements. I imagine the USA is still a significant market for Triumph sports cars.\n\nKing: Yes, it's very important to us indeed, and we are taking it seriously. And of course the timing is such that you don't know what the final regulation is going to be until long after you've settled the design! It's a ghastly sort of guessing game. I'm all in favor of making safer motorcars and saving peoples' lives, but being tied down by regulations which we don't know about until long after we're committed makes life extraordinarily difficult. We are really taking gambles the whole time, and big gambles too.\n\nKarl: Do you feel that today's pressures on costs will still allow you to give your cars a reasonable amount of interesting technical content?\n\nKing: That brings up something else that needs to be absorbed, and that is a lot more knowledge of how to make simple things work properly. I mean, the beam axle is a thing which is terribly easily done badly! We're learning an awful lot about how to do simple things well, and this mustn't be underrated. What we're tending to do is to have very sophisticated means of obtaining simple solutions. We have computer programs looking at the percentage of critical damping on all the possible modes of misbehavior of a beam axle. This type of thing wasn't even thought of some time ago. As for independent suspension, it's incredibly easy to make that work dreadfully badly too. There's a lot to be said for having a bar between the wheels; it keeps them the right way up!\n\nKarl: As for front-wheel drive, isn't that basically a feature for family cars?\n\nKing: I don't think it's a sensible feature in a sports car that's going to be bought by a genuine sports-car buyer, because to me a lot of amusement in really driving a motorcar, particularly on slippery surface, is controlling the car with the throttle, and that's one thing you can't do on a front-wheel-drive car. You lose an awful lot of the fun of driving when you get rid of that. I like to control one end of the car with the right-hand pedal and the other end with the steering wheel!\n\nKarl: Doesn't fashion play a role there also? For example, isn't there pressure to make a mid-engined sports car just because it's the current style?\n\nKing: I think it's one of the factors, but I don't like doing things because they're in fashion. I'm a bit bloody-minded about that, really. I'd rather do a thing for genuine reasons and let the fashion follow on than do it because of the fashion. If you do a thing because it's fashionable you're always automatically behind the fashion!\n\nClearly, Charles Spencer King was our kind of auto engineer.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nSteaming with Bill Lear\n\n\"To Karl Ludvigsen - a writer's writer who understands engineering too - thank God! With my very kindest regards, Bill Lear 8/16/71.\"\n\nThat's the treasured inscription inside my copy of Victor Boesen's lively biography of William Powell Lear. Its title was They Said It Couldn't Be Done, which summed up as well as anyone could the story of Lear's life. It applied to his autopilot, to his eight-track stereo player and, most definitively, to his dream of creating an affordable small jet airplane. \"Learjet\" became the generic term for a business jet.\n\nI came into Bill's life late in 1970 at the invitation of friend Bill Moore, a super-talented creative artist who had come to Lear's headquarters city of Reno, Nevada to work for Autoweek. Moore joined the Lear operation at the former Stead Air Force Base outside Reno to become its publicity powerhouse, churning out presentations, flyers and promotional material and serving as PR man to the prolific Lear.\n\nWhen I met him Bill was 68 years old and embarked on the biggest project of his life - creation of a new pollution-free prime mover responding to America's worries about the smog monster. I wrote several articles for Motor Trend and Signature giving the inside story of his quest. As well the two Bills commissioned me to write a company booklet about the steam-power system Lear was developing.\n\nBill and his vivacious wife Moya made me feel at home in their riverside residence at Verdi (pronounced verd-eye) which was always teeming with friends and family members. Live-in couple Gunnar and Gertrude took care of the amenities with quiet competence, though Lear oversaw his own chili recipe using neck meat with pinto beans and took over behind the counter to grill burgers for the multitudes.\n\nThough avuncular in looks with his stocky build and thick glasses, Lear hadn't lost the sense of fun that caused him to name one of his daughters Shanda. I joined the family for a trip to see the movie Cabaret, after which Bill regaled us with his experiences in the Berlin of the 1920s over dinner at his favorite Chinese restaurant.\n\nInevitably crackpots were attracted by the scent of Lear riches at Stead. One caller told his secretary he was ringing from 300 million miles out in space. \"I hope it's not collect,\" joked Lear. Another said he had a jet engine capable of unlimited power. \"It developed 100 horsepower,\" Bill said, \" and needed a 600-horsepower engine to start it.\"\n\nOnly months before my first visit to Stead, Lear had finally settled on the best expander for his steam system. It was built by a small company in a suburb of Denver that had spun off from Sundstrand, where its founders had been working on steam systems. Bob Barber of Barber-Nichols Engineering created a turbine to take energy from the steam.\n\nBarber-Nichols built a single-stage axial-flow turbine derived from a design used in a World War 2 torpedo motor. Only 5.4 inches in diameter, its single-stage turbine wheel drove a three-stage reduction gearbox. Although initially expected to rev to 46,000 rpm, the turbine wheel was successfully tested for safety at its maximum possible speed of 93,000 rpm.\n\nBill's team built steam power units for a Chevrolet Monte Carlo - not a success - and for a rapid-transit bus that entered municipal service in San Francisco. In 1972 it covered a total of 3,900 miles with a minimum of problems. \"It ran the steep hill routes,\" recalled a Lear associate, \"and was often overloaded because everyone wanted a ride.\"\n\n\"Underscoring its relatively trouble-free time in San Francisco,\" said the official report, \"the steam bus was driven from San Francisco to Reno under its own power on August 31 and September 1, traveling 230 miles over the Sierra Nevada without major problems.\" Others who drove it at Stead included yours truly, a memorable experience with what Bill Lear rightly enough called \"the first new heat engine that's been designed in 40 years.\"\n\nThese promising results hit the buffers when the nation's preoccupations changed from smog to soaring fuel prices. The prototype Lear system's thirst was high. Later, California engineer Jim Crank obtained a spare Lear-bus 240-horsepower turbine and married it with his own boiler to build a car to tackle the speed record for a steamer of 127.659 mph set at Daytona by Fred Marriott in a Stanley in 1906.\n\nTurbine-maker Bob Barber took over the project. In 1985 he personally recorded an average of 146.607 mph at Bonneville. It didn't go into the international record books, however, because his time wasn't officially observed. Thus both speeds were in the sights of an ambitious steam-record-car project launched in Britain early in the 21st century. It too used a turbine expander, a two-stage unit capable of 360 to 400 bhp. At Edwards Air Force Base in August of 2009 the British car set a new official record at 139.843 mph with runs of 136 and 151 mph in two directions.\n\nIt was this achievement that started me reminiscing about Bill Lear, because I'm a member of the technical subcommittee that decided it was worthy of receiving the Royal Automobile Club's Simms Medal, \"awarded to recognize a genuine contribution to motoring innovation by individuals or small companies that also exemplify the spirit of adventure.\" We met in June to present the medal to members of the team, whose achievement certainly meets those criteria.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nTiny Tornadoes from Turin\n\nIn my Abarth file is a treasured letter from that company dated February 6, 1959. It reads as follows:\n\n\"We have just finished reading your fascinating article under the above title [as above], which appears in the February 1959 issue of Sports Cars Illustrated.\n\n\"We are sure the story you have written together with the selection of photographs will arouse still greater interest in our cars in the States.\n\n\"Please accept our warmest congratulations on the superb objective reporting that goes all through the six pages devoted to our cars.\"\n\nThe story in question was the result of a visit that Jesse Alexander and I paid to Abarth in Turin in the late Autumn of 1958. Though the company had just completed a new works on Turin's outskirts, its cars were still being produced at the 1949 factory which I described as follows:\n\n\"Hidden on a dusty back street at Via Trecate 10, the original Abarth works looks tiny from the outside but unwinds in chamber after shop devoted to the dissection and creation of Fiat engines and Abarth cars. Bare frames and engines from Fiat are received at the rear, next to the garages housing completed plastic-wrapped Zagato 750 coupes. In a screened corner of the main room within, humble 600 engines are converted to storming 750s at the rate of three a day.\n\n\"All work is done to the accompaniment of a muffled snarl from the low test house, where completed 750s are first motored on a dyno stand and then broken in and checked for over four hours. Another small stand is available for experimental work while a brand-new spacious dyno facility has just been added to cope with Abarth's latest twin-cam projects as well as with extensive testing of muffler systems - a development stage usually performed on the Autostrada in the past.\"\n\nJesse and I were received and shown around by Renzo Avidano, Abarth's amiable and able chief of staff. I didn't meet Carlo himself. By all accounts he was a demanding martinet both in the factory and at the track. \"If there's anything he hates,\" driver Hans Herrmann said of Abarth, \"it's dawdling, disorder and dirt. The factory halls are almost as clean as a pharmacy. He takes care that his cars go to the start sparkling.\"\n\nAppearances were indeed important to Abarth, whose cars always had a distinct flair. Though Italy's coachbuilders contributed a lot, Carlo himself had the last word on their workings. In fact he was so demanding that some hesitated to work with him, Rocco Motto saying, \"A very rough diamond, he was always shouting.\" Nevertheless Motto was persuaded to build the bodies for the series of Carrera GTLs made for Porsche by Abarth for the 1962 season.\n\nBorn in Vienna in 1908 of Italian parents, Karl Abarth became Carlo when, after World War II, he committed himself fully to life in Italy. \"I'll live the second phase of my adventurous existence as an Italian,\" he said. The first phase had indeed been adventurous with a successful career in racing and designing motorcycles, including the innovation of a sidecar that banked with the bike. After the war he became involved with Turin's Cisitalia, some of whose sports-racers he acquired when he set up Abarth & Co. in 1949.\n\nAbarth exploited a novel muffler that engineer Giovanni Savonuzzi had created at Cisitalia. Impressed by the effectiveness of the silencer on an American pistol, Savonuzzi dismantled it and found a fine netting of wire mesh surrounding the barrel. Designing a straight-through muffler on similar lines, the engineer discovered much improved performance. Similar mufflers became Abarth's cash cows.\n\nA new book by Anneliese Abarth, his companion from the 1960s to his death in 1979, reminded me that Abarth's loyalty to Fiats as the basis for most of his competition cars was no accident. Abarth had a contract with Fiat that delivered a financial bonus for every victory by a Fiat-Abarth. A crafty observer of racing classes, he took care to create cars that could deliver those successes in the hands of the many private owners who were the backbone of the Abarth racing effort.\n\nWhen the formal contract ran out, Anneliese tell us, Fiat's Umberto Agnelli promised an informal continuation of the deal, providing essential support for the Squadra Abarth. In the meantime Carlo Abarth had placed high hopes in a Swiss racer, Peter Schetty, whom he was grooming to be his successor at Abarth & Co. He was deeply disappointed when Schetty bolted to Ferrari. Abarth flirted with the idea of approaching Porsche, but finally sold out to Fiat in 1971.\n\nWhen rally-mad Fiat ignored Abarth's sports-racers, the founder decided to deny the company that part of his empire. \"Not forgetting the cold water Fiat had poured on his efforts,\" said Anneliese, Abarth \"decided that not one single screw from the racing department should fall into their hands.\" He made a deal with Enzo Osella, a leading Abarth racer, to take over the team.\n\n\"During the summer holidays,\" Anneleise continued, \"all the racing cars and their spares, raw materials, drawings and whatever else of use was in the racing department made its way piece by piece in private vehicles to Osella.\" When Fiat installed its rally cars in September it found not a trace of the racing Abarths that had done so much for its reputation.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nThat Taiwanese Feeling\n\nIf you're web-enabled I suggest that you have a look at www.luxgen-motor.com.tw. You'll see an extremely impressive big SUV and on another page an MPV, both products of Luxgen, a \"premium automotive brand\" whose name stands for \"Luxury\" and \"Genius\". Modesty isn't their strong suit.\n\nNot only that, I've just received a news release from Luxgen claiming \"a resounding sales success through innovative automobile and IT integration.\" With just one model, it said, in its home market Luxgen outsold the entire Hyundai range early in 2010! That is indeed pretty darned impressive. And what was that home market? None other than Taiwan, Republic of China.\n\nWhen I saw this news I realized that only one company could be behind this website and announcement. Indeed, it is none other than my old friend, the Yue Loong Motor Co., Ltd. of Taipei, Taiwan. Yue Loong was the 1953 creation of industrial pioneer Tjing-Ling Yen. Born of a wealthy family in Shanghai, Yen went to Germany to train as an engineer. When the communists took power in China in the 1940s, he and his wife Vivian Wu Yen left the mainland for Taiwan, the last bastion of republican China.\n\nSpotting and seizing opportunities on the underdeveloped 13,885-square-mile island, Yen set up a textile factory in 1951 and in September of 1953 incorporated Yue Loong Motors. In 1956 he unveiled a home-brewed Jeep-like vehicle and in 1957 signed a technical-cooperation agreement with Nissan. Yen established another auto company, China Motor, in 1965 and affiliated it with Mitsubishi in 1970. Such was his rapid expansion that Yen was soon being called \"the Henry Ford of Taiwan\".\n\nAlthough he began with technology licensed from Japan, Tjing-Ling Yen had a long-term goal of creating indigenous product lines designed and engineered at his facilities in Taiwan. He sent his engineers abroad to absorb design and production know-how with this end in view. In 1976, however, he was disabled by a head injury. Although he remained the titular head of his enterprises, Yen relinquished decision-making power to his wife Vivian. When her husband died in 1981, at the age of 68 she became CEO of Yue Loong.\n\nVivian Yen accepted as her divine mission the realization of her husband's dream of a domestic model that would also be exported. \"My husband put the country on wheels,\" she said. \"Now I'm putting the country on my own wheels and rolling them to other countries.\" She approved the spending of some $50 million on Yue Loong's R&D facilities and another $40 million on the first model to bear her company's brand, the Yue Loong Feeling 101. The Korean ideogram of its name translated as \"Flying Antelope\".\n\nAlthough it used some Stanza and Sentra parts as well as Nissan engines the medium-sized Feeling was a rakish-looking four-door with such bells and whistles as a heads-up display and a control console suspended from the roof. Launched in 1986, the Feeling had an enthusiastic reception at home and was taken up in some export markets including the Netherlands.\n\nThis was only the beginning for Madame Yen. She and her team envisioned a smaller high-volume model that would be sold both at home and abroad, designed from the ground up by her team with the help of a European partner for the engine. This was Project YL-94, as I learned when I visited Taipei and Yue Loong's facilities in the last days of February 1989. I saw Feelings being produced in its newest factory, built down a slope as a series of buildings through which cars and components moved down from one assembly area to the next.\n\nThrough an agent, Yue Loong had chosen Ludvigsen Associates to forecast market demand for its YL-94 outside Taiwan, to identify and assess its key competitors and to recommend the best configuration for the car to cope with the environment that we forecast for 1994, when the new model would be launched. This was heady stuff for our consulting team, just the stage at which we liked to get involved with a project. Often we were only approached when it was much too late to be of any help.\n\nWe had developed and successfully implemented a graphic positioning technique that had price on its vertical axis and image on the horizontal axis, ranging from \"sporty\" on the left to \"family\" on the right. After we conducted the necessary research I went back to Taipei at the end of May, 1989 to present our findings. Later, however, we learned that Madame Yen had been disabused of her ambition. In 1985 she had sold a quarter of the car company to Nissan, with which she decided to partner for the time being. The YL-94 was an immediate casualty.\n\nRestyled the Yulon Group, my Taiwanese friends later strengthened their links with Nissan and added GM to their partnerships. But their founding of the Luxgen marque in 2008 shows that they haven't lost their ambition to expand both domestically and globally. The Luxgen concept is to marry Taiwan's expertise in high-end electronics with passenger cars, for example using cameras round the car to provide \"360-degree surround imaging.\"\n\nEarly in 2009, in cooperation with China's Geely, Yulon introduced another brand, Tobe, at the low end of the market. With the Luxgen that's pretty good going for an auto maker that's one of the world's most obscure-for now.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nTwo Liters and Loving It\n\nBig news, folks! I've just bought another car with a two-liter engine!\n\nWell, it's hardly a surprise. It's been an axiom of mine for many years that two liters-122 cubic inches-is just the right size for an automobile engine.\n\nIt all began in the mid-1950s with my second car, a Triumph TR2. Crude though it was in many ways, with its dash leatherette peeling away, this Triumph was hugely enjoyable. Its 90 horses at 4,800 rpm were plenty for a light and agile sports car. It had torque too, enough to finish off the gears in my TR2's rear axle.\n\nMy next two-liter car was an exotic piece of kit, a Frazer Nash Mille Miglia. I had always loved the superb lines of this sports car, said to have inspired the look of the MGA. This one had been used as a racing car by American Airlines flight engineer Bill Wonder, who had bought a 200S Maserati to replace it. Bill accepted an even swap of my Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider, which he reckoned would be an easier car to sell.\n\nFrazer Nash used Bristol's two-liter sixes, which were derived from the engine of the pre-war BMW 328. In spite of its long stroke and elaborate pushrod valve gear this was a potent engine, fed by three downdraft Solex carburetors. And it had the greatest sound! There's nothing like an in-like six to make a beautiful noise, as early Jaguar enthusiasts know, and this Frazer Nash was a perfect example. I didn't have it very long because it was my daily driver, not at all suitable when the US Army sent me to Signal Corps School at Fort Monmouth near Red Bank, New Jersey.\n\nThe Bristol/Frazer Nash six featured in Cooper chassis during the two-liter years of Formula 2, which was promoted to the World Drivers' Championship in 1952 and '53 when the then-current Formula 1 fell out of favor. Major rivals in that era were Ferrari, whose Alberto Ascari cleaned up with a four-cylinder Type 500 F2, and Maserati with its twin-cam A6GCM six, valiantly raced by fellow Argentineans Juan Fangio and Froilan Gonzalez.\n\nStarting in 1952 Maserati began building sports-racing cars powered by a detuned version of its Formula 2 six. That year a handful of transitional models were made and sold to racers, including Holland's Fritz Koster. I saw the Koster car race and win at Thompson in Connecticut, so when it was advertised for sale in 1964 I moved quickly to acquire it. When the seller reported that \"it goes like a raped ape\" I knew this was the car I remembered so well.\n\nThis was the quintessence of the high-revving straight six, sounding off with a melodic snarl, and potent enough with its two liters to be a serious drive. Sitting in the same seat that had carried Juan Fangio during a test in Holland, I competed with it in Vintage Sports Car Club of America races in the mid-1960s. We were pretty much the Club's quickest car/driver combination at the time.\n\nMy next two-liter car was the Escort RS 2000 that was my first company car at Ford of Europe in 1980. This had Ford's \"Pinto\" overhead-cam four, tuned to 110 bhp. My Ford colleagues thought that this engine was a bit too much for the Escort's unsophisticated chassis, but I found the car delightful, oversteering like mad under power-just the way I like it. I drove the RS 2000 all over Britain and enjoyed every mile.\n\nPost-Ford, my first two-liter road car was a Mazda Xedos 6. You're excused if this doesn't ring a bell because this suave sedan, much like a mini-Jaguar, wasn't sold in the Big PX. If the launch of Mazda's upscale Amati range had gone ahead it might have been, but in the event it was sold only in Europe and Japan.\n\nPowering the Xedos 6 was a magnificent four-cam V6, the same engine used in 2.5-liter form in the Mazda MX-6 and the Ford Probe but sized at 2.0 liters. It's a sweetheart, revving easily to 7,000 and as smooth as the proverbial baby's bottom. It perfectly complements the Xedos 6, which is the car that Ford should have used instead of the Mondeo as the basis for the X-Type Jaguar.\n\nWith the Mazda passing 95,000 miles, however, it was time to look for a replacement. For someone in my position it wasn't easy to settle on the right choice. After all, I'm supposed to know something about cars! For some time, however, I've been attracted by the latest Audi TT. In my eyes this is a stunning piece of industrial design as applied to an automobile. The ones I've tried have gone pretty well too.\n\nSo yesterday, as I write this, I picked up an Audi TT Coupe 2.0T FSI-to spell out its complete designation-in Dolphin Grey Metallic with red seating and trim. I went for the S-Tronic transmission on the grounds that I no longer need to practice shifting in my daily driver.\n\nSo here I am with another two-liter engine, turbocharged this time to 200 horsepower-more than double the power of my TR2 of half a century ago. I can understand the appeal of lots of lazy cubic inches, but for me 122 are enough. Next time I may even downsize!\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nContinental Bites the Dust\n\nUnless an execution is involved, it's not often that you have advance warning of a death. It usually comes as an unwelcome shock. But I've just heard that a treasured old friend will be leaving this world during 2010, at the ripe old age of 86. I refer to GM's assembly plant in Antwerp, Belgium, known for most of its life as GM Continental.\n\nI first became acquainted with Continental in the mid-1960s when I was press officer for GM Overseas Operations in New York. I liaised productively with my counterpart in Antwerp, Paul Stefens, who'd been working there since 1961. GM Continental was an important base for our press activities because it covered the markets of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, homes to many important and influential journals and journalists. Europe's \"Car of the Year\" program was born at Dutch magazine Auto Visie, for example.\n\nGM Continental spearheaded of the American invasion of Europe that had the Old World's auto makers quaking in their boots. Founded in 1924, it was set up to circumvent tariffs on built-up vehicles by assembling them locally from kits of imported parts. Its name showed how important it was to the sales of GM's American cars on the Continent. Its works in central Antwerp assembled its first Chevrolet on April 2, 1925.\n\n\"General Motors opened nineteen assembly facilities in fifteen overseas countries between 1923 and 1928,\" said its chairman Frederic Donner in 1967. \"By 1929, over 70 percent of the GM cars and trucks exported from North America were shipped as parts and components for assembly overseas.\" Even after GM bought Vauxhall (1925) and Opel (1929), GM Continental also assembled those makes locally to take advantage of the lower tariffs on imported parts.\n\nLeaving GM Overseas Operations in 1967, I chose a career as a free-lance journalist and part-time consultant. In the latter capacity I heard from Bryan McGowan, who was now in Antwerp. A friend as well as former GMOO colleague, Bryan thought of me when his boss, the creative and charismatic Bob Price, wanted to investigate some new ideas. In February of 1971 I took advantage of a trip to Amsterdam for a 'Car of the Year' prizegiving to make a visit to Antwerp to see what was up.\n\nPrice had several issues on his agenda. One was the rejection of GM's Vauxhall cars by that marque's dealers in the Benelux area. With Vauxhall's quality at a nadir, dealers were simply refusing deliveries and, even worse, defecting to the many Japanese marques that were eagerly prospecting for outlets. How was this to be countered?\n\nTypically Bob Price took a gung-ho approach. He looked to GM South Africa, where the local assembler had created a new marque, the \"GM Ranger\", by retrimming Opel Rekord models with a distinctive four-headlamp grille. Like his counterparts at GM's Swiss assembly plant, faced with the same problem, Price imported the necessary parts from Africa and began assembling and selling the GM Ranger through his beleaguered Vauxhall dealers.\n\nIn a major study for GM Continental I assessed the pros and cons of the Ranger project and made recommendations for future actions to strengthen the marque. Desiring another model to complete his Ranger range, Price was looking at the Torana, a new compact that GM's sister Holden in Australia had just launched. We had a Torana to drive and assess. I concluded that \"the good looks of the Torana, with its handsome interior, would make it a highly saleable car in Europe.\" Especially over the Belgian cobbles, however, its ride needed work.\n\nLooking ahead, Bob Price also felt that GM needed an even smaller range of cars in Europe. He was saw the gap that Fiat's 127 and Ford's Fiesta would soon fill. He commissioned me to carry out a study of \"An Ideal GM Small Car\". In doing it I was asked to keep an eye on the opportunity offered by Daf, just over the border in Holland, still making its automatic-transmission small cars. Price was hoping that GM could be persuaded to acquire Daf and make it the production base for a European small-car range.\n\nThe product problems that Bob Price was facing were soon solved by GM's merging of its Vauxhall and Opel product lines, basing the British cars on German engineering. In fact Price soon found himself promoted to run Vauxhall, which delighted its dealers with the Opel-based Cavalier of 1975. By then, however, GM had withdrawn Vauxhalls from the continental markets.\n\nIn 2009 GM Continental, which once assembled 400,000 cars a year, made less than 90,000. The tariff barriers that once supported it had long been erased by the European Union. Though it had great strengths, in its location close to a busy port and its access to a first-class workforce, these weren't enough to sustain the surviving Plant 2. Plant 1 had already been shuttered at the end of the 1980s.\n\nThe Antwerp operation had quite a history, Paul Stefens reminded me. \"The old Albert Dock plant was bombed during the war by Flying Fortresses led by Clark Gable,\" he said. \"It was a complete wreck afterward.\" It was amazingly versatile, assembling big American cars next to small Europeans down the same line. But this wasn't enough to keep GM Continental alive. It will be \"wound down\", said GM, \"in the course of 2010.\" Only the good memories will remain.\n\n- Karl Ludvigsen\n\nLittle Wheel at Fuller\n\nIn 1922 the Fuller Manufacturing Company completed a handsome new pair of four-story factory buildings at the junction of Pitcher and Prouty Streets on the northern periphery of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Located exactly equidistant between Detroit and Chicago by road or rail, Kalamazoo was well placed to serve the motor industry.\n\nEnjoying the backing of local worthies, the Fuller family had been in business in this bucolic Western Michigan city since 1888. By 1903 the Fuller brothers were producing the Michigan automobile. They stopped making cars in 1908, concentrating instead on producing vehicle transmissions.\n\nThis decision by the Fullers was in line with trends in the industry, which at the time saw many makers entering the fast-growing market by buying major components from suppliers to produce a vehicle which they assembled rather than manufactured themselves. Concentrating on this through World War I, they emerged with a strong reputation for their heavier-duty gearboxes. In 1923 Fuller phased out passenger-car units to concentrate on transmissions for trucks.\n\nIn 1928 a 25-year-old engineer at Cleveland truck maker White Motor decided to stake his fortunes to Fuller, which had just been acquired by Chicago's Unit Corporation. Elliot \"Lud\" Ludvigsen started as a sales engineer, first in Milwaukee with Unit Drop Forge and then in Kalamazoo with Fuller, where he was named sales manager in 1930. By 1948 Lud Ludvigsen had risen to the presidency of the Fuller Manufacturing Company.\n\nThis was the man whose son - namely me - went down to the plant with him on Saturdays when Lud wanted some quiet time to catch up in his office. I'd be looking through the SAE Journal and Automotive Industries, industry bibles which helped hook me on cars. We'd tour the plant, which in my earliest visits still had huge overhead shafts and pulleys driving the machine tools through long belts. It was an exciting place with its own drop-forging presses and foundry. I dug through bins of scrap to find interesting pieces to take home.\n\nBetween my third and fourth years of high school I worked at Fuller during the summer. Under the patient Gil Hulme I was given a board in the drafting office, its big windows facing north from the main building. My main activity was inking drawings. The engineers would complete their component and assembly drawings in pencil, but for a permanent record Fuller need ink drawings on vellum. I was good enough at this to make myself useful in this capacity.\n\nGil welcomed me back in the summer of 1952, in the hiatus between my graduation and starting at MIT in the autumn. This was an exciting time at Fuller. It was offering new-fangled torque converters for some applications. Working with his chief engineer Tom Backus, my father was encouraging the creation of a new kind of heavy-truck transmission which he named the RoadRanger.\n\nTo get the many forward speeds that a heavy truck needed, it was usual at the time to have an auxiliary two-speed box, called a \"splitter\", behind the main transmission. The driver would use the splitter to tease added ratios between the ones in his main gearbox, a feat that required great dexterity in manipulating two levers going up and down the gears. Drivers were proud of their ability to master this.\n\nThe RoadRanger did away with all that. It had an auxiliary two-speed box, but with a huge ratio spread that was larger than the full ratio range of the main transmission. Starting up, with the auxiliary in low range, the driver went up through, say, five ratios in his main box. Then with a switch on the shift lever he preselected an upshift of the rear box, which occurred automatically when he went through neutral and back to \"first gear\", which was now sixth, and so on upward. He reversed the process shifting down.\n\nThis required some gizmos of the kind distrusted by truck operators. The shift in the auxiliary box was made by a microswitch triggering a solenoid valve, which controlled a cylinder - could be either vacuum or compressed air - that made the shift. Both auxiliary ratios were synchronized by multiple-disc clutches. Fuller had experimented with Porsche's ring-type synchromesh for this job, but it didn't have the blocking function that this application needed.\n\nThe RoadRanger concept revolutionized big-truck driving. When I came back to Fuller in the summer of 1954 we were working on new smaller versions of the RoadRanger. Having learned a bit about machine-tool operation at MIT, I spent part of the summer in the experimental workshop, making parts for the new RoadRanger.\n\nMilling the slots in the main gears of the auxiliary gearbox that took the synchromesh discs, I didn't index them properly. Checking with my boss, we decided that we could salvage the pieces by cutting fresh slots in the remaining metal, leaving the earlier ones in place. Wouldn'"
