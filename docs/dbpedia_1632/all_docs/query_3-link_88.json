        "text": "Clark and Lotus won the Championship in 1965, with six Championship race victories, but finished well down both points tables in 1966. In the following year Clark won the Tasman Championship with a Climax-engined 33. Once the 49 with the DFV engine arrived in 1967 there wasHJtle life in the 33s, even for independents, and the cars disappeared from main-line racing very soon after the last Team LotllS race:with them, at Monaco in 1967.\n\nDrivers (GPs): Peter Arundell,Jim Clark, Walt Hansgen, Paul Hawkins, Graham Hill, Pedro F-odriguez, Giacomo Russo, Moises Solana, Mike Spence.\n\n35 F3 was more popular in 1965 but there were few customers for the monocoque 35, which was in a line of evolution from the 27 and 32 and also doubled as an F2 car. Chassis and suspension were standardized, and the 35 would accept a wide range of engines and gearboxes (Cosworth MAE or Holbay engines were the common F3 types, Cosworth SAE or BRM units in F2, with Hewland four-, five- or six- speed 'boxes). In either guise it was a slim car, and looked the part. In 1965 Ron Harris ran' cars in both classes; Clark won the British and French F2 Championships for this team, but in F3 the only bright moment came when Revson won at Monaco.\n\n39 An F1 design for the Coventry Climax FWMV flat sixteen, which was never raced as the FWMV proved equal to '1965\n\nchallenges - as Clark's achievements with the 33 showed. The\n\nchassis of the 39 was adapted for a 2.5-litre Climax FPF (a first Lotus design assignment for Len Terry's successor, Maurice Phillippe). Clark drove the 39 in the 1966 Tasman series, without 'great success.-XC\n\n41 This F3 car marked a determined fight back into this market in 1966. In it Lotus reverted to a space frame, although the tubes were stiffened with sheet metal diaphragms (foot box, dashboard, rear of cockpit, gearbox area) and undertray. The engine (a Cosworth MAE) was inclined at 30 degrees and like the gearbox was mounted to contribute to rigidity. The unusually wide track almost drew attention to the slim body - in spite of the tubular structure, the 41 had less frontal area than the 35.\n\nA quasi-works team was run by Charles Lucas, WhOSE drivers Courage\" and Pike won half a dozen races, deritin~ Brabham superiority. But above all, this was a customer car; ar, initial batch of 34 was laid down (price £2475 assembled!) and final production reached 61. The 41B was an F2 version with an FV A engine, and the number was also applied to the Formula B version in 1967. That year also saw the 41C F3 car with revised suspension, but the sales response was poor as. the 41s had gained a reputation for fragility. The '41X' was a one-off derivative with a pronounced wedge body, which Gold Leaf Team Lotus driver John Miles used to score several victories in 1968, when it was modified and became the 55.\n\n43 For an interim 3-litre F1 engine Chapman had to turn to the over-complex and heavy BRM H-16, which was used in a pair of 43s. It was a stressed member\" carrying the rear suspension, and it was mounted to a bulkhead behind the cockpit. The short monocoque followed lines laid down in the 38 USAC car. A 43 first appeared in practice for the 1966 Belgian GP, and that car was the only 43 to finish a race, when Jim Clark won the 1966 American GP. A second was completed (a pair started in only one GP, in South Africa in 1967), then the 43s were soldfor independent conversions to F5000.\n\nDrivers: Peter Arundell, Jim Clark, Graham Hill.\n\n44 The F2 car for 1966, based on the monocoque of the 35 with the wi,de suspension of the 41, and with Cosworth engines that were no match for Brabham's Honda units. Three were used by Ron Harris' team, for which Clark and Arundell were in distant third and tenth places on the Championship table; the third car was driven by several drivers.\n\n48 A new car for the new 1.6-litre F2, although it was first used in the Australian GP. It had a full monocoque, with a tubular sub frame for the Cosworth FV A engine. In 1967 Clark won three races, against another Brabham tide, but his team mate Graham Hill could do no better than two second places.\n\nThe cars were brought out again in 1968, and because there were no F1 cars available at the time of the presentation one of the 48s was the single-seater featured at the announcement of Gold Leaf Team Lotus. Clark, sadly, was driving a GLTL 48 when he was killed in a high-speed crash at Hockenheim.\n\n49 This was a landmark car. After the uncertain first year of 3­litre Grand Prix racing it set a true standard. It was laid out for the even more astonishing Cosworth-Ford DFV engine - Colin Chapman was instrumental in bringing together Keith Duckworth and Ford's Harley Copp and Walter Hayes, and they committed Ford to back the design and development of the DFV. It was to be exclusive to Lotus for the 1967 season, and the 49 was designed to complement it.\n\nIt was a straightforward car, with timeless lines in its first form. The cross-section of its monocoque was determined by the cross-section of the 90-degree V-8 (85.7 x 64.8mm, 2993cc), and this was bolted to the bulkhead behind the cockpit and served a load-bearing role. The rear suspension sub frame was bolted to the block and cylinder heads, with braking loads fed forward into the monocoque through twin radius arms. A dozen 49s carried chassis numbers, although three were rebuilds and one was an exhibition car and never raced. A 2.5-litre Cosworth DFW-engined version (49T) was run in Tasman races. The .49B of 1968 had a longer wheelbase, modifications in areas such as the rear sub frame, wider wheels and a semi-wedge body. Strutted 'wings' were carried from the French GP of that year, until both GLTL 49s crashed heavily as a result of rear aerofoil failures on the bumpy Barcelona circuit in 1969, when such devices were precipitately banned.\n\nThe 49 was driven by champions - Jimmy Clark won his 25th and' last Grand Prix victory in one, Emerson Fittipaldi drove his first F1 race for Lotus in one and Graham Hill won his second World Championship with 49s. It was in the front line for four years, at the centre ()f the great wings controversy, central to the introduction of sponsorship to Grand Prix racing, driven to a debut race victory by Clark in Holland in 1967 and the last of its twelve Championship race victories was scored by Rindt at Monaco in 1970. A 49 was the last private owner car to win.a Grand Prix, when Jo Siffert won in Ro Walker's 49n at Brands Hatch in 1968. The Lotus 49 was one of the great Grand Prix cars.\n\nDrivers: Mario Andretti, Richard Attwood, Giancarlo Baghetti, Jo Bonnier, Bill Brack, Dave Charlton, Jim Clark, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, Graham Hill, Pete LQvely, Jackie Oliver, Jochen Rindt, JO Siffert, Moises Solana, Tony Trimmer, Eppie Weitzes.\n\n55 The '41X' F3 car, revised and run as a GLTL entry in 1968.\n\n56B The spare 56 from the 1968 USAC programme had a Pratt & Whitney gas turbine equivalent to a 3-litre piston engine installed in 1970, and it was raced in some F1 events in 1971. It was a four -wheel drive car, which suffered a variety of niggling setbacks, as well as throttle lag. Its first race was the Race of Champions, and in the Silverstone International TrQphy, on a more suitable circuit, it showed promise. Its best GP result was eighth in Italy, driven by Fittipaldi and run in black and gold colours, and its active career' ended when Fittipaldi finished second in a non-Championship race at Hockenheim.\n\nDrivers: Emerson Fittipaldi, Dave Walker, Reine Wisell.\n\n57 An F2 car with de Dion suspension that was tested in 1968 but never raced.\n\n69 This number was used for single seaters built for four categories, F2, F3, Formula B/Atlantic and Formula Ford. Although there were close outward similarities, the specifications were not similar - the F3 car inherited the 59 square tube frame, while because of new bag tank regulations the F2 car had a monocoque centre section with tubular frames front and rear (59 to 69 'conversion' was possible). Various Ford-based engines were seen in the F3 cars during the final I-litre F3 season (1970), while under the 1.6-litre regulations the very successful GLTL cars used Ford-based Novamotor units. In F2 Cosworth FVAs were used.\n\nThe 69 became popular in F3, and in 1971 Dave Walker was clearly the top driver - from 32 starts the single-car GL TL team scored 25 victories. That team did not contest F2 races, and in 1970 Rindt formed his own team with Bernie Ecclestone - in effect out of the Winkleman team - and he won four of the ten races he started. In the final year of 1.6-litre F2 racing, Emerson Fittipaldi won three European Trophy races in a Team Bardahl 69. With the 70, an unsuccessful Formula N 5000 car, these were the last Lotus production racing cars, and Lotus Racing Limited, which took the place of Lotus Components for 1971, ceased operations after a very brief life.\n\n72 This successor to the 49 was also destined to serve longer than envisaged in the Grand Prix front line, although Chapman in no way saw this as a short - term car. He sought aqvantages over other teams using DFV engines land the cons::ept for Phillippe to turn into metal and fibreglass was radical - a refined wedge with radiators amidships and ultra low to enhance aerodynamic efficiency, with torsion bar rising rate suspension, and inboard brakes. Suspension loads were light and the tyres were well away from brake heat, so soft tyres could be used with grip advantages (problems did arise when Lotus switched from Firestone to Goodyear, and tyres that were not designed with the 72 in mind had to be used ).\n\nThe suspension was to be modified very early in the 72's career, when it looked as if the stunning car that had been drive, Dave Charlton ran one of the 1970 cars from 1972 (in the colours of another Cigarette company!) and two more went to South Africa. Odd 72s lingered on in minor British events in the late 1970s.\n\nFrom 1972 the cars were run as John Player Specials, in black and gold livery. The 72 was first raced in Spain in 1970, and by the early summer was fully raceworthy - Rindt won the Dutch, French, British and German GPs in succession. Then in practice at Monza he was fatally injured in an accident that started when the right front brakeshaft failed. By finishing first and third in 72s in the US Grand Prix, Fittipaldi and Wisell ensured that Rindt's tally of points was not equalled and he thus became the sport's first posthumous champion.\n\nDrivers (GPS): Dave Charlton,jim Crawford, Paddy Driver, Emerson Fittipaldi, Brian Henton, Graham. Hill, Jacky Icla, Eddie'l(eijan, John Miles, Ronnie Peterson, Jochen Rindt, Ian Scheckter, Tim Schenken, Tony Trimmer, Jack Tunmer, Dave Walker, John Watson, Reine Wisell.\n\n73 This was an F3 car which according to the publicists was to complement the 72, a pair being run inJPTL black and gold colours. It had a monocoque centre section, with sub frames mounting the front suspension and the Nova engine/ transmission/rear suspension, side-mounted radiators and inboard brakes. It may have been advanced, but it was altogether too complicated for F3 and that led to lack of progress as the 1972 season wore on. One of the original pair was then used for Novamotor F2 engine tests and a 73B was developed late in 1972, but set aside as Lotus and the sponsors turned away from F3. In 1975 Dr Ehrlich acquired the 73s, running one late that year as an Ehrlich-Lotus.\n\n74 The Texaco Star F2 cars, designed by Ralph Bellamy and using some features from the 72 - torsion bar suspension, inboard front brakes and hip radiators (water on the right, oil on the left). Lotus' 907 light-alloy engine was developed by Novamotor for this cat, to give a claimed 275bhp. Team manager 'Jim Endruweit had the driving services of Emerson Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson. On paper it was a winning combination but on the circuits a flop.\n\nAlthough a CART Lotus was to be built in the mid-1980s it was never raced, so the 74 was the last Lotus single-seater to be raced by a works team/in a category outside F1.\n\n76 Team and sponsor desperately wanted this to be known as the John Player Special, and the idea was an updated and lighter 72. Torsion bar suspension was retained, so were inboard brakes, and there was a novel electronic clutch (once the car started from rest, this could be operated with a gear­lever button). It was, however, raced with a normal clutch and drivers preferred 72s. In mid-summer 1974 the 72 back end was grafted onto a 76 tub, and soon both 76s had 72 backs to make curious hybrids which were raced in late events.\n\nEarly in the year Peterson despaired and left, but Andretti committed himself to Lotus and through the year Nilsson gained in stature with the team. The performance of the 77 steadily improved, and at the end of the year Andretti drove one to victory in the Japanese GP.\n\nDrivers: Mario Andretti, Bob Evans, Gunnar Nilsson, Ronnie Peterson.\n\n78 A most significant Grand Prix car, theJPS MkIII established ground effects as a far-reaching development and put Team Lotus back in the forefront. But for some trivial reasons it would have been back on top. Once again Chapman laid down the principles, Bellamy, Ogilvie, aerodynamicist Peter Wright and others translated them into the car. It had a slim sandwich monocoque with wide side pods containing radiators, a fuel tank each, and the 'inverted wing section', with a skirt at the outer bottom edges extending down to the track to seal in the airflow (the skirt was a row of bristles on the first car, but rigid skirts soon came). The front track was wide, with suspension members interfering with the air flow to the side pods as little as possible. Andretti won four Grands Prix in 1977, Nilsson one. No drivers won as many as Andretti, no team won as many as Lotus, but both Championships eluded the team.\n\nIn 1978 Andretti and Peterson each won a GP before the 79 superseded the 78, but there was a sad footnote to the 78's career. Ronnie Peterson had to go. to the start of the 1979 Italian GP in one, as his 79 had been damaged in the warm-up session, and he was fatally injured in a start-line accident. Independent Hector Rebaque ran a 78 into 1979, and in that year the first 78 appeared in the minor British Fl series.\n\nDrivers: Mario Andretti, Gunnar Nilsson, Ronnie Peterson, Hector Rebaque.\n\n79 More than a refined 78, this was in many eyes the most elegant car of the 3-litre formula. It was an exemplary ground effects car, and it was a Championship car. Its side pods were wholeheartedly devoted to ground effects - there was a radiator in each (water on the right, oil on the left), but there were no fuel tanks in them as a single cell between cockpit and engine sufficed and the rear suspension was kept out of the airflow. In most other areas development was simple and although a Lotus gearbox built by Getrag and incorporating a freewheel was essayed, Lotus reverted to a Hewland FG400 for\n\n~ the main season. The 79 was the car of the year, and it was reliable. Andretti won six GPs in 1978, one of them in a 78; Peterson won two (one in a 78) and was second four times.\n\nDrivers: Mario Andretti, Elio de Angelis, Nigel Mansell.\n\nAn experimental dual-chassis car using an 81 monocoque. Completed in the Autumn of 1980 it was used for tests but never raced.\n\n81 This actually appeared after the 88, and took the team place intended for that car in 1981. It was conventional, using 88 running gear - 88 to 87 (and vice versa) conversions were made in mid-season. A moulded carbon-composite mono­coque was used. Some weight was saved in the second half of the season, and the 87B led directly to the 91.\n\nDrivers in 87s scored 13 points in Lotus' 1981 total of 22, which as the team was in turmoil for much of the year was not at all bad. By the early summer-of that year the Team Lotus cars were black and gold again.\"The two 87Bs were used in the opening GP of 1982.\n\nDrivers: Elio de Angelis, Nigel Mansell.\n\nTraditional Team Lotus pose with a new car - drivers Mansell and de Angelis flank Colin Chapman. The 87 still shows some allegiance to Essex (where the radiator air was exhausted through the sides) but in th~ maind1is is another )PS.\n\n88 This wasrhe controversial 'dual-chassis' concept presented as a racewoi-thy car, entered for races, and rejected by officialdom. It had a main chassis comprising bodywork, carrying side pods and radiators, and aerofoils; within it there was the monocoque, engine and transmission, and suspension. The first chassis was carried on coil spring! damper units attached to the suspension uprights. The idea was to achieve generous ground effects downfoI\"ce,. without the undue stress and strain drivers were having to bear with rock-hard ground effects suspension.\n\n94T Ducarouge worked quickly, using the tub of the 91 as a basis for the 94T, and the first was ready for the British GP. It looked neater, was lighter, had a weight distribution which complemented its Pirelli rubber (coincidentally the tyre company reverted to stiffer tyres), was never a winner, but started Team Lotus back on the road towards winning. In his first race in a 94T, at Silverstone, Mansell finished fourth, and at Brands Hatch at the end of the European season he was third in the GP d'Europe.\n\nThis car was an improvement on Ducarouge's last Lotus, but some of its promise was illusory and some was dissipated the number one driver seemed demotivated for part of the season. At the Belgian GP meeting neither car qualified, and that was a low poin~ first in Lotus Grand Prix racing history. Piquet salvaged something with two fourth placings and two other points-scoring finiShes, while in his last race for the team Nakajima achieved his best result, fourth in Adelaide.\n\nDrivers: Satoru Nakajima, Nelson Piquet"
