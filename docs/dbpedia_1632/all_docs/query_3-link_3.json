        "text": "Originally posted by J Oakley\n\nLotus 18 373 started life as a Team Lotus car and was driven by Surtees, Clark and Ireland. The car originally ran with a Climax FPF until 1963 when Kurt Kunke bought it and lightly converted it into a BKL Borgward. I believe that the car was entered into three races by him but only made it to the Solitude GP (28-07-63) and the Kannonloppet (11-08-63). It retired in both.\n\nKuhnke also acquired two other Lotus 18's. Chassis number 914 and 919 with chassis 919 being a Lotus 18/21 from new. He fitted cars both with Borgward engines. Chassis 919 was the most successful of the three BKL cars in the 1.5 F1 formula with a 100% finishing record. However, it did only enter one race where it came tenth! Most of the time the BKL's either did not start or did not finish.\n\nBKL and BRM engines - I think not.\n\nOriginally posted by J Oakley\n\nHello Ray,\n\nWarwick farm pictures - excellent! I have 373 recorded as doing Ardmore and Christchurch during the 1961 Tasman series but have found confusion regarding the other races. The identities of some of the Lotus Tasman cars seems muddled, so if you can throw any light on them that would be perfect.\n\nOriginally posted by J Oakley\n\nHi Ray,\n\nInteresting comments. I understand that the Tasman Formula was introduced in 1963 (I have two 'Tasman' cars from that period) but I guess that in the UK we use ''Tasman' as a generic term. Certainly in the excellent book, 'Theme Lotus', Doug Nye starts his Tasman record in 1960. I also have some New Zealand literature that does the same. Maybe with the passing of time we have started to include the earlier years as Tasman years. What do you think?\n\nInteresting. The Tasman FORMULA and official championship started in 1964.International race series Aus/NZ started in 1961-I remember keeping my own unofficial 'championship' table.Cars were mostly ex F1 so would be better described as such? Never did see the point of the Tasman Formula. Meant that when F1 went to 3 litres,they had to go to the trouble of making 2.5 litre Cosworth DFVs\n\nOriginally posted by Barry Boor\n\nAs an aside, it was 'written off' by Ernst Maring in Denmark in 1963 but, according to Dong, may have been in Holland in 1978 (when Theme Lotus was written.)\n\nAnyone got any info about this chassis now?\n\nOriginally posted by J Oakley\n\nHello Ray,\n\nWarwick farm pictures - excellent!
