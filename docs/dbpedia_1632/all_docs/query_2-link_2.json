        "text": "Beautiful Peter D’Abbs photograph of Lex Davison’s Aston Martin DBR4/250, chassis #1 3-litre with Austin Miller, Cooper T51 Climax in the background, Phillip Island, 23 October 1960…\n\nLex became famous for his retirements from racing and Dame Nellie Melba type returns to the grid. His 1958 AGP win at Bathurst was the final time he raced the marvellous ex-Ascari/Gaze Ferrari 500/625. He took a break from racing, but heading into 1960 he planned to take a holiday in Europe with his wife Diana, and to acquire a new racer.\n\nHe had watched the ‘Cooperisation’ of Australian racing from the sidelines and decided that a modern incarnation of his (ex-Moss 1954 AGP winning) HWM Jaguar would be competitive with the growing number of mid-engined cars.\n\nLex pitched the idea of a DB4 3.7-litre engine fitted to a DBR4 GP chassis to Aston Martin Racing Manager John Wyer. Wyer assured him the motor wouldn’t readily fit and that the David Brown five-speed transaxle, already marginal, would be pushed beyond its limits.\n\nAfter plenty of argy-bargy Lex did a deal to buy DBR4 chassis #1 fitted with a 3-litre DBR1 sportscar engine, and a DB4GT road car. A rather nice combination of roadie and racer!\n\nAfter the cars rebuild in March 1960 it was tested at Goodwood by Jack Fairman, and Roy Salvadori over two days before shipment to Port Melbourne. Davison drove the car on the second of the days to within a fraction of a second of Fairman’s best.\n\nChassis 1, unsurprisengly the first of the DBR4s built, was raced by Salvadori during the 1959 and four times in 1960.\n\nAfter an initial test session with Allan Ashton and the AF Hollins crew at Phillip Island Lex raced it to THAT missed-a-win-by-a-bees-dick Australian Grand Prix at Lowood on 12 June. There, Alec Mildren’s Cooper T51 Maserati led Davo home by an official margin of one half of a second after a little over an hour of Grand Prix motor racing of the first order- click here for a feature on Mildren inclusive of a full race report on the AGP; https://primotipo.com/2018/06/08/mildrens-unfair-advantage/\n\nLex and the boys made the long trip back to Queensland in September and ran again at Lowood in another Gold Star round for third place behind Alec and Bib Stillwell, both T51 mounted, then at the non-championship meeting at Phillip Island in October. Davo then raced in the soggy Warwick Farm opening meeting on 18 December where he was fourth behind the T51s of Stillwell, John Youl and Austin Miller having started from the front row.\n\nFamously these Aston Martins were at least two years late to be competitive in Grand Prix racing. Honours as the successful front-engined GP cars go to the Ferrari Dino 246 and Vanwall, winners of the 1958 drivers and manufacturers respectively. While handing out gongs, perhaps the most sophisticated front-engined GP car was the Lotus 16 Climax, if not the most reliable.\n\nTwo of the magnificent Aston Martins came to Australia in 1960. Davison’s ‘DBR4/250 (1) and Bib Stillwell’s ‘DBR4/250 (3)’.\n\nUnlike Lex, Bib had an each way bet, his Kew, Melbourne Holden dealership was spitting out wads of cash so he had a Cooper or three in his garages as well as the Feltham beastie. Lex’ eggs were in one basket, until he borrowed one of Stillwell’s Cooper T51s and nicked the 1961 AGP at Mallala, South Australia from under the noses of the established water-cooled Cooper aces.\n\nI say that as Lex had been winning races and hillclimbs in two Phil Irving fettled Vincent engined Coopers for years, he was hardly unfamiliar with the handling characteristics of these small, light mid-engined missiles.\n\nInto 1961 Lex raced the Aston in the late January Warwick Farm 100- Q11 and DNF oil leak, the race was won by the Walker/Moss Lotus 18 Climax. Davison then contested the Victorian Trophy at Ballarat Airfield on 12 February- the colour photo taken above by Phillip Skelton at that meeting could almost be a BP PR shot!\n\nThis time the car was out after completing nine laps with gearbox dramas, the hot and dusty race was won by Dan Gurney from Graham Hill in BRM P48s. It was the only international win for these cars.\n\nThree weeks later, Davison and Stillwell took the cars to Longford. While Bib practiced the Aston he raced his Cooper whereas Davo raced to the finish of the 24 lap 100 miler, finishing in fifth behind Roy Salvadori, Bill Patterson, John Youl and Austin Miller in 2.2-litre and 2.5-litre Coventry Climax engined Cooper T51s.\n\nAfter Longford Lex shipped the car back to the UK. It needed a major rebuild as “the chassis was breaking up” wrote Graham Howard. The AF Hollins crew had repaired chassis tubes and added strengthening gussets to the machine in their Armadale, Melbourne workshop between the Ballarat and Longford meetings.\n\nLex’ plan was to race an Aston Martin at Le Mans and contest a number of Intercontinental Formula races in 196. In the event, after ongoing discussions with John Wyer, Aston Martin provided Davison a later chassis, “the sister car to Stillwell’s later model DBR4”, chassis 4 which was built but unraced in 1959, for Lex to use at Silverstone in July and Brands Hatch in August.\n\nIt was equipped, as was chassis 1 with a five speed Maserati transaxle instead of the heavy, recalcitrant David Brown unit, the latest cylinder head design which had valves arranged at an included angle of 80 degrees rather than the earlier variants 95 degrees. In 3-litre form it was good for circa 296bhp @ 6,700rpm, a good deal more mumbo than the 230 or so bhp of an FPF 2.5, but of course the chassis was no svelte nymph.\n\nThis article tells a bit of Bib and Lex’ 1961 European Adventures; https://primotipo.com/2015/09/22/aston-martin-db4gt-zagato-2vev-lex-davison-and-bib-stillwell/\n\nDavo above having his first race in the second Aston DBR4/250-4 3-litre at Silverstone during the July 8 1961 British Empire Trophy Intercontinental Formula race. DNF gearbox quill-shaft after 17 laps, up front after 245km was Moss and Surtees in Cooper T53 Climaxes.\n\nDavison had a busy weekend as he also contested the GT race in John Ogier’s Aston Martin DB4GT, “a bit of an old nail” and finished third behind the Ferrari 250 GTs of Stirling Moss and Graham Whitehead.\n\nThe Australian’s DBR4 drive received good press coverage, but Graham Howard wrote that it added to confusion for later historians as to which car Davo raced. The Motor described the machine as an ex-works DBR4 Grand Prix car fitted with a much modified 3-litre sportscar engine, while Autosport added to the confusion by noting that “a new chassis was fitted.”\n\nAston Martin themselves didn’t help either. In a late 1961 letter to Lex about a variety of things including shipment of the car to Australia, Wyer advised “the Aston had now been shipped, although there had been a mix-up with chassis numbers and it had been stamped DBR4-1 rather than DBR4-4”.\n\nTo be clear on this point, Graham Howard makes no comment about the chassis number of Lex’ first Aston, nor does Doug Nye, while Anthony Pritchard – his book was published later – says that the car is generally accepted to be DBR4-1. John Blanden in the second edition of his book simply lists one car and applies two chassis numbers to the “one entity”.\n\nThe correct position seems to be that the two cars were quite separate. Lex raced DBR4-1 in Australia, returned it to Feltham in early 1961, then raced DBR4-4 (the unused 1959 built chassis) in the UK and then later in Australia. The chassis, body and engine were different, built to a later spec. Whether the Maserati gearbox and other componentry fitted to chassis 1, which was interchangeable, was carried over to #4, who knows.\n\nWhat is clear is that Lex was unhappy with his new car after Silverstone, Autosport quoted Lex as saying its “handling was nothing like the original car.”\n\nA month later Davison contested his second and last Intercontinental race, the Guards Trophy at Brands Hatch on 7 August. This time, in dry, sunny conditions he brought the “new dinosaur” home in sixth place, ‘bruising’ the nose of the car; up front, four laps up the road in fact, Jack Brabham headed Jim Clark home in Cooper T53 Climax and Lotus 18 Climax respectively.\n\nA week or so after Brands the family headed home to Australia with the Aston Martin left behind at the factory for further work. This included repair of the panel damage sustained at the Kent circuit and to fit 12.5:1 pistons to suit the alcohol based fuel Lex used in Australia.\n\nHoward reports that Davison was still unhappy with the handling of the car. He quotes from a letter written by Lex to Brian Josceleyne of the Aston Martin Owners Club, “My Grand Prix car is still at the works, where they are endeavouring to sort out some of the handling bugs, for the new chassis proved rather twitchy, unlike my earlier one which was a superb handling car and could be thrown about in a rather flippant way.”\n\nDavo returned home via America including Hawaii, in time to win the AGP in South Australia on 9 October in one of Stillwell’s Cooper T51s. It was a car he rented from Bib after it became clear the DBR4 wouldn’t arrive in Australia on time for the race, that story is here; https://primotipo.com/2018/03/29/the-naughty-corner-renta-gp-winner/\n\nThere was still life in the old design though, Davison raced the Aston Martin to second place in the Victorian Trophy at Calder behind Stillwell’s Cooper T53 Climax in late February 1962. Not too far from home, at Sandown’s opening meeting he contested the Sandown Park International on 12 March where he was eighth behind a swag of Climax engined Coopers and Lotuses as well as the Chuck Daigh driven Scarab RE Buick 3.8-litre V8, it too was a mid-engined machine.\n\nBy that stage Lex had got-with-the-strength and was racing a Cooper T53 Lowline which famously met its maker in a huge accident at Longford on March 4. A gust of wind caught the car while airborne on the hump in the road before the Longford pub, it was a very lucky escape. The Yeoman Credit Cooper was geared for 170mph @ 6,700rpm that weekend, Davison described the accident, raconteur as he was, to John Wyer in one of the many letters they exchanged.\n\n“I was managing to lap at 110 to 112 mph, some three seconds faster than Brabham’s lap record of the year before, when I became airborne over a hump some 200 yards prior to a 90-degree corner in the middle of a little town. A gust of wind caught me and I landed in a drain beside the road. I motored along this at some 140 mph causing some uneasiness to the police, radio announcers, officials, television cameramen and various others cluttering up the entrance to the escape road. I regained the road again but the heavy rear-engined end slid in the gravel and I shot down the road sideways. I hit a tree with the nose, which plucked everything forward of the soles of my feet off the car and spun the car around in the process. It then shot along a hotel wall at window height, demolishing the floral display, pot plants etc, then a 360 degree spin around the entrance porch of the hotel and back up the wall again. The car then fell off the hotel wall and back into the road and shot across the road backwards into a grain mill. I shook what was left from me and went back into the pub and ordered a brandy. They even made me pay for it, which was the cruelest blow of all.”\n\nAfter the international visitors returned home Lex ran the Aston at Sandown in May 1962, winning a race for front engined racing cars. He didn’t run it again until February 1963 when he gave it a gallop at Calder, in part to demonstrate it to potential purchasers. In the process he provided five thrilling laps for spectators in a three car match race with Bryan Thomson’s supercharged Cooper T51 Climax and Frank Matich’s new, works, Elfin Catalina Ford pushrod 1.5.\n\nThe Aston Martin was advertised for sale in Australian Motor Sports during 1962 and was soon acquired by garage proprietor and Calder Raceway part owner, Pat Hawthorn. He is photographed above proudly showing off his new acquisition at his Clayleigh Service Station in Clayton, not too far at all from Sandown where, by March 1963, he was mixing it with the heavies in the Sandown Park International.\n\nHawthorn raced the car through until 1966 in Victoria and South Australia. Perhaps the last championship points the car scored were in the 14 October 1963 Advertiser Trophy, Mallala Gold Star round. There he was fourth among the mid-engined hordes, behind the Cooper T55 of John Youl, Bib Stillwell’s Brabham BT4 and Wally Mitchell’s MRD (aka Brabham BT1) Ford Formula Junior.\n\nPat sold the car to UK historic racer Neil Corner in 1966, there he was a consistent race winner, the Calder Raceway signed Rice Trailer cut quite a dash on UK Motorways! DBR4-4 of course still exists.\n\nChassis numbers and development of the Aston Martin GP cars in summary…\n\nMy standard reference for all things chassis numbers is Allen Brown’s great site, oldracingcars.com (ORC). I say great in the sense that most of the standard texts were written in the pre-internet days before it was possible to debate the merits of ‘what is what’ and ‘which is which’ amongst knowledgeable enthusiasts to land on generally agreed positions based on facts which have been often vigorously debated.\n\nUsing ‘Howard’ (see bibliography) published in 2004, ‘Nye’ in 1993, ‘Blanden’ in 2004, ‘Pritchard’ in 2006 and ‘ORC’ as my source material the Aston Martin Grand Prix cars built are as follows and their destiny, I think and hope is as follows…\n\n1. DP155 and the DBR4/250\n\nAston’s first toe in the water GP exercise was the DB3S based DP155 I wrote about a while ago. Its most significant racing was with Reg Parnell at the wheel during the 1956 New Zealand Internationals, click here; https://primotipo.com/2019/09/05/the-gp-aston-martin-dp155/\n\n‘Its bones’ were converted back into a DB3S albeit there is a car doing the rounds in the UK ‘sorta in the style’ of DP155. It has none of the original car’s core componentry.\n\nGetting more serious, in the summer of 1956 – at the same time they started development of the DBR1 – Aston Martin’s engineers commenced the design of the DBR4/250 GP car.\n\nThe spaceframe chassis was fitted with a short-stroke version of their 3-litre sportscar RB6 engine. This 2493cc DOHC, two valve, 50DCO Weber fed engine produced 250bhp @ 7,800rpm on the Avgas which was mandatory from 1958.\n\nThe design was period typical in having upper and lower wishbone suspension at the front, with torsion bars and co-axial shock absorbers, and De Dion rear suspension with torsion bars again the springing medium. The axle was located by a Watts linkage and radius rods. Armstrong provided the shocks front and rear.\n\nA transaxle was used at the rear – the unpopular with drivers – David Brown CG537 five-speeder. Girling provided the brakes, Borrani the wire wheels. Initially Morris Minor rack and pinion steering was used, later the DB4 rack and pinion was adopted.\n\n2. DBR4/250 chassis number 1\n\n‘This prototype’ was built in time for testing by Reg Parnell and Roy Salvadori at MIRA in December 1957. It was further testing again there in February 1958 before being put to one side as sportscar racing was prioritised.\n\nStirling Moss won the Argentinian GP in a Rob Walker Cooper T45 Climax in early 1958. Time was of the essence with the DBR4/250. The oh-so-sexy-beast, was, in effect obsolete by the time of its launch in April 1959.\n\nBy then the car was fitted with modified DB4GT coil and wishbone front suspension which was more practical than the torsion bar arrangement, but was 15 pounds heavier – in a car which was already a pork-chop.\n\nSalvadori’s second place in the BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone flattered to deceive. Initial problems were an engine at the wrong end of the car (cheap shot), too much weight, and, most critically engine bearing lubrication issues which meant revs had to be kept down to an uncompetitive level.\n\nAston Martin won at Le Mans in 1959, Salvadori and Carroll Shelby took a splendid win in the DBR1. Poised to win the World Sportscar Championship, the F1 program, rightfully, took second place in the allocation of scarce corporate resources.\n\nIn the winter of 1959/1960 chassis 1 and 2 were modified. After surgery they were two inches slimmer and some 55lb lighter. ‘”Merely replacing Brown’s own heavy and baulky CG537 transaxle with one from Maserati (Type 5M-60) saved 50lb. The Aston gearchange, reliable, but heavy and slow – tolerable in a sportscar, was out of place in Formula 1″ Doug Nye wrote.\n\nAfter negotiations between Davison and Wyer DBR4 1 was fitted with engine number RB6/300/1 from sportscar chassis DBR1-1 and shipped to Australia, John Blanden wrote.\n\nDBR4 1 was returned to the UK by Davison in early 1961 and was eventually bought by Neil Corner, to use as a spare for his DBR4-4 he ran in historic racing with chassis 1 built into a complete car by Geoffrey Marsh in the early eighties.\n\n3. DBR4/250-2\n\nWas Carroll Shelby’s chassis in 1959, and like #1 contested only the Dutch, British and Portuguese GPs that year. 1959/1960 winter modifications as above. DBR4-2 was scrapped.\n\n4. DBR4/250-3\n\nThis car was lighter than the first two built by virtue of a stressed skin body centre section, one piece De Dion tube and lighter Maserati gearbox. Its race debut was at Monza in September 1959.\n\nSalvadori retired it while running sixth, Moss won in a Rob Walker Cooper T51 Climax. Front engined Ferrari 246 and BRM P25s filled six of the top eight places so a good front-engined machine could still do well, on fast circuits at least!\n\nStillwell bought the car on a bit of a whim, frustrated as he was by not being able to buy a 2.5-litre Coventry Climax FPF engine for his Cooper T51 at the time. The motors were in short supply, allocation preference was to the works favoured or contracted Cooper, Walker and Lotus teams.\n\nIn the event, no sooner had Bib committed to the Aston Martin, he was able to buy the Cooper T51 Jack Brabham raced in Australia that year…fitted with a 2.5-litre FPF.\n\nIn fact the Kew, Melbourne Holden Dealer had possibly fallen out of love with the Aston before its arrival in Australia. Bib raced his new 2.5-litre T51 to first at Port Wakefield in October, then second at Caversham, and third at Phillip Island on consecutive December weekends. He topped off his late season form by winning the (non Gold Star) Warwick Farm Trophy on 18 December, back in fourth place was Lex’ DBR4 surrounded by a sea of Cooper T45/51s.\n\nFitted with 3-litre RB6/300/7 sportscar engine, DBR4/250-3 arrived in Australia in late 1960 and was almost immediately shipped to New Zealand to contest the NZ GP at Ardmore, Auckland in early January 1961. He placed fifth in a heat and was classified twelfth in the GP, Jack Brabham won in a Cooper T53 Climax.\n\nBack In Australia, he practiced the car for the Warwick Farm 100 in late January but didn’t race it. Running the T51, he finished third behind the Moss and Innes Ireland Lotus 18 Climaxes. Bib’s crew then took the car across Bass Straight to Longford in early March, Bib practiced it, but the engine burned a piston so he raced his Cooper T51, retiring with plug problems in the Longford Trophy won by Roy Salvadori’s Ecurie Vitesse (Jack Brabham) Cooper T51 Climax.\n\nBib continued to race his T51 but returned with the Aston Martin to Warwick Farm in May. He won the (non Gold Star) 10 lap Racing Car Scratch from Alec Mildren’s Cooper T51 Maserati 2.9 and Noel Hall’s Cooper T51 Climax 2.2. Was this the only race win of a DBR4 in-period anywhere?\n\nAnd that was it. Bib displayed the car at Jim Abbott’s Melbourne Racing Car show in August before racing it again in the 1962 NZ GP, doubtless, given his flotilla of Coopers, with a view to selling the car in New Zealand. He was tenth in the sopping wet race won by Stirling Moss – having qualified seventh – inclusive of a mid race plug-change.\n\nBay of Islands driver Lionel Bulcraig acquired the car after the race, running it in NZ through to 1965, his time in the car is covered here; https://primotipo.com/2019/09/02/waimates-aston-martin-dbr4-250/\n\nBulcraig advertised it in Car and Driver, the American international magazine, in late 1965. It was acquired by Peter Brewer who dominated Historic Racing in the UK in the late sixties with it. Bought by Tom Wheatcroft’s Donington Collection in 1970, it was “a collection of horrible bits”, as Doug Nye described it, for restoration to original 1959 specifications.\n\n5. DBR4/250-4\n\nThis chassis built at the same time as #3 but was unraced in F1 in 1959 and 1960.\n\nAfter DBR4-1 was returned by Davison to Feltham in early 1961, DBR4-4 was built to ultimate spec; De Dion rear, Maserati gearbox, 80 degree cylinder head and magnesium alloy block RB6/300 engine specifications for use in the Intercontinental Formula in the UK. Then limited use in Australia before its sale to Pat Hawthorn in early 1963.\n\nLater to Neil Corner in 1966, who also acquired DBR4-1 which was eventually built up as an historic car.\n\nCars 6. and 7. DBR5/250-1 and 2- sometimes also referred to as DP201\n\nFor 1960 Aston Martin designed a new car – still front engined mind you – the DBR5/250 was 3 inches shorter than the DBR4 with a wheelbase of 7 ft 3 inches and used torsion bar independent front suspension.\n\nTwo cars were laid down, DBR5/250-1 which was built with a De Dion rear and chassis 2 which was fitted with independent rear suspension by torsion bars.\n\nBoth DBR5s were scrapped after unsuccessful performances in the International Trophy, at Zandvoort and in the British GP.\n\nDoug Nye wrote that “The new rear end merely made the cars handle worse, so following the British GP, David Brown wisely withdrew his team from the dying Formula”,- the 2.5-litre F1 ended on 31 December 1960.\n\nIn summary, Aston Martin built seven Grand Prix cars; one DP155, four DBR4s and two DBR5s with three now extant – DBR4 1, 3 and 4.\n\nAnthony Pritchard wrote that “By this time (Zandvoort) Aston Martin realised the hopelessness of their position.”\n\nTeam Manager Reg Parnell asked Stirling Moss to try the car, the best that he could manage was a 1:40 compared to 1:33.2 in his Lotus 18 Climax. Trying his very hardest, Salvadori achieved 1:37 seconds.\n\nEtcetera…\n\nAfter publication Lotus historian and author Michael Oliver got in touch and sent these two marvellous shots of Lex during the Brands Hatch Guards Trophy meeting taken by his father, and his dad’s mate, below.\n\nWhilst Lex damaged the nose of the car during practice he also knocked off the right-front corner of the Aston. The shot captures the damage and is a rare colour image of the suspension.\n\nEcurie Australie at Longford in 1961.\n\nPhoto Credits…\n\nPeter D’Abbs via Mark Ellery Collection, Pat Hawthorn Collection via Russell Hawthorn, Phillip Skelton via the Tony Johns Collection, Getty Images, Ron Lambert, oldracephotos.com.au/JSaward, Peter Coleby Collection, Tony Selfe, David Friedman Collection, LAT, E Stevens, Brier Thomas, Hall & Hall, TC March, conceptbunny.com, Michael Oliver Collection, Kim Harley\n\nBibliography…\n\n‘Lex Davison: Larger Than Life’ Graham Howard, ‘History of The Grand Prix Car 1945-65’ Doug Nye, ‘Aston Martin: A Racing History’ Anthony Pritchard, ‘Historic Racing Cars in Australia’ John Blanden, oldracingcars.com\n\nTailpieces…\n\nThe opening shot of Lex again but cropped a tad tighter to focus that little bit more on the car- DBR4/250-1. While below is the same car eighteen months before in the Dutch sand dunes rather than the Australian ones, Roy Salvadori at Zandvoort during the 29-31 May weekend in 1959.\n\nFinito…\n\nThe Cooper Mark 1 (later referred to as T41) was the Surbiton marques prototype or first mid-engined F2 car…\n\nNote that there were also Mk1, 2, 3 etc air-cooled Coopers, the T41 was typically fitted with a Coventry Climax 1.5 litre FWB SOHC, two-valve engine.\n\nThis article was spawned by Theo Page’s Type 41 cutaway above. I thought ‘that would be nice to add to an existing article on the Paul England/Austin Miller car’ and then I came upon T45, multiple T51 drawings as well as the ‘Lowline’ T53 so the idea of a piece on the early water-cooled mid engined Coopers popped into my head.\n\nI knew the John Ross and Dave Friedman archives had some great workshop/circuit photographs of the cars engineering detail but that was going to create too much visual clutter so the article is in two parts.\n\nThe first bit is the overall story- Who, What, Where and When if you like, the second is more around the design and engineering of the cars with photographs providing great visual support. An ‘eyeful is better than an earful’ and all that.\n\nIn terms of photographs I’ve already written a lot of Cooper articles, often ‘quickies’ with all of the best Australian photographs I could find contained therein- rather than re-use these, key ‘Cooper Climax’ and ‘Cooper Maserati’ into the search spot on the upper left primo home page and you can check them out at your leisure, I have sought photos hopefully many of you have never seen before- other than a few Kiwis anyway!\n\nOff we go.\n\nIf John and Charles Cooper’s first mid-engined Coopers of 1948 set the company on a path to change the face of motor racing, the T41 hastened the onslaught on the long established (Auto Union pre-war duly noted) front engine motor racing paradigm.\n\nLets not forget the performance of the Cooper Bristols Mk1 and Mk II or T20 and T23 which were born as F2 machines and became Grand Prix cars with the adoption of F2 to determine the drivers and manufacturers championships in 1952 and 1953.\n\nThose cars ‘launched the careers’ of a swag of top line pilots not least two World Champions in Mike Hawthorn and Jack Brabham.\n\nThe performance of the T39 ‘Bobtail’ and T40 Bristol which Jack ‘knocked together from the Cooper parts bin’, and in which he made his F1 Championship debut at Aintree in 1955- and aboard which he won the Australian Grand Prix at Port Wakefield later that year, emboldened human dynamo John Cooper to build a mid-engined car for the new 1.5 litre F2 which took effect from 1 January 1957.\n\nIn the UK six F2 races were held between the 14 July Silverstone British GP support race won by Roy Salvadori’s works T41 Climax FWB and the 14 October BRSCC Brands Hatch race won by the RRC Walker Racing T41 similarly engined car. The new T41’s won five of the six races, Salvadori four and Brooks one. Colin Chapman won at Brands on 9 September in a Lotus 11 FWB sportscar, an occasion where the T41’s were absent.\n\nFinally the Brits had, in Coventry Climax, a manufacturer of modern, competitive engines which were available to all who could stump up the readies. During 1957 the SOHC, two-valve FWB was supplemented by the twin-cam, two valve FPF putting in place the family of engines which carted away two F1 titles in 1959/60.\n\nSimilarly, Cooper built cars for all.\n\nThere is other ‘confluential’ stuff which contributed to Cooper’s rise and rise too;\n\nJack Brabham arrived at Cooper in 1954 with his unique blend of driving, testing, mechanical and engineering skills. The energy of Jack and John Cooper must have been a truly awesome thing to watch- I’m not so sure I would have wanted to work for them but to view it all from the sidelines would have been quite something.\n\nRRC Walker racing ‘attached themselves’ to the lads from Surbiton, specifically the contributions of Walker RRC, Moss S, and Francis A were mega, as we will see.\n\nNot to forget the son and father combination of John Cooper, a racer to the core, and Charles Cooper who kept the business alive and well. As anyone who has run a small business well knows keeping an enterprise afloat is not easy especially in the fickle ‘only as good as yer last race’ world of motor racing. Cooper Cars was highly profitable throughout with John selling at ‘the right time’ a decade hence not too long after Charles died.\n\nWhere were we?- back to the Mark 1, or make that, for me, T41!\n\nJohn Cooper and Owen Maddock produced a car which was strongly based on the T39 albeit the machine was ‘slipper bodied’ rather than having the all-enveloping body of the other car. Similarly it had independent suspension front and rear using top transverse leaf springs and wishbones at the bottom.\n\nThe production 1957 Mark II (T43) was settled upon that winter and put into build at Hollyfield Road.\n\nIt had a longer wheelbase that the Mk1 and bulkier bodywork to accommodate two pannier fuel tanks rather than the scuttle tank of the Mark 1- the suspension was the same as the earlier car, the drooped nose was a means of distinguishing between Coopers very latest offering and its predecessor.\n\nBrabham debuted the Coventry Climax FPF engine- it took its bow at the 1956 London Motor Show, in the first race of the year, the Lavant Cup at Goodwood on 22 April finishing second to Tony Brooks Walker T41 FWB. Initially the 1475cc engine developed 141bhp @ 7300rpm and most importantly a swag of torque from 4000rpm- it’s peak was 108.5 lb-ft @ 6500rpm. The pint sized package weighed only 225 pounds.\n\nIt was a year of F2 dominance for the marque- in sixteen national and international races Brabham won five, Tony Marsh, George Wicken and Roy Salvadori two apiece and Tony Brooks and Ronnie Moore one. Tom Dickson won at Snetterton in May aboard a Lotus 11 FWA when no T41/43 was present, Maurice Trintignant was victorious at Reims in a Ferrari 156 and Edgar Barth in a Porsche 550RS at the Nürburgring but otherwise it was all Cooper.\n\nMeanwhile in Europe privateers were racing the cars in non-championship Grands Prix. George Wicken took his T43 FPF to Siracusa in early April DNF, Brabham was fourth in the Glover Trophy at Goodwood behind two F1 Connaught B Types and a BRM P25. Salvadori was second at the GP de Caen in July behind Behra’s BRM P25 but ahead of four Maserati 250F’s, a car Roy knew rather well.\n\nIn the BRDC International Trophy Innes Ireland’s T43 was sixth in his heat and Brabham second in his. Fourteen Cooper T41/43’s contested this race, the best placed was Salvadori in eighth behind BRM P25’s and Maserati 250F.\n\nWith a 2 litre FPF available Cooper ran a limited World Championship campaign that year, the best results were Salvadori’s fifth at Aintree and Brabham’s sixth at Monaco. Doug Nye explained how the 2 litre variant came about.\n\nEarly in 1957 Roy Salvadori tested Rob Walker’s F2 T41 and F1 Connaught Type B on the same day at Goodwood. He quickly realised the potential pace of a water cooled mid-engined Cooper and floated the idea of increasing the capacity of the FPF enough to tackle GP racing.\n\nSoon, with Walkers financial backing- Rob ordered a chassis and 2 litre engine, the project was underway. Climax’ changes involved increasing the bore and stroke which required new pistons, liners and crank- the result, with only two days fettling was an astonishing 176bhp @ 6500rpm. Brabham used the engine at Monaco and ran as high as third before pushing the car over the line in sixth after fuel pump failure.\n\nAt the end of Jack’s European season he came home for the summer commencing his race campaign with the Australian Grand Prix at Caversham, an ex-airbase circuit out of Perth.\n\nHis T41 qualfied and finished third behind the Formula Libre 3 litre Ferrari 500 of Lex Davison/Bill Patterson and Stan Jones’ Maserati 250F.\n\nThe 1958 Mark III (T45) added significant refinement in that the front suspension was changed to use coil springs and both upper and lower wishbones. At the rear the transverse leaf remained with upper lateral links added which released the spring to do just that, relieved of its additional wheel locational function.\n\nCoventry Climax chief Leonard Lee had endorsed a further increase in the capacity of the FPF to 2.2 litres, the maximum the original block could accommodate. Production of these engines was geared around resourcing two car Cooper and Rob Walker Cooper entries.\n\nThe F2 Index lists twenty F2 races in 1958 with Cooper T43/45 victory honours shared widely. Brabham and Bruce McLaren- Jack brought Bruce to Europe that year after Bruce had much Cooper success at home, had three wins each, Moss and Ian Burgess two, with one each to Stuart Lewis-Evans, Kiwi, Syd Jensen, Maurice Trintignant, Henry Taylor, Tim Parnell and Jim Russell.\n\nThe big news of course was Stirling Moss’ win aboard Rob Walker’s T43 in the Argentinian Grand Prix.\n\nThe car was fitted that day with one of the 1960cc FPF’s. Continental tyres contributed too, he ran on them from start to finish in place of his usual Dunlops. Vanwall, to whom Moss was contracted in F1 that year chose not to travel to Argentina given its cost, distance and because Tony Vandervell’s engines were not quite running well enough on Avgas just yet- there were new fuel regulations in place from 1 January.\n\nSo Walker and Moss decided to have a crack at the race- and won! Use of Continentals was Rob Walker firing a shot across Dunlop’s bows ‘because they weren’t being very helpful on tyres at the time’ Doug Nye quoted Walker as saying in ‘The History of The Grand Prix Car’. The Conti’s were were worn through to the canvas at the end of the race- Ferrari fell for the ruse of a prospective tyre change when Alf Francis and another mechanic paraded with wheels and jacks in the pitlane for a stop which was never planned to happen.\n\nIn non-championship GP’s Moss won the Aintree BARC 200 in April and the GP de Caen, on both occasions aboard a Cooper T45.\n\nIn Australia we were all excited by Cooper pace watching Moss and Brabham face-off in the Melbourne Grand Prix at Albert Park, the last race at the Park until the modern era, won in searing heat by the Walker/Moss T45.\n\nAt championship level Cooper enjoyed considerable success in addition to the Walker/Moss Argentine win.\n\nSalvadori was second at the Nürburgring, third in Britain and fourth at Zandvoort whereas Jack was fourth at Monaco.\n\nThe 2.2 litre FPF made its debut at Monaco in the Salvadori/Brabham works cars. There, Maurice Trintignant ran a Walker T45 with an interim 2015cc engine and centre lock detachable Borrani wire wheels and in a crazy race of attrition, he won- two races on the trot for the RRC Walker Racing new-fangled Coopers!\n\nIn the more open faster races of the season the Coopers were simply giving away too much capacity but that would be remedied in 1959.\n\nThe 1959 Mark IV (T51) was identical in terms of chassis and suspension to the Mark III- the technical details of which are dealt with in the second part of this article.\n\nIt was one of the great customer racing cars of all time in that so many were sold (28 orders according to period factory records but the actual number of chassis built was far greater than this) and so many used it to win for two or three years hence in all corners of the globe.\n\nInteresting insights by Cooper historian Doug Nye are voluminous and fascinating not least the fact that Coopers weren’t all factory constructed by Cooper staff. Some were, but others were built up by customer team mechanics at Cooper or using a ‘kit of parts’ provided by Cooper and built up elsewhere. The ‘kits’ could be complete or otherwise which is reflected in the many different details between cars which are nominally of the same model type.\n\nWhilst, as noted above, the T51 chassis and related componentry inclusive of the gearbox was carried over from the T45, the critical aspect of the package essential for ultimate success was redesign of the FPF to the maximum allowable F1 capacity limit of 2.5 litres unsupercharged.\n\nThe 2.2’s of 1958 were fragile at the margin, the block and crankcase had been weakened in the process of taking the engine from its original 1.5 litres to a smidge over 2.2. The crank counter-weights could not be enlarged and as a consequence the motor vibrated and ran roughly- its life was usually short if over-revved.\n\nWalter Hassan’s redesign started as late as 1 December 1958.\n\nA new block was made by Birmal in light alloy integrating both the block and crankcase and extended from 3 1/2 inches below the crankshaft to 8 5/32 inches above it, Nye wrote. The bore/stroke was 94mm x 89.9mm for a capacity of 2495cc. Cast iron wet liners were used and a five main bearing crank. Beneath the crank was a jackshaft which carried three oil pumps- one pressure and two scavenge. The engine was ‘cross-bolted’- eight studs each side of the block screwed into the main caps.\n\nThe two valve, DOHC engine, as before, had its cams driven by a train of gears. The Mk1 2.5 litre heads had 1 1/2 inch bore ports feeding 1.937 inch inlet valves and 1.687 exhausts. Nye notes the engine was ‘under-valved’ initially in case of structural deficiency elsewhere. Fitted with twin-Weber 58 DCO carbs the engine revved happily to 7000rpm developing circa 240bhp @ 6750rpm and ‘pulled like a train from as little as 4000rpm’. Remember that the 2207cc unit produced 194bhp.\n\nBrabham would have well and truly noticed the weight gain mind you- the 1.5 FPF weighed 225lb, the new 2.5 290lb.\n\nCooper’s factory drivers changed in 1959 as Roy Salvadori, for years a contracted Aston Martin driver, committed himself to David Brown’s old-school front-engined cars in F1 as well as their sportscar program.\n\nIt was a remarkably loyal call by Roy but one not readily understood given his back to back test of Rob Walker’s old and new cars only twelve months or so ago. Roy was very much the quicker of he and Jack in 1958 and really was in the box seat with all of the knowledge about what was coming down the Cooper pike…A Le Mans win together with Carroll Shelby that summer was some compensation for the Aston Martin DBR4 which was ‘too little too late’ without getting lost in that tangent.\n\nJohn Cooper therefore recruited Masten Gregory and promoted Bruce to the F1 squad with Jack’s unique contribution in and out of the car ongoing.\n\nVanwall withdrew from Grand Prix racing, and soon altogether, so Stirling Moss raced Rob Walker’s Coopers. The primary difference in specification between the works cars and Walker’s were that John Cooper didn’t provide his you-beaut modified ERSA gearboxes. Walker was left to his one devices, contracting Valerio Colotti to build transmissions, which it transpired failed repeatedly.\n\nIn some ways it could be said 1959-1960 were the years of the gearboxes. Moss would have won in 1959 had the Colotti’s held together in the Walker 51 and a Lotus 18, ‘the car of 1960’ would perhaps have won in 1960 were it not for the unreliability of Colin Chapman’s sequential ‘Queerboxes’.\n\nHaving said that Cooper created their own luck by building modified versions of the Citroen-ERSA boxes in 1959 and the Owen Maddock designed, Jack Knight built ‘Cooper-Knight CS5’ transaxle in 1960.\n\nIfs, buts and maybes mean nothing in motor racing- but they are interesting all the same!\n\nJack Brabham won the 1959 title with 31 points from Tony Brooks, Ferrari Dino 246 and Vanwall on 27, Moss 25 1/2 and Phil Hill, Ferrari Dino 246 on 20 points.\n\nThe season was open in that Brabham, Brooks and Moss won two races apiece- Monaco and Aintree for Jack, Nürburgring and Reims for Tony and Monsanto and Monza fell to Stirling.\n\nMoss lost the Monaco and Zandvoort leads- and was out early at Monza due to Colotti failure. But the works-boxes were marginal too and Jack nursed them, there is little doubt he had greater mechanical sympathy than Moss- and most other drivers for that matter. One does often make ones own luck in all forms of human endeavour.\n\nBoth Jo Bonnier and Bruce McLaren took their first Championship Grand Prix wins that year- at Zandvoort (also his last) and Sebring aboard BRM P25 and Cooper T51 respectively.\n\nFive non-championship events were held in 1959 and there, too the Coopers were dominant- T51’s took the Glover Trophy at Goodwood- Moss from Brabham powered by their brand new Coventry Climax 2.5 litre FPF’s, the International Gold Cup at Oulton Park went to the Moss/Walker Cooper and Jack bagged the BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone.\n\nFront-engined non-champ victories went to Jean Behra’s Ferrari Dino 246 at Aintree- the BARC 200 and to Ron Flockhart’s BRM P25 at Snetterton in October- the Silver City Trophy.\n\nCooper were more dominant in Formula 2 where Coopers T43, T45 and T51 ‘cleaned up’.\n\nThe most successful combination of the year was Moss at the wheel of Rob Walker’s Borgward engined T43 and T45 with four wins. Tim Parnell and Chris Bristow took three apiece, Brabham two and one each for a lengthy rollcall- Jim Russell, Henry Taylor, Jack Lewis, Maurice Trintignant, Roy Salvadori, Harry Schell, Stan Hart, Trevor Taylor, Ron Carter and Tony Marsh. Amazing really, Cooper built and sold a lotta motor cars!\n\nAt the European seasons end Moss, Brabham and McLaren headed south to the Antipodes for what would become an annual trip to race hard in the sun and play hard in the sun…\n\nThe NZ GP at Ardmore was won by Jack’s T51 as was the Longford Trophy in early March.\n\nThe Surbiton boys received a rude awakening when they fronted up in Argentina on 7 February with their T51’s to be comprehensively blown off by Innes Ireland’s new Lotus 18 Climax- Chapman’s first crack at a mid-engine design was a rather successful one in FJ, F2 and F1…\n\nBruce won the race after the Lotus failed but Jack DNF’d with heat-treating failure in his ERSA gearbox.\n\nSuitably chastened the Cooper crew famously began the design of what became the Cooper T53 ‘Lowline’ on the long haul flights back to the UK. Doug Nye records that they landed in Heathrow on 17 March with the 14 May Silverstone International Trophy the deadline for completion of new cars.\n\nA head start was provided by Owen Maddock’s Cooper-Knight CS5 gearbox- it was just entering limited volume production in Knight’s workshops. McLaren’s College drawing skills were deployed to assist Maddock with Jack providing thought leadership and sketching whilst John chased suppliers for parts.\n\nIn essence the T53 was longer, sleeker, lower and lighter with a new, reliable gearbox able to take the loads of the more powerful FPF 2.5- itself mounted a smidge lower in the stronger in torsional stiffness by 25% (over the T51) Lowline frame- in the final year of the long-lived, very successful and interesting 2.5 litre F1.\n\nThe second half of the article covers the T53 technical advances in plenty of detail.\n\nInnes Ireland won the Glover Trophy at Goodwood in April and the International Trophy at Silverstone in May- Jack’s T53 was second.\n\nMoss could see the Lotus writing on the wall so Rob Walker acquired an 18 prior to Monaco- Stirling promptly won the race albeit Jack led until lap 41 when he spun on a wet patch and clobbered the Ste Devote wall- the damaged frame was repaired in time for Zandvoort where he won- the Lowline’s first win was on the board.\n\nAt Spa the cars were jets- Jack was 2.5 seconds quicker than the nearest pursuer in practice. He won easily with Bruce second after others fell by the wayside- Nye notes Bruce’ car topped 180mph.\n\nBy Reims the T53’s were fitted with larger capacity oil pumps to prolong crown-wheel and pinion life. Jack started from pole and won again after a great long duel with Phil Hill’s potent Ferrari Dino 246.\n\nJack won again in Britain after Graham Hill’s BRM brakes faltered and he spun 6 laps from home, Bruce was fourth, adrift of the two Lotus 18’s of Surtees and Ireland.\n\nFortune again favoured the team at Oporto with another one-two whilst in non-championship events Ireland continued to win- the cars had the speed to win shorter events but not the reliability to win Grands Prix. He won the Lombank Trophy at Snetterton in September and Moss the Oulton Park Gold Cup in Walker’s Lotus later the same month.\n\nThe Italian organisers engineered a Ferrari win at Monza by running their race on the banked circuit and Moss- well and truly back after his terrible Spa crash on that deathly weekend early in the season, the victor in the US GP at Riverside in the Walker 18.\n\nIn Formula 2 Cooper did not have it all their own way in 1960 as they had the year before- of 26 races Cooper won twelve, the Lotus 18 six, Porsche 718 five and Ferrari 156 three- the latter car ‘a dry run’ for their 1961 World Championship winning cars. Of the Cooper brigade Brabham and Jack Lewis won three races, Mike McKee two and George Lawton, Roy Salvadori, Maurice Trintignant, and Klaas Twisk one apiece.\n\nTechnical…\n\nT43..\n\nIn a Motorsport Gordon Murray appreciation piece about the Cooper T51/53 he wrote that when he went to Brabham (in 1972/3) he inherited Pete Beddings and his Dad who made all of the early Cooper shells ‘…but I don’t know who styled them. Whoever it was obviously had an eye, because they were very pretty and quite effective aerodynamically. I suspect it was John saying “its a bit like this”.’\n\n‘I still love to see a little Cooper at Goodwood: they still stir the blood just the same as a Ferrari or a Lotus. They were also well made for the period- if you look at, say, a Ferrari of the time, the frame technology is pretty basic: the rear engined Coopers were at least multi-tubular. Not pure spaceframes like Chapman moved on to later (I think he was well and truly there already Gordon!), but they were clever-simple for reliability.’\n\nThe T43 chassis was made of the usual Cooper 1 1/2 inch steel tube. The Mark 1 tall frame hoop encircled the seat back bulkhead and was unbraced whereas here (below) it was unbraced but the top chassis longerons each side of the engine bay were braced against the lower longerons by a three piece ‘Y member’.\n\nWhat about those Cooper chassis’ which have always offended the purists- a true multi-tubulars spaceframe chassis should use straight tubes only, each stressed in either compression or tension.\n\nFamously, after laying out several straight tube designs for the Mark 8, and in John’s absence having them rejected by Charles Cooper, Owen Maddocks decided to take the piss and presented an option in which every tube was bent- to his surprise it was embraced by Charles, a good intuitive Engineer.\n\nDoug Nye recounts Owens account of the discussion about the approach when John Cooper returned.\n\n’Curving the top frame rails down to meet the bottom ones reduced wracking through the frame. You could run curved tubes where they wouldn’t interfere with fuel tanks and suchlike. One of our very good welders always told me he preferred simple joints- with just one tube jointed into another- to multiple joints with with three or four tubes involved. We didn’t like weld overlapping weld and so tried to arrange things to avoid that. With curved tubes we could follow the body lines more closely, so we didn’t need the old strip -steel frame to support the body panels. What had started as a joke began to look quite logical, and very practical…’\n\nThe F2 Coventry Climax 1475cc gave circa 141bhp @ 7000rpm in its first evolution and drove through a Citroen-ERSA transaxle, which coped pretty well with the demands put upon it at that stage. Note the change linkages and beautiful rear suspension detail- traditional transverse leaf and wishbones Cooper design.\n\nCoopers curvy frame shown to good effect.\n\nIn 1956/7 wire-wheels were still very much the norm in motor racing, Coopers progressive inclination was reflected on the magnesium alloys specified on their cars pretty much from the start. Objects of beauty, lower unsprung weight and strength were amongst the favourable properties.\n\nCrystal clear John Ross shot- not quite close enough to checkout the chassis number however! I wonder who was the steering wheel provider of choice.\n\nNote the gear lever and linkages to the left- the weak link of the higher powered T45 and T51’s covered in this article were the gearboxes, a solution was finally arrived at for all in the form of Mike Hewland’s concern in the early sixties when a racing gearbox finally ‘became a spacer between the engine and rear of the chassis.’\n\nSmiths instruments of course- I wonder if one of those to the lower left is for gearbox oil temperature?\n\nThe engine progression in 1957 goes something like this.\n\nF2 Coventry Climax FPF 1500cc 141 bhp was the ‘standard engine’ for F2 T43’s.\n\nIn F1 Jack Brabham raced at Monaco with a 1960cc FPF for the first time and later in the season, as outlined earlier in the article, 2.2 litre engines were approved by Leonard Lee late in the year and made available to the works and Rob Walker teams in 1958- and others later.\n\nThe T41’s side panels wrapped tightly around the chassis hoops whereas the T43’s were bulged to clear the fuel tanks either side of the driver- sufficient tankage was incorporated for a race of 200 miles duration. The bulged body panels were carried clear of the frame on light-guage outriggers.\n\nSee the bungees retaining the fuel tanks above. Brakes in standard form as here, were Lockheed 10 inch x 1 3/4 inch drums but Girling discs were an option and commonly specified. Shock absorbers were Armstong and uprights, I think, fabricated in-house.\n\nVery slippery.\n\nLean, lithe, light and uber-responsive given the low polar moment of inertia.\n\nNot for the faint of heart and not everybody familiar with a front-engined racer could successfully make the switch- mind you, by 1956 a generation of racers had cut their teeth on air-cooled, mid-engined Coopers so they were rather used to the handling properties of the little beetle-backed machines.\n\nT45…\n\nThis group of photographs are all of an F2 T45 FPF 1.5 but the technical elements of the F2 and F1 T45’s are the same with the exception of engine capacity of course.\n\nThe Mk3/T45 F2 and F1 and 1959 Championship winning Mk4/T51 F2 and F1 cars are virtually identical so lets take a deepish dive into the T45 and the changes over the previous T43.\n\nThis chassis is fitted with an F2 1475cc FPF- T45’s were also fitted with 1960cc, 2015cc and 2207cc FPF’s in 1958.\n\nThe bore/stroke at the latter capacity was 3.5 inches- this ‘square’ configuration was only made possible by slipping a ‘sandwich plate’ between the block and the head to get the required stroke height. On Avgas this motor produced 194bhp @ 6250rpm.\n\nThe shot above provides just a glimpse of the rear transverse leaf spring aft of the chassis cross tube.\n\nIts lateral location was now provided by a short link pivoted on the left side frame trunnion and bolted to a centre clamp (you can just see the inner end) retaining the leaves in the middle of the spring.\n\nFront to rear weight balance of most Coopers was about 44-56%- quite similar to the best front engined cars with a rear mounted fuel tank.\n\nThe T45 chassis was 1/2 inches lower than the T43- at the front it now incorporated upper and lower wishbones and coil spring/Armstong shocks rather than the transverse leaf used by Coopers from the start.\n\nAin’t she sweet.\n\nNote the Alford and Alder forged front uprights, these wonderful bits of kit, then fitted to the Standard 8 and Triumph TR3 Road cars, were installed in F1 Brabhams up to and including the 1966 World Championship winning BT19 Repco- and Formula Fords well into the late seventies and beyond. One of motor racings most ubiquitous components, surely?\n\nThe front wishbones were of the welded tubular type and included a Chorlton ball joint at their outer end. The uprights lower threaded trunnion was coated with cadminium plating setting the finished product off nicely. Roll bars were housed within the bottom frame cross-member.\n\nThe photograph below shows (apart from the very obvious) the top leaf outer end, Armstrong shock and inboard mount for the lower wishbone. The wishbones were more widely based at both the top and bottom than on the Mk2/T43. The outboard mount for the Armstrongs was stiffened- it was on a crossbrace welded between the wishbone legs. Note the fuel filter, starter motor and height of the gearbox.\n\nOn the earlier cars the height of the engine in the frame was determined by the Citroen based gearbox as its input shaft from clutch to gearbox passed high above the inner driveshafts.\n\nIn the early Mk2’s the engine was canted 18 degrees to the right and inclined downwards at the front by 5 degrees to lower the centre of gravity.\n\nJack Brabham’s ongoing contribution to design elements of Coopers in addition to set up and on circuit tuning is well established and recognised. Brabham maintained ongoing correspondence with Ron Tauranac back in Sydney. It was Ron’s suggestion to use ‘drop gears’- spur gears inside the gearbox bell-housing which allowed the engine/gearbox to be lowered a full 2 1/2 inches within the chassis frame.\n\nCooper worked with ERSA in Paris, the gearbox manufacturer and Jack Knight’s specialist shop in Balham, to effect those changes. A bonus was incorporation of a quick-change final drive ratio feature.\n\nJack famously visited ERSA in early 1958 and had six gearboxes cast with extra strengthening ribs. He laid out all the patterns on the bench and added Plasticene here and scraping a core there- the trick cases were just man enough to handle the power of the 2.2 engines in 1958 and 2.5’s in 1959. ZF slippery diffs were added too- a side trip for Jack whilst in Germany, back at Surbiton ‘…John covered his tracks so Charlie would not hear of the extra expense’ Nye wrote.\n\n‘All Cooper chassis pickups…had been provided by drilled triangular welded-on brackets known as “Bradnack Lugs”, and on the Mark 3 frame those anchoring the inboard pivots of the lower wishbones were aligned above the bottom frame rails instead of below them. Both top and bottom frame longerons were more widely spaced than on the preceding Mark 2’s with less pronounced tube curvature’ Doug Nye wrote.\n\nWhilst noting Cooper’s mid-engine approach itself was at the time revolutionary, the evolution of the cars from T43 to T45/51 was more evolutionary in nature addressing design/performance weaknesses or strengthening componentry based on hard won experience.\n\nCharlie, John and Jack were all racers…and supreme pragmatists.\n\nThey were not after the great leap forward- they had that conceptually, beyond that they sought performance advantage and reliability whilst Charles, with a ready eye on the family fortunes, ensured the whole kit and caboodle could be sold at a profit and repaired and maintained cost-effectively back at Hollyfield Road or by a customer in the paddock at Gnoo Blas.\n\nDoug Nye is at pains to point out in HAGP that the specification of these cars is not fixed or hard and fast given so many of them, as we covered earlier, were built in the factory by the teams running them or using kits of parts supplied. The ultimate detail and personal tweaks applied means that individual chassis differed from one another almost as a matter of course.\n\nTake your pick of artists in terms of T51 cutaway drawings!\n\nThe one earlier in the article is Tony Matthews, above is James Allingtons’ and the one below is Brian Hatton’s so every angle and detail must be well and truly covered!\n\nT53 ‘Lowline’..\n\nAs mentioned earlier the threat of the Lotus 18 meant that a ‘clean sheet’ approach was needed- a Cooper-esque clean sheet in any event! Every part of the T51 was quickly scrutinised through lenses of lightness, simplicity, strength and efficiency.\n\nFundamental design tenets were laying the driver down to aid aerodynamic efficiency, a coil sprung rear end (Charles Cooper fought a pitched battle on this score Nye records by insisting that a transverse leaf rear also be designed should the coils fail), greater torsional stiffness and an improvement in performance around the T51 ‘weak tracks’ which included fast places like Reims and the Avus.\n\nThe chassis was still essentially a four-tuber of 1 1/2 inch 18 gauge thick top rails and 19 gauge bottoms. Diagonals braced the frame bays ahead of the cockpit but that area was un-braced ‘other than small tube ties welded across the joint apices’.\n\nThe long rear bays were unbraced on both sides, when the engine and gearbox were fitted- the latter ‘CS5’ had five mount points frame stiffness was of course enhanced. There were two diagonals in each side with a common apex halfway along the bottom chassis rail.\n\nThe engine mounts were welded onto curved tubes to reduce the length of the mounts, both of which were welded to the middle of the main frame members, this ‘would have been heresy to an accomplished stress man like Colin Chapman’ Doug notes.\n\nThe engine was lowered another inch over the T51 by reducing centre-offset between the step-up gears in the gearbox and allowing the driveshafts to rake upwards to the hubs rather than being parallel with the ground when static.\n\nThe steering column was lengthened and moved from behind the front axle line to ahead of it- thus the pedals could go forward and the steering wheel rake made more vertical all allowing the driver to adopt a more laid-down pose aiding aero on those fast courses.\n\nThe oil tank capacity was the same but its shape was changed- it was lower and wider, still behind the radiator but pushed forward to reduce nose height.\n\nSuspension wishbones were wider and stronger.\n\nThe ‘CS5’ transaxle was a lovely bit of kit. It was remote sumped in its gearbox section with splash-feed to the final drive and ZF diff. The unit placed its gears above the oil level so only a pressure pump was needed.\n\nThe gearbox ‘…proved essentially trouble free…Jack Knight recalled the vast amount of machining required…its cost to Cooper was around 1000 pounds a box which was virtually prohibitive. John Cooper managed to hush it up, telling his father they cost around 400 pounds each- and The Old Man was livid even then!’ Nye wrote.\n\nNo doubt Chapman would have been keen to get hold of a couple of these boxes half way through 1960, fitted thus he had a championship winning car.\n\nThe prototype Lowline was completed at around 9 am on Friday 6 May 1960 and taken to Silverstone, where after a few shakedown laps, Brabham drove faster and faster- within 10 laps he was 2 seconds under the lap record. Then Bruce jumped in and went quicker still.\n\nCooper were well and truly back in the game!\n\nSo where does this series of cars fit in the pantheon of racing cars and motor racing history?\n\nGordon Murray was rather eloquent about that aspect.\n\n‘When I think back to GP milestones , its pretty obvious really, the first rear-engined F1 Cooper. Not so much from a technical point of view even though it was so simple and so effective compared to the other more complex cars of the time but because it brought with it probably the most significant change in Grand Prix cars…’\n\n‘Who else can lay claim to such an impact. And i’m including pre-war cars like Auto Unions because they were such bad examples of rear-engined cars…The real pioneers were Charles and John Cooper, first with the 500 F3 cars and then having the bottle as a small concern to go ahead and do a GP car.’\n\n‘Really the Cooper was more significant, more forward looking even than the Lotus 25 because it meant a fundamental change in packaging, weight distribution, frontal area, in philosophy. And it was an ultra simple car as well, easy to run easy to work on. I always tried to build my GP cars at both Brabham and McLaren to be as simple and easy to work on as possible, and therefore get reliability, and the Cooper was such a good car from that angle. And that Climax was a very under-rated engine because it was built by a very small company. So, the whole package was pretty radical. John probably hasn’t had the credit he should have overall.’\n\n‘All kinds of things appeal to me about it: firstly it was a great little family business, two bright guys and then the giant killing aspect…I just love that aspect. And these guys did two titles back to back…’\n\nFinally, Gordon concluded ‘As a designer i’d have loved to have been the first to say “hang on that’s a bit cranky having the engine in the front”, with that weight distribution, that frontal area, the prop-shaft losses, compared to the extra traction, better braking- everything gets better with the engine behind. You can’t help saying “Why didn’t somebody think of this before”…\n\nEtcetera: Cooper Mark and Type Numbers…\n\nAllen Brown advises that the ‘T type’ descriptor started at Cooper in 1963. It was applied both prospectively and retrospectively. Stephen Dalton ‘tangibilises’ this in that after extensive research, he can see Cooper using a ‘T number’ for the first time in an October 1962 issue of Autosport where Cooper are quoted about ‘the new Cooper Monaco, the Type 61’\n\nDoug Nye wrote more broadly about the timing of the detailed way in which racing cars commenced to be identified (that is, for example, when a Cooper or Cooper Climax became a Cooper T51 Climax) ‘When it comes to a type numbering system- as in so many things Cooper- don’t rely on published references to same…I have seen all types of T scrawls on some drawing copies.’\n\n‘When I publicised manufacturer type classifications in a “Motor Racing” magazine article reviewing the 1 litre F2 seasons 1964-5 that was the first detailed references that many people had seen to some model classifications which are now used as common terms. I was not the first- but I think at least amongst the first- to present such nerdy detail.’\n\n‘Race reporters had seldom used even Brabham BT classification before then…Brian Jordan had previously produced a little booklet essentially for model makers which included type number detail. I also seem to recall Paul Watson freelance writer/entry fixer of the 1960’s having on a few prior occasions cited a type number’ Doug concluded.\n\nCredits…\n\nSpecial thanks to the fantastic John Ross Motor Racing Archive and Dave Friedman Archive, Theo Page, Brian Hatton, University of Newcastle, The Nostalgia Forum, ‘CAN’-Classic Auto News- Allan Dick, Milan Fistonic, Geoff Smedley, David Van Dal, oldracephotos.com.au, Getty Images- Bernard Cahier and GP Library, John Ellacott, Ron Lambert, Tony Matthews, James Allington, Bruno Betti, Ken Devine Collection\n\nBibliography…\n\n‘History of The Grand Prix Car’ Doug Nye, grandprix.com, oldracingcars.com, F2Index-Fastlane, Motorsport ‘Cooper T51/53’ interview with Gordon Murray in June 2000\n\nTailpiece…\n\nJack at his happiest and most creative.\n\n‘Jack Brabham…was always working with the cars, looking at them, thinking about them…’Owen Maddock fondly observed of Jack to Doug Nye.\n\nIts a posed shot above no doubt but it illustrates the point all the same…\n\nFinito…"
