The document summarizes the unique success of the Cosworth DFV Grand Prix engine over 16 years from 1967-1983. It provided the basis for 9 driver championships and 5 constructor championships, winning 154 races. The DFV was normally aspirated but was eventually displaced by 1.5L turbocharged engines requiring 5 years of development. The document also provides background on Cosworth Engineering and the technical advances of the predecessor Cosworth FVA engine which informed the design of the landmark DFV engine.",
