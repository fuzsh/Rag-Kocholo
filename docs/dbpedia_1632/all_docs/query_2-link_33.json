        "text": "“Advanced Topics” is Part 8 of a ten part presentation series \"Automotive Dynamics and Design\". The intent is to form a comprehensive series of lectures providing instruction in the design of automobiles from both a practical and a stylistic viewpoint. The ten segments constitute the core (reading assignments, homework, and test material not included) of a class to be given over a period of about twelve weeks. The ten course segments are: 1) \"Automotive Dynamics and Design\" 2) \"Longitudinal Dynamics\" 3) \"Lateral Dynamics\" 4) \"Vertical Dynamics\" 5) \"Mass Properties Analysis and Control\" 6) \"Tire Behavior\" 7) \"Aerodynamics\" 8) \"Advanced Topics\" 9) \"Design (Styling)\" 10) \"Summary\" Part 1 is essentially an introduction to, and a syllabus for, the course of study. Part 2 constitutes a study of automotive acceleration, braking, and crash deceleration. Part 3 constitutes a study of oversteer, understeer, directional stability, rollover, lateral acceleration: transient and steady state. Part 4 constitutes a study of springing, damping, shock attenuation, road contact, road vibration transmissibility, ride motions. Part 5 constitutes a study of the ten mass properties equations, the ten mass properties uncertainty equations, standard deviation, normal distribution, regression analysis, coefficient of determination, correlation, degrees of freedom, total weight estimation, unsprung weight estimation, sprung weight estimation, estimation of the total weight c.g., estimation of the unsprung weight c.g., estimation of the sprung weight c.g., estimation of the total mass moments of inertia, estimation of the unsprung mass moments of inertia, estimation of the sprung mass moments of inertia, estimation of the total products of inertia, estimation of the sprung roll moment of inertia. Part 6 constitutes a study of friction vs. traction, normal load vs. deflection, normal load vs. contact area, load capacity, vertical stiffness, lateral traction, longitudinal traction, %Slip, Slip Angle, Traction Ellipse, rolling resistance, temperature effects, speed effects. Part 7 constitutes a study of Navier-Stokes Equations, dimensionless indicators (Reynolds Number, Mach Number), streamlines, Bernoulli’s Equation, drag, lift, boundary layer, separation, wake, vortices, center of pressure, aerodynamic stability, wings, fences, spoilers. Part 8 constitutes a study of camber, caster, toe in/out, scrub, kingpin angle, scrub radius, effective spring rate, roll stiffness, suspension geometry, roll axis, steering geometry, turn centers, geared and equivalent gearless systems, products of inertia, gyroscopic reactions, fuel economy, standing wave, hydroplaning. Part 9 introduces the concept of Design (a.k.a. Styling), Design Schools, Design Practitioners, Design Process, Exterior Design, Interior Design. Part 10 deals with the business and manufacturing aspects of automotive endeavors: business plan (product, market, cash flow, P&L, capitalization, ROI, etc.), profit and loss statements, break-even analysis, in-house or subcontract decisions, plant location and layout, jigs and fixtures, equipment, supply and inventory, customer service & relations strategy.\n\nAutomotive longitudinal acceleration is dependent upon a large number of interconnected parameters, some of the most important of which are mass properties. The purpose of this paper is to explore the individual mass property effects. The approach taken to achieve this purpose was to decouple the parameters by means of a computer simulation of an automotive acceleration \"run\". Each individual mass property parameter was then varied over a wide range while all other parameters were held constant. The acceleration results so obtained were plotted, and the conclusions were drawn from the behavior thus exhibited. Several conclusions have been drawn from this effort. First, the effects of a mass property parameter variation are not necessarily constant over the entire speed range. For instance, increasing weight tends to cause an almost linear increase in the elapsed times for the lower speed ranges, but the higher speed ranges exhibit ever greater time increases in an almost parabolic relationship. This is a matter of the increased rolling resistance associated with greater weight making itself felt at the higher speeds. The longitudinal center of gravity (LCG) and the vertical center of gravity (VCG) both affect acceleration through traction. If the situation is not traction critical, then c.g. relocation can be of no help in obtaining better acceleration. When a situation is traction critical then acceleration is much more sensitive to change in LCG then in VCG. Increasing the vertical center of gravity tends to benefit the acceleration of rear wheel drive vehicles. For rear wheel drive vehicles the VCG generates increased traction through weight transfer. In the case of front wheel drive, the VCG can have no beneficial effect as the weight transfer is in the direction away from the drive axle; minimizing the VCG becomes the priority. Due to the effect of weight transfer, a front wheel drive vehicle will always be inferior in acceleration to a rear wheel drive vehicle if everything else is equal and the propulsive capability is great enough. In general, a rotational mass is disproportionately detrimental to acceleration because it has to be accelerated both rotationally and translationally. The greatest return for the effort involved in mass reduction can be obtained from a reduction in rotational masses. The engine rotational masses, other than the flywheel, represent a special case outside the scope of this paper. Vehicle characteristics and use demand a certain minimal rotational inertia for the flywheel to counteract engine stall-out tendencies at the onset of acceleration and to ensure smooth engine operation. In fact, higher flywheel inertia can produce an initially quicker vehicle. This initial response has to be considered against the detrimental longer-term effects of accelerating a greater flywheel inertia throughout the speed range; flywheel design involves a high degree of compromise.\n\nThe aim was to develop a body of the racecar with the proper studies and analyses, taking into account several factors, to present an optimum structure as a final result. These factors include, but are not limited to, weight, cost, drag resistance, functionality and aesthetics. The expected product is to not just be appealing to the eye but also increase the performance of the vehicle. Additional objectives include being able to accommodate the budget while maintaining a highly competitive level to perform well in on the race track. The new design will reduce the weight of the prototype and as well as the air drag, taking into consideration the ground effects desired to be implemented in the vehicle as a crucial factor. Moreover, the new body will be easier to dismantle reducing the service time."
