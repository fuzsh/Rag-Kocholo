        "text": "Automotive longitudinal acceleration is dependent upon a large number of interconnected parameters, some of the most important of which are mass properties. The purpose of this paper is to explore the individual mass property effects. The approach taken to achieve this purpose was to decouple the parameters by means of a computer simulation of an automotive acceleration \"run\". Each individual mass property parameter was then varied over a wide range while all other parameters were held constant. The acceleration results so obtained were plotted, and the conclusions were drawn from the behavior thus exhibited. Several conclusions have been drawn from this effort. First, the effects of a mass property parameter variation are not necessarily constant over the entire speed range. For instance, increasing weight tends to cause an almost linear increase in the elapsed times for the lower speed ranges, but the higher speed ranges exhibit ever greater time increases in an almost parabolic relationship. This is a matter of the increased rolling resistance associated with greater weight making itself felt at the higher speeds. The longitudinal center of gravity (LCG) and the vertical center of gravity (VCG) both affect acceleration through traction. If the situation is not traction critical, then c.g. relocation can be of no help in obtaining better acceleration. When a situation is traction critical then acceleration is much more sensitive to change in LCG then in VCG. Increasing the vertical center of gravity tends to benefit the acceleration of rear wheel drive vehicles. For rear wheel drive vehicles the VCG generates increased traction through weight transfer. In the case of front wheel drive, the VCG can have no beneficial effect as the weight transfer is in the direction away from the drive axle; minimizing the VCG becomes the priority. Due to the effect of weight transfer, a front wheel drive vehicle will always be inferior in acceleration to a rear wheel drive vehicle if everything else is equal and the propulsive capability is great enough. In general, a rotational mass is disproportionately detrimental to acceleration because it has to be accelerated both rotationally and translationally. The greatest return for the effort involved in mass reduction can be obtained from a reduction in rotational masses. The engine rotational masses, other than the flywheel, represent a special case outside the scope of this paper. Vehicle characteristics and use demand a certain minimal rotational inertia for the flywheel to counteract engine stall-out tendencies at the onset of acceleration and to ensure smooth engine operation. In fact, higher flywheel inertia can produce an initially quicker vehicle. This initial response has to be considered against the detrimental longer-term effects of accelerating a greater flywheel inertia throughout the speed range; flywheel design involves a high degree of compromise.\n\nProblems in dynamics may be solved by any one or more of three basic methods: force and acceleration (F=m a), work and kinetic energy (Fd=½ mV^2), impulse and momentum (〖Imp〗_(1→2)=mV_2-mV_1); these are just different ways of looking at a common underlying reality . The method(s) used to investigate a particular dynamics problem depends upon the specific nature of the problem. Problems involving that most severe form of automotive longitudinal deceleration, crashing, are no exception. Even at the most elementary level, as represented by the previous equations, the unifying role of mass properties is evident. Notable in the basic formulae of all three methods for the solution of problems in dynamics is the common parameter “m” (mass). However, this represents just the “tip of the iceberg”; at the detailed level representative of actual engineering problems the full role played by mass properties is often revealed to be far more complicated than that indicated by such simple basic equations. For instance, an automobile traveling at a particular velocity will possess a certain amount of kinetic energy which must be dissipated for the vehicle to come to a stop. The dissipation can be controlled and orderly as in the case of braking a car to a stop at an intersection, or it can be somewhat more violent as in the case of a collision with a concrete abutment. In both cases the outcome is directly dependent upon the magnitude of the kinetic energy involved. Initially the mass properties involvement seems to be very simple: the kinetic energy of any body of mass “m” moving at a velocity “V” is expressible as “½ mV^2”; to come to a stop that energy must be dissipated through the work done by a deceleration force “F” times the distance “d” traveled during the deceleration. However, the kinetic energy possessed by an automobile is much more than would be indicated by a simple determination of its mass “m” from its weight (“m= W/g”). Many components of an automobile possess not only translational kinetic energy, but rotational as well. Thus the simple mass “m” is not the appropriate value needed for kinetic energy determination; there is a greater value “me”, termed the “effective mass”. The calculation of “me” involves the rotational inertia of such components as the wheels, tires, brakes, shafts, bearings, etc. Thus not only the mass of the automobile as a whole, but that of various components, come into play when calculating the amount of kinetic energy which, in turn, determines the magnitude of the deceleration forces required to affect a complete stop in a certain distance. When the deceleration is a matter of braking, certain other vehicle mass properties come into play: the vehicle longitudinal, lateral, and vertical CG. When the deceleration is a matter of crashing, then the vehicle mass density and mass density distribution also have significance. The purpose of this paper is to make explicit the exact role that all the mass properties play in determining the automotive deceleration performance during a crash. This has a direct bearing on the survivability of a crash, which can be enhanced through thoughtful mass properties engineering.\n\nIn 1984, for the 43rd Annual International Conference of the SAWE, this author presented Paper Number 1634, “Mass Properties and Automotive Longitudinal Acceleration”. In that paper the effects upon automotive acceleration of varying the relevant mass property parameters were explored by use of a computer simulation. The computer simulation of automotive longitudinal acceleration allowed for the study of each individual parameter because a simulation allows for the decoupling of the parameters in a way that is not possible physically. The principal mass property parameters involved were the vehicle weight and rotating component inertias, collectively known as the “effective mass”, plus the longitudinal and vertical coordinates of the vehicle center of gravity. However, just as it is important for a vehicle to be able to accelerate, it is perhaps even more important for a vehicle to be able to decelerate. The same mass properties that were relevant to the matter of automotive acceleration are also relevant to the matter of automotive deceleration, a.k.a. braking, although for the braking case that collective of vehicle translational inertia and rotational component inertias known as the “effective mass” requires somewhat different handling. As was the case with automotive acceleration, automotive braking will be explored by use of a computer simulation whereby the effect of variation of each of the mass property parameters can be studied independently. However, this task is considerably easier as the creation of a braking simulation is a minor effort compared to the creation of an acceleration simulation.\n\nThere are a number of automotive performance aspects which are associated with accelerations in the lateral direction: maneuver (transient and steady state), roll-over, and directional stability. For each of these automotive performance aspects certain mass property parameters play significant roles; it is the intent of this paper to make explicit exactly how those mass property parameters affect each of those automotive performance aspects. With regard to maneuver, the maximum lateral acceleration which can be attained in steady-state turning is an important index of performance and safety. The obtaining of high maximum lateral acceleration levels has inherent vehicle weight and center of gravity (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) implications. However, before attaining a steady-state condition, a turning maneuver must first go through a transient phase. When the transient phase is included in the full maneuver picture, the previous list of significant vehicle mass properties parameters acquires two more members: the mass moments of inertia about the roll and yaw axes. For modern passenger vehicles, the lateral acceleration point at which roll-over can occur is generally at a level significantly greater than the maximum lateral acceleration. That is, a modern car will tend to slide out of control long before there is a possibility of overturn. Accidents involving rollover generally occur because the vehicle was “flipped” by obstacles in the roadway, not because the vehicle traction was great enough to reach the critical lateral acceleration level. However, the level at which rollover could occur is still an important index of safety, and the most significant mass property for the determination of that level is the vertical center of gravity. Lastly, there is the matter of directional stability, which has to do with the lateral tire traction force balance front-to-rear, and the front-to-rear “drift angle” relationship of the vehicle tires due to those forces. The lateral force/drift angle relationship is dependent upon normal load, so the most significant mass properties with regard to directional stability are the vehicle weight and static longitudinal and lateral weight distribution. However, the static normal loads are dynamically modified in response to lateral directional “disturbance” forces. Such disturbances generate initial lateral inertial reactions at the vehicle c.g.; the consequent roll moment not only causes lateral changes in the normal load distribution, but also longitudinal changes due to the front-to-rear suspension roll resistance balance. Such changes readjust the initial lateral force/drift angle relationship front-to-rear, and thereby affect the lateral inertial reaction. If this reaction augments the effect of the original disturbance, then the vehicle is termed unstable or “oversteering”; if the reaction is such as to diminish the effect of the original disturbance, then the vehicle is termed stable or “understeering”. Therefore, for directional stability, the primary mass property parameters are the vehicle weight, and total weight distribution (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical).\n\n“Advanced Topics” is Part 8 of a ten part presentation series \"Automotive Dynamics and Design\". The intent is to form a comprehensive series of lectures providing instruction in the design of automobiles from both a practical and a stylistic viewpoint.

Part 9 introduces the concept of Design (a.k.a. Styling), Design Schools, Design Practitioners, Design Process, Exterior Design, Interior Design. Part 10 deals with the business and manufacturing aspects of automotive endeavors: business plan (product, market, cash flow, P&L, capitalization, ROI, etc.), profit and loss statements, break-even analysis, in-house or subcontract decisions, plant location and layout, jigs and fixtures, equipment, supply and inventory, customer service & relations strategy.\n\nThe quantification of automotive directional stability may be expressed through various stability metrics, but perhaps the most basic of these automotive stability metrics is the “Understeer Gradient” (Kus). The Understeer Gradient (in degrees or radians per unit gravity) appears extremely uncomplicated when viewed in its most common formulation: Kus = [Wf / (g Csf)] - [Wr / (g Csr)] This metric appears to depend only on the front and rear axle weight loads (Wf, Wr), and on the front and rear axle cornering stiffnesses (Csf, Csr). However, those last quantities vary with lateral acceleration, and the nature of that variation is dependent upon many other parameters of which some of the most basic are: Total Weight, Sprung Weight, Unsprung Weight, Forward Unsprung Weight, Rear Unsprung Weight, Total Weight LCG, Sprung Weight LCG, Total Weight VCG, Sprung Weight VCG, Track, Front Track, Rear Track, Roll Stiffness, Front Roll Stiffness, Rear Roll Stiffness, Roll Axis Height, Front Roll Center Height, and Rear Roll Center Height. Note that exactly half of these automotive directional stability parameters as listed herein are mass properties. The purpose of this paper is to explore, through a skidpad simulation, the relative sensitivity of automotive directional stability (as quantified through the Understeer Gradient) to variation in each of the noted vehicle parameters, with special emphasis on the mass property parameters. The simulation is constructed in a spreadsheet format from the relevant basic automotive dynamics equations; the normal and lateral loads on the tires are determined as the lateral acceleration is increased incrementally by a small amount (thereby maintaining a “quasi-static” or “steady-state” condition). The normal loads are used for the calculation of the lateral traction force potentials at each tire, with the required (centripetal) lateral traction forces apportioned accordingly. From those required (actual) lateral tire forces the corresponding tire cornering stiffnesses are determined; this determination is based upon a tire model developed through a regression analysis of tire test data. This construction of a fairly comprehensive lateral acceleration simulation from basic automotive dynamic relationships, instead of depending upon commercial automotive software such as “CarSim” (vehicle model) and Pacjeka “Magic Formula” (tire model), constitutes a unique aspect of this paper; this return to basics hopefully provides a clearer view and understanding of the results than would be the case otherwise. Even more unique is this paper’s emphasis on, and exploration of, the role specific mass property parameters play in determining automotive directional stability."
