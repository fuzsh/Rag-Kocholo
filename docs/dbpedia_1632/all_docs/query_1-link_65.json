        "text": "The Brabham BT23B is one of several derivatives of the successful Formula 2 Brabham BT23, and designed for the Coventry Climax FPF engine. Only three were made. Brabham had always provided Climax-engined cars for customers, from the original Intercontinental BT4 through the BT7A and BT11A to the 1966 BT22.\n\nFor 1967, the company marketed a derivative of the new F2 BT23 design with a 2-litre or 2.5-litre Climax engine as the BT23B. The BT23 frame was widened at the rear \"to accommodate the larger gearbox and rubber universals\". This particular car was sold to a Swiss owner but wasn’t often raced.\n\nIt was reported to have suffered an engine failure while testing at Hockenheim at the beginning of October ’67 and not seen for some time. It was next seen in the hands of Franco Sbarro who would later achieve fame as a builder of concept cars and replicas. It had several subsequent engines and owners until bought by the well-known Belgian car builder Willy Widar in 1979. After restoration, it changed hands a few times and in 2010 it was purchased by Australian Trevor Simpson and raced several times by touring car legend John Bowe. It was purchased by current owner Wayne Groeger in November 2021 and competes regularly.\n\nThe Brabham BT23B is one of several derivatives of the successful Formula 2 Brabham BT23, and designed for the Coventry Climax FPF engine.
