Indeed, over the years many of them have advanced the state of the art of all car engines. Thus car enthusiasts of all passions and persuasions will welcome this new overview by an acknowledged expert of fifty classic racing engines from 1913 to 1994. Fully illustrated and described in intimate detail are the power units that have made history in the world of cars and racing. Here is the compact yet complex Ferrari four that won two world championships,\n\nthe Mercedes overhead-cam four whose capture by the British disclosed to Rolls-Royce Germany’s aero-engine secrets before World War I, the famous\n\nFord-Cosworth V8 that took drivers to a baker’s dozen world championships, the two 16-cylinder BRM engines (which so disappointed their makers), the Peugeot four that set a new standard for racingengine design, the astonishing pushrod V8 engine that won Indy for Mercedes-Benz in 1994, and the championship-winning British V8 that an expert called ‘the most straightforward and simple Grand Prix engine ever produced’. This handsome book’s pages teem with the great names of the racing world from Alfa Romeo to Auto Union, Porsche to Maserati, Aston Martin to Honda, BMW to Bugatti. Some of the more obscure yet interesting names are represented as well, such as Cisitalia, Novi, Borgward, Drake-Offy and Lancia. Author Karl Ludvigsen probes deeply into each engine to disclose its key features: its origins, designers and characteristics. Ludvigsen’s knowledgeable text is accessible to enthusiasts at all levels of understanding and interest. A comprehensive glossary is included, as are detailed specifications of the engines described. Opening Classic Racing Engines is a thoughtful and insightful introduction by renowned racing-engine designer Eiji Taguchi. Designs by Taguchi include the 1966-67 RA273E engine and gearbox and, later, Honda’s turbocharged 1'-litre V6, 3%2-litre V10 and V12 Grand Prix engines. In 1998-99 he led Formula | engine design for Sauber Petronas.

If I were selected for a landing party to another planet my first request on arriving would be, “Iake me to your racingengine builders.’ I love racing engines and I love visiting and talking to the people who make them. In the country of my birth, the United States, few trips to Los Angeles failed to include a stop at Meyer-Drake, where I gossiped about racing engines\n\nwith\n\nLeo\n\nGoossen,\n\ngreat\n\nand generous\n\ndesigner of Millers and Offys, and Dale and John Drake. I’ve been to Paxton where the Granatellis developed the fabulous Novi V8s. Down the coast at All-American Racers, John Miller made big power for Dan Gurney. Travers and Coon at Traco in Los Angeles did for Chevrolets what Keith Black did for Chryslers; I visited both. At Reventlow Automobiles I saw the desmodromic Scarab Formula | engine that both Goossen and Traco helped design and make. Back in Indianapolis, Louie and Sonny Meyer were building and developing the four-cam Ford Indy engine.\n\nIn Detroit I visited the ‘skunk works’ of the big companies where Zora Arkus-Duntov invented new engines for Chevrolet, and Ford made pushrod Fairlanes for Indianapolis Lotuses. GM, believe it or not, built special overhead-cam Buick V8s for\n\nMickey Thompson’s 1962 Indy effort, although Mickey never used them. In Livonia was McLaren Engines, where Gary Knutson showed me his blown Offys capable of more than 1,000 horsepower. His data appears in this book. Italy, of course, is horsepower country. When Ferrari racing director Eugenio Dragoni told me about an engine in which he was interested, I asked him where his dynamometer was. ‘In my garage,’ he said. Naturally. Isn’t everyone's? I've seen exotic Lancia and BMW engines at Nardi, tiny high-revving V8s at Giannini near Rome, potent Fiat-based twin-cam engines at Stanguellini, modified straight-eight 14-litre Talbot engines at Platé in Milan and brilliant smalldisplacement screamers at OSCA and Abarth. At\n\nAutodelta Carlo Chiti showed me the stunning flat-12s that powered the successful Alfa Romeo 33-series sports-racers and Formula | Brabhams; they’re in this book. My Maserati racing-engine visits were first in the\n\n250F days and later in the V8 and V12 era. At Ferrari I’ve poked and prodded the V6, V12 and flat-12 racing engines. In fact I managed to get on the wrong side of Enzo Ferrari (fairly easy to do, apparently) not for taking pictures of the dismantled boxer 312B, but for publishing them! Some appear in the following pages. In France I called on Moteur Moderne in Paris (remember their racing V6?) and on Amédée Gordini and Bugatti in the twilight of their great years. I visited Matra at Vélizy, there to see some of the finest racing V12s ever made. Renault Gordini was carrying on the great\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nname with racing V6s for Formula 2 and Le Mans, both at Alpine in Dieppe and at the Gordini works near Paris. There I was introduced to the natal stages of the turbocharged Renault that was to revolutionise Formula 1 racing, an engine described in this book. My visits to Germany were early enough to include Bremen in the heyday of the fuelinjected 16-valve Borgward four (I later owned and raced a Borgward 1500RS). In Ingolstadt I met Richard Kiichen and his magnificent fourcam Formula 2 V8. In Munich I became friends with Alex von Falkenhausen and studied his own engine projects as well as his highly successful BMW racing fours. At Mercedes-Benz I saw the 300SL six on the test bench and learned more of the secrets of the 1954-55 Silver Arrows. Rudy Uhlenhaut showed me where the rotary engines for the Cllls were made. And at AMG I peered inside the special V6s of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class racers in the German Touring Car Championship, and the V12s and V8s of the CLK sports-racing cars. Many Porsche visits included the original four-cam Carrera workshop, the creation of the 1%-litre\n\nflat-8\n\nfor\n\nFormula\n\n1 in\n\n1962,\n\nthe\n\n917’s Type 912 engine and the later turbocharged flat-6s and flat-12s. At Zakspeed near Cologne, Erich Zakowski explained the high-pressure Ford-based engines of his racing Capris, two of which I raced at Hockenheim. He was co-operating with our Ford Motorsport projects, as was Dr Schrick with the development of our RS1700T rally car engine. In Liechtenstein, Max Heidegger built some of the hottest BMW engines. On my visit I saw the Opposite: In the drafting room above Drake Engineering in Los Angeles, Karl Ludvigsen discusses racing engine design with Miller, Novi and Offy engineering wizard Leo Goossen. Above right: During a 1978 visit to Mugen, the company founded by Hirotoshi Honda,\n\nMugen subsequently became a leading Formula 1 engine builder.

In both Switzerland and Germany Michael May revealed the turbocharging advances he had imparted to BMW and Toyota. Tony Rudd and Aubrey Woods at BRM at Bourne in Britain explained their 3-litre Formula 1 V12 development. I later saw Tony at Lotus where he was developing that company’s inclined four for both production and racing. Brian Hart showed me the versatile two-litre four with which he first made his reputation as an independent engine builder. I missed the salad days of Coventry Climax, although with Wally Hassan and Harry Mundy I discussed their designs as well as some new concepts, such as a broad-arrow W12, that Harry was pursuing. I still have the outline of the book on racing engines that Harry and I intended to write together. I think we each thought that the other was writing it! My Cosworth visits began in the years of the DFV\n\nand BDA and continued through the 3.9-litre Group C DFL V8 of the early 1980s, which I encouraged Ford to support financially. Paul Morgan and Mario Illien left Cosworth to set up Ilmor Engineering, which I called upon in its very provisional first months. They now have a wonderful plant for making Mercedes-Benz racing engines. In Japan in the late 1970s I paid a call on Hirotoshi Honda, who then was preparing engines for Japan’s Formula 2 series. In a back room he showed me the disembowelled engines of Honda Formula 1 cars. They were stored there awaiting restoration and rebirth to strut their stuff at classicracing events.\n\nThis was the background when Darryl Reach of Haynes suggested the idea of a book about racing engines. He left it largely to me to propose a list for coverage. I tried to range widely over eras and types of racing in coming up with the highly personal selection in these pages. I hope everyone will find at least some of their favourites discussed, as well as some unusual engines from the past. Where helpful I have not hesitated to draw on engine descriptions I have written for such as Car and Driver and Road & Track. Many thanks to them and to others for encouraging my work in this field. Some descriptions are also adapted from my books on Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Ilmor; from the lastnamed the first part of this Introduction is derived. I couldn’t think of anything more appropriate.\n\n10\n\nAt the Ludvigsen Library I appreciated the help of my colleagues Paul Parker and Miranda Carpenter. I owe warm thanks as well to Tony Merrick, racing-car restorer extraordinaire, who consented to look over the text to help catch the\n\ninevitable glaring gaffes. I am most grateful, Tony. Needless to say, all remaining errors of fact and interpretation are mine.\n\nMany thanks are owed to all those who assisted me with information for this book. Ermanno Cozza of Maserati resolved some details of Maserati specifications, and Riccardo Andreoni did likewise at Ferrari. Tony Rudd helped with information on the BRM V8, and Ted Cutting checked and improved\n\nmy\n\ncopy\n\non\n\nthe racing Aston\n\nMartin\n\nengine. Elvira Ruocco of Alfa Romeo found photos of the 33TT12 and its engine. Yoshihiko Aoyama, general manager of the Honda Collection Hall at Twin Ring Motegi, helped with data on the Honda GP engines. Thanks to him this book contains the first detailed description of the remarkable 1965 Honda V12. Speaking of Honda, I am very pleased to be able to open the book with a thoughtful contribution by Eiji Taguchi, who is not only a great car enthusiast but also an expert racing engine designer. Born in\n\nTokyo in 1938, Taguchi-san joined Honda in 1961 after completing his university studies. In 1964 he moved to Honda’s Research and Development Company to design engines for both production and racing cars. Among designs led by Eiji Taguchi are Honda’s first-generation Accord with its stratified-charge CVCC engine and, in 1966-67, the racing RA273E engine and gearbox. From 1982 to 1998 he designed Honda’s turbocharged 1'%-litre V6, the 3%4-litre V10 and V12 GP engines and a 3-litre V8 for Formula 3000. ‘Taguchi-san was also responsible for the 3%4- and 3-litre V10 Formula | engines built by the Mugen company. He retired from Honda in 1998. In 1999 he joined Sauber Petronas Engineering AG to lead engine design. He is with Ricardo in the UK at the time of writing. Thus his views on the present and future of racing-engine design carry special authority.\n\nKarl Ludvigsen Islington London 2001\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nORIENKOUID by Eiji Taguchi Racing Engines Past and Future hen we unfold the pages of history and look back to the circumstances of the era in which the automobile was created, we are reminded that the first race took place in 1895. It was a race on public roads, as there were as yet no special circuits for the exclusive use of racing cars. The winning Panhard-Levassor, a two-cylinder car of 4 horsepower at 800rpm, completed a round\n\ntrip of 732\n\nmiles\n\n(1,171km)\n\nfrom\n\nParis to\n\nBordeaux at an average speed of 24km/h. Since then motor racing has been evolving continuously for more than a century, except for the periods during the two world wars. What kinds of goals spurred the engineers of the past to try to make highly competitive engines? The goal was ‘to win’, which is simple and clear enough, but their opponents also had the same idea. Thus they had to assume that their opposition had made similar efforts in their research and development, hoping to take a step forward — or even half a step. In my view the essential elements that can be considered as the key racing-engine technologies from the perspective of history are the following:\n\n1. The reduction of losses due to mechanical friction Engineers made much use of ball and roller bearings, and sought to optimise the ratio of the stroke to the bore. Also, the displacement per single cylinder evolved toward a range between 180 and 400cc. There is a unique exception in the success of the light and compact Coventry Climax 2%-litre 4-cylinder engine, with its 625cc cylinder. In this instance the chassis built by Cooper with its mid-engined layout — plus the expert abilities of Jack Brabham — played a major part.\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\n2. The improvement of charging efficiency Reintroducing the 4-valve combustion chamber improved charging or volumetric efficiency. Also, the design of the inlet port was altered to achieve the major objective of exploitation of the best use of the inertia of the incoming gas to improve aspiration.\n\n3. Efficiency in reducing weight Weight was reduced by, for example, employing water jackets made of thin sheet metal, and the introduction of high-strength materials following new developments.\n\nActor James Garner, left, is among the onlookers as Richie Ginther drives a 1966 Honda Grand Prix car into the\n\npaddock at Monza. Its shrieks cause some nearby to protect their eardrums.\n\n11\n\n4. The development of the fuelling system Progress from carburettors to fuel injection has improved performance.\n\n5. The use of electronics In the modern era the development, rapid introduction and expansion of the application of electronics have all greatly improved overall engine performance, especially as regards fuel consumption, an increasingly important parameter. All the above are key technologies. An engine can never prevail when only one of them is excellent. Achieving a balance among all of them at a high level is absolutely essential. As is well known, until very recently many technologies that have been used in racing have already been running on the roads as well, as if they were quite banal. Lately, however, production vehicles have been subject to retrograde development. Engine management is a good example. In order to pass the increasingly strict regulations that control exhaust emissions, enginemanagement progress has been remarkable. But it has not been able to contribute to specific engine performance. What role has Honda played in this story? Based on the evidence of the results achieved, it may be said that its role was as a leader in the use of high-\n\nes\n\nne\n\nnm\n\nDesigned by Eiji Taguchi, the engine of the 1966 Honda RA273E was a V12 with its cylinder banks set at 90°. It produced 400bhp at 10,500rpm.\n\n12\n\nspeed engines in all of these periods. As the essential elements of its technology one could mention, of course, the use of multiple cylinders, the shaping of an inlet port that can draw in a lot of air, and the enlargement of the effective aperture area of the inlet and exhaust valves. The engineering of the support provided for the roller bearings used in the bottom end has been an essential element of Honda technology. Honda can take pride in the invention of the control technique by which an engine can achieve its optimum performance, including a fuel-injection system which was an in-house design. Of course, research into materials is another important element. In particular the development of materials with high strength has been carried out continuously by Honda since the 1960s. In recent years development has been dedicated to durability and reliability. For each new engine, long-distance circuit testing has become commonplace from the outset. With other engine makers following Honda’s example in this respect, it is evident that the frequency of blown-up engines in F] racing has been greatly reduced. Above all, the marriage of science with enthusiasm is the driving force. Success depends on how you weigh their degree of importance. It is quite a tricky matter to forecast the direction that racing-engine technology may take in the future, but it is difficult to envisage that there will be a sudden leap. If there is, what kind of factors may be considered? I will suggest a few. 1. The question of whether rapid combustion can be achieved by creating a really compact combustion chamber offering an improvement in combustion Generally, the present shape of the four-valve-type combustion chamber is the pent-roof type or a modification thereof. Around the mid-1960s, BMW experimentally employed a radial four-valve head for the four-cylinder engine that it used in Formula 2 at that time, the ‘Apfelbeck’ engine described in this book. In this system the four valves are positioned in a radial formation, producing a semi-spherical combustion chamber. In the world of motorcycling, the 250cc singlecylinder Honda was produced on a commercial scale, with an engine fitted with a similar radialvalve head. Elaborate design techniques and\n\nFOREWORD\n\ndifficulties are involved in creating an ideal combustion chamber of multi-cylinder semispherical type, but it is thought that this will be one of the chosen techniques. 2. Further evolution of control technology Peak engine revolutions have reached the present level by exploiting the changes that have already been mentioned. From this point on, proceeding on the assumption of 10 cylinders, we are now being catapulted into the world of 18,000rpm and, when shifting up, 500rpm higher. Drivers demand not only top-end performance but also medium-speed torque at one and the\n\nsame time. Therefore the designer should invent something to provide that. Among the systems that may facilitate this, a technology that achieves a more variable control than at present will be necessary. Also, in order to help the engine operate at its optimum level whatever the conditions may be, it may become necessary to be able to control the water cooling, the temperature and/or the pressure of the oil and/or fuel. 3. It might be possible to make a much more optimal design In today’s world of design and development, the drawings that were used in former years are nowhere to be seen. Everything is done by computer design. Functionally, both twodimensional drawings and_ three-dimensional sketches can easily be drawn on the screen. A number of other techniques are available to support engineering in the course of the design process. Among these are the forecasting of horsepower, the formation and the nature of the mixture of fuel and air after they are ejected from the injector, and the flow condition of the coolant in the interior passages of a complex engine. In addition the calculation of the degree of strength of all components will become feasible. These are among the techniques which will make it possible to produce a racing engine of high efficiency which also has high reliability and power. So far we have been considering engines from a number of different angles. However, needless to say you do not have the winning car just by virtue of its engine. This book provides ample examples\n\nof that. I think it is important to harmonise the essential elements of the total ‘package’ at a higher level: namely the engine, the chassis, the special aerodynamic features, the tyres and the skill of the driver. When each of the above is focused upon, it is seen as having its own strong individual character. I believe that results will surely follow. A magnificent symphony will be heard, harmonised by the skills and abilities of the conductor who combines these essential elements. Taguchi's RA273E was further developed for the 1967 season, during which it was photographed at Zandvoort by Ted Eves.\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\n13\n\nWoO TS\n\n14\n\nPEUGEOT\n\nI\n\nB-EITRE\n\nHOUR\n\new designs from Peugeot just before the outbreak of the Great War transformed the technology of the racing engine. Formerly a backward provincial car maker, Peugeot regained momentum in 1910 when two formerly-separate branches of the family firm were reunited to create SA des Automobiles and Cycles Peugeot — the forebear of the Peugeot company we know today. Peugeot became France’s second-largest motor company after the fast-growing Renault. Robert Peugeot, a son of the company’s cofounder, was responsible for the implementation of\n\nPeugeot’s racing programme. He set up a separate dedicated unit on the west side of Paris at Suresnes to produce racing cars. The racing Peugeots were assembled there from parts made by skilled subcontractors throughout the Paris periphery. This was a new idea, as The Automobile Engineer explained in 1914: ‘The Peugeot Company determined that it would make a great name in racing regardless of cost, and consequently the special racing factory was set up and the problem of racing car building dealt with as an entirely separate and complete business.’ Robert Peugeot had strong support from racing drivers Jules Goux and Georges Boillot, as well as from Paolo Zuccarelli who had just come over from the successful Hispano-Suiza team. Their radical ideas about engine design were interpreted by a 26-year-old Swiss engineer, Ernest Henry. Geneva-born Henry had contributed to the advanced Swiss Picker engines that powered racing hydroplanes. This team created two new racers for the 1912 season: a 7.6-litre Grand Prix car and a smaller 3litre model, the L3, to suit the Voiturette category, which since 1911 was for cars of that engine size. In its first embodiment the 1912 Peugeot 3-litre was unsuccessful, but when revised for 1913, as the L3 bis (referred to here as the L3 for simplicity’s sake), it was a fine performer out of all proportion to its size.\n\nThese Peugeots were the first cars of any kind to combine a vee-inclined overhead-valve cylinder head with four valves per cylinder and twin overhead camshafts — the hallmarks of many later high-performance engines. To these characteristics the L3 added a train of gears to drive the camshafts, another ingredient that was to be common to most purebred racing engines for\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\ndecades to come. In 1912 the Peugeot engines had been equipped with vertical shaft drives to their camshafts. Its achievements on the track testified to the excellence of Peugeot’s new conception of a racing car. One L3 won the 1913 Coupe de l’Auto race for Voiturettes at Boulogne, defeating a strong field over a 387-mile distance, while a sister car placed second. A lone L3 at Indianapolis in 1914 placed second among cars with engines almost twice as large, and averaged 8] mph for the 500 miles. With its normal two-seater body the L3 was timed at 94mph and with a narrower body it set new Class E records at Brooklands at better than 105mph and touched 107mph on some runs. The engine that powered this exceptional Peugeot may fairly be regarded as the most advanced to be built before the Great War. This can be said Opposite above: The 1913 although its cylinder dimensions Peugeot L3 had narrow bodywork that extended were in the tradition of the time towards the rear to at 78 x 156mm (3.07 x 6.14in), accommodate a mechanic as with the stroke exactly twice the well as the driver. bore. Displacement was 2,982cc and the compression\n\nratio was\n\nOpposite below: Although the configuration would become common — even obvious — in the very near future, the Peugeot L3’s combination of twin overhead camshafts driven by gears from the crankshaft was revolutionary in 1913.\n\n5.6:1. Two main elements comprised the in-line four: a thin-wall cast-iron block with an integral cylinder head, and a cast-aluminium crankcase with integral bearers at front and rear that tied it to a sub-frame carried between the Peugeot’s frame rails. As viewed from the front of the engine, the block was offset 20mm to the right in the désaxe position which was thought to minimise piston side thrust and maximise leverage on the crankshaft during the expansion stroke. A groove on the left side of the bottom of each cylinder gave the required clearance for the connecting rod. The small bore left ample spaces between the cylinders for studs and nuts on both sides of each such space to attach the block to the crankcase. New in the 1913 design, the crankcase was a one-piece barrel, utterly circular in cross-section and, as a result, rigid and smooth to swirling lubricant. Detachable covers at the front and rear of the crankcase admitted the crankshaft and carried a ball bearing, two of the three bearings supporting\n\nUs)\n\nri geneoenie?\n\nfe\n\noe —— 3\n\n=a\n\nthe shaft. Machined in two parts of BND steel, alloyed with chrome and nickel, the crankshaft was joined together at its centre by a tapered section secured by a bolt within a third ball bearing. This bearing’s outer race was carried by a bronze diaphragm which was inserted with the crank from the rear of a heated crankcase. When cold the diaphragm was an interference fit. It was retained securely by five large bolts, radially disposed. Ernest Henry’s use of ball bearings for the crankshaft on 50mm journals made an important contribution to higher crankshaft speeds. He kept plain white-metal bearings on 50mm journals for the connecting-rod big ends, which were lubricated by oil thrown from the mains and caught by slinger rings. The I-section rod was 261mm long and had a two-bolt big end. Its small end was split so that it could be clamped around the 13mm gudgeon pin. Machined from a steel billet, the full-skirted piston carried two compression rings of 4mm width. The crankcase was equipped with generous breathers on its left-hand side. Slots in its bottom delivered oil to a shallow sump and a unique lubrication system. The crankshaft nose powered a short cross-shaft which drove a reciprocating pump with a steel ringed piston in a bronze housing. Oil was contained in a reservoir under the driver’s seat which was supplied by this pump. The latter’s large capacity meant that it maintained, through a regulator, pressure in the reservoir which delivered oil back to the engine. It did so through six feed tubes incorporating sight-glasses on the dashboard which allowed driver and mechanic to\n\n16\n\nverify the flow. Thus Henry contrived to provide a dry-sump lubrication system that needed only a single oil pump. At the front of the engine a two-piece aluminium case, attached to the block by eight studs, carried the spur-gear drive to the camshafts. The narrow gears, drilled for lightness, ran on roller bearings. From the right side of this train a half-speed gear drove a Mea high-tension magneto, at the front, and the water pump to the rear, mounted on the crankcase. The pump delivered coolant to the bottom of the left, exhaust, side of the block’s integral water jacket. The magneto sparked a single plug at the centre of the four valves. At the top of the block, each hollow camshaft was carried by three inserted white-metal bearings in a split aluminium housing which was mounted above the head by rows of paired pylons. Guides in the base of each housing carried short pushrods which in turn were pressed down by long fingertype cam followers. Each of these had its own small coil spring to hold it against the cam lobe. The pushrod extended down to contact the stem of the valve, which was closed by a pair of coil springs exposed to the breezes. The four valves per cylinder were equally inclined at an included angle of 60°. This moderate angle, in combination with the removable valve guides, allowed the valves to be extracted from the closed-end cylinder. Sized identically for inlets and exhausts, the valves were generously dimensioned at 40mm. Valve lift was 9mm and the timing was as follows:\n\nPEUGEOT\n\nL3 3-LITRE FOUR\n\nInlet opens\n\n3°ATDC_\n\nExhaust opens\n\n56°BBDC\n\nInlet closes\n\n40°ABDC\n\nExhaust closes\n\n12°ATDC\n\nThus there was a small amount of overlap past top dead centre, at that time a novel idea. The exhaust cam lobes imposed higher accelerations and a longer peak opening period than the inlet cams. Around the valves the water jacketing was minimal, being principally designed to ensure that the spark plug was surrounded by coolant. Within the block the inlet ports for the front and rear cylinder pairs were siamesed to create a long oval opening. To these two ovals the inlet manifold was attached. Suspended from its centre was a single updraught Claudel carburettor with a rotating-barrel throttle that left no obstruction when it was fully open. These were the characteristics of an engine which produced 92bhp at 2,900rpm, a high speed for the period. Only a year or two earlier it was customary for racing-car engines to be satisfied with 2,000rpm. It also produced better than 30 horsepower per litre; the best Grand Prix engines before the war managed no better than 25bhp per litre — even those from the same team of designers that had produced the L3. In addition to being innovative, the Peugeot L3 was also an inspired creation.\n\nOpposite above: Seen later in the Briggs Cunningham Collection with inappropriately large-section tyres, the 1913 Peugeot voiturette showed her stuff at Indianapolis in 1914 by finishing second with only 3 litres against rivals with engines as large as 7 litres.

Engine size would be limited to 4,500cc — the first such capacity limit in Grand Prix racing. Lyons would have a full entry of five Daimler-built Mercedes cars, the most allowed, and there was little time to design and build them. Daimler chief engineer Paul Daimler and his team soon realised that to stand a chance of success they would have to use much higher crankshaft speeds than their previous racing engines had attempted. New four-cylinder engines to meet this challenge were designed by Daimler’s automotive staff and manufactured and tested by its aero-engine staff, which was well acquainted with the construction methods used. Preoccupation with the challenge of high engine speeds, up to 3,500rpm, shows in every detail of the engine’s design. The crankshaft was carried in five main bearings, 46mm in diameter and white-metal-lined. Integral with the bottom half of the aluminium crankcase, the main bearing caps were pulled tight by long studs through the upper half of the crankcase to the top surface, where the individual cylinders were attached. With symmetrical cheeks on each throw and small circular weight masses opposite the rod journals, the one-piece crankshaft showed close attention to counterbalancing, a completely new art. Nevertheless the crankshafts weren’t reliable at 3,500rpm until they were made from a special Aquila steel supplied by the Austrian firm of Danner. Carrying white-metal bearings cast into removable bronze shells, the big ends of the Isection connecting rods were held together by four bolts each, a novelty at Daimler. They ran on 48mm journals. Like those then used in aero engines, the pistons were cast iron. One firm had entered an engine with aluminium pistons in the 1913 Kaiserpreis aero-engine competition but was refused entry on the ground that a metal with such a low melting point couldn’t possibly stand up to an engine’s combustion temperature! Nevertheless Mercedes built aluminium pistons for this Grand Prix engine (works type M93654) and tested them with complete satisfaction. The final decision as to whether to use them was left to the drivers — three\n\nCLASSI@C\n\nRACING\n\nENGINE'S\n\nof whom doubled as master mechanics. They elected to stay with the proven iron design. Driver option may also have accounted for the apparent presence in some engines of pistons with one bronze ring below the gudgeon pin, in others pistons with two rings below. The iron rings were above the pin, which floated in a bushing lubricated by an oil pipe running the length of the rod shank. Lubrication was provided by a battery of pistontype oil pumps driven by a transverse shaft at the back of the sump. These served the bottom end of the engine. One of them delivered oil to the main and rod bearings at more than 30psi. Another scavenged oil from the front part of the sump to the main basin at the rear; the total capacity within the engine was four litres. A third pump metered fresh oil into the engine, at the pressure pump, from a reserve tank in the cockpit with an 1 1-litre capacity. Opposite above: Equipped To minimise the effects of with front-wheel brakes, the 1914 Mercedes 18/100 was torsional resonances, Paul still capable of winning in Daimler placed the vertical shaft 1922 when Count Masetti drive to the overhead camshaft at drove it to victory in Sicily’s the rear or output end of the Targa Florio. engine.

An additional set of bevels drove a brace of magnetos, placed to the right and left of the shaft. Previously, Daimler had made its engine cylinders in pairs. Individual steel cylinders for the M93654 were easier to make in small quantities (a fault in one cylinder scrapped only one, not two) and better suited to the even cylinder spacing of the five-main bearing engine. Each cylinder was fully machined from a steel forging and taperthreaded into a thin-wall cylinder-head casting. The water jacketing was welded around this assembly. The cylinders were symmetrical with individual 39mm ports serving 43mm valves — two inlets and two exhausts per cylinder.\n\n19\n\nEach valve on the Mercedes was closed by a single coil spring, retained by a collar with threaded keepers. From the single central camshaft a forked rocker arm operated both inlet valves from one lobe. Individual lobes and rockers opened the exhaust valves. Timing was as follows:\n\nInlet opens\n\nTDC\n\nExhaust opens\n\nInlet closes\n\n35°ABDC\n\nExhaust closes\n\n50°BBDC 9°ATDC\n\nThe hollow camshaft was carried rigidly in five long bronze bushings, supported within the castbrass housing that tied the heads of the cylinders together. The housing also provided enclosures for the cams and rocker pivots. An independent total-loss system catered to the oiling needs of the top end. With his foot the riding mechanic manipulated a plunger pump that delivered dollops of oil through a labyrinth of pipes to the rocker chambers, the cam drive shaft and —\n\nThis first four-valve Mercedes cylinder head was clearly responsive to the racing successes of the contemporary French Peugeots. No four-valve aircraft engine had yet been made by the new Daimler factory that was then being built for that purpose at Sindelfingen. German as well as French four-valve aero precedents existed, including the impressive engines built by Benz for the 1910 Prince Heinrich Trials.\n\n20\n\nthrough fittings in the bases of the cylinders — the thrust face of each piston. Oil delivery was meticulously apportioned by calibrated flow restrictors in the system’s manifolding. A cockpit valve could be turned to direct the foot pump’s oil delivery to critical chassis points, including the worm-and-nut steering gear and the rear axle. But when the pressure was on during a race both driver and mechanic relied on oil and yet more oil to the engine to stave off high-speed seizures. The 1914 Mercedes puffed smoke frequently around the Lyons circuit and in the last laps, in a battle with Peugeot, the leading Mercedes left an uninterrupted blue-white cloud behind it. Daimler would not allow a little oil to stand between it and success in the single Grand Prix in which these cars competed. Fortunately for continued ignition under these conditions each cylinder was amply endowed with spark plugs. Two were on the inlet side of each chamber and a single one was on the exhaust side, where there was a boss for a fourth if needed. Between them the two magnetos generated enough sparks to fire two plugs simultaneously, and to deliver a double spark to the third one. Testing in Germany on a steep upgrade confirmed that the first plugs fitted weren't up to the job at high engine speeds. The Eisemann firm produced a new type of mica-insulated plug with platinum electrodes that gave satisfaction.\n\nMERCEDES\n\n18/100\n\n4.5-LITRE\n\nFOUR\n\nInduction was by a single updraught carburettor on the right side, with a barrel throttle. It fed a Y-shaped copper manifold with a large balance pipe between the cylinders. A small gearbox-driven air pump pressurised the fuel tank after a mechanic worked a hand pump to build up initial pressure for starting. Two separate fuel lines ran from the tank to the float bowl so that an alternative was available in case one became fouled or damaged. A faired manifold to a pipe straight to the rear provided a light, simple and effective exhaust solution. The M93654 type designation of this 4,483cc four was derived from the engine’s dimensions of 93 x 165mm (3.66 x 6.50in), followed by the number of cylinders. A power curve taken on engine number 1005, running on a blend of petrol and benzol, showed a peak of 105.5bhp at 3,100rpm. (After World War I for racing in the 1920s the engine’s power was increased to 115bhp, a figure which is often quoted for it.) At 2,000rpm its power was 81bhp and its torque 209|b ft. Brake mean effective pressure at that speed was 11 5psi. The type designation of the vehicle, 18/100, signified taxable horsepower of 18 and maximum power of a nominal 100bhp. ‘The sweetest music that I have ever heard is the song of this engine,’ reminisced driver Christian Lautenschlager, ‘although at 3,500 the vibration was pure hell.’ He said that his, the victorious engine at Lyons, was the only one in the team to have such a strong vibration at its peak speed.\n\nSix Mercedes 18/100s were built in time for the 1914 race, of which one served as a training car. They were granted little or no chance to win against the proven Peugeots, competing on their home ground. Yet they defeated 32 cars of a dozen different marques and __ finished one-two-three (Lautenschlager, Louis Wagner, Otto Salzer) in the last great race before motor competition was wiped off the European map by a world conflict. Over more than seven hours of racing and 468 miles, the white Mercedes broke the speed and spirit of their opposition by sheer tenacity. It was a lesson the rest of the Grand Prix world would not soon forget.

It nevertheless finished and indeed covered another 10.7-mile safety lap. That’s toughness. And other Duesies of the four entered finished fourth and sixth. That a team of four American racing cars could travel to France to compete in this great race was facilitated by the congruency, since 1920, between the rules of American competition, including the Indianapolis 500 miles, and those of Grand Prix racing.

The centre main was also plain, in a two-piece housing drawn up to the block by cap screws. The rear main was a number 220 ball bearing with a 7in outer diameter, nested into the rear bulkhead of the block and retained by a cover. This accepted the thrust loadings from the adjacent clutch inside a flywheel which was cap-screwed to the end of the crankshaft. The latter, machined from a single steel billet, was configured like two four-cylinder crankshafts placed end-to-end with one rotated 90° with respect to the other. eh Opposite above: Jimmy ; . : The two plain main bearings y4yrphy’s victory at Le Mans\n\ntheir 3-litre engines, and Duesenberg was on the\n\nwere\n\nbrink of introducing a straight-eight production car as well, its Model A.

The first 3-litre Duesenberg eights placed third, fourth and sixth at Indy in 1920 and one of the cars placed second in the 1921 ‘500’ two months before the French race. In design their engines were scaled down from a 5-litre predecessor, which in turn had been inspired by work that Fred and August Duesenberg had done during the war on 16cylinder aviation engines. To the eyes of Europeans, accustomed as they were to admire elaboration and complexity for their own sake, the Duesenberg engine looked absurdly simple. It made only sparing use of light alloys. Aluminium was employed for the cam cover, the shallow ribbed sump and the finned covers for the water jackets on both sides of the block. Aluminium was employed as well for two covers on the left side of the crankcase through which the pistons and rods could be withdrawn for servicing; these were fitted with tall crankcase breathers. Otherwise the two main castings, the block and the detachable cylinder head, were made of grey iron by a specialist foundry in Chicago.

Measuring 8%in (222.3mm) from centre to centre, the rod had a split small-end so that it could be clamped around the %in (19.lmm) gudgeon pin, which used the aluminium piston as bearing material. Pressure oil was supplied to the crankshaft by borings in the block to the two plain bearings. The further transfer of oil to the rod big-ends was achieved in an unusual way. The crankshaft webs\n\n23\n\nbetween the offset rod journals were completely circular. Machined into the periphery of each was a groove Ath of an inch wide and %«th of an inch deep. Covered by a ring — initially of copper and later of steel — shrunken into position and soldered, this groove formed the oil passage between the bigends. The other crank webs carried counterweights. At the nose of the crank a small bevel gear drove another bevel at engine speed, and a short shaft running downward to the pumps. Twin gear-type pumps were provided for the dry-sump oiling system. Pressurised oil was supplied to the front bearing of the single overhead camshaft, from which it travelled through the hollow shaft to the cam’s other bearings. A passage delivered oil to the shaft on which the valve rocker arms pivoted. A trough below the camshaft collected oil which bathed the cam lobes before draining through the housing that carried the cam drive shaft. Below the oil pumps was the centrifugal water pump, which delivered coolant to the cylinder block’s left front aluminium side plate. From there it flowed back through the block and up to the head through an aperture at the very rear. Intermediate apertures between block and head\n\nwere avoided for fear that the water column in the long straight-eight engine would confuse coolant flow when the Duesenberg’s powerful four-wheel hydraulic brakes were applied.\n\n24\n\nFrom the crank’s nose bevel gear another shaft ran upward, at engine speed, to a half-speed bevel at the top that drove the single overhead cam. Running in ball bearings, with a steadying plain bearing at its centre, the shaft had its own aluminium housing. A skew gear just below the steady bearing drove a small aviation-type Delco dynamo to top up the 8-volt battery for the engine’s coil ignition system. The Delco distributor was driven by a skew gear from the centre of the camshaft and projected from the left side of the head. There it was conveniently placed for the leads to the spark plugs, which projected horizontally into the inlet side of the combustion chamber. Following the precedent of their aviation-engine designs, the Duesenbergs gave the 3-litre engine one inlet and two exhaust valves. They judged that this gave adequate inlet area while helping to dissipate the heat to which the exhaust valves were subjected. The latter were made of a cobaltchrome steel alloy and were 27mm in diameter. Tungsten was alloyed with the steel of the single\n\nDUBSENBERG\n\n3 LITRE\n\nEG\n\nHop\n\ninlet valve, which had a 39mm head. The valves were symmetrically inclined at an included angle of 60° in a chamber that was recessed deeply into the cylinder head. Twin coil springs closed each valve. The thin-wall aluminium piston was fullyskirted except for cutaways at the sides of its skirt\n\nthat allowed it to be removed for servicing, past the crankshaft, through the access apertures in the crankcase. Although at the time of the Le Mans race the piston was two-ringed, three rings were later fitted. Protruding well into the chamber, the piston crown was varied in height to adjust the compression ratio, which for Le Mans was a modest 5.2:1. Running the length of the head, above the camshaft, was a shaft carrying the rocker arms that operated the valves. The cast-steel rocker arms were roller-tipped where they contacted the cam lobe and had high multiplication ratios that gave lift at the valve of 9.5mm for the inlets and 7.9mm for the exhausts. The inlet rocker was T-sectioned. The paired exhaust valves were opened by a forked rocker arm which was drilled, down the centre of each arm, for lightness. Valve clearance was adjusted by filing the tips of the valve stems, although it was not unknown for a mechanic in a hurry to ‘adjust’ clearance by tweaking the rocker arm. Induction on the GP-winning car was through two updraught Miller carburettors whose barreltype throttles were joined by a shaft in torsion. Through a two-branch manifold each fed two ports in the head, within which the inlet ports were siamesed. The ports from the two exhaust valves were siamesed within the head as well, to deliver to an eight-branch exhaust manifold. Their light reciprocating parts helped these\n\nengines reach new highs of crankshaft speed. Before the war no Grand Prix engine developed its peak power at more than 3,000rpm. In sharp contrast the Duesenberg developed its 115bhp output at 4,250rpm and was capable of revving to an astonishing 5,000rpm. Observers at Le Mans remarked that the engines seemed ‘infinitely flexible’, which was a benefit with their less-versatile three-speed gearboxes against the four-speeders fitted by others. They were also distinguished by the ‘machine-gun-like crackle of their exhaust.’ The Americans had come, seen, won — and been heard from.\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\nae\n\nLh\n\n0\n\n—SS\n\n6\n\n§&? 6\n\noon.\n\nTi\n\nea\n\noe\n\nB.\n\nE-VESseo | (@\n\nSHEE\n\n@\n\n\\\n\nOpposite left: Equipped with four-wheel brakes, the 1921 Duesenberg raced without a spare wheel on board.

Water jackets were cast integral, receiving coolant from a gallery along the right or inlet side running just below the horizontal spark plugs. Water was drawn off the tops of the blocks by a gallery cast into the cambox, also on the inlet side of the engine. Laurence Pomeroy, Jr memorably wrote of the Type 35 that ‘there can be few successful racing engines which have run with so little water in contact with so many hot spots.’ Within each block the cylinders were siamesed; no water flowed between them. The importance of adequate water flow around the valve seats was overlooked, with the result that block cracking was not unusual. Mounted at the engine’s left front and driven by skew gears from the vertical shaft, the water pump was of elegant large-diameter design. While each of the eight exhaust valves opened directly on its own port and exhaust pipe, the inlet ports were\n\nIIT LIL SPILT ILLIA\n\np\n\n— eeezeaesesag2 9\n\nare Qj3\n\nsiamesed into two external apertures\n\nfor each block. Each of these pairs was fed by its own manifold and carburettor, with a small balance tube connecting the two manifolds. Carburettors were side-draught, either 35mm Solex units or 36mm Zeniths of ‘triple diffuser’ design with a separate internal venturi to improve fuel vaporisation. To the same end the inlet manifolds were water-jacketed at their centres. Fuels used were proprietary blends of methanol, benzol and acetone such as Elcosine and Dynamin. They were supplied to the carburettors by pressure in the fuel tank generated by a small camshaft-driven pump. A pattern of ten nuts on short studs attached each block to the top of the barrel-sectioned aluminium crankcase. These nuts were in grooves along the bottom of each block, which were covered by an aluminium strip spring-clipped in place to preserve the elegant rectilinear contours of Above: Visible in the sections of the crankshaft are the slinger rings and passages that provided oil to the Bugatti's big-end roller bearings.

The crankcase was split at the crank centreline. Its bottom portion was an elaborate and deep casting with a finned bottom that constituted the engine’s wet sump. From front to rear through the sump ran an array of aluminium tubes providing cooling air to the castor oil which all Bugattis used. The sump casting itself provided the supporting caps for the front and rear of the Type 35’s five main bearings. Individual bearing caps were supplied for the centre three mains. All the main\n\nbearings were\n\nanti-friction:\n\nfront, rear and\n\ncentre were double-row ball bearings with their own inner and outer races, while the other two —\n\nthose at the centre of each set of four cylinders — were crowded |]mm rollers running directly on a hardened 63.5mm crankshaft journal and in a very deep split outer race which had its own clamping bolts. Big-end bearings were anti-friction also, each having 17 rollers in bronze cages running on a 45mm crank journal. This and the use of a central ball bearing required the crankshaft to be built up. Bugatti achieved this by the design and precision machining of removable components to make two identical four-cylinder crankshafts which were joined in the centre bearing by a taper. The same taper was used to attach the pot-type flywheel and the clutch that it enclosed. The sections of each four-cylinder crank were firmly and accurately wedged together by pins with tapered flats that were drawn up by nuts. A gauze filter cleansed the oil reaching the main bearings at the modest pressure of 15psi. This was supplied by a gear-type pump driven at one-fifth engine speed by a skew gear at the nose of the crank. Oil escaping from the main bearings was caught by circular grooves in the crank webs. Bores from these ‘slinger rings’ supplied the oil to the rod bearings. Slender and machined all over, the I-section connecting rods were 185mm long. Their stiffening rib ran right around the big end, which was of 61mm diameter. The small end was hardened to bear directly on the surface of the 16mm gudgeon pin. This was carried in a short, fully-skirted Bugatti-made piston. Flat-topped, it typically gave\n\nCLAS SIG\n\nRACING\n\nSEN GINE'S:\n\na compression ratio of 6.0:1. Two compression rings and one oil ring were above the pin and a second oil ring was at the bottom of the skirt.\n\nIgnition was by magneto, usually SEV, this component being mounted in the car’s cowl and driven by a shaft with flexible couplings from the back of the camshaft. The shaft was equipped with a Bugatti-designed mechanism that allowed the driver to advance and retard the ignition using a cockpit control. Rated at 100bhp at 5,000rpm, the unblown 2litre Type 35 engine could be revved safely to 6,000, giving its driver an ample margin for error. Modest though this output was, it could be counted on to be delivered reliably by a wellmaintained engine. It was also put to good use by the Type 35’s excellent chassis. Its frame stiffness was enhanced by the bottom half of the engine’s crankcase, which was solidly anchored to the side members at four points. The Type 35 also had room for development. Equipped with a three-lobe Roots-type blower it became the 35C, which enjoyed 14 victories in major events in the seasons from 1928 through 1930 when Grand Prix racing was run without specific displacement limits. In all, nearly 400 of the Type 35 and its derivatives were built by Bugatti — a record for GP car production that will stand for all time.

Not well at all. The cars were not even ready for the most important race of 1926, the French Grand Prix at Miramas, which went down in history as the poorest-attended GP in history: only three Bugattis started. And when they did race the Delages parboiled their unfortunate drivers. Backed by the wealthy and flamboyant Louis Delage, Lory lost no time in extensively revising the racers for the 1927 season. With driver Robert Benoist, the 14-litre Delages swept all before them in 1927. Thereafter Delage retired them with the exception of one car which he entered for Louis Chiron at Indianapolis in 1929, gaining a rewarding seventh place. Young British racing star Richard Seaman acquired another in 1935. Rebuilt and lightened, it was the scourge of the Voiturette category in 1936 - a decade after its conception. Here, clearly, was an exceptional racing car. Built low with an offset seat to suit the new rules of the 1%-litre Grand Prix Formula that took effect in 1926, the Delage chassis was conventional by the standards of the 1920s. What excited admiration was its engine. Albert Lory had assisted Charles Planchon in the development of an ambitious 2-litre V12 GP engine for the preceding Formula. Assisted by Gaultier, Lory was given free rein by Delage to create a new car and its engine under the type number 15-S-8. Compared to the V12, Lory both shortened the stroke and increased the bore by near enough 4mm each to arrive at the dimensions of 55.8 x 76.0mm (2.20 x 2.99in) for a straight-eight of 1,487cc. The in-line eight was the most popular racing-engine configuration in the 1920s; not for another decade would designers begin considering vee-eights. As originally built in 1926 the Delage eight produced 160bhp at 7,500rpm on a fuel consisting of 40 per cent benzol, 40 per cent petrol, 20 per cent alcohol and a ‘zest’ of ether to assist starting. Output in 1927 rose to 170bhp from an engine which was\n\ncapable of revving safely to 8,000. The 15-S-8 was supercharged by a large single Roots-type blower extending forward from the front of the camshaft gear train, which was at the front of the engine. Running at engine speed, the blower had a capacity of 1.4 litres with its two-lobed rotors 220mm long. The heavy finning of its\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\naluminium housing and its forward placement were both intended to keep the compressor cool, and thus further increase the density of the incoming charge. This was an air/fuel mixture, for the blower drew from a large horizontal Cozette carburettor on its left. A delivery pipe from the blower ran back along the right side of the engine to the centre of an eight-branch inlet manifold, which was fabricated from steel. At its centre was a blow-off valve to protect the manifolding and blower from backfires. It could also trap the unprepared Delage driver by popping open — and stalling the engine — when he was making a racing start. The maximum boost pressure was moderate at 7psi or about half an atmosphere. Compression ratio was 6.5:1.\n\nAfter entering the combined block and cylinder head the fresh charge had to slope upward before curving Opposite above: The striking around to enter the lines of the 1927 Grand Prix combustion chamber through Delage were reflected on the wet the single inlet valve which — surface of the Miramas track in like the exhaust — was steeply southern France.

A central 18mm spark plug communicated with the chamber through an 8mm aperture.\n\nValve timing of the Delage eight was as follows: Inlet opens\n\n18°BTDC\n\nExhaust opens 58°BBDC\n\nInlet closes\n\n50°ABDC\n\nExhaust closes 25°ATDC\n\nThis gave top-end overlap of 43°. Valve lift was 7mm. A single iron casting comprised\n\nthe Delage’s complete head-block unit, extending down to the bottom of the cylinders and up almost to the tops of the triple-coil valve springs. Within it the cylinder spacings were equal save for a larger gap at the centre of the row of eight. At their bottoms the water jackets were cast open, allowing better control of the cores, and closed later by steel sheets retained by screws. Flow was provided around the spark plug and the exhaust-valve guides for the\n\n31\n\nSo i\n\na)\n\ncooling water, which was piped to the exhaust side of the water jacket. The individual aluminium carriers that held the twin camshafts were attached to the head by long studs that extended to the aluminium cam cover. The two aluminium pieces gripped the outer races of the eight roller bearings that carried each shaft. Apertures in the sides of the cam carriers provided mountings for the pivots of short, light finger followers betwixt cam lobe and valve stem. The carriers had apertures on both sides so the fingers could be positioned as desired; as raced the cam lobes wiped them away from their pivots. Oil entered each hollow nickel-chrome-steel camshaft through a plain bearing and flowed to outlets at each lobe. The 15-S-8’s oiling system had two pressure pumps. One of them lubricated the camshafts, supercharger and the gear trains that drove them and the other accessories. Albert Lory was justifiably proud of the precision of this train of hardened steel gears, pointing out that the pinion that drove the sump-mounted oil pumps was only 3mm wide. The other pressure pump delivered oil to the crankshaft, and a third pump scavenged the dry sump through a screened central pickup.\n\n32\n\nWithin the sump a ladder of pipes along the lefthand side supplied oil at only 1-2 psi to each of the main bearing caps, which were in fact integral with the lower half of the split aluminium crankcase. The nine 49mm main bearings were anti-friction, all rollers except for a double-row ball bearing at the crank nose to take end thrust. The rollers were double-row at the centre and rear mains. Split light-metal cages guided the rollers. A magnificent piece of machining, the one-piece crankshaft was made of nickel-chrome steel so that its journals could be hardened to serve as the inner races for the roller bearings. This held true as well for the rod journals, which were a modest 32mm in diameter. They were lubricated by oil emerging under centrifugal force from slinger rings in the circular crank cheeks. Lubricant was metered to the slinger rings by small jets adjacent to the main bearing feeds. With a one-piece crankshaft Lory was obliged to split his connecting-rod big ends and the light-alloy cages that guided the 12 rollers per journal. These ran directly on the surface of the nickel-chromesteel connecting rod, whose caps were notched to provide secure alignment of the outer race. The Isection rod was 152mm long, exactly twice the stroke, and robust, for Lory was well aware that at\n\nDELAGE\n\n15-S-8\n\n15-L1TRE\n\nLIGHT\n\nof the engine along its right-hand side. It stopped halfway along the engine and powered a gear train that led down to a magneto carried in a cradle alongside the crankcase. For a high-speed engine this was a crucial component; it was made by Bosch. On the left side of the 15-S-8 a fabricated steel exhaust manifold gathered the exiting gases progressively and fed them to a single exhaust pipe. The eight and its attached five-speed gearbox were offset four inches to the left of the Delage’s centreline to balance the driver’s weight and allow him to be seated low in the bodywork. The engine and gearbox made up a very long assembly which was attached at its nose and clutch housing to the frame, to which they added little in the way of stiffness. As a result the front of the chassis was prone to weaving during cornering.\n\nWeaver or not, the 15-S-8 Delage was Europe’s finest 1%-litre racing car. In all, the Delages Left: The success of the Delage 1/-litre straighteight confirmed for most designers the value of the configuration, introduced by Fiat early in the 1920s, of two valves per cylinder in a hemispherical combustion chamber.

In 1923 Alfa took steps to rectify this by a young engineer who had\n\ndivided by a camshaft and accessory drive. Instead of detachable cylinder heads, however, it unified each group of four-cylinder heads and blocks into a single monobloc aluminium casting that extended upward to carry the twin overhead camshafts.

Only one casting pattern was needed for the Tipo B monobloc, because the blocks were symmetrical from left to right. The two valves per cylinder were equally inclined at a steep 52° from the vertical and shared the same diameter: 39mm. Valve lift was equal at 9mm and the timing was also strikingly symmetrical as follows:\n\nengaging Vittorio Jano,\n\nwon\n\nits first races\n\nand thus marked\n\nthe\n\narrival on the scene of a brilliant designer of racing cars and engines. In 1931 Alfa Romeo introduced Jano’s latest creation, the 8C 2300. It had an _ in-line eight-cylinder engine with a significant difference. Jano divided its eight into two cast-iron blocks of four cylinders resting on a common aluminium crankcase. Each block had its own aluminium cylinder head. The crankshaft was made as two separate four-cylinder parts united at the centre by a pair of gears. One of these gears drove the camshafts through a gear train while the other gear drove the supercharger and the oil and water pumps.\n\nJano’s design overcame one of the major disadvantages of the in-line eight: the excessive length of both camshafts and crankshaft that introduced torsional vibrations capable of impairing both valve timing and reliability. A precedent was an 1,100cc eight which was designed for France’s Salmson by Emile Petit in 1928. It too had a central gear train to the camshafts, which also drove two superchargers and the magneto. Jano may well have been aware of the elegant little Salmson engine. The design of the 8C 2300 served as the point of departure for the engine of the Tipo B Alfa Romeo Grand Prix car, the company’s first central-seated racer. Between its 1932 debut and mid-1934 the Tipo B took part in 26 races, of which it won 22. It achieved a 92 per cent finishing record from 62 race starts in these years — an impressive achievement. Through much of the 1930s successful Alfas of both sports and GP configurations were powered by engines that were closely related to the Tipo B’s 2,655cc (65 x 100mm; 2.56 x 3.94in) straighteight. Indeed the engine of the great 8C 2900B sports car was virtually identical to that of the 1934 version of the Tipo B. The Tipo B remained faithful to Jano’s successful concept of two four-cylinder engines\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\nInlet opens Inlet closes\n\n20°BTDC 50°ABDC\n\nExhaust opens 50°BBDC Exhaust closes 20°ATDC\n\nVittorio Jano was a member of Opposite above: In one of the Fiat school which taught his rare departures from from the early 1920s that two German racing cars Rudy Caracciola competed in an valves in a hemispherical Alfa Romeo Tipo B in 1932. combustion chamber were He won the German Grand superior to the four-valve pentPrix that year, here tackling roof chamber that Peugeot, the Niirburgring’s infamous Mercedes, Ballot and others had Karussell. used so successfully before and Opposite below: On this after the war.

A drawback of the block’s symmetry was that the exhaust valves enjoyed no more beneficial water cooling of the valve guides than the inlets, although they needed more. However, good cooling was provided for the 18mm Champion spark plug placed vertically at the centre of the chamber and firing through a masking aperture. All the valves seated directly on the aluminium without the benefit of inserts. While allowing large valves, this made the seats prone to eventual cracking. Thanks to Jano’s use of a cam-follower system\n\n35\n\nhe had brought to Alfa with the P2, the Tipo B’s valves could be short and light. Three springs closed each valve: a large and deep outside spring and two shorter inner springs. Retaining the springs was a mushroom-shaped piece, whose stem surrounded the valve stem and was keyed to the latter so that it couldn’t rotate in relation to the valve. Holding this down against the springs was another smaller mushroom-shaped piece which screwed onto the end of the valve stem. Wiped directly by the cam lobe, this was screwed in or out to set valve clearance and was held in place by matching serrations on both its lower surface and the top of the larger ‘mushroom’ under it.\n\n36\n\nCentral gears were bolted to separate camshafts for each block, each being carried by three long plain bearings. Each bearing was retained by an individual cap, held by studs which extended further to hold down the aluminium cam covers. The central cam drive train used spur gears, machined with integral hollow shafts carried by ball bearings. On the left side of the block a gear train from the crank centre drove a pair of two-lobe Rootstype superchargers, one for each set of four cylinders. Each had rotors 90mm long and a capacity of 1,350cc. Driven at 1.45 times engine speed (the ratio could be changed) they produced a boost pressure of 11 psi. Underneath each blower was its own 42mm_ updraught Weber carburettor, model BS42. Delivery was through a finned aluminium manifold equipped with a pressure-relief or ‘blow-off’ valve. Thus equipped, the Tipo B engine developed 215bhp at 5,600rpm. Its maximum torque of 210lb ft was produced between 3,500 and 4,000rpm. With this boost and the fuels of the day a compression ratio of 6.5:1 was appropriate. This\n\nwas established by the rounded crown of a fullyskirted aluminium piston, which carried its gudgeon pin low to make room for three compression rings and one oil ring above the pin and another oil ring below it. Eighteen millimetres in diameter, the pin fitted in a bronze bushing in the small end of a steel rod 216mm long. Ribs from its I-section shank blended into the two-bolt big end of the rod, which was machined all over. It rode on a 52mm journal. Jano had enough confidence in plain bearings to use them throughout the Tipo B’s bottom end. Ten 61mm babbit main bearings were provided for the crankshaft, an extra one being needed to flank the drive gears at the centre of the engine. Individual main bearing caps were tightened by two studs apiece against the bottom of the magnesium crankcase, which was split at the crank centreline. Enclosing the bottom of the straight-eight was a deep bottomfinned magnesium sump casting which sloped toward an oil pickup located two-thirds of the way along (toward the front). Gears from the central train drove the\n\nALFA\n\nROMEO\n\nTIPO\n\nB 2.7-LITRE\n\nEIGHT\n\nwhich delivered its output upward to a manifold that supplied coolant to the exhaust side of the water jackets of the two blocks. A take-off at the centre of each of the two cylinder heads transferred warm water back to the radiator. Forward of the gear train was the single Bosch magneto.\n\nIn this configuration the Tipo B’s engine powered Alfas to signal successes in 1932 and 33, including three victories at Monza,\n\none at\n\nan average speed in excess of 110mph. For the 1934 season\n\nOpposite above: With beguiling symmetry Vittorio\n\nJano provided separate carburettors and superchargers to feed the front and rear cylinder blocks of the Tipo B's 2.7litre engine.

Pressurised oil was supplied to the main bearings and, through drillings, to the rod big-ends. Each lubrication system was unique to a four-cylinder module of the engine, for the crankshaft was made in two separate pieces joined together by bolts at the central gear. Machined from forgings, both halves of the crankshaft had full counterweights opposite each rod journal. External oil lines from the crankcase delivered lubricant to passages in the cylinder head. On the right side of the Tipo B engine the central gear train powered other accessories.\n\nTo\n\nthe rear of the gear train was the water pump,\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\nits bore was\n\nincreased to 69mm,\n\nbringing its capacity to 2,991cc. Thus enhanced, with chassis improvements as well, the Tipo B — also known as the Alfa Romeo P3 in homage to its great predecessor the P2 — won the 1934 Monaco and French Grands Prix. The same basic engine was enlarged in 1935 to 3,165cc (71 x 100mm) and then to 3,823cc (78 x 100mm) to combat the advances made by the Germans. In the latter form, with a compression ratio of 8.1:1, it produced 330bhp at 5,400rpm. Since 1934 the Alfas were being entered in races by a new team formed by a former employee and racing driver of the Milan company, Enzo Ferrari. His greatest contributions to the sport of motor racing were yet to come.

It stands out as the only 16-cylinder ever to achieve consistent success in Grand Prix racing. Its architecture, replete with multiple-purpose surfaces and members and planned with weightparing ingenuity, is among the most brilliant ever devised for any engine. Ferdinand Porsche and his engine designer, Josef Kales, were faced with a new formula that fixed a maximum weight for the car: 750kg. They decided to build a large-displacement engine for the Auto Union which could develop high power through high torque at relatively low crank speeds, hence could be stressed at a lower level. Cylinder dimensions were set initially at 68 x\n\n75mm (2.68 x 2.95in) for 4,358cc. Lower structural stresses allowed the block and crankcase to be cast in one piece in thin-wall high-siliconalloy aluminium. Inserted in it were forged chrome-alloy-steel cylinder liners, exposed to the cooling water. The V16 had detachable cylinder heads, avoided then by most other GP car builders with the exception of the Maserati brothers. Studs retaining the heads were long, extending well down into the block. The basic engine geometry was architectonic: 45° between cylinder banks, and valves equally disposed at 90° to each other. The valves formed a part-spherical, part-conical combustion chamber which was fired by a single 18mm spark plug. The V16’s integration of valve gear and induction arrangements was masterful. Only one single central overhead camshaft was used, carried in nine bearings. Its 32 lobes opened the inlet valves directly through fingers on parallel shafts. The outboard exhaust valves were opened remotely through finger followers which operated rocker arms at the exhaust valves through horizontal pushrods. This gave the exhaust valve gear the higher reciprocating mass, which was partially compensated for by the smaller size, 32mm, of the exhausts as compared to the 35mm inlet valves. All the major accessory drives (excluding only the belt-driven water pump) were at the rear of the engine, taken from the crank between the ninth and tenth main bearings. Bevel gears drove a\n\nCLASSIC\n\nRACING\n\nENGINES\n\nvertical shaft (running at slightly higher than crank speed to reduce the torque loadings) which extended up to the camshaft. From there take-offs drove the fuel pump and the special Bosch oiler, which metered oil from the main pressure system to the supercharger bearings. Just above the crankshaft, side bevels from the vertical shaft drove the twin eight-cylinder Bosch magnetos. Above them a multiple-disc clutch pack, pre-loaded by a massive coil spring, drove an idler gear which in turn drove the primary lobe of a vertically-placed Roots-type supercharger. Two variants of blowers were used, the original C-type and the later, longer, slimmer S-type with stiffer bearing mounts, both delivering about 2.8 litres per revolution and rotating at slightly more than twice engine speed.

At the front of the engine, at the end of this inlet gallery, a substantial spring-loaded blow-off valve was fitted to relieve the manifold of any overpressure caused by a backfire. Unusually the bottom of the crankcase was sliced off at an angle as viewed from the side, becoming deeper toward the back of the engine. At its front the crankcase extended down just past the two-bolt main bearing caps, while at the rear it reached all the way down to the bottom of the clutch/flywheel assembly, the split line sloping downward toward the rear at an angle of seven degrees to the crank centreline. This put the most metal where it was needed, at the back of the engine for the all-important attachment\n\nto the clutch\n\nand\n\ntransaxle,\n\nand\n\n39\n\nallowed weight to be saved at the front, where all that was needed was a thin-walled sump to catch the oil. Below the vertical shaft at the rear, wormand-pinion gears drove the twin gear-type oil pumps at five times engine speed. One of the oil pumps was a scavenger for the dry-sump system, the other a pressure pump drawing from the reservoir. ‘Water’ is a misnomer for the coolant f these cars, which was usually ethylene glycol pressurised to 5psi. For a completely new design, so radical that many predicted total disaster for it, the A-Type AU of 1934 was remarkably successful. It equalled its Mercedes-Benz rivals with three victories in important races, including the all-\n\nimportant German Grand Prix. In 1935 the BType was a transitional model, and with many experimental features did less well. Over the following winter the bore was enlarged to 72.5mm, for 4,950cc. Domed pistons were fitted to bring the compression ratio to 8.95:1 and the boost was upped to I lpsi. This brought the power to 375bhp at 4,800rpm and the torque from 391 to 478lb ft at a slightly higher speed, 3,000 instead of 2,700rpm -— still astonishingly low torque peaks for a racing engine. The almost flat torque curve allowed the Auto Unions to be driven in only two gears on many tracks, and in only one gear, with no shifting at all, at Monaco. As built for 1934 the exhaust manifolds for the V16 collected two cylinders at a time, bringing four pipes on each side into the main exhaust pipes that extended back along the sides of the car. In 1935 AU fitted separate stacks for each cylinder, setting the pattern for all the later Auto Unions and creating the car’s distinctive sound, a ‘staccato, high-pitched bark’. The forged chrome-nickel-steel crankshaft of the A-Type AU was carried in tin-bronze main bearing shells, 62mm in diameter, with similar bearings for the 58mm connecting-rod big ends. The 164mm rods had slim I-section shanks and two-bolt caps, conventionally split. Like all the later AU rods the A-Type h"
