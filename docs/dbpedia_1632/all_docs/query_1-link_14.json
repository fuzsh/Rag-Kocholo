Is there any good web-site around?\nWhen did this factory started?\nWas the \"Godiva\" V8 their first racing engine?\nApart from fire-engines and racing-engines, what did they do more?\nWas it big factory?\nWhat happened after the 1500cc-era?\nDoes it still exist?\netc.\n\nCheers\nStefan",

        "text": "From RVM 5 May 1999\n\nThe Coventry Climax FPF signaled a sea change in how Grand Prix racing was changing. In late 1956, at the annual Motor Show, Climax unveiled a new engine developed exclusively for motor racing, unlike the FW series (the FWB and FWE in particular) which were automotive developments of the original, humble fire pump engine. The FPF was 1475cc four-cylinder, twin cam engine that was suitable for the new Formula Two that was to come into effect starting with the 1957 season. It was derived from the V-8 that Coventry Climax built in 1953 to be used by British team for the new 2.5 litre formula that Grand Prix races were to run to from 1954 until 1957, and which was extended until 1960. The Godiva was never produced because the horsepower numbers were not as close as the company wanted them to be to those of the Italian teams. It was not understood by Climax at the time that the Italians used smaller horses. At any rate, it was placed on the shelf.\n\nThe desirability of a readily available racing engine for the new Formula Two class spurred Climax into action and the result was the FPF. It proved a highly satisfactory racing engine and its availability was a huge factor in its success. It was flexible, strong, and available. Here did the designation \"FPF\" come from? The Godiva was known as the FPE at the factory and since the new engine was based essentially on one bank of the V-8, it was given the FPF designation.\n\nThe success of the FPF in 1957 got several minds wondering what would happen if it were enlarged and raced at the Grand Prix level. Rob Walker and Climax worked on an agreement that saw one block enlarged to a capacity of 1960cc. It was dropped into the back of the Walker T43 and shipped out to Buenos Aires for the 1958 Argentine GP. As luck would have it, it won! Stirling Moss gave Rob Walker, Cooper and Coventry Climax their first Championship victories. There were several other changes in the FPF for the Walker team.\n\nAt Monte Carlo, the FPF was now in 2015cc form. And it won again, this time with Maurice Trintignant at the wheel of the Walker Cooper. Amazing enough, both wins were considered flukes and few followed the lead of Cooper in fielding a rear-engined car.\n\nIn late 1958, Climax gathered the necessary funding and in a very short period of time, literally weeks, produced a full 2495cc version for GP racing. Externally, the FPF in either Formula One or Formula Two displacement looked the same and fit into the same cars with few problems. By late Spring, there were sufficient numbers of the \"big\" FPF available that the British works teams could field their teams and still have a spare handy."
