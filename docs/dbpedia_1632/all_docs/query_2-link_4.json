        "text": "I think what you misheard in that conversation was “Nerus” this was a company that was building M10 engines for racing and they had a 2 stage dry sump system that worked in the sports racers. They also were the 1st ones to actually build a 2 liter M10. In 1964 BMW only made 1500, 1600, and 1800cc engines. At that time the 1800 was a “long stroke” design that used the 1600 bore (84mm) and a 80mm stroke instead of the 71mm used on the 1600. They figured out they could over bore the block to 89mm, that is a 5mm overbore!! It wasn’t until 1966 that BMW started making a 2 liter 89mm bore, 80mm stroke and started casting the blocks with enough cylinder wall thickness so there was room to go past 89mm. This is also the same time they started making a “short stroke” 1800 using the 89mm bore but using the 71 mm stroke from the 1600.\n\nAs far as value for an original “Nerus” BMW it is not very much. I seriously doubt that the block is original as there was no way to even go 1 oversize because the cylinder walls were to thin. The chance hat a race engine from almost 60 years ago has not needed a rebuild is virtually 0. The cylinder heads they used were 118 and the ports were very small and when they opened them up to basically the size of a stock 121 head (again this did not happen until about 1966) they did not live very long because they cracked. The engines were mounted in the cars at about 12deg instead of the 30 deg tilt n the street cars so the intake manifolds are different to keep the carbs level as well as the oil pan pickup is in a different location. Basically other than a piece of BMW history there is nothing on a original engine from back then that anyone would use in a car any longer. The dry sump system uses the early gear type oil pump and then has a external single stage scavenge pump that is driven off the stock internal pump. Everyone in vintage racing around the world are running 3 stage external dry sump pumps, 2 liter blocks and heads ( 121, E12, E21, 1.8 ) and all of the modern cams, rockers, rods, pistons etc."
