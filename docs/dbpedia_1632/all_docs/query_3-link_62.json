        "text": "By Stephen Amos.\n\nSo I guess this all dates to a childhood buried in Wheels magazines, and a ride in a Lucalia Clubman owned by a friend. After that – if there was to be a sports car it was going to be a Lotus.\n\nAs one did in the day.. if you were interested in a topic you looked up the relevant club, and so it was that I attended a Lotus club run in 1991! It was there that I realised two things. Firstly that I barely fitted in a Lotus 7, and that Lotus Elans were pretty cool. It was also here that I met the ever patient and encouraging members of LCQ. There was much more thought, competing priorities and so on.\n\nI think it was around 1998 that I started looking in earnest for an Elan. Remarkably in the days before the internet you talked to the club. You put your ears to the ground and phoned people. I know I talked to the NSW and VIC Lotus clubs, and I got around to SA. I think it was Mike Bennett who mentioned he knew of someone selling an Elan. A 1969 Series 4 in Gold Leaf Red.\n\nI phoned the gent who said he was the third owner, and had owned it since the early 1980s. The story was that it was bought by the owner of one of the main Ford Dealers in Adelaide. As was the way back then, he ordered the car and picked it up in the UK and drove it around for a bit before bringing it back. Allegedly he liked the colours of the Sprint and painted it up. He sold it to another chap in 1978 who by all reports enjoyed the car very much and sold it about 4 years later. The current owner hadn’t driven it much. He’d done some work… engine rebuilds, soft-top replacements, but I think it was largely in the too hard basket which I would later come to understand. Nevertheless he assured me I could drive it back to Brisbane tomorrow no problems. He mailed me up four photographs of the car and I decided to go to Adelaide and see it.\n\nMike Bennett agreed to put me up for my one-night stay. I had a very memorable stay surrounded by cars like his Lotus 12 and an amazing drive around the Adelaide hills in his virtually identical Elan. I went to see the car. It looked pretty original. Only just over 40,000k since the speedo was converted on arrival to Australia. It was a bit tatty and tired but it had never had chooks living in it. It drove without stopping on the test drive (my first drive of an Elan) and I agreed to buy it. And so it was. Fortunately I decided to freight it to Brisbane.\n\nWhen I got it home I started driving it around. There were lots of minor problems but nothing that seemed insurmountable. And then one day, while cleaning I decided to hose in the strut towers. But no water came out. So I started cleaning and removing dirt. And then rust. And then finding the holes in the strut towers. I vaguely remember the frantic call to Craig who was remarkably still taking my calls, and so it was that a great journey began, for an IT worker who’d never done more than change the oil in a car.\n\nAnd so the body-off restoration started. This was going to be a big job, and it was on a timeline as this vehicle was going to be a wedding car. Frankly it’s all a bit of a blur. I know I couldn’t have done it without all the help. People in particular like Craig, Tony, Greg, and Steve Taylor (Elan Factory) – how they still talk to me I don’t know. It was insane. The youngest owner of an old Lotus, and an IT person rebuilding an aged English car. Before YouTube even. After six months of total intensity, working mostly spare time, the car was finished just in time for the wedding. Luckily.\n\nIt was driven quite a bit for a few years. Had some very memorable experiences including to the Lotus meeting in Victoria. Unfortunately, I think I was actually a bit burnt out from the very stressful rebuild. Competing priorities. Young family etc, etc. According to my records it did about 1200km between 2005 and October last year. Most of those would have been done at the excellent Lotus 2011 event. So it sat, neglected but not forgotten.\n\nJumping forward to 2021 – I think I knew it was time to dig it out from under the covers. I made a few little digs at it, starting a list of what absolutely had to be done. Batteries, tyres etc. I phoned Craig who didn’t hang up on me. Things were looking up. I even decided to see if I could get some information about the car from Lotus. I wrote to them and their archivist was so helpful. It ended with a nice reply with the car’s details, see below…\n\nSo I was pretty chuffed by that. 53 years on and all the bits are still bolted together! Every time I drive the car I’m literally stunned by its blend of performance, handling and ride. I’ve literally got no idea how they managed to assemble a bunch of mostly mundane parts into something so special. Something that’s still so special. After 60 years no less.\n\nI think my plan going forward is to make sure I keep driving it. I’d like to just tinker and fix the little things. I think the next big thing must be to freshen up the old paint. And I really think celebrating 60 years since Earls Court is a great idea. These cars need to be remembered. Hopefully we will see these cars being passed on and looked after by new owners in the coming years.\n\nBy Colin McKay.\n\nLotus Elan, 1968, S4, Drop Head Coupe (convertible). Standard specification: bolt on wheels, 105bhp, unboosted brakes, unperforated seating vinyl, no fancy chrome strips.\n\nI purchased my Elan in Hong Kong, in 1987. The vendor would not let me test drive it, which I thought, at the time, unusual. However, there weren’t too many Elans in Hong Kong – I wanted it, so not a biggie. At least it wasn’t until I started driving it. The front right hand wheel kept rubbing the top of the wheel well. Further investigating revealed a badly repaired chassis that had split almost completely through on the offending side.\n\nThinking a quick chassis change would see me back on the road again turned into a 23 year labour of love. What was revealed was a pretty well neglected car that was 19 years old with only 34,000 miles on the clock.\n\nSome of the major defects: split chassis, inoperative lights, metal stitching of a crack in the head, bog inches thick on the front right hand side etc.\n\nI started the restoration in Hong Kong. The engine was pulled apart, head taken to QED in the UK, new chassis and numerous other parts ordered from Chris Neil’s in the UK.\n\nThe chassis change part of the restoration was fairly straight forward. The engine was reassembled with new rings and bearings and the overhauled head refitted. However, the body was proving to be a big job. Scraping various layers of paint (at least three in it’s relatively short life) with anything sharp I could lay my hands on, proved tedious. It also revealed a lot of damage to the front right hand side that would need fibreglass work beyond my ability.\n\nSo from 1987 to 1996 either the chassis or body was hanging from the roof of our garage whilst work was carried out on the other.\n\nIn 1996, we packed up our house, Robyn and our two daughters moved back to the Gold Coast to continue their schooling. The 40′ container also had the Elan in it for its journey to its new home.\n\nWork restarted in about 2003 when I also returned, permanently, from Hong Kong.\n\nThe body was sent to John Woodlands who had done several Elan bodies for club owners. The paint job was carried out by apprentices at a tech college. This has proven to be a good job, as it is still in fairly good condition.\n\nNot wanting to install the engine, after all the years in storage, as is, I asked Greg Bray to disassemble it, check everything, and reassemble a leak free engine. It has run faultlessly for the past 12 years.\n\nIn 2009 a friend invited me to take the Elan to his factory for final assembly. This pleased Robyn, as finally doors, bonnet, boot disappeared from the guest room, and the instrument panel finally left the table in my study.\n\nThe next year saw the engine and gearbox mated to the new (23 year old) chassis and the body lowered, from a two post hoist, to complete the car.\n\n2010 the engine was started for the first time in 23 years and the first drive was a long looked-forward-to event.\n\nIn the ensuing years I have made some improvements to make the car more reliable and safer; mainly cooling, braking and lighting.\n\nAt the moment, the Elan is awaiting a new water pump. This is a major job on the twincam, and needs some thought and expert opinion.\n\nOver the years, Robyn and I have had some great driving holidays in the Elan. Generally after the Biennial Lotus gatherings, and on the excellent Grand Tours organised by Ken Philp.\n\nSince owning the Elan, I have had occasion to call on friends for advice, namely Craig Wilson and Greg Bray. Great to have knowledgeable friends.\n\nI look forward to being back on the road, as the Elan always elicits a big grin, from me, and admiring toots, thumbs up etc from other drivers.\n\nDavid Rose, the current owner of a 1963 Elan, tells the story of its journey to Australia, its rich racing history, restoration and now a new-found home in the UK.\n\nThe long journey to Australia\n\nElan number 26/0202 was one of the earliest Elans built and one of the very earliest to arrive in Australia. As an early car, it is one of the rare ‘Bourne’ bodied Elans – Bourne Plastics, in Lincolnshire, England, won the contract in 1962 to build Elan bodies. Bourne went on to make 250-300 bodies before Lotus took manufacture back in-house in late 1963. Bourne-built cars wear a small badge in the engine bay bearing the body number.\n\nFactory assembled and completed in October 1963, it made the 10,000 mile sea journey to Sydney, where first owner Bill Gates collected the car from Geoghegan’s dealership.\n\nSuccess in the hands of a famous Queenslander\n\nBill Gates will be known to many as Brisbane DJ, Lotus racer and first manager of The Bee Gees. The story goes that Bill, his friend Bill Goode, a sponsor of Bill’s radio show Platter Chatter and singer Barry Gibb all shared the same initials – they agreed to use this as inspiration and subsequently named the band the BGs, later The Bee Gees.\n\nBill loved cars, was also an owner of a Cooper S and MGB which was used to tow his speedboat. He drove his new Elan from Sydney home to Brisbane and over the course of the next 3 years had considerable success racing the Elan at all of Queensland’s race tracks.\n\nThe racing history of the little red Elan is well documented, with many period photographs too – wins came at Lowood in October 1964, at Lowood again in 1965 as well as twice at Lakeside. In 1966 Gates and the Elan won at Lakeside and Surfers Paradise. They raced in the Australian Grand Prix meeting at Lakeside in 1966, achieving 3rd place in the Tasman Cup and sharing the meeting with Lotus greats including Jim Clark and eventual winner of the Grand Prix, Graham Hill.\n\nA big crash and long restoration\n\nGates went on to take delivery of a red Elan 26R which is now owned by Vaughan Stibbard (the two cars always raced as number ‘50’) and the S1 was bought by Lex Harris for road use, bearing the Queensland number ‘NUA 222’, and was later owned by fellow Queenslander Geoff Ansell. It is believed Ansell was the owner when the Elan was badly damaged, with a crash approaching a bridge. The rear of the car was very badly damaged and was off the road for many years, owned by Ray Hilko and then from 2001, Jeff Rowse from Brisbane.\n\nOver the course of a 10 year period Jeff undertook an incredible restoration of the Elan, including restoration of the original chassis. In 2011 the Elan emerged as new, a factory specification car, just as it had arrived in Australia 48 years earlier.\n\nSoon after the restoration, the red Elan was reunited with Bill Gates, the 26R and mechanic Jim Bertram at the Lakeside Historics event.\n\nLeaving Australia and re-connecting with the racing roots\n\nIn 2015 the Elan made a 3 month journey by sea back to the UK. Having bought the car unseen from Jeff and despite a fully documented restoration, it was a relief to find the car in such beautiful condition when it arrived in Worcestershire.\n\nThe car now sits alongside a GTS spec racing Elan, a Climax Elite and Lotus 18 FJ. Despite infrequent use on the road and now with a beautiful 145bhp twin cam, the Elan has made it back on track and also, in 2021, it ran at the world’s oldest motorsport venue, Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb close by in Worcestershire.\n\nTorn between keeping it as a road car and using it as it once was, to race, the car is a welcome edition to the early Elans in the UK and, as some Australian Lotus fans have said, should find its way back home Down Under some day.\n\nFor those interested in early Elans there is a dedicated Facebook Group – Lotus Type 26 – S1 and S2 Elan and I would be very interested to learn of further details of this red Elan’s history – please email dunclent1@gmail.com\n\nLotus ELAN 1962 – 2022\n\nBy Craig Wilson.\n\nWhen Colin Chapman, Ron Hickman and the team at Lotus were looking at a replacement for the brilliant but expensive Type 14 Elite in 1961, little did they know that they were setting another benchmark which is still revered by the best designers, critics and owners six decades later.\n\nAs Gordon Murray CBE said on the McLaren F1 review. The two Elans in his collection are the benchmark on handling, and he nearly achieved that perfection, nimbleness, balance and driving experience in the F1.\n\nThe Type 26 Elan was announced at a Press Release with the S1 at the Earls Court London Motor Show – 17 October 1962. Some were available in kit form but cost fully built was GBP 1499.00.\n\nThe fundamental structure of backbone folded steel chassis and fibreglass body was half the cost of the monocoque Elite body and the method used for road going Lotus cars through the Elans, Europa, Elite, Eclat, Excel, Esprits up to the change in the iconic Elise and it’s revised structure for the new generation of Lotus.\n\nThe Elan was produced in S1 to S4 models with the usual variations of convertible, removable hardtop, FHC and ever increasing performance and styling upgrades of Type 36 and Type 45 in the final S4 Sprint in 1975.\n\nThere are also the many competition versions of 26R S1 and S2. This was a lightweight version produced initially to meet increasing factory requests to compete against privateer conversions of Elans for racing. (See story below.)\n\n60 years later, these little race cars are still giant killers in Historic Racing such as Goodwood Revival.\n\nColin Chapman was very good at product placement and the Elan models featured in many TV series including the Avengers with Dianna Rigg (Emma Peel), Tara King, Peter Sellers and Paul Newman had one, Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt, Graham Hill and the list goes on.\n\nSo to all those Elan and Elan Plus 2 owners out there who are one day gunna do it, now is the time. This is the year. Make the effort. Get it out of the shed, open the boxes and go for it.\n\nA big congratulations to Steve Amos who dragged his S4 out of the shed mid 2021 and refurbished it after 10 years. Well done Steve and he still can’t control the smile.\n\nA further big congratulations to Gary Stewart who dragged his Elan out of the shed after at least 25 years during 2021 and completely refurbished all the mechanicals to arrive at the All British Day in style. Well done Gary.\n\nOur hope is that Ian Loxton will make good progress this year on his very big Elan +2 project. Keep at it Ian.\n\nIan Wright’s S3 Elan is on the way – another Ian with an Elan project.\n\nSo there are a few on the go and if you know someone who has one, who needs a prod or some support, let them know there are plenty of people around to lend a hand.\n\nWe have at least 12 Elans and +2s on the road in Queensland and that could grow with a bit of encouragement. We would also like to see some magazine articles throughout this year on your Elan, its life, restoration and ownership so share those stories.\n\nA 60 year celebration is in planning for later this year so there is plenty of time to join the Elan team.\n\nTYPE 26 Elan S1 and S2\n\nContribution by William Taylor, Creative Director of Coterie Press\n\nBy 1961 it was clear that for Lotus to remain profitable, it was the Elite which had to be supplanted. As such, the Elan became more up-market. Overall, its design had less of the Elite’s uncompromised feel and far more regard for production viability and costings.\n\nThe simple, deep backbone chassis was of 18swg steel with local 16swg stiffening and weighed a mere 75lb. It measured 11.5 inches by 6 inches at the centre (which doubled up as a propshaft tunnel) and each end of the chassis forked out into narrower sections. Cross-members and turrets at the front cradled the engine, gearbox, steering and suspension, and the rear housed the final drive and suspension.\n\nThe body, designed by Ron Hickman, was moulded in two main glassfibre sections (floorpan/arches and upper body) which were then bonded together. Steel strengthening for the door jambs and screen pillars made it sufficiently rigid to not rely on the chassis for its strength. Clean aerodynamics suggested a pop-up headlamp arrangement, which was worked by vacuum cylinders. The front and rear bumpers were made of plastic and filled with polyurethane foam.\n\nChapman wanted a twin overhead camshaft engine for the Elan and turned to Harry Mundy of The Autocar magazine. Mundy, formerly with BRM and Coventry Climax agreed to develop a DOHC head. Preliminary work was on the 3-bearing 109E block, until the Ford 116E 5-bearing block became available. The alloy heads were initially made by J.A. Prestwich, and then by Lotus itself.\n\nAs announced, the Elan engine displaced 1,499cc and was basically a detuned version of the same unit that had powered the Lotus 23 earlier in the season. The head, pushrods, timing cover and water pump of the original OHV engine was discarded, and Lotus fitted its own aluminium DOHC head. However, the 100bhp engine was quickly superseded by a definitive 1,558cc, 105bhp version with twin Weber carburettors. Dellorto or Zenith-Stromberg carbs would be fitted later.\n\nThe interior, accessed by wide-opening doors, seated two, on well-shaped adjustable seats mounted on an inclined floor. The steering column was adjustable for reach by concentric tubes, designed for crash collapsibility. The fascia panel was of nineply, wood faced with teak and housed four gauges. The boot was generous for a sports car and under the floor sat the spare wheel and 10-gallon fuel tank. The windows were of the manually operated, sliding type, rather than having a bulky winding mechanism, (which wouldn’t fit in the tight confines of the door).\n\nInitially launched in convertible form only at the 1962 Earls Court Motor Show, the price was £1,495 fully built or £1,095 in kit form. From May 1963, when the larger engine was standardised, a removable hardtop became an optional extra.\n\nThe Elan quickly gained a reputation as an ultra-responsive, balanced, and quick little car. The Elan attracted over 2,000 customers in its first three years and its success almost certainly saved Lotus from an early demise.\n\nA revised Elan S2 arrived in November 1964. It had several small improvements like larger front calipers, full-width polished veneer dash with a lockable glovebox, quick-release filler cap and new rear lenses. The option of centre-lock wheels was offered in place of the original bolt-on type.\n\nDuration 1985 – 1992.\n\nBy Greg Bray.\n\nBy 1985 I had owned my 1967 Lotus Elan S3 SE Coupe for 11 years. I was born and bred in Southern England. My passion from a very young age was always cars. Conveniently I did not live too far away from the Goodwood racetrack, of which I was a regular visitor growing up.\n\nI qualified as a British Leyland motor mechanic in 1971 working on cars ranging from Morris Minors to Jaguars. I was always changing my own cars every 5 minutes, until I came across a Moto Baldet Lotus Elan in 1974 needing some love and mechanical attention already at only 7 years old. At the time I owned a good condition MGB GT which I swapped for the Lotus, plus a bit of cash. Thinking I would sort the car out and sell it on as usual, 47 years on I still own the Elan!\n\nSo way back I joined the English Club Lotus and enjoyed the company of like-minded people. My love of all cars Lotus was born. By which time I was running my own car repair business and had a few customers with Lotus cars.\n\nWhilst driving along Southsea seafront one evening I was flagged down by another Lotus Elan S3. The owner jumped out and introduced himself as Jerry Bell, who ended up a very good friend. Jerry happened to run a car body repair business and I with my mechanical business. I did all his mechanical work and he did my paint work. So I was very interested when Jerry rang one day in 1985 to say an advert was in the local paper for a 1965 Lotus Elan S2 in pieces for just £850.00.\n\nThe story went that the man selling the car knew nothing about it, as it was left behind in the double garage of the house he had just bought. He wanted the garage space for his boat, so Jerry and I shot around there to have a look. The owner could not tell us why the original owner might have left the Lotus behind, probably because it had been absolutely dismantled some 10 years or so earlier. Not just the engine and gearbox, but also the steering rack, brake calipers, everything just thrown into separate boxes and left to rust in the English climate!\n\nWhilst the phone wouldn’t stop ringing regarding the car, I quickly established everything seemed to be there and it was original and complete.\n\nJerry and I were supposed to be partners in this rebuild, but I’m afraid Jerry wasn’t good at making quick decisions and he thought we should think it over and come back tomorrow. I knew the car would be gone and the owner was wondering what he really had and perhaps hadn’t asked enough money for these bits and pieces. I insisted to Jerry we give the man a deposit and come back with a big van tomorrow to take it off his hands, which we did. I quickly realised my dithering friend would not make a good partner in this long term rebuild, so luckily I was able to persuade Jerry it would be best I carry out the whole rebuild myself. I would need Jerry later to shape up the car and spray it for me. He agreed to that all ok, as he also liked Minis and I gave him my orange Mini 1000.\n\nThe only thing that had been done towards the rebuild was a total waste of time. The front turrets had been plated because of corrosion there and on other places on the chassis and a thick coat of black paint had been applied. I needed to throw away that old chassis and buy a new replacement chassis which was readily available. Then all new suspension and brake parts, differential rebuild with new 3.5 crown wheel and pinion, as 3.9 too low for the UK. Body repairs next, the body of the car was in poor condition. I ended up re-glassing more or less most of the car. Typically “drop heads” in English climate get corrosion. Which in this case had swelled the lower door sills reinforcing metal bars. I had to cut all the corroded metal out, so it could fill out the big gap in the lower sill. This was probably the worst repair I had to do on the whole car!\n\nThe body was cracked and crazed all over. I had to grind off a lot of gel coat and do a lot of fibreglass work underneath as well as on top. That was as far as I could go with it, so I passed the body on to my mate Jerry who shaped it and painted it. The car had been Spruce Green (Lotus British Racing Green); I decided to make it a red car in case I decided to sell it. As I would never part with my Lotus Elan S3 SE as it is the all-round better car to own.\n\nNext with the body back and fitted to the new chassis, being a drop head in England the car’s interior had suffered greatly.\n\nFortunately I was able to service and clean all the switches and gauges, which were all still in good working order. The lacquer on the dash however was cracked all over. I was able to carefully use a heat gun to strip the lacquer off back to the veneer which was in perfect condition. After many coats of yacht varnish and rubbing down I was never going to get a perfect finish. So off to my friend Jerry again who sprayed it in his spray oven and got a perfect finish for me.\n\nThe front seat frames lower tubes were all rusted out, so they had to be replaced. I bought various trim parts and seat kits which I fitted myself. I also bought a new steering wheel. Hood and tonneau cover.\n\nThe engine and gearbox rebuild was the easy part for me as I did that type of work running my business. As for the engine typically I would usually spend four times as long doing the head than doing the bottom end. Typically being an early Mk 1 engine having no tappet guides in the head. So the tappets run directly in the alloy head having no wear, which I found normal with early heads.\n\nGearboxes of Series 1 and 2 cars all had close ratio gears. When the 2000E came out with the better Ford ratios, Lotus used those ratios in the Series 3 and 4. I kept the engine and gearbox rebuild original and also rebuilt the carbs as standard.\n\nThe car drove extremely well, very smooth and quiet. I was really pleased with the finished rebuild.\n\nOf course it had taken me many hours over 7 years to achieve the rebuild in 1992 and I must pay tribute to my family for putting up with me missing from home. As I often worked on the car after a day’s working on my customer’s cars. I was also there most Saturdays working on the car. My wife Chris and our two boys insisted I spend Sundays with them, usually out walking in the countryside especially the South Downs to get some fresh air.\n\nIn 1993 I met a John Williams who came to my garage to buy a new Triumph Dolomite Sprint cylinder head I had for sale. When John realised I was interested in Lotus cars we got talking and I mentioned rebuilding the Lotus Elan S2. John asked would I be interested in him doing an article about the car as he was a writer for the English Classic Cars Magazine. So I was very proud when a six page article with 13 photos of the car was printed in September 1993.\n\nAt that time I would never have dreamt that in July 1996 I would be emigrating to Australia. By then I had three Lotus cars. My Lotus Elan S3, Lotus Elan S2 and a Twin Cam Lotus Europa which I had also rebuilt (maybe another article to follow?).\n\nMy first Elan, the S3 had to come with me. The Twin Cam Europa went to Japan (I’m sorry I let that one go) and the Elan S2 was sold in May 1996 at the annual Club Lotus weekend at Castle Combe racetrack. I turned up in the car with a For Sale sign on it for £12500. Within half an hour Kent Sports Cars came to look at the car and wrote me a cheque for the asking price without even wanting to hear the engine run. They sent a truck two weeks later to pick up the S2 from my garage. Within a month they were advertised the Elan at £19950, which at the time was the most I had seen a Lotus Elan advertised for!\n\nBy Barry Ellis.\n\nBorn in Victoria, I did Civil/Structural Engineering at Swinburne Tech and have lived in lots of places around the world and worked almost everywhere.\n\nI was always interested in motor racing, and very interested in Lotus in the 60s. It was great to see the Elans doing so well at Phillip Island. But then a few Europas arrived (Type 47s) and straight off the block they were doing much better than the very well sorted Elans. Wow, I had to have one! But very hard to get in Aus.\n\nThe Geoghegan Brothers brought in a small number of Europas and assembled them in Sydney. I first saw one at the Melbourne motor show in about 1970. I was driving a Rover 2000 at the time and the new Rovers and Europas were the same price; about $4700. Too much money for me. But then in 1975 a second hand one came on the market. It had a full race Ford Kent engine in it, was fairly rough around the edges, and the gear lever mechanism was broken out of the chassis. I paid the owner $2000, put my hand down through the hole in the chassis, could get a couple of gears, and drove it home.\n\nIt was VIN 54/1151, trans. No 00935. Quite a lot of work then followed: the fixing of the gear change mechanism, aligning of the rear wheels (they had lots of toe-out) and general work on the springs and shocks. Then, to do a little racing, I had to put in a roll bar. The full cage was not required in those days.\n\nI had three cars at the time and was living in Newry, about 35km out of Sale. One day I was driving to work in the Europa on the road from Maffra to Sale, when a local cop in an unmarked car pulled out in front of me and accelerated away. I thought that it was all a bit of a laugh, and just followed along. I reckon that I was on about 1/4 throttle, but then got done for 225km/hr. That was the BAD, but I also got the GOOD.\n\nAnother town close by is Boisdale. There was (probably still is) an unmade hill climb there where I ran the Europa a few times. It had a great setup where you ran up the hill and then straight back to the start area. On one particular day I ran, got back to the start and was told that the timer didn’t work and that I should go again straight away. It took three or maybe four runs before I got a time. I don’t doubt that I got a bit quicker each run. I ended up with a time of 36.2 sec. The hill record at that time was 36.0 in a Formula 5000 and the fast, local hotted up, stripped out cars were doing about 38.5 odd.\n\nThen I got my circuit license again and ran at Winton. Coming around the last corner (second corner now) at about 8000 rpm I broke a cam follower, then the timing chain, then coasted to the end, and had to trailer it home.\n\nA long term friend who also had a Europa had put a Mazda 13B in his and whilst it was a bit big for the space it went very well. I ended up going for a standard Mazda 12A which fitted easily and still went very nicely.\n\nBut, then someone rang one night in 1979 and offered me a job in London. I was tired of working for Esso in Sale so I went, why not.\n\nI sold the Europa for $4000 and expected that I’d soon pick up another when I got to the UK. But, there were so many other Lotus cars on the roads. And, over some time I owned: Esprit Series 1; Elan +2; Elite (1974); Eclat; Esprit Turbo; and then eventually, in my retired state, back to a Europa much like the one that I should never have sold in the first place.\n\nBut this Europa is another story, maybe for next time.\n\nBy Giles Cooper.\n\nMost Lotus have attracted a lot of attention over the years, and although the market for them may have been small, they often became well known even by the general public.\n\nWhether it was Patrick McGoohan driving a Super 7 in the TV show Prisoner during the 1960s, or the luscious Emma Peel driving her Elan in The Avengers, the cars were always known and recognised by many who would not normally be interested.\n\nPerhaps this was because being so small, quick and stylish compared to the other cars on the road at the time, they stood out; while the success of Lotus in F1 in the 60s and 70s, together with the popularity of Jim Clark, all kept the Lotus marque well up in the public eye. The ever-present (and readily available) Lotus Cortina also maintained the popularity of the marque with the public.\n\nThen, in the 1980s, things went a bit quiet for Lotus. The Formula 1 team faded from the limelight, especially after the death of its founder Colin Chapman in 1982, and with only the Eclat, Excel and the Esprit, and later the S2 Elan, on the market, Lotus recognition rested largely with the James Bond underwater Esprit, and more recently the Esprit in movies like Pretty Woman in 1990 and Basic Instinct in 1992.\n\nIn 1996, everything changed dramatically for Lotus (and for the better) when the Elise Type 111 was released for sale, and within a very short time people realised what a ground-breaking and exciting car it was. Sales far exceeded expectations to the point where, by 1997, there was a 2-year wait list in order to get a new car. (I know, I had to wait that long for mine!) This was unheard of in the Lotus world. The ongoing success of the S1 then led to the S2, followed by the change from Rover to the Toyota engine to enable the car to go to America, and in the meantime the Exige followed, and special editions were released from time to time.\n\nThe little-known Project M120 was created in 1998 to try to build a hardtop Elise coupé, and the photo shows it to be an interesting design heavily based on the S1 Elise at the front. Unfortunately, the project was suspended. From 2000 to 2005, Lotus diversification continued as they produced the Vauxhall VX220 / Opel Speedster using a GM 2 litre engine, which helped to keep the company momentum going. Meanwhile the sporty Elise and the more track-focused Exige continued successfully, aided by considerable USA sales.\n\nThen in late 2006, the Europa name from the 1960s was revived – it was actually heavily derived from the 1998 Elise Coupé / M120 Project. The addition of a fixed roof had greatly stiffened the chassis, allowing the high side sills to be lowered considerably, and the door sizes increased to make access easier and these design changes were carried through in the Europa. However, there was a problem – the Europa S as it became known, Type 121, was marketed as a GT car in the true sense of Grand Touring, but somehow it seemed to miss the mark. People either preferred the open top Elise, or the track focused Exige, and the new Europa seemed to fall in between. For some reason it just didn’t sell. Maybe it was because it was based heavily on the Vauxhall VX 220 with its longer chassis and 2 litre turbo GM engine, but it just didn’t take off. Originally 5,000 units were predicted to be sold in the USA alone, with many more in Europe and overseas. In the end, despite the introduction of an upmarket SE model, total manufacture was only 456 cars by the end of production in 2010, of which 50 were factory built to SE specifications. (2006 – 197, 2007 – 179, 2008 – 48, 2009 – 26, and 2010 – 6)\n\nThere is probably no valid reason why this model failed, but perhaps my own personal experience helps to explain it.\n\nIn early 2007, LCQ held their monthly meeting at Zupps in Mt Gravatt, who had just been appointed as the new Lotus dealer for Brisbane. In their showroom that evening was a newly arrived Lotus Europa S, and we pored over it. I sat in the car – and my only thought was “what’s the point?” At 995 kg, it didn’t have the no-frills lightweight approach of the Elise, nor did it have the sporting potential of the Exige. True, it boasted a more powerful engine with 195 hp, but at almost 1000 kg, it was full of heavy leather, carpeting, and other ‘luxurious’ features, and also had premium pricing. It was also perhaps still thought of as a Vauxhall in our purist Lotus minds? Most of us never really considered the car again, and they seemed to disappear from not only our consciousness but also from sight. How many have you seen on the road?\n\nMeanwhile I continued to enjoy my S1 Elise, even taking it on a tour of the USA in 2012, where I enjoyed track time at Laguna Seca, went up Pikes Peak, and then, after touring many Lotus Clubs around the western USA, I even took it up the infamous Ice Trucker’s Highway to the Arctic Circle – to date the only Lotus of any description to make it to the Alaskan Arctic Circle. But I digress…\n\nDuring my Elise trip to America I realised I wanted to keep traveling around the world by car, and particularly to drive down to the bottom of South America. But to do so in an Elise was not only slightly impractical, at my age as I passed 65, was also getting a little uncomfortable, more so when camping in a small tent than when I was actually in the car. So, I sold my Elise, truly believing that was the end of my Lotus owning life. I sold all my tools, race-gear and spare parts. I then spent the next 2½ years driving most of the way round the world in the Toyota Landcruiser that had replaced the Elise, and loving every minute of it – Alaska again, Central America, South America all the way down to Ushuaia, then on to Europe, and Africa.\n\nIn March 2016, when I was in London with another Australian Lotus owner, we saw a Lotus Europa S at Bell & Colvill, and Winno said to me “There’s a good car for you Giles – an old man’s Lotus”. I not only refuted his assessment of my age, but I was also still of the opinion that it wasn’t really a Lotus, so discounted it. But the seed, as they say, was sown!\n\nI realised that most of my friends around the world were linked to Lotus Clubs, and they were the people I wanted to keep in touch with. As I started asking questions about this ‘unwanted Lotus’, I was intrigued to find that only 456 had ever been built, and that they very rarely came up for sale because once people owned them, they saw what a great little car they were, and didn’t want to sell them. I looked at a couple in the UK, and they usually had about 30-50,000 miles on them, were not always in very good condition (think snow and ice and salt!), and were selling for about £20,000, which price was now slowly increasing due to their rarity.\n\nAs I spent four months driving across Iceland and Canada on the way to returning home to Australia, I had the time to think more about the idea of buying a Lotus Europa, and through a current Queensland Europa owner, I located a low km car that “might be for sale”. A few emails confirmed that the owner was in no hurry to sell and could wait till I got back here. Soon after I returned in August 2016 I inspected the car – a 2006 model, one owner, only 23,000km, and had never been out in the rain! By mid-September I was the proud owner, and the learning process truly began. As a coincidental aside, as far as we can work out, this car I have bought is actually exactly the same one that I sat in in Zupps showroom back in early 2007! The first owner bought the car new from Zupps, but only in late 2010 – the car had sat unused and unsold in Zupps for almost 4 years! And this was true of several of the other Australian delivered cars. They just couldn’t sell them.\n\n22 cars were apparently shipped to Australia at the beginning of 2007 – I have only tracked down about half of them so far. I am told that two of them have already been exported back to the UK because of their low mileage and comparatively pristine condition underneath due to our milder weather. That leaves just 20 cars in Australia, and it is unlikely that more, even second-hand, will come in because they are not on the list of approved imports into Australia, and they can only be brought in as ‘Personal Imports’, which means living overseas with the car for a minimum of 12 months before they can be relocated.\n\nSo, after all the bad press and unpopularity, what is the Lotus Europa S really like?\n\nAre they that bad? Do they deserve to be forgotten? My experience is that I was expecting it to be similar to an Elise, but it is not – it is TOTALLY different, as I realised as soon as I drove it. Obviously, it is slightly more luxurious inside, even boasting air conditioning and electric windows, but it still looks 100% ‘Elise layout’ inside. But that is where the similarity ends. With 225hp on tap from the 2 litre turbo GM engine, there is a very welcome shove in the back as you accelerate. With a slightly longer wheelbase and track, and I guess also because of the bit of extra weight and more compliant suspension, the ride is totally different. Still very much the sublime and precise Lotus handling you would expect, but just somehow ‘different’. As I start to explore the true capabilities of this ‘forgotten Lotus’, I am truly excited. I think I have found a gem.\n\nAnd as for the rarity and the design? Well, it may not be to everyone’s taste, but they are so rarely seen that most people come up and ask “What is it?”. They have never seen one before. People even ask if they can buy one new from a showroom, and I have to explain that they actually stopped producing them 7 years ago! Ironically, of the 20 remaining cars in Australia, 7 or maybe 8 of them appear to be in Queensland, and we regularly see 4 or 5 at our monthly meetings! But one thing is for sure – every owner of a Lotus Europa S seems to love their car, often because it IS different from all the other models. Maybe its initial unpopularity was just because Lotus marketed it incorrectly, aiming it at the GT market where it ran in competition to the Porsche Cayman and BMW Z4 Coupé. Maybe if it had been aimed at a different market, it would have sold better. Maybe my friend Winno was correct when he said to me in Bell & Colvill that “it is really just an old man’s Elise”?\n\nYou know what – maybe he was correct. But I love the Lotus Europa S regardless.\n\nHowever, I must also admit that I am now an old man! Maybe that is who Lotus should have aimed it at in the first place! And if it is owned by ‘older’ people, then there is hope for people who want to own one in the future – some might be coming up for sale before too long!\n\nIs the Lotus Europa S truly ‘the Forgotten Lotus’? I will leave you to decide."
