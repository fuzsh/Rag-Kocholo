        "text": "Making a new fire-pump\n\nIn 1950 (at the time of the Korean war) the specifications for fire-pumps, that the U.K. Ministry of Defence had set, were changed. Army fire-pumps had to deliver 35bhp at 3,500rpm. plus they had to be very light-weight. September of that year, Leonard Lee of Coventry Climax met his new chief engineer, Walter Hassan (1905-....) and they decided that their product needed an up-date.\n\nHassan took a close look at motorcycle technology (which at the time was ahead of cars), and in particular at the Sunbeam S7. The S7 engine was entirely of alloy, it had wedge-shaped combustion chambers, and an overhead camshaft.\n\nSeven months later, in April 1951, the first 1020cc FW engine was ready, FW for Feather Weight. When started for the first time, it ran successfully, and easily produced 38bhp. They were rewarded with a Home Office contract.\n\nRacing the engine\n\nAs Mr. Lee thought that victories in races would influence prospective buyers, it was decided that the engine would be raced. Already the gentlemen of the racing business were knocking on his door since the engine had been on display at the Earls Court Motor-show, on the marine stand.\n\nIt was obvious that the engine was not developed with racing in mind. The awkward size of 1020cc needed modification and other changes had to be made to make the FW into a racing engine.\n\nIn 1953 the FWA was delivered to the market, A for Automobile. The block had been rebored, new pistons were fitted, as were a steel crankshaft and twin carbs, alterations to the valves and ports were made and the compression ratio was increased. Power output of the little fire-pump had been increased from 38 to 72bhp at 6100rpm.\n\nThe first car to use a Coventry Climax engine in a contest was a Kieft with a 1097cc FWA. The match being the 24 hours of Le Mans in June 1954. The Kieft did not finish as its rear axle broke.\n\nSuccess\n\nThe season of 1954 saw Coventry Climax-powered cars winning races. The company found themselves in a monopoly situation. Competition mostly used much modified Ford and MG units that were expensive and unreliable.\n\nLeonard Lee did not sell any specials to anyone, not even the persuasive Colin Chapman of Lotus. Everyone was given an identical engine. And development marched on. Compression ratio was increased and later on so many changes were made that it was called the Mark II.\n\nThe absolute capacity limit for the block was represented by the FWB, of which only a few were made. These engines, that contained nearly 1500cc, were raced in 1956 by Coopers. And it was one of these cars that won the British Grand Prix in July of that year.\n\nWhen Colin Chapman started thinking up the Elite in 1957, Coventry Climax agreed to provide the engines. But only if they could be garanteed a minimum order of 1000 units. The Feather Weight Elite (FWE) was produced from 1958 to 1963. It had a relatively unstressed output of 72bhp. The Lotus 14 (Elite) was winner of its class at Le Mans on 6 consecutive years from 1959 to 1964.\n\nThese engines were also sold to Jack Brabham who fitted them (as after-market extras) to sports cars of the day. And successfully so !\n\nMr. Chapman then convinced Coventry Climax to develop an ultra-short-stroke version of the FWA. He would like one to use in the 1957 'Index of Performance' class at Le Mans.\n\nThis FWC came alive and won with ease. It needed constant high revs, having no usable power below 6000rpm, but this was hardly a disadvantage during the race. Though of course it was unsuitable as a road engine.\n\nIt did lead to further modifications in the original FW unit, as it was clear that it didn't need 1020cc to provide 35bhp. Walter Hassan and Harry Mundy developed a new unit of only 653cc, which could do what the old FW did, but was 100lb (45kg) lighter. It was named FWM, M for Marine, as it was intended for marine use. This new engine was able to operate either horizontally or vertically for outboard use. The American market remained as uninterested as they had been in 1951, despite a later increase of capacity to 745cc and intensive development.\n\nFor 1958, Colin Chapman persuaded the company to develop an enlarged (745cc) racing derivative of this engine, for his cars to use at Le Mans, when it was dubbed FWMA (Feather Weight Marine Automotive). (That year, and in the future, it was not a lucky engine for Lotus).\n\nIt was this FWMA that Mike Parkes had in mind for his Imp.\n\nThe fire-pump that wins races capacity type bore stroke compressionmax. bhp used in carbs FW1020cc 38bhp fire-pump FWA 1098cc 72.4mm 9.8 : 1 75bhp@6800rpm FWA\n\nmk 2 1098cc 72.4mm 83bhp@6800rpm FWB 1480cc 76.2mm 80mm 100bhp Coopers '56 FWE 1216cc like FWB like FWA 72bhp Lotus Elite FWC 750cc like FWA 72.4mm 45.2mm 59bhp@8000 Colin Chapman\n\nLe Mans 1957 FWP FWM 745cc fire-pump\n\nMarine FWMA 741cc 4 cil. 64.3mm 57.2mm chosen by Mike Parkes to be further developed for the Hillman Imp FWMC 742cc twin cam 83bhp @ 8200rpm ulta-lightweight Elite in the 1961 Index of Performance / Thermal Efficiency\n\n(half of a new GP engine) FWMV 1500cc V8 63mm 60mm 174bhp@8600rpm Lotus 25\n\n478kg (1052lb)\n\napprox. 173mph Webers FPF 2495cc inline 4\n\n8 valve\n\ntwin ohc 94mm 90mm 12.1 : 1240bhp@6750rpm Cooper T51\n\n118lb dry\n\n170-180mph Twin double\n\nchoke Weber\n\n38 carbs\n\nCoventry Climax is still in business, but they don't provide parts for long discontinued engines.

The trophy, dating back to 1906, which is awarded on the recommendation of the RAC's technical and engineering committee for the most outstanding British achievement in the automotive field during the year, is not necessarily annually awarded. Last time awarded: 1959 to Alec Issigonis, once a junior engineer with Coventry Climax.\n\nThe citation reads: \"Awarded to Coventry Climax engines Ltd. for the design, development and production of engines which have brought British cars to the forefront in th field of Grand Prix racing.\"\n\nThey were working on four-valve heads for the vee-8 GP engine, and if they gave more power than the two-valve heads in use at that time (which they weren't at that moment) they would release them.\n\nAutocar, 8 May 1964, p.896\n\nRacing\n\nResults\n\n1958 2 GP victories Cooper-Climax 1959 5 GP ,, Jack Brabham made champion 1960 6 GP ,, again Jack Brabham champion 1960 2 GP ,, Jim Clark in a Lotus 1965\n\nResults in 1965-66\n\nWorld Championship 1965\n\n1.

He led all the way to notch up his first of six consecutive GP wins. He came in nearly half a minute ahead of the Ferrari V8 driven by John Surtees. Clark never seemed to be pressing his Lotus-Climax 33 at any stage.\n\nThe 32-valve, 209hp Coventry Climax V8 engine was also used by Jack Brabham in his Brabham-Climax, as did J. Bonnier, D. Gurney, J. Siffert and R. Anderson. One Bruce McLaren was driving a Cooper-Climax, so were Jochen Rindt and John Love. The other Lotus-Climax V8 was Mike Spence's.\n\nClimax engined Racing cars\n\nLotus MkVIII - The third engine No. FWA ET515/6155, of 4 experimental FW engines for automotive use, was sold to Dick Steed through Racing Engines Ltd, one of Chapman's companies, for Â£250 - a great deal in 1954.

The three-wheelers occupied an anomalous position in the motoring world, always being exhibited in motorcycle shows and exhibitons.\n\nBy 1933 the fiercest Morgan was called the Super Sports Aero. The air-cooled V-twin JAP engine was mounted in front of the bonnet, fully exposed to the elements. A year later this model gave way to a less sporting version with a water-cooled Matchless engine, and in 1934 came the first four-cylinder Morgan, a 1,122 cc Coventry Climax.\n\nTriumph\n\nPrewar Coventry Climax engines were built by Triumph under licence and used in various Triumphs from 1932-1938, eg. a six cylinder Triumph/Climax ioe in a 1935 Triumph Gloria.\n\nFeather Weight era\n\nLotus Elite (Type 14)\n\nProduction: approx. 1000, 1957-1963\n\nBodystyle: Two-seater\n\nEngine: Coventry Climax FWE 4-cylinder (1216cc)\n\nChasis: all-fiberglass\n\nTVR Grantura Mark I\n\nProduction: 100, 1958-1960\n\nBodystyle: Two-seater coup\n\nEngine: Varying, 1216cc Coventry Climax FWE\n\nEngine position: Front\n\nDriven wheels: Rear\n\nFeather Weight engine for an Imp\n\nLiterature\n\nthe original registration document for Dick Steed's Lotus Mk VIII chasssis no.
