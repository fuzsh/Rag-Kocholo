Three consecutive carfulls of our own passengers were left incoherently babbling in wonderment. So what is there to say? It has to be experienced.” » Ben West — SPORTS CARS ILLUSTRATED “A Riding Comfort and Safety that must be Experienced to be Comprehended.” “Suspension characteristics are certainly the most outstanding encountered... There is French legend that should a CITROEN be accidentally driven off a mountain bend, into thin air, the driver needs only sufficient power at the front wheels to bring him safely back to the road.

YOUR HEADQUARTERS FOR PORSCHE AND VOLKSWAGEN ACCESSORIES MOTOR OILS CHOICE OF CHAMPIONS Englebet TIRES FOR STREET OR COMPETITION very sincerely yours: Sebring 12 Hours of Endurance in the June issue, in order to get out a report on what happened as soon as possible. To do this we had to hold up a page form and do a rush job on the story. The result was not as good as it could have been. This year we decided there was no point in lousing up a really good story just to slam into print a running account of something everybody knows about anyway. Instead we have covered Sebring '57 in depth — rather than reporting what happened we have gone to some pains to find out why and how various things occurred. We wanted to find out the complete story behind the teething troubles of the SS Corvette which we can say is potentially one of the world’s hottest sports cars. We also wanted to discover as much as possible about the Ferrari and Maserati armaments for the coming year. Putting this mass of informa- tion together takes time but it’s worth it as you will see next month. Anyone who can read a newspaper or weekly news magazine knows by now who won and who lost. But if you want to know why they won or lost, join us in next month’s issue when we give you the dope on the cars that faced the world’s toughest car-breaker. * * a & * , year ago we covered America’s premier sports car race, the Speaking of car-breakers we have a preview in this issue of something that promises to be a real test of machinery. For the first time since World War Two a real international challenge is shaping up between American and European racing equipment on an equal footing. Scheduled to take place on the banked 2.5 mile oval at Monza late this month — the 29th to be exact — it should be a real hair-raiser. SCI’s roving correspondent Hans Tanner tells us that the subsurface under the slabs was not allowed to settle with the result that each slab sinks as the car runs over it. This gives a rather interesting effect in that the front wheels have to bounce up onto the next slab while the back wheels drop down off the preceding slab. As Hans puts it the over-all effect is something like barreling up and down the city hall steps for three hours at 160 miles an hour. We’ve handicapped the race in our lead article this month, pointing up the advantages and disadvantages of each type of machine, As of this writing everything is set except for the posting of the starting money — an Italian responsibility. If they don’t put up, it'll be no race. However they want to win this one perhaps more than any other race except the deciding Grande Epreuve so the chances are better than six, two and even it'll come off. + * * oa * Getting back to Sebring for a moment, there were a couple of items gave us pause. When GM does things they do them in a great big way, even their mistakes (for which, considering their “new boy” status in racing, they can be forgiven.) They were ready for everything except going fast — they had more executives, specialists, press-agents, stylists and camp followers than one could readily count. They also had a couple of red hot and proven hardtop Corvettes, the SR-2 show car and a thoroughly unproven star — the beautifully executed SS. It was a wonderful organization; everybody had a job and one job only. Jurisdiction was rigidly adhered to, even unto painting numbers on cars (styling). And the result was chaos. * e * . * Incidentally, if you’ve turned to the center of the magazine and missed the monthly LaTourette cutaway, it’s up front on pages 28 and 29. Alfred of New York decided he liked SCI seven four-color pages worth. For which we're properly grateful.

Dexter Burritt’s Rapids Ontario, Canada shoestring racing Gentlemen: 1 am looking for a cheap racing special that would be easy to race and build. A Formula III car would be the thing to build, but for lack of competition in the 500 class here in Ontario, it just wouldn’t be worth my while. Do you think I could build a car for Class H on the same lines as the Cooper 500, that, is, a Vincent twin motorcycle engine, a Burman box and Fiat suspension parts, etc. What do you think? Yours sincerely, Graham Hill Ontario, Canada Why not try the new Canada Class? This is a natural. Story on it appears in this issue.—Ed. fast shuffle Dear Editor: Got a '56 XKI40MC Jag. Love to tinker, but can’t. Reason: can’t get a shop manual. Can, and do, however get the old shuffle —shuffle when I ask for one. Seems Cov- entry hasn’t issued this information. When I ask if local mechs are feeling their way, I get the shifty: eye and the brush. Can you tell me whether such info is available? Where? How? Sincerely, Al Riedel, Los Angeles, California If the distributor in Los Angeles can’t or won't help, maybe Jay Chamberlain in Burbank can help out.

Victory Blvd. Burbank, California long haul Dear Sirs: I am about to embark on a trip to Penn- sylvania during which I will be towing my ‘56 Austin Healey and driving a station wagon. I would like to know if anything need be done to prepare the A.H. Should I put some of the baggage in it for added weight? I’m presently running 26 and 28 psi in the front and rear tires—should it be lower for towing? Yours truly, Richard F. Snyder Bergstrom A.F.B. Austin, Texas The ideal way, of course, is to use a trailer but these items are scarce and practical only for the guy who races constantly and consistently. For a short haul, say up to 40 or 50 miles all that’s needed is a good tow-bar, preferably one that attaches to the towed vehicle at two widely separated points. For a haul such as you contemplate, however, two things are advisable. First, the drag-link should be removed so that the steering sector box is not worked against itself. Second, the drive shaft should be removed so that the transmis- sion is not in constant motion. Towing a car against the transmission reverses the thrust faces of the gears along the output shaft even though disengaged and also im- poses strains on the output bearings. It also reverses the thrust faces of the universals. Your tire pressures are alright as they are, though they shouldn’t be any higher.— Ed. likes us Dear Sirs: May I take this opportunity to con- gratulate you on a terrific magazine. I seldom write “fan” letters but you de- serve one. There are several features in SCI that I appreciate. You are one of the few publications to pay any attention to the long-neglected but ever so _ interesting 750 cc class. I have owned three Crosleys thus far and hope eventually to acquire a Crosley Super Sports. The 750’s are not glamorous in the sense that a Cad-Allard or a D Jag are, but they do allow an enthusiast in modest circumstances to match skill against others. Your write-ups of Poole’s PBX and the Austin 7 were ex cellent. So many other publications cover the same equipment—yours handles some of the equally interesting but less publi- cized cars. Also, your treatment is much more precise and informative than that of some other mags. I am irritated often when I read that a “What Four” corners well for its size and that a “Pickup Six” has good weight distribution for an American car. Your system allows an in- dividual to narrow down his choices nicely, as it is much more informative for me to know that a given car is such as such as compared to others of similar price or specs. A rose too for your paper and clear photos. It grieves me to get a photo of one of my beloved 750’s and be able to tell about it only by the caption. Sincerely, Carl Solheim Waukesha, Wisc. P.S. If you wonder about the background of one of your fans—I’m a teacher of mentally handicapped children, 31 years old, own a Hillman,and a Crosley, have owned one °'34 Ford, three Crosleys and one Hillman, and intend to stay with the wee ones. mg national races Sirs: Will you pleaseinform your readers that the 1957 MG National Races will be held on August 25th at the Upper Marlboro, Maryland course which has been expanded to approximately two miles.

AUTOBOOKS BURBANK 6 19 2708 B Magnolia Boulevard CALIFORNIA TECHNOTES By KARL LUDVIGSEN PLYMOUTH HANDLING I own a 1951 Plymouth Concord, which at present has no torsion sway-bar. It has 6.40 x 15 tires which are run with 28 psi rear and 30 psi front (cold). would like to improve its roadability, the goal being faster safe driving on winding roads. A moderate increase in ride “hard- ness” could be tolerated, 1. Assuming a sway-bar installation is advisable, what should it be: Plymouth, Dodge, standard or export, other? 2. How about different shocks: new Oriflow standard, renee type, another brand? 3. Should front coil springs having a stiffer-than-stock spring rate be installed? 4. Do you recommend continued use of my stock tires, or a change to 6.70 x 15, which I believe was standard on some other '51 Plymouth models? Any pressure changes? Any other suggestions? John McCafferty San Diego, California We’re glad to get questions on road- ability, since we’d like to emphasize this aspect of home modifications much more. To attempt to answer your questions in order: 1. I question the use of a sway-bar, at first anyway, as it will tend to decrease front end cornering power. Perhaps after other changes, and then only a small- diameter standard part. 2. Good bet would be to install export- type or Columbus tubulars all around, and add adjustable Houdaille dampers all around. This would give initial good control plus a variable additional amount. Beware, though, of overdamping and un- derspringing. F. Yes, by all means fit stiffer springs. There should be export parts here also, and possibly for the rear leaf springs as well. Otherwise you should do some search- ing for heavier coils, from heavier cars. 4. For moderate use those tires should be adequate, but for really hard corner- ing you should look into the Firestone Super Sports 170 or similar high-loading casings. Any increase in section size should be matched by a widening of the rim base; pressures are okay. 5. You might also consider American Rusco or Italian Fren-Do brake linings, plus vents and scoops for the front back- ing plates. Also, put in one inch lower- ing blocks in the rear, only if you’re also prepared to install a transverse Panhard rod, pivoted at the frame on one side and just above the spring clamp on the axle at the other side. This will give you solid axle location, a lower center of gravity, and a slight rearward weight shift to give more consistent response to the wheel. If you’re not worried about performance, a 100-pound bag of shot in the trunk will work wonders for handling. NOT SO SIMPLE I would like to set you straight on a little matter concerning reversing of Re- nauit engines and gearboxes. When you try to fit the differential carrier and ring gear in its reversed position you will’ find it impossible to do so because, at the top, the ring gear interferes with the clutch shaft splined coupling, and at the bottom the ring gear hits the case where the drain plug is located. You have to cut the case at this point and make clear- ance, and then weld the hole closed. Above, the coupling and ring gear must be ground away for clearance, —J. F. Swarthout East Hampton, Conn. Our sincerest apology, and thanks for the informed dope (see SCI, Jan. ’57). PORSCHE: 1500 TO 1600? I noticed in the article “More Push for the Porsche” (January, 1957), that the 1600 Porsche cylinders are interchange- able with the 1500 on the late three- piece case, This is nice for the fortunate owners of the late cases, but can the 1600 cylinders be adapted to the earlier two- piece case? Would the necessary machin- ing be such that the engine would come unglued at the slightest provocation? Chuck Wingfield Boulder, Colorado The 1600 and later 1500 Porsche cylin- ders will definitely not fit the early two- piece crankcase. When the crankcase was changed to allow the separate front cover, they left the crank (and cylinder spacing) the same, and altered the camshaft, tap- pets, cylinders and cylinder head. The change that matters is the spacing of the long hold-down studs, which were spread out in the later version to allow the even- tual expansion to 1600 cc. It might be possible, as was done with Devin’s Nor- ton-Panhard, to plug the existing siud holes and redrill and tap for the new spacing, but strength could not be guar- anteed. Your best bet would be the strok- ing process as outlined in our article. ORPHANED JOWETTS I would like to know if there is any information available on performance of the Jowett Jupiter, and if there are any parts available. Why did they discontinue production? I have just purchased one and would like to know what I have and what I haven't. Joseph Stafford Meridian, Mississippi Production at the Jowett works was apparently discontinued for purely fi- nancial reasons, since the car itself in sedan, roadster (your car) and competition form was excellent for its engine size. Jowett was also one of the very oldest English firms. Their assets were acquired by the English branch of the Interna- tional Harvester Corp., who then said that they’d try to supply spare parts. The address was Jowett Cars Ltd., Idle, Brad- ford, Yorkshire, England. Bore and stroke are 72.5 x 90 mm, and on an 8/1 compression ratio 60 bhp were produced by 1\\% liters at 4500 rpm. Two Zenith 30 V.1I.G.5 carburetors are fitted. The Champion L118 plugs are set at .020- 025 gap, and points are gapped at .010- 012 inch. Intake valve clearance is .004 inch, while exhaust is .008. SAE 30 oil is prescribed for the engine and transmis- sion, and the axle takes SAE 90 hypoid oil. Its standard ratio is 4.56/1. Maximum speed of the Jupiter was 86 mph, with top up, and it would get to 60 in 18 seconds flat. A standing quar- ter mile could be covered in 20.5 seconds. The front/rear weight distribution is 55/- 45, and tire pressure should be 26 pounds all around. We hope this data will be of use to other Jowett Jupiter owners. FRONT-DRIVE STABILITY The article by Merwin Dembling on front wheel drive in your November, 1956 issue was very interesting, especially as re- gards his “flywheel effect”. Merwin de- scribes a chassis layout with large masses at the ends of the chassis as unstable, and a chassis layout with the large masses at the center of the vehicle as stable. I think Merwin will find that as the large masses are moved from the center of the vehicle to the extreme ends, the moment of inertia increases in proportion, as does the stability of the vehicle. This increased stability causes the automobile to track more readily in a straight line and pro- duces an understeering effect. With the large masses concentrated at the center of the vehicle, the moment of inertia is decreased as is the stability. The automobile will become more sensitive to side winds, driver control, etc, James L. Postma Chanute AFB, Illinois You are quite right, in one respect. Fundamentally, the high polar moment of inertia caused by placing the main masses as far apart as possible does indeed increase the resistance of the chassis to slewing caused by external forces. It’s harder to jar the car off a straight line, but by the same token, once lost the car is harder to get back on a line again. I disagree, however, with your remark that a high polar moment causes under- steer. Steer effect is a function of suspen- sion layout and front/rear distribution of weight, but not mass distribution with re- lation to the central pole. The tendency of most front drive cars to place most of the weight in the front auto- matically gives them a strong understeer characteristic. At the same time, the center of gravity is moved forward closer to the center of wind pressure when in motion, so in spite of the low polar moment a rea- sonable amount of resistance to side winds is maintained.

By KARL LUDVIGSEN HE OLD-TIMERS of the racing game often recall with some nostalgia the days before World War I, when automotive competitions were on a truly international level, and teams could journey over the Atlantic in either direction without premonitions of ridicule. Cars, rules, and courses were still similar the world over, and the “Classics” included the Gordon Bennett and Vanderbilt Cup races and the growing French Grand Prix. Before and after that war, however, the two continents began to go their separate ways, and by the middle twenties the schism was virtually complete. Real road racing had long been barred in the United States, and a system of artificial tracks was well established. Europe was still enjoying the variety of road competition, and their machines differed more and more from ours each year. Indy is still one of the world’s greatest races, and the Ital- ians want that honor very, very much. Just how much is be- coming clear by the day. The 500 is great not only because of 12 its considerable history, but also because it is The Race for American competition cars and drivers. There is a Grand Prix of Europe, to be sure, but it’s passed from country to country to prevent nationalism from getting a toehold. Grands Prix started with the French, who still feel pretty paternal about the whole thing though they’ve been out of the running for some time. Italy now calls the tune, thanks to Maserati and Ferrari, and this new-found authority urged them to complete the remarkable Autodrome at Monza, which gave them one of the finest European racing plants, Not content with the fast- est and most brutal continental event, though, the Monza organizers have issued a challenge that may result in the greatest race the world has ever seen. If it takes place as planned on June 28th—more about the details later—there will be a head-on conflict between American and European racing ideas that will settle a lot of bitter arguments. Grand Prix and Indianapolis cars are as far apart in de- = — a ie: tt te OO a9 - i Het. z ¥3 (ie = ene od 4 Mey fa | Tens ryt.

In neither case does the designer have to worry about lights, fenders, a passenger or similar restrictions, with one very important exception. Great tech- nical interest and neck-and-neck racing are provided by sig- nificant limitations on design, which may concern weight, engine capacity, fuel consumption, bore size, body dimen- sions or whatever the assembled organizing bodies may choose. In 1938 and 1939 the international Formula restricted engines to 3 liters supercharged and 414 liters unblown, and this was observed in both Europe and Indiana. After the war the FIA convened and altered the limits, but the AAA de- cided to let things slide and keep the old ones for the 500. Yet another change took place overseas in 1954, and the pres- ent Formula matches 750 cc. blown cars against 21% liter un- blown machines. This is scheduled to continue through 1959, with the exception that 100 octane straight aviation fuel will be compulsory from 1958 on. With international interest growing, Tony Hulman de- cided to bring his Speedway slowly back into line with the rest of the world. For '57 the limits are 4.2 liters unblown, and 2.8 liters with blowers. This is a timid step, but it was taken late, and assures that plenty of machinery will come to the line. The same rules, plus the same race length and direc- tion of running (counter-clockwise) will hold for the Monza match race, which is to be contested among the ten fastest cars and drivers from both Europe and America. For the first time since the war, Indy and Grand Prix cars will be side-by- side on the same starting line. The date set is June 29, almost a month after Indy, and a rain date has been set in deference to American racing methods. Just as important, since the Europeans are taking this Monza race very seriously (There’s money in it, gents!) they’re building some special 4.2 liter cars for it, and they have nothing else to do with these machines than to bring them over to Indy! As a result, it may work both ways, and 13 | ARS ILLUSTRATED ’ Ad SPORTS ( Photo by Wilson Suspension of 500F Kurtis chassis for Novi is typical Indy fabricated type. Disc brake is simple, light, and plenty adequate for Monza. the issue promises to be hard-fought indeed. So the outcome won't be a complete surprise, let’s see who has the best chances, and why. Differences between courses have naturally forced the vari- ations between GP and Indy cars, and Indy in particular has encouraged a high degree of specialization. As a series of smooth-radiused, slightly-banked left hand turns spaced out by alternately long and short straights, it lends itself well to cold pre-race calculation. The “corners” are being taken at around 135 mph., and the straights are short enough to em- phasize acceleration. Surfacing is very smooth, as race tracks go, and the race duration is long at 500 miles. The continental designer has many more problems in fit- ting his cars to a wide variety of courses, Corner speeds may range from 30 mph to flat out, and may go left, right, up, down or two at the same time. Every conceivable kind of paved surface is used, with added hazards like the sand at Zandvoort and the sea spray at Monte-Carlo. Many European Photo by Wilson Front suspension of Maserati 250F. It’s typical forged, machined GP style. The steering tie rod locates between top and bottom wishbones. tracks have fast bends which resemble the Indianapolis turns, and Berne and Monza (using the road section) seldom cause cornering speeds below 90 mph. The trend overseas is definitely toward specially-built tracks as are used in Eng- land, Holland, Germany and Italy, and the real-road courses personified by Monaco, Rheims and Spa are falling into dis- favor due to supposedly inferior spectator control. Placement on the Championship list, which allows the name of “Grande Epreuve,” calls for a minimum race length of three hours or 312 miles, and races are not called on account of rain. Car performances determined by these conditions can be compared by setting up some broad categories of ability. We can discuss Cornering Acceleration (positive and negative) , Top Speed and Durability. The importance of the first category has often been pooh- poohed at Indianapolis, but no owner, driver or mechanic will deny that handling is a critical problem at today’s quali- fying speeds. They still put their foot in it and turn left, but Old Indy standby is still a tough contender, and should be particularly good at Monza where speed is even, and more nearly constant. 14 This new 4-cam Ferrari V12 is hot in sports cars, and may be enlarged from 3.5 liters to 4.2 for Monza or Indy.

BOS 2 the motions combine to set up a four-wheel drift that uses every available shred of traction, Such a maneuver demands a healthy amount of understeer as well as complete precision of steering and suspension, and the former has been provided by the front/rear tire charactertistics, a forward engine mounting and a high front roll center. Precision derives from a simple and rigid design plus many late hours for the mechanic. Low-speed handling never happens, and since the corners are so smooth there is no real justification for independent suspension. Solid axles have thus dominated the picture since the front-drive era, and have been combined with the latest in fully-adjustable torsion bar setups. Also, since the turns are all to the left, designers have been able to bias the weight inward and thus balance out wheel loadings and tire wear. Actually, for varied corners the torsion bar settings could be changed to counteract this. Interestingly, advances in European driving methods since Reduced to 4.2 liters, new 4508S Maser V8 looks good for Monza or Indy This version has carbs angled earliest were vertical. RIGHT: Tire punishment at Monza is shown on rear of Ferrari at ’56 Italian GP. in; the war have closely paralleled those in the US, and cars must now understeer more and more to complement their drifting drivers. All the methods described for the Indy car apply to the modern Grand Prix machine, with the impor- tant addition of a high polar moment of inertia, as cham- pioned by Mercedes after 1936, This is obtained by separat- ing the main masses (say the engine at front and the driver, fuel and final drive at the rear) as much as possible, and re- sults in a high level of directional stability. Altogether the fastest GP cars tend strongly to go in a straight line, which makes them great for fast bends but a handful on slow corn- ers. A good example was the nose-heavy Ferrari “Super- Squalo”, which was a dream on the fast Spa circuit but had to be hauled around the hairpins at Monte-Carlo. Ferrari also modified the Lancia D50’s to get similar handling. Reconciliation of high and low speed requirements is be (Continued on page 53) lllustration by Carlo Demand from The Big Race, courtesy Robert Bentley The first lap of practice was enough to curdle the blood of lesser men.

Then Enzo slips the Sleepy Old Man from the Argentine a No-Doz pill and he wins the World’s Championship and you find you really didn’t need a program to tell the men from the boys after all. In these days, when it seems hard to tell whether a man is a driver, a playboy member of the nobility, a garage owner advertising his business, or a walking ad for the non- aicoholic beverage industry, it’s nice to take a look back at a driver who was born to racing like Machiavelli was to politics. His name is painted freshly each year along the route of the Mille Miglia and he’s the yard stick by which we've measured every drive since his time. His name: Tazio Nuvolari. Of all his fantastic exploits, there is one that never fails to intrigue the enthusiast and one that little has been said about — his winning the English TT in 1933 in an MG Magnette. Whatever possessed Nuvolari to accept the MG com- pany’s offer to drive a Magnette in the TT probably only the MG accountant would know. Nuvolari had probably never seen a Magnette, much less driven one. Only one man on the MG team had any command of Italian. This reduced all important communications between Nuvolari and the English to the level of sign language. Also im- portant was something that Nuvolari couldn’t have known, but might well have suspected, the dice were loaded as far as this particular race was concerned. Run on the Ards circuit near Belfast, Ireland, it was a handicap race with the cars handicapped by classes ac- cording to engine capacity and whether they were super- charged or not. The handicap was expressed in laps and time, each lap being equal to almost 14 miles. A 750 cc supercharged car was considered to have covered three laps before it started; an 1100 cc unsupercharged, two laps; and an 1100 cc supercharged, one lap. The 1500 cc cars were also given one lap, while cars three litres and over were made to cover the full distance of 35 laps. In addition to this, a time allowance was given at the start, some classes being sent away at definite intervals before the others. This handicap, to those who were familiar with racing in England, completely ruled out the chances of blown Master mechanic Alec Hounslow ac- knowledging the checker at the end of the gruelling ’33 TT. Nuvolari at wheel of MG Magnette, hottest 1100 cc of that time. ee Hounslow and I| Maestro, wreathed, victorious despite competition from top English racer Hugh Hamilton, severe handicap and language barrier. 1100’s and left the blown 750’s with a time allowance. These, the MG Midgets, were developing into fantastically fast cars and were almost certain winners. So, on form the Magnettes were outsiders, their handicap speed being figured at almost 78 mph — one mph in excess of the previous year’s lap record. Understandably, the MG people were betting on their 750 blown Midgets and indeed, had a man considered the best driver in England at the time driving one. He was Hugh Hamilton, who was later to lose his life in a Maserati Formula | car on the continent. Nuvolari could hardly have come because this was going to be an easy race. In these years in sports car races, a riding mechanic was compulsory and in this, Nuvolari was in luck. The MG people appointed 22 year old Alec Hounslow as his riding mecnanic. Cool, resourceful, and without temperament, Nuvolari himself couldn’t have chosen a better man. A couple of pre-practice happenings are worth noting here. In spite of the fact that Nuvolari wasn’t given much of a chance, the faith of the oil companies in his ability should have served as a warning for those who were all out for Hamilton. The oil companies had a battle royal trying to sign him up for the race. The oil in the crankcase was changed a dozen times before the bidding stopped. The other thing was that Nuvolari, on being introduced to the car he was to drive, looked it over, made no comments and asked that only one thing be changed. This was the seating position. It took Hounslow, with help, 19 hours to get it right. The entire night was spent with little blocks of wood, raising and lowering the seat fractions of an inch at a time until the fitting was satisfactory. The first practice lap was enough to have made a lesser man catch the first boat back to Italy. The intricacies of the Magnette’s pre-selector box had not survived the dis- organized communications and made this first lap a shatter- ing thing. With the pre-selector box, it was necessary to first move the lever, or the quadrant, to the gear you wanted. Then, by depressing the clutch pedal all the way to the floor, the change of gear was actuated, but it had to go all the way to the floor. This little nicety had somewhere gotten lost in faulty conjugation of the verbs. So, when he changed down, Nuvolari was selecting the lower gear with the lever, (Continued on page 56) 17 Bob Hanna gets checkered flag after taking first at Harewood. Requirements for Canada class as drawn up by CASC include a minimum track of 40 inches, a minimum wheelbase of 80 inches. Appearance regulations rigidly enforced. CANADA CLASS N last month’s SCI, “Very Sincerely Yours” led off on a subject that’s kicked around (and usually down) when- ever road racing men congregate: so-called “produc- tion” racing. Competitions from the Mexican Road Race to the second ten-lapper on the card at Thompson have shown that the building and preparation of a strictly stock automobile, even without hidden hop-ups, can run well over the tab of a thoroughly raceworthy special. The problem’s acute in America, where the sheer unpleasant- ness of production class racing has driven many men to the modifieds, or out of racing altogether. In Canada the situation was never so shoddy as it~ is here, yet similar objections arose. Among the active dis- senters were Ian Sword and the late Peter Dillnutt, both of whom had long been associated with racing on two continents. Sword had been a member of the group which was largely responsible for starting Formula III after the war. He served as president of the British Empire Motor 18 Club, and is now chairman of the Harewood Development Committee. Peter Dillnutt was an avid sports car fan, and did a lot of racing. One evening these two settled down for a session of bench racing, and came up with some very logical pro- posals that led to the now-flourishing Canada Class. Similar in many respects to the 750 and 1172 formulas in England, it promises exciting, cheap and efficient racing. Sword and Dillnutt believed that production racing killed the incentive for specials, thus discouraging me- chanical initiative. Also, the tendency was for sports car racing to become so expensive as to be prohibitive for those of average means. This could cause sports car racing to follow the same fate as some other forms of auto racing which have faded away due to the high cost of the machinery and the similarity of the cars. The two friends conceived the idea of a class of “Spe- cials” which could be built at a reasonable cost and which By EDWARD MONROE From Canada’s backyard comes a competition class that could be the answer to the eternal quest for a really honest form of “poor man’s road racing.” Morris Minor suspension, steering, and final drive are fitted to the Buckler Mark XV frame, which in itself weights only 60 pounds. would stimulate latent engineering and mechanical abilities. And, being “Specials,” they would help promote spectator interest in the sport. They visualized a car powered by an « ich as a modified Crosley, with similar overall dime ind with a rather stark, yet presentable, body. It was originally in- tended that the cars should have a single seat but many builders preferred a two seater as this could also be used as a road car. Consequently rules were revised to allow two seater cars. Small economy cars are numerous in Canada. There is an abundance of Crosley, Renault, Fiat, Ford Prefect and Anglia, Austin A-30 and A-40, Morris Minor, Standard and VW. These cars retail at $2000 or under in Canada when new, so components from these cars can be obtained for specials at a reasonable price. The VW engine is outside the displacement limitations finally established for this class (OHC 750cc, OHV 950cc, SV 1200cc), but other com- Chassis of the Withey- Brown special.

The engines from these cars could be souped up to ap- proximately the same output, and the chassis components are of suitable proportions for a handy little racing car. Most were so constructed that suspension components could be removed from the original frame and assembled on a special light-weight frame. Also, since all these cars have approximately the same overall dimensions, parts could be scrambled according to the ingenuity of the builder to give optimum performance. For example, the gearbox from the side-valve Morris Minor is well suited for competition and has been installed not only on OHV Morris Minors but on other engines such as Crosley, and it can be bolted to the Perfect engine bell housing without an adapter. Some build- ers prefer to turn the VW gearbox and adapt it to their engine.

To insure that the proposed class of cars would really go, and to avoid baby carriage racing, it was decided that the use of alcohol as a fuel should be permitted. In order to use alcohol efficiently various engine modifications are necessary. For example: compression ratios should be in- creased, breathing improved, the fuel system and carbure- tion modified to handle the increased volume of fuel, and the exhaust system improved to reduce back pressure. Special pistons, valves, springs, bearing materials and exhaust systems would be permitted, special alloy flat cyl- inder heads could be used on the SV engines, and in the case of the SV Morris Minor, it was thought that the special OHV Alta head should be allowed, to enable this reliable little engine to develop approximately the same bhp as 20 the others. The first-place-winning Autosport Special was powered by one of these engines, equipped with an Alta head (See 1957 rules regarding engines) . Actually, this may have’ been going a bit too far. Most of the engines listed, when modified for alcohol and installed in a car having a suitable racing body, should drive it along at approximately 100 mph. A fuel tank of at least five gallons capacity should be used. To avoid push starts, all cars should be equipped with a starter. Driver protection was given special consideration, and it was decided that this could best be accomplished by having a stiff roll bar mounted in the cowl (this bar to be not less than 20 inches [by the latest rules] above the lowest body or frame member), by the installation of a metal firewall between driver and engine, by requiring floor boards and a metal tunnel to enclose the prop shaft where it passes through the cockpit, safety belt, an aero screen in front of the driver, and by stipulating that the exhaust system must extend beyond the rear axle. The appearance of the cars was also thought to be very important, particularly if spectator interest was to be main- tained. To keep the cost of the cars from getting out of hand it was ruled that they were to be made from parts of cars which retailed in Canada for $2000 or less when new, and to prevent unlimited money being spent for light alloys, a minimum weight of 750 pounds was fixed. It has been suggested that the cars be built to a price limit. However, Mr. Sword felt that this would lead to a class of very rough cars. It should be emphasized that it was not intended to be a class for cheap, junky cars, but rather for good appearing, well-built specials at a reason- able total cost. After much discussion with other leading lights of motor sport in the Toronto area, a set of rules for Canada Class cars were drawn up, incorporating these ideas. These rules were then submitted to the Canadian Automobile Sports Committee. Time prevented several cars from competing during the 1956 season, and most of those that did compete were not complete as to body work. However, at the present writing five additional Canada Class cars are under construction in the Toronto area alone, and it is expected that there will be enough machines to provide some very interesting racing in Canada Class during 1957. The regulations pertaining to the appearance of the cars will be more rigidly enforced, now that the program has gotten on its feet. The “Specifications for Canada Class—1957” were drawn up by the CASC, of which Mr. R. C. Evis of Toronto, Canada is the Competition Chairman. Minimum track requirement is 40 inches and minimum wheelbase 80 inches. Engine specifications for 1957 read in part: “all must be normally aspirated. Original engine parts may be modified. The only non-original parts allowed are pistons, valves, springs, bearing materials and exhaust systems.” Following are descriptions of some typical cars.

Cornering and roadability were of usual Corvette caliber. On this curve, car is a wee bit bent; sticking but building heavy loading on outside rear tire. Vf DUAL ROAD TEST DUAL QUAD AND INJECTED CORVETTES Aside from fuel injection, this Corvette looks much the same as others. There were two differences in the two cars—The injected Chev had hardtop, and the carbureted model had a soft top. 22 EVROLET?’S injection is a premature baby, but it’s still alive and kicking. It was prematured by a sudden jolt from the collective Plymouth and Ford styling depart- ments, and without a major body change Chev needed a : potent sales weapon. The decision to bring out fuel injection was made very, very late in 1956—virtually on the introduc- ‘ tion deadline. ‘i At that time it was still what engineers call a “breadboard layout”—a combination of units that work properly, but aren't fully developed and integrated into one mechanism. It’s still very much that way. Moreover, the Rochester engi- neers are very competent carburetor designers, but didn’t have nearly enough time to adapt their techniques to the wholly different problems of injection. In spite of the fact that the new arrival had long been expected, then, its arrival was not without complications, The above are facts, but in spite of them the Chevy “Ram- doubt being due to slight variations between the cars tested. the injected car, with the hardtop alone, weighed 120 pounds less than the carbed machine, which was toting the more complex soft top mechanism. Also, rear end ratios were 3.70 with the injector and 3.55 with the carbs. Advantage is taken of the better fuel distribution of FI by upping the compression ratio to 10.5/1, while the standard car had 9.5/1. This is a logical follow-up step, and does not “favor” the injection so far as our tests are concerned. The same can’t be said of the weight and rear end discrepancies, which woul 1 tend to help the FI car at the bottom end, though very slightly. Starting the dual-quad car was easy, by twisting the igni- tion switch, though some care was needed to avoid flooding on hot starts. Once warmed up, the idle was low enough at 500 rpm, but it was full of lumps and shook the car bodily. This can be handed to the competition cam, which was Corvette will drift in 75-80 mph range, as here, using power for control high up in second gear. In this case however damp concrete surface left little or no margin for error. Behavior could be predicted if rear end were.stiffer. jet” constant-flow injector works very well indeed. The big question, of course, is: How does it stack up against carbs? To find out, we set up a full transcontinental '57 Corvette road test, involving our entire testing staff. On the West Coast an injected machine was obtained from the factory representatives, while on the East Coast a dual-quad version was provided by Alvin Schwartz Chevrolet and Shelly Spin- del, of Brooklyn.

The dual-quad se:up is by now a familiar one, so rigged that the rear carb runs all the time and the front one cuts in only at about % throttle. The engine was cold when we first twisted the switch on the Ramjet Corvette, but the engine caught on the first spin, bursting into a wholesome clatter of solid tappets jingling at a warmup idle of 1400 rpm. We raised the hood and studied the injection system. It looked purposeful but very different from the racing-type setups we know best. . . at present. A tiny copper tube, about the diameter of a pencil lead, runs from the pump to each of the nozzles which are located on the manifold at each of the intake ports. The tubes look fragile. We looked with distrust on solenoids, diaphragms, flex-cable drive, and complex linkages each of which might be a point of failure. The single throttle body and venturi are not in accord with American ideas on racing injection, but resemble both carburetor practice and overseas applications. It’s no handi- cap, as long as‘the orifice is big enough, and as long as ram intake tubes can be accommodated, and it gives very good metering for a wide operating range. As these points were observed the engine coolant rose to about 170 degrees F. and the idle dropped to a mere 1200. We had occasion to switch off, and the next lesson in FI came when we tried to restart. Nothing happened; the starter ground on and on and the engine didn’t even cough, So we tried treating it like a flooded carbureted engine and put the throttle on the floor. The engine caught within three spins, The remainder of our test bore out the fact that, while Chev’s FI has the cold-start problem whipped, hot starts are rugged unless you use this simple trick. Our test car’s 1200 rpm idle seemed excessive and we ex- perimented with this adjustment which is utterly simple and consists of a spring-loaded screw in the throttle body, Playing with this adjustment is not remotely critical and it is easy to obtain a decent idle of 450 to 500 rpm which is identical to the carbureted car. This casts interesting light on the con- troversy of continuous-flow injection versus timed-flow, Chev's being the former. However, there is so little torque at this rev level with the competition cam that it is very easy to kill the engine. Experiment showed that about 950 rpm is an all-around good idle speed. With this rapid an idle, you must first briefly engage high gear in order to slip silently inte low when standing still. On both cars, the action of the throttle linkage itself left a lot to be desired. The accelerator pedal travel is so short that you can’t feather these potent engines, and the action is erratic and plagued with lost motion. In the bargain, the dual quads are at their worst at the bottom end. As a result the throttle response of the standard Corvette was unpredict- able and slow, though things do happen in a big way after it takes a deep breath. This was still a handicap to clean control and rapid downshifting. In sharp contrast, and making allowance for the tiny link: age, the throttle response with FI was instantaneous, It’s as though there’s a system of levers between the throttle pedal and your back. Press the throttle a little bit and your back is pressed, NOW, to the same extent. Slam the throttle down and your back is slammed, NOW, even in high gear. Second cog is so close to high that the slam is only slightly harder. but low gear is fairly low—2.20/l—and it really delivers a punch. These things happened with the dual-quad engine too, but never with the immediacy of the injected Chev, es- pecially at low revs and low manifold vacuum. The cold figures, available for your inspection, are pretty phenomenal.

That’s the old, old story of the Offy, which from howling midg- et to the Indy “air compressors” has been unbeatable in flat-out track competition. Every once in a while one of the road racing boys renounces his European allegiance and takes a good look at one of these native torque-producers, but more often than not he’ll toss it out with a casual “cams no good for road use; can’t carburate it for gas, and besides you can’t keep a clutch or a crank in it.” Noting the amount of interest from the tight-corner crowd, and apparently fed up with amateurish tuning at- tempts, Meyer-Drake has had a Class F road-racing version of their midget mill available for some time now. The fact remains, however, that a lot of good work has been done by individuals, largely with the straight midget version of the Offy, and indeed the most consistently successful M-D powered road duster in the country falls under that heading. The parlay of a sharp Offy with a board-flat Italian chassis paid off handsomely for Dave Michaels and his associates, who started creating an Offy-Bandini in December of 1954. Except for a very few retirements, every race entered since that time has produced a trophy for the collection, In spite 26 7 a -down Offy-Bandin echnical Kepo THE OFFY THAT RAN A lot of Offenhausers have been put on road courses but fewca. match Dave Michaels’ Bandini bomb. 7 II By KARL LUDVIGSEN of a modest displacement of 1625 cc., it held the two liter record at Thompson for a year and a half, and lost it only to Masten Gregory and a brand new Testa Rossa, It just goes, that’s all, being the result of a happy combination which even its creators can’t quite define. Michaels Engineering of Belleville, New Jersey houses and makes goodies for the car, while Dave drives it and gets his hands dirty on it. In the tradition of specials, though, the chassis and drive line are the property of Jim Mathews of Newark, while the powerplant is supplied by Fred Sinon. Many others have invested time and money in the Offy- Bandini, including Paterson’s Offy experts, the Ken-Mar Ma- chine Shop, but Dave and Jim have sweated more than most. This little Meyer-Drake is moving, all right, but so are some others, and the chassis in this case makes the difference. Built in Italy by Ilaris Bandini, the machine was first raced in this country by Jim Pauley and put up a good show with a reasonably hot Siata-Fiat rocker-box four. This meant good roadholding, achieved by a straightforward layout well executed in detail. Two oval-sectioned tubes are the main frame members, and are joined at the front by a fabricated box structure and at the rear by a network of square, round and oval tubes. Those side members are nice for this work, and can be duplicated in the back yard by PBY aircraft struts. Many stock Fiat parts are used in the running gear, the front suspension being an unequal-wishbone layout from a 1400 Fiat. Arm pivots and kingpins are conventional, and long coil springs enclosing telescopic shocks are supplement- ed by an anti-roll bar. Steering gear is 1100 Fiat, giving two and three quarters turns from side to side of a very wide lock. A short drag link to a center bell crank provides con- sistent control with equal-length track rods. Springing at the back is classic, with the frame under- slung and the axle carried by two semi-elliptic leaf springs. These have nine leaves at the center clamps, and eyes which are unusually formed as an integral part of two complete leaves. Bandini supplied two adjustable radius rods to help the springs soak up axle drive reaction, and Michaels fitted yet another rod below the axle housing as a finishing touch, diagonally-bracing the frame accordingly. The springs han- dle lateral location, while Columbus shocks damp out their motion. Brakes have never given the slightest trouble, thanks to careful attention to basically production parts. Tromping on the Fiat master cylinder draws fluid from the remote res- ervoir and sends it to a single one-inch cylinder per wheel. Fren-Do competition linings are both bonded and riveted to the cast aluminum Fiat shoes, while the vented Al-Fin drums are eleven and ten inches in diameter front and rear respectively. Deep finning and drilled backing plates help dump the heat. The left-side hand-brake lever actuates an internal expanding drum brake of dubious origin mounted at the axle pinion. The cowl structure is the only non-removable part of Bandini’s light and handsome body, which originally shroud- ed the tires in unsprung cycle fenders. Michaels has raced the car in Unlimited without these and the elongated nose section. Full belly-panning is fitted from the firewall back, leaving Dave’s very unstreamlined head and shoulders as the main source of turbulence. Shoving all this along is the faithful Meyer-Drake, which by now is an old hand at this road racing business. It was first used some four years ago in Sinon’s right-hand-drive 1950 MG TD, and there drove the much-lowered car through an MG gearbox and a 4.55 rear end. Since those days it has remained strictly Offy throughout, the only major changes being a steady upgrading of the internals to the latest factory specifications, The crankcase nose is offset two inches to the right and is supported at two frame points by a forged cross bar. A mount below the gearbox replaces the more common firewall support for the rear. Dave readily admits that while this Offy certainly delivers the goods, it’s not because of any radical conversions to gasoline fuel. In fact, in most respects the induction equip- ment remains strictly alky, after extensive experimentation with other types. Dave first tried two sidedraft Norden carbs, both with a gas manifold and with the larger-diameter al- cohol log. They seemed to run too lean at the low end, so twin one-and-a-quarter inch SU’s were the next choice. These, however, were excessively touchy and couldn’t pass enough air, and the nod finally went to two one-and-a- quarter inch sidedraft Rileys, fitted with alcohol venturis and .060 inch main jets, and mounted on the alcohol mani- fold. Fuel is drawn from the 10.5 gallon tank by twin Bendix pumps and supplied to a block at a pressure of four pounds per square inch, Lines from the block to the Riley float bowls are of identical length. Head porting remains fully machined, as stock. The cam drive gearing at the front end is of the latest design, and has been used to rotate several different sets of Nose of the Offy crankshaft is offset two inches to right, facing front of the car. Large diameter free-flow exhaust setup is not tuned, but ts adequate for present intake, and timing. Competition brake linings are bonded and riveted to cast aluminum Fiat shoes. Brake drums are cooled by deep fins and holes drilled in backing plates. Flat belt from a lathe grinder drives Lucas generator hinged transversely ahead of engine.

To reduce possibility of recurrence, rear flywheel flange was ground to serve as thrust surface. Stroke on the new crank is 3% inches. cams. On occasion Michaels has run #5 cams, which have an intake duration of 266 degrees and 48 degrees of overlap. These sticks bring the power in with a bang at 4800 revs, which has worked out on long courses where the Offy gets a chance to wind. For shorter runs, like Cumberland or Thompson, the more modest #4 cam with 41 overlap de- grees and a 260 degree intake duration gives more horses low down out of the corners. In either case the valves are of equal size and are poked down .400 inch on the intakes and .375 inch on the exhausts. Stem clearances are set be- tween sixteen and eighteen thousandths, with seat angles of 45 degrees, while valve spring pressures when fully com- . pressed are 165 pounds on the outer coil and 90 on the inner. Offy valve lash is set by welding up the stems and grinding down to suit, with shims regarded as a last resort. Exhaust manifolding is a simple fabricated free-flow set- up of large diameter, with no attempts at true tuning. With the present timing and intake arrangements there’s no real need for anything more elaborate, but Dave is now the owner of tw. more Rileys and is planning a four-port rig, with which a proper scavenging exhaust would go very well. At first, the bevel-driven cross shaft, at the engine front, rotated an American Bosch magneto, which had its advance fixed at 22 degrees. Solely to avoid backfire when starting, a switch was made to a championship-type German Bosch unit with a manual advance from 5 to 22 degrees. Plugs are 18 millimeter Champions, R1’s being the usual wear with R7’s if the day turns cold. Specially long races may bring out a set of RJ11’s. Excellent view of final drive assembly shows how Fiat axle bevels are welded to the inside of the MG TC differential carrier. Riley carburetors, set to original Midget specifications, work perfectly on gas on the Offy. Michaels plans to add two more Rileys on a four-port intake rig. Rear joint on Fiat tubular drive shaft bolts to pinion flange that’s Fiat on outside, MG TC on the inside. Internal expanding drum brake is of dubious origin. Moving on down, we find short, full-skirted pistons that are cam-ground and Nurlized. They run at a skirt-to-wall clearance of .004 inch in a bore that has been ground out twice and now mikes out at exactly 3.000 inches. Three Grant rings are carried, below a markedly domed head that gives a 10.4 to one compression ratio. Lower domes provided 8 to one back in the MG days. Aluminum plugs locate the full-floating steel wrist pins in their bores. The connecting rods are of the most recent pattern, with a bronze little-end bushing and Federal-Mogul inserts on the two and three-quarter inch diameter big ends. All the bearings are extremely wide, which in part accounts for the support of only three mains for the fully machined crankshaft. These three-inch diameter mains, though, are poured into their removable diaphragm assemblies and then line bored when the latter are bolted into the barrel-type crankcase. A negative Magnafluxing junked the first crank, of 3.5 inch stroke, after one hard season in the MG. It was re- placed by a late-design unit with 354 inch stroke and hard- chrome journals, which one day gave up the ghost just for- ward of the rear main. Among the steps taken to minimize the possibility of recurrence was the grinding of the eight- holed rear flywheel flange to serve as a thrust surface. Pre- viously the rear half of the crank had to transmit clutch thrust to the customary surfaces on the center main. The stroke is now back at 3.5 inches.

ES NP I LEFT: looking East along the Marina. Maceo Park is at the left. BELOW: Fangio, in usual winning form, flashes past Maceo Park, Fuel line trouble on Portago’s car assisted in his win. a tS ESE RR HE old man was just cruising. You could tell from the sound of the 300-S Maserati he wasn’t really pushing —yet. He’d been out on the course only an hour and there wasn’t any rush, not with two more hours to go for that practice period. He wasn’t exactly creeping either, though. Fangio never creeps in a race car. He just hadn’t really turned on the tap yet, though; two minutes, 10 seconds per lap. Fair but not fair enough to win a race on that circuit—just fast enough to learn every bump and slick spot, every place where water might come over the sea wall and every place where some kid could leap out in front of a race car. Down the Malecon drive to Maceo Park, around the park and back up the Malecon along the seawall past the U.S. Embassy to Marti Children’s playground, left into the Vedado, hard left again and through a series of doglegs and out onto the Malecon— three and a half miles in two minutes and ten seconds. Quick, but not quick enough to win, just fast enough to learn the way, to find out that Havana’s streets are smooth and very, very slick, and that the Habanero will walk un- heeding directly in front of a race car. Or reach out to touch it for luck. So El Chueco” practiced. Lap after lap. Finally the pitch of the engine rose a little: two minutes, eight seconds. Then a little higher: two minutes, six seconds, Then a pit stop. A quick conference. A few more laps: two minutes, four seconds, Fast enough for fastest time of day. The counter- point of 3.5 Ferrari bass had resulted in 2:5-plus for Hill and Portago. The old man had learned the course. It was good enough. Later it would be good enough to win—but not without a fight. There was the late Eugenio Castellotti. There was Stirling Moss, out to show that a good little man in a good little car could put up a scrap in any league, There was Phil Hill in a going 3.5 Ferrari, Carroll Shelby in the biggest car in BY JOHN CHRISTY Shelby, in second place, leads Moss out of turn in the Vedado section. Police kept crowd off street as cars went by, but when road was clear spectators dashed from one side to the other. the race and, on paper, the fastest, a 1.9 Ferrari. There were Peter Collins, World Championship runner-up for the year before, Olivier Gendebien from Belgium, and Masten Gregory, a savage pusher from the U.S. circuits and new boy on the Ferrari factory team. And then there was Portago —Marquis Alfonso de Portago (and a dozen other names) —a man whose very life is based on winning at anything. From pinball in a beer parlor to bobsledding in Switzerland, you name it, Portago lives to excell. But the old man from Argentina had experience, a fast car and a plan. And he had practiced. For six hours he had practiced in the three-liter Maserati, until he knew every culvert, every bump in that section of Havana. Race day came and with it the Habaneros and Habaneras, 70 thousan"
