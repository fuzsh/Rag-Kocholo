        "text": "One chemical compound comes to my mind: Carbon monoxide.\n\nIts boiling point is -191.5 °C so it may stay gaseous at this temperature. The atmosphere does not have to be completely out of that stuff to be deadly to humans. Even a concentration of less than 1% is lethal enough. Regarding your oceans, I don't think you would have a liquid ocean at that temperature. Take as an example the article \"Does salt water expand as much as fresh water does when it freezes?\", Source. In this article look at the graph \"%NaCl by weight\". The lowest melting point (Eutectic point) of sea-water is achieved at 23.3% NaCl by weight, lowering melting point to just -21.1 °C. More phases in the graph here.\n\nTo make your ocean liquid at this stage would require lots of deep sea geothermal vents.\n\nHypothetical chlorine planets can have a liquid ocean with a eutectic temperature just below -70 °C with 25% by weight of hydrochloric acid in water according to this wikipedia phase diagram.\n\nIf you don't want to use exotic compounds, take Titan as an example. The main oxygen-based compound - water - is solid, so the whole atmospheric cycle is based on carbon compounds. It is similar in many respects to a carbon planet. Carbon monoxide is in trace amounts but you can increase it by volcanism. The planet may be younger than Earth, hence more active, yet not active enough to melt all the oceans and become habitable. Methane and other hydrocarbons are colorless. However, they may react with solar radiation and polymerize into tholins. These tholins stain the atmosphere into the orange opaque color associated to Titan."
