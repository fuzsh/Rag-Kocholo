        "text": "The Criegee intermediate acetone oxide, (CH3)2COO, is formed by laser photolysis of 2,2-diiodopropane in the presence of O2 and characterized by synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry and by cavity ringdown ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. The rate coefficient of the reaction of the Criegee intermediate with SO2 was measured using photoionization mass spectrometry and pseudo-first order methods to be (7.3 ± 0.5) × 10 11 cm3 s 1 at 298 K and 4 Torr and (1.5 ± 0.5) × 10 10 cm3 s 1 at 298 K and 10 Torr (He buffer). These values are similar to directly measured rate coefficients of anti-CH3CHOO with SO2, and in good agreement with recent UV absorption measurements. The measurement of this reaction at 293 K and slightly higher pressures (between 10 Torr and 100 Torr) in N2 from cavity ringdown decay of the ultraviolet absorption of (CH3)2COO yielded even larger rate coefficients, in the range (1.84  0.12) × 10-10 to (2.29 ± 0.08) × 10-10 cm3 s-1. Photoionization mass spectrom...\n\nThe kinetic parameters are determined firstly using Freeman and Carroll method and the results are compared with the data developed by Zsako Procedure. A short experimental technique for recording the thermogravimetric curves for the complexes on a NETZSCH Simultaneous Thermal Analyzer STA-409 has also been discussed here. The existing Percentage weight of the complex at equal temperature intervals i.e., 10°C were noted directly from TG curve for a particular stage of thermal decomposition A plot of ∆log dw / dt / ∆log w, versus T-1 x 10-3 / ∆ log W has been drawn for the stage of decomposition under consideration. Background: The transition elements and main group elements can form coordination compounds, or complexes, in which a central metal atom or ion is bonded to one or more ligands by coordinate covalent bonds. Ligands with more than one donor atom are called polydentate ligands and form chelates. The common geometries found in complexes are tetrahedral and square planar (both with a coordination number of four) and octahedral (with a coordination number of six). Cis and trans configurations are possible in some octahedral and square planar complexes. In addition to these geometrical isomers, optical isomers (molecules or ions that are mirror images but not superimposable) are possible in certain octahedral complexes. Coordination complexes have a wide variety of uses including oxygen transport in blood, water purification, and pharmaceutical use. Materials and Methods: 40 ml of ligand (0.02 M) in ethanol was mixed with 40 ml Cobalt (ii) Bromide (0.01 M) in ethanol. The resulting solution was refluxed for half hour on a steam bath reddish brown colour precipitate was obtained. The Precipitate was filtered off and washed with ethanol and dried in a desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2. 45 ml of ligand (0.02 M) in ethanol was mixed with 45 ml copper fomate (0.01 M) in ethanol, the resulting solution was refluxed half hour on a steam bath, bluish green colour percipient was obtained. Precipitate was filtered and dried in a desiccator over anhydrous CaCl2. Results: The kinetic parameters are determined firstly using Freeman and Carroll method and the results are compared with the data developed by Zsako Procedure.
