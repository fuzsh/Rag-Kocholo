        "text": "Treatment of 1,7-diphenyl-1,6-heptadiyne and a symmetric butadiene such as 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene with Co2(CO)8 (5 mol%) in CH2Cl2 at 110 Â°C under 30 atm CO for 18 h afforded a 5.5.6 tricyclic enone in high yields. For unsymmetrical dienes such as 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, and 3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, two separable regioisomers were obtained. The catalytic reactions described are experimentally quite simple and provide a very useful synthetic procedure for the syntheses of [5.5.6] tricyclic enones."
