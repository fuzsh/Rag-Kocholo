        "text": "Electronic structure of the alkyne-bridged dicobalt hexacarbonyl complex Co(2) micro-C(2)H(2) (CO)(6): evidence for singlet diradical character and implications for metal-metal bonding.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlatts, James A; Evans, Gareth J S; Coogan, Michael P; Overgaard, Jacob\n\n2007-08-06\n\nA series of ab initio calculations are presented on the alkyne-bridged dicobalt hexacarbonyl cluster Co2 micro-C2H2 (CO)6, indicating that this compound has substantial multireference character, which we interpret as evidence of singlet diradical behavior. As a result, standard theoretical methods such as restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or Kohn-Sham (RKS) density functional theory cannot properly describe this compound. We have therefore used complete active space (CAS) methods to explore the bonding in and spectroscopic properties of Co2 micro-C2H2 (CO)6. CAS methods identify significant population of a Co-Co antibonding orbital, along with Co-pi* back-bonding, and a relatively large singlet-triplet energy splitting. Analysis of the electron density and related quantities, such as energy densities and atomic overlaps, indicates a small but significant amount of covalent bonding between cobalt centers.\n\nDynamics of tungsten hexacarbonyl, dicobalt octacarbonyl, and their fragments adsorbed on silica surfaces.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuthukumar, Kaliappan; ValentÃ­, Roser; Jeschke, Harald O\n\n2014-05-14\n\nTungsten and cobalt carbonyls adsorbed on a substrate are typical starting points for the electron beam induced deposition of tungsten or cobalt based metallic nanostructures. We employ first principles molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics and vibrational spectra of W(CO)6 and W(CO)5 as well as Co2(CO)8 and Co(CO)4 precursor molecules on fully and partially hydroxylated silica surfaces. Such surfaces resemble the initial conditions of electron beam induced growth processes. We find that both W(CO)6 and Co2(CO)8 are stable at room temperature and mobile on a silica surface saturated with hydroxyl groups (OH), moving up to half an AngstrÃ¶m per picosecond. In contrast, chemisorbed W(CO)5 or Co(CO)4 ions at room temperature do not change their binding site. These results contribute to gaining fundamental insight into how the molecules behave in the simulated time window of 20 ps and our determined vibrational spectra of all species provide signatures for experimentally distinguishing the form in which precursors cover a substrate.\n\nDicobalt-Î¼-oxo polyoxometalate compound, [(Î±(2)-P2W17O61Co)2O](14-): a potent species for water oxidation, C-H bond activation, and oxygen transfer.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarats-Damatov, Delina; Shimon, Linda J W; Weiner, Lev; Schreiber, Roy E; JimÃ©nez-Lozano, Pablo; Poblet, Josep M; de Graaf, Coen; Neumann, Ronny\n\n2014-02-03\n\nHigh-valent oxo compounds of transition metals are often implicated as active species in oxygenation of hydrocarbons through carbon-hydrogen bond activation or oxygen transfer and also in water oxidation. Recently, several examples of cobalt-catalyzed water oxidation have been reported, and cobalt(IV) species have been suggested as active intermediates. A reactive species, formally a dicobalt(IV)-Î¼-oxo polyoxometalate compound [(Î±2-P2W17O61Co)2O](14-), [(POMCo)2O], has now been isolated and characterized by the oxidation of a monomeric [Î±2-P2W17O61Co(II)(H2O)](8-), [POMCo(II)H2O], with ozone in water. The crystal structure shows a nearly linear Co-O-Co moiety with a Co-O bond length of â¼1.77 Ã . In aqueous solution [(POMCo)2O] was identified by (31)P NMR, Raman, and UV-vis spectroscopy. Reactivity studies showed that [(POMCo)2O]2O] is an active compound for the oxidation of H2O to O2, direct oxygen transfer to water-soluble sulfoxides and phosphines, indirect epoxidation of alkenes via a Mn porphyrin, and the selective oxidation of alcohols by carbon-hydrogen bond activation. The latter appears to occur via a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Density functional and CASSCF calculations strongly indicate that the electronic structure of [(POMCo)2O]2O] is best defined as a compound having two cobalt(III) atoms with two oxidized oxygen atoms.\n\nMolecular Recognition in the Oxidation of Catechols by Dicobalt-BISDIEN Dioxygen Complexes\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-01-30\n\nRecognition in the Oxidation of Catechols by Dicobalt-RISDIEN Dioxygen Complexes Lizete F S Cezar and Bruno Szpoganicz Departamento de Quimica ...bridged bi- nuclear Co(II)-BISDIEN dioxygen complexes; Co20 2 LCat2 + is the bivalent form, and Co20 2 (OH)LCat + and Co 20 2 (OH)2 CatÂ° are hydroxo\n\nCharacterization of Nanoporous Materials with Atom Probe Tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nPfeiffer, BjÃ¶rn; Erichsen, Torben; Epler, Eike; Volkert, Cynthia A; Trompenaars, Piet; Nowak, Carsten\n\n2015-06-01\n\nA method to characterize open-cell nanoporous materials with atom probe tomography (APT) has been developed. For this, open-cell nanoporous gold with pore diameters of around 50 nm was used as a model system, and filled by electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) to obtain a compact material. Two different EBID precursors were successfully tested-dicobalt octacarbonyl [Co2(CO)8] and diiron nonacarbonyl [Fe2(CO)9]. Penetration and filling depth are sufficient for focused ion beam-based APT sample preparation. With this approach, stable APT analysis of the nanoporous material can be performed. Reconstruction reveals the composition of the deposited precursor and the nanoporous material, as well as chemical information of the interfaces between them. Thus, it is shown that, using an appropriate EBID process, local chemical information in three dimensions with sub-nanometer resolution can be obtained from nanoporous materials using APT.\n\nLa0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-Î´ impregnated oxygen electrode for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Haoyu; Tian, Yunfeng; Zhang, Lingling; Chi, Bo; Pu, Jian; Jian, Li\n\n2018-04-01\n\nHigh-temperature H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis through reversible solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) provides potentially a feasible and eco-friendly way to convert electrical energy into chemicals stored in syngas. In this work, La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Ni0.2O3-Î´ (LSCN) impregnated Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC)-(La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3-Î´ (LSM) composite oxygen electrode is studied as high-performance electrode for H2O/CO2 co-electrolysis. The LSCN impregnated cell exhibits competitive performance with the peak power density of 1057 mW cm-2 at 800 Â°C in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode; in co-electrolysis mode, the current density can reach 1.60 A cm-2 at 1.5 V at 800 Â°C with H2O/CO2 ratio of 2/1. With LSCN nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of GDC-LSM to maximize the reaction active sites, the LSCN impregnated cell shows significant enhanced electrochemical performance at both SOEC and SOFC modes. The influence of feed gas composition (H2O-H2-CO2) and operating voltages on the performance of co-electrolysis are discussed in detail. The cell shows a very stable performance without obvious degradation for more than 100 h. Post-test characterization is analyzed in detail by multiple measurements.\n\nMixed-valent dicobalt and iron-cobalt complexes with high-spin configurations and short metal-metal bonds.\n\nPubMed\n\nZall, Christopher M; Clouston, Laura J; Young, Victor G; Ding, Keying; Kim, Hyun Jung; Zherebetskyy, Danylo; Chen, Yu-Sheng; Bill, Eckhard; Gagliardi, Laura; Lu, Connie C\n\n2013-08-19\n\nCobalt-cobalt and iron-cobalt bonds are investigated in coordination complexes with formally mixed-valent [M2](3+) cores. The trigonal dicobalt tris(diphenylformamidinate) compound, Co2(DPhF)3, which was previously reported by Cotton, Murillo, and co-workers (Inorg. Chim. Acta 1996, 249, 9), is shown to have an energetically isolated, high-spin sextet ground-state by magnetic susceptibility and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. A new tris(amidinato)amine ligand platform is introduced. By tethering three amidinate donors to an apical amine, this platform offers two distinct metal-binding sites. Using the phenyl-substituted variant (abbreviated as L(Ph)), the isolation of a dicobalt homobimetallic and an iron-cobalt heterobimetallic are demonstrated. The new [Co2](3+) and [FeCo](3+) cores have high-spin sextet and septet ground states, respectively. Their solid-state structures reveal short metal-metal bond distances of 2.29 Ã for Co-Co and 2.18 Ã for Fe-Co; the latter is the shortest distance for an iron-cobalt bond to date. To assign the positions of iron and cobalt atoms as well as to determine if Fe/Co mixing is occurring, X-ray anomalous scattering experiments were performed, spanning the Fe and Co absorption energies. These studies show only a minor amount of metal-site mixing in this complex, and that FeCoL(Ph) is more precisely described as (Fe0.94(1)Co0.06(1))(Co0.95(1)Fe0.05(1))L(Ph). The iron-cobalt heterobimetallic has been further characterized by MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy. Its isomer shift of 0.65 mm/s and quadrupole splitting of 0.64 mm/s are comparable to the related diiron complex, Fe2(DPhF)3. On the basis of spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations, it is proposed that the formal [M2](3+) cores are fully delocalized.\n\nCo2(CO)8-catalyzed intramolecular hetero-Pauson-Khand reaction of alkynecarbodiimide: synthesis of (+/-)-physostigmine.\n\nPubMed\n\nMukai, Chisato; Yoshida, Tatsunori; Sorimachi, Mao; Odani, Akira\n\n2006-01-05\n\n[reaction: see text] Herein we describe a novel Co(2)(CO)(8)-catalyzed intramolecular aza-Pauson-Khand-type reaction of alkynecarbodiimide derivatives affords pyrrolo[2,3-b]indol-2-one ring systems in reasonable yields. This is the first reported Co(2)(CO)(8) successfully applied in the hetero-Pauson-Khand reaction. Significantly, the transformation of one of our pyrrolo[2,3-b]indol-2-one derivatives into the indole alkaloid, (+/-)-physostigmine, was completed in a highly stereoselective manner.\n\nTetramethyl thiourea/Co2(CO)8-catalyzed Pauson-Khand reaction under balloon pressure of CO.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Yefeng; Deng, Lujiang; Zhang, Yandong; Dong, Guangbin; Chen, Jiahua; Yang, Zhen\n\n2005-02-17\n\nA Pauson-Khand type of conversion of enynes to bicyclic cyclopentenones employing the commercially available Co2(CO)8 and tetramethylthiourea (TMTU) as catalysts is described.

Specimens were prepared by deposition of each precursor onto silicon posts and shaped into sub-70-nm radii needles using a focused ion beam. The utility of the depositions was assessed using several criteria including composition and uniformity, evaporation behavior and evaporation fields, and depth of Ga+ ion penetration. Atom probe analyses through depositions of methyl cyclopentadienyl platinum trimethyl, palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate, and dimethyl-gold-acetylacetonate [Me2Au(acac)] were all found to result in tip fracture at voltages exceeding 3 kV. Examination of the deposition using Me2Au(acac) plus flowing O2 was inconclusive due to evaporation of surface silicon from below the deposition under all analysis conditions. Dicobalt octacarbonyl [Co2(CO)8] and diiron nonacarbonyl [Fe2(CO)9] depositions were found to be effective as in situ capping materials for the silicon specimens. Their very different evaporation fields [36 V/nm for Co2(CO)8 and 21 V/nm for Fe2(CO)9] provide options for achieving reasonably close matching of the evaporation field between the capping material and many materials of interest.\n\nMixed-Valent Dicobalt and Iron-Cobalt Complexes with High-Spin Configurations and Short Metal-Metal Bonds\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZall, Christopher M.; Clouston, Laura J.; Young, Jr., Victor G.\n\n2013-09-23\n\nCobaltâcobalt and ironâcobalt bonds are investigated in coordination complexes with formally mixed-valent [M 2] 3+ cores.

Self-saturated growth mechanism is verified by x-ray reflectivity measurements. As-deposited films consist of both the crystalline phases; CoO and Co{sub 3}O{sub 4} that gets converted to pure cubic-Co{sub 3}O{sub 4} phase upon annealing at 500âÂ°C under ambient condition. Elemental composition and uniformity of the films is examined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion-mass spectroscopy. Both as-deposited and the annealed films have been successfully tested as a catalyst formoreÂ Â» hydrogen evolution from sodium borohydride hydrolysis. The activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction in the presence of the as-grown catalyst is found to be ca. 38âkJ mol{sup â1}. Further implementation of multiwalled carbon nanotube, as a scaffold layer, improves the hydrogen generation rate by providing higher surface area of the deposited catalyst.Â«Â less\n\nModified ZIF-8 mixed matrix membrane for CO2/CH4 separation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNordin, Nik Abdul Hadi Md; Ismail, Ahmad Fauzi; Misdan, Nurasyikin; Nazri, Noor Aina Mohd\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTunability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) properties enables them to be tailored for specific applications. In this study, zeolitic imidazole framework 8 (ZIF-8), sub-class of MOF, underwent pre-synthesis and post-synthesis modifications. The pre-synthesis modification using GO (ZIF-8/GO) shows slight decrease in textural properties, while the post-synthesis modification using amine solution (ZIF-8/NH2) resulted in superior BET surface area and pore volume. Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) derived from polysulfone (PSf) and the modified ZIF-8s were then prepared via dry/wet phase inversion. The polymer chain flexibility of the resulted MMMs shows rigidification, where ZIF-8/NH2 as filler resulting higher rigidification compared to ZIF-8/GO. The MMMs were further subjected to pure CO2 and CH4 gas permeation experiments. The PSf/ZIF-8/NH2 shows superior CO2/CH4 selectivity (88% increased) while sacrificing CO2 permeance due to combination of severe polymer chain rigidification and the presence of CO2-philic group, amine. Whereas, the PSf/ZIF-8/GO possess 64% increase in CO2 permeance without notable changes in CO2/CH4 selectivity.\n\nImproving CO2 permeation and separation performance of CO2-philic polymer membrane by blending CO2 absorbents\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheng, Jun; Hu, Leiqing; Li, Yannan; Liu, Jianzhong; Zhou, Junhu; Cen, Kefa\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo research effects of CO2 absorption capacity and type of CO2 absorbent on the CO2 separation and free-volume properties of facilitated transport membranes, two types of CO2 absorbents, namely monoethanolamine (MEA) and ionic liquids (ILs:[P66614][Triz] and [P66614][2-Op]), were adopted. The CO2 absorption capacities of MEA, [P66614][Triz] and [P66614][2-Op] were about 0.561 mol CO2 per mol, 0.95 mol CO2 per mol and 1.60 mol CO2 per mol, respectively. All mean free-volume hole radiuses of membranes decreased after blending CO2 absorbents. After polymer membrane blended with two ILs, number of free-volume hole increased, resulting in modest increase of the fractional free volume. Both CO2 permeability and selectivity increased after blending MEA and ILs. The increasing range of CO2 permeability corresponded with CO2 absorption capacity of CO2 absorbents, and membrane blending with [P66614][2-Op] showed the highest CO2 permeability of 672.1 Barrers at 25 Â°C. Pebax/PEGDME membrane blending with MEA obtained the highest CO2/H2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity at 17.8 and 20.5, respectively.\n\nHow does the spin-state of Co ions affect the insulator-metal transition in Bi2A2Co2O8 (Aâ=âCa, Sr, Ba)?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Xiaokun; Zhang, Weiyi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe misfit layered Bi2A2Co2O8 (Aâ=âCa, Sr, Ba) compounds experience an insulator to metal transition as Aâs ionic radius increases. This feature is contradictory to the conventional wisdom that larger lattice constant favors insulating rather than metallic state, and is also difficult to be reconciled using the Anderson weak localization theory. In this paper, we show from the first-principles calculation that an insulator-metal transition takes place from a nonmagnetic low-spin state of Co3+ ions to a hexagonally arranged intermediate-spin low-spin mixed-state in CoO2 plane when ionic radius increases from Ca to Ba. The predicted low-spin state of Bi2Ca2Co2O8 and Bi2Sr2Co2O8 and intermediate-spin low-spin mixed-state of Bi2Ba2Co2O8 are consistent not only with their measured transport properties, but also with the magnetic-field suppressed specific-heat peak observed at the transition temperature. In agreement with experiments, strong electronic correlation is required to stabilize the low-spin insulator and intermediate-spin low-spin metal.

Although NiCo2S4 has been considered as one of the promising positive electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitors, the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4-based positive electrodes is still relatively low and cannot meet the demand in the devices. Herein, NiCo2S4/Co9S8 nanorods with a large capacitance are synthesized via a simple two-step hydrothermal treatment. A high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor operating at 1.6 V is successfully assembled using the NiCo2S4/Co9S8 nanorods as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, which demonstrates a fairly high energy density of 49.6 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 123 W kg-1, an excellent capacitance of 0.91 F cm-2 (139.42 F g-1) at current density of 1 mA cm-2 as well as a remarkable cycling stability due to the high physical strength, the large specific surface area, and the good conductivity for NiCo2S4/Co9S8 nanorods and the brilliant synergistic effect for NiCo2S4 and Co9S8 electrode materials. The as-prepared NiCo2S4/Co9S8 nanorods open up a new platform as positive electrode material for high-energy-density asymmetric supercapacitors in energy-storage.\n\nFacile synthesis of CoNi2S4/Co9S8 composites as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Fenglin; Huang, Wanxia; Zhang, Hongtao; Zhou, Dengmei\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn this paper, a facile chemical bath deposition method was utilized to synthesize three-dimensional nanostructured CoNi2S4/Co9S8 (CNSCS) composites as advanced electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors. CNSCS composites showed remarkable electrochemical performance owing to the high porosity, appropriate pore size distribution, novel architecture and synergistic effect of Ni/Co ions. The electrochemical tests revealed that CNSCS composites exhibited high specific capacitance (1183.3 Fg-1 at the current density of 2 Ag-1), excellent rate performance (74.9% retention with tenfold current density increase) and outstanding cycle life stability. Moreover, the effect of temperature on electrochemical performance of CNSCS composites was investigated and the results indicated the specific capacitance of CoNi2S4/Co9S8 can keep relatively stable in a wide temperature from 0 Â°C to 50 Â°C. These results indicated that the synthesized CNSCS composites can be a promising electrode materials candidate for supercapacitors and chemical bath deposition is a promising processing route for CNSCS composites production.\n\nThe Monitoring of Sallow CO2 Leakage From the CO2 Release Experiment in South Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, H. J.; Han, S. H.; Kim, S.; Son, Y.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis study was conducted to analyze the in-soil CO2 gas diffusion from the K-COSEM shallow CO2 release experiment. The study site consisting of five zones was built in Eumseong, South Korea, and approximately 1.8 t CO2 were injected from the perforated release well at Zones 1 to 4 from June 1 to 30, 2016. In-soil CO2 concentrations were measured once a day at 15 cm and 60 cm depths at 0 m, 2.5 m, 5.0 m, and 10.0 m away from the CO2 releasing well using a portable gas analyzer (GA5000) from May 11 to July 27, 2016. On June 4, CO2 leakage was simultaneously detected at 15 cm (8.8 %) and 60 cm (44.0 %) depths at 0 m from the well at Zone 3, and were increased up to about 30 % and 70 %, respectively. During the CO2 injection period, CO2 concentrations measured at 15 cm depth were significantly lower than those measured at 60 cm depth because of the atmospheric pressure effect. After stopping the CO2 injection, CO2 concentrations gradually decreased until July 27, but were still higher than the natural background concentration. This result suggested the possibility of long-term CO2 leakage. In addition, low levels of CO2 leakage were determined using CO2 regression analysis and CO2:O2 ratio. CO2 concentrations measured at 60 cm depth at 0 m from the well at Zones 1 to 4 consistently showed sigmoid increasing patterns with the injection time (R2=0.60-0.99). O2 concentrations at 15 cm and 60 cm depths from the CO2 release experiment were reached 0 % at about 76 % and 84 % of CO2 concentrations, respectively, whereas, those from biological reaction approached 0 % when CO2 increased to about 21 %. Therefore, deep underground monitoring would be able to detect CO2 leakage faster than near-surface monitoring, and CO2 regression and CO2:O2 ratio analyses seemed to be useful as clear indicators of CO2 leakage.\n\nTwo-Dimensional N,S-Codoped Carbon/Co 9 S 8 Catalysts Derived from Co(OH) 2 Nanosheets for Oxygen Reduction Reaction\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFu, Shaofang; Zhu, Chengzhou; Song, Junhua\n\nInvestigation of highly active and cost-efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction is of great importance in a wide range of clean energy devices, including fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, the simultaneous formation of Co9S8 and N,S-codoped carbon was achieved in a dual templates system. First, Co(OH)2 nanosheets and tetraethyl orthosilicate were utilized to direct the formation of two-dimensional carbon precursors, which were then dispersed into thiourea solution. After subsequent pyrolysis and templates removal, N/S-codoped porous carbon sheets confined Co9S8 catalysts (Co9S8/NSC) were obtained. Owing to the morphological and compositional advantages as well as the synergistic effects, the resultant Co9S8/NSCmoreÂ Â» catalysts with modified doping level and pyrolysis degree exhibit superior ORR catalytic activity and long-term stability compared with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. Remarkably, the as-prepared carbon composites also reveal exceptional tolerance of methanol, indicating their potential applications in fuel cells.Â«Â less\n\nSynthesis and Characterization of Cobalt Containing Nanoparticles on Alumina A Potential Catalyst for Gas to Liquid Fuels Production\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCowen, Jonathan; Hepp, Aloysius F.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFisher-TrÃ¶psch synthesis (FTS) is a century-old gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology that commonly employs cobalt (Co, on an oxide support) or iron (supported or not) species catalysts. It has been well established that the activity of the Co catalyst depends directly upon the number of surface Co atoms. The addition of promoter (mainly noble) metals has been widely utilized to increase the fraction of Co that is available for surface catalysis. Direct synthesis of Co nanoparticles is a possible alternative approach; our preliminary synthesis and characterization efforts are described. Materials were characterized by various transmission microscopies and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and dicobalt octacarbonyl were heated under argon to a temperature of 180 deg with constant stirring for 1 hr. Quenching the reaction in toluene produced Co-containing nanoparticles with a diameter of 5 to 10 nm. Alternatively, an alumina support (SBA-200 Al2O3) was added; the reaction was further stirred and the temperature was decreased to 140 deg to reduce the rate of further growth/ripening of the nucleated Co nanoparticles. A typical size of Co-containing NPs was also found to be in the range of 5 to 10 nm. This can be contrasted with a range of 50 to 200 nm for conventionally-produced Co-Al2O3 Fischer-TrÃ¶psch catalysts. This method shows great potential for production of highly dispersed catalysts that are either supported or unsupported.\n\nLanthanite-(Nd), Nd2(CO3)3Â·8H2O\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMorrison, Shaunna M.; Andrade, Marcelo B.; Wenz, Michelle D.; Domanik, Kenneth J.; Downs, Robert T.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nLanthanite-(Nd), ideally Nd2(CO3)3Â·8H2O [dineodymium(III) tricarbonate octaÂ­hydrate], is a member of the lanthanite mineral group characterized by the general formula REE 2(CO3)3Â·8H2O, where REE is a 10-coordinated rare earth element. Based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction of a natural sample from Mitsukoshi, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture, Japan, this study presents the first structure determination of lanthanite-(Nd). Its structure is very similar to that of other members of the lanthanite group. It is composed of infinite sheets made up of corner- and edge-sharing of two NdO10-polyhedra (both with site symmetry ..2) and two carbonate triangles (site symmetries ..2 and 1) parallel to the ab plane, and stacked perpendicular to c. These layers are linked to one another only through hydrogen bonding involving the water molÂ­ecules.

S.; Chew, T. L.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work, ZIF-8 membrane synthesized through solvent evaporation secondary seeded growth was tested for single gas permeation and binary gases separation of H2 and CO2. Subsequently, a modified mathematical modeling combining the effects of membrane and support layers was applied to represent the gas transport properties of ZIF-8 membrane. Results showed that, the membrane has exhibited H2/CO2 ideal selectivity of 5.83 and separation factor of 3.28 at 100 kPa and 303 K. Besides, the experimental results were fitted well with the simulated results by demonstrating means absolute error (MAE) values ranged from 1.13 % to 3.88 % for single gas permeation and 10.81 % to 21.22 % for binary gases separation. Based on the simulated data, most of the H2 and CO2 gas molecules have transported through the molecular pores of membrane layer, which was up to 70 %. Thus, the gas transport of the gases is mainly dominated by adsorption and diffusion across the membrane.\n\nNovel Co(III)/Co(II) mixed valence compound [Co(bapen)Br2]2[CoBr4] (bapen = N,Nâ§-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethane-1,2-diamine): Synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmolko, LukÃ¡Å¡; ÄernÃ¡k, Juraj; KuchÃ¡r, Juraj; MikloviÄ, Jozef; BoÄa, Roman\n\n2016-09-01\n\nGreen crystals of Co(III)/Co(II) mixed valence compound [Co(bapen)Br2]2[CoBr4] (bapen = N,Nâ§-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethane-1,2-diamine) were isolated from the aqueous system CoBr2 - bapen - HBr, crystallographically studied and characterized by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy.

Inorganic cobalt salts are quite toxic (cyanide and cobalt antagonise one another's toxicity) and complexes such as dicobalt edetate were studied with the aim of identifying compounds that were less acutely toxic, but which retained the antidotal properties of cobalt salts. The proprietary preparation, Kelocyanorâ¢, contains free cobalt and glucose as well as dicobalt edetate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the published evidence for the efficacy and adverse effects of dicobalt edetate. A Pubmed search was undertaken for the period 1961-September 2015. The search terms were \"dicobalt edetate\", \"cobalt edetate\" and \"Kelocyanor\", which produced 24 relevant citations. A review of the references in four relevant books (L'intoxication cyanhydrique et son traitement, Clinical and Experimental Toxicology of Cyanides, Antidotes for Poisoning by Cyanide and Antidotes) produced three further relevant papers, making a total of 27 papers. Efficacy of dicobalt edetate: There is evidence from animal pharmacodynamic studies that dicobalt edetate is an effective cyanide antidote in experimental animals. Some 39 cases of human poisoning treated with dicobalt edetate have been reported, but in only nine cases were blood cyanide concentrations measured, although administration of dicobalt edetate procured survival in four of the seven patients with concentrations in the lethal range (>3.0âmg/L). It is unlikely that death in any of the adequately documented fatal cases was attributable to treatment failure with dicobalt edetate, as it is probable that they all had suffered anoxic brain damage before treatment could be initiated. Furthermore, in one case, acute gold toxicity contributed substantially to death.

However, the thermodynamic process in which the CO 2 present in flue gas or a CO 2 -N 2 mixture is captured as hydrate has not been well understood. In this work, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the dependence of CO 2 capture efficiency on reservoir conditions. The CO 2 capture efficiency was investigated at different injection pressures from 2.6 to 23.8 MPa and hydrate reservoir temperatures from 273.2 to 283.2 K in the presence of two different saturations of methane hydrate. The results showed that more than 60% of the CO 2 in the flue gas was captured and stored as CO 2 hydrate or CO 2 -mixed hydrates, while methane-rich gas was produced. The efficiency of CO 2 capture depends on the reservoir conditions including temperature, pressure, and hydrate saturation. For a certain reservoir temperature, there is an optimum reservoir pressure at which the maximum amount of CO 2 can be captured from the injected flue gas or CO 2 -N 2 mixtures. This finding suggests that it is essential to control the injection pressure to enhance CO 2 capture efficiency by flue gas or CO 2 -N 2 mixtures injection.\n\nDynamics of soil CO 2 efflux under varying atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reveal dominance of slow processes\n\nTreesearch\n\nDohyoung Kim; Ram Oren; James S.

However, the creation of real 3D nano-objects is not trivial. Emerging non-conventional nanofabrication tools are required for this purpose. One attractive method is focused-electron-beam induced deposition (FEBID), a direct-write process of 3D nano-objects. Here, we grow 3D iron and cobalt nanopillars by FEBID using diiron nonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9, and dicobalt octacarbonyl Co2(CO)8, respectively, as starting materials. In addition, we systematically study the composition of these nanopillars at the sub-nanometer scale by atom probe tomography, explicitly mapping the homogeneity of the radial and longitudinal composition distributions. We show a way of fabricating high-purity 3D vertical nanostructures of â¼50 nm in diameter and a few micrometers in length. Our results suggest that the purity of such 3D nanoelements (above 90 at% Fe and above 95 at% Co) is directly linked to their growth regime, in which the selected deposition conditions are crucial for the final quality of the nanostructure. Moreover, we demonstrate that FEBID and the proposed characterization technique not only allow for growth and chemical analysis of single-element structures, but also offers a new way to directly study 3D core-shell architectures. This straightforward concept could establish a promising route to the design of 3D elements for future nano-electronic devices.\n\nEffect of pretreating of host oil on coprocessing\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHajdu, P.E.; Tierney, J.W.; Wender, I.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe principal objective of this research was to determine if coprocessing performance (i.e., coal conversion and oil yield) could be significantly improved by pretreating the heavy resid prior to reacting it with coal. For this purpose, two petroleum vacuum resids (1000{degrees}F+), one from the Amoco Co. and another from the Citgo Co., were used as such and after they had been pretreated by catalytic hydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions. The pretreatments were aimed at improving the host oil by; (1) converting any aromatic structures in the petroleum to hydroaromatic compounds capable of donating hydrogen, (2) cracking the heavy oil to lowermoreÂ Â» molecular weight material that might serve as a better solvent, (3) reducing the coking propensity of the heavy oil through the hydrogenation of polynuclear aromatic compounds, and (4) removing metals and heteroatoms that might poison a coprocessing catalyst. Highly dispersed catalysts, including fine particle Fe- and Mo-based, and dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 8}, were used in this study. The untreated and pretreated resids were extensively characterized in order to determine chemical changes brought about by the pretreatments. The modified heavy oils were then coprocessed with an Illinois No. 6 coal as well as with a Wyodak coal, and compared to coprocessing with untreated resids under the same hydroliquefaction conditions. The amount of oil derived from coal was estimated by measuring the level of phenolic oxygen (derived mainly from coal) present in the oil products. Results are presented and discussed.Â«Â less\n\nHigh-purity 3D nano-objects grown by focused-electron-beam induced deposition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCÃ³rdoba, Rosa; Sharma, Nidhi; KÃ¶lling, Sebastian; Koenraad, Paul M.; Koopmans, Bert\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo increase the efficiency of current electronics, a specific challenge for the next generation of memory, sensing and logic devices is to find suitable strategies to move from two- to three-dimensional (3D) architectures.

Here, we report a comparative study of substitution effects by Co and Mn for Fe sites in K0.8Fe2-ySe2 within the phase separation scenario. Our results demonstrate that Co and Mn dopants have distinct differences in occupancy and hence in the suppression mechanism of superconductivity upon doping of Fe sites. In K0.8Fe2-xCoxSe2, Co prefers to occupy the lattice of the superconducting phase and suppresses superconductivity very quickly, obeying the magnetic pair-breaking mechanism or the collapse of the Fermi surface nesting mechanism. In contrast, in K0.8Fe1.7-xMnxSe2, Mn shows no preferential occupancy in the superconducting phase or the 245 phase. The suppression of superconductivity can be attributed to restraining of the superconducting phase and meanwhile inducing another non-superconducting phase by Mn doping.\n\nA microporous MOF with a polar pore surface exhibiting excellent selective adsorption of CO2 from CO2-N2 and CO2-CH4 gas mixtures with high CO2 loading.\n\nPubMed\n\nPal, Arun; Chand, Santanu; Elahi, Syed Meheboob; Das, Madhab C\n\n2017-11-14\n\nA microporous MOF {[Zn(SDB)(L) 0.5 ]Â·S} n (IITKGP-5) with a polar pore surface has been constructed by the combination of a V-shaped -SO 2 functionalized organic linker (H 2 SDB = 4,4'-sulfonyldibenzoic acid) with an N-rich spacer (L = 2,5-bis(3-pyridyl)-3,4-diaza-2,4-hexadiene), forming a network with sql(2,6L1) topology. IITKGP-5 is characterized by TGA, PXRD and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The framework exhibits lozenge-shaped channels of an approximate size of 4.2 Ã 5.6 Ã 2 along the crystallographic b axis with a potential solvent accessible volume of 26%. The activated IITKGP-5a revealed a CO 2 uptake capacity of 56.4 and 49 cm 3 g -1 at 273 K/1 atm and 295 K/1 atm, respectively. On the contrary, it takes up a much smaller amount of CH 4 (17 cm 3 g -1 at 273 K and 13.6 cm 3 g -1 at 295 K) and N 2 (5.5 cm 3 g -1 at 273 K; 4 cm 3 g -1 at 295 K) under 1 atm pressure exhibiting its potential for a highly selective adsorption of CO 2 from flue gas as well as a landfill gas mixture. Based on the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 435.5 and a CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 151.6 have been realized at 273 K/100 kPa. The values at 295 K are 147.8 for CO 2 /N 2 and 23.8 for CO 2 /CH 4 gas mixtures under 100 kPa. In addition, this MOF nearly approaches the target values proposed for PSA and TSA processes for practical utility exhibiting its prospect for flue gas separation with a CO 2 loading capacity of 2.04 mmol g -1 .\n\nBehavior of CO2/water flow in porous media for CO2 geological storage.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Lanlan; Yu, Minghao; Liu, Yu; Yang, Mingjun; Zhang, Yi; Xue, Ziqiu; Suekane, Tetsuya; Song, Yongchen\n\n2017-04-01\n\nA clear understanding of two-phase fluid flow properties in porous media is of importance to CO 2 geological storage. The study visually measured the immiscible and miscible displacement of water by CO 2 using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and investigated the factor influencing the displacement process in porous media which were filled with quartz glass beads. For immiscible displacement at slow flow rates, the MR signal intensity of images increased because of CO 2 dissolution; before the dissolution phenomenon became inconspicuous at flow rate of 0.8mLmin -1 . For miscible displacement, the MR signal intensity decreased gradually independent of flow rates, because supercritical CO 2 and water became miscible in the beginning of CO 2 injection. CO 2 channeling or fingering phenomena were more obviously observed with lower permeable porous media. Capillary force decreases with increasing particle size, which would increase permeability and allow CO 2 and water to invade into small pore spaces more easily. The study also showed CO 2 flow patterns were dominated by dimensionless capillary number, changing from capillary finger to stable flow. The relative permeability curve was calculated using Brooks-Corey model, while the results showed the relative permeability of CO 2 slightly decreases with the increase of capillary number.

Membrane lungs are much more efficient at removing CO 2 than adding oxygen, but the range of CO 2 transfer is rarely reported. Commercial membrane lungs were studied with the goal of evaluating CO 2 removal capacity. CO 2 removal was measured in 4 commercial membrane lungs under standardized conditions. CO 2 clearance can be greater than 4 times that of oxygen at a given blood flow when the gas to blood flow ratio is elevated to 4:1 or 8:1. The CO 2 clearance was less dependent on surface area and configuration than oxygen transfer. Any ECMO system can be used for selective CO 2 removal.\n\nZeolites for CO2-CO-O2 Separation to Obtain CO2-Neutral Fuels.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerez-Carbajo, Julio; Matito-Martos, Ismael; Balestra, Salvador R G; Tsampas, Mihalis N; van de Sanden, Mauritius C M; Delgado, JosÃ© A; Ãgueda, V Ismael; Merkling, Patrick J; Calero, Sofia\n\n2018-06-20\n\nCarbon dioxide release has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and the depletion of carbon-based energy resources. Plasmolysis is a very energy-efficient process for reintroducing CO 2 into energy and chemical cycles by converting CO 2 into CO and O 2 utilizing renewable electricity. The bottleneck of the process is that CO remains mixed with O 2 and residual CO 2 . Therefore, efficient gas separation and recuperation are essential for obtaining pure CO, which, via water gas shift and Fischer-Tropsch reactions, can lead to the production of CO 2 -neutral fuels. The idea behind this work is to provide a separation mechanism based on zeolites to optimize the separation of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and oxygen under mild operational conditions. To achieve this goal, we performed a thorough screening of available zeolites based on topology and adsorptive properties using molecular simulation and ideal adsorption solution theory. FAU, BRE, and MTW are identified as suitable topologies for these separation processes. FAU can be used for the separation of carbon dioxide from carbon monoxide and oxygen and BRE or MTW for the separation of carbon monoxide from oxygen. These results are reinforced by pressure swing adsorption simulations at room temperature combining adsorption columns with pure silica FAU zeolite and zeolite BRE at a Si/Al ratio of 3. These zeolites have the added advantage of being commercially available.\n\nStudies of CW lasing action in CO2-CO, N2O-CO, CO2-H2O, and N2O-H2O mixtures pumped by blackbody radiation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbel, Robert W.; Christiansen, Walter H.; Li, Jian-Guo\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA proof of principle experiment to evaluate the efficacy of CO and H2O in increasing the power output for N2O and CO2 lasing mixtures has been conducted and theoretically analyzed for a blackbody radiation-pumped laser. The results for N2O-CO, CO2-CO, N2O-H2O and CO2-H2O mixtures are presented. Additions of CO to the N2O lasant increased power up to 28 percent for N2O laser mixtures, whereas additions of CO to the CO2 lasant, and the addition of H2O to both the CO2 and N2O lasants, resulted in decreased output power.\n\nReal-time breath gas analysis of CO and CO2 using an EC-QCL\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGhorbani, Ramin; Schmidt, Florian M.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nReal-time breath gas analysis is a promising, non-invasive tool in medical diagnostics, and well-suited to investigate the physiology of carbon monoxide (CO), a potential biomarker for oxidative stress and respiratory diseases. A sensor for precise, breath-cycle resolved, simultaneous detection of exhaled CO (eCO) and carbon dioxide (eCO2) was developed based on a continuous wave, external-cavity quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL), a low-volume multi-pass cell and wavelength modulation spectroscopy. The system achieves a noise-equivalent (1Ï) sensitivity of 8.5 Ã 10-8 cm-1 Hz-1/2 and (2Ï) detection limits of 9 Â± 2 ppbv and 650 Â± 7 ppmv at 0.14 s spectrum acquisition time for CO and CO2, respectively. Integration over 15 s yields a precision of 0.6 ppbv for CO. The fact that the eCO2 expirograms measured by capnography and laser spectroscopy have essentially identical shape confirms true real-time detection. It is found that the individual eCO exhalation profiles from healthy non-smokers have a slightly different shape than the eCO2 profiles and exhibit a clear dependence on exhalation flow rate and breath-holding time. Detection of indoor air CO and broadband breath profiling across the 93 cm-1 mode-hop-free tuning range of the EC-QCL are also demonstrated.\n\nAr + CO2 and He + CO2 Plasmas in ASTRAL\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoivin, R. F.; Gardner, A.; Munoz, J.; Kamar, O.; Loch, S.\n\n2007-11-01\n\nSpectroscopy study of the ASTRAL helicon plasma source running Ar + CO2 and He + CO2 gas mixes is presented. ASTRAL produces plasmas with the following parameters: ne = 10^10 - 10^13 cm-3, Te = 2 - 10 eV and Ti = 0.03 - 0.5 eV, B-field <= 1.3 kGauss, rf power <= 2 kWatt. A 0.33 m scanning monochromator is used for this study. Using Ar + CO2 gas mixes, very different plasmas are observed as the concentration of CO2 is changed. At low CO2 concentration, the bluish plasma is essentially atomic and argon transitions dominate the spectra. Weak C I and O I lines are present in the 750 - 1000 nm range. At higher CO2 concentration, the plasma becomes essentially molecular and is characterized by intense, white plasma columns. Here, spectra are filled with molecular bands (CO2, CO2^+, CO and CO^+). Limited molecular dissociative excitation processes associated with the production of C I and O I emission are also observed. On the other hand, He + CO2 plasmas are different. Here, rf matches are only possible at low CO2 concentration. Under these conditions, the spectra are characterized by strong C I and O I transitions with little or no molecular bands. Strong dissociative processes observed in these plasmas can be link to the high Te associated with He plasmas. An analysis of the spectra with possible scientific and industrial applications will be presented.\n\nStudies on the reactivity of [Ge9]4- towards [Fe(cot)(CO)3]: synthesis and characterization of [Ge8Fe(CO)3]3- and of the anionic organometallic species [Fe(cot)(CO)3]-.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Binbin; Goicoechea, Jose M\n\n2010-09-24\n\nReaction of cyclooctatetraene (COT) iron(II) tricarbonyl, [Fe(cot)(CO)(3)], with one equivalent of K(4)Ge(9) in ethylenediamine (en) yielded the cluster anion [Ge(8)Fe(CO)(3)](3-) which was crystallographically-characterized as a [K(2,2,2-crypt)](+) salt in [K(2,2,2-crypt)](3)[Ge(8)Fe(CO)(3)]. The chemically-reduced organometallic species [Fe(Î·(3)-C(8)H(8))(CO)(3)](-) was also isolated as a side-product from this reaction as [K(2,2,2-crypt)][Fe(Î·(3)-C(8)H(8))(CO)(3)]. Both species were further characterized by EPR and IR spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry. The [Ge(8)Fe(CO)(3)](3-) cluster anion represents an unprecedented functionalized germanium Zintl anion in which the nine-atom precursor cluster has lost a vertex, which has been replaced by a transition-metal moiety.\n\nInvestigations of the optical and EPR data and local structure for the trigonal tetrahedral Co2+ centers in LiGa5O8: Co2+ crystal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHe, Jian; Liao, Bi-Tao; Mei, Yang; Liu, Hong-Gang; Zheng, Wen-Chen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we calculate uniformly the optical and EPR data for Co2+ ion at the trigonal tetrahedral Ga3+ site in LiGa5O8 crystal from the complete diagonalization (of energy matrix) method founded on the two-spin-orbit-parameter model, where the contributions to the spectroscopic data from both the spin-orbit parameter of dn ion (in the classical crystal field theory) and that of ligand ions are contained. The calculated ten spectroscopic data (seven optical bands and three spin-Hamiltonian parameters g//, gâ¥ and D) with only four adjustable parameters are in good agreement with the available observed values. Compared with the host (GaO4)5- cluster, the great angular distortion and hence the great trigonal distortion of (CoO4)6- impurity center obtained from the calculations are referred to the large charge and size mismatch substitution. This explains reasonably the observed great g-anisotropy Îg (= g// - gâ¥) and zero-field splitting D for the (CoO4)6- cluster in LiGa5O8: Co2+ crystal.\n\nSeasonal and temporal CO2 dynamics in three tropical mangrove creeks - A revision of global mangrove CO2 emissions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosentreter, Judith A.; Maher, D. T.; Erler, D. V.; Murray, R.; Eyre, B. D.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nContinuous high-resolution surface water pCO2 and Î´13C-CO2 and 222Rn (dry season only) were measured over two tidal cycles in the wet and dry season in three tropical tidal mangrove creeks on the north-eastern coast of Queensland, Australia. Mangrove surface water pCO2 followed a clear tidal pattern (ranging from 387 to 13,031 Î¼atm) with higher pCO2-values in the wet season than in the dry season. The Î´13C-CO2 in the mangrove waters ranged from -21.7 to -8.8â° and was rather indicative of a mixed source than a distinct mangrove signature. Surface water CO2 was likely driven by a combination of mangrove and external carbon sources, e.g. exchange with groundwater/pore water enriched in 13C, or terrestrial carbon inputs with a significant contribution of C4-vegetation (sugar cane) source. The kinetic and equilibrium fractionation during the gas exchange at the water-atmosphere interface may have further caused a 13C-enrichment of the CO2 pool in the mangrove surface waters. Average CO2 evasion rates (58.7-277.6 mmol m-2 d-1) were calculated using different empirical gas transfer velocity models. Using our high-resolution time series data and previously published data, the average CO2 flux rate in mangrove ecosystems was estimated to be 56.5 Â± 8.9 mmol m-2 d-1, which corresponds to a revised global mangrove CO2 emission of 34.1 Â± 5.4 Tg C per year.\n\nExceptionally High Efficient Co-Co2P@N, P-Codoped Carbon Hybrid Catalyst for Visible Light-Driven CO2-to-CO Conversion.\n\nPubMed\n\nFu, Wen Gan\n\n2018-05-02\n\nArtificial photosynthesis has attracted wide attention, particularly the development of efficient solar light-driven methods to reduce CO2 to form energy-rich carbon-based products. Because CO2 reduction is an uphill process with a large energy barrier, suitable catalysts are necessary to achieve this transformation. In addition, CO2 adsorption on a catalyst and proton transfer to CO2 are two important factors for the conversion reactionï¼and catalysts with high surface area and more active sites are required to improve the efficiency of CO2 reduction. Here, we report a visible light-driven system for CO2-to-CO conversion that consists of a heterogeneous hybrid catalyst of Co and Co2P nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanolayers codoped with N and P (Co-Co2P@NPC) and a homogeneous Ru(II)-based complex photosensitizer. The average generation rate of CO of the system was up to 35,000 Î¼mol h-1 g-1 with selectivity of 79.1% in 3 h. Linear CO production at an exceptionally high rate of 63,000 Î¼mol h-1 g-1 was observed in the first hour of reaction. Inspired by this highly active catalyst, we also synthesized Co@NC and Co2P@NPC materials and explored their structure, morphology, and catalytic properties for CO2 photoreduction. The results showed that the nanoparticle size, partially adsorbed H2O molecules on the catalyst surface, and the hybrid nature of the systems influenced their photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.

In order to draw effective emission mitigation policies for combating future climate change as well as independently validating the emission inventories for constraining their large range of uncertainties, especially over major metropolitan areas of developing countries, there is an urgent need for greenhouse gas measurements over representative urban regions. India is a fast developing country, where fossil fuel emissions have increased dramatically in the last three decades and are predicted to continue to grow further by at least 6 % per year through to 2025. The CO2 measurements over urban regions in India are lacking. To overcome this limitation, simultaneous measurements of CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO) have been made at Ahmedabad, a major urban site in western India, using a state-of-the-art laser-based cavity ring down spectroscopy technique from November 2013 to May 2015. These measurements enable us to understand the diurnal and seasonal variations in atmospheric CO2 with respect to its sources (both anthropogenic and biospheric) and biospheric sinks. The observed annual average concentrations of CO2 and CO are 413.0 Â± 13.7 and 0.50 Â± 0.37 ppm respectively. Both CO2 and CO show strong seasonality with lower concentrations (400.3 Â± 6.8 and 0.19 Â± 0.13 ppm) during the south-west monsoon and higher concentrations (419.6 Â± 22.8 and 0.72 Â± 0.68 ppm) during the autumn (SON) season. Strong diurnal variations are also observed for both the species. The common factors for the diurnal cycles of CO2 and CO are vertical mixing and rush hour traffic, while the influence of biospheric fluxes is also seen in the CO2 diurnal cycle. Using CO and CO2 covariation, we differentiate the anthropogenic and biospheric components of CO2 and found significant contributions of biospheric respiration and anthropogenic emissions in the late night (00:00-05:00 h, IST\n\nRegenerable Sorbent for CO2 Removal\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAlptekin, Gokhan; Jayaraman, Ambal\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA durable, high-capacity regenerable sorbent can remove CO2 from the breathing loop under a Martian atmosphere. The system design allows near-ambient temperature operation, needs only a small temperature swing, and sorbent regeneration takes place at or above 8 torr, eliminating the potential for Martian atmosphere to leak into the regeneration bed and into the breathing loop. The physical adsorbent can be used in a metabolic, heat-driven TSA system to remove CO2 from the breathing loop of the astronaut and reject it to the Martian atmosphere. Two (or more) alternating sorbent beds continuously scrub and reject CO2 from the spacesuit ventilation loop. The sorbent beds are cycled, alternately absorbing CO2 from the vent loop and rejecting the adsorbed material into the environment at a high CO2 partial pressure (above 8 torr). The system does not need to run the adsorber at cryogenic temperatures, and uses a much smaller temperature swing. The sorbent removes CO2 via a weak chemical interaction. The interaction is strong enough to enable CO2 adsorption even at 3 to 7.6 torr. However, because the interaction between the surface adsorption sites and the CO2 is relatively weak, the heat input needed to regenerate the sorbent is much lower than that for chemical absorbents. The sorbent developed in this project could potentially find use in a large commercial market in the removal of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, if regulations are put in place to curb carbon emissions from power plants.\n\nRechargeable Al-CO2 Batteries for Reversible Utilization of CO2.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Wenqing; Liu, Xizheng; Li, Chao; Yin, Huiming; Xi, Wei; Liu, Ruirui; He, Guang; Zhao, Xian; Luo, Jun; Ding, Yi\n\n2018-05-21\n\nThe excessive emission of CO 2 and the energy crisis are two major issues facing humanity. Thus, the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and its utilization in metal-CO 2 batteries have attracted wide attention because the batteries can simultaneously accelerate CO 2 fixation/utilization and energy storage/release. Here, rechargeable Al-CO 2 batteries are proposed and realized, which use chemically stable Al as the anode. The batteries display small discharge/charge voltage gaps down to 0.091 V and high energy efficiencies up to 87.7%, indicating an efficient battery performance. Their chemical reaction mechanism to produce the performance is revealed to be 4Al + 9CO 2 â 2Al 2 (CO 3 ) 3 + 3C, by which CO 2 is reversibly utilized. These batteries are envisaged to effectively and safely serve as a potential CO 2 fixation/utilization strategy with stable Al. Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

All three oxides were pretreated at high temperatures (1173 K) in air, which leads to effective dehydroxylation of pure ZrO2. Both Y2O3 and YSZ-8 show a much higher reactivity toward CO and CO2 adsorption than ZrO2 because of more facile rehydroxylation of Y-containing phases. Several different carbonate species have been observed following CO2 adsorption on Y2O3 and YSZ-8, which are much more strongly bound on the former, due to formation of higher-coordinated polydentate carbonate species upon annealing. As the crucial factor governing the formation of carbonates, the presence of reactive (basic) surface hydroxyl groups on Y-centers was identified. Therefore, chemisorption of CO2 most likely includes insertion of the CO2 molecule into a reactive surface hydroxyl group and the subsequent formation of a bicarbonate species. Formate formation following CO adsorption has been observed on all three oxides but is less pronounced on ZrO2 due to effective dehydroxylation of the surface during high-temperature treatment. The latter generally causes suppression of the surface reactivity of ZrO2 samples regarding reactions involving CO or CO2 as reaction intermediates.

Co9S8 nanorod arrays were synthesized by a hydrothermal sulfuration treatment of acicular Co3O4 nanorod arrays, while the RuO2 was directly deposited on the Co3O4 nanorod arrays. Carbon cloth was selected as both the substrate and the current collector for its good conductivity, high flexibility, good physical strength, and lightweight architecture. Both aqueous KOH solutions and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/KOH were employed as electrolyte for electrochemical measurements. The as-fabricated ASCs can be cycled reversibly in the range of 0-1.6 V and exhibit superior electrochemical performance with an energy density of 1.21 mWh/cm(3) at a power density of 13.29 W/cm(3) in aqueous electrolyte and an energy density of 1.44 mWh/cm(3) at the power density of 0.89 W/cm(3) in solid-state electrolyte, which are almost 10-fold higher than those reported in early ASC work. Moreover, they present excellent cycling performance at multirate currents and large currents after thousands of cycles. The high-performance nanostructured ASCs have significant potential applications in portable electronics and electrical vehicles.\n\nHighly nitrogen-doped porous carbon derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 for CO2 capture.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Xiancheng; Li, Liqing; Chen, Ruofei; Wang, Chunhao; Li, Haoyang; Li, Hailong\n\n2018-05-18\n\nCO2 adsorption capacity of nitrogen-doped porous carbon depends to a large nitrogen doping levels and high surface area in previous studies. However, it seems difficult to incorporate large amounts of nitrogen while maintaining a high surface area and pore structure. Here we have reported porous carbon having a nitrogen content of up to 25.52% and specific surface area of 948 m2 g-1, which is prepared by pyrolyzing the nitrogen-containing zeolite imidazole framework-8 and urea composite at 650 Â°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. ZNC650 exhibits a superior CO2 uptake of 3.7 mmol g-1 at 25 â and 1 bar. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the nitrogen-containing functional groups can enhance CO2 uptake electrostatic interactions, Lewis acid-base interactions and hydrogen-bonding interactions, which are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. As CO2 adsorbent materials, these carbons have excellent adsorption capacity. Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Statistical analyses were performed to correlate microbiological measures and physico-chemical parameters. For the soil sampled in a zone with background CO2 content, incubation under an atmosphere with 20% of CO2, induce a sharp decrease of denitrifying activity after 6 months of incubation and only after 3 months with an atmosphere of 50% of CO2. On the contrary, concerning the soil sampled in a zone with 25.5% of CO2, incubation with an atmosphere of 50% has no effect on denitrifying activity and moreover this activity was stimulated with an atmosphere of 90% of CO2.Last, with the soil sampled in an area with 65.8% of CO2, denitrifying activity was negatively impacted from the 3th month of incubation with 90% CO2.and the activity was 2 fold lower after 12th of incubation. Concerning the nitrifying activity, soil sampled in an area with background CO2 content, this one remains little affected by increasing CO2 incubation. At initial times, soil sampled in the areas with 25.5 and 65.8 % of CO2 showed low level of nitrifying activities and further CO2 incubations have no effect on these activities. At the end, denitrifying activities seems to be more sensitive to CO2 concentrations evolution in the soil. More studies need to be done as incubation with lower CO2 content (< 10%) in order to determine the threshold of CO2 that can affect the near-surface bacterial activities and identify a possible candidate of CO2 leakage from deep reservoirs.\n\nThe Density and Compressibility of BaCO3-SrCO3-CaCO3-K2CO3-Na2CO3-Li2CO3 Liquids: New Measurements and a Systematic Trend with Cation Field Strength\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHurt, S. M.; Lange, R. A.; Ai, Y.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe volumetric properties of multi-component carbonate liquids are required to extend thermodynamic models that describe partial melting of the deep mantle (e.g. pMELTS; Ghiorso et al., 2003) to carbonate-bearing lithologies. Carbonate in the mantle is an important reservoir of carbon, which is released to the atmosphere as CO2 through volcanism, and thus contributes to the carbon cycle. Although MgCO3 is the most important carbonate component in the mantle, it is not possible to directly measure the 1-bar density and compressibility of MgCO3 liquid because, like other alkaline-earth carbonates, it decomposes at a temperature lower than its melting temperature. Despite this challenge, Liu and Lange (2003) and O'Leary et al. (2015) showed that the one bar molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility of the CaCO3 liquid component could be obtained by measuring the density and sound speeds of stable liquids in the CaCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary system at one bar. In this study, this same strategy is employed on SrCO3- and BaCO3-bearing alkali carbonate liquids. The density and sound speed of seven liquids in the SrCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary and three liquids in the BaCO3-Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 quaternary were measured from 739-1367K, with SrCO3 and BaCO3 concentrations ranging from 10-50 mol%. The density measurements were made using the double-bob Archimedean method and sound speeds were obtained with a frequency-sweep acoustic interferometer. The molar volume and sound speed measurements were used to calculate the isothermal compressibility of each liquid, and the results show the volumetric properties mix ideally with composition. The partial molar volume and compressibility of the SrCO3 and BaCO3 components are compared to those obtained for the CaCO3 component as a function of cation field strength. The results reveal a systematic trend that allows the partial molar volume and compressibility of the MgCO3 liquid component to be estimated.\n\nCO2 Permeability of Biological Membranes and Role of CO2 Channels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEndeward, Volker; Arias-Hidalgo, Mariela; Al-Samir, Samer; Gros, Gerolf\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe summarize here, mainly for mammalian systems, the present knowledge of (a) the membrane CO2 permeabilities in various tissues; (b) the physiological significance of the value of the CO2 permeability; (c) the mechanisms by which membrane CO2 permeability is modulated; (d) the role of the intracellular diffusivity of CO2 for the quantitative significance of cell membrane CO2 permeability; (e) the available evidence for the existence of CO2 channels in mammalian and artificial systems, with a brief view on CO2 channels in fishes and plants; and, (f) the possible significance of CO2 channels in mammalian systems.

In its liquid phase 1,8-DBO has been expected to exist in four most probable conformations, with all its carbon atoms in the same plane, having symmetries C 2h , C i , C 2 and C 1 . In the present study a detailed vibrational analysis in terms of assignment of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman bands of this molecule using normal co-ordinate calculations has been done. A systematic set of symmetry co-ordinates has been constructed for this molecule and normal co-ordinate analysis is carried out using the computer program MOLVIB. The force-field transferred from already studied lower chain bromo-alkanes is subjected to refinement so as to fit the observed infrared and Raman frequencies with those of calculated ones. The potential energy distribution (PED) has also been calculated for each mode of vibration of the molecule for the assumed conformations.\n\nMo2NiB2-type Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga compounds: Magnetic properties and giant low-temperature coercivity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorozkin, A.

Polycrystalline Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga undergo ferromagnetic transitions (TC) at 50 K and 62 K, respectively, and low-temperature field induced transitions (Tm) around 14 K and 16 K (in a field of 10 kOe), respectively. Between TC and Tm Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga are soft ferromagnets. Below Tm Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga exhibit permanent magnet properties with a residual magnetization per samarium of 0.38 Î¼B and 0.36 Î¼B, respectively, and a large coercive field of 69 kOe and 72 kOe, respectively, at 5 K. The magnetocaloric effects of Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga were calculated in terms of isothermal magnetic entropy change and they reach maximum values of -1.62 J/kg K and -1.31 J/kg K for a field change of 50 kOe at 50 K and 58 K, respectively. Low temperature magnetic ordering with enhanced anisotropy in Sm2Co2Al and Sm2Co2Ga is accompanied by a positive magnetocaloric effect with isothermal magnetic entropy changes of +1.63 J/kg K and +1.06 J/kg K for a field change of 50 kOe at 10 K and 8 K, respectively.

In order to increase its economic potential, pyrolysis gas is usually recycled to serve as carrier gas. In this study, biomass fast pyrolysis was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor using various main pyrolysis gas components, namely N(2), CO(2), CO, CH(4) and H(2), as carrier gases. The atmosphere effects on product yields and oil fraction compositions were investigated. Results show that CO atmosphere gave the lowest liquid yield (49.6%) compared to highest 58.7% obtained with CH(4). CO and H(2) atmospheres converted more oxygen into CO(2) and H(2)O, respectively. GC/MS analysis of the liquid products shows that CO and CO(2) atmospheres produced less methoxy-containing compounds and more monofunctional phenols. The higher heating value of the obtained bio-oil under N(2) atmosphere is only 17.8 MJ/kg, while that under CO and H(2) atmospheres increased to 23.7 and 24.4 MJ/kg, respectively.

O.; Brandis, A. M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThis work develops a chemical kinetic rate model for simulating nonequilibrium radiation from CO2-N2 gases, representative of Mars or Venus entry shock layers. Using recent EAST shock tube measurements of nonequilibrium CO 4th Positive and CN Violet emission at pressures and velocities ranging from 0.10 to 1.0 Torr and 6 to 8 km/s, the rate model is developed through an optimization procedure that minimizes the disagreement between the measured and simulated nonequilibrium radiance profiles. Only the dissociation rates of CO2, CO, and NO, along with the CN + O and CO + N rates were treated as unknown in this optimization procedure, as the nonequilibrium radiance was found to be most sensitive to them. The other rates were set to recent values from the literature. Increases in over a factor of 5 in the CO dissociation rate relative to the previous widely used value were found to provide the best agreement with measurements, while the CO2 rate was not changed. The developed model is found to capture the measured nonequilibrium radiance of CO 4th Positive and CN Violet within error bars of Â±30%.\n\nNitrogen and sulfur Co-doped microporous activated carbon macro-spheres for CO2 capture.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Yahui; Li, Kaixi; Zhao, Jianghong; Wang, Jianlong; Tang, Nan; Zhang, Dongdong; Guan, Taotao; Jin, Zuer\n\n2018-04-27\n\nMillimeter-sized nitrogen and sulfur co-doped microporous activated carbon spheres (NSCSs) were first synthesized from poly(styrene-vinylimidazole-divinylbenzene) resin spheres through concentrated H 2 SO 4 sulfonation, carbonization and KOH activation. Styrene (ST) and N-vinylimidazole (VIM) were carbon and nitrogen sources, while the sulfonic acid functional groups introduced by the simple concentrated sulfuric acid sulfonation worked simultaneously as cross-linking agent and sulfur source during the following thermal treatments. It was found that the surface chemistries, textural structures, and CO 2 adsorption performances of the NSCSs were significantly affected by the addition of VIM. The NSCS-4-700 sample with a molar ratio of ST: VIMâ¯=â¯1: 0.75 showed the best CO 2 uptake at different temperatures and pressures. An exhaustive adsorption evaluation indicated that CO 2 sorption at low pressures originated from the synergistic effect of surface chemistry and micropores below 8.04â¯Ã , while at the moderate pressure of 8.0â¯bar, CO 2 uptake was dominated by the volume of micropores. The thermodynamics suggested the exothermic and orderly nature of the adsorption process, which was dominated by a physisorption mechanism. The high CO 2 adsorption capacity, fast kinetic adsorption rate, and great regeneration stability of the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped activated carbon spheres indicated that the as-prepared carbon adsorbents were good candidates for large-scale CO 2 capture.

While intermolecular and intramolecular variants are widely known, transannular versions of this reaction are unknown and the basis of this study. Macrocyclic enyne and dienyne complexes were readily synthesized by palladium(II)-catalyzed oxidative macrocyclizations of bis(vinyl boronate esters) or ring-closing metathesis reactions followed by complexation with dicobalt octacarbonyl. Several reaction modalities of these macrocyclic complexes were uncovered. In addition to the first successful transannular Pauson-Khand reactions, other intermolecular and transannular cycloaddition reactions included intermolecular Pauson-Khand reactions, transannular [4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, intermolecular [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, and intermolecular [2 + 2 + 1 + 1] cycloaddition reactions.

The As atoms and four out of seven O atoms lie on special positions, all with site symmetry m. The Li atoms are disordered over two independent special (site symmetry -1) and general positions with occupancies of 0.54â (7) and 0.23â (4), respectively. The structure model is supported by bond-valence-sum (BVS) and charge-distribution (CHARDI) methods. The structure can be described as a three-dimensional framework constructed from bi-octahedral Co2O10 dimers edge-connected to As3O10 groups. It delimits two sets of tunnels, running parallel to the a and b axes, the latter being the larger. The Li+ ions are located within the interÂ­sections of the tunnels. The possible motion of the alkali cations has been investigated by means of the BVS model. This simulation shows that the Li+ motion appears to be easier mainly along the b-axis direction and that this material may possess interÂ­esting conduction properties.

Therefore the membranes were based on \"CO 2-philic\" polymers that exhibit thermodynamically favorable Lewis acid:Lewis base and hydrogen bonding interactions with CO 2. CO 2-philic polymers that are solid at ambient temperature include polyfluoroacrylate (PFA); polyvinyl acetate (PVAc); and amorphous polylactic acid (PLA). Literature CO 2 permeability values for PVAc and PLA are disappointingly low. The cast PFA membranes from this study had low permeabilities (45 barrers at 25Âº C) and verymoreÂ Â» low CO 2/H 2 selectivity of 1.4. CO 2-philic polymers that are liquid at ambient conditions include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), polybutylene glycol with a linear -((CH 2) 4O)-repeat unit (i.e., polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG)), polybutylene glycol (PBG) with a branched repeat unit, perfluoropolyether (PFPE), poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), and polyacetoxy oxetane (PAO). A small compound, glycerol triacetate (GTA) was also considered because it is similar in chemical structure to a trimer of PVAc. These liquids were tested as supported liquid membranes (SLM) and also (with the exception of PAD and GTA) as rubbery, crosslinked materials. Mixed gas permeability was measured using equimolar mixtures of CO 2 and H 2 feed streams at one atmosphere total pressure in steady-state flux experiments over the 298-423 K temperature range. The most promising SLMs were those composed of PEG, PTMEG, GTA, and PDMS. For example, at 37Âº C the PEG-, PTMEG-, GTA- and PDMS-based SLMs exhibited CO 2/H 2 selectivity values of ~11, 9, 9, and 3.5, respectively, and CO 2 permeability values of ~800, 900, 1900, and 2000 barrers, respectively. Crosslinked versions of the PEG, PTMEG and PDMS membranes at 37Âº C exhibited selectivity values of ~5, 6, and 3.5, respectively, and CO 2 permeability values of\n\nShape-Dependent Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO on Triangular Silver Nanoplates.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Subiao; Tao, Hongbiao; Zeng, Li; Liu, Qi; Xu, Zhenghe; Liu, Qingxia; Luo, Jing-Li\n\n2017-02-15\n\nElectrochemical reduction of CO 2 (CO 2 RR) provides great potential for intermittent renewable energy storage. This study demonstrates a predominant shape-dependent electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO on triangular silver nanoplates (Tri-Ag-NPs) in 0.1 M KHCO 3 . Compared with similarly sized Ag nanoparticles (SS-Ag-NPs) and bulk Ag, Tri-Ag-NPs exhibited an enhanced current density and significantly improved Faradaic efficiency (96.8%) and energy efficiency (61.7%), together with a considerable durability (7 days). Additionally, CO starts to be observed at an ultralow overpotential of 96 mV, further confirming the superiority of Tri-Ag-NPs as a catalyst for CO 2 RR toward CO formation. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and selectivity at lowered overpotential originate from the shape-controlled structure. This not only provides the optimum edge-to-corner ratio but also dominates at the facet of Ag(100) where it requires lower energy to initiate the rate-determining step. This study demonstrates a promising approach to tune electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of metal catalysts for CO 2 RR by creating optimal facet and edge site through shape-control synthesis.\n\nThe Field-Laboratory for CO2 Storage 'CO2SINK\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWÃ¼rdemann, Hilke; MÃ¶ller, Fabian; KÃ¼hn, Michael; Borm, GÃ¼nter; Schilling, Frank R.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe first European onshore geological CO2 storage project in a saline aquifer CO2SINK is designed as a field size experiment to better understand in situ storage processes and to test various monitoring techniques. This EU project is run by 18 partners from universities, research institutes and industry out of 9 European countries (www.co2sink.org). The CO2 is injected into Upper Triassic sandstones (Stuttgart Formation) of a double-anticline at a depth of 650 m. The Stuttgart Formation represents a flu vial environment comprised of sandstone channels and silty to muddy deposits. The anticline forms a classical multibarrier system: The first caprock is a playa type mudstone of the Weser and Arnstadt formations directly overlying the Stuttgart formation. Laboratory tests revealed permeabilities in a ÂµDarcy-range. The second main caprock is a tertiary clay, the so-called Rupelton. To determine the maximum injection pressure modified leak-off tests (without fracturing the caprock) were performed resulting in values around 120 bar. Due to safety standards the pressure threshold is set to 82 bar until more experience on the reservoir behaviour is available. The sealing property of the secondary cap rock is well known from decades of natural gas storage operations at the testing site and was the basis for the permission to operate the CO2 storage by the mining authority. Undisturbed, initial reservoir conditions are 35 Â°C and 62 bar. The initial reservoir fluid is highly saline with about 235 g/l total dissolved solids primarily composed of sodium chloride with notable amounts of calcium chloride. The initial pH value is 6.6. Hydraulic tests as well as laboratory tests revealed a permeability between 50 and 100 mDarcy for the sand channels of the storage formation. Within twenty months of storage operation, about 30,000 t of CO2 have been injected. Spreading of the CO2 plume is monitored by a broad range of geophysical techniques. The injection well and the two\n\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO over Zn in propylene carbonate/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Feng-xia; Shi, Jin; Chen, Tian-you; Shi, Feng; Li, Qing-yuan; Zhen, Jian-zheng; Li, Yun-fei; Dai, Yong-nian; Yang, Bin; Qu, Tao\n\n2018-02-01\n\nDeveloping low cost and high efficient electrode for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction in organic media is essential for practical application. Zn is a cheap metal and has high catalytic effects on CO2 reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) in aqueous solution. However, little attention has been given to investigate the performance of Zn in organic media for CO2 reduction. In present work, we have conducted CO2 reduction in propylene carbonate/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate on Zn due to that propylene carbonate is a widely used industrial absorber, and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate is a commonly used organic supporting electrolyte. In addition, because electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO naturally produces H2O, we have discussed water effects on CO2 reduction in propylene carbonate/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate+6.8 wt % H2O. Our experiment results reveal that the faradaic efficiency for CO formation reaches to 83%, and the current density remains stable at 6.72 mA/cm2 at voltage -2.3 V for 4 h. Interestingly, Zn presents higher catalytic activity than Ag, and slightly lower than Au. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirm that no poisonous species is formed and absorbed on the cathode, which is an important advantage in practical application.\n\nCO and CO2 dual-gas detection based on mid-infrared wideband absorption spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Ming; Zhong, Guo-qiang; Miao, Shu-zhuo; Zheng, Chuan-tao; Wang, Yi-ding\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA dual-gas sensor system is developed for CO and CO2 detection using a single broadband light source, pyroelectric detectors and time-division multiplexing (TDM) technique. A stepper motor based rotating system and a single-reflection spherical optical mirror are designed and adopted for realizing and enhancing dual-gas detection. Detailed measurements under static detection mode (without rotation) and dynamic mode (with rotation) are performed to study the performance of the sensor system for the two gas samples. The detection period is 7.9 s in one round of detection by scanning the two detectors. Based on an Allan deviation analysis, the 1Ï detection limits under static operation are 3.0 parts per million (ppm) in volume and 2.6 ppm for CO and CO2, respectively, and those under dynamic operation are 9.4 ppm and 10.8 ppm for CO and CO2, respectively. The reported sensor has potential applications in various fields requiring CO and CO2 detection such as in the coal mine.\n\nStructural and Kinetic Hydrogen Sorption Properties of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co Alloy Prepared by Ball Milling\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHe, Hui; Tang, Tao; Huang, Zhiyong; Sang, Ge; Zhang, Guanghui; Ba, Jingwen; Liu, Meng\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe effects of ball milling on the hydrogen sorption kinetics and microstructure of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co have been systematically studied. Kinetic measurements show that the hydrogenation rate and amount of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co decrease with increasing the ball milling time. However, the dehydrogenation rate accelerates as the ball milling time increases. Meanwhile, the disproportionation of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co speeds up after ball milling and the disproportionation kinetics is clearly inclined to be linear with time at 500Â°C. It is found from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) results that the lattice parameter of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co gradually decreases from 3.164âÃ to 3.153âÃ when the ball milling time extends from 0âh to 8âh, which is mainly responsible for the hydrogen absorption/desorption behaviors. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images demonstrate that the morphology of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co has obviously changed after ball milling, which is closely related to the hydrogen absorption kinetics. Besides, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images show that a large number of disordered microstructures including amorphous regions and defects exist after ball milling, which also play an important role in hydrogen sorption performances. This work will provide some insights into the principles of how to further improve the hydrogen sorption kinetics and disproportionation property of Zr0.8Ti0.2Co.

At 532 and 355 nm excitation, the dominant one-photon channel involved loss of a single CO ligand producing CpCoCO. The product angular distributions were isotropic, and a large fraction of excess energy appeared as product vibrational excitation. Production of CpCO + 2CO resulted from two-photon absorption processes. The two-photon dissociation of mixtures c"
