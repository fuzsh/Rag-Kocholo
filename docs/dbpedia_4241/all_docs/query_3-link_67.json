All the optical rotations in 2-phenylpropanal, obtained by the hydroformylation of styrene, were positive. In studies of asymmetric hydroformylation with homogeneous catalysts, no correlation was found between the optical inductions and ligand structure. Polymer-supported platinum catalysts having similar structure to their homogeneous counterparts showed the same high selectivity toward the formation of straight-chain aldehyde (89-95%) as the homogeneous catalysts in the hydroformylation of 1-hexene. Aldehyde yields were low (up to 45%); no reduction to alcohol occurred.},\n\ndoi = {},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6263123}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 EST 1977},\n\nmonth = {Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 EST 1977}\n\n}"
