It only requires updating with the help of new data that are constantly retrieved from Publisherâ€™s databases and other sources. This updating process takes 5-7 business days after order is placed. Thus, our clients always obtain a revised and updated version of each report. Please also note that we do not charge for such an updating procedure. BAC Reports has information for more than 25,000 different chemicals available but it is impossible to have all reports updated immediately. That is why it takes 5-7 days to update a report after an order is received."
