BINUCLEAR CARBONYL Mn2(CO)10, Dimanganese decacarbonyl: Preparation: • It can be prepared by carbonylation of manganese iodide with carbon monoxide using magnesium as a reducing agent 2MnI2+10CO + 2Mg diethyl ether Mn2 (CO)10 + 2MgI2 (25 C, 210 atm)  It can also be obtained by carbonylation of anhydrous manganese chloride with carbon monoxide in presence of sodium benzophenone ketyl. 2 MnCl2+ 10CO + 4(C6 H5)2CONa 165 C, 140 atm. Mn2(CO)10 + 4(C6 H 5)2 CO + 4 NaCl\n\n3. PROPERTIES • It forms stable golden yellow crystals having melting point of 155 C. • It is oxidized by trace amount of oxygen in solution. Hence, the solution must be stored in inert atmosphere. • Halogenation of dimanganese decacarbonyl proceeds with breaking of Mn-Mn bond and formation of carbonyl halides. Mn2 (CO)10 + X (X = Br, I) 2 Mn(CO)5 X • It reacts with sodium metal in liquid ammonia to give carbonylate anion Mn 2(CO)10 + 2 Na 2 Na [Mn(CO)5 ]\n\n4. STRUCTURE\n\n5. • Manganese pentacarbonyl does not exist as Mn (Z=25) has an odd atomic number. • The structure of dimanganese decacarbonyl consists of two manganese pentacarbonyl groups . • Two Mn joined through a Mn-Mn (2.79 Å) bond. The formation of this inter metallic bond effectively adds one electron to each of the manganese atoms. • Thus, manganese, an element with odd atomic number forms a binuclear carbonyl. Since the molecule does not have any unpaired electrons, it is diamagnetic.\n\n6. Fe2 (CO)9, Diiron nonacarbonyl: PREPARATION:\n\n7. PROPERTIES • Di iron nonacarbonyl forms golden yellow triclinic crystals melting at 100C • It is insoluble in water but soluble in toluene and pyridine. • A solution of diiron nonacarbonyl in toluene disproportionates when heated to 70C\n\n8. • Diiron nonacarbonyl reacts with sodium metal in liquid ammonia to give carbonylate anion.\n\n9. STRUCTURE\n\n10. STRUCTURE • Each of the iron atoms in diiron nonacarbonyl has three terminal carbonyl groups. • The remaining three carbon monoxide ligands act as µ2–CO groups. • There is a weak Fe-Fe bond (2.46 Å) formed by sharing of two unpaired electrons present in the 3d orbitals of iron atoms. • Thus, both the iron atoms in the molecule are identical with coordination number seven. • Since the molecule does not have any unpaired electron, it is diamagnetic. • d2sp3hybridization in Fe atoms\n\n11. Co2(CO)8, Dicobalt octacarbonyl PREPARATION • It can be prepared by direct combination of carbon monoxide with cobalt metal. • It can also be prepared by carbonylation of cobalt iodide/cobalt sulphide/cobalt carbonate using reducing agents like copper metal or hydrogen gas.\n\n12. PROPERTIES • It is an orange crystalline substance having melting point 51 C • Turns deep violet upon exposure to air. • It is soluble in alcohols, ether and carbon tetrachloride. • Upon heating at 50 C it forms tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl • It reacts with nitric oxide to form cobalt carbonyl nitrosyl.\n\n13. STRUCTURE\n\n14. BRIDGED STRUCTURE • Dicobalt octacarbonyl is known to exist in two isomeric forms. • A bridged structure of this molecule is observed in the solid state as well as solution state at a very low temperature. • A non -bridged structure predominates in a solution at temperatures above ambience. • In the bridged structure, the cobalt atoms are in d2sp3 hybrid state. • Three such hybrid orbitals on each cobalt atom accept lone pair of electrons from three carbon monoxide molecules to form total six Co.CO coordinate bonds. • A Co-Co bond is formed by the overlapping of two half filled- d2sp3 hybrid orbitals on the cobalt atoms. • Remaining two half–filled hybrid orbitals on each Co atom overlap with appropriate orbital on carbon atom of the carbonyl to form two bridging CO groups. • Thus, all electrons in this molecule are paired and it is diamagnetic.\n\n15. NON BRIDGED STRUCTURE • In the structure without bridge, the cobalt atoms are in dsp3hybrid state. • Out of the five hybrid orbitals on each cobalt atom, four orbitals on each cobalt atom accept a lone pair of electrons from the carbon monoxide molecules to form eight Co.CO coordinate bonds. • One half–filled orbitals on each cobalt overlap to form a Co-Co bond. • Co atoms have dsp3 hybridization"
