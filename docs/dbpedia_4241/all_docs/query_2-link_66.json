        "text": "Oxidative Addition Reactions\n\nLet us start with the oxidative addition. How is it defined? An oxidative addition is a reaction in which one or more ligands add to the metal center of a complex and oxidize it. This addition can occur in a cis- or trans-fashion. A cis-addition means that two ligands are added so that they have cis-orientation to each other after the reaction is complete. A trans-addition implies that two new ligands are in opposite, trans-position after they have been added. We can further distinguish between mononuclear and dinuclear additions. Mononuclear addition involves a complex with a single metal. Dinuclear additions are additions to a metal-metal bond. The addition cleaves the metal-metal bond and adds one ligand to each fragment.\n\nHere are a few of examples. The first example is a mononuclear cis-addition (Fig. \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\):). In the reaction we add dihydrogen to a square planar iridium complex. After the reaction there are two additional hydrido ligands, and the coordination number has increased from 4 to 6. We can see that the two hydrido ligands are oriented in cis-fashion relative to each other. We can verify that the addition of the hydrido ligands oxidized the metal by determining the oxidation number of the metal before and after the reaction. There are three neutral ligands and one negatively charged chloro ligand. There is no overall charge at the complex. This means that the oxidation number of Ir is +1. After the reaction, there are the two hydrido ligands that have both a -1 charge. Remember, we get the charge at a ligand by cleaving the metal-ligand bond so that all electrons in the bond get assigned to the ligand. This means the oxidation number must be increased by +2, and is +3 after the reaction.\n\nWe can rationalize why the addition occurs in cis-fashion and not in trans-fashion. The two hydrido ligands are the smallest ligands, therefore, steric repulsion is minimized in the complex is minimized when the two hydrido ligands are in cis-position.\n\nFig. \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\): Mononuclear oxidative trans-addition (Attribution: A. Vedernikov, U Maryland (modified))\n\nThe second example is a mononuclear trans-addition (Fig. \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\):). In this reaction CH3Br is added to the iridium complex. In this case the two new ligands, a CH3 and the Br group are in opposite position. Again, the coordination number increases from four to six. We can again verify that an oxidation has occurred by analyzing the oxidation number of Ir. As previously determined, the oxidation number of iridium in the reactant complex is +1. Let us analyze the product complex. The chloro ligand and the bromo ligand have a 1- charge. In addition to that also the CH3 ligand has a 1- charge assuming that we treat the Ir-C bond as a dative bond. Thus, the oxidation number of Ir must be +3 to give a neutral complex."
