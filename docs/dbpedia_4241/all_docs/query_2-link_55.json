        "text": "The equilibrium reaction of dicobalt octacarbonyl with dihydrogen is regarded as one of the key steps in the activation of hydrogen by cobalt carbonyls. This has been reconfirmed in recent years by important new observations regarding the versatile chemistry of the cobalt hydride complex. Although the nature of the molecule responsible for the splitting of the transiently formed RCO.Co(CO)3 in the hydroformylation reaction is still the subject of discussions, the essential importance of the cobalt tetracarbonyl hydride is evident and undisputed. This paper presents a critical review of the existing data on the equilibrium reaction of dicobalt octacarbonyl with dihydrogen, along with the results of new infrared spectroscopic measurements under semi in-situ conditions. The equilibrium constant, Kp=[HCo(CO)4]2/[Co2(CO)8]·pH2 (mol·l−1·bar−1), obtained from these latter measurements in hexane as solvent, depends on temperature in the 50.7–117.0°C range according to the equation log Kp=−(...\n\nThe reactions of metal carbonyl anions (M(CO)n−; M = Cr, Mn and Fe; n = 1–3) with n-heptane, water and methanol were studied with use of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer equipped with an external ion source. The M(CO)n− ions were formed in the FT-ICR cell by collision-induced dissociation of the most abundant primary ion generated by electron impact of the appropriate metal carbonyl compound present in the external ion source. The M(CO)n− ions were allowed subsequently to undergo non-reactive collisions with argon in order to remove possible excess internal/translational energy prior to the ion/molecule reaction. Only the Cr(CO)3−, Mn(CO)3− and Fe(CO)2− ions react with n-heptane. This reaction proceeds by loss of H2 from the collision complex and the Cr(CO)3− and Fe(CO)2− ions react about three times more efficiently than the Mn(CO)3− ion. With water, Mn(CO)− and Fe(CO)3− are unreactive, whereas the other ions react by loss of one or two CO molecules from the collision complex. The rate of the reaction with water decreases in the order Cr(CO)3−, Fe(CO)2−, Cr(CO)2−, Fe(CO)−, Mn(CO)3− and Mn(CO)2−. With methanol, the Cr(CO)2− ion reacts by loss of two CO molecules from the collision complex, whereas loss of one CO molecule and elimination of CO + H2 occur in the reaction with Cr(CO)3−. Competing loss of CO and one or two H2 molecules occurs in the reactions of Mn(CO)3− and Fe(CO)2− with methanol. The rate of the reaction with methanol decreases in the order Cr(CO)3−, Fe(CO)2−, Cr(CO)2− and Mn(CO)3−."
