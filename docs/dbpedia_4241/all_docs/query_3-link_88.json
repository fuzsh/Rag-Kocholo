Cobalt carbonyl is used as a hydroformylation catalyst. Generally, the temperature is 130 â, and the CO partial pressure is> 3MPa. There are many ways to synthesize cobalt carbonyl, but most of them require harsh conditions of high temperature and high pressure or use highly toxic reagents such as potassium cyanide (KCN) and sodium cyanide (NaCN). Application Cobalt carbonyl is an important compound, mainly used as a catalyst for the carbonylation reaction of organic compounds, such as the synthesis of phenylacetic acid and acetic acid catalyst. It is also an important reagent for the synthesis of other mononuclear and polynuclear carbonyl complexes. Use Solid-phase reaction complexing agent, catalyst, can be used for hydroformylation reaction, hydrogenation reaction, hydrosilylation reaction, isomerization reaction, carboxylation reaction, carbonylation reaction, and can also be used as a catalyst for olefin polymerization to replace titanium trichloride.
