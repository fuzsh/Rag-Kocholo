        "text": "i) Silyl ether tethers\n\nBoth vinyldimethylchlorosilane and vinyldiphenylchlorosilane are commercially available and were chosen as the initial starting materials for this part of the study. A range of silyl ethers were formed, which were then subjected to the 'standard' Pauson-Khand reaction conditions of dicobalt octacarbonyl and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide.\n\nAlthough the silyl ethers were formed in good yields, no Pauson-Khand adducts were obtained, only the cycloisomerisation products predicted by Saigo.[7] Repeating the reactions under 1 atm pressure of carbon monoxide also gave only the isomerisation products, albeit in higher yields and more rapidly. In every example, the main product, accounting for the bulk of the mass balance, were silanols derived from decomposed corresponding silyl ethers.\n\nThe P-K reaction is known to be affected by steric and electronic effects within the cyclisation precursors. Therefore we prepared the following dimethyl vinyl- and allyl-silyl ethers with various groups attached to the terminus of the alkyne ( ).[13–15] Once again, all the ethers were formed in good yields, but unfortunately either the silanol or starting materials were recovered in each case, as indicated, from the Pauson-Khand reaction.\n\nFearing that the lack of cyclisation may have been due to the two arms of the tether simply not coming together, substituents were introduced to the tether chains, in an attempt to produce a Thorpe-Ingold-type effect and force the two ends of the chain together ( ).\n\nThere now exist a plethora both of alternative metal carbonyls and promoters for the Pauson Khand reaction. Using each of the compounds 1–4, we first tested five alternative promoters to NMO. These were cyclohexylamine[16]; 1,4-dioxane/2M ammonium hydroxide[17]; trimethylamine N-oxide, 4 molecular sieves[18]; n-butylmethylsulfide[19] and microwave irradiation[20]. As previously, the dicobalt octacarbonyl complexes of each compound were first prepared and characterised, prior to addition of the promoter. Unfortunately, none of the promoters gave any of the desired products but simply de-complexed starting materials were recovered in each case.\n\nAlternative metal carbonyls were also investigated, with compounds 1–4 being reacted with each of molybdenum hexacarbonyl/DMSO[21]; tungsten pentacarbonyl/THF[22]; chromium hexacarbonyl and rhodium cycloooctadiene chloride dimer/pentafluorobenzaldehyde[23–24]. None of the promoters gave any Pauson-Khand adducts, although an interesting THF-insertion adduct was obtained from the reaction of allyldimethylpent-4-ynyloxysilane with tungsten pentacarbonyl, possibly formed via oxidation of THF to give an oxonium ion followed by addition of the alcohol cleaved from the silyl ether ( ).\n\nIn order to investigate if the presence of the silicon linker was preventing the Pauson-Khand reaction occurring, a test reaction between allyltrimethylsilane and 3-butyn-1-ol was performed using dicobalt octacarbonyl and NMO ( ). A mixture of cyclopentenone regioisomeric isomers were obtained, with the principal regioisomer being the one shown in .\n\nOne possible explanation for the failure of all these reactions was that the 'arms' of the silyl ethers were too far apart for cyclisation to occur. We had already attempted to overcome this potential hurdle by the introduction of functionality within the side chains. Work by Denmark[25] on tethered nitrone cycloadditions has shown that for cycloaddition reactions to occur, the non-reactive substituents around the silicon centre must be more bulky than the Me or Ph groups employed in these studies. Denmark's work demonstrated that the angles at the silicon centre between the two 'arms' of the silyl ether can be up to 180°. This large angle would mean that the 'arms' would never be close enough together to undergo cycloaddition. Therefore the angle must be decreased and this can be accomplished by increasing the size of the non-reactive substituents as stated by the Thorpe-Ingold effect. Denmark stated that the substituents on silicon should either be two isopropyl or two tert-butyl groups in order to achieve reaction. Ditertbutyl silanes were found to be impractical because vinyl- or allylditertbutyl chlorosilanes will not undergo nucleophilic substitution to yield the silyl ethers due to the large steric crowding, preventing the formation of the penta coordinate intermediates. However, diisopropylsilanes were successful in Denmark's studies.\n\nThe preparation of diisopropyl silyl ethers presented a greater synthetic challenge than the previous silyl ethers. Starting from diisopropyldichlorosilane, a two-step, one-pot procedure was developed, initially adding the allyl arm via the allyl Grignard reagent, followed by a more standard silyl ether formation using an acetylenic alcohol and imidazole (without isolating the intermediate silyl chloride). (Isolation of the intermediate diisopropylallylsilyl chloride was impossible, since any attempt to work-up the Grignard reaction resulted in hydrolysis of the silyl chloride to the allyldiisopropylsilanol).\n\nThe cyclisation of these two materials was then performed using the standard Pauson-Khand reactions that had previously been successful in our model studies – dicobalt octacarbonyl and NMO.\n\nUnder these conditions, a very pleasing 75% yield was obtained for the fused 6,5-ring system (n = 1). This is the first example of a diisopropylsilyl ether-tethered Pauson-Khand reaction successfully taking place. See Supporting Information File 1 for full experimental details. Unfortunately, no reaction product was obtained for the 5,7-ring system (n = 2), although this is not quite so surprising, given the general difficulty in forming 5,7-bicyclic systems.[26]\n\nEfforts to prepare further, more substituted allyldiisopropyl silyl ethers by this two-step, one-pot procedure failed to give cyclisation precursors in any appreciable yield and not sufficient for use in the Pauson-Khand reaction. The previous method had shown that the Grignard addition to a dichlorosilane had worked well but that the work-up had hydrolysed the remaining silyl chloride bond. Therefore replacing the second chlorine atom with a group that could not be hydrolysed would allow the work-up and isolation of the products after the Grignard addition had taken place. Due to the restricted number of chlorodiisopropylsilanes available meant that this group had to be a proton. Therefore it was decided to start this new methodology from chlorodiisopropylsilane.\n\nThe synthesis of allyldiisopropylsilane proceeded easily and with high yield. Next a variety of methods were attempted for the conversion of the silicon-hydrogen bond to a silicon-chloride bond: chlorine in carbon tetrachloride; copper (II) chloride and Hunig's base; tin (IV) chloride[27] and N-bromosuccimide[28] were all tested but none were successful as either no reaction occurred or the alkene was halogenated as well as the conversion of the silane to the silyl chloride. Further, given that the major product from many of the methods attempted both for the formation of the silyl ethers and from the Pauson-Khand reaction were the corresponding silanols, we wondered if it would be possible to use these compounds for the preparation of our desired ethers via a Mitsunobu reaction. There are examples in the chemical literature in which silanols may be used analogously to alcohols in the Mitsunobu reaction.[29] Unfortunately, neither triisopropylsilanol (synthesised by the hydrolysis of commercially available triisopropylsilyl chloride) or diisopropyl(1-methylallyl)-silanol and but-2-enyldiisopropylsilanol gave any product and quantitative starting materials were recovered ( ).\n\nFollowing the failure of the different methods of forming the silyl ethers it was decided to find a procedure for the direct conversion of the easily synthesised allyldiisopropylsilane to the silyl ethers. The first reaction used a neat mixture of the silane and alcohol with the addition of a catalytic amount of Wilkinson's catalyst.[30] A test reaction using this procedure was carried out to couple allyldiisopropylsilane and propargyl alcohol, but the formation of the silyl ether did not occur and the starting materials were recovered in quantitative amounts.\n\nThe second method involved dissolving the silane and alcohol in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) followed by the addition of a catalytic amount of a 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF.[31] This proved to be successful and a number of different alcohols were tried and the results, together with those from the Pauson-Khand reaction are shown in .\n\nTable 1\n\nAlcoholSilyl EtherYield (%)Pauson-Khand AdductYield (%)1.41752.44-03.51464.49315.44346.0--7.0--8.17Traces9.-0\n\nThe application of the TBAF catalyst to the formation of silyl ethers showed mixed results. Entries 1–5 proceeded with moderate to good yields. These yields were much better than those obtained from the one-pot synthesis starting from dichlorodiisopropylsilane described previously. These successful reactions used the simple hydroxyl containing alkynes; when these alkynes had more functionalised substituents (entries 6 and 7) the reaction failed. In the case of entry 7 the only compound recovered from the reaction was the allyldiisopropylsilanols. However in the case of the TMS derivatised alkyne, the major product was the de-silylated silyl ether consistent with entry 1. The reaction proved to be very unreliable and the purity of the substrates had to be very high. Impurities, especially water, were thought to interfere with the mechanism of catalysis.\n\nThe successfully prepared silyl ethers ( , entries 1–5, 8) were then used as substrates for the P-K cyclisation. The standard conditions, used previously, of one equivalent of dicobalt octacarbonyl and ten equivalents of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) were employed. In all cases except for the longer chain (entry 2) the P-K adduct was obtained in poor to moderate yield. Only traces of product (by GCMS) were observed for entry 8, presumably due to very small scale reaction owing to the poor yield of starting material. The cyclised silyl ether tethered cyclopentenone was again synthesised proving the reaction could be repeated and was not an anomaly. The results for the other silanes did not show the product of the reaction as cyclopentenones. The only identifiable product isolated from any of the other reactions was the silanol associated with hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen bond. It was impossible to improve on these reaction yields, despite varying the amount of NMO (1, 5 or 10 eq.) and reaction temperature (r.t., 40°C or 80°C).\n\nFinally, it was decided to swap the alkene and alkyne substituents on the silyl ethers around. In order to achieve the formation of these new silyl ethers an alternative methodology had to be applied to both the formation of the silanes and the subsequent formation of the silyl ethers.\n\nSimple deprotonation of the alkyne with n-butyllithium and reaction with chlorodiisopropylsilane led to the formation of the desired silanes in good yields.\n\nThe formation of the silyl ethers was attempted using the TBAF catalyst procedure that had proven to be successful previously but neither compound gave the desired silyl ethers. GCMS data suggested that the TBAF catalyst had attacked the bond between the TMS group and the alkyne in the case of silane (5) and in the case of silane (6) the reaction had simply not worked, although no clear results were obtained by NMR. It has been shown that a ruthenium catalyst can cause the direct formation of silyl ethers from the silane and an alcohol. The procedure was successful for hex-1-ynyldiisopropylsilane.\n\nThe reaction proceeded with low yields but the un-reacted silane was recovered intact at the end of the reaction. The yields for the reactions were significantly below the near quantitative yields reported in the literature but these reactions were never optimised. These two silyl ethers were subjected to the standard P-K reaction conditions. Analysis of the reaction solution showed that cyclisation had not occurred and the only compound recovered was a quantitative amount of the starting material.\n\nii) Silyl acetal tethers\n\nAlthough silyl ethers have been the predominant ether of choice, silyl acetals have been applied as temporary tethers in reactions.[32] Silyl acetals have, for example, been applied to any reactions to which silyl ether have been applied, such as radical, Diels Alder reaction or ring closing metathesis, albeit with varying degrees of success. The advantage of silyl acetals over silyl ethers is their greater stability to hydrolysis. The results obtained from the research into silyl ethers suggested that if, as we believe, hydrolysis was the major problem, this potentially could be overcome using silyl acetals.\n\nFirst, we attempted to form the required mixed silyl acetal from propargyl and allyl alcohols using diphenyldichlorosilane and imidazole as the base and allowing the reaction to proceed to equilibrium, hopefully allowing for the optimum yield of the mixed acetal.\n\nThe result shows that the desired mixed acetal is the major product of the reaction as expected. However, given the similarity in the three products, purification of the acetals by column chromatography proved to be particularly difficult and complete purification could not be achieved (yields given are of pure products obtained; the remaining mass of the reaction could not be completely purified and remained as two mixtures of the acetals).\n\nThe cyclisation of the purified mixed acetal was attempted using the standard reactions conditions which had been employed for the successful silyl ether cyclisation reactions ( ).\n\nThe cyclisation failed to yield any of the bicyclic cyclopentenone predicted. This result is consistent with the literature evidence and our previous results that the 5,7 systems are known not to be synthesised through the cobalt mediated methodology. The unsymmetrical acetal was recovered in near quantitative yield with no trace of any products of decomposition or hydrolysis. Therefore silyl acetal did not undergo hydrolysis thus proving that the silyl acetal is more stable to the P-K reaction conditions than the silyl ethers.\n\nIn order to try to achieve cyclisation, the length of each 'arm' of the silyl acetal was increased by 1 carbon unit. It was hoped that the increase in chain lengths would allow the larger ring system (5,9) to be synthesised. This was accomplished by employing 3-butyn-1-ol and 3-buten-1-ol in place of propargyl and allyl alcohol respectively. The same experimental procedure was used and the three acetals were formed in roughly the same ratio as the previous attempt. Unfortunately, on this occasion, purification by chromatography was completely unable to isolate any of the pure mixed acetal. It was found that the increased chain length had decreased the differences in polarity to such a degree that separation by chromatography was impossible. Purification by distillation proved to be similarly impossible.\n\nFollowing the work of Denmark and our moderate success in the silyl ether series, it was decided to attempt to use diisopropylsilanes as the base for the acetals. Secondly it was decided to find a methodology that allowed for the formation of only the mixed acetal. In order to achieve this it was thought to form each of the 'arms' of the acetal in separate synthetic steps ( ).\n\nThe first stage of the reaction was silyl ether formation. The alkyne 'arm' of the acetal was introduced first, as it was feared that during the next, halogenation step, halogenation of the alkene might occur, if present. This proved to be a successful approach and it was not necessary to purify the first reaction, but simply continue to perform the silyl acetal. The first reaction was attempted using 2-butyn-1-ol and allyl alcohol ( ).\n\nThe result demonstrates that the synthesis of the mixed acetal is successful. However the symmetrical di-alkyne acetal is also formed. This is due to the formation first of the silyl acetal 'arm' not going to completion. Thus after bromination there is still some 2-butyn-1-ol remaining in solution and this reacts with the bromosilane. The low yields could be improved by optimizing the reaction conditions and finding a better way to add the second arm to the acetal, such as a catalytic method, avoiding the need for the bromosilane intermediate. This reaction was repeated using 3-butyn-1-ol to yield the isomeric, terminal alkyne product. However only the symmetrical, di-alkyne acetal was isolated from the reaction mixture and the yield was poor (14%). The poor yield was again due to the bromosilane hydrolysing under the reaction conditions.\n\nThe final methodology for synthesising the silyl acetals hoped to combine the silyl ether formation utilised in the NBS procedure with the TBAF methodology which had been so successful for the silyl ethers ( ).\n\nThe formation of the alkene 'arm' of the acetal proceeded well using the methodology outlined above. The TBAF catalysed addition of the alkyne 'arm' however did not occur and after the reaction time neither the acetal product or silyl ether intermediate could be isolated. NMR and GCMS studies showed that the TBAF reaction had caused decomposition of the silyl ether intermediate but the decomposition products could not be isolated or identified.\n\nThe successfully synthesised silyl acetal was subjected to the P-K reaction conditions. Again the cyclisation was not successful and all that was recovered from the reaction was the un-reacted starting material. Following the difficulties with the synthesis of the silyl acetals and the failure of the silyl acetals to undergo cyclisation it was decided to stop the research into these temporary tethers."
