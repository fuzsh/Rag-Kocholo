        "text": "Computing molar mass (molar weight)\n\nTo calculate molar mass of a chemical compound enter its formula and click 'Compute'. In chemical formula you may use:\n\nAny chemical element. Capitalize the first letter in chemical symbol and use lower case for the remaining letters: Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, O, H, C, N, Na, K, Cl, Al.\n\nFunctional groups: D, Ph, Me, Et, Bu, AcAc, For, Tos, Bz, TMS, tBu, Bzl, Bn, Dmg\n\nparenthesis () or brackets [].\n\nCommon compound names.\n\nExamples of molar mass computations: NaCl, Ca(OH)2, K4[Fe(CN)6], CuSO4*5H2O, nitric acid, potassium permanganate, ethanol, fructose, caffeine, water.\n\nMolar mass calculator also displays common compound name, Hill formula, elemental composition, mass percent composition, atomic percent compositions and allows to convert from weight to number of moles and vice versa.\n\nComputing molecular weight (molecular mass)\n\nTo calculate molecular weight of a chemical compound enter it's formula, specify its isotope mass number after each element in square brackets.\n\nExamples of molecular weight computations: C[14]O[16]2, S[34]O[16]2.\n\nDefinitions\n\nMolecular mass (molecular weight) is the mass of one molecule of a substance and is expressed in the unified atomic mass units (u). (1 u is equal to 1/12 the mass of one atom of carbon-12)\n\nMolar mass (molar weight) is the mass of one mole of a substance and is expressed in g/mol.\n\nMole is a standard scientific unit for measuring large quantities of very small entities such as atoms and molecules. One mole contains exactly 6.022 ×1023 particles (Avogadro's number)\n\nSteps to calculate molar mass\n\nIdentify the compound: write down the chemical formula of the compound. For example, water is H2O, meaning it contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n\nFind atomic masses: look up the atomic masses of each element present in the compound. The atomic mass is usually found on the periodic table and is given in atomic mass units (amu).\n\nCalculate molar mass of each element: multiply the atomic mass of each element by the number of atoms of that element in the compound.\n\nAdd them together: add the results from step 3 to get the total molar mass of the compound.\n\nExample: calculating molar mass\n\nLet's calculate the molar mass of carbon dioxide (CO2):\n\nCarbon (C) has an atomic mass of about 12.01 amu.\n\nOxygen (O) has an atomic mass of about 16.00 amu.\n\nCO2 has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.\n\nThe molar mass of carbon dioxide is 12.01 + (2 × 16.00) = 44.01 g/mol.\n\nLesson on computing molar mass\n\nWeights of atoms and isotopes are from NIST article.\n\nRelated: Molecular weights of amino acids"
