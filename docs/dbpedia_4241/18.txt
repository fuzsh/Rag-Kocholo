Dicobalt octacarbonyl is an organocobalt compound with composition Co2(CO)8. This metal carbonyl is used as a reagent and catalyst in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis, and is central to much known organocobalt chemistry.[2][3] It is the parent member of a family of hydroformylation catalysts.[4] Each molecule consists of two cobalt atoms bound to eight carbon monoxide ligands, although multiple structural isomers are known.[5] Some of the carbonyl ligands are labile.
