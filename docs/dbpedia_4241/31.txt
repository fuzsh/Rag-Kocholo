Dicobalt octacarbonyl is the inorganic compound Co2(CO)8. This metal carbonyl is a reagent and catalyst in organometallic chemistry and organic synthesis.[1] It is used as a catalyst for hydroformylation, the conversion of alkenes to aldehydes.[2]

Synthesis, structure, properties

The high pressure carbonylation of cobalt(II) salts, often in the presence of cyanide, affords this compound. It is an orange-colored, pyrophoric solid that is thermally unstable. It exists as two isomers in solution:[3]

The predominant isomer resembles Fe2(CO)9, less one bridging CO. The Co-Co distance is 2.52 Å, and the Co-COterminal and Co-CObridge distances are 1.80 and 1.90 Å, respectively.[4] These isomers rapidly interconvert. The minor isomer has no bridging CO ligands; it is described (CO)4Co-Co(CO)4 (D3d symmetry group). The major isomer contains two bridging CO ligand and features octahedral cobalt, describable as (CO)3Co(μ-CO)2Co(CO)3 (C2v symmetry group). The minor isomer has been crystallized together with C60.[5]

Reactions

The most characteristic reaction of Co2(CO)8 is its hydrogenation to tetracarbonylhydrocobalt, [HCo(CO)4]:

Co2(CO)8 + H2 → 2 HCo(CO)4

This hydride is the active agent in hydroformylation. It adds to alkenes to give an alkyl-Co(CO)4 product that then proceeds to insert CO and undergo hydrogenolysis to afford the aldehyde. Reduction of Co2(CO)8 gives the conjugate base of HCo(CO)4:

Co2(CO)8 + 2 Na → 2 NaCo(CO)4

The CO ligands can be replaced with tertiary phosphine ligands to give Co2(CO)8-x(PR3)x. These bulky derivatives are more selective catalysts for hydroformylation reactions. "Hard" Lewis bases, e.g. pyridine, cause disproportionation:

6 C6H5N + 1.5 Co2(CO)8 → [Co(C6H5N)6][Co(CO)4]2 + 4 CO

Co2(CO)8 catalyzes the Pauson–Khand reaction of an alkyne, an alkene, and CO to give cyclopentenones.

Heating causes decarbonylation and formation of the tetrahedral cluster:

2 Co2(CO)8 → Co4(CO)12 + 4 CO

Safety

Co2(CO)8 a volatile source of cobalt(0), is pyrophoric and releases carbon monoxide upon decomposition.[6]
