Synthesis and structure

The high pressure reaction of cobalt(II) salts with CO, often in the presence of cyanide, affords this compound. It is an orange-colored, pyrophoric material. It is one of the more structurally complex of the binary metal carbonyls because it exists as isomers:[3]

The predominant isomer resembles Fe2(CO)9, less one bridging CO. The Co-Co distance is 2.52 Å and the Co-COterminal and Co-CObridge distances are 1.80 and 1.90 Å, respectively.[4] These isomers rapidly interconvert. The minor isomer has no bridging CO ligands, it is described (CO)4Co-Co(CO)4 (D3d symmetry group). The major isomer contains two bridging CO ligand and features octahedral cobalt, describable as (CO)3Co(μ-CO)2Co(CO)3 (C2v symmetry group).

Reactions

The characteristic reaction of this species entails its hydrogenation:

Co2(CO)8 + H2 → 2 HCo(CO)4

This hydride is the active agent in hydroformylation. It adds to alkenes to give an alkylCo(CO)4 product that then proceeds to insert CO and undergo hydrogenolysis to affort the aldehyde.

Reduction of Co2(CO)8 gives the conjugate base of HCo(CO)4:

Co2(CO)8 + 2 Na → 2 NaCo(CO)4

The CO ligands can be replaced with tertiaryphosphine ligands to give Co2(CO)8-x(PR3)x. These bulky derivatives are more selective catalysts for hydroformylation reactions.

Co2(CO)8 catalyzes the Pauson–Khand reaction of an alkyne, an alkene, and CO to give a cyclopentenone.

Lewis bases cause disproportionation:

6 pyridine + 1.5 Co2(CO)8 → [Co(pyridine)6][Co(CO)4]2 + 4 CO

Heating causes decarbonylation and formation of the tetrahedral cluster Co4(CO)12.

Safety

Co2(CO)8 is a volatile source of cobalt; it releases carbon monoxide upon decomposition. This is one of the more reactive binary metal carbonyls, and some samples will contain pyrophoric particles of cobalt that can inflame in air. Samples are refrigerated during storage.
