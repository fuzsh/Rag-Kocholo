Visit Our Philosophy Page, where youâll find the best philosophy colleges and universities, career information, interviews with top philosophers, influential scholars in the field of philosophy, great books, a history of the discipline, online philosophy degrees, and more.\n\nPhilosophy has classically been celebrated as the highest form of study, in which great minds set aside the trappings of the world and focus on the most fundamental (lofty) questions of existence. However, that is a pretty outdated model. Sure, philosophy still delves into the depths of the nature of reality and the human mind, but through the years it has been far from a fanciful pursuit of wisdom. Philosophers live in the moment, digging into questions that impact our daily lives, whether it be through the ethics of data mining in the age of social media, the legitimacy of political movements and entire governmental systems, the increasing porousness of borders between artificial and organic intelligence, or the complex and ongoing effects of imperialism on both the colonizers and the colonized.\n\nPhilosophy is not bound between the great columns of the forum of Athens, or the walls of the so-called ivory towers of the worldâs major universities. It mingles with and affects so many aspects of our everyday lives, influencing the laws that you live under, the technology that you use, and even the entertainment that you consume.\n\nThe following 25 people have made a lot of noise in the philosophy world over the past 10 years. Through professorship, writing and publication, editing journals and anthologies, activism, and public discourse they have all played roles in directing the current course of philosophy. All are currently employed as professors, all are influential, and some are quite controversial.\n\nNote: This isnât simply a list of the most famous philosophers alive today. Here we are focused on the number of citations and web presence of scholars in the last 10 years. There are other highly influential scholars who simply havenât been cited and talked about as much in the last 10 years, whereas some new faces have been making a splash in the news, speaking events, and publishing, publishing, publishing. Our machine learning is time sensitive. To find some of the big names you might have expected to see here, we encourage you to use our dynamic ranking system and check different influencers over the time.\n\nTop Influential Philosophers 2010-2020\n\nWant more?

Sally Haslanger\n\nAreas of Specialization: Analytic Philosophy, Feminist Philosophy, Critical Theory, Metaphysics\n\nSally Haslanger, currently appointed the Ford Professor of Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), completed her undergraduate education at Reed College in 1977, and earned her PhD in philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985. Currently the most influential person in philosophy, Haslanger has previously held appointments in the Ivy league, at Princeton University and at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHaslangerâs work and influence are broad. Starting her career in the areas of analytic metaphysics and epistemology, Haslanger has since built on ancient philosophy foundations to create notable work in the realms of social and political philosophy. Haslanger is perhaps best known for her work in feminist theory and critical race theory, applying ancient and metaphysical principles (such as Aristotleâs hylomorphic theory) to these relatively modern areas of inquiry, especially in regards to the notion of social construction. On that topic, Haslanger has been a formidable voice, publishing groundbreaking pieces investigating and analyzing social categories that are traditionally seen as universal and unquestionable. Haslangerâs work is perhaps best represented in the book Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique, which collects two decades of her papers, covering and connecting topics including epistemology, metaphysics, and social and gender issues.\n\nFor her work, Haslanger has been named the 2010 Distinguished Woman Philosopher by the Society for Women in Philosophy, was the president of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, and was the recipient of a 2018 Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\n2. Daniel Dennett\n\nAreas of Specialization: Philosophy of Mind, Cognitive Science\n\nCurrently appointed as the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University (and co-director of the Center for Cognitive Studies) Daniel Dennett is a philosopher concerned with questions of the mind and cognitive science, and is colloquially known as one of the âFour Horsemen of New Atheism.â As an undergraduate, Dennett studied at Wesleyan University and Harvard University before earning his PhD in philosophy at University of Oxford in 1965.\n\nWhether discussing consciousness, perception, or free will, the philosophy of mind is central to Dennettâs work. In particular, Dennett is known for calling for empirical explanations for processes of the mind, proposing models of thought and perception that are similar to mechanical calculation. Thought, perception, and all other mental activity occur with parallel processes in the brain, like a computer calculating input data. Dennettâs philosophy extends to debates about evolution, morality, and religion as well, arguing for evolution as a kind of algorithmic process, which produces outcomes including morality; religion too can be seen as resulting from a kind of naturalistic process.\n\nAmong numerous awards and honors, Dennett has received two Guggenheim fellowships and a Fulbright fellowship.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Daniel Dennett:\n\nBrainstorms\n\nConsciousness Explained\n\nDarwinâs Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life\n\n3.Linda Martin Alcoff\n\nAreas of Specialization: Epistemology, Feminism, Race Theory, Existentialism\n\nPanama-born Linda Martin Alcoff is currently appointed as a professor of philosophy at Hunter College of the City University of New York. Alcoff earned her bachelorâs degree in philosophy in 1980 at Georgia State University, as well as her MA in 1983, and in 1987 earned her PhD in philosophy at Brown University. In her career, Alcoff has also held positions at Kalamazoo College, Syracuse University, Cornell University, and Brown University, among others.\n\nAlcoff is best known for her intersectional approach to issues of race, gender, identity, and epistemology. Alcoff identifies location as a major component in both self-identity and how we identify and relate to others. In particular, Alcoff is known for an essay titled âThe Problem of Speaking for Others,â in which she analyzed the discourse we use to speak of other people, finding rhetorical (and epistemic) tendencies for domination and mastery. Accordingly, Alcoff has been a vocal advocate of greater recognition and inclusion of marginalized and underrepresented groups in philosophy, allowing these groups to fully and accurately represent and speak for themselves.\n\nFor her work, Linda Martin Alcoff has received awards and honors such as an honorary doctorate from the University of Oslo, the Frantz Fanon Prize from the Caribbean Philosophical Association, and recognition as a Distinguished Woman in Philosophy from the Society for Women in Philosophy.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\nMajor published works by Linda Martin Alcoff:\n\nRape and Resistance\n\nThe Future of Whiteness\n\nVisible Identities: Race, Gender, and the Self (Studies in Feminist\n\n4. Martha Nussbaum\n\nAreas of Specialization: Analytic Philosophy, Ethics, Political Philosophy, Feminism\n\nCurrently, Martha Nussbaum holds the position of Ernst Freund Distinguished Service Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago. Too influential to be confined to one department, Nussbaum is appointed to the faculty of both the philosophy department and the law school. As an undergraduate, Nussbaum spent two years at Wellesley College, before deciding to pursue theatre studies at New York University. After, Nussbaum completed her graduate studies and PhD at Harvard University.\n\nWith roots in ancient philosophy and classics, Nussbaum is a significantly influential voice of feminism and liberalism. Her work draws on Aristotelianism and ancient Greek tragedy to investigate contemporary feminist theory and issues. Nussbaum also investigates the philosophy of emotion, often finding overlap between these realms, such as tying justice and ethics to questions about human flourishing. In her books Hiding from Humanity and From Disgust to Humanity, Nussbaum examined the role of shame and disgust in legal judgements and law, arguing that these notions cannot be the basis of truly just law. Similarly, in Sex and Social Justice, Nussbaum provided a feminist critique of liberalism, building on the notion of objectification, to show how sex and gender can be and is used as a tool of oppression, particularly of marginalized groups.\n\nFor her work, Nussbaum has received many awards and honors, including over 60 honorary degrees from universities including Emory University and The College of William and Mary, as well as awards including the Barnard College Medal of Distinction, the American Philosophical Societyâs Henry M. Phillips Prize in Jurisprudence, and the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Martha Nussbaum:\n\nSex and Social Justice\n\nHiding from Humanity\n\nFrom Disgust to Humanity\n\n5. David Chalmers\n\nAreas of Specialization: Philosophy of Mind, Consciousness\n\nDavid Chalmers serves currently as Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Centre for Consciousness at the Australian National University, as well as University Professor, Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science, and co-Director of the Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness (with philosopher Ned Block) at New York University. One of the worldâs most influential philosophers on the problem of consciousness, Chalmers has a degree in pure mathematics from the University of Adelaide in Australia, and received his Ph.D. in philosophy and cognitive science from Indiana University Bloomington, where he studied with noted AI researchers and cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter.\n\nChalmers is best known for his insistence in the philosophy of mind that âthe problem of consciousnessâ cannot be easily dismissed. Calling the subjective feel of conscious experience âthe hard problem,â Chalmers has argued, famously, that purely scientific treatments of consciousness must grapple with the hard problemâand to date, we do not have a plausible scientific explanation of consciousness. The term âthe hard problemâ of consciousness has embedded itself in the lexicon in both philosophy and more broadly, in discussions about consciousness and the mind, due to Chalmers. Chalmers also works on issues in analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language, such as with problems of reference.\n\nIn 2013, Chalmers was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is an editor for the respected Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. In 2018, he became a judge for the Berggruen Prize, a $1 Million prize for outstanding work in philosophy.\n\nChalmers is author of the widely read The Conscious Mind published in 1996.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by David Chalmers:\n\nThe Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory\n\nConstructing the World\n\nThe Character of Consciousness\n\n6. Jennifer Saul\n\nAreas of Specialization: Philosophy of Language, Philosophy of Feminism\n\nJennifer Saul is currently Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield and the University of Waterloo in the UK, specializing in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of feminism. Saul received her bachelorâs degree from the University of Rochester and her masterâs degree and Ph.D. from Princeton University.\n\nJennifer Saul has had a large influence in two areas of philosophy, not immediately or obviously connected: analytic philosophy (especially of language), and the philosophy of feminism. Analytic philosophy is a more formal treatment of philosophy involving analyzing language and communication in terms of logic and theory. The philosophy of feminism is of course focused on theoretical issues concerning women and the treatment of women in society. Saul explores both areas, to good effect. And her topics in philosophy are sometimes surprising; her 2012 book titled Lying, Misleading, and What is Said: An Exploration in Philosophy of Language and in Ethics examines the difference between overt lying and misleading, and has been called an example of âapplied philosophy of language.â Interestingly, she has also explored issues in pornography, objectification, and the history of the vibrator.\n\nSaul won the Distinguished Woman Philosopher award in Washington, D.C. by the Society for Women in Philosophy in 2011. She is a co-founder and co-blogger for the popular blog Feminist Philosophers.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Jennifer Saul:\n\nLying, Misleading, and What is Said: An Exploration in Philosophy of Language and in Ethics\n\nSubstitution, Simple Sentences and Intuitions\n\nFeminism: Issues & Arguments\n\n7. Noam Chomsky\n\nAreas of Specialization: Linguistics, Analytic Philosophy, Political Philosophy\n\nNoam Chomsky currently holds joint appointments at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as Institute Professor Emeritus, and the University of Arizona as Laureate Professor. Chomsky completed his university studies between the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.\n\nThe influence of Chomksy in both linguistics and political discourse cannot be overstated; regardless of what aspect of his work you are discussing, his name always perks a few ears. Depending on who is describing him, Chomsky is either one of the most important linguists in modern times, one of the most important political thinkers, or (most often) both. Chomsky began his career squarely in academia as a professor of linguistics at MIT. Most of Chomskyâs earliest books focus on biolinguistics (language as a biologically rooted phenomenon in humans), with titles such as Syntactic Structures (1957), Current Issues in Linguistic Theory (1964), and Language and Mind (1968). In these texts, Chomksy advanced his notion of âuniversal grammar.â\n\nChomskyâs role in modern linguistic philosophy is enough to make him well known and influential in academia. However, Chomsky is perhaps better known to the general public as a major political thinker and dissident. Chomskyâs involvement in the political discourse of the US began with participation in protests of the Vietnam War in the early 1960s. Since then, he has published numerous books and given countless talks on subjects such as American Imperialism and US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and media and propaganda.\n\nFor his work, Chomsky has received many awards and honors, including honorary doctorates from the University of London and the University of Chicago, a Guggenheim fellowship, and the Sydney Peace Prize.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\nMajor published works by Noam Chomsky:\n\nDeterring Democracy\n\nLanguage and Mind\n\nSyntactic Structures\n\n8.JÃ¼rgen Habermas\n\nAreas of Specialization: Social Theory, Pragmaticism\n\nJÃ¼rgen Habermas is a German philosopher mostly associated with the influential Frankurt School in Germany, part of the Institute for Social Research, at Goethe University Frankfurt, and historically an important center for research on social theory and critical philosophy. Habermas, now 90, earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Bonn in 1954. Habermas is a famed philosopher who has taught a number of influential philosophers, including Hans Joas at the University of Chicago.\n\nHabermas is known for his work on communicative rationality, a position that places emphasis on rationality developing out of interpersonal communication, rather than objective structures in the universe, as with traditional rationalism in philosophy. Significantly, Habermasâs theory attempts to advance the aims of human emancipation in terms of a universalism in morals. Habermas has drawn on diverse philosophical positions and schools, from the older German philosophical thought of legends like Kant to 19th century American schools such as pragmatism. Importantly, Habermas breaks with schools of thought like postmodernism, with his hope that Enlightenment rationality and science can be salvaged and developed within contemporary frameworks.\n\nHabermas has won numerous awards throughout his long and distinguished career, including the Hegel Prize, the Sigmund Freud Prize, and the Theodor W. Adorno Award. He won the Karl Jaspers Prize in 1995, and the Viktor Frankl Award in 2011.\n\nMajor published works by JÃ¼rgen Habermas:\n\nBetween Naturalism and Religion: Philosophical Essays\n\nEurope: The Faltering Project\n\nThe Crisis of the European Union: A Response\n\n9.Robert Bernasconi\n\nAreas of Specialization: Ontology, Political Philosophy, Racism\n\nRobert Bernasconi is the Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Philosophy and African American Studies at Pennsylvania State University. He earned a B.A. in Philosophy from the School of English and American Studies and a D.Phil at University of Sussex. His areas of specialization include critical philosophy of race, social and political philosophy, ethics, and nineteenth and twentieth century continental philosophy.\n\nMost recently, Bernasconi has taught courses on Medieval Ethics, Critical Philosophy of Race, Sartre, Fanon, Levinas, and Modern Political Philosophy and Slavery. He is a prolific writer who writes at least one piece for each of his areas of interest each year. His most recent published works include âA Most Dangerous Error: The Boasian Myth of a Knock-Down Argument against Racismâ, âThe Other Does not Respond: Levinasâs Response to Blanchotâ, and âSubjectivity Must Be Defended: Substitution, Entanglement, and the Prehistory of the Me in Levinasâ.\n\nBernasconi is perhaps best well-known for his work on critical philosophy of race, and as a reader of Martin Heidegger and Emmanuel Levinas, whose works are widely represented in Bernasconiâs catalog. He is also editor of three journals, titled, Critical Philosophy of Race, Levinas Studies, and Ecoethica.\n\nBernasconi has a cocktail named after him. The âBernasconiâ is made up of equal parts of citron vodka, Cointreau, Campari, a double part of fresh grapefruit juice, finished with prosecco and an orange slice.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Robert Bernasconi:\n\nThe Idea of Race\n\nRace and Racism in Continental Philosophy\n\nHow to Read Sartre\n\n10.George Yancy\n\nAreas of Specialization: Critical Theory of Race, African American Philosophy, Philosophy of the Body\n\nGeorge Dewey Yancy is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy at Emory University. He earned a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh, an M.A. in philosophy from Yale University, an M.A. in Africana Studies, and a Ph.D. from Duquesne University. He is a distinguished Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College, a University of Pennsylvania Inaugural Provostâs Distinguished Visiting Faculty Fellow, and the founding editor of the Philosophy of Race book series.\n\nHe is best known for his scholarly work in critical whiteness studies, critical phenomenology, critical philosophy of race, and African American philosophy. He is a prolific writer with more than 150 published works, including Our Black Sons Matter: Mothers Talk About Fears, Sorrows, and Hopes and On Race: 34 Conversations in a Time of Crisis. He most recently published Across Black Spaces: Essays and Interviews from an American Philosopher, which was published in 2020. In 2017, Our Black Sons Matter was recognized by Booklist as a Top 10 Diverse Nonfiction book.\n\nHe has also appeared in two documentaries, Lillian Smith: Breaking the Silence, an independent documentary, and Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story, a mini-series aired on Paramount.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\nMajor published works by George Yancy:\n\nLook, A White!: Philosophical Essays on Whiteness\n\nBacklash: What Happens When We Talk Honestly about Racism in America\n\nChristology and Whiteness: What Would Jesus Do?\n\n11.Joseph Raz\n\nAreas of Specialization: Legal and Political Philosophy, Perfectionist Liberalism\n\nJoseph Raz is Columbia Law Schoolâs Thomas M. Macioce Professor of Law Emeritus and a leading expert in moral, legal, and political philosophical thought. He earned a D. Phil from University of Oxford and a Magister Juris from Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2018, Raz was awarded the Tang Prize in Rule of Law for his trailblazing work in legal philosophy. He is well known for his lectures, the most notable of which are the Minerva lecture on Human Rights, given at Tel Aviv University in 2006, as well as the Plenary Lecture at the World Congress of the International Association for the Philosophy or Law and Social Philosophy in Beijing in 2009.

Charles Taylor\n\nAreas of Specialization: Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Social Science\n\nCharles Taylor is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at McGill University, Canada. He is known best for his contributions to political philosophy, the philosophy of social science, and the philosophy of history and intellectual history. Taylor received a bachelorâs degree in History from McGill in 1953. As a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, Taylor took a first-class bachelorâs degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics and a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) from Oxford in 1961. Notably, his supervisor was Isaiah Berlin, the renowned British social and political theorist.\n\nTaylor is considered part of the tradition of Canadian idealism, which itself traces back to British idealism as in the works of George Berkeley. He holds to the view that we cannot make sense of the world by representations and rules; following German philosopher Wittgenstein he believes that our ability follow rules and understand concepts takes place against a background of âtacitâ or non-symbolic understanding, grounded in our experience of life. Taylor is also known for his rejection of naturalism, the philosophical position that the natural sciences should ground all of our knowledge. In place of naturalistic theories, Taylor offers hermeneutics, the view that we gain knowledge by interpreting meanings in communication acts rather than by a scientific and rational foundation. Taylor is also skeptical of secularism, at least as it has been used to argue for the shrinking of religious ideas in society.\n\nTaylorâs work spans decades and his is truly an influential and respected philosopher. In addition to his Rhodes Scholarship at the outset of his studies at Oxford, Taylor has also won the Kyoto Prize, the Templeton Prize, the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy, and the John W. Kluge Prize.\n\nMajor published works by Charles Taylor:\n\nThe Explanation of Behaviour\n\nA Secular Age\n\nThe Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity\n\n13.Brian Leiter\n\nAreas of Specialization: Philosophy of Law, Nietzsche, Continental Philosophy\n\nBrian Leiter is the Karl N.

Alain Badiou\n\nAreas of Specialization: Set Theory, Philosophy of Mathematics, Metapolitics, Ontology, Psychoanalysis\n\nAlain Badiou is formerly chair of Philosophy at the Ãcole normale supÃ©rieure (ENS), and is a founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the Paris 8 University Vincennes-Saint-Denis along with French philosophy luminaries Michel Foucault and Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard. Badiou though associated with postmodern thinkers like Foucault maintains that his thought and work cannot be described adequately by postmodernism, though it is not also purely modern. He is a prominent advocate of a return to communism as a form of government.\n\nBadiou received his diploma from the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, essentially a masterâs degree in Philosophy, on the topic of modern philosopher Spinoza. He then taught at the LycÃ©e Louis-Le-Grand, where he met playwright and philosopher FranÃ§ois Regnault. The two became politically active, and in fact Badiou was later a founding member of the Unified Socialist Party. Badioâs philosophical work has focused on diverse subjects, including logic and set theory (a topic in mathematical logic) as well as topics considered part of Continental philosophy, like political theory and even psychoanalysis. In spite of his insistence that he should not be classified as a postmodernist, he is considered influential in that area of French philosophy.\n\nBadiou served as Honorary President at The Global Center for Advanced Studies in 2014-15, an educational and research organization with locations in New York City and Dublin.\n\nProfessional Website\n\nMajor published works by Alain Badiou:\n\nLe concept de modÃ¨le\n\nDe la fin: Conversations with Giovanbattista Tusa\n\nLâimmanence des vÃ©ritÃ©s\n\nSometimes, We Are Eternal with Kenneth Reinhard, Jana Ndiaye Berankova, Nick Nesbitt\n\n15. Mpho Tshivhase\n\nAreas of Specialization: Applied Ethics, Philosophy of Psychology\n\nMpho Tshivhase is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Preoria, South Africa. She studied psychology as an undergraduate at the University of Johannesburg, and later received her masterâs and Ph.D. in Philosophy at Johannesburg. Her dissertation, âTowards a Normative Theory of Uniqueness of Personsâ drew from her earlier work on personal identity. In 2018, Tshivhase became the first black female to receive a Ph.D. in Philosophy in South Africa, and was celebrated in media publications like the Independent Online, a popular online news site in South Africa. In 2020, Tshivhase was awarded with the CEOâs Award by the South African company Institute of People Management (IPM). IPM is the human resource management mother-body of South Africa and beginning in 2017, has granted the annual CEO Award to an individual who has made a significant contribution in a field, profession, or in society that makes a difference and shatters perceptions.\n\nTshivhaseâs work focuses on the idea of personal uniqueness, in particular whether pursuing a unique identity in a personâs development is worth pursuing in and of itself, and perhaps at the expense of the pursuit of other qualities. In addition, she explores the general concept of uniqueness as applied to personal identity and how people relate to the concept â what it means for them.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n16.A.C.

Patricia Churchland\n\nAreas of Specialization: Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Science\n\nPatricia Churchland is UC Presidentâs Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). She is also an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Churchland has made important contributions to the philosophy of mind and philosophical topics in neurobiology. She received her undergraduate education from the University of British Columbia, Canada. She received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where she earned her masterâs degree. She received a B.Phil. at the University of Oxford in 1969.\n\nPatricia Churchlandâs research has been an interdisciplinary effort in both philosophy proper and the sciences, particularly neuroscience and neurobiology. She is known for a philosophical position allied to scientific research known as âeliminative materialism,â where âfolkâ concepts like consciousness, free will, and other aspects of what we think of as the mind will eventually be eliminate in favor of purely scientific accounts of the brain. Thus she views philosophy itself as a discipline that is changing (or should change)âa kind of âproto scienceâ at its best, where questions are raised in terms of our knowledge of the brain rather than historical conundrums.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\nMajor published works by Patricia Churchland:\n\nNeurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain\n\nConscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition\n\nThe Computational Brain\n\n19. Thomas Nagel\n\nAreas of Specialization: Political Philosophy, Ethics, Philosophy of Mind, Epistemology\n\nCurrently holding the title of University Professor of Philosophy and Law, Emeritus at New York University, Thomas Nagel previously held positions at the University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University, among others. Nagel earned a BA in philosophy from Cornell University in 1958, a BPhil in 1960 at the University of Oxford (as a Fulbright scholar, and studying under JL Austin, no less), and his PhD from Harvard University in 1963.\n\nThough primarily working in political philosophy and ethics throughout his career, Nagel achieved quite a bit of (ongoing) fame and notoriety in the realm of philosophy of mind and epistemology with his 1974 essay âWhat is it like to be a Bat?â In the famed essay, Nagel investigated the phenomenal experience of being a bat and argued that consciousness has an innately subjective character that, at least under our current understanding of science and the physical world, cannot be explained satisfactorily from physical causes alone. The resulting debate from this essay still rages on. Beyond this, in political philosophy and ethics, Nagel has argued for a Kantian and rationalist approach to morality and law.\n\nFor his work, Nagel has received honors including fellowship with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Science Foundation Fellowship, and the Rolf Schock Prize.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Thomas Nagel:\n\nOther Minds: Critical Essays, 1969â1994\n\nThe Myth of Ownership: Taxes and Justice\n\nThe Possibility of Altruism\n\n20. Anita L. Allen\n\nAreas of Specialization: Legal Philosophy, Ethics, Feminism, Race Theory\n\nAnita L. Allen current holds the titles of the Henry R. Silverman Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and is Vice Provost of Faculty.

Outside of the University of Pennsylvania, Allen has also taught at places including Georgetown University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Tel Aviv University. Allen received her BA from the New College of Florida, and her MA and PhD in philosophy from the University of Michigan.\n\nAllen is often cited as an international expert on issues of law and ethics, especially in regards to privacy, as well as womenâs rights and diversity in higher education. Much of Allenâs work investigates the intersection between privacy, ethics, and society, and what these things mean in an increasingly advanced age in which the nature and role of privacy in our everyday lives and decisions is constantly shifting. These concerns extended to bioethics as well; in fact, in 2010 Allen was selected by President Barack Obama for the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.\n\nFor her work, Allen has received numerous honors, awards, and appointments, including election to the National Academy of Medicine, the American Law Institute, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Anita L.

Judith Butler\n\nAreas of Specialization: Feminism, Ethics, Political Philosophy, Gender Theory\n\nJudith Butler is the Maxine Ellio Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley. Butler earned a bachelor of arts in philosophy at Yale University in 1978, and her PhD at Yale in 1984. In addition to UC Berkeley, Butler has taught at Wesleyan University, George Washington University, Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and the University of Amsterdam.\n\nDrawing on critical traditions including phenomenology, feminism, cultural criticism, and philosophy of language, much of Butlerâs work focuses on issues of gender. At the core of her work is the argument that gender is performative, an idea heavily influenced by Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Simone de Beauvoir. In this approach, Butler differentiates between sex as a biological designation, and gender as the product of culture and action. Consequently, however much a person identifies with or resists their declared gender is a matter of performativity in regards to established norms and expectations. From this, Butler argues gender is real in that we perform it and make it real, which also makes it fluid, and capable to change through our performative choices.\n\nFor her work, Butler has received numerous awards and honors, including honorary doctorates from McGill University and the University of Belgrade, the Theodor W. Adorno Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nMajor published works by Judith Butler:\n\nBodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex\n\nGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\n\nUndoing Gender\n\n24.Simon Critchley\n\nAreas of Specialization: Political Philosophy, Ethics, Aesthetics\n\nSimon Critchley is the Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy at The New School for Social Research, a board member for the Onassis Foundation, and a professor of philosophy at the European Graduate School.
