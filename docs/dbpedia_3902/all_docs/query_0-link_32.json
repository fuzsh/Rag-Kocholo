        "text": "In my previous post on Whitehead Leon made an acute observation, saying:\n\nBrandom is definitely overlooked. His sort of Hegelianism is the “least offensive” to those who are all out materialists – but what interests me the most is the cross-over between that sort of Hegelian idealism/realism, and contemporary “speculative idealism.” It is the latter that Brassier’s current thinking seems to be nearing: through Hegel, through Plato, through naturalism, through pragmatism, through Sellars, and so on (and I should emphasize that the Plato/naturalism re-connection is just brilliant). If there is one figure in addition to Whitehead that speculative philosophers must “work through” today – or encounter, or engage and appropriate in some way – it is Hegel. There is no doubt in my mind about that.\n\nAnd, yes, Robert Brandom offers a glimpse onto certain unresolved issues. Brandom felt that Hegel resolved some of the issues of Kant concerning certain unresolved dualisms, such as that between ontology and deontology. To quote Brandom:\n\nKant… punted many hard questions about the nature and origins of normativity, of the blindingness of concepts, out of the familiar phenomenol realm of experience into the noumenal realm. Hegel brought these back to earth by understanding normative statuses as social statuses – by developing a view according to which … all transcendental constitution is social institution. The background against which the conceptual activity of making things explicit is intelligible is taken to be implicitly normative essentially social practice. (Brandom, 2000 Making it Explicit: 33-34)\n\nIt’s this dependence on the normative which aligns Brandom and Brassier in that both push the justification of normative practices into the social. For Brassier this would be the social practices of scientists as they endlessly debate and revise their knowledge and claims about the world. The whole point of this is to move conceptual practices from a conceptual idealism and into a “space of reasons” or conceptual reasoning. If it is a social practice that entails continuous negotiation of conceptual clarity through progressive elaboration or making explicit that which is implicit in conceptual content then we see how both Brandom and Brassier endorse such a community of normativity about such claims. Instead of relying on subjective appeal we enter into sociality of knowledge.\n\nIf the objectivity of this idealism of making it explicit is justified then it is because it has a double vision or structure that entails a responsibility for (the individual philosopher or scientist) the claims about and to the world, then it is not grounded in the object-nature of the world, but rather to the rational objectivity of it. Yet, Brassier, would append to this “sociality of reason” and Hegel’s exteriorizing of nature as Idea. As he stated in his essay Concepts and Objects in the Speculative Turn I:\n\nFor those of us who take scientific representation to be the most reliable form of cognitive access to reality, the problem is one of granting maximal (but not, please note, incorrigible) authority to the scientific representation of the world while acknowledging that science changes its mind about what it says there is. Accordingly, the key question becomes: How can we acknowledge that scientific conception tracks the in-itself without resorting to the problematic metaphysical assumption that to t0 do so is to conceptually circumscribe the ‘essence’ (or formal reality) of the latter? For we want to be able to claim that science knows reality without resorting to the Aristotelian equation of reality with substantial form. The science of objects must be prosecuted in tandem with a science of concepts, of the sort currently prefigured by Sellarsian naturalists such as Paul Churchland, although we cannot follow the latter in maintaining that pragmatic-instrumentalist constraints provide a secure epistemological footing for the connection between concepts and objects. (Key: 46)\n\nIt is against the substantial formalists (phenomenology, etc.) that his dualism and dialectic of concept and object as an interplay within conceptual reasoning that is unbounded rather than bounded by ‘pragmatic-instrumentalist constraints’. In this same essay Brassier levels a compelling argument against both Latour and his disciple Graham Harman:\n\n15. Unless reason itself carries out the de-mystification of rationality, irrationalism triumphs by adopting the mantle of a scepticism that allows it to denounce reason as a kind of faith. The result is the post-modern scenario, in which the rationalist imperative to explain phenomena by penetrating to the reality beyond appearances is diagnosed as the symptom of an implicitly theological metaphysical reductionism. The metaphysical injunction to know the noumenal is relinquished by a post-modern ‘irreductionism’ which abjures the epistemological distinction between appearance and reality the better to salvage the reality of every appearance, from sunsets to Santa Claus.\n\nUltimately for Brassier it is a need to formulate an Sellarsian inferentialist account of the normative structure of conception that returns us to a scientific realism unencumbered by the epistemological strictures of empiricism. He is seeking to realign metaphysics and epistemology, one that is marked by the intersection of two threads: the epistemological thread that divides sapience from sentience and the metaphysical thread that distinguishes the reality of the concept from the reality of the object. He is trying to avoid the collapse of being and meaning into each other, instead if philosophy is to “attain a proper understanding of what it is for something to be independently of our conceiving, understanding and interpreting its being.” But to do this he thinks we will have to investigate how we know (the epistemic grounds of our knowledge) the “origins, scope, and limits of our ability to conceive, understand, and interpret what things are.”\n\nYet, for Brandom there is a priority of pragmatics (doing) over semantics (meaning) in which doings are deontologically prior to being, and that deontology replaces ontology completely in the sense that doings exhaust being (see Grant Idealism: 270). This return to the ethical can also be seen in many of the New Materialists who seem to be grounding their commitments to matterings in an ethical ‘space of reasons’. I think of Rosi Braidotti, Karen Barad, Jane Bennett, etc. Their return to ethics and commitment to an epistemic materialism seems heading in that direction. The older forms of physicalism and naturalism as portrayed in scientism is going through a time of purging. I think we are seeing a profound revisionism within the materialist conceptions that have guided both philosophy and science since the Enlightenment. What direction it will take is anyone’ guess. The verdict is still out. So far we have yet to see any singular voice in the matter, no strong philosophical statement to battle with in this direction. Maybe Brassier’ new work in the pipes will bring together these pieces out of Hegel, idealism, materialism, continental and post-analytical etc. Who knows? It’s all interesting and we are in exciting times. My major concern is the return to Plato that I see in philosophers such as Badiou. This has been tried before and it will not wash. We cannot return to Plato, that is a path foreclosed for any materialism worth its meat. The new materialisms are playing with fire at the moment in their dealings with the older forms of idealism, and this is another aspect that disturbs my own sense of materialist traditions. I seek to purge it of all forms of idealism. For me at least Ideas are not real. I guess I’m still investing in some form of post-Darwinian naturalism. It’s just the epistemic aspects that need a great deal more clarification. Nick Land was heading down the path but his train left the track toward parts unknown; and, instead, he hides within the worlds of cultural critique. Too bad. He should regain his courage and enter the battle where it counts. When you play with fire you can at times get burnt. Yet, what is left of the embers of those texts gathered in Thirst and Fanged Noumenon are still viable and have threads that others should follow and amplify."
