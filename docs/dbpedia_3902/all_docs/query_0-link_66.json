        "text": "A few brief notes on upcoming works in other languages. First, the Russian translation of Slime Dynamics (painstakingly done by Diana Khamis) will be coming out soon from Hyle Press. My recent review of Ferraris’ Positive Realism has been translated by Carlos Lema into Galician. It is available here. Lastly Anna Longo has translated my interview with Badiou from […]\n\nThe initial chatter around Pete Wolfendale’s book generally seemed to fall into two camps. The first being that the text was merely a massive pile of vitriol directed towards OOOers with the second being the question ‘Why would Pete devote so much of his time to a provocation that may well go unanswered?’ Wolfendale addresses […]\n\nA few days ago the Emancipation as Navigation Summer school came to an end in Berlin. The event was just short of two weeks and included a range of topics from political theory, to logic, to diagramming the space of sex, to technofeminism, to the history of metaphysics, to Iberian cultures, to space travel, and […]\n\nFollowing from my last two posts (1 and 2) I have argued that German Idealism (and this is a fairly common observation) is a non-substantial monism by which the philosopher is set up as a figure of navigation having absorbed skepticism and the subsequent self-conditioning, to create or synthesize in a way that has global […]\n\nFollowing from my last post I want to argue that German Idealism is a project that takes the genesis of the abstract as engine and problem for philosophical practice and for practice taken more generally. Assuming Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel accept Kant’s critique of dogmatic metaphysics but want to evade his methodological dualism as a […]\n\nI recently read two reviews of recent books on German Idealism. The first was a review by Dean Moyar of Brady Bowman’s fascinating sounding Hegel and the Metaphysics of Absolute Negativity while the second was Sebastian Gardner’s review of Markus Gabriel’s Transcendental Ontology (which has been out for a while but only recently released in paper back). Both of […]\n\nJon Cogburn has posted a nice things to look for kind of post (but more thoughtful than that really) in regards to continental philosophy. The texts that he links to confirm some broader issues that I (and others) have been circling around recently: 1 – The legacy of Hegel as something more than a theory […]\n\nPhilosophy…the very world bears a halo so tarnished with the fingernail scratches of a desperate hold that its meaning is as dim as it is persistent. Philosophy begins in wonder, in disappointment, with anything except instantaneous experience (according to Laruelle). So say the philosophers. Though few comments have seemed as honest as Lyotard’s – that […]\n\nI am consistently guilty over my lack of knowledge of contemporary art and aesthetics. Particularly in relation to Speculative Realism it seems that artists, curators, and media practitioners of various stripes are far better than philosophers or theorists at addressing art. This seems particularly evident in events such as The Matter of Contradiction (the video […]\n\nThere a quite a few interesting philosophy and theory conferences coming up in the next few months so I thought I’d do a post here: Feminism, Science and Materialism Feb 14-15, 2013 Keynote: Karen Barad CUNY, NYC 1000 w abstracts due November 1, 2012 Duquesne Graduate Conference in Philosophy (Philosophy and Nature) Feb 23, 2013 […]"
