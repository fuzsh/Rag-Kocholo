        "text": "Her research focuses on different conceptions of the relationship between the social and the political and the way this relationship impacts social and theoretical conceptions of democracy, human rights, freedom and emancipation.\n\nRelatedly, she researches the ‘materiality of politics’ working with different connotations of ‘materialism’ from diverse theoretical traditions such as feminism, Marxism and more recent object-oriented and realist philosophies.\n\nHe held visiting positions and taught at the European University at St Petersburg, the Freud Museum, London, the University of New Mexico, the Institute of Philosophy of Ljubljana, the Istituto di Scienze Umane of Naples, the Jnanapravaha Mumbai, and the American University of Beirut. He co-directed an independent graduate school in Italy, the Genoa School of Humanities.\n\nHis general field of expertise is post-Kantian European philosophy. In particular, his research interests are in the area of Freudian and Lacanian theory, 20th and 21st century French philosophy, French and Italian bio-political thought, and Marxist theory.\n\nHis major publications include the following books and edited volumes: Subjectivity and Otherness (MIT Press, 2007), The Italian Difference (Re.press, 2009) (with Alberto Toscano), Italian Thought Today (Routledge, 2014), Lacan and Philosophy (Re.press, 2014), The Not-Two (MIT Press, 2016), The Virtual Point of Freedom (2016, Northwestern University Press). He edited and translated several books by Agamben and Virno into English and by Žižek into Italian. His articles and books have been translated into more than ten languages.\n\nChiesa is currently working on two book projects. The first (co-authored with Adrian Johnston) aims at developing the concept of ‘agnostic atheism’ through psychoanalysis. The second focuses on bureaucracy and intends to unravel the nexus between knowledge, enjoyment, and capitalism from a psychoanalytic and Marxist perspective.\n\nHe is the editor of the book series “Insubordinations” at the MIT Press."
