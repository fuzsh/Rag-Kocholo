        "text": "Genre: Philosophy\n\nSkirmishes: With Friends, Enemies, and Neutrals\n\nPublished: 11/17/2020\n\nOne of the fifty most influential living philosophers, a “self-promoting charlatan” (Brian Leiter), and the orchestrator of an “online orgy of stupidity” (Ray Brassier). In Skirmishes: With Friends, Enemies, and Neutrals, Graham Harman responds with flair and wit to some of his best-known critics and fellow travelers. Pulling no punches, Harman gives a masterclass in[…]\n\nDiseases of the Head: Essays on the Horrors of Speculative Philosophy\n\nPublished: 09/24/2020\n\nDiseases of the Head is an anthology of essays from contemporary philosophers, artists, and writers working at the crossroads of speculative philosophy and speculative horror. At once a compendium of multivocal endeavors, a breviary of supposedly illicit ponderings, and a travelogue of philosophical exploration, this collection centers itself on the place at which philosophy and[…]\n\nThe Viscous: Slime, Stickiness, Fondling, Mixtures\n\nPublished: 05/21/2020\n\nSlime, goo, gunge, gloop, gels, sols, globules, jellies, emulsions, greases, soaps, syrups, glues, lubricants, liquid crystals, moulds, plasmas, and protoplasms – the viscous is not one thing, but rather a quality of resistance and flow, of stickiness and slipperiness. It is a state of matter that oozes into the gaps of our everyday existence, across[…]\n\nRough Notes to Erasure: White Male Privilege, My Senses, and the Story I Cannot Tell\n\nPublished: 04/23/2020\n\nWe are living through the wrack of the White Male. As the compact between social hierarchy, inherited privilege, and race (reinforced by gender and other normative categories) shows signs of buckling, his rage and resentment threaten us all. For he is a thing possessed: possessed by his own love of possession, and born to a[…]\n\nMisinterest: Essays, Pensées, and Dreams\n\nImprint: Dead Letter Office\n\nPublished: 06/27/2019\n\nThe term “interest” lacks a precise antonym. In English, we have “disinterested” and “uninteresting,” but we want for a term that denotes robust opposition to interest. The same appears to hold true in every other language (as far as we know). Interest’s missing antonym reflects not merely a widespread lexical oversight, but a misrecognition of[…]\n\nReiner Schürmann and the Poetics of Politics\n\nImprint: Dead Letter Office\n\nPublished: 09/28/2018\n\nReiner Schürmann’s thinking is, as he himself would say, “riveted to a monstrous site.” It remains focused on and situated between natality and mortality, the ultimate traits that condition human life. This book traces the contours of Schürmann’s thinking in his magnum opus Broken Hegemonies in order to uncover the possibility of a politics that[…]\n\nShadowing the Anthropocene: Eco-Realism for Turbulent Times\n\nPublished: 10/09/2018\n\nA spectre is haunting humanity: the spectre of a reality that will outwit and, in the end, bury us. “The Anthropocene,” or The Human Era, is an attempt to name our geological fate – that we will one day disappear into the layer-cake of Earth’s geology – while highlighting humanity in the starring role of[…]"
