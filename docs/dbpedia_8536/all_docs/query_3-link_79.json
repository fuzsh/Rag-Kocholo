        "text": "‘The fire of your separation has burnt our hearts; The Storm of desire to meet you has ravaged our lives’\n\n(‘Ae Aatish e furaqaat dil ha kabab kardah; Selaab a ishtiqat khanaha kharab karda’)\n\nThus greeted Baba Farid at his Ajodhan khankah in modern day Pakistan, to Nizamuddin Auliya who, instead of accepting title of a qualified Qazi in the King’s court, chose to embrace the love and spirituality of Sufism. Formally initiated as the successor to Baba Farid in 1265, he continued to provide spiritual solace to the poor and rich alike, till his death in 1325, just when Muhammad bin Tughluq had ascended the throne in Delhi. Nizamuddin’s bitter relationship with the former Sultan, Ghiasuddin Tughluq, could be defined by two eternal moments: while his curse of “Ya rehey ujjar; ya basey gujjar” turned the Sultan’s newly built grand fortress to a ghost-city; “Hunuz Dilli Dur Ast “ symbolized Ghiasuddin’s untimely heavenly abode, just 4 years after his pioneering establishment of the Tughluq Dynasty. The new Sultan – Muhammad-bin-Tughluq, however had great respect for the Sufi Saint, and it was he who carried the funeral bier of Nizamuddin on the streets of Delhi – paying his final homage to the ‘Sultan al Mashayakh’, or ‘emperor of the Mystics’.\n\nBelow is a video of the life story of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya by the head priest of the dargah, Farid Ahmed Nizami.\n\nMuhammad bin Tughluq, in his times, built a dome over the grave of Nizamuddin Auliya, which was further repaired and restored by Feroz Shah: however these 700-year old original structures no longer exist. The present structure of the Dargah was first constructed during Akbar’s time in 1563; and the dome was constructed by Mughal Emperor Akbar Shah II in 1824.\n\n“We buy flowers for Nizamuddin’s feet; Dream in the corner to the quawwal’s beat.\n\nThe saint’s song chokes in his throat. The poor tie prayers with threads\n\nAccustomed to their ancient wish, For the milk and honey of paradise.”\n\n-Agha Shahid Ali ( 1949-2001); Indo-American Poet.\n\nIn those dark medieval times, Nizamuddin was witness to countless acts of extreme violence let lose on a population living in abject poverty. It was certainly a political and social volatile world, of extreme cruelty and vulgarity : it was a time when Sultans would crush rebels under the feet of elephants; when his fellow Turkish Sultans routinely flayed hundreds of people; when Sultan Balban – known for never having laughed in his entire life – executed 12000 people including women and children; when founder of Khilji empire – Jalaluddin executed fellow mystic saint Sidi Maula; when Allauddin Khilji paraded his predecessor Jalauddin’s head mounted on a spear on the streets; and, when Allauddin Khilji did not hesitate a bit in executing thousands of ‘goat-bearded’ Mongols to sprinkle their blood on the foundation of his new fort Siri, to bring good luck and success.\n\nCulturally however, Delhi in the 13th century -along with Cairo and Anatolia in Turkey- was a lively place attracting a variety of unusual personalities, who were fleeing their homelands in the Mongol ravaged Central Asia.\n\nIn Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin’s thatched settlement in the small village of Ghiyaspur became a refugee for all those seeking spiritual solitude. While Nizamuddin and the inmates lived in abject poverty, but the he would only eat sparingly saying that he can not swallow food when thousands in the city are in hunger. Nizamuddin, a bookworm, would be studying manuscripts by candlelight throughout the night, resulting in his red inflamed eyes from reading late into night. For the spiritual nourishment to the Saint and his followers, regular sama mehfils were being held in the khanqah.\n\n(Qawaal brothers Sultan and Osman Nizami at the Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya)\n\nSama, a kind of devotional concert using music and dance, was fiercely opposed on the basis that song and dance in worship are un-Islamic. On the demands of fellow noblemen to prohibit Nizamuddin to practice Sama, Ghiasuddin asked each of them to note down their understanding of Sama. On reading the papers as “wicked”, “impure”, “dirty”, etc; the Sultan asked if the esteemed noblemen could not agree on a single interpretation of Sama, how could he ask Nizamuddin to stop it?\n\nToday, surrounding the epicenter of the final resting place of Hazrat Sheikh Khwaja Syed Muhammad Nizamuddin Aulia, lie numerous tombs and mausoleums of devotees , noblemen, and emperors reading like who’s who list of Delhi history – from the non descript tombstones of some unknown foot soldier of history, to the gigantic Humayun’s tomb – all vying for the spirituality radiating out from the Dargah to the rest of the world.\n\nStarting of course with his closest companion Amir Khusrau, other tombs belong to that of poet Ghalib; historian Barani; the Sufi princess Jahanara-the favourite daughter of Shahjahan; Delhi’s first octagonal tomb of Khan e Khanan Tilangani – prime minister of Firuz Sah Tughluq credited with building 7 Delhi mosques in militaristic Tughluq architecture; tomb of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah ‘Rangeela’ ( 1719-1748); tomb of Atgah Khan – husband of Akbar’s wet nurse Ji Ji Angah; tomb of Bahadur Shah Zafar’s brother Mirza Jehangir – for whom the ‘Phoolwalon Ki Sair’ was institutionalized in Delhi; the exquisitely beautiful ‘Chausanth Khamba’ with the grave of Atgah Khan’s son – Koka; and many more known and unknown souls all of whom sought to have their final resting place in the vicinity of the greatest of Sufi saints.\n\nAs poet Agha Shahid Ali writes:\n\nBetween two saints, he shares the earth, Mohommad Shah “Rangeele,” (evoked in Paluskar’s khayal)\n\nThe beggar-woman kisses the marble lattice, sobs on Khusro’s pillars.\n\nIn a corner, Jahanara, garbed in the fakir’s grass, mumbles a Sufi quatrain.\n\nAmir Khusrau:\n\nNizamuddin was happiest in the company of Amir Khusrau; and it was Khusrau’s nature to make sure Nizamuddin never stopped smiling.\n\nAmir Khusrau at the age of 16 thus approached Nizamuddin at the doorsteps of Ghiyaspur khanqah, reciting:\n\nThou art such a king that when a pigeon perches up on top of thy palace it becomes a falcon;\n\nA poor and distressed person stands on thy threshold, Is he permitted to go in or should he return?\n\nKhusrau would ask Nizamuddin to grant sweetness to his lyrics and melodies; and pray to God for the success of his compositions. Lovingly addressing him as ‘my Turk’, Nizamuddin had proclaimed, ‘Khusrau is the keeper of my secrets. I shall not set foot in paradise without him.’\n\nSuch was the Saint’s affection for the poet that he told, ‘If permissible by Islamic law, I would have willed Khusrau be buried in the same grave as me.’\n\nKhusrau achieved his creative zenith with blessings from his Sufi master. He lived under the patronage of 7 successive sultans, and was awarded the title of ‘Nightingale of India’ –or, Toot e Hind: a genius poet who laid the nucleus of Urdu poetry by his fusion of local Brijbhasha ( Khari Boli) and Hindi melodies with Arab, Turkish and Persian compositions; and evolution of Indian classical vocal and instrumental music. He is credited with the innovation of Sitar & Tabla; and also the creation of Qawwali.\n\nOn hearing his master’s death in 1325 , Khusrau blackened his face, tore his garments, and recited his last verse at Nizamuddin’s grave:\n\nGori sove sej par, mukh par dare kes; Chal Khusrau ghar aapne, rain bhaee chahun des.\n\n(The fair one lies on the couch with her black tresses scattered over her face; O Khusrau, go home now, for night has fallen over the world.)\n\nAmir Khusrau died exactly 6 months after Nizamuudin breathed his last in 1325.\n\nHis dargah at erstwhile Ghiyaspur has been the prayer site for Babur when he first reached Delhi, for Akbar when he escaped an assassination bid, for Jehangir when son Shahjahan rebelled against him, and for Zafar who – in 1857 – visited the dargah to hand over the scared relics – footprints of the Prophet on a stone slab, and strands of hair – and offer his final prayers before surrendering to the British.\n\nSufism is more demanding of a person than the mere fulfillment of religious duties. An unbroken Silsilah or chain of ‘Initiations’ binds the Master and the disciple in both life and after-life. The Chishti order of Sufism –which peaked during Nizamuddin Auliya – was elevated to a socio-economic movement higher than just mere rituals. The word Sufi is perhaps derived from Arabic ‘Suf’ –wool, ‘Safaa’ – to clean, or even ‘sophia’ – the Greek word for wisdom.\n\nHaving transcended boundaries of religion , he was of the view that when God has made no such distinction of Hindu and Muslim while distributing nature’s bounty, who are we to make distinctions and discriminations.\n\nIn the poet’s words:\n\nI come here to sing Khusro’s songs.\n\nI burn to the end of the lit essence,\n\nas kings and beggars arise in the smoke.\n\n( Interiors of the chilla or the meditation centre of Nizamuddin Auliya situated behind Humayun’s Tomb)\n\nGhalib’s Tomb:\n\nMirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib ( 1797- 1869), the last great Mughal-era philosopher-poet, was witness to the defining moment in Indian history of decimation of Mughal Era, and establishment of British rule. Using pennames of Ghalib, and Asad, he wrote 1792 Urdu couplets, and as many as 11,340 Persian couplets. His verses were in such difficult metaphors that most of the times they seem unintelligible. Only selected poems from his entire Persian poems, or even his smaller Urdu Diwan, are popularly accessible even today.\n\n(For few anecdotes of Ghalib, please see my earlier blog post on Shahajahanbad:\n\nhttps://lighteddream.wordpress.com/2015/01/10/shahjahanabad-the-lost-city/)\n\nThese famous lines by him adorn a marble plaque in front of his grave at the Nizamuddin Dargah:\n\n‘When nothing was, then God was there. Had nothing been, God would have been.\n\nMy being has defeated me. Had I not been, what would have been.’\n\nGhalib’s rivalry with Zauq, his contemporary poet and tutor to Zafar, was legendary. Other famous poets in those times were Momin, and Daagh; and even Emperor Zafar was an accomplished poet. Ghalib wrote :\n\n‘Tis true a Poet’s words should burn; And melt, and glow like candle-flame.\n\nBut foster first a feeling heart; That can, like candle, melt with flame.”\n\nGhalib was appointed as the Zafar’s Poet-laureate only after Zauq’a death. His life was spent in poverty, and even after the British rule, his many attempts to get a pension did not materialize. He prophesized, that his talent will be recognized only by later generations.\n\n“Of dust I would ask if I could: O Miser, where are they?\n\nThose treasured ones, those assets prized; Where have you hid them, prey?”\n\nHe died on 15th of February 1869, the same year when Gandhiji was born.\n\nIn his Ghazals, the gender and identity of a lover is immaterial, it is the concept of love that he used in his poems, rather than any actual lover.\n\n“In love I found life’s joy; and balm for pain that men endure.\n\nAnd yet in love itself I found, That pain which knows no cure.”\n\nHe was a liberal mystic, almost a non-believer in religious orientation.\n\n“Dark-souled is he who seeks to gain; Plain pleasures from the wine.\n\nAll that I need is, day and night, To drown this self of mine.”\n\nBaoli:\n\n© Ravi Batra / TERI Press.\n\nThis image has been reproduced with the permission of TERI Press.

The Baoli, the source of famous conflict between the Sufi Saint and the Sultan, was renovated and cleaned by AKTC in 2009. After 700 years of its construction, tons of debris were removed and water was drained out to reveal its original wooden floor and circular steps. During the renovation, a secret underground passage which was said to be used by Nizamuddin to access the Baoli, was also found.\n\nAtgah Khan’s tomb:\n\nIt was built during Akbar’s time in 1566 for the husband of Akbar’s wet nurse Ji Ji Angah. Atgah was murdered by Adham Khan, son of Akbar’s another famous wet nurse Maham Angah out of jealousy. It is a beautifully ornamented square tomb 6 mts on each side, with marble and sandstone screens all around.\n\nChausath Khamba:\n\nIt was built by Atgah Khan’s son, Kokaltash, in 1625, and houses the graves of Kokaltash and his family members. It is made completely of marble, in a 6×6 matrix in a square layout, where the four corners consist of 4 pillars each, and each of the 16 pillars on its perimeter are each double-pillars; so making the total number of pillars as 64. There are 25 bays in the chamber, each having a low dome. In 2011, Germany granted 1,50,000 euros to AKTC for its restoration which is now complete.\n\nThe structure’s scenery was painted by William Daniell in 1789, with few palm trees around it, and a palanquin in the foreground depicting an important visitor.\n\nOther notable structures around the dargah is the Kali Masjid built by Tilangani; and the Jamaatkhana Mosque – the first mosque in India to have 5 domes- believed to be built by Firoz Shah Tughluq.\n\nRamit Mitra of Delhi By Foot led this walk, with Parwaz for discussion on Ghalib.\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Sufi Courtyards: Dargahs of Delhi; by Sadia Dehlvi\n\nThe Book of Nizamuddin Aulia; by Mehru Jaffer\n\nBatra, Ravi, 2012.

Its Diwal-I-Aam’s walls and pillars and balustrades, adorned with flowers, fruits, birds, and beasts done in the most beautifully finished mosaic, wrought with lapis lazuli, carnelians, agates, onyx, jasper, jadestone, green marble, amethyst and what not; the leaves and flowers and vines and stems interleaving, twining in and out, waving up and over all of the arches. Its roof, walls, and columns were hung with brocaded velvet from Turkey and China. If we can see the past, the palace peopled with hardy mountain men – the huge, powerful bodied Afghan, Baluchi, and Kashmiri- and haughty, fierce Rajput soldiers. The Diwan-I-Am, or the ‘Hall of Justice’ lined up with turban headed people in their flowing robes under the great canopy of embroidered velvet raised on four silver pillars, their heads downcast out of fear and respect for the sitting Emperor ; the learned Qazi seated on a raised marble slab in front of the emperor’s throne adorned with an embroidered mat, with a Koran in front of him on a silver book-stand, carefully concealing his feelings and inclinations to either side of the pleaders – rich or poor – who would be presenting their cases before the highest court of the country, against which there would be no further appeal. If we can redecorate in our minds, the rooms, walls, doorways with rich gorgeous crimson silk and velvet curtains, cover the floor with thick stuffed Persian carpets, richest satins and damasks of Persia and China, and rugs of heavy azure silk brocades glittering with inter-woven beaten gold, white muslins of gossamer firmness, arrange few immense cushions inlaid with pearls, and gems, and stitched in the famous gold cloth of Benares, it may seem ‘Arabian Nights’ may not actually be all fiction!\n\nAs if not quite self-evident then, the Persian inscriptions in gold above the Diwan-i-Khas still declared:\n\n“If there be a Paradise on Earth, it is this; it is this; it is this.”\n\nIt is said, that there was no parallel in the world to the three cities of Babylone, Shahjahanabad, and Lahore; where sufficient provision had been made for open spaces. Shahjahanabad was planned taking into advantage of the location of river Yamuna, and the Aravali Ridge, in a semi-elliptical layout of a bow fronting the river Yamuna, and the Chandni Chowk street representing the arm of an archer. Sufficient open spaces were allocated, including the placement of a central water canal at Chandni Chowk; and the city was provisioned with many beautiful gardens, such as Roshanara Gardens, Qudsia Bagh, Queen’s Garden, with their fountains and flowers making green buffer zones. The city architecture was like a poetry, where every single tree or building was in sync with the harmony of the place. It had 7 main gates for vehicular, mounted, or pedestrian traffic : Kashmiri, Mori, Kabuli, Lahori, Ajmiri, Turkmani; and Akbarabadi gates; in addition to three water front gates – Nigamabodh, Raja Ghat, and Qila Ghat; primarily for Hindu rituals.\n\nBefore Aurangzeb installed a stone veil, if anyone from the Diwan-i-Aam would cast his eyes from the famed Hall of Public Audience, towards the grand entrance of the citadel, looking yonder “Chandni Chowk’, the great thoroughfare of the city in a perfect straight line, it would have culminated at the Lahore Gate of the city boundary, right upto Fatehpuri Masjid, to immediately have a feel of the pulse of the city…\n\nThe Pulse of the city that would have manifested in simple rituals of those years:\n\nA dastan goh, or the professional story teller, would be roaming the city selling his stories in the daytime, and the evenings would be enlivened with the golden-voiced dancing girls in the intoxicated ambience of wine and beauty. The Mughal court would be holding gup-baazi or boasting matches, and in one instance, Jehangir was so pleased with the story teller Mullah Asad that he was awarded with an elephant, a horse and palanquin, and weighed in rupees.\n\nThere would be a random beggar who could recite the Koran by heart, and loved to travel by palanquin, and had a knack of predicting things. The famous bandsmen of Chandni Chowk, whose descendants still play at marriage processions, would be making preparations for a party. As the evening approaches, an old man hanging lanterns on his shoulder would start visiting one house hold to another, selling the lanterns in the dimmest of the gullies. The kabab-farrosh, or even the road side kababia, would be handing over the seekh, gola, chapli, kati, shami, nargisi, tandoori, murgh, machli and even hiran kebabs to the long queue of hungry souls. And along with Chandni Chowk’s chaats, and kulfis, people would be enjoying the jalebis at Ghantewala’s shop established in 1790 during Emperor Shah Alam’s time – named as ‘the Bell Ringer sweet shop’ because the Emperor’s royal elephant would stop here and ring the bell, and not budge unless the sweet-seller gave him enough sweets. The Garhaia Unani hakims – physicians in the Mughal Court – would be treating the patients , both the celebrity and as well as the common man , if not of anything serious, then at least, for Delhi Belly! In some corners, the Boxwallah would be visiting the customers carrying everything that a general merchant shop sells – lace, trinkets, shawls, combs, and what not. People would be shopping the loveliest necklaces, earrings and bracelets in the Dariba Kalan – ‘the street of the incomparable pearl’; and prospective bridegrooms lost in the glitz and glitter of gold and red wedding essentials like embroidered brocades in the Kinari Bazar – ‘the Wedding street’, or just having a fill of stuffed parathas at the Pandit Gaya Prasad Shiv Charan’s café in the Parethawalla Galli, whose sixth generation descendants still run the shop till date; or simply would be offering prayers at the Onyx-statue at the Urdu Jain Mandir ..\n\nChandni Chowk, was once a fine broad avenue with an open conduit running in its middle, supplied with water from an old canal that was built by Ali Mardan Khan. A stone paved walkway lined with shade giving trees paralleled a carriage way. Mornings here would be spent in the business transactions in this busy commercial mart, while in the evenings, all the noblemen and women would ride on their elephants with men running ahead of them, shouting and announcing their revered titles. It was a place of great show of Delhi, where brilliant processions of marriages and other important functions, would pass through this fine avenue. Royal families would turn up in their gorgeously caparisoned elephants, gaily decorated Royal guards, batteries of camels, trains of palkees, followed by the bride and groom seated on separate elephants, with servants waving giant peacock-feather fans.\n\nSometimes the Great Mughal Emperor would ride out on a hunting expedition or a pleasure trip to Khyber, Kabul, or Kashmir, from the palace gate onto these very streets of city: a giant army of richly garrisoned castled elephants, burdened camel trains, carrying the royal households and tents for the Durbar tent, reception tent, kitchen tents, living tents for the Royals, bath tents, tents for gymnasium and exercise, tents to be used as mosques,etc etc. along with troops of dancing girls, players, and buffoons to entertain in evening camps. Few rare animals would follow in tow – hooded hunting leopards trained to take down deer, led along by their keepers ; and even a few tigers in cages for a late afternoon entertainment of fight with a giant bull; with thousands of armed men leading the procession and shouting : “ Clear the way for his sublime Highness, the King of the world…!”\n\nWith the fall of ShahJahan at the hands of his son Aurangzeb, Jahanara, his tenderly beloved daughter preferred to look after her father in his captivity at Agra, over the splendor and unsurpassed magnificence of her loving brother’s court. 20 years later, she directed a simple tomb to be made for herself, at the Dargah of Nizamuddin Auliya, inscribed with her own lines:\n\n“ Let nought but the green grass cover the grave of Jahanara,\n\nFor grass is the fittest covering for the tomb of the lowly”\n\nThese very feelings reverberated almost a century later in the words of the English poet, Christina Rosetti (1830-1894) :\n\n“Be the green grass above me. With flowers and dewdrops wet;\n\nAnd if thou wilt, remember, And if thou wilt, forget.’\n\nThis is , however, the same city, the same street that Nadir Shah, the King of Persia, captured and plundered in 1739, killing and torturing, mutilating and butchering its citizens to extract money that dark day and night, when men killed their own family members and went out to the streets to die. On 7th March 1739, Nadir Shah ,after defeating Mughal emperor Mohammed Shah entered Red Fort, and for 4 days, had his troops under control so that citizens are not inconvenienced. However, when they force-demanded the granaries to be opened without paying the merchants, violence erupted resulting in death of few Persians. Nadir Shah rode out on his horse trying to calm the mobs, but was fired at. In the subsequent massacre that he ordered, almost 30,000 citizens were butchered by 3 PM on 10th March 1739. He returned to Persia in May 1739, carrying with him a huge loot including the Koh-i-noor, and the Peacock Throne. The throne’s cost was estimated by the resident French jeweler from Bordeaux in Shah Jahan’s court at 6 million pound sterlings; and the amount of treasure carried away by the Persians is estimated to be minimum of 320 million rupees.\n\nA mere 7 years later, the Afghan King of Kandahar; Ahmed Shah Durani arrived here with his massive force and laid siege to Delhi. After only a year’s time, the invading force of Marathas arrived to loot and plunder once again, taking down the gold and silver filigree ceiling of the palace, melting it into 17,00,000 rupees. Two years later, Ahmed Shah Durani returned again to extract whatever he can get and looted the city once more. Eleven years later, the Rohillas marched into the city, captured Emperor Shah Alam and blinded him, forcing him to produce concealed wealth that has long been plundered. In 1803, Lord Lake, marched into Delhi with a British force, releasing the Moghul emperor and the citizens from the clutches of the oppressive vassalage of Marathas. There was nothing of monetary significance left in the city by the time Lord Lake set his foot in Chandni Chowk, but the king, nonetheless, preferred the British captor to the Maratha captors, and thus began the British Resident-ship over the Mughal Court, with Sir David Ochterloney.\n\nAfter the 1857 uprising, the East India Company was dissolved, and power was transferred to the British Crown, and thereafter began erecting numerous statues of Queen Victoria, just like the Nehru-Gandhian naming spree that blossomed after the Independence. In Delhi, Connaught Place was named after Queen Victoria’s son; a bronze statue of Queen was erected in Chandni Chowk in front of the Town Hall, at the erstwhile site of Jahanara’s famed Caravan-serai, the statue now having been replaced with that of Swamy Shraddhanand; Victoria Zenana Hospital was commissioned near Jama Masjid; numerous schools were named QV, in addition to naming so many little girls after the Queen; even a dal was named as Malka Masoor because of Queen’s fondness for it! A statue of Prince Edward VII riding on a horse was installed in front of the Red Fort, but removed and replaced now with that of Subhas Chandra Bose.\n\nBegum Samroo, once more:\n\nA little over a half century after Aurangzeb’s reign was over, stormy times came on Delhi, as one weak and inefficient Prince after another ascended the throne. Ninth on the Mughal line was Shah Alam, and during these times, countless European deserters – mostly Portuguese, French, British, and Dutch – from their Army and Navy flooded India offering armed mercenary services and trainings to the comparatively far inferior Indian troops. One such deserter from the French East India company was the German national Reinhardt , to whom Begum Samru had married. Sometimes after unsuccessful military campaigns when war spoils would be less, there would be a minor mutiny in the ranks, and the soldiers would bind Reinhardt to a canon’s mouth and slowly light up a fire; prodding him to chose distribution of more money, or get roasted from the heat of the iron barrel. After his death in 1778, Begum Samru converted to Christianity, and used her haveli in Chandni Chowk – gifted to her by Mughal emperor Akbar Shah – for retaining a part of her troops here, while the larger battalions, an ammunition depot and gun foundry was at Sardhana. After her rescue of Shah Alam in 1788 from the rebels who blinded the king to extract his hidden wealth, Begum Samru rose very fast in the echelon of power in the Mughal court. Shortly thereafter, she married Frenchman Le Vassoult; but during yet another rebellion in her battalion, she took out her dagger and stabbed herself in her palkee. As the news of the blood soaked Begum was carried over by the wailing maids to Vassoult, he immediately drew his pistol and blew out his brains. Begum somehow survived the suicide bid. In the inevitable British-Maratha war, she wisely foresaw the winning side and switched her loyalty to the British, which immensely enhanced her power equation. She died at an advanced age in 1835, leaving her fortune to her step-son. Her palatial bungalow at Chandni Chowk, after changing few hands, was purchased by Lala Bhagirath Mal in 1940, and the present electronics market is known by his name as Bhagirath market.\n\n( For more of Chandni Chowk, please see my earlier post on Shahajahanabad:\n\nhttps://lighteddream.wordpress.com/2015/01/10/shahjahanabad-the-lost-city/)\n\nChunnamal’s Haveli:\n\nLala Chunnamal’s 3-storied, 128-room Haveli, known to have played host to Kate Winslet in recent times, was constructed in 1848 by the wealthy textile merchant of Chandni Chowk. The original chandeliers, clocks, life-size mirrors, candle stands and even a functional fireplace adorn its drawing room. Presently the tenth generation lives in the haveli.\n\nChunnamal was one of those British-loyal money-lenders, bankers and traders who prospered even more after the 1857 revolt, having enough liquid cash to buy not only immunity from the Prize Agents , but was able to buy large havelis of erstwhile Mughal noblemen that were put up for auction by the British. Lala Chunnamal was even able to purchase the Fatehpuri Masjid at Rs 40,000; which he sold back to the British in 1877 in exchange for 4 villages worth Rs 116,613, clocking a 300 per cent profit.\n\nMirza Ghalib had bitterly commented, “ While most of Delhi was plunged in grief and darkness, Chunnamal’s haveli was so flooded with light that it made night look like day.”\n\nFatehpuri Majid:\n\nBuilt in 1650 by one of Shah Jahan’s wives, Fatehpuri Begum, the well-cared-for mosque still offer an air of calm, even though shops, a Muslim School, and a public library now share its walls. Its central niche, or Mihrab, pointing to Mecca, is simple yet striking. In the courtyard, graves of the Shahi Imams who had served the mosque can be found. After 1857 rebellion, the mosque remained a private property of Lala Chunnamal for almost 17 years, before it was needed back by the British to hand over to the Muslims.\n\nKhari Baoli & Gadodia Market:\n\nThe ‘Brackish Step-Well Street’ has been a very busy street, from the times of Shah Jahan, selling myriad nuts, dry fruits, such as almonds, cashewnuts, pistachio nuts, raisins, dried dates and figs, among others. In the olden days, the street was the route to Lahore. The tributary of river Yamuna was brought to Shahjahanabad via a canal running along this street, before feeding the central water body of Chandni Chowk, and also into the Red Fort, where it ran in water-ways inlaid with white and green marble in zigzag lines, which, once full of water, gave the impression of fishes swimming.\n\nThe step-well is not visible , and must have long been encroached.\n\nBuilt by Seth Narayan Gadodia almost 75 years back, the Gadodia spice market lives on today, even with its original spaciousness now disappeared, with porters busily carrying sacks of chillies, turmeric, cloves, and all sorts of spices, that makes the market so full of smell, on a working day.\n\nNau-ghar:\n\nThe cul-de-sac called Naughara, or Nine Houses, is a quaint little street with its own gate that the residents can close in the evening; and the houses in the street are quite distinctive with their brightly colored doors, and all of them are occupied by Jain households living like one extended family.\n\nGhantewalla:\n\nApart from the sweet-obsessed elephant’s story, there is another interesting reference to Ghantewalla during the uprising.\n\n“The troops who can act with great daring outside…the moment they drink the water of the city and take a round of Chandni Chowk and stroll about in the big and small Dariba and go around Jama Masjid and enjoy the qalaqaand of Ghantewala and its laddus, they lose all urge and determination to fight…experience as well as books of histories and biographies show us how this place [that is, Delhi] has been prone to luxury and idleness.” — Dehli Urdu Akhbar, August 23, 1857.\n\nKanika Singh of Delhi Heritage Walks led this heritage exploration.\n\nReferences:\n\nCapital Vignettes; by RV Smith\n\nOld Delhi 10 Easy Walks; by Gaynor Barton & Laurraine Malone\n\nIllustrated India: Its Princess and People; by Julia A.

In fact, Maham Anga, the foster-mother of Akbar, was the de-facto Regent of the Mughal Empire from 1560-1562 when she schemed along with her son Adham Khan to advance her own authority, a ‘petticoat government of its worst kind’ under the harem-party.\n\nVery few monuments in India are attributed to women builders in India, and this mosque-madrasa complex is one of them. Literally meaning “ The Most Auspicious of Houses ‘ , it was built in 1561 by Maham Anga, shortly before she died following son Adham Khan’s execution by Akbar. Only after 1562, Akbar was able to rule peacefully without further interference.\n\nOnce, in 1564, when Akbar was passing through the bazaar in front of the Lal Darwaza and the mosque, an arrow was fired at him by a slave, grazing Akbar and killing a guard. Akbar is said to have escaped the assassination bid due to his short height, and he afterwards visited Nizamuddin Dargah to pray and thank for his survival.\n\nThe mosque is said to be erected without foundations. As one enters the neatly cut red sandstone large and majestic gateway entrance with a hollow concavity, once faces the large rectangular open courtyard with the double storied madrasa rooms on three side and the 3 arched mosque flanking the fourth side, directly opposite the gateway. A hemispherical dome topped with a Mughal-styled filial sits on the central of the 3 arches. Inside, the prayer chamber consists of five compartments, and the central one is the most beautiful, however, only faint remnants of multi colored paint and tile work remains on the central mihrab. The mosque is still functional, though in limited use. A well on the right is still being used by the faithful for ablutions. 400 years back , the small cell-like rooms in the now ruined madrasa must have housed the small boys whose young voices must be filling the courtyard with their loud recital of Koranic scriptures.\n\nA marble slab fixed on the central arch reads in Persian:\n\n“ In the time of Jalaluddin Mohammed who is the greatest ( Akbar ) of just kings, When Maham Anagah, the protector of chastity, created this buiding…”\n\nLal Darwaza\n\nAfter defeating Humayun in 1540, Sher Shah Suri demolished and re-used the materials from the cities of Dinpanah, Feroz Shah Kotla, and Siri, and raised his new city, SherGarh “the abode of the Lion”. While his Qila is enclosed by three gates referred to as the Bada Darwaza, Talaqi Darwaza and Humayun Darwaza; the outer city in front of the fortress was demarcated by few more gates, such as the Lal Darwaza, and Kabuli Darwaza.\n\nThe intricately adorned red-and-white Lal Darwaza made from red sandstone and grey quartzile, marked the southern entry to the city, while the Kabuli Darwaza marked the northern periphery of the city boundary. At the Lal Darwaza, rows of arcades lined both sides of a road built from the gate into the city, and they were possibly housed a bustling bazaar. The gate is flanked on either side by walls and bastions. Merlons with loopholes adorn the top of the gate as well as the rounded bastions in the wall curtain.\n\nThough ruled for 5 short years till 1545, Sher Shah is referred to as a “Nation Builder” with a rare foresight. Administratively speaking, he set up the foundation of governance upon which Akbar built his super structure. While Babur and Humayun did not have much time to carry out any long term constructive planning, Akbar – no doubt the greatest ruler of the Mughal empire – heavily borrowed many executive policies from Sher Shah. It is doubtful if Mughal empire could have re-establish itself in India from 1555, had Sher Shah continued for a longer period. Sher Shah was killed in 1545 during the siege of Kalanjar.\n\nApart from laying the massive highway from Chittagong in Central Bangladesh to Kabul for tax free trade, dotted with caravanserais and shady resting stops along the road, establishment of postal and tri-metal currency systems; he started governance initiatives such as religious tolerance, an impartial justice system, provincial government structure, and a land revenue system.\n\nThe other city gate that still exists today from Sher Shah’s reign, is the Kabuli or Khooni Darwaza whose bloody history and association with slaying and butchery has earned its distinguished name over the ages, but nothing matches with what happened here in 1857.\n\nIn 1857, at the Khooni Darwaza, Captain William Hodson – credited with setting up Hodson’s Horse irregular cavalry unit, and an extremely efficient intelligence network in Delhi – did something very horrible while transporting the arrested Mughal princesses from Humayun’s tomb. As if to compensate for his earlier unauthorized guarantee of life given by him to Zafar, Zeenat Mahal and their youngest son Jivan Bakht – he asked the three Mughal princess to get down from the cart and strip naked, and then taking out his Colt revolver, he shot them point blank one after another, and then pocketed their turquoise armlets and bejeweled swords. The bodies of the three princesses were then thrown in front of Kotwali where the British troops queued up to see the corpses. Hodson definitely enjoyed his act, for, he later boasted, “ In 24 hours, I disposed the principal members of the house of Timur”; referring to his series of successes starting with his negotiations and surrender of Zafar and Zeenat Mahal a day earlier.\n\nBagh E Bedil ( Garden of Bedil)\n\nThis complex has two graves, one that of the 17th century poet Bedil, and other one of Sufi Saint Malik Yaar Paran.\n\nMalik Yaar Paran:\n\nShaykh Nuruddin, or Shaykh malik Yaar Paran, migrated to India from Persia during Sultan’s Balban’s reign, and settled near Matka Pir’s khanqah. When Matka Pir objected to the encroachment, the visiting Shaykh magically produced a letter from Sultan Balban although the Sultan was out of city on an expedition. The amazed Matka Pir commented – My friend, the flying king “ Yaar Malik Paran’, and the Shaykh was accordingly known afterwards.\n\nNizamuddin Auliya is said to occasionally visit Shaykh Nuruddin’s dargah to offer prayers. Once Nizamuddin could not visit the dargah and wished if there was some transport available. Miraculously, few days later, a devotee of Shaykh Nuruddin presented a horse carriage to Nizamuddin saying he saw his master in his dreams directing him to do so.\n\nBedil:\n\n“Bedil, weep not for your losses for;\n\nThis party that is life is, after all, held in a glass-maker’s shop.” – Bedil, 17th century poet.\n\nBedil was one of the greatest poet this country has produced, but though he is virtually unknown in India, it is the Afghan literati who have been keeping his poetry alive, where he has a near-cult following.\n\nBedil’s poetry and philosophy has been hugely influential upon Persian Sufi thinkers and poets in Afghanistan. His birth place is controversial : some believe it to be Kabul, and some as Patna; but he came to settle in Delhi in 1664. Equally controversial is his place of demise in 1720: at least 3 claimants exist – one just outside Shahjahanabad that has possibly been disappeared in Yamuna’s change of course, or, destroyed by many attacks on the city; the present one near the Purana Qila that is considered as “an imagined approximation”, and at Khwaja Rawash in Kabul where his body was reportedly taken to be buried.\n\nBedil was well versed in Rekhta ( an earlier form of Urdu), Sanskrit, Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, and soon acquired fame as an accomplished Persian poet. Not only Ghalib, Momin, Iqbal and other Indian poets were deeply influenced by him; he also became an inspiration in Tajik-Persian literary circle.\n\nGhalib is said to adopt Bedil’s style of metaphysical expression, but he acknowledges that Bedil is of a higher plane.\n\nHe used to write in extremely difficult metaphors, and was therefore respectfully referred to as Abu Al-ma’ani ( ‘father of meaning’):\n\nSample this:\n\nAt time’s beginning\n\nthat beauty\n\nwhich polished creation’s mirror\n\ncaressed every atom\n\nwith a hundred thousand suns.\n\nBut this glory\n\nwas never witnessed.\n\nWhen the human eye emerged,\n\nonly then was he known.\n\nHe was witness to Shahjahan and Aurangzeb’s reigns. Aurangzeb during his rule encouraged long beards as a symbol of faith, which Bedil is said to have dismissed, saying a long beard would block a Mullah’s entry to heaven as nothing aesthetically offensive is accepted in the Heaven!\n\nTill date, there are poetry groups run by Afghan cab drivers in Washington on Bedil, where meetings are held once or twice a week to discuss the great poet’s work. Two such rival groups are “An Evening with the Dervishes”, and “An Evening of Sufism”\n\nThe present site shot to prominence when the visiting President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmanov in 2006 paid a visit here; prompting DDA to quickly spruce up the dilapidated tomb, erect a boundary wall and raise a stone slab with inscriptions in Urdu, Persian, Tajik, Hindi, and English.\n\nIn the 1930’s, the ‘discovery’ of the present grave site is credited to the then head-Caretaker of Nizamuddin Dargah, Khwaja Hasan Nizami near the grave of Malik Yaar Paran, and he built the tomb with financial help of Rs 2000 from the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nAnyways, thanks to the Tajik people and their President, for whose great attachment to Bedil, his grave is restored, and his story known to common people here.\n\nMatka Pir:\n\nThe quaint dargah stands on a small hillock, with earthen pitchers hanging from trees.\n\nMatka Pir belonged to Haidari Qalandars, named after the Turkish founder, and came to India during Mongol invasion of Persia in the mid 13th century. Qalandars were wandering Sufi saints with a distinctive dress and behavior styles.\n\nIbn Battuta wrote of Qalandars moulding hot iron rods, turning them into necklaces, rings, etc and wearing through their ears, hands etc.\n\nI am the mystic gypsy called qalandar,\n\nI have neither fire, home nor monastery,\n\nBy day I wander about the world, and at night,\n\nI sleep with a brick under my head.\n\nIt is said that the Pir had cured a traveler suffering from an incurable skin disease by offering waters of Yamuna charged with spiritual powers. Shaykh Abu Bakr used to provide his disciples with waters of Yamuna in earthen pots, and said to have mystical powers.\n\nSultan Balban was not happy with people turning to the Shaykh’s Khanqah more than to the Sultan’s court, so he sent a female slave Tamizan to seduce him, but Tamizan became a disciple of the Shaykh. She is buried in the same compound. Then Balban sent him a pot containing iron pellets, and the Shaykh turned the pellets into jiggery and chickpeas, and the Sultan also became his disciple. He died in 1300.\n\nEven today, the offerings to the Pir include chana, gur and milk in matkas. To deal with huge number of matkas in the dargah left behind by the devotees, the administration has introduced a novel idea of hanging them from tress for wish-fulfillment.\n\nIn 1912, the then Head-Caretaker of Nizamuddin Dargah, Khwaja Hasan Nizami predicted a deadly attack on Viceroy Lord Hardinge in a news paper, which actually happened near the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk few days later. The Viceroy who was riding on an elephant survived miraculously whereas the mahout was killed. As a gratitude to him, Lady Hardinge visited Khwaja Hasan Nizami, and agreed to his demand not to demolish the Matka Pir Dargah although it was planned to be razed for the construction of a new road.\n\nShaykh Abu Bakr’s khanqah was on the banks of Yamuna where regular music gatherings were being held, and Hazrat Nizamuddib used to attend the same. He was awarded the title of ‘white falcon’ – ‘Baz e Safid’ symbolizing his rare mystical achievements.\n\nMatka Pir, or Shaykh Abu Bakr was stabbed to death by one of his disciples. Although his fame during his lifetime matched with that of his contemporary Nizamuddin Auliya, his silsila died out with his death, as he had not appointed anyone as his spiritual successor.\n\nBhairon Temple:\n\nThe temple – dedicated to Lord Kala Bhairava, or Lord of Time-Death –a fierce incarnation in human form created by Lord Shiva , who ripped off the central fifth head of Brahma. Bhairav, or Bhairon, is often played out as a wine-drinking, meat-eating God playing the role of Guardian door-man to cities and temples, carrying the severed head of Lord Brahma. In spite of his Brahmanicide act, the ‘impure & anti-Brahmin’ Bhairava is elevated to ‘God’ status in mythology & recognized as the Supreme Divinity by Vishnu & Brahma; precisely because he carried out Shiva’s order to do so, to strike off the fifth head of the ‘pure & non-violent’ Brahma : a symbol of ambivalent compromise in society – a scapegoat “sin-eater’, a necessary evil required for societal balance.\n\nWhen the Pandavas were given a barren piece of land in Delhi to set up their city, they cleared it of the jungle and started building the most magnificent Vedic city of Indraprastha; Bhima built two temples at the backyard of their legendary city : ‘Doodhiya Bhairava temple’ where devotees offer milk in the temple, and ‘Kala Bhairava temple’ where devotees offer alcohol.\n\nAs per legend, Lord Bhairav agreed to come with Bheem under the condition that he should be placed only in the city of Indraprastha, however Bheem inadvertently placed him outside the city and Bhairav would not budge from that place. So Bheem had to build a temple at that very spot. It is said that Bheem used to worship here and got his psychic powers, or Siddhi.\n\nThe walk leader was Kanika Singh from Delhi Heritage Walks.\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Sufi Courtyard, by Sadia Dehlvi\n\nInvisible City, by Rakhshanda Jalil\n\nLove’s Alchemy: Poems from the Sufi Tradition; by David Fideler and Sabrineh Fideler\n\nCriminal Gods and Demon Devotees; Edited by Alf Hiltebeitel\n\nSahil Ahuja’s blog on ‘Khair ul Manazil’: http://pixels-memories.blogspot.in/2011/12/khair-ul-manazil-mosque-new-delhi.html\n\nPoems of Bedil:http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/Poets/B/BedilAbdulQa/CreationsWit/index.html;\n\nBagh-e-Bedil: http://www.outlookindia.com/blogs/posts.aspx?ddm=8&kid=102132&kname=Bagh-e-Bedil"
