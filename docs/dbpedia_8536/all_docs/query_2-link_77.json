He has been passing in and out of the same neighborhoods for more than a decade, documenting the minutest social and cultural changes… “–The New Yorker\n\nThe New Review, The Guardian, UK\n\n“… Mayank Austen Soofi is street-spiritual as well as funny, engaging and wise.”\n\nGQ India\n\nWith 2,748 posts (plus over 19,500 images on Instagram), it (The Delhi Walla) features the Delhi you should see, the Delhi that you never see, the Delhi that lies forgotten and sometimes even the Delhi that will come to be.\n\nThe Caravan\n\n“The Delhi Walla is one of the city’s best-known flâneurs.”\n\nTime Out Delhi\n\n“The Delhi Walla is a one-man encyclopedia of the city.”\n\nThe Guardian\n\n“The Delhi Walla is a celebration of the food, culture and books of India’s capital.”\n\nBiography of The Delhi Walla\n\nSince 2007, Mayank Austen Soofi has been collecting hundreds of stories taking place in Delhi, through writing and photography, for his acclaimed website The Delhi Walla. Every day, Mayank walks around the city with his camera and notebook to track down the part of extraordinary that exists in the seemingly mundane aspects of urban lives. By exploring and documenting the streets, buildings, houses, cuisines, traditions and people of Delhi, his work is also an attempt to give the megalopolis an intimate voice, and to capture the passing of time in this otherwise restlessly changing city.\n\nMayank is also a daily columnist for Hindustan Times newspaper, and the author of ‘Nobody Can Love You More: Life in Delhi’s Red Light District’ (published by Penguin) and the four-volume ‘The Delhi Walla’ guidebooks (HarperCollins).\n\nMayank Austen Soofi compulsively publishes texts and photos on his website, Facebook and Instagram.
