There is more history here than any city in the country,' says writer-columnist Sadia Dehlvi, in Rediff.com's continuing series where well-known Indians speak about their India.\n\nI love the diversity of India. The diversity in history, culture, people, languages, places, seasons...\n\nIt is very difficult to point out what I love the most about this country. But if you insist then I will tell you that I Love Delhi the most in this country.\n\nIt represents Sufism which I love. There are so many important and historical dargahs here.\n\nDelhi represents the composite culture of our country. It is the capital of the country and reflects the rest of the country.\n\nHere you will find people from every state of the country. You will find every language in the country being spoken here.\n\nEveryone feels at home here. It is a home to everyone.\n\nI am passionate about my city. It is steeped in history. I was born here, I have lived here and I hope to die here. My ancestors have been here for centuries.\n\nDelhi is one of the oldest cities in the country. When you see the Kashmiri gate and Ajmeri gate, you know that different corners of the country are represented here.\n\nLook at the buildings and architecture – Mughals, British, and the Kings before that have left their mark on Delhi.\n\nThere is more history here than any city in the country.\n\nThe Sufis that I revere lived here.\n\nI am really not impressed with India’s growth rate. It has not trickled down and that is our biggest challenge.\n\nWe have failed to eradicate poverty.\n\nWe have failed to eradicate illiteracy.\n\nWe have failed to empower women.\n\nMinorities here are still marginalised and we have failed to address their needs.\n\nSadia Dehlvi is the author of two books on Delhi’s Sufi history, The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi and Sufism, The Heart of Islam. Her family has lived in Delhi for generations.\n\nSadia Dehlvi spoke to A Ganesh Nadar."
