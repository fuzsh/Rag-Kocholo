        "text": "â€˜Remembering the day before the audition of a friend, who wanted to get into films... #star.\n\n'Remembering the day before the audition of a friend, who wanted to get into films... #star.' This was Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Rachel Dwyer's post featuring herself with Ranveer Singh, before his Bollywood entry (perhaps on the exact day before it!).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRachel Dwyer with Ranveer Singh\n\nWhen asked to comment on the then putative and sexy star, she said, \"Ranveer is a nice guy, smart and funny. I met him years ago with a group of friends and who was to know he'd become such a star? Of course he's handsome, but it's really his talent, charm, star quality and hard work that matter. Incidentally, the renowned academician who insists that she's now Ranveer's 'fan as well as a friend!' had campaigned valiantly to have her friend's youthful and abundant animal magnetism contained by some prudent 'cropping' of sumptuous bare chest on display. \"We will request cropping to protect his modesty,\" we promised. Here goes.\n\nGutsy women\n\nAmidst the startling revelations that have hit the headlines, made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner M N Singh at the launch of Godfathers of Crime - written by veteran journalist Sheela Raval, the one praising actress Preity Zinta, for being one of the few persons, brave and gutsy enough to depose in court about the threats she had from the underworld, most impressed us.\n\nMN Singh, Sheela Raval and Shobhaa De at the launch of the book\n\n\"Not everyone can fight against the underworld and help police,\" he said. Incidentally, sharp readers might have connected the dots when a few weeks ago we'd written about the imminent publishing of a book on the underworld written by a gutsy Capital-based female journalist.\n\nPreity Zinta\n\nIt was a day after Raval's riveting manuscript had reached our inbox. Raval's account of her trysts with some of the underworld's biggest dons was informative and engaging. We'd predicted a best seller then; the fact that it's already gone into reprint in its first week bodes well for our instincts.\n\nLooking within\n\nAmidst all the cacophony and shrill voices and wild allegations, the one voice of wisdom, compassion and sanity which we came across in response to artist Hema Upadhyay's murder was that of gallerist Abhay Maskara. We carry it here without comment, as it speaks for itself.\n\nHema Upadhyay and Abhay Maskara\n\nWe don't know why\n\nOur dear Hema was taken from us.\n\nthere are only wild theories\n\nto console our bereaved hearts.\n\nif it was for the pittance that was owed to the perpetrator\n\nlet us reflect on the ugly face of money\n\nand its evil twin - greed.\n\nIf it was in a fit of rage\n\nlet us reflect on the consequence of anger\n\nand its mirror image - hate.\n\nIf it was over a piece of property\n\nlet us reflect on the price we are willing to pay\n\nto get a better view of the muck below.\n\nWe don't know why\n\nour dear Hema was taken from us.\n\nThere are only wild theories\n\nto console our bereaved hearts.\n\nAnd no matter what the motive\n\nIt will never lessen our sorrow or our pain.\n\nSo let us all pray\n\nthat Hema is in a peaceful way.\n\nAnd as we close this year and ring in the next\n\nlet us all hope for Love.\n\nBecause Love changes everything\n\nFarah and the 'K' factor\n\nIt could happen to any one, but that it happened to one of filmdom's funniest women, adds to its hilarity. Apparently, along with top cop MN Singh, author and columnist Shobhaa De, the third panelist invited to launch Sheela Raval's book on Tuesday was none other than our friend, the director Farah Khan.\n\nFarah Khan\n\n\"By error she received a message from the hosts that it was near BKC instead of the BMC,\" said a source. \"After many urgent calls and frantic searching on her part, when the mistake had been revealed, Khan who was prepared to make the crazy dash into town, was advised not to as the affair would have long been over by the time she arrived.\" Obviously 'K' s are not fortuitous for all film folk.\n\nThe Subbi charm\n\nWay before parties became the currency of social clout and political heft, Dr Subbarami Reddy had perfected the art.\n\nPinky Reddy, Manish Malhotra, Nitasha Nanda, a friend and Rina Dhaka\n\nIn Delhi or in Mumbai, Hyderabad or Goa, Reddy's earthy charm and endearing braggadocio ensured a stellar guest list at his bashes.\n\nSania Mirza and Sadia Dehlvi\n\nAnd going by his recent Delhi celebration for Sania Mirza, the uber host has not lost his touch. Shatrughan Sinha, Manish Malhotra, Rina Dhaka, Nitasha Nanda and many more joined hosts Subbarami and Indra, and daughter Pinky and Sanjay Reddy in the festivities.\n\nIn God we trust\n\nEvery now and then, stories of wealthy and powerful individuals who seek solace in religion and spirituality emerge. After all, life's blows and uncertainties afflict everyone, the high and the low. But even so, the recent spiritual engagement of an NRI biz man, whose India projects have run into considerable set backs has been a point of comment.\n\n\"These days he spends a lot of time with this spiritual order,\" said a woman known to the industrialist, naming a world wide spiritual organisation. \"His stunning weight loss and calmer persona is all due to this.\" And perhaps old bug bears which scuttled his plans are in check, given the new economic climate at the Centre?"
