        "text": "Sitting idle is a waste of time.\n\nWhite lettered on a red board, like a soft but stern warning. I read this at the Indian Coffee House at Connaught Place a few years ago.\n\nIt is during my first year at Miranda House that my bouts of loitering in the city begins, spent on the regular chai-sutta routines, and quiet apathy for all that institutional education has to offer. A chasm had then opened up between the world at large, and I, who was pining over a girl, an old “friend”. All of feminist, queer theories, academic jargons that armed the young women around was wasted at my end. It was here that I had first read Ismat Chughtai’s Lihaaf in its english translation but even the thrill of such reading was short-lived with the discussions that followed around Begum’s loneliness. My loneliness was flung out open into the streets of the city not wanting to be discussed, or looked at by self-serving theorists. The public life of a city anoints one of a secrecy that a private, or closed quarter often fails at. Or so I liked to believe then.\n\nThe Coffee House had everyone you could imagine in a place like it, old men reading newspapers and discussing work, and young couples and friends latched onto each other and laughing at the sight of the monkeys that are very much ‘the regulars’.\n\nI once remember seeing a young boy, in a sweater at the one end of the terrace, sketching fervently on a diary as he looked across at half of the vast CP Circle. I stole a look at the rough dark etchings stuttering onto the paper from a carefully held pencil in his hand and learnt that he wasn’t as much as trying to put together the whole view on paper, vast as it was — but just enough to remember it by. Just a few details that caught his eyes.\n\nOn one another visit, I had met an old man here, a human radio! — he had a radio strapped to his chest beneath his shirt and when someone looked at him, he unbuttoned it for show and revelled in his own ingenuity. He went around talking to anyone and everyone. Apparently he had studied science but now was an astrologer. Picking out a book on Learn Spanish, he mentioned how he knew many other languages as well. But it seemed none was sufficient to communicate his loneliness. I was repulsed by him at first, unwanting of any conversation as he reminded me of a future self but we ended up talking at length and I have since always been looking for him whenever I have visited.\n\nI’m now amazed by such incidents; of how a place can be enmeshed into some significant part of collective history while also emerging as an entirely new isolated experience, a memory with or without some relevance for individuals who have inhabited it since.\n\nThe past few months of being locked down at home, spurred into an isolation both by the pandemic and the work crisis that followed, I have longed and revisited parts of Delhi solely based on such personal memories and memoirs of those who had something to do with it.\n\nThis is how I came across the story, ‘Dilli ki Sair’, a short story written in Urdu by Rashid Jehan in 1932.\n\nThe heart of the story lies in a character named, Mallika Begum, a woman on a day’s visit to New Delhi from Faridabad with her husband, who leaves her at the railway station and saunters off with a friend. Malika Begum is now recounting her harrowing story to a group of young women in Faridabad who are amazed and entertained by this unusual adventure that most of the women there weren’t privy to at the time. The story, short and crisp, and located entirely in the railway station, talks of male gaze and the experience of a young woman in burqa sitting atop her luggage as she sees the city (well, the railway station) with a great sense of humour and horror. Ofcourse, Rashid Jehan was criticized and terrorised for how she wrote and how she lived. Being a self-proclaimed, Communist, wearing a saree with sleeveless blouse and parading in the city, helping set up medical camps for poor women and promoting literacy, she challenged both the police and the policing.\n\nHaving said all of that, class, caste and gender problems continue to be grappled with in these spaces as they do in the larger feminist conversations. So even when we say women, we need to ask who are these women? And where do they come from? And what do we mean when we say women?\n\nAt this point, you may think I will admit to being ashamed of taking my access to education for granted and loitering in the streets but if I do it would be a lie. For me, it was the best of the times, even while I was brooding, to have become so intimate with the city and its ways, to be walking so.. purposelessly. It was refreshing to have a newfound form of comfort.\n\nIn this book called Flaneuse, by Laura Elkin, that I read years later after my unwaning interest in loitering, I come across this paragraph:\n\n“Sometimes I walk because I have things on my mind, and walking helps me sort them out. Solvitur ambulando, as they say.\n\nAbove all, I walk because it confers — or restores — a feeling of placeness. The geographer Yi-Fu Tuan says a space becomes a place when through movement we invest it with meaning, when we see it as something to be perceived, apprehended, experienced.”\n\nSo this is what happened. Having felt so isolated among my peers, I ended up forging a relationship with the city that will grow into a long illicit affair. I first came to it not knowing anything of its history but investing it with my own meaning, own memories and narratives. A way to ground myself outside of a heartbreak.\n\nWe will now take a metro from the metro station VishwaVidyalaya, translated as literally the university, of Yellow line metro, and three stops later arrive at Chandni Chowk. The Delhi Metro deserves a special mention for enabling such access to the city for many, like me. The calm computerised voice of the woman who announces the stations to come and to go. The Ladies only compartment, the seats reserved for those who need it though obviously mostly filled by those who don’t. The all kinds of people we encounter here. The mercifully air conditioned compartment in Dilli ki Garmi. The somewhat heated and warm compartment in Dilli ki Sardi.\n\nThe door slides open at two ends, and the spell breaks as we enter into the weather the city offers up. The calm computerised voice of the woman says, Chandni Chowk.\n\nThe reason I often skipped a few classes to come to this place was because it was a little familiar as the only place I had ‘tourist-ed’ in with my father when we had first arrived in the city years ago. When he was my age, he’d also visited parts of it, with relatives here who have since moved away, as the place has fallen and how. Relatively new signs of McDonalds, Haldiram and other commercial glorified brands jut out of what’s still called Old Delhi, awkwardly. Even in the cramped spaces, nooks and crannies one would hear ‘Sabyachaachi’, a poorly copy of the sought after global Indian clothes’ brand name, Sabyasachi, being called out by the shopkeepers and vendors, ladened with lehengas and sarees, drawing attention and admiration of women who come here shopping often for weddings. It is the place you come to if you want to look like royalty even on discount and cheaply sought fabrics!\n\nWondering what Jehanara Begum would think of it, I turn in this time to read more about her and her life, or whatever little we know of it.\n\nJehanara Begum, the eldest daughter of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, is credited for the glory or at least what once was of Chandni Chowk. The architectural design and landscape of the place is reflective of her artistic sensibilities, and lack thereof of the rulers and owners who followed thereafter. They who didn’t or couldn’t maintain it.\n\nR.V. Smith, one of the most engaging of Delhi Historians and writers, wrote beautifully about Jehanara in an article, The Tale the Grass Tells. When I read of her devotion to her father Shahjahan, I can’t tell if I am amazed or worried about her. Shahjahan’s reputation as a ruler, and a man is ostensibly that of cruelty. After Aurangzeb came to power and ShahJahan was imprisoned, she too became a recluse. Growing increasingly spiritual, when she died she was buried near the revered saint, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, at the south of Nizamuddin Dargah. On the tomb that she had had built for herself in 1681. In Persian, it reads\n\n“Baghair subza na poshad kase mazar mara\n\nKi qabr posh ghariban hamin gayah bas-ast”\n\nwhich translated into English means, ‘Let naught cover my grave save the green grass, for grass will suffice as a covering for the lowly.’\n\nNow, centuries later, the place is frequented by male guardians with young women irrespective of religion, who appear to be ‘possessed’ (I suppose by patriarchal forces) and are mentally disturbed, in search of some cure. It is the age-old Madonna/Whore complex, or as I like to call it ‘Bigdi ya Bechari’ compartments women are shoved into by men, come together in a place to mourn the loss of being beyond such binaries or as wanting of freedom as those exercised by men.\n\nThe freedom exercised across the city in various buildings, phallic symbols reassuring male egos. A consistent example being that of Qutub Minar, at Mehrauli closely followed by various office buildings that compete in ugliness. In the same compound as Qutub Minar is Alai Minar, my personal favorite. A one-storied tower built by Alauddin Khilji, who intended it to be taller than Qutub Minar, as a Tower of military Victory. But he died, and the project was left as it is, to be now reflective of human vanity. It’s a staggeringly poignant reminder of how even the mightiest of us are only mortals. Memento Mori.\n\nBut I suppose, I am digressing.\n\nThere’s too much, yet always less that has been said and written about Chandni Chowk, and the rest of Old Delhi. It is inevitably the place you would come to first to learn about the city. A few minutes of walking will land you into Chawri Bazaar, which is now lined by traders and vendors of tiles, wedding cards and what-nots. During a documentary shoot, at the Hotel Naaz, my friend, Yusra points across the old decrepit building structures and draws my attention to its architectural design. It’s visible behind lines of criss crossing electric wires, which have time and again caused fires in this area. The designs are beautiful, and ignored except by the local history enthusiasts and tourists, who excitedly photograph cows and people at the same breath, in every lane.\n\nThese broken columns are on what rests the memory of a place once thronged by the famous Tawaifs of Delhi. The Kothas in Chawri Bazaar are now invoked in heritage walks led by various historians and groups, in a great effort to elaborate upon the music and dance culture of the Tawaifs, and detach the connotations of ‘prostitution’ that have often been attached to it.\n\nG.B. Road, a few minutes away from here is what is also called, The Red Light Area, lined with shops and brothels. Now, infamous for incidents of trafficking, it is also considered to have emerged from what was once the Tawaif Culture of Chawri Bazaar. It is strange how what is celebrated, and valued, and what is criminalised or marginalised perhaps are not so distinct from one another. The sex-workers here too draw attention of journalists, researchers, social workers and artists but the very nature of work comes with horrors of human trafficking at one end and casual discrimination and exploitation by the State and society at another. Not even under disguise is the complicity of the privileged men who come and go here as clients, often abusers, rapists and what not, protected by the Police. In pandemic, there are only a few articles that continue to show the worsening plight of the workers here, and the work of the few NGOs.\n\nIn Chawri Bazaar, I learn of a Tawaif, Mubarak Begum — who has a mosque built on her name, by her husband David Ochterlony in the early 19th century. Apparently, the mosque was once informally called Randi ki Masjid. At a time when the word itself loosely translated to refer to divas of the city, dancers and musicians and artists, it did seem natural for the mosque to be informally referred as such. But since then, it has come to mean a ‘prostitute’, a word of supposed insult thrown at women, and so the mosque has tried to re-instill it’s respectability by being referred to only as Masjid Mubarak Begum.\n\nI recently came across an article online by Nirupama Dutt that reads,\n\nThe house was full of art, poetry and memories. There was the Harshingar tree that the two had planted together, the bougainvilleas that trailed into windows, the painted dining table, portrait after portrait of Amrita by Imroze, her poems written out by him on lampshades, pen stands, clocks and what not.\n\nShe is talking of K-25, at Hauz Khas — home to poet, Amrita Pritam, and Imroze. It was demolished and sold a few years ago, soon after her passing in 2011 despite the laments of many, for the memory of her to be honored, it was after all her home. Not her husband’s. Not her father’s. Her own.\n\nBut now only a ghost of it remains. Perhaps not even that. It’s a shame if you come to think of how some of the writers’ homes across the world, have been memorialised and so remained as an integral a part of a city’s memory, a nation’s memory. At a time especially like now, we could remember and learn from who Amrita Pritam was and what she wrote,\n\nToday, I call Waris Shah, “Speak from your grave,”\n\nAnd turn to the next page in your book of love,\n\nOnce, a daughter of Punjab cried and you wrote an entire saga,\n\nToday, a million daughters cry out to you, Waris Shah,\n\nRise! O’ narrator of the grieving! Look at your Punjab,\n\nToday, fields are lined with corpses, and blood fills the Chenab.\n\nThese lines from ‘Ajj Aankhaan Waris Shah’ Nu invoked the tragedy of Partition of India in 1947, and since, the always rising and passing of communal tensions, wounds across and within borders. These lines continue to remain relevant at a time when one is to think of the recent horror of the Delhi Riots in 2020.\n\nI didn’t learn or care to learn of K-25, Hauz Khas as a place where Amrita Pritam lived and loved, and wrote — a revelation that would have meant something to a young woman like me at a time when I was between throes of young love, and causeless rebellion. Years since, I now read Amrita Pritam, at my mother’s insistence, at home, through lockdown — her stories simple yet always reaching and I imagine myself having the chance to have visited her once, known where to reach her, known better. But I can’t, not anymore. Except in words. Except in poetry.\n\nBut of course, even now women are often made to remain as ghostly a memory or only living, lingering shadows in a city like Delhi. It takes a crisis for it to remember about women, forget accessibility when you are consistently dealing with violence, policing and surveillance — for safety!\n\nThe recent of the tragedies of the government insensitivity is that of the news around shaming and naming the metro station at Noida first as She-Man. After a widespread protest and criticism that it received, it has since been renamed as Rainbow Station. Made with the intention to provide job opportunities to transwomen communities who have been consistently neglected and abused by our society, its people, it is commendable but I wonder what it does to our ideas around inclusion. As much as there remains reserved women cabins in metros, and buses — there is always the nagging question of ‘what else?’, to be asked. It’s not much, a throw in policy here or a small initiative there to help tackle such large problems that remain of continuous violence faced by those marginalised, by gender, caste and class in a capital city, on a daily basis.\n\nIn a book, Myself, Mona Ahmad photographed and brought together by a friendship that emerged between Mona Ahmad, and Dayanita Singh we are to learn of the largeness of Mona Ahmad’s life. Who is Mona Ahmad? She first caught attention of the audience in West, and even for those in India for her eunuch-ness — being from the hijra community, that which was also lost to her over time as she found herself living in an old cemetery in Delhi. The book says so much that what I say would only be reductive. But since I came across photographs and so the story of Mona Ahmad, who lived and struggled in this city, I could never easily separate the two for some reason. Mona Ahmad continues to be integral to my memory of this city, and so does the photographer Dayanita Singh.\n\nIn my walking around the city with the ghosts, memories of those before and beside me to keep me company, I have written not as much as photographed in order to remember everything, I think; which is also why Dayanita Singh and her work continues to hold my attention and admiration. And then so does, of the one who came before her. who shaped literally the image of this nation — Homai Vyarawalla. My professor, Sabeena Gadihoke, documented and curated much of Homai Vyarawalla’s work, and has always reintroduced it to the generations after, including in our classes; the utmost importance and need of which can’t be more iterated.\n\nWhile Vyarawalla photographed more intimately her time, and people so to say in Bombay, where she at first started working — she was called to Delhi soon, in 1942, to work for British Information Services. She was a strange sight, a woman with a camera doing extraordinarily well. Her photographs of Nehru, at what could be called as a period of “nation-building” remain remarkable moments of history captured by its best. She always insisted she was just doing her job, refusing to romantically talk of her profession.\n\n“Somehow it never occurred to me that I was doing something unusual or that I was the only woman in a male-dominated profession at that time. I think I was casual in my dressing and unobtrusive in my demeanour, so this may have made people around me feel at ease. I was always given due credit for my work and was respected just as any other competent person in the field. At school, I was the only girl in my matriculation class. So I was used to being in the company of boys.”\n\nHomai Vyarawalla, speaking to The Hindu\n\nCalled as Dalda 13, or Mummy by her colleagues, in her saree parading in the city, photographing such crucial moments in history, Homai Vyarawalla is not only a woman to be thought of in Delhi today but even in the country at large for the vast diverse range of important work she did for years.\n\nSo we come at where we started, through a long senseless, distracting, confusing but hopefully, intriguing walk in memory, imagination and geography of the city I have come to call home. The reason I wrote of these women and what the city does or doesn’t do is honestly, not only to contemplate, but also remember because it’s so easy to forget at times that we exist as we struggle in this city.\n\nRemember that we were here. We saw. We wrote. We photographed. We built this city. And so we belong to it, and it belongs to us. All of us.\n\nAnd also, selfishly maybe, to remember that I am here, I was here.\n\nAlso to know that there is a long way to go in gender equality and that that the class, caste and gender are intertwined together always and yet to hope, hopelessly again and more, to think of it, and dream of it, and make of it — this recognition into a city that Delhi is in the imagination and works of those before us and among us even today.\n\nIt is these women I would think of when my heart breaks, as it has before — be it for a person or an entire nation. It is these women, I’d take a walk with."
