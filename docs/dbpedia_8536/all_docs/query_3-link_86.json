        "text": "The nameless white marble-top grave on his first visit did not seem very different from the thousands of others that dot the capital. Years later in 2016, when a writer called him looking for a photograph of a “grave or tomb” for an upcoming book, he revisited the grave (among many others).\n\nIt was the season of “dengue and chikungunya”. Steady raindrops were crashing onto the marble floor. On top was a small, faded rose slowly unfolding and, in a corner, an obscure dead fly.\n\nFrom among the hundreds he shot, a photograph of this grave would go on to feature on the cover of an international bestseller by Arundhati Roy – The Ministry Of Utmost Happiness. The photographer (also a writer), Mayank Austen Soofi aka The Delhi Walla, a self-proclaimed “hyperlocal”, had suddenly gone global. But Soofi insists he prefers the former.\n\nHe has not told anyone, not even Roy, the exact location of the grave. “The book is very special to me. So, this is a thing of mystery that I want to keep for myself,” says he 38-year old.\n\nWhile this may be a city secret he wants to keep, his blog, The Delhi Walla, reveals many more. With 2,748 posts (plus over 19,500 images on Instagram), it features the Delhi you should see, the Delhi that you never see, the Delhi that lies forgotten and sometimes even the Delhi that will come to be. While he prefers to be known as a writer, in essence Soofi is a biographer: a city biographer who’s spent over a decade (he began his blog in 2006) on Delhi’s streets and inside homes, marrying its rich history with its lived reality. The blog has sections on monuments, cuisines, traditions, walks, parties and even obituaries. There are extraordinary stories of ordinary people and ordinary stories of extraordinary people. The late Khushwant Singh said of Soofi (for the blurb of his alternative guidebooks, published in 2010), “[He] has the knack of bringing out the unusual from the usual.” It’s this ability that makes the Delhi Walla special.\n\nSoofi’s written about people he met on the streets like Ram Chander Bhakt, a Bihari autorickshaw driver who is also a prolific poet (once published); Abdul Sattar, an elderly scholar in possession of a rare copy of the Bible in Urdu by a Pakistani publisher; and Asha Sood, an American who returned after years to look for her post-Partition home in old Delhi. He’s also written about familiar names – William Dalrymple’s glorious library, housed in a Delhi farmhouse; exclusive soirées featuring MPs, ambassadors and film actors organised by society hostess Ratan Kaul; the drawing-room birthday concert of author Sadia Dehlvi’s son.\n\n“The stories on the blog are of Delhi but I don’t think they are only about Delhi. They’re about life in a big city. I’m trying to capture fleeting moments, the changing time,” Soofi says, over a double espresso shot at a Starbucks outlet in central Delhi’s Connaught Place. On one side of CP lies the old walled city, the capital of the Mughal empire under Shah Jahan. On the other is Lutyens’ Delhi, the seat of power under the British, and now. Through it all runs the Delhi Metro, one of modern India’s celebrated achievements.\n\nIt’s this intersection of a vanishing and advancing world that Soofi finds exciting. “I’m fortunate to live here, where in a single day I move through so many planets. There are so many layers and things bubbling out through the fissures.” And yet, incongruously, he adds, “People by default think that I love Delhi. I don’t. If I lived somewhere else, I would do the same.”\n\nMayank Singh was born in Nainital and grew up in small towns all over Uttar Pradesh. His father was an engineer in the public works department, with a transferable job. After school, he unsuccessfully tried to get a diploma in hospitality. It was after three years of unemployment that he decided to come to the capital to try his luck, like thousands of other migrants.\n\n“I was so nervous but also thrilled to be in a big city. At the time, it was the biggest city I’d been to. I thought I was just a small-town guy. Back then, I didn’t know the city was made of so many small-town guys,” he recalls, of the day his train from Bareilly pulled into the old Delhi railway station.\n\nThe first few months were exacting. Searching for a job meant walking around the city, knocking on doors that never seemed to open and exhausted evenings at Central Park in CP, alongside hundreds of other dreamers. The job he did find was that of a waiter at the Radisson Blu hotel in a south-west suburb of Delhi. Living in a slum behind the hotel, he worked farmhouse parties till 2am and was back on shift at 7am.\n\n“My life was miserable. I used to be in awe of posh people and places like the hotel,” he says, adding that even McDonald’s seemed intimidating at the time.\n\nAt one point, he recalls being almost suicidal. During one of his frequent walks around CP, he saw a sign for a book shop assistant and walked in. The owner spoke to him politely, promising to get back. Though he never called, the possibility pulled him out of the dark space he was in.\n\nBesides the waiter’s job, he’d also attempted three blogs (Pakistan Paindabad, Reading Arundhati Roy, Ruined By Reading) and briefly worked with the team that wrote questions for Kaun Banega Crorepati. But he credits his personal and professional turnaround to two chance encounters.\n\nOne Sunday morning, he found a tattered copy of Jane Austen’s iconic Pride And Prejudice at the second-hand book market in Daryaganj. A voracious reader, he remembers devouring it. “I didn’t know anything about the book. I’d only heard of the author when my sister was doing her graduation course. I read it like a virgin having sex for the first time,” he laughs. Austen’s worldview would go on to be a constant inspiration in both seeking and writing about Delhi society.\n\nThe second was wandering around Nizamuddin, which houses the mausoleum of renowned Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Every Thursday evening, amid the neon lights, incense-rich air and frenzied disciples, a special qawwali performance attracts tourists, followers and non-believers alike. On one such evening, he lost his virginity for a second time. The heightened sensory experience moved him so much that he wrote his first post on a new blog that night – “How I Got Drunk And Lost My Virginity At Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah”. He wrote:\n\nI became the universe, the marble, the dust, the sky, the star, and the raindrop.\n\nalimaulalaimaulaalimaula\n\nalimaulalaimaulaalimaula\n\nFinally, it all ended. I came back. Spent and tired, it was time to leave.\n\nAnd that is how Mayank Singh became Mayank Austen Soofi aka The Delhi Walla.\n\nThe initial photographs on the blog are grainy and uncomposed. While the quality of images has improved over time with the use of an iPhone 6 (and a DSLR for indoor shoots), they’re still taken on the go, and not heavily edited. The writing has stayed in the initial element: short, staccato sentences that are rich in descriptive detail. The prose attempts to sing, but is not always poetic. And while some of the entries can lack craft, there’s no dearth of emotion. “Local stories are always the most interesting. I focus on what you will see, what you will feel, what you will experience. No one cares about the measurements of some pillar,” Soofi says with a laugh.\n\nThere are inevitable comparisons with other city bloggers or writers, but this is something Soofi resists, the only exception being celebrated New York Times fashion photographer Bill Cunningham, with whom he believes he shares a similar approach. “I worship him – he had an eye for real beauty. He went around town on a cycle, led a simple life, lived alone and photographed high-society galas but wouldn’t eat there.”\n\nExploring the nuances of upper-class life has been a recurring theme in Soofi’s work, inspired not only by Austen but also French novelist Marcel Proust. “I see the world through the books I read,” he says. Among Indian authors, Arundhati Roy is a favourite. He was so taken with The God Of Small Things that for years he had a blog dedicated to images of people holding the book. “It’s difficult for me to get into new writers. I find it easier to go back to the same writers and books. They become like an old pair of jeans you can’t rid yourself of.”\n\nThe influence of literature is easily discernible in his work: His eye sees and almost instantaneously locates people and spaces in the literary landscape of his imagination. The captions accompanying his photographs and the titles of posts are either derived from, or explicitly reference, books and characters from the novels he’s read. A night-time image of a rickshaw-puller relaxing in his rickshaw is labelled “The Exhausted Remains of a Rickshaw Puller’s Day” (playing on the title of Kazuo Ishiguro’s book The Remains Of The Day).\n\nHowever, this approach can run the risk of romanticising poverty. Soofi disagrees. “I am not in a moral dilemma. I capture something when I feel moved by it. It’s important to be respectful, but I don’t claim to be giving a voice to them.” He adds, after a pause, “I don’t try and mediate in their lives. I’m not trying to change the world.”\n\nWhile the streets of Delhi might be his lair, Soofi has also managed to access the echelons of Delhi’s intellectual elite. Curious, I ask how he accomplishes that. “One of the first well-known people I interviewed was environmentalist Pradip Krishen, when my blog was still new. I emailed him at the address mentioned in his book, and he agreed to meet. Now, people have seen my work so are comfortable letting me in,” Soofi says. In a city that thrives on patronage, access is often determined by who you know. Dehlvi, for instance was first introduced to him by a common friend.\n\nWhat matters, however, is the intention, he says. “I’m not interested in exposing their lives or secrets. And there are elements that unite the two worlds. Still, it’s definitely easier to talk to someone on the road than someone in Golf Links, but I try to write about both in the same way, which is why it works.”\n\nOnce the Delhi Walla began to get noticed, writing offers materialised. Soofi’s first gig was for Outlook magazine’s supplement, City Limits. The next offer came soon after, from the Hindustan Times Delhi city supplement, where he spent several years. A set of four quirky guidebooks on Delhi published by HarperCollins and a non-fiction book on the city’s red-light area followed. After a stint at Mint Lounge, where he had a weekly column, Hindustan Times offered him a daily column in the main newspaper last year.\n\nSoofi’s column did so well that in June this year, the paper asked him to cover the satellite city of Gurugram as well. “People think of Gurugram as a soulless place full of malls and high-rises. But each flat in that high-rise is like a city, full of people, their feelings, their histories. It’s also a place where people come to work, including from Delhi, so no place can be soulless,” he says.\n\nSo far, he’s written about the impossibility of dreaming for a migrant housekeeper working in a plush Gurugram office, a 150-year-old church reminiscent of rural England and Mangar Bani, the last patch of forest green between Delhi and Gurugram.\n\nBut a daily column has its own pressures. “I still feel nervous every day: What if I don’t find a story today? But that’s never happened,” he says with relief. Through all these jobs, Soofi’s maintained his humble WordPress blog. And with the advent of social media, he now tweets, updates Facebook and posts several times a day on Instagram.\n\nAn early riser, Soofi wakes up around 6:30am, mostly at his parents’ house in a middle-class neighbourhood in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of Delhi. The metro brings him into CP, where he spends his morning reading at a Starbucks outlet. He also writes the first drafts of his pieces on his phone. After a couple of hours at the office, he’s out in the city. He claims he doesn’t plan his day, and when he gets up to walk, he does so in whichever direction he fancies.\n\nOn a dry, hot June day, I follow Soofi around after he leaves the office. He’s wearing a cotton shirt and trousers with a pair of well-worn Woodland shoes. In hand is a fat copy of William Trevor’s collected stories, and in his backpack a bound edition of Emily Dickinson’s poetry in Italian and English. His lean frame is topped with a silver-grey head.\n\nHe walks with the easy grace of a man at home in the world. Unhurried yet ever alert. Curious but not intrusive. He photographs a man writing in a notebook sitting on a broken divider, sprints behind a woman with very long hair walking into a bookstore and takes a picture almost every time he spots a staircase. The phone dips in and out of his pocket. The heavy book goes between the legs.\n\nFrom CP we walk towards Paharganj, near the railway station, known for cheap tourist hostels and rooftop cafés. He laughs, “Whenever I hated Delhi, I’d come to Paharganj, which gave me a sense of freedom. A world full of touts, guides, foreigners in hippie clothes and dreadlocks.” Chelmsford Road, which leads to Paharganj, is a personal favourite, he reveals, with bougainvillea in bloom, a beautiful mosque and white walls.\n\nA rickshaw-puller watching Soofi click photos approaches him with a Hindi printout. He has several more in a ragged plastic bag tucked under the passenger seat. Soofi is immediately intrigued, and takes notes on his phone as they converse. The encounter lasts only a few minutes, and after saving his phone number, he has his next story. “This man reminds me of Dr Azad Bhartiya from The Ministry Of Utmost Happiness, who had his own newsletter. This man too had taken printouts of his who cared to listen,” Soofi tells me.\n\nIn the lanes of Paharganj, several shops have framed Soofi’s stories about them on their walls. As he stops to greet some of the owners, I ask if he has close friends. After a brief pause, he says, “I’m friendly with a lot of people. And I meet new people every day.”\n\nFrom Paharganj we head to Nizamuddin, which he visits daily without fail. After a quick stopover in the neighbourhood’s more tony residential area at Dehlvi’s home, where he often spends time, we cross the road to the dargah. With the pride and ease of a regular, he navigates us deftly through a way used only by the locals. An invalid man, a young boy, a bearded man praying with beads greet him with polite salaams and warm handshakes. Inside the dargah, he heads straight for the inner sanctum of the mausoleum for a quick prayer. Next, we climb up on a tiny roof as darkness falls and the sound of the qawwali fills the air. He FaceTimes a friend abroad to show him the stunning sight in front of us.\n\nWhen we walk out, a beggar Soofi greets, shouts to him asking for an invite to his wedding so he can eat korma. “Colleagues often ask me to bring them here, but I don’t like to. Here my friends are from a different world, and by bringing others, I don’t want them to feel uncomfortable,” he tells me.\n\nI ask if he feels jaded or bored walking the same paths every day. He shakes his head. “I look at the city as if I don’t live here. What if I were never to see it again? It’s not just the people or monuments that make it up, it’s also the trees, the animals, the food.”\n\nImpressed with Soofi’s distinct form of work, photographer Dayanita Singh has described it as something “between literature and photography, between documentary and fiction,” calling him the “archivist of Delhi.” He says he can never stop doing this work, calling the blog a “never-ending stream”. On the cards is an eponymous digital archive so that all his images and stories can be made easily accessible to a larger audience.Building an archive of a city that changes form constantly is both easy and impossible. “After 20 years, when people wonder how life was, I hope they can see or sense it through my work,” says Soofi. “It can help us understand how we become what we become, in both good ways and bad… But I don’t want my work to be seen as being homesick for the past. It is, ultimately, about life in the present.”\n\nNOW READ\n\nRana Dasgupta on what the JCB Prize could do for Indian literature\n\nWhy is Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan’s birthday celebrated as Teachers Day?\n\nMeet the most important Indian-American in Trump’s inner circle"
