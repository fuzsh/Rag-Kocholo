        "text": "THE first Mail Today Culture Conclave on Saturday saw a spirited discussion between proponents of divergent visions of Indian nationalism. While some laid emphasis on \"composite culture\", others underscored \"cultural ethos\".\n\n\"The churn we are facing today is civilisational, reorienting India back to its moorings after a secularist interlude,\" said professor Makarand Paranjape of Jawaharlal Nehru University's English department.\n\n\"India is not a secular country in the sense in which the church and the state were separated in Europe. It is rather a very 'Dharmic' country. Of course one idea of nationalism has the danger to be a hegemonic idea, but this turning back to our moorings is healthy as, secularism as it has come to understood today does not represent the mainstream of India. Secularism has itself become a form of communalism.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\n'TEXTURED SPIRITUALITY'\n\nThe conversation came against the backdrop of opposition parties and activists accusing the BJP government of trying to turn multi-faith India into a Hindu nation and painting detractors as \"anti-nationals\". \"I agree that India is a religious nation and we must all accept it. But it is a textured spirituality; it has been a very inclusive spirituality,\" said activist and writer Sadia Dehlvi.\n\nShe referred to the Sufi traditions of Indian history and said there had always been a very healthy interaction between the different cultural strains in the country. But Dehlvi also maintained that such a way of life is under attack in today's India and that she is very afraid to dissent.\n\n\"The tolerance that marks the Ganga-Jamuni culture of India is on the wane. Any dissent is taken such offence at from social media to otherwise; people say 'you go to Pakistan', etc. But, why should I go? I am called Dehlvi precisely as I have an ancestry rooted in Delhi for the past 400 years. They are all buried here,\" she said.\n\nINDIA MOST TOLERANT COUNTRY I'VE VISITED, SAYS US-BORN VEDIC SCHOLAR DAVID FRAWLEY\n\nPitching in, US-born Vedic teacher and author David Frawley pointed at the political situation across the world and in India's neighbouring countries, terming India the most \"tolerant\" country that he has visited.\n\n\"Unlike Europe, etc, India is the most tolerant country in the world. Also, the minority -majority question in India must be seen in the international context. Hindus may be a majority in India, but they are a minority in the global sense,\" he said.\n\nResponding to the claim by Dehlvi that minorities had been left behind in India, Frawley said that in India, in the name of secularism, \"the majority has been left behind in so many ways\". Professor Paranjape argued that certain aspects of Indian history, pertaining to Muslims being invaders and the atrocities committed by the Muslim rulers on Hindus, need to be exposed and not glossed over.\n\nPavan Varma, former IFS officer and ex-adviser to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, accepted Paranjape's point, but recommended a way out based on the recognition of India's composite culture.\n\nALSO READ | Anti-nationalism in the name of freedom of speech on the rise: Wrestler Yogeshwar to India Today\n\nAfter Jamia, RSS-backed forum takes nationalism, triple talaq debate to AMU, Hyderabad University"
