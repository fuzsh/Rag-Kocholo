It is populated largely by immigrants who are too busy getting ahead to notice the city or to make room for anyone. It is a city that forces its association on you and overwhelms you with a shameless brio...",

        "text": "Thomas Trautamnn, in his pioneering work, Languages and Nations: The Dravidian Proof in Colonial Madras (2006) demonstrated that the astounding ling-uistic discovery of familial relations between languages-the formulation of the Indo-Euro-pean and Dravidian families of languages -was an outcome of the interaction between western orientalists and indigenous Indian scholarship…\n\nThis is a fascinating memoir and it is indeed commendable that Sikata Banerjee has chosen to translate this text which, until now, was only available to the Bengali reading public.Saraladebi Chaudhu-rani, the niece of Rabindranath Tagore,…\n\nANITA Desai’s latest novel Fire on the Mountain is a distinct let-down. It has many of the qualities that marked her first book, Cry, the Peacock; spare­ness, toughness and fine descriptive writing. But while Cry, the Peacock came off, Fire on the Mountain does not; perhaps because, trying the same trick once too often, Anita Desai achieves sensationalism instead of shock…\n\nThe latest offering from the indefatigable Joep Bor and his learned colleagues, this modestly titled volume should really have been called Companion to Hindustani Music. There are 25 essays cove-ring eight centuries from the thirteenth to the twentieth…\n\nIn 1988, I had just been appointed the Chairman of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, and had finished chairing the first meeting of my Governing Council, when I was approached by a frail figure, grey-haired and bearded, clad, if I remember correctly, in saffron…\n\nThe recent exhibitions in Delhi and Mumbai of the works of painters Amrit and Rabindra, popularly known as the Singh Twins, drew in many accolades especially for ‘taking Indian miniatures to a completely new level’ because of their ‘reflec-tions on contemporary life…\n\nThe stories included in this Anthology of Modem Bengali Short Stories, sel­ected and translated by Enakshi Chatter­jee, range from ‘The Music Room’ by Tara Shankar Banerjee, published in 1934, to Kabita Sinha’s ‘The Strange Island’ and Baren Gangopadhyay’s ‘The Hand’, both published in 1966…\n\nThis is a provocative and refreshing book on the condition of the working class under globalization with special reference to India. If there is one thing that comes to mind after reading this book it is the last few words of the Communist Manifesto: ‘Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains’…\n\nAs the world struggles to emerge from the economic crisis, the links between business and government are increa-singly relevant. Political analysts from the United States and Britain to India and China are increasingly focusing on the ways that corporate interests influence, even control, public policy…\n\nThe book written by Kaushik Roy offers an interesting take on the development of the Armed Forces as an institution, its nature and purposes and the formulation of theories as regards its functions. Not much has been written about India’s military post-Independence despite…\n\nWe have seen Bengalis assembled on various occasions of danger, distress and sorrow, such as that of the Partition – Mohun Bagan has infused a new life intro the lifeless and cheerless Bengali – By your victory sport has been turned into a unifying force -(Basumati, 5 August 1911)…\n\nThe eminent historian Irfan Habib’s The National Movement: Studies in Ideology and History, seeks to grapple again with the classic question of the rela-tionship of socialist thought and nationalism. The first two of the five essays in the volume are centred on Gandhi…\n\nNorth East India is mostly written about in connection with the politics of space and identity. Here is another one dealing with the same subject. But Sanghamitra Misra’s work is a book with a difference. The difference is mostly due to its treatment of the subject and also the space in which the study is located…\n\nTwo young men barely fifteen are seated on upholstered chairs, one resting his arm over an ornate, marbled topped table, while the other has his arm over the chair handle. The one seated next to the table has worn a long coat; all buttoned up, dhoti, a cap, while his friend…\n\nA visitor from Mars in the sixteenth century, Marshall Hodgson used to say, might well have identified the wide network of ‘Islamicate’ societies as the most dynamic and dominant, politically and cul-turally, of all the civilizations on Planet Earth…\n\nThe slimness of this book is its first surprise, seeming almost at odds with the weighty title. As Judith Brown states in the Introduction, the aim was to reach a wide audience ‘at university level and even among school students’, as also readers ‘who may know little about India but wish to know more about such a significant and intriguing figure’ as Gandhi…\n\nThe stories included in this Anthology of Modem Bengali Short Stories, sel­ected and translated by Enakshi Chatter­jee, range from ‘The Music Room’ by Tara Shankar Banerjee, published in 1934, to Kabita Sinha’s ‘The Strange Island’ and Baren Gangopadhyay’s ‘The Hand’, both published in 1966…\n\nWhen Indu Jain published her first collection of poems, titled 64 Poems, I had reviewed it in Hindi and remember to have said that she is a new poetess with promise.
