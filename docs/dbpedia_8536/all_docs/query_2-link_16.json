        "text": "When Allah sent Adam and Eve to Earth, He promised that humanity would never be without guidance. Divine scriptures provide a network of channels. If we follow them, our lives will flow smoothly, guarded and guided.\n\nI often visit the dargah of Sarmad Shaheed, the most famous majzub, intoxicated Sufi of India, on the steps of Jama Masjid.\n\nTonight is Shab-e-Miraj, the ascension of Prophet Muhammad to the Heavens. The event falls on the 27th night of Rajab, the seventh month of the Islamic calendar, and is one of the most celebrated events in Muslim communities around the world. The night journey is a tale of love between Allah and Muhammad, his beloved.\n\nThere was disappointment in store for fans who lined up in the thousands outside the gates of the HPCA Stadium for the Mumbai Indians-Kings XI Punjab IPL clash here on Saturday.\n\nSonnet Club beat ONGC by three wickets in a closely fought semi-final of the Jubilant cricket tournament here on Saturday. Akash Yadav (65) anchored a tense 188-run chase for Sonnet Club in the company of Subodh Bhatti (40).\n\nRabia of Basra is the most famous woman in the history of Islamic mysticism. A lifelong celibate, her devotion to God was so complete that she is credited with enriching the philosophy of Sufism with the concept of divine love.\n\nThe essential name of God in Islam is “Allah”, which has no dictionary meaning. The Quran contains the other names of Allah known as the Asma ul Husna, and says, “The most beautiful names belong to Allah.” “Asma”, means name, and “husna” means beautiful.\n\nProphet Mohammed was born on a Monday, the night of 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal in the year 571 AD. The occasion is celebrated as “Eid Milad un Nabi” by remembering his life and teachings. The messenger is believed to have passed on to the other world on the same day."
