        "text": "Someone famous once said, ‘To build up a library is to create a life. It’s never just a random collection of books.’ Think about your own collection of books: carefully curated, sporadically bought, some you may have read several times while there must be a few which shall always remain on your ‘to-read’ list. Your personal library defines who you are. And so is the case with author Rakshanda Jalil and her home library. Watch as she takes us through her favourite books, and reveals to us Rakshanda the reader more than the author.Watch the video. Successful Indian born model, author and producer – Padma Lakshmi read from Love, Loss and What We Ate. A memoir in which she recounts her journey and the experiences that helped her to become the successful woman that she is today. The journey from the kitchens in her childhood to becoming a judge of one of the most popular cooking shows in the world, the author talks about it all. The book is an enlightening tale of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. She talks about her different stints in the modelling world, television, and life as a child. The book truly seems to come from the heart of the author.\n\nWatch the video here."
