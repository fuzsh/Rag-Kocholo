        "text": "By Firoz Bakht Ahmed*\n\n“You never said I’m leaving,\n\nYou never said, good bye,\n\nYou were gone before I knew it\n\nAnd only God knew, why!\n\nAll people die, but not all people live!”\n\nSadia lived! She packed so much life into her eventful six decades. She travelled, chased her dreams, worked in a profession she loved, fell in love, mended a broken heart and still put one foot in front of the other battling what she knew from the start, was an incurable cancer. She did so with grace, dignity, integrity and courage. Even during her utter weakness and painful moments, she had the heart to laugh at her lovely foibles.\n\nSadia Dehlvi -- the woman, the myth, the legend that she was -- men wanted to be with her, women wanted to be with her and abive all, the kids wanted to be with her! In the passing away of Sadia Dehlvi, a Muslim woman of much capability and prominence of the past 60 years, an era is finished, the era of a vibrant, vivacious and valorous Delhi’ite, the keeper of the heritage and sainthood of Delhi. She was proud of the well-cemented inter-faith concord as believed that the soul of India is inclusive, pluralistic, and democratic.\n\nOnce when someone asked about Sadia’s illness some time ago, despite in agony, she was able to have gala time when she stated, “One of the few advantages of dying from Grade 3, Stage IIIC endometrial cancer, recurrent and metastasized to the liver and abdomen, is that you have time to write your own obituary. (The other advantages are no longer bothering with sunscreen and no longer worrying about your cholesterol.).”\n\nHaving seen her versatility and sharing the hobby of writing, I first wrote an article on her in the “Evening News” (a publication of “The Hindustan Times”, now closed) of July 19, 1988 on her project of uplifting the literacy levels of Muslim girls in the walled city of Delhi. Very early in her life, Sadia had also started making films on social cause with “Amma and Family” in 1995, with Zohra Sehgal being the most popular one. Even her television series in 2001, “Zindgi Kitni Khoobsurat Hei”, she acted as the lead.\n\nI have known Sadia, since my childhood, as her father, Yunus Dehlvi, and two uncles, Idrees Dehlvi and Ilyas Dehlvi, all pillars of the best Urdu publications -- Shama, Sushma, Khilauna, Bano, Shabistan, Mujrim, Doshi and a whole lot of publications from Shama Book Depot and Khilauna Book Depot — were acquainted with me as I had often visited them in their office at Asaf Ali Road.\n\nIn her rather short time on this earth, Sadia’s journey was like a rock thrown into a lake; sending ripples ever outward into the future\n\nSadia must have spent a very colourful and royal life living it to the lees and fullest, yet, internally, she was a very spiritual and ecumenical soul. In her benchmark, “Sufism, The Heart of Islam,” she has focused on the fact that true Islam, that many have forgotten, has been about the Sufi way of life that joins lacerated hears and broken families.\n\nHer work, “The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi”, nicely laid out what in Urdu is known as, “Chaudah Khwaja ki Chaukhat” Rendouzvous of Fourteen Saints). Her book, “Jasmine and Jinns” is a hallmark on the life and times of the Shahjahanabadi walled city of Delhi.\n\nSadia’s unquestionable love for her family, especially her only son, her love of music, her life-long love of learning, her love of cuisine, her acceptance of everyone and refusal to judge or dismiss anyone, how much she enjoyed being with people, hearing and telling funny stories, I cannot stop hearing the sound of her laugh. The more I hear it, the harder I get impacted.\n\nI vouch, if ever there was a competition of best dishes, she would have won numerous times, with her inimitable purani dilli (old Delhi) dishes learnt from her mother and grandmother. Her pool parties were legendary. She could make killer cabbage rolls and mouth-watering and nostril-tickling shami kebabs.\n\nBeing the heart and soul of Delhi she loved the city’s variety of seasons. Delhi has distinct seasons, and once upon a time lifestyles revolved around the weather. I would hear stories of how shopkeepers pulled down their shutters when the first rains arrived and went to Mehrauli for picnics with their families.\n\nSpecial dishes were made in the monsoon like harimirch qeema chilly and minced meat, besani roti and fresh mango chutney. Nihari was always associated with winter, and was eaten “nihar muh” (early morning), that is on an empty stomach.

Your addiction doesn’t define you. She was a writer, a traveller, a columnist, an educationist, a social activist, a poet, a thinker and above all a never say die community worker. She loved music, and her friendships and family ignited the hearth that was her heart! However, without Sadia, Delhi will be poorer!\n\n---\n\nCommentator on social, cultural and educational issues, chancellor, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hydarabad\n\nBy Ram Puniyani* The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has significantly impacted the nation and contributed to a surge in fake news and Islamophobia in India. For the past fifteen years, Shaikh Hasina has governed Bangladesh with an iron fist, quelling opposition through imprisonment and house arrest of key opposition figures.\n\nBy Our Representative The Indian Muslims of North America (IMNA), an Indian diaspora group that had initially planned to organize a float for the New York City India Day parade on August 18, has withdrawn their participation from the parade due to “significant concern” over the event’s inclusion of a tableau celebrating the Ram Temple.\n\nBy Our Representative New York City (NYC) mayor Eric Adams has condemned the decision of the Indian Consulate of New York and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America (VHPA) , a U.S. offshoot of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), for planning what several diaspora human rights groups call an anti-Muslim float planned for this year’s upcoming NYC India day parade on August 18.\n\nBy Rajiv Shah* The other day, I was searching on Google a quote on Maha Shivratri which I wanted to send to someone, a confirmed Shiv Bhakt, quite close to me -- with an underlying message to act positively instead of being negative. On top of the search, I chanced upon an article in, imagine!, a Nashik Corporation site which offered me something very unusual.\n\nBy A Representative According to the Home Minister, Amit Shah, 250 security camps have been established in Bastar after 2019. There are camps roughly at a distance of every 2 or 5 km, turning Bastar into one vast cantonment. In February 2024, the IG Bastar announced 50 additional camps. This makes Bastar into one of the most militarised regions of the country with 1 security person to every 9 civilians.\n\nBy Shamsul Islam* First time in the history of independent India, the in-charge minister of the Cultural Ministry in the current Modi government, Prahlad Singh Patel, has glorified MS Golwalkar, second supremo of the RSS and the most prominent ideologue of the RSS till date, on his birth anniversary, February 19. In a tweet he wrote : “Remembering a great thinker, scholar, and remarkable leader #MSGolwalkar on his birth anniversary. His thoughts will remain a source of inspiration & continue to guide generations.”\n\nCounterview Desk In a strongly worded statement, the Ambedkar University Delhi Faculty Association (AUDFA), even as insisting on the need to protect the top public institution, has said that the university \"is now on the brink of collapse and fragmentation\", accusing the administration for operating \"with increasing impunity, subjecting faculty to harassment amid deteriorating working conditions.\"\n\nBy Bhaskar Sur* Swami Vivekananda now belongs more to the modern Hindu mythology than reality. It makes a daunting job to discover the real human being who knew unemployment, humiliation of losing a teaching job for 'incompetence', longed in vain for the bliss of a happy conjugal life only to suffer the consequent frustration.\n\nBy Deepika* Dog bites and Rabies Vaccines are in the news these days. Every other day there is a news report mentioning the death of a child following a dog bite despite the child being vaccinated against Rabies. The news reports erroneously and intentionally mention that the child died due to “Rabies” and do not question the role of the vaccines."
