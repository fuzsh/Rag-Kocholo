SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Kyle Korver has decided he will stay with the Utah Jazz at least one more season.

Korver had the option to stay with the Jazz for the final year of his contract or opt out and become a free agent this summer.

The Jazz said Monday that Korver’s agent told the team that Korver will stay in Utah for the final year of the contract. The reserve shooting guard is guaranteed $5.2 million next season.

Utah is still awaiting word from forward Carlos Boozer and center Mehmet Okur, who also have the option of voiding the final year of their contract.

The deadline to opt out of the deals is Tuesday. Okur’s agent said Monday his client was leaning toward opting out.
