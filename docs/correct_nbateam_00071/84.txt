The Cleveland Cavaliers have traded Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

Korver, one of the best long-distance shooters in NBA history, is going to the Jazz in exchange for guard Alec Burks and two future second-round draft picks.

Korver played for the Jazz from 2007-2010. He became expendable this season in Cleveland as the Cavs are in rebuilding mode after losing LeBron James as a free agent and are acquiring assets.

He joined the Cavs in 2017, coming over in a trade from Atlanta.
