        "text": "According to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Cavaliers have traded guard Kyle Korver to the Jazz for two second-round picks and guard Alec Burks.\n\nKorver was acquired by the Cavs during the 2017 season and is in the second year of a three-yer deal that he signed with the Cavs during the summer of 2017. Due to his veteran status and ability as a shooter, he was always considered a likely candidate to be traded. He’s also returning to a team he previously played for; Korver was with the Jazz for three seasons.\n\nIn Burks, the Cavs are acquiring a 27-year-old guard on a expiring deal worth $11.5 million. They also get two second-round picks — the Jazz’s 2020 pick and a 2021 pick via the Wizards — which is good considering the Cavs parted ways with a number of second-round picks in trades during the LeBron James era.\n\nBurks’ salary could also be flipped again this season, as his expiring deal could be enticing for teams who want to have money to spend next summer."
