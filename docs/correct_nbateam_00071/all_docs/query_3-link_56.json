        "text": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Do you remember First Thoughts, from before when the world changed?\n\nWell, here’s my practice version, a shaking the rust off, if you will, having not done them in more than four months. Nevermind the headline. You know the format. There is some good stuff in here on J.J. Redick, and Zion Williamson, and LeBron — you may have heard of them. Oh, and I break out of my hotel room Sunday, for the first time in seven days.\n\nJ.J. Redick is one of five 36-year-olds currently playing in the NBA. Only four (Vince Carter, 43; Udonis Haslem, 40; Kyle Korver, 39; Tyson Chandler, 37) are older than that, and one, Carter, has already said his career is over.\n\nI asked Redick, who is in his 14th season and the first of a two-year, $26.5 million contract with the Pelicans, if the starting and stopping of NBA seasons caused by the novel coronavirus, and the uncertainty over the immediate future (next season, for instance) would impact how long he might want to play?\n\n“Actually that is a great question — the answer is yes,” Redick said. “First of all, I just turned 36, but I feel like I look at least 34 ½. I feel good still. I feel like I have years left in my body. As many of you know who have children and have a family, as they get older and you start missing milestones, it becomes harder to be away from them. I think as an athlete you want to have some sort of storybook ending. Most of us don’t get to have that. When you get towards the end, at least my thought process is as I get towards the end you sort of examine things in the moment. And, yeah, there’s uncertainty about next season and maybe even beyond that, it’s in the back of my mind about how much longer I want to play.\n\n“I don’t know what normal looks like for the foreseeable future,” Redick said. “None of us do. And so you’re just examining in real time with the information you have.”\n\nThe NBA set a tentative, target date of Dec. 1 to start the 2020-21 season, but it is subject to player approval and there is likely no way the union signs off on a new season starting so quickly (Christmas seems more realistic). There are also concerns league wide about starting another season without being able to have fans in the seats, which costs the NBA 40 percent of its revenue, and the league could seek a much later start to give the United States a chance to develop a COVID-19 vaccine or effective therapy to mitigate the threat of the virus.\n\nThere is also a possibility of the owners opting out of the current collective bargaining agreement and locking out the players, which, as I’m sure you realize, would put an indefinite hold on the start of next season.\n\nThere are 17 players in the NBA who are at least 35 (a list that includes LeBron), and only three (Carter, Hawks eliminated; Taj Gibson, Knicks eliminated; Trevor Ariza, opted out of Disney bubble) are not involved in the NBA’s restart.\n\nNeither Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry nor guard Lonzo Ball have communicated with star rookie Zion Williamson since he left the Disney campus Thursday morning due to an urgent family matter, and Gentry said he had no timetable for Williamson’s return.\n\nOn his podcast, Redick said he reached out to Williamson and told him: “Basically, we’re going to do our best to hold it down for him until he gets back, whenever that is. As a teammate, he’s a family member. We’ll do our best to keep this thing rolling. But obviously whatever is going on, we want the best for him. I feel awful for him because so much of this season has been a rollercoaster for him. It seemed like he was in such a good place. Hopefully we get him back here soon.”\n\nWilliamson, who turned 20 on July 6, was limited to 19 games this year due to meniscus surgery right before the start of the regular season. He’s averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 boards for the Pelicans, who are 10-9 when he plays (28-36 overall) and are 3.5 games behind the eighth-place Grizzlies with the season set to restart July 30.\n\nPer league protocol, Williamson would have to stay in quarantine for at least four days once he returns to Disney’s campus, or longer, depending on a few factors.\n\n“Once we learn more about Zion’s specific circumstances, we will determine his reentry protocol based on our rules,” a league spokesman told The Athletic on Thursday.\n\nThe league sent out a memo Friday (as The Athletic’s Shams Charania first reported) indicating that regular-season awards would be based on play through March 11, and would not include the NBA’s restart (consisting of eight games for the 22 teams invited to Disney).\n\nThose awards, like MVP, and defensive player of the year, and coach of the year, etc., are voted on by select media members. Campaigning has begun, and, I know this will shock you, coaches of players with a chance to win awards think their players should, in fact, win them.\n\n“Nobody impacts winning more than LeBron James, I do believe that he should be the MVP this year,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I believe he should be the MVP and I believe Anthony Davis should be the Defensive Player of the Year. I hope those awards go to our two players. That’s not to take anything away from some of the other candidates. But what LeBron means to our team, even before the season begins when the roster is being put together, with the number of guys that are on the Lakers because LeBron James is here and want to play with him. I think it starts there. And then obviously what he’s able to do on the basketball court, orchestrating the offense, leading the league in assists and really setting the tone on the defensive end. We’re the third best defense in the NBA, best in the West and a lot of that comes from his commitment this season, which has been greater than the last few years from what I’m told, has really set us apart in terms of being the best record currently in the Western Conference.”\n\nLeBron leads the NBA with 10.6 assists per game — easily a career high — in addition to the 25.7 points and 7.9 boards he averages.\n\nIn a stunner, earlier this week Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said his best player — reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, should win the award again. Giannis, 25, is third in the league in scoring (29.6 ppg) and fourth in rebounding (13.7 rpg). The Lakers and Bucks are the NBA’s two best teams, record wise, and of course lead their respective conferences.\n\nMeanwhile, Gentry says his best player, former Laker Brandon Ingram, should win the award for the most improved player. Ingram, in his fourth season and first with the Pelicans, is enjoying career highs in points (24.3), boards (6.3), and assists (4.3). He kept New Orleans relevant with Zion out.\n\n“I’ll be very disappointed if he’s not the most improved player in the league because I think he took a tremendous jump this year in making the All-Star team, but just overall being that guy we can count on at the end of the game and we can go to him at the end of the game,” Gentry said.\n\nRandom Thoughts…\n\nThe first three days of exhibition play here at Disney, which starts Wednesday, will feature games with 10 minute periods instead of the usual 12, The Athletic has confirmed. Each team will play one of their three scrimmages over the first three days. … Gentry said to expect some bells and whistles while watching the real games at home, beginning July 30 with his Pelicans against the Jazz on TNT. “You guys won’t believe, they’ve done an amazing job with the arena,” Gentry said. “I think everybody assumed we were just going to play in an empty arena and you’re going to hear the balls bouncing and the officials talking, but I think you’re going to be pleasantly surprised when you see the atmosphere we’re going to be playing in.” … Gentry also said he spoke to his team about the death of former U.S. congressman and civil rights lion John Lewis, who died Friday. “I told the guys just to take a look tonight, go online and read about him,” Gentry said. “All the things he experienced in the Jim Crow era and hey everybody knows about the whole bridge incident, trying to get across that bridge, and in so many instances he was with Dr. King when so many things happened, so, just a great man that fought for a lot of things that we’re experiencing right now. Obviously we’ve got a long way to go, but he was a pioneer and him getting us to where we are now because he was relentless with what he did and very dedicated to the cause.”… The Brooklyn Nets announced the signing of Justin Anderson as a COVID-19 replacement, as Shams had first reported. He was on a 10-day deal with the Nets earlier this season and appeared in three games. … A predictably light day Saturday at Disney with no more than 10 of 22 teams taking to the practice court. … And finally, the news you have all been waiting for — assuming a negative COVID-19 test overnight, this seven-day quarantine ends for myself and the other handful of reporters inside the bubble. We have been advised to take the day Sunday and enjoy any fresh air we can get. And after reading my reports all week about nasal swabs, Zoom calls, putting on wood floors, and, you know, “the food,” you could use some outdoors, too. Our in-person access to team practices starts Monday. I’m excited to bring to you reports about life inside this bubble, but outside my own hotel room. What I see and hear at practice and at these games each day, hotel campus life, (is there golf!?!?), things like that.\n\nThank you for following along thus far, and I hope you’ll stick with us.\n\n(Top Photo of J.J.
