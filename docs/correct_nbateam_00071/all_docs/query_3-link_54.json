        "text": "Requiem for the 2010 Utah Jazz\n\nBeing a Utah Jazz fan is starting to feel like being one of those monks that lit themselves on fire to protest Vietnam (isn’t that what’s on the cover of Rage Against The machine’s first album? – well one of those); it is a painful exercise that feels righteous. The Jazz are on the eve of destruction – a possible sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Lakers, an excellent (I won’t say great) team led by Kobe Bryant (Diet MJ) and Pau Gasol (the principle in the single biggest case of collusion I have ever seen in the NBA – as a recap The Lakers obtained Pau Gasol, a/k/a “The Big Llama” (my nickname) – a top 20 NBA player and one of the two most skilled low post scorers in the league – after Tim Duncan, from former Laker great Jerry West, then GM of the Memphis Grizzlies, who passed on basically getting every good player in the Chicago Bulls’ possession at the time, to accept, essentially, Kwame Brown’s expiring contract and Javaris Crittendon – now known as the Wyatt Earp to Gilbert Arenas’ Doc Holliday.).\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThis post is about the bittersweet joy of rooting for the Jazz. The truth is the Jazz should lose to the LA Lakers. The Lakers have the second best player on Earth right now, and terrific big men, which is the weakness for the Jazz defensively (with the exception of Michael Jordan it always has been). The Jazz counter with one lottery pick on their roster, two other first rounders (one of which, Kosta Koufus, is a project) and then a boatload of second round picks and NBDL refugees.\n\nBut that is the greatness of the Utah Jazz franchise. People snicker and try to insult the Jazz franchise by making derogatory comments about Mormonism or the politics of the state of Utah, but to me there is no more inspiring and “only in America” embodying franchise in sports than the Utah Jazz.\n\nTheir legends are Karl Malone and John Stockton, two somewhat overlooked players when they entered the league, became Hall of Famers through sheer work ethic and basketball intelligence (and large hands in Stockton’s case and broad shoulders in Malone’s case). The almost never missed games, they played hard and they excelled at the game. The fact that they never won a championship is very bittersweet, but unlike other franchises, they never really gave Jazz fans reason to lose interest. They provided great basketball and great effort for almost two decades.\n\nAfter Stockton and Malone’s departures for retirement the Jazz endured a short dark period. In fact the most remarkable season as a Jazz fan for me may have been when the Jazz missed the playoffs by a game or two with a record of 42-40 in the 2003-04 season with a starting lineup of… brace yourself…\n\nAndrei Kirlienko\n\nCarlos Arroyo\n\nGreg Ostertag\n\nMatt Harpring\n\nDeShawn Stevenson\n\nAnd the player with the next highest number of starts was Jarron Collins\n\nIn other words, in what should have been the dark days for the Utah Jazz with a starting lineup of one versatile, non-scoring all star (Kirilenko), a solid 6th man type player (Harpring), a serviceable point guard (Arroyo), an underachieving soon-to-be journeyman (Stephenson) and two big men who had no business in the NBA (especially the atrocious Collins) the Jazz still delivered a season that came down to the last game of the season. And in traditional Jazz style, it ended with a loss.\n\nBut the dark times gave the rare opportunity to the Jazz for a franchise-changing pick, with which they took Deron Williams, who has blossomed into the best point guard in the NBA (which I have been mocked for claiming for the last 3 years because I thought unlike most point guards he was both a playmaker and a system manager and thus I found the completeness of his game, not necessarily his stats, made him the best). Along with him came the rare free agent coup for the Jazz in Carlos Boozer (though like any omen in good fiction, the fact that Boozer screwed over the blind former owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers has come back to bite them in Greek tragedy form since Boozer is exceptional against every team in the league except the one team that prevents them from chasing a championship – the Lakers).\n\nWell now the Jazz have found themselves down 3-0 to the defending champion Lakers, but no one will confuse this with an Atlanta Hawks/Orlando Magic 3-0 series. The Jazz have played tough, made adjustments and had late game leads in two of the three games. Unlike previous seasons, at least one of these games should have been a blowout. And watching guys like Paul Millsap and Wesley Matthews, the former a second round pick, the latter an undrafted rookie, play so balls out tough that it almost feels like it really is “how they play the game” that makes it a joy to watch.\n\nThe bottom line is the Jazz will not win this series with the Lakers. If they get swept then it will be the most competitivve sweep in NBA history. But I will have no problem tuning in to watch the Jazz next year because as a basketball fan I love the way the Jazz play. Throughout my life I have had people tell me that the Jazz are “boring.” Those have to be people who enjoy the dunks and the flash of the NBA, but do not love the sport of basketball. To watch the Jazz play the game is like watching a hoops symphony. The execution, the timing, the effort and the way players who play for the Jazz accept roles and work hard at them are all beautiful to watch. And the architect of all this is Coach Jerry Sloan.\n\nIn 1998 when the Jazz lost their second consecutive finals to the Chicago Bulls I was crushed. The guy who made me feel better was Jerry Sloan. When he came to the press conference after Michael Jordan’s game winning shot he had such a matter of fact, “we’ll be back next year and don’t expect me to cry over this” attitude that I figured if Sloan could bounce back, I surely could. And watching the Jazz play for Sloan’s tenure (over two decades – the most tenured coach in pro sports) has been a pleasure. He takes players with high effort and high basketball intelligence and toughness and makes them good NBA players. Watching Williams or Boozer blossom is not as big a thrill as seeing guys like Millsap. Matthews, Ronnie Price and Kyle Korver reach their max with Utah. The Utah Jazz is the ultimate American meritocracy – if you can play the game and you work hard, you can have a successful career for Jerry Sloan and be appreciated by the fans.\n\nBut Jerry Sloan has not won a Coach of the Year (seriously 2003-04 should have been his) and the Jazz have not won a title. Therefore the franchise and its players do not get the respect they deserve. And every year I get to hear from my friends who either shift loyalties from week to week or, in the case of Knick fans, sit quietly waiting for their team to purchase big name talent (looks like their wait is finally over this Summer).\n\nI obviously want the Jazz to win a title, but the truth is they have made my life as a fan really enjoyable. They always put a good product, not just in talent, but in work ethic and execution out on the court. I am honestly scared of the day Jerry Sloan decides to retire because I think that he may be the most valuable player of all to the Utah Jazz. His system and his culture may be a bigger imprint on the Jazz franchise than any one player they’ve ever had. A championship would be great, in fact it is part of my top two things I would like to see (along with a Guns N Roses reunion) in popular culture, but the kind of sustained excellence of the Utah Jazz, and the character in which they achieved such sustained quality may be even rarer than a championship.\n\nBut since I still want them to win a title and I don’t want to end this on too sentimental or gushy a moment – here are some things the Jazz must do.\n\n1) Get a bona fide 6’10″+ center who can be a shot blocking and defensive force. Cole Aldridge may be the only player in the draft who may be able do this (and he may be right around where the Jazz draft). I’d avoid Greg Monroe if I’m the Jazz because his passing skills make him an enticing big man for the Jazz, but he will not be a defensive force and the beating his Georgetown team took from Ohio U makes me think he won’t help bring additional winning intensity to the Jazz. As far as free agents Brendan Haywood is a free agent this season and I think the Jazz would be wise to see if he is the kind of character that could thrive in Utah. However, if the Jazz have a chance at Evan Turner then you take him. That is the only way I change this approach.\n\n2) Try to keep Boozer, but not too hard. The bad news – if we lose Boozer, Millsap fills in fine, but we lose Millsap off the bench so overall win total will be down 5-6. The good news is that if that money goes to decent center play then we have a better chance against the Lakers. Pick your poison – slightly worse against the rest of the league or better against the Lakers.\n\n3) Re-sign Wesley Matthews and Kyle Korver. Hard working people and the women of Utah will not forgive you otherwise.\n\n4) Play as well and as hard as in 2009-10 and good hings will probably happen. Until you lose. Then look forward to 2011-12. You know the drill.\n\nSalt Lake City Thriller\n\nYesterday I was part of a magnificent game between the Utah Jazz and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Kevin Durant scored almost at will, but Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer also had great games. With less than two seconds left in the game Deron Williams hit a game winning shot over two Thunder players to give the Jazz a one point lead. What is quirky about this is that it occurred on the corresponding season game on my video game yesterday morning as I left for the airport. Sometimes life imitates art and sometimes life imitates video games. (or another true example – sometimes a hockey player that “dated” your ex scores a goal on you in NHL10).\n\nThe day did not start with good omens. As I got on my Delta flight to Salt Lake City I observed an Indian family of four sitting in my row of three. I had an aisle seat because my legs are a long, awkward nuisance and I cannot physically sit in the middle seat or a window seat unless absolutely necessary. The family, whose English was limited, but whose baby’s screaming was proficient, looked at me with this look like the father in Blood Diamond who did not want to be separated from his family. I just said, “I can’t switch seats with you because your seat is a window and I am a giant.” So my trip to Hoops Mecca began with breaking up a family.\n\nWhen I arrived in Utah I was blown away by the white landscape. And the snow capped mountains as well. Seriously, the scenery was beautiful and there were actually more minorities than I expected. Granted, it had the diversity of a NYC law firm, but that was better than what I expected, which was the diversity of Friends.\n\nAmong the pre-game highlights were standing on the street named after John Stockton and seeing a sign that indicated that drinking was not illegal in Salt Lake City. Expectations were getting obliterated by the minute!\n\nI went to the arena around 6 pm (one hour before game time) to look around and to spend money in the gift shop like a crack addict in New Jack City. There were also several groups, who apparently did not make the cut for halftime shows – a series of awkward child dancing routines. I think everyone who knowingly shows up to pre-game early to watch this (that isn’t related to the kids or an unknowing out-of-towner) should be automatically registered on sex offender lists.\n\nSomething else I noticed was how many doors I held for people in Utah without getting a thank you. Perhaps it’s a cultural thing or perhaps I have been too harsh on Manhattan as the King City of Rudeness. Or maybe it was just a coincidence.\n\nIn the Energy Solutions Arena my seats were so close to the court that I could actually see concern on Paul Millsap’s face when he looked in my direction and saw me wearing his jersey. His thought may have been – why is that grown man wearing my jersey? And why is he so big and not playing?\n\nThe pre-game warm-ups featured the Jazz mascot “Bear” who is a anthropomorphous bear who comes into the arena on a motorcycle to greet the Jazz starters. It sounds weird, but it makes perfect sense for a team called the Utah Jazz.\n\nWhen the game started I felt like I was at a Tea Party rally. There were angry white people yelling things at black men they did not support that made no sense. It seemed like at the beginning of the game the emotions ran much higher than rational thought. Every call that was made against the Jazz drew jeers, no matter how right the call was. And the young woman sitting next to me was literally overflowing with bad heckles – her best was shrieking that Russel Westbrook (pt guard for the Thunder) should call himself Westbrick! The guys next to me were a little better because they kept calling Serge Ibaka (center for Thunder) Chewbakka (which I got laughs for when I did a decent Chewbacca impression).\n\nThe game was going well for the Jazz early, but Ibaka (ggggggggggggggg) helped keep the Thunder in the game. At halftime the Jazz were actually down 1.\n\nThere various amounts of intermissions provided humor. There were the dancers, who shook their breasts and asses with great vigor, but because they were dancing to oldies half the time I guess it is less dirty than other franchises who dance to Whitesnake and Timbaland. It was around this time that I heard my first and only anti Obama comment from the people behind me. That was 7 less than I expected.\n\nThere was also a brief acknowledgement of the Salt Lake City Bees who were either a minor league baseball team or a separatist militia. Oh wait – there were a couple of brown people with them.\n\nI of course did yeoman’s work at the concession stand, but drew a “You don’t want cheese???” more incredulous than any I have ever received when I purchased some soft pretzel bites.\n\nThe second half turned a good game into what may have been the NBA Game of the Year to this point. Deron Williams got filthy, CJ Miles alternated his play between Kobe Bryant, Dr. J and J-L Cauvin, solidifying him as unquestionably the most frustrating Jazz player. Carlos Boozer started dunking like a madman, but then Kevin Durant happened.\n\nKevin Durant is my favorite player in the NBA not on the Utah Jazz. He is built like Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas, but has such an effortless and smooth game. He will be the chief rival against LeBron’s James’ upcoming dominance because just as LeBron is so physically gifted, Durant has incredibly innate basketball gifts.\n\nSo the Durant show began and he just started pouring in points. The game eventually was tied by Georgetown alum Jeff Green’s three pointer (as if the Law Center experience was not enough of a reason for me to hate G-Town) with 8 seconds left.\n\nIt was at this point that I noticed something odd – as legitimate passion and tension rose during the game: the fans were not saying stupid stuff. It seemed once they had to focus solely on exciting action they had no time to make inane and unfunny comments. I grew to appreciate the crowd’s enthusiasm (though the Korver-to Millsap Jersey ration left some unfavorable in my mind – though I don’t begrudge the chicks for shrieking for Kyle Korver a/k/a Ashton Kutcher with a jumpshot).\n\nIn overtime the Jazz had the ball with five seconds left and the atmosphere was electric – just check my 3,898 Tweets during the game (www.Twitter.com/JLCauvin). Boozer got the ball handed it off to Williams who nailed a jumper over two defenders with 1.1 seconds left. (Please see that on my Twitter feed I wrote about the ending of my video game an hour before Williams re-played it in real life). That was awesome.\n\nKevin Durant ended up missing a game winning shot thanks to CJ Miles gently slamming Durant’s forearm, but Durant was not going to get the call for a few reasons. One – Kevin Garnett had made a public and expensive complaint about Durant getting calls. Two – Durant over-dramatized the foul with leg flailing that only drew attention from the actual foul on his wrist. Three – it did not happen on my video game.\n\nSo the Jazz finish up the J-L Jazz tour in dramatic fashion, giving me a 5-0 season at Jazz games. It was a phenomenal trip and a phenomenal game. Now I need my plane to leave already so I can play Utah vs. Houston before tonight’s game. If it happens again I’m calling Hollywood about a sequel to the Gerard “My native accent always creeps in to any role I play” Butler “film” Gamer.\n\nMy Ten Favorite Things From 2009\n\nNo movies made this list (but I have already given you my Top Ten of the Year, so they don’t really need another platform anyway). Not everything is from this year, but they were read, viewed, worn or observed by me this year.\n\n10. Fred Armisen. In a year that had some ups and downs, he represented both. He gave what is the least funny impression ever on Saturday Night Live and he did it week after week. To quote Forrest Whitaker’s character from The Shield, “It’s like he is pissing in my mouth!” But the bright side of that is that one year in there is still a void for a decent Obama impression. If ever there was hope for me in 2010…\n\n9. Arrested Development – I know this show is older, but I watched the first three seasons on Netflix this year and it is the funniest multi-season show I have ever seen (important distinction hint hint). If you have not seen it, you should.\n\n8. Laid Off/Full Time Comedian\n\nAccording to my biopic script:\n\nI walked out from the law firm that had crushed my soul with a defiant stride knowing that although I was taking a risk pursuing comedy full time I had the confidence of knowing that I would follow my dream and in the end be a success. I was also touched by the slow clap I received from all my co-workers as I left on my last day.\n\nAccording to reality:\n\nI planned on going to do comedy full time in 2009 at some point, but given the economic climate and the generally good feeling of a swollen bank account (from a pretty nice place to work as law firms go) I probably needed the push, or shove, of being laid off to pursue comedy full time. Now my dream still feels attainable, but is starting to resemble a bad acid trip as much as it does a dream on its way to fulfillment.\n\n7. Steeler Super Bowl – This was cool because it was a great game and washed away memories of the only Super Bowl the Steelers had won in my lifetime – Super Bowl XL (40), which was the worst Super Bowl ever played. I also cannot put the Yankees title on here, because although I like many of the players, something about that victory felt like cheering Goldman Sachs’ bankers when they date rape your daughter and your pension fund. Of course the Steelers did not help themselves with their “ni-ger” shouting fans this season, but perhaps a poor season will be their punishment for having racist fans.\n\n6. Obama’s Inauguration/Nixonland – Such a cool moment when Obama was inaugurated. Even cooler was being able to predict how half of America would turn on him as soon as they could and how his young supporters would realize that politics is work and detail and compromise and not a pop culture reality show called For The Love of Obama on VH1. I always bet on old people in the long term in politics and in 2010 the book Nixonland will prove quite prescient when the Republicans break through the 60 voting block in the Senate and win about 30 seats back in the House. If you like politics or just want to predict the 2010 election read Nixonland. But January 20, 2009 was still a great day. The country was divided on September 10, 2001 and after 9/11 the country rallied around Bush (91% approval, after being dismally low before). Do you think if the same happened today the country would rally around its President? I am guessing not.\n\n5. The West Wing – Watched the entire seven seasons on DVD in 5 weeks. The greatest dramatic series I have ever watched not named The Wire. Sorry The Sopranos I think you’re great as well, but the detail and the writing of The West Wing was intimidating in its brilliance.\n\n4. New York’s Funniest Comedian – I am still waiting for an e-mail response(to a very politely and respectfully worded e-mail) from a certain comedy club as to why I never got a call back, despite being promised a spot in a showcase and simultaneously being denied a chance to audition because it was unnecessary. This moment was a low point in my comedy naivete, but also a wake up call that was invaluable. That is not to say that 40 years from now when I am sitting a lone in a mansion, miserably counting my money in the dark, that I won’t assault, with a bowling pin, some booker or manager or assistant sycophant who shows up to my home. That reminds me, I think my next CD will be entitled “I’m Finished!”\n\n3. The Bonfire of the Vanities – The most enjoyable piece of fiction I have ever read. Did for novel writing what The West Wing did for me in terms of television. As Salieri said of Mozart’s music in Amadeus, “Remove one note and there would be diminishment.” That is how I felt about every sentence of this 600+ page novel, which is just as relevant today as it was 22 years ago. Just don’t see the movie before or after reading it.\n\n2. Paul Millsap Jersey – I received this gift Christmas 2008, but I did not wear it until this hoops season. If it’s the thought that counts, then I have never received a better gift in my life. And I seem to be the only person outside of Utah to possess one, which makes it even more exceptional if you consider things in Utah fashionable.\n\n1. Eastbound and Down – So this is the answer to the question what could be better than great literature, historic national elections, pursuing your dream or seeing your team win a title? That’s right – a fu-king redneck. If Eastbound and Down ended after only these 6 episodes it would be like Guns N Roses dying after releasing Appetite For Destruction – a perfect debut to live on forever. So apologies to my girlfriend, Barack Obama, Tom Wolfe, Jason Bateman, The Steelers, stand up comedy, and everything else that went on this year, but my favorite thing this year was a foul mouthed racist pitcher form Shelby, North Carolina – Mr. Kenny Powers.\n\nAnd feel free to support Kenny Powers with a Kenny Powers jersey: Kenny Powers Jersey\n\nHave a Happy New Year readers and fans. All 6 of you."
