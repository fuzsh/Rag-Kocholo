        "text": "Contrary to popular belief, Korver doesn’t seem to think there’s a job overseas for every NBA player that wants one. “I really don’t think the opportunity’s there for everybody like everybody seems to think there is,” he said. “If something great came up, obviously you would look at it and probably take [it]. You only get to play basketball at a professional level for so long. You got to find something else to do. You get a little old. But I’m not actively [searching for a job overseas]. I just got married. I’m going to enjoy that and get ready for this basketball season. I still have hope that it’s going to happen. We’ll kind of see from there.\n\n“If you’re an All-Star, I think you can go over there and make some pretty good money, but if you’re not, there’s only so many teams that are reliable to pay. If something comes across, obviously you look at it, and if it’s a good deal you probably take it. But I don’t have my agent scouring Europe for a contract for me.”\n\nDeron Williams and Kyle Korver are hosting their charity dodgeball tournament again this summer. And, no, it won’t be held in Turkey, Chicago or New Jersey. The two former Utah Jazz players will return to the Beehive State on Aug. 27 for their third-annual event. Proceeds will benefit the Boys & Girls Club through Williams’ The Point of Hope Foundation and the Utah chapter of Korver’s Seer Group charity. Though neither NBA player plays for the Jazz any longer, they both wanted to come back to their old homes for the popular tournament. “After spending six years playing ball in Utah, I feel a strong connection to that community,” Williams, who was traded to the Nets in February after being with the Jazz since 2005, said in a statement.\n\nChicago Bulls forward Kyle Korver made an appearance with his brother Klayton to promote his clothing line at Block 37 on State Street, but the talk wasn’t just about his designer apparel and The Kyle Korver Foundation. With the NBA still in a lockout, Korver expressed his frustration about the possibility of losing an entire season. “It’s a shame,” Korver said. “The NBA makes too much money for everybody not to be making a little bit already, right?”\n\nOn Wednesday, the turtle was well enough to leave the place where it had spent more than a year in a kiddie pool, receiving calcium supplements and dining on euthanized mice. Miles away from the big event, Korver, 30, said he was happy about Thomas’ good fortune. “It’s very cool.” Robert felt equally good, calling the “small victory” a great thing. “Live long and prosper,” Robert said just before Thomas paddled away. “Rock on, brother!”\n\nShell-shocked doesn’t begin to describe the last 14 months in the life of Thomas the turtle. The odyssey includes the injured 20-pound reptile, a rock-DJ icon at WMMR-FM (93.3), an ex-76er, and a wildlife rehabilitation center in Roxborough. They were brought together on the night of May 25, 2010, when the snapping turtle tried to cross Route 23 near Conshohocken and was hit by a car. That night, the disc jockey – Pierre Robert – saved its life. On Wednesday, they were reunited to celebrate Thomas’ recovery and its return to the wilds of Gladwyne. The turtle stepped gingerly into the waters of the Schuylkill in Flat Rock Park, paddling away from the crew that made sure it got a second chance."
