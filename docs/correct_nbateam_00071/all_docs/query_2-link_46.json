        "text": "One. Rodney Hood, asked about the end-of-game Jeff Withey no-call against Houston: I think all 10 players stopped on the court. You know, their players, you know, everybody was — I think the fans paused; everybody paused. You know, but, you know, calls like that, don’t define a game. It was a gam–it was plays within the game that we could’ve did to come out on top.\n\nGordon Hayward, asked about the end-of-game Jeff Withey no-call against Houston: It is what it is. Nothing you can do about it now. You know, we didn’t lose it at that play. We lost it early in the fourth quarter.\n\nQuin Snyder, asked about the end-of-game Jeff Withey no-call against Houston: Whatever they called, they called. I don’t think one call was the game. I don’t think one missed jumper was the game. I don’t think one free throw was the game. You know, it’s just, it’s easy to look for those things. I do it too. We’ll use them to try to get better. Those are situations we want to work on.\n\nBut in the end, you know, it’s not one thing. So I mean, I just, I don’t think it helps us get better to fixate on anything. And this group right now — I mean, those are the Houston Rockets. They just went to the Western Conference Finals. Dwight Howard’s an all-star.\n\nYou know, Jeff Withey was inactive earlier in the year. Jeff Withey plays his tail off. I mean, that’s where my focus is. You know, Rodney Hood just had a baby yesterday. You know, he’s going against James Harden. You know, the guy’s arguably the MVP last year.\n\nLike, I’ve been so proud of this team, the way they fight. So, if we make a mistake here and there, or struggle scoring for a stretch, you know, I’m not gonna go there. You know, I’m not gonna go there.\n\nWe beat Memphis last game. You know, I mean, we may not win for two weeks, but if we get better, I’m happy. And we just use this thing to get better. As tough as it is, we can’t wallow in it. Just gotta learn from it and get better.\n\nTwo. Ron Artest/Metta World Peace quietly got to second base with Gordon Hayward before the Jazz left L.A.\n\nThree. Rodney Hood on the birth of his son: I went to sleep around 12. About 2 o’clock, you know, Richa, my fiancee, just panicking. You know, I thought she was, you know, just overexaggerating, but you know, I looked at the — she, her water had broke.\n\nAnd you know, went to the hospital. You know, I was scared. You know, I never been so scared, ’cause you know, we weren’t expecting him so soon. But I went to the hospital, was in the hospital. He was born around nine that day, on Jan. 3. And you know, he’s here now. He’s healthy…[He was] about six weeks early. …\n\nI actually saw the [delivery], so you know, it’s a bit, you know, nasty, a bit, you know, exciting. You know, just amazing feeling, you know, getting a chance to see that. … [His name] was just always going to be Rodney Jr. I wanted my first boy to be Rodney Jr.\n\nHood, asked who’s the best at changing diapers between Derrick Favors, Trey Burke and Gordon Hayward: I don’t think neither of those guys change diapers….I’ll say D-Fav, ’cause he has two. I’m sure he has to change one of them.\n\nFour. Jeff Withey has failed as a boyfriend:\n\nFive. Dennis Lindsey on what he learned about Rudy Gobert when he was injured: He was very motivated [to get back], and he and I had a couple good moments, you know, just back in the locker room where, you know, he gets fired up at our group when they need to do something with more force, usually on the defensive end.\n\nAnd he and [Derrick] Fav[ors] have been back in the back again with me, and you know, pumped up when, you know, an–when, during periods like the Memphis game where you could really feel our guys coming together and fighting. …\n\nYou not only miss Rudy and Derrick’s physical attributes, but you miss their edge. And you know, [Gobert’s] competitive, and he provides a certain level of defensive backbone and edginess where, you know, he wants to do well. He has plans for himself and us.\n\nSix. Rudy Gobert, asked why there was no salute on his first dunk in his first game back (at Houston): Salute for the, for home.\n\nSeven. Quin Snyder on Christapher Johnson: Any time you have a guy that’s giving of himself that freely and that, you know, with that much enthusiasm, it, you know, you can’t help but be motivated by that and moved by that. And that’s how he plays.\n\nI mean, he’s just, like, the kind of guy you want to be around and the kind of guy you want to play with, ’cause he’s just all about the group. And he’s all about his teammates, and invariably that ends up having a greater impact on the game than anything that you see in a box score.\n\nEight. Dante Exum getting his gummy bears:\n\nNine. The Jazz no longer have a Millsap:\n\nDennis Lindsey on Elijah Millsap: We haven’t closed the book on Elijah Millsap. We just have quite a few things going on that we just couldn’t predict, with Dante [Exum] and Alec [Burks] and, on the perimeter, and the team is forming a certain way. And so, as cold as it sounds, the optionality of our roster, especially given that we have cap room to work with, becomes very high.\n\nAnd so, you know, again, we recognize all of his efforts, and, in particular his defense that can be quite unique at times. And we’re gonna continue to watch him, and really all the prospects, to see what’s the right fit, you know, on the short term for the Utah Jazz.\n\nTen. Unintentional Dirty Quote Machines of the Week (UDQM)\n\n** Craig Bolerjack on Gordon Hayward’s new muscles: Around the year, you know, it’s tough to keep that muscle on because you’re wearing it out every night.\n\n** Dennis Lindsey on Quin Snyder’s preparation: He wants it so bad…and you know, God bless his soul, he’s, you know, up all hours, you know, trying to find every particular advantage. I mean, when I say he’s working right up to the tip before the game, you know, he’s, he really, you know, he’s quite dynamic in his work.\n\nFrom David Locke’s “Get to Know” series; recorded in October\n\nChildhood room: One poster of Michael Jordan\n\nFamily and birth order: Youngest of three. A brother six years older who’s a 6-5, stocky, married firefighter with three kids in San Diego, and a sister five years older who moved to New Orleans to help him out and loved it so much she stayed there\n\nWhat’s the worst job or chore you’ve ever had? We had a couple dogs growing up…Pick up poop and do all that good stuff with the dogs. So, that was a horrible chore. My parents made me do it.\n\nWhat’s the first basketball court you ever played on? Grew up on 10 acres of land in the country; had a basketball hoop outside on the dirt pavement\n\nFirst person that recognized your talent: My mom always pushed me to be really good. She knew I was gonna be really tall, even though the doctors said I was gonna be 6-4, 6-5. She knew that I was gonna grow up taller than that. So, she put me in basketball right away. I was always playing with the older kids…When I got older and started getting better and better, my high school coach really pushed me. Waheed Mitchell. He was a great guy. I still talk to him today. One of my mentors for sure.\n\nWho were the basketball stars in your area growing up? Chase Budinger and Jeremy Tyler\n\nSingle greatest shot of your career: A 15-foot jumper to win the game against a rival high school\n\nBest game you’ve ever played: Elite Eight game against North Carolina\n\nWhy do you wear No. 24? Wore it in high school; wore No. 5 in college because 24 was taken\n\nWhat are you most thankful for? Family, opportunity to play basketball for a living and to play basketball for a living in the U.S.\n\nWhat’s the most scared you’ve ever been in your entire life? I hurt my foot my sophomore year of college…Couldn’t really walk on it. I heard something pop…Whenever something, you know, an injury like that happens, it’s really a scary moment.\n\nHardest thing you’ve ever had to overcome: Playing a game his senior year the day after his grandma passed, and losing to Kentucky in the NCAA championship game\n\nIf you were an actor, what kind of actor would you be? I’d just be the cool guy…I’m real laid-back, so somebody like that. Just chill, laid-back, surfer guy maybe. Beach bum.\n\nDinner with three people, dead or alive: Jesus, Abraham Lincoln, and Julius Caesar\n\nFavorite food: Pizza; anything Italian\n\nLeast favorite food: Chocolate\n\nFavorite NBA arena: Staples Center and Madison Square Garden\n\nLeast favorite NBA arena: I don’t really have a least favorite. I think that it’s a blessing playing anywhere in the NBA.\n\nFavorite athlete growing up: Michael Jordan….I was a Laker fan, so you know, Shaq and Kobe, all those guys, growing up were awesome\n\nLeast favorite athlete growing up: Didn’t have one\n\nFavorite musical genre: R&B, hip hop, pop\n\nLeast favorite musical genre: Really old-school, like, slow music\n\nFive most frequently used apps on your phone: Instagram, Candy Crush, email, text messaging, Internet browser\n\nTop five video games of all time: Mario Kart, any Call of Duty, Tony Hawk, GoldenEye, and Donkey Kong on Gameboy\n\nAll-time NBA starting five: Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone, and Shaquille O’Neal\n\nTop five four non-NBA athletes: Michael Phelps, Bubba Watson, Roger Federer, and LaDainian Tomlinson\n\nToday’s Opponent Game Thread host: Pounding the Rock.\n\nHola mishamigos!\n\nI had a shit day at work, I said a bad word to our main boss, I immensely dislike 2 of my co workers, I got written up, and I legitimately thought abt kicking someone in the face. I’ve already had one pudding when I got home just to feel better and now I need a win. So let’s do that.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:11 PM\n\nI stuck up for you for not being late!\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:13 PM\n\nI saw! Thank you. You’re already nicer than the ppl I work with. Or that I work around. Bc they don’t do much but whine.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:14 PM\n\nWait, I didn’t know we had the same coworkers!?!?!\n\nby thirtynineyearfan on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:19 PM\n\nLet’s quit and be strippers.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:20 PM\n\nI could clear the club at closing time with my strip act.\n\nby Mark Barrington on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:22 PM\n\n!!!!!! I think I’d have to pay people to watch me instead of the other way around, so probably not a good career move for me.\n\nby thirtynineyearfan on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:23 PM\n\nI can join you and we could become the flabulous twins.\n\nby Stijl on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:42 PM\n\nlook at that. off to a good start for once.\n\nby twotonkatrucks on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:42 PM\n\nQuin Snyder pulling a Pop and calling a timeout less than two minutes into the game.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:42 PM\n\nHe’s only got 10 players. Gotta try to rest them when he can.\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:44 PM\n\nHayward with a dead chicken on his head.\n\nby death&taxes on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:47 PM\n\nJeff Withey is not the name of an NBA player. Jeff Withey sounds more like the sort of guy who would play with Wilco.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:49 PM\n\ninteresting, one of the jazz announcer played with duncan in wake forest apparently.\n\nby twotonkatrucks on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:50 PM\n\nYeah the announcer guy went to Georgia.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:59 PM\n\nThese games must’ve happened in the 1890s.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 7:59 PM\n\nFun fact: Tim Duncan was high school recruit Matt Harpring’s host when he visited Wake Forest.\n\nSpurs are winning this game on auto pilot so far. Just going to the playbook, smart positioning on D and boards…and that’s it.\n\nby Mauro Tardella on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:00 PM\n\nSPURS problems, I know, but I really need to pee but Boban just checked in!\n\nby thirtynineyearfan on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:01 PM\n\nTrue fact: Joe Ingles is Spanish for “Joe English.”\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:08 PM\n\nWouldn’t it be “I am English” ???\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:22 PM\n\nIt hurts my feelings when you’re racist…\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:24 PM\n\nGordon Hayward must be hating life right. Every second he’s on the floor he’s going to be harassed by Kawhi Leonard or Johnathon Simmons. That’s about as much fun as being waterboarded.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:11 PM\n\nBoban is gangsta\n\nby andyprough on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:15 PM\n\nwonder what flavor Boban likes…\n\nby magnuskrauss on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:17 PM\n\nHuman Marrow.\n\nby Sigurd Jarlson on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:19 PM\n\nIm drunk on the spurs. Spurs drunk\n\nby The Prune on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:19 PM\n\nwe are spoiled af\n\nby ManuArg on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:21 PM\n\nUtah’s probably thinking, “Not this shit again…”\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:21 PM\n\nWhat the hell is that thing on Hayward’s head?!\n\nby death&taxes on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:25 PM\n\nWait, what? It’s ING-gels?\n\nby magnuskrauss on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:32 PM\n\nIs anyone else stuck with the Utah announcers? They’re bizarrely emotionless and I kind of like it… they’re still annoying though.\n\nby cecilthesheep on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:35 PM\n\nLOLOL they ARE emotionless! Like they’re already resigned to a loss and are just going through the motions. They talk abt SA more than their own team.\n\nI like them, though. Lol\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:35 PM\n\nI feel like I’m nitpicking and being ridiculous, but I don’t think Utah should have 50. They should be in the low 40s.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:40 PM\n\nI’m looking at it the same way.\n\nThen again us Spurs fans are dangerously close to being those sorts of parents who get pissed off at report cards that don’t read “A+” in every class.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 8:42 PM\n\nOkay, upon further review I’m a big fan of the Utah announcers.\n\nby cecilthesheep on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:05 PM\n\nWhat they say?\n\nby Stijl on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:06 PM\n\nWell first of all they’re quiet, which I actually love, but most recently they agreed that was a no-call when Timmy got stripped. They’re very objective both ways, really.\n\nby cecilthesheep on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:07 PM\n\nTrey Burke, I like you. You’re fiesty. You’re Kyle Lowry without the fatty clothes.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:16 PM\n\nEvery year I watch the Jazz play I think “What the heck does Jazz music and Utah have in common…nothing.”\n\nThis year…”why the heck is the Jazz uniform green?”\n\nby MonkdaSpursFan on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:21 PM\n\nFor people from other countries, most dont know that Utah has nothing to do with Jazz.\n\nby Mauro Tardella on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:26 PM\n\nSeven players in double figures. This team is run by Communists.\n\nby 0signal on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:26 PM\n\nOh no! We’re not gonna score 120\n\nby death&taxes on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:31 PM\n\nc’mon 4 more points! we can do it! 120!\n\nby twotonkatrucks on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:34 PM\n\n8 Guys in double figs!\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:34 PM\n\nOut shooting dropped to 59.8%.\n\nby fuzzy_quack on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:35 PM\n\nAtrocious. What an embarrassment.\n\nby cecilthesheep on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:36 PM\n\n121! New record!\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:38 PM\n\nthis is the first time Pop’s Spurs have scored more than 120 pts in three games in a row.\n\nby chajamamama on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:40 PM\n\nOh no! Theyre gonna score 100\n\nby death&taxes on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:40 PM\n\nThat’s classy, Jazz! Dribbling out the game.\n\nby René Torenstra on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:41 PM\n\nSPURS WIN!!\n\nAnd Utah didn’t get 100.\n\nby DMarie2101 on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:41 PM\n\nOur pride remains intact\n\nby Valiere on Jan 6, 2016 | 9:43 PM\n\nMovin’ on up.\n\nOne. Gordon Hayward on the importance of a bounce-back game after a loss: It was big, for us as a young team. It was a big performance by some of those young guys…Hopefully, we, you know, don’t have to come back and bounce back as much next year. But, you know, you’re gonna have those nights, so.\n\nTwo. Trey Lyles Bench Celebration of the Week:\n\nThree. ♥\n\nFour. Soon?\n\nFive. Jeff Withey on how Quin Snyder benefits his game: You know, when I was in New Orleans, I felt like I just had a microscope on me. You know, it was hard to play just because if you messed up, you’re out of the game.\n\nCoach is patient, and he lets you develop and he lets you go out there and play. And you might mess up, and he’ll pull you out and then give, like, at least talk to you and then put you right back in the game or something like that, you know? So, he just gives players confidence, and I definitely feel that.\n\nI’ve been working with coach Tony Lang, and he’s doing a great job with me. He’s building my confidence up, and we watch film all the time. We work on everything. So, you know, just, the guys around me, I have coaches that, they’re doing a great job.\n\nSix. Alec Burks’ new wheels:\n\nSeven. Quin Snyder on the win over the Grizzlies: At some point, you know, saying “shorthanded” doesn’t do a, the right — doesn’t give, does a disservice to the guys that played…The thing that stands out is just the, you know, the grit. And we played with passion…\n\nI don’t think there was one guy that just didn’t give every part of himself to the game. And it’s hard to do that all the time, but we sure did it tonight. And I’m glad the result, you know, ended up reflecting that.\n\nSnyder on Tibor Pleiss’ performance: What he did tonight was pretty impressive, to be — it’s hard to not know if you’re gonna play, and to be in and out, and he looked like he was out there — he competed and I loved that he turned and shot the ball. And then he shot another one. It made me smile, ’cause he just, there was a courage about how he played that was great.\n\nYou know, he didn’t come in there with, you know, walking on eggshells or anything, and sometimes that’s hard to do. I know I couldn’t do it as a player. You come in and you’re nervous a little bit, and he looked really comfortable, and just happy to see him have an opportunity like that.\n\nEight. “That was my friend Rudy. Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup.”\n\nNine. Scene from a Utah Jazz game:\n\nTen. Unintentional Dirty Quote Machines of the Week (UDQM)\n\n** Trey Burke on Jeff Withey and Trevor Booker flipping screens: Once they flip, I’m deeper.\n\n** Quin Snyder on running plays for Rodney Hood: Yeah, I think especially, you know, one of the things about Rodney is on the backside, he’s coming middle with his left hand a lot.\n\nAnd from the possibly-not-very-unintentional files, here’s Matt Harpring stroking Craig Bolerjack’s “antler”:"
