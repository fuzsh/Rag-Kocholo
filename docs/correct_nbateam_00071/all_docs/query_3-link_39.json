        "text": "The Utah Jazz will open their season Wednesday night in Denver with three players out to injury and two others being game-time decisions.\n\nWhere have I heard this before?\n\nOhhhh, right, last year. Utah began their season with key injuries too, and every single year before that.\n\nI blame Jerry Sloan for working them too hard in the preseason.\n\nI blame Utah's wild nightlife for keeping players from getting offseason appropriate rest.\n\nI blame Malone and Stockton for setting the comparative bar so high.\n\nI blame my parents for allowing me to care about sports.\n\nEarly season injuries have never affected overall season performance much, except when Deron \"Atlas\" Williams went down. Once again he carries the Jazz world on his shoulders. Good thing he's healthy.\n\nWhen Carlos Boozer took his extended vacation—I mean, was injured—we were introduced to the basketball version of James Brown: Paul Millsap. The hardest working man in the b-ball business actually improved that position for Utah temporarily.\n\nMillsap is healthy except for a mild case of carpal tunnel in his right wrist that he developed last summer from constantly checking his ATM balance in surprised disbelief. Yes, Paul, the check cleared.\n\nAndrei Kirilenko has yet to earn his paycheck in Utah, but at least he's healthy to start this season. All four of his potential backups—Kyle Korver, Matt Harping, C.J. Miles, and Ronnie Brewer—are injured so Andrei better be in shape to play the entire game.\n\nRonnie Price will play two-guard with a strained hamstring, and probably start. The other guard options are rookies Wes Mathews and Eric Maynor.\n\nMehmet Okur has been one of the pillars of the Jazz with his outside shooting, relative health, and improving post game. Post defense is still a weakness and Boozer actually makes him worse by getting in the way.\n\nOf all the problems the team has, none will destroy fan support faster than the impending embarrassment and failure of the rookie replacement for legendary Hot Rod Hundley...on the radio.\n\nFifth grade know-it-all David Locke has the forced enthusiasm of a porn star on her wedding night, the ear splitting timbre of an adolescent girl, and the \"well-formed\" opinions of a Sportscenter-addicted frat boy.\n\nDavid Locke has a sports radio talk show in Salt Lake City again after failing in the much larger and more sophisticated media market of Seattle or Portland or somewhere where franchises actually take pride in their representatives.\n\nHe claimed recently to diagnose Kyle Korver's injury prior to all the team doctors. He scooped the medical profession on that one. I'm not kidding, it's on his blog.\n\nDavid Locke should sign a Dish Network commission agreement because Jazz games on the radio are no longer an option. I will upgrade to get Fox Sports Rocky Mountain if they win a few games early. Otherwise I could plug my nose and pick up an interest in the NHL.\n\nAs a frustrated Jazz fan, I actually look forward to some creative lineups instead of Jerry Sloan's predictable and mediocre teams.\n\nI want to see Williams, Price, Milsap, Okur, and Koufos play together.\n\nI want to see Sloan suit up and run the pick and roll with a vampdragicornasuswolf in shorty shorts, but don't tell my wife about that one.\n\nI want to see Williams as a slashing wing. He can shoot outside and take you off the drive. Let someone else set pick and run plays for Carlos Loozer.\n\nI want to see Boozer traded for two clean jockstraps."
