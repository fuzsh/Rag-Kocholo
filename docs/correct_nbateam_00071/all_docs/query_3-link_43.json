        "text": "Kris,\n\nWelcome to the site. Let’s look at this the other way. Should Deron Williams have been an MVP candidate in 2008? Let’s focus on offense, because that’s most of what you and the MVP voters really seem to care about.\n\n(Why most people, including you, are ignoring the fact that Rose is at best an average defender and that Chicago is only an elite team because they’re so strong defensively, and that their improvement is mostly due to a 5-point improvement in D-rating is beyond me. But I’ll bite anyway).\n\nIgnoring PGs, how would you expect the 2008 Jazz tocompare offensively with the 2011 Bulls?\n\nUtah:\n\n-PG: Williams getting the lion’s share of minutes. A rotating cast of mediocre backups in Price, Giricek, and Hart spelling him for about 10 minutes/game.\n\n-Wings: AK and Brewer starting, getting about 30 minutes/game. Harping and Korver getting about 20 minutes, Miles getting about 10.\n\nPosts: A healthy Boozer and Okur. Millsap getting about 20 minutes a game. And a Collins brother getting 10. Which one, you ask? Does it matter?\n\nChicago:\n\nPG: Rose getting the lion’s share of minutes. Watson backing him for about 10 minutes/game.\n\nWings: Deng getting 40 minutes a game, with Bogans, Brewer and Korver getting each getting about 20 minutes a game.\n\nPosts: Factoring in injuries, Noah, Booze, Gibson all averaging about 22 minutes a game, Thomas 15, and Asik 10.\n\nBackup PGs are pretty much a wash.\n\nHey, look at that, both teams had Brewer and Korver! But both were much better offensively in Utah, scoring more efficiently, and in Brewer’s case more; I don’t see how that’s an argument in Rose’s favor, however. Deng and AK are pretty close on the offensive end, except that Deng plays 40 minutes/game to AK’s 30. Miles and Harping were effective enough spot shooters, both a bit better than Bogans, but not significantly. Overall, I’d say Utah’s wings were a bit better, but it’s because they wings that are playing with Chicago now played better when they were with Utah, but again, this doesn’t really seem like compelling evidence for the “Rose is MVP!” case.\n\nBigs-wise, Boozer was a bit better in 2008, probably due to health. He also played a lot more minutes. Okur was a good shooter, while Noah was suspect but better at every other aspect of the game. I’d give the nod to Noah. Thomas is a step below all of those guys, but at least can knock down a jumper. Millsap was a bit better than Gibson, but wasn’t anywhere near where he is today. Asik’s capable of finishing at the rim but not much else, but Collins was literally one of the worst offensive players in the league. The only reason he’s not the worst is because he has a twin who’s just as bad. I’ll give a decent nod to Utah. Really it all boils down to Thomas getting 15 minutes/game in lieu of Noah and Booze, and Booze and Noah being slightly diminished when playing. That’s a decent loss, but it would be pretty surprising to see it take more than a 3 point toll on the team’s efficiency.\n\nBoth had great coaches. Sloan is/was a HOF coach, and Thibs will definitely be a COY candidate, both rightly so. Slight nod to Sloan from me, but hard to go wrong with either. Both had/have great fans. Utah played in a much more competitive division.\n\nSo who would you expect to be better? And by how much?\n\nUtah: O-rating of 113.8, 1st in the league.\n\nChicago: O-Rating of 107.7, 13th in the league.\n\nA 6-point differential, the difference between an average team and an elite team.\n\nUtah is was hugely better offensively in 2008 than Chicago is now. It’s true I cherry-picked this season, partly because this was Utah’s best offensive season so would seem the most likely time for Williams to get MVP consideration, but also because Brewer/Korver/Booze played for both these teams. But you’re quite spoiled for choice; since William’s rookie season, with him as Utah’s PG the Jazz have been better offensively than the 2011 Bulls every single season.\n\nSo tell me, what makes Rose so different from Williams? And why again should Rose get the MVP? Or did Williams deserve it in 2008? Break it down for me.\n\nnerdnumbers,\n\nFirst, I don’t recall where I read the stat on Rose, (truehoops somewhere) but it gave the teams efg% when Rose passes out of isolation, and I figured it out based on the team’s efg%-Rose’s own shooting.\n\nThe question though, why does Rose shoot if his teammates are more likely to make the shot is a fair one. However, that doesn’t mean that there’s no response to it.\n\nFirst, it’s not just when he assists on isolation it’s when he passes. His usage% is about 31ish, which means that 69% of the time he does pass. That’s one of the misconceptions. Unlike shooting guards, he’s the principle ball handler so virtually every possession begins with him. If he’s passing out 65-70 percent of the time then that means he is passing first, not shooting first.\n\nSecond, his assist percentage is somewhere between 8th and 10th (depending on whatever happens day to day). His turnover rate is less that 15 percent. There’s only been one other player to ever have a usg over 30, assist % over 40 and t/o percentage under 15. The other was Wade a couple of years ago.\n\nPart of the problem with thinking about assist/turnover ratios is that it doesn’t take into account usage. Having the ball more is going to inherently result in a greater NUMBER of turnovers. If you take (usage % + assist % – t/o %)/ t/o % you get a more telling result which is a ratio of favorable outcomes to possessions/unfavorable. In that Dirk is tops, Rose is second. Considering the fact that Dirk is barely a ball handler that says something.\n\nAnyway, my point there is that the whole assist/turnover ratio thing is an overblown ratio that has less meaning than it might seem.\n\nAs far as why does he shoot so much, let me put it this way. Where I get bothered by people talking about this, let me ask you this. How many times have you heard Tom Thibodeau complain about Rose shooting too much? None. In fact Thibs designed the offense FOR him to shoot so much. Are you actually going to fault a player for being coached?\n\nSo now think about this. Thibs probably knows more about basketball than everyone who is commenting on this thread and writing the articles put together. He may know more about the game than any human being alive, and I’m actually not exaggerating.\n\nSo why do you think Thibs WANTS Rose to shoot so much if it is inefficient? The answer lies in the fact that it’s actually productive whether he’s scoring or not. The fact that he doesn’t score matters some, but not as much as he shoots.\n\nAnd believe me, I know that sounds like balderdash, but it’s counterintuitive. When Rose penetrates he breaks down defenses and causes them to collapse. He doesn’t just draw double teams, he draws triple teams and quadruple teams.\n\nIf teams don’t collapse on him, he’s going to be dunking every ball and his ORtg would be like 200. You have to double team him, or triple team him. If he never shoots or rarely shoots he’s not a threat. Teams don’t collapse on him, they don’t leave players wide open with enough time to watch the extended version of Avatar. That increased efg% by his teammates is a direct result of the threat of Rose getting to the rim.\n\nThat’s why Thibs wants Rose to shoot, because it’s the threat.\n\nBut there’s more to it than that. During the Pacers game the Bulls could have won in regulation when Rose passed it out to Korver for a wide open three. Korver didn’t take the shot but gave it back to Rose. After the game Rose privately told Korver (according to Korver) that the team needs him to take those shots.\n\nThat’s where the difference is between guys like Allen Iverson or Stephon Marberry and Derrick Rose is. Rose does it because he’s asked to, not in spite of the fact that he’s asked not to. Rose wants the team to benefit. They wanted to be heroes.\n\nThe whole post hoc ergo propter hoc kind of logic that goes into seeing a casual relationship between the numbers and assuming that means a same attitude is where people go wrong. There game was selfish. Rose’s game is selfless.\n\nOn the offensive rating thing, I’ll say that the reason that Rose is considered a candidate isn’t primarily his offense, it’s the Bulls winning. The obvious difference between them is that the Bulls have about 18 more wins.\n\nNow I understand that there are differing notions of what MVP means and what “value” means, but generally speaking being on an “elite” team is sort of an essential. People aren’t basing a Rose candidacy on the 24 and 8, they are supporting it with that.\n\nHaving said that let me say this also. When Rose literally hit the tapes to figure out what was wrong with his game to get to the line more often, he figured something out. He was going in to fast and he wasn’t getting the calls because of that.\n\nSince then he’s been averaging better than two and a half more free throw attempts per game, and he’s elevated his FT% by 10%. Since then the Bulls ORtg has been 111.2, up from 105.4 at that time.\n\nNow there’s obviously more at play than just that there, but strictly based on that, it’s about three more points per 100 possessions the Bulls added onto their ORtg.\n\nAnd while people talk about how the Heat needed to figure out how to play together and all that they don’t take into account the same is true for the Bulls who added more new pieces than Miami. And the Bulls have had Boozer and Noah playing musical chairs with injuries, which that more than anything has been slowing down the offense.\n\nSince the break, the Bulls offense has begun to really find itself. Their ORtg since then is a whopping 113.5 and their defense has maintained it’s usually stellar play.\n\nIf you haven been noticing it wasn’t that long ago the Bulls were 23rd on Offense. That they’re 12th right now is pretty telling. It’s interesting that people who use stats as a model and then put forth Howard don’t make the same argument against him. The Bulls have a better ORtg and a better DRtg than Orlando.\n\nAs far as Derrick’s contributions on defense, I don’t get why people are so adamant that the Bulls defense is in spite of him and not because of him. I can say this. I went to synergy and entered the points per play against of every starting guard in the NBA. Derrick Rose’s was the lowest of anyone. He was also the fourth lowest of any of the top 100 players in PER.\n\nSo is that definitive proof that he’s one of the top defensive players? It probably should be. It would be if it were Chris Paul or Deron Williams but people dismiss that because it’s Derrick Rose. Let’s just say that he is playing 38 minutes a game on the best defensive team in the NBA at the most important position. Do you really think he doesn’t have something to do with the defense?\n\nSo anyway, what I’m getting at is that there’s a much better statistical argument for Rose than “24 and 8.” Theres a certain smell test to things and when you see someone making an argument that Lowrey is better than Rose it doesn’t pass it.\n\nPeople need to set aside their myopic obsession with “efficiency.” I understand the principles behind it, but clearly the Bulls are winning. Clearly they are becoming a highly effective offense and adding that on to their stellar defense. If the whole notion of why efficiency is so important is that it helps you win, and the Bulls are winning with Derrick Rose being “inefficient” maybe people need to stop arguing that Derrick Rose isn’t helping the Bulls win and start wondering why. They need to question the paradigm, not the reality.\n\nPhilip,\n\nWay to just ignore the stats that you don’t support your case. If my position were that Rose is the only player in the league who draws double teams then you’d have a really good point. It seems you like to build strawmen.\n\nThe argument isn’t that he’s unique in that regard, the argument is that that’s the way the offense is designed to work and it actually does work that way. The “inefficiency” argument revolves around him shooting “too” much. But he does what he’s supposed to do and plays the way he’s coached to play.\n\nThe same goes for his not gambling on defense. Are you going to assert that you know more about defenses than Thibodeau? That’s what it seems the Rose-is-not-MVPs seem to overlook. Rose is doing what he’s coached to do.\n\nYou say that Rose “has trouble” fighting through screens. That’s no longer true. It’s one of the things he’s greatly improved on this year. First, teams set an amazing number of picks on the guy, it’s 49% of the time. Second, they score only 33.6% of the time when they do so. So, you’re argument that he’s “mediocre” falls very flat. He’s way the heck above average.\n\nThird, another strawman on the “everyone is so terrible” argument. I never argued that they were terrible. Why do you have to argue “with” things I haven’t said? It’s fallacious.\n\nBut let me ask you this? Why does it matter? Those who prop up the whole “the rest of his team is good too” argument overlook a couple of things. First, was Kobe’s team good when he won? Was Garnett’s team good when he won? Pretty much the only one who won with horrible teammates is James, and you can’t say that any more. How many of the top candidates are the only All-Star on their team though?\n\nFinally you assess that the reason that Chicago’s playing together is a result of the rest of the team playing better and Noah and Boozer playing together. Does it not occur to you that you prove my argument when you’re saying that. That’s precisely my point.\n\nThe rest of the team is starting to gel and now they have Noah and Boozer playing on the team. That PROVES that the Rose has actually been carrying the offense through most of the season. Have you noticed that since they’ve been playing better Rose’s shots have gone down? His efficiency has gone up.\n\nI agree that some people take too much credit away from the rest of the team, but some want to use that argument to take too much of the credit away from Rose. The rest of the team is good. Rose makes them very good.\n\nKelly,\n\nWhat stats am I ignoring? The main stats that you’re presenting is that Rose’s efficiency has slightly improved due to improved foul drawing and shooting, and that the Chicago offense has vastly improved.\n\nI agree with you about turnovers – considering his usage rate, his turnover rate is acceptable. My apologies for not addressing this.\n\nI don’t want to get into defense too much, so I won’t go any farther. Can we agree that Rose is a decent-to-good defender, but that it’s other player’s on Chicago that are what makes the Bulls’s defense elite?\n\nThe “he does what his coach tells him to do” and “he’s selfless” arguments aren’t stats.\n\n“That increased efg% by his teammates is a direct result of the threat of Rose getting to the rim.”\n\nWhat players have an increased efg% since joining the Bulls? I checked out players’ 5-year averages. Boozer’s, Brewer’s and Korver’s have all declined. Bogans’s and Thomas’s have gone up. Considering that the former three shoot a lot more than the latter two, I’d say the evidence points to Rose having a negative effect on his teammates’ efficiency.\n\nEveryone else has been with the Bulls for their entire careers, so it’s impossible to differentiate their playing with Rose from any other factor about playing for the Bulls. This year, Gibson has declined. Noah has stayed the same. Deng has improved. Again, no evidence to point to Rose having an overall positive or negative impact. (Watson’s has declined sharply, but he doesn’t play many minutes with Rose).\n\nIncidentally, the many, many faults of “player X improves his teammates’ efficiency” was addressed in “The Melo Effect”. Even then, at least Melo’s teammates’ had shown undeniable improvement in their TS% while playing for the Nuggets with Melo. You can’t say that for any of the current Bulls.\n\n“The rest of the team is starting to gel and now they have Noah and Boozer playing on the team. That PROVES that the Rose has actually been carrying the offense through most of the season. Have you noticed that since they’ve been playing better Rose’s shots have gone down? His efficiency has gone up.”\n\nImagine you’re working on a chilli recipe. Your recipe is pretty so-so; the salt, pepper, cumin, parsley, etc just isn’t cutting it. Whenever you manage to get a bit of dark chocolate or cinnamon, your chilli is a lot better, but you never have both and rarely have as much of either as you’d prefer. You splash out and get rock salt. Your salt is a bit better, but not by much. Then you manage to get a large supply of both dark chocolate and cinnamon, add both, and your chilli is pretty good.\n\nWould you say, “Wow, the rock salt really did the trick!”\n\nOr would you think that the change from sea salt to rock was a small part of the improvement, and that the main change was due to adding two completely new ingredients?\n\nBecause you’re basically saying that adding two new ingredients PROVES that the third ingredient, which is more or less the same and that was already there in the first place is the reason the chilli improved.\n\n“Third, another strawman on the “everyone is so terrible” argument. I never argued that they were terrible. Why do you have to argue “with” things I haven’t said? It’s fallacious.”\n\nMy apologies, I mistakenly took it to be implicit to your argument.\n\nMy thinking is this: either Rose’s teammates are really good and they deserve more credit than they’re getting for Chicago’s record, or his teammates aren’t that good and Chicago has such a good record because of Rose, the deserving MVP. It’s a pretty straightforward dichotomy.\n\nLet me ask this – why isn’t there any love for Duncan or Ginobli as MVP? Because people rightly acknowledge that they’re great players, but the reason the Spurs have the best record in the league is because their complementary players are so good.\n\n“But let me ask you this? Why does it matter? Those who prop up the whole “the rest of his team is good too” argument overlook a couple of things. First, was Kobe’s team good when he won? Was Garnett’s team good when he won? Pretty much the only one who won with horrible teammates is James, and you can’t say that any more. How many of the top candidates are the only All-Star on their team though?”\n\nKobe didn’t deserve his MVP. Garnett’s and James’s teammates were all vastly inferior to D Rose’s the year that they won theirs. If Rose was as good as either of those two during their MVP years (or even this year), Chicago would be winning 65+ games and be an overwhelming favorite. As it stands, they’re a great team, and have as good a chance as anyone to win the championship this year, but they’re not head-and-shoulders above the competition they would be with a player like James or Garnett in lieu of Rose.\n\n“The rest of the team is good. Rose makes them very good.”\n\nAgreed. Rose does make them better. But the improvement is probably from about a 52-win team to a 60-win team. That’s good. But that’s not MVP-worthy."
