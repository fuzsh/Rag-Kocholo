        "text": "Kyle Korver didn't play a lot in his debut for the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.\n\nBut the veteran wing player showed how he can be a game-changer with a two-minute sequence near the end of the second quarter of the Bucks’ 133-99 exhibition victory over the Utah Jazz.\n\nKorver hit 3 three-pointers as Milwaukee ballooned its lead from 47-38 to 61-42 just before halftime. Those were Korver's only shots in his 10 minutes of action.\n\nThat was the vision when the team signed the 38-year-old sharpshooter in the offseason.\n\n“Yes, he can’t miss a shot,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “We’ll see if he can keep that going.”\n\nKorver’s first three-pointer in a Bucks uniform was one of the game's highlights, with Giannis Antetokounmpo finding him at the top of the key with a no-look pass.\n\n“Didn’t see it coming at all,\" Korver said. \"I was just like ‘Oh, there’s the ball.' I didn’t know this about him: He is a very willing and very talented passer.\n\n“He’s just going to keep on getting better at that. It’s one of the things as he continues to feel the game and feel the defense people throw at him, he’s going to keep getting better at that. It’s exciting for us.”\n\nAntetokounmpo also had an assist on Korver’s second three-pointer after an offensive rebound.\n\n“He’s just such a great shooter and it felt like they all came in a little bit different ways,” Budenholzer said. “Sometimes the offensive-rebound, kick-out three can really be a momentum changer.”\n\nAntetokounmpo was clearly looking to set up Korver in their first game playing together.\n\n“Having Kyle on the team is a weapon,” Antetokounmpo said. “Especially when coming down in transition and you’re able to locate him, you got to pass the ball. If he’s open, you got to pass the ball.\n\n\"He’s one of the best shooters to ever play the game. Obviously, I have to keep my head up, not just looking for Kyle, looking for everybody.”\n\nThe chemistry wasn’t perfect. Antetokounmpo also threw a low pass that didn’t put Korver in shooting position in the corner. The familiarity only comes with game reps.\n\n“What I learned (Wednesday) is whenever I drive the ball, he moves,” Antetokounmpo said. “(That’s) something I didn’t know about him. When you’re in training camp, you’re not always on the same team. You don’t always get to play a lot of minutes with him.\n\n“He moves &mldr; I’ve got to keep my head up and pass it so he can go get it. Because if I pass it to where he is at the time, it’s going to be a bad pass.”\n\nKorver knows the fit will be there. Antetokounmpo, the reigning NBA most valuable player, attracts the eyes of the defense and Korver needs only a sliver of space for a shot with his quick-trigger release.\n\n“It’s just something I hope we keep getting better at,” Korver said. “I think there’s a lot of opportunity, potential for a lot of things on the break. We have a lot of shooters, a lot of guys that command attention.\n\n“Obviously he’s so good at putting his head down, getting to the basket if guys aren’t loaded up to him. It’s really hard to stop him. It’ll be fun for me to find spots to get open.”\n\nBudenholzer also pointed out that the 6-foot-7 Korver can offer a little more than just shooting.\n\n“All the little things he does,” Budenholzer said. “Competing and screening. Getting hits on the defensive boards. I think we’re really excited about how he is going to make us better this year.”"
