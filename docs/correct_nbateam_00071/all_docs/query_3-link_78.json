        "text": "Investing in titles is necessary in sports. It gives a barometer, a basis of comparison and pays proper due to those who achieve at the highest levels. However because of this, they also serve as a measuring stick, a way to hold individuals accountable for what and who they are; it plays directly into the “With great power comes great responsibility” adage. In this year’s NBA Playoffs, the vast majority of the most decorated players factored into the final four teams standing: three of five All-NBA first teamers, three of five second teamers, the scoring champ, the Coach of the Year of the de facto #1 overall team in the entire Playoffs by record and last but not least, the league’s Most Valuable Player. There was no lack of well decorated star power on TV nightly, but what does it lead to? What does it say about what is to actually be? Do the awards and honors win games?\n\nThe answer is absolutely not, and there has not been a bigger overall example of this than watching the cases of two of the league’s top 10 stars, who combined to lead their clubs to a total of 2 wins (one each) in both conference championship series, in Kevin Durant and Derrick Rose.\n\nLet’s rewind a bit on both of these guys to frame them correctly. Rose took home this season’s MVP honors after leading the Chicago Bulls to surprisingly finishing with the league’s best record and moving himself into the upper echelon of players in the game. Durant on the other hand won his second consecutive scoring title while continuing to take the Oklahoma City Thunder to the new levels of success that were widely predicted for them. Everything is coming together perfectly for both of them, right? Well…there’s more.\n\nPlayoff time, and the spotlight that comes with it. A lot of things became a lot clearer in the light. Among them, one fact started to reveal itself over time, and then became very clear on repeat: these guys don’t know what they’re into anymore. It looks like the same game, but the other guys are going about it a lot different than they did a few months ago. There are no more Sunday afternoon showcase games against the guys they grew up watching to get up for, followed by a chance to relax a bit and wipe out the bottom feeders on a Wednesday night game in Minnesota or Golden State. No, every night is a big and with each tipoff of each game in each series, they set a new record for longevity in their young careers.\n\nThere emerges the keyword in why neither of them is still playing this morning: young. The NBA is the youngest professional sports league in America, so its premier players will emerge earlier than any other sports’. While Rose and Durant are both charged with being the face of their franchise and living up to the expectations that their acknowledgements have landed them, in the end they are still two guys that haven’t reached their 23rd birthdays yet. However, they are charged with carrying the burdens that many most seasoned players have raised to a great standard, albeit at much more advanced stages in their lives and experiences. The MVP/Champion has come to be defined by names like Jordan, Olajuwon, O’Neal, Magic and Duncan. However, an MVP hasn’t won the NBA Finals since 2003 when Timmy pulled it off, but should it discredit the work that Kobe, Dirk and Nash did on the road to the honor? No, they balled, got there squads to where they should have and were beasts in the process. Should Durant’s career, despite him being the youngest two-time scoring champ ever, be derailed by the expectations set before him? Well of course not. The plain fact is that both are in a place where there is no historical standard for the early achievement they have reached, so holding them to a condition in the development of them as players, just by what accolades they have gotten already is a skewed way of viewing their shortcomings now.\n\nToday’s NBA is different than any other point, with young impact players leading the way, but in the end, the status quo still stands up: experience wins games. The ironic thing about situation that Rose and Durant find themselves in is that the very example of what could be next for them is unfolding in front of their eyes (a little too close in the case of young Mr. Rose) in a certain highly debated forward in Miami. LeBron James won back-to-back MVPs in Cleveland and was a 164 game sensation in 2009 and 2010, before being wiped out in the Playoffs. During this run he was 23 and 24 years old, and took a world of honors and expectation along with him. But he didn’t have the gut or know how to finish it out. Fast forward a year later, and he’s quickly replacing any question marks from his immediate past trappings of his youth with periods.\n\nWhy? Because he’s been through and felt the pain of the losses that Rose and Durant are taking for the first time. Many great talents haven’t broken through after reaching a certain summit, but one thing that’s for sure is we’ve never seen anyone reach them so soon the way the Thunder and Bulls’ franchise kids have. Stay tuned, next year’s episode of this same program will have the same two characters with much different scripts in hand, and most importantly, season finales.\n\nNow we are getting into the meat of it all, where there are some timeless and unique players in the mix that were (and are) among the elite of their various generations. Of the 10 players in this section there are six scoring champions, with more than 10 total titles between them. There are a total of 19 championship rings between this group, yet there are several of the greatest players who never reached the pinnacle of the sport. However, amongst those that are ringless, there is a total of 4 MVP awards between them, so did they really get shortchanged?\n\nBasically, this is just a showing of how real its about to get in the rest of this countdown, as this is the first section in the lower 30. There are players that aren’t just average “greats”, but there are some of the best players that ever picked the ball up, including the first star in League history and one of it’s most phenomenal talents now.\n\nI won’t delay any further, but just know it’s getting down to clutch time in the CHEAP SEATS’ countdown here.\n\n30. ALLEN IVERSON-Shooting Guard-1996 to 2009-Philadelphia 76ers, Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 26.7 ppg, 6.2 apg, 2.2 spg, .425 FG%\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: MVP (’01), 11 x All-Star, 3 x All-NBA, 3 x All-NBA 2nd, Rookie of the Year (’96), 2 x All-Star MVP\n\nTHE +/-: The greatest small scorer ever….who never played with quite enough to make it over the top\n\nDespite standing six feet on a tall day, Iverson was one of the most dominant scorers in the history of the game. Perhaps no player ever played with more heart than Iverson, who routinely did in much larger players, and often at the expense of his own body. His career points per game stand at sixth all-time, and he increased that average to 29.7 in the playoffs, good for second all-time. Using his blazing speed and fearless, unrelenting attack, he won four scoring titles. Far from a one trick threat, he averaged over seven assists in seven different seasons, and has the 12th most steals in history.\n\n29. LeBRON JAMES-Small Forward-2003 to Present-Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavs\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 27.7 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 7 apg, 1.7 spg, .479 FG %\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 2 x MVP (’09, ’10), 7 x All-Star, 4 x All-NBA, 2 x All-NBA 2nd, 2 x All-Defense, Rookie of the Year (’04)\n\nTHE +/-: Incomparable guard/forward athlete….that has not been able to close what he starts yet\n\nHe is powerful at 6’8 and 270 lbs, yet possesses the speed and court vision of a guard, LeBron James is truly unlike any player to date. An unprecedented amount of attention heralded his road to the NBA, and wasted no time in making an impact. His all-around skill set has allowed him to compile 34 triple-doubles at age 26. No other player has averaged 27 points, 7 rebounds and 7 assists per game in their career, as he is currently doing. He has set several “youngest ever” records for his career achievements thus far, including being the youngest player to ever reach 15,000 points. His controversial move from Cleveland to Miami has been a highly debated move that will put a high level of pressure on him to continually deliver on the promise he has shown.\n\n28. DAVID ROBINSON-Center-1987 to 2003-San Antonio Spurs\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 21.1 ppg, 10.6 rpg, 3 bpg, 2.5 apg, 1.4 spg, .510 FG %\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 2 Championships, MVP (’95), 10 x All-Star, 4 x All-NBA, 4 x All-Defensive, Rookie of the Year (’89), Defensive Player of the Year (’92)\n\nTHE +/-: Quick for a big man and amazing shot blocker….that could never win the big game as the primary guy\n\n“The Admiral” had his NBA debut delayed for two years due to real military service, but when he arrived in the league in 1989 he made up for lost time in a hurry. As this career progressed, Robinson used his combination of quickness and left-handed deceptiveness to dominate on both ends of the court. He once scored 71 points in a single game, and also had 10 games where he blocked ten or more shots. Displaying his all-around talents, he notched a quadruple-double with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 blocks in 1994. He is also one of 2 players to ever lead the NBA in points, rebounds, and blocks at a point in his career.\n\n27. ELVIN HAYES-Power Forward-1968 to 1984-Houston/San Diego Rockets, Baltimore/Washington Bullets\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 21 ppg, 12.5 rpg, 2 bpg, 1 spg, .452 FG %\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 1 Championship, 12 x All-Star, 3 x All-NBA, 3 x All-NBA 2nd\n\nTHE +/-: First high scoring pure power forward in the game….but rarely gave much more than was needed\n\nGreat scoring big man who was too fast for centers to stick with, yet too big for most forwards as well. He scored 54 points in November of his rookie season, which remained a career high. For the rest of that rookie season he averaged 28.4 points and 17.1 rebounds. He became the first player to lead the NBA rebounds besides Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain since 1957 when he averaged 16.9 in his second year. Later, Hayes joined Wes Unseld in Baltimore and formed one of the most dominant front court combos ever, leading the Bullets to three Finals. His 27, 313 points are the 8th most in history, and his 16,279 rebounds are the fourth most in history.\n\n26. GEORGE MIKAN-Center-1946 to 1956-Minneapolis Lakers\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 23.1 ppg, 13.4 rpg, 2.8 apg, .404 FG %\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 5 Championships, 4 x All-Star\n\nTHE +/-: The first great player in NBA history….that never played against anyone who could match his ability\n\nGeorge Mikan is the pioneering figure in the beginning of the NBA. He innovated many post moves and tactics that have continued to be utilized underneath the rim. He was a fierce competitor who used his size to aggressively make his presence felt over mostly undersized comp. Presence around the rim was so great that it forced several rule changes that now define the game, including a widened key, the goaltender rule and the shot clock. Later as commissioner of the ABA, he created the three-point line. He was three-time scoring champ and was voted the greatest player of the first half-century.\n\n25. ISIAH THOMAS-Point Guard-1981 to 1994-Detroit Pistons\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 19.2 ppg, 9.3 apg, 1.9 spg, .452 FG%\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 2 Championships, 12 x All-Star, 3 x All-NBA, 2 x All-NBA 2nd, Finals MVP (’90), 2 x All-Star MVP\n\nTHE +/-: Hard-nosed leader who defined some of the toughest teams ever….but was often over the “dirty” borderline\n\nKnown for both being a dazzling ball handler and distributor, as well as the leader of the some of the toughest teams in NBA history in the “Bad Boy” Detroit Pistons of the late 80’s/early 90s. His 9,061 assists are the seventh most of all time, and his 9.6 average is fifth best ever. “Zeke” is one also one of the greatest scoring point guards ever, he averaged over 20 points five consecutive times and only once did less than 15 points per night.\n\n24. KEVIN GARNETT-Power Forward-1995 to Present-Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 19.5 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 4.1 apg, 1.5 bpg, 1.3 spg, .498 FG%\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 1 Championship, MVP (’04), 14 x All-Star, 4 x All-NBA, 3 x All-NBA 2nd, 8 x All-Defense, Defensive Player of the Year (’08)\n\nTHE +/-: Multi-talented seven footer with rare intensity….that wasted many of his best years with terrible teams\n\nHe has the height of a center, the athleticism of a small forward and rolls them both into skills no other power forward has had. He is one of the best defenders to ever play the game, and long disruptive presence all across the floor. He led the resurgence of high school-to-pros draft picks when he came in to the league as the first such player to do so in 20 years. He has since gone on to become the only player to average 20 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists for nine consecutive seasons, as well as being the only player to reach 20,000 points, 11,000 rebounds, 4,000 assists, 1,500 blocks, and 1,200 steals in his career.\n\n23. RICK BARRY-Small Forward-1965 to 1979-San Francisco/Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 24.8 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 4.9 apg, 2 spg, .456 FG%, .893 free throw %\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 1 Championships, 8 x All-Star, 5 x All-NBA, Rookie of the Year (’66), Finals MVP (’75)\n\nTHE +/-: Propelled several underdog teams to overachieve….but was often too will to do it all himself\n\nAn elite forward who made a seamless transition from high scoring shooter to ball distributing point forward. Over his first 9 seasons he only averaged less than 25 points once, with a high of 35.6 in his second year. On the flip side, he averaged better than six assists a night 5 of his final 7 seasons. He is one of the most accurate shooters of all-time, and is especially regarded for his underhand free throw shooting style, that was still highly successful (second most accurate free throw shooter ever). In the 1967 Finals, he averaged 40.8 points per game, including a 55-point performance.\n\n22. SCOTTIE PIPPEN-Small Forward-1987 to 2004-Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, Portland Trailblazers\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 16.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 5.2 apg, 2 spg, .473 FG%\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: 6 Championships, 7 x All-Star, 3 x All-NBA, 8 x All-Defense\n\nTHE +/-: The greatest defensive forward of all-time….who could never get out the shadow of Jordan himself\n\nWhile he may be known as the greatest “sidekick” in basketball history, not many lead men have been better than Pip was. Matter of fact, during Jordan’s brief retirement, he made two of his three consecutive All-NBA first teams. Capable of guarding any position on the floor, he was named to 10 consecutive All-Defensive teams, with 8 being first teams. He was the primary ball handler on offense for the lethal Chicago Bulls triangle offense, and often deferred points to set up teammates. He has more steals (2,037) than any forward ever, and is one of three players to have 200 steals and 100 blocks in one season.\n\n21. CHARLES BARKLEY-Power Forward-1984 to 2000-Philadelphia 76ers, Phoenix Suns, Houston Rockets\n\nTHE NUMBERS: 22.1 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 3.9 apg, 1.5 spg, .541 FG%\n\nTHE HONOR ROLL: MVP (’93), 11 x All-Star, 5 x All-NBA, 5 x All-NBA 2nd, All-Star MVP\n\nTHE +/-: The best undersized power forward ever….who never could get the ring as the star or contributor\n\nWith a personality that was bigger than even his waistline, it’s easy to forget how much of a killer Chuck was on the court. But make no bones about it, despite being barely 6’5, he is one of the greatest overall forwards of all-time. He was especially dangerous on the offensive boards, which he led the league in for three consecutive seasons in Philly. He could run the floor, create on the move and finish hard at the rim. He average less than 10 rebounds a game once in his career, and from 1987 to 1996 he averaged less than 23 points per game once. There was a lot of action backing up those loud words.\n\nFor more and follow-up on this piece, follow me on Twitter at @CheapSeatFan\n\nThe NBA’s 60th All-Star Game kicks off in a few hours in Los Angeles & it’s going to be an interesting mix. This year the Celtics & Heat, with a few selected outside friends, will take on the Western Conference in what I feel is the best superstar exhibition in sports. Baseball’s game can sometimes not have the exact matchup you want to see if a pitcher isn’t in the game yet & misses the best batter available (Halladay & Pujols had a combined 1 showdowns in ASG play until Doc ruined it & came to the NL to play with Albert). As for the Pro Bowl….we played better intramural football, with more contact, than they play in that game. And the NHL’s version of the ASG comes on Versus, a network where I’m sure Terrance & Phillip, of South Park fame, are the announcers.\n\nSo all the pressure falls on the NBA to give us a great product of it’s best stars going head to head. Where the most manufactured rivalry in sports (Kobe vs. LeBron) is rightfully contested, in the exhibition in was created in. Where there will be some And 1 mixtape-level plays from some of the best handlers in the game, and if were lucky, maybe the Carmelo drama will be decided & he gets traded at halftime and plays the second half for the East!\n\nAt any rate, predicting a winner in the ASG is pointless, so I’ll go with what I really want to see: unique matchups. Here are a few five man pairings I want to see Gregg Popovich & Doc Rivers run out after the starters have their go at it.\n\nBlake Griffin, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Russell Westbrook & Chris Paul for the West as the “We May Throw an Oop From Anywhere” squad: This is the most athletic team the West can run out there, with two sprinters in the backcourt & a frontcourt that could dunk on the Statue of Liberty under the rim. Let get this going early in the 2nd quarter Pop.\n\nLeBron James & the Celtics for the East: I like this squad for a few two simple reasons:\n\n1) It could be the biggest freeze out job since Isiah took a young Jordan out the mix in ’85 & it would be hilarious to see LeBron’s reaction if he grabs a rebound.\n\n2) Doc could take the race for the East #1 seed into their his own hands & put all four Celtics into the game at once and have them gang stomp LeBron as he’s by himself. That would set a great rematch chance for Vince McMahon to cash in on at WrestleMania next month.\n\nKobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan, Pau Gasol with Russell Westbrook for the West as the “We Are Old As Hell, Take Us Off the Court With This Young Fella” squad: This is far from Kobe, Duncan, Dirk or Pau’s first ASG rodeo, and while they’ll play the critical moments (if there are such a thing in these games), they probably won’t be going overly hard to prove anything. The same can’t be said for the dynamo that is Westbrook, who is in his first ASG & it’s back home where he made his college bones. It would be comedy to see Dirk & Duncan trying to get back up the court to play off of Westbrook as he gets his Usain Bolt on with each in bound pass.\n\nLeBron, Dwyane Wade, Joe Johnson, Chris Bosh & Amare Stoudemire for the East as the “Weren’t We All Supposed to be Knicks By Now?” team:\n\nThis summer we all remember how somehow all 10 premier free agents were supposed to get max contracts and revive the Knicks to prominance they haven’t achieved since the 1970’s, yet are still expected to have? Yeah, well I guess 1 game is better than none & maybe they can borrow Carmelo for a minute and run some 6-on-4 to give Knick fans the full fantasy experience. Why not?\n\nLeBron, Wade, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce & Ray Allen vs. Duncan, Kobe, Dirk, Paul & Gasol in the “We Are All Going to Springfield sooner or later” matchup: Seriously though, the All-Star game gives a great chance to see the historic greats matchup against each other. While some of these guys are already locks for the Hall of Fame, while others have more work to do, all 10 of these fellas have a more than likely chance of receiving a career’s greatest honor when they are done. Put them all out there at once & show the youngers that even though they are among the 24 best in the game now, they still have a ways to go before they are where these guys are.\n\n(more…)"
