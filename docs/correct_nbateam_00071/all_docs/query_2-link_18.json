        "text": "Kyle Korver is getting another shot with a contender.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have traded Korver, one of the best deep outside shooters in NBA history, to the Utah Jazz. In exchange for Korver, the Cavs will get guard Alec Burks — and his expiring contract — along with two future second-round draft picks. Both teams officially announced the trade Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe picks the Cavs are receiving in the deal are Utah’s own 2020 second round pick and a 2021 second round pick from the Washington Wizards via the Jazz.\n\n“Kyle’s on-court accomplishments are well known,” Cavaliers GM Koby Altman said in a statement. “More importantly, though, Kyle is a great person and teammate. He sets an example in everything he does. His work ethic, character and dependability are all at a very special level and something we will always respect and be thankful for. We wish Kyle and his family the best as he continues his career back in Salt Lake City.”\n\nThe trade was first reported by ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski as well as several other media outlets on Wednesday.\n\nIn Burks, the Cavs get his expiring contract worth $11.2 million — something they might be able to use in another deal.\n\nThe Cavs fell to 4-16 after losing Wednesday to the Oklahoma City Thunder. They began this season thinking they could compete for a playoff spot while developing young players, but after a coaching change and rash of injuries, Cleveland’s priorities have shifted and the team decided it was time ship Korver elsewhere.\n\nKorver was one of the most coveted players on the market, and the Cavs have been shopping him along with forward J.R. Smith, who agreed to step away from the team after being unhappy with his reduced role this season.\n\nThe 37-year-old Korver is headed back to Utah, where he played from 2007-10. At just 10-12 after Wednesday night’s win in Brooklyn, the Jazz have been a disappointment so far. But Korver’s range should open the floor for point guard Donovan Mitchell and others.\n\nKorver has made 2,238 career 3-pointers, fourth-most in NBA history and tops among current players.\n\nThe 27-year-old Burks has battled injuries over the past few seasons. He’s averaging 8.4 points and 15.8 minutes this season.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."
