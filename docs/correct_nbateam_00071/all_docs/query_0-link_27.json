        "text": "The Jazz continue to struggle at an unrecognizable pace.\n\nAfter dropping their 12th straight game in Golden State last night, 118-110, the Jazz are 4 games from a merciful ending to the season.\n\nOnce 26-26 on the year, the Jazz have unfolded like a paper tiger with a record of 29-49 on the season.\n\nAs the losses mount, Jazz fans will tell you its not about the wins and losses, but moreso about the development of the youth.\n\nKeyonte George, Taylor Hendricks and so on provide the only sustenance for Jazz fans to consume when watching a game.\n\nLast nights scheduled loss was another example of a team defeat but a solid individual performance from a young player.\n\nIt wasn’t Hendricks, Sensabaugh, or George with the highest scoring mark, but rather Johnny Juzang who poured in a career high 27 points on 9/12 shooting.\n\nThe former UCLA guard went 7/8 from downtown in a career high 33 minutes.\n\nJuzang is in his 2nd year in the association, both spent with Utah, as an undrafted free agent who has been on consecutive two-way contracts.\n\nThis is Johnny’s 16th appearance of the season and his 34th in a Jazz uniform as the majority of his career has been spent with the Salt Lake City Stars where he was putting up 19.3 PPG on 43.7 percent shooting and 32 percent from deep.\n\nLast night was a step in the right direction in determining whether or not Juzang could deliver at the highest level consistently, and a unique sight for Jazz fans who are hoping to see any sign of positivity.\n\nWhether Juzang ever replicates this type of performance again is to be determined, but his mark will always stand in the Utah Jazz history books.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to have fun with this season, please enjoy this list of players that Johnny Juzang has outscored in a single regular season game while wearing a Jazz uniform;\n\n(To clarify, this list is notable guards who, during their time in Utah, never scored as much as Johnny Juzang did last night)\n\n(The Players career high with the Jazz will be posted next to their name, VIA StatMuse)\n\nBRYON RUSSELL: 25 points VS Minnesota in 2002.\n\nRONNIE BREWER: 26 points VS Sacramento in 2009.\n\nRAJA BELL: 26 points AT LOS ANGELES LAKERS IN 2004\n\nKRIS DUNN: 26 points AT LOS ANGELES LAKERS IN 2023.\n\nHOWARD EISLEY: 23 Points AT PHOENIX IN 2005.\n\nDANTE EXUM: 22 Points AT OKLAHOMA CITY in 2017.\n\nDEREK FISHER: 23 Points VS LOS ANGELES LAKERS IN 2007.\n\nKYLE KORVER: 27 Points AT DENVER IN 2008. (Yes, I know, technically this is a tie with Juzang, but still worth noting.)\n\nEARL WATSON: 14 Points VS NEW ORLEANS IN 2011.\n\nJAMAAL TINSLEY: 15 points VS DENVER in 2012.\n\nRAUL NETO: 22 Points AT BROOKLYN IN 2017.\n\nRONNIE PRICE: 16 POINTS VS MILWAUKEE IN 2008.\n\nIf you didn’t know what to talk about pertaining to the Jazz prior to this article, I hope this helps carry a conversation about one of the hardest teams to watch in all of basketball right now."
