        "text": "For the second week in a row, the Cleveland Cavaliers have parted ways with a veteran shooting guard. Just hours before the wine and gold take on the Oklahoma City Thunder, reports surfaced that Kyle Korver has been traded.\n\nThe Cavaliers are sending Korver to a familiar place, Salt Lake City, Utah. It will mark the second time Korver has played for the Utah Jazz. He played in Utah from 2007 thru 2010.\n\nIn return, the Cavaliers will receive a pair of second round picks and guard Alec Burks. The deal is expected to officially go through on Thursday once the league approves it.\n\nThe second round picks are in 2020 and 2021. Itâ€™s very likely that those two second will picks will go to the Atlanta Hawks to complete the deal the Cavaliers made to receive Korver in 2017 unless the Cavaliers draft outside of the top ten in 2019 or 2020.\n\nKorver finished sixth in three point shooting percentage last season. He is averaging 6.8 points per game this season.\n\nKorver will provide the Jazz some much needed scoring help. Utah is a disappointing 9-14 so far this season. The Jazz are currently 14th in the Western Conference standings.\n\nBurks is averaging 8.4 points per game this season. The number 12 overall pick in 2011 has never lived up to expectations with the Jazz. Burks is averaging 9.6 points per game for his seven year NBA career.\n\nMore trades could be on the horizon. Cleveland is attempting to trade fellow shooting guard J.R. Smith. The Cavaliers announced last week that Smith will not play any more games in a wine and gold uniform. Cleveland is also looking to trade veteran point guard George Hill so rookie Collin Sexton can get more playing time.\n\nThis marks the second trade this calendar year between the two teams. The Cavaliers sent Jae Crowder to the Jazz for Rodney Hood back in February."
