        "text": "The Atlanta Hawks are hiring a familiar face to a front office role for next season, as the team will be bringing in former player Kyle Korver as the organization's director of player affairs and development, they announced Wednesday. Korver spent five seasons as a member of the Hawks from 2012-2017 and earned his lone All-Star nod with the team in 2015. He retired in 2021 and most recently served as a player development coach for the Brooklyn Nets last season.\n\nKorver will assist in creating and overseeing a development plan for each Hawks player in partnership with the coaches, athletic performance team and front office. Korver shot 42.9 percent from 3-point range over his 17-year career, which ranks 10th in league history, right above Steve Nash and Stephen Curry. He spent time on six different teams over his career, where he remained a dangerous sharpshooter until he retired.\n\nAs a player development coach with the Nets last season, he began working with All-Star guard Ben Simmons to help him with his jump shot. Prior to that, Korver helped two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo with his jump shot as well during his time playing for the Bucks. Giannis praised Korver for his coaching and shooting tips, and called him \"one of the best shooters to ever play the game.\"\n\nWhile the Hawks don't exactly have anyone on the roster in need of fixing their jump shot, Korver's knowledge of the game and experience in the league will be beneficial to a young Atlanta team. He's a highly regarded former player who will be able to relate to guys on the roster on a level that not many others can. During his career, Korver received praise from every team he suited up for, and in his final stop in Milwaukee, head coach Mike Budenholzer said Korver made him a better coach with his work ethic, professionalism and attention to detail."
