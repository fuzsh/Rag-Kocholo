        "text": "The Grizzlies received five assets from the Utah Jazz in return for Mike Conley in Wednesday's trade.\n\nConley will leave Memphis as the franchise's all-time leading scorer. So what's the value of the return Memphis is receiving for the point guard who led the team to seven straight playoff appearances?\n\nThe return, as reported by multiple outlets on Wednesday, will bring the Grizzlies Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen, Kyle Korver, the No. 23 pick in Thursday's draft and a future first-round pick.\n\nNo. 23 overall pick\n\nUtah technically still will make the No. 23 pick on Thursday night during the NBA Draft (6 p.m., ESPN). But the pick will transfer to the Grizzlies once the Conley trade becomes official.\n\nThat means the Grizzlies will be the team calling the shots with that selection.\n\nREAD: Five players the Memphis Grizzlies could pick at No. 23 in NBA Draft\n\nAlthough many pundits regard the 2019 draft as a weak draft outside of the top three prospects, there figure to be some intriguing options available to Memphis at No. 23.\n\nWill the Grizzlies look to add a perimeter shooter such as Belmont's Dylan Windler?\n\nThere is also the possibility the Grizzlies could trade this pick for other assets.\n\nFuture first-round pick\n\nMemphis is receiving another future first-round pick in the deal, but it's uncertain exactly which year the pick will convey from Utah to Memphis.\n\nThat's because the teams negotiated some protection on the pick.\n\nHere is how the protection has been constructed on the future first-round pick, according to league source:\n\n2020 and 2021: The pick conveys to Memphis only if it's between No. 8 and No. 14;\n\n2022: The pick is top-six protected, meaning it will convey to the Grizzlies if it is seventh or lower after the NBA draft lottery;\n\n2023: The pick is top-three protected;\n\n2024: No. 1 protected;\n\n2025: Converts to two second-round picks;\n\nGiven that Utah is a likely playoff team for the next two seasons, there appears to be a good chance that the pick will convey to Memphis in 2022 when it is top-six protected.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE APP: Follow Grizzlies news from the Commercial Appeal on your mobile devices\n\nNBA DRAFT: Keep up-to-date on big basketball news with a digital subscription to one of our sites\n\nGaining an additional first-round pick – even if it's a few years away – in this trade helps Memphis mitigate the sting of a looming obligation to convey a first-round pick to the Celtics.\n\nMemphis owes a top-six protected pick to Boston in 2020. If the Grizzlies fail to convey it next season, the pick will go to the Celtics unprotected in 2021.\n\nJae Crowder\n\nCrowder, who turns 29 next month, is set to make $7.8 million in the final year of his contract during the upcoming season.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 former Marquette standout averaged 11.9 points for the Jazz in 80 games last season. He is a career 33.9% 3-point shooter.\n\nCrowder will bring defensive versatility and general physicality to the Grizzlies, and he probably projects as a rotation player behind Kyle Anderson.\n\nKyle Korver\n\nThe shooter the Grizzlies needed during their playoff runs is finally coming a few years too late.\n\nKorver, 38, is a career 42.9% 3-point shooter and one of the best pure shooters of this millennium.\n\nThe only question here is whether he actually plays for Memphis as he enters the final year of his contract. Only $3.44 million of Korver's $7.55 million salary for next season is guaranteed, according to ESPN.\n\nThat means Memphis could cut Korver before his contract becomes fully guaranteed on July 7 and save a few million dollars.\n\nGrizzlies fans clamoring to see Korver hoisting 3-pointers at FedExForum might ask why Korver would be included in the trade if the Grizzlies planned to release him.\n\nThe answer is that Utah probably needed to include Korver's salary in the deal for its own financial reasons as the Jazz grapple with absorbing the $67 million Conley is owed over the next two seasons.\n\nGrayson Allen\n\nAllen is under contract for $2.4 million next season after a rookie campaign in Utah that included 12 games played in the G-League.\n\nThe polarizing former Duke standout shot 32.3% from 3-point range in his 38 appearances with the Jazz. His contract includes team options for the next two seasons.\n\nUtah selected Allen with the No. 21 overall pick last year after he played four seasons for the Blue Devils and became one of college basketball's top villains.\n\nHe turns 24 before the beginning of the 2019-20 season and could get a shot at more playing time in Memphis than he received on a Utah team seeking to contend in the Western Conference.\n\nReach Grizzlies beat writer David Cobb at david.cobb@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @DavidWCobb."
