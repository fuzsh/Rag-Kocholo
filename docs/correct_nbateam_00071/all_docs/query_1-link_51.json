        "text": "This is an essay about an essay. Have you read the piece by Kyle Korver that appeared on the Players' Tribune website Monday? If you haven't, I encourage you to look it up. It's brilliant.\n\nIn his article, the Utah Jazz 3-point specialist talks about being a white player in the mostly black NBA, and how he has never been forced to come to terms with the racism that most of his African American teammates have encountered. What makes Korver's words powerful is his honesty.\n\nHe admits that when his then-Hawks teammate and good friend Thabo Sefolosha suffered a broken fibula and damaged ligaments in an altercation with NYPD officers outside a Manhattan nightclub in April 2015, Korver's reflexive reaction, was, in his words: “What was Thabo doing out at a club on a back-to-back??” The circumstances of the arrest were always fishy, though. A jury would find Sefolosha not guilty of all charges. And two years after the incident, he won a $4 million settlement against the New York City Law Department.\n\nKorver had another admission. More recently, when Oklahoma City star Russell Westbrook got into a heated argument with a fan at a game in Utah, Korver's thought was, “But you know Russ. He gets into it with the crowd a lot.”\n\nAfter the game, Westbrook revealed that the fan had shouted racist insults at him. The next day, Korver and other Jazz players engaged team president Steve Starks in a closed-door meeting. Remember, the incident had occurred on their home court in Salt Lake City - a site that Warriors players will confirm has a negative connotation for many black players in the NBA.\n\nAt this meeting, Korver's African American colleagues catalogued the many ways they have been targeted by basketball “fans,” and the garbage they have learned to accommodate. Korver was taken aback. He is more steeped in black American culture than almost any white man you can think of, and even he didn't understand the extent and the openness of racism in this country.\n\nAnd that was the thrust of Korver's essay. He felt like he should have known. But he didn't. Because as a white man, he didn't have to. Now, he writes, he is committed to being a true advocate for equality.\n\nI won't plagiarize Korver's entire message, but a few lines stood out. One was this, in response to his internal question of what he can do to help: “I have to listen. I'll say it again, because it's that important. I have to listen.”\n\nThis is such a vital point, and such a simple one. In my experience, many well-intentioned white people are more inclined to propose solutions than to sit and listen to people who come from a different background - people who have been treated differently than I have throughout their lives, and thus might offer a fresh perspective.\n\nTo be clear, it isn't enough just to listen. At some point, everyone who favors a just society must speak their convictions aloud, and act upon them. But listening seems like a reasonable first step.\n\nThe other major theme Korver introduced, the one that really stopped me in my tracks, was this: “When it comes to racism in America, I think that guilt and responsibility tend to be seen as more or less the same thing. But I'm beginning to understand how there's a real difference. As white people, are we guilty of the sins of our forefathers? No, I don't think so. But are we responsible for them? Yes, I believe we are.”\n\nMan, this gets to the heart of it. I think a lot of white people are hostile to Colin Kaepernick's knee, to the Black Lives Matter protests, to the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag because those movements feel accusatory. Most of us are convinced we're not the least bit racist. So why are people of color painting us all with the same brush?\n\nBut Korver's argument peels away the emotional layer. Forget about guilt. You never owned slaves. You didn't enforce whites-only drinking fountains. So make it about it responsibility. If I'm a member of a privileged class, I have benefited from inequality, and I'm responsible to advocate for those who were kept down by it. And if I'm a white American, I'm a member of a privileged class.\n\nKorver's piece wasn't really about basketball, of course. But, as always, sports emerge as a perfect prism for the best and worst of what we have created.\n\nYou think Korver had a callous response to Sefolosha's arrest? Consider what happened last week on the Italian island of Sardinia. Moise Kean, an emerging star for Juventus who was born in Italy and whose parents are from Ivory Coast, claimed that he was the subject of racist taunts throughout a road game in the city of Cagliari. Some teammates backed up his story. When Kean scored a goal, he faced the loudest section of stands and stood silently, his arms extended in an inquisitive pose. The Cagliari fans rained down a torrent of hate.\n\nThat was bad. Almost worse was what one of Kean's teammates, the Italian Leonardo Bonucci, said after the game: “He could have done it differently. … I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that and the Curva (fans) should not have reacted in that way.”\n\nLet's see… silently confronting your racist tormentors vs. making monkey sounds at a 19-year-old soccer player because of his African heritage. Does that sound like 50-50 to you?\n\nAnd that's what Korver was getting at. He is vowing to become more of an advocate for his black teammates, to change his angle of approach on issues involving race, to break the silence that his privilege allows him. I'm grateful for his essay.\n\nThe response to this column won't be universally positive. I've been down this street. When I write about Big Issues, I get a certain number of comments along the lines of, “Stop writing about politics in the sports section. I watch sports to get away from this stuff.” Honestly, I'm sympathetic. The games are a blessed escape. We are nearly overwhelmed these days with our ceaseless political and cultural clashes. That's why I usually write about the Warriors' defensive intensity or the lack of power in the middle of the Giants' lineup.\n\nBut then I see conservative sports commentators like Clay Travis and Jason Whitlock mocking Kyle Korver for what he wrote. And I jump on Twitter to check engagement on the Players' Tribune essay and see, between many messages of gratitude and support, comments like “Yeah Kyle Korver is an idiot poor fella has to cry with his teammates because people said mean things to him” and “Sorry lads, there's no such thing as ‘white privilege.' Stop the race baiting” and “People like Kyle Korver are an embarrassment to my race.” And I realize there's some work to be done.\n\nYou don't have to agree with everything Korver wrote, either. But it can't hurt to listen, right?\n\nYou can reach columnist Phil Barber at 707-521-5263 or phil.barber@pressdemocrat.com. Follow him on Twitter: @Skinny_Post."
