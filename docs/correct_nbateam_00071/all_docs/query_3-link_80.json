        "text": "Once again my mind is filled with many small things that by themselves are perhaps unworthy of a stand-alone post. But together they make one heck of a mess and that sounds just about right for one of my articles. So let’s get started shall we?\n\nFirst of all, there has been some confusion about my last article which was about a boy talking to his pet frog who is trying to escape. I apologize for the confusion. And I know that the frog in the video was freaky. Can you imagine walking across your lawn at night and hearing that sound come from near your feet in the darkness? Again I apologize.\n\nWhile reading the Rifftrax Blog the other day I came across a youtube video posted by our good pal Bill Corbett. It perfectly illustrates the frustration of a screenwriter pitching his work to hollywood.\n\nIt made me laugh several times and I had to seek out more information about the comedians in the sketch. They are called Mitchell and Webb and are big hits in the UK but are relatively unknown in the US.\n\nTheir current show “that Mitchell and Webb look” airs on BBC America on the weekends so you can check it out. Here are a few more sample clips to whet your whistle. (Mild expletive warning!)\n\nNazi officers realizing that they are the bad guys:\n\nA Mr B Natural story gone bad.\n\nNaming a dry cleaners:\n\nChild with a BOOTY for a face:\n\nThey are also PC and Mac guys for the UK commercials.\n\nRifftrax:\n\nI finally got around to watching the Rifftrax of Matrix Reloaded the other night with Mrs. Edge. We both enjoyed it immensely. They ripped appart the massively stupid sex/rave scene that took up half of the film for one. They also accurately picked the moment in the film where the Matrix franchise jumped the proverbial shark.\n\nOh and for you insiders, bacon jokes are scattered throughout along with the obligatory Schnappi reference.\n\nThe original Matrix Rifftrax is the one that started it all for me and the second one is even better.\n\nAlso, the Riffers have taken on some new political ads. Here are a couple of my favorites:\n\nThere are more on my previous political post.\n\nCompletely 100% not not true:\n\nIn my previous article on the history of Asparagus Pee I left out one interesting factoid.\n\nOn the island of Bhuti in the Indian Ocean, the Palahunga tribe makes many of varieties of distinctive dyes. These dyes are made from the various plant and insect species native to the island and are highly sought over by yarn manufacturers for their brilliant colors.\n\nThe most sought after of these dyes is called Bhutipee #5. It is a gorgeous deep purple hue and sells for over 150 dollars per ounce. (Which, being highly concentrated can actually dye 10 skeins of high quality alpaca yarn.) These skeins of yarn can sell for $50-100 each. (No, Mrs. Edge! Put the credit card down and back away slowly . . .)\n\nWhat is very interesting is that the beautiful purple hue of this yarn comes from a mixture composed from the musk glands of a beetle native to the island (The Bhuti Beetle) and asparagus pee.\n\nHow did such a thing come to pass?\n\nAsparagus was brought to the islands in the 1700’s by british explorers coming out of India. The lush climate on the island was perfect for the growth of Asparagus and the vegetable flourished. It grew so well there in fact that it became seen by the inhabitants as a weed. Still there were some of the tribe that enjoyed the flavor of this new vegetable.\n\nAs the story goes, one day a dyemaker’s son was stepped on a bhuti beetle and the stink of the beetle clung to him. In order to get rid of the musk from a bhuti beetle, the traditional method is to pee on it. Something in the urine counteracts the smell. Evidently this time when the boy peed on it, his foot turned purple. He screamed and though he had contracted some horrible skin disease, but over time they realized that it was something else. His foot had become dyed purple.\n\nNow being a tribe of dye makers, it occured to them to find out where this beautiful purple came from. The musk of a bhuti beetle is quite colorless normally and they had never seen this result before. It took the quite a while to realize that the reason his foot had turned purple was because he had eaten large quantities of asparagus before stepping on the beetle and even though his urine was yellow and the beetle musk was colorless, a chemical reaction in the musk turned the urine that delightful purple color.\n\nUtah Jazz:\n\nKyle Korver Girlfriend sighting:\n\nI have been asked to leave Deformio alone by this lady above. She wouldn’t say, but I am almost sure it is Kyle Korver’s girlfriend. I know that some of you have told me that this is a guy, but anyone with that voice is 100% woman.\n\nOn a side note, Deformio has come out of his shooting slump in the last couple games and has been ripping the nets for the Jazz. It was in large part thanks to him that we beat Dallas and Detroit recently.\n\nGo Deformio!\n\nNo I am not selling any. Geez ladies.\n\nBut according to this morning’s Deseret News, Kyle Korver has been wearing the same underwear for 45 days. Oh you heard me right. But don’t take it from me. Listen to Kyle:\n\n“I had some friends just kind of go in my closet and grab some stuff and ship it out. But it’s just, like, the little things that you don’t want them digging through … little stuff like that that I haven’t had in the last 45 days. Like … clean drawers.”\n\nBecause you know that in Salt Lake city they don’t sell underwear. Maybe an NBA player wouldn’t be caught dead buying them in bulk at Walmart, but SLC has plenty of upscale stores where a Baller could purchase some Shaq-brand silk drawers. Heck Andre Kirilenko’s wife would probably sell him some. Wouldn’t that be preferable to wearing the same pair for 45 days?\n\nMaybe he is just doing it in an attempt to keep the defenders off him. It isn’t working, though. They stick to him like glue. He has to scrape them off on Matt Harpring to get open.\n\nThe other thing that Salt Lake is missing is dry cleaners. Actually folks I am just kidding around with Deformio. There are plenty of dry cleaners available.\n\nHere is a list.\n\nCity Dry Cleaners – maps.google.com – (801) 466-2241\n\nHenrie’s Dry Cleaners – http://www.henries.com – (801) 328-8789\n\nRed Hanger Cleaners: Stores – maps.google.com – (801) 532-7143\n\nClassic Cleaners – maps.google.com – (801) 355-1725\n\nOne Hour Martinizing – http://www.martinizing.com – (801) 466-3010\n\nKyle they may even restore your old underpants here:\n\nHenrie’s Dry Cleaners: Certified Restoration – http://www.henries.com – (801) 363-2653\n\nOk, now you may be wondering why I am savaging one of my favorite players. You see, folks according to that article it looks like Kyle was actually extended an invitation to be part of the 3-point shooting contest at the NBA Allstar game and declined because he still wanted to pick up some stuff he left behind in Philly and didn’t want his friends going through his underwear drawers. Link to same Desnews article HERE.\n\nSo our good pal Deformio skips out on the 3-point shootout for underwear? Why? Do we no longer have moving companies in America that a multi million dollar player could afford to use? Maybe there just aren’t any in Philladelphia. Let me check . . . Oh wait:\n\nMambo Movers – http://www.mambomovers.com – (215) 670-9535\n\nGoggin Moving & Storage – gogginmoving.com – (215) 877-7618\n\nMovers by Old City Movers – http://www.oldcitymovers.com – (267) 205-5209\n\nAlacrity Equipment Movers – http://www.hi-techmovers.com – (215) 825-7696\n\nThe A-Team Movers – http://www.ateammovers.com – (215) 232-8326\n\nFox Piano Movers Inc – http://www.foxpianomovers.com – (215) 592-8411\n\nApioneer Moving Systems – http://www.apioneer.com – (215) 493-8296\n\nAdvance Storage Company: Toll Free Outside PA 1-800 523-2723 (215) 765-6500\n\nExtra Space Storage: Philadelphia – http://www.extraspace.com – (215) 455-2880\n\nPenske Truck Rental Philadelphia – http://www.pensketruckrental.com – (215) 922-2702 –\n\nAs a fan, I would have liked to see Kyle Korver Kick butt in the 3-point contest. Instead we get Kobe, Richard Hamilton, Daniel Gibson, Jason Kapono, and Nash. Some of those guys belong in that contest but I think Korver could have beat them all.\n\nNow my wife just grabbed me by the ear and said, “Blah blah rah rah blah yadda blah rah!”\n\nTranslation:\n\nShe told me to tell you guys what is possibly the other side of the story. She says that she is sure that Kyle just wants to go and see his family and put his life in order. He has been living in a hotel since coming to the Jazz for goodness sake. With all the games and travel and practices, he hasn’t been able to stop and breathe, much less do his laundry. Besides, he minght need to spend time with his family or girlfriend or whatever. In conclusion “Blah Yadda Blah Blah.”\n\nBTW, possible Kyle Korver girlfriend sighting here folks:\n\nWell all I know is that since being on the Jazz, Kyle has helped stabilize the team. We have gone 17-3. That’s frickin’ awesome. He kicks butt and takes names. Even if his shooting touch is still just a little off, that still makes him one of the best shooters in the league.\n\nSo is it selfish for me to want to see him beat the crap out of Kobe in the 3-point shooting contest?\n\nOh wait, I have another possible Kyle Korver girlfriend sighting. Or should I say Girlfriends? That’s right, guys. He’s got TWINS!!!\n\nOur good pal Deformio is kicking booty and taking names as the newest member of the Utah Jazz. Since Korver’s trade to the Jazz on December 29, we have gone 11-2. It’s an awesome record to be sure.\n\nHow much of the winning record is due to Deformio’s skills is hard to say. What was supposed to be his greatest attribute, his three point shooting, has been off and on so far. But several other factors have come into play to make him a key addition to the team.\n\n1. He spreads the floor.\n\nDespite how off his 3 point shooting has been, teams know his reputation. They always seem to keep a man on him, giving our other guys more room to work inside.\n\n2. His defensive skills were highly underrated.\n\nDeformio has surprised all of us with his tenaciousness on defense. He sticks to mis man and moves laterally probably better than anyone else on the team. He is also a hustle guy, averaging a steal at least once a game and he has also averaged about one block a game, which was a huge surprise for me.\n\n3. The Chick Factor\n\nFor some reason, the chicks go nuts for Deformio. His one eye slightly higher than the other and his cockeyed smile drives the lady folk bonkers. This helps the team, because at home the girls are screaming like crazy, making the arena louder than before. On the road, they cheer for our team instead of theirs whenever he is on the floor.\n\n4. His free throw shooting and midrange jumper.\n\nDespite his 3 point struggles, Deformio is as close to perfect as anyone can get from the freethrow line. Not to mention how great he is with that mid range jumper. Man can he get them up fast. If ony he could get that 3 pointer falling more often . . .\n\n5. His all around good guy style.\n\nKorver is great for the locker room. The other guys don’t feel so bad about their own looks when he is in the room. AK and Memo probably don’t feel half as ugly with Deformio around.\n\nHere is an example of why he is good for the locker room. He knew when he was coming in to the team that he was going to take some other guy’s minutes. So he made it a point to go to CJ Miles and Brewer and tell them, Hey, I am a team guy. I’m rooting for you do do well when you are on the floor. I’m not trying to usurp your spot in the rotation. I think that going out of his way to do that has helped keep the guys from resenting him too much.\n\n6. Addition by subtraction. Gira is gone.\n\nGira hurt the team in several subtle ways. Gira never ran the plays. He disrupted our offense constantly. He turned the ball over with his stupid Euro-travel at least once or twice a game. When he was sent to the bench, he would complain to his team mates about it, disrupting the team spirit that needs to be there in order to play your best. And when COY (Coach Sloan) kept him on the bench because of his antics, we were forced to play guys at the position (Fish, Harp, etc . . .) that were not right for the teams we were facing.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong. I’m not giving Deformio sole credit for our recent winning ways. Guys all over the team have been stepping up. AK has been playing at his former all star level. Memo has decided to make some shots for a change. Deron and Boozer have even stepped up their play which is hard to do when you are already playing at such a high level.\n\nFor an example, of Deformio’s value to the team let’s take a look at our most recent game:\n\nWe were playing the San Antonio Spurs, The defending NBA champs. They knocked us out of the playoffs last year and we have always struggled to beat thim. This was a big game for us also because by winning, we would be at the top of our division and back in the playoff race.\n\nDeron, Booze and Ak had fantastic nights. While Korver only had 8 points on 3-7 shooting. On the other side, Gonobli, who never makes a foul,\n\nhad a great game, scoring 29 points on us. Korver did as good a job on him as anyone ever does with that freak of nature, but where he shone was in the final minutes.\n\nWe had led most of the night, but the Spurs got within two. With the game on the line, Deformio hit a technical free throw and a three pointer, giving us back enough of a lead that we were able to win the game.\n\nDeformio always seems to do just enough to hold up his end of the team and that’s what makes me happy that we got him. We’ll keep an eye on Deformio and his continuing contributions to the team, but for now it looks like he is a star rising in Utah.\n\nIn conclusion, I know it’s early but let me leave the ladies with a little valentines treat. Sorry, i couldn’t find one with Jazz Uniform.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI found another picture of Kyle Korver’s girlfriend below\n\n*Hides head in shame knowing I am a total google whore*"
