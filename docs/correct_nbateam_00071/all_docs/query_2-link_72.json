        "text": "At this point the 76ers will take any motivation to jump start their early season woes, even if it comes in the form of an opponents jump shot.\n\nPhiladelphia (2-4) will host former Sixer Kyle Korver and the red-hot Utah Jazz (5-1) Tuesday night at the Wachovia Center.\n\nRemember Korver?\n\nGuys may recall his deadly three-point arsenal at the top of the key. Or the rumor that he hit 100 of 100 free throws at a practice in Toronto a few years back.\n\nConfirmation of this myth still remains in the air.\n\nAs for the ladies, it’s probably a safe bet that somewhere in the Philadelphia area remains a poster of the heartthrob on some teenager’s wall.\n\nEither way, Korver was as big part of the Sixers and hopefully he will spur an increase in attendance -- lord knows the team needs it -- and motivate the Sixers to abruptly inform Mr. Korver that the Wachovia Center is no longer his house.\n\nSports\n\nIn partnership with NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nThe Sixers have played sluggish to say the least, turning the ball over 35 more times on offense than their opponents. It doesn't get much better on the defensive end where opponents have 27 more steals than the Sixers.\n\nVeteran Andre Iguodala continues to falter offensively. He is averaging his lowest point total, 11 per game, since his rookie season. He looks even worse at home where that number drops to 10 points.\n\nLuckily for the Sixers, Iguodala’s career numbers against the Jazz are a little better at 16 points per game.\n\nKorver, who was originally drafted by the New Jersey Nets, spent his first four and a half NBA seasons in Philadelphia before the team traded him to the Jazz for Gordan Giricek and a first-round pick mid-way through last season.\n\nGiricek is no longer a Sixer.\n\nPhilly used that first round pick to select Marreese Speights with the 16th overall selection in the 2008 NBA draft.\n\nHow did both teams fair in the trade?\n\nWe’ll see tonight when Korver will walk on familiar ground and Speights will post up for the Sixers against a Jazz team that is without center Mehmet Okur.\n\nNotes\n\nKorver holds the 76ers franchise record for three-pointers made in a season (226 in 2004-05) and has three of the franchise’s top-10 single-season marks for three-point accuracy in his hand. Korver is second on the team’s career list for three-pointers made with 661.\n\nKorver is four for 10 from downtown in six games this season."
