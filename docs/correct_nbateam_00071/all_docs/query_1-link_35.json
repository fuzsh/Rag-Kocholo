        "text": "Dennis Lindsey said if continuity didn’t work, he’d go to Plan B. Kyle Korver must be that Plan B. Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that Kyle Korver has been traded to Utah in exchange for Alec Burks and two second round first picks. Alec Burks has been the odd man out in Utah for the past few years and will most likely get a lot of playing time in Cleveland. He’ll join fellow Utah castaway Rodney Hood in a Cavalier uniform.\n\nWhile many felt Utah could afford to wait until the schedule got easier, it appears Utah did not. This trade will bring some much needed shooting to Utah. Korver is averaging 43% from three on 3.4 three point attempts a game.\n\nUtah will be taking on one more year of salary as Alec Burks was set to become a free agent at the end of this season while Korver is owed 7.5M for the next two seasons. The good news is Korver’s contract for the second year is only partial guaranteed at $3.5M. This might make the waters of Utah’s upcoming free agency hopes a little murky but now Utah can set Korver free in a system that will give him A LOT of open three point looks. Donovan Mitchell should be able to roam free in the paint with the additional spacing."
