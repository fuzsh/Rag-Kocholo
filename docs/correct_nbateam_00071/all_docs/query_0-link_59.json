        "text": "Joe Ingles is excited about what Kyle Korver brings to the Utah Jazz.\n\nAhead of Korver's debut with the Jazz on Friday against the Charlotte Hornets, Ingles spoke to NBA.com about what his new teammate brings to the table.\n\n\"We've got guys that can make shots,\" Ingles said. \"We haven't to start the year, but I also felt like if we had the same team for the rest of the year, we would make shots as we went on. It does help obviously having a guy like [Korver] because you're not going to leave him, which is great for us when creating and playing pick-and-rolls because it just opens up the floor more — it kind of goes to 4-on-4 instead of 5-on-5.\"\n\n\"He'll definitely help us,\" Ingles continued. \"Once he gets our system and the way we play, I think he'll flourish. He's going to get a lot of shots, he's going to get a lot of looks and we're happy to have him.\"\n\nThe Jazz haven't lived up to expectations to start this season. After winning 48 games last regular season and beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in the opening round of the playoffs, Utah was projected to finish near the top of the league again this season by winning almost 50 games.\n\nThrough 22 games, however, they find themselves ahead of only the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference standings with a 10-12 record. While they've taken a step back on both ends, it's been their inconsistency on offence that has been the primary concern, as the Jazz currently rank 27th in offensive efficiency.\n\nPart of it has to do with the Jazz having one of the toughest schedules to start the season, but Ingles attributes some of their slow starts to teams being better prepared for them.\n\n\"I think last year we were a little bit under the radar. Especially after the point when we were losing, we were coming into arenas and we felt like we could beat anyone in the league, especially with the way we were playing. I mean, you finish fourth or fifth — whatever we finished in the West — you're going to have a target on your back. We were good. We got to the second round.\"\n\n\"But again, the flip side is it's a whole new year. Donovan [Mitchell] is going to be a ton more scouted than he was last year. People know how we played, they know what we want to do. I get top blocked every time I'm in the corner. It's just different things that people have worked out. \"\n\n\"That's a part of us growing; now to be a better team is to figure that out and get better from it.\"\n\nSo how does Korver get them back to their winning ways? As Ingles said, teams aren't going to want to leave him open whenever he's on the court.\n\nOne of the NBA's all-time leaders in 3-pointers made, Korver has made 43.2 percent of his career shot attempts from the perimeter. He's been even more effective in the second half of his career than the first half, knocking down 45.1 percent of his 3-point attempts since 2011.\n\nWhether it's Ricky Rubio, Donovan Mitchell or Ingles handling the ball, having a proven shooter on the floor should open up valuable space for the Jazz's playmakers. Spacing has been a problem for the Jazz so far this season, with them shooting 31.9 percent from 3-point range as a team.\n\nWith Korver now on the roster, the Jazz could start to look more like the up-and-coming team that took the league by surprise last season sooner rather than later."
