        "text": "It had seemed like years since any meaningful sporting event had taken place. Once all sports were canceled in March, I unsubscribed from the BYU sports podcasts I regularly listened to, spent most of my free time watching movies instead of watching Jazz games, and only occasionally checked my ESPN App a couple times a month to check if any of my favorite teams had traded away or signed somebody. When the NBA announced and approved a plan to safely bring back basketball in the Orlando bubble, I was ecstatic. I hungered to watch my favorite teams and players and to connect with fellow friends and fans, providing us a respite from our crazy daily lives in 2020.\n\nIt was even more special that my favorite NBA team the Utah Jazz were kicking off the historic NBA bubble experiment. The game was rife with interesting matchups and storylines. Rookie sensation Zion Williamson was pitted against the rising star Donovan Mitchell. Rudy Gobert, one of the first celebrities to test positive for the coronavirus, scored the first points of the NBA reboot. The return of the NBA overall provided not just much-needed entertainment but a glimmer of hope that we could have some normalcy in the face of the new socially distancing normal and the uncertain future that lay ahead for our pandemic-stricken country and world.\n\nPerhaps more important and meaningful than the in-game storylines of the Jazz’s win over the New Orleans Pelicans, and the subsequent Lakers-Clippers bout, were the events before the game’s first whistle. While I sat anchored to my couch for a recreational game of basketball, I was immediately taken aback by the opening ceremonies. My eyes welled up with tears watching the pre-game promotional video of several prominent NBA players and coaches standing in unity calling for racial equality. When the national anthem played, both teams and coaches kneeled before a large United States flag linking arms in solidarity, all wearing black shirts with large white letters reading “Black Lives Matter”.\n\nMost players wore messages instead of names on the back of their jerseys, such as “Equality,” “How Many More?,” and “Black Lives Matter.” Some of my favorite messages worn were Joe Ingles’ “Ally” and Donovan Mitchell’s “Say Her Name”, referring to Breonna Taylor who was shot by police in her Louisville home, not far from where Mitchell played college ball.\n\nThis demonstration didn’t come as a surprise to me or any of those following the news of the NBA restart; however, actually seeing it happen was more powerful than I imagined. This wasn’t just a PR stunt to sell tickets. This was a genuine push for change. While there are diverse opinions among the players and coaches of how we can fight for racial equality, these differences were set aside to resoundingly stand for the ever-important fact that black lives matter and that we as a country need our actions and culture to reflect this statement.\n\nAlthough this protest and show of solidarity was meant for a national (and potentially international) audience, Utah has a lot to gain from the Jazz’s central role in the NBA’s social justice initiatives. As a lifelong Jazz fan and BYU graduate myself, I have seen firsthand how my Utah and Latter-day Saint community has reacted since George Floyd’s murder and subsequent protests. While I have been encouraged and inspired by many of my peer’s calls for racial justice and systematic change, I’ve been disheartened with the number of people in my community that opted to make Black Lives Matter a political issue instead of a moral one. Many have used their personal platform to undermine the simple message of the Black Lives Matter organization and movement, deny black voices and experiences, and dismiss the need for change by relying solely on their own limited white experience and white privilege.\n\nThe Jazz’s involvement in the Black Lives Matter movement is an open invitation for those not on-board in the Utah community, basketball fans or not, to lend an ear and listen to black voices and experiences. Perhaps such prominent black athletes like Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert will speak to the Utah community much better than news coverage of a protest or a Facebook post ever would. Maybe the protests the Jazz and other NBA players and coaches are pushing forward with, devoid of partisan support and filled with optimistic and constructive patriotism, is just what Utah needs.\n\nThe Jazz and their players have spoken out before as former Jazz player Kyle Korver’s phenomenal op-ed on white privilege and this Salt Lake Tribune article show. Is this demonstration any different than before? Will this NBA season play a role in real and lasting social change or will it fizzle out like any previous attempts?\n\nI am hopeful that such protests will help bring about change and constructive discussion in Utah and throughout the country. The Utah Jazz organization has now committed to stand alongside other NBA teams throughout the season and beyond to actively fight for social justice. This is not going away. NBA and Jazz fans who don’t agree with current calls for social change will have to face where they stand on the issue. These fans will have to decide whether they walk away from the team, fan base, and league in disgust, simply ignore these social justice messages from their favorite teams and players, or listen to and engage with what they have to say.\n\nIt has been clear for the past several months that we as a community need to and can do much better. As Lebron James stated about racial justice in his postgame interview after his Lakers’ victory over the Clippers, “in the past when we’ve seen progress, we’ve let our foot off the gas a little bit. We can’t do that”. The Jazz and the NBA are determined to use their worldwide platform to, in James’ words, “continue to keep our foot on the gas, continue to push forward, continue to spread love throughout America”. It is this message the team and league hope to share with anyone who tunes in for a game this season.\n\nInstead of running away from the issue and hoping professional athletes will simply “shut up and dribble”, Jazz fans and Utahns have the opportunity to take a page from the NBA’s and Jazz’s playbook by using their individual platforms to stand up against racial injustice. Taking such a stand with our family, friends, co-workers, and fellow citizens will lead to important and hard conversations about racial equality in our local communities and social circles. We cannot stop simply because some progress has been made. As individuals and communities, we need to keep our foot on the gas pedal and not settle for anything less than real and lasting racial equality in our neighborhoods, businesses, schools, cities, state, and country.\n\nIn a statement released prior to their first NBA bubble game on Thursday, the Utah Jazz front office declared that “our organization strives to be a unifying force in our communities, and we hope this time in our history can be a catalyst for positive change in a country we love”. I hope that the Utah Jazz’s protest will prove to be an opportunity for Jazz fans and Utahns who previously politicized, opposed, or ignored the Black Lives Matter movement to listen intently to African American experiences. I hope that Jazz players’ and coaches’ call to action will encourage those already on-board to continue engaging in difficult conversations aimed at changing racist beliefs, policies, and cultures.\n\nIn short, the Utah Jazz’s protests for racial equality matters and presents an opportunity for substantial change. Whether the Jazz make a deep run into the playoff bubble in Orlando might only matter to me and other Jazz fans. How Utah’s communities respond to the momentum gained through protests by the Utah Jazz and thousands of others speaking out against racial injustice will affect the life of every single person of color in the state. It is up to everyday Utahns whether Utah will continue to ignore calls for substantial social justice reforms or choose to embrace this unifying message of acceptance and equality to build a better future for our communities."
