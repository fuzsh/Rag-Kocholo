        "text": "A William & Mary tradition since 1776.\n\nIn 1776, five students at William & Mary founded Phi Beta Kappa, the first organization to call itself a fraternity. It is only appropriate that the university is often referred to as the \"Birthplace of the American College Fraternity.\" Since that time, fraternities and sororities have evolved, but still remain committed to similar principles and values, such as scholarship, service, brotherhood/sisterhood and leadership. Here at William & Mary the tradition of fraternity remains strong and our Fraternity & Sorority Community plays a vital role on campus and in the community.\n\nInterested in Joining?\n\nFor those interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, we invite you to learn more and register."
