        "text": "Welcome to Valparaiso University and the best years of your life!\n\nValpo’s fraternities and sororities make an important contribution to life on campus by providing leadership opportunities for students and service to the community.\n\nSince the first Greek-letter society was formed in 1776 at the College of William and Mary, sororities and fraternities have played a dynamic and exciting part of campus life. Students who choose to become part of a fraternity or sorority will be exposed to a well-rounded co-curricular experience. Being a member of one of our 17 national and international sorority and fraternity chapters offers many exciting leadership opportunities.\n\nSororities and fraternities at Valpo have long been a major part of campus life and consistently work together to promote the highest ideals and academic standards. Each organization is unique in its own way, but all offer the opportunity to experience leadership, social activities, community and philanthropic projects, and, most of all, lifelong friends.\n\nWe hope you will consider becoming part of a fraternity or sorority at Valparaiso University.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPanhellenic and Interfraternity Councils"
