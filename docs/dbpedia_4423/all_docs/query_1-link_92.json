        "text": "ALPHA\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh\n\nThe First Chapter of Cwens\n\nOn November 3, 1922, Elizabeth Zeigler and Jean Ballou of the Class of 1925, and Thyrsa W. Amos, Dean of Women, discussed informally the advisability of organizing a sophomore honor society for women leaders of student activities at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920, a chapter of Druids, a sophomore honor society for men, had been installed at the University, and this had raised the question of a similar society for women. Miss Amos suggested that the question be referred for final decision to women of the sophomore class active in the various undergraduate organizations for women.\n\nThese leaders were then notified that there would “be a meeting of all sophomore girls interested in promoting freshman and sophomore scholarship and activities in the Heinz House, Tuesday, November 7, 1922, at 12:30 o’clock.” It was agreed that such a society ought not be given a Greek letter name, but like Druids, have a name that would “stand out because it was different.” It was agreed also that sincere effort must be made by such a society “to foster activities for all freshman and sophomore women” and to select for membership in the spring of the freshman year those freshmen who displayed the finest Pitt spirit, showed good scholarship, and expressed interest in activities through fine participation in them. Elizabeth Zeigler then moved that “this group present proceed to form an organization for sophomore women leaders and elect temporary officers.” The motion was carried unanimously. Agnes Hewitt was elected temporary chairman, and Jean Ballou, temporary officer. The motion was carried unanimously.\n\nAgnes Hewitt then took the chair and Miss Amos took her place as member of the group. Upon request, Miss Amos acted as administrative advisor also. On Friday, November 17, reports were given and action taken on some of them. The Committee on Name reported that they had gone to Anglo-Saxon and Sanskrit sources for names. The Committee proposed three names: Cwens, Anglo-Saxon, meaning “lady” or “queen”; Sanskrit for “bond” or “band”; Witan, Anglo-Saxon for “leaders” or “wise men”. The emblems suggested were: a tiny branch of mistletoe to be done in green and white enamel; a crown resting upon a scepter to be done in gold; a circlet of green enamel mistletoe leaves surrounding a monogram of gold letters indicating the name of the society. After much discussion, “Cwens” was chosen as the name, and the scepter and crown as the emblem. The first members of this society were:\n\nJean G. Ballou\n\nAgnes T. Hewitt\n\nElizabeth Highberger\n\nLouise M. Hoge\n\nTheresa Kahn\n\nFrances M. Koenig\n\nStella Mulligan\n\nMildred Pickrell\n\nMargaret Porch\n\nElizabeth D. Seville\n\nSarah M. Stoughton\n\nElizabeth G. Zeigler\n\nIn the spring of 1976, thirty-six women were initiated into the National Society of Cwens. These women were:\n\nCeleste D. Barringer\n\nEllen R. Nord (Corresponding Secretary)\n\nCynthis L. Obetz\n\nRozlyn M. Berty\n\nMaryellen Orcutt (Ritual Chairman)\n\nLinda Percy\n\nJudith L. Chappel\n\nMarie Ribik\n\nCarmelita T. Civitarese\n\nKatherine A. Rockar (Recording Secretary)\n\nLinda S. Roll\n\nRosemary J. Colecchia\n\nKaren J. Roney\n\nJanice Crain\n\nElsie Sauer\n\nAloise E. Dumbovich\n\nDebra L. Shufler\n\nCheryl L. Gallagher (Historian)\n\nStacie Gaynor\n\nMary Sisak\n\nAnn C. Hansen\n\nJane V. Smith\n\nLauran Hausdorff (Diamond Editor)\n\nCaryn J. Hirsh\n\nKathy A. Starry\n\nCarol Levenson\n\nJoyce Tasillo\n\nJudith A. Lynn\n\nKim M. Vercamen (President)\n\nNancy J. Vido\n\nAnita D. McAtee (Vice President)\n\nAlexis Megaludis\n\nPhyllis Woodard (Treasurer)\n\nEleonora M. Zych\n\nMary Moran\n\nMelanie Moyer\n\nIn June of 1976, we were notified of Title IX and that we must reorganize and admit male members. This was a difficult task set before us since we ourselves were new to the organization. During the summer the newly elected officers started initiating future goals for the new organization Lambda Sigma. A list of eligible male members was obtained and the selection process took place. Twenty-six male members were initiated. A first annual banquet of the Alpha Chapter of Lambda Sigma was held in their honor. Since officers had already been elected, two positions were temporarily created so that male members could be represented on the executive board. The new members were as follows:\n\nDaniel D. Abrams\n\nChristopher A. Maranuk\n\nThomas Bonavita\n\nMark W. Morrissey\n\nRichard B. Charny\n\nRobert Moulton\n\nTab H. Crooks\n\nRobert E. Mowder\n\nScott H. Davidson\n\nKurt Nellis\n\nJames Ditaranto\n\nHarry V. Patchin\n\nMartin J. Geisler, Jr. (Executive Board Member)\n\nJoseph E. Ross\n\nDavid J. Hesidence\n\nThomas Schauble\n\nGordon R. Iben\n\nDan A. Sciullo\n\nGeoffrey Joseph\n\nDavid Tepper\n\nMartin Klanchar\n\nAstrophel C. Tiburcio\n\nCharles Kunkle\n\nRick E. Wagner\n\nDavid Mann\n\nArthur D. Wong\n\nBETA\n\nThe Miami University\n\nThe Second Society of Cwens\n\nIn November, 1924, two years after the founding of the Cwens society at the University of Pittsburgh, an inquiry was sent to Dean Elizabeth Hamilton of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, by Thyrsa W. Amos, concerning the possibility of organizing a Cwens society at Miami. Dean Hamilton replied on November 5, 1924, saying: “We do not at present have an organization of sophomore girls at Miami, but I can see that such an organization might be very serviceable. We should be glad to organize a group and put them in touch with some national movement.” In reply, Dean Amos suggested that Dean Hamilton send her “the name of one of your outstanding sophomore girls. I will have the president of Cwens write to her: then if your sophomore girl likes the idea, she can pass it on to the other girls.”\n\nOn November 20, Dean Hamilton sent the name of Kathryn Patterson. Then began a correspondence between her and Jeannette McClure, Extension Chairman of the Pitt Chapter, in which Miami was invited to use the name Cwens for its organization. On January 16, 1925, Dean Hamilton wrote.” We have a wonderfully fine, strong group of sophomore girls and are taking steps to select them carefully and to form an organization.”\n\nOn April 6, 1925, she reported that Mortar Board had assisted her in the final organization of the Cwens society on the Miami campus. She inquired about Cwens colors and pin, and asked if the Pitt group would be willing for Miami to use them. The reply authorized Miami to use the crimson and silver as colors, and the crown and scepter pin. At this time, she said Miami would be glad to be hostess to an intercollegiate conference of sophomore honor societies. The following seventeen sophomore girls were charter members of the Miami Cwens:\n\nMildred Angle\n\nMildred Schiller\n\nFrances Eaton\n\nDorothy Smelker\n\nCatherine Ellis\n\nElizabeth St. John\n\nMildred Engle\n\nDoris Wetzel\n\nJulia Glover\n\nJeannette White\n\nMargarette Holcomb\n\nSusan Wine\n\nVirginia Newman\n\nAlice Young\n\nKathryn Patterson\n\nFlorence Zehring\n\nBarbara Rehberg\n\nGAMMA\n\nThe University of Missouri\n\nThe Third Society of Cwens\n\nOn October 30, 1924, Dean Bessie Leach Priddy, Dean of Women, University of Missouri, in reply to an inquiry of Dean Amos concerning an organization for sophomore women, wrote, “There is no organization of sophomore girls on this campus similar to Mortar Board for seniors. Our sophomore girls are organized, however, and operate through what is known as the Sophomore Women’s Cabinet. Miss Frances Wayne Allen is president of the sophomore class.”\n\nOn November 26, 1924, Jeannette McClure, Extension Chairman of the Pitt Cwens, wrote to Frances Wayne Allen asking if she was interested in the organization of a national honor society for sophomore women. In her response of January 8, 1925, Miss Allen said she had read Miss McClure’s letter to the Cabinet, and they were much interested in the proposal. “Perhaps,” she continued, “you would be interested in knowing about our organization. It is an outgrowth of `Freshman Commission’, another organization that began primarily as junior workers in the Y.W.C.A. The members of `Freshman Commission’ were chosen by the faculty, judging each girl’s record in activities and grades during her high school life.\n\nThis club of freshman girls was limited to one member from each sorority and three non-sorority girls. The Sophomore Cabinet had been an organization here three years ago – 1921 – but had ceased to exist. Our Freshman Commission believed that there was a need for re-establishing a sophomore organization. Those who were still in school then used Freshman Commission as a nucleus and selected other sophomore girls according to their grades, interests, and activities of the previous year. We had twenty members who accomplished several worthwhile things this year, mainly, the organization of freshman women.\n\nNote: Gamma Chapter is now inactive.\n\nDELTA\n\nPennsylvania State College\n\nThe Fourth Chapter of Cwens\n\nIn October, 1924, an inquiry was sent to Dean Charlotte Ray of Pennsylvania State College, asking about a sophomore honor society for women there. Dean Ray replied that Penn State had no such organization. Jeannette McClure, Extension Chairman, wrote in November and December giving details of the Cwens society. Dean Ray expressed interest but felt that the time was not “quite yet” for a sophomore activities society.\n\nIn answer to an invitation to send a delegate to a conference in May, 1925, she wrote, “Our girls have a great interest in promoting activities, but they do not feel that we have yet any need for such an organization. There may be a time when circumstances will make it very desirable for us to have such a society. We shall notify you when we reach the point of a new organization.”\n\nIn 1927, Penn State sent a delegate, Helen Faust, to the convention at Pittsburgh. Dean Ray wrote, “This seems a suitable time for us to attempt to do something in the way of an honorary activities society for sophomores.” On May 21,the following ten sophomore women, with the approval of Dean Ray, M. Ellen Burkholder, President of the Women’s Self Government Association, Marie Haidt, faculty member, and Esther R. Frank, the retiring president of W.S.G.A., petitioned the Student Welfare Committee of Pennsylvania State College for recognition as an honorary activities fraternity.\n\nEleanor Dutton\n\nDelia Myer\n\nHelen F. Faust\n\nA. Pauline Myers (President)\n\nMabel A. Thomas\n\nLouise H. Fitz (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nCaroline S. Haller\n\nGrace Woodrow (Vice President)\n\nEdna May Yoke\n\nJanice L. Kauffman\n\nThese members held the following offices in extra-curricular activities at Penn State: all the class offices for the sophomore year; one or two Y.W.C.A. cabinet members, a member of the Senate (W.S.G.A); treasurer of W.S.G.A.; and other memberships on the Customs Committee (W.S.G.A.). The petition said in part that the organization wished “to be known as Cwens. The group are made up of girls who have been outstanding during their freshman year for scholarship, personality, and participation in activities and were chosen by Dean Ray, Miss Haidt, and the retiring and newly elected presidents of the Women’s Self Government Association from lists sent in by instructors, leaders of activities, and class officers.” Dean Charlotte Ray and Gertrude Toewe were named as honorary members. Upon acceptance as an activity on the Penn State campus, the chapter was installed as a member of the National Society of Cwens on June 4, 1927, by national officers and members from the Alpha Chapter.\n\nNote: Delta Chapter is now inactive.\n\nEPSILON\n\nAllegheny College\n\nThe Fifth Chapter of Cwens\n\nEpsilon Chapter at Allegheny College, Meadville, PA, was founded in the spring of 1927, following correspondence between Dean Wren Staley, Dean Amos, and Jeannette McClure. Under the leadership of Dean Staley, a committee of faculty women selected secretly ten outstanding freshman women. They were: Elizabeth Bunner, Martha Langworthy, Laura Byers, Elizabeth Schieck, Marjorie Cole, Margaret Snee, Ida Hammond, Margaret Squieres, Thelma Karlen, and Sarah Wakefield.\n\nThey were chosen as the most representative freshman leaders. Dean Staley had received permission of the national president to use the name Cwens, because she wished this new group to be affiliated as quickly as possible with the National Society of Cwens. One night “after hours”, so the record goes, when all of the students were in the dormitory, the girls who had been chosen were called downstairs to Dean Staley’s apartment in the dormitory. They were told about the National Society of Cwens, and that they had been chosen as Cwens at Allegheny. It came as a total surprise and brought a pleasure which most of them consider “one of the outstanding experiences of their college lives.”\n\nThis is the only chapter that had its beginning in a tapping ceremony. The Allegheny Cwens sent delegates to the national convention at Pittsburgh, May 10, 1927, where they petitioned the national society for recognition. This was given, and in the fall of 1927, the Allegheny Cwens were installed in the national society as Epsilon Chapter. Installation took place in the “Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority rooms on the fourth floor of Hulings Hall” and was conducted by the national officers and the Cwens from the Alpha Chapter at Pitt.\n\nQuickly responding to Title Nine, the Epsilon Chapter of Cwens succeeded in providing a smooth transition to the Epsilon Chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society. Selection of new members included a vote by the members of their class, an evaluation of their extra-curricular activities and their cumulative grade report and interaction with members of the Selection Committee (Cwens, faculty members and student leaders) at a Make-Your-Own-Sundae were notified of their acceptance through the mail.\n\nZETA\n\nMuskingum College\n\nThe Sixth Chapter of Cwens\n\nCwens, a sophomore women’s honorary, disbanded in 1976 because of the Title IX regulations of 1972. In its place a new honor society including sophomore men and women was formed. On March 6, 1976, the Lambda Sigma Society came into being. At their first national convention at Westminster College, October 24-26, 1976, the national officers were elected. They are as follows:\n\nJane Harmon, President\n\nMary Ann Allen, Vice President\n\nWendy Wells, Recording Secretary\n\nJ.J. Uluch, Publications Editor\n\nFollowing the national organization, the Cwens at Muskingum College which was chartered in 1927 was disbanded and the Zeta Chapter of Lambda Sigma Society was begun! The following students were tapped April 9, 1976, and inducted into membership April 19,1976, to become the charter members of the organization.\n\nBarbara Bauer\n\nAndy Liggett\n\nBarbara Bell\n\nDon Mason\n\nFrank Cappetta\n\nRon Mazeroski\n\nLyndon Christman\n\nMolly Mock\n\nLeslie Conger\n\nLinda Mokay\n\nSusan Douglass\n\nLarry Overmire\n\nJudy Falcsik\n\nMatthew Palmer\n\nSusan Fellows\n\nKevin Peck\n\nKay Fischer\n\nSteve Porter\n\nPamula Gruzinski\n\nJohn Robinett\n\nDouglas Henshaw\n\nNancy Shearer\n\nDavid Hobart\n\nShelly Skvoretz\n\nDana Horton\n\nSharon Snode\n\nPatricia Jenkins\n\nDean Turner\n\nTerry Kelley\n\nMelanie Warren\n\nJohn Lee\n\nJoyce Westerkamp (President)\n\nETA\n\nCarnegie-Mellon University\n\nThe Seventh Chapter of Cwens\n\nIn December, 1927, Dean Thyrsa Amos, in answer to a letter from Dean Mary Watson Green of Carnegie Institute of Technology, inquiring about Cwens, said, “I am enclosing a little material on Cwens. As you know, it is an honorary sophomore society, and the girls are chosen for scholarship, leadership, and personality. It corresponds very much to Mortar Board of the senior year, and Druids, the men’s honorary sophomore fraternity.” During December, 1927, Margaret Wegeley, Katherine H. Anderson and Dean Green worked together to organize a sophomore honorary. In the beginning of the year, the following girls of the freshman class were selected to form the new society.\n\nSally Beatty\n\nIsabel Levin\n\nRuth Buckwaiter\n\nRuth Lieberman (President)\n\nDoris Mather\n\nGrace L. Borgerding\n\nGladys Mitchell\n\nAnn G. Dickinson\n\nJane Moses\n\nFaith Hanna\n\nHelen Mylrea (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nEleanor Lemon (Vice President)\n\nElsa Weber\n\nOn November 13, 1926, the Carnegie Tech Student Council recognized the new group called Acleas as an honor society for sophomore women. On March 19, 1929, Dean Mary Watson Green and others recommended Acleas to the National Society of Cwens. A delegate from Acleas attended the national convention at Pennsylvania State College on March 22, 23, and 24, 1929. The convention received Acleas and designated it as prospective Eta Chapter.\n\nOn May 2, 1929, Acleas was installed as Cwens, Eta Chapter. Miss Margaret Wegeley and Dean Green were made honorary members. In the spring of 1976, Eta Chapter decided to reorganize and admit male students, following the recommendation of the National Society of Cwens. Those selected to be the first members of the new Eta Chapter of Lambda Sigma were:\n\nJean Monica Becker\n\nStephen H. Montgomery\n\nRoberta Chin\n\nCaryl B. Moskowitz\n\nAndrea Cummis (Vice President)\n\nJoan Cunningham\n\nDeirdre Mullan\n\nLinda Annette Deak\n\nJohn M. Perlich, Jr.\n\nL. Lisa deSandes\n\nRita Jane Rettger\n\nLynn D. Dewees\n\nPaulette Gail Rosner\n\nLaurie Ann Fedigan\n\nPaul Frederick Sacher\n\nLouis John Giovannini\n\nMichele Maria Scalzitti\n\nRobert A. Harris (Secretary)\n\nLouis Herta\n\nCarol Schwarzwaelder (President)\n\nEllen J. Silverman\n\nCharles E. Hochstetler\n\nAndrew Struble\n\nEdith P. Kohn\n\nCarlton Stuebing\n\nAmy Lynn Levine\n\nCatherine Maureen Walsh (Treasurer)\n\nCarolyn Ellen Welty\n\nSuellen Marsha Meyer\n\nThomas J. Zacharias\n\nTHETA\n\nUniversity of Kentucky\n\nThe Eighth Chapter of Cwens\n\nOn November 4, 1924, when the first attempts were made to have a general conference on the advisability of a national sophomore honor society, Dean Sara G. Blanding of the University of Kentucky wrote to Dean Thyrsa Amos. “We have no sophomore organization at the University of Kentucky.”\n\nSix years later, November 21, 1930, Dean Blanding’s assistant, Dean Sarah Holmes, wrote to Dean Amos: “Tell me something about the history and object of this organization and send me any printed material you may have. I am thinking of establishing a sophomore honorary fraternity on the campus of the University of Kentucky and for this reason am interested in Cwens.” Miss Amos replied telling something of the Pitt Chapter and its program. “I have asked Margaret Hall,” she concluded, “the national president, to correspond further with you.” As a result, Dean Blanding, Dean Holmes, and the officers of the Women’s Self Government Association organized a local honorary for sophomores. Fifteen freshman girls were chosen, and publicly tapped at a W.S.G.A. banquet, March 12, 1931. They were given the name, “Fifteen,” from the number chosen. They were:\n\nAlice Bruner\n\nMildred Neal\n\nJacqueline Bull\n\nMary O’Brien\n\nHortense Carter (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nEleanor Dawson\n\nMary Elizabeth Price\n\nJane Dyer (Vice President)\n\nDorothy Gould\n\nAyleene Razor\n\nIsabelle Isrig\n\nMargaret Le Stourgeon\n\nMary King Montgomery\n\nRuth Wehle\n\nLois Neal (President)\n\nTwo weeks later, March 26, 1931, “Fifteen” sponsored the first sorority sing, later to become an all-university tradition. In the fall of 1931, correspondence was begun with the National Society of Cwens, concerning induction into it. On October 24, 1931, the National President, Margaret Hall, installed “Fifteen” as Theta Chapter of Cwens.\n\nThe spring of 1976 brought with it the decision to change the name of Cwens to that of the Lambda Sigma Society. In addition to changing the name, several bylaws were changed with the most important one changing this sophomore honorary to a coed honorary rather than accepting strictly young women as in the past. All the individual chapters retained their same names, and Lambda Sigma began its first year as a new, yet already established, honor society for outstanding men and women of sophomore standing. Ultimately, thirty-three members, seventeen males and sixteen females, were chosen from approximately ninety of those who expressed interested. They were:\n\nBob Belle\n\nGregg Learned\n\nLeann Bleakney\n\nDoug Lukasik\n\nSam Brown\n\nArt Marziale\n\nTom Carter\n\nBarb Mock\n\nDave Clajch\n\nJim D’Dwyer\n\nKaren Davis\n\nKarin Olsen\n\nDon Delach\n\nPatty Sennett\n\nKathy Derr\n\nPatty Slovick\n\nSharon Dicker\n\nSue Spencer\n\nJoanne Dixon\n\nJohn Spencer\n\nJim Freeman\n\nTodd Steck\n\nChris Fustine\n\nAl Thomas\n\nDave Clajch\n\nEllen Thomas\n\nLisa Howrelook\n\nNancy Welsh\n\nJeff Hummel\n\nTom Wormer\n\nVicki Johnston\n\nSteve Wylie\n\nKaren Kapsanis\n\nKaren Killam\n\nSoon after notification, the new members attended an initiation dinner held in the Skylight Dining Hall.\n\nNote: Theta Chapter is now inactive.\n\nIOTA\n\nUniversity of Mississippi\n\nThe Ninth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe “Triads”, sophomore local honor society for girls at the University of Mississippi, was organized in 1937-38, with a nucleus of 16 girls. Barbara Butts served as president, and Mrs. Jeff K. Hamm and Mrs. W.A. Coulter (wives of faculty members) served as sponsors. After some correspondence with the national organization from the group, Mrs. Sarah B. Holmes visited the campus in the spring of 1940, then recommended that “Triads” be accepted as a new chapter of Cwens.\n\nAt the biennial convention in October, 1940, the delegates voted to accept “Triads” petition. Marjorie Dee Hopkins, their president, who was present as an unofficial delegate, was initiated at the Feast. On March 1, 1941, “Triads” were installed as Iota Chapter of Cwens. Because of illness of Helen Faust, National President, Nancy B. Sutch, National Executive Secretary, initiated the group. Present also were Mrs. Holmes and three girls from the University of Kentucky – Betty South, Lorraine Harris, and Jean Williams -who assisted. The fifteen active members included:\n\nJean Bordeaux\n\nAnnie Glenn Johnson\n\nMelva Cartwright\n\nMartha Polk Perkins (Treasurer)\n\nMarguerite Phelps\n\nJane Coffer\n\nElizabeth Puller\n\nMary Courtney\n\nMildred Ramsey\n\nHelen Cunavant\n\nRuth Ray\n\nFrances Garrett (Secretary)\n\nAnn Rowan (Vice President)\n\nMarjorie Dee Hopkins\n\nLotta Swaze (President)\n\nAlumnae members initiated were:\n\nMary Elizabeth Cook\n\nOleta Shows\n\nLillian Dooley\n\nNorma Shuford\n\nMary Margaret Grass\n\nNell Spenser\n\nBae Kramer\n\nJuanita Walker\n\nLanelle Long\n\nSidney Watson\n\nMargaret McCoy\n\nYvette Williams\n\nNinnabel Neilson\n\nCatherine Winn\n\nPolly Rankin\n\nIota Chapter had already completed its selection process in the spring of 1976 when word came of the proposed changes in the national organization. At the first meeting in the fall of 1976, members were informed of the creation of Lambda Sigma, and they agreed to become a part of the new organization. Plans were formulated to make the transition year productive and meaningful.\n\nKAPPA\n\nSeton Hill College\n\nThe Tenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nLothians,” a local honorary, was organized at Seton Hill College, Greensburg, PA., in 1942. As a project, the chapter published the “Greenbook,” a clever and attractive handbook for freshman women entering Seton Hill College.\n\nAfter the chapter’s petition was received by the Executive Secretary, Betty Teal, National Vice-President, visited the chapter in the spring of 1945, to help organize credentials and inspect it. The chapter was accepted by the chapters of Cwens on June 4, 1945. Formal installation was held the week-end of October 20, 1945 with two national officers present: Ann Melick, President, and Betty Teal, Vice- President, assisted by four Cwens form Pitt, Alpha Chapter. The examination was given Saturday afternoon and the installation was held on Sunday. The original chapter advisers were Sister Maurice and Sister Muriel. The following girls were initiated:\n\nMarjorie Anthony\n\nCarmille Larghi\n\nPat Bickel (Historian)\n\nDolores Callahan\n\nPat Liddell\n\nMary Camiolo (President)\n\nJoan Daley\n\nCatherine Ruddle (Secretary)\n\nMarjorie Firsching (Treasurer)\n\nMarie Teresa Spoerlein\n\nFlora Gorirossi\n\nVirginia Steel\n\nMary C. Hackett (Vice President)\n\nAlice Kosmerl\n\nNOTE: Kappa Chapter is now inactive.\n\nLAMBDA\n\nWestminster College\n\nThe Eleventh Chapter of Cwens\n\n“Scepter”, a local honor society, was organized at Westminster College, New Wilmington, PA, in 1942. It petitioned the Executive Secretary and was accepted by the chapters of Cwens on June 4, 1945. It was installed as Lambda Chapter of Cwens on the weekend of October 27, 1945. National Officers present at the installation were: President, Ann Melick, Vice President, Betty Teal, and four Tech Cwens. The following members of “Scepter” were initiated into Cwens:\n\nGloria Ashbaugh\n\nGrace Jones\n\nMarilyn Ashbaugh\n\nWinifred McCalmont (Vice President)\n\nMargaret McClure\n\nAnn Babbitt\n\nJeanne Myers\n\nMarie Baumann\n\nBarbara Peters (Secretary)\n\nLois Burton (President)\n\nMartha Shoup\n\nRuth DeHaven\n\nMary Ellen Stewart\n\nAnna May Fitzsimmons\n\nLois Utley (Treasurer)\n\nWilma Woods\n\nAnna Grill\n\nWith the dissolution of the National Society of Cwens at hand, the Lambda Cwens and a local sophomore men’s honor society, Thanes, decided to merge, thus complying with the recent Title IX regulations. Each organization tapped a new class in the spring of 1976. With new initiates combined, the coed group was called the Sophomore Honorary. On May 18, 1976, Westminister’s Sophomore Honorary voted to become a chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society. The Lambda Chapter included the following:\n\nAnn Ague\n\nSusan McNamara\n\nJudy Bowdler\n\nTraci Meadows\n\nMary Buchanan\n\nMarla Messett\n\nDoug Burr\n\nGrad Mortiz\n\nCarl Campbell\n\nKurt Muehlheuser\n\nJeff Canose (Vice President)\n\nMomodou Ceesay\n\nSue Muskrave\n\nBarb Davis\n\nDave Nesbit\n\nDeb DeMeester\n\nBille Pearce\n\nGordon Dufour\n\nAmy Peterson\n\nSuzanne Elway\n\nBeth Prosser\n\nJeanette Ford\n\nLucinda Rowe\n\nJudy Geis\n\nRick Scheffield (Secretary)\n\nRob Sheehan\n\nRick Grejuda (Vice President)\n\nHal Hartley\n\nGreg Smith\n\nMark Howell\n\nBarb Stiver\n\nMark Huber\n\nDebbie Uhlman\n\nTodd Ireland (Treasurer)\n\nSuzanne Keith\n\nPete Waite (President)\n\nTodd Weaver\n\nPete Waite\n\nCindy Wilt\n\nPaul Koenig\n\nBill Woodman\n\nLarry Lloyd\n\nBob Wright\n\nChris Loizeaux\n\nIrene Zucharias\n\nScott Magnuson\n\nMU\n\nEastern Kentucky University\n\nThe Twelfth Chapter of Cwens\n\nIn the spring of 1945, a group of freshman girls who had maintained a grade standing of 1.80 (on a three point system) for the first two quarters of that year met with Mrs. Emma Y. Case, Dean of Women, to discuss the possibility of forming a sophomore women’s honor society at Eastern Kentucky State College in Richmond, Kentucky. Case had felt a definite need for a service organization of this type on Eastern’s campus.\n\nThe group learned about Cwens and the three year probation period. The following fall they began work as a service organization and chose as the name of their organization “Prota Decca”, which means first ten. Since “Prota Decca” was the first group of this type on the campus, theirs was the task of forming policies and setting precedents. That fall, they had as their guests at a dinner, Mrs. Holmes, then sponsor of Theta Cwens at the University of Kentucky; the Dean of Women; and the President of the Cwens Chapter at the University of Kentucky. Their advice and suggestions proved to be very helpful during the year.\n\nThe 1946-47 edition of “Prota Decca” continued its program of service, but broadened its activities considerably. In the spring quarter of 1946, twenty-two girls were initiated into “Prota Decca”. The “Prota Decca” was installed as Mu Chapter of Cwens on March 11, 1948. In the spring of 1976, when the national organization announced its plans to form a new co-educational honor society for sophomores named Lambda Sigma, the Mu Chapter elected to affiliate with the new society and to initiate young men as well as young women in the spring of 1977. Long-time advisor Dr. Martha Grise continued with Lambda Sigma and Dr. Ron Wolfe joined her as faculty advisor in 1977.\n\nNU\n\nUniversity of Louisville\n\nThe Thirteenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nNu chapter at the University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, was founded locally in the Spring of 1950. Under the direction of the Mortar Board chapter, sixteen freshman women were chosen to form the local group to be known as the THINKERS:\n\nJoan Brietbeil\n\nOla Miracle\n\nHelen Clark (Publicity)\n\nCarol Cochran\n\nPeggy Moll\n\nEileen Connolley\n\nDoris Russell (Treasurer)\n\nSelma Goodman (Secretary)\n\nJanice Shroder\n\nJulie Groeber\n\nBarbara Wellendorf\n\nInga Hirschheimer\n\nJoanne Wilkinson\n\nJoanne Knight (Vice President)\n\nBetty Wolfe (President)\n\nAnnette Lillard\n\nDefinite standards for membership in the THINKERS were set up. Scholastically, a girl had to be in the first third of her class, and to further qualify, she must have evidenced outstanding service on the Louisville campus. While it remained local, THINKERS worked under the supervision of Mortar Board and the Dean of Women at the University of Louisville, Miss Hilda Threlkeld. There were two additional groups of THINKERS tapped in the two following years. In the Spring of 1952, THINKERS petitioned Cwens for membership as Nu Chapter; the group was inspected and approved by Mrs. Sarah B. Holmes, Dean of Women at the University of Kentucky and advisor to the Cwen National Board, and upon the further approval of the individual chapters of Cwens was duly installed at Louisville on October 18, 1952. The installation ceremony was carried out under the supervision of Miss Duella Stranahan, National Executive-Secretary of Cwens, aided by active Cwens from Theta and Mu Chapters.\n\nNote: Nu is now inactive.\n\nXI\n\nGrove City College\n\nThe Fourteenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe first members of Crown and Sceptre, local sophomore women’s honorary society of Grove City College, were tapped by members of Alpha Theta Mu, Senior Women’s honorary society, at the May Day exercises in May, 1951. Sixteen freshman women who had shown outstanding qualities in leadership, scholarship and service were chosen to organize and build the new honorary society.\n\nDuring the first year, the members of Crown and Sceptre carried on numerous projects of benefit to every member of the college. At the May Day program in May, 1952, the charter members of this group turned their duties over to eleven freshman women who would continue the established projects besides sponsoring new ones. Crown and Sceptre submitted its petition to become Cwens during the summer of 1952.\n\nMabel DeForest Angelo, Extension Chairman, inspected the group and upon her recommendation, the individual Cwen chapters voted unanimously to accept them into the membership of the National Society of Cwens. Epsilon, accepting the responsibility as the installing chapter, and Lambda Chapters participated at the installation of Xi Chapter on April 11, 1953. Miss Duella Stranahan, Executive Secretary, and Mrs. Mabel Riddle, Vice-President, were present to aid the Extension Chairman with the installation proceedings. Twenty-three members were initiated. At the annual May Day Program, 1953, fourteen freshman women were tapped to be chapter members of Cwens, Xi Chapter. They were:\n\nBarbara Brock\n\nMargaret Pringle\n\nRuth Christy\n\nViola Roberts\n\nSue Davidson\n\nLaVonne Rudolph\n\nJanet Diefenderfer\n\nNancy Rupp\n\nShirley Gills (Treasurer)\n\nLouise Slavcoff (Vice President)\n\nLinda Johnson (President)\n\nJanet Stoller (Secretary)\n\nDeLois Maloney\n\nEdna Zipay\n\nNote: Xi is now inactive.\n\nOMICRON\n\nNorthern Illinois University\n\nThe Fifteenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nIn the spring of 1931, Nu Alpha Lambda was established as a sophomore women’s honor society at what was then Northern Illinois State Teacher’s College. Its purpose was to foster higher standards in education and to promote leadership and service to the college among freshman women.\n\nIn 1954, under the guidance of the Dean of Women, Ruth Haddock, Nu Alpha Lambda petitioned for membership into Cwens. The Nu Alpha Lambda officers and advisors were initiated into Cwens at the national convention of 1954, and the Omicron Chapter of Cwens was installed in DeKalb, Illinois on December 5, 1954.\n\nCwens had thrived throughout the years due to efforts of many members and advisors; among them, advisors Ruth Haddock and Joy Nelson. Since its beginning, Cwens has seen changes come both in its organization and in its chapters. Northern Illinois State Teachers College became Northern Illinois University in 1957 and now enrolls over 21,000 on-campus students in five undergraduate colleges and the graduate school.\n\nThe 45 Cwens members have determined their program of social, service, and educational events annually. A long-standing Cwens (now Lambda Sigma) project has been ushering for university theatrical productions, football games, and commencement exercises. The most dramatic change in Omicron Chapter’s history came in the fall of 1976 when the chapter was informed that Cwens had been dissolved and that a new national organization was being formed. 1976-77 President Rose Tonies, Vice-President Nancy Kowal, Sandy Bialek, and advisor Denise Rode, attended the national convention at Westminister College to learn about the changes. They came back full of enthusiasm for Lambda Sigma and succeeded in spreading this to the rest of the chapter. Within a few months of hard work on the part of members and officers, the transition was complete. At the first Lambda Sigma feast on April 22, 1977, 18 men and 27 women were initiated into the Lambda Sigma Society at NIU. The Omicron Chapter, proud of its past in Cwens, looks forward with optimism to its future in Lambda Sigma.\n\nPI\n\nAuburn University\n\nThe Sixteenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nMay, 1976, Pi Chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society tapped its first members on the Auburn University campus. Its immediate forerunner was Pi Chapter of the National Society of Cwens. The original group, which became Cwens, was a local organization called Owls Honor Society.\n\nOwls was founded in 1940 to recognize scholastic ability and campus leadership in the sophomore women’s honor society, Cardinal Key. During the following years, Owls did many service and social projects for the University and the community. The Owls Honor Society petitioned the National Society of Cwens, sophomore women’s honor society, for membership and Mrs. Allene B. Swanson, Extension Chairman of Cwens, visited the campus to inspect the local honor society. Owls’ petition to affiliate with the National Society of Cwens as approved and on May 18, 1957, Pi Chapter of Cwens was installed at Alabama Polytechnic Institute.\n\nForty-nine charter, alumnae, and honorary members were initiated by Mrs. Mabel D. Angelo, National President of Cwens, and Mu Chapter, Eastern Kentucky State College. From 1957 to 1976, over 600 women were tapped into Pi Chapter. In March, 1976, Pi Chapter voted to comply with the National Executive Board’s decision to create a new national honor society for outstanding freshman men and women out of the National Society for Cwens. After a farewell banquet for Cwens, Pi Chapter turned its attention to the newly-formed honor society. This new honor society was named the Lambda Sigma Society.\n\nIn May, Pi Chapter selected the men and women who were to be the first members of Lambda Sigma at Auburn University. On May 13, 1976, the first Lambda Sigma members were tapped into Pi Chapter at a surprise breakfast. After an organizational meeting, Pi Chapter had an initiation banquet for its new members. The first male ever to be president of Pi Chapter was installed along with the other officers at the banquet. Based on its rich heritage and on the enduring ideals of the new society, Pi Chapter of Lambda Sigma has begun and will continue to be an inspiring and vital influence in the lives of its members and that of Auburn University.\n\nRHO\n\nThiel College\n\nThe Seventeenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nCynelic, an honor society fraternity for sophomore women, was organized at Thiel College in the spring of 1956, under the guidance of Miss Dorothy J. Maple, Dean of Women. In organizing this group, Miss Marple received information and help from the National City and Allegheny Colleges. It was hoped that the organization would receive a bid for membership from Cwens at some time in the future. Twelve senior women were chosen as sponsors for the proposed group. These twelve women were honor students, some being members of “Who’s Who In American Colleges And Universities”.\n\nThe name Cynelic was chosen from a list of suitable Anglo-Saxon words. The meaning is “royal”; thus, the colors purple and white were chosen for the group. From a list of twenty-nine names submitted by the nominating committee, the election committee chose ten girls, who met a long list of qualifications. The names of the women chosen were announced on April 24, 1957, at a college assembly. Service projects, especially for freshman women, were the aim of the first group. On Class Awards Day, May 1, 1958, the names of the second group of eleven Cynelic members were announced. Cynelic received a bid to join the National Society of Cwens during 1958. The eleven new Cynelic members of 1959 were tapped on April 28, 1959. These girls became the charter members of Rho Cwens. They are:\n\nKaren Benson\n\nJudith Myers\n\nMarsha Clark\n\nLinda Smith\n\nMary Lynn Coddington\n\nBrigitte Smorodsky\n\nCarol Sue Edmiston\n\nJudith Stutzman\n\nDorothy Ermacoff\n\nBarbara Taylor\n\nBrenda Hamilton\n\nThen on May 3, 1959, the Xi Chapter of Cwens, of Grove City College, arrived at Thiel to formally initiate them into the Cwens The year of 1976-77, was a transitory time in which the Rho Chapter of Cwens at Thiel College changed over to Lambda Sigma.\n\nSIGMA\n\nAlfred University\n\nThe Eighteenth Chapter of Cwen\n\nAlfred University was established in March 1957 and twelve outstanding freshman women were chosen as charter members of the sophomore women’s honorary. Selected on the basis of scholarship, leadership, character, and service, the members were active in the sophomore year. Miss Lavinia Creighton, Director of Women’s Athletics, was elected faculty advisor, and together with the Dean of Women, Nancy Gullette, guided Cwentessence as its program developed.\n\nThe campus readily recognized the new organization as it carried on an active program of service to the University. Serving as Orientation Week hostesses, campus guides for prospective students, ushers at convocations, aides at student and administrative social functions, and conducting rental of the University Print Collection were some of the innumerable services given by Cwentessence. In 1959, the local group desired to become a chapter of National Society of Cwens and Mrs. Donald Swanson, Extension Chairman, visited them on their campus in the foothills of the Alleghenies. Their petition was approved and on May 16, 1959, Miss Alice Smolkovich, Vice President, and Epsilon Chapter of Allegheny College installed Sigma Chapter and initiated nineteen members. Newly tapped freshmen were:\n\nGloria Bletter\n\nMarion Rothberg\n\nMarilyn Chapel (Vice President)\n\nRose Ciullo\n\nWendy Schoenbach\n\nJudith Douglass\n\nCarol Sloan (Treasurer)\n\nSusan Wolf\n\nSandra Kaplan (President)\n\nM. Alice Ogden\n\nAlumnae and honorary members were:\n\nMiss Lavinia Creightn\n\nNona Serlen\n\nKathleen Erb\n\nRuth Silverman\n\nCarolyn Erikson\n\nSandra Zimmerman\n\nMrs. Margaret Klitzke\n\nJacquelyn Zinke\n\nMary Newton\n\nNote: Sigma is now inactive.\n\nTAU\n\nUniversity of Kansas\n\nThe Nineteenth Chapter of Cwens\n\nFor a number of years, the Associated Women Students at the University of Kansas sponsored a sophomore counseling program with the main purpose of helping new freshman women in their transition to college.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1957, the sophomore counselors changed their name to Jay Sisters and expanded their program. In order to make the program more effective, only 85 women were given the name Jay Sister. They were selected on the basis of interest, grades, citizenship, and recommendations. Two major changes were made in the program of 1959-60. There were new emphases on scholarship and culture. Fifty-two women were selected according to the following criteria: 1.5 (or B-) grade average, participation in campus activities, and responsible citizenship in the residence halls. The members worked on projects similar to those of the previous years. Again, they helped in Orientation Week, Associated Women’s Students’ programs, and other major areas of service to their university.\n\nThe Jay Sisters encouraged freshman women to attend music recitals, university drama productions, Student Union forums, and other campus cultural events. Each Jay Sister and her freshman women friends attended at least two cultural events per semester. In the spring of 1960, the Associated Women Students petitioned the National Society of Cwens for membership. In the hopes that the Jay Sisters would become the Cwens honorary, the selections for the school year of 1960-61 were made in accordance with all requirements for membership in the National Society of Cwens.\n\nEach member was assigned to a corridor in the freshman residence halls, and worked with these young women during the year. The program now included special emphases on the developing of cultural interests in the freshman women, assisting with projects and programs of the Associated Women Students, serving the University of Kansas, and providing incentives for freshman achievement. On November 19 and 20, 1960, Dean Emily Taylor; Mrs. J.B. Stroup, assistant to the Dean of Women; Nan Newton, A.W.S. advisor to Jay Sisters; Sue Hardisty, president of the 1960-61 Jay Sister organization; George Ann Porter, vice-president; Linda, secretary; and Sharon Saylor, rituals chairman; attended the Eighteenth National Convention of the National Society of Cwens. Mrs. Stroup and the five students were initiated into the society and received a charter for the University of Kansas Jay Sister organization as Tau Chapter of the National Society of Cwens. Dean Taylor was already a member.\n\nThese women initiated the rest of the 1960-61 Jay Sisters on January 15, 1961. Honorary members and alumnae members were also initiated into Tau Chapter, the first Cwen Chapter west of the Mississippi. On November 13, 1975, the Cwens group called a meeting to decide its stand on Title IX. The choices included disbanding, moving off campus, or admitting men. The question was discussed seriously, and the decision was to admit men. A task force was formed, made up of six women, with the stipulation that six men also join. The women met on November 21, 1975, in the Dean of Women’s Office, in order to find six qualified men to join the women.\n\nThe Dean of Men was contacted and he gave his cooperation. On December 10, 1976, an outline was drawn up describing the purpose and selection principles of the new group as well as the objectives of the task force. The purpose was to be of service to the University, with the group offering guidance to women and men in society, as students at the University of Kansas, and as persons with leadership qualities. The selection of new members would be based on scholarship, outside activities, recommendations, and peer support. The group also had a list of recommended men to join the six women.\n\nFebruary 15, 1976, was the birthday of the new organization. The name “The S.I.L. Society” was decided on. Ivy was chosen as the symbol and the colors of green and silver were approved. Subcommittees began working on the selection process, the bylaws, and the ritual. On April 14, 1976, the new group, including 13 women and 14 men, was tapped. Initiation was held on April 29, with the new officers being announced. At the new group’s first meeting, different goals were discussed, and it was decided that they would be devoted first to service to the incoming freshmen class, secondly to the service of the university, and finally to the enrichment of the society. Two representatives were chosen to attend the national meeting of the newly-forming national organization, Lambda Sigma. Plans were made for the First Annual S.I.L. Summer Reunion, which was held on the weekend of July 16-18, in Kansas City.\n\nDuring the summer of 1976, the National Cwens Society, formed Lambda Sigma Society, a coed sophomore honor society, and in the fall of 1976, the S.I.L. Society became Tau Chapter of Lambda Sigma Society.\n\nUPSILON\n\nMorehead State College\n\nThe Twentieth Chapter of Cwens\n\nCrown and Sceptre, a sophomore honor society service for women, was organized in the spring of 1959 by Dean Earlyne Saunders, Associate Dean of Students, Morehead State College. The 28 charter members were selected by the faculty on the basis of scholarship, leadership, character and the manner in which they upheld the spirit of the college.\n\nThe first semester of the 1959-60 academic year was used for the compilation of ideas and facts and the organization of the constitution which was patterned to some extent after the National Society of Cwens. The first official meeting of Crown and Sceptre was held on February 18, 1960. The constitution was ratified and the officers were elected.\n\nThe activities during the first year of Crown and Sceptre included serving as official hostesses for various functions as well as being the first dormitory counselors on the Morehead State College campus. They also collected funds and articles for the Friendship to Korea drive. A lovely spring tea for the new members concluded the first year’s successful program. Twenty-one active members participated in the final year’s activity of the two-year probationary period before petitioning for Cwens membership. The girls served as counselors, assistant house directors in two women’s dormitories, and official campus hostesses. They served also as ushers for the Civic Celebrity Concert Series, monitors of extra study rooms during final exam time, and “Campus Campers” for freshmen orientation. A Christmas project included the decoration of a Christmas tree in the lobby of the Doran Student House and the playing of carols in the cafeteria.\n\nMrs. Donald Swanson, National Extension Chairman, visited the campus to see the organization in the spring of 1960. The chapter was accepted by the National Society of Cwens in August, 1961. On Saturday, November 18, 1961, Upsilon Chapter of Cwens was installed on the Morehead State College campus. Miss Alice Smolkovich, National Vice President and Ritual Chairman, was present for the initiation. One of the three sister chapters in Kentucky, Nu Chapter from the University of Louisville and their sponsor, Mrs. Doris Stokes, National Advisory Dean, came to share the occasion with the Morehead girls. The National Society of Cwens presented a Cwens banner and a charter, and the Nu chapter gave some ritual equipment. The active members initiated were:\n\nDonna Alexander\n\nJudy Henky\n\nDeanna Barker\n\nWanda Holbrook\n\nDiann Barker\n\nDeannie Kohls\n\nMary Sue Barlow\n\nChristie Lepper\n\nPatty Burton\n\nMartha Lewis\n\nBeverly Chapman\n\nJune Martin\n\nJudy Corum\n\nMelinda Moore\n\nSue Galbreath\n\nJudy Prichard\n\nThirty members of Crown and Sceptre were initiated as alumnae. The 1976-77 members of Cwens had the responsibility of writing the constitution in preparation for the change over to the Upsilon Chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society. This change was brought about due to the constitutional ruling prohibiting gender discrimination. Dean Anna Mae Riggle served as adviser for Cwens for many years. Mr. Tom Scott is our main adviser and Mrs. Carolyn Flatt also served as associate advisor.\n\nNote: Upsilon is now inactive.\n\nPHI\n\nUnion College\n\nThe Twenty-First Chapter of Cwens\n\nFeeling that there was a definite need for a women’s honor sorority on the Union College campus, Dr. Mary C. Owen began the preliminary steps for the organization of a chapter of the Cwens in the spring of 1959. The women students of the class of 1962 who had an average of 2.00 (B) or greater at the mid-semester of the second semester of 1959 met with Dr. Owen and discussed the organization and the prerequisites for the formation of a chapter. During the summer of 1959, all eligible girls received notification and further information about the plans. In the fall of 1959, the group of girls began the steps for the information of a Cwens chapter.\n\nFollowing a booklet furnished by the national organization, they chose the name Beta Sigma and selected a leader, Miss Lanie Pendleton, and a sponsor, Dr. Mary C. Owen. The group decided that they would in their duties as a service organization try to serve the college and the community. During the year, they made tray favors for the local hospital, were available for story sessions at the hospital, encouraged the members of the class of 1963 to higher scholarship, and made themselves helpful whenever needed. Twice during the year, they met with members of the class of 1963 to explain the group.\n\nBoth inactive and active members met in the fall of 1960 for the second year of work. Miss Isabell Littleton was selected as the leader for the year, and the organization continued on its service projects. More definite plans for the national affiliation were being made and followed through. The sale of personalized stationary and pizzas in the dormitory were the money-makers. Definite decisions as to choice of faculty advisors, Miss Larue Millen and Mrs. Christine Merchant, were made. Members were appointed to assume the responsibility for preparing the materials that must be presented to the National Extension Chairman, Mrs. Donald Swanson, when the chapter formally applied for membership in Cwens. Again, the group met with all the freshman girls (class of 1964) to acquaint them with the organization. At the close of the second semester of the 1960-61 school year, the group made formal application for national membership.\n\nArnita Clark\n\nMarie Eloise Newsom\n\nLynn Dietrich\n\nJoyce Peacock\n\nAice Dudley (Vice President)\n\nRuth Gleason\n\nCassandra Tignor\n\nSharon Harriman (President)\n\nCarolyn Sue Akers\n\nLinda McGoughy\n\nPatsy Allen\n\nNancy Anne Moore\n\nAlice Blackman\n\nJeannie Rice\n\nCarolyn Burns\n\nKathryn E.

Presiding over the installation was Miss Alice Smolkovich, National Vice President, assisted by 12 Iota Cwens from the University of Mississippi. Delta Beta Omicron, the sophomore service organization that served as Chi Chapter’s forerunner, had been in existence on the campus for six years. Fifty-three members were initiated in the May 2 ceremony. These included the 25 members of the 1964-65 group, 24 alumnae members, and honorary members, Miss Adelaide Murdock, Dr. Reba K. Neel, Miss Annis Cawthon, and Dean of Women, June W. Dyson. Charter members included:\n\nKay Albritton\n\nNancy Greenwood\n\nFrances Anders\n\nAnn Hardin\n\nJohnnie Ruth Beasley\n\nMelba Headrick\n\nElizabeth Bernard\n\nKathleen Higgs\n\nLynda Brooks\n\nDelores Ingram\n\nZella Faye Brown\n\nJonelle Kellogg\n\nDora Doty\n\nMary Kite\n\nCamille Duchesne\n\nHelen McBridge\n\nMarion Kay Enloe\n\nAnita Frances Shadow\n\nMargaret Estes\n\nSharon Teague\n\nRosemary Estes\n\nCarol Jean Waggonner\n\nAlice Marie Fulgham\n\nBonita Carmelle Worsham\n\nSondra Fulmer\n\nAnn Adams\n\nCarolyn Hunter\n\nFrankie Adams\n\nCarolyn Jones\n\nDorothy Alford\n\nMary Esther Lewis\n\nCorre Ann Anding\n\nJudith Lipscomb\n\nM.

Also, at that meeting, forty-six members were initiated:\n\nLeah Alexander\n\nLauren Livingston\n\nCheryl Aulds\n\nTeresa Martin\n\nGwendolyn Aulds\n\nPatricia May\n\nCynthia Balentine\n\nAprile McGee\n\nBetty Bellando\n\nWendy Morgan\n\nMartina Blackwell\n\nKathy Patterson\n\nGail Burford\n\nJanet Plaxco\n\nCheryl Calcote\n\nRamona Ponder\n\nDebbie Causey\n\nJulie Redden\n\nElizabeth Cawthon\n\nSharon Richardson\n\nConniel Clark\n\nTeri Saunders\n\nCynthia Coe\n\nGail Schwartzenburg\n\nNancy Croll\n\nCindy Scorsone\n\nBonida Curry\n\nLynette Shows\n\nLinda Dozier\n\nJeri Smith\n\nKaren Dyson\n\nSally Smith\n\nCindy Engh\n\nShelia Smith\n\nJanet Gray\n\nKerry Sweeney\n\nDebbie Hayford\n\nDeborah Tindell\n\nNancy Hechler\n\nKarla Vanhoy\n\nLeslie Landry\n\nKathryn Wright\n\nRobin Lange\n\nCynthia Young\n\nMartha Littlefield\n\nCheri Zeringue\n\nAdvisor to the chapter is Miss Hermione Driskell\n\nPSI\n\nCentral Missouri State College\n\nThe Twenty-Third Chapter of Cwens\n\nPsi Chapter of Cwens, located on the campus of Central Missouri State College in Warrensburg, Missouri, was installed as the twenty-third Cwens Chapter on May 9, 1965. Officiating at the installation were members of Tau Chapter of Cwens from the University of Kansas. At that time, 12 alumnae and 3 honorary chapter members were initiated by the alumnae Cwens. Charter members:\n\nPatricia Beaty\n\nSusan Noble\n\nLinda Blacksmith\n\nSharon Pipkin\n\nNancy Brockman\n\nArlene Quell\n\nDonna Bybel\n\nLinda Stahl\n\nPriscilla Florence\n\nJanie Steiner\n\nTracy Hayes\n\nMarjory C.

Mayfield (Dean of Women)\n\nIn 1975, in anticipation of Title IX requirements, Psi Chapter chose to include both men and women students in all activities. Invitations to Lambda Sigma Society were accepted by both men and women. Russell Rennison, Perry Luetkemeyer, Arthur McFarland, and Edwin Streich were the first men to become members of Psi Chapter\n\nOMEGA\n\nPittsburg State University\n\nThe Twenty-Fourth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe Omega Chapter of Cwens at Pittsburgh State University is located in a southeastern Kansas town in the heart of the Ozark recreation area. Pittsburg State University was established in 1902, and is a co-educational, state-sponsored school. The college is a multi-purpose institution whose primary objective is to offer appropriate educational programs to those in its service area. Graduate and undergraduate degrees may be reached in Arts and Sciences, Technology, Education, Business and Economics.\n\nThe national sophomore honor society, Cwens, grew out of an organization founded in 1963. Under the guidance of Miss Pat Patterson, Dean of Women at that time, Spars was established. The group was formed to encourage capable sophomore women to continue to be active on campus. Qualifications for selection consisted of outstanding work or participation in at least four of the five categories listed below\n\n1) Scholarship\n\n2) Personality\n\n3) Activities\n\n4) Recommendations\n\n5) Service\n\nThe first letter of each category formed the name, SPARS.\n\nIn the spring of 1965, the goal of the organization was finally reached. On May 14 with the help of Tau Chapter of Cwens of the University of Kansas, the Spars became the Omega Chapter of Cwens. Striving to help freshman women adjust to the college routine and interest them in the educational as well as social events, continued then, as the Cwens of Omega chapter sought the sisterhood of sincerity, simplicity, sympathy and serenity.

Baker\n\nDr. Mary Moore\n\nWhen the National Society of Cwens voted in March of 1976 to disband and reorganize to admit men (due to Title IX) the Omega Chapter of Cwens formed a task force to review the formation of a new sophomore honor society for men and women. Nine male sophomore students and one male faculty advisor were selected to join the group of ten Cwens and one advisor to form the Pittsburg State University Lambda Sigma Task Force. In April and May of 1976, the group worked diligently to develop ideas and suggestions to help with the formation of this new coed sophomore group. A new handbook covered the local rules and rituals to go along with the national Bylaws and Rituals. Cwens at Pittsburg State University became the new coed Lambda Sigma Society in April, 1977.\n\nALPHA ALPHA\n\nMt. Union College\n\nThe Twenty-Fifth Chapter of Cwens\n\nPeks, the sophomore women’s honorary at Mr. Union College, became the Alpha Alpha Chapter of Cwens on Saturday, November 19, 1966, when Alice Smolkovich, past national Vice President, assisted by Zeta Cwens from Muskingum College, initiated 10 active, 16 alumna, and 4 honorary charter members.\n\nPeks had been established for four years on Mt. Union’s campus before its Cwens affiliation. Peks was primarily a service organization, as exemplified by its name which comes from the Greek for their motto “Always On Duty.”\n\nKathryn Anderson\n\nCathie Sue Franks\n\nMarcy Callahan\n\nNeva Jones\n\nPamela Creedon\n\nCarol Lloyd\n\nElaine Dean\n\nJoyce Simmons\n\nPamela Engler\n\nSally Zuck\n\nBarbara Bacon\n\nAnne O’Connor\n\nJulie Bethel\n\nSue Porter\n\nBette Bodley\n\nCharlotte Sampson\n\nEllen Donaldson\n\nSheryl Lynn Trudicks\n\nSusan Girt\n\nNancy Ward\n\nMarilyn Hosken\n\nConnie Weber\n\nLinda Sue Moxley\n\nJane Wehner\n\nCarol Nelson\n\nJudy Willout\n\nMary Lou Barclay (adviser to Alpha Chapter)\n\nErmal Bracy (wife of the president of Mt.

In the fall of 1965, Mrs. Hjelle contacted 27 sophomore women who had been selected by Mortar Board as finalists for the 1965 Outstanding Freshman Women. This illustrious group met on October 5 and agreed to work with Mrs. Hjelle in founding such a society. The girls began immediately to write universities across the United States inquiring about similar societies on their campuses. One such letter was written to the Kansas Cwens, and the process of affiliation began.\n\nThe steering committee met in December to revise and approve the proposed constitution and elect officers. The name Pipers, symbolizing Oklahoma’s Indian heritage, was chosen. Affiliation with a national group moved along for several years. The 1967-68 group became interested in affiliation, but did not get the ball rolling before the school year was over. When the 1968-69 group was tapped, however, the prime goal was affiliation. Cwens invited Pipers to send three delegates to their National Witan at the University of Kansas in October, 1968, and Judy Yeatts, Tamsen Murray, and Mrs. Jerry Burlingame, Pipers sponsors, returned from the convention “very impressed” and urging immediate affiliation. After many letters, a visit from Lorraine Sibbet, TID editor, Pipers officially voted to affiliate with Cwens. After Cwens voted to accept Pipers as Alpha Beta Chapter, the March installation ceremony was planned.\n\nOn March 22, 1969, twenty-five Tau Cwens from the University of Kansas, together with several KU advisers, journeyed to Norman, Oklahoma, and installed Alpha Beta Chapter of Cwens at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nJanie Bumpers\n\nJocelyn Lee\n\nCindy Burner\n\nSally Livermore\n\nKaren Campbell\n\nMarles Long\n\nDiane Darrough\n\nGena MacArthur\n\nCathy Erskine\n\nMelinda McElroy\n\nPeggy Ford\n\nTamsen Murray\n\nGayle Freeman\n\nKaren Ostroot\n\nJeanne Anne Grisso\n\nMarjie Ratcliffe\n\nWendy Hilty\n\nCarol Stortz\n\nNancy Huneke\n\nDiane Theimer\n\nDonna Jackson\n\nPam Thompson\n\nJanie Johnstone\n\nKathy Ward\n\nConnie King\n\nSuzanne Williams\n\nConnie Lee\n\nJanice Cherry\n\nJudy Yeatts\n\nJerry Burlingame\n\nDorothy Truex (Adviser)\n\n(Dean of Women)\n\nNote: Alpha Beta is now inactive.\n\nALPHA GAMMA\n\nDuquesne University\n\nThe Twenty-Seventh Chapter of Cwens\n\nLambda Sigma Society, a National Sophomore Honorary Society, was formed on March 6, 1976, in Atlanta, Georgia. With the basic purpose of promoting scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship among college students, the society was thus initiated in order that these values may be attained. The specific name, Lambda Sigma Society, was chosen because of Lambda signifying leadership, and Sigma signifying scholarship, the two outstanding virtues of the society. With a total of twenty-six chapters across the nation, the new society was well under way of becoming a distinguished organization on college campuses.\n\nAt Duquesne, the Alpha Gamma Chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society, was formally initiated in the spring of 1976. With a total of 72 new members, the rather enthusiastic group began to display the virtues of the society. Under the group direction of Dean Patricia Watt and Mr. Reginald Ney, the society actively participated or coordinated such functions as the Tutor Recruiter, Commuter Overnight, College Day, Carnival, Ugly Man On Campus, Dance Marathon, and College Union Conference, to name just a few.\n\nThe concept of forming this honor society did not just come into being, but was initiated because of the National Society of Cwens. This organization was founded at the University of Pittsburgh in 1922 and it restricted its membership to sophomore women. With a purpose similar to the Lambda Sigma Society, Cwens existed for 53 years, but had to disband because of certain legislative acts. Due to Title IX, Cwens could not remain a recognized honorary organization, since it did not allow for the admittance of men. It was then decided by the National Executive Board of Cwens to establish the national sophomore honor society known as the Lambda Sigma Society. It is because of this decision that we are in existence today and are able to participate in projects such as:\n\n–Ushers for graduation\n\n–Host of the National Task Force Meeting which formulated and directed the transition of Cwens to the Lambda Sigma Society\n\n–Sponsors of the Commuter Overnight program for incoming commuter freshmen\n\n–Developers of a Tutor Recruiter Program for all Duquesne students\n\n— Guides for high school students on College Day\n\n–Sponsors of a couple in the Duquesne Dance Marathon to raise money in the name of Muscular Dystrophy\n\nThese are a few of the activities of the chapter.\n\nALPHA DELTA\n\nUniversity of Southern Mississippi\n\nThe Twenty-Eighth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe twenty-eighth chapter of Cwens, Alpha Delta, was installed on Sunday, October 25, 1970. This chapter, to be located on the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi at Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was installed during the Feast held at the twenty-third National Witan of the National Society of Cwens at the University of Mississippi. Twenty-two actives, one alumna, and two honorary charter members were initiated.\n\nThe Druids Society, forerunners of Cwens on Southern’s campus, began as a small group of campus leaders wishing to organize a trans-curricular organization of women who had proven outstanding leadership in various significant activities as USM undergraduates. The original organization was composed of sophomore women in various areas of study and extracurricular activities. The first inductees were in 1965.\n\nAt meetings in the spring of 1970, plans were made for petitioning for membership in the National Society of Cwens. The Druids’s officers for 1969-70 and 1970-71, met with Becky DeCoux, president of Iota Cwens at Ole Miss and a transfer to USM, to continue compiling information for the petition. Charter Members:\n\nPaula M. Bounds\n\nRanae Rainey\n\nSusan Courtney\n\nVeda Reed\n\nJudy Craft\n\nGinger Rhinehart\n\nMelinda Cranford\n\nBrenda Schrock\n\nTerrie French\n\nCarol Shelton\n\nTeresa Johnson\n\nMary Shumock\n\nSarah McInnis\n\nJuanita Sims\n\nGayle Morgan\n\nJane Sullivan\n\nMargaret Peters\n\nSarah Tompkins\n\nMartha Piepenbring\n\nMarilyn Ulen\n\nKit Prestridge\n\nNancy Meador\n\nLinda Amacker\n\nCraig B. Skates\n\nSally Hines\n\nWhen the National Society of Cwens voted in March of 1976 to disband and reorganize as Lambda Sigma Society, the Alpha Delta Chapter voted to remain a part of this organization, but decided to wait until the following year to initiate men. The 1976-77 school year proved to be a transition period for our chapter. During this year, all activities and projects were directed to men as well as women. Then, in the spring of 1977, men were initiated into the Alpha Delta Chapter of Lambda Sigma Society. Our first coed initiates included the following:\n\nDonna Jean Britt\n\nJodi Alain Holcomb\n\nSoni Jo Guice Buckalew\n\nHoward Ian Joines\n\nLeta Teresa Callahan\n\nJohn Leslie Keller\n\nElizabeth Anne Campbell\n\nDavid Paul LcCroy\n\nDaryl Robert Coats\n\nDavid Alan O’Shields\n\nCheri Lynn Coon\n\nLisa Gayle Sandifer\n\nCheryl Lynn Coppage\n\nDavid Leon Sonnier\n\nDulcie Bentley Davie\n\nIris Faye Strickland\n\nDonald Blair Driskell\n\nNancy Szalwinski\n\nRussell Alan Eldridge\n\nFrancies Essye Wilson\n\nDeborah Grim\n\nLaurie Lynn Wright\n\nALPHA EPSILON\n\nMansfield State College\n\nThe Twenty-Ninth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe Alpha Epsilon Chapter of the National Society of Cwens originated on the campus of Mansfield State College as SWANNES, a local honorary for sophomore women. In April 1969, inquiries were made by Mrs. Molly Snively, then Assistant Dean of Women at MSC, concerning National Women’s Service Honoraries. Steps were then taken to organize SWANNES after the National Society of Cwens, a National Honorary for sophomore women. Mrs. Helen Lutes, a faculty member, was asked to act as faculty advisor along with Mrs. Snively, an administration advisor. Original members were chosen from recommendations submitted by the Deans of Women and Dormitory Counselors based on scholarship, leadership, service and character. On May 1, 1969, SWANNES was founded with the initiation of the seventeen original members.\n\nIn September, 1970, the second group of SWANNES began proceedings to associate the MSC SWANNES with the National Society of Cwens. Contact was made with the Lambda Chapter from Westminster College in New Wilmington, PA, concerning membership. After much planning and careful preparation, Mansfield State College was initiated as the Alpha Epsilon Chapter on March 14, 1971. Advisors at the time of installation were Mrs. Helen Lutes and Mrs. Esther Roberts. Seventeen active members, ten alumni members and three honorary members were at the first Alpha Epsilon Feast held in the South Dining room of Manser Hall. The Lambda Chapter from Westminster College was in charge of the installation.\n\nAfter weeks of discussion, on October 14, 1976, the sixth group of Cwens voted to become a chapter of the National Society of Lambda Sigma. At that time there were twenty-nine members, three advisors, three junior advisors and Mrs. Lutes served as honorary advisor.\n\nALPHA ZETA\n\nTexas A&M University\n\nThe Thirtieth Chapter of Cwens\n\nThe thirtieth chapter of Cwens, Alpha Zeta, was installed on April 30, 1972, during a ceremony on the campus of Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas. This chapter of Cwens was an outgrowth of an organization called University Women which was organized to facilitate communication on a previously all-male campus; that groups’ officers are among Cwens honorary members.\n\nThe installation of the Alpha Zeta Chapter was made possible largely through University Womens’ efforts and those of Toby Rives, then Dean of Women. The chapter was based on service and academic achievement. When Cwens decided to go coed in the summer of 1976, and accordingly changed its name to Lambda Sigma Society, the Alpha Zeta Chapter voted to remain with the national organization, thus, we were the Alpha Zeta Chapter of Lambda Sigma Society. This organization is also based on service and academic achievement.\n\nDuring its first year, Alpha Zeta, Cwens, established a freshman orientation program to familiarize freshmen with the traditions and spirit of Aggieland. This program, now a tradition at A&M, was presented as usual this year, but by Lambda Sigma. Lambda Sigma will continue to provide the standard services of Cwens: hosting faculty/staff and student functions, operating the elevators to the campus restaurant for all home football games, weekly distributing flyers and posters campus-wide, and helping with blood drives, voter registration, and bonfires. As the first Alpha Zeta Chapter of Lambda Sigma, we incorporated ideas, projects, and programs to make Lambda Sigma a productive coed honor society at Texas A&M University.\n\nTerri Alani\n\nBrenda Kunze\n\nEllen Barrett\n\nKathy Kurcherka\n\nConnie Beard\n\nKathy Lindquist\n\nColores Bell\n\nAva Lingenfelder\n\nDebi Blackmon\n\nJane Logan\n\nSherry Bradshaw\n\nHelen Martin\n\nBrenda Brannen\n\nMelissa Martin\n\nPatricia Bullock\n\nGayle Mikeska\n\nBrenda Burleson\n\nMerrill Mitchell\n\nSusan Carstens\n\nPam Mitchell\n\nLibby Comell\n\nBecky Moore\n\nNancy Cronk\n\nCarol Pearce\n\nKayron Dube\n\nJane Rozsypal\n\nDebbie Esser\n\nJill Saybolt\n\nCynthia Galbreath\n\nStella Stravolemos\n\nBecky Grimes\n\nPatti Whatley\n\nLucy Haydon\n\nPat Wilkinson\n\nKathy Keng\n\nJanet Willmann\n\nCheryl Klos\n\nRoberta Dix\n\nNancy Ondrovik\n\nAnne Marie Elmquist\n\nToby Rives\n\nNancy Evans\n\nTish Self\n\nMary Jo Hoffman\n\nKaren Dawn Switzer\n\nConnie Karcher\n\nKendra (Ward) Williams\n\nJulia McCall\n\nMargaret Williams\n\nJudy McConnell\n\nALPHA ETA\n\nBehrend College\n\nThe Thirty-First Chapter of Cwens\n\nA satellite chapter of the Delta Chapter of Cwens was founded at the Behrend Campus of Pennsylvania State University in the spring of 1970 under the guidance of Dean Betty L. Seanor. The group was organized by first selecting seven sophomore women as honorary members, who, in turn, chose the first members of the Delta-Behrend Chapter. Initiation for the members of the first chapter took place on May 21, 1970.\n\nThe four years that followed were marked by academic growth of the campus itself and all-around growth of the Cwens Chapter in numbers and strength. In the fall of 1973, the campus was renamed the Behrend College of the Pennsylvania State University in recognition of its enlarged curricula offerings and new official status as a degree-granting college of the university. At the end of that academic year (May, 1974), the official status of the Cwens Chapter was also transformed as the Delta-Behrend Chapter became the Alpha Eta Chapter with full voting rights in the National Society. The Epsilon Chapter from Allegheny College, together with Executive Secretary Kathryn A. Koblentz, initiated the following as charter members of the Alpha Eta Chapter:\n\nRachel Battles\n\nJennifer McAlevy\n\nPamela Berry\n\nGina Myers\n\nShari Bronsky\n\nSylvia Polasky\n\nVirginia Brown\n\nSusan Ricke\n\nAngela Detlev\n\nHeidi Rutz\n\nMary Beth Finke\n\nDiane Saalberg\n\nAnnette Fox\n\nCynthia Salak\n\nBarbara Frank\n\nKaren Smogorzewski\n\nJoni Grauso\n\nJane Truskey\n\nLynne Hamlin\n\nJan Turkovich\n\nBarbara Jones\n\nPat Wahrenberger\n\nSandra Malone\n\nDeborah Wickwire\n\nNorene Massey\n\nBarbara Baily\n\nEileen Miller\n\nLoretta Cardinale\n\nBarbara Myers\n\nBronwen Gamble\n\nSarah Patton\n\nTrish Jagodzindski\n\nLynne Phillips\n\nJanice Kilburn\n\nAdvisor: Cathy Sargent Mester\n\nALPHA THETA\n\nSlippery Rock University\n\nThe Thirty-Second Chapter of CWENS\n\nIn the spring of 1966-67, the Dean of Women at (then) Slippery Rock State College, Ellen H. Perrin, contacted freshman women who were active as leaders in campus organizations and formed the Sophomore Women’s Honorary. The honorary was established in order to recognize outstanding women students with the ultimate goal of affiliation with the national society of Cwens. The qualities of scholarship, leadership, and service were emphasized. To be eligible for membership, students had to be full-time, must have earned between 28 and 62 credits, and have maintained a G.P.A. of at least 3.0. Faculty recommendations were also considered in making the final decision regarding membership.\n\nOn November 17, 1974, their goal was finally realized when 21 active, 4 alumna, and 2 honorary charter members of the Sophomore Women’s Honorary were initiated as members of Cwens. Slippery Rock became the Alpha Theta Chapter when they were initiated by the Lambda Chapter at Westminster College with Miss Lorraine R. Sibbet, Lambda Chapter Adviser, and Mrs. Kathryn Koblentz, National Executive Secretary, in attendance at the installation feast. Dean Ellen Perrin and Dr. Joan Egan were the advisers of the charter Cwens chapter. Charter active members were.\n\nJoni Bartell\n\nKathy Rattelsdorfer\n\nAndrea Betovich (Secretary)\n\n(Treasurer) Debbie Read\n\nJodi Brylinsky\n\nNancy Rocco\n\nJackie Davis\n\nJanet Rock (Vice President)\n\nSue Simpson\n\nKerry Erwin\n\nMarisue Stephenson\n\nSue Everden\n\nKaren Sutphin\n\nJane Innerst\n\nDarla Uram\n\nMary Ellen Jencka (President)\n\nPeggy Jeran\n\nDebi Yates\n\nDianne Kerr\n\nKris Zilavy\n\nCarol Larson\n\nThe four alumna members, who were the leaders of the 1973-74 group which really worked toward acceptance into Cwens, were Phyllis Wettig, Sheryl Rees, Maria DeMarino, and Jackie Grimmer. On March 6, 1976, along with all other Cwens chapters, the Alpha Theta Chapter became an official member of the Lambda Sigma Society.\n\nALPHA IOTA\n\nMississippi State University\n\nThe Thirty-Third Chapter\n\nIn the spring of 1978, Ms. Barbara Blankenship and Candy Williamson received permission from the Office of Student Life and Services to form a sophomore honorary on the campus of Mississippi State University. The name of the organization was Chimes and its purpose was to promote leadership, scholarship, and service among freshmen; to provide an opportunity for sophomores to serve; and to promote the advancement of the status of women.\n\nTo be eligible for membership, a candidate was required to have completed at least 12 hours the previous semester and be taking 12 hours during the semester being considered for membership. The candidate also had to be a second semester freshmen or a first semester sophomore with a 3.00 to be considered. Following is a list of charter members of the Chimes organization:\n\nMary Jene Addkison\n\nSusan Kroger\n\nMargaret Arnold\n\nGina Lackey\n\nNancy Bennett\n\nGwen McDill\n\nNancy Biglane (Secretary/Treasurer)\n\nElizabeth Bost\n\nAdrienne Pakis\n\nVicki Crowder (President)\n\nDonna Fava\n\nKathy Pyatt\n\nJanet Green\n\nRebecca Rose\n\nDebbie Hardin\n\nSusan Rouse\n\nKate Howell\n\nCathy Thomas (Vice President)\n\nMary Virden\n\nJana Jarnagan\n\nThe Chimes organization petitioned to become a chapter of Lambda Sigma in the late spring of 1978 and in November of that same year the Alpha Iota Chapter of Lambda Sigma was installed at Mississippi State University. The first initiates were the following:\n\nNancy Adams\n\nLynn Hitchings\n\nDonna Barkley\n\nSherry Lee\n\nSuzanne Blalock\n\nLauri Metts\n\nGwen Booth\n\nKim Mobley\n\nTerri Box\n\nMarty Mosley\n\nJulie Burress\n\nCheryl Sidney\n\nSusan Creekmore\n\nLynn Tillery\n\nGay Culpepper\n\nKathy Waltman\n\nRhonda Earnest\n\nJan Watson\n\nALPHA KAPPA\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\nThe Thirty-Fourth Chapter\n\nAlpha Kappa was installed by Pi Chapter, Auburn University at the Georgia Institute of Technology on Friday, January 19, 1979. This was a result of one year’s work with a core group of students who had shown an interest in establishing a chapter on the campus.\n\nIn February of 1978, Jane Price Harmon, National President, visited the campus to talk with Sally Hammock, organizations advisor, to investigate the possibility of placing the first chapter in Georgia at Tech. Frequent meetings were held with the students, Dr. Sarah Jackson and Dr. James Young of the English Department, and the selection process was completed in November of 1978.\n\nThe group began building its treasury by doughnut sales, and initiated its first service project at Roosevelt House, a high rise elderly apartment building, with a Casino party and movies. The program expanded when the chapter became the official hosts and hostesses of the campus and when it produced a chapter newsletter.\n\nALPHA LAMBDA\n\nD’Youville College\n\nThirty-Fifth Chapter\n\nThe Alpha Lambda Chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society was established at D’Youville College in 1981. The first group of 19 freshmen were tapped on Wednesday, March 11, 1981. Installation by the Lambda Chapter of Westminster College took place on Sunday, April 5. The first initiates were:\n\nChristine Barr\n\nEileen Grinnell\n\nCarrie A. Bisanty\n\nKenneth Kavanaugh\n\nDiane M. Boloz\n\nJulianne E. Kiz\n\nGerald Boyce\n\nCanio Marasco, Jr.\n\nAnthony Cannuli\n\nCynthia J. Palenski\n\nCynthia Childs\n\nMary Louise Ray\n\nFrances J. D’Amico\n\nDenise M. Rutkowski\n\nJeffrey Dygulski\n\nKenneth Stanton\n\nEvelyn Gawronski\n\nJudy A. Zemrak\n\nKaren L. Graczyk\n\nSince 1981, Alpha Lambda Chapter has contributed much to the college and community through fund-raisers and service projects. These activities have included helping the freshmen move into the dorms, ushering at Honors Convocation, Baccalaureate and Commencement, assisting alumni with the annual phon-a-thon, hosting Halloween and Christmas parties for the local children and nursing home residents, blood mobiles, and organizing the annual week-long Moving Up Days activities. Members have also raised money through bake sales, on-campus birthday cake sales, blind auctions, fish frys, and sales of First Aid Kits. Overall, this organization is a highly motivated group of individuals who truly exhibit scholarship, leadership, fellowship and service at D’Youville College.\n\nALPHA MU\n\nBerry College\n\nThe Thirty-Sixth Chapter\n\nIn May of 1980, Dean of Students, Thomas Carver, and Barbara Morgan called a meeting of selected freshmen interested in forming a new club. This club was organized for the purpose of becoming a new chapter of Lambda Sigma Honor Society. The group was enthusiastic about the idea and decided to go “full speed ahead”. Jane Price Harmon, National President, was contacted and met with Dean Carver on several occasions to formulate plans for installation.\n\nThe club was formed under the official name of Berry Leadership and Scholarship Sophomore Honor Society. Officers were elected and work began as the students initiated many projects with an emphasis on service to the Berry community. The activities included helping at Freshman Orientation, writing and performing singing telegrams for all occasions, performing a valet parking service for the annual Founder’s Day Dinner, sending representatives to the regional convention at Texas A&M, serving as score keepers and timers at a Scholar’s Bowl, and helping with the first annual Viking Classic Road Race.\n\nThe group was initiated in the spring of 1981 by the Alpha Kappa Chapter of Georgia Tech.\n\nALPHA NU\n\nButler University\n\nThe Thirty-Seventh Chapter\n\nSophomore honorary-service organizations were an integral part of Butler University for over 62 years. The first such organization, Torch, was founded in 1920. Torch was made up of sophomore women whose purpose was to promote democratic ideals and to bring about solidity among upper class women. One of their activities was arranging social affairs for freshmen.\n\nIn 1921, another similar organization was formed. Scarf was the name of the group made up of freshman women. Scarf’s purpose was to promote good fellowship and cultural pursuits and to bring about increased student body support of campus activities. Some of its activities included hosting a party for the freshmen women and collecting food and toys for needy families during the holidays.\n\nIn the fall of 1932, Scarf and Torch combined to make one group. The reasoning behind this was that Scarf members were not active until their sophomore year, which caused overlapping with membership in Torch. The group decided to petition to a national sophomore honorary, and disbanded after the 1932-33 school year to form Spurs.\n\nThe Butler Chapter of Spurs was installed on May 5, 1933, and was the fifteenth Spurs Chapter and the only one east of the Rocky mountains. The first project that the new group undertook was a food sale that made them $16. “Kid Kapers,” an informal dance and party where students came dressed in children’s clothes became a traditional event sponsored by Spurs at Butler. Perhaps the most successful Spurs activity was the caramel apple sale to the fraternity and sorority houses every Wednesday at noon. From this alone, Spurs made enough money to finance all its social activities for the year. In 1934, the Butler Chapter won the national trophy for the best chapter record in the nation for that year. This trophy was based on accomplishments in campus activities, scholarship, and service to the university.\n\nThe next major change in Spurs came in the fall of 1976 when men were allowed to join the organization for the first time. Some of Spurs activities included assisting the university and the new freshmen during orientation week, selling mums at homecoming, and May Day carnations to benefit a local senior citizen’s center.\n\nIn the spring of 1982, Spurs decided it was time again to change to a new organization. Spurs national was not contributing to the local chapter of Spurs so Spurs decided to disaffiliate and look for a new organization. Many alternatives were investigated and it was decided that the national Lambda Sigma Society would be the best choice. After petitioning, the society of Butler University sophomore organization was accepted and installed November 13, 1982.\n\nThe Butler University sophomore honorary-service group has had a strong impression on campus for many years. Despite changes in society, the group has survived. It has survived through tough economic times, a World War, and an upheaval of societal values.\n\nNote: Alpha Nu is now inactive.\n\nALPHA XI\n\nTexas Tech University\n\nThe Thirty-Eighth Chapter\n\nIn the fall of 1982, a coordinating council of representatives from six college honoraries, Alpha Lambda Delta, Junior Council, Mortar Board, Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Eta Sigma, and Phi Kappa Phi formed with the Dean of Students’ encouragement, to plan a spring recognition program and to organize a sophomore honorary. The council agreed that the members of the honorary would be chosen on their achievements of scholarship, leadership, and service activities from high school and college involvement. The objective of the honorary would be to foster leadership, scholarship, fellowship, and the spirit of service among college students. Students were required to have completed a minimum of 12 graded hours, be in their first year of college residence and have earned a cumulative 3.25 grade point average on a 4 point system.\n\nFrom approximately ninety applications submitted in the spring of 1983, fifty finalists were interviewed by the honor society and thirty-six members were chosen. An orientation and workshop for these new members was conducted and officers elected in May 1983. A summer newsletter was mailed, and the group organized to begin its year of activities.\n\nNote: Alpha Xi is now inactive.\n\nALPHA OMICRON\n\nBeaver College of Penn State\n\nThe Thirty-Nineth Chapter\n\nOn October 2, 1982, Dr. David Wood and Dr. Robert DeWitt were interviewed by Lambda Sigma National Executive Board at the national conference. Later on November 10 Dr. Wood and Dr. DeWitt met with the first prospective group of Lambda Sigma and a petition for membership sent to Barbara Ross, National Board Vice President.\n\nOn January 25, 1983, the Student Government Association recognized Lambda Sigma as the Alpha Omicron Chapter and the first Lambda Sigma Chapter members were later inducted by Duquesne University. The officers were Delrine Jackson, Frederick Picci, Lisa Ungor and Christine Alberts.\n\nNote: Alpha Omicron is now inactive.\n\nALPHA PI\n\nLawrence University\n\nThe Fortieth Chapter\n\nAlpha Pi began as an effort to recognize and retain sophomore students at Lawrence University. Christine Frantz, Assistant Dean of Students, who had been a former Cwens member, felt that the strong, competitive academic atmosphere at Lawrence left little room for nurturing or positive reinforcement. Consequently, with the assistance of a very supportive dean and Denise Rode from NIU, Lambda Sigma began at Lawrence University.\n\nAfter a visit from Denise Rode, the chapter was installed on November 25, 1984, by the Omicron Chapter. Charter members included:\n\nRich Agness (Dean of Campus Life)\n\nPeter Marsh\n\nDavid Mitchell\n\nSusan Beckwith\n\nMelissa Pahel\n\nElizabeth Brown\n\nLinda Paul\n\nRose Brzezinski\n\nSusan Peterson\n\nBeth Campbell\n\nStephen Purdum\n\nThayre Faust\n\nSteve Reich\n\nDeborah Goldman\n\nOmar Sayeed\n\nScott Halloin\n\nGreta Schewe\n\nKaren Hamilton\n\nLisa Shirah\n\nKaren Hoffmann\n\nLisa Toussaint\n\nJeffrey Jolton\n\nAngela Wagoner\n\nPeter Kelly\n\nRik Warch (Lawrence’s President)\n\nLisette Kielson\n\nAron Livingston\n\nJanine Yanisch\n\nActivities for the first academic year included establishing a link with the admissions office through tours, hosting, fund drives, etc., establishing a support network (for tutoring, counseling, and assisting freshmen), and recruiting new members in spring. Lawrence’s chapter also attended the Lambda Sigma Society Regional Conference in Chicago, November 9-11.\n\nThe group’s leaders seemed very enthusiastic about Lambda Sigma. President Thayre Faust: “I’m excited about being involved in the development of a sophomore honor society. A group of this type can contribute much to the university in terms of activities and over-all spirit. The members are very positive and energetic about establishing Lambda Sigma as the first chapter in the state of Wisconsin. The response from the administration and the faculty has been most encouraging and most helpful.”\n\nALPHA RHO\n\nRobert Morris College\n\nThe Forty-First Chapter\n\nThe forty-first chapter of the Lambda Sigma Society was installed at Robert Morris College January 18, 1987 at an installation ceremony. A welcome was extended by the President of the College, Charles L. Sewall. The guest speaker was Dr. Robert C. Dewitt, National Vice President of Lambda Sigma Society.

Marco, Assistant Professor of Marketing/Management.\n\nNote: Alpha Rho is now inactive.\n\nALPHA SIGMA\n\nGannon University\n\nThe Forty-Second Chapter\n\nLambda Sigma, Gannon’s first University-wide national honor society, was chartered January 31, 1987, with the installation of 31 students and five honorary members. Efforts to establish an organization such as Lambda Sigma were initiated by James Fitzpatrick, Director of Student Development. Mr. Fitzpatrick discovered, upon his arrival in August of 1986, that no university-wide national honor societies existed at Gannon, and he began working toward the installation of an organization. According to Fitzpatrick, the founding of the Lambda Sigma chapter at Gannon was facilitated by his knowledge of the group and his contacts with their board of directors.\n\nMr. Fitzpatrick said that he expected that chapters of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior societies would be established at Gannon by the end of the school year (1987). Indeed, his prediction was correct. In November, a meeting was held for those sophomores meeting the leadership and service requirements. At this meeting, details of the national organization were explained to potential members.\n\nOf the 46 sophomores attending the meeting, 31 accepted positions and paid dues by the end of the semester. The installation and founding ceremony also included the induction of honorary members Gannon President, Dr. Joseph Scottino; Vice President of Academic Services, Dr. Robert Wall; Vice President of Student Services, Richard Dunford; Assistant Registrar, Timothy W. Pilewski; and Director of Student Development, James Fitzpatrick. Dr. Robert DeWitt, National Vice President, was also in attendance as presiding officer at the installation ceremony and presented the chapter President Margaret Rothgery with the charter officially proclaiming the Alpha Sigma Chapter of Lambda Sigma at Gannon University.\n\nAlpha Sigma Chapter members have participated in many events throughout the years. Some of the activities members have been involved in, include participating in the annual Dance Marathon to benefit the MDA foundation, serving as Host and Hostesses for the annual Parent-Weekend, offering volunteer tutorial services at the JFK Center, volunteering for Freshmen Orientation, participating in the annual Phone- A-Thon to raise money for the University, and having a Halloween party for underprivileged children. The Alpha Sigma Chapter plans to continue its success in the future and to continue reaching the goals of the Lambda Sigma Society.\n\nALPHA TAU\n\nThe University of Alabama\n\nThe Forty-Third Chapter\n\nIn the Spring of 1988, the Alpha Tau Chapter of Lambda Sigma was installed on the campus at the University of Alabama. Auburn students from Pi Chapter and Joe Kicklighter, the Pi Adviser and national vice president conducted the installation ceremony at a banquet. The University of Alabama president, Dr. Roger Soyers and Dr. Ed Whipple, director of student life, attended the festive occasion.\n\nFifty students were initiated as charter members along with the adviser, Jeffery Munroe who serves as assistant director of student life, and Dr. Jay Black, a faculty member.\n\nThe chartered members include the following:\n\nDee Anderson Amy Renee Jones\n\nDaniel E.

Mount Saint Clare College was initially a junior college, when the college became a four year institution, our goal was to be recognized by an honor society in keeping with the nature of this institution.\n\nDr. Fred Medinger, the Academic Dean, received permission from the President of the college to apply for membership with Lambda Sigma Society. Dr. Joseph Kicklighter encouraged us to proceed with our petition, and advised us to the steps for desired membership.\n\nThen, Dr. Medinger contacted those students who had achieved a 3.00 GPA and had been active as leaders in campus and civic organizations. In October 1991, eight charter members were initiated in the Alpha Upsilon Chapter.
