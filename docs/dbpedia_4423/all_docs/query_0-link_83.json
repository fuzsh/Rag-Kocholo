Mishoe, President of DSC at the time and also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.\n\nIt is located in the Eastern Region of Alpha Phi Alpha where in recent years, have been awarded Regional Chapter of the Year while also becoming known as one of the premiere chapters known for national and regional step show teams. The brothers are also committed to community organizing and service from New York to Maryland annually.\n\nSince its founding on December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African Americans and people of color around the world. https://apa1906.net\n\nAdvisor: Mr. Raquan Rose, rrose [at] desu.edu\n\nInstagram: @gsalphas\n\nEmail: www.gammasigma09 [at] gmail.com\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\n\nThe purpose of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated is to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards, to promote unity and friendship amongst college women, to study and help alleviate problems concerning girls and women in order to improve their social stature, to maintain a progressive interest in college life and to be of service to all mankind.\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated had its humble beginnings as the vision of nine college students on the campus of Howard University in 1908. Since then, the sorority has flourished into a globally-impactful organization of nearly 300,000 college-trained members, bound by the bonds of sisterhood and empowered by a commitment to servant-leadership that is both domestic and international in its scope.\n\nCharted in April 1955, as the first undergraduate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. in the state of Delaware, Delta Lambda chapter is located on the campus of Delaware State (College) University (DSU). At the time of its chartering, Lillian R. Sockum was the President of Epsilon Iota Omega chapter, the supervising chapter for Delta Lambda chapter, Marjorie H. Parker was the North Atlantic Regional Director and Dr. Jerome Holland was the President of DSU.\n\nAs Alpha Kappa Alpha has grown, it has maintained its focus in two key arenas: the lifelong personal and professional development of each of its members; and galvanizing its membership into an organization of respected power and influence, consistently at the forefront of effective advocacy and social change that results in equality and equity for all citizens of the world. https://aka1908.com\n\nAdvisor: Mrs. Candace Moore, cmoore [at] desu.edu\n\nInstagram: @deltalambda_1955\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nOmega was founded November 17, 1911 on the campus of Howard University by founders: Ernest E. Just, Edgar A. Love, Oscar J. Cooper and Frank Coleman.\n\nChartered as first Greek organization on the campus of then Delaware State College; Psi Epsilon chapter was chartered on December 17, 1946 in Delaware Hall. It was organized with fourteen charter members: Henry “Clay Aldridge, John E. Cottman, James Curtis, William M. Freeman, Clifton Harman, James Harris, Nathaniel Johnson, Felmon D. Motley, Malachi A. Raisin, Hampton M. Turner, Jarriet W. Warner, Taylor S. Wheeler, Harry B. Williams, and Morris Wilson\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. continues to flourish, largely because the founders were men of the highest ideals and intellect and selected/attracted men of similar ideals and characteristics. The organization’s motto is “friendship is essential to the soul”. https://oppf.org\n\nAdvisor: Mr. Michael Rogers, mrogers [at] desu.edu\n\nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\nDelta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is a private, non-profit organization whose purpose is to provide assistance and support through established programs in local communities throughout the world. A sisterhood of more than 200,000 predominately Black college educated women, the Sorority currently has over 900 chapters located in the United States, England, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, the Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Republic of Korea. The major programs of the sorority are based upon the organization’s Five Point Programmatic Thrust:\n\nThe Sorority was founded in 1913 by 22 students at Howard University. These young women wanted to use their collective strength to promote academic excellence; to provide scholarships; to provide support to the underserved; educate and stimulate participation in the establishment of positive public policy; and to highlight issues and provide solutions for problems in their communities.\n\nThe Epsilon Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated was chartered in 1958 at Delaware State College. Under the sponsorship of Dover Alumnae Chapter with Maye Grant as undergraduate advisor, our chartering members decided that there needed to be a chapter at Delaware State College. These illustrious women believed that their campus could benefit from the ideals and principles of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated. https://www.deltasigmatheta.org\n\nAdvisor: Mrs. Jane Hicks, jhicks [at] desu.edu\n\nInstagram: @ea_deltas\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders, Honorable A. Langston Taylor, Honorable Leonard F. Morse, and Honorable Charles I. Brown, wanted to organize a Greek letter fraternity that would truly exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, scholarship, and service.\n\nGamma Upsilon chapter was chartered April 17th 1962 at Delaware State College by 5 men who exemplified the ideals of Brotherhood, Scholarship, and Service. And since its charter many decades ago, Gamma Upsilon has proven it’s rightfully apart of the “People’s Fraternity” who sought “Culture for Service, Service for Humanity”.\n\nToday, Phi Beta Sigma has blossomed into an international organization of leaders. No longer a single entity, members of the Fraternity have been instrumental in the establishment of the Phi Beta Sigma National Foundation, the Phi Beta Sigma Federal Credit Union and The Sigma Beta Club Foundation. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, founded in 1920 with the assistance of Phi Beta Sigma, is the sister organization of the Fraternity. https://phibetasigma1914.org\n\nAdvisor: Mr. Khalil Brown, kebrown [at] desu.edu\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. was founded January 16, 1920, at Howard University, Washington, D.C. It was within this environment that five coeds envisioned a sorority which would directly affect positive change, chart a course of action for the 1920s and beyond, raise consciousness of their people, encourage the highest standards of scholastic achievement, and foster a greater sense of unity among its members. These women believed that sorority elitism and socializing overshadowed the real mission for progressive organizations and failed to address fully the societal mores, ills, prejudices, and poverty affecting humanity in general and the black community in particular.\n\nOn September 30, 1961, the Upsilon chapter was chartered here on the campus of Delaware State College. Sedalia Gaines, Doris R. Newby, Geneva Vaughn, Joyce George, Jay Waters, Cynthia Moody, and Jeanette Palmer were women who had high standards and principles, and a good scholarly average.\n\nZeta‘s national and local programs include the endowment of its National Educational Foundation community outreach services and support of multiple affiliate organizations. Zeta chapters and auxiliaries have given untotaled hours of voluntary service to educate the public, assist youth, provide scholarships, support organized charities, and promote legislation for social and civic change. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is poised for perpetual service to mankind into her second century and beyond. https://zphib1920.org\n\nAdvisor: Mrs. Latasha Daniels, ldaniels [at] desu.edu\n\nInstagram: @upsilonzetas\n\nEmail: zphib.upsilon [at] gmail.com\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.\n\nOur organization was founded on November 12, 1922 on the campus of Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. is the only National Pan Hellenic Council (NPHC) sorority to be founded on a non-Historically Black College/University (HBCU); making us quite unique!\n\nThe Zeta Delta Chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Incorporated was founded on March 30, 1974 on the campus of Delaware State College, which is now known as Delaware State University. Six lovely ladies chartered this extravagant chapter: Carlene Jackson, Mary Piper Omega Rho, B. Pat Roberts Olivia Morris, Lizzy Townsend Omega Rho, and Rosemarry Harris Williams.\n\nSigma Gamma Rho Sorority’s aim is to enhance the quality of life within the community.

Based upon their ages, heightened responsibilities, and increased level of maturity, this group had a slightly different perspective than the norm for college students. It was this perspective from which they established the Fraternity’s purpose, “The development and perpetuation of Scholarship, Leadership, Citizenship, Fidelity, and Brotherhood among Men.” Additionally, they conceived the Fraternity’s motto, “Building a Tradition, Not Resting Upon One!”\n\nThe Gamma Chapter was founded at Delaware State College now known as Delaware State University in the year 1967. This chapter is very historic and continues to bring tradition to the Fraternity and make quality men.\n\nToday, Iota Phi Theta® consists of over 250 chapters located in 40 States, the District of Columbia and the Republic of Korea. The scope of the organization extends throughout the nation, from California to New York; from Wyoming to Florida; and from Wisconsin to The Bahamas Islands. https://www.iotaphitheta.org\n\nAdvisor: Mr. Anthony Pierce, apierce0411 [at] gmail.com\n\nAlpha Nu Omega Fraternity, Inc.\n\nAlpha Nu Omega Fraternity, Incorporated is a national Christian fraternity founded at Morgan State University in 1988.

Sinfonia was born on October 6, 1898, at the New England Conservatory in Boston, when a group of thirteen young men under the guidance of Ossian Everett Mills met “to consider the social life of the young men students of that institution [and] to devise ways and means by which it might be improved.” Sinfonia became a national fraternity on October 6, 1900, with the admission of a group of men at the Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia. For over a century, Sinfonians in nearly every field of study and professional endeavor have transformed music in America. The opportunity of becoming a Sinfonian is offered to as many men as possible who, through a love for music, can assist in the fulfillment of the Fraternity’s Object and ideals either by adopting music as a profession or by working to advance the cause of music in America. https://www.sinfonia.org\n\nAdvisor: Mr. Marty Denson, mdenson [at] desu.edu\n\nGroove Phi Groove Social Fellowship, Inc.\n\nGroove Phi Groove Social Fellowship, Inc. was founded at Morgan State College (now Morgan State University) on October 12, 1962 by fourteen daring, young, black American men who wanted to change the way we think about brotherhood.\n\nOur founders established the Fellowship with the purposes of promoting academic awareness, ethical standards, and unity among men in undergraduate and graduate college programs; creating intelligent and effective leadership; and studying and helping to alleviate the social and economic problems of society to generally improve the world.\n\nLittle did our founders know in 1962 that the fruits of their efforts at Morgan State College would evolve into a thriving movement that continues to play an important role in developing and nurturing what we know as Black America.\n\nThe Fellowship currently has thousands of members and dozens of graduate and undergraduate chapters across the United States.
