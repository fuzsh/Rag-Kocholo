        "text": "The Iota Delta Chapter of Alpha Delta Pi was installed at the University of the South in April 2017. Our members came home to Alpha Delta Pi at Sewanee because they were looking for a place that provided them with fun, support, leadership opportunities, and an organization that made them a part of something bigger than themselves.\n\nFounded in the spring of 1979, Alpha Delta Theta (“ADT”) is one of the most diverse and active organizations at the University of the South. Founded on the basis of service to both the University and the community, the sorority strives to realize these goals as extensively as possible while encouraging each sister to excel academically, spiritually, and socially in her four years at Sewanee.\n\nAlpha Tau Zeta was founded in 1987 by a small group of women who felt like there was not yet a Greek organization on campus that suited their quirkiness, brilliance, and enthusiasm. We are committed to remaining a small organization (under 25 members) in order to encourage strong bonds and utmost loyalty between sisters.\n\nFounded in 2003, the Eta Epsilon Chapter of Kappa Delta is one of two national sororities represented at Sewanee. Our members play an active role on campus by engaging in activities including Residential Life, Varsity Athletics, the Arcadian Program, Inter Sorority Council, Up Till Dawn (St. Jude), Student Outing Program, Orchestra, Choir, Bonner, APO and more.\n\nThe purpose of Kappa Omega sorority is to strengthen the achievements and experiences of its members while at the University of the South by creating an environment that supports the academic efforts and personal interests of all members; by encouraging the cultivation of meaningful and lasting relationships with fellow students; and by enhancing the community at-large through interaction, contribution, and commitment.\n\nIn the fall of 1999, eight females started Phi Sigma Theta to promote diversity on Sewanee's campus as well as serve the community and stand as role models to other young girls. We strive to uphold the standard of being a lady and a member of this great community inside and outside of campus.\n\nTo give women the opportunity to participate in social and community activities, inspire a deep and abiding sense of relationship to the University, the Sewanee community, and each other; and to encourage in each of her sisters a passion for learning, a commitment to personal integrity, and a sense of social responsibility; and to promote true friendship among her sisters, to support and encourage each of them as she works to achieve her greatest potential as a student and as a woman.\n\nChi Psi fraternity at the University of the South was founded in 1964. In 1965, our fraternity house, or Lodge, as it is referred to on campus, was constructed on what is now the shore of Lake Finney, across from the Trezevant Residence Hall on Georgia Avenue.\n\nThe cultivation of general literature and social culture, the advancement and encouragement of intellectual excellence, the promotion of honorable friendship and useful citizenship, the development of a spirit of tolerance and respect for the rights and views of others, the maintenance of gentlemanly dignity, self-respect, and morality in all circumstances, and the union of stout hearts and kindred interests to secure, to merit its due reward.\n\nGamma Sigma Phi was founded at the University of the South in the Fall of 1999 by nine African-American students who sought to make a cultural impact on campus Greek life by \"filling a gap\" and becoming the first historically black fraternity on campus. Their founding charter and creed guides all Gamma men in pursuit of enriching, diversified experiences on the Mountain and beyond. Alumni include clergymen, educators, and veterans of the armed forces, many of whom remain involved with the university and the fraternity. Undergraduate members are represented in several varsity sports, music and academic and social clubs across campus.\n\nThe Phi Society was originally founded in 1883 as part of the national fraternity Phi Delta Theta. In 2005 the chapter broke away from the national fraternity and was re-founded as the Phi Society of 1883.\n\nThe Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of the South is one of the oldest chapters in the country, founded in 1881. The Tennessee Omega house was the first SAE Fraternity house ever built in 1886."
