        "text": "1900–1919:\n\n1905\n\nCosmopolitan Law Club organized at Boston University.\n\n1909\n\nNovember 2—Warren A. Cole (Boston 1912) founded Alpha Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha at Boston University. As an incoming law student at the university, it was Cole’s dream to start a college fraternity from the very beginning. After graduating with a Bachelor of Law degree, Cole set out to build Lambda Chi Alpha into an international fraternity and served as the first Grand High Alpha, or chairman, until December 1919. He also served as the administrative secretary and editor of the Purple, Green, and Gold magazine.\n\n1910\n\nApril 27—The fraternity’s name, Lambda Chi Alpha, is written and recorded for first time in Alpha Zeta minutes and the first Zeta roll, which served as the official membership records for all chapters.\n\nOctober 3—The first version of a ritualistic Initiation is held.\n\n1911\n\nNovember 15—Date of Alpha Zeta Charter.

This historic letter was read to the assembled body and was significant in the adoption of a new initiation ritual for the young fraternity. Today, Dr. John E. Mason is known as the spiritual founder and the chief architect of the Initiation Ritual of Lambda Chi Alpha.\n\n1914\n\nJanuary—No. 1, Vol. I, of the Purple, Green, and Gold magazine appeared.\n\nApril 9—The present Initiation Ritual of Lambda Chi Alpha is adopted by the Third General Assembly in Worcester, MA.\n\n1915\n\nJanuary 2—Vol. I, No. I, of Cross & Crescent handbook appeared.\n\nFebruary—Zeta Zephyr is the first chapter publication, published by Zeta Zeta at Penn State.\n\n1917\n\nTwenty-five hundred Lambda Chis (90 percent of membership) in war service.

Cole resigned from Lambda Chi Alpha shortly after the meeting.\n\n1920–1939:\n\n1920\n\nFebruary 12—Bruce McIntosh (DePauw 1916) is appointed the first full-time administrative secretary of Lambda Chi Alpha, known today as the chief executive officer, and was operating the central office out of Fischer’s home in Kingston, Pennsylvania.

This union increased the chapter roll from 77 to 111 and membership from 20,000 to 27,500, becoming the largest merger in the fraternity world. TKN’s heritage was honored in this united fraternity by adding the Latin open motto Vir Quisque Vir, meaning “Every man a man”, and other additions to the fraternity’s coat of arms; the white tudor rose becoming the fraternity’s official flower; a new pledge pin design and ceremony (a condensed version of TKN’s ritual).\n\n1940–1959:\n\n1940\n\nMarch 1—The General Fraternity purchases it’s first Office of Administration building, a remodeled home at 2029 N.

Mason Memorial Foundation (now Lambda Chi Alpha Educational Foundation, Inc.) is created from his bequest upon his death on May 29th. While Mason’s name is closely associated with ritualism of Lambda Chi Alpha, he also contributed extensively in many areas, such as assisting in the development of the first edition of The Pedagogues and songbook, as well as serving many years as the Fraternity’s historian and member of the Grand High Zeta, including Grand High Alpha from 1930-1933.\n\n1949\n\nAugust 22—The first Management Training Seminar (now Stead Leadership Seminar) is held at Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n1953\n\nThe Annual Fund campaign is established as a means for alumni to financially support the Fraternity beyond their college days.\n\nAugust 31—The position of chapter services secretary (now director of chapter services) is created.

The first members are inducted into the Order of Achievement and Order of Inter-fraternity Service. The Order of Achievement is presented to those brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha who have distinguished themselves by outstanding accomplishment in their chosen field and serve as a role model through their success and have thereby brought honor and respect to the Fraternity. The Order of Inter-fraternity Service was created to recognize those men and women who have contributed outstanding service in the betterment of all college fraternal organizations.\n\n1961\n\nUpsilon Zeta at Louisiana State becomes the first chapter to initiate 1,000 members.\n\n1967\n\nDan Dullaghan (Butler 1970) is initiated as Lambda Chi Alpha’s 100,000th member, the fifth fraternity to do so.\n\n1968\n\nAfter Duke Flad’s death, George W.

A Resolution is adopted by the 32nd General Assembly that condemns all forms of discrimination in all chapters. Fred W. Suggs, Jr. (Kansas State 1971), who later served as Grand High Alpha from 1994-1998, is the first recipient of the Cyril F. “Duke” Flad Outstanding Undergraduate award.

The term “associate member” replaces the term “pledge” when referring to a new member. Associate membership allows new members voting rights in chapter matters and the ability to run for officer positions, unlike other fraternities at the time. Lambda Chi Alpha is the first fraternity to abolish pledging to promote an anti-hazing culture in its chapters.\n\n1973\n\nAugust—The first Grand High Alpha Awards and Phoenix Awards are presented. The Grand High Alpha award recognizes chapters that have maintained a superior level of operations for at least three consecutive years. A chapter is not eligible to receive the Grand High Alpha again until three years have elapsed since previously winning the award.
