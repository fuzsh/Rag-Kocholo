        "text": "Membership Intake is a chapter specific process that members of the National Pan-Hellenic Council and members of the Multicultural Greek Council hold to gain new members.\n\nThis page has been compiled to educate students on the membership intake process at William & Mary and the chapter who conduct this process. The information below has been provided by the chapters who conduct a membership intake process.\n\nNone of our chapters on campus at this time accept first term freshman.\n\nDo you accept First term freshmen?\n\nAccepts First Term Freshmen\n\nDoes not accept first term freshmen\n\nnone at this time\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.\n\nHermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha, Inc.\n\nKappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.\n\nEach chapter does have a GPA, enrollment status, and may have a completed hour requirement for membership.\n\nGPA & Hour requirements to join Chapter GPA Enrollment Status Hours Complete Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. 2.3 Full Time 12 Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. 2.5 Full Time 12 Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha, Inc. 2.5 Full-Time 12-18 Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. 2.5 Full Time 12 Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. 2.5 Full Time 36 Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. 2.5 Full Time 12\n\nThe following chapters host a “Rush Week/Day” similar to IFC and Panhellenic chapters, where prospective members can learn more about the chapters to determine if they would like to pursue membership at the end of “Rush Week/Day.”\n\nWhen do chapters conduct intake?

Determined Each Year\n\nIf you are a first semester freshman and interested in joining an NPHC or MCG organization, but the organization does not host a “Rush Week/Day” or accept first semester freshman, there are still important steps to take.\n\n1. Earn the grades! It is important you have solid academic success at W&M.\n\n2. Get to know the members & the organizations! Whether you are extremely familiar with fraternities and sororities, or know nothing at all, it is important you get to know the members and organizations AND for the members to get to know you. Use the semester to attend chapter events and interest meeting to determine what the best fit is for you. You can learn about events and meetings through social media, Student Happenings, events calendars, and flyers across campus. Just remember to be yourself.\n\n3. Learn more! Take some time to read various blogs, articles, and books. Below are a few suggestions:\n\n** Ross, L. (2000). The Divine Nine: The History of African-American Fraternities and Sororities. New York: Kensington Books.\n\n** Kimbrough, W. M. (2003). Black Greek 101: The Culture, Customs, and Challenges of Black Fraternities and Sororities. Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickenson University Press.\n\n** Torbenson, C. L., & Parks, G. (2009). Brothers and Sisters: Diversity in College Fraternities & Sororities. Associated University Press.\n\n4. Service hours! Giving back to the community is an important facet to the culturally based organizations. Chapters volunteer weekly, monthly, and annually in the Williamsburg/Hampton Roads community. You can connect with other student volunteer organizations or the Office of Community Engagement for opportunities.\n\n5. Recommendations! Many chapters require letters of recommendation for membership. The recommendation letters can come from mentors, employers, professors, as well as members from the organization. Be sure to remain in contact with people you know and develop key relationships with faculty and staff on campus.\n\n6. Involvement and leadership! Another requirement, by some chapters, is your current involvement on campus or in the community. Find an organization to join and be an active member by serving on a committee or in a leadership role.\n\n7. Save up! All organizations require a new member fee. Depending on the organization, the fee can range from $250- $2500. Begin saving money now so you are ready when the time comes. If you don’t join, at least you saved the money!\n\n8. These organizations will notify interested students of their membership intake timelines when that information is available for distribution. Be patient. Take your time. Enjoy the journey.\n\nEmail [[adgerling, Alexa Gerling]], Assistant Director of Student Leadership Development with questions about the intake process."
