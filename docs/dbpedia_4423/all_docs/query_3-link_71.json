Te Shie & Dio spoke with Brother Peterson about the meaning behind the last two years as international president. S&D: Chris, you are the 54th man to assume the oce of international president. A top priority for you during your term has been growth. Why should Pi Kappa Alpha prioritize growth now more than ever? Growth should always be a priority for us, but there are some factors that do make now a unique time. The decline of the number of young men entering college now and through the next several years has created a major threat for fraternities but has also presented a great opportunity. The threat is obvious â as the number of men in college decreases, the number of those joining fraternities will naturally decrease. The opportunities â like many opportunities in life â arenât obvious. The rst opportunity that we have is to provide unique value to our members that they may not receive from\n\nThe Man Behind the Movement A Conversation with the 54th International President of Pi Kappa Alpha Chris Peterson (Florida, Alpha Eta â91).\n\n10\n\nSHIELD & DIAMOND\n\nWWW.PIKES.ORG\n\ntheir host institutions. As colleges and universities shrink in enrollment, many will decrease the resources that theyâre able to provide their students. Programs such as professional development, mental health support, and career guidance will decrease. This void can be filled by Pi Kappa Alpha â and it will be filled with programs specifically designed for Pikes. Another opportunity is the pressure to change our approach and become better recruiters. Weâve already started this journey of building a playbook for Pikes to recruit and win rush in the changing environment of the next 10â20 years. The amazing results of the last 18 months make it clear that our efforts are working. S&D: Clearly Fraternity leadership cares about growing the organization. Why should each individual member care about growth? No matter what career a Pike chooses, they will need to grow. Whether theyâre a concert pianist, an attorney, or a sales professional, growth is necessary for their success. Implementing a strategy, introducing yourself to strangers, and asking them to be Pikes â knowing that they might reject you â are all skills that will benefit our members for the rest of their lives. No better time to learn these skills than now. S&D: Speaking of growth and recruitment: What is your âWhy PIKEâ? First, Iâd like to answer, âWhy fraternity?â I think all young men should explore joining a fraternity. The lifelong friendships, vast network, and skills that fraternity\n\nmembership teaches are benefits unique to the fraternity experience. Why Pike? Since joining over 33 years ago, and meeting hundreds of men from other fraternities, I believe PIKE has a higher expectation of its members and will provide the resources to get them to meet these expectations. All organizations expect strong academics and appropriate behavior from their members, but we expect an attitude of competing to be the best we can be at everything we do. I believe that these expectations make life more fulfilling. S&D: Youâve had a lot of professional success as well. What did you learn as an undergraduate member that prepared you for your career? When I entered the workforce, I felt like I was cheating because of where I was in my professional development compared to others my age. Simple skills that can only be learned in a fraternity environment like listening to opposing views, participating in meetings, organizing my week, understanding emotional outbursts, and handling rejection. While others had to grow and learn these lessons along the way, I was using them from day one. S&D: What advice would you give a recent grad about giving back to the Fraternity as a young alumnus? First, do it now, and for any chapter â itâs not just about yours. Next, donât just think about the experience you had as an undergraduate and the structure of support that was present in your chapter. The benefits a\n\nrecent grad can provide to a chapter are incredibly valuable because of their familiarity and ability to relate to the undergraduate members. S&D: How has fatherhood shaped you as a leader? Fatherhood has changed everything about the person I am. Ask anyone who knew me before and after. Iâm a more understanding and empathetic person since our daughter was born. Iâve al- ways been a good person â my mom instilled the value of ethics and honesty in me from the beginning â but I see people differently today than I used to. As a leader, I meet people where they are and help them get to where they need to be. Before I was a father, I started at the destination and essen- tially told people âGet here. Iâll help you but get here or leave.â Today, itâs more like: âHereâs where you want to be and hereâs where you are. Letâs get moving in the right direction together and take it a few steps at a time.â My ability to influence is much greater now than before. S&D: Are there any individuals that have served as role models in your life? Sure, and theyâve changed as Iâve moved through the different stages of life. They were always real peo- ple, though. I never really\n\nThe Presidents Badge that all international presidents wear.\n\nâThe decline of the number of young men entering college now and through the next several years has created a major threat for fraternities but has also presented a great opportunity.â\n\nadmired celebrities or people I didnât know.\n\nMy baseball and football coaches were everything to me when I was growing up. In college, our house corporation president Rick Nail had a presence that I still wish I had. He held the delicate balance of love for the Fraternity and firmness\n\n11\n\nCOURAGE TO BE MORE\n\nSPRING 2024\n\nRoo 47\n\nbetween our council and staff about the progress of our ve-expansion projects and the incredible success we had on those campuses last fall. One of our undergraduate brothers, Eddie from Long Beach, was working out in the Peabody Hotel gym after the Chapter Executives Conference in January. I was there already, and he said to me: âYour speech last night changed my life.â In 1992, Jerry Askewâs speech at the Phoenix Convention changed my life, so this was a special moment that Iâll always remember. Presenting the 2023 Loyalty Award to A. Frank Smith was incredible. In the middle of my speech, once the audience learned that the winner was Frank, all 600 men jumped to their feet and gave him the loudest ovation that banquet hall has ever heard. The greatest memory was my nine-year-old daughter running up to the stage to hug me after I was elected International President. My wife followed close behind her â she didnât run. I couldnât stop crying after that. I was going to be able to walk in the same path that only 53 other Pikes had walked, and I got to hug the two of them at the same time, and the emotions were overwhelming. S&D: Outside of family, Fraternity, and career, what brings you joy (besides Florida football)? Well, Florida football hasnât brought me joy for a long time. Iâm simple. Iâm in love with my routine when Iâm not traveling for work â walking our dog, working out, taking\n\nabout her day, etc. Seriously, my favorite thing to do is have movie night with them. To answer your question, I love snow skiing. Even though Iâve been traveling for work my whole career, I still love to travel â especially to new places. I like to read the classics â currently a quarter of the way through War and Peace . I like to play golf, though I havenât been able to do much of it lately. I enjoy following all sports, but I especially like college football, professional baseball, and professional basketball. I love attending baseball games at minor and major league parks. S&D: What is the top item on your bucket list? The number one priority of my life is to help my daugh- ter live a fullling life and make a positive impact on her community. Not really a bucket list item, but itâs the center of everything I do. S&D: How would you like to be remembered as international president? I hope Iâm remembered as an international president who sparked us to grow while every other fraternity is trying to manage a decline in membership. Peterson served two terms as international vice president prior to his election as international president in 2022. He facilitated the Fraternityâs strategic plan in 2016, and served as an international educational and recruitment advisor, as Sunshine Regional President, Alpha Eta Alumni Association president, and chapter advisor to Eta Phi Chapter (Central Florida). He was also a member of the Fraternityâs staff. Peterson is the founder and president of Vector Firm, which specializes in sales and marketing consulting, and training services focused on the security technology industry. He resides in Orlando, Florida with his wife and daughter.\n\nto do the right things. As I left college, Pikes like Ernie Cox and Kevin Virta served as role models for me â they just did the right thing, and it always seems effortless. Today, my role models are close friends who are fathers and professionals. I have a handful that serve as my personal board of advisors.\n\nAbove: The Peterson Family\n\nâTe ube one ioty of ife is to he y date live a ffii g li ean a e a poitve imct on e comut.â\n\nI have had several role models over the years from the International\n\nPike network, I wanted to become half the speaker that Jerry Askew is. I wanted to hold court like John Michael Williams. I wanted to inuence others and show the charisma of Kevin Knaus. Shad Williams has an unreal ability to gather intelligence from others and use it rather than rely on only his experience â something I donât do enough of.

CHILI COOKOFF This annual competition at the last home football tailgate for the last 16 years mainly started to have a creative way to feed everyone at the tailgate and to encourage more turnout in cold November weather. Attendees vote with donations for their âfavorite chiliâ (or favorite brother). This creates good com- petition, bragging rights, brotherhood, fun and a few dollars for scholarships. Records of Former Champions are kept and announced each year, creating pride and interest. This has raised a modest $1,953 throughout the years, but it has created a lot of talk, brotherhood and fun.\n\nthe e val e , ut he oe s te way encoure othe a n to patcpte in te ielo raterit epeiece bÂ comÂiÂg te conti e cultvtÂon oÂ bot e hooÂ a Âivn acÂ to our - de a te bot e s.
