        "text": "In 1776, students at the College of William & Mary founded the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the first Greek-letter fraternity in the United States. More than 240 years later, Greek life has become a hallmark of the American undergraduate experience.\n\nAt Hampden-Sydney College, Greek-letter fraternities have thrived for nearly 170 years, and they continue to serve as a fundamental feature of campus life today. About 50% of all Hampden-Sydney students join a fraternity, forming life-long friendships, enriching their social lives while complementing the College's rigorous academic program, and ultimately joining a nationwide network of fraternity brothers.\n\nBoasting 10 nationally-chartered fraternities, Hampden-Sydney brothers engage in philanthropy and community service and host social events including live bands, DJs, and tailgates at sporting events.\n\nFraternities at H-SC:\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha\n\nFounded in 1906\n\nXi Zeta Chapter\n\nChartered on April 5, 1986\n\nMulti-Chapter MOU between LU and H-SC\n\nChi Phi\n\nFounded in 1824\n\nEpsilon Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1867\n\nDelta Kappa Epsilon\n\nFounded in 1844\n\nZeta Gamma Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 2013\n\nKappa Alpha Order\n\nFounded in 1865\n\nAlpha Tau Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1899\n\nKappa Alpha Psi\n\nFounded in 1911\n\nRho Kappa Chapter (Colony)\n\nChartered July 23, 2016\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 2017\n\nKappa Sigma\n\nFounded in 1869\n\nUpsilon Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1883\n\nPhi Gamma Delta\n\nFounded in 1848\n\nDelta Deuteron Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1870\n\nRe-chartered in 1967\n\nPi Kappa Alpha\n\nFounded in 1868\n\nIota Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1885\n\nRe-chartered in 2015\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon\n\nFounded in 1856\n\nVirginia Upsilon Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1860\n\nRe-chartered in 1971\n\nSigma Chi\n\nFounded in 1855\n\nSigma Sigma Chapter\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1872\n\nRe-chartered at Hampden-Sydney in 1931 and 1984\n\nSigma Nu\n\nFounded in 1869\n\nEta Pi Chapter\n\nFounded in 1962 as Delta Epsilon Fraternity\n\nBecame Delta Epsilon Colony of the Sigma Nu Fraternity in 1963\n\nBecame a Chapter of Sigma Nu in 1965\n\nRe-colonized in 1998\n\nTheta Chi\n\nFounded in 1856\n\nNu Chapter (formerly Delta Delta Fraternity or Delta Deuteron)\n\nEstablished at Hampden-Sydney in 1911\n\nRe-chartered in 1999\n\nHazing Misconduct Report"
