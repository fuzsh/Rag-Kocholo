        "text": "WHEREAS, the liberal principles of our Society should not be confined to any particular place, person or description of persons, but should be extended to the wise and virtuous of whatever community;\n\nWHEREAS, we, the members of PΒΚ as a body dedicated from its very founding in the historic year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six at the College of William and Mary in Virginia to the ideal of excellence in scholarship in the liberal arts and sciences, are willing and desirous to propagate the Society in praiseworthy institutions of higher learning; and\n\nWHEREAS, we are satisfied that you are inspired by an unquenchable desire that your institution be added to the notable company which enjoy the recognition of PΒΚ, and we have carefully determined that your institution is possessed of the character and standing which make it particularly worthy of admittance into this association and friendship;\n\nTherefore, by virtue of resolution duly adopted by our representatives in the fortieth triennial Council of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, we have decreed the establishment at this time of a chapter of PΒΚ in EckerdCollege in the State of Florida, to be known as the Zeta of Florida.\n\nFURTHERMORE, we have commanded that there issue under the seal of the Society and the hands of the President and the Secretary this Charter in the name of PΒΚ.\n\nAccordingly, you and such others as you may hereafter elect and associate with yourselves in conformity to the law of PΒΚ, and your and their successors so elected and associated are hereby incorporated and established as a separate and coordinate branch of the Society and are hereby granted all the powers, privileges, and benefits thereunto appertaining, in as full and ample measure as the members of the existing chapters enjoy: there being at the same time enjoined upon and required of you, in the organization and conduct of the chapter and as conditions upon which this Charter is granted, strict compliance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, with the acts of the Council and the Senate, and with the Chapter Constitution herewith transmitted to you; and likewise a devoted effort always to protect the name and the key of PΒΚ from imitation and indignities and faithfully to promote the purposes of the Society.\n\nIn Testimony Whereof, the President and the Secretary of the Phi Beta Kappa Society have hereunto set their hands and caused to be affixed its seal this twenty-seventh day of February, anno Domini two thousand and four.\n\nElection to membership in Phi Beta Kappa is an honor typically conferred upon fewer than ten percent of each graduating class. Students do not apply for membership but are selected during the spring semester each year by the Phi Beta Kappa chapter as a whole, after a careful review of the academic records of each eligible candidate. Members are generally elected in their senior year, but the chapter may elect deserving juniors as well.\n\nElection is based upon the evidence of broad cultural interests, scholarly achievement, and good character. Candidates for membership should have a distinguished record of performance in liberal arts courses, exclusive of professional and vocational training, internships, and practica. They should demonstrate a broad exposure to the liberal arts — fine arts, humanities, languages, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences — as well as substantial work in areas outside their major.\n\nElection to membership in Phi Beta Kappa is wholly within the discretion of the members of the local chapter, subject only to the limitations imposed by the chapter constitution and bylaws. There is no right to election solely by reason of fulfillment of a minimum grade point average. Although the honor bestowed by membership in the Society recognizes academic achievement, the qualifications for election to Phi Beta Kappa are entirely independent of the academic policies of Eckerd College, and it should not be assumed that fulfillment of the requirements for graduation with high honors renders one automatically eligible for election to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nSome Specific Minimal Criteria for Selection\n\nSenior standing (except in rare cases).\n\nThe completion of at least three semesters at Eckerd and being registered for a fourth.\n\n24 of 32 semester-length classes must be in liberal work. Liberal work is defined as courses in traditional liberal arts subjects (humanities, fine arts, languages, sciences, social sciences), excluding courses in vocation-oriented areas such as management and international business. In addition, courses that focus on the acquisition of specific skills and techniques do not count as liberal work. Examples of such courses are studio art and music classes, composition classes, applied speech and communication classes, and internships.\n\nMajoring in a liberal arts discipline (for example, something other than international business, management, or information systems).\n\nAt least a 3.75 grade point average in liberal arts classes, excluding courses in “applied or professional work”—that is, courses in vocation-oriented areas such as management and international business, or courses that focus on the acquisition of specific skills and techniques. (See #3 above)\n\nThe demonstration of knowledge of a foreign language equivalent to completion of the intermediate college level (that is, two years). This requirement may be met by a proficiency test.\n\nThe demonstration of knowledge of mathematics at least minimally appropriate for liberal education. The mathematics requirement may be fulfilled by completing any mathematics, statistics, or formal logic course that satisfies the computational requirement at Eckerd College.\n\nHow Do You Become a Member of Sigma Xi?\n\nMembership is by nomination. Nominations must be made and seconded by currently active FULL members of Sigma Xi. Research aptitude must be evidenced by independent investigation, which will lead to publication or peer-acceptance of the work. If you are member and have someone to nominate, please let one of the chapter officers know and we’ll initiate the required paperwork.\n\nPlease note that membership in the Society is not linked to the possession of any degree or contingent upon belonging to some other organization.\n\nThere are two types of membership:\n\nFull Membership\n\nGraduate students, post-docs, research associates, faculty or any individual who has shown noteworthy achievement as an original investigator in a field of pure or applied science are qualified for nomination for Full Membership. This noteworthy achievement must be evidenced by publication as a first author on two articles published in a refereed journal, patents, written reports or a thesis or dissertation. Only Full Members may nominate other candidates to the Society or vote in the annual Assembly of Delegates. In addition, only Full Members are eligible to serve on Sigma Xi committees or take office on the Board of Directors.\n\nAssociate Membership\n\nUndergraduates or individuals who have, through initial research achievement in a field of pure or applied science, demonstrated aptitude for research, may be nominated for Associate Membership. An individual who has conducted independent investigation and written a report concerning their research is eligible for election to Associate Membership. The individual is expected to later achieve the requirements for Full Membership. Nominators are attesting to the nominee’s potential to be promoted to Full Membership in the future. Associate Membership is offered to encourage young investigators with promise to continue careers in research.\n\nAn Associate Member may be promoted to Full Membership once they have published as primary author or demonstrated other noteworthy achievements in research. Please see the Full Membership qualifications above. Only Full Members may nominate other candidates to the Society or vote in the annual Assembly of Delegates. In addition, only Full Members are eligible to serve on Sigma Xi committees or take office on the Board of Directors.\n\nNon-Discrimination Policy\n\nNeither Sigma Xi, nor any chapter of Sigma Xi, shall discriminate against candidates for election to membership on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, national origin, or disability."
