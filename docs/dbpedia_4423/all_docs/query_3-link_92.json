        "text": "Barber-Scotia College, one of the nation’s oldest HBCUs, has announced the appointment of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.’s current International President, Chris V. Rey, J.D., as its new President, effective July 17, 2023. The decision comes after an extensive nationwide search conducted by an internal committee led by Roberta Huger Pinckney, Chair of the Board of Trustees, and involvement from alumni and community stakeholders.\n\nPresident-elect Rey’s appointment marks a significant turning point for Barber-Scotia College, as it strives to regain its prominence and position among historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). With a vision of leading the college’s resurgence, Rey brings a wealth of leadership experience and a strong commitment to Barber-Scotia’s mission.\n\nExpressing his deep sense of honor, President-elect Rey stated, “I am beyond honored to have been selected by the board to serve at the helm of one of the nation’s oldest historically black colleges. My steps have always been ordained by God, and I’m confident my past leadership experiences have prepared me to lead Barber-Scotia’s resurgence.”\n\nPresident-elect Rey is poised to tackle the challenges ahead, which include obtaining accreditation for the college which hasn’t had it since 2004, ensuring financial stability, fostering transparent relationships with alumni and the city of Concord, North Carolina and driving enrollment growth. His business acumen, combined with his extensive experience in government and law, positions him well to steer Barber-Scotia College toward a brighter future.\n\nRoberta Huger Pinckney, Chair of the Board of Trustees and a 1969 graduate of Barber-Scotia College, expressed her excitement for the college’s future under President-elect Rey’s leadership. “We are excited and look forward to President-elect Rey’s leadership. He brings his business acumen as well as his experience and knowledge of government and the law to help this small HBCU regain its rightful place among all HBCUs in the country. Mr. Rey is a businessman, and at Barber-Scotia, we are in the business of education and training,” Pinckney affirmed.\n\nDr. Tracey Flemmings, Interim President for the past 18 months and a 1986 graduate of Barber-Scotia College, expressed her enthusiasm for a smooth transition and high hopes for President-elect Rey’s leadership. “We are ecstatic to have Mr. Rey join our Barber-Scotia College Community. He will bring great energy, wisdom, professionalism, and the support our campus needs. We are pleased with his selection, and we will have a loyal and enthusiastic team of alums that will be here to provide continued support,” Flemmings stated.\n\nPresident-elect Rey brings a diverse background to his new role. Born in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and raised in Spring Lake, NC, he holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a concentration in Information Systems from Walden University and a Juris Doctor degree from William & Mary School of Law. Rey’s commitment to public service is evident through his military career, having served for 22 years of active duty and Army National Guard service, including his work in establishing the first cyber brigade headquarters for the National Guard.\n\nCurrently serving as the International President of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., one of the nation’s oldest historically Black fraternities founded in 1914, President-elect Rey is no stranger to leadership and community development. Notably, he is leading an initiative within the fraternity to construct a multi-million-dollar affordable housing apartment complex in Washington, D.C. Additionally, he serves on the Board of Governors for Charisma University, the Board of Visitors for Fayetteville State University, and the Board of Directors for the William & Mary University Alumni Association.\n\nPresident-elect Rey’s extensive experience, dedication to education, and commitment to community empowerment make him an ideal candidate to lead Barber-Scotia College into a new era of growth and success. As he assumes the presidency, President-elect Rey’s leadership will be instrumental in revitalizing the college’s mission of preparing African Americans for success.\n\nBarber-Scotia College, founded by the Presbyterian Church in 1867, holds a cherished place in history as the first historically black female institution of higher education established after the American Civil War. Through President-elect Rey’s leadership, the college aims to reclaim its accreditation, strengthen financial stability, forge strong partnerships with alumni and the community, and increase enrollment.\n\nAs Barber-Scotia College embarks on this exciting new chapter under the guidance of President-elect Chris V. Rey, the college community, alumni, and supporters eagerly anticipate the transformative impact his leadership will have on the institution’s future. With President-elect Rey at the helm, Barber-Scotia College is poised to regain its rightful place as a beacon of education, empowerment, and opportunity within the HBCU landscape.\n\nShare this on on social media"
