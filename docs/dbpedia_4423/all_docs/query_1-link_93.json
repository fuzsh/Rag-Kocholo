Outcomes remain published as follows: ten calendar years for incidents involving hazing allegations and three academic years after issuance or until the sanction is complete, if the sanction takes longer than three years to complete.\n\nWe add records to the list as conduct outcomes become final post-appeal period, and we remove eligible records within 30 days of the end of each academic semester.\n\nUnder each organization's name, the columns detail the date of the violation, sanctions, the section of the Code the organization violated, the summary, and the scheduled record removal date."
