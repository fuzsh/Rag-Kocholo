        "text": "“Mommy, what’s that?” my daughter said as I pinned on my husband’s Sig Ep badge under my Pi Phi arrow while getting ready for an alumnae event. “It’s Daddy’s fraternity pin,” I said. “I didn’t know Daddy was a pirate,” said my daughter, who was three or four at the time, after seeing the skull and crossbones on the badge. This conversation took place more than two decades ago, and a smile comes to my face every time I think about it.\n\nToday, November 1, is Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Founders’ Day. Twelve young men at the University of Richmond, one of whom, Carter Ashton Jenkins, was a Chi Phi member from Rutgers University, founded the fraternity in 1901. Jenkins first sought a charter from his fraternity, but the request was declined because the Baptist school was considered too small.\n\nJenkins then found 11 Richmond men who were also eager to share a brotherhood built upon “the love of God and the principle of peace through brotherhood.” They named the organization Sigma Phi unaware that there was already a men’s fraternity by that name. The group added another Greek-letter to the name and became Sigma Phi Epsilon.\n\nOne of my favorite Sig Eps (next to my husband, of course) is Theodor Seuss Geisel who is better known as Dr. Seuss. A member of Dartmouth College’s Class of 1925, Geisel was a member of the New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon. To read more about Geisel, see the post at http://wp.me/p20I1i-bh.\n\nSig Ep’s red door tradition had it start at my Alma Mater, Syracuse University.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nWelcome! Chances are good you found this blog by searching for something about fraternities or sororities.\n\nI was the last person anyone would have suspected of joining a sorority in college. I am sure I would have agreed with them, too.\n\nWhen I made my way to Syracuse University, I saw the houses with the Greek letters that edged Walnut Park, and wished I could tour them. My roommate suggested I sign up for rush (as it was then called, today it’s known as recruitment) and go through the house tour round and then drop out of rush. It sounded like a plan. I didn’t realize that I would end up feeling at home at one of the chapters. And that I would become a member.\n\nIn this blog I will share the history of GLOs and other topics. I wrote a dissertation on “Coeducation and the History of Women’s Fraternities 1867-1902.″ It chronicles the growth of the system and the birth of the National Panhellenic Conference.\n\nMy Master’s thesis details the history of the fraternity system at Southern Illinois University Carbondale from 1948-1960. The dates are significant ones and the thesis is available on the top menu.\n\nI have done research at the Student Life Archives and have written several histories of University of Illinois fraternity chapters for the Society for the Preservation of Greek Housing.\n\nThanks for stopping by."
