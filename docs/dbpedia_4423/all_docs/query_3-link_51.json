        "text": "Fraternities and sororities have a long and rich history in the United States. The year 1776 saw the birth of both the United States of America and Phi Beta Kappa, the first American society bearing a Greek letter name. Phi Beta Kappa was founded December 5, 1776, at the college of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, the second oldest college in America.\n\nGreek life has been part of San Francisco State University’s history since 1928 with the installation of the Epsilon Chapter of Delta Phi Upsilon at San Francisco State Teachers’ College (Franciscan, 1928). Currently, 49 Greek organizations are formally recognized at SF State under the umbrella of the United Greek Council.\n\nGreek organizations serve to enhance the college experience at SF State. Greek life provides a supportive community in which students can explore, grow, and learn new leadership skills, academic discipline, event planning, financial proficiency, professional aptitude and social networking skills. Greek life provides a national and/or local network of sisters, brothers and alumnus who are committed to supporting development, growth, and the achievement of life goals. Each individual student brings with them their own set of skills and abilities. Joining an organization helps to further develop individual strengths, while at the same time introducing new opportunities that will help to stretch beyond perceived capabilities.\n\nIt is a common assumption that all Greek organizations are alike. Greek lettered organizations are vastly diverse and represent various principles and values.\n\nOur fraternity and sorority life break into various councils based upon values, principles, culture, service, social, and much more. These councils include:\n\nUnited Greek Council (UGC)\n\nCollege Panhellenic Conference (CPC)\n\nInter-Fratneral Council (IFC)\n\nNational Pan Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nLatino Greek Council (LGC)\n\nMulticultural Greek Council (MGC)"
