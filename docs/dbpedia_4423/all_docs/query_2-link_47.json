        "text": "TO PROMOTE BROTHERHOOD\n\nJustice, Harmony, and Brotherly Love are essential to the spirit of fraternity. We promise to set an example of true brotherhood not only in our relations with each other but in our association with people everywhere\n\nTO STIMULATE SCHOLARSHIP\n\nWisdom comes with learning. Complementing the mission of higher education, we seek to help our members to combine formal and informal learning experiences; and, by broadening their understanding of human relationships, to produce men of wisdom who will be better prepared to make positive contributions to society and all mankind.\n\nTO DEVELOP CHARACTER\n\nHonor is the basis of fraternal relationships. We resolve to instill in each member a devotion to those values which will guide him to ends that are noble and right, so that in all that he represents and in all that he does, he shall be known as a man of honor who inspires others by his example and thus wins admiration and respect for himself and for Phi Sigma Kappa.\n\nVALUE BROTHERHOOD ABOVE SELF\n\nPhi Sigma Kappa embraces the belief that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Our actions, policies, and decisions are based on what is best for the Fraternity rather than what is best for one or a few individuals. Our contributions to society, our host institutions, our alumni, and our undergraduate members are more important than acting for the benefit of only a few.\n\nFor example, Phi Sigma Kappa strives to have all of its members work together as a whole on various projects, from homecomings to philanthropies, from campus cleanups to academic enhancement programs, even if the effort given to such programs may impinge from time to time upon the personal time and/or desires of its individual members.\n\nDEMAND EXCELLENCE\n\nPhi Sigma Kappa expects its leadership, alumni, and undergraduates to strive to do their best. Excellence, rather than perfection, is our goal. Phi Sigma Kappa expects excellence in our colleges, universities, and inter-fraternal peers â€¦ but the Fraternity demands excellence from our members.\n\nFor example, even though there are minimum academic standards for various membership levels, and even though most institutions require a minimum grade point average for its fraternities and sororities, Phi Sigma Kappa believes that each member should strive to achieve the highest possible academic achievement, regardless of any minimum expectations set by others.\n\nCOMMIT TO LIFELONG LEARNING\n\nLearning is fundamental to the Fraternity, not for the degrees or accolades, but in the journey towards enlightenment. Phi Sigma Kappa is an intentional component of the college campus and an adjunct to the learning process. While much of that learning occurs when our members are undergraduates, we continue to provide learning opportunities for our alumni.\n\nFor example, many of our chapters hold career planning sessions where alumni bring their expertise into the chapter for our members and their friends, providing helpful information to those in attendance and giving alumni the chance to learn about the future leaders of their professions in our country."
