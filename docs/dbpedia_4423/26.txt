In 1776, students at the College of William & Mary founded the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the first Greek-letter fraternity in the United States. More than 240 years later, Greek life has become a hallmark of the American undergraduate experience.

At Hampden-Sydney College, Greek-letter fraternities have thrived for nearly 170 years, and they continue to serve as a fundamental feature of campus life today. About 50% of all Hampden-Sydney students join a fraternity, forming life-long friendships, enriching their social lives while complementing the College's rigorous academic program, and ultimately joining a nationwide network of fraternity brothers.

Boasting 10 nationally-chartered fraternities, Hampden-Sydney brothers engage in philanthropy and community service and host social events including live bands, DJs, and tailgates at sporting events.
