        "text": "I am worn out from this. My mother's t.v., at least once a month, suddenly has no sound on some of the stations. Xfinity resends the signals, they monkey remotely with it and then finally say: We need to send a technician. The first time they said this, I took time off from work to meet the technician at my mother's house. Took him less than 5 minutes. He went into settings, showed me where the audio was set to Spanish instead of Default Language, reset it and now all of the stations worked and had sound...in English. He said that if it is set to Spanish, then if it is a station that doesn't have the ability to broadcast in Spanish there is zero sound because the system doesn't know what to do. He said it is a known issue at Xfinity and they have no explanation as to what causes the box to reset on it's own to Spanish. That service call cost me $70.00 (I am disputing it). I was told that the Xfinity customer service technical support team ( the 800 number you call) has two steps that they are supposed to follow. 1. Refresh the box signal. If that doesn't work, then 2. Check the audio setting and remotely reset it to the appropriate language. Let me assure you, when you call tech support there is no one who knows how to reset the language remotely. My mother is too elderly to understand how to go into the settings every time this happens , so I drive to her home which is nowhere close to where I live and via the remote control go in and reset the audio from Spanish to either the default language or English. Either one seems to work once selected. Then all of the channels work again. By the way, no one in tech support was able to tell me how to find the settings area, only the technician that they sent to the house. For me, on the remote control it is under the Xfinity button, then main menu, then set up, then audio. If it is set on Spanish, you have to go to the box under language and switch it to \"no\" and then arrow up to the box above and change the language. I hope that this explanation saves you a $70.00 service call. I don't understand why I continue to pay so much money for service that is so abysmal. Xfinity for cable is the only game in town and my mom needs to have t.v. I wish that Xfinity would pay me for gas, time off and aggravation."
