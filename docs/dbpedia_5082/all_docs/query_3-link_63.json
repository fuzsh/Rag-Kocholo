        "text": "For my first review in the picture book genre series I have chosen the classic children’s tale Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown with illustrations by Clement Hurd. First written in 1947, this book has served as a beloved bedtime story for many generations of children, but did you know that when the book initially came out a major library (the New York Public Library) refused to carry the book because of its writing style? Interestingly, according to the media blog Mental_floss (Keyser 2015) it did not grace NYPL shelves until 1973… 26 years after its initial publication!\n\nRead on by clicking the \"Read More\" link below for more interesting history and my own commentary about the book.\n\nBibliography:\n\nWise, Margaret Brown. 1947. Goodnight Moon. Ill. by Clement Hurd. New York: HarperTrophy. ISBN 0064430170.\n\nPlot Summary:\n\nGoodnight Moon is the simple bedtime tale of a young bunny who wants to say “goodnight” to everything he notices in his room before going to sleep. The entire story is told in rhyming verse, similar to a lullaby.\n\nBrown’s book represented a new trend in children’s literature. At the time of the book’s writing, many authors were focused on publishing fantasy stories or fables. Goodnight Moon, however, was firmly grounded in reality, reflecting a new “here-and-now” style of writing. Intended to reflect the thinking of an actual child and his interaction with objects in his own, small world, this style was initially criticized and in some cases, the book was left off of library shelves entirely (Keyser 2015).\n\nCritical Analysis:\n\nGoodnight Moon was among my favorite books as a child. My mother recalls me asking her to read it over and over until it became a part of my nightly routine. It has been years since I have read it and I wanted to determine (objectively) if the book still has literary merit, my own nostalgia aside. Would children today enjoy this bedtime tale as much as I had?\n\nCharacters\n\nThe characters in this book are very simple. Though the young bunny seems to be the main focus of the story, I would argue that the objects in the room also serve as “characters.” The bunny does not have any outstanding personality traits or characteristics. However, he does appear to hold a view of the world similar to that of a very young child. I am wondering if perhaps the goal of the author was to make the young bunny character less developed so that children could insert themselves into the story. The objects in the room that serve as side characters, however, are very distinctive. The kittens, the cow, the three bears, and all the other objects are unique and make their own appearance in the story.\n\nPlot\n\nGoodnight Moon is a story told in just one hundred and twenty-five words, thus the plot of the book is very simplistic. There are no elements of conflict or moments of growth. However, there is a satisfying sense that the book is moving toward an ending reflected purely in the illustrations. As the bunny bids different objects goodnight, the moon rises outside and the room darkens indicating a clear passage of time. Perceptive children can easily pick up on these visual cues and understand the logical progression of the bunny drifting off to sleep.\n\nThe plot itself, while simple, does reflect a realistic situation in a young child’s life. It is not uncommon for a child to personify objects in his world. The bunny “speaks” to every object as if it were a human being awaiting a greeting. When examining the illustrations, one can see that he even turns to face some objects directly as if he were speaking to them (like the teddy bears).\n\nAdditionally, it is common for children to develop a series of comfortable routines, similar to the bunny bidding each object goodnight before going to bed. The plot, while not particularly striking or memorable, is definitely relatable to a young age group.\n\nI suppose that is where my main point of contention lies with the book. The plot is so simplistic that it is likely to appeal only to younger children or those who enjoy the nostalgia factor of it. I would think that older children would quickly become bored of the plot line and would instead favor a more complex bedtime book like Llama, Llama Red Pajama by Anna Dewdney because of its inclusion of conflict and a climax (a little llama trying to go to sleep on his own and feeling lonely).\n\nSetting\n\nThe book is set inside of a house during the evening. Through beautiful visuals, the room darkens as it gets later and it really feels like to the reader that they are inside of the book.\n\nThough the book was written in 1947, I would argue that it holds up very well. There are no strange conventions in the way the book was written that would indicate an archaic way of speaking. Simple language is used to convey the story. This can be compared to something like, say, Make Way for Ducklings by Robert McCloskey that was written around the same time and uses a lot of phrases like “all of a dither” that end up dating the book.\n\nGoodnight Moon’s illustrations, for the most part, transcend time. They retain a classic charm, but children can still relate to the objects drawn within the room. It is very likely that they have those same objects in their own rooms. If we are again to compare this to something like Make Way for Ducklings published just six years prior, we see illustrations that clearly convey a time period. The way the car models were drawn do not look anything like modern vehicles. Likewise, the clothing style reflects the time period in which the book was created.\n\nToday's children would still have an easy time relating to Goodnight Moon because it does not have a complex setting—it is just a tale of a character in his bedroom.\n\nTheme\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one thing that sets Brown’s book apart from many others being published at that time is its lack of a heavy-handed moral. Rather, it focuses children on being in the “here and now” and the importance of observing the world around them. Particularly astute children usually notice small things included in the colorful, two-page spreads. The book begs for children to stop and take notice!\n\nStyle\n\nGoodnight Moon is written in a sing-song rhyming style that resembles a lullaby. I am sure this is no accident as it pairs well with the nighttime setting of the book. The language used in the book is very basic, much like how a child might think or talk. The repetition and two-stanza rhythm make it easy for a child to predict what words might come next in the book. The language is straightforward and literal without any wordplay, however, that makes this book an excellent choice for early readers.\n\nIllustrations\n\nThis is where the book shines. Hurd does an excellent job of conveying a realistic setting. On each colored page the room darkens, the moon moves across the sky, and living things like the mouse and the kittens move across the floor. The objects are detailed and well-hidden enough that children can read this book several times over before discovering everything each scene has to offer. What a great idea for a book that focuses on taking notice of the world around you!\n\nThe colors are also stunning. The contrast of red and yellow objects against a green wall really make them stand out. The colors are so vibrant that in the room scenes each object can be seen clearly, even as the room darkens.\n\nA very unique feature of this book is that its large scenes that show the entire room are printed in color, while the scenes that focus on objects are in black and white. This was likely for practical reasons when the book came out (to save money on printing so that the book would be affordable). However, I think it brings a unique sense of charm and really helps to separate the contrasting scenes of the big picture versus a focus on specific objects. Furthermore, black and white allows the child to see the object’s lines in clearer detail without the distraction of bright colors.\n\nAs an activity, children can be asked try and remember the colors of the object that they saw in the previous scene. For example, \"What color is the cow jumping over the moon? Yellow!\" This further enhances a child’s observation skills.\n\nThough it is not explicitly stated in the book how the illustrations were created, they have a washable marker-like quality to them. Save for a few objects, Hurd seems to stick closely to primary colors. Patterns in the illustration are few and those that exist are very basic so as not to distract from spotting objects in the room. Children will likely find the use of basic, monochromatic colors comforting. Especially appreciated is the fact that he darkened the colors inside while brightening the blue hue of the sky outside. It is a beautiful touch that accurately conveys how light behaves in the evening.\n\nCultural Markers\n\nI did not see any clear cultural markers being displayed within the story. All of the major players within the story are not human. Additionally, the language being used in the story does not reflect any particular heritages. This is a story that is applicable across cultures and is unlikely to offend any audience that wishes to read it.\n\nAwards:\n\nFrom my research, I did not see any major awards for this title, though it is a national bestseller. Additionally, School Library Journal did rank it as number four on their “Top 100 Picture Books” list in 2012 (Bird). Additionally, the National Education Association (NEA) ranked Goodnight Moon as number five on their “Teachers’ Top 100 Books for Children” list (2007). Review Excerpt(s):\n\n“Little children will love this going to sleep book -- a really fresh idea by a talented and prolific author, illustrated by Clement Hurd. In a soft sing-song, here is a bunny saying goodnight room, goodnight moon, goodnight to all the familiar objects in the softly lighted room. Then- as the room darkens, in successive pictures, the goodnight ceremony moves forward. The colors range from a bright, crisp red, green, yellow, to an almost black background. Despite the high price, which takes it out of the straight merchandise market, this is a good buy, from quality of text and pictures -- and most of all, idea.”\n\n-- Kirkus Reviews (1947, published online 2011)\n\n“Parents need to know that pediatricians recommend that a child have a bedtime routine, something familiar and soothing that indicates the end of the play day and time for rest.Goodnight Moon takes the doctor's advice.”\n\n-- Common Sense Media (n.d.)\n\nConnections:\n\nOther Books by Margaret Wise Brown:\n\n♥ My World. 1949.
