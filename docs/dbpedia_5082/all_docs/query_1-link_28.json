        "text": "For those who still enjoy a cable subscription, here is a selection of cable and network TV shows, movies and specials that broadcast this week, May 20-26. Details and times are subject to change.\n\nMonday\n\nSTAX: SOULSVILLE, U.S.A. 9 p.m. on HBO. Satellite Records in Memphis (now Stax Records), which opened its doors in 1957, helped start the careers of Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Sam & Dave and more. This documentary series uses archival footage and interviews to look back on the relationships shared by musicians, songwriters and producers and highlights the work they all did in pushing the racial barriers of the time.\n\nSO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE 9 p.m. on Fox. All season the judges Allison Holker, Maksim Chmerkovskiy and JoJo Siwa have been sharing feedback with the dancers in this competition show with episode themes including Broadway, music videos and movies — and now it is time to crown a winner.\n\nTuesday\n\nTHE ROOKIE 9 p.m. on ABC. This show, staring Nathan Fillion as the oldest rookie in the Los Angeles Police Department, is wrapping up its 6th season this week. The penultimate episode left things on a cliffhanger, with Dr. London on the run, potentially endangering her immunity deal. Will we have to wait a year for loose ends to be tied up?\n\nTHE GOOD DOCTOR 10 p.m. on ABC. Over the seven seasons of this show, we have really seen Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) go on a full journey. He started as a nervous young surgeon and has blossomed into a top guy in his field, a husband and a father. Highmore told Deadline that he hadn’t expected the show to run seven seasons, “but one of the things that I have always appreciated about the show — and saw as potential from the very beginning — is the opportunity for Shaun to evolve and learn and grow and change,” he said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
