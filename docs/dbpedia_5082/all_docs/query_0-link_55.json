        "text": "üì£ Working class audiences want the BBC to take more risks when producing new programmes, according to new research. Lower socio-economic groups account for almost a quarter of the UK‚Äôs population and watch more TV on average than anyone else. But our latest audience research has shown that they are less satisfied with the BBC compared to other services, and that it lacks representation. Many found that those that did represent them often reverted to stereotypes or tokenist characteristics. However, the connection is not lost. Many still rate the BBC‚Äôs news offering and consider it the home for big, milestone events that bring the nation together. This research coincides with our sixth annual report on the BBC which also highlights some tough choices for the organisation as they continue their ‚Äòdigital-first‚Äô approach. Find out more here: https://lnkd.in/ecDEhZpK\n\n#Storytelling Quo Vadis RTE? Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann/Radio Television Ireland is our national storyteller, but enough is enough. Handshaking in gold after a scandal is not a good look. Enough about NDAs, and the secrecy they breed which is an Irish speciality. But I come to praise RTE, not bury her. As the sonnet of scandal becomes first an epic, then a saga, then a multi-season metanarrative, the way to Trust Regained is not necessarily more heads rolling. Seeing the most popular man in Ireland last summer trundled in a tumbril to the stocks and pelted with rotten fruit and vegetables was deeply unedifying. This is about civilization, and keeping our peasant urges in check. What to Actually Do Now? Not argue about funding, private, public or otherwise. This is to approach the problem from the rear end. Funding of any kind always and only and ultimately follows audience and attention. Ireland has some of the most powerful kinship in the world, also reflected in our global diaspora. But every great virtue carries a hidden vice, and ours has been cronyism. Will RTE please stop interviewing each other? Will it please stop mainlining the national news with what's happening at RTE? And can we stop handing down sinecures like hereditary titles? In two years' time you'll be a centenarian. Can we please get back to what we actually do best, which in Ireland is the Arts and Music and Literature? Can we get the Greats of Creative Ireland to save the ship? Nepotism doesn't always guarantee genius. Musicals don't get conceived via committee. Single creatives come together in small teams and are let at it. I am of an age to remember when RTE pretty much WAS the television - the two were synonyms. In 2024 we are living in an exploded universe of smithereens. Smidir√≠n√≠, as Gaeilge. And while we're at it, can we find the headspace to actually reclaim more of the actual national tongue, Europe's oldest vernacular and home to the world's largest body of folklore (i.e. stories)? Get the Player in order double-quick. Remove the intrusive and chunky advertising trap. Internationalize the product - sell into the Anglosphere and all the other spheres. Do Story. Lovingly, Your Story Doctor Your prescription: 1. Fix Player. 2. Open the gates to the creatives. 3. Export the product. 4. Reward daring thinking. 5. Understand funding is not the issue - product is the issue. 6. Dub more films and shows as Gaeilge (ridiculously cheap no-brainer).\n\nOFCOM - one rule for some, another for others? \"The UK government wants to extend media regulator Ofcom‚Äôs remit to include oversight of BBC online services and to toughen up the way the BBC deals with complaints, citing concerns about impartiality in news coverage and responsiveness to complaints.\" In an interview with Sky News, Culture Secretary said; \"the perception of audiences of the public are important.\" However, she failed to give examples of bias from the BBC. Achor Kay Burley pointed out, perception of bias, vs actual bias are two totally different things. It's the argument of opinion vs fact. Ofcom is being given more powers to scrutinise the BBC. However, it's important to note that OFCOM rules apply across the board to all UK news broadcasters, not just public broadcasters. So, any news channels broadcasting news on television, is subject to OFCOM rules. And yet, it seems that the weight of OFCOM is being applied disproportionately on the BBC, and not on others, specifically, GB News, which has been subject to multiple complaints, but as yet no sanction. In a world of disinformation, made more difficult and complicated by the rise #deepfakes and malignant #aitechnology the role of trusted, impartial news has never been more important. Holding the powerful to account, without fear or favour is the mantra of impartial news. That's the role that public broadcasters play, including the BBC. #newsmedia #publicmedia #impartiality #ofcom #broadcastmedia"
