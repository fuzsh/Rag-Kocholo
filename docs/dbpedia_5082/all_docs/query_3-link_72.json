        "text": "Book: Tom Lake\n\nAuthor: Ann Patchett\n\nEdition: Audible\n\nListening to Meryl Streep sharing the story of Tom Lake, I was in the cherry orchard with her and her daughters, I was on stage with her as she rehearsed, and by the lake as she swam. I was completely transported. I wonder if I would have enjoyed the book half as much had I read it on my own. I think I would have, though I highly recommend the audio book!\n\nTom Lake is a gentle read, sharing the joy and extraordinary in the ordinary of being together on a family cherry farm in Michigan. The novel is story telling at its best, reminding the reader that everyone has a story to share, as ordinary as their life may seem.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this reflection of a mother thinking back to her early 20s. She is seeing her life through years of wisdom and seeing her story internalized by her daughters who are now in their 20s. There are so many touch points for a book discussion, especially for readers who are beyond their youth and are reflecting upon a memorable summer or year or time in their life. It’s also a lovely novel for anyone who needs a reminder to appreciate the daily moments.\n\nThis is one of my longest leader book guides. Perhaps because I connected to Tom Lake in many ways. Perhaps because I so enjoy listening to Meryl Streep and thoroughly enjoy Ann Patchett’s perspective as a writer. In any case, take the parts below that are best suited for your book group, or suggest individuals scan through the topics themselves to see where your conversation might best begin. Who knows where it will conclude.\n\nI also really enjoy the breadth of Patchett’s writing. You may want to consider Commonwealth for your book group, which still feels current.\n\nNote that this book leader guide contains spoilers. It is meant to be read after the book as there are several reveals. This is not a review and is meant to be read after you have read the book. I hope that this guide helps book discussion leaders create a space where individuals can make connections between Tom Lake and their lives.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nThe play Our Town\n\nThe reader certainly doesn’t need to know Our Town to enjoy Tom Lake. Although, not surprisingly, Tom Lake mirrors Our Town in many ways. Both stories share the everyday lives of the characters. Both directly address the audience and field questions, one through the stage manager, the other through Lara interacting with her daughters. Contrary to the Emily of Our Town, Lara does not take for granted her life, her children, her husband, her cherry farm, her experiences. Both the novel and the play focus on the importance of being present for the small moments and the here and now in life, which makes a great discussion topic for a book group.\n\nThere are plenty of synopses of Our Town, that may be worth briefly reviewing before a book discussion. The Thornton Wilder Society shares a plot summary and a critical analysis along with many resources (though that’s a whole other discussion for your book group :).\n\nMichigan cherries\n\nThe cherry blossoms of Traverse City are beautiful. There is an even a CherryBlossom Tour. You can see a few photos from 2022 of the Cherry Blossoms of Traverse City.\n\nInterlochen Public Radio shared The future of cherries in northern Michigan? Maybe not so sour. The journalist talks about the difficulty of cherry production in Michigan and how cherry farmers are adapting, including planting sweet cherries. One interview is with a fourth generation fruit grower who faced the challenge of having a great crop and then with the abundance of fruit, the price dropped substantially just as Lara described. He switched from tart cherries to fresh sweet cherries— sound familiar? The journalist speaks with Isaiah Wunsch who is a farmer that Patchett worked with in her research for the novel. And she speaks with the operations manager of Wunsch Farms.\n\nRead about Wunsch farms in a short spotlight from the University of Michigan.\n\nInterviews\n\nI recommend watching Ann Patchett on stage with Erin Anderson Whiting through the National Writers Series (NWS). Whiting is a friend of Patchett’s and knows a lot about cherry farms and theater. The National Writers Series is a nonprofit organization focused on author conversations in the Traverse City, Michigan area, where the novel is set. Much of the interview is a wonderful conversation between two friends on stage, without a specific focus on Tom Lake. In any case, I recommend this particular interview.\n\nIn this personable conversation, Ann Patchett offers a synopsis of Our Town, shares some of the themes she wove into the book, reads from the novel, shares her joy of fact-finding enthusiastically and speaks about how it came about the Meryl Streep read for the audio book. Personally I was thrilled to hear how wonderful Meryl Streep is in person.\n\nThe three daughters’ names are all from Patchett’s life. She knew the oldest daughter needed to be Emily. Then she chose Nell for the youngest daughter as an homage to Nell Gifford who founded Giffords Circus in the Cotswolds, where Patchett had a profoundly moving experience with art. Patchett’s first editor lived on a farm and, it turns out, had three daughters named Emily, Maisie and Nell. So Patchett said that the middle daughter needed to be named Maisie.\n\nOne of my favorite moments from this conversation is how Patchett describes the difference between commercial fiction and literary fiction (and she likes commercial novels— she isn’t dissing them!)\n\n“Literary fiction is like being in love and I bring half and you bring half and it exists in a space between us. And that’s why one person can read a novel and love it and one person can read a novel and hate it because it has to do with the chemistry that you and the book make and can take forward. Nothing would make me happier than to know that you think about those people and you imagine their outcomes.”\n\nCharacters\n\nSummer 1988\n\nLara Kenison— actress playing Emily in Our Town in a summer production at Tom Lake, 24 years old\n\nJoe Nelson— director of Our Town at Tom Lake\n\nPeter Duke—famous actor and boyfriend of Lara’s at Tom Lake, known as Duke, 28 years old\n\nPalace—dancer and understudy for Lara as Emily\n\nSebastian Duke— Duke’s brother and tennis player\n\nAlbert Long, known by his TV character Uncle Wallace— stage manager in Our Town at Tom Lake\n\nGene— assistant director of Our Town\n\nLee — understudy for stage manager in Our Town\n\nMaisie— Joe’s aunt and cherry farmer near Traverse city\n\nKen— Joe’s uncle and cherry farmer\n\nEric— executive director at Tom Lake, picks up Lara at airport\n\nCody— director of Fool for Love\n\nKat— costume designer at Tom Lake\n\nSummer 2020 at Three Sisters Orchard\n\nEmily— Lara and Joe’s oldest daughter, 26 years old\n\nMaisie— Lara and Joe’s middle daughter, 24 years old\n\nNell— Lara and Joe’s youngest daughter, 22 years old\n\nBenny Holzapfel— Lara and Joe’s neighbor and Emily’s boyfriend\n\nAdditional Characters\n\nVeronica— Lara's best friend in high school\n\nJimmy George Haywood— student teacher; George in Our Town in New Hampshire\n\nBill Ripley— director who casts Emily for a movie while she’s a junior in college\n\nNell— Lara’s grandmother\n\nCharlie— executive at Lara’s Broadway audition who tells her about Tom Lake\n\nTime Periods\n\n1985: Lara is a junior in college, goes to Los Angeles to be in a film thanks to Bill Ripley\n\n1988: Lara talks to Bill and tries out for Our Town on Broadway with Spalding Gray (doesn’t get part). The director tells her Tom Lake is looking for an Emily\n\nSummer 1988: summer production of Our Town at Tom Lake near Traverse City, Lara is 24\n\nFollowing Summer 1988: Lara returns to live with her grandmother until her grandmother dies\n\nSometime after 1988: Lara starts a costuming job in New York and Lara visits Duke in a rehab\n\nSometime after that: Joe reconnects with Lara in New York City\n\nby 1995: Lara and Joe own the cherry farm\n\n1993: Emily born\n\n1995: Maisie born\n\nOct 1997: Duke visits farm\n\n1997: Nell born\n\nSummer 2020: Lara, now 57, is living with her husband Joe, and 3 daughters at the Nelson cherry farm in Michigan.\n\nDiscussion Topics\n\nFamily farms\n\nIn the book, none of the Holzapfel’s older children are interested in the farm. And of Lara and Joe’s family, only Emily is interested in taking on the farm.\n\nThere are many challenges to a family farm continuing, some of which are discussed in the novel. There may be no family to continue to work. The land may have a higher value if developed into other uses. For fruit farms in particular, it is difficult to maintain trees or vines for years and replanting and growing to fruit-bearing stage can be a years-long effort.\n\nJoe tells Lara when she first visits the farm in 1988,\n\n“‘Land gets sold when people die and the kids refuse to come home and take it over. Otherwise you keep the land.’”\n\nHow familiar are you with family farms? Do you own one? Work on them? Visit them to pick strawberries in the spring, cherries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and peaches in summer, apples and pears in the fall? What do you value about family farms personally and for your community? Do you think family farms are worth preserving from a greater community perspective? How does your community, your state, your country encourage or discourage the continuation of family farming? What family you want to see changed?\n\nTheater\n\nClearly the novel revolves around theater. Yet as someone who knows little about theater beyond appreciating performances as an audience member, I in no way found the theater aspects of the novel hard to decipher.\n\nI appreciated the quote, which comes up several times,\n\n“We were on the way up or on the way out.” Chapter 7, Chapter 17, Chapter 19\n\nThe quote is in reference to the actors at Tom Lake, and how regional theater can be a stepping stone in either direction.\n\nLater Lara reflects on the difference between Uncle Wallace and Joe as stage managers,\n\n“They were as different as chalk and cheese, but they were both right for the part. I stood so close to them. That’s what I remember. The audience is far away, but the people you are acting with are so close, you can smell them.” Chapter 15\n\nWhat has been your experience with theater? How do you interact with theater, summer stock in the U.S. or the similar open-air theatre in Britain, or any seasonal theater in your country? Did you participate in theater at one time in your life or as an on-going profession or interest? Are you or were you an actor? A tech? A director? A producer? An attendee? What is compelling for you about theater?\n\n“The remaining few who had managed to hold on to their believe that Emily couldn’t be Black, were destroyed by the third act. We all were. When she went back to her mother’s kitchen, I cried. Like I had never seen the play before. I cried because she was that good. I cried because I would never play Emily again. I cried because I had loved that world so much.” Chapter 16\n\nWhat shows have you felt most deeply? Laughed hardest, cried silently, felt the emotion created most strongly? What created the connections between you and the experiences shared through the performers? What emotions were pulled out by what was happening on the stage and how it connected with you in your moment? How do connect with theater in ways similar to reading? How is it different for you from reading?\n\nPaths our lives take\n\nMuch of the storytelling includes Lara explaining to her daughters that she is so happy with the path her life has taken, that she wouldn’t wish for an alternative life as an actor, or a marriage to a famous actor.\n\nShe compares getting over Duke, to a change of heart over a summer carnival saying to her daughter,\n\n“‘You don’t have to,’ I tell my daughter, ‘you want to. You wake up one day and you don’t want the carnival anymore. In fact you can’t even believe you did that.” Chapter 6\n\nDo you remember a moment from your past that seemed highly charged, emotional, or critical at the time, and now, looking back, the energy has somehow dissipated? Where did the energy go? Simply departed with the passage of time? New wisdom? Contentment with how things worked out?\n\nAnd later Lara reflects on how she is her past, her present and her future\n\n“The beauty and the suffering are equally true. Our Town taught me that. I had memorized the lessons before I understood what they meant. No matter how many years ago I had stopped playing Emily, she is still here. All of Grover’s Corner is in me.” Chapter 18\n\nWhen have you reflected on the path you have taken with your life? What were the turning points? In what ways is your past part of you?\n\nReflecting on youth\n\nLara thinks back about her younger years,\n\n“I liked the lightness of my life. The feeling that I could leave tomorrow and go where they needed me— New York, Michigan. Not counting my winter clothes which were still in the closet of my grandmother’s spare room, my worldly possessions amounted to the contents of these two bags more or less.” chapter 6\n\nDid you have a time in your life when you felt this lightness? In the past? Now? How do you compare those feelings of being light and untethered to feelings you may have had with more roots in place?\n\n“‘But I am telling you Hazel, it doesn’t feel anything like regret. It feels like I just missed getting hit by a train.” Chapter 7\n\nAre there moments in your past which at one time felt like regret and later felt like “just missed getting hit by a train”? How does the passage of time change your perspective as you grow older and look back on your youth?\n\nLara’s view as a 57-year old mother is contrasted with Emily’s emotional 20-something outburst of her confusion over being a bride and running a farm. Emily is in tears with her family when discussing her marriage, and running the farm.\n\n“‘I don’t know how to do this… I don’t know how to do any of it.’” Chapter 8\n\nAre there moments you might contrast in your life with one being more-emotion and one being more staid? For instance your younger self and your older self, or yourself now and a younger person in your life each reacting with different levels of intensity to a similar situation? How does recollecting or seeing the youthful reaction feel to you? How does the older reaction feel?\n\nLara recognizes that she becomes an adult that summer at Tom Lake, getting to Michigan and this new job all on her own, sleeping with Duke by her own choice.\n\nDo you have such a transition point in your life that you can point to?\n\nReflecting on Tom Lake as a utopia, Lara thinks,\n\n“We ate and drank and slept our art. Pounded our art into the mattress. Actors and dancers, designers and techs of different races from different states and wildly different backgrounds strolled through a utopia of cherry trees when they weren’t being worked to a nub. Men held hands with men. No one gave Sebastian and Palace a thought. Michigan, who knew?” Chapter 10\n\nWas it a utopia? Or was it only in Lara’s memory? Is there a difference?\n\nIn telling the story, Lara reflects,\n\n“The number of things I’d failed to grasp back then was as limitless as the stars in the night sky.” Chapter 9\n\nLara shares so many moments of reflecting back on her youth as she tells the story to her daughters. She is both in the past as a 24-year old and in the present as a 57-year old mother telling a story of her youth. How do your reflections of your youth change the story or change how you see people or make you feel about your reactions or actions at the time? How do those feelings shape your current actions?\n\nLove\n\nIn the NWS interview, Patchett shares that one of the primary elements of the book is a focus on love and the difference between youthful love and married love. She talks about how the scorching love of Lara’s life at 24 is very different from the love of her marriage, and how her own loves from those times are very different.\n\n“They are both extremely wonderful… almost entirely disconnected from one another.”\n\nIf you have experienced both youthful love and love in later years, how do you compare and contrast the two? Do (or did) the anxieties of youth shape your love of that time period? Do you experience more contentment in love later in life? What are elements that you may miss from youthful love? What do you appreciate from love later in life?\n\nBeing a parent and mother-daughter relationships\n\nThe relationships between Lara and each of her daughters are on full display in the snippets of conversation and togetherness that are shared, from when they were younger to their life during the pandemic.\n\nLara thinks,\n\n“When I go down the hall and find Maisie and Nell asleep in their twin beds, I see them both as they are and as they were, grown women and little girls.” Chapter 3\n\nAre you a parent who has had this experience? What feelings does seeing your grown children both as the little kids they were and the adults they have become evoke for you? If you have children who have left home, how do continue to stay in the moment and keep your relationship with them focused in the present?\n\nIn telling her story Lara keeps many of the specifics of her and Duke’s relationship to herself. How much do you share with your children? How much did your parents share with you? What is best kept private and not shared? Why did you chose to keep those things private?\n\nResponding to Nell thinking that someone would have to do something horrible in order to achieve an important goal Lara thinks,\n\n“I wish I could tell her ‘oh my darling, that’s all behind us now, those are very old stories about things that don’t happen any more.’ But instead I take her in my arms. I want to tell her she will never be hurt, that everything will be fair and that I will always, always be there to protect her.” Chapter 5\n\nWhen have you had to comfort an adult child or as an adult been comforted by your parents? Did it feel natural and supportive? When have you had to let an adult child stumble or see the darkness and the wrongness with the world? How did that feel to make the transition from how you comforted a small child to how you comforted an adult child? Or if you recall from your own childhood and young adult days, how did comforting from adults in your life feel different as you grew older?\n\nParenting is as a theme is common in many of my leader book guides. A few you may want to explore are Our Missing Hearts, Flight Behavior , Red at the Bone and Behold the Dreamers.\n\nSecret versus private\n\nIn response to the fact that a “secret” is revealed at the end of the book, Patchett says in her NWS conversation that it’s not a secret, it’s private. She describes the difference as\n\n“A secret is something that you try actively to keep from other people and something that is private is just your own.\"\n\nFor instance, Lara choses not to share everything with her daughters in her retelling of the story. From her sexual encounters to meeting Duke again later in life and what transpired from that encounter, some things Lara holds in her own heart and doesn’t share with anybody. Joe does the same,\n\n“Joe has thrown the switch that takes the train from love to the precipitous decline in crop prices. He has seen to it that when he leaves we will be contemplating cherries, and not our courtship, which is fair because the courtship is ours alone.” Chapter 19\n\nWhat do you keep private that you don’t think of as secrets? What are the things that you keep for yourself? How is having that space and autonomy important in your life? Where have you felt that autonomy encroached upon?\n\nMany books offer the reader a chance to mull over what it means to hold something secret and how secrets impact our lives. Some of the guides I’ve written that delve into the secrets in our lives including Hello Beautiful, Americanah, The Island of Missing Trees and Little Fires Everywhere.\n\nExtraordinary in the ordinary\n\nAt the heart Tom Lake is being present in the precious present. Time and again Lara as a mother, reflects on the joy she sees in her daily life on the farm,\n\n“Nor do I pretend that all of us being together doesn’t fill me with joy. I understand that joy is inappropriate these days and still we feel what we feel.” Chapter 2\n\nShe points out the beauty of the cherry farm from when she first saw it to now farming it, the joy of swimming the lake, the delight the cherry trees in bloom.\n\nWhere do you take the time to reflect upon or absorb the present? When are you most present? When are you most appreciative of the present? Has there been a time in your life when you’ve thought, “when I finish this, then I’ll start living” or “once this is over then I can do what I want to do”? What distracts you from being present? What are strategies you have for immersing yourself in the present? What is extraordinary in your day-to-day life? How do you celebrate the ordinary in your life?\n\nSharing your story\n\nHave you ever shared your story, even a piece of it as Lara shares with her children, with anyone? Verbally? In print? How did it feel? What was the impact? What did you learn about yourself in the telling? What did you learn about your audience?\n\n“‘I wouldn’t have asked [about her parents meeting] because I thought I knew it already’, Nell says, ‘and I had every part wrong.’” Chapter 19\n\nIn particular, have you shared your story, or a piece of it, with your children? Did you share it in one go? In bits and pieces? Have you ever heard it echoed back to you? What parts were most imprinted in your children’s memory? What parts did they change or make up?\n\nFinding hope in the future\n\nEmily shares about having children,\n\n“‘I don’t know if I want them, but I’m sure I’m not going to have them.’” chapter 10.\n\nAre you considering whether or not to have children? Are your children thinking through their choices around having children? How have these choice changed in the past decades, centuries? How does the change in choices feel for you?\n\nEmily says, “‘It’s bad enough having to worry about what is going to happen to the farm. I can’t imagine worrying about what would happen to our kids.’” Chapter 11\n\nWhat about you? Do you think about the path the world will take for your children and descendants? How do you hold the horrors of the world as you move through life? Where do you find hope? Where do you create hope?\n\nMemory\n\nLara is telling her story as she remembers it. Some parts are crystal clear, others less so, and some people she has forgotten.\n\n\"There is no explaining this simple truth about life. You will forget, much of it. The painful things you were certain you'd never be able to let go, now you're not entirely sure when they happened. While the thrilling parts, the heart stopping joys, splintered and scattered and became something else. Memories are then replaced by different joys and larger sorrows and unbelievably those things get knocked aside as well.” Chapter 8.\n\nDoes this ring true with you? Are there painful things you can no longer clearly remember? Thrilling parts that faded over time? Sorrows that got knocked aside? What are the parts of your life that have stayed most vividly with you? How accurately do you think you recollect those moments?\n\n“The part of this story in which I lived in the cottage and sewed for Cat, the part where Our Town was still in performances and Fool for Love was still in rehearsal and Duke was still in my bed, couldn’t have lasted much more than a week, 8 or 9 days at most. But they were long days, summer stock days. For me it may as well have been a geological age.” Chapter 17\n\nTime stretches and contracts substantially in my memory. How about in yours? Are there times that as you recall them seem so short, though they may have been years, and moments that seem to stretch longer in your memory?\n\n“I miss the four of us and the places we were together— the lake, the tennis court, the car.” Chapter 17\n\nMissing comes in so many forms from a dull ache to a painful presence to a calm recollection — longing, regretting, reminiscing. As you recall times passed, are there moments you miss? How do you miss those moments similarly or differently? What about a time period you’re recollecting do you miss? A feeling? An ability? A relationship?\n\nOther quotes\n\n“Or maybe they are children looking at their parents and so our lives began when they began. And everything else they colored in with fat crayons any way they wanted.” Chapter 12\n\n“All those moments in life we had missed and would never get back again.” Chapter 16\n\n“Veronica had such a small part in the story and still I loved her more than everyone at Tom Lake put together. She stayed with me after the rest of them had faded. Maybe because we remember the people we hurt so much more clearly than the people that hurt us.” Chapter 17"
