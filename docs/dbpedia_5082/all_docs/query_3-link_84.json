        "text": "Moms deserve a day off more than anybody. After all, they work 24/7, 365 days a year! That’s why it’s worth going big on Mother’s Day.\n\nAlmost a third of people are now keen to give their moms the gift of an experience on Mother’s Day rather than more “stuff” — and last year, consumers spent an average of $274 per person treating their moms.\n\nAs an event organizer, that puts you in an amazing position to give your community a unique Mother’s Day experience to share with the most important women in their lives.\n\nTo help you get started, we’ve created this guide with 60 Mother’s Day event ideas, including ways to promote your Mother’s Day experiences using Eventbrite’s advanced features.\n\nMother’s Day Event Ideas by Category\n\nFun things to do on Mother’s Day\n\nCrafty Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nCommunity Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nResident Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nVirtual Mother’s Day event ideas for special experiences\n\nMother’s Day online workshop ideas\n\nMother’s Day event promotion ideas\n\nFun things to do on Mother’s Day\n\nMoms definitely deserve the chance to let their hair down and have a bit of fun — here’s a few of our favorite ideas for fun Mother’s Day activities to get you thinking.\n\n1. Cooking or baking masterclass\n\nA cooking or baking demonstration gives guests the chance to learn new recipes and sample the results.\n\nAlthough this works great as a series of intimate events, you can scale your cooking class up to be a larger event, like Firefly Cellars did. Their Mother’s Day French Crepe Class includes wine pairings to complement each dish that guests create with their moms.\n\nTo scale this idea up for an even larger event, you could host a virtual class or set up a microphone and broadcast it onto some monitors to accommodate a big group in your event space.\n\n2. Afternoon tea\n\nAfternoon tea is the perfect treat. But sometimes the day calls for wine. If the moms you’re catering to prefer some bubbly, why not serve your sandwiches and scones with a glass of prosecco instead? And don’t forget to entertain with your “tea.”\n\nHire an outdoor event space and take guests out into the wonderful May weather. That’s what Averill House Vineyard has lined up for their series of Mother’s Day High Tea Brunch & Wine Pairing events — and it looks like the perfect setting to sip the day away.\n\nThey even hired a classical flutist, which is the perfect way to add a bit of class to your event.\n\n3. Mother’s Day brunch\n\nWhat’s better than brunch? The bottomless kind, of course!\n\nFor some tasty inspiration, look no further than Made U Look and their upcoming Mother’s Day Brunch. Not only have they got the ultimate breakfast menu, but they’re also extending the celebration by hosting a Pre-Mother’s Day Brunch on Saturday, May 11.\n\nThey’re also offering a “surprise” for moms included in the ticket price, which is a great extra flourish for your guests.\n\n4. Pop-up shops and displays\n\nPopo-up shops are fun things to do on Mother’s Day and they allow businesses to tempt your guests by showcasing their products. Local shops selling clothes, jewelry, and crafts all work well here.\n\nWant to see how it’s done the right way? Check out organizer Kimberly Evans and her upcoming Mother’s Day Pop up Shop. This market includes a cool range of stalls so your guests can bring their moms for a great day out and support local artisans by purchasing amazing, hand-made gifts.\n\n5. Wine tasting\n\nWine-tasting events lend themselves to Mother’s Day. After all, who needs a blissful sip of wine more than a mom?\n\nDifferentiate your Mother’s Day tasting by applying unique event themes. For example, Royal Rabbit Vineyards has turned their Mother’s Day event into a magical fairy-themed day with live music, dancers, acrobats, and plenty of fantasy ambiance.\n\n6. Cocktail class\n\nDust off those cocktail shakers! Invite a mixologist to teach your guests the latest cocktail recipes.\n\nThe world of cocktails is pretty big, so you might want your event to focus on one spirit. That’s what Prohibition Liquor Co did for their upcoming Gin Cocktail-Making Class. With a lesson from master mixologists, tasty drinks, and antipasti all included — that’s how you make any gin-loving mom happy.\n\n7. Mother’s Day networking event\n\nMoms are absolute bosses in every sense of the word, and some prefer a business-themed day to a spa treatment. There are lots of moms who’d love to meet up to network and develop new skills.\n\nFor lessons in best practice, check out the amazing Mother’s Day “Brunch & Learn” event that Tiana Von Johnson organized last year. With a business masterclass, breakout sessions, and a tasty brunch, this is a very different way to spend Mother’s Day — and we’re here for it.\n\n8. Mother’s Day comedy show\n\nMoms always need a laugh — which is why a comedy show is the perfect Mother’s Day event for a crowd of any size.\n\nTo keep guests on the edge of their seats, turn your event into an edgy improv show like Unexpected Productions Improv is staging as part of their Mother’s Day show.\n\nThey’re even using a discount promo code for moms. That’s super easy to do with an event management tool like Eventbrite. Here’s how it’s done:\n\n9. Pamper session\n\nMoms deserve some downtime, and who doesn’t enjoy some pampering?\n\nWork with local businesses to provide a day of pampering treats such as pedicures, manicures, or massages.\n\nThat’s what Ambitious Diva ENT is doing for their 5th Annual Mother’s Day Glam Party. But they’ve leveled up their pamper session by bringing in extras like complimentary hair styling, and henna tattoos — and a portion of the event’s proceeds go toward a charitable cause.\n\n10. Mother’s Day cultural showcase\n\nCelebrate different cultures and their unique ways of honoring motherhood.\n\nA cool way to celebrate might be to focus your showcase on foods from around the world. For example, you could host a 10-course meal where each dish treats your guests to a different cuisine.\n\nAlternatively, you could focus on just one culture like ARTCORE’s upcoming Celtic Cultural Showcase.\n\nEither way, this is a fun thing to do on Mother’s Day and a wonderful way to celebrate the diversity of motherhood and can provide an educational and immersive experience for attendees of all ages.\n\n11. Dance workshop or festival\n\nTeach moms some new moves (and have a few giggles) with the help of an instructor and a local venue.\n\nFor inspiration, look at the Afrobeat Mother’s Day Dance Class that Yahvybe organized last year. With an amazing soundtrack, the chance to learn cool moves, and strawberries and champagne to top it all off, this is the perfect way to treat moms with moves.\n\n12. Mother’s Day karaoke\n\nAllow moms to take center stage — whether in person or at home. An old-fashioned sing-along is a crowd-pleaser, too.\n\nYou can even combine your karaoke session with something artsy. For example, Paint Your Blessings: Events fused karaoke with a painting class, bottomless drinks, and a seafood brunch with their Mother’s Day Sing Karaoke N’ Paint event.\n\n13. Mother’s Day cruise\n\nWant to give moms the ultimate lazy day? A slow cruise down the river is just the ticket.\n\nYou could make your Mother’s Day cruise relaxing and educational — or turn it into a party boat. Just choose somewhere with stunning views!\n\nCapital Events Marketing Group offers moms the chance to embrace the NYC skyline while enjoying NYC’s hottest DJs at their Mother’s Day Yacht Party (Hip-Hop Vs Caribbean) event.\n\n14. Art exhibition\n\nOne work of art can speak 1,000 words — so why not host an art exhibition focusing on parenthood or caregiving?\n\nCreate a themed exhibition, or combine your Mother’s Day art show with an afternoon tea like ARTclectic Art Gallery did. Vintage China, traditional English tea, and works of some of the area’s best artists? Any culture-loving mom will love that.\n\n15. Mother’s Day boat tour\n\nWe’re not talking about a booze cruise or a party boat this time. Instead, host a boating event that’s a bit more active to give moms the chance to explore the local waters at their own pace.\n\nFor example, take a look at Stacked Adventures and their upcoming Mother’s Day Kayaking Tour event. This guided tour of the area places moms alongside their kids in double kayaks for a day away from the hustle and bustle — and moms won’t need a babysitter!\n\nCrafty Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nCreate something together for a special experience. Here are some ideas to help you get crafty for your next Mother’s Day event.\n\n16. Flower market\n\nEverything is in bloom in May, which makes a flower market the perfect option for a large-scale event around Mother’s Day.\n\nImmerse moms and families in the sights and smells of beautiful plants like the Bloom Flower and Home Market does. Their markets combine flower stalls with market vendors, amazing food, and tasty drinks — everything a nature-loving mom deserves.\n\n17. Gardening masterclass\n\nOrganize a gardening masterclass with an expert on hand or at a garden center to give moms useful tips and advice. Try collaborating with a local bar or restaurant to add amazing catering to your gardening event.\n\nThat’s what Parsons North Brewing Company did for their Mother’s Day Container Gardening Workshop. By combining the gardening know-how of Lemon Garden Designs and the tasty beer of Parsons North, this was one gardening event that had it all.\n\n18. Pottery class\n\nPottery painting is a lovely way to involve the whole family, and the ticket price can include decorating an item of pottery that guests can take home.\n\nWant to get people chatting and loosen up guests at your pottery class? Add cocktails.\n\nRound Rock Community Clay’s Moms, Mimosas, and Mud – Mother’s Day Pottery Date went the extra mile with some amazing drinks for their crafty class — while offering kids crafts to entertain the little ones.\n\n19. Mother’s Day art and craft fair\n\nHost a grand art and craft fair for local artists and craftsmen to showcase their work. Include workshops on different art forms, live art demonstrations, and spaces for children to create Mother’s Day gifts.\n\nThis can be a blend of a cultural and shopping experience for the whole family. For lessons in best practice, take a look at Meridian Vendor Club’s upcoming Falcon Mother’s Day Craft Fair. With vendor stalls from small businesses, unique crafts, and food trucks, this craft fair has got it all.\n\n20. Sip and paint class\n\nNeed we say more? Sip-and-paint classes make the perfect Mother’s Day event for those moms and families who like to get creative and have some fun while enjoying the finer things.\n\nTo see how it’s done the right way, check out Queen aka Queen of Hearts and their 2nd Annual Mother’s Day Sip & Paint Party. There’s wine, art, jazz, and activities for the entire family. What’s not to love?\n\n21. Soap or candle-making workshop\n\nFor something a bit more unusual, why not host a soap-making workshop or a candle-making workshop event?\n\nAlthough these types of artisan workshops can be great intimate experiences, they also lend themselves to large-scale events. For example, set up multiple candle-dipping stations, pair your event with entertainment or grazing tables — or turn your workshop into a series of multiple sessions.\n\nYou could even frame your event around a certain type of product like Uplift Creative Center has done for their Goat Milk Soap Making Workshop. That’s a great way to open your guests up to new scents and experiences.\n\n22. Get crafty with nature\n\nMother’s Day is the perfect time to let moms indulge their senses and reconnect with nature — which is why a nature crafting session makes for a great event.\n\nFor inspiration, take a look at SWAY and their unique Mother’s Day Moss Art Class in 2023.\n\nThis fun activity idea is the perfect way to give maternal figures and their families a chance to look differently at nature and create memorable works of art. After all, how many of us can say we’ve wandered off into the woods to collect moss and create a beautiful work of art?\n\nCommunity Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nAlthough Mother’s Day can be a really personal experience for some families, it’s also a great opportunity to get out there and celebrate moms with families and friends across your community.\n\nBring the entire community together with these fun Mother’s Day community event ideas designed to help your guests mingle and celebrate together.\n\n23. Mother’s Day picnic\n\nA Mother’s Day picnic is the perfect large-scale event if you’ve got access to ample outdoor event space and some beautiful May weather.\n\nJazz up your Mother’s Day picnic theme to make it a more immersive event like Will Taylor’s Mother’s Day Musical Sunset Picnic with LIVE Strings event. Not only is there a sunset picnic with live music, but the line-up also includes a guided nature walk and meditation session.\n\n24. Film screening\n\nWatching a movie together is a bonding experience. Screen a movie that resonates with your audience. Delectable snacks are not optional.\n\nTo scale up your Mother’s Day movie night, take a page out of Adventure Cinema’s playbook. Their cinema screenings are hosted in quirky outdoor locations. You could even sweeten the deal by offering free admission for moms.\n\n25. Mother’s Day farmers market\n\nWhether indoors or outdoors, farmers markets can be a great way to showcase local produce and for moms to pick up a few treats. Make sure there are lots of tasty snacks to sample, too.\n\nIf you need ideas for this one, take a look at Kaylee’s Candy Boutique. Their upcoming Mother’s Day Market includes a wide range of local produce and artisan gifts that any mom would love. Reach out to local businesses to support your community.\n\n26. Yappy hour\n\nMoms often view their dogs as family members. Celebrate pet parents in the community by hosting a dog-friendly event like Wallis Annenberg PetSpace and their Yappy Hour event.\n\nThe doggy event included a play area for the pups, doggy cocktails, food trucks, beer for the fur dog mums, and music from a live DJ to satisfy both species.\n\n27. Mother’s Day fun run\n\nPick a local charity and organize a short fun run. Event attendees can help raise money for charity while enjoying themselves and exercising.\n\nFor example, take a look at Pajaro Valley Shelter Services and their 40th Annual Mother’s Day Run & Walk. This annual event gives moms and their families a chance to socialize and do something healthy and active. It also doubles as a charity fundraiser.\n\n28. Nature hike\n\nOrganize a nature walk in a garden or park that families can enjoy together. That’s what The Land Trust for Santa Barbara County did last year.\n\nTheir Special Mother’s Day Hike was a breathtaking three-mile walk along an amazing coastline — giving guests the chance to spend quality time with their moms and enjoy the scenery along the way. Just make sure you’ve got a walking tour guide on hand to keep everyone safe and share interesting facts about the places you visit.\n\n29. Charity fashion show\n\nRaise funds for a relevant local charity with a fashion show celebrating moms. You could even theme it — for example, set up a maternity wear show aimed at moms-to-be.\n\nYour fashion show could also double as a fundraiser. That’s what Veteran 501c3 QW-Global Maternal Wellness is doing for their upcoming 2nd Annual Charity: Mother’s Day Gala and Fashion event.\n\nThey’ve even added raffle prizes, a silent auction, and a book signing into the mix to jam-pack this event with fun things to do on Mother’s Day.\n\n30. Mother’s Day culinary carnival\n\nOrganize a large-scale culinary event featuring cooking demonstrations, food tastings, and competitions by renowned chefs. This can include a variety of cuisines and interactive cooking workshops for moms and families.\n\nFor example, check out the Mother’s Day Market & Food Festival that Openair Company set up. With a wide range of food vendors, tasty beer, and extra gifts for moms, this looks like it was the perfect treat for culinary aficionados.\n\n31. Mother’s Day music festival\n\nA small music festival is a brilliant way to connect moms with their loved ones. Organize a day-long line-up of music on Mother’s Day, or set up a string of concerts at smaller venues throughout the day and turn it into a musical pub crawl.\n\nWant to pack the house? Integrate catering moms will love, as TOP NOTCH EVENTS did for their Mother’s Mother’s Day Weekend Music Festival. You had us at “free crawfish.”\n\n32. Mother’s Day paddle\n\nWild swimming has increased a lot in popularity over the last few years, which is why Mother’s Day is the ideal time to organize a large-scale water event.\n\nYou can even branch out with paddleboards and kayaks to create a unique flotilla experience guests will always remember. That’s what Hard Labor Creek State Park did for their last Mother’s Day Twilight Paddle, and it sounds like the perfect way to end a bustling day celebrating moms.\n\nResident Mother’s Day event ideas\n\nWant to create an event that caters to moms living in assisted living facilities? These event ideas are easy and fun to replicate in retirement communities so that you can bring the fun to moms who may not be able to travel far.\n\n33. Mother’s Day glow-up\n\nA glow-up pampering session is a great way to liven things up at resident facilities and bring a smile to moms’ faces.\n\nYou could even up the ante and turn it into a Make-up and Sip-inspired event like Sass N ‘ Class Salon of beauty did last year. With gifts, brunch, and champagne, this is an amazing way to give moms a little pampering.\n\n34. Mother’s Day raffle\n\nOffer entertainment and prizes for your Mother’s Day event. This can generate excitement and encourage participation — and it’s something you can integrate with other event ideas to supercharge your Mother’s Day event.\n\nThat’s what The Historic Sharpe House is doing for their Sharpe House Mother’s Day Garden Party Tea 2024. They’re boosting their garden party with a raffle filled with amazing prizes. Best of all, the proceeds will support a great cause.\n\n35. Mother’s Day jazz concert\n\nPut some pep in the steps of residents by organizing a Mother’s Day jazz concert. Jazz is an excellent music genre for those in assisted living, and it lends itself really well to large-scale events.\n\nIt’d also be cool to combine your jazz concert with fancy afternoon tea. That’s what Divine Delectables have got planned for their upcoming Mother’s Day Jazzy Tea Party — and between the live music, finger sandwiches, and relaxing ambiance, this looks like a great way to treat mothers of all ages.\n\n36. Mother’s Day carnival\n\nJust because moms are grownups doesn’t mean they don’t love a trip to the fun side! Organize a Mother’s Day carnival with circus-style performers, games, and prizes.\n\nTo see how carnivals are done for retirement communities, check out the Fall Carnival that The Mansions at Sandy Springs organized. With BBQ, ice cream, live entertainment, and garden games, this was the perfect way to add some fun factor.\n\n37. Ice cream bar\n\nIt’s easy to get everyone to connect over ice cream sundaes. Don’t forget to bring the toppings! You could also make it so moms eat free with each purchase.\n\nRenault Winery Resort is a great source of best practices in this department. Their Family Fun Night: Ice Cream Bar event last summer combined a movie night with a “Build Your Own Ice Cream Bar.” Best of all: Each ticket holder got their own chef’s hat on arrival.\n\n38. Games tournament\n\nHosting a large-scale games tournament is an inclusive way to get lots of moms and their families involved in fun activities.\n\nTo build on this idea and make it even more exciting, you can take inspiration from what Elan Shari Event Design & Management, LLC has done for their Mother’s Day Brunch & Bingo 2024 event.\n\nNot only do they have bingo on the cards, but also raffles, a bottomless brunch buffet, and mimosas on arrival! Plus, they announced their main prize before the event to help increase ticket sales.\n\n39. Mobile spa experience\n\nMother’s Day is the perfect time to bring the spa directly to your guests. Transform a retirement community into a spa for the day or set up a mobile spa in the parking lot that moms can visit for a bit of pampering.\n\nIf you need inspiration, take note of The Wright Aide by Adult Health NP PLLC and The Wright Aide Mobile Boutique Spa event. With a cocktail hour, wellness services, and a champagne toast, this is a great format to replicate for a Mother’s Day event.\n\n40. Mother’s Day scavenger hunt\n\nPlan a scavenger hunt around a residential care home for families to share fun experiences with moms and grandmothers without having to stray far from home.\n\nNeed ideas? Check out New York Social Network’s The Scavenger Hunt At MoMA event. They set up a unique, timed scavenger hunt — giving guests the chance to explore, appreciate new works of art, and meet new people.\n\nVirtual Mother’s Day event ideas for special experiences\n\nYou can adapt loads of in-person events to accommodate virtual guests. Here are some Mother’s Day event ideas designed to bring together moms and families from all over the world — no matter where they log in from.\n\n41. Virtual cooking class\n\nA cooking class is a good opportunity to learn new techniques, even for folks who are already wizards in the kitchen.\n\nSome creators offer cooking classes focused on making treats to give as a gift. The free virtual cooking classes hosted by Homemade Events teach guests how to prepare diverse meals, including crispy chicken and avocado alfredo, or turkey chili with skillet cornbread.\n\n42. Virtual yoga celebration\n\nMoms deserve a chance to relax, and yoga class is a great way to harness some inner peace. Set up a virtual yoga celebration with a yoga instructor offering a special relaxation section geared and tailored for moms.\n\nWant to add a cool visual element to your virtual yoga session? Live stream from a beautiful location like Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance does for its Virtual Yoga with DuShaun sessions. Attendees get a guided virtual yoga session in the amazing surroundings of botanical gardens — sign us up!\n\n43. Virtual Mother’s Day bingo\n\nBingo is a great option for Mother’s Day events. But you can take that idea and make it virtual if you want to cater to moms and families who need to connect remotely.\n\nThat’s what Pittsburgh Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta did for their No, It’s Not Your Average Bingo Party event.

Start promoting early\n\nSome people plan pretty far in advance for their Mother’s Day event, so you need to start promoting your event early. As part of your early promotion, you could also offer an early bird discount to kick start sales and generate a bit of cash to cover your planning costs.\n\nThat means setting up an event page for potential attendees to discover your event and buy tickets — which is where an event registration software partner like Eventbrite can get the ball rolling.\n\nWith Eventbrite, you can create a custom page for your event months in advance. You can also utilize Eventbrite’s email functionality to create and dispatch email announcements to previous customers that your Mother’s Day tickets are on sale.\n\n57. Use advanced targeting\n\nTo optimize your marketing, make sure your event reaches your target audience. That’s where event marketing features like advanced targeting save you time and money.\n\nWith Eventbrite you can create paid social media campaigns based on profile demographics or interests. You can even retarget sales leads. This is a feature that shows your event ads to people who’ve visited your event page but not bought tickets.\n\n58. Collaborate with social influencers\n\nIf your event targets a niche community or theme, it’s worth reaching out to social influencers to expand your reach by leveraging their huge audiences.\n\nBut teaming with influencers can also build a sense of authenticity around your event and give it an external stamp of approval that can sway potential attendees.\n\n59. Kick off ticket sales with early-bird offers\n\nA great way to boost sales in the run-up to your event is to create special early-bird discounts. Special discounts will often motivate leads with lower-priced tickets — and creating discount codes is simple using a platform like Eventbrite.\n\nHere’s how it’s done:\n\n60. A/B test your content\n\nAlways A/B test your content to maximize engagement. With Eventbrite, you can create an ad set with two different types of copy or graphics, and then send both sets to control groups to see which ad performs better.\n\nThis ultimately saves you time and money because you can put more money behind sponsored posts that you know are going to hit home with your target audience.\n\nStart planning your next Mother’s Day event idea\n\nWhen it comes to Mother’s Day, the events you organize should be built around your event goals, your audience, and your strengths — but no matter what type of vibe you’re trying to create, remember who your event is for.\n\nThe moms in our lives deserve the gift of an amazing experience. As event organizers, we get to make those experiences come alive.\n\nJust make sure you team up with an events management platform like Eventbrite that’ll get your Mother’s Day celebration over the finish line and create a memorable experience for moms and their families."
