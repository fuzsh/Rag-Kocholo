        "text": "Memoir and autobiography are often used synonymously. These two nonfiction genres are very similar, so it’s easy to get them confused. They’re both the story of someone’s life written by that person, and they both use the pronouns “I” and “me” since they’re written in the first person. They’re both true stories from the author’s life. But there are some key differences.\n\nA memoir is a nonfiction narrative in which the author shares their memories from a specific time period or reflects upon a string of themed occurrences throughout their life. An autobiography is a factual and historical account of one’s entire life from beginning to end.\n\nIf you’ve struggled to understand the difference between autobiography and memoir, you’ve come to the right place to learn more.\n\nWhat is a memoir?\n\nMemoir comes from the French word mémoire, which means memory. A memoir is a nonfiction but subjective collection of narratives in which the author remembers experiences, emotions, and events from a certain period in their life. Memoirs focus on intimately conveying their perception of these memories in a way that is emotionally truthful but isn’t fact-checked.\n\nHow do you pronounce memoir?\n\nMemoir can seem like a tricky word to pronounce, but it’s actually quite simple. The beginning is “mem” just like “memory.” The end is essentially an elongated pronunciation of “war.” Put together phonetically, it sounds like “MEM-waar.” You can consult an online dictionary to hear an audio recording of this word being pronounced out loud.\n\nWhat is memoir as a literary genre?\n\nA memoir is a literary nonfiction genre in which the author recounts their experiences during a significant period of their life. They might focus on their childhood and family, a spiritual journey, their experience with fame, a big adventure, or many different but thematically related events in a collection of personal essays. These days, some memoirs are even graphic novels illustrated by the author.\n\nHow is a memoir structured?\n\nThere isn’t one right way to structure a memoir. Memoir authors can experiment with how they order the events they’re recounting, whether they write in the past or present tense, use a linear narrative, or divide their memoir into sections.\n\nWhile a memoir is a flexible genre, it should include these things:\n\nA specific theme\n\nSomething the author overcame\n\nFirst-person writing style\n\nSupporting details and events from the past and the people who were present\n\nStorytelling basics like plot and setting\n\nHonesty\n\nMemoirs typically fall into one of these structures:\n\nFlashbacks: The author jumps back and forth between the past and present to provide backstory\n\nChronological: The author writes about their experiences in the order in which they happened.\n\nThemed: The author includes only memories that fall into one specific theme.\n\nOvercoming: The author focuses on one struggle and how it affected their life.\n\nWhat is an autobiography?\n\nAn autobiography is a nonfiction account of someone’s life that they wrote themselves. Usually, an autobiography covers the author’s entire life up to the point of writing in chronological order and is sometimes (though not always) drafted in the later years of the author’s life. The events recounted in autobiographies are factual and fact-checked. They’re often used as resources by historians.\n\nMany autobiographies are written by people who have some claim to fame who write about their journey to becoming famous. The author might be a politician, change-maker, business figure, professional athlete, or celebrity. But anyone can write an autobiography.\n\nThe etymology of the word autobiography is made up of three Greek root words: “auto,” meaning self; “bio,” meaning life; and “graph” meaning write.\n\nWhat is a biography?\n\nA biography is also a nonfiction account of someone’s life, but it’s written by someone else. Biographies are typically based on interviews, letters, personal journals, photos, reference books, newspapers, and digital media. The word biography has the same roots as autobiography but without the “auto” prefix.\n\nWhat is an autobiography as a literary genre?\n\nAutobiographies fit into the nonfiction genre. They are retrospective narratives that tell the story of the majority of an author’s life. Autobiographies are factual and chronological. Authors in this genre tend to focus on providing context for their life and personal development within a historical and cultural framework.\n\nHow is an autobiography structured?\n\nTraditionally, autobiographies have been written chronologically. But nowadays, there are two common structures for autobiographies. Each of these structures follows traditional storytelling principles. These two structures are standard across the publishing industry.\n\nMost autobiographies follow a chronological structure like this:\n\nFoundation: childhood experiences, family members, community, home life, school, friendships, family traditions\n\nAdversity: pivotal moments that lead to life achievements\n\nConclusion: lessons learned after overcoming or embracing adversity\n\nSome autobiographies follow a structure that the writer Joseph Campbell called “the hero’s journey,” which includes these elements:\n\nAdversity: a life crisis or pivotal moment that was a catalyst for the life they lead today\n\nFoundation: childhood experiences, family traditions, community, school, friendship, and home life\n\nConclusion: how they overcame adversity and the lessons they learned along the way\n\n“The hero’s journey” format can be used to grab a reader’s attention. It provokes curiosity and a desire for resolution in the reader that compels them to keep reading.\n\nMemoir vs. autobiography examples\n\nMemoirists selectively share the stories and emotions that contribute to their chosen theme or time period.
