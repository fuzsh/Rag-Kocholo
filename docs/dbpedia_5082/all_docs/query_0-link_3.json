On Rotten Tomatoes, the first series holds an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from seven critics.[12] Reviewers were somewhat critical towards the first episode: in a review for The Guardian, Sam Wollaston compared it to the BBC Three sitcom Him & Her in terms of its writing, and slightly criticized the show, saying Him & Her was \"ruder, more visceral, sexier and – vital for a comedy – funnier.\" On his most positive note, he mentioned, \"this is a bit more grown-up, (more BBC2 than 3),\" and gave the series a positive review, saying \"it shares the same subtlety and warmth.\" He praised the cast performances, saying \"the characters are believable [and] three-dimensional ones,\" and gave recognition in particular to both Lesley Manville and Lisa McGrillis.[15] Ceri Radford of The Daily Telegraph rated the series 3 out of 5, and commented that episode one was \"soothing and enjoyable, but lacks real bite.\"\n\nSeries two received a more positive reception overall and holds a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 17 reviews. The website's Critical Consensus reads that \"Mum's patient pacing and unflinching embrace of agonizingly awkward family dynamics can make it a difficult watch, but Lesley Manville and Peter Mullan's heartfelt and keenly observed performances make it a highly rewarding experience, too.\"[13] In a review for the website There Ought to Be Clowns, Ian Foster expressed delight in the series' return, stating, \"A hugely successful return for Stefan Golaszewski’s BBC sitcom Mum, with world-beater Lesley Manville in brilliant form once again.\"[16] Following the series finale, Sarah Highes of The Guardian praised the series and mentioned that \"few programmes celebrate humanity, in all its complexity, so clearly\" and that \"this is a comedy that understands that every aspect of life is worth cherishing.\"[17]\n\nThe third and final series holds a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on nine reviews.[14] The Guardian's Jack Seale rated the series 5 out of 5 and commented on the show's acclaimed final episode, calling it, \"magnificent TV that will put sunshine in your heart\" and stating that the show is \"guaranteed to make you cry four times every episode, the final series of the Lesley Manville sitcom miraculously turns tiny gestures into epic romance.\"[18] Gabriel Tate of The Daily Telegraph gave the show a 5 out of 5 rating and stated, \"a perfect end to a perfect show–bring on the Baftas\".[19]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee Result Ref. 2016 Royal Television Society Craft & Design Awards Director – Comedy Drama/Situation Comedy Richard Laxton Nominated [20] 2017 British Academy Television Award Best Female Comedy Performance Lesley Manville Nominated [21] British Academy Television Craft Awards Best Writer – Comedy Stefan Golaszewski Won [22] Broadcasting Press Guild Awards Best Comedy Mum Won [23] Royal Television Society Programme Awards Writer – Comedy Stefan Golaszewski Nominated [24] 2019 British Academy Television Awards Best Scripted Comedy Mum Nominated [25] Best Female Comedy Performance Lesley Manville Nominated [26] Best Male Comedy Performance Peter Mullan Nominated [27] British Academy Television Craft Awards Best Writer – Comedy Stefan Golaszewski Nominated [28] Royal Television Society Programme Awards Comedy Performance – Female Lesley Manville Won [29] Writer – Comedy Stefan Golaszewski Won [29] 2020 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards Best Comedy Mum Nominated [30]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries Release date # Discs Rating Ref.
