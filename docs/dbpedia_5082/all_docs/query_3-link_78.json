        "text": "HERE IS THE myth of how the punk singer and poet Patti Smith vanished for 16 years: In 1979, at the age of 32, she said goodbye to her band, the public and New York for a life with the man who would soon be her husband, the guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith, in his hometown of Detroit. Soon after, they moved to the suburbs — the very place punks were supposed to be trying to escape, the turf of those enemies, Mom and Dad — and bought a three-bedroom Tudor house in St. Clair Shores, where they raised two children; where they became Mom and Dad. This idyll didn’t last. Fred Smith died young, of heart failure, in 1994 and, after a period of mourning, Patti Smith returned to New York and the music scene. Of her time away from her career, she told The Times in 1995, “There’s no job harder than being a wife and a mother.”\n\nThis was hardly a provocative statement. If anything, it belonged to the language of platitudes and affirmations, far removed from punk’s mutinous liturgy. Some took issue with such sentiments coming from an iconoclast like Smith. The American journalist and punk archivist Legs McNeil, writing in Vice in 2016, reported that, after her husband’s death, Smith rebuffed his request for an interview with similar words, saying, “I’m a wife and a mother.” Two decades later, the phrase still haunted him: “She liberated millions of women around the world, she did whatever she wanted — spit, cursed, [had sex]. … And then she turned her back on all of that, ’cause now she’s a ‘wife and a mother!’”\n\nHow we cling to our binaries, these eternal either/ors. That there might be a connection between liberated sex and getting pregnant seems not to have occurred to McNeil. (In the United States, access to contraception became legal nationwide only in 1965, after the Supreme Court ruling Griswold v. Connecticut — for unmarried people, only in 1972, after Eisenstadt v. Baird — and abortion in 1973, after Roe v. Wade; when Roe was overturned last year, legal scholars warned that Griswold and Eisenstadt, similarly based on the contested idea of a constitutional right to privacy, could also be under threat.) McNeil’s piece ends on a conciliatory, self-deprecating note: “I began to get over myself,” he writes. But this accusation, equating the embrace of motherhood with not just a rejection of art but a betrayal of it, will be grimly familiar to women artists who grapple with how to sustain their creative lives after having children and to justify the choices and compromises they make — because whatever those choices are, they are wrong.\n\nCertainly it’s a sign of progress that society no longer presumes a woman will or should give up her career when she has a child. Nevertheless, for women artists, motherhood — venerated in theory, belittled in practice — is still seen, by others and often themselves, as an obstacle, if not the end. When the Bajan pop star Rihanna revealed that she was pregnant in early 2022, she was immediately asked whether this would derail plans for her next album. Never mind that she hadn’t released an album since 2016 and was busy running her beauty and lingerie empires, the profits of which have made her a billionaire. Yes, there would be more music, she insisted to “Entertainment Tonight,” adding, “My fans would kill me if they waited this long for a lullaby,” as if to dispel fears that she might lose her edge and become just another starry-eyed, baby-addled mom. Her child was born that spring; no album dropped. This year, as the mother of a 9-month-old, she revealed that she was pregnant again. Her second child was born in August. Her fans wait still.\n\n“She turned her back on all that”: The accusation stings precisely because we fear in it the pang of truth. In the 1971 essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” the American art historian Linda Nochlin argued that a woman artist must “have a good strong streak of rebellion in her” to avoid “submitting to the socially approved role of wife and mother, the only role to which every social institution consigns her automatically.” If artists are defined in part as refusers — insurrectionists against received notions of how a person should be — what happens when a woman artist takes on this most traditional and idealized of roles, the one that, historically, you’ve been expected to devote yourself to entirely? What if you find that’s what you want?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
