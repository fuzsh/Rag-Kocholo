        "text": "I’m guessing that there are others like me, who have struggled to find a “genre name” that fits what they’ve written.\n\nSome genre labels seem pretty straightforward. Fantasy. Mystery. Memoir. “Young Adult” is defined by its audience, “western” by its setting, “historical fiction” by its era. Yet there’s a huge chunk of contemporary fiction, like mine, that doesn’t meet any of those criteria and thus seems to fall, by default, into the awkward category of “women’s fiction.”\n\nWomen’s fiction is, in fact, the box I check when I fill out questionnaires or apply for awards, yet I’ve never liked the term and wish I didn’t have to use it. Nonetheless, I’ve accepted the label, not wanting to cause trouble or appear hypocritical, especially when (happily) accepting awards in that very category. No one can have it both ways—criticizing a label, except when it benefits them.\n\nI still don’t want to be hypocritical, but I think it’s time to raise the question. Publisher’s Marketplace already has, recently dropping women’s fiction as a genre, and even the Women’s Fiction Writers Association is planning to address the question as it nears its tenth anniversary.\n\nThis raises another question, of course—whether we need a new word for the same category, or whether the category itself is flawed.\n\nFirst of all, what does the term women’s fiction actually mean?\n\nThose who embrace the term will say that women’s fiction is defined by the nature of its narrative arc—that is, by a story line that depicts an internal, emotional journey—rather than by the gender of the author, protagonist, or intended audience. According to the Women’s Fiction Writers Association:\n\n“the driving force of women’s fiction is the protagonist’s journey toward a more fulfilled self.”\n\nPeriod. Thus, a work of women’s fiction can—in theory—be written by a man, have a man as its central character, and be read chiefly by men.\n\nOkay. If we set the notion of gender aside, as part of the definition, and define the genre of women’s fiction by the protagonist’s internal arc— it’s clear enough, I guess, although it seems like an awfully broad definition, encompassing much of our great literature.\n\nBut, again, what does the word women have to do with it?\n\nIt does seem odd to use gender in the label for something that purports to have nothing to do with gender! It’s confusing and misleading—especially since gendered labels are being replaced, more and more, by gender-neutral ones. Stewardess has become flight attendant; waitress has become server; and mailman has become letter carrier. That’s seems respectful and right.\n\nMoreover, there’s no corresponding “men’s fiction”—nor is there “women’s art” or “women’s music.” It seems reasonable to ask why writers are the only ones who use a gendered term, and whether we should continue to do so.\n\nMy discomfort with the notion of women’s fiction label has grown stronger over the years, even though my latest novel, like its predecessors, has been deemed a work of women’s fiction. Yet it could just as easily be categorized by its setting, theme, or the fact that it’s a love story.\n\nAha, you may be thinking—that’s because it’s not women’s fiction; it’s a romance!\n\nBut it’s not. According to the Romance Writers of America:\n\n“Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.”\n\n“Emotionally satisfying” is a subjective term, since what satisfies one reader may leave another reader annoyed, puzzled, or just plain angry. Remember Bradley Cooper as Pat Solitano in Silver Linings Playbook, throwing A Farewell to Arms out the window because the ending made him furious?\n\nIt’s the “optimistic ending” that defines a romance novel—in other words, a “happy ending.” No matter how many obstacles, arguments, misunderstandings, wrong choices, and estrangements take place during the course of the story, the lovers are together at the end. Without revealing details of the plot, I’ll simply say that my new book does not meet the criteria for a romance.\n\nOkay. Maybe it’s “literary fiction?”\n\n“Literary” is an elusive word, defined as often by what it is not than by what it is. According to Reedsy:\n\n“Literary fiction is a category of novels that emphasize style, character, and theme over plot. Literary fiction is often defined in contrast to genre fiction and commercial fiction, which involve certain tropes and expectations for the storyline; literary fiction has no such plot-based hallmarks.”\n\nIn other words, literary fiction is not based on plot. It “emphasizes” (a vague word) style, character and theme. But those emphases are not unique to literary fiction. Humor certainly emphasizes style; fantasy, thrillers, and westerns make use of specific kinds of characters. And don’t great works of literature still have terrific plots?\n\nReedsy tells us that literary fiction is considered to be a “prestige” category, but “literary fiction is a broad and diverse genre, so it’s pretty difficult to track down an exact definition.”\n\nWell, that doesn’t help.\n\nHow about “upmarket fiction,” then? Per Reedsy, again:\n\n“Upmarket fiction is a hybrid of literary and commercial fiction. The term refers to titles with crossover appeal: books that address universal, elevated themes while remaining thematically and stylistically accessible to the general public.”\n\nMaster Class offers a similar definition:\n\n“Upmarket fiction is a subgenre of fiction books that incorporates elements of page-turning mainstream fiction, while still showcasing the more nuanced prose and complex character development more often found in literary fiction. Upmarket fiction is often referred to as book club fiction as these books are often selected for book clubs.”\n\n“Book club fiction” is another term without a clear definition, other than books chosen by book clubs. That’s the crudest sort of tautology—and besides, book clubs read all sorts of books, including nonfiction!\n\nIf you feel like you’re spinning in circles—me too. I was ready to resign myself to the gendered label I dislike so much, simply because there was none better. And then, to my surprise and delight, I found a genre that fit my book. I discovered that I’d written a “literary romance.”\n\nAt least, according to the New York Times. No, my book hasn’t been reviewed by the Times, but it does meet all the criteria for a “literary romance,” as identified by Dan Saltzstein in his analysis of 125 years of Times book reviews.\n\nA “literary romance” differs from a “romance” because it has more nuance and ambiguity. In fact, few of the novels summarized in this curated collection of “Literary Romance Novels” would meet the definition or a “romance” offered by the Romance Writers of America.\n\nRather, the stories cited in this essay are filled with destiny, passion, tragedy, sacrifice, heartbreak, and lives changed forever—most of the elements on Dan Saltzstein’s list. A well-defined genre, in other words, yet one I’d never heard of.\n\nHere are the nine core features, gleaned from Saltzstein’s perusal of reviews, that constitute a “great literary romance:”\n\na couple … who are “dynamically matched” … with discord or conflict … that leads to suffering … and often to tragedy, including death … or sacrifice … in a story of passion … grounded in the “real” world … with a plot twist that we never saw coming\n\nIt turned out that I’d ticked every one of Saltzstein’s boxes with my latest novel, without knowing anything about this list of criteria! My story belonged somewhere, after all.\n\nMy satisfaction was short-lived, however. As I soon discovered, “literary romance” isn’t on any of the genre lists I have to choose from when I fill out those questionnaires and applications.\n\nBack to square one. Again, I’m stuck with a default label that makes me deeply uncomfortable—because my work is not horror, thriller, fantasy, rom-com, historical fiction, mystery, memoir.\n\nMy solution, for the moment, is to say that I write “upmarket contemporary fiction.”\n\nYet my questions remain.\n\nWhy can’t stories set in the present and framed around the search for self, intimacy, fulfillment—with plots and character arcs—simply be called contemporary fiction, the same way that books set in the past are “simply” called historical fiction?\n\nWhy are we still using a label based on a bifurcation of literature according to a limited and outdated notion of gender—while also insisting that the label doesn’t have anything to do with the gender of the writer, reader, or protagonist? Shouldn’t the name of a category reflect its meaning? And if it doesn’t, shouldn’t we change the name?\n\nOr is the term women’s fiction useful, nonetheless, allowing women writers to claim an important place in the literary landscape? Would abandoning the term mean the loss of an identity we’ve worked hard to attain?"
