But no one gets to actually be in the room with me except for my family. … And for me that was important to show, no, this is who I am.”\n\nBelow, watch the trailer and keep reading for more on how to watch Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up online with and without cable.\n\nHow to Watch Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up: Premiere Date, Episode Release Schedule\n\nGypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up premieres on Lifetime on Monday, June 3 at 9 p.m. ET/PT. The first season spans eight episodes, which will be released weekly on Mondays.

Dee Dee Blanchard had forced her daughter to pretend for years that she was suffering from serious illnesses, including leukemia and muscular dystrophy. She was released on parole from Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center on Dec. 28, 2023, after serving 85 percent of her original sentence.\n\nBlanchard now lives in Louisiana with her ex-fiancé, Ken Urker (whom she met while in prison), after filing for divorce from husband Ryan Anderson (whom she also met and wed while incarcerated).\n\nGypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up TV Series Synopsis, Where to Watch Other Documentaries and Shows\n\nPer Lifetime, Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up “is an authentic, raw and revealing look at Gypsy’s new life on the outside. From the joyful moments as she is free to make her own decisions for the first time, to the challenges of navigating life and relationships while facing her past, including the abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother, and Gypsy’s own notoriety and fame. In this delayed-coming-of-age story, Gypsy must reconcile the pop-culture, celebrity version of herself while trying to forge her brand-new identity in a ‘normal’ world as wife, sister, daughter and most of all – a free woman.”\n\nBlanchard first shared her story in Lifetime’s six-episode docuseries, The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose, which is available to buy or rent on Apple TV, Prime Video and other video-on-demand platforms, or to stream online at Lifetime’s website or app by logging in with a traditional or streaming cable TV account (such as DirecTV, Frndly, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, Philo and Sling).\n\nHer story also inspired a Hulu limited original series, The Act, starring Joey King and Patricia Arquette; as well as countless other unofficial documentaries."
