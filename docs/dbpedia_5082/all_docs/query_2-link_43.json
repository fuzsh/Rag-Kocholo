        "text": "By Samantha Schoech\n\nSamantha Schoech is a writer focusing on gifts. She spends her time finding things that combine quality, beauty, usefulness, and delight.\n\nBased on an informal and non-standardized poll, all the moms we know just want a few hours to themselves on Mother’s Day, May 12 this year. So if you can make that happen, please do. Lovely and thoughtful tokens of appreciation are also welcome. You can never go wrong with reliable, gorgeous flowers, a tasty treat, or an excellent quotidian upgrade. We also have ideas for new moms and mother-in-laws, plus a round-up of under $50 finds and plenty of last-minute saves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nGorgeous garden book\n\nAn opulent cultural history of gardens offers lush inspiration from around the world for enthusiasts of all levels.\n\nBuying Options\n\nThe beautiful 350-page Garden: Exploring the Horticultural World is much more of an art book than a how-to. It covers gardens, and our relationship to them, from ancient Japan to English cottage and is chockablock with colorful photos, illustrations, art, sculptures, film stills, and textiles. Inspire those tending rambling acres, a single succulent, or just a flicker of interest with awe-inspiring depictions of gardens across time and geography.\n\nBetter bird feeder\n\nThis bird feeder can identify who or what is coming to feast and creates video clips and still photos, which can be shared with an active in-app community.\n\nThe Bird Buddy with Solar Roof has an integrated camera to capture 5MP photos and 720p videos of visiting birds (and squirrels). It also connects to the cloud wirelessly and uses AI to identify what species of birds are eating at the feeder (this can be helpful to determine which seeds attract which birds). If Mom is an avid birder or just a hobbyist, this gift will elevate the bird watching game to a whole new level and allow her to track avian visitors even when she’s not able to watch in real time. The attached solar panels eliminate the need to charge batteries and the Bird Buddy can be accessorized with mounts and additional feeding attachments like a suet-ball holder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBeautiful bowls\n\nThese classic mixing bowls have been made the same way since the 1950s in the last hand-pressed glass factory in the U.S.\n\nEverybody needs mixing bowls. Even if Mom isn’t whipping up batters on the regular, she can use these pretty, table-ready bowls for serving. The jade green Mosser Glass Mixing Bowls have a 50s farmstead vibe—they look like they’ve seen some biscuits in their day. The set includes a 20-, 40-, and 60-oz bowl, all made from thick, durable flint glass in Cambridge, Ohio in the last hand-pressed glass factory in the U.S. They’re sturdy and don’t chip easily, but they’re not safe for the microwave or dishwasher.\n\nColorful clogs\n\nAvailable in 13 bright colors, these Italian rubber clogs, which were originally made for medical workers, are favored by both surgeons and fashionistas for their comfort, durability, and style.\n\nBuying Options\n\nThese solid rubber clogs are made in Italy and intended for people who are on their feet all day. So, if Mom is a surgeon, nurse, chef or otherwise standing a lot, she’ll appreciate these cushy, slightly heeled clogs and their bumpy “massaging” food bed. But, even if she’s not those things, these fashion forward (yes, we said it) Calzuro Classic Clogs are perfect for gardening, clopping around the house, or otherwise looking fabulous. They’re fully washable and even autoclavable if she needs them to be sterile for some reason (surgery, perhaps?). We love the bright rainbow of available colors and the wide range of unisex sizes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFruit savior\n\nStore cellar-loving root veggies in the cool, dark ceramic bottom of this two-part fruit bowl, and fresh fruits in the bowl-shaped cork lid.\n\nThe chic and elegantly understated Emile Henry French Ceramic Fruit Storage Bowl picks up where the root cellar of yesteryear left off. The ceramic bottom is a dark, cool place perforated with a few air holes where potatoes, onions, and other alliums can be stored for maximum shelf life. The cork lid is a shallow fruit bowl meant to hold things like bananas and tomatoes that need more air and light. The cork absorbs moisture, keeping fruit fresh longer and staving off rot and fruit flies. This French-made innovation comes in two shapes and sizes, and eight colors.\n\nOne-of-a-kind doll\n\nThese simple wooden peg dolls are hand painted in North Carolina to resemble the subject of your choosing.\n\nBuying Options\n\nYour mom misses you. Make sure she always has a reminder of your existence nearby with a custom Wooden Beehive Custom Family Peg Doll in your image. Half classic Americana folk art, and half hilarious, these hand-painted dolls are made in North Carolina by artist Bee Webb. After you send her photos of your subject(s) via the Etsy website, she keeps in contact while creating your doll to make sure she gets the details you want and to show you her progress. The result is truly something unique and while the likeness is suggested through clothes, hair, and accessories like glasses, rather than precise features, the dolls bear enough of a resemblance to be recognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA bespoke care package\n\nBoxFox offers hundreds of fancy, well-curated items, but the cost can add up quickly.\n\nBuying Options\n\nYour mom spent a very long time caring for you; you can partially return the favor with a beautifully designed care package filled with things chosen just for her. Pick from a well-curated assortment of items that has some of the pleasure of an IRL shoppy-shop, with gifts that are beautiful, useful, and familiar—think books, tea, candles, socks, home items, and candy. If putting together your own box feels daunting, BoxFox, our pick for best care package, has a bunch of ready-to-ship care packages in themes varying from pizza night to a night of self care.\n\nArt supplies\n\nThese watercolor paints occupy a space somewhere between watercolors and gouache—they can flow, dilute, and mix like watercolors but have the opacity, pigment, and impressive vividness of acrylic paints.\n\nBuying Options\n\nWhether your mom is an accomplished painter or just someone with an artistic flair, this box of 36 luscious watercolor paints is a delight. After painting with cheap drugstore watercolors, staff writer Samantha Schoech, a dabbler at best, was gifted this set of Kuretake Watercolors and the difference in quality and pigmentation was dramatic. The set includes a range of classic and less common colors including metallic shades, a mixing tray, and two color charts. But note that it does not include a paintbrush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMom necklace\n\nThis subtle disk charm necklace has lots of options for metals, texture, and chains and can easily be added to.\n\nBuying Options\n\nThis delicate and stylish take on the classic letter disk necklace comes in either a smooth or hammered surface with your choice of three chain lengths and four finishes (including a solid 14K gold option for $240). In addition to your choice of letters and fonts, the disk charms are available with tiny stamped illustrations like hearts, skulls, or astrological signs. The GLDN Personalized Lor Necklace disks are a petite 9mm and additional charms can be added for under $25 each ($104 for solid 14k gold) if mom’s family happens to expand in the form of grandchildren (that is not a hint). If Mom likes more bling, we’re also enamored with the GLDN Aura Pendant Necklace, which uses birthstones instead of alphabet disks to represent loved ones.\n\nGames people play\n\nGet all the NYT favorite games like Wordle, Spelling Bee, and Connections in addition to daily crosswords straight to your phone or tablet.\n\nIt’s a well-known fact that once people start playing NYT Games, they tend to get a little, um, obsessed. Staff writer Samantha Scheoch can’t go to sleep at night until she’s reached “genius” on Spelling Bee. Her husband is more of a Wordle guy. Whether your mom is into crosswords, sudoku, or visual matching games, there’s a daily challenge for her on Games and a subscription ensures that she is never bored again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLuxurious moisture\n\nThis solid moisturizer bar smells great and promotes super-soft skin. But it’s a splurge.\n\nKate McLeod Daily Stone Solid Moisturizer comes as a smooth, stone-like ball that feels great in the hands. When its cocoa butter, sweet almond oil, and apricot kernel oil meet the heat of skin it softens and melts, creating a luxurious but not too greasy moisturizer for the whole body. It comes in three subtle scents (“herbal,” “fresh,” or “earthy”) and includes a reusable bamboo box. Refills run about $7 less than the complete kit.\n\nHiking socks\n\nThe best mix of comfort, durability, and cushioning in a versatile height.\n\nIf Mom is eager to get her daily steps in, pamper her with comfy, lightweight socks that keep feet from feeling sweaty during summer hikes, but nice and snug when it cools down. Our outdoors team put hiking socks through more than 160 miles of testing, and these highly breathable merino wool, nylon, and Lycra Darn Tough Light Hiker Socks were our top pick. And while they are among the most durable out there, the lifetime warranty means Mom can send back worn-out socks at any time, and the company will replace them for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBest buds\n\nOur favorite flower-delivery service due its easy ordering and stylish bouquets. You can choose from three arrangement sizes, and the company reliably delivers anywhere in the US.\n\nBuying Options\n\nBecause they’ll delight nearly everyone, flowers are the quintessential go-to Mother’s Day gift. They brighten up any room with their colors and scent, and their finite nature makes them feel all the more precious (though we do suggest some ways to keep them alive longer). Rather than presenting Mom with just one bouquet, though, why not extend her delight for six months or even a year? The UrbanStems, our pick for the best online flower-delivery service, offers subscriptions for classic, seasonal, or luxe arrangements that arrive weekly, twice monthly, or monthly. The first bouquet comes with a simple, clear glass vase.\n\nSunny disposition\n\nThese round sunglasses are comfortable to wear, sturdy, and affordable. Amazingly, they come with a lifetime warranty and money-back guarantee.\n\nBuying Options\n\nWho among us doesn’t need a stellar pair of backup shades? The Sungait’s adorable Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses are a great choice. They’re pretty much universally flattering: We tested 29 inexpensive pairs, and the Sungait glasses looked good on a variety of face shapes. Thanks to their keyhole nose bridge, these shades are comfortable to wear. Also, if they do break, they’re covered by a lifetime warranty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPaddle pack\n\nThis vintage-inspired neoprene bag has an exterior paddle pouch and a roomy interior, plus an adjustable shoulder strap and a fence hook.\n\nBuying Options\n\nIf your mom is part of the pickleball boom sweeping the country, consider giving her one of these vintage-inspired neoprene pickleball bags. The outer pocket can hold two paddles, and the generous interior has room for balls and sneakers, as well as a zip pouch to stash valuables. The bag also has a fence hook, so it stays off the ground during games. It will make your mom the envy of the pickleball court (provided she can find one).\n\nGood read\n\nIn this deeply personal and impeccably reported best-seller, New York Times writer Jessica Grose explores the impossible expectations of modern motherhood.\n\nBuying Options\n\nMotherhood is hard work, and our politics, policies, and culture often don’t make it any easier. In what’s quickly becoming a seminal book on modern motherhood in the US, New York Times writer Jessica Grose explores the unrealistic expectations embedded in the idea of the “perfect mother.” And she discusses how we might create something better for moms, kids, and families. That all may sound like a downer, but Grouse’s personal candor combined with her excellent reporting form a relatable rallying cry that makes moms feel seen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPut a ring on it\n\nFor this understated gold ring—available in 100% recycled yellow, white, and rose gold—choose the letters that are most meaningful to your mom.\n\nBuying Options\n\nWe love this petite custom letter ring for its simplicity, stackability, and the fact that it’s made from 100% recycled yellow, white, or rose gold. (The metal is sourced from old electronics and jewelry.) Choose any letters that are meaningful—perhaps your mom’s own initials? And if you’re not sure of her size, Automic will send her a sizer for free (though it may hint at her gift). The rings do get more expensive as you jump from one letter to two or three, and because it’s custom, the company will resize (shipping is on you) but won’t take it back.\n\nLemons for life\n\nGet fresh lemons from this pest-resistant, fast-growing mail-order tree, which can grow indoors or outdoors.\n\nA lemon tree is truly the gift that keeps on giving. Updates writer Arianna Flores, who surprised her own mom with a lemon tree, reports that its lemons are “more vibrant-tasting than any we’ve bought from a store.” She also said the tree has “helped facilitate the little conversations and laughs that bring my family closer together, which is the best gift any mother could ask for.” This fast-growing, pest-resistant Meyer Lemon Tree produces sweet-smelling blossoms and fruit, whether you grow it indoors in a planter or (depending on your plant hardiness zone) outdoors. If your tree arrives in less-than-healthy condition, there’s a 30-day guarantee. But in our experience, that hasn’t been a problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMama pajama\n\nThis polished set is one of our sleep team’s favorites. These PJs come with pants or shorts, with long or short sleeves, and in lots of colors.\n\nComfy enough for bedtime but way more stylish than an old T-shirt, these jersey pajamas from Eberjey are among the best we’ve tried. Our staff tester reports that after two years of using them, these PJs remain stretchy yet soft and still look fresh, with just a little wear on the fabric. They come in many pretty colors, and you can choose a top with short or long sleeves and either shorts or pants.\n\nCream of the crop\n\nIt’s not cheap, but our ice cream testers declare that this extra-creamy treat from Ohio is worth the price. The Top Sellers Collection includes the five most popular flavors.\n\nBuying Options\n\nFor a sweet treat that the mom in your life can share or enjoy solo (we’re not judging!), we love Jeni’s Best Sellers Collection. The woman-owned Ohio company makes some of the best ice cream we’ve tasted. And thanks to the miracle of dry ice, it ships without melting. This set features Jeni’s five most popular pints, including its rich Brown Butter Almond Brittle and sweet-tart Brambleberry Crisp. We think Jeni’s unique flavors and extra-creamy consistency justify the cost, plus shipping (which can range from $13 to $19, depending on where you’re sending it).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrame game\n\nOur favorite online framing service has a simple-to-use interface, offers dozens of traditional and artsy frame styles, and guarantees all of its work.\n\nBuying Options\n\nA beautiful custom frame is a great way to immortalize a family memory, whether it’s a recent vacation snap or a cherished child’s artwork that’s just too fabulous for the fridge. With Framebridge—our pick for the best online framing service—you can create a gift your mom will treasure. For a gift that ships the next day, upload your own photo to the site. Or, if you’ve got more time, mail in the art to be framed (the company will even mount heirlooms, such as baby baptism dresses, or collectibles like jerseys). The easy-to-use interface lets you choose your mat color and style, dimensions, and the frame itself. If you’re stumped, Framebridge offers free digital design recommendations. As a final touch, hang the finished product for her—each framed work comes with hardware and directions.\n\nA cuddly throw\n\nCozy up with this soft, cotton throw. It comes in 31 different colors and patterns, and is the perfect weight for springtime nestling.\n\nBuying Options\n\nTo cozy up during a couch nap or hunker down for movie night, every mom should have a few throw blankets on hand. Wirecutter tested dozens, and the luxurious, recycled cotton and polyester Seek and Swoon Zion Throw, while not a formal pick, is our choice for warm weather snuggling. This 50 x 60-inch throw pays homage to Zion National Park with a palette of warm desert colors and a geometric diamond design with a birdseye stitch on the back. Portland, Oregon’s Seek and Swoon makes the throw in many different colors and patterns so there’s something for every taste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCustomized mugs\n\nThese sturdy ceramic mugs can be customized to suit the special mom in your life.\n\nBuying Options\n\nCurate the cutest-ever cup collection for your mom with these customizable mugs from Uncommon Goods. There are lots of illustration templates—over 40 characters, plus several skin tone, hair color, and clothing choices—so you can capture your favorite mama’s likeness, plus those of her kids and partner, if she has one. (Note that the body templates don’t exactly offer a wide sizing representation.) Each ceramic mug holds 15 ounces of a favorite beverage, and (blessedly!) they’re also microwave- and dishwasher-safe.\n\nA well-earned night off\n\nGive the gift a night (or two) away with a Hotels.com gift card. You can choose the amount, it never expires, and the card is good for any hotel on the site, local or far-flung.\n\nBuying Options\n\nParenting is one of the hardest jobs on the planet, and there’s no PTO. Right this wrong by giving the mom in your life the gift of an evening to herself. Consider booking her a night at a wonderful nearby hotel, where someone else will handle the cooking and the cleaning—and where there will be no interruptions from beloved offspring. If you need a little help tracking down a good spot, try Google’s Hotels aggregator or, if you want to leave the planning up to her, try a gift card in the amount of your choice to Hotels.com. Both sites sift through options in your selected area and easily filter by categories such as star rating, price, and amenities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nHappy feet\n\nThese slippers are the most durable and supportive felted-wool slippers we tested. They’re warm, but they breathe well, so your feet don’t get sweaty.\n\nAt Wirecutter, we sing the praises of Glerups Slip-On With Leather Sole slippers often, and though we frequently test (and like) other brands, these are the ones we really feel passionate about. Danish mother Nanny Glerup originally made these slippers by hand, using wool from her own sheep and they still have that homemade, artisan feel. Because wool felt is more breathable than sheepskin, these wick away any wetness from your skin, help regulate temperature, and can be worn comfortably all year long. The leather sole is perfect for indoors, but Glerups also come with a thick rubber sole, making them durable enough for dog walks around the block or even grocery store runs.\n\nBest sleep mask\n\nLightweight and contoured, this mask fits comfortably and blocks light well for a wide variety of face shapes (note that it’s best for sitting upright, such as while you’re flying, or back-sleeping).\n\nBuying Options\n\nGive your mom the gift of a good night’s sleep (or an afternoon nap) with the Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask. Of all the sleep masks we tested, we found the Nidra to be the most comfortable and most efficient at blocking light. Its deep eyecups allow eyes to flutter during sleep, and the adjustable Velcro strap keeps it snug, no matter her noggin size. Some restless sleepers report slippage during the night, but most say this mask is so light and soft they forget they’re wearing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn elegant vessel\n\nThis sculptural earthenware jug is made in Portugal, using a slip-cast technique. It looks equally beautiful serving as a flower vase or a water vessel.\n\nThis angular jug looks as stunning on a counter displaying flowers as it does on a table holding water (it’s made with a food-safe glaze). Inspired by the still lives painted by Danish modernist Vilhelm Lundstrøm, the Raawii Strøm Jug will impress and delight any mom—even if she’s not an art buff—thanks to the seven poppy hues and sculptural shape. You can also help her build a collection of bowls, carafes, and vases in the same Raawii style.\n\nDorie Chevlen contributed reporting.
