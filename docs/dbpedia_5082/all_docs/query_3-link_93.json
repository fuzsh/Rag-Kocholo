        "text": "Key Information\n\nFocus\n\nFluency\n\nWhen To Use This Strategy\n\nDuring reading\n\nAppropriate Group Size\n\nWith small groups\n\nWhole class setting\n\nWhat is shared reading?\n\nShared reading is an interactive read aloud where the students join in or share the reading of a book while guided and supported by a teacher. The teacher explicitly models the skills of proficient readers, including reading with fluency and expression. The shared reading model often uses oversized books (referred to as big books) with enlarged print and illustrations.\n\nShared reading typically takes place in a whole-class or small-group setting. Shared reading is an interactive and collaborative experience. The teacher encourages active participation by asking questions, inviting predictions, and engaging students in discussions about the text. Texts can include a variety of genres, such as narrative stories, poems, informational texts, and more.\n\nWhy use shared reading?\n\nProvides emergent readers with necessary support.\n\nShared reading of predictable text can build sight word knowledge and reading fluency.\n\nProvides an opportunity for explicit instruction in phonics.\n\nProvides opportunities for building vocabulary and comprehension.\n\nSupports the development of oral language skills. Students have the opportunity to hear and use rich vocabulary, engage in discussions, and ask questions about the text.\n\nAllows students to enjoy materials that they may not be able to read on their own.\n\nEnsures that all students feel successful by providing support to the entire group.\n\nHow to use shared reading\n\nIntroduce the story by discussing the title, cover, and author/illustrator. Ask the students to make predictions regarding what they think the story might be about.\n\nRead the story aloud to the students using appropriate inflection and tone. Pause and ask the students to make predictions. Ask brief questions to determine students’ comprehension level.\n\nPoint to words as you read to help students follow along. This helps your students connect spoken words with printed text and reinforces concepts about print.\n\nConclude the reading by reserving time for reactions and comments. Ask questions about the story and relate the story to the students’ similar experiences. Ask the children to retell the story in their own words.\n\nRe-read the story and/or allow time for independent reading.\n\nConduct follow-up activities such as making crafts related to the story.\n\nWatch shared reading in first grade (whole class)\n\nWatch this first grade teacher as she gets her class involved in reading the big book In the Small, Small Pond. (Read to Be Ready Tennessee)\n\nWatch a teacher demonstration of shared reading\n\nStudents are exposed to new and interesting words during the shared reading of big books. (Balanced Literacy Diet: Putting Research into Practice in the Classroom)\n\nDifferentiate instruction\n\nFor second language learners, students of varying reading skill, and for younger learners\n\nTeachers may wish to have Spanish copies of the shared reading books.\n\nBooks can be kept in an area accessible to students for independent and familiar rereading by students.\n\nAsk students to write their own similar story using the same theme or sentence/language pattern of the book that has been shared.\n\nTeachers can use sentence strips and have students can retell or build the story by putting the strips in order.\n\nHave students write their predictions based upon what would happen next if the story were to continue.\n\nRelated resources\n\nUsing shared reading with ESL students (opens in a new window)\n\nHow to Implement Shared Reading in an Inclusive Classroom (opens in a new window)\n\nExtend the learning\n\nScience\n\nThis site offers several examples of how activities related to learning about science topics can be centered around the shared reading strategy. Downloads of several different poems are provided.

Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann\n\nChildren’s books to use with this strategy\n\nEmma is thrilled that her family is adopting a 4-year old boy. She soon learns, though, that being an older sister isn’t what she thought it would be at all. Gradually, Emma and Max start to feel like siblings as each child begins to adapt to their family’s new configuration.
