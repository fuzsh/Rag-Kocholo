Magnolia Network is owned by Chuck and Joanna Gaines, who are upstanding people, so I know whatever they produce will be high quality.\n\nListed are the most popular home reno TV shows. Do you have a favorite?\n\nLove It or List It\n\nHome Town\n\nFarm House Fixer\n\nChristina on the Coast\n\nRestored by the Fords\n\nRock the Block\n\nFirst-Time Fixer\n\nCelebrity IOU\n\nVan Go\n\nProperty Brothers\n\nFixer Upper\n\nFlip or Flop\n\nThis Old House\n\nClean (or mostly clean) TV Series On PBS, PBS Passport, Amazon PBS Masterpiece, BBC, or Britbox\n\nOur friends on the other side of the pond (Britain) have good taste in TV programs. Some of these shows are a little racy but not as much as American network programming. You still need to be on the lookout for junk because they slip it in occasionally.\n\nThese shows are for more adult audiences because they are period dramas, but older teens may find them enjoyable. As a bonus, many of these shows hop around on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple +, Roku, YouTube, or other streaming sites.\n\nI promise you will be addicted once you start watching!\n\nFather Brown\n\nVictoria\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nMr. Selfridge\n\nBleak House\n\nPoldark (borderline but it’s good)\n\nDownton Abbey (Soooo good!)\n\nCall the Midwife\n\nSister Boniface Mysteries\n\nAntiques Roadshow\n\nRick Steves’ Europe\n\nLark Rise to Candleford\n\nEndeavour\n\nPoirot\n\nSherlock\n\nAtlantic Crossing\n\nAround the World in 80 Days\n\nThe Paradise\n\nSanditon\n\nCranford\n\nUpstairs, Downstairs\n\nMiss Scarlet and the Duke (violence)\n\nLittle Women\n\nAll Creatures Great and Small (Sooo good!)\n\nChosen App/ YouTube\n\nThis is my FAVORITE series. It is sooo good. You must download The Chosen app and watch it on your phone or screen mirror it on your television.\n\nYou can also get it on YouTube or BYUtv. (Who knows when they will flag it and remove it from YouTube?) The Chosen is not inappropriate in any way; it is the Bible in living color. (There are a few unbiblical accounts.)\n\nDallas Jenkins (son of Jerry B. Jenkins, Left Behind Series) has gone to great lengths to ensure it is scriptural. For your information, start with Season 1, Episode 3, and then return to Episode 1. Episodes 1 and 2 will make more sense and not feel as slow.\n\nThe Chosen\n\nIs There a Christian Streaming Service?\n\nCheck out these alternative Christian streaming services, such as Netflix. They offer Christian-themed movies, clean TV shows, documentaries, Christian comedy, and children’s programming.\n\nThey all vary in cost and payment plans. Check out their websites for more information.\n\nHallmark Channel\n\nThis was my favorite channel, but they have strayed from traditional values. I still watch it, but I must be more vigilant about what comes across the screen.\n\nAngel Studios\n\nAngel Studios offers an extensive library of free, family-friendly streaming content, including its most famous show, The Chosen. There are also movies, documentaries, Christian comedies, and cartoons for kids.\n\nWhile it’s free, by “paying it forward,” you keep the content free for other viewers.\n\nBYUtv\n\nBYUtv is another free streaming service. Download the app, watch it on Frndly, or go to byutv.org. You must have Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, Roku, Android TV, Windows, Xbox One, iOS, or an Android.\n\nThere are lots of shows. I just found The Chosen on there. Yay!\n\nPureFlix/Great American\n\nPureFlix/Great American subscription service offers Christian movies, shows, comedy series, and children’s programming. This is the best Christian streaming app, in my opinion. The quality is superb. They own their studio, so they produce many of their programs.\n\nChristian Cinema\n\nThis is a no-commitment, no-subscription platform. You pay as you go. They offer faith-based content as well as mainstream media. The movie selections look similar to what is provided on PureFlix. There is programming for both kids and adults.\n\nFrndly TV\n\nFrndly TV is a subscription service that offers many channels with the choice of live TV, and On Demand. You can also record a bunch of shows. There are no contracts, and you can cancel at any time.\n\nThey have three Hallmark channels, UP TV, BYU, Great American, Ion, and Insp. They also have unlimited DVR. I have this service and love it!\n\nDove Channel\n\nThe Dove Channel offers old classics as well as new content. Some of it is free, but you must pay for the good stuff. There is both mainstream content for adults and children.\n\nUp Faith & Family\n\nUp is an uplifting faith and family paid streaming service, just like it says. It is included on the Frdly app if you don’t want to stream it alone. There are TV series, movies, and kids programming. Many familiar titles are offered.\n\nCrossFlix+\n\nCrossFlix+ is an inexpensive streaming platform that offers faith-based, family-friendly movies and children’s programming. It also allows churches to stream their services.\n\nTheir goal is to entertain and educate. They are available on Roku.\n\nFaithLifeTV\n\nFaithLife TV offers movies, documentaries, and children’s programming and constantly adds more. It has three tiers: free, pay-as-you-go, and subscription service.\n\nTween Xstream\n\nTween Xstream is a Christian streaming platform for tweens. It was recommended on a Christian parenting site I am on. It just started in September 2020.\n\nIt’s a streaming service from South Africa, so don’t be surprised when you see the cost on your bill; it will be in South African Rand (ZAR).\n\nYippee\n\nYipee is like Netflix, but for kids. It’s a subscription service that is slightly cheaper than Minno. They have many VeggieTales, YouTube-style videos, cartoons, Backyard Bible Camp, and other choices. I’m hearing good things from parents about this one.\n\nSmile of a Child\n\nThis 24-hour Christian children’s network offers animated and live-action faith-based programming for kids. Jay-Jay the Jet Plane, Veggie Tales, and other well-known programs are offered.\n\nYou can get it through Verizon, Roku, AT&T, Glorystar, TBN, or their website.\n\nRight Now Media Kids\n\nRight now, media caters to adults and children. It is a free service offered through many churches. Ask your church for a special link to access your account.\n\nVeggie Tales, Superbook, and the StoryKeepers are just a few of their offerings. Their catalog is impressive and worth checking out.\n\nMinno Kids\n\nThis is a Christian subscription streaming platform for young kids. They have 50+ episodes of just VeggieTales. They also offer Superbook, Owlegories, and much more. There are 140+ shows in all. It’s available on Apple, Google, Roku, and Amazon and can be accessed on your phone, tablet, TV, or computer.\n\nAnswers.TV\n\nAnswers.TV offers live streaming and on-demand video content, including nature shows, adventure programs, family-friendly educational videos, and science content based on a biblical worldview.\n\nThis streaming service partners with well-known programs such as the Creation Museum, Ark Encounter, and Answers in Genesis.\n\nBest Deals on Streaming Services\n\nDish Network\n\nSign up for the basic package, including locals, some news, Hallmark, HGTV, and a few other channels. You must talk to a Dish representative to get the basic package, especially if you are not a new customer. It is available. Push until you get it!\n\nYouTube TV\n\nYouTube TV gives you locals, sports channels, news channels, Ion, Hallmark, the Dove Channel, and HGTV, among other things. This may be the way to go if you like sports and clean TV shows.\n\nStream channels without cable /dish service\n\nIf you have an Apple box, you can stream whatever you want. Choose the channels you like without anyone forcing you to add channels you don’t need or want. You can finally have it your way!\n\nSpectrum\n\nSpectrum has different plans that offer local channels for a meager price. If that is all you want, it will get you the news and a few movies. It is great as a base if you are adding streaming services.\n\nRELATED: Family Bonding Activities: Fun Ways to Spend Time Together\n\nGet your FREE FAMILY SCHEDULE PRINTABLE and editable document. Make time for what is important!\n\nBest Profanity Filters For TV\n\nAfter much reading and research, I found these services to be the most optimal for families. They all have their pros and cons. It just depends on what services you are currently using and how they will specifically work for you.\n\nCheck out all of them periodically because they are constantly upgrading and changing what they can do. Prices change depending on the type of service you get.\n\nVidAngel– there are three ways to use the filters.
