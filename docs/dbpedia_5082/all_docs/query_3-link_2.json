        "text": "How do you write a theme?\n\nMore importantly, can you just not do it? Is that an option?\n\nNo. But I get it. Theme is tricky. Not only is the concept itself abstractâyouâre not even allowed to state your theme outright! You gotta dance around it and drop hints, like a Midwesterner trying to get past someone whoâs in their way.\n\nFortunately, I was born and raised in Missouri and am quite good at the âsay it without saying itâ routine. I also love talking about theme, and Iâm about to explain everything you need to know about selecting and writing your novelâs theme.\n\nBut first, letâs clarify what a theme is and why you cannot skip this part of the noveling process.\n\nWhat is a Theme?\n\nWhat is your novel trying to say?\n\nWhatever the answer is, thatâs your theme.\n\nYou should be able to write a theme in a single sentence that states a universal truth (according to you). Something like:\n\nHome is where your family is.\n\nLove is blind.\n\nMoney is power.\n\nA novel can have multiple themes. The Harry Potter series has loads of them, but I would argue that the central theme is:\n\nâLove is our greatest power.\n\nWhat makes me think this is a theme? Well, Harry is constantly finding power through his community, heâs literally protected by his motherâs love, andâ¦ what was that other hint?\n\nOh, right. Dumbledore is constantly flapping his gums about how love gives Harry an edge over Voldemort. Which it does.\n\nNow, thatâs all well and good. But do you really need a theme?\n\nOh my gosh, yes.\n\nThe theme is where your readers find meaning in your story. Itâs how they draw connections between your characterâs journey and their own experiences. Theme is the reason so many Millennials have âAlwaysâ and âUntil the very endâ tattoos.\n\nSo how do you harness this power? How do you write a theme?\n\nFirst you have to choose a theme.\n\nExplore Your Thematic Ideas\n\nWhat do you want to say with your novel?\n\nIf youâre not sure, this article on common themes can provide some helpful inspiration. Or you can try one of these two methods:\n\nAsk Your Story What It Wants to Say\n\nIf youâve already started developing your plot and characters, odds are good thereâs an accidental theme hidden within your vision.\n\nTake a look at what youâve already built and ask yourself:\n\nWhat is the protagonistâs internal conflict? What lesson are they supposed to learn?\n\nIs there a message at the heart of the external conflict? (Hint: Look at the difficult choices your protagonist has to make, ways in which they are the same as or the opposite of the antagonist, and how the conflict is resolved.)\n\nWhat character archetypes take center stage in this story? What themes emerge naturally from those archetypes?\n\nDo you see any of yourself or your own life in this story? Why do you think those autobiographical details found their way into your novel?\n\nYou can also look back on all the ideas you discarded while planning your novel. Even if you chose not to use them, do you notice a pattern? Did it seem like something within you was trying to tell a story about an underdog? Why is that? What are you trying to say?\n\nIf you havenât started developing your story yetâ¦\n\nAsk Yourself What Matters\n\nClose the door, turn off notifications, and make a list of things you believe. What do you wish you could make everyone else understand?\n\nNow, if you intend to write in a specific genre, focus this brainstorming session around concepts that are important to your readers.\n\nIf you write romance, ask yourself what you believe about love. If youâre a fantasy writer, you might think about themes regarding power or adventure.\n\nOnce you have your list, see what stories these ideas spark.\n\nIf nothing comes to mind, try disproving your theme.\n\nWhat would have to happen to you in order for you to accept the opposite belief? Give that experience to a character. Make it their Ghost. Then figure out what type of conflict would challenge them to see the world the way you see it.\n\nExperiment with different ideas until you stumble upon a theme youâre excited to write. Once youâre committed to a theme, youâre ready to think about techniques for working it into your novel.\n\nHow Do You Write a Theme Without Being Too on the Nose?\n\nIn case it needs to be said, you should not open your book with the line, âIn this novel, I will demonstrateâ¦â\n\nWhile we human folk crave stories that mean something, we donât like theme shoved in our faces. Feels too preachy.\n\nSo how do you write a theme, then?\n\nYou turn to that old chestnut: âShow, donât tell.â\n\nHereâs how.\n\nIntegrate Theme and Character Arc\n\nIdeally, multiple character arcs will serve your theme, but your theme must be reflected in your protagonistâs journey. To explore what that means exactly, letâs look at the movie Up.\n\nUpâs theme is this:\n\nâLife itself is the ultimate adventure.\n\nSo how do we see this in the arc of the protagonist, Carl?\n\nOnce a boy who dreamed of being an explorer, Carl is now a cantankerous old man who has isolated himself from the world after the death of his wife. (Her death is his Ghost.)\n\nHe believes that without his wife, Ellie, the world has nothing to offer him. (This would be categorized as the Lie in a character development worksheet.)\n\nBut the events that unfold when he and his balloon-strung house go to Paradise Falls reveal that adventure is still available to him. He only needs to open up to the world and new relationships. In the end, he looks back appreciatively on the everyday adventures he shared with Ellie and actively pursues new adventures with Russell.\n\nIn contrast, we have Carlâs antagonist, Charles Muntz. This âtrueâ adventurer has become obsessed with exploration to the point of paranoia and violence. He lives for himself alone, and it appears to be a miserable existence.\n\nPoint made, Pixar.\n\nUse Symbols\n\nYou may recall from middle school English class that a symbol is something (usually a material object) that represents an idea.\n\nThere are a ton of symbols in Up, but the most famous is Carl and Ellieâs house. By the time Carl is a grumpy widower, the house has come to represent his wife. And as you might notice when watching the movie:\n\nHe hides himself away in it.\n\nHe clings to it.\n\nHe tries to escape the rest of the world with it.\n\nHe tows it along everywhere he goes.\n\nThen, when his arc is complete and he realizes he still has more adventures ahead, he lets go.\n\nPut It in Dialogue\n\nIf youâve seen Up, you might remember that scene where Russell is talking about how he used to love sitting on the curb with his dad, naming the colors of the cars that drove by. Then he says it.\n\nâYou might think thatâs boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.â\n\nItâs not a direct statement of the theme. But itâs the same basic idea delivered in Russellâs voice and according to Russellâs experience. And the movie gets there without Carl ever saying, âI donât know, Russell, what do you think the ultimate adventure is?â\n\nWhen you start looking for statements of theme in the books and movies you consume, youâll start seeing them constantly.\n\nThe best friend in a romance says, âYou wouldnât have to change yourself for him if he really loved you.â\n\nThe detectiveâs British granny says, âYou mustnât assume people are what they seem.â\n\nSupreme narcissist Ferris Bueller says, âLife moves pretty fast. If you donât stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.â\n\n(Side note: Itâs rarely the protagonist who states the theme. Unless itâs Ferris Bueller, because everythingâs gotta be about Ferris.)\n\nIt can also be fun to use dialogue to hint at the theme. In Up, Muntzâs catchphrase, âAdventure is out there,â is repeated a lot. By the end of the story, the phrase takes on a new meaningâone that is, in fact, a statement of theme.\n\nWhen in Doubt, Just Write\n\nIf the system above doesnât work for you, just write.\n\nI personally like to start with a theme in mind, but itâs not unusual for the theme to evolve as I put words to the page. Even for plotters, writing is an act of discovery. Sometimes we donât truly know what weâre saying until weâve said it.\n\nSo go ahead and write. As you start to feel meaning emerge, use these tips to define your theme more clearly and tease it out more.\n\nAlso worth noting: Dabble can help you keep track of those aha moments without interrupting your flow.
