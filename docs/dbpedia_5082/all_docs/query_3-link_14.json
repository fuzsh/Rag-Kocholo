        "text": "Every good story has a plot and every good plot needs a theme.\n\nThe story is a series of events.\n\nThe plot is a structure that the storyteller uses to show how the events are connected.\n\nThe theme is the central message behind the story.\n\nTo tell the best story possible, you need both a plot and a theme. But here’s the thing: Themes cannot be spelled out. Instead, you’ll need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to help the reader figure out the story’s theme. Confused? Let’s talk about it.\n\nTheme Defined\n\nIt can be easy to mistake your story’s plot with its theme. After all, they’re both used to understand the story.\n\nHere’s how they differ:\n\nWhen someone asks you what your story is about, you may answer in one of two ways. The first way is to share exactly what happens in your story by describing the events and the characters. (Ex. “It’s a story about a child who loses their mother because of drug addiction.”) That’s the plot. The second way is to share the big-picture meaning behind your story. (Ex. “It’s a story about love conquering hate.”) That’s the theme.\n\nWhile the plot tells exactly what happens in the story, the theme explains why. It gives meaning to the story. Without a theme, your story is a recording of actions but it doesn’t explain why these actions happen beyond simple cause and effect.\n\nThe “why” is important for your reader.\n\nThe human mind is always searching for meaning. We love stories because they provide answers about the human condition. Stories help us understand life, ourselves, and each other. But this doesn’t happen accidentally. A storyteller must be intentional. A story’s theme is the author’s statement about the human condition.\n\nIt’s not just a topic, but it’s also the author’s treatment on and opinion on the topic. For example, it’s not just about honesty. It’s about the importance of being one’s authentic self.\n\nTwo authors can take the same raw material (the story) and re-arrange the material to express their thematic statements. For example, by shifting the narrative point of view from the protagonist to the villain, you can have the same story material but come away with a different perspective and a completely different theme. A story must be told in a specific and deliberate way to amplify its theme.\n\nIf you don’t have a theme, your story will seem empty and meaningless because, well, it is.\n\nHere’s another reason why you need a theme in your story:\n\nKnowing your theme will help you write a better story. Use your intended theme as a guide to what you should and should not share in the story. For example, if your story is about faith vs. doubt, make sure that every major event in your story ties back to this theme.\n\nHow to Discover Your Story's Theme\n\nNow that we’ve discussed what a theme is, let’s discuss how to discover the theme in your story.\n\nFigure Out Your Why\n\nWhy are you telling this specific story in this specific way in the first place? What message would you like to convey to your dear reader? What stance are you taking and why?\n\nGetting clear about your reason for writing the story will help you understand your intentions.\n\nOften, it takes some digging. When we first sit down to write a story, we don’t always ask these questions. We just think, “Cool story, bro. Let’s get to writing.” Definitely do that. But then, after getting your first draft down, start thinking about the deeper meaning behind the story. Ask what this story says about life or being human.\n\nConsider Your Story’s Genre\n\nEach literary genre has its own set of common themes. Here are a few examples:\n\nCrime - Good vs. evil\n\nDystopian - Loss of individualism\n\nEpic/ Adventure - Self-reliance\n\nRomance - Love and sacrifice\n\nScience Fiction - Conflict with technology\n\nSaga - Circle of life\n\nYoung Adult - Coming of age, desire to escape\n\nWhen choosing a theme for your story, always refer to your genre first. Your reader will expect a familiar theme based on the genre of your story. If you don’t deliver, you may disappoint the reader. For example, I wouldn’t expect the main theme of a romance novel to be about the corruption of power. While that could work as a secondary theme, the main theme should be something that the reader anticipates because of your story’s genre.\n\nCreate an Outline\n\nIt’s never too late to outline.\n\nI know that some writers hate outlining. So, here’s my advice. If you’re a pantser and hate outlining before churning out your first draft— Don’t. Instead, outline after writing your first draft.\n\nI highly recommend outlining (even if it’s a bare-bones outline) before starting your second draft. This allows you to attack your writing with a greater sense of direction. This gives you a chance to see how you can arrange events to highlight your big picture.\n\nUse Motifs\n\nLet’s talk a little bit about motifs.\n\nThemes work hand in hand with motifs. But, what the heck is a motif?\n\nA motif is a symbol, action, image, or word that repeats itself throughout a story.\n\nAt first glance, motif and theme seem to be similar. Both have a symbolic meaning. However, motifs are concrete and can be experienced by the senses. A motif is seen, heard, or felt. A story's theme is always abstract. It's the observation that the reader makes when presented with all of the events in the story. The theme is never spelled out, while the motif is always described.\n\nMotifs are used to uncover the story's theme. When done correctly, the recurring elements in your story will connect together to reveal the big picture.\n\nStill confused? Here’s an example to help you understand the role that motifs play in a story:\n\nIn Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, one of the strongest themes is the question of fate vs free will. The author suggests that there's an element of chance in life. He emphasizes this theme with the motif of a coin toss. Throughout the novel, the villain uses a coin toss to determine one's fate. While the victim has the free will to choose which side to bet on, their fate is up to chance.\n\nThis is one example of how a recurring element (motif) reinforces the main theme of a story.\n\nThe good thing about motifs is that you can add them after the fact. After figuring out why you wrote the story, you can insert motifs to further emphasize your thematic statement.\n\nUse Multiple Themes\n\nYou’re not bound to just one theme in your story. Stories can have many themes.\n\nWhile you’ll likely have just one major theme coursing through your story, you can have many minor themes that act as support. These minor themes can strengthen your main theme and add more depth to your story. Give your reader more things to consider by serving up multiple themes."
