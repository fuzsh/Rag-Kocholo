Find out when Season 7 of Young Sheldon is returning to CBS and which cast members are coming back for the show’s final run.\n\nA spin-off of the widely successful sitcom The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon is the coming-of-age prequel that follows a young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage), a child genius growing up with his family in East Texas. The series premiered on CBS in September 2017 and is set in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Big Bang lead star Jim Parsons narrates Young Sheldon and serves as an executive producer.\n\nThe next season will pick up where Season 6 left off — after Sheldon and his mother, Mary (Zoe Perry), were boarding a plane to Germany, where Sheldon was planning to spend the summer. Back at home, a tornado tears apart Meemaw’s (Annie Potts) house in Texas.

At the time of the show’s cancelation, CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach said the popular series “proved lightning can strike twice.”\n\n“It [Young Sheldon] set itself apart with a remarkable cast that felt like a family from the first moment we saw them on screen and brought characters to life with unique heartfelt stories that drew audiences in from the start,” the executive said in a statement. “We extend a sincere thank you to executive producers Chuck Lorre, Steve Molaro and Steve Holland and the entire writing and producing teams for six wonderful seasons. We look forward to seeing their final season unfold and giving it a proper send off with the best episodes yet for their fans to enjoy.”\n\nWill There Be A Spin-off Of Young Sheldon?\n\nYes, a spin-off of Young Sheldon is currently in the works at CBS, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
