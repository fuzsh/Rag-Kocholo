Whatever your sport of choice, chances are you’ll be able to find it during the 2024 Summer Olympics, which officially begins on July 26, 2024.\n\nThis year, top athletes worldwide have descended upon Paris to compete in the 2024 Summer Olympics. Over 16 days, multiple events across various sports will take place — with nearly all the events being streamed live for your viewing pleasure.\n\nTo help you ensure you don’t miss your favorite sporting events, we’ve outlined exactly when the Olympics are happening and how you can watch them.\n\nWhen are the Olympics happening?\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics officially open on Friday, July 26, 2024, with an opening ceremony in the heart of Paris. There will even be boats on the river for each national delegation. For the first time in the Summer Olympics’ history, the opening ceremony will not be held in a stadium. Instead, it will be held along the River Seine. The ceremony will be hosted by sports commentator Mike Tirico, singer and television host Kelly Clarkson and former football player Peyton Manning.\n\nA few events (like rugby and soccer) will actually begin before the opening ceremony on July 24 and 25. Nearly 11,000 athletes will compete in this year’s Olympics, and over 200 nations will be represented. The games will conclude on August 11, 2024.\n\nHow to watch the 2024 Olympics in Paris\n\nIf you pay for cable, you can view at least nine hours of daytime events on NBC and Telemundo between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET.
