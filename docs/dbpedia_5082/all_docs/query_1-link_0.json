The series was broadcast for eight seasons from September 23, 2013, to May 13, 2021.[1] Set in Napa, California, it follows dysfunctional mother/daughter duo Bonnie and Christy Plunkett, who, after having been estranged for years while both struggled with addiction, attempt to pull their lives together by trying to stay sober. It stars Anna Faris and Allison Janney, with Mimi Kennedy, Jaime Pressly, Beth Hall, William Fichtner, Sadie Calvano, Blake Garrett Rosenthal, Matt Jones, French Stewart and Kristen Johnston in supporting roles.\n\nThe series was filmed in front of a live audience and produced by Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner Bros. Television. It received acclaim from critics and audiences for the writing and performances (particularly Janney's), as well as for addressing real-life issues such as: alcoholism, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, addictive gambling, homelessness, relapse, cancer, death, erectile dysfunction, domestic violence, overdose, palsy, rape, obesity, stroke, ADHD and miscarriage; and for maintaining a deft balance between the humorous and darker aspects of these issues.\n\nMom consistently received high ratings in its genre, with an average viewership of 11.79 million, making it the third-highest rated comedy on broadcast television in the US;[clarification needed] the show is among the top five comedies with adults aged 25–54 and adults aged 18–49.[2][1] It received various accolades, with Janney winning two straight Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2014 and 2015, and being nominated in 2016 and for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2017, 2018, and 2021. It also garnered multiple nominations at the Critics' Choice Television Awards and the People's Choice Awards. On September 4, 2020, Faris announced she would exit from the series and shortly thereafter CBS announced that it would end after its eighth season.[3][4] The series finale aired on May 13, 2021.[5]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nMom follows Christy Plunkett (Anna Faris), a single mother who, after battling alcoholism and drug abuse, decides to restart her life in Napa, California, working as a waitress and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Her mother, Bonnie Plunkett, (Allison Janney) is also a recovering addict.\n\nChristy has two children. Her daughter, Violet (Sadie Calvano) was born when Christy was 17. She has also become a teen mother by her boyfriend, Luke (Spencer Daniels). Christy’s young son, Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), is a product of her second marriage to Baxter, a deadbeat but likable pothead.\n\nChristy eventually returns to school and pursues her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie meets and marries a retired stuntman named Adam Janikowski (William Fichtner). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie (Mimi Kennedy), wealthy and materialistic Jill (Jaime Pressly), submissive and sometimes overly-emotional Wendy (Beth Hall), and loudmouthed but sweet Tammy (Kristen Johnston). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of the conflicts they face.\n\nFollowing the departure of Christy, who moves to Washington, the show delves more into the personal lives of her friends she left behind.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Mom episodes\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain characters Actor Character Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Allison Janney Bonnie Plunkett Main Anna Faris Christy Plunkett Main Matt Jones Baxter Main Recurring Guest Sadie Calvano Violet Plunkett Main Recurring Guest Blake Garrett Rosenthal Roscoe Plunkett Main Recurring French Stewart Rudy Main Guest Guest Recurring Guest Nate Corddry Gabriel Main Spencer Daniels Luke Main Recurring Guest Mimi Kennedy Marjorie Armstrong Recurring Main Jaime Pressly Jill Kendall Recurring Main Beth Hall Wendy Harris Recurring Main William Fichtner Adam Janikowski Recurring Main Kristen Johnston Tammy Diffendorf Guest Recurring Main\n\nMain characters\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna Faris as Christy Jolene Plunkett (seasons 1–7):[14] an easily wounded single mother who is struggling to recover from her addictions to alcohol and gambling. At the series outset, Christy has been seven months sober. She is striving to be a good example to her son Roscoe, and regain the trust of her daughter Violet, who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the episode “pilot”. She is also trying to reconcile with her mother Bonnie, whom she still struggles to forgive after a tumultuous childhood and long estrangement. Christy later finds out that her biological father, Alvin, ran out on Bonnie after she was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Eve after giving birth to Christy. She locates Alvin and finds out that he is a married father with two sons and runs an auto repair shop. Christy eventually develops a bond with Alvin, whom she introduces to her family, and comes to see him as the father she needs in her life. Like her mother, Christy also became a teenage mother when she got pregnant at age 16 and had Violet at 17. Violet's father Butch was horribly physically abusive to Christy, who tried to leave him on numerous occasions, only to get cold feet. Christy finally worked up the courage to leave him in order to protect Violet. A former stripper, Christy is mostly seen working as a waitress. She is briefly promoted to manager (after Claudia divorces Gabriel), but eventually goes back to being a waitress, where she is not very good at her job, but does bring home a lot of food for Bonnie and herself. Christy later decides that she wants to go back to school to become a lawyer, and she takes a second job as Steve Casper's assistant, eventually earning her bachelor's degree and then being accepted to law school. Near the end of season 6, Christy begins an internship with a law firm, while still working her waitress job. In season 7, Christy has unpleasant experiences at work, is not doing very well at law school (she was rejected for a mock trial team, and a professor she runs into while babysitting Marjorie's granddaughter presumes that Christy is a poor student because she's a single mother), has no social life to speak of, confirms she has little or no contact with either of her children, and out of desperation kisses another woman in the season finale. In the season 8 premiere, it is revealed that Christy has left Napa to attend Georgetown law school on a full scholarship; while Christy was mentioned during the 8th and final season, she never returned for a guest appearance and was not involved in the series finale in any way.\n\nAllison Janney as Bonnie Plunkett: Christy's self-centered mother, a cynical recovering addict who is sure she's always right, but in the long run, learns humility. She tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter, whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child. Bonnie was given up for adoption at age four and was in the foster care system, being passed around from house to house where she eventually ran off with Alvin at age 15. She ended up pregnant and had Christy at age 17. Alvin abandoned both of them at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Bonnie said that she almost aborted the pregnancy, and then wanted to put Christy up for adoption. A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her, but Bonnie couldn't go through with the adoption. From that point on, she tried her best to raise Christy. However, Christy wound up raising herself; Bonnie chose parties and drinking over staying home. With time and much therapy, Bonnie managed to find balance. She revealed Christy's past to her, including who and where her birth father was, as well as Bonnie's past \"side career\" as a drug dealer. She suffered a relapse in season 1 after losing her job and apartment, and had to move in with Christy, Violet, and Roscoe. After Christy reconnected with her biological father Alvin, Bonnie slowly realized that she still had feelings for him, and the two began to date at the beginning of season 2. This was cut short after Alvin suffered a heart attack and died, leaving his family shocked. After suffering from a back injury, Bonnie became hooked on pain medication prescribed to her, which led to another relapse. In season 3, she met her biological mother, and in season 4 she met her half-brother Ray after their mother died. She managed the apartment building where she and Christy lived. In season 6, she was diagnosed with ADHD and began seeing a therapist to deal with it. Late in season 8, she and former foster sister Tammy Diffendorf set up a construction firm together to market Tammy's skills in repair and home construction.\n\nSadie Calvano as Violet Plunkett (main, seasons 1–3; recurring, season 4; guest, season 6): Christy's daughter and older half-sister of Roscoe. A senior in high school at the beginning of the series, Violet is hardworking, smart and sure of herself, though upset with her mother, who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time. After having her boyfriend Luke's baby, Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than herself, her mother, or her grandmother ever had. Violet's father was physically abusive to Christy, and Christy has lied to Violet concerning his whereabouts, taking her to a random man's grave and telling Violet that her father is dead. During season 2, in a downward spiral of bad behavior, Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her. She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik, a much older psychology professor at her university, but he breaks the engagement after she begins to party too hard, leaving her mother and grandmother wondering if she was just experiencing young life or developing a problem. Violet moves back in with Christy and Bonnie after her break up. When her mother and grandmother demand that she get a job, Violet moves to Lake Tahoe to become a blackjack dealer at Harrah's. Violet moves back to her mother and grandmother after wrecking her life in Lake Tahoe and gets back together and moves in with Luke after seeing that he has improved his life. In Calvano's last appearance on the show, Violet returns in season 6 as the host of a successful podcast called \"The Mother of all Problems\" where she outlines in great detail all of Christy's terrible past actions; it is revealed that Christy and Violet have not talked in over a year (though she remains in contact with Bonnie), and while Violet lets Christy on her podcast and gives her credit for turning her life around, she bluntly says that the past cannot be changed and she thinks it is healthier to have no relationship with Christy in the future. In season 7, Christy sadly confirms to Bonnie's new sponsee that she still does not have a relationship with Violet.\n\nNate Corddry as Gabriel (main, seasons 1–2): the manager of the restaurant where Christy works. Married to a domineering woman who scares him somewhat, Gabriel and Christy are carrying on an affair which Christy later ends but which Gabriel himself frequently and desperately tries to renew: they briefly resume their affair in season 2 when Christy is promoted as his replacement. He is a hardworking, competent manager, but often put in his place by his subordinates, particularly Chef Rudy.\n\nMatt Jones as Baxter (main, seasons 1–3; recurring, seasons 4–6): Christy's husband and the father of Roscoe. Sweet and charming, but very unstable, he is unable to maintain a serious relationship or steady work for much longer than a month. Loves easy life and frequently gets into fraudulent deals to make money. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father who usually comes through for his son. During season 2, under the influence of his wealthy new girlfriend Candace, Baxter mostly gives up his slacker ways and becomes a car salesman at a dealership owned by Candace's father. Despite admitting to Christy he needs to smoke pot to act happy, Baxter seems mostly content to be an ersatz \"trophy husband\". In season 5, Baxter pays for Christy's new car when she's dealing with money issues as his way of making some amends to Christy.\n\nFrench Stewart as Chef Rudy (main, seasons 1–2; recurring, seasons 3, 5–8): the head chef for the Rustic Fig restaurant, where Christy works as a waitress. A dominant and difficult self-made man, Rudy acts superior in his relationships with others. He sells drugs out of the freezer and is boastful and arrogant, often yelling at his subordinates without mincing words, and will not hesitate to humiliate anyone who opposes him. He is secretive about his past and distant from people, but briefly dates Bonnie and is revealed to be a bisexual fetishist with expensive tastes and hobbies who steals food from the restaurant (which has resulted in him being fired as of season 8, leaving him to run his own food truck). Tammy is his most recent love interest but they are no longer involved by the time the series ends.\n\nSpencer Daniels as Luke (main, season 1; recurring season 2; guest, season 4): a young student who loves to enjoy life and adventure. He had been dating Violet for a little over a year and got her pregnant. Luke is considerably airheaded, smoking marijuana often, but always tries to prove to Christy that he is not as crazy as he appears: he seems to genuinely love Violet, staying beside her and supporting her throughout her pregnancy, and he is often more sensitive towards Christy than her own children are, perhaps because his parents are religious fundamentalists with whom he does not connect. In season 2, Violet, during her downward spiral, cheated on Luke and he broke up with Violet. By season 4, Luke has apparently cleaned himself up and got a high-paying job as a playtester with a video game company, driving Violet to get back together with him. Violet reveals in season 6 that she and Luke have ended their relationship.\n\nBlake Garrett Rosenthal as Roscoe Plunkett (main, seasons 1–3; recurring, season 4): Christy's son by Baxter and half-brother of Violet. He experimented with marijuana at age twelve. He has not appeared since season 4, and it is stated he went to live with Baxter and his new wife Candace (which Christy confirms in season 7). However, in \"Beef Baloney Dan and a Sarcastic No\", it is heavily implied that Christy still has an on-going relationship with her son, as it is revealed that he still texts her.\n\nMimi Kennedy as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian (recurring, season 1; main, seasons 2–8):[15] Christy's and Bonnie's AA sponsor who is something of a cat lady. She had problems with alcohol and drugs in the past, was a groupie (it is insinuated in one episode and attested by herself in others that she slept with Jimi Hendrix), was briefly involved with the Black Panther Party, spent some time in prison for bank robbery, was homeless for a period of time, and is a mother to a son whom she had no relationship or contact with for years, until Christy convinced him to reconnect with Marjorie following her cancer diagnosis. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in season 1, and after extensive treatment finally beats it at the end of season 2. Through Christy she meets Victor Perugian, Christy's former landlord, whom she eventually weds and then cares for after he suffers a stroke. When Victor dies, her vulnerable side is revealed, and the women do their best to help Marjorie cope with being widowed for the second time (her first husband having died before the start of the show, after three decades of marriage). Marjorie has dealt with financial and health issues in Seasons 7 and 8, including her having to take a food delivery job to earn money and having to have a stent put into her heart to prevent its failure.\n\nJaime Pressly as Jill Kendall (recurring, season 2; main, seasons 3–8):[16] A wealthy, divorced socialite and alcoholic. Christy first met her at an AA meeting and, at Marjorie's urging, offered to sponsor her. Jill suffered several relapses before becoming sober. Her mother had struggled with depression and alcoholism before dying by suicide when Jill was a teenager. Jill carried this pain with her throughout her life, culminating in season 4, when she was overcome with grief on the anniversary of her mother's death. Jill is from North Carolina, and worked hard to lose the thickness of her Southern accent upon moving to California to be with her then-husband, James. After trying to become pregnant and miscarrying, Jill decides to adopt a foster child. She is eventually given a teenage girl named Emily, but Christy helps Emily's mother become sober at the start of season 5, leading to Emily leaving Jill. This caused Jill to overeat and gain weight (scripted to cover up Pressly's real-life pregnancy during season 5). After an extended stay at a health spa, she returns in the later half of season 5 and suffers another relapse. Despite being vain and obsessed with how her peers view her, she is shown to genuinely care about her friends and use her experiences to help them with their own problems. In season 6 she began a relationship with Andy, a police officer and former Marine who provided private home security services at Jill's home after it was broken into. At the end of season 7, Jill consults a fertility doctor to freeze her eggs but she gets a call from the doctor saying that she has no viable eggs, leaving her extremely devastated by that news: she becomes clingy and paranoid, eventually causing Andy to break up with her in season 8, although they get back together after being caught in a bank robbery. In the final episodes of the series, Jill becomes pregnant again and marries Andy.\n\nBeth Hall as Wendy Harris (recurring, season 2; main, seasons 3–8):[17] A member of the AA group, often subdued and prone to constant crying. She is a member of Mensa, works as a registered nurse (displaying a hidden sadistic streak when in uniform), was raised by a lesbian couple in Florida, is implied to be in witness protection or otherwise connected to a mob family, and is the subject of a recurring joke in the series where no one, including her friends, listens much to her or wants her around more than minimally possible. In \"A Pirate, Three Frogs, and a Prince\", Wendy was revealed to be both bisexual/pansexual/bicurious, and possibly attracted to Bonnie. Wendy frequently moderates the group's AA meetings; she delivers the final line of the series, standing at the meeting podium and asking, \"Who else wants to share?\"\n\nWilliam Fichtner as Adam Janikowski (recurring, season 3; main, seasons 4–8):[18] Bonnie's later love interest and eventual husband, an ex-stuntman who now uses a wheelchair. He and Bonnie met over the phone after Adam called her several times, though hers was a wrong number given to him by a woman he'd met in a bar. Adam reveals in his first date with Bonnie that his spinal injury did not occur in the line of work, but was the result of sliding off a cliff while snowboarding. He is supportive of Bonnie's recovery, though does not always fully understand it, prompting him to eventually join Al-Anon. In season 6, he uses his life savings to open a bar called AJ's Barrelworks, and he and Bonnie get married in that season's finale. In the series finale, it is revealed that Adam has lung cancer, although it has been caught early and is therefore treatable.\n\nKristen Johnston as Tammy Diffendorf (guest, season 5; recurring, season 6; main, seasons 7–8):[19] an ex-con who was Bonnie's foster sister for a short time in their teens. They reconnect after Bonnie comes across Tammy while visiting a women's prison, where Tammy says she was tried and convicted of robbing a steakhouse on \"Cops Eat Free Night\", and Tammy joins the group's AA meetings upon being released from prison in season 6. After temporarily living in Bonnie and Christy's apartment, she moves in with Marjorie. When she returns to her old foster home where she lived with Bonnie, it is revealed that her father killed her mother and she went into the foster care system after that; in the Season 8 premiere, Tammy talks briefly on the phone to her father when he calls from prison to wish her a happy birthday. Tammy is extremely handy at home improvements and similar light construction work, and has helped Bonnie with her apartment manager work while also doing remodeling at Adam's bar and the restaurant where Christy worked. As of the end of season 7, she is working toward being a full-fledged contractor, and is no longer on parole after making excellent progress readjusting to society post-prison: by the end of season 8, she and Bonnie have set up a construction firm of their own.\n\nRecurring characters\n\n[edit]\n\nReggie de Leon as Paul (seasons 1–3, 5–8): Chef Rudy's silent and often submissive sous-chef, who was fired alongside him. They now run the food truck together.\n\nKevin Pollak as Alvin Lester Biletnikoff (seasons 1–2, 8): Christy's father and Bonnie's ex-boyfriend who abandoned them when Christy was born. When Christy finds Alvin, he is running his own auto body shop and states he has a wife and two sons who know nothing of her existence. Despite that, he comes to love Christy and does what he can to be in her life and help out, including fixing up a used car to give her and attempting to reach out to her children as a grandfather. He and Bonnie initially treated each other with contempt and hatred over the various mistakes each of them has made in their past, but they rekindled their relationship after his wife left him and he survived a heart attack. In season 2, Alvin suffers a second, fatal heart attack while in bed with Bonnie.\n\nOctavia Spencer as Regina Tompkins (seasons 1–3): A fellow AA member and money manager who embezzled from her clients and faces a long prison sentence. While a close if questionable friend to Christy, Regina and Bonnie typically hold each other in contempt, but beneath the surface, they bear some affection for each other. In the middle of season 2, she is given early parole and becomes a born-again Christian, eventually moving in with Jill. Regina drifts apart from her friends after she decides she is no longer an alcoholic, essentially choosing wine over her friends, and struggles alone with the dissonance after moving into her own apartment and out of Jill's mansion.\n\nCourtney Henggeler as Claudia (seasons 1–3): Gabriel's wealthy and snobbish (later ex-) wife, who takes over the restaurant from him and briefly appoints Christy as manager.\n\nMary Pat Gleason as Mary (seasons 1–5, 7): A fellow AA member who is frequently interrupted by Bonnie when she shares her problems with the group, as her anecdotes tend to be bizarre and creepy even by the standards of addicts. Mary dies in season 7 at the AA meeting from an aneurysm (ironically just months before Gleason herself died) and the main characters put together an elaborate reception to say goodbye to her.\n\nDon McManus as Steve Casper (seasons 1–4): A fellow AA member, Steve is a competent but creepy lawyer and occasionally aids Christy, who becomes his intern and trainee in season 2. He has a casual sex relationship with Bonnie in season 3. His final appearance was in the Season 4 finale, where he is stuck in Mexico because he stupidly fled there to avoid reprisals after losing a case involving a drug lord's son (stupidly since the drug lord is based in...Mexico).\n\nRyan Cartwright and Melissa Tang as Jeff and Suzanne Taylor (seasons 1–2): the couple that adopts Violet's daughter.\n\nSara Rue as Candace Hayes (seasons 2–4): Baxter's wealthy new wife, who reforms him. She delivers many subtle jabs at Christy's poverty in the form of backhanded compliments, and seems to be trying to force Christy aside to replace her as Roscoe's mother. The hostility becomes much more obvious in season 3, when Candace's wealthy father, Fred (Harry Hamlin), briefly dates Christy and Candace accuses Christy of only being with him for his money. Christy breaks up with Fred because he openly insults and mocks Candace for doing nothing but living off his wealth. When Candace (wrongly and smugly) smirks that Fred dumped her, Christy gives Candace a hug and shuts her up by saying \"I know why you're a bitch.\"\n\nJonny Coyne as Victor Perugian (seasons 2–4): Christy's Armenian former landlord who becomes attracted to Marjorie, marrying her in season 3. Victor later suffers two strokes (both offscreen). The first in Season 5 leaves him largely incapacitated, and the second in Season 6 is fatal.\n\nAmy Hill as Beverly Tarantino (seasons 2–5): A tenant in the apartment complex where Christy and Bonnie live (the complex itself was never given a name on the show). She dislikes Bonnie and is always trying to get her fired from the building manager position. However, she has been less harsh since she admitted to Bonnie that her own father was a hopeless alcoholic, and that she has projected some of her anger at him onto Bonnie due to her AA ties.\n\nCharlie Robinson as Mr. Munson (seasons 2–7): A blind tenant in the apartment complex where Christy and Bonnie live. He is a Vietnam war veteran who is battling prostate cancer. He and Bonnie develop a friendship; Bonnie reads to him, helps him with his medications and offers rides to chemotherapy. When the new building owner tells Bonnie to evict any tenant who is significantly behind in rent (including Munson, who is behind after paying out of pocket for cancer medications not covered by the V.A.) Bonnie revolts, telling the owner she'll quit if the owner doesn't back down. Her stand saves Munson's apartment and helps to cement their friendship.\n\nDavid Krumholtz as Gregory Munchnik (seasons 2–3): Violet's older Jewish ex-fiancé, a psychology professor at the college she attends.\n\nEmily Osment as Jodi Hubbard (season 3): A young drug addict whom Christy and Bonnie try to help get sober. She later dies from a drug overdose.\n\nLauri Johnson as Beatrice (seasons 3–8): A waitress at the Burgundy Bistro that serves as a recurring location for the cast.\n\nMissi Pyle as Natasha (seasons 4–5): Emily's biological mother, an alcoholic whom Christy knows from her stripping days. Christy helps Natasha get sober and regain custody of her daughter.\n\nJulia Lester as Emily (seasons 4–5): Jill's teenage foster daughter and Natasha's biological daughter.\n\nLeonard Roberts as Ray Stabler (seasons 4–5): Bonnie's gay half-brother who was a successful lawyer and who developed a cocaine habit.\n\nSteven Weber as Patrick Janikowski (season 5), Adam's younger brother and Christy's short-term love interest. They break up after Christy turns down his proposal for her to move to Santa Cruz and live with him, and he marries another woman soon after.\n\nYvette Nicole Brown as Nora Rogers (seasons 5–6): Christy's no-nonsense sponsor who works as a TV weather anchor and finds herself violating her established rules about not interacting with sponsees outside of AA with Christy. In the Season 6 finale, she tells a devastated Christy she is leaving California to take a job at a TV station in Minneapolis.\n\nSam McMurray as Ned (season 6), one of the Gamblers Anonymous members where Christy attends meetings; he becomes her de facto sponsor.\n\nSusan Ruttan as Lucy (season 6), one of the Gamblers Anonymous members in Christy's group; she is good-hearted but constantly relapses and loses huge amounts of money.\n\nWill Sasso as Andy Pepper (seasons 6–8), Jill's on-and-off love interest and eventual husband, a police officer and former Marine. His last name wasn't given until the series finale, and came as a source of amusement because he is a Sergeant with the PD (making him Sgt.

The following week, the network announced it would place the show in the Monday night 9:30 pm (ET/PT) time slot following 2 Broke Girls.[23] However, after the cancellation of We Are Men, 2 Broke Girls was moved into the show's 8:30 pm slot, with repeats of The Big Bang Theory occupying the 9 pm lead-in time slot to Mom until the season debut of Mike & Molly on November 4, 2013. Mom received a full first season order for 22 episodes on October 18, 2013.[24]\n\nOn March 13, 2014, CBS announced the second season renewal of Mom.[25] It moved from Mondays at 9:30 PM to Thursdays at 8:30 PM for the first 14 episodes, until it moved to Thursdays at 9:30 PM following The Odd Couple series premiere and the series finale of Two and a Half Men.[26][27]\n\nBy season three, the focus became more about Christy and Bonnie and their group from AA, while the restaurant set, the kids, and Baxter's roles were reduced significantly.\n\nIn February 2021, CBS announced the series would end with the final episode of the eighth season, airing on May 13, 2021.\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series gave Faris, who had guest-starred in various television programs between her film projects and been sought for other television projects (including an unused pilot, Blue Skies, produced for NBC), her first full-time television role as the lead character, Christy, in January 2013.[29] On January 28, 2013, Janney was next to come aboard as Christy's mother.[30] Matt Jones and Spencer Daniels joined the cast in February 2013, with Jones as Christy's ex-husband Baxter, and Daniels as Luke, the boyfriend of Christy's daughter, Violet.[31]\n\nBroadcast\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Australia, Mom debuted on Nine Network on April 9, 2014.[32] In Canada, Citytv aired it simultaneously.[33][34] In Greece, Star Channel debuted it on October 25, 2014.[35] In India, Comedy Central (India) broadcast the series through 2015. In Israel, it is broadcast on HOT Comedy Central.[36] In the United Kingdom, ITV2 debuted the show on January 20, 2014; they have since dropped it, and it had not been available to UK viewers since the end of Season 4. From October 2022, all 8 seasons were made available to UK viewers for the first time on Amazon Prime Video.[37][38]\n\nSyndication\n\n[edit]\n\nMom went into syndication in late 2017.
