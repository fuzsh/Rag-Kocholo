We follow a pack of elephants, wild dogs, and cheetahs struggling to keep their cubs alive in a land of predator.\n\nA Wild Year On Earth\n\nThis documentary series charts the planet's most spectacular events of migration and transformation. Over the course of a year, we witness how finely tuned creatures face seasonal patterns as they become more extreme and dangerously unreliable."
