        "text": "The idea of VCE English assessments can sometimes be a bit daunting. Always so much you want to write, never as much time as you need and they always seem to come around sooner than you think. But there is never as much cause for alarm as you think and Iâm willing to guarantee that almost everyone reading this is so much better than they think at English.Â\n\nYouâve already come so far from where you started in your high school English journey. Iâd like to challenge anyone reading this to go and find the earliest English essay youâve got tucked away somewhere. Iâve done this myself and, if yours is anything like mine, youâll be almost disgusted by what you find. Year-7-me just loved to retell the story, cling to my rigid TEEL formulas and leave my quotes just dangling, write the same basic paragraph three times and call it a complete essay. Not a pretty read and Iâm sure a couple of you can relate. But, this exercise does at least prove a very valuable point: you are capable of improving at English.\n\nSo letâs start thinking about that essay youâve got coming up again. Youâve just given yourself a nice confidence booster with that walk down memory lane, reminding yourself that you are a more-than-capable English student these days. But all you now want to do is your very best for this next essay. But how do you keep improving between now and then? After all, if you knew what you had to do to improve your English, youâd already be doing it, right? So what weâre going to do now is to have a look at what taking your essays to that next level really looks like; how you can improve your writing between now and then, whenever that might be.Â\n\nSo to do this, weâre going to take an already good paragraph and improve it together. Take this one, one that I conveniently prepared earlier to a Station Eleven prompt that has to do with the theme of memory/history.\n\nPart 1: The Good Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating such an enduring legacy for a character who believes in the power of such legacies - 'theyâre all immortal to me' - Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment by preserving these legacies. Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of legacies to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Even though Mirandaâs life is left incomplete by her sudden death, the beauty in the scene of her death suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters: 'its extravagant sunsets and its indigo sea'. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the value of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nLetâs call this our good paragraph. Iâve modelled this off of an essay I found from my Year 10 self, as happy as Year-10-me would have been with this performance, itâs far from perfect. But, it is a very functional paragraph that does all that a paragraph really needs to do. It introduces an idea, justifies it with evidence, links back at the end and doesnât waste too much time retelling the story. So now we get to the fun bit: weâre going to take this already good paragraph, and turn it into a better paragraph.\n\nSo how do we make a good paragraph better?Â\n\nWell, for a start, we can integrate our quotes so that the paragraph reads better. Youâll see in just a second how much of a difference this can make. This is something I learnt to do between Years 10 and 11. Other improvements that could be made include answering the prompt more directly and using some of the language of the prompt within our answers. So letâs change this and see now what these small differences do to our paragraph.\n\nPart 2: The Better Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies that allow others to remember the individuals who came before. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating this symbolic memorial for a character who believes that such legacies can allow individuals such as actors to become 'immortal', Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment through their legacies. Furthermore, Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy through oneâs art to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nThere we have it. The paragraph has been rewritten based on the ones I wrote in Year 11 and we have the first signs of improvement. The topic sentence now references the âremembering the pastâ aspect of the prompt. The linking sentence now uses the âimportanceâ part of the prompt. All of the same quotes are used but are now integrated (check out How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss if you need more help with this).Â\n\nWeâve made sure not to have more than one sentence starting with Mandel (a small nitpick but still a nice addition). It flows better. It answers the prompt more directly and suddenly we have a better paragraph. Year-11-me has shown improvement and with this comes better scores and more confidence: something thatâs very important for success in English. If youâre confident and proud of what youâre writing, then youâll have higher marks and, even better, more fun!\n\nWe havenât changed much and the paragraph is already better. But itâs not my best paragraph. Between Years 11 and 12, I learnt even more things. I was taught to write about not only the world of the text but also the world around us that we and Mandel live in: youâll notice that this better paragraph talks more about âcharactersâ that live âin the textâ whereas my best paragraph would talk more about the text in the context of the world you and I live in. I learnt to make my topic sentences more abstract and broad so that they relate more to our own world and less to the world of the text and remind whoeverâs assessing that my ideas apply to everyone and not just within the texts. I learnt to respond more directly to different types of prompts (Discuss, To what extent is this true?, How does Mandelâ¦ and others) and I learnt to be more direct in discussing the views and values of Mandel (what she likes, what she doesnât like, what she wants to see more of in the world)\n\nSo letâs apply some final changes, and see what our paragraph looks after two more years of refining English. This final paragraph is almost exactly the same as one I wrote in timed conditions before my final exam.\n\nThe Final Part: The Best Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: Mandel explores the importance of legacies, not only as sources of meaning for their creators, but also for their roles in allowing others to remember the roles of those who came before. Such an idea is explored through the naming of Jeevanâs son, securing the legacy of Frank. By affording such a permeating influence to an individual who writes of and appreciates the 'immortal[ity]' of long-dead actors, Mandel implies that an appreciation of the inherent value in a legacy and its ability to influence future events is a key quality in individuals. Furthermore, Mandel uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy that outlives oneself to provide meaning. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, Mandel suggests that the meaning in Mirandaâs life comes from the legacy that is the art she makes in her 'independent' life that continues to influence events and allow others to remember the past long after her death. Mandel provides contrast through her exploration of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, reinforcing Mandelâs view that individuals who forfeit control of their own legacies, as Arthur does, lead far less completed and fulfilled lives. Therefore, Mandel highlights the immense importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past and encourages greater appreciation of the value of legacies in contemporary society.\n\nSo, two years later, and weâve got what is still essentially the same paragraph, just brushed up to an even better, or best, standard. So if weâre using the same evidence, exploring the same characters and introducing the same ideas, why is this paragraph better than the last two?Â\n\nWell, if you study the topic and linking sentences, they discuss the concept of a legacy being a means of allowing others to remember the past and the importance of such a thing and everything in-between links this concept to the text. 'Mandel highlights the immense importance' represents a subtle but nice nod to the wording of the prompt by giving an âextentâ to which Mandel âshowsâ or highlights. Every piece of evidence is discussed in reference to what Mandel believes about the world around us and how individuals should act in modern society.Â\n\nAnd thereâs something very nice that we can now reflect on. This paragraph has gone from good to much better without having to introduce any new ideas. There are no overly complex interpretations of the text, weâve just taken the same skeleton of a paragraph and made it look better without changing its real substance.Â\n\nAnd one of the wonderful things about making efforts to improve the quality of your writing is all the confidence that comes with this, whether this be from getting better at discussing views and values, learning to integrate your quotes or any achievement like this. I know that my confidence surged as my English got better and, as I got more confidence in my writing, I got more confidence in what I wrote about. My interpretations of the text became more and more obscure and a bit whacky at times and I had fun writing about these things. If you improve your writing, youâll improve what youâre writing about which will mean youâll have more fun writing and the cycle of improvement will just continue.Â\n\nSo to cap off, I thought it might be nice to have a checklist of sorts that you might be able to put against your own writing.\n\nWhatâs the next step I could take in improving my English?\n\nAre all my quotes properly integrated? (Hint: if the sentence doesnât make sense without quotation marks, the answer is no)\n\nHave I got more than a couple of sentences starting the same way or could I vary my sentence structure a bit more?\n\nHave I explicitly used some parts of the prompt in my own writing so that I can directly answer the question in my essays?\n\nAm I writing about both the world of the text and the world we live in outside of the text instead of just the characters and relationships within the text?\n\nAre my topic and linking sentences describing a concept that relates to the prompt with everything in-between relating this concept to the text? (I found this a very useful way of thinking of paragraphs)\n\nIs all of my evidence being discussed in relation to the views of the author?\n\nDoes my essay/paragraph explain what the author would like to see more of/less of in modern society based on what is explored in the text?\n\nIs my essay/paragraph specific to the exact wording and type of prompt?\n\nAnd these are just some of the improvements that could be made. Iâm sure each of you could ask teachers and past students and find many, many more tips on improvement. Just as long as youâre thinking about what the next step in your English might be, then youâre already headed in the right direction. So good luck and happy writing!\n\nThe Great Gatsby is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâ\n\nIntroduction\n\nCall it the greatest American novel or ultimate story of unrequited romanceâThe Great Gatsby is undoubtedly a stunning snapshot of one of the most American decades that America has ever seen. The 1920s saw significant economic growth after WWI, and whatâs more American than material excess, wealth, and prosperity? The stock market was going off, businesses were booming, and people were having a great time.\n\nWell, not everybodyâand on the flipside, whatâs more American than socio-economic inequality or the ever-quixotic American Dream?\n\nIn this blog, weâll go through the novel in this context, examine some of its key themes, and also have a think about the critiques it raises about American society. Weâll also go through an essay prompt that ties some of these things together.\n\nLife in the Roaring Twenties\n\nThis snapshot from the 2013 film adaptation actually tells us a lot about the 1920s. On the one hand, social and cultural norms were shiftingâmen no longer sported beards, and women were dressing more androgynously and provocatively. On the other hand, the modern, American economy was emergingâpeople began buying costly consumer goods (like cars, appliances, telephones etc.) using credit rather than cash. This meant that average American families were able to get these things for the first time, while more prosperous families were able to live in extreme excess.\n\nIn Fitzgeraldâs novel, the Buchanans are one such family. Tom and his wife Daisy have belonged to the 1% for generations, and the 1920s saw them cement their wealth and status. At the same time, the booming economy meant that others (like the narrator Nick) were relocating to cities in pursuit of wealth, and (like Gatsby) making significant financial inroads themselves.Â\n\nThe Great Gatsby traces how the differences between these characters can be destructive even if theyâre all wealthy. Add a drop of Gatsbyâs unrequited love for Daisy, and you have a story that ultimately examines how far people go for romance, and what money simply canât buy.Â\n\nThe answer to that isnât so obvious though. Yes, money canât buy love, but it also canât buy a lot of other things associated with the lifestyle and the values of established wealth. Weâll get into some of this now.\n\nWealth and class\n\nFitzgerald explores tensions between three socio-economic classesâthe establishment, the ânouveau richeâ and the working class.\n\nTom and Daisy belong to the âold moneyâ establishment, where wealth is generational and inherited. This means they were born into already wealthy families, which affects their upbringing and ultimately defines them, from the way they speak (Tomâs âpaternal contemptâ and Daisyâs voice, âfull of moneyâ) to their major life decisions (including marriage, symbolised through the âstring of pearlsâ he buys for herâwhich, fun fact, is estimated to be worth millions of dollars today). It also affects their values, as weâll see in the following section.Â\n\nFor now, consider this image of their home (and those ponies on the left, which they also own), described as follows:\n\nâThe lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for [400 metres], jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardensâfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.â\n\nNick Carraway also comes from a similar (though not as extravagant) backgroundâhis family had been rich by Midwestern standards for âthree generationsâ before he came to New York.\n\nConversely, Gatsby belongs to the ânouveau richeâ, or new money. Unlike the Buchanans, Gatsby was born into a poor family, only coming to wealth in the 1920s boom. Specifically, he inherited money from Dan Cody after running away from home at 17.\n\nAlthough they are all rich, there are significant cultural differences between old and new money. Old money have their own culture of feigned politeness which Gatsby doesnât quite get. When Tom and the Sloanes invite Nick and Gatsby to supper in chapter six, Gatsby naively accepts, to which Tom would respond behind his back, âDoesnât he know [Mrs. Sloane] doesnât want him?â Even though Gatsby is financially their equal, his newfound wealth canât buy his way into their (nasty, horrible) lifestyle.\n\nFinally, this is contrasted with the working class, particularly George and Myrtle Wilson who we meet in chapter two. They live in a grey âvalley of ashesâ, the detritus of a prosperous society whose wealth is limited to the 1%. Fitzgerald even calls it a âsolemn dumping groundâ, suggesting that life is precarious and difficult here. Consider what separates Georgeââblond, spiritlessâ¦ and faintly handsomeââfrom Tom (hint: $$).\n\nMyrtle is described differently, howeverâshe is a âfaintly stoutâ woman with âperceptible vitalityâ. This may be less of a description of her and more of a commentary on Tomâs sexuality, and what attracts him to her such that he cheats on Daisy with her. Still, Myrtleâs relative poverty is evident in her expressions of desire throughout their meetingââI want to get one of those dogs,â she says, and Tom just hands her the money.\n\nUltimately, looking at the novel through the lens of class, we see a society where upward social mobility and making a living for yourself is possible, just not for everybody. Even when you get rich, it doesnât guarantee that youâll suddenly, seamlessly integrate into the lives of old money.Â\n\nMorality and values\n\nAdded to this story of social stratification is a moral dimension, where Fitzgerald can be a little more critical.Â\n\nFirstly, old money is portrayed as shallow. Daisyâs marriage to Tom and the Sloanesâ insincerity are elements of this, but another good example is Gatsbyâs party guests. Many arenât actually invitedâthey invite themselves, and âthey came and went without having met Gatsby at all.â Their vacuous relationship to Gatsby is exposed when he dies, and they completely abandon him. Klipspringer, âthe boarderâ, basically lived in Gatsbyâs house, and even then he still wouldnât come to the funeral, only calling up to get a âpair of shoesâ back.Â\n\nThe rich are also depicted as cruel and inconsiderate, insulated from repercussions by their wealth. Nickâs description of Tomâs âcruel bodyâ is repeatedly realised, as he breaks Myrtleâs nose in chapter two and condescends Gatsby with âmagnanimous scornâ in chapter seven. After Myrtle dies, Nick spots the Buchanans âconspiringâ and describes them as âsmash[ing] up things and creatures and then retreat[ing] back into their money or their vast carelessnessââhe sees them as fundamentally selfish.\n\nGatsby is portrayed more sympathetically though, which may come from his humble upbringing and his desire to be liked. This is probably the key question of the novelâis he a hero, or a villain? The moral of the story, or a warning? Consumed by love, or corrupted by wealth?\n\nIâm going to leave most of those for the next section, but Iâll finish here with one last snippet: Lucille, a guest at his parties, tears her dress and Gatsby immediately sends her a ânew evening gownâ. Weird flex, but at least heâs being selflessâ¦\n\nHonesty\n\nThat said, a major part of Gatsbyâs character is his dishonesty, which complicates his moral identity.Â\n\nFor starters, he fabricates a new identity and deals in shady business just to reignite his five-year-old romance with Daisy. We see this through the emergence of Meyer Wolfsheim, with whom he has unclear business âgonnegtionsâ, and the resultant wealth he now enjoys.Â\n\nIn chapter three, Owl Eyes describes Gatsby as a âregular Belascoâ, comparing him to a film director who was well-known for the realism of his sets. This is a really lucid analysis of Gatsby, who is in many ways just like a film director constructing a whole fantasy world.\n\nItâs also unclear if he loves Daisy for who she is, or just the idea of Daisy and the wealth she represents. Indeed, he doesnât seem to treat her as a person, but more like something that he can pursue (like wealth). This is a good read, so I wonât really get into it hereâjust consider how much things have changed since Gatsby first met Daisy (like her marriage and her children), and how Gatsby ignores the way her life has changed in favour of his still, stationary memory of who she used to be.\n\nLove, desire and hope\n\nAll of this makes it tricky to distil what the novelâs message actually is.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby is a good person, especially cast against the corrupt old money?Â\n\nThis analysis isnât wrong, and it actually works well with a lot of textual evidence. Where Nick resents the Buchanans, he feels sympathy for Gatsby. He explicitly says, âtheyâre a rotten crowdâ¦youâre worth the whole damn bunch put together.â Maybe love was an honourable goal compared to money, which ostensibly makes you âcruelâ and âcarelessâ.Â\n\nI wouldnât say he was cruel, but this reading is complicated by how he can be careless, choosing not to care about Daisyâs agency, and letting his desires overtake these considerations.Â\n\nIs it that Gatsby and his desire for Daisy were corrupted by wealth despite his good intentions?Â\n\nThereâs also evidence to suggest wealth corruptsâNick describes it as âfoul dustâ that âpreyedâ on Gatsby, eroding his good character and leaving behind someone who resembles the vacuous elite. Although love mightâve been an honourable goal, it got diluted by money.Â\n\nGatsbyâs paradigm for understanding the world becomes driven by materialism, and he objectifies Daisy. He starts trying to buy something that he originally didnât need to buyâDaisyâs love. She certainly didnât fall in love with this man who owned a mansion and a closet full of âbeautiful shirts.â Thus, Gatsby is a sympathetic product of a system that was always stacked against him (a poor boy from North Dakota). Capitalism, right?\n\nIs it that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nWellâ¦\n\nPast the basics: structural economic tension and the doomed American Dream\n\nNow we want to start thinking beyond the characters (e.g. if Gatsby is a good person or not) and also factor in their social, historical, political and economic context (e.g. if he was doomed to begin with by a society driven by money). This subheading does sound a bit much, but weâll break it down here.Â\n\nA key part of this novel is the American Dream, the idea that America is a land of freedom and equal opportunity, that anyone can âmake itâ if they truly try. Value is placed on upward social mobility (moving up from a working-class background) and economic prosperity (making $$), which defined much of the Roaring 20sâ¦\n\nâ¦for some.Â\n\nFor many others, there was significant tension between these lofty values and their lived reality of life on the ground. As much as society around them was prospering, they just couldnât get a piece of the pie, and this is what makes it structuralâas hard as George Wilson might work, he just canât get himself out of the Valley of Ashes and into wealth. Indeed, you canât achieve the Dream without cheating (as Gatsby did).Â\n\nSo, thereâs this tension, this irreconcilable gap between economic goals and actual means. Through this lens, the tragedy of The Great Gatsby multiplies. Itâs no longer just about someone who canât buy love with moneyâitâs about how nobodyâs dreams are really attainable. Not everyone can get money, and money can only get you so far. Everyone is stuck, and the American Dream is basically just a myth.Â\n\nThus, the novel could be interpreted as a takedown of capitalist America, which convinced people like Gatsby that the answer to everything was money, and he bolted after the âgreen lightâ allure of cold, hard cash only to find out that it wasnât enough, that it wasnât the answer in the end.Â (.\n\nConsider what kind of message that sends to people like the Wilsonsâif money canât actually buy happiness, what good is it really to chase it? And remember that Gatsby had to cheat to get rich in the first place.Â\n\nIs [the novelâs message] that capitalist America provides nothing for people to pursue except for wealth, and therefore little reason for people to feel hope?\n\nYou tell me.\n\nPrompt: what does Fitzgerald suggest about social stratification in the 1920s?\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nLetâs try applying this to a prompt. Iâll italicise the key points that have been brought up throughout this post.Â\n\nFirstly, social stratification clearly divided society along economic lines. This could be paragraph one, exploring how class separated the Buchanans and Wilsons of the world, and how their lifestyles were so completely different even though they all lived in the prosperity of the Roaring 20s. George Wilson was âworn-outâ from work, but he still couldnât generate upward social mobility for his family, stuck in the Valley of Ashes. Conversely, Tom Buchanan is born into a rich family with his beach-facing mansion and polo ponies. Colour is an important symbol hereâthe Valley is grey, while East Egg is filled with colour (a green light here, a âblue coupeâ thereâ¦).\n\nThe next paragraph might look at the cultural dimension, exploring how you just canât buy a way of life. This might involve analysing Gatsbyâs wealth as deluding him into thinking he can ârepeat the pastâ by buying into the life(style) of old money. This is where Fitzgerald disillusions us about the American Dreamâhe presents a reality where it isnât possible for anyone to âmake itâ, where the Buchanans still treat you with scorn even if youâre just as wealthy. Gatsbyâs dishonesty is ultimately a shallow oneâtry as he might, he just cannot fit in and win Daisy back.\n\nFinally, we should consider the moral dimensionâeven though the wealthier socioeconomic classes enjoyed more lavish, luxurious lifestyles, Fitzgerald also argued that they were the most morally bankrupt. Money corrupted the wealthy to the point where they simply did not care about the lives of the poor, as seen in the Buchanansâ response to Myrtleâs death. Even Gatsby had to compromise his integrity and deal in shady business in order to get richâhe isnât perfect either. Social stratification may look ostentatious and shiny on the outside, but the rich are actually portrayed as shallow and corrupt.Â\n\nA good essay on this novel will typically combine some of these dimensions and build a multilayered analysis. Stratification, love, wealth, moralityâall of these big ideas can be broken down in terms of social, economic, cultural circumstances, so make sure to consider all angles when you write.Â\n\nHave a go at these prompts!\n\n1. Nick is biased in his assessment of Gatsbyâboth of them are no better than the corrupt, wealthy Buchanans. Do you agree?\n\n2. In The Great Gatsby, money is a stronger motivating factor than love. Do you agree?\n\n3. Daisy Buchanan is more innocent than guiltyâexplore this statement with reference to at least 2 other characters.Â\n\n4. What does Fitzgerald say about happiness in The Great Gatsby?\n\n5. Is money the true antagonist of The Great Gatsby?\n\n6. The women of The Great Gatsby are all victims of a patriarchal society. To what extent do you agree? (Hint: are they all equally victimised?)\n\nChallenge: According to Fitzgerald, what really lays underneath the faÃ§ade of the Roaring 20s? Make reference to at least 2 symbols in The Great Gatsby. (Hint: faÃ§ade = âan outward appearance that conceals a less pleasant realityâ â think about things like colours, clothes, buildings etc.)\n\nResources\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response\n\nHow To Write A Killer Text Response Study Guide\n\nHow to embed quotes in your essay like a boss\n\nHow to turn your Text Response essays from average to A+\n\n5 Tips for a mic drop worthy essay conclusion\n\nThe Importance of the Introduction\n\nHow Genre Works\n\nWeâre not supposed to judge a book based on its cover, but for some reason, we just canât help it. Sure, we may not be able to tell if weâre going to enjoy the book, nor can we tell what exactly itâs about, but we can tell the tone, set our expectations, and most importantly, guess at the genre. Look at these three book covers and note how they perfectly show their genres - Sci-Fi, Horror and Life Drama, respectively.Â\n\nGenre is a way of categorising media. We split books, film and music into genres in order to better talk about them and because humans have a strange desire to sort and categorise things. Within whatever medium, genres display certain structures, characters and tropes that audiences expect from that genre. Audiences like to be able to tell the genre of a text because itâs comfortable. If I go to see a superhero movie I expect wacky costumes, cliche dialogue and a final battle scene that the heroes win - were these expectations not to be met, I would likely be a little bit peeved off.Â\n\nBut why should you care about genre in VCE Literature? Itâs not on the study design?Â\n\nWell, not explicitly. In each AoS of the study design, you must engage with âthe ways the literary forms, features and language of texts affect the making of meaningâ, and/or âthe ideas of a text and the ways in which they are presentedâ. Genres are a feature of texts and are one of the ways that a text will present its ideas. Horror is the most notable example of a genre that uses its tropes to send a message - It Follows is a horror where the monster stands in for sexually transmitted disease, Carrie uses horror to show the horrors of high school, Frankenstein is a criticism of those who would âplay godâ. In the Literature study design, the horror genre is represented by Bram Stokerâs 1897 masterpiece, Dracula. Â\n\nFor an overview of the Literature study design, check out The Ultimate Guide to VCE Literature.Â\n\nDracula + The Gothic\n\nI invite you to think hard about the horror films youâve seen and to try to place Dracula into our modern view of horror. Itâs hard to put Stokerâs vampire on the same stage as the Babadook, Annabelle or even the â70s slasher craze. This gives us an incredible opportunity to consider how audiences engaged and continue to engage with genres. In order to analyse genre, it is essential to recognise what the audienceâs expectations were of a genre, and how the author has utilised those expectations for their own ends. Letâs consider Dracula in context.\n\nâDracula is a horror novel. But, we usually donât think about those uptight Victorians reading texts that were designed expressly to scare. The Victorian era was actually one of the golden ages of horror literature though. But, it is distinctly different from our modern understandings of horror as defined by trailblazers like Stephen King. So, why is it different? It is here we must consider the sub-genre. If you have read anything about Dracula, youâll note that it is referred to as a âgothic horrorâ. The gothic genre of literature encapsulates some of the 19th century and certainly the Victorian periodâs (1837-1901) best literature. Dracula of course belongs to this group, but it blows up around 1818 with Mary Shellyâs Frankenstein. Edgar Allen Poe, with his short stories and poetry, is widely lauded as the âFather of American Gothicâ, with âThe Fall of the House of Usherâ published in 1839. Note the dates here. Stoker published Dracula in 1897, a good 79 years after Frankenstein began haunting readers. Which means he had an established and large genre to work with. So, how did Stoker use the gothic in Dracula?\n\nTropes of the Gothic\n\n1) The Gothic Monster\n\nThe vampire myth used by Stoker is turned into the quintessential gothic monster. Dracula existed in the Victorian mind alongside Frankesteinâs monster, Mr. Hyde, and Poeâs mixture of humans made monstrous and surreal monsters like that in âThe Masque of the Red Deathâ. The defining feature of the gothic monster is its role in the story as a representation of something wrong with society, whether itâs increasingly amoral medicinal science, human greed or perverted desire.Â\n\n2) The Creepy Castle\n\nThe creepy castle doesnât have to be a castle. It can be a mansion, a university or the graveyards of London. The important thing is that the setting of the gothic novel should always be - by default - terrifying and evoke a sense of danger. You can never get comfortable in Draculaâs castle, nor in Sewardâs asylum, and neither can the characters.Â\n\n3) Damsel/s in Distress\n\nFor sure an outdated trope, but a constant in the gothic. Itâs a quick and simple way to show that the innocence of young women is threatened by a malignant force. In Dracula, look to Mina, Lucy and Mrs. Westenra. But what happens when the damsel saves herself?\n\n4) Omens, Portents, Visions\n\nVisions in dreams? Random wild animals escaping from ships? Ships docking with a completely dead crew? Random changes in the weather? You might be dealing with a gothic villain, or going mad. In either case, Renfield, Dracula, Mina and Jonothan all deal with portents and visions.Â\n\nAnd This Is Important Becauseâ¦\n\nStoker has followed the predominant tropes of the gothic horror genre. Why is this important for our analysis of Dracula? The ways in which authors use genre and other stylistic elements like form, voice or plot relate directly to their intentions. If we investigate the particular aspects of Stokerâs use of the gothic, we may better understand the views and values that he is promoting. For instance, letâs take Dracula as the gothic monster. Since the gothic monster is always a way to reflect society back onto itself, how is Stoker doing that? A feminist analysis might take Dracula as a reflection of sexual deviancy, which then ties into his constant threat towards women. A post-colonial analysis might question the foreignness of Dracula, and view him as a part of the intrusiveness of foreigners in English society. Either way, youâre touching on a view or value presented by Stoker, and tying it to an aspect of the gothic genre in a way that conveniently also touches on characterisation.Â\n\nLetâs complicate things a little more. The âDamsel in Distressâ trope is clearly evident in Dracula, but what view or value is Stoker commenting on by its inclusion? The simplest answer is that, by showing that women cannot save themselves, Stoker is saying that women are inherently weak and need to be saved by men. But this answer isnât sufficient for a number of reasons. Firstly, what are the women weak to? Is it a physical mismatch between the women and Dracula, keeping in mind that Dracula is also stronger than the novelâs men? Or is it a symbolic weakness to some aspect of Draculaâs character, be it sexuality or magic? Secondly, and more importantly, are all the women victimised by Dracula the same? Well, obviously not.Â\n\nIt could very well be argued that Stoker is subverting the âDamsel in Distressâ trope by actually giving us a woman who is able to be her own saviour (which is actually becoming a trope in itself nowadays!). The dichotomy between Lucy and Mina is a crucial aspect of the text, and the way that Minaâs character doesnât quite fit into the âDamsel in Distressâ archetype is a major interpretative dilemma. By considering the genre tropes, Lucy is clearly a âDamsel in Distressâ who cannot save herself and is unduly victimised by Dracula. It can be argued that her implicit promiscuousness is punished through her murder, but in whatever case, she is distressed and must be saved. Mina, however, has an entirely different view of her distresses. Not only does Mina take on a caring role towards Jonothan - in which Jonothan becomes a âMaster in Distressâ - she actively supports the attempts to save her and kill Dracula. By compiling the journals, letters and newspaper clippings into the epistolary that we the audience are reading, and using herself as a window into Draculaâs mind through their psychic connection, Mina proves to be a means by which to save herself from her distress. So, the question of what Stoker actually thinks about women is still quite open: Lucy is seemingly punished for her character flaws, which indicates a misogynist view of womenâs sexuality, but Mina is praised for her use of masculine qualities like leadership and stoicism. Is Stoker saying women should be more masculine? Less masculine and more traditionally feminine? This entire discussion revolves around how and why the âDamsel in Distressâ trope is being followed or subverted.Â\n\nUsing Genre in VCE\n\nWhilst a genre-based analysis (or a structural analysis) can be a fantastic way to open up discussion and leads to important questions about views and values, the way I have presented it may appear to be another useless and long-winded thing you have to try to shove into an essay when you already have to balance so much in Literature! Fear not, because there are a couple of really easy ways to fit genre into essays without taking up loads of space.\n\nOption one is to use a genre trope as the basis of a paragraph. If your essay contention is thatâ¦\n\nââStoker presents the dangers of foreign immigration to England at the height of its colonial empireâ\n\nâ¦then you can easily write a paragraph discussing thatâ¦\n\nââStoker employs the gothic trope of a supernatural monster in Dracula, using this vampire as a stand-in for foreigners in Englandâ.\n\nThis paragraph would discuss Draculaâs characterisation, and the settings of Transylvania and London, whilst investigating Stokerâs views on Englandâs colonialism and race. In a Developing Interpretations or Close Analysis essay, youâve just touched on several key criteria, including the authorâs views and values, your own credible interpretation of the text and how the text presents its messaging (through characterisation and setting). You can do all these things without mentioning genre, but by explicitly using the language of genre analysis you are likely separating yourself from the student next to you - who had a similar idea but described it in a less interesting way. This is the utility of understanding genre, it gives you the words and concepts necessary to improve your writing and interpretation. The âGothic monsterâ is an easy way to describe an otherwise GIANT concept.\n\nAnother way is to add it to other analyses in passing. Instead of saying âDracula presents Lucy and Mina as foils to demonstrate the ways in which modern womenâs promiscuity is ultimately harmfulâ, you can say âthe presentation of Lucy and Mina as two âdamsels in distressâ in dichotomy with each other demonstrates the differing ways in which Victorian women could doom or save themselvesâ. The latter sentence has not significantly changed the content of the first, still referring to the womenâs opposition to each other, but by phrasing it with âdamsels in distressâ I leave open the possibility of discussing not just Lucyâs promiscuity, but also Minaâs conservative womanhood.Â\n\nFinally, you need not even mention genre or its tropes in the essay, just use it as a thinking tool. If you go back through the previous section of this blog, youâll see just how many questions I am asking about the tropes and ideas I am discussing. By using the trope as a jumping-off point for a series of questions, I can develop a nuanced understanding of multiple views and values and the ways in which they interconnect. Take a trope like the âcreepy castleâ and ask:\n\nâWhy would Stoker put Dracula manor in the text?â\n\nâBecause it sets up the âothernessâ of Dracula.â\n\nâWhy do we need to know that Dracula is the other?âÂ\n\nâBecause he represents a supernatural foreignness that we need to be scared of.â\n\nâOkay, but why is it right at the start, why is it from Jonothanâs perspective?âÂ\n\nAll of these questions offer ways of breaking down the text and they will naturally lead to questions about structure, characterisation and views and values. In doing this, you can start to come up with ways to turn those questions, or the order of those questions into an essay structure. Moreso, this type of questioning is what your teacher, tutors and top-tier Literature students are doing. It is a constant process of asking, answering, reconsidering, reasking and synthesising. And genre is an easy way to start the process.Â\n\nPlans are one of the most ignored (and underestimated) steps in the essay writing process. Some people donât do them simply because they donât want to, some sacrifice them because they think theyâll run out of time, and some do âplansâ, but in reality, theyâre only a rough mental outline. Each of these situations place too many students time and time again in sticky situations come an English SAC or exam.\n\nWhy plans are essential for any good essay\n\nThey ensure that you canât mind blank â itâs all on the paper in front of you!\n\nThey ensure that you always stay on topic.\n\nMental plans or not having a plan at all mean that you donât have a true direction in which your essay is going. If youâre not sure where youâre going, well, how are you going to get anywhere?\n\nThey save you time in writing time. Â\n\nInstead of wasting reading time, youâve done most of your thinking right at the beginning of the SAC or exam, positioning you to do really well in your essay because you can focus on constructing some really juicy, coherent analysis in your body paragraphs, rather than remembering your basic points and/or making sure your essay is actually answering the question.\n\nLetâs have a look at an essay topic that Iâve tackled in the past. This one is based on Kate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant, a current VCE Year 12 English text. To learn more about themes, quotes, characters about this text, and to have a look at an essay topic breakdown, check out this blog post written by outstanding LSG tutor, Angelina!\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â How does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStep 1: Highlight key words\n\nNow, it may seem like I've just highlighted the whole prompt, and I understand why you might think that! However, each of the words highlighted convey something meaningful within the prompt. If you're ever unsure about what could be considered a key word, consider whether the prompt would have the same meaning without the word in question.\n\nStep 2: Define key words\n\nIn this topic, the main phrase that needs defining is âconflict of conscienceâ. For me, this signals that we must consider morality and the weighing up of right and wrong, especially when tough decisions have to be made.\n\nIâd also take a moment to analyse the quote. This essay prompt is quote-based, so itâs imperative that we discuss the quote and consider the meaning of the quote throughout our essay. For some more detailed info on how to tackle different types of essay prompts, check out this blog post.\n\nStep 3: Start essay plan\n\nNext, Iâd start tackling the plan itself. Although it seems like the above steps would take a while, my real-life planning process only takes about 5 minutes. You certainly donât have to write everything down and you certainly donât have to make it make sense to anyone but yourself.\n\nPersonally, I like to format my plans in dot-point form. I write 1, 2, 3 for each of my body paragraphs and I leave a space underneath each so I can plan each paragraph.\n\nFirst, Iâll just write rough topic sentences under each, so I can really step back and consider whether my plan of action for the essayâs body paragraphs will do a good job at answering the prompt itself. Again, these are only rough topic sentences â fancying them up will come during the essay writing phase.\n\nStep 4: Important things to include in each paragraph\n\nOnce Iâve decided on what each of my body paragraphs will be about, I can them go into a bit more depth for each of them individually.\n\nThese are the elements that I include for each:\n\nIdeas\n\nEssentially, the points that Iâll argue and the reasoning behind the paragraph\n\nQuotes\n\nThe evidence that Iâll be using to reinforce my point(s).\n\nLiterary devices/metalanguage\n\nIn Year 12, I made a conscious effort to include one literary device or metalanguage example per body paragraph in all of my English essays. This really set me apart from the rest of the state because, in reality, not enough students really focused on the language of their texts, which can really impress examiners.\n\nStrategy: Colour-coded plans\n\nFor me, using different colours in my plans helped me organise my thoughts, distinguish between them, and ensure that I had covered everything that I wanted to cover.\n\nObviously, you can come up with a colour system that works for you, but this is what I came up with:\n\nGreen = metalanguage\n\nRed = quotes\n\nBlack/blue = everything else!\n\nAnd thatâs it â my four-step but five minute essay planning process. Donât be afraid to modify this to make it work for you and your needs. However, definitely DO be afraid of not planning â itâs absolutely essential for any good essay.\n\nHappy planning!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys. I've been doing a load of essay topic breakdowns for you guys, and we've been looking at plans for them, so I thought I would actually show you how I actually do a real life plan, one that I would do on paper if I was preparing for a SAC or an exam, as opposed to the ones that I do on YouTube because the ones that I do on YouTube are slightly different. I definitely go into more detail than I normally would. But at the same time I still do use the same concepts as I would when I do read the steps on YouTube. So I'm going to go and show you that today. And before I actually do that, I just want to preface this and tell you guys why doing a plan is so important.\n\nSo I know that a plan is something that one, a lot of people just don't do, or two, they tend to sacrifice it if they feel like they don't have enough time, or three, they do a plan in their head, but they don't actually write it down on paper. Now, all of these things are pretty detrimental for you, especially because when you write a plan, it actually helps to secure you and ensure that one, you're not going to mind blank throughout your essay or let me rephrase that, if you do mind blank throughout your essay, you will still have a piece of paper in front of you telling you, \"This is what you were thinking Lisa, just go and follow this method or what you've written down here.\" So that way you don't just get stuck in the middle of your essay and start having a freak out because you've forgotten what you were supposed to write.\n\nSecond thing is that it ensures that you don't go off topic. This is something that happens quite frequently. If you don't have a plan, then you have this idea of, \"Oh, I'll write this and this\", and then somehow halfway through an essay, halfway through a paragraph, you realize, \"Holy crap, I have completely veered off the topic or this has gone completely in the other direction from what I intended. This is not what I wanted.\" So in order to prevent that from happening, just do a plan, please! You will find that it ends up saving you so much time and it just gives you that reassurance that you need in situations where there are so many unpredictable factors, like what prompts you're actually going to get. And your focus and attention should be more about developing those ideas, rather than having a mind blank in the middle of your essay and then having a little bit of a freakout as a result.\n\nSo I'm going to base this video on a previous essay topic breakdown in the past, and that is on Kate Grenville's The Lieutenant. I was going to say Lieutenant, because I always accidentally say that, but no, it is Lieutenant. Now, if you are not doing as text as always, don't stress about it because what I want you to take away from this video is how you actually do plans, the thinking that goes behind it and the formatting around it. So let's just get started.\n\nThe essay topic that we're doing today is, \"But a man could not travel along two different paths.\" How does Grenville explore Rooke's conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant. So as always, my first step is I will highlight the keywords that I see inside the prompt. Keywords are different for everyone, but these are the ones that I think are most important.\n\nFirstly, the actual quote itself, how Grenville, conflict of conscience. Pretty much in this case I could probably just highlight the entire thing, but for the sake of just defining some keywords, this is what I would do. So the next step is to define key words. I think the only big key word that I need to define here is conflict of conscience. And so to me, the conflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we'll need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and sides need to be taken. So as you can see, I've written these words down next to the keyword and that will just help me ensure that I stay on topic or I stay in tune with what the keyword is about and I don't suddenly change my mind halfway through the essay.\n\nThen what I'll do is, I will analyze the quote itself. So this is unique because this particular essay prompt has a quote inside it, but I'll have to think about, okay, where did I see this quote? Who might've said it and what might it mean? And I'll draw it down a few notes for that. Then I'll pretty much just go straight into my plan. Now, my plans I've written within five minutes, most of the thinking is actually done during reading time. So personally, I've always found that just writing dot points is completely fine. I don't need to go more beyond that. And I'll show you a few examples now of real life year essay plans that I did during that time. And as you can see, they are pretty much just scribbles and if anybody else was to look at my essay plans, they would have no idea what I'm talking about. But you know what, for me it makes complete sense and that's all that matters. You're not graded on your plan, so just go ahead and do it your way. You do you.\n\nSo what I'll do is I'll quickly dot down one, two, three, and these represent my body paragraphs. Then I'll just write down very quickly what the topic sentences will be. I don't actually write the full topic sentence itself, but I guess the essence of it, so the key things that I will mention in the topic sentence. By writing down the three topic sentences, this allows me to take a step back and look at the essay holistically and ensure that I am answering it the way that I want to. Then what I'll do is I'll move into each individual body paragraph and write down some things that I think are important for me to remember when I go ahead and write it. So I might write down a couple of ideas that I think are important. I will write down quotes that I think are essential to my discussion. And then what I'll do is I will throw in at least one literary device or a metalanguage that I think is important to discuss.\n\nSo in this case, in this first body paragraph, it's limited omniscient third person perspective. By throwing this in, I will ensure that I can show my examiner or show my teacher that I can go on that deeper level. I'll repeat this method with both paragraph two and three. Of course for you, you might need to write down more dot points. You can write fewer dot points, it's really just dependent on every individual. If you are somebody who needs to write down the quotes more, then go ahead and do that. But for me, a lot of the quotes will stick in my head. I just need one point just to bounce off, and then from there, I'm able to pull in all of the other quotes that are necessary.\n\nYou also notice that I do things in different colors. Now, I think this is a strategy that I implemented in order to make things a lot clearer for myself before jumping into an essay. So for example, for anything that's a metalanguage based, I'll write it in green. The whole purpose for that is to ensure that in every single body paragraph, I do cover some form of a literary device because that was always really important for me. I thought that it was one of the key things that helped me differentiate myself from other students. So if I took a step back from the plan and I looked at it overall, I could see, okay, there's a green color in every single body paragraph, done. I have ticked off that criteria.\n\nI also used to write quotes in red as well. So red just helped me do the same thing. It helps me take a step back and go, \"Yep, there's a bit of red in every single body paragraph. I'm definitely including quotes,\" which might sound pretty stupid, but it's just that little bit of reassurance that I think really makes that difference when it comes to a stressful situation.\n\nThat's pretty much it. It's just five minutes of your time, so we probably don't need to go into it in too much more detail than that. But as you can see from my essay plans, I'm quite minimal. I just keep things as short as possible because that's all I really need because a lot of the information is here, but I just need to reinforce it and ensure that it is concrete when it is on paper.\n\nSo for yourself, I would recommend that you start practicing your plans. You can try my method and see if that works for you, but over time, I'm sure that you'll come to find your own way of writing plans that work for you.\n\nNext week I'm going to have another essay topic breakdown for you. Can you guess what it might be? If you want to take a stab, put it in the comment section below, but that's it for me in this week guys. I hope that was helpful for you, and don't forget plans are crucial to an amazing essay.\n\nIf you needed any extra help, then my mailing list is always available for you guys. I send out emails every single week just giving you new advice and tips for your studies, so I'll put that in the description box below for you to sign up. Other than that, I will talk to you guys next week. Bye!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFor a detailed guide on Language Analysis including how to prepare for your SAC and exam, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Language Analysis.\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription 1]\n\nHey guys. Can you believe it is November already? Holy cow. Time flies so quickly. All my Year 12s have finished now, so if you're still here with me ... you must be in Year 11 or below, or you could be a Year 12 that's already finished, but you still enjoy my videos. I'm on to you.\n\nIf you didn't know already, I do have a personal YouTube channel. So head on over there if you guys have finished the year for English because I'd still really love to stay in contact with you.\n\nI've previously done this segment before and when I started it, everyone fell in love with it. So I created the segment a while ago now, and I have done one article... Actually it was two articles so far. If you haven't looked at those ones, I'd recommend you go ahead and check it out.\n\nBut this one, I'm going to do a 2001 analyzing argument article. The reason why I choose really old articles is because I feel like the more recent ones you probably end up doing at school, or you will probably do it in your own time. If not, you've probably already done it. That's why I want to leave those ones to you guys, maybe eventually I'll get up to it. But I want to be able to show you guys a little bit more, so that's why I choose really old ones, but it's still relevant to the course. Don't think that just because it's done in 2001, which is forever ago, what, were you born there? Oh, my gosh. I just realized that some of you could have, yeah.\n\nAnyways, the aim of today is just to go through the article, try to identify what the language techniques are and understand how they are persuasive or at least how the author intends them to persuade the audience. Actually, down the track we will talk more about structure, more at looking at arguments, that type of thing. But the goal here is more just about identification and understanding language techniques. So let's just get started.\n\nWith this particular one, you'll see that it is on a website, so you could analyze that in itself. But since I don't have it in front of me, I'm not going to, and I'm just going to look at the actual article itself.\n\n\"Keep healthy the informed way. Get in early. Get your Medi-Info card today.\" Automatically this might appeal to readers because it's saying \"Keep healthy the informed way,\" as though if they don't take onboard whatever this person is recommending them, then they won't be informed and so they're missing out on something. There's also this sense of urgency, \"Get in early.\"\n\n\"All of the world health professionals and their patients are waking up to the possibilities of the Medi-Info, MI Card.\" So \"All over the world\" is indicative of a global profile so this indicates that if it's good enough for the rest of the world, then surely it must be good enough for Australians like you and me. So that may invite readers to jump on-board with whatever this Medi-Info Card is about.\n\n\"Health professionals and their patients.\" \"Health professionals and their patients\" goes to show that if these people are recommending it and they are embracing the card, such as doctors or dentists or physiotherapists, then it's a really fantastic endorsement about that card and the product and what it's worth. Therefore, we should also support the product, too, either that could fall under the fact that they have credentials and so we trust them.\n\n\"Waking up to the possibility.\" So \"possibilities\" definitely has positive connotations. It's this idea of endless potential and so there is a lot to be gained from the card.\n\n\"Driven by breakthrough technology, the microchip-powered and credit-sized Medi-Info Card contains the info that carers and patients need to have now, on the spot, on time, on the screen.\" So \"breakthrough technology\" itself, \"microchip-powered,\" they both indicate that this idea is cutting-edge. For us, this may persuade readers because there's this idea that the latest tech often means the most effective or it's most likely to enhance your living.\n\nThe fact that it's credit-sized means that it is also portable. It's lightweight. What do you think this could mean for readers? It's user-friendly. How does this persuade them? It could persuade a person to adopt this card and take it on-board because it seems like it's convenient, it's easy to use. And it's not going to be a burden on them because all they need to do is really just throw it into their wallet.\n\nNow \"on the spot, on time, on screen\" really seems to push the idea of what do you think? Sorry, if it's out of focus. It's because I'm not looking at the camera. It could appeal to our desire to have things instantaneously. We're in the generation where things pop up in our face all the time, like notifications, shipping happens overnight. We just want things straightaway. So it could be that, but also this idea that this card is available any time and the information is accessible for you 24/7 so it's convenient. So I'll put that in below as well.\n\n\"This is the ultimate cool techno accessory.\" Okay. \"Cool techno\" itself is a bit of slang, or you could say that it's colloquial language to try to appeal to readers who may be interested in the latest tech, or people who want to keep up with the trend or the latest fashion accessories, for example. But there's this added benefit, it will actually save your life.\n\nThen this person moves on to say, \"Imagine you have an accident and are taken to hospital. Without the MI card in your wallet, can you be sure that vital information won't be missed? Think what the card might reveal.\" \"Imagine itself\" is a hypothetical situation. It's trying to get readers to see that the MI is a valuable tool. It has benefits that readers just cannot ignore and just between you and me, it could also appeal to our sense of FOMO. FOMO is not something that you would write into your essay itself, but there's this fear that if you don't have it, well, then what could potentially happen? It could be really bad.\n\nSo then there's all these dot points about what the card reveals, so it's those features, that for you, it comes back to the idea that all of these are the benefits that you can have. You can have also reassurance as a result because you know that all your information is there. People can access it when they need to, or when you're in times of need so then that in itself could relate to this idea of safety or comfort.\n\n\"All this and more can be downloaded fast from your MI Card. No forms to fill in. No stressful interviews about your medical history. No gaps because you're too stressed to remember your health details or insurance information.\" Okay. This idea that it can be downloaded fast is, again, convenient. It's not going to take up too much of your time. It's going to be really quick as well.\n\n\"No forms, no stressful interviews,\" so these two together will eliminate any of your negative experiences that you've previously had working with health professionals or the health sector. There's this idea of this simple, straightforward approach and this idea that there are no gaps, either. You might be fearful that because you're not providing all the information that you have because you just don't know it, then maybe you won't get the right type of treatment or people won't be able to look after you properly. But in this case, there's this sense of security that you'll be looked after.\n\n\"And there's more. It can even show you that in the event of your death, you want to live on as an organ donor.\" Organ donor itself has positive connotations. Everybody knows that if you're an organ donor, wow, you're very selfless and you're very giving, so this is like an added bonus that can make you feel better as a person. \"You could give someone else the chance of a new life.\" If you're able to do this, it puts you in power, so you could say that you feel empowered as a result.\n\n\"What about security?\" All of this section here maybe you could say specifically appeal to an audience who might be more concerned about security and about the information being put online or into this tool.\n\nThen the rest of it, it's pretty straightforward as well. It'll work pretty much anywhere, so this idea that you're always going to be covered. \"You can trust our technology. Get the Medi-Card Info today. Keep healthy the informed way,\" and then the rest of it, \"Send in your stories of medical emergencies.\"\n\nBecause I just want to keep this short, I think I'll leave it there. You could say that with this part, there's this very enthusiastic tone that's carried through the entire thing. Okay, cool. So I am just going to leave it there. I hope that was helpful to some extent, just to get you started and to get you thinking about some of the language techniques that might be there.\n\nHow did you guys go? I would actually really love to hear what kind of language techniques you found in the comment section below. But if you've got any questions for me, then please leave them as well because I know I haven't gone into this in immense detail, but yeah, hopefully you're able to walk away and learn something from it.\n\nSo if you like this type of thing, don't forget, I have an online course that's called How To Achieve A Plus In A Language Analysis? There's lots and lots of information there and videos that are around five hours long for you. Around 300 students have taken the course and it's rated something like 4.5 and above, so hopefully that's a good indication that it is actually really helpful.\n\nSo next week when I see you guys, we're going to go into part two, the article where it's about the family doctor. So I'd encourage you guys to go and analyze that yourself, and then let's reconvene next Friday and work through it. Hopefully this will prepare you guys in Year 11 for your end-of-year exam. Bye guys!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription 2]\n\nHey guys, so welcome back to part two. If you were here last week, then you know that I have already analyzed part one article for you and now we're moving into part two. You can just download the PDF for this language analysis article just down below in the description box, but let's just get started. Okay, so, \"I am a doctor with over 35 years experience.\" So automatically this doctor is establishing his credentials. So with credentials, it usually means that as an audience, we are impressed and we are respectful of this person and trust their opinion, especially if it's 35 years. \"I know what it is to be called to a local school in an emergency and find a child suffering from asthma, unable to tell me what medication has previously been prescribed. I know what it is to see older patients, day after day who experienced wariness and confusion in trying to remember all the medication they are taking.\"\n\nSo when he says, \"I know what it is,\" these are first hand experiences. It shows, again, and compounds on the idea that this guy is indeed experienced in the field and we should trust anyone, I guess, we should kind of trust the doctor, right, because he's exposed to this type of stuff every single day. It also shows that he is empathetic, which is a great quality to see in a doctor, because he seems to suffer as well when his patients are suffering. So with that in mind, as an audience, we are more inclined to like him and to value his opinion because he has directly been impacted as a result. When he talks about a child with asthma, it's a very interesting scenario to choose, he could have talked about anyone, he decides to talk about a child.\n\nSo potentially what this could do is appeal to a particular audience, for example, it could be parents, it could be other people suffering asthma, for example. But let's say if we're parents, generally we're... I say, we like I'm a parent, I'm not a parent. But we're protective towards young people, and you want to remove them from needless suffering as a result. Again, \"Those who experienced weariness and confusion,\" potentially that could appeal to the elderly. So, if you're somebody who's older and you're starting to experience the fact that you're getting a little bit confused or you're forgetting things, then this might really appeal to you and speak to you because it could be the answer that you're looking for.\n\n\"I recently heard about the pain and distress of a patient who suffered an epileptic fit while far from home. Unfortunately, everyone around him, unaware that he had mild fits, assumed he was drunk and ignored him.\" So this part here, like recalling a story, it shows the unfairness of the situation. That this person who was having epileptic fit, would have a much more positive outcome should he have had an MI card. And we feel sorry for him because nobody should have to experience their illness and be alienated or judged on by the community or by the public. So as a result, we may be encouraged to go out there and get our own and MI card or recommend our friends or family who we know are, who may be suffering from illnesses to get an MI card. \"We can all sympathize with this lad\", so that itself is quite easy. What is it, guys? Inclusive language.\n\nSo if you don't know already, inclusive language engages the audience because it encourages them to feel included and responsible in whatever the author is talking about, so we feel like there's something that we can do in this case. \"This lad,\" that's quite colloquial, why do you think he does that? So maybe it shows that this doctor isn't just a doctor who's distant and unfeeling, but he sees us, patients, as people and as friends, people that he cares about. And so, again, we're more inclined to listen to this doctor because we see him in a positive light. \"He can no longer feel confident when he goes out.\" So this is, again, like so unfair, nobody should go out and feel like they can't be confident. If this is something that's taken away from the person, but a Medi-Info Card could help relieve them of that, then maybe they should do it, maybe we should stop advocating for MI cards.\n\n\"We can all sympathize,\" do you guys know what that is? Generalization. Generalization is when it's indicated that everyone agrees, like we can all sympathize because if you don't seem like you sympathize, well then you're kind of that a-hole in the corner that's like being rude and not caring while everyone else is. So of course you're kind of more inclined to want to agree and sympathize and therefore support MI card. \"As a doctor,\" so yet again, that kind of goes back to like the credentials.\n\n\"I know that in emergency, he would have been given vital help he required immediately.\" So this sense of instantaneous, there's no waiting involved, everything happens straight away. So we can trust Medi-Info, it's going to do its job at making sure that people are well looked after. \"All Australians,\" same thing, generalization. \"Young or old, sick or well, bush or city, close,\" so this starts to appeal that to lots of different people. \"Lives that are free from anxiety,\" so appeals to their sense of freedom or this idea that this person couldn't feel confident anymore. We don't want them to go out there and feel anxious either, right?\n\nYou can see from all the different lines and where they're going, that I try to make connections to other parts of the article as I go through the piece, because I think it's really important to be able to look at things on more holistic scale than rather just one thing on a micro level. This means that you're able to better understand the contention, as well as the arguments that the author uses to build up that contention.\n\nSo let's finish this one off, \"The Medi Card doesn't waste people's time,\" for people who are very conscious of their time and want to be productive, it could appeal to them. \"Safe and secure,\" excellent, so we know that. We spoke about this last time with the MI, giving you security and comfort. And also you can also say that there's alliteration here, it's just as a side note though, I would much rather you guys talk about security and safety and how that appeals to people.\n\nAnd \"My work as a doctor would improve,\" I mean, if you really wanted to, you could even like put that together with as a doctor, and then it goes back to credentials. \"If I had more time to talk to my patients, they would be improved.\" Duh, duh, duh. Cool. \"To me, your Medi-Info Card means peace of mind for everyone.\" Okay, so what do you guys think of that? I'm not going to analyze it, I'm going to ask you guys to analyze it and put it down in the comment section below for me. So with this one, I analyzed a lot, but I'm sure there's still heaps more that I haven't quite looked at. And so I want you guys to put down in the comments below, what are the different types of analyses that you've pulled from this article, let's share around and help each other out.\n\nThe more we can collaborate and work together, the more we can lift each other up. So if you needed more help with analyzing arguments, you guys can definitely check out my study guide where I have an entire section, which covers everything from how to analyze, language technique list, structure, high response essays, low response essays, so you can see the difference and everything is annotated for you in those essays so that you understand why they actually did well or not so well. So that's it from me, I will see you guys next Friday, and chat to you then. Bye!\n\n----\n\nIf you'd like a comprehensive explanation of everything you need to know to ace your SAC or exam, check out our How To Write A Killer Language Analysis ebook.\n\nThe Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nWeâve explored creative writing criteria, literary elements and how to replicate the text over on ourThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Creative Writing blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to creative writing, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\nFor many students, writing creative pieces can be slightly daunting. For some, it is about unleashing the writer within as the boundaries and thematic constraints that exist inÂ Text Response are lifted. For others, it can be an opportunity to discover new writing styles, branching out from the generic T-E-E-L structure.\n\nFormats of imaginative pieces include:\n\nshort narratives,\n\na personal diary entry ,\n\nchronicling the character's thoughts,\n\nepilogues,\n\nscripts,\n\nand monologues.\n\nWriting in an imaginative style allows you to draw from your own morals, views and feelings. You can weave in personalÂ anecdotes, experiences, and metaphorical language which gives one's writing that pizazz and individualist factor!\n\nMoreover, you can showcase how you have perceived and interpreted the characters within the novel/film, the landscapes they inhabit. Alternatively, you can step into different personas. For example, for the topic of conflict, I canÂ write as an injured army medic, a doctor, a foreign correspondent and a war photographer.\n\nHowever, imaginative writing also has manyÂ pitfalls students tumble into (do not despair; you can get out of it!):\n\n1)Â Don't get too caught up in emotions and flowery language.\n\nGreat imaginative pieces are not only graded on how good your story telling skills are. More importantly, your teachers would be grading on the palpable links to the themes of the text and prompt you have been given.\n\nIn Year 11, when I wrote an imaginative piece, I went overboard with the flowery metaphorical language. My teacher said âOverall, the piece is good however, at some parts it sounded like purple prose.â When I read it over now, I shudder a little.\n\n2) In Reading and Creative, there isÂ greater emphasis on extrapolating themes and ideasÂ from your studied text.Â\n\nSo, those radical and out-of-the box ideas and views you have in relation to the text can now be used.\n\nFor example, the overarching themes inÂ Every Man In This Village Is AÂ LiarÂ encompass the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, inequality (the unequal status of women in Middle East), the effect of war on the physical body and the human psych and, how the media portrays war and violence.Â The starting point to planning any context piece is to useÂ quotes and ideas within your text.Â Infer meaning from those quotes and main ideas and ask yourself:\n\n'Does it hold a great degree of relevance to issues prevalent today?'\n\n'Can I link it to my sac/exam prompt?'Â\n\nSo, here's an example of planning a creative piece. Two of my favourite quotes fromÂ Life of GalileoÂ are:\n\n'Science is the rightful, much loved daughter of the church.'\n\nâOur ignorance is limitless; let us lop off a millimeter off it. Why try to be clever now that we at last have a chance of being less stupid.â\n\nIn essence, this conveys the overarching theme of science vs. religion, and how Church and the inquisition exploit the peoples' views through their own ignorance. Their fear of change, pioneering and gaining of new knowledge stems from the prospect of chaos if society's entrenched values are uprooted. I interpreted this as 'ignorance is not bliss' and instead, it breeds fear in people. This is in relevance with the tragic events that has occurred in recent years - acts of terrorism, and/or racially motivated attacks. In the context of our modern society, religion and science still maintain an intriguing andÂ tumultuousÂ relationship. As the advancement of technology and ethics are not at equilibrium, this is where controversy arises. Conversely, we now have to consider whether this relates to the prompt:\n\nA person never knows who they truly are, until tested by conflict.\n\nPossible idea for this example:\n\n\"Is it ethical to administer a new drug capable of rewiring and regenerating brain function at a neuronal level to someone who has sustained extensive brain damage? Is it deemed humane to potentially change a person's character? At what personal cost will this have? - Playing god.\"\n\nTips to achieve A+ in creative writing\n\n1. Ensure it is related to the text.\n\nA lot of students believe that the reading and creating essay is exactly the same as the old context essay. However, there is a significant difference! While a creative context essay does not have to link to the text in any way and only needs to explore a certain idea (e.g. encountering conflict), the reading and creating essay needs to offer a relevant interpretation of the text as well as show understanding of the textâs messages and how the text creates meaning.\n\nThe easiest way to write a creative response that links clearly to the text is to write about a scenario that is related to the plot line. You can do this by writing a continuation of the storyline (i.e. what happens after the end?), or by filling in gaps in the plot line which the author did not explicitly outline (what happens behind the scenes that caused the outcome?) In this way, your response will be completely original and still demonstrate an understanding of the world of the text.\n\n2. Write in a way that shows understanding of how the text creates meaning.\n\nWhen creating your response, be aware of the features present in your text (such as characters, narrative, motifs etc) that you can use in your own essay. For example, if the text is narrated from a first-person perspective, you may also mimic this in your essay. Or, you could tell it in first-person from another characterâs point of view to demonstrate another interpretation of the text. You may also include motifs from the text into your own response. But be careful when making decisions about structure, conventions and language. If the text is written in very formal and concise language, it is probably not a good idea to use slang. Similarly, if the text is a play, structuring your response as a script might be a better choice than writing a poem!\n\n3. Explore the explicit and implied ideas and values in the texts.\n\nLastly, remember that whilst it is a creative response, your purpose is NOT to tell a nice story but to explore the ideas, values and messages left by the author! There will always be various interpretations regarding these values, and you can express your understanding of the text through your portrayal of certain characters, or through the events in your response. For example, if you were studying Measure for Measure and wanted to explore how human nature cannot be restrained or limited by law and punishment, you could write a continuation of the play in which the city of Vienna has reverted to its original state of moral decay.\n\n4. Show, don't tell\n\nCreative essays are great because they offer interesting and unique stories; however, there is one common downfall that occurs in writing. Some students create pieces that areÂ tooÂ straightforward. Rather than using vocabulary, imagery and symbolism to express a point, they simply write down a statement that sums up what they wish to say. Your aim is to invite the reader toÂ experienceÂ the story through your words. This can be done through the characterâs thoughts, feelings, actions etc. Thus the well-known phrase among writers, âShow, donât tellâ. Keeping this idea in mind turn you into a much more successful writer â and youâll see the difference!\n\nExample 1\n\nTell: Katie was very happy.\n\nShow: Katieâs face lifted. Little wrinkles appeared around her bright eyes, her dimples made an appearance that dug into her cheeks as a big grin emerged to show her perfect teeth.\n\nExample 2\n\nTell: She felt horrible for the weeping children.\n\nShow: Guilt throbbed inside her as she stared at the weeping children. Her heart pounded against her chest, her hands trembling beside her still body, her brain screaming at her to doÂ something.\n\nExample 3\n\nTell: I was scared.\n\nShow: I hear my breathing; heavy, and rapid. I shut my eyes tightly. I can feel goosebumps running up my arms and down my back.\n\nTo test whether or not you are âtellingâ instead of âshowingâ, think about whether or not your sentence leaves room for questions. In Example 1, âKatie was very happyâ would leave the reader thinking â what thought or action showed that she was happy? Whereas âshowâ demonstrated that she was happy without directly stating it.\n\nThe key is to go into the finer details of your story!\n\nFinally, have fun and enjoy the process of planning a creative narrative, let your imagination run a little wild and rein it in with your knowledge! Hopefully these tips were helpful and you are now more confident and informed on the Reading and Creating response!Â\n\nThis blog post was written by Amanda Lau, Rosemary Chen, and Lisa Tran."
