        "text": "We're just as entertained by Money Heist, Outlander, Narcos, and popular Korean dramas, as the next serial binge-watcher. But some of \"peak TV's\" offerings can also be the...heaviest.\n\nFortunately, there are also plenty of feel-good, light-hearted options on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and beyond to balance out the steady stream of drug lords and dystopia. Enter: Ted Lasso, the uplifting AppleTV+ series about an American football coach who ventures across the pond to lead an English soccer team. His knowledge about the the sport is lacking—but he does know how to inspire people. Schitt's Creek and Grace & Frankie, which returned for a seventh season, also shine as recent feel-good fare.Of course, you can also dip back into the pop culture archives for a boost. Entire seasons of classic sitcoms like Living Single and are available to wrap you in a nostalgia cocoon.\n\nWhether you need to cure some low-key blues or are just seeking a pleasant distraction, adding any of these happy shows to your queue should do the trick. And when you're done, check out these delightful movies.\n\nMichelle is the Culture & News Writer for OprahMag.com, where she writes about celebrities (she considers herself an expert on Beyoncé and Reese Witherspoon), plus the latest in pop-culture news, binge-worthy TV shows, and movies. The transplanted Southerner turned ambitious New Yorker lives her best life by listening to hip-hop and Pod Save America, watching The Office on repeat, quoting Oprah-isms, eating dessert before dinner, and avoiding avocado. Seriously, she doesn’t get the hype.\n\nIt should say, “Michelle is the former Culture & News Writer for Oprahmag.com...”"
