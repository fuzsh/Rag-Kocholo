        "text": "PREFACE Television has long been a cornerstone of modern culture, shaping our understanding of the world, influencing public opinion, and providing endless entertainment. From its early days of black-and-white broadcasts to the era of streaming services and high-definition displays, television has undergone a remarkable transformation. This journey, filled with technological advancements and cultural shifts, has made television indispensable daily. As an academic in the Faculty of Communication, I have had the privilege of exploring the multifaceted world of television and witnessing its profound impact on society. My academic career has been dedicated to understanding the intricate relationship between television and its audience, the sociopolitical implications of its content, and the ever-evolving nature of its production techniques. This book, Understanding Television: A Journey Through Its Theories and Practices, is the culmination of years of study, teaching, and passion for the medium. The inspiration for this book comes from the realization that television, despite its ubiquity, remains a complex and often misunderstood medium. It is a powerful tool for storytelling, education, and cultural transmission, but it is also a commercial enterprise driven by ratings and advertising revenue. This dual nature of television presents opportunities and challenges, which I aim to explore comprehensively in this book. As a medium, television has evolved far beyond its origins as a simple broadcast technology. It has become a pervasive force in modern society, shaping our culture, influencing our perceptions, and reflecting our collective values. In this journey through the complexities of television, we explore its technical and theoretical dimensions and profound impact on our lives. From its inception, television has been more than just a means of communication; it has been a conduit for cultural exchange, a mirror of societal norms, and a powerful tool for information dissemination and entertainment. This book delves deep into the multifaceted world of television, examining its role as the primary image source of our modern globalized society and its transformation into a commodity produced and consumed by millions. In Chapter I: The Emergence and Development of Television, we trace the fascinating history of television's emergence, from the early international broadcasting efforts to development within specific national contexts such as Turkey. Through trials and innovations, television evolved into a cornerstone of modern media, enriched by commercial ventures that personalized broadcasts and diversified content offerings. Chapter II is titled Television News. Television journalism has undergone significant transformations, from its pivotal role in shaping public opinion during the living room wars to the augmented reality practices of contemporary newsrooms. We examine how television news coverage has shaped global perceptions and explore its enduring impact on societal discourse. Chapter III’s title is Advertisements. Television advertisements sell products and perpetuate cultural ideals, often depicting beauty standards and influencing body image perceptions. This chapter explores the complex relationship between media representation and consumer behavior, highlighting the ethical implications of advertising practices. Chapter IV’s title is Reality Shows. The rise of reality television has redefined celebrity culture and entertainment consumption. We delve into the history of reality shows, from their inception to their pervasive influence on contemporary media landscapes, examining their cultural impact and societal implications. Chapter V is Key Theories in Television Studies. This chapter navigates through vital theoretical frameworks that underpin television studies, including Shannon and Weaver’s communication model, cultivation theory, agenda-setting theory, and cultural imperialism theory. These theories illuminate how television shapes perceptions, behaviors, and societal structures. Chapter VI is Television, Subject, and Representation. Television's portrayal of gender, age, and cultural diversity is crucial in shaping societal attitudes and norms. We explore sexism, ageism, and hate speech within the context of television representation, emphasizing the medium's potential for both social progress and the perpetuation of stereotypes. Chapter VII is Setting Up Shots on Television. Behind every compelling television moment lies meticulous planning and execution. This chapter provides insights into the technical aspects of television production, from camera angles and movements to the art of setting up shots that captivate audiences and convey narratives effectively. As we conclude our exploration, we reflect on television's ongoing evolution and future trajectory. From emerging technologies to shifting audience preferences, television continues to adapt and redefine itself, promising new opportunities and challenges in the dynamic landscape of global media. Finally, in the resources section of the book, you can see both the resources cited in the book and the resources I have used while giving lectures and publishing on this subject for many years. Understanding Television is crafted to serve as a comprehensive guide for students, scholars, and professionals seeking to understand television's complex nature. It bridges television's theoretical and technical aspects, thoroughly exploring its history, evolving theories, and the practicalities of production and broadcasting. Television continues to be a dynamic and influential medium, constantly evolving with technological advancements and shifting viewer preferences. Digital technology and the rise of streaming platforms have revolutionized how content is produced, distributed, and consumed. By exploring this book's theoretical foundations and practical techniques, readers will understand the medium and be better prepared to navigate and contribute to its future. In writing this book, I aimed to create a resource that is both informative and engaging. I hope it will inspire a deeper appreciation for the art and science of television and encourage critical thinking about its role in society. Whether you are a student beginning your journey into media studies, a scholar seeking to deepen your understanding or a professional in the field, I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource and a source of inspiration. Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. I look forward to exploring the fascinating world of television together. Prof. Dr. Aybike SERTTAŞ aybikeserttas@yahoo.com İstanbul, 2024.\n\nIn the middle of the summer, on Wednesday 9 July 1975, the Finnish Broadcasting Company (FBC) aired a documentary entitled World Television. According to the FBC’s programme information, the aim was to present ‘thoughts and images of the communicational role of television in the future’. In addition to fictional sequences, the documentary showed studio discussions between three communication researchers, Kaarle Nordenstreng, Osmo A. Wiio and Tapio Varis, whom the newspaper Aamulehti (11 July 1975) ironically referred as the ‘scientist augurs of our communication policy’. The scholars debated Marshall McLuhan’s idea of global village and the future of television, but what makes the documentary especially worthy of attention is the fact that it draws strongly on fictional scenes. The audience were presented – perhaps consciously parodic and clichéd – images of Finnish family life in the year 2000, with children and parents moving around in unisex costumes, living in a windowless apartment and receiving all their information about the outer world through television sets. Thus, World Television not only debated the future but also showed things to come. It is, therefore, an exceptional platform for analysis: in addition to arguments and hypotheses, the programme tries to capture everyday exercises of the future and, at the same time, describe ways of using television without verbalising them. The programme dramatises the meaning of information in everyday life. World Television is of special interest also because it blurs the boundaries between television and information technology and thus serves as an interesting focal point for rethinking media relations and intermediality: the future is envisioned as something that connects television and computer technologies, although this is not clearly explicated. The aim of this contribution is to read and to interpret the television discourse of the programme from the perspective of computerisation and, more broadly, of intermediality. It seems appropriate to commence with the observation that the cultural history of technology cannot be written only on the basis of the ‘new’, and that everything that is presented as ‘new’ has to be read through other media, acknowledging the interconnectedness of media and the inevitable interplay between past, present and future. This setting can be paralleled with what David Holmes (2005: 187) writes on new media and the continuous emphasis on ‘newness’. As a hypothesis, it can be proposed that the interpretation of new technology, in this case emerging information technology, can be fruitfully approached through the lens of what was labelled as ‘old’ technology, thus granting access to contemporary tensions and contradictory interpretations."
