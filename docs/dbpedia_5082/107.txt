Family Guy for ladies sounds like a great thing -- after all, the long-running cartoon show is popular and funny, but, with its coarse humor, not all that appealing to women in general. The unfortunate problem with Mother Up is that it's not all that funny and relies on tired tropes for its comedy. Of course the leader of the super-mommies is a blonde harridan who's just mean to Rudi because she's jealous and who uses kids' birthday parties and swim lessons as her battlefield. Of course Rudi is a hard-edged career woman who finds out she has a secret soft spot for her kids. Of course, said kids are personality-free plot devices who conveniently disappear when the adults are talking.

Wouldn't it be nice to see a show about and for women in which the women supported each other instead of competing? There's plenty of comedy to be mined from the stay-at-home mom world (any SAHM could tell you that), but it's not on display in Mother Up.
