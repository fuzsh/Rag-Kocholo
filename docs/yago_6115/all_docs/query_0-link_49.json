        "text": "Elisabeth Elliot (née Howard; born December 21, 1926) died this morning (June 15, 2015) at the age of 88.\n\nShe was a beautiful woman of whom the world was not worthy.\n\nHere is her brief testimony, told in her typically understated way:\n\nMy parents were missionaries in Belgium where I was born. When I was a few months old, we came to the U.S. and lived in Germantown, not far from Philadelphia, where my father became an editor of the Sunday School Times. . . .\n\nOur family continued to live in Philadelphia and then in New Jersey until I left home to attend Wheaton College. By that time, the family had increased to four brothers and one sister. My studies in classical Greek would one day enable me to work in the area of unwritten languages to develop a form of writing.\n\nA year after I went to Ecuador, Jim Elliot, whom I had met at Wheaton, also entered tribal areas with the Quichua Indians. In nineteen fifty three we were married in the city of Quito and continued our work together. Jim had always hoped to have the opportunity to enter the territory of an unreached tribe. The Aucas were in that category—a fierce group whom no one had succeeded in meeting without being killed. After the discovery of their whereabouts, Jim and four other missionaries entered Auca territory. After a friendly contact with three of the tribe, they were speared to death.\n\nOur daughter Valerie was 10 months old when Jim was killed. I continued working with the Quichua Indians when, through a remarkable providence, I met two Auca women who lived with me for one year. They were the key to my going in to live with the tribe that had killed the five missionaries. I remained there for two years.\n\nAfter having worked for two years with the Aucas, I returned to the Quichua work and remained there until 1963 when Valerie and I returned to the U.S.\n\nSince then, my life has been one of writing and speaking. It also included, in 1969, a marriage to Addison Leitch, professor of theology at Gordon Conwell Seminary in Massachusetts. He died in 1973. After his death I had two lodgers in my home. One of them married my daughter, the other one, Lars Gren, married me. Since then we have worked together.\n\nShe was the author of several books, many dealing with themes of suffering, loneliness, singleness, manhood and womanhood, and family.\n\nAmong her best-known books are those that told the story of her first husband, Jim Elliot, and their mission together in Ecuador: Through Gates of Splendor (1957), Shadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot (1958), The Savage My Kinsman (1961), and The Journals of Jim Elliot (1978).\n\nShe also wrote a biography of Amy Carmichael (A Chance to Die: The Life and Legacy of Amy Carmichael) and an influential book on purity (Passion and Purity: Learning to Bring Your Love Life Under God’s Control).\n\nAs a college student, Elisabeth dabbled in poetry, and one day wrote a poem that should would look back upon as prophetic:\n\nPerhaps some future day, Lord,\n\nThy strong hand will lead me to the place\n\nWhere I must stand utterly alone;\n\nAlone, Oh gracious Lover, but for Thee.\n\nI shall be satisfied if I can see Jesus only.\n\nI do not know Thy plan for years to come.\n\nMy spirit finds in Thee its perfect home: sufficiency.\n\nLord, all my desire is before Thee now.\n\nLead on no matter where, no matter how,\n\nI trust in Thee.\n\nShe made famous an anonymous poem that seems to describe her own life of perseverance, as two of her three husbands preceded her in death:\n\nAt an old English parsonage down by the sea,\n\nthere came in the twilight a message to me.\n\nIts quaint Saxon legend deeply engraven that,\n\nas it seems to me, teaching from heaven.\n\nAnd all through the hours the quiet words ring,\n\nlike a low inspiration, ‘Do the next thing.’\n\nMany a questioning, many a fear,\n\nmany a doubt hath its quieting here.\n\nMoment by moment, let down from heaven,\n\ntime, opportunity, guidance are given.\n\nFear not tomorrow, child of the King,\n\ntrust that with Jesus, do the next thing.\n\nDo it immediately, do it with prayer,\n\ndo it reliantly, casting all care.\n\nDo it with reverence, tracing His hand,\n\nwho placed it before thee with earnest command.\n\nStayed on omnipotence, safe ‘neath His wing,\n\nleave all resultings, do the next thing.\n\nLooking to Jesus, ever serener,\n\nworking or suffering be thy demeanor,\n\nin His dear presence, the rest of His calm,\n\nthe light of His countenance, be thy psalm.\n\nDo the next thing."
