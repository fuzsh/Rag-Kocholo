        "text": "Helpful Words for the Long Haul\n\nNo marriage can survive without forgiveness. Marriage is a long term commitment between two sinners. (Elisabeth Elliot)\n\nWhen the Fight Starts\n\nWe’re both believers, and have been married over 2 decades, but when my temper flares, there seems to be only one sinner in the room.\n\nAnd it’s not me.\n\nFortunately, we have the Holy Spirit and He’s done something unique between us. Before we got married in our late 30s, I remember telling Jesus,\n\nI don’t know how to be married. I only know how to be single. You’re going to have to help us.\n\nGod’s answer to my prayer is an ongoing, quiet miracle.\n\nUnbelievable Grace\n\nI don’t get angry too often any more, but when I do, I blow like a volcano. My husband, on the other hand, becomes a brick wall. So I become the “irresistible force” and he turns into the “immovable object.”\n\nIt could have been a disaster.\n\nBut it isn’t.\n\nWhy? Because whenever I stomp out of the house and take a walk to cool down, the Holy Spirit starts working in both of us. By the time I return home, we’ve switched sides in the argument. Each of us is suddenly willing to do what the other one wants.\n\nSo the argument and hurt feelings evaporate.\n\nDid I say an ongoing miracle? Yes it is. But perhaps you’d have to live in my skin to understand. I was born a fiery redhead. Opinionated. Stubbornly sure that I’m always right. I don’t “switch sides” with anyone else, just my husband. So our marriage has become sweeter over time.\n\nThank you, Jesus; You do the impossible.\n\nThese images came from Pixabay.com\n\nResources:\n\nHere’s another version of my newest meme. The older couple are a bride and groom in Turkey. Notice her white dress and the flowers she holds.\n\nNo marriage can survive without forgiveness. Marriage is a long term commitment between two sinners. (Elisabeth Elliot)"
