        "text": "Jim Elliot was a missionary - and then a martyr at the hands of the Auca Indians to whom he was witnessing. At the age of 29, he left behind a young wife, a baby daughter, and an incredible legacy of faith.\n\nJim's volumes of personal journals, written over many years, reveal the inner struggles and victories that he experienced before his untimely death. In The Journals of Jim Elliot, you'll come to know this intelligent and articulate man who yearns to know God's plan for his life. The book details his fascinating missions work, and reveals his love for Elisabeth - first as a single man, then as happily married.\n\nEdited by his widow, Jim's personal yet universal musings about faith, love, and work will show you how to apply the Bible to the situations you face every day. They will inspire you to lead a life of obedience, regardless of the cost, and delight you with an amazing story of courage and determination."
