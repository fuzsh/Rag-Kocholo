        "text": "Most Christians have heard of the famous Jim and Elisabeth Elliot, a missionary couple called to reach a hostile group of native Ecuadorians who had yet to hear the good news of Jesus. While trying to establish friendship, Jim, along with four other men, was murdered by the tribe. Miraculously, Elisabeth Elliot not only stayed in Ecuador with their young daughter, but would later live among and witness to this same tribe that killed her husband, resulting in many of them coming to know Jesus.\n\nAfter a few short chapters about Jim’s death, Ellen Vaughn begins her biography with Elisabeth’s early days and ends when she leaves Ecuador permanently. We get a detailed look at her childhood growing up in a home that hosted many missionaries, see the forming of her strict character at her boarding school, and witness the foundations of her life as missionary and writer. Then Vaughn takes us to more well-known places as we meet Jim, read about their separate missionary work, their marriage, and life after Jim’s death. Vaughn draws much from Jim and Elisabeth’s journals as well as her personal interviews and relationship with Elisabeth Elliot herself. This book was a treasure trove of information that fed every curious question I could possibly have about a woman I have come to deeply admire. The biography is described as Elisabeth’s “early years”, focusing on her upbringing and missionary work, and ending with her permanent return to the United States. Those who have read some or many of Elisabeth Elliot’s own books will not find this biography boring or repetitive, but rather expansive.\n\nWhat I loved most about Vaughn’s biography is her honest report of her subject. Elisabeth Elliot lived a life marked by sacrifice, obedience, and faith in the Lord through many trials. Yet at the end of the day, Elisabeth was the same as us— a sinner redeemed by Jesus Christ. Her life was not perfect, and Vaughn hits on many aspects that simply show our heroine’s humanity. Readers learn about some of her questionable beliefs and practices, see relationship issues getting in the way of sharing the gospel, and glimpse more of her raw sorrow and daily struggles. Yet let this inspire you as it inspired me. Seeing the weak side of Elisabeth Elliot along with all of her strengths just points us back to Christ. Paul writes, “… ‘my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me” -2 Corinthians 12:9, ESV. We are all weak outside of Christ. Praise God that He saves us and uses us anyway, whether we are missionaries in Ecuador or doing our laundry at home.\n\nPick up this book to learn more about who Elisabeth Elliot truly was, to be challenged in your faith, and to know that our weaknesses are never the end of our stories thanks to Christ."
