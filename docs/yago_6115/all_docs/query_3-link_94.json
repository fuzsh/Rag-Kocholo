        "text": "Read\n\nJuly 24, 2011\n\nThis guy's intensity for the things of God at such a young age is both inspiring and intimidating. A true hero of the faith, he still comes across as very human. It will, I think, make you want to journal your own times in the Word and see what God does with that.\n\nHe also really strikes a note challenging himself and others to seek only God's best. He saw plenty of his peers settling for fruit in stateside ministries and seeing this as God's validation that they need not challenge themselves to go farther beyond what is comfortable. From just the outlines he sketches in his book and from the insights he is already showing, it is clear that he could have had a blessed, long, and relatively easy ministry as a teacher where the Gospel is already known. But he, like Paul, believe that he was specifically assigned to do more difficult. This book will make you really search yourself to find out if you are.\n\nJuly 2, 2008\n\nThis book was very good: his notes on the Bible were REALLY deep, and I learned a lot from him, but I also got a chance to see his \"human\", or sinful, side. I always tend to see the heroes of the faith as some sort of supernatural humans, who, yeah, sinned (but it was only this one little lie back when they were 4 years old or so), but were otherwise saintly. Reading his journals helped me to put who Jim Elliot was into a more realistic perspective (Elisabeth Elliot too!). :)\n\nI would caution against younger readers for this book...he does make mention of what I list as \"other\" type of content *winks*. But, then again, it is his personal journals, so I guess you should expect personal thoughts/feelings. ;)\n\nMay 2, 2015\n\nOh wow - what a wonderful read. Jim Elliot was such a passionate, inspiring man and I'm so grateful for his legacy and the example of his life. I'm also grateful to Elisabeth Elliot for editing these pages and putting them together for us to read. It was inspiring and such an encouragement to read about the struggles, as well as triumphs Jim encountered throughout the seven years documented between these covers. The flaws, the flesh and the failures are here, but there is no denying his dedication to God.\n\nAfter reading Shadow of the Almighty and Through Gates of Splendor a few years ago, right away he became a hero of mine; now, reading his journals - entries of him pouring out his heart to the Lord for guidance and help, praising the Lord for provision and encouragement, asking for strength and perseverance in knowing what the Lord's will was for his life - has made him even more of a hero and an example to me. Isaiah 66:2b often came to mind: \"But on this one will I look: on him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.\"\n\nJim's focus was solely on Christ and living a life completely dedicated to Him, regardless of the personal, earthly things he might have had to sacrifice (one example would be not knowing the Lord's will regarding Betty, whether or not they should marry). There is so much substance to his words and his Bible study entries are deep and rich with lessons.\n\nThree of Jim's maxims that I've always loved:\n\n~ \"He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.\" p. 174\n\n~ \"Wherever you are, be all there. Live to the hilt every situation you believe to be the will of God.\"\n\n~ \"Determination, not desire, determines destiny.\" p. 278\n\nI learned so, so much, was convicted numerous times and am encouraged in remembering that the Lord uses ordinary people, sinners saved by grace to complete His work. What an example and what a legacy Jim left.\n\nMarch 6, 2012\n\nPersonally, this was one of the most impacting books I have ever read. It takes time to get through it because the content consists almost entirely of Jim's journal entries, and those weren't written with a general audience in mind. But for me personally, as one who journals and contemplates my life and faith often, there was so much substance in Jim's words, questions, and situations that he recounts in his journal entries.\n\nJune 29, 2015\n\nJim Elliot's journals were compiled together by Elisabeth Elliot for publication. These are dated, chronological journal entries, so they read that way and not as a cohesive idea development. These journal entries do tell a part of Jim Elliot's life story, obviously from his own perspective. Some entries are mundane but mainly the book is full of insights, thoughts, struggles, and more. I found it amusing how he thought Elisabeth too skinny in the early going but as his love for her grew, he seemed not to notice what he previously thought were flaws.\n\nJim Elliot's journals give a different yet valuable perspective on mission work. He knew he could die in the effort to reach the Auca's and in the end the five men chose not to defend themselves and sealed their witness with their blood. I highly recommend this book. The book is large but journal entries are brief and it lends itself to reading in a devotional manner.\n\nAugust 6, 2014\n\nIncredibly convicting, inspiring, and encouraging. Elliot was pretty fiercely human and struggled with many of the same sins and doubts that I do, BUT -- his focus was Christ and he was singlemindedly devoted to living a life of sacrifice. Reminder for me: God doesn't use people who have it all together; he uses those whose sense of their weakness causes them to rely on his grace alone.\n\nSo incredibly grateful for Jim Elliot's example of a life truly well-lived.\n\n\"Wherever you are, be all there. Live to the hilt every situation you believe to be the will of God.\"\n\nAugust 4, 2008\n\nI learned from this book that if you are really dedicated to Christ, you will go where he leads. Loved the words of Jim Elliot and his passion and vision for salvation he had for the tribal Indians in South America.\n\nDecember 1, 2009\n\nWhat a life. This is the journal of missionary who became a martyr in 1956. His life was not wasted. I highly recommend the DVD documentary as well. Find it here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Gates-Sp...\n\nJanuary 5, 2024\n\nI wanted to read this book after my professor read a portion of it during a class devotion. What stood out to me was the normalcy of most of his entries (daily devotions, praying about his relationship, asking God to use him). Mind blowing to think about how God answered his prayer to be used for the sake of the Gospel.\n\nNovember 27, 2016\n\nFor some time now, I have been fascinated with Jim Elliot's story and the sacrifice he and his fellow missionaries made back in the fifties. When his widow, Elisabeth Elliot, died last year, I began to search for more information about Jim and Elisabeth and their unwavering faith in and devotion to God (most peculiar in today's culture). I was not disappointed in the book The Journals of Jim Elliot which includes Jim Elliot's recorded thoughts and experiences between 1948-1955. According to the editor, Elisabeth Elliot, she lightly edited these journals mainly by adding notes for clarity.\n\nThis book begins when Jim is a junior at Wheaton College and starts off a bit slow, but quickly you see this man has a consuming passion and singular purpose to fulfill God's will for his life - that people may know Jesus. Today's culture and the world around us encourages us to use what we are given for our gain and fame, but this man inspires one to make more of one's life with what God has given you.\n\nJim's journals portray an authentic man who sincerely loves God, but his writings don't censor his struggles with the temptations and pitfalls common to men, the times when he doesn't feel motivated for the Lord, when he doubts the impact his efforts will have on God's kingdom or when he has challenges to his faith. Instead, he takes these before God and requests His help, time and time again.\n\nIt was interesting to read how a missionary is prepared for the field, although I'm sure there are countless other ways effective missionaries receive their training. This book made this larger than life martyr real & human. This is helpful because I think sometimes we view the impact achieved by the life of someone so well know as practically unattainable in our own life. Jim Elliot shows us in his journals that he struggled with the same things we do, and yet through his faithfulness to God, God allowed his efforts to leave an everlasting legacy.\n\nI found a lot of inspiration in this book, but here are several quotes among the many that I highlighted in the book:\n\n-\"God, I pray, light these idle sticks of my life and may I burn up for Thee. Consume my life, my God, for it is Thine. I seek not a long life but a full one like Yours, Lord Jesus.\"\n\n-\"How often I must cause the spirit of jealousy to come upon Thee, Lord Jesus, when my heart desires others beside Thee.\"\n\n-\"God make me a warrior, I'm weary of this slacker's life of unbelief.\"\n\n-\"Lord, give me firmness without hardness; steadfastness without dogmatism; love without weakness.\"\n\n-\"God can only be glorified in praise when He is the true source and end of it.\"\n\n-Just before he left for Ecuador: \"I am ready to meet Jesus. Failure means nothing now, only that it taught me life. Success is meaningless, only that it gave me further experience for using the great gift of God -- Life. And, Life, I love thee, not because thou art long, or because thou hast done great things for me, but simply because I have thee from God.\"\n\nMuch more could be said, but I highly recommend this book.\n\nAugust 22, 2020\n\nThis took me several years to get through as it isn't something you can just sit down and read straight through. It was interesting to read Jim's thoughts and inner dreams and plans but it is hard to hone in for more than a page or two at a time. I think I was also hoping that more of the journals would be devoted to his time in ministry, but a large portion of the book were his journals leading up to his decision to pursue full-time international missions. Again, not a bad book...it just takes a bit of time to get through!\n\nJuly 24, 2015\n\nInvaluable lessons for all who desire to \"fill up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ\". Jim's life, though not easy or always compelling, illustrates why \"dying (everyday) is gain\". Christ was not formed in him easily. What is undeniable in these entries, is that his martyrdom was not an isolated accident but an anticipated culmination of a life set on an unshakeable hope.\n\nMay 6, 2016\n\nAt times, this book was difficult to follow because it is a Journal. Like most Journals we experience different activities each day, but Jim jumps topics with little explanation. I look at this book as if I were reading over Jim's shoulder. The references to what he study in school and the Bible correlations were interesting and helpful.\n\nMay 30, 2008\n\nThis is my second favorite book. It's the only book that the Lord has TOLD me specifically to read and I thank him each day for that. Jim's vulnerability and example in these pages has drawn me closer to the Lord than I ever thought possible.\n\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\nA look into the inner life of a purposeful man.\n\nWant to read\n\nApril 10, 2008\n\nsomeone borrowed my book and never returned it>< so to be continued:D **and uh... person who borrowed it... GIVE ME BACK MY BOOK** :D\n\nAugust 19, 2011\n\nmust read. Long book covering a few years of Jim's life well worth the read as a devotional. The best part is the last year of his life while he is falling in love with his future wife. WOW!!!!!\n\nMay 7, 2014\n\nVery good read. Jim Elliot was sold out for God. It was sad at times, but God used Him powerfully to bring the Gospel to the Auca Indians.\n\nOctober 8, 2014\n\nInspiring, amazing, and a bright flame that went out too soon. I was young when I read this book and it influenced by thinking and my direction in life, and still does.\n\nNovember 23, 2015\n\nIt took me a while....but I am so glad that I read this book! I enjoyed parts of it and some of it was rather boring. Overall though a very good book!\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nI highly recommend this book. Even if you aren’t a Christian it’s fascinating.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nJim Elliot is a hero in the realm of Christian missions. When he and his comrades gave their lives in 1955 for the spread of the Gospel, the world took notice. Since that time, the Auca Indians in Ecuador have been evangelized, in great part because of the work he started.\n\nHis wife has been the caretaker of his story for decades. A tremendous author in her own rite, Elizabeth Elliot has chronicled Jim's story in Through Gates of Splendor as well as other writings. These are definitely worth reading!\n\nIn this offering, Elisabeth has preserved for the reader Jim Elliot's journals from 1948 to 1955. His journals entries begin in his Junior year at Wheaton university and come to an end with his life. Reading them has been a labor of love for me. At times, they have droned on and on. At other times, I have mined tremendous gems that made the slogging worth the while.\n\nOne has to remember that Jim was only a 20 year old young man when these journals commence. It is easy to expect the inner thoughts of some missionary hero. In fact, these journals read exactly how you might think the journals of a 20 something might read. He is obsessed with whether or not he is married. He is wrestling with living a godly and pure life while remaining sexually pure. He is working out the meanings of certain passages. He, like many young people, can be critical in a sophomoric way when contemplating how previous generations live out their faith and lead the church. He is yearning for clear direction from the Lord in how to lead his life.\n\nI think one my big takeaways from this book is that heroes often have the common experience of the every man. They wrestle with real issues. They make mistakes. They obsess over minutia that doesn't matter. They don't have perfect theology. Yet, amazingly, miraculously, graciously, and awesomely, God uses them. Let this be an encouragement to us!\n\nNovember 9, 2023\n\nI picked this up after reading Through Gates of Splendor. I wanted to know more about a man who was so willing to give up his life for the cause of the gospel. This book had a far greater impact on me than I ever would have expected. I was simply seeking knowledge or greater insight. What I received was leadership into greater spiritual maturity, an example of what a life committed to Christ really looks like. The most interesting aspect of the book was to see how uniquely gifted Jim was for applying Scripture to everyday life. He pulled such great truths for daily living out of the most obscure passages. His insight was incredible. It has helped me to be more intentional, more careful to apply my daily Scripture readings through more thorough meditation. It was his sole commitment to go only where God led, do only what God directed. He achieved what he set out to accomplish and so felt complete with his life here on earth. I'm so thankful Elisabeth published this because it was of immense benefit to me. I really cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nI would rate this book 3.5 stars. The content is fascinating and challenging for sure. It is just tedious reading through 500 pages of anyone's diary. I would say that this really allows you to get into the head and life of one of the great martyrs of our faith. We often don't get to se the human side of these people and his wife Elizabeth helps with this. He does get graphically at times honest about his sexual desire for Betty before they get married. I am glad I read this, but probably more in smaller chunks next time because it is long and tiresome at times. The abrupt ending reminds us of the numbered days Jim Elliot had and the ministry that was carried on by the wives in the years after this ended.\n\nAugust 1, 2018\n\nThis book was a great look into the life of a man who wanted to know God and serve Him with all of his ability. What encouraged me the most about this book, though, was how it reveals the progression of growth God works in the life of a person. All the waiting that Jim did in the years before he went to Ecuador were for a purpose. God used this ordinary, faithful life and made it an example to whole generations of Christians after him. I may not agree with all of Jim's opinions, but the truth that he stakes his faith on and the lessons that he learns through his time Journaling make this book well worth the read.\n\nOctober 12, 2023\n\nThis book was slow going for me and took what feels like a really long time to read. It's 480 pages and more of a resource for those with a particular interest in his life. I like that Jim actually wrote journals and had a real missionary heart. And if you were fine with dragging this book out and even reading the chapters of the Bible he referenced for his entries that might be an idea. But it really was just like sermon idea notes. Occasionally he had a thought or way of looking at things that made me think and I added some of his quotes on Goodreads.\n\nBook has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc\n\nJune 15, 2024\n\nSo very insightful spiritually in many places but also very raw and human in places. This helped correct a somewhat one-dimensional view I had of Elliot. It was a bit sad, knowing the day of his death was approaching, to read his journal entries get more and more busy, distracted, and infrequent right up until the end. His last journal entry gives no indication that it would be his last, which is, I suppose, a fair warning for the rest of us to not fall into the busy trap and be absorbed in the minutae of life. Also a good reminder of the daily struggles of missionaries. Definitely worth reading."
