        "text": "“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.”\n\nMany thought it was a waste of a good life when Jim Elliot announced he was going to spend his life on a foreign mission field. His life and death, however, encouraged thousands to follow his example. Was his life a waste? You decide….\n\nPhilip James Elliot was born on October 8, 1927, in Portland, Oregon. His father was an evangelist, and his mother was a chiropractor. Growing up, Jim and his three siblings were introduced to countless missionaries who visited in their home and told them exciting stories about Gospel work.\n\nIn 1945, Jim went to Wheaton College. He became a star on the wrestling team, and roomed with Pete Fleming. Together, these two friends dedicated their lives to whatever Christ had for them.\n\nDuring his junior year of college, he met a godly girl named Elisabeth Howard. They had a long courtship, and then were married on his 26th birthday. Following their marriage, the Elliots continued to form detailed plans on how they could best reach the most unreached Ecuadorian natives with the Gospel. They knew the Aucas were a hostile tribe in Ecuador, but the added risk did not matter to them. They enlisted the help of four other men – including Elliot’s old college roommate, Pete Fleming – and made plans to take the good news specifically to the Aucas.\n\nLittle did these five men and their families know that their mission to the Aucas would be the last thing they ever did. On January 8, 1956, some misunderstandings and hostility came to a head, and the Aucas turned against their would-be friends and evangelists. All five of the missionary men were speared to death by those whom they had endeavored to reach.\n\nThrough their own family members and those back home who heard about their testimonies, though, the men’s mission to reach the Aucas eventually came to pass. Elisabeth Elliot stayed on and Nate Saint’s sister Rachel came to help. Many more young workers were inspired to give their lives to missionary endeavors worldwide as a result of the Ecuador martyrs’ sold-out dedication to spreading God’s Gospel.\n\nAs Jim Elliot wrote, “Wherever you are, be all there. Live to the hilt every situation you believe to be the will of God.”\n\nWhat are you doing for God right now? Are you doing your best in the responsibilities God has given you right now? Your school work? Being in your family and in your church family what you ought to be? Do you take your work and your studies seriously? Wherever you are right now (by God’s grace), “be there” with your whole heart!\n\n1 Corinthians 10:31 – Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
