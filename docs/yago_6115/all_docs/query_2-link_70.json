Let me not be a milepost on a single road; make me a fork, that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me.”[1]\n\nEver since I read Jim Elliot’s journal as a young college student and discovered this quote I have sought to make one of my central life ministries what I call (at least inside of my own head) my “fork in the road” ministry. In other words, I am always on the lookout to have one-on-one conversations with people that encourage, stir, challenge, convict, or strengthen them. I am intentionally seeking to have conversations that either lead people into relationship with Christ or spur them to live life with him more faithfully.\n\nAre you seeking to be a “fork in the road” for others?"
