        "text": "About\n\nHe is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.\n\nJim Elliot Jim Elliot arrived in Ecuador as a missionary at age twenty-five. Three years later, he would become a martyr at the hands of the Auca, the indigenous people to whom he was witnessing. He left behind a young wife, a baby daughter, and an incredible legacy of faith.\n\nJim's volumes of personal journals, written over many years, reveal the inner struggles and victories that he experienced before his untimely death in 1956. In The Journals of Jim Elliot, you'll come to know this intelligent and articulate man who yearned to know God's plan for his life, detailed his fascinating missions work, and revealed his love for Elisabeth--first as a single man, then as a happily married one.\n\nEdited by his wife, Elisabeth, Jim's personal yet universal musings about faith, love, and work will show you how to apply the Bible to the situations you face every day. They will inspire you to lead a life of obedience, regardless of the cost, and delight you with an amazing story of courage and determination."
