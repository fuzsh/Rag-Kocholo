        "text": "Tag: Elisabeth Elliot\n\nFive Who Risked It All for the Gospel: Through Gates of Splendor\n\nThrough Gates of Splendor by Elisabeth Elliot\n\n“For the Auca to have no love for the white man was understandable. Could Christian love wipe out the memories of past treachery and brutality? This was a challenge to Jim and Pete as they hoped to bring the message of God’s love and salvation to these primitive people.”\n\nA few years ago I read Shadow of the Almighty by Elisabeth Elliot (who passed away recently in June 2015), in which she shares the life and writings of her husband Jim Elliott, one of five missionaries who were murdered in the jungles of Ecuador in 1956. I was familiar with the incident, but after reading about the life and heart of Elliot, I really wanted to learn more about how God had moved in the lives of these men, bringing them together in that place. I was interested to learn what kind of men these were who were willing to risk their very lives for a people they didn’t know and had a very good reason to fear. I was curious how their plans came about and what actually transpired on that fateful day. Elisabeth Elliot relates this story in first person in her first book Through Gates of Splendor, which was published the year following the five missionaries’ deaths. Continue reading “Five Who Risked It All for the Gospel: Through Gates of Splendor” →\n\nThe Heart of a Martyr, Part One\n\nThis is a continuation from the article, “The Legacy of a Martyr” on the book Shadow of the Almighty: the Life and Testament of Jim Elliot by Elisabeth Elliot\n\nIn her book Shadow of the Almighty, Elisabeth Elliot reveals much about the life and heart of her husband, Jim, through his journals and personal letters to family members and to herself. Jim Elliot (1927-1956) was one of five missionaries killed by the Auca Indians in Ecuador. The following excerpts illustrate Jim’s dedication and focus on the spiritual rather than the temporal.\n\nSpeaking of education in general: “The acquisition of academic knowledge (the ‘pride of life’) is a wearing process and I wonder now if it is all worth while…What thing better can a man know than the love of Christ, which passes knowledge? Oh, to be reveling in the knowledge of Him, rather than wallowing in the quagmire of inscrutable philosophy!”\n\nContinue reading “The Heart of a Martyr, Part One” →\n\nThe Legacy of a Martyr: Jim Elliot\n\nShadow of the Almighty: the Life and Testament of Jim Elliot by Elisabeth Elliot\n\n“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot lose.”\n\nThe missionary Jim Elliot (1927-1956) was one of five men killed by the Auca Indians in Ecuador. His widow Elisabeth has written many tremendous books. In Shadow of the Almighty, she reveals much about the life and heart of Jim through his journals and personal letters to family members and to herself.\n\nAs I read Elliot’s writings, I was amazed how spiritually mature and completely “sold out” for the Lord this man was from as young as 18 years old! As an 18 year old freshman at Wheaton College, Elliot earned a reputation for having a “one-track mind” and for being a “woman-hater” because he refused to date, feeling it would distract him from his goals. By the age of 20, Elliot was convinced that God was calling him to serve on the mission field, and from that time on all his energies and plans were directed towards that goal.\n\nContinue reading “The Legacy of a Martyr: Jim Elliot” →"
