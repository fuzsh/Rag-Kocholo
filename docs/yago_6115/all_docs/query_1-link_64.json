        "text": "BEING ELISABETH ELLIOT\n\nby Ellen Vaughn\n\nBiography, Published in 2023\n\n*Please note that I earn from qualifying purchases as an Amazon Associate. Please see the disclaimer at the bottom of the page.\n\nSummary:\n\nBeing Elisabeth Elliot is the second book in the two-book biography series by Ellen Vaughn. She weaves historical events, life events, and Elisabeth’s thoughts from her private journal in both books. The first book is Becoming Elisabeth Elliot. It covers her early years, her courtship with Jim, and their brief marriage. It ends with her decision to leave Ecuador with her daughter, Valerie, to settle and begin life in North America.\n\nBeing Elisabeth Elliot begins with her adjustment from the communal culture of the people living in the jungles of Ecuador to New England suburbs and the harsh winters. Many people may be familiar with Elisabeth’s speeches, writings, and radio programs. Still, Ellen Vaughn shares Elisabeth’s unknown personal struggles – her struggle to be published and the criticism of her earlier works.\n\nEllen also shares how Elisabeth unexpectedly fell in love again while trying to do what was right. There are a few surprises about the person and character of Elisabeth Elliot that were unknown to the public and maybe only known in her private journal. Those surprises have caused a little stir in some circles on social media and possibly within close-net friendships and book clubs. I will not disclose those surprises, but I will share that I found some relief after reading this book. Relief that this woman, who so many look up to, is human. Like you. Like me. She was not perfect. Elisabeth failed in some areas of her life. However, one evident thing was that Elisabeth loved God and honestly wanted to do what was right until the end. Some may even say that the desire to do what was “right” may have been too strong, but you will have to decide on your own after you read the book.\n\nWhy Read this Book?\n\nElisabeth Elliot was a missionary, a wife, and a mother who lived in Ecuador and repatriated back to her passport country, the U.S. Like many who have repatriated, hers was bumpy along this path of transition. I loved that this biography was not polished and clean. Ellen Vaughn does an excellent job telling the truth while still honoring the main character, Elisabeth Elliot – a woman many admire."
