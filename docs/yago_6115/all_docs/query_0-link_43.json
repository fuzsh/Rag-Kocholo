        "text": "I‚Äôve admired Elisabeth Elliot for years. I loved her ‚ÄúPassion and Purity,‚Äù love almost every quote of hers that I encounter on social media, and of course I knew the story of how she was widowed at 29 when her husband was killed by the Ecuadorian natives he was trying to evangelize. When I saw Barbara review a new biography of her, I knew I‚Äôd want to read it. I was admittedly daunted by Elisabeth Elliot A Life ‚Äî it‚Äôs over 500 pages. And these were long pages with small print. At one point, the thought occurred to me that the author was covering pretty much every detail other than when Elisabeth went to the bathroom. And ha ha, within a page or so we had a comment on her having an episode of diarrhea! It was more detail than I needed, but with access to Elliot‚Äôs journals and letters, Austen undoubtedly gives a thorough look at her life.\n\nI enjoyed reading about Elisabeth‚Äôs childhood and things we share, from her affinity with the A.A. Milne character of Eeyore to her life revolving around books and writing. Hers sounded like a wonderful family, and an intellectually-stimulating place in which to grow up. I also related to her stoic manner of handling grief and other difficult life experiences. Despite Elliot‚Äôs no-nonsense, confident way of speaking, as an older adult she told her brother ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe how inferior I feel.‚Äù That surprised me and was an interesting glimpse inside her real thoughts.\n\nElisabeth attended high school at Hampden DuBose Academy, a Christian school that she was thrilled to attend since her home high school offered her no Christian companionship. The school was strict and definitely had its issues, with Elisabeth years later telling how she had been spanked and called a prostitute by the founder at one point, and with the founders‚Äô daughter shouting at another student that they were going to hell for wearing the wrong gym clothes. Nevertheless, for the most part Elliot thrived there and loved all the activities she was involved with.\n\nElisabeth heads to Wheaton for college and thrives there too. It was interesting to read that at that time, in the mid 1940s, mission work was a huge focus in the American evangelical Christian world. Foreign missions were seen as the ‚Äúapex of Christian life,‚Äù and students studying mission work were admired more highly than those in other majors. ‚ÄúMore than any other, the missionary vocation was considered to demand the most radical self-denial and devotion.‚Äù I had never thought of this angle, and I can see how Elisabeth‚Äôs dutiful personality would have led her toward this calling.\n\nIn addition to the call of missions, Elisabeth tried to fight her natural introversion. At this time, introversion was considered to be an unhealthy trait, ‚Äúeven a personality disorder.‚Äù I‚Äôm very glad that era has passed üôÇ Jim Elliot, a missions student she meets at Wheaton, has long talks with Elisabeth. The two fall passionately in love, the main problem being that Jim feels God called him to serve as a single missionary. This leads to several years of angst for Elisabeth. Both end up going to Ecuador to serve, separately. At one point, Elisabeth visits the Elliot family and they tell Jim numerous faults they find with her. Jim shares these faults with her in a letter, also sharing his opinion that she is ‚Äúterribly sarcastic‚Äù(!). That would have been rough, but to her credit Elisabeth takes their thoughts seriously and hopes to make a better impression later.\n\nJim and Elisabeth finally marry and have a child, Valerie. Soon after, Jim and four other missionaries hatch a plan to try to reach the auca (now known as the Waorani) people, a group unreached with the Gospel. It was interesting to read about how ‚Äúterritorial‚Äù missionary work was. There were conflicts between the Catholic missionaries and the protestant ones, and the men kept their plan to reach the aucas secret because they didn‚Äôt want another group to learn of it and basically beat them to it. The aucas were feared by other nearby tribes, and reaching out to them was ‚Äúa chance to achieve the greatness for God that Jim longed for.‚Äù This reminded me a lot of JFK‚Äôs oldest brother, who volunteered for a risky WWII flight mission that ended in his death.\n\nThe story is well-known of how the men made several flights over auca territory, dropping gifts and trying to communicate. These seemed to be received well, and next the men landed their plane and hoped to have face-to-face contact. However, the aucas came out with spears and killed them all ‚Äî some details of which were described here and were decidedly awful. It was later learned that the auca men misunderstood the missionaries‚Äô attempts at friendship, instead fearing that they were cannibals who wanted to eat them.\n\nAfter Jim‚Äôs death, Elisabeth and Valerie stayed on as missionaries in Ecuador. But much of their experience was frustrating. Elisabeth thought of missionary work as building little by little, but always with progress. So it was disheartening to her that often she saw little progress at all. Her main partner for her years there was Rachel Saint, sister of slain pilot Nate Saint. Elisabeth and Rachel didn‚Äôt get along at all, and this caused Elisabeth much grief: ‚ÄúShe could not understand how two of the most prayed-for missionaries in history could be so utterly alienated.‚Äù Elisabeth saw this situation as an opportunity to trust God; ‚Äúa new opportunity to say, ‚ÄòI love Thee, trust Thee, praise Thee. Do with me what Thou wilt.'‚Äù\n\nThroughout Elisabeth‚Äôs life, she dealt with many situations involving shades of gray. I appreciated the way she thought deeply through these issues; Austen describes her as being an ‚Äúinternal processor.‚Äù She did not immediately jump to conservative Christian mainstream ways of thinking, but rather looked in the Bible to try to find the truth. Situations like those with Rachel Saint probably contributed to this nuanced way of seeing the world.\n\nWhen Valerie reaches school age, mother and daughter move to the United States and Elisabeth‚Äôs life changes drastically. Instead of living in the jungle, she is a sought-after author and speaker. It must have been odd for her to realize that, had she not been briefly married to a slain missionary whose story was so highly publicized, her own life trajectory would most likely have been far different.\n\nShe meets Addison Leitch, a Christian magazine editor and professor 20 years her senior. He is married, but the two notice each other while his wife struggles with cancer. She dies, and within 2 weeks Addison and Elisabeth begin dating, becoming engaged 6 weeks later. I never knew this part of Elizabeth‚Äôs story. She seems to have been highly attracted to men throughout her life, and seemed deeply in love with both Jim and ‚ÄúAdd.‚Äù Life with Add wasn‚Äôt the Ecuadorian jungle ‚Äî it was high-class events with fur coats and fancy food. But in under five years, Add develops cancer and dies too. This was a terrible time for the couple, and a friend of Elisabeth‚Äôs notes that Add was ‚Äúmore fearful and angry in death‚Äù than anyone they‚Äôd ever known. It was disconcerting to both Add and Elisabeth that he was never able to experience peace, despite his Christian faith. Another gray area.\n\nIn her middle age, Elisabeth switches from the evangelical fundamental church of her upbringing to the Episcopal church. Years later, when her beloved brother Tom converts to Catholicism, she writes that she admires him and would most likely follow him were it not for upsetting her audience. Again, interesting, and I admire the lifelong learning approach that characterized her life.\n\nElisabeth and Valerie have extra rooms in their house, which they rent to boarders. At one point, one of these boarders marries Valerie, and the other proposes to Elisabeth. She is somewhat surprised (he was 10 years younger), but accepts.\n\nAnd here, problems ensue. Elisabeth discovers soon after their marriage that new husband Lars is controlling. He was a handyman/chaplain but begins to work as Elisabeth‚Äôs manager, managing her speeches, writings, radio programs, etc. While doing these things, he critiques her messages, her social manner, her posture, the odometer on the car if she goes somewhere without him, and even the timing of her baths. Elliot has always emphasized that women should defer to their husbands, and true to her word, she does not call Gren on his abuse. Instead, she regards the marriage as a chance to ‚Äúpractice the principles I write about.‚Äù There are times where she recognizes his behavior as hurtful, but she develops an even deeper interior life, separate from his, as a method of self-preservation. I empathize with this totally.\n\nIn her late 70s, Elliot realizes she is not remembering things as she once had. Disturbed, she makes a doctor appointment. Gren drives her there, but she requests that he stay in the car. I understand this too ‚Äî when she gets the bad news that she has Alzheimer‚Äôs, she prefers to deal with it on her own rather than having to deal with Gren‚Äôs response as well. She dies at 88, in 2015.\n\nI would recommend this book overall if you‚Äôre interested in Elliot‚Äôs story. A few caveats: author Lucy Austen inserts herself into the story more than I was comfortable with. For instance, she mentions Elisabeth being ‚Äúraised to obey first and ask questions later ‚Ä¶she may not have realized ‚Ä¶ that there was any other way for things to be.‚Äù She tells us at another point that Elliot ‚Äúhad cultural and theological faults she did not recognize,‚Äù before going on to describe some things in the South in a way that would have been quite mainstream at that time. This is my most-disliked form of author intervention: ‚Äúcatching‚Äù their subject in a thought or action that was normal at that time, and then showing readers how enlightened the author is by comparing her own 2023 sensibility. Another place, we are told that Jim and Elisabeth were in love, but ‚Äúthere was perhaps also a part of them that was in love with being in love, and with the idea of a glorious sacrifice, of giving up their one true love for Jesus.‚Äù She also later knocks Elisabeth for making a big deal of circumstances in determining God‚Äôs will ‚Äî yet noting that the circumstances she heeds are selectively chosen. Man, this makes me hope nobody ever reads my journals and posthumously infers or psychoanalyzes my motives and thoughts!\n\nWhen I wrote my bio of King Ludwig, a reader once wrote to me that it made her love him, and that she could tell I loved him too. I appreciated that! To me, if you don‚Äôt have a basic affection for your subject, why write on them? I found a bit of that missing here; it was more like Austen wanted to give us Elisabeth‚Äôs life along with Austen‚Äôs opinions and analysis on it, which of course are subjective."
