        "meta_description": "Author summary Parameter estimation is a common and crucial task in modeling, as many models depend on unknown parameters which need to be inferred from data. There exist various tools for tasks like model development, model simulation, optimization, or uncertainty analysis, each with different capabilities and strengths. In order to be able to easily combine tools in an interoperable manner, but also to make results accessible and reusable for other researchers, it is valuable to define parameter estimation problems in a standardized form. Here, we introduce PEtab, a parameter estimation problem definition format which integrates with established systems biology standards for model and data specification. As the novel format is already supported by eight software tools with hundreds of users in total, we expect it to be of great use and impact in the community, both for modeling and algorithm development.",

        "text": "PEtab problem specification format\n\nPEtab defines parameter estimation problems using a set of files that are outlined in Fig 2. A detailed specification of PEtab version 1 is provided in supplementary file S1 File, as well as at https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab. Additionally, we created a tutorial illustrating how to set up a PEtab problem, covering the most common features (supplementary file S2 File). Further example problems can be found at https://github.com/Benchmarking-Initiative/Benchmark-Models-PEtab. The different files specify the biological model, the observation model, experimental conditions, measurements, parameters and visualizations (Fig 1B). These files are described in more detail in the following.\n\nModel (SBML): File specifying the biological process using the established and well-supported SBML format [11]. Any existing SBML model can be used without modification. All versions of SBML are supported by PEtab and can be used if the specific toolbox supports it.\n\nExperimental conditions (TSV): File specifying the condition(s), such as drug stimuli or genetic backgrounds, under which the experimental data were collected. These experimental conditions specify model properties that are altered between conditions, and allow for a hierarchical specification of model properties (Fig 3A). If simulation conditions are used for pre-equilibration—meaning that some experiment started from the equilibrium reached for another condition—specific model states can be marked for re-initialization (Fig 3B).\n\nObservables (TSV): File linking model properties such as state variables and parameter values to measurement data via observation functions and noise models. Various noise models including normal and Laplace distributions are supported, and noise model parameters can be estimated. Observables can be on linear or logarithmic scale.\n\nMeasurements (TSV): File specifying and linking experimental data to the experimental conditions and the observables via the respective identifiers. Optionally, simulation conditions for pre-equilibration can be defined (Fig 3B). Parameters that are relevant for the observation process of a given measurement, such as offsets or scaling parameters, can be provided along with the measured values. This allows for overriding generic output parameters in a measurement-specific manner (Fig 3A).\n\nParameters (TSV): File defining the parameters to be estimated, including lower and upper bounds as well as transformations (e.g., linear or logarithmic) to be used in parameter estimation. Furthermore, prior information on the parameters can be specified to inform starting points for parameter estimation, or to perform Bayesian inference.\n\nVisualization (TSV): Optional visualization file specifying how to combine data and simulations for plotting. Different plots such as time-course or dose-response curves can be automatically created based on this file using the PEtab Python library described below. This allows, for example, to quickly create visualizations to inspect parameter estimation results. A default visualization file can be automatically generated.\n\nPEtab problem file (YAML): File linking all of the above-mentioned PEtab files together. This allows combinations of, e.g., multiple models or measurement files into a single parameter estimation problem, as well as easy reuse of various files in different parameter estimation problems (e.g., for model selection). The current YAML version 1.2 is used here."
