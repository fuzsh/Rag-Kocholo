        "text": "Our team has used COPASI to model enzyme kinetics due to the ease of adding user defined functions and altering resulting graphs. In our project RECOVER, one of the major points where rate is decided is the point where pyruvate branches into two different cycles:\n\n1) Krebs cycle and\n\n2) Our engineered Isobutanol producing pathway.\n\nHere, while there is one substrate, pyruvate, there are two enzymes. This means there exists competition for the substrate from two different enzymeÂ­s. For general enzyme kinetics, we have many different kinds of inhibitory models such as competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition, un-competitive inhibition, etc. All these models describe competition between substrate or substrate like molecules. But, these are all studies on multiple enzymes competing for the same substrate[2]. We found literature stating that when multiple enzymes compete on the same substrate, the reaction velocity will be additive in nature[3]. Therefore we used the equation:\n\nThe following equation was added as a user defined function on COPASI for modeling purposes. There were three reactions modeled in total:\n\nPyruvate to Acetyl CoA and Acetolactate using the enzyme competition equation.\n\nPyruvate to Acetyl CoA [Krebs cycle] using traditional irreversible Michaelis Menten equation.\n\nPyruvate to Acetolactate [Engineered isobutanol pathway] using traditional irreversible Michaelis Menten equation.\n\nNote: While the pyruvate molecule variable is assigned as a separate entity in the enzyme competition equation, the pyruvate molecule defined in both the traditional equations are common and separate from the one used in additive enzyme model. This was done to ensure proper comparison between the traditional system and the new additive model.\n\nThese reactions were used to target two key enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase producing Acetyl CoA for krebs cycle and acetolactate synthase producing acetolactate for the isobutanol pathway.\n\nThe values for K and V were taken from sources such as literature papers as well as databases such as BRENDA.\n\nValues:\n\nENZYME K cat[-] Km[mM] SPECIFIC ACTIVITY [mol/mg.min] REFERENCES Pyruvate Dehydrogenase 0.515 - 0.445 BRENDA Acetolactate Synthase 121 13.6 - Atsumi et al[4]\n\nNote: Values such as Km and Vmax required for the kinetic equations were calculated using the values found in the above mentioned references.\n\nRuBisCO being the slowest reaction in the Calvin cycle, is our rate controlling step. Therefore to more closely observe it, we have implemented a simple dynamic model of our gene expression using Simbiology in MATLAB. We have also included a provision regulatory mechanism (feedback inhibition) to control the gene expression[6]. This allows us to simulate various conditions and view our rate of expression and production. We also implemented a model with values both observed and calculated from existing literature.\n\nIn the above model we have considered that all the transcription, translation and degradation reactions are governed by 'mass action' laws. Most equations are irreversible forward reactions with the only exceptions being the regulatory mechanism reactions [k3 and rk3].\n\nThe above model was simulated on Model Analyzer in Simbiology and a plot was derived.\n\nValues:\n\nMOLECULES TRANSCRIPTION RATE [1/sec] TRANSLATION RATE [1/sec] AMOUNT [Molecules] REFERENCES DNA 0.208 - 7 Paul, J. H.[7] mRNA - 104.16 0.25 Paul, J. H.[7]\n\nNote: Some rates were derived through calculation from the values present in the literature work mentioned above.\n\nA model with the above values was simulated on Model Analyzer in Simbiology and a plot was derived.\n\nCONVERSION OF XYLOSE TO RUBP\n\nStep 1: Xylose to Ru5P (by Xylose Isomerase)\n\nThe rate equation for this step is given by Michaelis-Menten kinetics as:\n\n$${V= {V_{\\text{max1}} \\cdot [Xylose] \\over (K_{\\text{m1}} + [Xylose])}}$$\n\nStep 2: Ru5P to RuBP (by PRK) The rate equation for this step is also given by Michaelis-Menten kinetics as:\n\n$${V_2 ={V_{\\text{max2}}\\cdot [Ru5P]\\over (K_{\\text{m1}} + [Ru5P])}}$$\n\nOverall reaction as a combination of these two steps:\n\nXylose \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{Xylose Isomerase}}\\) Ru5P \\(\\xrightarrow{\\text{PRK}}\\) RuBP\n\nThe overall reaction rate, \\(V_{overall}\\), can be calculated as the product of the rates of these two consecutive reactions: \\[V_{overall} = V_1 \\cdot V_2\\]\n\nNow, substitute the rate equations for \\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\) into the overall rate equation:\n\n$$V_{\\text{overall}} = {V_{\\text{max1}} \\cdot [Xylose] \\over {K_{m1} + [Xylose]}} \\cdot {V_{\\text{max2}} \\cdot [Ru5P] \\over {K_{m2} + [Ru5P]}}$$\n\nThis equation represents the overall reaction rate for the entire pathway from xylose to RuBP, considering both the xylose isomerase and PRK steps. The overall rate depends on the concentrations of xylose and Ru5P, as well as the kinetic parameters (\\(V_{max1}\\), \\(K_{m1}\\), \\(V_{max2}\\), and \\(K_{m2}\\)) of the enzymes involved.\n\nThis is the combined enzyme kinetics equation for the entire pathway, and you can use it to calculate the overall rate at specific substrate concentrations when you have the numerical values for \\(V_{max}\\) and \\(K_m\\).\n\nCHANGE IN THE CONCENTRATION OF RUBP OVER TIME\n\nTo set up a differential equation to describe the change in the concentration of ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate (RuBP) over time, you need to consider the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by phosphoribulokinase (PRK), which converts ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) to RuBP. The rate of change of RuBP concentration (\\([RuBP]\\)) over time can be described as:\n\n$${d[RuBP]\\over{dt}} = Rate$$\n\nWhere:\\({d[RuBP] \\over{dt}}\\) is the rate of change of RuBP concentration with respect to time.\n\n\\({Rate}\\) represents the rate of conversion of Ru5P to RuBP, which is determined by the enzyme PRK.\n\nBased on the Michaelis-Menten equation for this step, you can express \\({Rate}\\) as follows: $${Rate} = {V_{\\text{max}}\\cdot [Ru5P] \\over{K_{\\text{m}} + [Ru5P]}}$$ Here, Rate is the rate of the enzymatic conversion of Ru5P to RuBP by PRK. So, the differential equation describing the change in the concentration of RuBP over time is: $${d[RuBP]\\over {dt}} = {V_{\\text{max}}\\cdot [Ru5P] \\over{K_{\\text{m}} + [Ru5P]}}$$ This equation represents how the concentration of RuBP changes with time because of the enzymatic conversion from Ru5P catalyzed by PRK.\n\n\\[CO2 + RuBP \\xrightarrow{k_1} 2(3-phosphoglycerate) (3-PGA)\\]\n\nSimplified model for CO2 uptake that includes some key equations: 1. Rubisco Reaction - Rubisco catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) using CO2: \\[CO2 + RuBP \\xrightarrow{k_1} 2(3-phosphoglycerate) (3-PGA)\\] where \\(k_1\\) is the rate constant for this reaction. 2. RuBP Regeneration: - Part of the 3-PGA produced in the Rubisco reaction is used to regenerate RuBP: \\[3-PGA \\xrightarrow{k_2} RuBP\\] where \\(k_2\\) is the rate constant for RuBP regeneration. 3. Carbon Uptake Rate: - The rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake by Rubisco can be defined as: \\[Rate_{CO2\\ uptake} = k_1 \\cdot [CO2] \\cdot [RuBP] - k_2 \\cdot [3-PGA]\\] where: - \\([CO2]\\) is the concentration of CO2. - \\([RuBP]\\) is the concentration of RuBP. - \\([3-PGA]\\) is the concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate. - \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) are rate constants. 4. Change in CO2 Concentration: - Assuming steady-state conditions, the change in CO2 concentration in the system can be represented as: \\[d[CO2]/dt = -Rate_{CO2\\ uptake}\\] This equation describes how the concentration of CO2 changes over time due to Rubisco activity."
