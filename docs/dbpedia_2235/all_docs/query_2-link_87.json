Database | PubMed\n\nHow to cite a specific data and/or associated model in KiMoSys repository?\n\nIf you use these, please cite the original article reference, and additionaly cite the data or model (typically in the \"Material and Methods\" section), using the copy to clipboard that can be found below the metadata information for each data/model EntryID.\n\n1) Example to reference a specific data\n\n\"The data was downloaded from KiMoSys repository http://kimosys.org [1] (KiMoSys (https://kimosys.org). (2020, August 4). Data EntryID 30 (Escherichia coli). https://doi.org/10.34619/7pa6-va85)\" (e.g. using APA citation style).\n\n2) Example to reference a specific associated model\n\n\"The model was downloaded from KiMoSys repository http://kimosys.org [1] (KiMoSys (https://kimosys.org). \"Model EntryID 13 (Escherichia coli).\" 2020, https://doi.org/10.34619/3y5p-9947)\" (e.g. using MLA citation style).\n\nHow to cite your submitted data or associated model?\n\nBe default we recommend to add the following to your manuscript:\n\n\"The data (or model) have been deposited to the KiMoSys repository (http://kimosys.org) [1] with the dataset identifier Data EntryID XX (or model identifier Model EntryID xx). doi:XXX\"\n\n1. What is KiMoSys?\n\nKiMoSys is a user-friendly platform that includes a public data repository of relevant published measurements, including metabolite concentrations, flux data, and enzyme measurements and tools in order to build ODE-based kinetic model. It is designed to search, exchange and disseminate experimental data (and associated kinetic models) for the systems modeling community. Our mission is to promote scientific sharing and to facilitate research.\n\n2. How to Register?\n\nIf you do not already have a KiMoSys account, create one here. Registration for the user is free and simple, having to provide a first and last name, affiliation, research interests, homepage or ORCID iD, a valid email address and a password.\n\n3. How do I update my KiMoSys account?\n\nLog into the KiMoSys website with your user account details. Then click 'edit user' to change your account details.\n\n4. Who can use data and models?\n\nAnybody can access and download public data and associated models. There are no login requirements. For more information, please read Terms and Condition of use.\n\n5. How to search and use data and associated models?\n\nIn order to perform a term-based search, a term or a set of terms have to be entered in the Search box in the top-right part of the repository table for each data or model.\n\nUpon open the Repository tab and clicking the corresponding EntryID the user will display the link(s) for the the data/model files. For each EntryID the user can also \"Download all\" (article + data files) for the data or \"Download full archive\" (article + data + model files) for the model.\n\n6. What kind of data are stored in KiMoSys?\n\nTime-series data of metabolites, metabolites at steady-state, flux data and protein levels.\n\n7. What submission options do I have and how to submit data?\n\nUsers can contribute and submit data to the database using the manually-assisted \"web platform submission\" form or the \"paper submission form\". The submitted data will be checked by KiMoSys curators.\n\nWeb-submission form:\n\n1. Create a User account or Login.\n\n2. Select Electronic Data-Submission.\n\n3. Download the \"Excel template\" copy.\n\n4. Choose appropriated data type template.\n\n5. Complete the Excel spreadsheet template (metadata + data).\n\n6. Fill out the web-form and upload the data file.\n\n7. Submit the data.\n\n8. Needs to be confirmed by a curator.\n\n9. After the curation process the Data EntryID are marked \"reviewed\" and the DOI assigned.\n\n10. Curator emails the submitter to inform that the Data EntryID is \"reviewed\".\n\nQuick submit form:\n\nAlert us to publications (datasets and associated kinetic models) that we might have missed. Select Quick submit.\n\nIn this case you don´t need a KiMoSys account.\n\nPaper submission form:\n\n1. Download the \"Excel template\" copy.\n\n2. Choose appropriated data type template.\n\n3. Complete the Excel spreadsheet template (metadata + data).\n\n4. Submit the data file via email to kimosys@kdbio.inesc-id.pt.\n\n5. Fill a term of agreement and responsability.\n\n6. We curate, add dataset to the database, assign accession number and DOI.\n\n8. How to associate models with data?\n\nRegistered users can only associate kinetic model to existing data (Data Entry ID). For each Data Entry ID, you can associate several models.\n\n1. Create a User account or Login.\n\n2. Fill out the web-form and upload the model file(s).\n\n3. Submit the model.\n\n4. After the curation process the Model EntryID are marked “reviewed” and the DOI assigned.\n\n5. Curator emails the submitter to inform that the Model EntryID is reviewed.\n\n9. What file formats can I submit to the KiMoSys repository?\n\nFor data: structured Excel file, SBtab file (.csv), text data file (time series) for parameter estimation in COPASI.\n\nFor models: SBML , CellML , COMBINE Archive , Matlab and COPASI files.\n\n10. Are the uploaded data and models kept private by default?\n\nYes. All submissions to KiMoSys repository are private by default.\n\n11. Can I update my data or model after submit?\n\nYes. KiMoSys supports version control, and any stored data or model can be altered as you wish.\n\n12. How to delete my data and/or models?\n\nThe submitter can just use the delete button when they are displayed (i.e. for data and models EntryID that have been made private). Otherwise, the submitter is not permitted to remove public shared data from KiMoSys.\n\n13. Are my data and models secure?\n\nAll uploads that are privately stored can only be accessed by the submitter, when they are logged in.\n\n14. Is there any example files I can use to try KiMoSys tools?\n\nYes. In the tools page, download a \"example file\" that can be used with the tools.\n\n15. Is the research I put on KiMoSys citable?\n\nYes. All research made publicly available can be cited using a unique DOI.\n\n16. Benefits of depositing experimental data sets and models in KiMoSys?\n\nYour research will be highlighted and other scientists will begin using your work and citing your datasets and/or associated kinetic models.\n\n17.
