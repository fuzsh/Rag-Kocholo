        "meta_description": "COPASI (Biochemical System Simulator) is a software tool with a user-friendly interface and platform-independent biochemical simulation. It is a powerful tool that allows users to access diverse simulation and modeling methods, making it easier to understand complex biochemical processes. COPASI has several unique features, including hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods, which allow for the combination of both deterministic and stochastic simulation methods. Additionally, the software provides the ability to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, making it more flexible and adaptable to different modeling scenarios.<br><br>\n\nOne of the key strengths of COPASI is its ability to handle numerical issues that arise when using these simulation methods. For example, the software can handle criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods and hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods. It also recognizes the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation, which is critical to ensure accurate and reliable results.",
