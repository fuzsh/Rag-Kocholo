        "text": "Simulator for Chemical Membrane Degradation in LT-PEMFCs\n\nCreate your own membrane degradation profile with this page.\n\nParameter Quantity Unit Range Concentration of ferrous ions, [Fe2+] ppm 1 - 50 Concentration of ferric ions, [Fe3+] ppm 0 - 50 Concentration of hydrogen peroxide, [H2O2] (const.) mol/L 1e-4 - 1e-2 Concentration of sulfonic acid head groups, [SC-SO3H] mol/L 0.01 - 10 Concentration of hydrogen, [H2] (const.) mol/L 1e-5 - 5e-2 Concentration of oxygen, [O2] (const.) mol/L 1e-5 - 5e-2 Thickness of the membrane, δmembrane μm 5 - 500 Temperature, T °C 60 - 95 Simulation time, t s 1 - 3.6e5 1 ppm Fex+ corresponds to 1.79 × 10-5 mol/L.\n\nPlease enter only numbers within the range specified for each parameter.\n\nThis page allows modelling chemical membrane degradation in low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells based on the following set of chemical equations:\n\nThe set of reactions starts with the Fenton reaction (Equation (1)) in which a ferrous ion reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form a hydroxyl radical. Equations (2) â (13) describe the formation of additional radical species, the reactions of the radical species with other constituents of the system or with each other. The last 4 equations ((14) â (16) and (unzipping)) express the reactions of hydroxyl radicals with the ionomer membrane.\n\nTemperature-dependence of the rate constants is expressed via the Arrhenius law\n\nwith kn = rate constant for the n-th reaction [L mol-1 s-1] or [s-1], An = pre-exponential factor for the n-th reaction [L mol-1 s-1] or [s-1], Ea,n = activation energy for the n-th reaction [J mol-1], R = gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1) and T = temperature [K].\n\nThe concentrations of iron contaminants (Fe2+ and Fe3+) as well as the concentration of H2O2, H2 and O2 can be chosen freely. Furthermore, the concentration of the head groups (SC-SO3H) can be set to a desired value. Kinetic data (activation energies, pre-exponential factor) are set to fixed values.\n\nGraphs showing the concentrations of the individual species versus time are received as output. In addition, the input file for COPASI and the result files (concentrations and fluoride emission rates) can be downloaded."
