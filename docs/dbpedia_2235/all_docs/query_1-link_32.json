Kinetic models can accelerate this task by simulating metabolic responses to genetic perturbations. However, exhaustive design evaluations with kinetic models are computationally impractical, especially when targeting multiple enzymes. Here, we introduce a framework for efficiently scouting the design space while respecting cellular physiological requirements. The framework employs mixed-integer linear programming and nonlinear simulations with large-scale nonlinear kinetic models to devise genetic interventions while accounting for the network effects of these perturbations. Importantly, it ensures the engineered strain’s robustness by maintaining its phenotype close to that of the reference strain. The framework, applied to improve the anthranilate production in E. coli, devises designs for experimental implementation, including eight previously experimentally validated targets. We expect this framework to play a crucial role in future design-build-test-learn cycles, significantly expediting the strain design compared to exhaustive design enumeration. No consensus exists on the computationally tractable use of dynamic models for strain design. To tackle this, the authors report a framework, nonlinear-dynamic-model-assisted rational metabolic engineering design, for efficiently designing robust, artificially engineered cellular organisms.",

        "text": "NOMAD for reliable strain designs\n\nThe NOMAD workflow consists of three steps (Fig. 1). It starts by generating a population of putative kinetic models consistent with experimentally observed omics and cultivation data, physicochemical laws, network topology, and regulatory interactions. These kinetic models consist of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) characterized by a set of kinetic parameters. To generate such models, we can use traditional kinetic modeling approaches such as ORACLE15,18,29, K-FIT30, Ensemble Modeling19, MASSPy17, and machine-learning empowered methods such as iSCHRUNK20,22, REKINDLE21, and RENAISSANCE31.\n\nIn the second step of NOMAD, we perform several quality checks on the kinetic models and identify those that will ensure reliable in-silico strain design strategies32. In this screening process, we retain kinetic models that are (i) consistent with experimentally observed steady-state values of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations, (ii) locally stable around that steady state; (iii) able to reproduce the dynamic behavior of metabolic responses under industrial production conditions; (iv) consistent with any available information on studied phenotype or a piece of expert knowledge; and (v) robust, meaning that these models resist change and are capable of coping with various genetic and environmental perturbations. This phase can be implemented using simulation and analysis tools such as SKiMPy33, COPASI34, and libRoadRunner35.\n\nIn the final step, we use the screened models to design engineering strategies for achieving a chosen metabolic objective, such as the overproduction of high-value biochemicals. We use Network Response Analysis26 (NRA) to perform the strain design. NRA casts the strain design process as an optimization problem that uses the outputs of the kinetic models (“Methods” section) and integrates design constraints ranging from the allowable fold changes in concentrations and fluxes to the extent and number of enzymatic interventions. This way, we obtain a computationally efficient modus operandi to enumerate designs and maintain the physiology of the engineered strain close to the reference physiology through various constraints.\n\nAfter enumerating alternate strategies, we test their performance and sensitivity to phenotype and expression variability in fermentation simulations that emulate real-life conditions. Based on these tests, we rank the designs and propose the best-performing ones for experimental implementation. Additional NOMAD details are available in the “Methods” section.\n\nAs a case study for testing and validating the NOMAD workflow, we designed strategies for increasing anthranilate production in E. coli strain W3110 trpD9223. In an earlier experimental study, the strain was used as a scaffold for overproducing anthranilate through several genetic manipulations28. Subsequent subsections cover the results of the validation studies.\n\nKinetic models calibrated to E. coli W3110 trpD9923 physiology\n\nWe used ORACLE15,16,36,37, implemented in the SKiMPy toolbox33, to generate a population of 800,000 putative kinetic models that satisfied the experimentally observed steady-state behavior of the reference strain (“Methods” section). However, not all of these models were necessarily suitable for strain design due to poor dynamic characteristics or poor responses to engineering interventions, necessitating the process of model screening. We first screened the population of kinetic models for those with dominant time constants, quantified by the inverse eigenvalues at the steady state, at least 5× faster than the doubling time of the cell (“Methods” section). This meant that all metabolic processes were expected to settle into their steady states within the doubling time of the cell (“Methods” section). More than 11% of the generated models (91,852) showed such dynamic characteristics (Fig. 2a).\n\nWhereas the inverse eigenvalues are a good indicator of the dynamic of metabolic responses in close vicinity of the steady state, due to the nonlinear nature of the system, not all models will exhibit the same dynamic behavior in a batch fermentation setting where metabolic states change intensely. Therefore, we tested if these models could reproduce experimentally observed behavior in a batch reactor. Out of 91,852 models, 212 captured experimentally observed temporal evolutions of growth, anthranilate, and glucose (Fig. 2b–d).\n\nNext, we evaluated the suitability of these 212 models for strain design by testing their responses to naturally occurring random perturbations in enzyme activities. 10 out of the 212 models proved to be robust and consistent with the studied strain, exhibiting at least 50% of the growth of the reference strain (“Methods” section) when subjected to these perturbations. These 10 models will be collectively referred to as K_trpD9923. The responses of K_trpD9923 in a batch fermentation setup show qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimentally observed time evolutions of growth, anthranilate production, and glucose consumption (Fig. 2).\n\nCloseness to reference physiology for more reliable designs\n\nExtensive metabolic engineering might steer the engineered strain towards metabolic states with impeded growth or performance as, too often, the objective of overproduction of a metabolite has a major tradeoff with the organism’s growth and global biosynthetic processes. For example, in efforts to optimize the specific productivity or yield of target chemicals, metabolic engineering interventions could inadvertently reduce other cell capabilities, such as ATP production or redox potential, by redirecting carbon and biosynthetic resources toward the target pathways and products. Because reference strains have evolved to maintain healthy and robust physiology, we postulate that we can engineer a productive strain by redirecting the flux to the desired objective while remaining as close to the reference state as possible. Thus, we use the proximity of the metabolic and fluxomic profile of the engineered strain as a proxy for maintaining a vigorous phenotype25,26,38. A related concept was also studied in the context of steady-state flux analysis24. Here, NOMAD uses nonlinear kinetic models and network response analysis (NRA, see “Methods” section) to implement this concept and constrain the phenotype perturbation while maximizing productivity.\n\nWe examined the impact of the phenotype perturbation constraint on the design performance by designing several sets of strains with an improved yield of anthranilate on glucose for each model in K_trpD9923. The sets differed by how much the engineered strains could deviate from the reference strain, quantified through a fold-deviation of the intracellular metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes from their values at the reference state. The set of strains closest to the reference strain could have intracellular concentrations deviating 2-fold from the reference strain. In contrast, the less constrained set could have intracellular concentrations deviating 20-fold from the reference strain. For all the sets, we allowed up to three enzyme modifications with a maximum of 5-fold change in their activities.\n\nCurrent approaches to strain design using kinetic modeling perform a metabolic control analysis (MCA)39,40 around the reference state and rank the target enzymes using the absolute value of the product flux or yield control coefficient with respect to each enzyme in the network. This approach does not consider constraints that could maintain the healthy physiology we discussed above. To understand the implications of using unconstrained MCA for strain design, we also applied a 5-fold change in enzyme activities to the enzymes corresponding to the top 3 anthranilate yield control coefficients for each kinetic model, without any constraints on concentration and flux perturbations.\n\nThe nonlinear responses of all these engineered strains showed that the closeness to the reference strain impacted performance (Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Indeed, for the groups closest to the reference phenotype (2-fold and 3-fold deviations), the engineered strains retained the dynamic characteristics of the reference strain while producing higher anthranilate titers (>15%) at a modest cost to growth (<16%). Moreover, the titers achieved by these strains (~0.38 g/L) are only attained by the designs with 10-fold and 20-fold deviations after more than double (~40 h) their fermentation time.\n\nIn contrast, the designs with 10-fold and 20-fold deviations demonstrated slower dynamics than the reference strain, with lower mean titers and growth at the end of the production period for the latter (Fig. 3). In a similar vein, the unconstrained designs (‘MCA’ in Fig. 3) consistently failed to achieve any semblance of growth or production of anthranilate. The likely explanation for this is that, by not constraining the phenotype perturbation, we pushed the engineered strains far away from the reference strain while disregarding the network effects of the enzyme modifications. Even when we considered the targets that had a non-negative impact on growth, the resulting responses were inferior to the designs generated using NRA (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Figs 2–4).\n\nThese results suggest that it is judicious to generate designs that minimize phenotype perturbation while respecting other design specifications, such as maximal titer and specific productivity, for the cost-effective production of valuable biochemicals.\n\nNOMAD designs include validated experimental targets\n\nWe employed NRA26 to engineer strains with a maximized yield of anthranilate with respect to glucose uptake for K_trpD9923 (“Methods” section). Using the results of the phenotype perturbation study, we permitted no more than a 3-fold change in concentrations to ensure we adhered to the phenotype of the reference strain. In addition, we allowed three enzyme modifications with a maximum of 5-fold upregulation and unrestricted downregulation. There were multiple designs for each model within 5% of the maximal increase in anthranilate yield. The number of such design alternatives for each model ranged from 2 to 12. In total, we obtained 70 designs involving 37 enzymes across the 10 models, predicting a 90–158% increase in anthranilate yield. Out of the 70 designs, 41 were unique by membership, meaning that they contained a unique set of three enzymes to be targeted. A clustering analysis of the 41 unique designs revealed five distinct groups of alternative enzymatic manipulations meeting the design specifications (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note 3).\n\nWe found that 8 out of the 37 enzymes involved in the designs were validated experimental targets for increasing the flux through the shikimate pathway41,42,43. Three out of these 8 enzymes, DDPA, DHQS, and SHKK, belonged to the shikimate pathway, three belonged to glycolysis, PGI, PPS, and PYK, and two belonged to the pentose phosphate pathway, TALA and G6PDH2r (Fig. 4). More specifically, Patnaik et al. increased the carbon flow through the shikimate pathway by overexpressing DDPA (aroG) alone and DDPA along with PPS (ppsa)43. All our designs recommend upregulating DDPA, and one, in particular, suggests overexpressing both DDPA and PPS, along with SHKK (aroK). Rodriguez et al. reviewed strategies that sought to increase the production of aromatic amino acids by either increasing the availability of the precursors to the shikimate pathway or enhancing the activity within the pathway42. The reviewed strategies directly targeting the shikimate pathway included the upregulation of DDPA, DHQS (aroB), or SHKK. Among the experimental strategies that targeted phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) or erythrose-4-phosphate (e4p) availability were those that inactivated the pyruvate kinases (pykAF), increased the activity of PPS, knocked out PGI (pgi), or redirected carbon to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) through the upregulation of TALA (talB), TKT (tktA), or G6PDH2r (zwf). NOMAD designs contained all previously mentioned interventions except for TKT, both in terms of the target enzyme and the direction of these manipulations (whether it was over or under-expression).\n\nInterestingly, although one of the generated designs proposes PYK downregulation in line with the experimental approach (Fig. 4, DDPA↑, SHKK↑, PYK↓), another design proposes its upregulation instead (DDPA↑, PYK↑, GLUDy↓), suggesting the possibility of alternative regulation patterns when targeting multiple enzymes simultaneously.\n\nIn addition to encompassing several reported experimental interventions, NOMAD also suggested targets that can achieve the same impact on anthranilate production as the expert-proposed candidates. Some of them frequently appeared in our designs, such as the downregulation of GLUDy (11/41 designs) and the upregulation of GLNS (8/41 designs). In contrast, the upregulation of ENO and ICL appeared only in one design each.\n\nK_trpD9923 models qualitatively capture recombinant behavior\n\nThe experimental study by Balderas-Hernandez et al.28 included fermentation data from two overproducing strains, W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr and W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA. Both strains contained a feedback-resistant version of aroG, while the latter also included the overexpression of transketolase (tktA). The two strains achieved mean anthranilate titers of 0.44 g/L and 0.75 g/L, respectively.\n\nWe implemented the genetic modifications of these two strains in K_trpD9923 to evaluate the predictive performance of the kinetic models against the experimentally observed responses. The experimental data were extracted from the work by Balderas-Hernandez et al. using an online tool, Webplotdigitizer44. To simulate the feedback-resistant version of aroG in W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr, we modified the K_trpD9923 models by removing DDPA inhibition by phenylalanine, creating K_trpD9923_d1. Similarly, to simulate W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA, we removed DDPA inhibition and increased the enzyme activities of TKT1 and TKT2, creating the in-silico double mutant, K_trpD9923_d2. Although the in-silico versions of the two strains provided lower median titers of anthranilate than those reported experimentally, they captured the performance trends of both interventions: K_trpD9923_d2 produced better median titers (0.35 g/L) than K_trpD9923_d1 (0.33 g/L) which were, in turn, superior to K_trpD9923 (0.31 g/L) (Fig. 5). Our simulated strains adhered more closely to the glucose uptake and growth of the reference strain than those observed in the experimental strains (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 5). This suggests that the in-silico strains diverted less carbon toward the shikimate pathway than the experimental strains did. Upon investigation of K_trpD9923_d2, we found that we needed to overexpress additional enzymes in the shikimate pathway to achieve titers that matched those of the experimental double mutant (Supplementary Note 5, Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, although we did not integrate information about the two recombinant strains in the model-building process, our models could reproduce the experimental observation that the difference in anthranilate titers between the two engineered strains was more significant than the difference between the wild-type and W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr strain.\n\nWe then evaluated the performance of the NOMAD designs by comparing their performance in fermentation simulations against those of K_trpD9923_d1 and K_trpD9923_d2. The superior median anthranilate titers attained by the NOMAD designs (0.42 g/L) compared to the in-silico versions of the two strains suggested that the strains W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr and W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA could be further improved (Fig. 5).\n\nPrioritizing NOMAD designs for robust implementation\n\nWe cannot know, a priori, which kinetic model from a population of models most accurately represents a cell’s physiology. We thus conducted a two-stage screening process to ensure that the engineering strategies we proposed for experimental implementation remain consistent across the range of phenotypes these models represent. In the first stage, we selected designs based on their expected performance across all the K_trpD9923 models NRA. In the second stage, we subjected these designs to more rigorous performance and sensitivity tests in a bioreactor setting. The preliminary screening, using log-linear approximations, mitigates the computational cost associated with nonlinear simulations.\n\nWe evaluated the 41 unique designs for each of the models in K_trpD9923 using NRA, ranked them, and selected the top five designs with the highest mean predicted increase in anthranilate yield (~93%) for further scrutiny (Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, all these designs belong to Cluster III in Fig. 4 and suggest redirecting carbon to the shikimate pathway by upregulating DDPA and increasing glutamate availability for glutamine synthesis by downregulating GLUDy (Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig. 7). Four of the designs also balance the availability of pep and e4p by targeting glycolysis (HEX1, PYK, PGI) or the pentose phosphate pathway (GND). The fifth design increases the enzyme activity of ANS, which is responsible for anthranilate synthesis.\n\nWe then subjected these five designs to nonlinear batch fermentation simulations that closely mimic real-world conditions (“Methods” section). Based on the evaluation results, we retained four designs that balance the availability of pep and e4p (Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig. 8). Due to the consistent presence of DDPA and GLUDy in all top designs, we evaluated the performance of designs when perturbing only these two enzymes. The results showed comparable anthranilate titers to the triple mutants, highlighting their significance in redirecting carbon toward anthranilate production (Supplementary Note 7, Supplementary Fig. 9). The results of the in-silico validation studies underline one of the key features of NOMAD: it is only through the use of nonlinear simulations that we could conduct such quality checks and glean insights into the applicability of the different designs.\n\nMulti-strain model calibration improves quantitative accuracy\n\nWhile the K_trpD9923 models successfully captured the qualitative trends of the experimental strains W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr and W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA, they fell short in quantitatively reproducing their experimental titers (Fig. 5). To enhance the quantitative accuracy of our models and provide refined designs for overproducing anthranilate, we developed kinetic models by integrating additional data on the physiology of recombinant strains.\n\nWe first generated 4,000,000 putative kinetic models using ORACLE and filtered them based on their linearized dynamics (“Methods” section). We then screened the remaining models based on their ability to match the experimentally observed growth, glucose uptake, anthranilate titer, and dynamics of W3110 trpD9923, as well as the anthranilate titer of W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr (“Methods” section). The screening yielded 35 models that could accurately reproduce the behavior of these two strains (Fig. 6a). The 35 models also outperformed K_trpD9923 in reproducing the anthranilate titer of W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA, achieving median titers of 0.65 g/L. This value is significantly closer to the experimentally obtained titers of 0.75 g/L compared to K_trpD9923_d2, which predicted a titer of 0.35 g/L. These results demonstrate the benefit of integrating additional information into the models when accessible.\n\nAmong these 35 models, 13 accurately reproduced the experimentally observed anthranilate titers for all three strains (Fig. 6b). We refer to these 13 models as eK_trpD9923, where ‘e’ stands for enhanced. The in-silico implementations of W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbr and W3110 trpD9923/pJLaroGfbrtktA strains are labeled as eK_trpD9923_d1 and eK_trpD9923_d2, respectively.\n\nDesigns from enhanced models provide superior performance\n\nWe used eK_trpD9923 and eK_trpD9923_d2 to generate designs that produced at least 95% of the maximal anthranilate yield for each model (“Methods” section). For eK_trpD9923, there were 123 such designs involving 34 unique enzyme targets. Bioreactor simulations of these 123 designs showed a higher median anthranilate titer (0.78 g/L) than the two experimental strains (Fig. 7a).\n\nFor eK_trpD9923_d2, 36 designs encompassed 14 different enzymes, with 13 designs being unique by membership. The decrease in the number of unique designs compared to the designs from eK_trpD9923 suggests that there were few remaining ways to augment the performance of the double mutant. We implemented these designs in bioreactor simulations and found that the mean anthranilate titer (1.16 g/L) was significantly superior to that attained by eK_trpD9923_d2 (0.71 g/L) (Fig. 7b). The designs also had a 6% increase in productivity (0.032 g/L/h vs. 0.03 g/L/h) when compared to eK_trpD9923_d2 despite reaching 90% of their maximal titers at a mean of 33 h as opposed to 21 h.\n\nWe performed a clustering analysis on the designs devised with eK_trpD9923 and eK_trpD9923_d2, which unveiled two distinct groups of designs sharing common characteristics in the former and three such groups in the latter (Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Figs 10 and 11)."
