        "text": "Software\n\nResearch work in BioSFGroup relies on computer software, with a strong preference towards the usage of free and open-source software, starting from the operating system. Our workstations and laptops run Ubuntu LTS, while our supercomputer Bura runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nThe reasons for the preference towards the usage of free and open-source software are the limited use conditions, limited extensibility, and license cost of proprietary software, which limit the science that we can do. The developments that we do can be found on our GitHub organization.\n\nThe list below is limited to the software we use; for a more comprehensive list of available free and open-source software for molecular modeling, see:\n\nPirhadi, S., Sunseri, J., and Koes, D.
