        "text": "Monday, April 27, 2020 - Wednesday, April 29, 2020\n\nMPI Magdeburg, Germany\n\nDuring this 3-day course, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling of biochemical networks including data access and storage due to the FAIR principles. The hands on exercises throughout the three days will ensure that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, simulating and storing biochemical networks. The first day SABIO-RK is used as a resource for kinetic data and FAIRDOMHub/SEEK is introduced as a data and model management platform fitted to the needs of systems biologists. The second day introduces principles of stoichiometric and constraint-based modeling coupled with hands on exercises using CellNetAnalyzer. The third day continues with kinetic modeling techniques which will be illustrated and exercised with COPASI."
