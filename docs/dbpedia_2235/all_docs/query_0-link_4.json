        "text": "The COPASI team announces the immediate availability of the stable release COPASI 4.43 (Build 288).\n\nA new release of COPASI has been made available. Please visit our free download page to retrieve this latest development release. Please note this version is released under the Artistic License 2.0, which is an OSI approved license. This license allows non-commercial and commercial use free of charge.\n\nRelease Date: April 29, 2024\n\nNew Features\n\nStandards\n\nSBML: Added support of SBML Level 3 Version 2\n\nBug Fixes\n\nGraphical User Interface (CopasiUI)\n\nEvent Overview: The assignments associated with an event are no properly displayed.\n\nOptimization: Changing of the subtask is now preserved without running the optimization task.\n\nTask and subtask names are now consistently handled in sensitivities, optimization, and scan.\n\nScan Task: Improved handling of output from subtask by allowing finer control over when output is captured.\n\nSimulation Engine\n\nFix calculations involving constant rates which were in certain situations (e.g. event assignments) not correctly updated.\n\nLanguage Bindings\n\nIn the case that multiple data models with the same name where loaded simultaneously, renaming an object in one data model does not longer effect references the other models.\n\nSetting CCopasiParameter values directly will now result in a call to the parent group to assure proper synchronization of related parameters."
