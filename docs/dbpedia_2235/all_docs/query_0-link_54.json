        "text": "Mathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. As models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. Clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. However, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise. We present Condor-COPASI, a server-based software tool that integrates COPASI, a biological pathway simulation tool, with Condor, a high-throughput computing environment. Condor-COPASI provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. Tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and submitted for execution on a Condor pool. Result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays. Condor-COPASI can effectively use a Condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. Condor-COPASI is free, open source software, released under the Artistic License 2.0, and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a Condor pool. Source code is freely available for download at http://code.google.com/p/condor-copasi/, along with full instructions on deployment and usage.\n\nThe overall aim of the BioSimGrid project (www.biosimgrid.org) is to exploit the Grid infrastructure to enable comparative analysis of the distributed results of biomolecular simulations. In particular this paper presents the implementation of the current BioSimGrid Web Portal. The portal has a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) framework built on the layer of OGSA (Open Grid Services Architecture) and OGSA-DAI (Open Grid Services Architecture Data Access and Integration) middleware. The PortalLib has been developed to allow RAD (Rapid Application Development) of portal applications. The portal also integrates PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and supports two levels of distributed SSO (Single Sign On): Grid certificate-based SSO for high security, and user/password based SSO for maximal flexibility.\n\nAs the scope and complexity of bioinformatic research widens, the need for a practical simulator for biochemical systems has grown considerably. The influx of experimental data begs the need for analytical tools; however, current implementations exhibit limitations with user-interactivity. We present CASS (Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator), an analytical modeling tool with a focus on a clean user-interface and malleable terms. Through adaptations of the Gillespie algorithm, our program accepts a broad range of user-specific input and simulates network interactions across time according to chemical propensity functions. CASS offers users a layout of parameter and plotting preferences in order to maximize compatibility for experimental models. This versatile tool shows promise for applications across the board in small-scale research."
