It provides easy access to the powerful biochemical model editing, simulation and analysis backend of COPASI from the convenient R command line interface. This allows the user to develop elaborate scripts and workflows for analyses that would require a great deal of tedious manual work otherwise. These scripts can then be run interactively from the R command line interface or be sent to cluster or cloud facilities for more demanding calculations.\n\nCoRC features:\n\nhigh-level API for COPASI in the R language.\n\nImmediate access to Râ€™s data analysis capabilities and publication-ready plotting.\n\nReproducible workflows from data generation to analysis and plotting (R scripts and notebooks).\n\nRule-based modification of model structure to test structural variations or create large models.\n\nScaling up assays, e.g. from 3 models to 3000.\n\nHandling of multiple models at once.\n\nParallelization on multi-core machines or computing clusters.\n\nIt is currently based on COPASI version 4.39 Build (272) and aims to closely follow COPASI releases in the future.\n\nCoRC comes with the Artistic License 2.0.
