The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community, organized by the OSG, and governed by the OSG consortium. In the last 12 months, we have provided more than 1.2 billion CPU hours to researchers across a wide variety of projects.\n\nThe Open Science Grid consists of computing and storage elements at over 100 individual sites spanning the United States. These sites, primarily at universities and national labs, range in size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of CPU cores.\n\nWhat kind of computational tasks are likely accelerated on the Open Science Grid?\n\nJobs run on the OSG will be able to execute on servers at numerous remote physical clusters, making OSG an ideal environment for computational problems that can be executed as numerous, independent tasks that are individually relatively small and short (see below). Please consider the following guidelines:\n\nIndependent compute tasks using up to 8 cores (ideally 1 core, each), less than 8 GB memory (RAM) per core, and 1 GPU, and running for 1-12 hours. Additional capabilities for COVID-19 research are currently available, with up to 48 hours of runtime per job. Please contact the support listed below for more information about these capabilities. Application-level checkpointing can be implemented for longer-running work (for example, applications writing out state and restart files). Workloads with independent jobs of 1 core and less than 1 GB RAM are ideal, with up to thousands of concurrently-running jobs and 100,000s of hours achieved daily. Jobs using several cores and/or several GB of RAM will likely experience hundreds of concurrently-running jobs.\n\nCompute sites in the OSG can be configured to use pre-emption, which means jobs can be automatically killed if higher priority jobs enter the system. Pre-empted jobs will restart on another site, but it is important that the jobs can handle multiple restarts and/or complete in less than 12 hours.\n\nSoftware dependencies can be staged with the job, distributed via containers, or installed on the read-only distributed OASIS filesystem (which can also support software modules). Statically-linked binaries are ideal. However, dynamically linked binaries with standard library dependencies, built for 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 6 or 7 will also work. OSG can support some licensed software (like Matlab, Matlab-Simulink, etc.) where compilation allows execution without a license, or where licenses still accommodate multiple jobs and are not node-locked.\n\nInput and output data for each job should be <20 GB to allow them to be pulled in by the jobs, processed, and pushed back to the submit node. Note that the OSG Virtual Cluster does not currently have a globally shared file system, so jobs with such dependencies will not work. Projects with many TBs of data can be distributed with significant scalability, beyond the capacity of a single cluster, if subsets of the data are accessed across numerous jobs.\n\nThe following are examples of computations that are a great match for OSG:\n\nparameters sweeps, parameter optimizations, statistical model optimizations, etc. (as pertains to many machine learning approaches)\n\nmolecular docking and other simulations with numerous starting systems and/or configurations\n\nimage processing (including medical images with non-restricted data), satellite images, etc.\n\nmany genomics/bioinformatics tasks where numerous reads, samples, genes, etc., might be analyzed independent of one another before bringing results together\n\ntext analysis And many others!\n\nThe following are examples of computations that are not good matches for OSG:\n\nTightly coupled computations, for example, MPI-based multi-node communication, will not work well on OSG due to the distributed nature of the infrastructure.\n\nComputations requiring a shared filesystem will not work, as there is no shared filesystem between the different clusters on OSG.\n\nComputations requiring complex software deployments or restrictive licensing are not a good fit. There is limited support for distributing software to the compute clusters, but for complex software (though containers may be helpful!), or licensed software, deployment can be a major task.\n\nPacific Research Platform (PRP)\n\nTHE PACIFIC RESEARCH PLATFORM\n\nThe PRP is a partnership of more than 50 institutions, led by researchers at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley and includes the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and multiple research universities in the US and around the world. The PRP builds on the optical backbone of Pacific Wave, a joint project of CENIC and the Pacific Northwest GigaPOP (PNWGP) to create a seamless research platform that encourages collaboration on a broad range of data-intensive fields and projects.\n\nNautilus Cluster\n\nNautilus is a heterogeneous, distributed cluster, with computational resources of various shapes and sizes made available by research institutions spanning multiple continents!
