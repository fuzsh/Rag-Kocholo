        "text": "What do I need to submit a new model?\n\nFirst, users need to register with BioModel to get user credentials (account and password). Using credentials, one can log in for their account and can submit model to BioModels. For more guidance, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 4).\n\nHow to register for a new user account?\n\nFor registering with BioModels, please visit the BioModels website and click on Register link from the right side the main menu. Follow the on-screen instruction for the next steps. For more guidance, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 5-8)\n\nHow to submit a new model?\n\nAnybody can submit a model to BioModels by creating an account on BioModels. Even if you are not the actual author or encoder of a model you can submit it for inclusion in BioModels. If you do so, you will be recorded as the submitter, not as an author or an encoder. However, we do encourage you to contact the original authors to be sure they are happy with the submission.\n\nTo submit a new model, user has to log in to BioModels using their user credentials. Post login, click on “Submit” tab and proceed with model submission. For details, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 9-16).\n\nIf a model is encoded in SBML or CellML, the submission is entirely processed, via the submission page. If the model is encoded using a different format, please read the section of this FAQ about the supported formats.\n\nOnce the model has been submitted, the submitter will receive an email notification with a unique, stable and perennial submission identifier. This identifier is composed of the string \"MODEL\" followed by 10 digits, for example MODEL1003250000. This identifier can be used to reference the model in publications, and once the model is publicly available on BioModels, users can directly access the model using this identifier.\n\nBioModels currently only publishes models which have been described in a peer reviewed scientific publication. Therefore, authors are encouraged to submit models before publication of the associated paper (and will receive an identifier that they can be used in the publication), but the models will only be publicly available on BioModels once the paper has been published.\n\nIn order to access a model, knowing it submission identifier, you can use the URL: https://www.ebi.ac .uk/biomodels/ followed by the identifier. For example: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1002160000.\n\nModels submitted to BioModels remain personally private to the submitter until they want to publish them from their side. User can update the model files, model name, publication details, etc. at any point in time before making the model public. All the changes are revision controlled.\n\nUser need to log in using their user credentials and go to “My Account” &rightarrow; “My Models”. This will display the list of models submitted by user. Click on the model for which you want to update the files. On the left of side of the page, you will find option to “Update”, “Publish”, “Convert” etc. Click on “Update” and follow the on-screen instructions. For details, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 20-28)\n\nMethod 1: This method is very similar to updating Model files. User need to log in using their user credentials and go to My Account, choose My Models. This will display the list of models submitted by user. Click on the model for which you want to update the publication. On the left of side of the page, you will find option to Update, Publish Convert, etc. Click on Update and continue clicking \"Next\" to go to the Publication page. Follow the onscreen instructions further. For details, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 20-28)\n\nMethod 2: This method is direct method for updating publication details. User need to log in using their user credentials and go to My Account &rightarrow; My Models. This will display the list of models submitted by user. Click on the model for which you want to update the publication. In the model overview tab, you will find the all the basic information of the model along with publication details. You will find a small tab called Edit next to publication. Click on Edit and you will be directed to a different page for publication editing option. Enter the details of new publication (ID), click Update and “Save” post crosschecking the details. For details, please refer: Model Submission guidelines (Slide 31-33)\n\nWhat will happen if I submit the model without publication details?\n\nYou and your model will not get into any trouble although your submission cannot provide any reviewed publication. Your model is only accessible to you and some authorised accounts like collaborators, reviewers. To ensure submissions to BioModels qualified and meet conventional standards, models on the publication requests without providing a peer reviewed publication will be published with caution and be flagged with an exclamation to notify users. The citation as well as usability of a model with the publication details are significantly higher than those without associating with any publication details.\n\nCan I submit a model before it is described in a published paper?\n\nYes. Models can be submitted prior to the publication of the associated paper(s). It is actually strongly advised to do so: at the submission time, each model is assigned a unique and perennial identifier which allows users to access and retrieve it. This identifier can be used by authors as a reference in their publications.\n\nIf you submitted a model before the publication of the associated paper, please keep us informed of the status of your publication. That way, we can make the model available from BioModels as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen submitting your paper, we encourage you to include the submission identifier in your publication and cite BioModels by referring to the guidelines on how to cite BioModels.\n\nAre the model changes maintained as revisions?\n\nAll the updating or changes done are maintained as revisions.\n\nWill a model be publicly accessible immediately after its submission?\n\nNo. Models are not directly visible and retrievable by the public as soon as they are submitted to BioModels Database. From submission to their public release, all models undergo various automated and manually performed curation and annotation steps to ensure a consistent level of quality and accuracy.\n\nNotes: It takes 24 hours at the latest for your model to be indexed and appeared in the public data in BioModels.\n\nMoreover, all models are only made publicly available from BioModels after the publication of the corresponding papers. Please refer to the section of this FAQ about the access to a model after its submission for more information about when a model will be publicly available from BioModels.\n\nWhy cannot I find my model in BioModels?\n\nProbably, you submitted the model but forgot to submit it for the publication. To know more about publishing a model, please consult making a model public.\n\nAfter you request to publish your model, it may take upto 48 hours for a model to be available in the search. If you still cannot find it, please contact us.\n\nWhat needs to be done to make model public?\n\nFirst, make sure your model associated with peer-reviewed publication details. If not done yet, please go update it as instructed in the section how to update model publication.\n\nUser need to log in using their user credentials and go to “My Account” &rightarrow; “My Models”. This will display the list of models submitted by user. Click on the model for which you want to Publish. On the left of side of the page, you will find option to “Update”, “Publish”, “Convert” etc. Click on “Publish” to request to make model public. Our database curators will take a quick look and publish the model if all is well. If not, curator will contact the model submitter. For details, please refer: BioModels model Submission guidelines (Slide 17-19 (New model) or 28-30 (existing model)).\n\nWhat will happen if you don’t the make model public?\n\nThe model will remain inaccessible to anyone except those with an authorised account (author, collaborators, reviewers). If a peer reviewed publication references the model identifier, BioModels will release the model as soon as technically possible, even without notification from the author. However, we appreciate if authors send us an update once they know the publication date of the associated publication.\n\nHow can reviewers access unpublished models?\n\nBioModels can provide access to unpublished models to reviewers. This is not automatic, so the model submitter needs to open a reviewer account for their unpublished model on their own (please read the instruction in the next paragraph). If you have any issue to use the online service, please don't hesitate to email us at biomodels-cura AT ebi.ac.uk . In this case, we will provide the submitter with a URL which can be used to download the model encoded in SBML. If security is a concern, we can supply a protected access, where reviewers will be asked for a password to access the model.\n\nHow to open the reviewer account for an unpublished model?\n\nWhen opening an unpublished model, the Reviewer button can be found on the model toolbox (see Fig. 1) which lets the submitter request a reviewer account for the model in question. BioModels will create a new account immediately to provide with read access to the model.\n\nWhat are the supported model encoding formats?\n\nBioModels is a strong advocate for interoperability and reproducibility, and the dissemination of models in semantically-rich community standards, along with associated data and metadata is a token of our commitment to these endeavours. We endorse submissions encoded in SBML, PharmML as well as COMBINE Archive. For a full list of supported formats, please consult the submission guidelines.\n\nIf you wish to deposit a model encoded in a different format, please check if it can be converted to one of the preferred formats (e.g. by consulting SBML Software Matrix). For instance, ODE models encoded in MatLab may be translated using MOCCASIN.\n\nIn case of questions or issues, please email biomodels-cura AT ebi.ac.uk - a private mailing list used by our curators.\n\nHow to submit a revised version of a model?\n\nIf the model is not yet published in BioModels\n\nYou can send us the revised version at: biomodels-cura AT ebi.ac.uk together with the model submission identifier and a comment explaining which modifications were made. This mailing list is not public and the only recipients are the curators of BioModels, so you can safely send us models not yet published this way.\n\nThe model has already been published in BioModels Repository\n\nAny modification that would lead to a change in the biological component, results, etc. should be considered as new entry. We could accept revision to the model if the authors found an error in the publication, which they have reported/submitted the correction (errata) to the journal. For all other changes, the revised model is treated as a new entry, and curated before publishing.\n\nIf you only made minor changes to the model, please follow the procedure described above (for not yet published models).\n\nHow to make metadata-only submissions?\n\nWe are supporting our users to deposit metadata-only submissions at the best convenience. To meet ones of the minimal submission constraints, users have to respect the following requirements:\n\nAt Step 1: Upload one CSV file as the main model file. This file contains all annotations which are used to describe the model in process. The structure of this CSV file is like the one published here. Certainly, you can upload other files.\n\nAt Step 4 (e.g., where all user's input is summarised): Check the box Is this a metadata submission? to mark the current submission as a metadata-only submission. If you fail this step, the model won't be indexed and is less searchable.\n\nIf missing either of these two requirements, your submission is likely improper.\n\nWe also strongly request users to provide more information about the model by adding a meaningful text in the model submission description box. The information can be left here such as how the model is encoded, what is the link of the original model.\n\nWhy does my SBML model contain no species or reactions after a conversion from CellML?\n\nThe issue is that there is no annotation in the CellML file that could help the converter to determine if a certain variable is a SBML species, parameter or compartment. And the same applies to any CellML equation.\n\nThe current version of the converter is not trying to do any complicated guesses and therefore converts every CellML variable into a SBML parameter and all the equations into rules. We are currently trying to define some annotations that would allow to create better SBML files from CellML and vice-versa, the ultimate goal would be to be able to do a round-trip conversion, starting either from a SBML model or a CellML model, without loosing any information.\n\nWhat do I do if I receive error messages when trying to submit a model?\n\nAny validation issues detected during the submission process will be reported as warnings, making it possible to proceed with the submission despite the encoding problems. It may be perfectly possible to submit a model that is incorrectly encoded in SBML and then share it with someone that can help fix the SBML representation.\n\nWhat checks are performed to ensure model correctness?\n\nBefore being made publicly available through BioModels, models are thoroughly verified. This involves several types of checks, some automated and some manually performed by a team of curators. The following checks are performed:\n\nThe syntax of the encoded file is verified. This implies a set of correct hierarchy of elements and attributes, a consistent use of identifiers, but also a deeper verification of the consistency of the model depending on its format (e.g. a parameter controlled by a rule cannot be declared constant in SBML).\n\nThe correspondence between the encoded model and the model described in the published article is checked. This implies verification of the structure of the reaction network, the formalisms used, the values of the parameters, the amounts and the units.\n\nFinally, the model is simulated to see if the published results can be reproduced. For this step, a different simulator is employed than the one used by the original authors in order to ensure the reproducibility of the results.\n\nThese checks come from the MIRIAM set of guidelines.\n\nWhat is MIRIAM?\n\nMIRIAM is the Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models (publication). Initiated by the BioModels.net project, it is a set of guidelines defining how a model should be encoded and annotated in order to be successfully distributed, exchanged and ultimately reused.\n\nIn particular MIRIAM requires that a model provides all the information necessary to be instantiated in a simulation, such as the initial conditions. In addition, the reaction graph generated from this simulation must reproduce the results of the original publication, in which the model was first described. Moreover, the MIRIAM guidelines require that all model components contain sufficient controlled annotation such that each component can be unambiguously identified. The MIRIAM Registry has been merged into Identifiers.org which has been developed specifically to provide generation and resolution services for unique and perennial identifiers to be used in controlled annotations.\n\nAll models stored in the curated branch of BioModels are MIRIAM-compliant.\n\nHow is MIRIAM compliance ensured?\n\nAll the models in the curated branch are fully MIRIAM compliant. Each the MIRIAM requirements is satisfied in the following way:\n\nModels be encoded in a public standard format\n\nAll models in BioModels are converted into valid SBML.\n\nModels must be clearly related to a single reference\n\nEach model is derived from a scientific publication.\n\nThe model must correspond to the biological processes represented in the publication\n\nModels are manually checked to confirm accurate biological representation in the model.\n\nThe simulation results generated from the model must reflect those in the reference publication\n\nModels are manually checked to confirm accurate simulation results are generated from the model. The result of this step is available in the \"Curation\" tab.\n\nExternal data resources annotation\n\nModels elements are well annotated.\n\nWhat is annotation, and what purpose does it serve in a model?\n\nOnce we ensure a model's correctness, we annotate the model with biological information. Model elements can describe a plethora of different entities, such as genes, proteins or metabolites. The usage of free text or non-standard nomenclature to identify those elements is not reliable, as it can introduce ambiguity to the model components, such that subsequent users of a model would struggle to identify the precise entities involved.\n\nAnnotation is a process that identifies model elements by linking them to existing data resources. This ensures that users will be able to understand the models and increases the possibility of their reuse. Moreover, annotation is a key element for processes such as data comparison, data integration and data conversion. Finally, it also allows the provision of models accurately through search engines (BioModels makes heavy use of annotation when users search for models of interest).\n\nModels in BioModels are provided with consistent annotation using unambiguous identifiers. Those identifiers are generated by the Identifiers.org services. They can be used to reference records from external databases (such as Taxonomy, EMBL-Bank or UniProt), terms from ontologies (such as Gene Ontology, SBO or ChEBI), publications, etc.\n\nFor more information about annotation, please refer our general introduction to the annotation of models.\n\nWho annotates the models?\n\nModels can be submitted to BioModels already annotated. In this case, any existing annotations encoded using the annotation scheme developed for SBML (introduced since Level 2 Version 2 and supported by numerous tools) will be extracted and recorded in BioModels.\n\nOur curation team currently checks existing annotations and adds new ones as necessary. We do encourage authors submitting the models to annotate their models as much as possible by following the guidelines that the curators use during annotation. This will help us accelerate the model curation process.\n\nHow are annotations stored in SBML?\n\nThe annotation of each model component is stored in the corresponding SBML element using the scheme initially designed by Nicolas Le Novère and Andrew Finney, and now part of SBML (since Level 2 Version 2). It relies on the use of RDF, Dublin Core, vCard and the BioModels.net qualifiers.\n\nPlease refer to the SBML specification for more information about the annotation scheme.\n\nWhen is a model completely annotated?\n\nAnnotating each model component with the most relevant resource records takes great efforts, especially since the number of submitted models has grown rapidly.\n\nBesides manpower limitations, this discrepancy is sometimes due to a lack of adequate or suitable resources for annotation, for instance for molecular entities which are created only for simulation purposes. Moreover, biological data resources are often slightly lagging behind newly generated knowledge, and it is possible that a particular resource does not offer the relevant information at the time the model is annotated. In the case of hierarchical controlled vocabularies (see Fig. 3), such as Gene Ontology or ChEBI, there is the option to use a term at a higher level of abstraction if the required precise term does not currently exist. Most often, one can always add some information, even if not optimal. Hence, model annotation needs to be, and indeed is, a continuous process.\n\nOur curators have been making use of a wide range of tools to perform their curation tasks: CellDesigner, COPASI, MathSBML, RoadRunner, SBMLOdeSolver, SBMLeditor, SemanticSBML, JigCell, VCell, XPP-Aut,...\n\nAt present, our curators are mostly using COPASI, VCell and Matlab.\n\nMoreover, they also use tools such as Gnuplot and various custom scripts.\n\nWhat is the non-curated branch of BioModels?\n\nThe success and rapid growth of BioModels has led to a couple of issues, both of which are handled using the non-curated branch of BioModels. Firstly, BioModels faces an ever-growing, and increasingly complex, number of model submissions which are growing at a pace that exceeds our curation capacity. Secondly, many of the models submitted, while syntactically correct, cannot be curated for various reasons. Hence, the non-curated branch of BioModels is a public holding area for models that have yet to be curated, or cannot be curated for various reasons. The models held in the non-curated branch are of four types:\n\nModels that are perfectly fine, but have yet to be curated.\n\nModels that are not curatable, since they are not MIRIAM compliant.\n\nModels that are not currently curatable, since they are not kinetic models (e.g. logical models and Flux Balance Analysis models).\n\nModels for which SBML supports only part of the description, most of it being in annotation (e.g. spatial models)."
