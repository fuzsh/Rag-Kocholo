The data is described in SBML together with annotations of entities and expressions to other resources and biological ontologies. These annotations comply with the MIRIAM standard (Minimal Information Requested In the Annotation of biochemical Models). For better tracking the exported SBML also contains SABIO-RK specific identifiers (e.g. for a reaction or a kinetic record) that are compliant with MIRIAM."
