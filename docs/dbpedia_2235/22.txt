Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Event Overview: The assignments associated with an event are no properly displayed.

Optimization: Changing of the subtask is now preserved without running the optimization task.

Task and subtask names are now consistently handled in sensitivities, optimization, and scan.

Scan Task: Improved handling of output from subtask by allowing finer control over when output is captured.

Simulation Engine

Fix calculations involving constant rates which were in certain situations (e.g. event assignments) not correctly updated.

Language Bindings

In the case that multiple data models with the same name where loaded simultaneously, renaming an object in one data model does not longer effect references the other models.

Setting CCopasiParameter values directly will now result in a call to the parent group to assure proper synchronization of related parameters.
