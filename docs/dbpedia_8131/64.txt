Our Lady of Ransom Church is one of the best architectural places to see in Kanyakumari. Built during the 15th century with the Gothic style of architecture, it is dedicated to Mother Mary. The walls and the ceilings contain the exquisite carvings of the 12 disciples of Christ, angels playing musical instruments and wooden carvings depicting the coronation of Mother Mary.
