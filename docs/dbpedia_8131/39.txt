A beautiful Christian Catholic Church located very close to the beach in scenic Kanyakumari. Its majesty and beauty are very ancient. It is a powerful Christian Catholic Church. People from many parts of the world come here for prayers. Its doors are always open for prayer. The beauty of this Catholic Church is stunning. This Catholic Church is very beautifully designed. Its towers and infrastructure are elegantly designed and Brahmi locks. People used to come here for prayers at all times. Especially in the evenings, people pass by in groups, families and individuals to sit and pray in this church. There is always a peaceful atmosphere inside this church. The people there maintain this church and its surrounding areas with beauty, neatness and dignity...

MUST Read and Must Visit ... Kanyakumari is a beautiful city that‚Äôs rich in culture and is also a place for worship. It is home to Our Lady of Ransom Church, a 100-year old Christian shrine that is run purely on faith and goodwill. It is situated close to the beach and stands at the height of 153m. It was constructed in Gothic style and looks incredible because of its pearl-white color and the ocean in the background. The church has 12 towers, each representing the 12 disciples of Lord Jesus. There are numerous stories and legends about the history of the shrine. The most noteworthy story is of the iron mast that floated in the sea and the amazing story about how it was erected in the courtyard of the church.

"The church of rock and pillar is nothing without the many colours of light." - Angela Abraham The stained glass windows and the lit up alter with her sari clad form throws an ethereal glow on the entire church. It would be utterly beautiful when the light hits the windows during sunset. Our Lady of Ransom Shrine sits outsides to the left of the Church.

Famous Church which is very near to Kanyakumari Beach! We can reach the church in a short period by walking from Kanyakumari beach because it is less than 0.5KM from it. Every year I visit the church in December during the festival time. We can get positive vibes during the visit. The surroundings of the place are clean. Tourist‚Äôs people can visit the church on normal days because parking facilities are available.

Exact year of construction not known..But seeing the architecture it seems to be constructed during the Portuguese rule..That is during early 18th century.. Church looks great coloured in white.. Surrounding area has got fisherman houses.. Very close to the sea & Vivekanand rock.. Taking a four wheeler can be a problem as roads to the church are too narrow.. Don't worry..It's walking distance from most of the spots at Kanyakumari..

Visited the Church in the evening on Monday. No service at that time. We can spend some peaceful time in the premises. Climbed up to the adoration chapel adjacent to the church from where one can have a great view of the sea and the rock memorial.

I recently visited Our Lady of Ransom Shrine in Kanyakumari and was very impressed. The all-white church with its tall spires is striking from afar and even more impressive up close. The interior is well-maintained and offers a serene atmosphere. If you're seeking a quiet place for prayer or reflection, this shrine is perfect. It provides a welcome respite from the bustle of Kanyakumari. Built in the 16th century by the Portuguese, the church has a rich history that adds another layer to the experience. Whether you're religious or simply appreciate beautiful architecture, Our Lady of Ransom Shrine is a worthwhile stop in Kanyakumari.

Our Lady of Ransom Church, Kanyakumari Overview Our Lady of Ransom Church is a famous Catholic Church that is located in the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu and was built in dedication to Mother Mary. A brilliant example of Gothic architecture, the church was built during the 15th century and looks breathtakingly beautiful against the blue lashing waves of the ocean behind it. The gold cross on the central tower of the church further adds beauty and charm to this magnificent structure, and its beauty and tranquillity are what attract people the most. Our Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the congregation in Spain, which had long ago redeemed the Christians from Muslim invasions in 1218. The people of Kanyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and began to call their patron by the name of Alangara Upakara Matha. It is in her honour that this splendid church has been built. The colourfully stained windows of the church throw multi-hued lights inside the main building, and the three white spires of the primary structure rise up to the sky. The church is in its full splendour in evenings and at night, when it gets lit up. What enthrals people the most is the statue of Virgin Mary, clad in a sari, at the altar. And this in itself is reason enough to visit the enchanting Our Lady of Ransom Church.
