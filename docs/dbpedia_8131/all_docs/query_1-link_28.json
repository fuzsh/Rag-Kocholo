        "text": "The unique experience\n\nConstructed to honor Mother Mary, this is Kanyakumari’s most beautiful church boasting of a Gothic style of architecture. The most eye-grabbing feature to leave you awestruck is its amazing pearl white facade as well as its surroundings painted with the blue oceanic waters that offer a brilliant contrasting visual to all. You’ll be thrilled to see the mother’s statue draped in a sari. Unlike any other church in the world, here, you’ll not find bench rows for sitting. Instead, people sit down at the floor and pray. Unique, right! Apart from these two unusual features, the lighting of the Church at night is a must to be seen.\n\nOur Lady of Ransom story\n\nBuilt in the 15th century, the church was originally established by St.Francis Xavier as Our Lady of Delights Grotto which eventually came to be known by its present name. Initially, it was merely a structure with a thatched roof. It was developed into a very important church later on, in 1700 AD. Mother Mary’s statue that is presiding here was transported from Rome and was positioned in the middle of the church’s altar. Here, the mother is worshiped as Alangara Matha. One can also see the statues of St. Francis Xavier and St. Joseph alongside here. The new facade of this church was built under a person named Pakiam Pillai who transformed it into a world-famous structure. The church’s bells were bought from Italy in the year 1900. Therefore, it stands as a significant attraction in Kanyakumari tour packages.\n\nMore about the place\n\nTouted as one of the holiest places to visit in Kanyakumari, the church has ornate interiors that are breath-taking. The columns erected inside offer assistance to the church’s roof. There are 7 doors that symbolize the 7 fruits of the Holy Spirit. The interiors are also beautified with wooden sculptures that show Mother Mary’s coronation as the Queen of both earth and heaven. Other striking features of intrigue are the effigies of Christ’s 12 disciples as well as the sculptures of angels that are famous for their intricate detailing.\n\nWhat else?\n\nKanyakumari Church festival\n\nOne must come down here during the Annual Feast, a celebration that lasts for 10 days. It includes morning mass, preaching as well as special vespers. It is a gala festival where you can also see the Corpus Christi Procession in its full glory. To mark the 10th day of the festival, a golden car procession is taken out, and must not be missed for anything in this world.\n\nLady of Ransom Church timings\n\nThis church remains open throughout the week from Monday to Sunday. Devotees can enter it between 5 pm to 6.30 pm.\n\nKanyakumari Church mass timings\n\nOn weekdays, the holy mass is at 6.15 AM, while on Sundays, the timings are 5.30 AM, 7.00 AM and 4 PM. The Saturday mass is held at 6.30 PM.\n\nKanyakumari tourist places such as this must find a place in your itinerary.\n\nHow to reach\n\nKSTC Bus Stand - 2 kilometers"
