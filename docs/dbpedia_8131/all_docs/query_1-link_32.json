        "text": "‚ÄúA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step‚Äù ‚Äì Lao Tzu\n\nHow many times do we miss to take that first step ? Planning for a trip & then not going for it. Does it happen with you also ? I have seen most of my trips are sudden ones ‚Äì the unplanned types. And, I have a crazy friend who has convinced me many times to travel at spur of the moment. So, I got my tickets booked & ran off to Tamil Nadu without a fixed itinerary.\n\nFirst obvious stop was Chennai as my friend was meeting me there. And, same evening we left for southern most tip of Indian mainland -Kanyakumari. Overnight train journey spent in gossiping reading-sleeping.\n\nList of things to do in KanyaKumari ‚Äì\n\nIts easier to find a hotel near the beachfront. All hail TripAdvisor for the help! So many places to visit & less time. We were picky about the places to visit. First stop for the day was Vivekanada Rock Memorial. It takes another hour after getting the ticket to boarding the ship for Rock Memorial.We have wait in a queue under a shelter. I have been here thrice & still get the same thrill. There is a meditation room where you can sit & be enchanted by the mantras.Away from land & amidst high winds, you can just let go everything. Watching the waves lash at the rocks for hours.Baby I am addicted üôÇ\n\nYou can also visit nearby Thiruvalluvar Statue. Tough luck that I have always found it closed off due to tidal waves.Next we went to Bhagvathy Amman Temple(Devi Kanya Kumari), it‚Äôs a temple dedicated to Kanya kumari Deity. There are many legends associated with the place.\n\nWe also went to Our Lady of Ransom Church. It‚Äôs a Catholic church & you get to see Mother Mary clad in a Saree. For photographers all these places are like treasures. Every nook & corner beholds your attention. I am the opposite kind and get dumb on entering such places, thus forget to take beautiful pictures. Does this happen only to me or you too feel the same ?\n\nThe fun part of the day was visiting the Wax Museum. I enjoyed being childish and posing for photographs with the statues of Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam & many more.\n\nThey also have a room dedicated to 3D paintings, which was most busy place in the museum. The 9D movie show felt like being part of a video game.\n\nAll these places are within few kilometers range and we had covered them by walking around on foot. That‚Äôs how we discovered small shops with amazing coffee & vada üôÇ\n\nThe better part of the evening can be spent sitting on the beach and watch the sun do down. Behind us was the Tsunami Memorial & watching it you realize the fierce nature the sea can take. God bless all those souls ! At any given moment in day, people gather at the beach & its tough to see any free space available. Surrounded by many, yet alone with your thoughts.\n\nThis was just day one of the trip & I will continue more about the trip in the coming blog series.You can also checkout the photo blog about my Tamil Nadu travel here. Do share your special memories attached with this place. Would love to read your stories.\n\nI am taking part in the #DailyChatter challenge by Team Blog Chatter.
