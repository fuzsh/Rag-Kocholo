Kanyakumari is a beautiful city that’s rich in culture and is also a place for worship. It is home to Our Lady of Ransom Church, a 100-year old Christian shrine that is run purely on faith and goodwill. It is situated close to the beach and stands at the height of 153m. It was constructed in Gothic style and looks incredible because of its pearl-white color and the ocean in the background. The church has 12 towers, each representing the 12 disciples of Lord Jesus. There are numerous stories and legends about the history of the shrine. The most noteworthy story is of the iron mast that floated in the sea and the amazing story about how it was erected in the courtyard of the church.\n\n3 people found this review helpful 👍\n\n5/5 Amanda R. 2 years ago on Google\n\n\"The church of rock and pillar is nothing without the many colours of light.\" - Angela Abraham The stained glass windows and the lit up alter with her sari clad form throws an ethereal glow on the entire church.

Church looks great coloured in white.. Surrounding area has got fisherman houses.. Very close to the sea & Vivekanand rock..

A brilliant example of Gothic architecture, the church was built during the 15th century and looks breathtakingly beautiful against the blue lashing waves of the ocean behind it. The gold cross on the central tower of the church further adds beauty and charm to this magnificent structure, and its beauty and tranquillity are what attract people the most. Our Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the congregation in Spain, which had long ago redeemed the Christians from Muslim invasions in 1218. The people of Kanyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and began to call their patron by the name of Alangara Upakara Matha. It is in her honour that this splendid church has been built. The colourfully stained windows of the church throw multi-hued lights inside the main building, and the three white spires of the primary structure rise up to the sky. The church is in its full splendour in evenings and at night, when it gets lit up. What enthrals people the most is the statue of Virgin Mary, clad in a sari, at the altar. And this in itself is reason enough to visit the enchanting Our Lady of Ransom Church.\n\n5/5 Johnson R. 2 years ago on Google\n\nMust visit place at Kanyakumari\n\n5/5 Aravin F. 2 years ago on Google\n\nPeaceful place to worshipping clean and tidy\n\n5/5 Vincent K. 2 years ago on Google\n\nOldest chruch in Town."
