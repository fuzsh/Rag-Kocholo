        "text": "The best time to visit the church is from October to March when the weather is pleasant. Additionally, visiting during the annual feast in December can be a unique experience as you can witness special celebrations and local festivities.\n\nWhile there is no strict dress code enforced, visitors are expected to dress modestly out of respect for the religious nature of the site. Shoulders and knees should ideally be covered.\n\nThe church is usually open to visitors from early morning until the evening. However, the visiting hours can vary, and it is advisable to check the latest timings before planning your visit.\n\nThe church features a towering central spire, beautiful stained-glass windows, and intricate carvings. The white facade of the church is illuminated at night, creating a serene spectacle against the dark sky."
