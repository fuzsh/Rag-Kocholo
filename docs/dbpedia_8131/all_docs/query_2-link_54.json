        "text": "What earlier generations held as sacred remains sacred and great for us too,\n\nand it cannot be all of a sudden entirely forbidden and even considered harmful.\n\nBenedict XVI letter to Bishops July 7, 2007\n\nOn all fourth class ferias it is permitted to celebrate a Votive Mass without commemorating the feria Mass. The list below will grow as time permits.\n\nThe Daily Mass for the Dead (for All the Faithful Departed) is permitted on any 4th class feria (except during Christmastide and Lent). These are already shown as an option (when appropriate) in the listing of daily Masses above. The Anniversary Mass is of the third class.\n\nThe following pdf's are 'forms' that permit the insertion of a saint's name in the appropriate place(s) of the text (indicated by < >). The intent of these \"Commons\" is to facilitate the celebration of a saint in the catalogue of saints that has no specific Proper text."
