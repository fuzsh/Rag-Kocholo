        "text": "In honor of St. Michael – Feast Day September 29\n\nA Prayer to St. Michael\n\nGlorious St. Michael, Prince of the heavenly hosts, who standest always ready to give assistance to the people of God; who didst fight with the dragon, the old serpent, and didst cast him out of heaven, and now valiantly defendest the Church of God that the gates of hell may never prevail against her, I earnestly entreat thee to assist me also, in the painful and dangerous conflict which I have to sustain against the same formidable foe. Be with me, O mighty Prince! that I may courageously fight and wholly vanquish that proud spirit, whom thou hast by the Divine Power, so gloriously overthrown, and whom our powerful King, Jesus Christ, has, in our nature, so completely overcome; to the end that having triumphed over the enemy of my salvation, I may with thee and the holy angels, praise the clemency of God who, having refused mercy to the rebellious angels after their fall, has granted repentance and forgiveness to fallen man. Amen.\n\nFeast of Our Lady of Ransom\n\nDouble Major / White Vestments\n\nMissa “Salve, sancta parens”\n\nThe Order of Our Lady of Ransom was founded in the Thirteenth Century by St. Peter Nolasco (Jan. 31) and St. Raymond of Pennafort (Jan. 23), aided by King James of Aragon. The object of the Order was to redeem Christians held in slavery by the Mohammedans. Pope Gregory IX instituted the feast of Our Lady of Ransom and afterwards it was extended by Pope Innocent XII to the Universal Church.\n\nINTROIT: Sedulius\n\nHail, holy Mother, thou who didst bring forth the King who rules heaven and earth for ever and ever. Ps. 44: 2 – My heart hath uttered a good word : I speak my works to the King. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Hail, holy Mother… Salve, sancta parens, enixa puerperal Regem: qui caelum, terramque regit in saecula saeculorum. Ps. 44: 2 – Eructavit cor meum verbum bonum : dico ego opera mea Regi. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio et nunc et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Salve, sancta parens…\n\nCOLLECT\n\nGod, Who for the ransoming from slavery of the Christians held captive by pagans wast pleased, through the most glorious mother of Thy Son to enrich Thy Church by a new order: grant, we beseech Thee, that she, whom we piously venerate as the founder of so great a work, may, through her merits and prayers, deliver us from all our sins and from the captivity of the devil. Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, Forever and ever. R.Amen.\n\nEPISTLE: Eccles. 24. 14-16\n\nLesson from the Book of Wisdom\n\nFrom the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him. And so I was established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem. And I took root in an honorable people, and in the portion of y God his inheritance, ad my abode is in the full assembly of saints.\n\nGRADUAL\n\nThou art blessed and venerable, O Virgin Mary, who with purity unstained was found to be the Mother of our Savior. Virgin Mother of God, He whom the whole world was unable to contain enclosed Himself in thy womb, being made man.\n\nALLELUIA\n\nAlleluia, alleluia. V. After childbirth thou didst remain a virgin: O Mother of God, intercede for us. Alleluia.\n\nGOSPEL: Luke 11: 27-28\n\nAt that time, as Jesus was speaking to the multitudes, a certain woman from the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to Him: ‘Blessed is the womb that bore Thee and the paps that gave Thee suck. But He said :’Yea, rather, blessed are they who hear the world of God and keep it.’\n\nOFFERTORY: Luke 1: 28, 42\n\nLet us pray. Hail, Mary, full of grace: the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.\n\nSECRET\n\nBy Thy mercy, O Lord, and the intercession of blessed Mary, ever virgin, may this oblation profit us unto eternal and present prosperity and peace. Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God.\n\nPREFACE Preface of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nIt is truly meet and just, right and availing unto salvation, that we should at all times and in all places give thanks unto Thee, O holy Lord, Father almighty and everlasting God. That on the Festival of the blessed Virgin Mary, we should praise, bless and proclaim Thee. For she conceived Thine only-begotten Son by the over-shadowing of the Holy Ghost; and losing not the glory of her virginity, gave forth to the world the everlasting light, Jesus Christ our Lord. Through whom the angels praise Thy majesty, the Dominions worship it, and the powers stand in awe. The Heavens and the heavenly Hosts, and the blessed Seraphim join together in celebrating their joy. With these we pray Thee join our voices also, while we say with lowly praise:\n\nSANCTUS, SANCTUS, SANCTUS Dominus Deus Sabaoth. Pleni sunt coeli et terra gloria Tua. Hosanna in excelsis. Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini. Hosanna in excelsis.\n\nCOMMUNION: Hebrews 9: 28\n\nBlessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary, which bore the Son of the Eternal Father.\n\nPOSTCOMMUNION\n\nLord, grant, we beseech Thee, that, having received the aids of our salvation, we may always and everywhere be protected by the patronage of Blessed Mary ever virgin, in veneration of whom we have made this offering to Thy majesty. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God For ever and ever."
