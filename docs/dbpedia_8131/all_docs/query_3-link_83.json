Since our earliest days as a church plant in 2013, we’ve worked hard to renew that same awe for Him in others by pursuing Jesus in our public and private lives in a way that highlights His greatness instead of our own. We’re so grateful to have three locations to do this in Downtown Nashville, Franklin, and Spring Hill. But the story is just beginning and has a place for you within it. You’re invited to be a part of the next chapter.\n\nKids & Students\n\nThere are a lot of influencers in kids’ lives. But no one is more called to this role than their families. But often, parents and guardians feel hesitant, intimidated, or under-equipped to guide their kids & students spiritually. We partner with families to bring resources, experiences, and encouragement so that this important responsibility can be uncomplicated…and even a little fun. Our KidCity environments are designed to awaken wonder and our leaders are called and committed to helping families teach the truth about God’s love. And City Students provides a place where middle and high school students can grow in their understanding of God’s story and their place within it."
