        "text": "Disciple Leadership PPP 160\n\nEffective parish pastoral planning requires a shared leadership among clergy and laity which calls forth the gifts of visioning, planning, empowering, and evaluating. These gifts are placed at the service of the community for the fulfillment of the parish mission. Ministers, disciples and ambassadors of the parish are the sustainability of PPP 160 for St Joseph’s.\n\nWhile the pastor bears the ultimate responsibility and authority within a parish, the gifts of the laity “as each one has received” (1 Pt 4:10) are needed and welcomed in the service of the parish as well. Those who serve the parish exercise your gifts to vision, plan, empower, and evaluate the parishes program and initiatives in light of the parish mission.\n\nAlthough all members of the parish are called to leadership, each will carry out that responsibility in a unique way, based on his or her own gifts, talents, and style of leadership. “There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same spirit” (1 Cor 12:4). Together their gifts are at the service of one another and of the parish community. They do so, however, as servants of the gospel:\n\nYou know the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt. But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant; whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave. Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. (Matt 20:25-28)\n\nAs pastor and parishioners, we do not work for or under one another, but rather with one another for the Kingdom of God. Together we lead the parish in the ongoing discernment in realization of its mission.\n\nLet us together identify opportunities for our present and future.\n\nThis is our prayer:\n\n(A prayer used before every session of the Second Vatican Council)\n\nWe come before you, Holy Spirit,\n\nconscious of our sinfulness,\n\nbut aware that we gather in your name\n\nCome to us, remain with us,\n\nand enlighten our hearts.\n\nGive us light and strength\n\nto know your will,\n\nto make it our own, and to live it in our lives.\n\nGuide us by your wisdom,\n\nsupport us by your power,\n\nfor you are God,\n\nsharing the glory of Father and Son.\n\nYou desire justice for all:\n\nenable us to uphold the rights of others;\n\ndo not allow us to be misled by ignorance\n\nor corrupted by fear or favor\n\nUnite us to yourself in the bond of love\n\nand keep us faithful to all that is true.\n\nAs we gather in your name\n\nwe may be temper justice with love,\n\nso that all our decisions\n\nmay be pleasing to you,\n\nand earn the reward\n\npromise to be good and faithful servant servants.\n\nYou live in reign with the Father and the Son,\n\none God, for ever and ever.\n\nAmen\n\nPRAYER TO OUR LADY OF BOSTON\n\nGlorious Mother of God and powerful patron of all human endeavors, protect the city of Boston and all who dwell in it.\n\nIntercede with your Divine Son to bless it’s blue bay and rising hills; to bless its ancient streets and historic monuments; to bless its newest arteries an ever-changing face.\n\nWithin its boundaries ask him to sanctify those who live and labor here; cause their works to prosper and bring happiness to those whom they love.Ask him to give guidance to all who are called to provide leadership in this community and grant them an honest intelligence and far seeing wisdom.\n\nFor our city, O Holy Mary, be a Morning Star lighting the daybreak; a Tower of Ivory guiding those who wander; House of God giving shelter to all who are troubled.\n\nAs we pass through our fair city and elsewhere be for us a Refuge of Sinners and a Comforter of the Afflicted and then our last hours, O Mary, be the Gate of Heaventhrough which we may pass to eternal life.\n\nIntercede with your Holy Son, our Redeemer, that his Providence may watch over Bostonand its people; let his grace strengthen, guide, defend and protect it’s every venture-oldand new; and finally in all our aspirations and actions, “as He was with our fathers, so may God be with us.”\n\nAmen\n\nArchbishop Richard J. Cushing\n\nDecember 12, 1957\n\nThirty Days’ Prayer to Saint Joseph\n\nIN HONOR OF THE 30 YEARS HE SPENT WITH JESUS AND MARY\n\nFor Any Special Intention\n\nEver blessed and glorious Joseph, kind and loving father, and helpful friend of all in sorrow! You are the good father and protector of orphans, the defender of the defenseless, the patron of those in need and sorrow. Look kindly on my request. To you, loving guardian of the Family of Nazareth, do I go for help and protection.\n\nListen, then, I beg you, with fatherly concern, to my earnest prayers, and obtain for me the favors I ask.\n\nI ask it by the infinite mercy of the eternal Son of God, which moved him to take our nature and to be born into this world.\n\nI ask it by the weariness and suffering you endured when you found no shelter at the inn of Bethlehem for the holy Virgin, nor a house where the Son of God could be born. Then, being everywhere refused, you had to allow the Queen of Heaven to give birth to the world’s Redeemer in a cave.\n\nI asked by the loveliness and power of that sacred name, Jesus, which you conferred on the adorable Infant.\n\nI ask it in that painful torture you felt at the prophecy of holy Simeon, which declared the Child Jesus and His holy Mother future victims of our sins and of their great love for us.\n\nI ask it through your sorrow and pain of soul when the angel declared to you that the life of the Child Jesus was sought by His enemies. From the evil plan you had to flee with Him and his Blessed mother to Egypt. I ask it by all the suffering, weariness, and labors of that long and dangerous journey.\n\nI ask it by all your care to protect the Sacred Child and His Immaculate Mother during your second journey, when you were ordered to return to your own country. I ask it by your peaceful life in Nazareth where you met with so many joys and sorrows.\n\nI ask it by your great distress when the adorable Child was lost to you and His Mother for three days. I ask it by your joy at finding Him in the Temple, and by the comfort you found at Nazareth, while living in the Company of the Child Jesus. I asked by the wonderful submission He showed in His obedience to you.\n\nI ask it by the perfect love and conformity you show in accepting the Divine order to impart from this life, and from the company of Jesus and Mary. I ask it by the joy which filled your soul, when the Redeemer of the world, triumphant over death and hell, entered into the possession of His kingdom and led you into it with special honors.\n\nI ask it through Mary's glorious Assumption, and through that endless happiness you have with her in the presence of God.\n\nOh good father! I beg you, by all your sufferings, sorrows, and joys, to hear me and obtain for me what I Ask. (Here name your petitions or think of them.)\n\nObtain for all those who have asked my prayers everything that is useful to them in the plan of God. Finally, my dear patron and father, be with me and all who are dear to me in our last moments, that we may eternally sing the praises of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.\n\nJESUS, Mary and Joseph\n\n“A blameless life,\n\nSt. Joseph,\n\nMay we lead ,\n\nby your patronage\n\nfrom danger freed\"\n\n_______________\n\nSt. Joseph's NIN NID outreach program and use of Livestreaming Services\n\nwere recently recognized in these Beacon Hill Times Articles:\n\nParish Program Offers Helping Hand To Neighbors In Need\n\nSt. Joseph's uses Technology to remove Geographic Constraints\n\nSt. Joseph Parish wishes to thank our neighbors at the WestEnd Museum, especially for the great work they did in providing us these facts about the origin of our beloved church: St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church.
