        "text": "A Call to be a quiet modern apostle!\n\n“My children, I am calling you to apostolic privilege!” -Our Lady\n\nLIFE OFFERING TO THE INTENTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY\n\nThe following messages, prayers, and promises were received by a privileged Hungarian nun, a consoling soul, who in her humility and obedience to her spiritual director wished to remain anonymous while living (her name was Sr. Maria Dolores, O.S.M., born Elizabeth Krizsan). She died on May 27, 1998, at the age of 96.\n\nMary, our Heavenly Mother, implores those who receive Holy Communion daily, or at least weekly, to offer their lives for the greater glory of God and the salvation of souls, that the souls of sinners may not be damned but receive, at least at their last hour, the graces of eternal life.\n\nTHE FIVE PROMISES OF OUR HEAVENLY MOTHER TO THOSE WHO OFFER THEIR LIVES TO HER\n\nTheir names will be written in the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, inflamed by love.\n\nTheir life offering, together with the infinite merits of Jesus, can save many souls from damnation. All souls who will live until the end of the world will benefit from their life offering.\n\nNone of their family members will go to hell, even if it seems otherwise, because they will receive, in the depths of their souls, the grace of sincere contrition before the soul departs from their bodies.\n\nOn the day they offer their lives, their loved ones suffering in Purgatory will be released.\n\nI will be with them at the hour of their death. They will not know Purgatory. I will carry their souls straight to the presence of the Glorious Trinity, where they will live with me in a special place created by God and will rejoice forever.\n\nTEXT OF THE LIFE OFFERING\n\nMy dear Jesus, before the Holy Trinity, Our Heavenly Mother, and the whole Heavenly Court, united with your most precious Blood and your sacrifice on Calvary, I hereby offer my whole life to the intention of your Sacred Heart and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Together with my life, I place at your disposal all Holy Masses, all my Holy Communions, all my good deeds, all my sacrifices, and the sufferings of my of my entire life for the adoration and supplication of the Holy Trinity, for unity in our Holy Mother Church, for the Holy Father and priests, for good priestly vocations, and for all souls until the end of the world.\n\nO my Jesus, please accept my life sacrifice and my offerings and give me your grace that I may persevere obediently until my death. Amen.\n\n* * *\n\nThis life offering must be made with a humble heart, firm resolution, and clear intent. All prayer, good deeds, suffering, and work done with a pure intention has great merit, if it is offered together with the merits, the sufferings, and the Blood of Jesus Christ.\n\nIt is recommended that you make this life offering as soon as you feel ready, and to renew it from time to time.\n\n* * *\n\nThe following are excerpts from the messages received by the privileged soul.\n\nOUR HEAVENLY MOTHER: “My children who offer your lives, make the act of contrition every day! Make it not only for yourselves but for all men. This will continually weaken the power of evil to tempt and will help all souls to free themselves from the slavery to sin.\n\n“If you continually practice contrition for others, this will act as an antiseptic to arrest the spread of the “virus” of sin. It will stop the infection, illness and death of souls. See how great the power of sincere contrition is if it comes from the depths of the heart! It can heal, cleanse and save the life of the soul.\n\n“In addition to contrition for the whole of humanity, unite yourself with my Immaculate Heart to storm heaven with prayer for the forgiveness of sins. Thus, you will become united with me and become genuine and intimate helpers of Jesus as fishers of men.”\n\nPRAYERS OF CONTRITION\n\nO my Jesus, I love you over and above everything! For the love of you I am sorry for all my sins. O merciful love, I ask pardon for the sins of the whole world. United with the Immaculate Heart of our Heavenly Mother, I ask pardon for all my sins and for all the sins of my brothers and sisters that have been and will committed until the end of the world. My dear Jesus, united with your Holy Wounds, I offer my life to the Eternal Father according to the intention of the Sorrowful Mother. Virgin Mary, Queen of heaven and earth, Mediatrix of all grace and mercy, our only refuge and hope, pray for us!\n\nOUR LADY (to those who offer their lives): “If the Eternal Father chooses to give a soul the grace of being among the elect, He will order that soul to become similar to His only-begotten Son while on earth; but in what way should this soul be like His Son? In love and acceptance of sufferings. If you follow your Jesus in these two ways, then the Eternal Father will recognize His Holy Son in you.\n\n“Souls chosen by the Eternal Father to offer their lives must strive to save as many other souls as possible. This can be done through fervent prayer, through the practice of love, through meekness, humility and self-denial, but above all through the patient acceptance of sufferings. I believe that my Motherly Heart will find among my children souls who love God with the love of the martyrs.\n\n“My children, even during the greatest trials, hold my motherly hand with unbounded trust. Come together with me to the Sacred Heart of Jesus: He is your strength on your earthly pilgrimage. Thus, strengthened by Him daily, you will march toward your eternal dwelling place of happiness where you will recognize each other in glorious ecstasy, you who sacrificed your lives for the glory of God and the salvation of souls. Then my Holy Son will embrace you to His flaming Heart, and He will immerse you in the ecstasy of the united love of the Trinity. In this state of eternal bliss, you will rejoice forever, together with those souls who were able to gain eternal life because of your selfless life sacrifice.\n\n“Hope and love, because God is with you. My children, each offered life is pleasing to God. Therefore, do not limit your sacrifice. This should be your life slogan: Give more and love better!\n\n“The design of my Holy Son included the deeds of the elect. He is eagerly waiting to see if they fulfill His plan or cross it. He could realize His plan without them, but in His merciful goodness, He wants them to participate in the distribution of the fruits of redemption throughout the world. Do you know why I am telling you all this? Because I watch, with great anguish, the fight of the souls in the Church. It is very painful for my motherly heart that there are many, even among the elect, who do not believe that God can do whatever He wants! Unfortunately, they are using their knowledge not to increase faith and unity, but to encourage disbelief.\n\n“You, however, my life-offering children, should believe with a living faith. You should strive to increase in your hearts the flame of faith, because when faith becomes stronger, it will increase your hope and love too.\n\n“Once you surrender yourself to great sufferings of either body or soul, the experience can be a fountain of immeasurable grace. You can pay for the sins of your life, or for the things you have failed to do. Or if this has already been paid, then the merit of your patient sufferings can be applied to conversion of hardened sinners. By that you can glorify God. The souls you save by your obedient acceptance of sufferings may even become saints. When the weight of suffering lies heavily on you, whether illness or suffering in the soul, always remember that you are just a pilgrim on this earth. Beyond the grave there is a wonderful world that was prepared by God for His faithful children, where your happiness will be greater than that which your patient and obedient sufferings could possibly merit. As it is written: your soul will forever be immersed in such happiness that eye has not seen, ear has not heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those that love Him (1 Cor. 2:9).\n\n“No matter how heavy your suffering on earth, it will last but a short time. Rejoice while you suffer, because you are proceeding toward a sure goal, and at the end of this road, your Heavenly Mother is waiting for you to embrace you with the eternal love of the Trinity.\n\n“My children! I am calling you to apostolic privilege. You are chosen to suffer martyrdom of the heart for the sins of others. And by this voluntary life sacrifice – coming from your good heart – God will be able to pour out the flood of His mercy. Think about that!\n\n“My beloved children! If you carry patiently the little thorn from the cross of my Son that He has given to you, you can save countless souls from eternal damnation. Thus, holding the hand of your Heavenly Mother, you too will partake in the work of redemption. My Children! Do not ask for sufferings, but always accept with humility and selflessness those that the Lord hands to you.\n\n“My dear children! You should burn with fervor to help save those who suffer in the slavery of sin. In life, captivity often results in freedom and uplifting of the soul. But most prisoners of sin are more pitiable than those in earthly prison because they are not aware that they are imprisoned by their depravity, and thus they do not even ask for freedom. The blindness of the soul, with its darkness, is more pitiable than anyone in a dark prison. I would like to free these souls. Since they do not want to be set free, I need the help of my faithful children and their life-offering, the patient acceptance of sufferings and trials, in order that I may save them. Combined with the treasures of my Holy Son, that will enable me to save not only your loved ones, but a multitude of souls from everlasting darkness – even those who will be born later, until the end of the world.\n\n“My children! Give everything to me and I will give everything to my Holy Son, united with my interceding prayers. I am the Woman who sets slaves free.”\n\n“My beloved Children: My Holy Son finished the work of redemption. His own sacrifice was enough, but He left a little part to you. He calls and elects certain souls to share His sacrifice in an intimate union with Him. He suffered for the glory of God and for the salvation of souls. It is a joy for my Son to see Himself in them.”\n\nThe Seer (April 20, 1978): When I was in Church once, I rejoiced to see many present offering their lives faithfully to God’s will. My spiritual director led the offering prayer. I wondered whether these people would fulfill their life offering. Is it enough to give oneself once? Will these people live accordingly or even think about it later?\n\nThen I heard Jesus addressing me: “My child, if someone performs the life offering only once – do you understand, only once, once in an elevated moment of grace, when in his soul the flame of heroic offering will be lit – this soul has determined his whole life even if he never thinks about it again. He will be the property of the most Holy Hearts. Time does not exist before my Father. He sees the life of a person in its wholeness. Even if someone has made some other offering before, this life offering will include everything, and it is above all. This will be the crown, the most beautiful adornment, for that soul. This will determine the place and rank of nobility of this soul in the eternal kingdom!”\n\nJesus (Sept. 24, 1971), Feast of Our Lady of Ransom: “My little apostles! My Mother is the most beautiful Temple of God. She is the most beautiful among all My living Temples. On her altar is the throne of the Trinity. This altar is adorned with the most beautiful red roses grown under My cross, together with the lilies of immaculate purity. The sanctuary lamp of this altar is fueled with the oil of humility, and it is surrounded with the candles of never-ending selfless love, and the lights of these candles illuminate this altar for every soul.\n\n“In this temple the tired will find rest, those who cry will find consolation, sinners will find conversion, and the ambitious will find maternal love. Visit often this most beautiful temple of God. Through this temple, you will find the grace that will enable you to reach the eternal kingdom.\n\n“My children! Even one soul who puts himself on the sacrificial altar, prompted by the love of Me and the love of his brothers, will magnify a hundredfold the Glory of God and the gladness of My Mother. Stand up, My children, with great fervor!\n\n“My children! The fate of My Church is always in My Heart, since I promised that the gates of hell will not prevail against her. I still have many good and true priests, but many have discarded the cloth of election. In place of the unfaithful, disloyal priests, I created My fishers of souls! These are the priests of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, who are called by the Lord of the harvest to work quietly for souls and for the glory of God. Even if there is a shortage of priests – and so it seems – a multitude of souls will escape damnation, because instead of disloyal priests there stands the life offering love!”\n\nNihil Obstat: P.
