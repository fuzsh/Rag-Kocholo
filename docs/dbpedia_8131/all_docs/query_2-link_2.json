Ransom Church is all about setting captives free. We are a group of people journeying towards Jesus, and we’re excited you’re considering joining us on that journey. Whatever is holding you captive right now in your life, Jesus wants to set you free of those burdens. He paid the price so you could be set free. And He is who we are chasing. Welcome to Ransom Church."
