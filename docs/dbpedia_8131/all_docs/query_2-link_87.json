        "text": "Our Lady of Ransom Church is a famous Catholic Church that is located in the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu and was built in dedication to Mother Mary. A brilliant example of Gothic architecture, the church was built during the 15th century and looks breathtakingly beautiful against the blue lashing waves of the ocean behind it. The gold cross on the central tower of the church further adds beauty and charm to this magnificent structure, and its beauty and tranquillity are what attract people the most.\n\nOur Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the congregation in Spain, which had long ago redeemed the Christians from Muslim invasions in 1218. The people of Kanyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and began to call their patron by the name of Alangara Upakara Matha. It is in her honour that this splendid church has been built. The colourfully stained windows of the church throw multi-hued lights inside the main building, and the three white spires of the primary structure rise up to the sky. The church is in its full splendour in evenings and at night, when it gets lit up. What enthrals people the most is the statue of Virgin Mary, clad in a sari, at the altar. And this in itself is reason enough to visit the enchanting Our Lady of Ransom Church."
