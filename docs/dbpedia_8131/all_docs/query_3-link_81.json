        "text": "CV NEWS FEED // A parish in the Diocese of Lexington, Kentucky, is offering blessings for same-sex couples by appointment, against the direction of the Vatican instructions, which emphasize that such blessings should be spontaneous.\n\nHistoric St. Paul Catholic Church in Lexington has highlighted on its “LGBTQ+ Ministry and Fortunate Families” webpage: “Same-sex couples who would like a blessing, please contact Father Richard” at the provided phone number or email.\n\nCatholicVote reached out to Fr. Richard, requesting comment on the fact that offering scheduled blessings goes against the Vatican document Fiducia supplicans, which states that blessings for same-sex couples should be spontaneous. CatholicVote also asked how and where the blessings are given so they may comply with the document’s instructions. CatholicVote did not receive a response by the time of publication.\n\nThe webpage also has a “Prayer to Our Mother of Pride,” which is posted beside an image of Our Lady wrapped in a Pride flag, holding her infant Son Jesus.\n\nUnderneath the photo is a caption that reads: “Mother, the rainbow is the lasting sign of God’s covenant; as God’s love wrapped you in grace, may it also wrap your LGBTQ+ children and assure them of God’s love.”\n\nAs CatholicVote previously reported, the Diocese of Lexington also recently issued a statement regarding a biological woman who identifies as “Brother Christian Matson,” a hermit in the Diocese. In the statement, the Diocese used male pronouns in reference to Matson, who identifies as “transgender.”\n\nThe Diocesan statement notes that Bishop John Stowe, who is bishop of the Diocese of Lexington, “accepted [Matson’s] profession and is grateful to Brother Christian for his witness of discipleship, integrity and contemplative prayer for the Church.”\n\n>> Our Sunday Visitor Editorial Board says KY diocese statement about ‘trans’ hermit ‘betrays the truth’ <<\n\n“Fiducia supplicans” highlights that “the pastoral sensibility of ordained ministers should also be formed to perform blessings spontaneously that are not found in the Book of Blessings.”\n\nIn a Jan. 4 news release that the Vatican issued about “Fiducia supplicans,” the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith also highlights several requirements for blessings for same-sex couples.\n\n“To be clearly distinguished from liturgical or ritualized blessings, ‘pastoral blessings’ must above all be very short,” the news release reads. “These are blessings lasting a few seconds, without an approved ritual and without a book of blessings.”\n\n“It remains clear, therefore, that the blessing must not take place in a prominent place within a sacred building, or in front of an altar, as this also would create confusion,” the news release adds:\n\nFor this reason, every Bishop in his Diocese is authorized by the Declaration Fiducia Supplicans to make this type of simple blessing available, bearing in mind the need for prudence and care, but in no way is he authorized to propose or make blessings available that may resemble a liturgical rite."
