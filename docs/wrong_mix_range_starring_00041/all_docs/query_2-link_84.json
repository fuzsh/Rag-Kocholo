        "text": "AKA Harrison Julius Shearer\n\nBorn: 23-Dec-1943\n\nBirthplace: Los Angeles, CA\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Comic, Actor, Radio Personality\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Almost half the voices on The Simpsons\n\nHarry Shearer started in show business with a recurring role on Jack Benny's radio program, where he worked alongside another legendary voice actor, Mel Blanc. When Benny brought his radio show to television 9-year-old Shearer played Benny as a child, arguing with his father about money. In his first movie roles, he had one line in Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, and a more substantial part in the CinemaScope Biblical epic The Robe with Richard Burton. At 13, Shearer played Wally's troublemaking friend in the pilot episode of Leave It To Beaver with Jerry Mathers, but when Beaver was sold as a series his character was re-cast with Ken Osmond and rewritten as the infamous Eddie Haskell.\n\nAfter college, Shearer worked as a reporter and taught high school before earning his first success as a stand-up comic. He wrote for and took small roles in Laverne & Shirley and National Lampoon's Disco Beaver from Outer Space, co-wrote Albert Brooks's satire of reality television Real Life, and came to stardom as hairy faux rocker Derek Smalls in This is Spinal Tap with Christopher Guest and Michael McKean.\n\nHe briefly wrote for Saturday Night Live in 1979, quitting when his sketches were rarely seen on the show. He returned as a featured player in SNL's \"all-star\" cast of 1984-85 -- alongside Guest, Martin Short, and Billy Crystal, but Shearer quit again in frustration midway through the season. NBC's press release cited \"creative differences\", and Shearer quipped to a reporter, \"Yeah, I was creative and they were different\". He never mentions SNL on his résumé.\n\nOn The Simpsons, Shearer gives voice to about half the town of Springfield, including millionaire Montgomery Burns and his infatuated assistant Waylon Smithers, very Christian Ned Flanders, chuckling Dr Julius Hibbert, put-upon Principal Seymour Skinner, pious Rev Lovejoy, newscaster Kent Brockman, Homer's beer buddy Lenny Leonard, stoned bus driver Otto, town founder Jebediah Springfield, and musclebound action hero Rainier Wolfcastle, star of the McBain movies. Shearer also spoke for Carl Sagan in My Stepmother Is an Alien with Dan Aykroyd and Alyson Hannigan.\n\nAn occasional character actor in movies, he provided comic relief as a recruiter in the space saga The Right Stuff with Sam Shepard, played G. Gordon Liddy in Dick with Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams, a reporter in The Truman Show with Jim Carrey, and a struggling actor in For Your Consideration with Eugene Levy. He contributes left-leaning on-line essays for The Huffington Post, and authored the musical play J. Edgar!, about J. Edgar Hoover's long gay affair with henchman Clyde Tolson.\n\nBack on the radio, he stars in his own weekly satirical Le Show, syndicated on non-commercial radio stations and available as a podcast. In his long career, Shearer says his favorite moment is still the first time he said something that made Jack Benny laugh.\n\nFather: (d.)\n\nMother: Dora Warren (bookkeeper)\n\nWife: Penny Nichols (singer-songwriter, div. 1977)\n\nWife: Judith Owen (singer-songwriter, m. 28-Mar-1993)\n\nUniversity: BS Political Science, University of California at Los Angeles\n\nUniversity: MA Political Science, Harvard University\n\nSpinal Tap\n\nNewsweek\n\nAustrian Ancestry Paternal\n\nPolish Ancestry Maternal\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nTELEVISION\n\nJack & Jill Dr. Wilfred Madison (1999-2001)\n\nThe Simpsons Numerous Voices (1989-)\n\nSaturday Night Live Writer, etc. (1979-85)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS DIRECTOR\n\nThe Big Uneasy (30-Aug-2010)\n\nTeddy Bears' Picnic (29-Mar-2002)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nMr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project (13-Oct-2007) · Himself\n\nThe Simpsons Movie (21-Jul-2007) [VOICE]\n\nFired!
