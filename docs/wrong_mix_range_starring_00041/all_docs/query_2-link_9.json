        "text": "This Is Spinal Tap, American film comedy released in 1984 that parodies the “rockumentary” film genre via the exploits of the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Directed by American filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner, the film was largely improvised by Reiner and the core cast members—American actors Michael McKean and Harry Shearer and British-American actor and director Christopher Guest. Its success led to a series of documentary parodies directed by Guest, including Waiting for Guffman (1996), Best in Show (2000), A Mighty Wind (2003), and For Your Consideration (2006).\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nClassic Closing Lines\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap purports to document the band—lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (portrayed by Guest), guitarist and lead singer David St. Hubbins (McKean), bassist Derek Smalls (Shearer), keyboardist Viv Savage (David Kaff), and drummer Mick Shrimpton (R.J. Parnell)—as they tour the United States for the first time in six years in support of their new album, Smell the Glove. The tour starts well, but a series of unfortunate events very quickly sends it into a downward spiral. Performances are canceled, the band’s record company is unhappy with an offensive album cover concept for Smell the Glove, virtually no one shows up for a record store signing, and stage props malfunction. As Spinal Tap performs at increasingly smaller venues, including an amusement park and a weekend social at a U.S. Air Force base, infighting threatens to tear the band apart. When the band’s morale is at its lowest, the members learn that their song “Sex Farm” has become a big hit in Japan, leading to a professional rebirth.\n\nGuest, McKean, and Shearer went to great lengths to make Spinal Tap look like a real heavy metal band, specifically through their flamboyant clothing and hair. The portrayal was so effective that many filmgoers thought they were watching a documentary about a real musical group. American talk show host Joe Franklin also was unaware that the band was a parody when he interviewed the actors in 1984.\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap features several running jokes, most notably the ones about the mysterious deaths of the band’s drummers, starting with John (“Stumpy”) Pepys (portrayed by American actor Ed Begley, Jr.), who died in a “bizarre gardening accident.” Subsequent drummers died by aspiration and asphyxiation and, in two separate incidents, of spontaneous combustion. In one of the film’s most famous scenes, Nigel Tufnel proudly shows documentary filmmaker Marty DiBergi (portrayed by Reiner) a custom-made guitar amplifier with knobs that can take the volume, tone, and effects settings to a maximum of 11, rather than the standard 10, whenever the band’s music needs an extra boost onstage—which inserted the phrase “up to eleven” into the public parlance. In 2002 the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary added the phrase and defined it as “up to maximum volume.”\n\nGuest, McKean, and Shearer were experienced musicians who played their own instruments for the songs in the film. R.J. Parnell was a drummer in several bands, including the progressive rock band Atomic Rooster, and David Kaff also had a musical background. Reiner, Guest, McKean, and Shearer wrote all of the songs performed in the film, including “Sex Farm,” “Gimme Some Money,” “(Listen to the) Flower People,” and “Big Bottom.” The film also includes cameo appearances by notable American actors Billy Crystal, Anjelica Huston, Fran Drescher, and Fred Willard."
