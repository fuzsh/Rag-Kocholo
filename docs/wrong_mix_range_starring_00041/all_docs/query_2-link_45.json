        "text": "The long-awaited sequel to Rob Reiner’s beloved 1984 mockumentary, This Is Spinal Tap, will begin principle photography in late February, Reiner said on the RHLSTP With Richard Herring podcast. He also said that, along with the original cast of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, real-life rock stars Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Garth Brooks will appear in the film. Listen to Reiner’s full conversation with Richard Herring below.\n\nIn the new film, Guest, McKean, and Shearer will reprise their roles as Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls, respectively. Reiner will also play Marty DiBergi, the fictional director who films Spinal Tap in the movie.\n\nIn a 2022 statement to Deadline, Reiner, seemingly in character as DiBergi, said: “The band was upset with the first film. They thought I did a hatchet job and this is a chance to redeem myself. I am such a big fan and I felt bad they didn’t like what they saw in the first film.”\n\nReiner had hoped to release Spinal Tap II on March 19, 2024, to coincide with the original movie’s 40th anniversary. Shooting was delayed, however, due to the monthslong Hollywood strikes. An updated release date has not yet been announced, per Variety."
