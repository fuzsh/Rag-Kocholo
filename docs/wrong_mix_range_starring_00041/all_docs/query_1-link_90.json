        "text": "Despite the massive amount of buzz the Barbie movie has already accrued on social media, fans of the toy franchise still have a long wait before the film premieres in July. However, if any Barbie-heads need to kill four minutes of the three-and-a-half month countdown to the Greta Gerwig project, they can always just watch David Lynchâ€™s prequel.\n\nDon't Miss\n\nBack in 2012, the Mulholland Drive director moved into the coffee business and debuted signature cup of joe, the David Lynch House Blend, a brand of beans up to the surreal standards of the man who once claimed to regularly consume 20 cups of coffee each day. In order to advertise his confusingly tame commercial venture, Lynch balanced out the banality of a bag of coffee beans with a short Barbie film that rivals anything Margot Robbie may muster this summer."
