        "text": "We go back to one of Ron Howard's earliest directorial projects. This criminally underrated made-for-TV drama from 1978 is about suburban high-school outcasts looking for purpose by forming a rock band. It's a story about the underdog. The Goliath, and the movie's indirect antagonist, is Torbin Bequette (Mark Wheeler), lead singer and guitarist of the mega-popular band Rapid Fire. A Robin Zander look-a-like, who is naturally full of himself and apparently can only play \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" Torbin is your stereotypical high school pretty boy. It's quite fun to watch.\n\nPlayed by Diane Lane in this severely underappreciated 1984 film directed by Walter Hill ( The Warriors, 48 Hrs.) and dubbed \"A Rock & Roll Fable.\" Ellen Aim is a feisty, sexy singer who rose from the rough streets of Richmond to rock stardom with her backing band, The Attackers.\n\nHowever, when her homecoming show goes awry — she's kidnapped by a local gang, then rescued by an ex-boyfriend (Michael Pare), who was hired by her manager and current beau (Rick Moranis) — we learn that Ellen is neither grateful nor personable. She does have a commanding stage presence, as seen performing hits \"Nowhere Fast\" and \"Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young,\" both written by the late, great Jim Steinman. Laurie Sargent and Holly Sherwood provide Aim's vocals.\n\nWe deliver a twofer with the brother-sister rock duo who make up The Barbusters, a Cleveland bar band from this likely forgotten 1987 drama starring Michael J. Fox and the legendary Joan Jett. Joe (Fox) is rather strait-laced, hardworking, and actually supporting Patti (Jett), who is just trying to get by through any means necessary, and her young son. The siblings are different but share a love of playing music and dreams of making it big. Both keep their respective lives from falling apart and the relationship going, even when times get rough.\n\nThere are those casual movie fans who might forget that Tom Cruise was in this 2012 movie version of the popular stage musical. And while it does not seem like he's on screen that long, Cruise's Jaxx is the epitome of the self-indulgent, essentially washed-up rock star still expecting to be praised and adored as the frontman of the once-mega-popular Arsenal. However, the music essentially saves Stacee from his reckless self and revives his career, even if he's probably one of the least likable characters on this list.\n\nIt's pretty easy to the like the Josie character — in all formats (comic book, television, film). Based on the popular comic that started in the 1960s, the 2001 movie version is below average, but Rachael Leigh Cook's Josie outshines bandmates Melody (Tara Reid) and Valerie (Rosario Dawson). She's a rather talented musician, intelligent, and ambitious. In the film version, Josie is slightly edgier but in a tame, riot grrrl kind of way. Letters to Cleo frontwoman Kay Hanley, who has also worked with Dropkick Murphys, provided the vocals that Cook lip-synced.\n\nThe bassist and leader of the indie/grunge band Sex Bob-Omb, who are described from within the camp as \"terrible\" and not all that good musically. However, when it comes to science-fiction-vibed rock stars from 2010, Scott (Michael Cera) is the best. That doesn't mean Scott, in superhero form, is not entertaining. He's a nerdy, hopeless romantic in love with Amazon delivery girl Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As he tries to take down each of Ramona's ex-boyfriends, Scott, like his band, is an underdog and pretty easy to rally behind.\n\nThis 2001 film is based on the late 1990s stage musical. Hedwig (aka Hansel Schmidt), brilliantly played by John Cameron Mitchell, is trying to deal with a failed marriage while posing as a woman to leave East Germany just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Stuck in the United States, Hedwig finds their passion fronting a rock band, with one noticeable anatomic claim to fame. The flamboyant Hedwig is the true talent amid a misfit collection of band members forced to pay their dues in hopes of fulfilling their dream of being a rock star or just having a satisfying life.\n\nFormerly known as The Oneders, once the spelling was changed and \"Skitch\" (Tom Everett Scott) jumped behind the drum kit, The Wonders became overnight kings of the Playtone galaxy in this 1996 classic starring Tom Hanks. The true backbeat of these Erie, Pa. rockers from the 1960s, Guy's up-tempo back on the band's one-hit wonder \"That Thing You Do,\" transformed the tune from a sweet ballad, the rollicking Beatles-esque favorite. Though The Wonders didn't have much of a career together, the sentimental and unselfish \"Skitch\" is easily the most likable member of the group.\n\nMark Wahlberg's Chris Cole character is inspired by the true story of \"Ripper\" Owens, the frontman of a Judas Priest tribute band who eventually replaced the legendary Rob Halford when he left the actual group. Chris is an obsessed Steel Dragon fan and fronts their most popular tribute band, then gets his shot with the actual group. In the process, Chris realizes that the life of a rock star, even if his dream job, is not all that satisfying, especially after learning he's simply a hired gun. Pop-metal singer Miljenko \"Mike\" Matijevic (Steelheart) provides Cole's screeching vocals in a movie that's schlocky but entertaining.\n\nEddie Wilson (Michael Pare) was a good-looking, soulful-sounding rock star who earned popularity, presumably during the late 1960s, after he and his band, the Cruisers, made a name for themselves on the Jersey shore. Eddie came off as a bit of tortured soul/brooding romantic but was also insecure. The fame and notoriety proved too much for Eddie to handle. So, why not fake your death, then resurface in Montreal as a construction worker? (That was the storyline of the forgotten 1989 sequel.) John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band supplied the music for Eddie and the band, including the 1980s radio hit \"On the Dark Side.\"\n\nFans of comedy movies from early this century should remember that we were first introduced to Russell Brand's Aldous Snow in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). Two years later, with his career sagging and life in a state of dysfunction, Snow got his own film. The free-spirited British rocker hopes to revive his career with help from an unlikely escort in budding talent scout Aaron Green (Jonah Hill). Of course, physically getting Snow to Los Angeles' famed Greek Theatre to play this potentially career-saving gig is the hilarious challenge of the film.\n\nAs the vocalist and bassist of Crucial Taunt, Cassandra (Tia Carrere) is the perfect blend of talent, intelligence, and beauty. Of course, she can totally rock, so it's easy to see why Wayne was so smitten with her. Cassandra can hold her own with anybody. She's also not afraid to mix it up, especially if anybody gets beer on her stage outfit. Carrere gets extra points because she sang all of Cassandra's songs. She's also one of the few rock stars that have compassion and doesn't care about fame.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Elisabeth Moss' 2018 performance as the frontwoman of the punk band Something She, make sure to search it out. On stage, Becky seems to be in complete control, in her element, playing to crowds cheering her name. However, through a series of vignettes, we learn that Becky has little control over her off-stage life. Burdened by the usual rock star issues — drugs, alcohol, selfishness, and paranoia — Moss is gripping in the title role, and the film heads in a direction that doesn't follow the usual path of related movies about once-great musicians falling on hard times, then forced to pick up the pieces.\n\nFrom what we know about Citizen Dıck , the band is huge in Belgium. Of course, that's probably because of talented members Stone, Jeff, and drummer Eddie Vedder (also real-life members of Pearl Jam, for those not in the know). Though, frontman Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon) is often considered the weak link in the Seattle band known for its local hit \"Touch Me I'm Dıck.\" That said, Cliff has ambition in this 1992 Cameron Crowe favorite. He aims to be the biggest rock star in the world. The only problem is that he doesn't realize how poor a musician he is considered ( check out his forgotten demos). He's also not very good at installing a car stereo system.\n\nFrom Richard Linklater's 2003 hit School of Rock, Jack Black's Dewey Finn lives to rock — and essentially nothing else. However, he's annoying, vulgar, and so wrapped up in the rock star persona that his over-the-top antics get him kicked out of his local rock band. In need of money, Dewey turns to deception by taking on his roommate's identity to get a substitute teaching job at a prep school. While there, he introduces a strait-laced classroom of students to the world of rock music and enlists them to help win a local Battle of the Bands. In the end, Dewey enables these students to break free from their rather stuffy comfort zones while they give him a purpose beyond just striving to be a rock star.\n\nMore from Cameron Crowe with his popular 2000 comedy-drama. While Stillwater's music packs them in, the inter-dynamic of the band is what makes the group interesting. There's that love/hate relationship between guitarist Hammond (Billy Crudup) and frontman Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), who didn't make this list but is well worthy of a mention. The complex Hammond is often the face of the band, which does not play well with the outspoken Bebe. That tension made for some special music, like \"Fever Dog.\" Yet, it proves to be young, budding journalist William (Patrick Fugit) who can tap into Russell's depth and get him to open up about what makes the musician hum.\n\nIn 1979, Bette Midler's screen debut earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination. Mary Rose \"The Rose\" Foster is a burned-out rock star from the late 1960s, much like Janis Joplin, on whom the character reportedly is based. Rose is overworked, under-rested, and fueled by booze and drugs to get her through an off-stage life that's lonely and rather depressing. Midler delivers an emotional performance that's raw, revealing, and disturbing. The Rose is not an easy movie to watch, but the character just might be the most authentic one on this list.\n\nOK, technically, or at least according to Jake (John Belushi), The Blues Brothers Band was a rhythm and blues outfit. However, Jake and Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) also deliver some covers of such rock classics as \"Gimme Some Lovin '.\" Due to the success of the act Aykroyd and Belushi developed on Saturday Night Live, this fictional band eventually became a massive real-life success. Backed by celebrated real-life musicians such as Steve \"The Colonel\" Cropper, Donald \"Duck\" Dunn, and Willie \"Too Big\" Hall, the band remains one of the great collections of musical talent ever assembled.\n\nIt's just too hard to pick one or two members of Spinal Tap. So, we'll highlight the classic lineup from the greatest fictional rock band ever. Like The Blues Brothers Band, Spinal Tap ultimately found a place in the real world thanks to the success of this mockumentary cult classic from 1984. Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) comprise the British three-piece that has a higher opinion of itself that rivals public perception. Nigel is a control freak obsessed with an amp that \"goes to 11.\" Derek is known for sporting a cucumber in his pants.\n\nMeanwhile, David gives off a pompous, self-indulgent vibe and is often sedated. Of course, it's all fantastically hilarious. Do we remember the Stonehenge debacle?"
