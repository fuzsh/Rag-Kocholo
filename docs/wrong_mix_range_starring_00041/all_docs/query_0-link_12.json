        "text": "Harry Shearer is an actor and comedian best known for his performances in the fictional band Spinal Tap and the animated sitcom The Simpsons. Early in his career, he provided his voice talent to overdub characters during the post-production of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\n\nShearer began performing as a child in radio, television, and films. During the 1970s he performed in comedy clubs and local radio and did some comedy writing.[3] In 1977 he took a small job providing additional voices for what was then titled Star Wars.[2]\n\nShearer rose to prominence in 1979 when he joined the cast of Saturday Night Live. His signature roles in This is Spinal Tap (1984) and The Simpsons (1989–2015), as well has his NPR program Le Show (1983–present), anchored a long and varied career in films, television, and music.[4]\n\nIn 2012, blogger Drew Stewart, trying to verify an internet rumor, contacted Shearer on Twitter asking if he had voiced an imperial officer or a rebel in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Shearer responded that he had provided voices for the film but could recall no specifics on the lines or the roles.[2] Stewart wrote about the exchange in his blog Cinetropolis.[5] Fans have identified Shearer's voice in two roles: Death Star officer Khurgee and rebel pilot Dex Tiree. Stewart also suggested Devastator gunnery officer Hija as a possible role.[5] Some media outlets have since reported that these roles were voiced by him.[6][7][8]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Title Contribution(s) Notes 1977 Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope Additional voices Uncredited\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]"
