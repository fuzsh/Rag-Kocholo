        "text": "“These go to 11.”\n\nThis is Spinal Tap is still the gold standard in mockumentaries. Since most of the movie’s dialogue is improvised, I also thought it would be interesting to see the script, written by Christopher Guest & Michael McKean & Harry Shearer & Rob Reiner, from which the cast worked. The entire script is written this way, so it’s only 60 pages long.\n\nHere is the famous “These go to 11” scene featuring documentary director Marty (Rob Reiner) interviewing rocker Nigel (Christopher Guest)\n\namidst all the guitars and amps he’s acquired over the years.\n\nINT. DETROIT CONCERT VENUEDuring the soundcheck, Nigel is showing Marty\n\nDiBroma his large collection of guitars, including\n\na cordless model which plays through its amp by\n\nmeans of a tiny radio transmitter. It's like\n\nwatching a kid show off his toys. He points out\n\nthat he has his amps customized with special dials.\n\nUnlike most amps, whose highest volume level is\n\nindicated by a \"10\" on the dials, Nigel's dials go\n\nup to 11.\n\nHere is a transcript of the last part of the scene’s dialogue from the movie:\n\nNigel Tufnel: The numbers all go to eleven. Look, right across the board, eleven, eleven, eleven and...\n\nMarty DiBergi: Oh, I see. And most amps go up to ten?\n\nNigel Tufnel: Exactly.\n\nMarty DiBergi: Does that mean it's louder? Is it any louder?\n\nNigel Tufnel: Well, it's one louder, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You're on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you're on ten on your guitar. Where can you go from there? Where?\n\nMarty DiBergi: I don't know.\n\nNigel Tufnel: Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\n\nMarty DiBergi: Put it up to eleven.\n\nNigel Tufnel: Eleven. Exactly. One louder.\n\nMarty DiBergi: Why don't you just make ten louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder?\n\nNigel Tufnel: [pause] These go to eleven.\n\nAnd now the scene as it plays in the movie:\n\nMy movie Alaska was a Castle Rock production, so I was hanging around their offices doing rewrites when Christopher Guest and company were shooting Waiting for Guffman. As a bonus, I got to see some of the dailies and read the script. Guest uses pretty much the same approach with every one of his movies which include Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration: Work out the story with each scene’s beginning, middle and end, cast the movie with skilled improvisational actors, try out a variety of takes, edit the best story possible. Spinal Tap was in effect the proof of this particular concept — and it has proven to work wonderfully as with this great scene."
