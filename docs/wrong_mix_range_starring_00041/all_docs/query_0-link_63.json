        "text": "The 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap, created by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner, has become one of the most well-known, and beloved, of the comedies done \"in a documentary style.\" (Christopher Guest is known to hate the term \"mockumentary.\")\n\nIn Waiting for Guffman, released in 1997, Christopher Guest does for community theater what Spinal Tap had done for heavy metal bands. With largely improvised dialogue, Guffman, presents a subtly comedic view of local actors eager to present a small-town theatrical production celebrating their city's 150th anniversary. While they don't appear in the film, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer worked on the musical numbers used in the film.\n\nWaiting for Guffman is set in fictional Blaine, Missouri, but much of the filming took place in Lockhart, Texas. According to the Waiting for Guffman website, which was still online through 2012, the cast had 5 days of rehearsal and 29 days of filming in Lockhart, which has been officially designated as the Barbecue Capitol of Texas.\n\nThe Silos\n\nWaiting for Guffman opens with an overhead establishing shot of grain silos, which immediately gives the viewer a hint of the small-town, even rural, nature of the community to be featured in the film.\n\nThe silos seen are located across the street from K-C Grain, 805 N Pecos St, Lockhart, TX 78644.\n\nI had already visited several of the other locations seen in the movie, but I learned about the silo location from the excellent Slackerwood site, which discussed the film industry in the Austin area. The site no longer produces new content, but they have fortunately kept their archives online, including a visit to Guffman locations.\n\nThe Title Theater\n\nThe Waiting for Guffman title is shown superimposed over a movie theater, as two kids on inline skates speed past the building. The marquee shows Like Water for Chocolate and Time Cop (sic) as the films playing at the time, with a poster for Dolores Claiborne in the \"Coming Soon\" frame.\n\nThe real-world location is the Gaslight Baker Theatre, 216 South Main Street, Lockhart, TX 78644, which I think I figured out as I was walking around the Lockhart downtown area.\n\nCity of Blaine, Missouri\n\nAfter a brief shot of a pedestrian walking on a downtown street, an overhead shot reveals the town square with an ornate government building, which is revealed in the next scene to be the city hall of Blaine, Missouri.\n\nThe \"city hall\" in the movie is actually the Caldwell County Courthouse, 110 S. Main Street, Lockhart, TX 78644. This photogenic town square has also been seen in such movies as A Small Town in Texas, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Where the Heart Is.\n\nBlaine Museum\n\nTwo brief shots show the Blaine Museum before cutting to interior shots of local historian “Phil Burgess” (Don Lake) expounding on the colorful history of Blaine.\n\nExclusive: The Blaine Museum exterior is located at 215 W San Antonio St, Lockhart, TX 78644 and it appears to be a private home or apartment building.\n\nI determined this location while researching a different movie, and I haven't seen this location listed anywhere else on the Internet.\n\nCorky's Apartment\n\nIf Waiting for Guffman has an iconic location, it would have to be the steps to the apartment where the movie’s main character lives. Christopher Guest’s “Corky St. Clair” is the dramatic heart of the story and several scenes take place near his apartment.\n\nThe address of Corky's apartment is 101 S Main St, Lockhart, TX 78644, but the iconic stairs are on the side of the building, along West San Antonio Street.\n\nInterior scenes seem to have also been filmed here. In the scene of Corky dancing in his apartment, you can see the courthouse through his windows.\n\nMagic Carpet Travel Agency\n\nAt the Magic Carpet Travel Agency, we’re introduced to “Ron & Sheila Albertson” (the wonderful Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), small-business owners and local theater stalwarts, who are eager to participate in the next Corky St. Clair production.\n\nExclusive: The travel agency exterior is at 110 E Market St, Lockhart, TX 78644, currently the real estate office of Harrison Partners Realty LLP.\n\nI determined this location easily, by looking around the Lockhart town square, but I haven't seen it listed anywhere else on the Internet.\n\nUFO Landing Site\n\nIn addition to stools, Blaine residents celebrate a UFO landing in the town in 1946. A local “UFO Expert” (David Cross) explains some of the mysteries of the landing site in a local field.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven’t figured out where this scene was filmed. It has a Texas feel, but Cross doesn’t have any interaction with anyone else in the final cut of the movie, so it’s possible that this scene was filmed in California. If you know, please contact me.\n\nHigh School\n\nA brief establishing shot shows a high school where auditions are to take place for the Blaine sesquicentennial show.\n\nThe school building seen on-screen is the John Burroughs Middle School, 600 S. Mc Cadden Place, Los Angeles, CA 90005.\n\nReference: I found this location via the IMDb message board thread, \"Film location questions.\"\n\nUFO Abductee\n\nA \"UFO Abductee\" (Paul Dooley) stands in front of a local shop as he discusses his encounter with the aliens who landed in Blaine.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven’t figured out where this scene was filmed.\n\nI was contacted by Javier Chacin, who referred me to the I Was There Too podcast, which featured a terrific episode with Paul Dooley. In the podcast, Dooley says that he went to Texas for one day to film his scene, so I’m guessing that it was also filmed in Lockhart. If you know, please contact me.\n\nHigh School Gymnasium (Interior)\n\nMany of the rehearsals for the big “Red, White and Blaine” show are conducted in the local gymnasium where the show is ultimately held.\n\nThe scenes were filmed inside the Doris Miller Auditorium, 2300 Rosewood Ave, Austin, TX 78702.\n\nReference: The film's credits thank the \"Doris Miller Recreational Center.\" [Doris Miller was a sailor who was born in Waco, and earned the Navy Cross for his heroism at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Sadly, Miller died at sea on November 24, 1943.]\n\nExtras\n\nI was lucky to see Parker Posey at a special screening of Waiting for Guffman, and she's still justifiably proud of her work on the film. She even discussed the tremendous Libby Mae audition scene that was deleted from the finished film, and I was delighted to learn that she loves the scene as much as I do."
