        "text": "Turn it up to 11, the sequel to the sequel to the 1984 cult classic “This Is Spinal Tap,” recently began production in New Orleans, Louisiana. Rob Reiner is behind the director’s chair again, and Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer are all reprising their iconic roles as the legendary heavy metal band Spinal Tap. Reiner will also reprise his role as the director-within-the-movie Martin “Marty” DiBergi.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment, the producers of the picture, also announced several key cameos appearing in the film by legendary musicians like Elton John, Paul McCartney, Questlove, Garth Brooks, and Trisha Yearwood.\n\nREAD MORE: Spinal Tap II’: Rob Reiner, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer All Returning For Another Mock-Rock Sequel\n\n“Spinal Tap 2,” or whatever it ends up being called, was announced in May 2022, but there had been little updates on the film until recently.\n\nGuest, McKean, Reiner, and Shearer conceived the sequel, which centers on the band after a 15-year hiatus. The group, England’s loudest and most punctual band, reunites for one final concert. Presumably, other cameos are being kept under wraps, but clearly, Castle Rock wants to signal that some major names have given their blessing to be involved.\n\nThe film is being produced by Reiner, Michele Reiner, and Matthew George and financed under the Castle Rock Entertainment banner. Christopher H. Warner and Derrick Rossi serve as executive producers.\n\nReiner said in a statement, “I recently spoke to Marty DiBergi, who said that he was more than happy to take a sabbatical from his position as a visiting Professor’s Assistant at the Ed Wood School of Cinematic Arts to once again document Spinal Tap to ensure their place in the pantheon of Rock and Roll.”\n\n“This Is Spinal Tap” was released to critical acclaim in 1984 and became a cult classic. In 2002, the Library of Congress deemed it “culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant” and was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.\n\nThe band has really milked the joke over the years. The actors have portrayed the band members at several concerts, releasing several actual albums under the guise of Spinal Tap, going on a full-blown U.S. tour in 2009, and performing in a “One Night Only World Tour” that same summer at Wembley Arena in London, only three days after playing the Glastonbury Festival.\n\nNo release date for the film has been given, but presumably, the film will be ready sometime in 2025."
