        "text": "By Jef Feeley and Anthony Palazzo, Bloomberg News\n\nComedian Harry Shearer has a message for the company that owns the rights to “This is Spinal Tap:” “Gimme some money. Gimme some money.”\n\nShearer, a U.S. comedian, accused Vivendi SA of improperly withholding millions in profits from the spoof movie from its creators and cast members.\n\nThe 72-year-old Shearer, whose career has included providing voices for more than 20 characters on the hit TV show “The Simpsons,” contends Vivendi executives should pay $125 million in damages tied to profits generated by the Spinal Tap movie, a 1984 mockumentary about a fictitious heavy metal band.\n\nVivendi “failed to account honestly for the income actually received from” the movie, which has become a cult classic, Shearer said in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Los Angeles.\n\nA Vivendi spokesman in Paris declined to comment on the suit Tuesday. Vivendi is the parent company of Universal Music and Studio Canal, a French company listed as the legal owner of all rights to the film.\n\n“This Is Spinal Tap” grossed $4.5 million in U.S. theaters, according to Box Office Mojo. The film, starring Rob Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest, was directed by Reiner in so-called mockumentary style, following the fictional band through its concert tour.\n\nShearer, the movie’s co-author, portrayed band bassist Derek Smalls, who bears satirical resemblance to Lemmy Kilmister, the mutton-chopped guitarist for the real metal band Motorhead who died last year.\n\n‘Sex Farm’\n\nDespite its meager take at the box office, the film became a cult hit, generating three decades of residual fees from DVDs, television reruns and a 2000 re-release that is now at issue in the Shearer’s lawsuit.\n\nShearer contends Vivendi has shortchanged the movie’s writers, cast and crew on profits generated from the film itself, along with merchandising and other movie spin offs.\n\nVivendi, for example, reported soundtrack sales from 1989 to 2006 — including the song “Gimme Some Money” produced a total income of $98, Shearer claims. The company also listed the movie creators’ share of worldwide merchandising income from 1984 to 2006 as $81, according to the court filing.\n\nVivendi and its agents “have engaged in anti-competitive business practices by manipulating accounting between Vivendi film and music subsidiaries and have engaged in fraud to deprive the Spinal Tap creators of a fair return for their work,” Shearer’s company, Century of Progress Productions, said in the complaint. “‘This is Spinal Tap’ and its music, including such songs as ‘Sex Farm’ and ‘Stonehenge,’ have remained popular for more than 30 years, and have earned considerable sums” for Vivendi.\n\nThe case is Century of Progress Productions v. Vivendi SA, CA 16-7733, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Los Angeles).\n\nWith assistance from Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier"
