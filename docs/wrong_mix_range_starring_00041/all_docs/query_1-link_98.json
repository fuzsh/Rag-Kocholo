        "text": "My dad has been obsessed with this since it came out. He seriously thinks it’s the funniest thing mankind has put on planet Earth so I figured it was time to watch it. I thought it was really funny but my dad thinks it’s funnier. This is what my future children will say about me but with Borat\n\nOutrageously funny, so much so that my laughter was swapped with a consistent and dopey grin on my face. The startling realism and authenticity of the satire elevates the entire experience into a supremely hilarious achievement. Rob Reiner nailed This is Spinal Tap, and I have a feeling that a rewatch will raise my thoughts on it.\n\n\"May I start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here? We are such fans of your music and all of your records. I'm not speaking of yours personally, but the whole genre of the rock and roll.\"\n\nThe whole thing is so damn funny but the scene when they’re playing and come out of those pods and the scenes with the Stonehenge stuff really take this shit to the next level\n\nWhen I was about 11 years old I had a handful of Spinal Tap songs on my iPod classic, but the embarrassing thing about the whole situation is that I had no Earthly idea that they were spoofs. I just thought they were cool songs, which should really tell you something about the songwriting acumen of Brian Johnson-era AC/DC, which was what I was extremely into at the time. They made sense beside one another when shuffling. Spinal Tap could phase into the worst of 80s Dad Rock without any modification for exaggeration, and that's why this is a great comedy."
