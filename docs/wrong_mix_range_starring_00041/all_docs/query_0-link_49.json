        "text": "Richard Nixon, author of forced love letters and our nation’s 37th president, is the unlikely inspiration for a new 30-minute comedy show, to be aired on British TV next week. Conceived by and starring Harry Shearer, the American actor responsible for 21 voices on The Simpsons including Ned Flanders, Nixon’s the One features dialogue and intonations lifted directly from the tapes that were released in 2008 by the Nixon Presidential Library.\n\nShearer, who says that he is obsessed with the scandal-plagued former leader, hopes that the one-off program will eventually make it overseas, although he adds that the non-political show lacks the “surface controversy” and pace that U.S. audiences crave. At a broadcasting lunch in London today, Shearer deadpanned that Nixon’s the One looks like “high quality surveillance video,” which is, coincidentally, more than E! can say about any of its series. President Nixon has been portrayed many times in both film and television, most notably by Anthony Hopkins, Rich Little, and Frank Langella.\n\nCelebrity\n\nMeghan Markle Joins Prince Harry at the ESPY Awards\n\nFrom fist bumps with a cameraman to jokes about Challengers, these were the most thrilling moments with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at the ESPYs.\n\nHollywood\n\nMeet the Death-Defying Couple Who Fell in Love While Climbing Skyscrapers\n\nAngela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus’s risky romance is the subject of Netflix documentary Skywalkers: A Love Story, previewed exclusively below.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.

The restructuring “may look callous,” she says. “But it’s so that we get it right, so I don’t have to do it over again.”\n\nStyle\n\nAt Le Sirenuse, Vacationing Is a Work of Art\n\nAll great hotels have top-notch service and ritzy clientele. But how many have a Nicolas Party at the bottom of the pool?\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Bear Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nThe show’s unprecedented use of “to be continued” begs several questions, one of them being: Are we getting new episodes of The Bear sooner than expected?\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Biden Campaign Needs to Stop Dismissing Critics as “Bed Wetters”\n\nThe president is right that his opponent represents a grave threat to American democracy.
