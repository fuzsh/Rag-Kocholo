ON SET CINEMA is heading to Camp Blood on July 1-3 & 3-5, 2022 for our very special ‚ÄúFRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI‚Äù event! Go camping and watch ‚ÄúJASON LIVES‚Äù at Hard Labor Creek State Park (aka Camp Crystal Lake ‚Ä¶aka Camp Forest Green) in Rutledge, Georgia where the majority of the movie was actually filmed!

Actor Thom Mathews (aka Tommy) will be a special guest at this event! This will be his first time returning to Camp Blood since filming took place over 36 years ago. He‚Äôll be signing autographs, taking photos with fans on the pier, doing a Q&A before the movie screening and a filming locations tour of Camp Forest Green.

You‚Äôll be able to see where Sheriff Mike Garris gets bent completely in half by Jason, walk on the pier where Officer Thornton gets a dart to the forehead, hang out in the cabin where Sissy gets snatched out of the window and her head twisted off and swim in the actual lake where Tommy fights Jason during the movies‚Äô climatic ending!

Fans will enjoy an entire weekend of summer camp ‚Äì shared cabin camping with bunk beds, games (egg toss, corn hole, tug-of-war, board games, video games & more), campfires with friends, roasting marshmallows and making s‚Äômores, watching VHS horror movies on tube TVs, swimming and canoeing in Crystal Lake and of course an outdoor screening of ‚ÄúJASON LIVES‚Äù by the lake!
