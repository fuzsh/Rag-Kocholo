        "text": "Academy <strong>of</strong> Motion Picture Arts and Sciences <strong>Reminder</strong> <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Eligible</strong> <strong>Releases</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>Distinguished</strong> Achievements during 2007 <strong>Reminder</strong> <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> Productions <strong>Eligible</strong> <strong>for</strong> Awards http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/reminder/ All films that have qualified <strong>for</strong> consideration <strong>for</strong> 2007 Academy Awards in the non-specialized categories are listed alphabetically by title. Voters making selections in their own branch categories list only film titles on their ballots, not the individuals responsible <strong>for</strong> the various achievements. For that reason, as well as <strong>for</strong> reasons <strong>of</strong> printing time and convenience <strong>of</strong> using this pamphlet, full credit rosters are not provided <strong>for</strong> the listed films. An exception to the above exists in the four Acting categories, where simply listing titles would not provide enough voting in<strong>for</strong>mation. Actors Branch members filling out their Nominations ballots must indicate both titles and the particular per<strong>for</strong>mers they are voting <strong>for</strong>. For that reason, the <strong>Reminder</strong> <strong>List</strong> provides a listing <strong>of</strong> up to fifty cast members <strong>for</strong> each film. Pictures eligible in the Animated Feature Film, Documentary Feature and Foreign Language Film categories are also eligible in the Best Picture category, provided they meet the qualifications <strong>for</strong> the category. Foreign Language films are eligible <strong>for</strong> awards in other categories provided they meet the requirements <strong>of</strong> Awards Rules Two and Three.
