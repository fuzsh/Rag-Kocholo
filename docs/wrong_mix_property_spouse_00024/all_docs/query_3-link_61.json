        "text": "Karina Rykman has played such iconic venues as the Rongovian Embassy and the Haunt, even Red Rocks and Radio City Music Hall, playing bass as part of acts like Marco Benevento’s band or America’s Got Talent contestant Aaralyn & Izzy, but the multi-instrumentalist has recently been fronting her own band. The trio kicks off a northeast tour this Wednesday at the Upstairs in Downtown Ithaca.\n\nHaving played everything from small rooms to massive amphitheaters, Rykman says “So much of what we do is informed by the energy of the crowd. You can play a 200-cap room with screaming, fervent, incredible fans and that show will be 10,000 times better than an amphitheater where you’re distant from people and they’re less interested. It totally depends on the vibe, the second you set out on the stage, and of course every room is different. The frequencies in the room can really make or break an evening. When it’s less than desirable you’ve just gotta rise above and give it your all, even if it sounds crazy and things are not going the way you plan, you’ve just gotta tough it out and go for it, and try to stay as consistent and constant as possible.”\n\nRykman has been touring as Marco Benevento’s bassist since 2016, playing headline shows and festivals, and opening for acts like Vulfpeck, Dispatch, and Guster. That Radio City gig was backing two heavy metal rocker kids in front of AGT judges Howard Stern and Nick Cannon.\n\nAs a kid herself, Rykman says after learning to play piano at around ten or eleven, she was handed a guitar during recess in eighth grade and learned to play Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes, and “feel completely in love with the instrument.” She got her first electric guitar as a birthday present from her uncle, and two weeks later was in a punk band called False Arrest.\n\nGetting the call to play bass for Benevento when she was 22 “was basically, I don’t want to call it a big break, because that sounds silly, but that was a turning point in both my life and my career. It was this moment where I realized that that’s what I needed to focus on, and kind of drop the six strings and stick with four and just really buckle down as a bass player, and I’m so glad I did. I feel much more at home on that instrument.”\n\nShe still does a lot of her writing on the guitar or even sitting at a piano, but promises “no piano recitals.” At the risk of upsetting a generation of parents, Rykman believes “everybody should start at drums, or at least have a drum lesson or beat around on a drum kit first, because it informs absolutely everything.”\n\n“I feel like it makes me that much of a stronger bass player, because there’s some kind of interconnectedness that happens there,” she adds of the drumming experience. “Your neural pathways really open up when it comes to rhythmic stuff.”\n\n“It’s great to be able to speak drummer,” as well, when communicating with drummer Chris Corsico. “It makes it easier to communicate to him, especially in the writing process or trying to figure out how things sort of convey themselves live.”\n\n“My guitar player, Adam November, is so much more than a virtuosic guitar player, which of course he is, but he’s sort of a master of effects and looping. He literally can make his guitar sound like a modular synth at times,” Rykman says. “The way he manipulates his sound, it’s really something that blows me away every time I step on stage with the guy. Whatever comes out of his mad scientist rig to my right is always something to behold. I’m looking forward to stretching out on stage with him and bringing it all to life.”\n\nAs a guitarist herself, she’s fresh off a substitute gig filling in for Seth Jabour in the 8G Band, playing her Gibson Explorer on Late Night with Seth Meyers, where guest Tracy Jordan made an offer to buy the guitar.\n\nAfter playing Red Rocks, the Rongo, and Radio City, what’s left on Rykman’s bucket list? “The Beacon Theatre,” she says. “Of course the Gorge is a complete dream. I would say Madison Square Garden, but I was lucky enough to be invited up to check out Mike Gordon’s bass rig during a Phish run at Madison Square Garden, and ended up jamming with the whole band on stage at the Garden. Of course I just played a few notes of music up there for five minutes, but if I could ever play a set of music at the Garden, I think I’ll pass out from sheer joy.”\n\n“Some places just have that magic, and some crowds just have that magic, and you step out on stage and the roar is so thunderous that you know it’s gonna be a good show.”\n\nDoors open at 8pm Wednesday, November 30th at the Upstairs, formerly Lot 10, on South Cayuga Street. “The spirit of 5.8.77 will be alive and well,” Rykman says to Deadheads and other fans of jam bands."
