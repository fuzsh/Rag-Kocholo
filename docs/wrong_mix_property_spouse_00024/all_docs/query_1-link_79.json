His responsibilities include connecting with creators who are looking to bring exceptional projects to life on our platform, as well as providing guidance and support to ensure their campaigns thrive.\n\nWith a diverse background that includes roles at BOOM! Studios (14 Kickstarter campaigns and counting) and experience in direct market sales and manga reviews, Sam has a deep understanding of the comics landscape. Most recently, he served as the Special Projects Manager at BOOM!

The film is produced by XYZ Films, Mike Richardson and Keith Goldberg for Dark Horse Entertainment, Charlie Day and Peter Warren, and is executive produced by Paul Schwake and Kasey Adler for Dark Horse. The film is financed by XYZ Films, who will also be handling worldwide sales at the upcoming Marché du Film at Cannes. The film is looking to shoot later this year.\n\n“We are thrilled to find in Allison not just an incredible actress to tackle the role of Margot, but a partner who is as passionate as we are about this brave discussion of mental health and suicidality, a subject which has touched all of our lives so deeply,” said director Peter Warren.\n\nIn the film Jimmy (Charlie Day) wakes up in a bathtub after having tried to kill himself. Or, at least, that's what it looks like to his friends and family. Jimmy is pretty sure he didn't do it...Maybe. Together with Margot (Williams), the 911 operator who took his call, Jimmy sets out on a mission to solve a vitally important whodunit: did someone try to kill him, or are they chasing the specter of depression? KILL ME is a gripping, hilarious, and deeply moving murder mystery.\n\nWilliams was the star and executive producer of Universal’s hit tech-horror thriller M3GAN, which made its theatrical debut in January 2023, grossing over $180 million worldwide. Next up, she will reprise her role in - and produce - the sequel, M3GAN 2.0. In October 2023, Williams starred alongside Matt Bomer and Jonathan Bailey in Showtime’s limited series, FELLOW TRAVELERS. The show, which garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination and Critics Choice Award nomination, is based upon a novel of the same name by Thomas Mallon. Previously, Williams starred in Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning, Universal blockbuster film, GET OUT, which grossed over $255 million worldwide and garnered her a Screen Actors Guild ensemble nomination for her performance. Williams also starred as ‘Marnie’ on six seasons on HBO’s Emmy and Golden Globe-winning TV series GIRLS, which earned her a Critics' Choice Television Award nomination for “Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.”\n\nCurrent titles from the XYZ Films studio include Sundance title SKYWALKERS: A LOVE STORY, which sold to Netflix and BLACKBERRY starring Gotham and Independent Spirit-award nominee Glenn Howerton, which was released by IFC Films, Atom Egoyan’s TIFF selection SEVEN VEILS starring Amanda Seyfried, ASH starring Eiza González and Aaron Paul and directed by Flying Lotus, recent TIFF acquisition BACKSPOT starring Devery Jacobs and Evan Rachel Wood, the Netflix Original HAVOC, directed by Gareth Evans and starring Tom Hardy and Forrest Whitaker and DANIELA FOREVER directed by Nacho Vigalondo and starring Henry Golding and Beatrice Grannó. Other recent releases include the Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead film SOMETHING IN THE DIRT which premiered at Sundance 2022. The company’s classic titles include THE RAID franchise, 2017 Sundance winner I DON'T FEEL AT HOME IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE, Panos Cosmatos' psychedelic revenge thriller MANDY, and Karyn Kusama’s THE INVITATION.\n\nWilliams is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment and Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.\""
