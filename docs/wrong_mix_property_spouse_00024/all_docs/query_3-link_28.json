        "text": "Karina Arnold is a junior at the University of Oklahoma who’s passionate about healthy cooking. She provides creative, healthy recipes and tips on clean eating.\n\nMy house is my home-base, my touchstone, sanctuary. Since it was only a fence-hop away, my home was also a home-base for everyone in my class. I, like my mom, love having people over. My house was the spot for pool parties, pre-games, post-games and lunch time hang-outs. My mom, the ever-generous host, provided food to feed the thousands, although it did help that there was a pizza place five minutes away.\n\nEntertaining is an art. Knowing what to cook, how much to cook and when to serve demands copious planning. Furthermore, there is a delicate balance between spending time in the kitchen making an amazing meal versus spending time with guests. The host must not remove themselves from the party to serve, because that would be a waiter; however, the host must also not neglect the needs of his or her guests. Try these Unfussy Meals for the perfect ratio of time in the kitchen with time spent with guests.\n\nThe morning after a concert, big game, or night out, sleepover patrons want to eat something satiable and satisfying. Breakfast is my favorite meal; thus, this Breakfast Hash is one of my favorite plates to throw together for friends and family. The potatoes fill guests with starchy, satiating carbs while the eggs and beans bring on the protein. In this hash, I use pepper and onions, both of which replenish vitamins. Garnishing with fresh onion, radishes and cilantro provides anti-oxidants and fresh flavor. The best part? You don’t have to follow the recipe. Add, change or omit any ingredients you don’t have or like. Just have a potato base, vegetables, and eggs, beans and cheese to hold the hash together. You can make this vegan by substituting eggs for flax eggs and the cheese for vegan cheese. For meat lovers, you can add a “shepherd’s pie twist” by adding ground beef.\n\nAlthough this is a “Breakfast Hash,” you can enjoy breakfast foods all day. This shareable, delicious dish is perfect to bring to a Sunday Brunch, game-day viewing party, or hangout with friends.\n\nPlaying host does not have to be a hassle. From hosting my class in high school to intimate dinner parties, I learned more than good food, guests want a good time. Providing simple, wholesome dishes is easy to cook, serve and eat, but most importantly, enjoy together. What are your favorite dinner-party meals to serve? Comment below!"
