One immediate takeaway from #TalentConnect2019 is I invite everyone to participate in the #plusonepledge. “If we reach outside of our networks, we can level the playing field and help close the network gap.” Today, I connected with my #Lyft driver Klejdi who moved to US from Albania 1 year ago trying to get a job in sales without a network and unfamiliar with #LinkedIN. I told him about the #BetterTogether vision, exchanged emails to link him to a #CapitalOne retail bank recruiter and gave him 1 year LI Premium subscription thanks to #JeffWeiner. Look forward to be his first connection! We can help make an impact, one person at a time. What is your story? #LifeAtCapitalOne"
