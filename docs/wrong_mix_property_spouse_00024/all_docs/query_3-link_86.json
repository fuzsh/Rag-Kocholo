        "text": "\"Miles is full of amazing, thoughtful and talented individuals who want to make this a better place. Being able to meet them and connect with them is one of the greatest pleasures of life.\"\n\nKarin is a Senior Vice President at Miles and has been with the company for almost 17 years. She started as an Account Director, handling marketing within the western United States and has moved all the way up into a global role focused in the areas of Tourism and Hospitality for the last 6 years. Off hours, she’s planning her family’s next adventure traveling the world or at home cooking up some homemade pizza.\n\nFavorite Travel Memory\n\nEvery beach trip with my girls, building sandcastles, finding shell treasures, soaking in the sun and playing in the ocean waves. With both kids on each side holding tight while the waves come towards us, we jump together. Hearing them giggling is absolutely the best."
