        "text": "Director: Dan O’Bannon\n\nStarring: Don Calfa, Clu Gulager, James Karen, Thom Mathews, Beverly Randolph\n\nRuntime: 91 minutes\n\nI’m surprised at how much comedy has creeped into the movies I’m discussing. I realized that another of my favorites is a horror-comedy: Return of the Living Dead, a re-imagining of Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. It actually refers to Romero’s movie as based on real incidents, and says that things happened differently, but that the basic idea of the dead returning to life was in fact real. This film not only changes the story behind the appearance of zombies, making it the result of a government experiment gone awry, but also pictures zombies as fast-moving, unkillable killing machines (destroying the brain won’t work).\n\nSPOILERS FOLLOW\n\nIt starts with three men working at a medical supply warehouse. Frank (James Karen) is training new employee Freddy (Thom Mathews), while their boss, Burt (Clu Gulager) leaves early to start the 4th of July weekend. Frank makes the mistake of showing Freddy some U.S. military canisters that mistakenly got shipped there—canisters that contain the chemicals that originally brought corpses back to life, as well as one of those corpses. Of course, the canisters rupture, spilling the chemicals all over the warehouse, and reviving the corpse.\n\nChaos ensues as they call back Burt to try to cover up what happened, and destroy the zombies (besides the one from the canister, a body stored in the warehouse for shipping to a medical school has also revived, along with split dogs, and a wall of preserved butterflies). They go to Burt’s friend, Ernie (Don Calfa), who works at a mortuary and has a crematorium. Burning the bodies would seem a sure-fire way to get rid of all the evidence—except that the ashes come down on a graveyard, and aided by some on-cue rain, revive all of the graveyard’s inhabitants.\n\nWhile this plays on a lot of zombie movie tropes—a group of people trapped inside a building, with fruitless attempts to escape, and living people who are slowly turning into the living dead (Frank and Freddy breathed in the chemical), there’s also much departure. As already mentioned, the fast-moving zombies are different than the usual lumbering kind, and these zombies won’t die: even if you cut them into pieces, the pieces will still come after you. The comedy also offsets the usual solemn bleakness of these kinds of films. The cast is diverse—three older men and an eclectic group of 80s stereotypes looking to join their friend, Freddy. No single character is of central importance—it’s more of an ensemble piece—and everyone adds their own layer of charm and fun. The ending, while fairly nihilistic, ends things with a detached, morbidly tongue-in-cheek final image of a zombie emerging as one of the songs from the movie’s deathrock/punk soundtrack blares into life. The soundtrack is one of the most fun things about the movie, as it changes the whole feel of seeing a horde of zombies descending on their victims.\n\nSome of the effects are pretty gruesome, but there’s so much off-beat humor that nothing is really unsettling. The greatest scenes are where we see the zombies attacking in hordes, overpowering anyone who tries to help the isolated characters (ambulances, police), and we see them spreading out to attack surrounding areas, suggesting they could quickly spread through the world if not unchecked. There were a number of sequels, but none of them manage to quite capture the quirky spark of this horror-comedy classic.\n\nDirector: Stuart Gordon\n\nStarring: Bruce Abbott, Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, David Gale\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes/86 minutes (unrated cut)\n\nAlthough H. P. Lovecraft’s stories don’t adapt well to film, the best attempts at adaptation use the materially very liberally. (Although a straightforward adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness would be pretty awesome, I think, if done well. Director Guillermo del Toro has been trying to make a film version for years, and apparently James Cameron was interested in being producer at some point, but the project unfortunately seems to be stuck in Hollywood limbo.) The basic premise of Lovecraft’s novella Herbert West—Reanimator, originally serialized in 1922, is retained: a brilliant but mad scientist named Herbert West reanimates several corpses that run amok. But there are major differences, and this is one of the few cases, especially for Lovecraft, in which the film version is better than the original.\n\nFor one thing, it eliminates the racism that taints the original story, in which part of the horror is supposed to be evoked by an ungainly African American zombie. It also puts a more humorous spin on the story. Lovecraft himself thought poorly of the work because of the demands serialization placed on him (ending with a cliffhanger, starting with a recap of the last episode). However, it is notable as being one of the first depictions of zombies as animalistic killing machines, reanimated by science rather than magic.\n\nOne of the strengths of this film is Jeffrey Combs, who plays West, a character whose monomaniacal and ruthless pursuits leave us few reasons to sympathize with, yet Combs somehow makes the character endearing, perhaps in his nerdy brashness, and striking the right balance between pathos and camp. (Combs would go on to play similar roles: West in two sequels, another scientist in a Lovecraft adaptation, Brian Yunza-directed From Beyond; he would play Lovecraft himself in the horror anthology Necronomicon; and had several Star Trek roles.) The other actors do a tolerable job; his friend Dan (Bruce Abbott), who helps with West’s experiments, is the unnamed narrator from the Lovecraft story. At least he gets to have a girlfriend in the film, Megan (Barbara Crampton), although she is put through hell in the movie.\n\nSPOILERS FOLLOW\n\nBut the only other presence rivaling Combs is David Gale, playing a professor and West’s enemy. He is perhaps even more ruthless, certainly more malign, than West, and when he becomes a reanimated headless corpse, things only get worse. (In the sequel, his role gets crazier, batty even.) He recruits a zombie army to lead against West, similar to the character in Lovecraft’s story, but instead of an army major bent on revenge (in the story), he is in the film a megalomaniac who perhaps helps us to root for the obsessive West.\n\nProducer Brian Yunza produced this and directed the sequels, and has served as director, producer, and writer for a number of campy low-budget horror and sci-fi films. Although fairly low-budget effects, and done with a campy feel, they are nonetheless entertaining. John Naulin, who did the makeup effects, studied actual photographs of cadavers, and said they used the ridiculous amount of 24 gallons of fake blood. The sequels, Bride of Re-Animator and Beyond Re-Animator only amp up the absurdist gore-inflected horror comedy.\n\nDay 2: Night of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nDirector: George Romero\n\nStarring: Marilyn Eastman, Karl Hardman, Duane Jones, Judith O’Dea\n\nRuntime: 96 minutes\n\nWhile Psycho located horror in the familiar, in someone just like us, Night of the Living Dead goes one step further: the horror is us. This film still has the power to disturb not necessarily because of its violence and gore, but because the enemy is collective humanity. Zombies are dead humans reanimated. But the living protagonists are just as dangerous. Of the 7 deaths we see in the film, only 3 are caused by zombies; the other 4 are the result of murder or bungling.\n\nNight is remarkable in many ways. One of the first independent films to receive a wide audience, it was influential in showing what an impact a movie could make with a limited budget. Stock music from a TV studio was used, dialogue was ad-libbed by actors, and regional aspects dominate (many Pittsburghers recognize “Chilly Billy Cardilly,” a local TV horror show host, as one of the reporters, as well as names of the “rescue stations,” etc.). Also, much subtext, intentional and unintentional, gets packed into the fairly simplistic story of seven people holding up in a rural Pennsylvania farmhouse. Tensions of race, gender, and social apathy are frequently cited undercurrents, although Romero and cast members have claimed that they were not thinking of these at the time.\n\nSPOILERS FOLLOWThe breaking of taboos makes Night’s popularity even more perplexing. Cannibalism is explicitly depicted, since the zombies eat the flesh of the living. A young girl eats her father and commits matricide by stabbing her mother to death with a trowel. Finally, the ending is so bleak that to this day, it leaves viewers feeling empty and disturbed.\n\nThe apocalyptic nature of the crisis had been somewhat prefigured by The Birds, but the threat was more localized to a single town. In Night, reports indicate that the plague has spread everywhere. And as I suggested, the crisis reveals that the horror in ourselves is brought out. The ending suggests that militia-style posses are cleaning things up, but when they kill off the only character to have survived the night’s zombie assault, mistaking him for one of the living dead, we realize that mob rule has taken over, and the fate of the world remains as uncertain as ever. Many have convincingly argued that this reflects the political tensions and violence erupting in American society at this time.\n\nThere are many more things I could go into, but suffice it to say that I believe the rawness of this film retains its power 45 years later. Like Psycho, it has become extremely influential, not only in spawning the zombie Is it such a stretch to say this is a critique of America’s out-of-control “consumer culture”? Or were the filmmakers just having fun grossing people out?subgenre, but also conventions such as the danger of human paranoia in the midst of attack, and the nihilistic ending (see John Carpenter’s The Thing and Frank Darabont’s The Mistfor both). It is one of the most important films in establishing modern horror."
