Lots of space to dine in but I always have had take away....\n\nAmazing food and service. Got a chicago deep dish pizza and it was the best pizza we have ever had. Lots of flavor and homemade sauce. The owner was super friendly and welcoming. The desserts were incredible as well...\n\nAbsolutely delicious!!!! I ordered a large sausage and spinach double dough pizza and it was so freaking good! Their pizza is one of my favorites. I'm always satisfied and it comes pretty fast.\n\nTotorice's has been our main pizza place for a few years. They have seriously the best deep dish. Get the caramelized crust for sure. We also just tried the Picasso for the first time and I gotta say, it's my new favorite pizza ever....\n\nI work close by and wanted something quick to eat. Pizza was ready super quick. The young ladies here were super nice! That I will be coming back again with my family. I didn't think it was be this nice and the place is SUPER clean."
