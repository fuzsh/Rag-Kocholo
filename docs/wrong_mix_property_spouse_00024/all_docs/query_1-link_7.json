        "text": "Biography: \"Thom Mathews went to high school in Los Angeles, CA, and is a close friend of George Clooney. They stayed together in L.A. during the 80's when they were both struggling actors. His first major role was the character 'Freddy' in The Return of the Living Dead, which he starred in along side Miguel A. Nuï¿½ez Jr. and Mark Venturini.\n\nHe has earned a black belt in martial arts, and has demonstrated his talents in several movies like, Bloodmatch and Kickboxer 4. Thom Mathews currently lives in Los Angeles, CA, and is co-owner of the construction company, Hammer & Trowel. They were the company who remodeled the Osbournes house, as shown on the MTV Cribs episode.\" - George Clooney and the Boys Site\n\nQuote: \"Growing up, I just didn't know what I wanted to do. One day, a girlfriend suggested that I might try being an actor. Her remark was right out of the blue, but it triggered something in my head, and I took her advice.\n\nRight before Friday came along, I was going out to readings, not getting the parts. I had already done this movie, Return of the Living Dead, and here I was, thinking that once it came out, that things would begin happening in a big way for me. But even after it did, and I got good notices, I wasn't getting any offers. So, I started putzing around and getting real depressed. And that film did help. But it was just that I was expecting a flood of offers and I wasn't getting any work. It was really frustrating.\n\nI'll tell you why I did Jason Lives. I was in no position to turn down the lead in a film being distributed by Paramount Pictures that would be seen by a whole lot of people. No matter what some think of the Friday movies, they can establish that an actor can carry a picture.\" - pg. 149, Crystal Lake Memories\n\nBuy Crystal Lake Memories by Peter Bracke for more amazing interviews!\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Vampire Hunters Club (2001)\n\nWaiting for Woody (1998)\n\nCrazy Six (1998)\n\nThe Peacemaker (1997)\n\nMean Guns (1997)\n\nBlast (1996)\n\nHeatseeker (1995)\n\nKickboxer 4: The Aggressor (1994)\n\nNemesis (1993)\n\nBloodmatch (1991)\n\nBorn to Ride (1991)\n\nMidnight Cabaret (1990)\n\nAlien from L.A.
