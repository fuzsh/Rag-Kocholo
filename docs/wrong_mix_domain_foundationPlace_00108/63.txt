Seattle-based casual gaming website Big Fish Games has acquired French developer FunPause, the studio behind casual titles such as Fairies, Atlantis and Garden Golf.

Big Fish was founded three years ago by former RealNetworks executive Paul Thelen, who started the company with just USD 10,000 in savings. Last month Big Fish secured investments totalling USD 5 million following a successful round of financing.

Although the financial details of the FunPause deal were not disclosed, the investment funds were doubtless used to acquire the Montpelier-based studio - and with it a portfolio of 20 downloadable games and 55 online games. FunPause's headquarters will close as a result of the deal, and staff will join Big Fish's Montpelier office.

"We are excited to be a part of the fastest growing casual game site in the world," said FunPause CEO Emmanuel Marty.

"We are being given the liberty to maintain our creative freedom to produce award winning games, while benefiting from the years of experience and success that Big Fish Games brings to this market."

Big Fish was the second fastest-growing online gaming site in the US last year, according to research firm ComScore Media Metrix. The company distributed 100 million casual games to 25 million gamers, and released 365 titles in total.
