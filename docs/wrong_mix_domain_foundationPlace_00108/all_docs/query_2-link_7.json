        "text": "Family Friendly Hikes in Basel or under 1h away\n\nWe love that in 30 minutes from the city center one can find lovely spots for an enjoyable hike with children. If you are willing to go close to 2 hours from Basel the number of amazing hikes is endless. Here is a review of the ones we've done so far.\n\nMurren: Children's Adventure Trail\n\nLocation: Murren\n\nAddress: Schilthornbahn AG, 3825 Mürren, Switzerland​\n\nCar: ~2 hours from Basel SBB + 25 min train\n\nTrain: ~3.5 hours from Basel SBB\n\nTrail: ~2km one way, ~1hr + playtime\n\nDescription: One of the most beautiful kid friendly hikes we have visited.\n\nMore info: Murren Flower Park\n\nSonnentau Circuit Trail\n\nLocation: Sorrenburg\n\nAddress: Bergbahnen Sörenberg AG\n\nHinterschöniseistrasse 4\n\n6174 Sörenberg\n\nCar: ~1 hour 45 min from Basel SBB\n\nTrain: ~2.5 hours from Basel SBB\n\nTrail: 1.5 km loop & suitable for pushchairs\n\nDescription: Take the cable car up to the top and you will find an amazing restaurant and playground. Next to this is a lovely spot to explore the moor with lounge chairs suspended in the forest trees and another play area. There is the start of the Sonnentau circuit trail that has games along the way. We recommend taking the mountain scooters back down. Smaller kids can ride tandem with an adult.\n\nMore info: Sörenberg Mooraculum\n\nDer klingende Weg (Sound Trail)\n\nLocation: 9656 Alt St Johann\n\nCar: ~2 hr from Basel SBB\n\nTrain: ~3.5 hours from Basel SBB\n\nTrail: STATIONS NO. 1-7: 1.5 hours, 2.5km Stroller/handicap friendly\n\nSTATIONS NO. 8-13 & 19-26: 3.5 hours, 3.5km\n\nMore info: Open June to the end of October. Note operating times of both mountain railways, as these do not cover the path of the sound path for a few days. Photos of the sound instruments.\n\nEngstligenalp Adelboden\n\nAddress: Bergbahnen Engstligenalp AG,\n\nCar: ~2hr\n\nTrail: ~3hr\n\nDescription: Bouldering and hiking through Adelboden's\n\nMammoth Boulder Course is a lovely summer activity to do with kids. Unlike climbing with ropes & hooks, with bouldering you climb the height of boulders with a thick mat that absorbs and protects when jumping back to the ground. The large pad and shoes can be rented from the hotel at the top of the mountain. The Engstligenalp offers eight different «Boulder Parcours». They are marked differently and offer all levels. Some of the «Parcours» can also be celebrated with the whole family, because they lie on a flat flower meadow, crossed by small streams ... a children's paradise!\n\nMore info: https://www.adelboden.ch/de/s/abenteuer-sommer?t=1185\n\n​\n\nMUGGESTUTZ\n\nAddress: Mägisalp , Hasliberg 6086, Switzerland\n\nCar: 1hr 45 min from Basel\n\nTrail: 5km (2 hrs walking + play time)\n\nDescription: On this fairy tail trail, kids can experiences countless adventures while following the story of Muggenstutz and his friends.\n\nMORE IDEAS...
