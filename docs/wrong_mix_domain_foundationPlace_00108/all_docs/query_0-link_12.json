        "text": "A COLLECTOR OPENS HIS HANDS to reveal a fistful of ruby-red pills. “I’m no longer an art collector, I’m a drug addict,” he jokes, before swallowing them in one gulp. It’s Tuesday evening after the Fifty-Fourth Art Basel opening, and we’re perched in a lively, wood-lined mezzanine at an Alpine-themed cottage above medieval Barfüsserplatz. “When you get old, you need these, just to eat,” he groans. He starts telling me about his first art acquisitions: Man Ray and Joan Miró lithographs at auction.\n\n“When was that?” I ask.\n\n“About 1970.”\n\nThe business is graying. As a generation of gallerists and collectors born between the late 1930s and the early 1950s retires, bows out, or dies, questions arise about the future of an industry in which singular personalities have long ruled the roost. Many dealers, some of whom got their start through earlier generational inheritances, have succession plans underway. Others don’t. That’s because the bonds solidified over many decades of phone calls, breakfast meetings, studio visits, late-night drinks, and fairs like this one are not fungible. “Relationships are the basis of the whole industry,” Bärbel Trautwein of Trautwein Herleth told me as she was leaving Basel. “And they’re not easily transferable from one person to the next. There is a generational shift happening. In some cases, when the owner dies or decides to stop the business, the whole gallery stops.”\n\nTrautwein and Daniel Herleth, who took ownership of Berlin’s Barbara Weiss Galerie in 2016, are examples of that rare thing: a successful gallery transition after the death of a much-admired founder. This year, they’ve had their inaugural booth at Art Basel following the recent renaming of the gallery from Barbara Weiss—who opened the highly regarded Berlin gallery in 1992—to Trautwein Herleth. A conceptual sculpture by Sung Tieu hung alongside paintings by gallery mainstays Monika Baer and Raoul De Keyser. Trautwein told me: “When we spoke to Kasper König [Weiss’s widower and legendary curator], who helped us realize the legal side of the ownership transfer, about changing the name, his reply was: ‘What took you so long?’”\n\nI had barely returned from Basel when I learned that Barbara Gladstone, one of the most revered dealers in the industry, had died at the age of eighty-nine while on a business trip to Paris. She leaves behind a near-unequaled (in our time) legacy of putting artists first—and a succession plan involving Max Falkenstein and Gavin Brown. Last year, when Gladstone was asked by Charlotte Burns on a podcast about the future of the gallery, Gladstone responded, about the team she set in place to steer things after her: “I think that these people are all working together now very well. I don’t go to art fairs anymore. They do perfectly beautifully without me.”\n\nBut mostly, in this business, blood is thicker than water. On Tuesday, I strolled past David Zwirner’s painting-heavy booth, and remembered how, when Gerhard Richter left his long-standing champion Marian Goodman in 2022, he cited the old rheinisch connections between him and Rudolf Zwirner, David Zwirner’s gallerist father. “I have known David since his childhood as I had already in the 1960s worked closely with his father, Rudolf Zwirner,” Richter said in a statement at the time, adding: “I feel this represents a beautiful continuity across generations.”\n\nFamily succession came to the fore in other ways. “It’s the first time we’re showing my father’s work at a fair,” Berta Fischer, the artist and Konrad Fischer gallerist, told me from her booth on the Messehalle’s prestigious ground floor. We were standing next to a 2024 Rachel Harrison sculpture, some Carl Andre floor tiles from 2009, and a bold, patterned 1966 painting by Berta Fischer’s father, the artist Konrad Lueg, also known as the gallerist Konrad Fischer. “Fresh, isn’t it?” Berta offered.\n\nLueg’s painting was made just before Konrad switched hats (and names) and opened his epoch-making exhibition space in Düsseldorf (incidentally, with a Carl Andre floor work) in 1967. “As you know, my father had an artist group together with Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke,” Fischer continued. “This work, which I’m showing with Greene Naftali, who represents the estate, is one of a series of pattern paintings resembling wallpaper. It’s very rare.” (Fischer and Greene Naftali are planning a Lueg exhibition in the next couple of years.) I asked her about how they arrived at the solution for Fischer to take over the business in 2015: “There was never any question about stopping the gallery,” she said. “It was always about family.”\n\nIt’s an oft-repeated pattern: The gallerist apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Pauline Seguin, who started Berlin’s Heidi gallery in 2021, was walking around the fair on Tuesday. She’s the daughter of Patrick Seguin, the Paris dealer focused on midcentury design and decorative arts. Tina Kim, who runs an innovative program in New York representing Asian American and Asian diasporic art, began at Seoul’s Kukje gallery, founded by her mother, Hyun-Sook Lee. (It was Kim’s debut presentation at Art Basel Galleries this year.) Philomene Magers, of German powerhouse Sprüth Magers, took the reins of her mother’s gallery in Bonn, and subsequently opened her own Cologne gallery in 1991, all while she was still in her twenties. And Gió Marconi, whose father, Giorgio Marconi, died in May, got a start in his father’s Studio Marconi in Milan, opened by Giorgio in 1965, where Gió cut his teeth before opening his namesake gallery in 1990.\n\n“It was always a little competitive with my father, but it was good in the end. He was very open to make me try things and allow me to make mistakes,” Marconi told me. At his stand, Marconi had recent paintings by André Butzer and Patrizio di Massimo alongside a salon-style showcase of historical Sonia Delaunay gouaches and works on paper dating from the 1920s. “They belonged to the collection of my father, who bought them in the 1980s and exhibited them in the gallery,” Marconi said. “His own father was a framer who exhibited and framed the painters of the time, such as Giorgio Morandi. The Delaunay frames were designed by my father, who continued our family tradition of framing.”\n\nI’d taken the tram from my hotel to the world’s flagship art fair on Tuesday morning—for many, the most important day of the most important week of the year—and, crossing the bridge into Kleinbasel, noticed the Rhine was moving faster than I’d ever seen (it was closed for swimming). As I breezed through the second floor of the hall, it felt airier than I’d remembered. Within the hour, I’d twice heard rumors that big international collectors from the US and Asia hadn’t showed up. One theory? “They’re holding off for the Grand Palais in October,” one curator told me, “not quiet Basel.” In a year when cyberattacks and auction-house layoffs signify a jumpy economy for art, the tiniest hiccup is reason for anxiety. If the big international fish weren’t biting by Tuesday morning, this was significant.“We’ve heard that too,” Vincenzo de Bellis, Art Basel’s director of fairs and exhibition platforms, said to me later in the week, after I’d asked whether international collectors were really holding off for Art Basel Paris. “Several people have told us that people they were expecting to see didn’t come,” he said, emphasizing that the figures don’t quite bear this out. “It’s more of a feeling, but our initial numbers don’t show this. The number of American VIP cardholders is higher this year than last. We have seen many American board members and professionals here. But I won’t deny that people are excited by the reopening of the Grand Palais, and the newly rebranded Art Basel Paris. But Art Basel is the global fair par excellence.” (A Mexico City–based gallerist was more succinct: “There’s no free port in France.”) In any case, within the day, there were reports of a $20 million sale of Joan Mitchell’s Sunflowers (1990–91) at David Zwirner, and Iwan Wirth was boasting of bucking the art press’s “doom porn”: prognostications of a market collapse. Still, all of this suggests old, deep pockets. Where, I wondered, was the new generation of collectors?\n\nThe problem is that Joan Mitchells, Gerhard Richters, and Arshile Gorkys represent only one (legacy) market segment. Success is not spread evenly throughout the sector. As one Swiss collector said to me on Friday, “This is happening in every industry in the world right now. It’s easier to move a $15 million house than a $2 million one. The most expensive Range Rover is sold out. There are waiting lists for ultra-luxury watches. But below that, the economy is fragile.” Just talk to the smaller galleries showing at Liste, or many on the second floor of Art Basel, or the young galleries at Basel Social Club. “How was it?” I asked a dealer in Art Basel with locations in Germany and New York. He just shrugged. Another New York–based gallerist was more forthcoming: “It was bad.” As Marc Spiegler, former Art Basel head, told me recently: “If anyone says they are killing it right now, they are lying.”\n\n“The Art Basel floor plan will look very different in five years,” said the Düsseldorf gallerist Max Mayer, whose father, Hans Mayer, had (until shortly before his death in 2023) a booth in every Art Basel since the fair’s inception in 1970. The gallery is today run by Hans’s widow, Stephanie Mayer, and daughter Marie Brenninkmeyer. Max launched his own, highly intellectual, program in 2011, and their respective galleries moved into adjacent floors of Düsseldorf’s Schmela Haus in 2020. “Early on I realized that succeeding my father would mean taking the same risks he took, and engaging with the same challenges that he had during his own moment.” It’s Max Mayer’s third year in the main section of Art Basel, including works by Flora Klein and Jef Geys.\n\nHans Mayer is no longer at the Messe. Once-esteemed galleries like Seville’s Juana de Aizpuru, which was founded in 1970 and last showed at Basel in 2022, have shuttered, their closure seemingly related to a lack of clear succession plans. The eighty-year-old Marlborough Gallery, which once represented the likes of Francis Bacon and Paula Rego, officially shut this month—following a longer-term dispute between the owning family and board members. For now it seems unimaginable that a gallery like Gagosian could, years from now, be embroiled in a succession dispute—but then again, what to make of the news that Gagosian COO Andrew Fabricant, who some believed would be involved in Gagosian’s succession plans, left the gallery abruptly, together with his wife, Laura Paulson, who ran the gallery’s advisory business?\n\nIncreasingly, it will fall on the younger generation to sort all this out. There was a historical bent in many of the booths—cynics would say that postwar painting is a reliable investment, and that younger galleries are working more and more with estates. Tokyo’s Take Ninagawa showed excellent midcentury Gutai works, such as paintings by Shozo Shimamoto. Nathalie Obadia (from Paris and Brussels) had turbulent, muddy canvases from the 1960s and 1990s by Paris School expressionist Roger-Edgar Gillet.\n\n“I visited with Leonora Carrington during the last seven years of her life,” San Francisco gallerist Wendi Norris said, touring me through a would-be bestiary of Carrington works in one of the standout booths at the fair. “This one,” she said, pointing to Double Portrait (1937–40), “was likely rolled up with some of Max Ernst’s canvases when he fled the war for New York with Peggy Guggenheim in 1943.” Steps away, Dominik Müller of the Basel Galerie Mueller, founded in 2018 and specializing in twentieth-century art, was activating one of several Jean Tinguely machines as the booth filled up with smiling visitors. “This one is the actual skeleton of Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle’s dog,” his director explained.\n\nOn Tuesday night, I sat with esteemed Vienna gallerist Rosemarie Schwarzwälder, who was showing me photos of the Katharina Grosse paintings in the showroom she’d just opened the previous weekend in Zurich. “It’s about the long game,” she said. “It’s about supporting artists, even when they aren’t making money, and over the long term.” I’d just been speaking with Raphael Oberhuber, her son, who directs Berlin’s highbrow KOW gallery (cofounded by his older brother Nikolaus). “Basel’s been nice,” Oberhuber said. “My mother and I are sharing an apartment. We wake up every morning and have breakfast together. And, yes, I’m moving to Vienna to work more with her.” My eyebrows raised. Just then, as the dinner got boisterous, a guest knocked over a glass. The spilled red wine drew a thick line of crimson on the floor. “What do you know, there really is a bloodline here,” somebody said."
