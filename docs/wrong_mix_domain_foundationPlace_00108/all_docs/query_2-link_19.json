        "text": "Switzerland has often seen itself, or has been seen by others, as a “special case” (Sonderfall), largely because of multilingualism, its diversified cultural patchwork, and its institutions, but also because of its economic success after World War II. Although some of the political and institutional peculiarities still persist, the rapid modernization of daily life in Switzerland is reflected in changes in the country’s habits and cuisine.\n\nSwiss cuisine has traditionally been marked by important cultural and regional variations. Cheese dishes are typical of the Alpine regions. The national dish, fondue neuchâteloise (a mixture of melted Emmentaler and Gruyère cheeses and wine into which bread cubes are dipped), and raclette (cheese melted over a fire and scraped over potatoes or bread) are popular not only throughout the country but in much of the world. The Swiss chocolate industry, which originally grew out of the need to utilize the abundant milk produced in the pre-Alpine dairying regions, is world famous. Also popular are spiced, glazed honey cakes known as Leckerli. The preferred dish of German Switzerland is Rösti (fried shredded potatoes), but sausages and sauerkraut are also popular. Other popular dishes include Zürcher Eintopf, or Zürich-style beef stew, and, around the lakes of eastern Switzerland, the delicate fish Zander (pike perch). Specialty and seasonal dishes, such as the autumn bratwurst from Sankt Gallen, distinguish one region from another, as do the country’s abundant wines and beers (which now include Maisgold, or beer made from corn).\n\nWestern Switzerland is influenced by French cuisine and culture, and in Ticino pasta, polenta, and risotto are signs of a common culture with Italy. Despite the longevity of traditional culinary influences, modern Swiss cuisine is characterized by international trends, and restaurants with cuisines from all over the globe can be found even in smaller cities. There are many American fast-food chains, even in Alpine resorts such as Zermatt and Saint Moritz.\n\nVisitors to Switzerland go there to eat, but more go to shop, especially along Zürich’s famed Bahnhofstrasse, an avenue that is home to both fine shops—including the country’s renowned jewelers and watchmakers—and leading banks. Along the Bahnhofstrasse, shoppers can find Switzerland’s famous timepieces, local handicrafts, and books as well as dine in elegant cafés. Each city and town of any size has a similar venue, and some have more than one shopping district; for example, just across the Limmat River from the Bahnhofstrasse lies Zürich’s youth-oriented Niederdorfstrasse, which features bistros, shops, and ethnic restaurants.\n\nIn general, the habits of city dwellers mirror those of urbanites in other parts of the world. Typical Swiss folk culture (e.g., yodeling and playing the alphorn) is still practiced in some rural areas. Early autumn’s annual Alpabzug, in which cattle are driven from Alpine pastures to lower elevations, is the occasion for rural fairs and auctions that emphasize rural traditions, and many cities and larger towns host farmers’ markets that join urban and rural areas. Stand wrestling (Schwingen), in which combatants wear wrestling breeches, can be seen in many regional festivals, and in some mountain villages, such as in Valais, traditional rural costumes are sometimes worn.\n\nFamily and household structures have considerably changed since the mid-20th century. The divorce rate nearly quadrupled between 1960 and the turn of the 21st century. The proportion of family households dropped, a reflection of both an increase in divorce rates and an aging population."
