        "text": "As member of the Cancer Biology and Evolution Group and the Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology, my research and collaborations are multi-disciplinary. I have ongoing collaborations with Drs. Robert Gatenby and Sandy Alexander on applying ecological principles to understanding cancer. In terms of experimental work, I enjoy collaborative work on skin cancer cell culturing with Ken Tsai, competition experiments to explore the cost of resistance with Dr. Robert Gillies and his group, mouse model work on prostate cancer and the evolution of cancer resistance with Drs. Gatenby and Arig Ibrahim. In terms of clinical trials, I have been part of a team led by Jngsong Zhang to examine the efficacy of Adaptive therapy for late stage metastatic castrate resistant cancer (Phase I trial). Currently working with Dr. Christine Chung and her team on a phase II trial for metastatic thyroid cancer. My work is highly collaborative and I look forward to extending and integrating my work to serve the experimentalists, mathematicians and clinicians.I use a combination of mathematical and experimental approaches to understand how organisms interact with and shape their environments. Squirrels are a particular favorite model system, as they have evolved unique attributes and behaviors for climbing trees, storing acorns and other foods, and avoiding predators. In viewing animals through their ecosystems and adaptations."
