        "text": "Cosmopolitan charm, a fusion of historical elegance and modern artistry, and the unparalleled beauty of the Rhine river make Basel one of Central Europe’s hidden gems.\n\nSince its foundation, Basel has steadily evolved, today standing as Switzerland’s ‘cultural capital’. But don’t let its historical façade fool you – this vibrant city pulses with contemporary energy, often centered around its famed Art Basel event.\n\nBut what to do there? Dive into world-renowned art galleries or meander through the cobbled streets of the medieval old town. Embrace the melodies of the Rhine on a scenic bike trip, or indulge in delectable local treats ranging from spiced biscuits to sumptuous onion tarts or creamy garlic soups.\n\nWhether you’re an art enthusiast, a history buff, or simply seeking a European weekend gateway, Basel promises a myriad of unforgettable experiences.\n\nIn this article we will look at some fun things to do in Basel to give you some inspiration for how to plan your next visit!\n\n1 – Admire the impressive gothic Basel Minster\n\nThe Basel Minster is a reformed Protestant church made out of red sandstone. The roof stands out with picturesque brightly patterned tiles. The hill where the Minster stands is steeped in history, originally housing a Celtic fortified city and then later a Roman fort!\n\nThe original Minster was constructed between the 9th and the 13th centuries however the Minster was rebuilt in 1356 after an earthquake. Incredibly enough the St Gallus romanesque doorway survived the earthquake damage so visitors can still admire the beautiful 12th century stone carvings.\n\nInside the Minster there is a crypt containing graves that date back to 1000 AD. It is here that we can find the tomb of Erasmus of Rotterdam. Other illustrious figures buried within the crypts include Queen Anna Gertrude, the wife of King Rudolf I of Germany who died in 1981.\n\nIt is free to enter the Basel Minster church and cloister however there is a fee for climbing up the tower.\n\nwalking tours in Basel\n\n2 – Take a tour of the Basel old town\n\nAt Marktplatz visitors will come across the Basel Town Hall, which like the Minster is made from bright red sandstone. The town hall was constructed between 1504 and 1514 and the impressive tower was added in the 1800s.\n\nStep into the town hall courtyard to admire the restored wall paintings and an incredible statue from 1574 that represents the Roman senator Munatius Plancus who founded the oldest Roman colony on the Rhine, the nearby Augusta Raurica.\n\nMarktplatz has a daily market where visitors can purchase some tasty Swiss specialities!\n\nThere are many other interesting things to keep an eye out for when walking around the old town area and surroundings. Look out for St. Peter’s Church which is the oldest parish church in Basel. Inside St Peter’s visitors can admire the beautiful stained glass windows and wall frescoes. While walking around look out for the ‘Cherry Garden House’ an example of a late Renaissance townhouse.\n\nMake sure to look out for any basilisk fountains known as ‘Basiliskenbrunnen’ Basel has over 230 fountains with illustrated figures that all considered safe to drink from!\n\nBasel old town tours\n\n3 – Pause on the Middle Bridge to take in spectacular views of the Rhine river\n\nThe Middle bridge is a granite bridge with seven arches that was completed in 1905. The bridge connects the Basel old town with the new town and since 2015 the bridge has been car free.\n\nIn the centre of the bridge there is a small gothic chapel called Käppelijoch. The chapel has a small statue of a bishop surrounded by angels because the Prince-Bishop Heinrich von Thun pushed for the construction of the original bridge back in 1225.\n\nLegend has it the small chapel in the centre of the bridge was where criminals or accused witches were thrown of the bridge into the river below!\n\nAlthough the bridge we can walk on today was completed in the 20th century, it is amazing to think that a bridge has stood on the same site for centuries! The chapel standing today on the bridge is a replica and the original can be found in the Historical Museum in Basel.\n\n4 – Undercover city legends during the Night watchman Tours\n\nWander through the historical narrow alleyways of Basel in the company of actors in costume who make the tales of the past come to life.
