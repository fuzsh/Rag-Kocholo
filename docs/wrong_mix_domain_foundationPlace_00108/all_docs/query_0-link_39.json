        "text": "The effects of rivers on the regions through which they flow tend to alternate between trends toward unifying the regions culturally and politically and making a political boundary of the river. Of this phenomenon the Rhine is a classic example. During prehistoric times the same culture groups existed on both banks; similarly, in early historic times Germanic tribes settled on either side of its lower and Celts alongside its upper course. Although bridged and crossed by Julius Caesar in 55 and 53 bce, the Rhine became for the first time, along its course from Lake Constance to its mouth at Lugdunum Batavorum (Leiden, Netherlands), a political boundary—that of Roman Gaul. This division did not endure for long, because under the emperor Augustus the provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior were established on the other side of the Rhine, and south of Bonna (Bonn) the boundary of the Roman Empire was marked by the limes (Roman fortified frontier) well east of the river. Nevertheless, because the Rhine had been the boundary of Gaul for a time, it resulted in later claims by France, esteeming itself the successor to Gaul, to the Rhine as its natural boundary. When the Western Roman Empire disintegrated, the Rhine was crossed along its entire length by Germanic tribes (406 ce), and the river formed the central backbone first of the kingdom of the Franks and then of the Carolingian empire. When in 843 that empire was divided, stretches of the Rhine formed the eastern boundary of the central part, Lorraine (Lotharingia), until 870 when the Rhine again became the central axis of a political unit, the Holy Roman Empire. Subsequent events shifted the axis of this empire eastward and caused political disintegration along the Rhine. The Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) ended with the final separation of the Rhine headwaters and delta area from Germany and a gradual advance of France toward the Rhine, which it reached under Louis XIV through his acquisition of Alsace.\n\nThe French Revolutionary Wars included further French advances, and the Treaty of Lunéville (1801) made the Rhine, along most of its course, France’s eastern boundary. But France advanced beyond the Rhine and included northwestern Germany within its borders, and the Confederation of the Rhine, created by Napoleon, extended French control as far as the Elbe and Neisse rivers. The resultant upsurge of German nationalism was expressed by E.M. Arndt, who in 1813 wrote, “The Rhine is Germany’s river, not its boundary.” The Congress of Vienna, nevertheless, left France in possession of Alsace and thus with a Rhine frontier. Ambitions of Napoleon III to acquire further Rhenish territory strongly aroused German feelings. In 1840 Max Schneckenburger wrote his patriotic poem “Die Wacht am Rhein” (“The Watch on the Rhine”), which was set to music by Karl Wilhelm in 1854 and became the rousing tune of the Prussian armies in the Franco-German War of 1870–71. One result of this war was that France lost Alsace and thus its Rhine frontier, which it regained after World War I.\n\nThe fortified defensive system of the Maginot Line (built in 1927–36) adjoined the French bank of the upper Rhine from the Swiss frontier to near Lauterbourg. The opposing Westwall, or Siegfried Line (1936–39), adjoined the German bank from the Swiss frontier to near Karlsruhe.\n\nEvents after World War II suggested that the struggle for possession of the Rhine had been superseded by a trend toward economic and even political union of the riparian states. In addition, the increased pollution of the Rhine has resulted in growing international cooperation to combat the threat. One of the defining moments in the Rhine’s environmental history came in November 1986, when a fire at a chemical warehouse in the Schweizerhalle industrial zone in Basel, Switzerland, released 20–30 tons of pesticides and other chemicals into the river. The spill turned the river red, contaminating the Rhine’s eel fishery and killing hundreds of thousands of other fish as the toxic plume made its way downstream to the sea. That environmental disaster prompted a reexamination of safety and storage standards for industrial chemicals in the countries bordering the Rhine, and it inspired the creation of international environmental management plans that greatly improved the river’s water quality by the early 21st century."
