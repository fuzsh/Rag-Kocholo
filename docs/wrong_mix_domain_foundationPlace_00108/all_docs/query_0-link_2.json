        "text": "Broadway opening: October 6, 2013, Neil Simon Theatre; 98 performances\n\nDirected and Choreographed by Susan Stroman\n\nMusic direction by Mary-Mitchell Campbell; orchestrations by Larry Hochman; dance arrangements by Sam Davis; music coordinator Michael Keller\n\nScenic design by Julian Crouch; lighting design by Donald Holder; sound design by Jon Weston; projection design by Benjamin Pearcy for 59 Productions\n\nCostume Design by William Ivey Long; wig and hair design by Paul Huntley; makeup design by Angelina Avallone\n\nVocal Arrangements and Incidental Music by Andrew Lippa\n\nCast included: Norbert Leo Butz, Kate Baldwin, Bobby Steggert, Ryan Andes, Brad Oscar\n\nThe original Broadway cast recording is highly recommended, as are Daniel Wallace’s novel and Tim Burton’s film version, available on DVD and Blu-Ray. John August’s motion picture screenplay is available in published form, with good additional essays.\n\nBirmingham-born novelist Daniel Wallace was asked about the recurring themes of mythology which appear in his first published novel, Big Fish: A Story of Epic Proportions. “Myths are just great stories, and they are the origin for all story, and all of our stories, literary and religious… But I have always been aware that where there is a story there is someone telling it, and that the person telling the story is a part of the story, and to pretend otherwise is pretense.”\n\nIt is this fascination with tales and tale-tellers that propels all three versions of Big Fish – the 1998 novel, the 2003 film, and the 2013 Broadway musical.\n\nWallace was inspired to write his novel in part by his own complicated father, and also by the fact he had recently become a father himself. “There are many similarities between my father and Edward Bloom. Like Edward, my father was an extremely charismatic man who sometimes used his charisma to keep people at a distance. It would appear as though he was being intimate with you when he was really just being charming.”\n\nThe title of the book came from one of his father’s favorite expressions. “Throughout his entire life, my father talked about leaving the small town in which he was born for the big city, because, as he put it, he didn’t want to be a ‘big fish in a little pond.’ So he left Cullman, Alabama, and became an international businessman. But that title has other meanings, as well. A fish can be real slippery, like Edward Bloom, you can never really get a hold of him.”\n\nWallace’s novel also celebrates one particular and time-honored Southern tradition, the interweaving of truth and fiction, fact and exaggeration. “Edward is a compulsive storyteller and that’s what Southern literature is about: storytelling, almost for its own sake. Folk tales and tall tales demand that the truth be stretched, a little or a lot. It’s sleight of hand, a form of magic—possibly the only real magic many of us have an opportunity to be a part of in our adult lives. It’s the magic a child experiences while growing up, one that most of us unfortunately lose.”\n\nScreenwriter John August read a copy of Wallace’s novel prior to publication, and became so enamored that he persuaded a reluctant Columbia Studios to purchase it for film production, and immediately began working on a treatment.\n\nWallace, who never dreamed that his loosely structured novel could be filmed, was happy to turn the screenwriting over to August, realizing that a movie version would need a different approach, with more structure and narrative drive.\n\nWallace and August met (at an IHOP in Washington D.C.) and the novelist willingly shared some of the secrets behind the stories, including the influences of both classic mythology and of American tall tales that are verbally passed down between generations.\n\nAugust explains, “They’re tales that have been told hundreds of times, not merely to recount what happened, but what should have happened. They’re extreme versions of life, superlative versions of the way you’d like life to be. Edward has a need to tell these stories continually so that everybody will remember them and, in the process, remember him.”\n\nAugust shaped his screenplay by expanding the role of Will, Edward’s son, making him both a reporter (another storyteller) and a soon-to-be parent, desperate to clarify the father-son dynamic before his own child is born, and before time runs out to reconcile with his own father. The role of Sandra, wife, mother, and mediator, was also largely created by August.\n\nFor the film version, pairs of actors played the characters at different ages, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor as older and younger Edward, Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman as Sandra, and Billy Crudup and child actor Grayson Stone sharing the role of Will. Other performers included Marion Cotillard (Will’s wife Josephine), Helena Bonham Carter (Jenny Hill and The Witch), Danny DeVito (Amos Calloway), Robert Guillaume (Dr. Bennett), and Matthew McGrory (Karl the Giant). Directed by fantasy filmmaker Tim Burton, the 2003 film was a commercial and critical success.\n\nWhen John August and some Columbia executives began entertaining the thought of turning the show into a musical for Broadway, a different approach was discussed. Theatrical license allows stage actors to play a variety of ages, so it was decided to cast only one Edward and one Sandra, allowing them to play their relationship from beginning to end, although two actors would still be needed to play Will in childhood and adulthood. For clarity, fewer of Edward’s adventures would be dramatized, but audiences would get to know the characters more deeply.\n\nSongwriter Andrew Lippa, who had made a strong impression with his work on You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown, John and Jen and The Wild Party, was engaged to work with John August to develop the musical. After a try-out in Chicago in April of 2013, the show underwent some fairly substantial revisions and opened on Broadway that fall. Although the run was briefer than its creators hoped, the show found devoted fans and admirers, and over 100 licenses for the show have been signed for new productions around the country.\n\nAndrew Lippa visited Wichita last May for some musical theatre workshops, and to share insights about the musical Big Fish. As was true for Wallace and August, Lippa drew heavily on his feelings about his own family. “Edward is an embellisher; he’s a born storyteller,” Lippa says. “It’s about the son really learning how to grow up and how to appreciate his father for who he is and not who he wants him to be.”\n\nSince musical theatre songs can reveal characters’ thoughts in a very unique way, Lippa was able to give Edward a final moment to describe what motivated him. “He stands there in front of all the people who love him, and he sings, ‘I know I wasn’t perfect, I know my life was small, I know that I pretended that I knew it all. But when you tell my story, and I hope somebody does, remember me as something bigger than I was.”\n\n“And for me, that’s something I truly feel,” Lippa says. “I feel like that was what my father wanted as well. I think that’s what many people want, to be acknowledged that we did the best we could, but when you talk about me, just make it a little bit better. Not completely crazy better. Just a little bit better.”\n\nMusic Theatre Wichita is excited and proud to introduce this insightful and charming new musical to our audiences. We have loved working on it, and we hope it amuses, inspires and moves you, too."
