        "text": "1990s and 2000s\n\n1995–1998: Junior years\n\nMain article: Roger Federer junior years\n\nIn 1995, at age 13, Federer won the U14 Swiss national junior championship and was subsequently invited to train at the prestigious National Tennis Centre in the French-speaking Écublens, where he enrolled shortly after his 14th birthday.[19][24] There, he had the opportunity to combine three hours of tennis training per day alongside education, but Federer had little interest in studying and struggled to balance his education with his tennis commitments.[17] Speaking little French and struggling with the whole concept of living away from home, Federer found his first months at Écublens depressing.[17] He was the youngest player in the group and also felt isolated as the “Swiss German” by many of the students and staff at the academy, experienced mild bullying, and was often on the verge of packing his bags and returning home.[17] Federer credits this difficult period of his life as the reason behind his independent spirit.[17]\n\nFederer played his first ITF junior match in July 1996, at the age of 14, at a grade-2 tournament in Switzerland.[25] He then played in the 1996 NEC World Youth Cup Final in Zürich against tennis players like Lleyton Hewitt.[26][27] In January 1997, at age 15, Federer won both the indoor and outdoor U18 Swiss national championship, defeating the three-year older Yves Allegro in both finals.[28] In May, Federer won his first-ever ITF junior title on the clay courts of a second-category tournament in Prato, doing so without the loss of a set.[29] In September, Federer earned the first 12 ATP points of his career in a four-week Swiss satellite tournament in Bossonnens, thus making his debut in the ATP rankings at No. 803, just five spots ahead of future rival Lleyton Hewitt.[28][29][30]\n\nHis main accomplishments as a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998, when he won both the Boys' singles final over Irakli Labadze,[31] and the Boys' doubles final, teamed with Olivier Rochus, defeating the team of Michaël Llodra and Andy Ram.[32] Federer then reached the US Open Junior final, which he lost to David Nalbandian; this was the only occasion Federer lost a final on the junior circuit.[29] He then brought his junior career to an end at the prestigious Junior Orange Bowl in Miami, where he defeated Nalbandian in the semifinals and Guillermo Coria in the final.[29] By the end of 1998 he attained the No. 1 junior world ranking and was awarded ITF Junior World Champion.[33] He ended his junior career at the end of 1998 with a high-ranking of No. 1 in singles and No. 7 in doubles (both attained on 31 December 1998) and a win–loss record of 78–20 in singles and 36–21 in doubles.[34]\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – Singles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\n\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\n\nWimbledon: W (1998)\n\nUS Open: F (1998)\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – Doubles:\n\nAustralian Open: SF (1998)\n\nFrench Open: 1R (1998)\n\nWimbledon: W (1998)\n\nUS Open: 1R (1998)\n\n1998–2002: Early professional career\n\nMain article: Roger Federer's early career\n\nIn July 1998, an almost 17-year-old Federer made his ATP debut at the Swiss Open Gstaad, in his home country of Switzerland, losing to No. 88 Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.[35][36] Later that year, he won his first ATP match against Guillaume Raoux in Toulouse.[37] He then received a wildcard into the 1998 Swiss Indoors in his hometown in Basel, where he lost in the first round to former world No. 1 Andre Agassi.[38] He finished 1998 ranked as the world No. 301.[33]\n\nIn April 1999, Federer made his Davis Cup debut in a World Group first round against Italy, defeating Davide Sanguinetti.[39] In August, Federer won his first-ever professional title on the Challenger tour in Segovia, pairing with Sander Groen to beat Ota Fukárek and Alejandro Hernández in the final, which was played on Federer's 18th birthday.[40] Despite losing in the first rounds of both the French Open and Wimbledon and having just turned 18, he entered the world’s Top 100 for the first time on 20 September 1999.[33] Later that month, Federer won his first and only singles ATP Challenger title in Brest, defeating Max Mirnyi in the final.[41] In his first full year as a professional, Federer finished the year as the world No. 64,[24] and in doing so at 18 years and four months of age, he became the youngest player to end the year among the world’s top 100.[42][43]\n\nHis first Grand Slam win came at the Australian Open, where he defeated former World No. 2 Michael Chang.[26] His first singles final came at the Marseille Open in February 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset.[42] Federer then entered the Top 50 in March and ended 2000 ranked as the world No. 29.[33] Federer made his Olympic debut at Sydney, where he surprised many by reaching the semifinals, where he lost to Tommy Haas and then to Arnaud Di Pasquale in the bronze medal match.[42][44] In January 2001, Federer won the Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with world No. 1 Martina Hingis.[45][46] The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer later said that his experience with Hingis \"definitely helped me to become the player I am today.\"[47]\n\nIn 2001, Federer won his first singles title at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter in the final.[42][48] Federer then reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, losing to former world No. 2 and eventual finalist Àlex Corretja.[49] His international breakthrough came at the Wimbledon Championships, when the 19-year-old Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras in the fourth round. Federer defeated the No. 1 seed in a five-set match to snap Sampras' 31-match win streak at Wimbledon before losing in the quarter-finals to Tim Henman.[42][50][51]\n\nIn 2002, Federer reached his first Masters final at the Miami event, where he lost to Andre Agassi,[52] but then won his first Masters title in Hamburg, defeating Marat Safin in the final; the victory put him in the top 10 for the first time.[53] On 1 August, Federer suffered the devastating loss of his long-time Australian coach and mentor, Peter Carter, in a car crash in South Africa.[33] Although he suffered first-round losses in the three tournaments he entered after Carter's death, Federer gathered himself together and began playing with more determination than ever.[54] After reaching the fourth round of the US Open, he won the Vienna Open,[55] jumping in the rankings from No. 13 at the end of September to No. 7 by early November, which allowed him to qualify for the first time for the year-end Masters Cup, where he won all of his matches in the round-robin stage before losing the semifinals to the then-world no. 1 and eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt.[56] At age 21, he ended 2002 ranked as the world No. 6.[53]\n\n2003: Grand Slam breakthrough at Wimbledon\n\nIn 2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Andy Roddick in the semifinals and Mark Philippoussis in the final.[57][58] In doing so, he joined the likes of Björn Borg, Pat Cash and Stefan Edberg as the only singles players to win both the junior and senior Wimbledon titles.[29] In August he had a chance to take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time from Andre Agassi if he made it to the Montreal final. However, he fell in the semifinals to Roddick, in a final-set tiebreaker, leaving him 120 points behind Agassi.[59] This, coupled with early losses to David Nalbandian at Cincinnati and the US Open, denied Federer the chance to become No. 1 in 2003.[60]\n\nFederer won his first and only doubles Masters event in Miami with Max Mirnyi, beating the pair of Leander Paes and David Rikl in the final.[61] He then reached the singles final of the Rome Masters on clay, which he lost to Félix Mantilla.[62] Federer reached nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them on four different surfaces, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna, defeating Jiří Novák and Carlos Moyá in the respective finals.[63] Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi, finishing the year as world No. 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick by only 160 points.[64]\n\n2004: Imposing dominance\n\nIn 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles, becoming the first person to do so in a single season since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first major hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, making him the world No. 1 for the first time.[65] He then won the Indian Wells on hardcourts and the Hamburg Masters on clay, beating Tim Henman and Guillermo Coria in the finals respectively, snapping the latter's 31-match winning streak on clay.[66] Federer won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick.[67]\n\nAt the Summer Olympics in Athens, Federer was the clear favorite after claiming the world No. 1 ranking for the first time earlier in the year.[65] However, he lost in the second round to 18-year-old Tomáš Berdych.[68] He then won the Canada Masters, defeating Roddick in the final.[69] At the US Open, Federer defeated the 2001 champion, Lleyton Hewitt, for his first title there.[70] Federer also won his first tournament on home soil by capturing the Swiss Open in Gstaad and he wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time after beating Hewitt in the final.[71]\n\nHis 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74–6 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986.[72]\n\n2005: Consolidating dominance\n\nIn 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.[73] However, Federer reestablished his dominance on grass, winning Wimbledon for a third time by defeating Andy Roddick.[74] At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last major final.[75][76]\n\nFederer also took four Masters wins: Indian Wells, Miami and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.[75] The win in Miami was particularly noteworthy as it was the first final contested between Federer and Nadal. Federer recovered from two sets down to take the final in five sets. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai.[75] Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian in five sets while playing through a foot injury that sidelined him for almost the rest of the season after September.[77] He maintained his position as No. 1 for the entire season.[75]\n\nThat year, Federer won 11 singles titles, which tied his mark during the 2004 season. Federer's 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the third-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind John McEnroe's 1984 and Jimmy Connors's 1974.[78]\n\n2006: Career-best season\n\nThe 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.[79]\n\nFederer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since Thomas Muster in 1995 and John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92–5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982). Federer reached the finals in an astounding 16 of the 17 tournaments he entered during the season.[80]\n\nIn 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open.[80] This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis,[81] and at the US Open, Federer defeated 2003 champion Roddick.[80] In addition, Federer reached six Masters finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer, however, consistently pushed Nadal to the limit on clay throughout the season taking him to fourth-set tiebreakers in Monte-Carlo and Paris, and a thrilling match in Rome that went to a deciding fifth-set tiebreaker.[82]\n\nFederer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world No. 1.[81] Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters, in what was Federer's only defeat before the final of a tournament that year.[83] Federer finished the season on a 29-match winning streak, as well as winning 48 of his last 49 matches after the French Open.[84]\n\nNear the end of the season, he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries.[85]\n\n2007: Holding off young rivals\n\nIn 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. At the Australian Open, he became the first man since Björn Borg in 1980 to win a major without dropping a set, beating Fernando González in the final.[86] Federer captured his fourth Dubai crown to extend his winning streak to 41 matches, the longest of his career and only five shy of the all-time record. Federer then entered Indian Wells as the three-time defending champion, but his streak ended in controversy when he was defeated by Guillermo Cañas, who had failed a drug test for illegal doping.[87] This surprising first-round loss marked the first time that he was defeated since August 2006, a period spanning over seven months.[88]\n\nDuring the clay season, Federer snapped Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-era record, in the final of the Hamburg Masters after turning the match around from a set down, including a final set bagel.[89] This win convinced some that Federer could win the French Open to become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, but instead he lost in a four-set final to Nadal again.[90] At Wimbledon, Federer defeated Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980. This victory equaled him with Björn Borg for the record of five consecutive Wimbledon championships.[91]\n\nAt the Canada Masters, Federer lost in the final to Novak Djokovic in a final-set tiebreaker upset. Federer rebounded in Cincinnati to capture his fifth title of the year.[92] Federer entered the US Open as the three-time defending champion and faced Djokovic in the final. This time, Federer prevailed in a close straight-set match.[93] This victory moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of major championship victories. He closed out the year with victories in Basel and the year-end championships in Shanghai.[94]\n\nHe finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, compiling an impressive 68–9 record. After his phenomenal triple Grand Slam season yet again, Federer became the only player in history to win three majors in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007).[95] It was the third consecutive season that Federer held the No. 1 ranking for all 52 weeks of the year.[96]\n\n2008: Illness, Olympic gold, and fifth US Open\n\nFederer's success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis, which he suffered during the first half of the year.[97] At the Australian Open Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals.[98] He lost twice in Masters finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg.[98] Federer captured three titles playing in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.[99][100][101] Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, the French Open and Wimbledon, which was regarded as the best match of tennis history by many, when he was going for six straight wins to break Björn Borg's record. He came back from two sets down to force a fifth set, where he fell just two points from the title.[98]\n\nAt the Olympic Games, Federer and Stan Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles by beating the Bryan brothers American team in the semifinals and the Swedish duo of Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final.[102] However, Federer could reach only the quarterfinals in the singles draw, bowing out to then No. 8 James Blake, thus ceding his No. 1 ranking to Nadal after being at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks.[103] Federer captured his only Grand Slam of 2008 at the US Open, defeating Andy Murray in the final.[104]\n\nAt the end of the year, Federer suffered a back injury, which caused him to withdraw from the Paris Masters and resulted in a poor showing at the year-end championship, where he was eliminated in the round-robin stage.[105] This marked the only time in his career that he was eliminated before the semifinals. Federer ended the year ranked No. 2.[106]\n\n2009: Career Grand Slam and major title record\n\nFederer began the 2009 season with a loss to Nadal in the final of the Australian Open in a hotly contested five-set match.[107] Federer struggled following the defeat in Melbourne and entered the clay season without a title.[108]\n\nFederer's season turned around in the final Masters event of the clay season when he defeated Nadal on clay for only the second time to capture the Madrid Masters.[109] After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer became the overwhelming favorite to win the elusive French Open. In his next match, he came from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets.[110] He also fought back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five-setter in the semifinals.[111] In the final, he defeated Söderling in straight sets to finally capture the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam.[112] This victory also tied him with Pete Sampras for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 14.[113]\n\nIn Wimbledon, Federer faced long-time rival Andy Roddick in the final in what was their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam. The final was historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in a record-setting fifth set, thus winning his 15th Grand Slam singles title and breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.[114][115] Federer continued his summer run by winning his third Cincinnati Masters, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[116] For the third consecutive year, Federer defeated Djokovic in the semifinals of the US Open. On the penultimate point, he hit what many consider to be the greatest shot of his career, a tweener winner, to set up match points.[117] Federer was defeated by del Potro in the final despite falling just two points from the title in the fourth set.[118]\n\nFederer finished the season as the year-end No. 1 for the fifth time in his career.[119]\n\n2010s\n\n2010: Fourth Australian Open\n\nFederer started the year with a win at the Australian Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final, extending the Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles and matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles.[120][121] Since 2005 Wimbledon, Federer had made 18 out of 19 finals in Grand Slam tournaments, a period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the Open Era. This tournament, however, marked the end of his dominance at the majors.[122]\n\nAt the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay.[123] However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open, losing to Söderling in the quarterfinals and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking, having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world No. 1.[124] In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the quarterfinals again to Tomáš Berdych and fell to No. 3 in the rankings for the first time in six years and eight months.[125][126]\n\nTowards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras's old coach, Paul Annacone, on a trial basis to put his tennis game and career back on track.[127] At the US Open, Federer reached the semifinals, where he lost a five-set match to Novak Djokovic after holding two match points.[128] Federer reached four Masters finals prevailing against Mardy Fish at Cincinnati.[129]\n\nFederer finished the year in strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss Indoors and the ATP Finals in London, beating Djokovic and Nadal in the finals of the latter two.[130][131] It remains the only tournament in his career in which Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four.[132] In 2010, Federer finished in the top two for the eighth consecutive season.[133]\n\n2011: Tour Finals title record\n\nThe year 2011 was a lean year for Federer, although great by most player's standards. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[134] At the French Open semifinals, Federer ended Djokovic's undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a four-set victory,[135] but he then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal.[136] At Wimbledon, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam match after winning the first two sets.[137]\n\nAt the US Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic in five sets after winning the first two sets for the second time in 2011. In a repeat of the previous year's semifinal event, Federer again squandered two match points, this time on his own serve. The loss meant that it was the first time since 2002 that Federer had not won any of the four Grand Slam titles.[138][139]\n\nFederer finished the season successfully in the indoor season, winning his last three tournaments of the year at the Swiss Indoors, Paris Masters and ATP Finals, forming a 16-match winning streak. Federer finished the year ranked No. 3.[140]\n\n2012: Wimbledon title, return to No. 1, and Olympic silver\n\nFederer began the 2012 season by reaching the semifinal of the Australian Open, which he lost to Nadal.[141] He then won the Rotterdam Open for the first time since 2005, defeating del Potro in the final.[142] In the Dubai Championships, he defeated Murray in the final.[143] Federer then won the Indian Wells Masters after defeating Nadal in the semifinals, and John Isner in the final.[144]\n\nFederer went on to compete at the Madrid Masters on the new blue clay surface, where he beat Tomáš Berdych in the final, thus regaining the No. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal.[145] In the French Open, Federer reached the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets, in a rematch of the previous year's semifinal.[146]\n\nAt Wimbledon, Federer played a five-set match in the third round against Julien Benneteau on his way to winning the tournament, defeating Djokovic in the semifinals and then Murray in a four-set final to win his seventh Wimbledon championship, tying Sampras' Open Era record.[147] With this victory, Federer returned to the top spot in the world rankings and, in doing so, broke Sampras' record of 286 weeks atop the list.[148] In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Federer defeated Del Potro in a 4-hour 26-minute semifinal by winning 19–17 in the third and final set.[149] Clearly exhausted from his clash with Del Potro, Federer then lost the final to Murray in a surprisingly lopsided match, thus winning a silver medal for his country.[150]\n\nIn August, Federer won the Cincinnati Masters, beating Djokovic in the final.[151] In the US Open, Federer was defeated by Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals.[152] At the Shanghai Masters, after defeating Wawrinka in the third round, Federer confirmed his 300th week at No. 1, thus becoming the first player to reach this milestone. Federer ended the season by reaching the final of the ATP Finals, where he lost to Djokovic.[153][154]\n\n2013: Injury struggles and fall in rankings\n\nFederer developed back injuries in March and July and his ranking dropped from No. 2 to No. 6.[155][156] Federer's first and only title of 2013 came at the Gerry Weber Open, defeating Mikhail Youzhny in the final. With the victory in Halle, he tied John McEnroe for the third-most ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era.[157] Federer, however, was unable to maintain his form into Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam tournament defeat since 2003 in the second round against Sergiy Stakhovsky. This loss ended Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive quarterfinals at Grand Slam tournaments,[158] and it also meant that he would drop out of the top 4 for the first time since July 2003.[159]\n\nAfter Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years.[160] Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it was a mistake to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.[161]\n\nOn 27 December 2013, Federer announced that Stefan Edberg was joining his team as co-coach with Severin Lüthi.[162]\n\n2014: Davis Cup glory\n\nAt the Australian Open, Federer defeated Tsonga and Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.[163] At the Dubai Championships, he defeated Djokovic in the semifinals and Berdych in the final to win his sixth Dubai crown.[164] Federer then reached the Indian Wells final, but lost to Djokovic in a final-set tiebreaker.[165] The emergence of countryman Stanislas Wawrinka as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie in the Davis Cup. Their commitment paid off as wins over Serbia, Kazakhstan (in which Federer won the first deciding rubber of his Davis Cup career), and Italy allowed the Swiss team to advance to the final for the first time since 1992.[166][167]\n\nDuring the clay season, Federer took a wild card into the Monte-Carlo Masters, defeating Djokovic on his way to the final, which he lost to Wawrinka.[168] At the Halle Open, Federer reached both the singles and the doubles finals, beating Alejandro Falla in the singles final.[169] At Wimbledon, Federer reached a record ninth final, but he was defeated by Djokovic in an epic five-set match.[170][171]\n\nFederer reached the final of the Canadian Open, where he was defeated by Tsonga.[172] Federer then defeated Spain's David Ferrer in three sets to capture his sixth Cincinnati crown.[173] He then reached the semifinals at the US Open but lost in straight sets to eventual champion Marin Čilić.[174]\n\nAt Shanghai Masters, Federer saved five match points against Leonardo Mayer in the second round before defeating Djokovic in the semifinals to end his 28-match unbeaten run on Chinese soil.[175] He then beat Gilles Simon to win his second Shanghai final.[176] The victory saw Federer return to the No. 2 ranking for the first time since May 2013. Federer then won the Swiss Indoors for a record sixth title, defeating David Goffin in the final.[177] Federer also reached the finals of the 2014 ATP Finals to face Djokovic again, but withdrew from the final because of another back injury.[178]\n\nDespite his injury, Federer finished the season on a high by defeating Richard Gasquet to clinch the Davis Cup for Switzerland for the first time in its history.[179] The final was held at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille, France, attracting over 27,000 spectators per match; this broke attendance record for the highest ever officially sanctioned competition tennis match.[180]\n\n2015: 1,000th victory and finals at the US Open and Wimbledon\n\nFederer started his 2016 season by winning the Brisbane International, defeating Milos Raonic in the final, thereby becoming only the third man in the Open Era to have 1,000 or more wins, joining Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl, as well as the first man in the Open Era to win at least one title in each of 15 consecutive years.[181] At the Dubai Championships, Federer successfully defended his title with a straight-set victory over Djokovic in the final.[182] He then reached the Indian Wells final, which he lost to defending champion Djokovic.[183]\n\nIn May, Federer won the inaugural Istanbul Open clay-court tournament, ending a title drought on red clay since the 2009 French Open.[184] He then reached the Italian Open final, but was unable to win his first title there, losing to Djokovic in the final.[185] In the French Open, he lost in the quarterfinals by the eventual champion Stan Wawrinka.[186] As the new expanded grass season began, Federer won his record eighth Gerry Weber Open and became only the third man in the Open Era to win a title eight times.[187] At Wimbledon, Federer defeated Murray in straight sets in the semifinals to advance to his tenth Wimbledon final, which he lost to Djokovic in four sets in a rematch of the previous year's final.[188]\n\nFederer defeated Murray and Djokovic in straight sets to win the Cincinnati Masters for the seventh time. This marked the first time that Federer defeated the top two players in the world at the same event.[189] At the US Open, he advanced to his first final there since 2009 without dropping a set, including a win over Stan Wawrinka in the semifinals.[190] In the final, he was once again beaten by top seed Djokovic in four sets.[191] Federer then won the Swiss Indoors, defeating Nadal in the final.[192]\n\nIn December, Federer announced that Stefan Edberg would be replaced by Croatian former world No. 3 player Ivan Ljubičić, with countryman Severin Lüthi remaining his head coach. Federer revealed that Edberg originally signed on to the coaching team for one season only in 2014 but agreed to stay on in 2015.[193]\n\n2016: Knee surgery, back injury, and long recovery hiatus\n\nFederer started his season in the Brisbane International as the defending champion. However, in a rematch of the previous year's final, he lost in the final to Milos Raonic in straight sets.[194] At the Australian Open, he lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets.[195] The day after his loss to Djokovic, Federer sustained a knee injury and in early February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee and missed the tournaments in Rotterdam, Dubai, and Indian Wells in February and March.[196] Due to a stomach virus, he had to withdraw from the Miami Open, thus prolonging his time on the sidelines.[197]\n\nFederer made his comeback at the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing in the quarterfinals to Tsonga in three sets.[198] He then participated in the Italian Open where he lost in the third round to Dominic Thiem. His withdrawal from the French Open broke a record run of 65 consecutive participations in the main draw of Grand Slam tournaments, stretching back to the 2000 Australian Open.[49][199]\n\nStill suffering from recurring knee pain during the grass season, he lost in the semifinals of Stuttgart and Halle.[200] In Wimbledon, Federer came back from two sets down to defeat Marin Čilić in the quarterfinals, equalling Jimmy Connors's all-time records of 11 Wimbledon semifinals and 84 match wins.[201] He then suffered his first defeat in a Wimbledon semifinal in a five-set loss to Raonic, re-injuring his knee in the fifth set.[202]\n\nOn 26 July, Federer announced that he would miss the Summer Olympics and the remainder of the 2016 season to recover fully from his knee injury.[203] The sudden withdrawal not only implied that 2016 would be Federer's first season since 2000 in which he failed to win a title, but it also meant that he would have to drop out of the top ten for the first time in fourteen years. This, combined with a grand slam drought spanning over four years, led to many analysts believing that his outstanding career was finally coming to an end and that he would never win any major titles again.[204][205]\n\n2017: Renaissance with Australian Open and Wimbledon titles\n\nFederer's 2017 season marked a return to Grand Slam wins since 2012, the most titles since 2007, and the highest win percentage since 2006. Statistically, this season was his best since 2007.[206][207]\n\nHis withdrawal from most of the 2016 season led his ranking to slip to No. 17 at the start of the season, his lowest in over fifteen years. At the Australian Open, Federer defeated top-10 players Tomáš Berdych and Kei Nishikori on his way to the semifinals, making Federer the oldest man to compete in a grand slam semifinal since Jimmy Connors in 1991.[208] There, he defeated Wawrinka in five sets, making him the oldest player to compete in a Grand Slam final since Ken Rosewall in 1974.[209][210] Coming back from a break down in the fifth set, Federer defeated Rafael Nadal to win his first major since 2012.[211] The final also marked Federer's 100th match at the Australian Open, and Federer's first-ever Grand Slam victory over Nadal outside of the grass courts.[212] With this victory, he also re-entered the top ten.[213]\n\nIn March, Federer won his 90th career title at Indian Wells, defeating Wawrinka in the final.[214] In Miami, Federer defeated Nadal in the final in straight sets and climbed to No. 4 in the ATP rankings. This marked the third time Federer had won the Sunshine Double.[215]\n\nDue to concerns about his longevity, Federer decided that he would skip the entire clay-court season.[216] He returned to the tour at Stuttgart, where he suffered a shock defeat to Tommy Haas in the second round despite holding match points, the lowest-ranked player (No. 302) to beat him since No. 407 Bjoern Phau in 1999.[217] He rebounded the following week by winning a record-extending ninth title at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, doing so without the loss of a set.[218] Federer then won Wimbledon without dropping a set, defeating Marin Čilić in the final to win a record-breaking eighth Wimbledon title and his record-extending 19th major title overall, becoming the oldest male player to win Wimbledon in the Open era.[219] Federer became the second man in the Open era to win Wimbledon without dropping a set after Björn Borg in 1976.[220]\n\nAt the opening of the summer hard court swing, Federer lost the final of the Canada Masters to Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match.[221] Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. However, Federer lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals at the US Open.[222]\n\nIn September, Federer represented Team Europe in the inaugural Laver Cup, a tournament that he had founded. Federer won both his singles matches against Sam Querrey and Nick Kyrgios, defeating the latter in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point) to seal the cup for Europe.[223] The tournament was also notable for Federer playing doubles with long-time rival Rafael Nadal for the first time, defeating the Team World duo of Querrey and Jack Sock.[224] With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.[225][226]\n\nAt the Shanghai Masters Federer captured his third Masters title of the season, defeating No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final. This was Federer's fifth straight victory over Nadal in their rivalry and his 94th career title, drawing him level with 2nd-placed Ivan Lendl.[227] Federer then defeated Juan Martín del Potro in the final of the Swiss Indoors to surpass Ivan Lendl in number of career titles.[228] Federer qualified for the 2017 ATP Finals, but was beaten by David Goffin in the semifinals in three sets.[229]\n\n2018: 20th major title and oldest No. 1\n\nFederer started his season by winning his second Hopman Cup title, this time partnering with Belinda Bencic, after having won previously in 2001 with Martina Hingis.[230] The Swiss team won all its ties and Federer won every match he played, defeating the German pair, Alexander Zverev and Angelique Kerber, in the final 2–1.[231] At the Australian Open, Federer reached the final without dropping a set, and successfully defended his title beating Marin Čilić in a five-set final. It was Federer's sixth title at the Australian Open, equaling the then record held by Roy Emerson and Novak Djokovic, which was surpassed by Djokovic in 2019. He also became the first man to win twenty Grand Slam titles. It was also the first time since the 2008 US Open that Federer successfully defended a major title.[232]\n\nIn mid-February, Federer defeated Grigor Dimitrov to win his third Rotterdam Open title and return to No. 1 in the ATP rankings.[233] At 36 years and 195 days of age, he became the oldest ATP world No. 1 by more than three years, a record that stood until Novak Djokovic broke the record in 2024. He also broke the ATP record for the longest span between two successive reigns at No. 1 at 5 years and 106 days.[234] In March, Federer entered the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated Chung Hyeon in the semifinals for a career-best start to a season at 17–0, beating his previous best start at 16–0 in 2006.[235] Despite holding three championship points, Federer was defeated by Juan Martín del Potro in a close three-set final. After a second-round exit to Thanasi Kokkinakis in Miami, Federer announced that he would miss the clay court season, including the French Open, for the second consecutive season, thus allowing Nadal to regain his No. 1 ranking.[236]\n\nIn June, Federer regained the No. 1 ranking at the Stuttgart Open, which he won after defeating Milos Raonic in the final.[237] However, he lost his No. 1 ranking for the last time in the following week when he failed to defend his Halle Open title, losing in the final to Borna Ćorić in three sets.[238] At Wimbledon, Federer was seeded first at a Grand Slam for the first time since the 2012 US Open, but he lost in the quarterfinals to Kevin Anderson in five sets, despite being two sets up and having a match point in the third.[239]\n\nFederer next played in Cincinnati, where he lost in the final to Novak Djokovic, who won a record Career Golden Masters.[240] The loss ended Federer's run of 100 consecutive service holds and 14-match winning streak in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Federer was upset by John Millman in the 4th round, citing extreme conditions of heat and humidity that took a toll on his body.[241] Federer then played at the Laver Cup where he successfully helped Team Europe defend their title, winning both his singles matches against Nick Kyrgios and John Isner.[242] He also paired up with Djokovic in doubles for the first time in his career, losing their match against Jack Sock and Kevin Anderson in three sets.[243]\n\nAt the Swiss Indoors in October, Federer defended his title with a straight-sets win over Marius Copil in the final, winning his 9th title at the event and his 99th career singles title.[244] At the Paris Masters, Federer lost in the semifinals to Djokovic. At the ATP Finals, Federer lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the semifinal.[245]\n\n2019: Record third Hopman Cup, 100th title, 1,200th match win and 12th Wimbledon final\n\nFederer opened his campaign by retaining the Hopman Cup alongside Belinda Bencic, becoming the first player to win the mixed-gender event three times.[246] They again defeated Zverev and Kerber of Germany in the final and won the final tie by a tiebreak in the decisive set (5–4).[247] At the Australian Open, Federer was upset by Stefanos Tsitsipas in four close sets. After the match, Federer announced he would play the clay court season for the first time since 2016.[248][249] At the Dubai Championships, Federer defeated Tsitsipas in straight sets in the final to win his 100th career singles title, thus becoming only the second man after Jimmy Connors to reach the three figure mark in the Open Era.[250] Federer then reached the finals of both Indian Wells, where he lost to Dominic Thiem, and Miami, where he defeated John Isner.[251][252]\n\nFederer played his first clay court tournament in three years at the Madrid Open, where after securing his 1200th career win in the third round against Gaël Monfils, he lost in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem, despite having two match points in the second set.[253] Federer played at the French Open for the first time in 4 years. In the quarterfinals, he avenged his loss to Wawrinka at the same stage of the tournament 4 years ago, but then lost in the semifinals to defending and 11-time champion Nadal.[254]\n\nFederer began his grass court season at the Halle Open where he won his tenth title at the event, defeating David Goffin in the final in straight sets. This marked the first time Federer had won a singles tournament ten times or more.[255] At Wimbledon, Federer defeated Nadal in their 40th and final professional meeting to reach his record 12th final at the tournament. This was also the first time Federer played Nadal at Wimbledon since the 2008 Wimbledon final, and at 37 years, 11 months and 6 days, Federer became the oldest man to reach a major final since Ken Rosewall in the 1974 US Open.[256][257] Federer then faced Djokovic in the final, against whom he lost in a five-set thriller lasting 4 hours and 57 minutes, despite having two championship points on serve in the fifth set. The match also marked the first time a fifth set tiebreaker was played at 12 games all and was the longest final in Wimbledon history.[258]\n\nFederer next played at the Cincinnati Masters and reached the third round where he lost in straight sets to Andrey Rublev. This was his quickest defeat in 16 years, taking just 62 minutes.[259] At the US Open, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to No. 78 Grigor Dimitrov in five sets.[260] At the Laver Cup in Geneva, Federer won singles matches against Kyrgios and Isner to help the European team capture their third consecutive title.[261] At the Shanghai Masters, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Alexander Zverev.[262] At the Swiss Indoors, Federer played the 1500th match of his career in the first round, beating Peter Gojowczyk in less than an hour.[263] In the final, he defeated Alex de Minaur in straight sets for a record-extending tenth Swiss Indoors title.[264] At the ATP Finals, Federer rebounded from a opening match loss to Dominic Thiem to defeat Matteo Berrettini and Djokovic (his first win over Djokovic since 2015) in straight sets to qualify for the semifinals.[265] He then lost the semifinal to Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.[266]\n\n2020s\n\n2020–2022: Final years\n\nFederer began his 2020 season at the Australian Open, where he reached the semifinals after saving seven match points in his five-set quarterfinal win over Tennys Sandgren.[267] Federer then lost his semifinal match to Djokovic in straight sets, having sustained a groin injury earlier in the tournament.[268] In February, Federer underwent arthroscopic surgery for a right knee injury and subsequently withdrew from the Dubai Championships, Indian Wells, Miami Open and the French Open to give time for his knee to recover for the grass season.[269] On 10 June, due to a setback from his initial rehabilitation from the knee injury, Federer announced that he had to have an additional arthroscopic procedure on his right knee, vowing to return in 2021. This was only the second year in Federer's career since he won his first title that he finished without a title.[270]\n\nIn January 2021, Federer withdrew from the Australian Open due to still recovering from knee surgery and strict COVID-19 quarantine measures in Australia.[271][272] On 8 March, Novak Djokovic surpassed him for the most career weeks spent as the ATP number 1 ranked player.[273] On 10 March, he made his return to the ATP Tour at the Qatar Open, where he won his first ATP match in 14 months against Dan Evans before losing to Nikoloz Basilashvili in the quarterfinals.[274] At the French Open, Federer withdrew from the tournament before his fourth-round match citing knee problems, giving a walkover to Matteo Berrettini.[275] In Halle, he lost in the second round to Félix Auger-Aliassime, with their 19-year age difference being the biggest in Federer's 1,521 career matches.[276][277]\n\nAt Wimbledon, the nearly 40-year-old Federer became the oldest Wimbledon quarterfinalist in the Open Era, breaking the record held by Ken Rosewall,[278] but he was then upset by 14th seed Hubert Hurkacz in straight sets. This was the first time in 19 years at Wimbledon he had lost in straight sets, and only the second time he had lost a set 6–0 in the 21st century (the previous occasion was against Nadal in the 2008 French Open final).[279][280] On 15 August, Federer announced that he underwent another knee surgery after a further injury during the grass-court season. He withdrew from the US Open, but he hoped to make a return to the tour in 2022.[281]"
