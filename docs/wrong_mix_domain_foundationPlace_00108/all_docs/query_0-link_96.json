        "text": "Author: Sophie Walker\n\nOur new project website is here!\n\nCurrently, it is only available in German. I will work on the translation asap.\n\nThis blog will not be updated anymore. Thank you for joining the ride!\n\nFinally, the time has come: Project CH+ is growing. This post is for the new faces of the +Team. A warm welcome to Donato, Mela, Emma and Florian. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nI am proud to announce that Project CH+ is part of the Prototype community! The Prototype Fund is an initiative of Opendata.ch and the Mercator Foundation Switzerland. They support projects which revolve around democratic participation and open source. I am excited to work with the new team in September, we’re ready to step up our game!\n\nAlright, off to Basel-Stadt! Last week I met with Nina Mathys, president of the canton’s Junge Rat, youth commissioner Rodrigo Krönkvist and David Fischer from the political association Discuss it. We thought about ways in which we could add a little more pizzazz to the coming elections. Let me tell you: there’s more to come!\n\nGlobal pandemic aside, what happened during the last weeks? I submitted my master’s thesis! The last months revolved around finishing the concluding research for the Uri elections despite the Corona crisis, and writing the master’s thesis for Project CH+. At the same time, I was able to find a motivated team which will start working on the next iteration of our electoral support in June. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nProject CH+ is now officially part of the research and business programme “First Ventures” by the Gebert Rüf Foundation. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nOn March 8, Uri is electing its new cantonal parliament as well as the governing council.\n\nThis week, the second research round for Project CH+ started with the trainees of Uri’s department of personnel and four school classes of the cantonal secondary school of Uri.\n\nUntil the elections, half of the participants will use the beta version of the app, while the other half is using an alternative offer for electoral support. Both groups are tasked to create their own list for the elections. After the elections, there will be an concluding survey, which allows to compare the two approaches.\n\nUntil the elections, the application will also be publicly available.\n\nCooperation. Transparency. User Empowerment.\n\nThese values are at the core of Project CH +\n\n2019 was filled with challenges, closing doors, unknown territory and – opportunities. I am thankful to be able to work on a project which is truly close to my heart. It was especially nice that I could end 2019 with an article in the Luzerner Zeitung.\n\nFor the last couple of weeks, it has been quiet on this blog. However, I was able to make good progress in important areas of the project. More information to come.\n\nSaletti 2020, are you ready?\n\nTime for some big news! After earning prize money at the Swiss Student Sustainability Challenge, I am working with the Swiss development studio OpinionGames. They will help turn my design into reality by realizing the technical backend for the next iteration of our project. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nWhat happened to our surveys?\n\nOn Thursday I was in Bern to share the first research insights with Carol Schafroth from the Campus for Democracy Michael Erne from smartvote. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nFor half a year, the FHNW gave me access to mentorings and coachings. Yesterday, the award ceremony took place in Basel.

In an interactive parcours, students playfully get into contact with various topics in the area of sustainability. This year, I joined the event to sit together with young people and discuss the future of politics, democracy and games. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nIn one week it will be over (almost)! After nearly 500 people participated in the first two surveys, this three-part online research is coming to an end.\n\nUntil November 3, you are most welcome to participate! This final survey is about your perception of the parliamentary elections 2019 and your wishes for digitally available information during future elections.\n\nAt this point already a big thank you to everyone who participated!\n\nI will evaluate the collected answers and revise the design of the current app prototype accordingly.\n\nThe elections have passed but our project continues – with good news: Project CH+ is among the winners of the Swiss Student Sustainability Challenge by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Northwestern Switzerland!\n\nDuring the award ceremony on November 28, we will find out which spot our playful approach has earned us.\n\nThe elections are around the corner and I am in den living room of the former member of the Council of States, Markus Stadler.\n\nThis interview revolves around politics, being without a party, elections, the young generation and Marcus’ evaluation of Project CH+’s entertainment approach.\n\nThe 10 minute video interview is the result of a one hour conversation. Maybe I will find time in the future to elaborate on the interview and the thoughts behind it. Until then, enjoy!\n\nYay! More than 400 people were part of the first survey!\n\nThis second questionnaire on the parliamentary elections is online until October 20. It’s all about features that you would like to have and that would help you select suitable political candidates to reflect your interests.\n\nLast Thursday I paid a visit to the Republik magazine. The reason: Someone has had the same idea as me. After the meeting we can say: Two “super-likes” & “it’s a Match”! Together with the Head of IT Thomas Preusse, Software Engineer Patrick Venetz and my Mentor René Bauer we talked about the process, the similarities and the differences of our concepts.\n\nIn any case, I am happy that the combination of games and political communication is well received by the public.\n\nContinue reading\n\nIt’s happening! Today we are starting with the online surveys. This first questionnaire will be online for one week, the second one will follow in the beginning of October.\n\nEDIT 15. September: Wow, more than 300 replies! The duration of the first survey is extended. It will be online until September 22.\n\nWhy the voter participation in Switzerland is relatively low when compared to our international neighbours, has been researched by various institutions. The fact: in 1971, 56.9% of eligible voters participated, during our last elections this number was at 48.5%.\n\nThe research which is part of Project CH+ does not aim to explain these circumstances, but to find new approaches to address the issue. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nIn various settings – from a park bench next to the Limmat, to a student kitchen in Lausanne – I collected first responses to our application. The five test sessions took 15-30 minutes each. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nNow, your opinion takes center stage. In this blog entry you’ll find information on the coming research.

But that hairdo looks weird. …\n\nContinue reading\n\nWelcome to the project blog of CH+.\n\nFor five years I have been involved with “Serious Games”; games that are entertaining and educational at the same time. The fields of application are nearly unlimited!\n\nMore about me and my portfolio can be found here, but let’s stay on topic for now:\n\nWhy this project?\n\nWhile conducting graduation research for my bachelor’s thesis, I was intrigued by the fact that there are thousands of articles on how to use behavioural models or psychological cues to motivate users – to consume. Look at this, buy that, you need this, treat yourself with that. Every day, we encounter these well-designed “manipulations”. And we love it, because successful design often guarantees good user experience.\n\nIn this context, entertainment media is getting more sophisticated too. As a designer, it concerns me to see how willingly people accept new technologies without questioning them. I fear that the divide between designers and consumers will continue to grow, not least thanks to algorithms and artificial intelligence. It keeps on getting easier for us designers to create custom experiences, to prepare and to filter content. The more money we have, the easier it becomes.\n\nThis is why it is necessary that we use these techniques of influence to encourage people to act on their own behalf. Because the methods are being used."
