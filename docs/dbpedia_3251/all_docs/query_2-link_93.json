        "text": "“They assured me they will both be fit in January,” Erik ten Hag said of Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia when asked why Sergio Reguilon’s season-long loan was ended early.\n\nTen Hag may have felt aggrieved after being left with egg on his face. Although Shaw had returned for a few weeks in February, he soon pulled up with an injury that ultimately ended his club season. United fans can be forgiven for forgetting that Malacia is still an option.\n\nDespite being at the club for more than two years, the return of the defender will feel like a new signing. The 24-year-old is under pressure to perform when he does come back.\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United not changing transfer plans over Leny Yoro and Rasmus Hojlund injuries\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United issue major Tyrell Malacia injury update\n\nThe Dutchman has just two years left on his deal with a sale next summer not out of the question under Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-minding regime. The full-back has suffered devastating setbacks since his knee surgery last summer.\n\nIt means he has yet to take to the field in more than a year, and a new update on his condition has confirmed he won’t do so before October. That timeframe is not unexpected given the fact he was left back at Carrington as United jetted off for their pre-season tour of the USA.\n\nUnited’s left-back options may have given Ten Hag a few headaches last term with Malacia out of action and Shaw limited to just 15 games due to three separate setbacks. United had to find a deputy to step in once Reguilon returned to Tottenham and then loaned to Brentford.\n\nDiogo Dalot did a credible job in the role in the end but he is far from an ideal option. In an age where wingers prefer to play on the opposite flank to their strongest foot, the same cannot be said of full-backs.\n\nDalot’s right-footed nature became unstuck at times, although he can hardly be blamed. He looked less out of water than Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Victor Lindelof, not that this is a reason to label him back-up to Shaw for the first portion of the season.\n\nUnited are targeting Noussair Mazraoui with Wan-Bissaka being strongly linked with West Ham. Dalot is still expected to be first choice right-back but will be justified in feeling like the fall guy if played on the left amid a Shaw injury.\n\nUltimately, Ten Hag cannot repeat the same mistake as last season and not have ample cover for Malacia, even if he is indeed only out for around two months of the season. So delicate is Malacia’s recovery, it seems, that this timeframe cannot be relied upon, despite the good-faith efforts of all involved.\n\nAnother realistic loanee - perhaps even a return for Reguilon - should not be ruled out amid the clamour for reinforcement in other areas this summer. With left-footed, left-sided centre-back Lisandro Martinez additionally out for swathes of games last season, United fans know the risks attached with having an imbalanced defence."
