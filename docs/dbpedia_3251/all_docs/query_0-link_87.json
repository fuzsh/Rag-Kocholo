I have worked both Saturday and Sunday. What a bloody damn stinky job this is. I have been totally wrecked. Worn out. I have been off since yesterday morning but was nothing even close to workable yesterday. So I have slept for 13 hours today and that is so not me. Should I get 5 hours daily I am on the good side of general sleeping hours. but 13 today. Holy hell. I feel like I have been on an out all nighter for 48 hours straight. But a morning shower and a quick trip to the post office this noon gave me fresh air and that did me some good at least. I am trying to give some things a chance here and trying to let myself be as calm as I can with things that are not right now possible to act on. Even though I want it badly. never mind what it is right now course ...as said I can nto do jack about it right now.\n\nI as everyone else is closing in on mid December. The days this month is lying by an it is a nice feeling really some how. I am pleased to see time pass by fast right now. I want to be round April 2010 myself. By that time I have so much more control of things and doings and the new year will by then also most likely have been unfolding its doings and future lines will be drawn in the sand I guess. There are so many things I like to say will go well and it looks like they will right now. but I am taking things one at a time. I am taking things the best possible way I can possibly do it.\n\nThere have been a coverage of some really neat Crue collectibles again this month. Decemer 2009 has given me a guarentee that I will now get the Vince Neil theatre of pain gloves, a complete tour used Dr Feelgood 1989 show of drumheads from Tommy Lee. An extremely over the top rare \"58\" CD from Sixx side project back in time. He did a good 100 personal pressed ones before the album actually got officially released for family and friends and one of these 100 is now safe and ready for getting added to this private collection really. Also coming are some poems handwritten by Sixx to some extremely close people in his life. I will keep these names to myself. Point is I am getting them. and I am proud to say so. And more. More is coming.\n\nThere wil be some stuff added to the diverse sections here probably tomorrow. Watch as always for the top rolling news line on the front page of the site to get a hint to the sections touched when it comes to updates my freinds. Thanks as always for looking. Also keep an eye out for the new 2010 site. We hope to be able to feed you with some really cool items for fans to get their hands on. Have you seen the Crue beers? They are all on the \"this n that pages\" Fve so far is out number six is around the corner. It is so awsome. I think these are just great. Looks cool as stading side by side on your desk or where ever really. All are gone and all are so not possible to find already. We are atlking about doing an exclusive poster, DVD and a shirt. How ever these things are requiring time and finance. I do not have any of it at the moment. I think and I hope we wil get to it though. Things are so awsome of what we ahve taled about here so I will do my best to get it all done. A couple more 2009 postings will come but then its time to kiss this year goodbye and say hello to yet another.\n\nWent to see Ace Frehley in Malmoe southern Sweden last week. It was good. It was a classic setlist of so much cool stuff The man is no front man and it shows easerly. How ever it was nostalgic and it was a cool evening. I loved it. next now for me is new years eve in Copenhagen. A new years eve show with the swedish Crashdiet. Me, my girl, my brother (obviously as this is the band he collects) and a few friends are all going. Its going to be fun.\n\nThere are some stuff I hope to say I OWN IT by the end of March too. I really want these and if its gonna cost me live shows so be it. These items are heavy somethings that are not to be gained when ever one feel for it. Yes a lot of shit is going on but then again is it not like this all the time? I should say so. I like to get more constantly I like to also get new testings to my name and right off now there are a few and I am all over them. I like to get some cleared agan soon. November and Decemer first were both good times when it comes to clearing things here and there. January February and March will be the same. I\n\nam really happ about how things are right now well part from that working situation. Thats a solid self written issue to be bitchin about lie all the time. But I dont. I have this still continued positive line of positive thinking. Not letting bad control my awaken life and I am doing a fairly good job here on that. I wanna take time out to sme peopple here and say hello Mattias, Pernille, Inge, Peter, Annika, Mario, and others. I wanna say I am sorry for being so lame at geting in touch. I am so over done tired and have been for a little too long. I have had focus on so many things and so many doings but it is getting better now and I promise things will be better. As long as you can give me the benefit of my troubled times lol. lol. lol.\n\nlove you all guys\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n***************************************************\n\n1st Of Decemberr 2009, Rockin Chick, Clearence & Good Times\n\n5:07PM CET\n\n***************************************************\n\nHey my dear friends. This it is The last posting this month I guess. As I may be a little too busy the next few days. Any chance you all are okay out there? It is closing in the time of year. The holidays, christmas and all. I am ass tired here have done nothing but tried to cope with the new changes at work and more. Nothing is even close to cool on that front and it has all resulted in me getting extremely tired and over the top cooked for a while. I am not gonna have much energy for work the rest of the year. The remains being the coming 5 weeks I have now gotten my time scedual and it is without saying not the nicest scedual around. But okay I will be good for some xtra doings in January and February. If nothing else then that pleases me. And I will enjoy it more than any words cna even come close to explain. I Will have a good 2010 I think. I have some sorted and some stuff on the to do list is only growing. I tell you my dear loyal Crue followers I have a good thing going right now. But I can so easerly in times like these get burned and loose a lot.\n\nA good few things in the early days of December will be seeing more new added stuff. I will try to get it done asap. You should not worry bout that. Watch for new stuff in a load of sections. There are so many things to be thought through in my life that I need to have some things looked in at to be able to say Im on top of all as is. But it is all good. It is all very good indeed. My baby is rocking in the studio and is all alive and well. Happy as a hoppin rabbit.Wanna check out her band its End My Sorrow on the myspace.com page. Its a way darker band than our own beloved Crue boys are delivering. Reocrding their debut album in Horsens Denmark right now. I am only happy to soon see her again. Have not seen her in a while but happy that she is now doing what she wanted to do for years. I have a few good ideas how this will turn out but I will spare you all thoughts as this is not an \"end my sorrow\" fan page but a Motley one through and through. Some stuff has been covered this December first already and more is to be giving me a fairly fine feelingbefore we head into the last month seriously.\n\nI have the next 5 months set up really seriously when it comes to plans and stuff for me to get coveered cleared and hopefully be happy about. I dont really have anything else to be focusing on. but thats just over the top fine. I want this one this plan to be set in stone with good results. Really. There are a few other future things planned and put in the calender. KISS ticket for Denmark is covered and in hand. I have new years covered and I am not working lol. I am going to be at the new year rock show with my bro and other friends seeing Crashdiet for the first time. I will be looking forward to this and other stuff, small time stuff that cna just be considered happyness in small portions to the bigger picture. It is going to be great. I am still on a ppositive landslide and I will do all in my power to stay on it and expand that and my crue site collection and other private sides to my name.\n\nThis Friday it is the space man Ace Frehley to entertain me live. I am really looking forward to that big time. I love that man, the songs, the old memos that pups up in my skull from the old days of collecting KISS rather massively. No collection did I see or have I seen with my own eyes that matches what I had. I know its out there and plenty of them. But shit I had about twice the load that I have on Crue back then. And now it is just over and done with. but the band and the music lives on froever inside of me. Ones a KISS freak ...it never fully leaves you. So many things that are to be and so many things that can be what you dream of. ut a fight and a damn serious one is highly needed to lat thoughts and dreams come to life. You know what I am talking about. nothing that is so highly rated in ones living time of excistence will ever come easy to anyone. So Friday holds Mr. Space Ace and I am willing to stand in line for that club gig for hours if needed. I really be able to see this show live. And actually SEE something. The place he plays in is floor only and all packed always so its a really shitty place to see shows if you arent in the front or something. I love to see the Friday come a little faster....\n\nI guess the European tour announcement for a possible Crue March of Europe is also around the corner really. So again money is needed for that too. I am not gonna go see a ton of shows this time. I am killing situations as mentioned above and I will be happy to have just seen it an covered the merch line to come. Well folks, friends and foes I will be leaving you on thiss the first day in December to cover myself with rest and dinner before the second last night shift crawls in. I am torn to pieces here and I am so close to a massive breakdown. My body is over worked and I am not cabable to do more for a while. I will need to see a doctor too in a few days course this is more than a tragic little pain. It is killing me and I hardly can walk. Rock it away... later dear friends.....and others ***\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n***************************************************\n\n23rd Of November 2009, More Changes, Addings & RNR News\n\n2:06PM CET\n\n***************************************************\n\nMonday after noon it is. Thanks Don for the excellent news. I am stunned. KISS have announced a new European tour backed up by their in my opinion totally most cool new album in a lifetime. \"Sonic boom\" hits Europe summer 2010. Holy mother ohh lord am I going?!!

LOVING IT.\n\nFrom May 7th till June 27th KISS rules Europe. Ending at blowing up the mid European festivals that I attended last year. Eve one show in Denmark. Have to go. Getting a chance to hear these 2009 new songs is a dream for me personally. I love the new KISS album. I am a huge Sonic Boom fan. No question. I am really thrilled about this one.

I have fought as hard as I possibly could this year. So to actually give myself the rest the clam and the low set actions will be a pleasure. besides I have stuff with my girl to work on as well so its all good. Not just helping her getting some W.A.S.P. collectibles. I need to have some things sorted and I need to have a relaxed inner self to do it from. I guess I should have given myself this many many months ago. but I finally can do it now and its all a great feeling. Honestly. A big thank yo uto my brother too for getting me the personal anniversary DVD recording of my 100th show on the Crue boys. Filmed in KB Hallen Denmark june 2009. This is a night to remember and it is with great apprecition that he today told me he had found bought and paid it. sadly it is not too easy to find the European full taped shows but this one especially obviously course its my personal anniversary show is too cool.\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n*********************************************\n\n4th Of November 2009, WASP Over, CRUE Doings Born\n\n11:54PM CET\n\n*********************************************\n\nWednesday noon, all got a very bad start here today and right now I feel stoned. I am so fucking worn down its almost killng me here.Let me explain a bit so you dont have to sit and wonder like \"what the hell is he up to now?\". You see yesterday I went to Malmoe, Sweden for a W.A.S.P. show with someone and it all started fairly okay a little train time delay but it was okay. Got there in time and all. It was all good. The show itself was okay. It actually burned the KB Club and it was packed to the max. I think all in all it was going well. And the only negative thing I can say about it is - I miss the glory days of that band. but that is not to see the light of day again so. Nothing to be done there anymore. Its a club band now a days and I think he enjoys that as is. Good songs good guy good sounding and all but me ...I missthe glory.\n\nAfter the show we heaeded to the train station to get a train crossing the water back to Denmak. Here all started go apeshit. It was close to midnight the trians info board said it would go round midnight but no. It all of a sudden changed into a 12:23AM departure time. Coming to Copenhagen at a time where we had to sit out doors waiting for 70 minutes for a 2AM traion out of Copenhagen to go to Roskilde. It came and we got on. It rolled off and all of a sudden we noticed FUCK the train headed towards the airport ... a total different direction that what we needed it to be. so we ended there in the international airport stuck for yet another hor then the next train tok us back to Copenhagen central and here we found out NO MORE NIGHT trians till 5AM. I just thought all my night rest and plans for the night just got flushed out the toilet. It was storming and ass cold too. We staretd feeling really terrible but the decition about getting some heat took me to a thought of just going to my work for a cup of coffee or something while waiting. So we did. But the evening the night and the early morning and al lgave me a serious kick in the balls and I now sit here 12:19PM again and still on a cross country train feeling ill. Feeling like hell. Shit I have an apointment for heading up to the north of Denmark to my webmaster in the afternoon. I think I am about as trashed as gets right now.\n\nNow A few things are going to be done and given life in form of a huge massive sick long ass high amount deal on shots / photos that are going to blow my own mind. I feel for a nasty roll inthe hay if you know what I am saying? I had a good chance last night but nothing happend. Man I gotta get laid soon again. The mind picking thoughts are totally fucking with me on a dirty level. I can not believe the shit I feel for. I am not sure half of it is legal. Oh well fuck it. Sonner or later...... right now it is Wednesday and I have other think to attend to. My brother and I are each having these fansites but both it on each of our fave bands seem to have a fairly good feedback and loyal returning gang that comes visit. We have talked about making some stuff lanyards shirts and shit. In dedication to the sites and our work to praise our music heroes. What ya think? Could be cool? Yeah maybe if you do it the right way and not thought about shit that would actually kill a daring thought and more. I think fans are highly creative persons and that I love. Its cool to have fans doing things to show their passion for the artists. So this is what we have talked about getting done.\n\nThere are a few things that are highly thought of. these photo lots are not ex number of sets containing 24 a set this is a fucked up massive load of 8x10s ... in the number of 2500. Yes you read it right. And therefor its an ass pile of one dollar bills that are not to be made fun about. This, if goin rightfully wil lbe the next long time project of this nutcake. I wil lknow in 24 hours if it indeed will go down this way. -Okay correcting info, already now I know the webmaster ...sitting together is pushed til lthe 10th. It is perhaos a good thing the way I feel tonight too. man the past 24 hours has almost killed me. I will be thinking about a load of things for the next week or so. have a good long line of things on a notepad to make decitions about. So no I am not bored one bit. There is no time in my life for kind of luxury lol.\n\nLoving the latest of my own ideas really and projects I have already started on. But it is a really learning process from birth to ashes a never ending path that you can never ever be too old to go down by. It is a hell of a ride. The Crue on covers most of mine. There seems to be Motley dust dropped all over what ever I do no matter where I go. Be good out there - and watch for the new and latest always on the colletors edition of loyalty to the band we all look up to. Motley rules. Long live the Crue. ***\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n********************************************************\n\n30th Of October 2009, Xmas beers, Crue Actions & Auction Temptations\n\n1:56PM CET\n\n********************************************************\n\nFriday the 30th. Fuck what a nivce thing to have October to be long fucking gone. It has been a rough month to be honest and November is goin to be its brother. Same roughness in tight financees and shit. But again some cool nice thought and killed issues are to be facts. So I am all pleased. I think today, tonight is going to be the first day in hell. For a month. It is tonight one minite to nine PM the release of this years Tuborg chÂ´ristmas beer. And trust me here in Denmark thats a huge thing. People go ape shit every god damn year from that. So tonight its BEER day its payday for most and its the first weekend in the new month of Novemvber nice mix. Fuck man ... poor public cleaners and service staff in various doings. Its a living hell to constantly have that shit running in a clean form this time a year here. My god.\n\nI have a few things I am going to focus on here and it is with great pride that I can say this time too my situation is being bettered. Another bite of the cake that stears this dudes passion in living is being taken care off and I there for have a line of great things that are to be cleared and handled with a smile. I think a lot of thinsg are still to be taken care off but here is a thing that i really wnat ot get done and I need to have things killed too to make a ood fresh start for the new year for myself. I am piece by piece getting there yes. The thing thats hard to deal with are the many cool offers coming in in a flow. I am tryong to get a few photo loads in place. They are massively huge really. I like to get these but the fuck its a load of money and shit. Well photos is one thing the single heavy pieces is another and they cost a little more than an arm and a leg. Like the latest offer this Mick guitar\n\nOriginal First Ever Signed Contract. This is an original 1981 Management Contract with Coffman & Coffman Signed April 8, 1981. This comes with a Hilton Matchbook with the words: \"Contract 4-8-81 at Beverly Hilton\" as a reminder to them to when and where. Also on the bakc of one of the pages. Vince Neil practices his signature his stage name a few times. This is unbelievable Rock n Roll History of Motley Crue A ONE OF A KIND ITEM. This item is signed by with their Original Names Barbara Coffman - Manager Allan Coffman - Manager Nikki Sixx - Artist Robert Deal aka Mick Mars Tommy Bass - Tommy Lee Vince Wharton - Vince Neil.\n\nSo there are so many things availbale for the right bucks. Also stuff tah tI would say are amongst the best pieces if you should have them as your own stuff.\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n**************************************\n\n18th Of October 2009, Reboxed & Documented\n\n3:25PM CET\n\n**************************************\n\nSunday again. Fuck me is time moving fast. Its still good times for me and strictly positive thinking. It is so nice to have reached this point. It isa nice focus on the future really. I have to say also that I am not too keen on not letting things take a turn. It is actually needed. So yes all is fine. unusual but adjustble so - nice. I have had a few days off now to focus on stuff at my home. And boxes and more boxes have been looked in on. Nothing is left untouched in the boxes that have actually been opened. You see from being home so very little as I am I always only come to my house throw the latest arrivals inside to have it at home and then every now and then I go bezerk and put it all in place ... that is what has been going on for me the last two days here now. A lot of smaller stuff has been sorted and is now all placed in its catagory - safely. All shirts have been bag packed indicivually. All tickets and passes etc etc have been reorganized to be in chronological order again.\n\nAll in all it has been a very good time at home really. And all that was arriving near by Copenhagen has been brought home too and is now placed in this home finally. yeah thee have been a lot to be honest. A big job a huge sorting but its done. Some areas at least. This also meant that a good few pieces have been dug out from the corners the boxes and more and been photographed and scanned for the site adding. So enjoy the latets new stuff and the stuff to come in the next couple of days. There will be a lot of creative doings here at home the rest of the year but I am not going to do much talking about it in on here. not too much fun to ead about really. How ever it will give me a solidly good cool feeling inside to get it done.\n\nTomorrow is last day off and it brings me to te home city of Hans Christian Andersen for another W.A.S.P. concert. Odense is the city and to join my sweetie pie there I am going. Then it is back to Roskidle / Copenhagen for some days work and then do a good couple of weeks more and W.A.S.P. again in Southern Sweden Malmoe start Nov. And Ace frehley same place December 4th. After that a lot abotu the period of January - April should by then be in place really. I know it sounds nuts but thats what I hope for. I am looking still for some heavy buys on things like Mick Mars` GGG leather pants. Neils T O P gloves. Along side more collectibles. And in between tryig to cover all the official new itms to come and that I am still missing from 2009 and hopefully fill in a few holes from the old days along the ride. It is obviously ahuge financial something as you can probably imagine right? Yeah it is somehing that requires a hell of an investment. But with the good few things left in stored American places it is a good nice feeling and a huge belief that things can actually be functional. And I have to admit I like to have all this stuff cleared. Several storage places have been killed and it is so close now. It feels really good.\n\nThe danish Rock Motley beers are up at number 5. The next is the Dr `89 one to come. If interested there is only single bottles to be found and owned added to yoru collection. There simply is not a chance to get a full case at all. I willo have all four listed on here the coming week not to worry. Look for the next diary posting and it will be thrown in here if you are looking ofr these bottles. A before a line of people buzz me for these let it be said right now. I can not get you all one each. I may be able to find you a good ten bottels all together as it is right now but no more. And rememebr shipping is not the cheapest shit to deal eith eather these days.\n\nSeems like the much hoped for and talked cruefest on danish ground is for god knows what time put on stand by really. No one seems to be able to throw in a serious something for a pre working to organize this thing. Ohh well - it was also just an idea and a hope on my part to get such a thing sat up. Well in the next coming future perhaps...be good.\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n****************************************\n\n15th Of October 2009, Planting Cool Stuff - & You?\n\n1:19PM CET\n\n****************************************\n\nOh brother this is going ot be a long day. I am in fine good mood just worried that I will be dead ass tired tonight. Right now sitting with the webmaster after only 2 hours sleep after a night shift and a returning home this morning 6AM. I am booked to my neck in stuff the next four to five days. It is going to be a seriously long long couple of days these next two. Then I have a good couple of days with a loved one and it is by far needed more than I can even describe. I need to get laid. Thats my story. I need to get a serious fuck that will leave me speachless for a few hours. How about it? lol, alright then... well as said right now sitting with the webmaster and we are planting new shit online. There are some seriously cool things gettng added today. We are hoping for a Snday or Monday return for more to add. Time will tell. A little tied up on time right now.\n\nAlso set is now a rock solid something that will be my main man near the San Frnacisco bay area. he will be shipping out some serious cool collectibles in end October some November and a self given cool beyind cool December gift. As a final goodbye to 2009 for myself a year in litterally speaking hard times. it is going to be a fantastic ending of this year no question about it. The life of mine and the Crue collecting thing are both gonna be well felt and and appreciated as the year rings out. I can not really tell yet whats to come as always things can go wrong. But I am so damn focused on this so it really should not. I just need to hang on in there for yet another good 12 weeks. I think I can do that.\n\nCrued love life!! Tommy Lee has a new hobby. BLONDE? Check. Skinny? Check. Likes stripping? Check. Must be TOMMY LEE's new love interest. Here's the Italian beauty hoping to fill PAMELA ANDERSON's boots in the MOTLEY CRUE wildman's life. CHIARA SALVADE says she's been dating the drummer for \"several months\". They first met three years ago when Tommy added her to his list of followers on MySpace. She told The Sun: \"Tommy Lee has always been my idol, a real sex symbol according with my tastes and I really couldn't believe that I was just talking to him when he added me as a friend. \"He told me he was impressed by the photograph I had on my profile and wanted to get to know each other. \"He asked where I was from and what my occupation was.\" Their relationship soon gathered pace thanks to some online chat.\n\nChiara added: \"We started to meet by webcam day and night, we stayed entire hours chatting and watching each other, until all this was not enough. We had to meet each other in the real life. \"So we decided to meet up in Milan and we did it several times. \"He took me on tour with his rock band and he also asked me to marry me. We meet each other every day he comes in Italy.\" They were snapped together earlier this week in Italy, inset, although Tommy's reps claim they're just \"good friends\". The sticksman's marriage to ex-Baywatch star Pammi was one of the most volatile in Hollywood. They married in 1995 a month after they first met and famously had a sex taped leaked online. Divorce followed in1998 after the couple had two sons but they reunited briefly 10 years later. We don't think Chiara will mind the baggage...\n\nSo having just passed Tbone 47th birthday and awaiting Nikkis 51st on December 11th. Not much else news has slipped from the Hollywood hills about much new. On the other hand there are so many things already awaited. The November \"greatest\" album, the news bomb on tour cd and more end of October in the sat UK campagin. let us see what what the last couple of months then will fill us up with. There is the \"greatest hits\" coming everybody is doing that. now I long for something new and refreshing when we speak of closing in on holiday ideas and christmas. I would be - I guess - somewhat dissapointed if this best of release stunt is all the band can come up with. Seems like a ton of people is sharing that one same feeling .That album is a seriously not really wanted something. We have had enough of it already. Give us something really new and refreshing.... not to compare but look at the KISS machine. They come up with new stuff constantly. How abotu a Motley collectors card serie or series? It would be killer. KISS also did these huge comic series and made it a whole marketing and merch line. Some of that stuff is actually really cool.\n\nNow I will end this posting for the day here and just say - enjoy the updates. Hopefully we can get more in round end of weekend but we will see. Nothing here is final. Sorry to admit it. But it is.There will come more MUCH more also heading into 2010. Not to worry. I still try to be loyal and covering - as said for a good year or so mÂ´now it has become really hard. And now its like extremely almost out of reach. Takes so much money you have no idea. Man this is a sick doing for having a life this short. But I live it my frineds. I live it to the most possible max. Love ya out there. Be careful. Till next time - a CRUEcial love is spread and kept alive - to you all from McrueLoyalty ****\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n*************************************************\n\n13th Of October 2009, New Gained Blood, Belief & Happiness\n\n10:07AM CET\n\n*************************************************\n\nBefore I get off here in my probably long posting today I wanna say happy birthday to my friend my Loyalty brother Mario. He had his day yesterday and I guess I was juts a little too busy to really catch up so - happy birthday bro.\n\nTuesday. Yes indeed. And what a splended morning this is. My Crue thoughts are running wild. My ideas are pouring out of me. There are so many great things right now that should and could be worked on worked with and made into something over the top nice. So why this mountain of greats all of a sudden? I tell you why. I have had my hands in so many things so many hopes have now seen the light of day and are now making me stand in a new situation where things seem a little more positive. As I posted in here a couple of months ago. I saw a good time coming and that stuck with me. i am more positive than I have ever been in my life. I have changed now working from a theory that is truely way more remarkable than anything I have ever witnessed before in my life. I am truely stunned about how well this works. It is quiet simply amazing. I have been watching people around me and they all live by what I did. Its all a world full of people having more or less enough in themselves and .. ohh dear I am not gonna go there it is a way too long story and not really to do with Motley at all. Still I post it here briefly to make a point. That being that I now live under a sky of better, nicer, more balanced, cooler, the list is long. And all in all I live from this now and it gives me way more pleasure in everything.\n\nAlso what has gotten me in high gear and a good mood is that so much has been killed and brought home. I have not much left from what used to be stored in America now. I have killed an ocean of stuff and today its good. Yesterday and 4 days ago came two huge bunches and it feels so fucking nice. My guitars, my smashed basses, my bigger part of the Crue`s personal used stuff all now is here. After a lot of shipments it is so nice to finally sit down and just breath out. It is just pure theraphy. I have gotten so much killed and after more than 5 to 6000 dollars in shipping fees alone plus import taxes to come after that things are finally here at home. And it will be a pleasure to get it all sorted out slowly box by box. I think a lot is to be looked through with myself going wow thats right damn I had forgotten all about that one. And that one and .... it will be christmas the days that the boxes gets opened. The Nikki Sixx swine album cover suite is here Vince`s chaps from the Girls album cover is here and much much much more. Some stuff were taken shots of a long time ago in America so is already on the site. But a lot of stuff also are not photographed or scanned just yet so there will come stuff here and there bit by bit in the next coming month I would say. Thursday will see some of it. And there will also as mentioned before come some things that has to do with the new and latest so far not tried ideas for the site.\n\nThe new KISS and the new W.A.S.P. CDs are both here now. And I have to also admit the new KISS and the present line up disc with the new recorded classics are spinning in my Ipod all the time now. I have fallen back. The masked warriors are back with a release that is so beyond what I could have ever hoped for. It sounds so beyond good. Especially the Simmons songs its so refreshing 70s feel to them I think. The demon winged bat has returned with a force that to me is mind blowing. I love this disc. if there ever was a \"sonic\" in the BOOM this is it for sure. I long now to see them again. If they only would do what no band ever seems to do. Play a good 5 or 6 songs from a latest release. I would have loved it more than I can even put words to.\n\nW.A.S.P. is coming to Odense in Denmark on Monday and then Malmoe a good couple of weeks later and I will go to both. That is something I had kind of promised myself not to do again. I do not like this band live no more. How ever the new disc is great. It is up in the top litsted band faves. So with that maybe I am hopeful for another return of the kick in the butt experience? And besides I will be going with a very close someone to me so ...... But the KISS one is beyond what was hoped for. Thank you for the release of a ....well..... good two decades of more really. The best in years and years. And a praised god relief to hear the original catman is back okay. After lounge cancer last year he is now fine again. That is something I also begin to think about. The boys in my heroic bands they are at an age now where anything can happen really. KISS, Crue anyone. So I look at things in a new light and appreciates it in a different kind of perspective now a days. But hey Mr. Peter Criss good to have you back. I have always been a hero world emotional individual more than family and more. Dont know why but it makes my heart bleed when shit happens.\n\nSpeaking of releases. The Crue boys have this \"greatest Hits\" coming in November. And I am not a fan of the shout board on their official site. people are so high about them selves and it is a constant chopping down to sizes amongst the people that live from being in on there really. I am not that kind of guy. But from what I have seen about the coming release of comments to it on there and other places a lot of people share my thoughts about not wanting this release really. Ofcourse I will buy it being a collector. Ofcourse I will. I just think its a totally not needed album. But the cool thing about it is that it will also come out as a DOUBLY VINYL RECORD set. That should be totally cool. I eally long for that little piece to come. Mid November is the date and I am all over it as it gets released for sure. But you all knew that little detail.\n\nThe details about the release itself well; Greatest Hits via Eleven Seven Music/MÃ¶tley Records. The track listing is: 1. Too Fast for Love, 2. Shout at the Devil, 3. Looks that Kill, 4. Too Young to Fall in Love, 5. Smokin' in the Boys Room, 6. Home Sweet Home, 7. Wild Side, 8. Girls, Girls, Girls, 9. Dr. Feelgood, 10. Kickstart My Heart, 11. Same 'Ol Situation, 12. Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away), 13. Without You, 14. Primal Scream, 15. Sick Love Song, 16. Afraid, 17. If I Die Tomorrow, 18. Saints of Los Angeles, 19. The Animal In Me (Remix).\n\nL I F E I S W E L L W O R T H A S E C O N D T H O U G H T\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n****************************************\n\n6th Of October 2009 What A Bite, Aiming For next\n\n6:06PM CET\n\n****************************************\n\nMonday the 6th of October that is today and the date of the arrival of this latest huge box of stuff on the Crue. Away and out of America now here in Denmark as part of my collection. And thats all only too good to even find words for. I am not going to bitch about the extreme low finance for the remains of this month for me. I have killed and received some really heavy peices that cost a fortune to bring home but now its done. It is such a nice feeling. It is what I have been trying to put an end to for a good ten to twelve months now. And its a self sat satisfaction to say I have one or two boxes left and then all is killed past is burried and I AM looking forward to lock the door and throw away the key to that chapter and then go heads up to the future. It will be a really cool nice time and more is in the mail on its way to Denmark right now.\n\nWhat a bite that was taken this month too on the old and as said now I am aiming for the next chapter and shifting gear. Obviously. There will be a few more added things next Monday / Tuesday. Ther eare a few things that will come on by then. And again lot for lot there will come expanded categories the rest of the year. There will be more new ideas coming to the site too. we are talking back and forth about stuff that could expand the site focus itself and more. It all sounds interesting but we have to keep looking into each idea and see what is really relavant for the site and expanding as said its focus but not loading the red line through it.\n\nCD1:\n\n1. T.n.T. (Terror 'n Tinseltown)\n\n2. Dr Feelgood\n\n3. Slice Of Your Pie\n\n4. Rattlesnake Shake\n\n5. Kickstart My Heart\n\n6. Without You\n\n7. Same Ol' Situation (S.O.S.)\n\n8. Sticky Sweet\n\n9. She Goes Down\n\n10. Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)\n\n11. Time For Change\n\nCD2:\n\n1. Dr Feelgood - Demo\n\n2. Without You - Demo\n\n3. Kickstart My Heart - Demo\n\n4. Get It For Free - Demo\n\n5. Time For Change - Demo\n\n6. Girls Girls Girls - Live Around The World 89-90\n\n7. Red Hot - Live Around The World 89-90\n\n8. All In The Name Of Rock - Live Around The World 89-90\n\n9. Dr. Feelgood - Live Around The World 89-90\n\nMay also prepare yourself for some major suprises from each members own solo doings next year. Looks to be internationally touring plans as well from all the three of Lee, Sixx and Neil through out late 2010. If you are into what they do individually as well then gear up. Not to mention the merch lines that are to come from Tommy and Sixx next year. Maybe some of yo ual lmay even wanna consider not spending too much cash this holiday season coming in December nor summer vacation next year lol. Ohh well we can not al lbe like the biggets fuckhead (yours truely) and just aim for full coverage like 95% of the time. Its not great not healthy not without concerns and worries. Not even close. I admire the collectors and fans that focuses on simply one area like music in all formats ONLY vinyl CDs and more. I am just not able I tried to limit myself a few times but it felt really stinky for me. So I gave up and continued my hopelss mission of gaining as much as possible in the wider fields of their name on various somethings. Till next time my frineds thanks... be cool ***\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n***************************************\n\n8th Of September 2009, Gearing Up - Are You ready?\n\n12:02PM CET\n\n***************************************\n\nCruefest II is soon over in the US of A and Canada closing it up in October. Then it is all up for a break part to lay last touches on the solo projects and they are then aimed for as having a 2010 release from Sixx, Neil, and Lee and you know that already. The much speculated Fest II holdiong Dr Feelgood album from start to finish is ready for a European bombastic trip round February. Full UK coverage and some European arenas to be burned so in the very near future there ae heaps more news about this. Look for infos and more on ticket sales and all round start November. That will be the last Kiss of Crue you will get on this side of 2011. Solo doings in all areas covers 2010 and then there is a new BRAND new studio album in the making next year for yet another 2011 world tour and Cruefest III. But I can asure you there is a ton of merchandise to call for your money still for the next year to come. What are you gonna do?\n\nSoon half of their ten year long contract is in the past but then comes a line of new projects and the boys are going to be mid 50s early 60s as all that takes place. You do the math. How long are you gonna be a diehard? Is it still worth the fighting? I think so but I also know it is not coming troubleless. No way!! I have a line of things that are to be covered as said the next couple of months so I am to have a long hard think about what to do and how to it to make it all good. The best part right now is that I will soon see a few of my highÃ¦y beloved great friends and that is something I simply can not wait for.\n\n***********************************\n\n6th Of September 2009, Looking To the Stars\n\n4:27PM CET\n\n***********************************\n\nThings sometimes come to you like out of the blue and soon you find yourself sitting alone, lonesome and carried away by your own thoughts that soon enough takes you on a mind trip that really puts your life and more in perspective. That is what I feel I sit with at times too. I have a great feeling as posted in the last born diary post here. But I now feel I have myself sat at a crossroad in my life. I have a hard time fully explaining this feeling in a verbal written way. I feel like I have been doing a thing a long long time now and It is something I have not been able to nor really wanted to let go. The \"thing\" being this - my Crue collecting. I have done a lot of things to gain my collecting status and I have avoided a ton on the other end to not let things slip through my fingers in the sence of staying off of things that could take my time my money my chancs and focus. You do the math on what could be included and excluded in that section. You pretty much do not have a life. A regular fully accepted life in others minds at least. You are living this kind of fantasy lifestyle that is only heard of and seen in books or motion pictures. It is a life lived in the shadows of anyones understanding. Really.\n\nThere are some history in my veins that have slowly over the years been reveilled and now there seems to be no more stuff to really come to surfase if you know what I am saying. I have a need now to just contains one thing. A closing in collecting world that I live the way that I myself would like to close it when time comes. And then being let with a fulfilling of one other really important wish. Finding myself in a love life with that certian one that will lean towards the togetherness where there are common will and goals for a truely heartfelt relationship to take me through the remains of the borrowed little something called life. A pulse granted exsistence for a few decades before it ia all over and done with. And hey... it comes goes and dissapears faster than you can possible grasp really. I am blown away about how quickly the past 20 years have passed when I look at the stuff that was then and how clearly I rememebr it all. Compared to a \"okay so what has happend in the twenty years since them days then?\". Now talking about horror there is a factural something for ya. It is fucking nuts and it is freaking me out how fast life really passes before your eyes.\n\nSome asked me the other day \"Tommy if you should chose a Crue track or a few to say these are the ones creating the soundtrack of my life what would they be?\" Interesting I thought. On the other hand as I thought about that for a minute I came up with a few that simply did measure things a long way in their own explainable weird kind of ways. I think a few of the songs that could be found as a thin red line through everything really are the songs of the more sad filled feel. Not that I am sad or regretting any of my Crue doings but I have perhaps had a little more shit falling on my head for what ever reasons through the years course i have been willing to do things the way that I have done them. It can be envy from others it can be self sat crises in overdoing things it can be a revolutionary line of actions to rebel against the so called normalcy in what the society and the masses expects and accepts from you as a single individual doing this. Yeah there are many sides to the explenations of why these songs could be the longest redlines in my Cruecial collecting life.\n\nTommy Lee`s \"Hold Me Down\", Sixx AM \"Permission\", Motley Crue \"Kickstart MyHeart\", \"Home Sweet Home\", \"Looks That Kill\" and \"If I Die Tomorrow\". These songs does not nessesary have o be considered my favorites but the lyrics and the stories behind them more or less sums up my life as a collector. In big parts anyway. Again thats kind of an interesting way of looking into the life I have had and am having with this choosing songs from the artist that this is all about really. What describes the road that I have been down at for years... how has it changed, why and what reasons were coming to me requiring or demanding changes? Well there are many stories hidden in my lived life no doubt!! But there are so many deeper untold feelings and forced on things and situations in my Cruecial life that simply are not always the sweetest of thoughts.\n\nThere are so many thought about \"life so far\" and the latest \"the here and the now\" in my life. Again plenty of reasons for all my deeper thinking. I have so much in my life that I am more than willing and partly in need of changing around these days so yes there are a lot of speculations about this and that and some can have or does have directly connections to my Crue life. It is a mix of being a gerat solidly kicking ass time for me as well as a very open unset and non balanced living really., And sa i have said to myself the remaning time ofthis fucking 09 will show me a road to take crossing over and into 2010. I will for sure have a good few things in store for myself an a really cool guideline for a new tryout in the year to come. In both Crue and non crue ment ways.\n\nI long as hell for a more stable something in certian areas of my life. But i on the other hand also know that it is NOW for shit sure that I am to hang on tight with this and just try to go overboard as much as I possibly can. man sitting here opening up this can of worms feels even hardder than I thought it would be. Maybe I should quit this posting now before it gets out of hand? I have tons of things I would love to post to the public but I also feel that I have not really gotten it right all the way through till now. Scared that what I really want to say is NOT really coming out the way I wanted it to. But hey I think at least you got a tiny little idea about what I am at least trying to briefly share with you here. Right?\n\nThere are so many things in the air right now as mentioned in here the last couple of weeks and slowly things are taken shape on all them things. It feels really nice. and September is still a highly loved month as first posted some days ago. Not a thing I can say that is full on 105% a pain in the ass... The present is like a line of wounds that are healing and they heal in a good way right now. It has stopped bleeding and it is not that sore no more either ... but the memories are inked like tattoos to my chest and will forever never fully go away, and thats okay too. I feel I have a time in life right now that really is ment to just let be ... leave it alone and let tem wounds be left alone give it the time they need to complete themselves and one day wake me up with a \"T dude youre whole again. You can remember the pain but you dont feel it no more and non of us on your body and in soul, are no longer bleeding or leaking in other ways.\n\nGuess what???? Thats one beautiful thought that I really long for in life. I know living on earth is a rollercoaster with its ups and downs but for christ sake I would love to get a period of mostly ups right now. Looking back on the year that has called for colder times in Scandinavia where I live have time and time again made me look back on this year in tears in pain and with totally non understanding feelings the amoount of bad shit and pain that I have been forced to go through. It has been like a wanderer in endless wet cold dark woods that all together holds its mystery and scary spots that forces me through them all fore I am healed enough and gone through enough to fully get reasons for taking me through it all in the first place. I am not liking what I am going through or has been through this year but hey good times are ahead hoipefully and we are preparing the closure of the 2009 for a new refreshing one round the corner.... peace out!!!\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n********************************************\n\n2nd Of September 2009, Yes, Yes, Yes, Gooood Feeling\n\n12:43PM CET\n\n********************************************\n\nSeptember has knocked on the walls and are here to stay for a good 30 days. I have been so and so concerned about the month of what has been and would be possible with all my loose ends and more. Well yesterday and today have talked the talk and walked the walk. And I am happy. I am really feeling great about the situation as it is now. A ton of the stored Crue stuff and more in the USA have been shipment paid and covered now and it feels more than just good. I am looking ofr a load to come back home at the end of this month. Nice touch!!!! I am so happy all that America turbulence is soon only a sad memory in the past. Further more certian things that ages ago got deposuites and other located storage places holdong great somethings are now also covered.\n\nThe original 1983 Nikki Sixx studded and pentagram shout glove and other personal stuff is coming to me this month as well. You can see the leatehr glove talked about in tons of posters and shout live pictures ... if you still dont remember it look to the right and see a picture of him wearingf it. On the left you see an add fom the 1985 Guild bass that was around on the musician instrument market for only a year at the same time Mick had a good few different guitars of the same brand. That Sixx bass is also covered and killed now. Its been a long fight for things to come through and finally a good September 1st has burned doubts and concerns to the ground to my advantage really! It feels more than good. I can hardly find words for all the shit that is happening my dear friends. But this time for ones it is mostly all positive and nice. I have a ton of great felt feelings inside of me. You see there are so many things that are still in the making ofr the expanding side of this collecting and other stuff that are to be created and done a little something about I have a good few things up my sleeve so sit tight and enjoy the coming like I do.\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n******************************************\n\n28th Of August 2009, Another Burned & Concerned Day\n\n11:52AM CET\n\n******************************************\n\nFriday night and its alright its Friday night ...for some time to party. But not for me. No chance. I need to get things done and prepared for a weekend with nothing but full working time. Thats about the sadest thing I can say right now cause I so need a break a rest from working and all. It sucks major to feel so burned. But the other thing I long for, the love life, the thought of one, the all through great togetherness and more is so out of reach it is killing me slowly but surely. I know that is a major shitty thing to say and even worse to be the one feeling it... but it is also nothing but the truth. I miss that someone to be greatly and lovingly together with. It is not nice to feel this apart. Here is one for sarcasm... maybe it gets better in Novemebr or December?\n\nI am also slowly getting a little scared and fustrated about the Crue side of things. It is kind of a mix of reasons for it but in short this is it; there are too many things to cover out there now a days and I was like yesterday really feeling it is choking me from the inside all this constant hard fighting to me covering all there is as it comes out. It is not possible to be honest. I know I know I begin to Wsound like an old 45 record. well never the less it is the truth and it kills me. It is to me like if a mother was unable to feed and take proper care of her kids ... that too would god damn well kill the poor thing. My boss should be killed slowly with me sitting on my knees staring into this individuals eyes watching the pain slowly suck life out of the scumbag that rules the flesh this person breathes in. Shit hole. Sorry I am just so filled with all the crap and unforgiven shit they lay on us constantly. But with all this thats going on yes the collecting is freaking me a little bit again. Man it goes up and down a little too much recently on that one. really hard to accept and get used to. And further more why should I get used to it? Thats not right. No one should get used to creepy shit like that. would all be good and have a great take care of one another....\n\nI long for Monday better yet Tuesday to see whats getting covered this month and what not. Its a huge need I pray for four things wish for five but elieve not in more than three. So there are the odds baby. Not the coolest really. October sees the new re-release of Dr. Feelgood. This time it is a double disc CD. y one in Europe is talking about if theband will actualy come to Europe in feb - March as talked about to end the Cruefest II tour here and take the much talked about year off to do other solo doings. I hope they come here. It would have been the best and coolest way to say goodbye for a year for us over here in Europe too. The complete Feelgood performance is a wanted one in these parts too you know. And with the crises thats going on not as many goes over ther to see a concert as there were like last year. Myself included sadly. But that holds more other reasons.\n\nI hope for a good last few months of 2009 and ending it with a solid kick in the ass as it looks to do right now.... But predictions and solid facts have gotten a whole new meaning for me this year. I long for getting new life framings or a part of me does as this is getting really, really hard these days to keep up and do massively well. On the other hand I dont like being even close to ending my shit in the crue world. 2010 solo doings. 2011 the Dirt movie and new album and tour. That taes us into 2012 big time then start 2013 it probably ends and another sort of release comes out a live one maybe? a best of and perhaps one final studio albim round 2014 or 2015? That raps up almost the ten year long shocking contract they did. Could sound like something thats about right really.\n\nThen what ne asks? Then what? After the ten year contract is fulfilled and done with what then? Are they over? Will they do another year by year contract? Can the ykeep dooing this? are they really in that time still able to deliever whats required to be Motley Crue? Who knows? No one really not even themselves. Their ego and shit can speak for them but ... whats gonna happen? I hope things are ready by then to be rapped up in original Crue style not presenting a band that is rulled by ego and then it sucks major...\n\nI am really excited about the new KISS to come. Also kind of curious on yet another political album from W.A.S.P. October 3rd that one is being planted in my face so it will be an interesting thing to see how deep the Blackie dude has found a ego needed something to throw down on an album. Why this is so important to him these days to share his political opinions and totally burry the old rock n roll that W.A.S.P. use to deliever is still a somewhat mystery to me. I love their albums well a good load of them but live I am done with them. Meaning I do not think they are anything special no moe its just a legendary hollywood shock rock band tat has now but the main caracter and frontman still to polish his personal private ego and shape the band and its music the way he feels for not a band effort really no longer. Its sad to see for one like me. But okay we can not all be pleased nor please all others so...\n\nI find myself in a bit of rough situation here with all the stuff thats in my head. A lot of emotional turbulence almost. I am a very sensitive person for all that does not know this. I am a very strict person if I should say so myself yes but I am course I have learned that it is a waste of time walking a mile if you can really just jump the fench and grab whats there. I think it is a really stinky situation to have to do a lot about what really is a peanut. So to speak. It is not always meant to be a negative thing nor criticism but for fuck sake wh ybother? I have a ton of emoptional stuff in my skull as said these days on many fronts including our beloved foursome of Los Angeles. Just a really load of things and situations that needs to be thought through really carefully. I would say I am looking at a December to get a better view and feeling about what certain situations. And from there see and feel how the bigger things in my life should change shape perhaps.\n\nI am to be honest going through a lot of thinkng about a lot of things and I have asked myself a lot of questions if I am willing to do so and so and so and so in case so and so and so....and I feeli like I really am. So Because many of the thoughts that I am having these days are holding other individuals I am giving myself till the end of the year and see about what I should and should not do for a fresh start in my last part of my excisting life. There are as said a ton of things that I have a great deal of trouble with on the Crue front simply course of finance. BVut one thing that did make it and will come home shortly is the latest to be in a fairly good gathered collection now isthe tour itinerary of Cruefest II. Hell its not over yet but still I will have it in a few days. I often cannot believe how much money these goes for but here assaid is another to be added to the collection. Feels rather cool. Let me get more details about things to you shortly. Tuesday the video list is going to be updated a little bit so watch for that as well. More things are round the corner. Be good and stay safe my friends... Love!!\n\n******************************************\n\n24th Of August 2009, Boxes, Boxes Boxes & Updates\n\n4:11PM CET\n\n******************************************\n\nAlright so I did what I am so damn good at. Giving rest and sleep the stiff middle finger. Going straight to the daily doings that at times has to get done. I think I had a huge load of scans to get through on saturday. For the one reason Sunday was our time to throw it all up on here. Massive picks lot in the 2009 section. Some articles, magazine covers and more. Hopefully within the next hour there will open up a chance to kick in with a smaller adding with smashed basses, shirts and other stuff. I have done nothing but scannings and emptied box upon box. This was a needed process to search for some things I have no idea where are at. It is really really fustrating. I had gotten some really reare stuff back in the day and i cant seem to locate them in any of the boxes I have been through. And the more obvious boxes really when I think it their consistece. Damn it is a pain in the ass really. I hate it.\n\nMore boxes are to be gone through next Saturday and Sunday. I do need a massive better order ... I constantly pack all in catagories really. But since so much comes in like in a regular flow it is a little too hard to simply get time to go to the boxes and place these new items in them as they arrive at the doorstep. And I have to say that is a major, major problem for me. Storage place and time to handle all in the right way. Sadly thats the fact of the collection under the cercumstances that I live under. The solidly great feeling abotu Crue this week is the fact that much more stored around the globe is being paid out and shipping costs are to be killed and covered so a lot more is coming home to me in September. And that is a heavy burdon liftet no doubt. I will really enjoy that. Then in October there is a huge deal sat up for closing as well. Stuff that are simply too great to make a pass on.\n\nI have a lot of things I would love to get my hands on not only Crue I begin to truely be forced to look in on other things shortly. Early next year is a must for this. Things of daily use and more. Simply have to get my ass in gear. Bit there is no question the times of financial turbulence and more ... closing my eyes for the fact of present timing for that compared to all others that are extremely carefull have givven me a chance to get some things done in the Crue world.ot of it have been one offs really. Yeah most of the stuff that has been going on this year have all been here and now things that have not been alouing me to get a week of thinking in any way or form. But as said all out through the year the single major goal for 2009 has been to get all my stred stuff world wide home to Denmark and time and time again it has been pushed further into the calender for the one reason that everytime a huge load frm someone has been sent I have been billed out the wild zoo in import taxes and it all has all of a sudden cost me maybe a good 30% more than counted for. That is 1000s of dollars counted for and not just something a regular worker like myself can just reach out and have in hand if you know what I mean?\n\nIt is always a tough nut to crack when things comes up in your face as a deal offer or something and especially holding the really cool heavy collectibles. There are not a single ting that is not wanted of the heavy ones but there are ten times more I have to make a pass on compared to what I am actually getting. Things are not the easiest when moeny is not just laying around in a locker like soome seems to think about me. Those people could not be more wrong. I work my ass off to cover what i aim for in life and I sometimes sadly work a little more than what is healthy, I push myself a lot. I must say I have a lot of nerve at times. It is not too cool all the time. I do not choose to do what most are doing . Namely say everything in ordinary life comes first and then secondly comes Crue wen its affordable. I really do not think that that is a way that makes it possible to do it intencely.\n\nYou see its like being a musician at a fairly early starting point. You would have to throw everything away put the stuff you see your family and friends do put all that aside and just have a solid focus on this one thing. It can be extremely lonely and fustrating at times no doubt. But I tell you I have come past that feeling mostly and there for I am still doing this that I do. It is not a hobby that is to be taken lightly. It can kill most thigns. Relationships, family bonding, friendships and more.... Hell I even died for it some years back. Like flatline....died. There are so many risks from doing this. Lost a home ones.. Have more or less been through the full emotional and healthy balanced everyday living from this. It is not a thing that I would advice others to do. It is just not that great for most people out there. You have to be made of a certian kind of stuff to survive a mission like this. Trust me many times I have thought about quitting like also musicians thinks at tiems when shit hits the fan.......\n\nMy very loving and long time no see friends of Sweden I miss then a lot and I wanna see them again. I want to go see a certian few for sure from really emotional felt \"miss you much\" reasons in the fall or winter time. I just need to have it all ready and prepared. Made possible so to speak. Love caring and true loyal friendship bondings and more are worth more than gold to me. I just need to be better in giving them time and all. Its tragic really how little I do this with the ones I miss most of all. Thank god I know the reasons for it to be like this though. They are teo. One all the Crue doings and secondly the job that I have these days it is not giving me proper rest nor chances for doing much outside work, I am burned out and feeling pure shit when I compine it with the work I put in on radio and website and collection. Thats it that takes more than all my time to spend. When I also need a shower, a bed to lay down in a meal and stuff like that. No more time no proper time or nothing to see and be and share things with my loved friends. I owe them all a GREAT BIG APOLOGY FOR NOT REALLY BEING THERE.\n\nI do not really now what else is to say at this point. Things have been updated and a few more things are ready to be thrown on here..but right now enjoy the latest and and be good to yourself and others. I am silent in the way of being burned out and cant really say much about more than the posted till I see my next pay and figure out what is to be covered for absolute certainty and all...... Yeah it is a time to say things are being closed things and situations that have been going on for way too long. And from here on out in the Crue life of mine I am to not have any partner ideas with anyone again as they just always bacfires. I think I am perhaps a little too intense and serious for most.\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n********************************\n\n19th Of August 2009, Walk On T-Bone\n\n7:02AM CET\n\n********************************\n\nSo new stuff has seen the light of day already. Tommy solo stuff is out for a good 80 bucks a pair you can now walk in T-bone summer sneakers and palm tree relaxing footwear. Well all these three available ones will ahve to be looked in on late this year now now or nothing, It is way too much stuff that I have to get around here these days. But as posted the other day the stuff coming home and there by forever done and dealt with is going to be such a pleasure you have no idea. I am so so so looking forward to the next two months really. Some things will be added on here today and more on Sunday arranged times and stuff for just that with my webmaster now. Feels really nice to have this stuff put in the calender for a possible go. I am really looking forward to be seeing some things changing.\n\nSONIC BOOM CD Track Listing:\n\n1. MODERN DAY DELILAH\n\n2. RUSSIAN ROULETTE\n\n3. NEVER ENOUGH\n\n4. YES I KNOW (NOBODY'S PERFECT)\n\n5. STAND\n\n6. HOT AND COLD kiss cd cover HER\n\n7. ALL FOR THE GLORY\n\n8. DANGER US\n\n9.

Co-produced by Greg Collins\n\nOn the matter of Crue itmes; new stuff has reached this hell hole in denmark and hopefully these things will get added this week too. There will be posters, picks, personal, articles and more smaller things here and there. Also the dvd list will be updated very shortly. I long for certian things to end and be over with and looks like September will be a great or at least a fairly great month to be having some of that stuff comng to exactlythat - an end. I will treasure it like hell and I will be really feeling great when things are gonna come around to actually arrive in my home town. Yeah September and October will be rather cool months.\n\nI gotta say things have taken a rather cool turn recently on top of all the hard times and shit there now is a fairly cool chance to gain some goals again. I look so forward to it all really. And I have but only myself to thank for all this shit. Solid focus on my sat goals and there for there is this chance to do something about something again. Finally. All my USA helt or stored stuff will be over too and nothing is s great as that to be ended too. The Shout golve by the way pictures in the past diary posting. Lol, I cant even begin to tell you how many have emailed me about it and asked if I would grab it. Well I can tell this much; YES!!! I will. I have had some rather cool chats and talks with the dude and this baby is coming here next month. There are so many things that can and wil lbe done something about over the next 6 months I can not even begin to tell you so I wont even bother trying. But good things are in store ofr the collection and the site.....stick around.\n\nSome of the things that are happening in my life right now are things that in its own way and form will also come to affect my future I think. I have a long list of things that I am working on right now and that I think will be really cool to see the out come of. I am truely looking forward to be seeing it all.....I have a really felt excitement inside of me to see if I can have these things done rightfully and in the end god knows if I will be moving, changeing more things in my life, or if I will simply have spent time money and energy in what ends up as tryouts? Time will tell but it will for sure be cool to see. I will give it the time it needs but also will I hope for what I need to get out of all this thats moving inside of me. God damn it. It is eally cool times I pray for the best. Love shines baby. Just watch from a distance and see it grow.\n\n****************************************\n\n16th Of August 2009, Presley, Love, Passion, Updates\n\n2:20PM CET\n\n****************************************\n\nSo it is mid August already. Slowly things are showing clear blue sky. It makes me so happy. I seem to have a list of good and bad wanting a place in my every day life like constantly. Here are some of the stinky and blessed ones the last few days. My love life is so and so.... I have faith though. I have a good focus on things and in my own way that will give me the bets possible hopes for well you know. I have a greta feeling and i have some nice things that are to be sucked in and not taken lightly. I also have a lot of talking these days to peolpe that seems to try to help me on the matters of my site and personal future. I wil lbe thrilled to walk towards my future with both things. I like to thank everyone that has been great the last month. A ton of cool times really. Thanks a lot guys you all know who you are.\n\nPresley, Elvis Presley he died today this date in 1977. Its 32 years old the 42 years old man passed away. Gives me a lill time to at least say thanks ones again. Presley was a first to introduce me to music and the passion for it that I have today. I have always liked Elvis. His music is in my archives. The complete back catalogue. I feel belssed having experienced his music and read and seen his story. What a sad one. There are so very few aritists out there that really has ever gotten to me and stayed with me. I think there will be many apprecited hours with his music still. sad for the Elvis fans that he is no longer around .This year he would have turned 74. So next year Memphis will be a party place in another world to be in. much respect from me still so many years down the road.\n\nOn a more lively note Motley Crue and the deals closing and more. I have two down and aiming for the next few. but how is this for a read? You stuff a lot of time and some money into things that takes months and months and finally when you get the damn things you see that you have been over the top fucked and made a fool out of. One sold me a jacket of Sixx` but kept the real one and senda copy. I was furious and threatend her in amny ways to put a long story short according to herself the real one is now in the mail. Then I waited a long time for my awards to come that came and the seller has not been givin anything a slight care at all. they were thrown in a box and not packed and handled with care what the fuck...... they need a make over now to say the least. I fucknig hate people fucking with others. Why is it that some can be so careless and nothing but money is in their eyes. They kind of say \"fuck you\"and take your money and start screwing you over the best they have learned.\n\nThe story above is longer and way more sad than this. And if they do not make it right I wil lpost their names and all in here to warm you all about them as far as to deal with if you should sometime get tempted. I hate to say this and do this cause this is so not what I am all about. But I care and respect other collectors that much. for them not to make a mistake about something that can be preventred if only one opens up and speaks out. So let us see in a good week or two from now what will happen. The ghult guitars mid 80s had Sixx playing it for one year only. That one comes next month. I can not wait to have it here. it is without a doubt one of the more hard to find basses since they as said were only on the market designed by Sixx for one year. But now it will come here and it will all be fab.\n\nSo many cool things are are up for grabs these days and there is nothing to say but \"fuck I would like to have this and this and this..:\" like Nikki`s shout costume from the gatefold album cover. Look at the leather pentagram glove. I can have it if I choose to. My loyalty and passion for this is like so intense right now. I really like to get this one too. Well I always want a load of shit and I also know that in a year or something it will be way harder to get thise things as the crises are probably betetr and there for people are not gonna sell oout cause money is perhaps not so badfor everyone. So fucking grab now as you can and what you can is the inner voice in me like all the time .It is not a cool thing to have in me cause its a sort of cnstant pressure but still..... this is what I do and what I am all about as everyone knows. Tough. but Sixx shout costume piece ... hellooooo who the fuck would not want that?\n\nHow about the Crue life? well I am feeling better by the minute with the pushed things for the band and their solo doings. Tommy`s Methods Of Mayhem release number two is pushed till erly 2010 now as you may know so I am fine about that. Sixx AM is not gonna be active till 2010 either.Vince is coming out with asolo CD and a biography book but i think that too will be pushed till later in the year if not on the other side of new years as well. Splended I think. Suits me way better. I have a gazillian things to kill here first so I am all good about the news on the solo matters. have gotten some things in the mail that we will try to get added here in the next few days starting right now as we speak. The new photo book of the legendary photographer Neil Zlozower has arrived here today as well and I think it is an over the top nice book. I have to say the complete work on it is just awsome. The coffee table sized hardcover binded book and paper quality is simply outstanding. A well worth buy if you like to see pictures of just classic Crue. Yeah it is a really cool thing. Highly recommend it.\n\nHave also tried to get kinds of people to the sie and a lot of new \"faces\" have emailed me and givien their thumbs up forthe site and all. Its an absolute pleasure and I thank you for all your loyalty toward the site. Thanks guys. Awsome to see so many still getting in to it. Lisa of Sweden a new person a youngster at 22 has mailed me to and given me a good few story lines of how and why she is into the band and what it does to hearound things that I should have done a long time ago but i have had no time this one day off to even think about everything. Nor have I had the strength I sat by the computer last night and several times took myself in banging my head into the tastboard simple out of tiredness. I was so fucking tired you have no idea. And It has been this way more or less since mid June. Now its soon mid August. I can not really keep doing this.I need some real quality time off and all. It is not the coolest easiest times when I need to gain as much money as I can to pay all the shipping and import taxes. Those issues alone are heavy enough issues as is.\n\nThere has been a lot of support recently from all kinds of people to the sie and a lot of new \"faces\" have emailed me and givien their thumbs up forthe site and all. Its an absolute pleasure and I thank you for all your loyalty toward the site. Thanks guys. Awsome to see so many still getting in to it. Lisa of Sweden a new person a youngster at 22 has mailed me to and given me a good few story lines of how and why she is into the band and what it does to her and all. Thats just great. Looking forward to be getting more of this from her. Some day we will be meeting I am absolute certian of it. All in all a lot of great mails from people really. Again thanks a million. Nice to have you here.\n\nToday the first in a serie of Crue beer is coming too. Dont even think about finding it cause you can not. But in a long long time to come (I would say a good year or something I can get maybe 3 to 5 people a complete set of one of all beers in the serie) and if you have interest in and be patience and prepered to pay fairly big cause these are NOT gonna be found anywhere!!!! -Also there are so many things that are in the planning stages for me right now as said plenty already the rest of 2009 is long gone in my calender already. No more things to be looked for in on ar nothing. I have some really sweet goals sat for the last few months of this year so I am not gonna be doing much besides that. And it is all for you to get a total excitement from as it gets on here piece by piece. Well better get going with some more daily things time flies here and I have a few good things to get in on before I board the next train ones more. peace out***\n\nMcrueloyalty.dk\n\n**************************************\n\n5th Of August 2009, First Week Down - Feels Good\n\n1:26pm cet\n\n**************************************\n\nThe first week of August is nearly over and I am more than pleased about it. This month is no good for me. It is nothing but ....well financially thinking.....its not good at all.the damn national costume services takes all my cash this month. I have done a good job trying to get more stuff home that has been stored for a long round America and other places. Now its paid out sent and arrived with nothing but huge import fees and shit. Its a drag like nothing else when the goverment takes my money for giving me my own fucking itmes. What is that all about anyway?\n\nSad sick shit. And I did not get nothing but the worst paycheque in 4 years this month as well. So for me this month of August can pass by in a heart beat really. I need it to pass to feel like living again. I can do absolutely nothing here with the constant xtra fees arriving at my door steps.\n\nOne of the things that has been sort of worrying me as well is the solo project or projects of the members really.....All should have new CDs out later this year now its said at least Tommy`s next Methinds album is not coming this year. Tommy Lee's METHODS OF MAYHEM project has inked a worldwide deal with Loud & Proud Records, a Roadrunner Records imprint focusing on established artists. Roadrunner will release the band's sophomore album in early 2010. Commented Lee: \"I'm so f@&*ing pumped!! I've signed with my friends at Roadrunner... What a perfect home for my second METHODS OF MAYHEM record. We're about to do what no team has ever done before... Buckle up and hang on, kids!\" Tommy told Billboard in January 2009 that DJ Aero and guitarist Kai Marcus are still onboard for METHODS OF MAYHEM's as-yet-untitled new effort, and Lee's producing partner Scott Humphrey is also said to be involved.\n\nIn a recent interview with TuneLab.com, drummer Will Hunt (EVANESCENCE, STATIC-X, DARK NEW DAY, TOMMY LEE) -- who played on the new METHODS OF MAYHEM CD -- stated about the album, \"People are gonna be very surprised when they hear that record. It's very different than anything [Tommy's] done. It's still very cool, there's some very melodic, commercial stuff on it, but the bulk of the record is very heavy, grungy, DEFTONES-sounding stuff. And it's just really cool.\" Lee formed METHODS OF MAYHEM in 1999 after he left MOOTLEY CRUE. The all-star project collaboration with rapper TiLo featured input from LIMP BIZKIT's Fred Durst, THE CRYSTAL METHOD, Kid Rock, Snoop Dogg, and Mix Master Mike. After signing to MCA, METHODS OF MAYHEM issued its self-titled debut LP in late 1999.\n\nMore s, this n that, personal, shirts, solo stuff and more is to be added within the next week or something. There are a lot of things that I am gonna get up on here over the next coming weeks. Not as much as erlier but still. I said this was to be a fairly quiet month and I stand by that statement still really. Well its obvious from how the country is milking me for money in import fees. jesss louise. I am looking forward to be getting some more things cleared and looking more and more forward to the MOM album to come. It canbe quiet cool actually. There are tours up the wild zoo next year solo wise and a lot of new solo merch my god. Fasten your seat belts and sit tight if you collect everything thats got to have anything to do with a member. It is a damn rough situation to do this if you collect absolutely everything I have said it time and time again the last yeear or so.. it is not right. It is not even possible to do anything that is anyway near a chance to cover all. No matter how many contacts you have ... you wouldhave to be born with a silver spoon up your ass to cover all this crap.\n\nI am still fighting for my pride my loyalty and passion to cover everything there is and have done an awsome job if you ask me since the reunion late 2004. Fuck look in on any section such as picks shirts personal and more from ONLY 2004 and up till now. It is an extremely good job done. I have to say. I would tip my hat to anyone that had done the same thing. I wouactually be a little stunnedto be honest.have my brother to thank for this shit being possible while fighting for getting my stuff home from America. All ideas of moving over there has been eliminated .I have no such wish anymore at all.\n\nWell this is me signing off till round Friday I would think some of the painful billed items will have arrived by then and then I have a chance to tell more on the latest doings in my small time Crucial living as well. Ohh also while I remember Mario thanks a million for your loyalty hard work and morehanks for expanding the dvd collection of mine as well. we have a lot to talk about and get in on. Hope you will enjoy your Crue stuffed box to come. More to come. I can not help thinking how easy it is wth the few Europeans I have worled with to do this site and its stuff right nad not having any shit going on between the staff members. Not what I have experienced as you all know with my US people ... not al lbut most of them. It is a pain in the ass it has had to be this way with a lot of people out there. What a shame. Do not know what the fuck all this was about .. but I am back on trak on that subject and I am blessed to have had Mario coming onboard. Thanks man\n\n****************************************\n\n31st Of July 2009, Site Ready & New Solved Stuff\n\n3:18PM CET\n\n****************************************\n\nFriday everybody heads home for a weekend time off. I myself are having a long hard working Friday Saturday and Sunday. No rest for my shoulders this time around .I will have such a hard time during August I will most likely get a littel ill from it. I hope not but I am prepared for the worst. It is a sick twisted sad shitty hard scedual but I will not complain about it. I am in a good mood here for small time reasons really but I am. There are so many things going on and a lot of them are really exciting for me. I have some things to get around to kill issues as said through out July and this being the last day of that month feels like just closing a really hard one. I feel good about that one simple fact. Now August is knocking on all our dorrs and we are heading in to this new month with heads high and a website that is about 95% updated and ready to be labeled as now in perfect order and changed over to the new program that has been a real hassle. We are talking over 60.000 pictures and 220 pages in this monster now July 2009.\n\n**************************************************\n\n7th Of July 2009, Ordinary Daily Living & New Marked Calender Days\n\n1:27PM CET\n\n**************************************************\n\nTuresday and lol,lol on a train. I know I practically live on one. But there will be new times for me onthat front from the end of the year or for me from the early times of 2010. Let us see how it all unfolds. This is not the most attractive detail about my life no more. I really have started to be anoyed about the constant travelling for small things. I need a lot of changes next year. Thats for shit sure. And much have started already with the Crue changed now going on You bet.\n\nSo how is everything? Since I retrned from the European trip many have asked about the birthday of mine cause I was unreachable. Not locally around. Well I was in Bulgaria for the Crue final European show. And without spreading things officially let me just say this it was a mindblowing day. I have not had any birthday like it ever. In a good sence. Anyone wanna try to top it for me - boy you are gonna have a handful. I am not for gifts and all sorts of things for myself on these marked almost obligated calender days. I appreciate the every day suprises way more. Long story to back up why this is this way. Anyhow I was there not anywhere near home so I had a long journey there and I had a ton of cool times. So alou me to have that over the top day for myself and just say this was a day with ton of stuff to be rememebred for life. I wish just a handful of days each year were like this one day in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter the returning from the south for the second time I have been in the norht of Denmark trying to take care of the site and get thing s added and adjusted and more too, We have come a fairly long way with most of al lon here now and there are a fairly constant flow still when it comes to new stuff to add on here no matter if its a few articles or a more massicve lot in various catagories really. All in all just a really good flow. Always something I guess.\n\nThere have been so many things that are so intence for me to get around and it requires time so asa always wit ha huge monster like this site has gotten to be - have patience with what ever botheres you. we will have most updated at the end of the next coming week-end. I am so looking forward to the next coming few months there are so much getting better (not financially) the rest of the year. And it will be a pleasure to step into 2010 for a new fresh someting. But then again I have been aiming high and fought hard to make things happen and to kill certain stuff. It will be a cool something really to get passed November. I hope I shall have work this christmas eve this year and then be off at new years. I have a few things I really like to get going for me on that front.\n\nSo the ordinary everyday life is back now setting a standard ones again for what I fill my days with. Work takes my time and nights and all ones again. But it is all okay and good. I feel blessed from the vacationtime I have just had and i am not worried much for som time again. I am on a high. I am on a possitive path and I feel I have a good balance ones again to carry me through the stuff that life and everyday living will throw at me. It can only be stuff from and about things that are not Crue related cause that openness and willing ness to be too close to people that promises lines of sounding goods are over. I am not there no more and I am not going there again. I have a new role to play and a new role to be my guideline for the future of my collecting and loyal Crue life.\n\nI wanna take time out right now to also welcome a new guy from Austria that really is like me in many ways. he is Mario of Austria a new loyalty gang member. We will in the future do what we can to set up some thing really neat. There are so manythings we could have and could do that are not seen beofer in these parts of the world. I have great comfort with this guy and really great hopes for something unique for the future on a both collectible and personal level. So thanks Mario so far for what we have had together and for all your kindness understanding shared apssion and more. Looking forward to be doing something with you through Mcrueloyalty.dk in the future to come. And welcome to Loyalty by the way.\n\nThre will be a coverage of the Cruefest 2 too. The mid August the merchandse will be covered nd I will have it all added on here hopefully late August. It will not be in the beginning of the Fest tour this time. So it will take some time before you will see that stuff on here. There are so many other things that will be getting my attention til lthen and there are other stuff and doings listed in the calender now.New added somethings in the calender that will be marked dates for stuff to coe.\n\nSoon there will be a couple of really cool personal used and owned stuff coming that are fom the recent years incl S.O.L.A. so hopefully they all get through costumes without any billings. The goverment gets enough money from all that import shit. It is a seriously good busines on their part. I gotta give them that. My god. It must be millions and millions every year in income from just that. And I feel as a private individual I spit plenty in their little bucket on this matter.\n\nNow I would have to say this posting probably brings me up todate on thoughts and doings. I have so many of both both for god sake I live this. It is not a hobby as said so often before so obviously there will be a lot on mind in these fields. Yeah I love to take things to a level most would not dare or even think of doing cause it is a price to pay in every other matter that really is not for any person with a clear sanity to mess with. Am I saying I am insaine? Well I am not a shrink so who knows what a diagnose would claim me being. I could not really care much either. I have so many things that would make anyone shake their heads when it comes to how intense I do things so .....\n\nBut some of us likes this over the top thing ... so enjoy while its around ..Mcrueloyalty peace!!!!\n\n****************************************\n\n6th Of July 2009, Exausted But Recovering For better\n\n1:33PM CET\n\n****************************************\n\nFUCK ME HARD do I love the Papa Roach latest CD. Yes it is the chose release for me creating yet another god damn posting on here. I would have loved to see them live tonight. They are rocking my filthy little living big time. They have some serious cool lyrics on the latest CD of theirs. Fuck you all should check it out. It is a powerful band these days. And I feel extremely awsome to have seen them so many times. Been I think 6 times the last year. I would go far to see them agian I think.\n\nOkay okay okay, enough of the Papas... its a freaking Crue site right?!! Yeah baby. It fucking is. lets bring the Euro tour to an end in on here and let me take you up to date with thoughts and doings from this crazy fuck - yours truely!!! There is not much I will not share with you. Certain things will be kept to myself out of respect for the individuals that will have a saying to certain things being shared on here. So lets get this tju tju train rolling shall we? Okay.\n\nWell I think last time I decided to stop typing we were back at the hoptel from the Belgium Graspop festival 09 adn turning night time to day time. We got up and ate and tried to get some things happening. I was a little shattered by the JAckson news still. I felt for the fans. I know I should have typed the family right? Well I am a fan and can relate to that. So that is where I give my sympathy. To the music industry as well. Like Michael or not he was a one of a kind and we have just gotten gold mine poorer. So it was touching me ofcause it was. I am industry interested still and I ... ohh well never mind. It got to me and that is all you need to know. So we checked out after breakfast and a final hour resting in the room. We had a long way back. And back as of this date the 28th of June was home going. Final destination Denmark. For god sake another long trip and tour has been thrown in the backpackl of memories and unfolded doings.\n\nThe taxi came picked us up and we took off wih a delay earliest possible from Mol station. That menat around 1PM as to our scedual we would have a train out from there at 5PM. But we figured let us get the hell out of this place and even though it was a long waiting time else where we would be better off in a place where we could actually do something. That was not an obtion in Miol. So we went as said after a small time mall shopping to find food and drinks. And sweets for the trip. Off to the next stop Hasselt. Sonn on to Liege. here is the triky part in Belgium many working at the stations and information stands they refuse to even try to understand english. They demand french and there for at Liege we got informed totally bad.\n\nWe should relaly have been two stops furhter before we got off the train at liege Guillemins. this little scrww up on his behalf did really not do much good for us. We stranded at a place for almost 3 hours and thank god killed two of them by visiting a net cafe. And as we came back another fucking info had been bad on this dudes part. All of a sudden there was no train listed on the departure board for us to get to Cologne Germany. I asked a youngster there and he was helpful bigtime. He said also you have to take this and that train two stops get off and wait for another... Nice touch old man. You would have been fired had you been under my wings in a second. Fucker.\n\nWe boarded the Cologne trian at the new station we headed to Liege G. found our seats and sat till we had been going about half way there was an information coming to all passengers. \"Sorry to inform you we are having locomotive trouble so we will be an hour late in Cologne.\" Nice one. Form the already bad happenings that there had been we would normally only have one hour and five minutes in Cologne now. And that was with the fact of not knowing where we should go to in Cologne for our Copenhagen Denmark train. Ohh dear!!\n\nWell to make a long story short. We got to Cologne just as promised (if that is a good thing) one hour late. And yet we had no idea of whrer to go nor how to get there. But it was fairly fast and easy and coming to the platform for the train to take us home we got blessed ones again. It was 12 minutes late this Denmark train. So I wanted desperately to go get something to eat. Without asking Tine what she liked I just said wait here and took off. It was late and I was not even sure if I could find anything. But I grabbed thre pizza slices and got back to her. She had now gotten bad stomack pain so she could not really eat anything. sorry to see cause she had not aten all day.\n\nI ate them all then and felt better myself. Just in time for the train to arrive. Found our cabbin lol, lol onboard and it was a nightliner so we had \"beds\" for the trip home. Shared with one European guy and three American chinamen. Now living in the state of Tennessee. Tine talked a lot to these folks I on the other hand only dissapeared in y thoughts about Motley Crue again and felt really good about my situation. It had been a trip that truely took me to the stars. I have started as pointed out earlier in here on a new book. Not a new chapter in the old but a freshly made new book of my cruecial adventures. Burried the old and moving on. The trip this time had done exactly what I hoped and prayed for. make no mistake about it. So from here on out I am extremely careful with what I do and with whom I will be doing what. I guess most of you know what I am saying here. The whole trip home I had a terribly heat problem onthe train but we got there and Arriving in Denmark felt both good and terrible. Guess for the obvious reasons. I was really feeling great about all I had done and the much dedication i had done. The suffering for making a ton of things better and the ton of energy put into overtime at work and more to create a possibility for myself to do something right. You know it is the most self satisfaction state of mind I have been in in a long time. Got a lot of things out of hard work. Nothing ended up being for nothing. It was all done with a result of a bunch of many somethings. Feels so nice.\n\nI arrived by my brothers place in Roskilde staright from the train and I had decided that no matter what happend in July I would not let myself be bothed about it one bit. And so far now posting on here the 6th I have kept that promise to myself. Let things roll its cause and just run along on the sideline adjusting things till I have a new found way and balance in this Motley Crue passionate life of mine. From this day on I had to get somethings done and some things going that wouldactually giv me something better .... Due to my brothers girlfriend (yes he found another try out lol lets see how it all unfolds) I went to Tine for the evening andfor the night. I slept there a decition of going to my own place cross country in the moring to get things in place. It was a kind of weird situation for me saying bye bye from there in the morning after. She is without going in to deatils cause it is non of your business really - so living in her past and have a hard time to get things changed within herself .Its so hard and so sad. We just have to get this shit fixed so we can do soemthing about it and move on to new heights. Other wise things as seen so many times before with other peoples lives - it can end bad and there would be no \"us\". And that is right now not anywhere near what any of us really wants. We could be good together but both parties would have to give up something. Or else this would never get to other levels. Hated this morning as I felt trapped. But home I went and it was needed big time. Get unpacked from the tour and laundry my god...... Picture taking realxing and getting things fixed and dealt with. I have so many things I still am behind with even now on the 6th. Insaine!!!\n\n**********************************************\n\n4th Of JUly 2009, Graspop Crue, Night games & Home Coming\n\n6:49PM CET\n\n*********************************************\n\nHere it is again the first off day after having gotten back on what we could call \"work\" or \"everyday life\" or \"obligations to living\" what ever you decide to pick of them all I am not there today Went ones again for a country crossing straight from a Night shirt and a full day awake yesterday.
