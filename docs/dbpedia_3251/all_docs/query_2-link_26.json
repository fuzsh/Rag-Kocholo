        "text": "The Football Association have confirmed which coloured kits Manchester United will be wearing in Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester City.\n\nErik ten Hag's side will be looking to avenge last year's defeat at Wembley when Pep Guardiola's team won 2-1. City went on to match United's 1999 treble a week later after beating Inter Milan 1-0 in the Champions League final in Istanbul.\n\nUnited will be underdogs again going into this weekend's fixture with the club ending the 2023/24 Premier League season in eighth, their lowest finish since 1989/90. City meanwhile won an unprecedented fourth straight English top-flight title and will be looking to become the first side to win a double double after last year's league and cup success.\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United next manager odds - Kieran McKenna and Pochettino favourites to replace Ten Hag\n\nREAD MORE: Gibraltar international signs deal with Manchester United after stunning season\n\nAnd the FA have confirmed that United will be wearing red shirts, black shorts and black socks at Wembley this weekend. The club's goalkeeper meanwhile will be in yellow. City will be in their regular blue home strip with the goalkeeper in green.\n\nThe colours of United's kit on Saturday will be the same as last year's final but will mean Ten hag's side will have to play in alternative shorts to their usual white ones over fears of a kit clash. Ten Hag's side are the designated away team with Wembley expected to be sold out for the showpiece fixture.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game, Ten Hag said: \"It's all about trophies but you need an opportunity to win a trophy. So in the last ten years, not so many trophies in this club but we have an opportunity to win two trophies in two years.\"\n\nWhen asked if victory would salvage a difficult season, he added: \"No, but the FA Cup final is a big event and we are there, even in the season is not in our way we are there, we have an opportunity and it's never been easy but we have to go for it and we will go for it.\n\n\"We have to believe as we did last season as we have done often against good opponents, we play our best football and I expect that again on Saturday.\""
