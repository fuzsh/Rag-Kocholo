        "text": "Erik ten Hag has called on his Manchester United players to be on the front foot and aggressive when out of possession next season.\n\nThe manager was heavily criticised for showing a lack of identity in his tactical set-up last term, with United regularly leaking shots on goal and struggling to find scoring consistency. Ten Hag engaged in a public argument with analyst Jamie Carragher over his comments following a defeat to Fulham.\n\n\"Some analysts are very objective in their comments, very good advice, some are very subjective,\" said Ten Hag in February. \"Jamie Carragher, from the first moment on, has criticised and now he wants to make his point.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Marcus Rashford injury update after knock suffered vs Real Betis\n\nREAD MORE: Erik ten Hag's favourite Amad trait in Manchester United win vs Real Betis speaks volumes\n\nCarragher had said on Sky Sports that United 'defend like a team I’ve never seen before', adding: \"They’re a team who like to press high with a deep block - it’s impossible.\"\n\nUnited have conceded three shots on target in their last two friendlies games against Real Betis and Arsenal, albeit have faced - and fielded - heavily rotated sides. They will have to deal without new £59m summer recruit Leny Yoro in defence until October after the centre-back fractured his metatarsal against the Gunners.\n\nHis absence could affect transfer plans with just over a month to go until deadline day, but whoever is signed, Ten Hag will give them clear tactical instructions. Speaking after the overnight 3-2 friendly win over Real Betis in California, the United boss unpacked his demands when it comes to pressing off the ball.\n\n\"What we want to achieve is we want to be very proactive and very aggressive and it doesn't matter if sometimes we are high [up the pitch] or sometimes in a lower block,\" Ten Hag said.\n\n\"We have to be very aggressive and in order to get this we need to start the press at certain points and all be on one page. Then the intensity must convert to being with the ball and we must do this as a team.\"\n\nCarragher had accused United of being disjointed in their defensive plan when out of possession last season, arguing this as the reason behind their frailties, which saw them concede 20 shots or more in a match on multiple occasions.\n\nHe said: \"They’re trying to do two things at the same time. You can only do one or the other. We’re all pressing high or all defending deep, they’re trying to do both.\"\n\nTen Hag admitted his side had been lax in the defeat to Fulham - only their second loss to the Cottagers at Old Trafford since 1963 - but insisted that the issue was being exaggerated.\n\n\"I know footballers are not robots, sometimes they have bad days,\" he said. \"But it can’t be, it’s unacceptable and we have to do better tomorrow. But in the weeks before we have done very well.\""
