        "text": "Category Archives: 1989-90\n\nFour Major Trophies This Season?\n\nTomorrow will see Manchester City and Manchester United face each other in the second All-Manchester FA Cup final. This promises to be another dramatic day in the history of Manchester football (we are so blessed being able to see days like these).\n\nObviously, the game could go either way and I don’t want to make predictions as derby days are often difficult to predict. I well remember arriving at Maine Road in September 1989 when Alex Ferguson’s United were most expensive squad ever assembled in British football at the time. That day City fans feared the worst and by full-time the Blues had defeated the Reds 5-1 with chants of Fergie Out coming from the fans left in the away section of the Platt Lane Stand. Who would have thought that night that he would keep his job and bring so much success to the Reds?\n\nWhatever happens enjoy the day and game. Clearly, if United win then that will help their development and if City win then that will mean four major trophies have been won this season – the other three are of course the Premier League, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. Not bad hey? Add to that the FA Youth Cup and it’s been another great season.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe 1990s: The Day Swales Said No to Chester!\n\nThe series of features covering Manchester City in the 1990s continues today with the story of Peter Swales saying ‘No’ to Chester! What did Chester want? Well, it’s a generally forgotten time when Third Division debt-ridden homeless club Chester needed to find another ground to play at. Meetings were held between Chester and Manchester City chairman Peter Swales which sadly resulted in the decision that the Cheshire club could not play at Maine Road. These cuttings are from today (31 March) in 1990 and explains the situation.\n\nI love how they use a staged image of Swales on the phone – as if he’s Batman getting an urgent message to save the planet.\n\nUltimately, Chester played at Macclesfield for a couple of years but it does make you wonder what could have happened at Maine Road.\n\nWhile you’re here why not read more on MCFC in the 1990s. The following article tells the story of the opening months of 1990 (see below).

I think I’ve spotted who started all this ‘Empty seats’ malarky – Madonna! On this day (29 March) in 1990 the Manchester Evening News carried this article saying that Madonna was worried about playing at Maine Road because of the potential for empty seats! When I found this I just had to share. The actual phrase ’empty seats’ is in there too!\n\nObviously, Madonna herself probably had no knowledge of this although City chairman Peter Swales claimed he was actively pursuing the idea of her appearing at Maine Road. Lots of concerts did take place at Maine Road (you can find articles on them elsewhere on this site).\n\nWhile you’re here why not read more on MCFC in the 1990s.

It was a great, transfer deadline beating transfer and one which proved extremely popular over the months that followed. Quinn was a wonderful Irish international, going to the World Cup while with City.\n\nThis newspaper cutting talks of his arrival and contains some nice quotes too:\n\nThis feature is part of my series on Manchester City in the 1990s and you can read about the opening months of 1990 below.

These articles make interesting reading now. Note also the involvement of Rick Parry – a man well known in football circles then and now (he later was one of the key figures behind football’s league restructuring).\n\nI’ve included this as part of my feature on Manchester City in the 1990s as ultimately these Olympic bids led to the building of the City of Manchester Stadium (present day Etihad). Back in 1990 though the preferred site for a new stadium was in Trafford and Manchester City had held discussions even then on moving to the new stadium even though it would have meant City moving out of the City of Manchester.\n\nNotice how the footballing activities were to be shared between City, United, Everton and Liverpool. Also, the velodrome is mentioned as the Tameside Velodrome but it is of course the one build near the present day Etihad.\n\nThis feature is part of my series on Manchester City in the 1990s and you can read about the opening months of 1990 below.

It was a match City should have won but there were a few jitters and a great deal of banter on the terraces too. It was all connected with that infamous Gary Crosby goal (3 March in 1990) which had caused City to lose 1-0 atNottingham Forest. You can read about that elsewhere on my website but have a read of this match report from the Arsenal game and you’ll see that it was still being referred to and still in the minds of all those connected with City. The Manchester Evening News headline above (mentioning ‘clanger’) wasn’t particularly helpful as it now gave fans the feeling that clangers had happened in consecutive games. That wasn’t fair on either Dibble or on Redmond.\n\nWorth noting that David White scored for City and the Arsenal goal was scored by Brian Marwood, who has spent most of the last 15 years helping the modern day City find success.\n\nFor more on that season, have a read of this 1,300 word article on the end of the 1989-90 season.

Howard Kendall was the City manager and the Blues were in the middle of a period where many of their 1986 FA Youth Cup winners were now regulars. Kendall recognised that topflight experienced/major trophy winning players were needed and he had embarked on strengthening the Blues with several players he felt he could trust to re-establish City as a credible trophy challenging team.\n\nThe story starts with the opening months of 1990 (see below).

There will be a seasonal journey through a truly important decade when Manchester City began the decade hoping to challenge for the Premier League. People often forget how things changed that decade. A giant of a club at the start of the decade and one that the whole football world recognised as being part of English football’s aristocracy. By the end of the decade it was the loyalty of fans that most recognised the club for.\n\nThose that claim City has ‘no history’ may learn something about a decade that is often highlighted for its failings but which actually had some wonderful, incredible, positive moments too. This series of features will show how that decade actually went and will hopefully help to explain why the narrative of ‘third tier club that got lucky’ is so wrong! For the entire month of March there will be features to make every Blue proud, while also recognising the true nature of football – some times it’s great being a fan and sometimes it’s awful. That’s football!\n\nRe-live the highs and lows of the 1990s decade from tomorrow onwards.\n\nIf you’d like to read everything in this series then please subscribe.
