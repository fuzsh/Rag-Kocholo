        "text": "Active departments of Sports Club Vardar Football Basketball Handball\n\nFK Vardar (Macedonian: ФК Вардар) is a professional football club based in Skopje, North Macedonia, which competes in the Macedonian First League. They are the most successful club in Macedonian football, having won eleven Macedonian First League titles, five Macedonian Cups, two Macedonian Super Cups and one Yugoslav Cup. In 2017, they became the first Macedonian club to qualify for the group stage of a European competition.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginning\n\nAfter WW2 FK Vardar was established with the merger of city rivals FK Pobeda (1919) and FK Makedonija (1922), in the hall of cinema \"Vardar\" on 22 July 1947. The foundation assembly had decided the club's color to be blue and it was, but already at the next assembly the decision was changed to red and white. FK Pobeda has competed in the first season of the Federal League after the World War II, finished at the eighth place and won the relegation playoffs against FK Sloga from Novi Sad, FK Vardar was a member of the Federal league from the very beginning. However, during the following decade they were several times relegated and promoted back again. The present recognizable red and black color jerseys were brought back again after the 1963 Skopje earthquake when the famous Milan football club sent equipment for the Skopje's team.\n\nFirst Federal League\n\nThe club won its first major trophy in the 1960–61 Yugoslav Cup. Many famous players from the region started their careers at Vardar, and their triumph in the Yugoslav Cup was a highlight. The leader of that particular generation of players was Andon Dončevski, who later coached the team from 1986 to 1988. Due to massive irregularities during the last 34th week of fixtures, the 1985–86 Yugoslav First League season ended notoriously. Football Association of Yugoslavia headed by Slavko Šajber voided the last week's results ordering a replay of all 9 fixtures. Twelve clubs were docked 6 points due to alleged participation in the match-fixing scandal. All teams agreed to replay their games but FK Partizan, who had won the title with a 4–0 over FK Željezničar Sarajevo, refused, after which the game was awarded 3–0 to FK Željezničar Sarajevo, which gave Red Star Belgrade the title. Red Star Belgrade played in the 1986–87 European Cup. However, after a sequence of legal processes, the original final table, with FK Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in 1987. The following 1986-87 Federal League season saw 10 teams starting with -6 points. Vardar Skopje, who had not been deducted 6 points, won the title, and participated in the 1987–88 European Cup, but the points deduction was later annulled after more legal proceedings, and the title was given to FK Partizan, who headed the table with the deduction. But for UEFA, Vardar was recognized as a champion. In 1986–87 Federal League team had a group of wonderful players, led by the talented Darko Pančev and including Ilija Najdoski, Dragi Kanatlarovski and Vujadin Stanojković. FK Vardar went on to spend 33 seasons in the Federal top flight from 1947 to 1992 and is ranked 11th on the all-time table.\n\nRank Club G W D L GF GA GD P 11 FK Vardar 1041 343 252 444 1249 1528 −279 933\n\nAfter independence\n\nVardar celebrated Macedonia independence by winning three consecutive titles including going unbeaten in the inaugural season. During the 90's they remained at the top of Macedonian football reaching five Cup finals; winning four and have always been the team to beat. After a lean spell by their standards, they brought the league again in 2001–02 and the following season just missed out on qualifying for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League group stage. A remarkable achievement, in the Second qualifying round they eliminated CSKA Moscow and came within a goal of getting past Sparta Prague. In 2011, Vardar was originally relegated from the Macedonian First Football League, but after a buying the license from Miravci it stayed. The following season they brought the league again after nine years. To date they have 17 major honors to their name. In 2012, with the new transformation, FK Vardar became the first team in North Macedonia organized as a joint stock company incorporated under the Companies Act. FK Vardar went on to spend 24 seasons in the Macedonian First Football League from 1992 to 2017 and is ranked first on the all-time table.\n\nRank Club G W D L GF GA GD P 1 FK Vardar 768 439 180 149 1428 651 +777 1438\n\nMemorable moments\n\nIn their history, FK Vardar has had many memorable matches.

Komiti are the first organized supporters group of Vardar and they were founded on 4 June 1987 in Skopje, at the match between FK Vardar and Red Star Belgrade. Throughout their existence, they left significant seal in the history of Vardar and with their support becoming the 12th player of the team. FK Vardar as a club is supported by most Macedonians worldwide. The Ultras group KOMITI was noticed for the first time in the year 1985, on 'Zapad' (West Stand), where the most fanatic fans of Vardar always operated. Two years later, on 4 June 1987 at the City Stadium in Skopje was a derby match of the Yugoslav league at that time between Vardar Skopje and Red Star Belgrade (3:1). On 'Zapad' for the first time since the existence of the club, a banner with the writing 'KOMITI' was noticed. The idea contained the establishment of a massive and strong Macedonian ultra scene. The goal was for 'KOMITI' to make the prominent post of all activities and events on the West Stand. As the most acceptable name of the group was selected 'KOMITI'.\n\nThe reason for it was simple: In the last decade of the 19th century and the early 20th century, when Macedonia was still under Ottoman rule, the revolutionaries that had been organized under IMRO were called komitadjis, as in members of the Macedonian Committee. This name is very strong and the meaning of the name is closely linked with their goals, this is why they decided not to use one like the standard unimaginative names such as Brigate, Commando, Ultras, Boys, etc. And so, the name 'KOMITI' was selected for the newborn Ultra group.\n\nThe team has always been a symbol of the Macedonians and in the diaspora. Komiti have great relations with FK Teteks fans \"Vojvodi\" and FC Schalke 04 fans \"Ultras Gelsenkirchen\".\n\nRivalries\n\nEternal Derby\n\nMain article: Eternal derby (North Macedonia)\n\nThe fixture between Vardar and FK Pelister is the biggest and most violent match in North Macedonia. An important aspect of this match-up is the intense rivalry in the Macedonian tifo scene between the supporter clubs Komiti Skopje and Čkembari. The rivalry began in the season 1989–90 at a match in Skopje, between FK Vardar and Red Star Belgrade. A conflict occurred between the \"Skopje fans\" and a few \"Bitola fans\" who went to cheer for FK Vardar, who at that time was the most popular Macedonian football club in the former Yugoslavia. On 8 March 1991 in Bitola FK Pelister and FK Vardar met in the Yugoslav second league and the first incident occurred. From that day forward, started the big rivalry between Komiti and Čkembari along with the Vardar–Pelister match becoming the eternal derby. In recent years the rivalry wained slightly in importance as FK Vardar stopped being as competitive.\n\nSkopje derby\n\nFK Vardar and FK Shkupi (formerly defunct FK Sloga Jugomagnat) is the main derby in the city, as both clubs have active organised support. This rivalry is drawn along ethnic lines as FK Vardar fans are Macedonians and Orthodox Christians, while FK Shkupi are Albanians . Rabotnički is the other team in Skopje with organised fans, although the rivalry is rarely manifested on the football pitch, it is widely upheld however in handball and basketball.\n\nInter-regional rivalries\n\nVardar has a strong rivalry with FK Pobeda. Like the rivalry with GFK Tikvesh. There is also a friendly \"brotherhood derby\" with FK Teteks the fans of these two clubs have been dubbed as \"Orthodox Brothers\".\n\nHonours\n\nDomestic League\n\nMacedonian First League\n\nWinners (11): 1992–93, 1993–94, 1994–95, 2001–02, 2002–03, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2019–20\n\nDomestic Cup\n\nMacedonian Football Cup\n\nWinners (5): 1992–93, 1994–95, 1997–98, 1998–99, 2006–07\n\nMacedonian Football Supercup\n\nWinners (2): 2013, 2015\n\nYugoslav Cup\n\nWinners (1): 1960–61\n\nMacedonian Republic Cup\n\nWinners (12): 1955–56, 1965–66, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69, 1969–70, 1970–71, 1971–72, 1972–73, 1979–80, 1980–81, 1991–92\n\nEuropean\n\nBalkans Cup\n\nRunners up (2): 1972, 1974\n\nEuropean history\n\nMain article: FK Vardar in European football\n\nFK Vardar's first competitive European match was a 0–5 loss against Dunfermline Athletic in the 1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup.
