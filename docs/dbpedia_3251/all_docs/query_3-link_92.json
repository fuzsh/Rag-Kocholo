S.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nBench-top helicopter is a laboratory scale helicopter that usually used as a testing bench of the real helicopter behavior. This helicopter is a 3 Degree of Freedom (DOF) helicopter which works by three different axes wshich are elevation, pitch and travel. Thus, fuzzy logic controller has been proposed to be implemented into Quanser bench-top helicopter because of its ability to work with non-linear system. The objective for this project is to design and apply fuzzy logic controller for Quanser bench-top helicopter. Other than that, fuzzy logic controller performance system has been simulated to analyze and verify its behavior over existing PID controller by using Matlab & Simulink software. In this research, fuzzy logic controller has been designed to control the elevation angle. After simulation has been performed, it can be seen that simulation result shows that fuzzy logic elevation control is working for 4Â°, 5Â° and 6Â°. These three angles produce zero steady state error and has a fast response. Other than that, performance comparisons have been performed between fuzzy logic controller and PID controller. Fuzzy logic elevation control has a better performance compared to PID controller where lower percentage overshoot and faster settling time have been achieved in 4Â°, 5Â° and 6Â° step response test. Both controller are have zero steady state error but fuzzy logic controller is managed to produce a better performance in term of settling time and percentage overshoot which make the proposed controller is reliable compared to the existing PID controller.\n\nEvaluation of a Bench Top Mechanical Delinter\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThis presentation will report on current research associated with a new mechancial delinter being developed at the Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in conjunction with Cotton Inc.

High-fidelity virtual reality simulation was superior to bench-top simulation in the acquisition of arthroscopic skills, both in the laboratory and in vivo. Further clinical investigation is needed to interpret the importance of these results.\n\nRoom 106, A laboratory with longitudinal arrangement of benches.

Dedicated test benches have been developed to measure all related quantities for the Digital Optical Modules of the KM3NeT neutrino telescope being currently deployed in the Mediterranean sea. The first bench is a black box with robotic arms equipped with a calibrated single photon source or laser which enable a precise mapping of the detection efficiency at arbitrary incident angles as well as precise measurements of the time delays induced by the photodetection chain. These measurement can be incorporated and compared to full GEANT MonteCarlo simulations of the optical modules. The second bench is a 2 mÃ2 m Ã2 m water tank equipped with muon hodoscopes on top and bottom. It enables to study and measure the angular dependence of the DOM's detection efficiency of the Cherenkov light produced in water by relativistic muons, thus reproducing in situ detection conditions. We describe these two benches and present their first results and status.\n\nRoom 113, chemistry laboratory with benches perpendicular to the long ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nRoom 113, chemistry laboratory with benches perpendicular to the long axis of the room.

Three different bioreactors were used: 3 l stirred tank reactor (STR-1) equipped with two different six-blade turbines; STR as above but equipped with a three-blade marine propeller plus draft-tube (STR-2); 2 l air-lift column reactor (ALR) equipped with an external loop. STR-1, tested at three different stirrer speeds (300, 500 and 700 rev min(-1)) appeared to be less suitable for beta-glucan production by the fungus, being maximum production (19.4 g l(-1)), productivity (0.42 g l(-1) h(-1)) and yield (0.48 g g(-1) of glucose consumed) markedly lower than those obtained in shaken culture (29.7 g l(-1), 1.23 g l(-1) h(-1) and 0.61 g g(-1), respectively). Better performances were obtained with both STR-2 and ALR. With the latter, in particular, the increase of production was accompanied by reduced fermentation time (25.7 g l(-1) after only 22 h); productivity and yield were highest (1.17 g l(-1) h(-1) and 0.62 g g(-1) of glucose consumed, respectively). Using an air-lift reactor with external loop, the scaling up from shaken flasks to bench-top bioreactor of the beta-glucan production by B. rhodina DABAC-P82 is technically feasible. Although culture conditions are still to be optimized, the results obtained using the ARL are highly promising.\n\nCavitation Enhancing Nanodroplets Mediate Efficient DNA Fragmentation in a Bench Top Ultrasonic Water Bath\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMalc, Ewa P.; Jayakody, Chatura N.; Tsuruta, James K.; Mieczkowski, Piotr A.; Janzen, William P.; Dayton, Paul A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA perfluorocarbon nanodroplet formulation is shown to be an effective cavitation enhancement agent, enabling rapid and consistent fragmentation of genomic DNA in a standard ultrasonic water bath. This nanodroplet-enhanced method produces genomic DNA libraries and next-generation sequencing results indistinguishable from DNA samples fragmented in dedicated commercial acoustic sonication equipment, and with higher throughput. This technique thus enables widespread access to fast bench-top genomic DNA fragmentation.

The bacterial culture contained within a polycarbonate carboy is mixed (400-600 rpm) and aerated (1 vessel vol./min) by a high-shear radial flow impeller mounted on a hollow stainless steel shaft, through which pressurised air is pumped. Air is dispersed as fine bubbles into the culture medium by the turbine impeller, without the need for a porous sparger. A stainless steel baffle stabilised by a gliding counterweight increases mixing. The components can easily be disassembled for cleaning and sterilisation. Temperature (range 20-37 degrees C) and pH (range 7.0-7.5) are controlled manually. Using the apparatus, it proved possible to achieve Escherichia coli cell culture densities equivalent to an optical density at 600 nm (OD(600)) of 30-32, compared with OD(600) 4-6 in shake flasks. A yield of 40 mg/litre/day of a recombinant antibody fragment was obtained with the fermenter, which was 15-fold more than the yield of 2.5mg/litre/day achieved in shake flasks. The fermenter may be particularly suited for research purposes.\n\nDevelopment of a solar charged laboratory bench power supply\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAyara, W. A.; Omotosho, T.

It is capable of delivering low voltage Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) to carry out basic laboratory experiment for both secondary schools and also at higher education institutions. The power supply is capable of delivering fixed DC voltages of 5V, 9V, 12V, variable voltage of between 1.25-30V and a 12V AC voltage. Also Incorporated is a USB port that allows for charging cell phones and other mobile devices, and a dedicated 12V DC output to power 5-7 Watt LED bulb to provide illumination in the laboratory for the instructor who may need to work at night in the absence of utility power.\n\nComparison of Portable and Bench-Top Spectrometers for Mid-Infrared Diffuse Reflectance Measurements of Soils.\n\nPubMed\n\nHutengs, Christopher; Ludwig, Bernard; Jung, AndrÃ¡s; Eisele, Andreas; Vohland, Michael\n\n2018-03-27\n\nMid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has received widespread interest as a method to complement traditional soil analysis. Recently available portable MIR spectrometers additionally offer potential for on-site applications, given sufficient spectral data quality. We therefore tested the performance of the Agilent 4300 Handheld FTIR (DRIFT spectra) in comparison to a Bruker Tensor 27 bench-top instrument in terms of (i) spectral quality and measurement noise quantified by wavelet analysis; (ii) accuracy of partial least squares (PLS) calibrations for soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), pH, clay and sand content with a repeated cross-validation analysis; and (iii) key spectral regions for these soil properties identified with a Monte Carlo spectral variable selection approach. Measurements and multivariate calibrations with the handheld device were as good as or slightly better than Bruker equipped with a DRIFT accessory, but not as accurate as with directional hemispherical reflectance (DHR) data collected with an integrating sphere. Variations in noise did not markedly affect the accuracy of multivariate PLS calibrations. Identified key spectral regions for PLS calibrations provided a good match between Agilent and Bruker DHR data, especially for SOC and N. Our findings suggest that portable FTIR instruments are a viable alternative for MIR measurements in the laboratory and offer great potential for on-site applications.\n\nPerformance evaluation of the Abbott CELL-DYN Emerald for use as a bench-top analyzer in a research setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhoo, T-L; Xiros, N; Guan, F; Orellana, D; Holst, J; Joshua, D E; Rasko, J E J\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe CELL-DYN Emerald is a compact bench-top hematology analyzer that can be used for a three-part white cell differential analysis. To determine its utility for analysis of human and mouse samples, we evaluated this machine against the larger CELL-DYN Sapphire and Sysmex XT2000iV hematology analyzers. 120 human (normal and abnormal) and 30 mouse (normal and abnormal) samples were analyzed on both the CELL-DYN Emerald and CELL-DYN Sapphire or Sysmex XT2000iV analyzers. For mouse samples, the CELL-DYN Emerald analyzer required manual recalibration based on the histogram populations. Analysis of the CELL-DYN Emerald showed excellent precision, within accepted ranges (white cell count CV% = 2.09%; hemoglobin CV% = 1.68%; platelets CV% = 4.13%). Linearity was excellent (RÂ² â¥ 0.99), carryover was minimal (<1%), and overall interinstrument agreement was acceptable for both human and mouse samples. Comparison between the CELL-DYN Emerald and Sapphire analyzers for human samples or Sysmex XT2000iV analyzer for mouse samples showed excellent correlation for all parameters. The CELL-DYN Emerald was generally comparable to the larger reference analyzer for both human and mouse samples. It would be suitable for use in satellite research laboratories or as a backup system in larger laboratories.

The proposed photon-counting breast CT system and a bench-top prototype photon-counting breast CT system were simulated using a simulation package written in matlab to determine the smallest detectable Î¼Ca. A 14 cm diameter cylindrical phantom made of breast tissue with 20% glandularity was used to simulate an average-sized breast. Five different size groups of calcium carbonate grains, from 100 to 180 Î¼m in diameter, were simulated inside of the cylindrical phantom. The images were acquired with a mean glandular dose (MGD) in the range of 0.7-8 mGy. A total of 400 images was used to perform a reader study. Another simulation study was performed using a 1.6 cm diameter cylindrical phantom to validate the experimental results from a bench-top prototype breast CT system. In the experimental study, a bench-top prototype CT system was constructed using a tungsten anode x-ray source and a single line 256-pixels Si strip photon-counting detector with a pixel pitch of 100 Î¼m. Calcium carbonate grains, with diameter in the range of 105-215 Î¼m, were embedded in a cylindrical plastic resin phantom to simulate Î¼Cas. The physical phantoms were imaged at 65 kVp with an entrance exposure in the range of 0.6-8 mGy. A total of 500 images was used to perform another reader study. The images were displayed in random order to three blinded observers, who were asked to give a 4-point confidence rating on each image regarding the presence of Î¼Ca. The Î¼Ca detectability for each image was evaluated by using the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) across the readers. The simulation results using a 14 cm diameter breast phantom showed that the proposed photon-counting breast CT system can achieve high detection accuracy with an average AUC greater\n\nBench-Top Feasibility Testing of a Novel Percutaneous Renal Access Technique: The Laser Direct Alignment Radiation Reduction Technique (DARRT).\n\nPubMed\n\nKhater, Nazih; Shen, Jim; Arenas, Javier; Keheila, Mohamed; Alsyouf, Muhannad; Martin, Jacob A; Lightfoot, Michelle A; Li, Roger; Olgin, Gaudencio; Smith, Jason C; Baldwin, D Duane\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTraditional techniques for obtaining percutaneous renal access utilize continuous fluoroscopy. In an attempt to minimize radiation exposure, we describe a novel laser direct alignment radiation reduction technique (DARRT) for percutaneous access and test it in a bench-top model. In this randomized-controlled bench-top study, 20 medical personnel obtained renal accesses using both the conventional bullseye technique and the laser DARRT. The primary endpoint was total fluoroscopy time. Secondary endpoints included insertion time, puncture attempts, course corrections, and subjective procedural difficulty. In the laser DARRT, fluoroscopy was used with the C-arm positioned with the laser beam at a 30Â° angle. The access needle and hub were aligned with the laser beam. Effective caliceal puncture was confirmed with fluoroscopy and direct vision. The Paired samples Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis with significance at pâ<â0.05. A total of 120 needle placements were recorded. Fluoroscopy time for needle access using the laser DARRT was significantly lower than the bullseye technique in all groups as follows: attendings (7.09 vs 18.51 seconds; pâ<â0.001), residents (6.55 vs 13.93 seconds; pâ=â0.001), and medical students (6.69 vs 20.22 seconds; pâ<â0.001). Students rated the laser DARRT easier to use (2.56 vs 4.89; pâ<â0.001). No difference was seen in total access time, puncture attempts, or course corrections between techniques. The laser DARRT reduced fluoroscopy time by 63%, compared with the conventional bullseye technique. The least experienced users found the laser DARRT significantly easier to learn. This novel technique is promising and merits additional testing in animal and human models.\n\nEvaluation of malodor for automobile air conditioner evaporator by using laboratory-scale test cooling bench.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Kyung Hwan; Kim, Sun Hwa; Jung, Young Rim; Kim, Man Goo\n\n2008-09-12\n\nAs one of the measures to improve the environment in an automobile, malodor caused by the automobile air-conditioning system evaporator was evaluated and analyzed using laboratory-scale test cooling bench. The odor was simulated with an evaporator test cooling bench equipped with an airflow controller, air temperature and relative humidity controller. To simulate the same odor characteristics that occur from automobiles, one previously used automobile air conditioner evaporator associated with unpleasant odors was selected. The odor was evaluated by trained panels and collected with aluminum polyester bags. Collected samples were analyzed by thermal desorption into a cryotrap and subsequent gas chromatographic separation, followed by simultaneous olfactometry, flame ionization detector and identified by atomic emission detection and mass spectrometry. Compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids were identified as responsible odor-active compounds. Gas chromatography/flame ionization detection/olfactometry combined sensory method with instrumental analysis was very effective as an odor evaluation method in an automobile air-conditioning system evaporator.\n\nSP2Bench: A SPARQL Performance Benchmark\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchmidt, Michael; Hornung, Thomas; Meier, Michael; Pinkel, Christoph; Lausen, Georg\n\nA meaningful analysis and comparison of both existing storage schemes for RDF data and evaluation approaches for SPARQL queries necessitates a comprehensive and universal benchmark platform. We present SP2Bench, a publicly available, language-specific performance benchmark for the SPARQL query language. SP2Bench is settled in the DBLP scenario and comprises a data generator for creating arbitrarily large DBLP-like documents and a set of carefully designed benchmark queries. The generated documents mirror vital key characteristics and social-world distributions encountered in the original DBLP data set, while the queries implement meaningful requests on top of this data, covering a variety of SPARQL operator constellations and RDF access patterns. In this chapter, we discuss requirements and desiderata for SPARQL benchmarks and present the SP2Bench framework, including its data generator, benchmark queries and performance metrics.\n\nBench-Top Antigen Detection Technique that Utilizes Nanofiltration and Fluorescent Dyes which Emit and Absorb Light in the Near Infrared\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVaraljay-Spence, Vanessa A.; Scardelletti, Maximilian C.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis article discusses the development of a bench-top technique to detect antigens in fluids. The technique involves the use of near infrared NIR fluorescent dyes conjugated to antibodies, centrifugation, nanofilters, and spectrometry. The system used to detect the antigens utilizes a spectrometer, fiber optic cables, NIR laser, and laptop computer thus making it portable and ideally suited for desk top analysis. Using IgM as an antigen and the secondary antibody, anti-IgM conjugated to the near infrared dye, IRDye (trademark) 800, for detection, we show that nanofiltration can efficiently and specifically separate antibody-antigen complexes in solution and that the complexes can be detected by a spectrometer and software using NIR laser excitation at 778 nm and NIR dye offset emission at 804 nm. The peak power detected at 778 nm for the excitation emission and at 804 nm for the offset emission is 879 pW (-60.06 dBm) and 35.7 pW (-74.5 dBm), respectively.\n\nElbow joint fatigue and bench-press training.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Yen-Po; Chou, You-Li; Chen, Feng-Chun; Wang, Rong-Tyai; Huang, Ming-Jer; Chou, Paul Pei-Hsi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBench-press exercises are among the most common form of training exercise for the upper extremity because they yield a notable improvement in both muscle strength and muscle endurance. The literature contains various investigations into the effects of different bench-press positions on the degree of muscle activation. However, the effects of fatigue on the muscular performance and kinetics of the elbow joint are not understood fully. To investigate the effects of fatigue on the kinetics and myodynamic performance of the elbow joint in bench-press training. Controlled laboratory study. Motion research laboratory. A total of 18 physically healthy male students (age = 19.6 Â± 0.8 years, height = 168.7 Â± 5.5 cm, mass = 69.6 Â± 8.6 kg) participated in the investigation. All participants were right-hand dominant, and none had a history of upper extremity injuries or disorders. Participants performed bench-press training until fatigued. Maximal possible number of repetitions, cycle time, myodynamic decline rate, elbow-joint force, and elbow-joint moment. We observed a difference in cycle time in the initial (2.1 Â± 0.42 seconds) and fatigue (2.58 Â± 0.46 seconds) stages of the bench-press exercise (P = .04). As the participants fatigued, we observed an increase in the medial-lateral force (P = .03) and internal-external moment (P â¤ .04) acting on the elbow joint. Moreover, a reduction in the elbow muscle strength was observed in the elbow extension-flexion (P â¤ .003) and forearm supination-pronation (P â¤ .001) conditions. The results suggest that performing bench-press exercises to the point of fatigue increases elbow-joint loading and may further increase the risk of injury. Therefore, when clinicians design bench-press exercise regimens for general athletic training, muscle strengthening, or physical rehabilitation, they should control carefully the maximal number of repetitions.\n\nA bench-top hyperspectral imaging system to classify beef from Nellore cattle based on tenderness\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNubiato, Keni Eduardo Zanoni; Mazon, Madeline Rezende; Antonelo, Daniel Silva; Calkins, Chris R.; Naganathan, Govindarajan Konda; Subbiah, Jeyamkondan; da Luz e Silva, Saulo\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of classification of Nellore beef aged for 0, 7, 14, or 21 days and classification based on tenderness and aging period using a bench-top hyperspectral imaging system. A hyperspectral imaging system (Î» = 928-2524 nm) was used to collect hyperspectral images of the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum (aging n = 376 and tenderness n = 345) of Nellore cattle. The image processing steps included selection of region of interest, extraction of spectra, and indentification and evalution of selected wavelengths for classification. Six linear discriminant models were developed to classify samples based on tenderness and aging period. The model using the first derivative of partial absorbance spectra (give wavelength range spectra) was able to classify steaks based on the tenderness with an overall accuracy of 89.8%. The model using the first derivative of full absorbance spectra was able to classify steaks based on aging period with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. The results demonstrate that the HIS may be a viable technology for classifying beef based on tenderness and aging period.\n\nDevelopment of a new bench for puncturing of irradiated fuel rods in STAR hot laboratory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetitprez, B.; Silvestre, P.; Valenza, P.; Boulore, A.; David, T.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA new device for puncturing of irradiated fuel rods in commercial power plants has been designed by Fuel Research Department of CEA Cadarache in order to provide experimental data of high precision on fuel pins with various designs. It will replace the current set-up that has been used since 1998 in hot cell 2 of STAR facility with more than 200 rod puncturing experiments. Based on this consistent experimental feedback, the heavy-duty technique of rod perforation by clad punching has been preserved for the new bench. The method of double expansion of rod gases is also retained since it allows upgrading the confidence interval of volumetric results obtained from rod puncturing. Furthermore, many evolutions have been introduced in the new design in order to improve its reliability, to make the maintenance easier by remote handling and to reduce experimental uncertainties. Tightness components have been studied with Sealing Laboratory Maestral at Pierrelatte so as to make them able to work under mixed pressure conditions (from vacuum at 10-5 mbar up to pressure at 50 bars) and to lengthen their lifetime under permanent gamma irradiation in hot cell. Bench ergonomics has been optimized to make its operating by remote handling easier and to secure the critical phases of a puncturing experiment. A high pressure gas line equipped with high precision pressure sensors out of cell can be connected to the bench in cell for calibration purposes. Uncertainty analyses using Monte Carlo calculations have been performed in order to optimize capacity of the different volumes of the apparatus according to volumetric characteristics of the rod to be punctured. At last this device is composed of independent modules which allow puncturing fuel pins out of different geometries (PWR, BWR, VVER). After leak tests of the device and remote handling simulation in a mock-up cell, several punctures of calibrated specimens have been performed in 2016. The bench will be implemented soon in hot\n\nElbow Joint Fatigue and Bench-Press Training\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Yen-Po; Chou, You-Li; Chen, Feng-Chun; Wang, Rong-Tyai; Huang, Ming-Jer; Chou, Paul Pei-Hsi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nContext: Bench-press exercises are among the most common form of training exercise for the upper extremity because they yield a notable improvement in both muscle strength and muscle endurance.

The study was aimed at comparing the observed total error (TEobs ) derived from meta-analysis of published method validation data to the total allowable error (TEa ) for veterinary hematology variables in small animals based on experts' opinions. Ideally, TEobs should be < TEa . An online survey was sent to veterinary experts in clinical pathology and small animal internal medicine for providing the maximal allowable deviation from a given result for each variable. Percent of TEa = (allowable median deviation/clinical threshold) * 100%. Second, TEobs for 3 laser-based bench top hematology analyzers (ADVIA 2120; Sysmex XT2000iV, and CellDyn 3500) was calculated based on method validation studies published between 2005 and 2013 (n = 4). The percent TEobs = 2 * CV (%) + bias (%). The CV was derived from published studies except for the ADVIA 2120 (internal data), and bias was estimated from the regression equation. A total of 41 veterinary experts (19 diplomates, 8 residents, 10 postgraduate students, 4 anonymous specialists) responded. The proposed range of TEa was wide, but generally â¤ 20%. The TEobs was < TEa for all variables and analyzers except for canine and feline HGB (high bias, low CV) and platelet counts (high bias, high CV). Overall, veterinary bench top analyzers fulfilled experts' requirements except for HGB due to method-related bias, and platelet counts due to known preanalytic/analytic issues.

Recently introduced high-throughput bench-top DNA sequencing platforms have the potential to overcome these limitations. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms for molecular diagnostics. The protein-coding regions of six genes associated with inherited arrhythmia syndromes were amplified from 15 human samples using parallelised multiplex PCR (Access Array, Fluidigm), and sequenced on the MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). Overall, 97.9% of the target was sequenced adequately for variant calling on the MiSeq, and 96.8% on the Ion Torrent PGM. Regions missed tended to be of high GC-content, and most were problematic for both platforms. Variant calling was assessed using 107 variants detected using Sanger sequencing: within adequately sequenced regions, variant calling on both platforms was highly accurate (Sensitivity: MiSeq 100%, PGM 99.1%. Positive predictive value: MiSeq 95.9%, PGM 95.5%). At the time of the study the Ion Torrent PGM had a lower capital cost and individual runs were cheaper and faster. The MiSeq had a higher capacity (requiring fewer runs), with reduced hands-on time and simpler laboratory workflows. Both provide significant cost and time savings over conventional methods, even allowing for adjunct Sanger sequencing to validate findings and sequence exons missed by NGS. Conclusions/Significance MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM both provide accurate variant detection as part of a PCR-based molecular diagnostic workflow, and provide alternative platforms for molecular diagnosis of inherited cardiac conditions. Though there were performance differences at this throughput, platforms differed primarily in terms of cost, scalability, protocol stability and ease of use.

However, it is a destructive technique, requiring samples to be homogenised by grinding to a fine powder and formed into a compacted pellet, or fused glass disk and the resulting sample has to be completely flat for reliable analysis. Until recently, non-destructive, high spatial resolution Âµ- XRF analysis was possible only at specialised Synchrotron radiation facilities, where high excitation beam energies are possible and specialised X-ray focussing optical systems are available. Recently, a number of bench-top Âµ-XRF systems have become available, allowing easy, rapid and non-destructive geochemical analysis of various materials. We present a number of examples of how the new bench-top M4 Tornado Âµ-XRF system, developed by Bruker Nano, can be used to provide valuable geochemical information on geological samples. Both quantitative and qualitative (in the form of X-Ray area-maps) data can be quickly and easily acquired for a wide range of elements (as light as Na, using a vacuum), with minimal sample preparation, using an X-Ray spot size as low as 25 Âµm. Large specimens up to 30 cm and 5 kg in weight can be analysed due to the large sample chamber, allowing non-destructive characterisation of rare or valuable materials. This technique is particularly useful in characterising heterogeneous samples, such as drill cores, sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks containing a variety of clasts, lavas sourced from mixed and mingled magmas, mineralised samples and fossils. An obvious application is the ability to produce element maps or line-scans of minerals, allowing zoning of major and trace elements to be identified and thus informing on crystallisation histories. An application of particular interest to 40Ar/39Ar geochronologists is the ability to screen and assess the purity of mineral separates, or to characterise polished slabs for\n\nBench-top endomicroscope for visualization and imaging of nuclei using ultraviolet autofluorescence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLin, Bevin\n\nThe long range goal of this research was to develop autofluorescence technology and instrumentation for transition towards an in vivo endomicroscopy imaging system. This approach would provide resolution sufficient to image nuclei for real-time categorization of normal and abnormal tissue implicative of disease progression. Esophageal adenocarcinoma was the chosen model to develop this diagnostic imaging system because the heterogeneous and multifocal nature of this disease makes early diagnosis extremely challenging during the window of time when the prognosis for survival is high. The asymptomatic character of this disease generally presents at a malignant stage when removal of the esophagus has become the standard treatment. The traditional gold standard of histologic diagnosis suffers from a slow turn-around-time from tissue removal to microscopic observation, compounded by error in random biopsy sampling and tissue-processing artifacts, in addition to significant variation in pathologist diagnosis. Optical biopsy has thus been developed to alleviate the problems associated with current standard video endoscopy and histopathology. Following tremendous research in the realm of optical biopsy, some traction has been gained using confocal endomicroscopy. However, current confocal methods require contrast agents and optical sectioning in order to provide images at a cellular level. We have developed a minimally invasive imaging system using autofluorescence that highlights the short photon penetration depth of ultraviolet excitation. This approach provides cellular level resolution with a clinically relevant field of view without requiring contrast agents or optical sectioning. Optical histopathology has been demonstrated using unprocessed ex vivo human gastrointestinal tissues providing diagnostic assessment in real-time, a function imperative for improved patient care and quality of life. This robust bench-top prototype endomicroscopy system is capable of rapid\n\n17.

A pipetting error can cause a switch in patient samples, which can lead to recording the wrong results for the patient samples involved. Such pipetting errors are difficult to identify when it happens in lab bench work. DNA fingerprinting is a powerful tool in determining sample identities. Our laboratory has explored the usage of this technology in our QA process and successfully established that DNA fingerprinting can be used to monitor possible sample switch in gene rearrangement lab bench work. We use florescent light to quench the florescence in the gene rearrangement polymerase chain reaction products. After that, DNA fingerprinting technology is used to identify the sample DNA in the gene rearrangement polymerase chain reaction plate. The result is compared with the corresponding patient's blood sample DNA to determine whether there is a sample switch during the lab bench work.\n\nBench-Top Fabrication of an All-PDMS Microfluidic Electrochemical Cell Sensor Integrating Micro/Nanostructured Electrodes.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaem, Sokunthearath; Zhu, Yujie; Luu, Helen; Moran-Mirabal, Jose\n\n2017-03-31\n\nIn recent years, efforts in the development of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) devices for point-of-care (PoC) applications have increased to bring affordable, portable, and sensitive diagnostics to the patients' bedside. To reach this goal, research has shifted from using traditional microfabrication methods to more versatile, rapid, and low-cost options. This work focuses on the benchtop fabrication of a highly sensitive, fully transparent, and flexible poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic (Î¼F) electrochemical cell sensor. The Î¼F device encapsulates 3D structured gold and platinum electrodes, fabricated using a shape-memory polymer shrinking method, which are used to set up an on-chip electrochemical cell. The PDMS to PDMS-structured electrode bonding protocol to fabricate the Î¼F chip was optimized and found to have sufficient bond strength to withstand up to 100 mL/min flow rates. The sensing capabilities of the on-chip electrochemical cell were demonstrated by using cyclic voltammetry to monitor the adhesion of murine 3T3 fibroblasts in the presence of a redox reporter. The charge transfer across the working electrode was reduced upon cell adhesion, which was used as the detection mechanism, and allowed the detection of as few as 24 cells. The effective utilization of simple and low cost bench-top fabrication methods could accelerate the prototyping and development of LoC technologies and bring PoC diagnostics and personalized medicine to the patients' bedside.\n\nBench-Top Fabrication of an All-PDMS Microfluidic Electrochemical Cell Sensor Integrating Micro/Nanostructured Electrodes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSaem, Sokunthearath; Zhu, Yujie; Luu, Helen; Moran-Mirabal, Jose\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn recent years, efforts in the development of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) devices for point-of-care (PoC) applications have increased to bring affordable, portable, and sensitive diagnostics to the patientsâ bedside.

The state-of-the-art Propulsion Research Laboratory will serve as a leading national resource for advanced space propulsion research. Its purpose is to conduct research that will lead to the creation and development of irnovative propulsion technologies for space exploration. The facility will be the epicenter of the effort to move the U.S. space program beyond the confines of conventional chemical propulsion into an era of greatly improved access to space and rapid transit throughout the solar system. The Laboratory is designed to accommodate researchers from across the United States, including scientists and engineers from NASA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, universities, and industry. The facility, with 66,000 square feet of useable laboratory space, will feature a high degree of experimental capability. Its flexibility will allow it to address a broad range of propulsion technologies and concepts, such as plasma, electromagnetic, thermodynamic, and propellantless propulsion. An important area of emphasis will be development and utilization of advanced energy sources, including highly energetic chemical reactions, solar energy, and processes based on fission, fusion, and antimatter. The Propulsion Research Laboratory is vital for developing the advanced propulsion technologies needed to open up the space frontier, and will set the stage of research that could revolutionize space transportation for a broad range of applications.

Fourteen healthy resistance trained males (age 21.4 Â± 0.4 years) participated in this study. One set of six repetitions for each bench press conditions at 65% one repetition maximum were performed. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was utilised to examine the muscular activation of the selected muscles during the eccentric and concentric phases. In addition, each phase was subdivided into 25% contraction durations, resulting in four separate time points for comparison between bench conditions. The sEMG of upper pectoralis displayed no difference during any of the bench conditions when examining the complete concentric contraction, however differences during 26-50% contraction duration were found for both the 30Â° [122.5 Â± 10.1% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)] and 45Â° (124 Â± 9.1% MVIC) bench condition, resulting in greater sEMG compared to horizontal (98.2 Â± 5.4% MVIC) and -15 (96.1 Â± 5.5% MVIC). The sEMG of lower pectoralis was greater during -15Â° (100.4 Â± 5.7% MVIC), 30Â° (86.6 Â± 4.8% MVIC) and horizontal (100.1 Â± 5.2% MVIC) bench conditions compared to the 45Â° (71.9 Â± 4.5% MVIC) for the whole concentric contraction. The results of this study support the use of a horizontal bench to achieve muscular activation of both the upper and lower heads of the pectoralis. However, a bench incline angle of 30Â° or 45Â° resulted in greater muscular activation during certain time points, suggesting that it is important to consider how muscular activation is affected at various time points when selecting bench press exercises.\n\nRelationship of pectoralis major muscle size with bench press and bench throw performances.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkagi, Ryota; Tohdoh, Yukihiro; Hirayama, Kuniaki; Kobayashi, Yuji\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThis study examined the relationship of muscle size indices of the pectoralis major muscle with bench press and bench throw performances in 18 male collegiate athletes. The maximal cross-sectional area (MCSAMAx) and volume (MV) of the pectoralis major muscle were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. First, subjects were tested for their one repetition maximum bench press strength (1RMBP) using a Smith machine. At a later date, subjects performed bench throws using the Smith machine with several different loads ranging from 30.0 kg to 90% of 1RMBP. Barbell positions were measured by a linear position transducer, and bench throw power was calculated using a dynamic equation. Three trials were performed for each load. In all the trials, the maximal peak power was adopted as bench throw peak power (PPBT). The 1RMBP was significantly correlated with MCSAMAx. Similarly, the correlation coefficient between MV and PPBT was significant. In contrast to the y-intercept of the MV-PPBT regression line, that of the MCSAMAx-1RMBP regression line was not significantly different from 0. These results suggested that, although the dependence on pectoralis major muscle size is slightly different between bench press strength and bench throw power, the pectoralis major muscle size has a significant impact on bench press and throw performances. Greater muscle size leads to heavier body weight, which can be a negative factor in some sports. We therefore recommend that athletes and their coaches develop training programs for improving sports performance by balancing the advantage of increased muscle size and the potential disadvantage of increased body weight.\n\nTest bench HEATREC for heat loss measurement on solar receiver tubes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ¡rquez, JosÃ© M.; LÃ³pez-MartÃ­n, Rafael; Valenzuela, Loreto; Zarza, Eduardo\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn Solar Thermal Electricity (STE) plants the thermal energy of solar radiation is absorbed by solar receiver tubes (HCEs) and it is transferred to a heat transfer fluid. Therefore, heat losses of receiver tubes have a direct influence on STE plants efficiency. A new test bench called HEATREC has been developed by Plataforma Solar de AlmerÃ­a (PSA) in order to determinate the heat losses of receiver tubes under laboratory conditions. The innovation of this test bench consists in the possibility to determine heat losses under controlled vacuum.\n\nNew Improvements in Magnetic Measurements Laboratory of the ALBA Synchrotron Facility\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampmany, Josep; Marcos, Jordi; Massana, ValentÃ­\n\nALBA synchrotron facility has a complete insertion devices (ID) laboratory to characterize and produce magnetic devices needed to satisfy the requirements of ALBA's user community. The laboratory is equipped with a Hall-probe bench working in on-the-fly measurement mode allowing the measurement of field maps of big magnetic structures with high accuracy, both in magnetic field magnitude and position. The whole control system of this bench is based on TANGO. The Hall probe calibration range extends between sub-Gauss to 2 Tesla with an accuracy of 100 ppm. Apart from the Hall probe bench, the ID laboratory has a flipping coil bench dedicated to measuring field integrals and a Helmholtz coil bench specially designed to characterize permanent magnet blocks. Also, a fixed stretched wire bench is used to measure field integrals of magnet sets. This device is specifically dedicated to ID construction. Finally, the laboratory is equipped with a rotating coil bench, specially designed for measuring multipolar devices used in accelerators, such as quadrupoles, sextupoles, etc. Recent improvements of the magnetic measurements laboratory of ALBA synchrotron include the design and manufacturing of very thin 3D Hall probe heads, the design and manufacturing of coil sensors for the Rotating coil bench based on multilayered PCB, and the improvement of calibration methodology in order to improve the accuracy of the measurements. ALBA magnetic measurements laboratory is open for external contracts, and has been widely used by national and international institutes such as CERN, ESRF or CIEMAT, as well as magnet manufacturing companies, such as ANTEC, TESLA and I3 M. In this paper, we will present the main features of the measurement benches as well as improvements made so far.\n\nDATA QUALITY OBJECTIVES FOR SELECTING WASTE SAMPLES FOR BENCH-SCALE REFORMER TREATABILITY STUDIES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBANNING DL\n\n2011-02-11\n\nThis document describes the data quality objectives to select archived samples located at the 222-S Laboratory for Bench-Scale Reforming testing. The type, quantity, and quality of the data required to select the samples for Fluid Bed Steam Reformer testing are discussed. In order to maximize the efficiency and minimize the time to treat Hanford tank waste in the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant, additional treatment processes may be required.

On the other side, industry, particularly startups, prioritize technology development for clinical and commercial translation. The paper presents personal experience as a case study. University based researchers, faculty and students, might participate in and benefit from such an entrepreneurial activity. A University spin off would facilitate translational of bench research ideas and results to technologies for bedside use. Attention to issues such as conflict of interest and concern and ethics of working with human subjects need to be managed by the investigators and the institution. While entrepreneurial activity is not for everyone, it does provide the benefit and satisfaction to see research reach practice.\n\nAssociation Between Maximal Bench Press Strength and Isometric Handgrip Strength Among Breast Cancer Survivors.\n\nPubMed\n\nRogers, Benjamin H; Brown, Justin C; Gater, David R; Schmitz, Kathryn H\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo characterize the relationship between 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) bench press strength and isometric handgrip strength among breast cancer survivors. Cross-sectional study. Laboratory. Community-dwelling breast cancer survivors (N=295). Not applicable. 1-RM bench press strength was measured with a barbell and exercise bench. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using an isometric dynamometer, with 3 maximal contractions of the left and right hands. All measures were conducted by staff with training in clinical exercise testing. Among 295 breast cancer survivors, 1-RM bench press strength was 18.2Â±6.1kg (range, 2.2-43.0kg), and isometric handgrip strength was 23.5Â±5.8kg (range, 9.0-43.0kg). The strongest correlate of 1-RM bench press strength was the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (r=.399; P<.0001). Mean difference analysis suggested that the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands overestimated 1-RM bench press strength by 4.7kg (95% limits of agreement, -8.2 to 17.6kg). In a multivariable linear regression model, the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (Î²=.31; P<.0001) and age (Î²=-.20; P<.0001) were positively correlated with 1-RM bench press strength (R 2 =.23). Isometric handgrip strength is a poor surrogate for 1-RM bench press strength among breast cancer survivors. 1-RM bench press strength and isometric handgrip strength quantify distinct components of muscular strength.

The mechanical model was based on rigid segments connected by revolute and prismatic pairs, which enabled a kinematic approach and global force estimation. The method requires only three simple measurements: (i) horizontal position of the hand (x(0)); (ii) vertical displacement of the barbell (Z) and (iii) elbow angle (theta). Eight adult male throwers performed maximal concentric bench press exercises against different masses. The kinematic results showed that the vertical displacement of each segment and the global centre of mass followed the vertical displacement of the lifted mass. Consequently, the vertical velocity and acceleration of the combined centre of mass and the lifted mass were identical. Finally, for each lifted mass, there were no practical differences between forces calculated from the bench press model and those simultaneously measured with a force platform. The error was lower than 2.5%. The validity of the mechanical method was also highlighted by a standard error of the estimate (SEE) ranging from 2.0 to 6.6N in absolute terms, a coefficient of variation (CV) < or =0.8%, and a correlation between the two scores > or =0.99 for all the lifts (p<0.001). The method described here, which is based on three simple parameters, allows accurate evaluation of the force developed by the upper limb muscles during bench press exercises in both field and laboratory conditions.\n\nProspective Evaluation of a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption IonizationâTime of Flight Mass Spectrometry System in a Hospital Clinical Microbiology Laboratory for Identification of Bacteria and Yeasts: a Bench-by-Bench Study for Assessing the Impact on Time to Identification and Cost-Effectiveness\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTan, K. E.; Ellis, B. C.; Lee, R.; Stamper, P. D.; Zhang, S. X.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationâtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been found to be an accurate, rapid, and inexpensive method for the identification of bacteria and yeasts. Previous evaluations have compared the accuracy, time to identification, and costs of the MALDI-TOF MS method against standard identification systems or commercial panels. In this prospective study, we compared a protocol incorporating MALDI-TOF MS (MALDI protocol) with the current standard identification protocols (standard protocol) to determine the performance in actual practice using a specimen-based, bench-by-bench approach. The potential impact on time to identification (TTI) and costs had MALDI-TOF MS been the first-line identification method was quantitated. The MALDI protocol includes supplementary tests, notably for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Shigella, and indications for repeat MALDI-TOF MS attempts, often not measured in previous studies. A total of 952 isolates (824 bacterial isolates and 128 yeast isolates) recovered from 2,214 specimens were assessed using the MALDI protocol. Compared with standard protocols, the MALDI protocol provided identifications 1.45 days earlier on average (P < 0.001). In our laboratory, we anticipate that the incorporation of the MALDI protocol can reduce reagent and labor costs of identification by $102,424 or 56.9% within 12 months. The model included the fixed annual costs of the MALDI-TOF MS, such as the cost of protein standards and instrument maintenance, and the annual prevalence of organisms encountered in our laboratory. This comprehensive cost analysis model can be generalized to other moderate- to high-volume laboratories.

The MALDI protocol includes supplementary tests, notably for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Shigella, and indications for repeat MALDI-TOF MS attempts, often not measured in previous studies. A total of 952 isolates (824 bacterial isolates and 128 yeast isolates) recovered from 2,214 specimens were assessed using the MALDI protocol. Compared with standard protocols, the MALDI protocol provided identifications 1.45 days earlier on average (P < 0.001). In our laboratory, we anticipate that the incorporation of the MALDI protocol can reduce reagent and labor costs of identification by $102,424 or 56.9% within 12 months. The model included the fixed annual costs of the MALDI-TOF MS, such as the cost of protein standards and instrument maintenance, and the annual prevalence of organisms encountered in our laboratory. This comprehensive cost analysis model can be generalized to other moderate- to high-volume laboratories.\n\nThe Association between Maximal Bench Press Strength and Isometric Handgrip Strength among Breast Cancer Survivors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRogers, Benjamin H.; Brown, Justin C.; Gater, David R.; Schmitz, Kathryn H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective One-repetition maximum (1-RM) bench press strength is considered the gold standard to quantify upper-body muscular strength. Isometric handgrip strength is frequently used as a surrogate for 1-RM bench press strength among breast cancer (BrCa) survivors. The relationship between 1-RM bench press strength and isometric handgrip strength, however, has not been characterized among BrCa survivors. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Laboratory. Participants Community-dwelling BrCa survivors. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure 1-RM bench press strength was measured with a barbell and exercise bench. Isometric handgrip strength was measured using an isometric dynamometer with three maximal contractions of left and right hands. All measures were conducted by staff with training in clinical exercise testing. Results Among 295 BrCa survivors, 1-RM bench press strength was 18.2Â±6.1 kg (range: 2.2-43.0) and isometric handgrip strength was 23.5Â±5.8 kg (range: 9.0-43.0). The strongest correlate of 1-RM bench press strength was the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (r=0.399; P<0.0001). Mean-difference analysis suggested that the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands overestimated 1-RM bench press strength by 4.7 kg (95% limits of agreement: â8.2 to 17.6). In a multivariable linear regression model, the average isometric handgrip strength of both hands (Î²=0.31; P<0.0001) and age (Î²=â0.20; P<0.0001) were positively correlated with 1-RM bench press strength (R2=0.23). Conclusions Isometric handgrip strength is a poor surrogate for 1-RM bench press strength among BrCa survivors. 1-RM bench press and isometric handgrip strength quantify distinct components of muscular strength.

Twelve elite male sailors with extensive strength-training experience participated in a comparison of kinematics and kinetics from the upper body musculature, with upper body push (bench press) and pull (bench pull) movements performed across loads of 10-100% of one repetition maximum (1RM). 1RM strength and force were shown to be greater in the bench press, while velocity and power outputs were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads. While power output was at a similar level for the two movements at a low load (10% 1RM), significantly greater power outputs were observed for the bench pull in comparison to the bench press with increased load. Power output (Pmax) was maximized at higher relative loads for both mean and peak power in the bench pull (78.6 +/- 5.7% and 70.4 +/- 5.4% of 1RM) compared to the bench press (53.3 +/- 1.7% and 49.7 +/- 4.4% of 1RM). Findings can most likely be attributed to differences in muscle architecture, which may have training implications for these muscles.\n\nOptical Bench for LISA-like missions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMueller, Guido\n\nThe detection of B-modes in the Î¼-Wave background has rattled the scientific community and further enhanced the large scientific interest in gravitational waves and gravitational wave astronomy. The first direct detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and maybe also by pulsar timing arrays in the second half of this decade will be another watershed event which will start a new era in astronomy and astrophysics. However, the holy grail of gravitational wave astronomy will be opened by a LISA-like mission. Only space provides the environment that allows to cover the signal-rich mHz frequency range where we expect to see gravitational waves from massive black hole mergers, compact galactic binaries, and many other sources. All mature concepts use laser interferometry between free falling test masses separated by millions of km. The central piece in all these concepts is a stable optical bench which is used to prepare and exchange the laser beams between the different arms. It has always been assumed that the base material for the optical bench has to be one of the ultra-low expansion glasses such as Zerodur or ULE to meet the pm/#Hz stability requirements. This very conservative approach was a reflection of the state-of-the-art in frequency stabilization experiments which used optical reference cavities in the early â90s. It is not surprising that the LISA pathfinder (LPF) uses also an all Zerodur bench where each optical component is precision bonded to the bench using hydroxide bonding, a nonreversible bonding technique. The manufacturing of this bench was a very time consuming one-mirror-a-day effort and was one of the highest risk items in terms of schedule and cost. The original LISA design uses the same approach except that the LISA bench is far more complex than the LPF bench and manufacturing of the required 10+ benches, six flight units and at least four pre-flight models and spares, will be even more time consuming and expensive.

The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy and sensitivity of our method for comprehensive mutation detection in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We assessed the performance of the bench-top Ion Torrent PGM and Illumina MiSeq platforms as optimized solutions for mutation detection, using microdroplet PCR-based enrichment of 62 ASD associated genes. Ten patients with known mutations were sequenced using NGS to validate the sensitivity of our method. The overall read quality was better with MiSeq, largely because of the increased indel-related error associated with PGM. The sensitivity of SNV detection was similar between the two platforms, suggesting they are both suitable for SNV detection in the human genome. Next, we used these methods to analyze 28 patients with ASD, and identified 22 novel variants in genes associated with ASD, with one mutation detected by MiSeq only. Thus, our results support the combination of target gene enrichment and NGS as a valuable molecular method for investigating rare variants in ASD.

The scope of medical immunology includes immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, allergy, transfusion and transplantation immunology, and lymphoproliferative disorders plus the monitoring of these patients. The training, professional criteria, quality control of procedures and laboratories is well organized. As examples of the bridge function of medical immunology between laboratory (bench) and patient (bedside) the contribution of medical immunologists to diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases (in particular: humoral immunodeficiencies) as well as autoantibodies (anti-citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis) are given.

We simulated, as closely to the lab conditions as possible, the different AOF modes (Maintenance and commissioning mode (SCAO), GRAAL (GLAO in the near IR), Galacsi Wide Field mode (GLAO in the visible) and Galacsi narrow field mode (LTAO in the visible)). We then compared the simulation results to the ones obtained on the lab bench. Several aspects were investigated, like number of corrected modes, turbulence wind speeds, LGS photon flux etc. The agreement between simulations and lab is remarkably good for all investigated parameters, giving great confidence in both simulation tool and performance of the AO system in the lab.\n\nOptimization of the sensitivity/doses relationship for a bench-top EDXRF system used for in vivo quantification of gold nanoparticles.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantibÃ¡Ã±ez, M; Saavedra, R; VÃ¡squez, M; Malano, F; PÃ©rez, P; Valente, M; Figueroa, R G\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe present work is devoted to optimizing the sensitivity-doses relationship of a bench-top EDXRF system, with the aim of achieving a detection limit of 0.010mg/ml of gold nanoparticles in tumor tissue (clinical values expected), for doses below 10mGy (value fixed for in vivo application). Tumor phantoms of 0.3cm 3 made of a suspension of gold nanoparticles (15nm AurovistTM, Nanoprobes Inc.) were studied at depths of 0-4mm in a tissue equivalent cylindrical phantom. The optimization process was implemented configuring several tube voltages and aluminum filters, to obtain non-symmetrical narrow spectra with fixed FWHM of 5keV and centered among the 11.2-20.3keV. The used statistical figure of merit was the obtained sensitivity (with each spectrum at each depth) weighted by the delivered surface doses. The detection limit of the system was determined measuring several gold nanoparticles concentrations ranging from 0.0010 to 5.0mg/ml and a blank sample into tumor phantoms, considering a statistical fluctuation within 95% of confidence. The results show the possibility of obtaining a detection limit for gold nanoparticles concentrations around 0.010mg/ml for surface tumor phantoms requiring doses around 2mGy.

System description and detector characterization.\n\nPubMed\n\nRathee, S; Tu, D; Monajemi, T T; Rickey, D W; Fallone, B G\n\n2006-04-01\n\nWe describe the components of a bench-top megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) scanner that uses an 80-element detector array consisting of CdWO4 scintillators coupled to photodiodes. Each CdWO4 crystal is 2.75 x 8 x 10 mm3. The detailed design of the detector array, timing control, and multiplexer are presented. The detectors show a linear response to dose (dose rate was varied by changing the source to detector distance) with a correlation coefficient (R2) nearly unity with the standard deviation of signal at each dose being less than 0.25%. The attenuation of a 6 MV beam by solid water measured by this detector array indicates a small, yet significant spectral hardening that needs to be corrected before image reconstruction. The presampled modulation transfer function is strongly affected by the detector's large pitch and a large improvement can be obtained by reducing the detector pitch. The measured detective quantum efficiency at zero spatial frequency is 18.8% for 6 MV photons which will reduce the dose to the patient in MVCT applications. The detector shows a less than a 2% reduction in response for a dose of 24.5 Gy accumulated in 2 h; however, the lost response is recovered on the following day. A complete recovery can be assumed within the experimental uncertainty (standard deviation <0.5%); however, any smaller permanent damage could not be assessed.\n\nImportance of upper-limb inertia in calculating concentric bench press force.\n\nPubMed\n\nRambaud, Olivier; Rahmani, Abderrahmane; Moyen, Bernard; Bourdin, Muriel\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of upper-limb inertia on the force-velocity relationship and maximal power during concentric bench press exercise. Reference peak force values (Fpeakp) measured with a force plate positioned below the bench were compared to those measured simultaneously with a kinematic device fixed on the barbell by taking (Fpeakt) or not taking (Fpeakb) upper-limb inertia into account. Thirteen men (27.8 +/- 4.1 years, 184.6 +/- 5.5 cm, 99.5 +/- 18.6 kg) performed all-out concentric bench press exercise against 8 loads ranging between 7 and 74 kg. The results showed that for each load, Fpeakb was significantly less than Fpeakp (P < 0.0001), whereas no significant difference was found between Fpeakp and Fpeakt. The values of maximal force (F0), maximal velocity (V0), optimal velocity (Vopt), and maximal power (Pmax), extrapolated from the force- and power-velocity relationships determined with the kinematic device, were significantly underestimated when upper-limb inertia was ignored. The results underline the importance of taking account of the total inertia of the moving system to ensure precise evaluation of upper-limb muscular characteristics in all-out concentric bench press exercise with a kinematic device. A major application of this study would be to develop precise upper-limb muscular characteristic evaluation in laboratory and field conditions by using a simple and cheap kinematic device.\n\nSTS-57 inflight maintenance (IFM) tool tray at Boeing FEPF bench review\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1993-01-01\n\nSTS-57 inflight maintenance (IFM) tool tray is displayed on a table top during the bench review at Boeing's Flight Equipment Processing Facility (FEPF) located near JSC.

G. M.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nInterstellar molecules are thought to build up in the shielded environment of molecular clouds or in the envelope of evolved stars. This follows many sequential reaction steps of atoms and simple molecules in the gas phase and/or on (icy) grain surfaces. However, these chemical routes are highly inefficient for larger species in the tenuous environment of space as many steps are involved and, indeed, models fail to explain the observed high abundances. This is definitely the case for the C60 fullerene, recently identified as one of the most complex molecules in the interstellar medium. Observations have shown that, in some photodissociation regions, its abundance increases close to strong UV-sources. In this Letter we report laboratory findings in which C60 formation can be explained by characterizing the photochemical evolution of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sequential H losses lead to fully dehydrogenated PAHs and subsequent losses of C2 units convert graphene into cages. Our results present for the first time experimental evidence that PAHs in excess of 60 C-atoms efficiently photo-isomerize to buckminsterfullerene, C60. These laboratory studies also attest to the importance of top-down synthesis routes for chemical complexity in space.\n\nBench-scale operation of the DETOX wet oxidation process for mixed waste\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDhooge, P.M.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWaste matrices containing organics, radionuclides, and metals pose difficult problems in waste treatment and disposal when the organic compounds and/or metals are considered to be hazardous.

The modern model of hemostasis is divided into two principal phases. The first, defined as primary hemostasis, involves the platelet-vessel interplay, whilst the second, defined as secondary hemostasis, mainly involves coagulation factors, damaged cells and platelet surfaces, where the so-called coagulation cascade rapidly develops. The activation and amplification of the coagulation cascade is finely modulated by the activity of several physiological inhibitors. Once bleeding has been efficiently stopped by blood clot formation, dissolution of the thrombus is essential to restore vessel permeability. This process, known as fibrinolysis, also develops through coordinate action of a vast array of proteins and enzymes. An accurate diagnosis of hemostasis disturbance entails a multifaceted approach, encompassing family and personal history of hemostatic disorders, accurate collection of clinical signs and symptoms, integrated with laboratory hemostasis testing. Regarding laboratory testing, a reasonable approach entails classifying hemostasis testing according to cost, complexity and available clinical information. Laboratory workout may hence initiate with some rapid and inexpensive \"screening\" tests, characterized by high negative predictive value, then followed by second- or third-line analyses, specifically aimed to clarify the nature and severity of bleeding or thrombotic phenotype. This article aims to provide a general overview of the hemostatic process, and to provide some general suggestions to optimally facilitate laboratory hemostasis testing.\n\nCatalytic multi-stage liquefaction of coal at HTI: Bench-scale studies in coal/waste plastics coprocessing\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPradhan, V.R.; Lee, L.K.; Stalzer, R.H.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nThe development of Catalytic Multi-Stage Liquefaction (CMSL) at HTI has focused on both bituminous and sub-bituminous coals using laboratory, bench and PDU scale operations. The crude oil equivalent cost of liquid fuels from coal has been curtailed to about $30 per barrel, thus achieving over 30% reduction in the price that was evaluated for the liquefaction technologies demonstrated in the late seventies and early eighties. Contrary to the common belief, the new generation of catalytic multistage coal liquefaction process is environmentally very benign and can produce clean, premium distillates with a very low (<10ppm) heteroatoms content. The HTI Staff hasmoreÂ Â» been involved over the years in process development and has made significant improvements in the CMSL processing of coals. A 24 month program (extended to September 30, 1995) to study novel concepts, using a continuous bench scale Catalytic Multi-Stage unit (30kg coal/day), has been initiated since December, 1992. This program consists of ten bench-scale operations supported by Laboratory Studies, Modelling, Process Simulation and Economic Assessments. The Catalytic Multi-Stage Liquefaction is a continuation of the second generation yields using a low/high temperature approach. This paper covers work performed between October 1994- August 1995, especially results obtained from the microautoclave support activities and the bench-scale operations for runs CMSL-08 and CMSL-09, during which, coal and the plastic components for municipal solid wastes (MSW) such as high density polyethylene (HDPE)m, polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polythylene terphthlate (PET) were coprocessed.Â«Â less\n\nGraphBench\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSukumar, Sreenivas R.; Hong, Seokyong; Lee, Sangkeun\n\n2016-06-01\n\nGraphBench is a benchmark suite for graph pattern mining and graph analysis systems.

The exact cause(s) of foaming is unknown. Previous research findings are unclear as to whether applications of advanced anaerobic digestion processes reduce the foaming potential of digesters. The object of this study was to investigate how configurations of thermophilic and acid phase-thermophilic anaerobic digestion would affect foaming at the bench-scale level compared to single stage mesophilic digestion for The District. Bench-scale anaerobic digesters were fed with a 4 to 4.5% by dry weight of solids content blend of waste activated sludge (WAS) and primary sludge from The District. Foaming potential was monitored using Alka-Seltzer and aeration foaming tests. The bench-scale acid phase-thermophilic digester had a higher foaming potential than the bench-scale mesophilic digester. These results indicate that higher temperatures increase the foaming potential of the bench-scale anaerobic digesters. The bench-scale acid phase-thermophilic digesters had a greater percent (approximately 5 to 10%) volatile solids destruction and a greater percent (approximately 5 to 10%) total solids destruction when compared to the bench-scale mesophilic digester. Overall, for the full-scale foaming experienced by The District, it appears that adding an acid phase or switching to thermophilic digestion would not alleviate The District's foaming issues.\n\nLaboratory Buildings.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBarnett, Jonathan\n\nThe need for flexibility in science research facilities is discussed, with emphasis on the effect of that need on the design of laboratories.

Tests were made to investigate the consequences of a spontaneous accident during work. Conclusions are: the workbench offers good protection against splinters provided the inside walls are coated with a shock absorber; the carbonate glass should be a minimum of eight mm thick; the risk of burns, except on arms and hands, is very low; the bench withstands the explosion with the given weight of explosives (10 gr); the risk of lesions on the lung are very low, for the operator as well as for somebody nearby.\n\nThe Enigmatic Bench Unit of Endeavour Crater Rim in Meridiani Planum, Mars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRuff, S. W.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nCape York bench clearly presents Grasberg rocks above Burns rocks. Erosion of a plunging synclinal form could explain this apparent inverted relationship, or it reveals that the Grasberg unit is younger than Burns formation. But this latter interpretation implies that Grasberg rocks, which have been observed only at the Endeavour rim, have been stripped off of Burns formation everywhere else. The Grasberg bench unit has recently been encountered in an isthmus setting between two low knobs of presumed Shoemaker formation called Nobbys Head and Sutherland Point just south of Cape York. The isthmus also presents Grasberg as topographically elevated above the Burns formation rocks. Despite its broad, smooth exposure, no remnants of Burns formation have been found on top of Grasberg at this location or anywhere on the Cape York bench. So the stratigraphic relationship between Grasberg and Burns rocks remains enigmatic. At the time of writing, Opportunity is at the edge of Solander Point, another bench feature on the northern tip of a rim segment known as Cape Tribulation. The erosional expression of this example appears different from those examined previously and perhaps offers the best chance to understand stratigraphic relationships. 1. S. W.

Thirty-two women who had not bench pressed within the previous 18 months were assigned to 1 of 2 groups and exposed to 2 sources of efficacy information. First, subjects in both groups performed 10 repetitions on a fixed movement, vertical bench press machine and completed the bench press efficacy scale. Next, each group received 1 of 2 possible verbal messages. Both messages included the speaker's strength training qualifications. In addition, one message conveyed specific performance feedback while the other contained more general information. Then efficacy was measured again. Results indicated both messages strengthened efficacy. Strength professionals who work one-on-one with novice women should: (a) make sure lifters are aware of their professional qualifications, (b) provide specific feedback, and (c) profess their beliefs in the lifters' abilities to perform the exercises.\n\nAnthropometry as a predictor of bench press performance done at different loads.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaruso, John F; Taylor, Skyler T; Lutz, Brant M; Olson, Nathan "
