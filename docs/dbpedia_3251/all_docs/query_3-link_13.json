The journey to Rogers Park will feature the latest installment in a longtime series with Loyola, a Sunday matinee that will be televised nationally on ESPNU. Both teams are looking to rebound from losses on Wednesday night.\n\nLast Time Out: Valpo suffered just its second home loss of the season on Wednesday night against conference-leading UNI at the Athletics-Recreation Center. The Panthers, a team receiving votes nationally in the AP and USA Today Coaches poll, took a 34-19 lead into halftime en route to a 63-51 victory. Javon Freeman-Liberty scored all 14 of his points after halftime, while Ryan Fazekas knocked in a pair of 3s and finished with 12 points. Donovan Clay and Freeman-Liberty shared Valpo leadership with eight rebounds apiece, while Daniel Sackey dished out five assists. UNI’s AJ Green matched Freeman-Liberty with 14 second-half points and finished with 19 for the game, while Austin Phyfe had a double-double of 10 points and 13 rebounds for the Panthers.\n\nFollowing Valpo Basketball: Video – ESPNU – Robert Lee (play-by-play) and Julianne Viani (analyst)\n\nRadio – WVUR (95.1 FM, Valparaiso) – Todd Ickow (play-by-play) and Ben Ariano (analyst)\n\nTwitter updates - @ValpoBasketball\n\nLinks for the audio and live stats will be available at ValpoAthletics.com.\n\nHead Coach Matt Lottich: Matt Lottich (66-56) is in his seventh season overall at Valpo and fourth as head coach in 2019-20. Lottich led the team to 15 victories in his third season in charge in 2018-19, the program’s second campaign in the Missouri Valley Conference. In his first year as head coach (2016-17), Lottich guided Valpo to its fifth Horizon League regular season championship in a six-year span as he led the team to 24 wins and an at-large berth into the NIT. Lottich, hired as the 22nd head coach of the Valpo men’s basketball program in April 2016, graduated from Stanford University in 2004 and New Trier High School (Illinois) in 2000.\n\nSeries Notes: Loyola leads the all-time set 40-15 including a 6-0 mark since Valpo joined the Missouri Valley Conference prior to the 2017-18 season. The series dates all the way back to February 1922. The two teams faced off in the MVC Tournament a year ago, a 67-54 Loyola victory that brought the Valpo season to a halt. The Ramblers escaped the ARC with a 66-63 triumph on Dec. 30, handing Valpo its first home loss of the season in the conference opener. Freshman Donovan Clay had a career day, knocking down all eight of his shot attempts including four 3s to total 21 points. Valpo will look to snap a six-game skid against the Ramblers, which dates back to the final Horizon League meeting between the two teams on Feb. 19, 2013.\n\nScouting the Ramblers\n\nHold a 10-2 home mark including a 5-0 record in MVC home games.\n\nComing off a 68-39 loss at Indiana State on Wednesday night, the team’s third loss in the last four games. The team was held to its lowest field-goal percentage of the season at 33.3 (15-of-45).\n\nLed in scoring and rebounding by MVC Preseason Player of the Year Cameron Krutwig at 15.0 points and 8.1 rebounds per game.\n\nHave won back-to-back MVC regular-season championships.\n\nPicked to finish fourth in the MVC Preseason Poll.\n\nHead coach Porter Moser has led the team to three postseason berths over the last five seasons.\n\nLoyola 66, Valpo 63 (Dec. 30 at Valpo): Valpo incurred a narrow defeat on Dec. 30 in the conference opener, falling 66-63 to Loyola at the Athletics-Recreation Center. A career night from Donovan Clay was the Valpo highlight, as the freshman knocked down all eight of his shot attempts including four 3-pointers to accrue 21 points. Nick Robinson returned after missing the previous game with an injury and didn’t miss a beat, handing out a personal-best seven assists to go along with 15 points. Valpo outscored the Ramblers 35-31 in the second half after trailing 35-28 at the break.\n\nLock Down D: Easily lost on a night that featured a disappointing outcome, Valpo played well enough to win on the defensive end in the 63-51 setback vs. UNI on Feb. 5. The 63 points were the fewest allowed by Valpo in the last seven games and tied with the Jan. 7 game at Southern Illinois for the fewest allowed in a defeat this season. Valpo held UNI to just 37.7 percent shooting, the fourth time this season and the second straight game Valpo has limited the opponent under 40 percent from the field. Coincidentally, Valpo has held each of its last two opponents (Illinois State and UNI) to exactly 23-of-61 (37.7 percent) shooting. The shooting percentage of 37.7 was UNI’s lowest in the last nine games and the team’s third-lowest clip of the season. The 63 points was the lowest total for the Panthers since a 60-55 loss to West Virginia on Nov. 26. Only West Virginia, Old Dominion and Valpo have held UNI to 63 points or fewer in a game this season. The squad entered Wednesday averaging 77.4 points per game. This is the first time Valpo has held the opponent under 40 percent shooting in back-to-back games since Jan. 8, 2019 (vs. Bradley) and Jan. 12, 2019 (at Southern Illinois).\n\nTurnover Trends: Valpo continued to thrive in dodging turnovers on Feb. 5 vs. UNI, giving it away just twice after halftime and nine times total. It marked the third instance this season that the turnover total has been in single figures. The team made a season-low eight turnovers in a win over Evansville on Jan. 26 and also committed just nine in a Dec. 18 victory at High Point. The nine turnovers on Feb. 5 vs. UNI were the fewest committed in a setback since Dec. 4, 2018 vs. High Point. Valpo (+2.54) and Loyola (+2.79) are the top two teams in the league in terms of turnover margin. Valpo has turned it over a league-low 123 times in 11 conference games, averaging just 11.2 turnovers per game.\n\nOver 80, Sub 60: Valpo reached the 80-point threshold for the sixth time this season in the 80-70 win over Illinois State on Feb. 1. Valpo improved to 6-0 this year and 28-2 under Matt Lottich when scoring 80+ points. Conversely, Valpo dropped to 0-4 this season and 2-25 under Lottich when scoring fewer than 60 points with the 63-51 setback vs. UNI on Feb. 5.\n\nTrading Ws and Ls: Valpo has not lost back-to-back games or won back-to-back games in Valley play through the first 11 contests, with the Brown & Gold consistently bouncing back and forth between a game under .500 and the exact breakeven mark in league play. This is the first time since at least 1982, when Valpo joined the Association of Mid-Continent Universities, that the team has not had back-to-back wins or back-to-back losses in the first 11 games of the conference slate. Valpo will need a road victory over Loyola on Sunday to keep this trend intact.\n\nFreeman-Liberty Eyes the Record Book: Currently at 472 points, Javon Freeman-Liberty has an opportunity to finish the year among Valpo’s all-time scoring leaders, needing to get to 570 to join the program’s single-season Top 10. He finished his freshman season with 60 steals, the most by a rookie in program history and the third-most by any Valpo player. This year he is at 52, just one away from moving into a tie for 10th with Bryce Drew’s 1997-98 season on Valpo’s single-season steals list. Stalin Ortiz (2002-03) is seventh with 56 steals, while Brandon Wood (2010-11) and Erik Buggs (2012-13) are tied for eighth with 55.\n\nAmong the Nation’s Elite: Javon Freeman-Liberty ranks 32nd nationally in points per game at 19.7, 26th in steals per game at 2.17, 16th in field goals made (170), sixth in field goal attempts (398) and 13th in total steals (52). Among sophomores, he’s fifth in the nation in steals per game and sixth in points per game.\n\nClay on the Boards: Donovan Clay had eight rebounds on Feb. 5 vs. UNI, sharing the team lead. It marked the sixth time in the last 10 games he’s had seven rebounds or more. He reached the seven-rebound mark just once over his first 14 games, and it was against an NAIA opponent. The freshman averaged 3.2 rebounds per game over the first 14 contests, and is pulling down 6.1 rebounds per game to tie for the team lead over the last 10 outings. Clay has led the team or shared the team lead in rebounding in six of the 11 MVC games after doing so just once during the nonconference slate.\n\nOther Notes Wrapping Up UNI (Feb. 5)\n\nDaniel Sackey had five rebounds and a team-high five assists. It was his highest assist total since handing out nine on Dec. 18 at High Point.\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty finished in double figures for the 24th consecutive game, scoring all 14 of his points after halftime. UNI held the league’s leading scorer scoreless before the break.\n\nValpo limited UNI star AJ Green below his average as he went 7-of-20 shooting and finished with 19 points, 14 of which came after halftime.\n\nRyan Fazekas finished in double figures for the second time in the last three games and the third time this season. He missed 17 games with a wrist injury. Fazekas accounted for two of the team’s three makes from beyond the 3-point arc.\n\nThe 12-point margin of defeat was Valpo’s largest on its home floor since Dec. 17, 2018, a 77-61 loss to Ball State. Valpo last lost a home conference game by 12 or more on Jan. 21, 2018 vs. Loyola.\n\nValpo went just 3-of-23 from beyond the arc for a season-low 3-point shooting clip of 13 percent. The team’s previous season low was 15.8 percent (3-of-19) vs. Nevada on Nov. 24 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The game against the Panthers marked Valpo’s lowest 3-point percentage since going 2-of-16 (12.5 percent) on Jan. 26, 2019 vs. Drake.\n\nUnpack the Suitcase: By hosting Illinois State on Feb. 1 and UNI on Feb. 5, Valpo played back-to-back home games for the first time all season. This was the first time in the history of Valpo basketball, going all the way back to the first season on record in 1917, where the team has not played back-to-back home games until after the calendar flipped to February.\n\nA Burst Off the Bench: Valpo outscored Illinois State 36-13 in bench points on Feb. 1, a 23-point surplus in that area that marked Valpo’s largest of the season against a Division-I opponent. The 36 points off the bench were also the most this year for the Brown & Gold in a DI game. Valpo has been outscored in bench points just once through the first 11 Missouri Valley Conference contests, the league opener vs. Loyola. The 36 bench points against the Redbirds were Valpo’s most in a Division-I game since Jan. 13, 2018 when the team had 37 in an 81-76 loss to UNI.\n\nLeading the Way: In back-to-back games on Jan. 26 at Bradley and Feb. 1 vs. Illinois State, Valpo has had the same player hold outright team leadership in points, rebounds and assists. Javon Freeman-Liberty became the first Valpo player to accomplish that feat all season on Jan. 29 at Bradley, turning in a 21-point, seven-rebound, four-assist effort. Freshman Ben Krikke followed that up with a dominant night of his own on Feb. 1 vs. Illinois State, leading the team in points (17), rebounds (eight) and assists (four). Before Freeman-Liberty accomplished the feat against the Braves, the last Valpo player to own the outright team lead in all three categories in a game was Deion Lavender on Nov. 16, 2018 vs. Monmouth, when he had 15, eight and five. Krikke became the first Valpo freshman to solely lead the team in points, rebounds and assists in a game since at least the start of the 1989-90 season.\n\nNotes Wrapping Up Illinois State (Feb. 1)\n\nThe 10-point margin of victory (80-70) was Valpo’s largest in Missouri Valley Conference play this season.\n\nSeven Valpo players finished with seven points or more and eight grabbed five rebounds or more.\n\nBen Krikke’s 17 points marked his highest scoring output since notching 18 against Trinity Christian on Nov. 27. It was his highest scoring output against a Division-I opponent this season.\n\nKrikke also set career highs in rebounds with eight and assists with four. His eight boards shattered his previous mark of six set in the conference opener against Loyola, while the assists equaled his personal best set in the aforementioned Trinity Christian game. He led the team in scoring, rebounds and assists, becoming the first Valpo freshman to do so in at least three decades.\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty finished in double figures for the 23rd straight game, contributing 12 points to go along with seven rebounds, three assists and two steals.\n\nZion Morgan tied a career high with seven points, his largest output against a DI team He also had five rebounds in just 12 minutes.\n\nDonovan Clay continued to find success in MVC home games, finishing with 12 points and six rebounds.\n\nValpo outscored Illinois State 36-13 in bench points, its highest bench-point total this season.\n\nIncreased Thievery: Valpo swiped 10 steals in the Jan. 29 game at Bradley, already the team’s eighth game this season with 10 steals or more. The Brown & Gold followed with nine steals on Feb. 1 vs. Illinois State, the team’s 15th game this year with nine steals or more. By comparison, Valpo had just four games a year ago with nine steals or more and two with double-figure steal totals. As a team, Valpo has 8.4 steals per game, up from 6.1 last season. Valpo currently leads the Missouri Valley Conference in steals.\n\nClose Calls: Valpo secured the season sweep of Evansville on Jan. 26, notching its second straight two-point victory over the Purple Aces. This marks the first time the Brown & Gold have played two games in one season against the same opponent both decided by two points or fewer since 2010-11, when the team lost by one point and two points to Green Bay. This marks the first time Valpo has won three or more regular season games by two points or fewer in the same year since 2012-13, though the team had three such victories in 2015-16 counting a postseason win over BYU. Three straight meetings between Valpo and Evansville have been decided by exactly two points. Before last year's regular season finale that saw Evansville prevail 65-63, the two teams had not played a game decided by two points or fewer since 1974 despite the fact that 32 meetings had taken place since.\n\nHeating Up: Mileek McMillan scored in double figures in four straight games after doing so just three times over the first 16 games of the year. His 16-point effort to tie a career high on Jan. 26 vs. Evansville capped his double-figure streak. He averaged 12.5 points per game over those four outings. McMillan had scored in double figures just four times over the first 68 games of his career before doing so in four straight games. The junior led Valpo in scoring in back-to-back games after not doing so in any of his first 70 career games.\n\nLofting Up Treys: Valpo had 39 3-point attempts in the Jan. 23 game at Missouri State, tying for the fifth most in a single game in the history of the Missouri Valley Conference. It was the most 3-point attempts by a Valpo team since at least the 1989-90 season and the most by any Valley team since Drake tossed up 42 3-point attempts against Western Kentucky on March 21, 2008. Before that, no Valley squad had jacked up 39 or more treys since Jan. 27, 1999 when Drake did so against Missouri State. In addition, the 39 attempts tied for the most by a Valley team in a league-only game.\n\nThe JQH Arena Arc: The last two times Valpo teams have played in JQH Arena, there has been no shortage of attempts from 3-point distance. The Valpo women set the arena record for 3-point tries with 40 on Jan. 27 of last season before the Valpo men set a men’s arena record with 39 attempts on Jan. 23 of this season in Springfield.\n\nRyan Returns: Valpo senior Ryan Fazekas returned from his wrist injury on Jan. 23 at Missouri State, coming back after being sidelined for 17 games. In his first game back, he scored six points by knocking down a pair of 3s before fouling out. Prior to the return against the Bears, Fazekas had played in just 22 of 52 games over the last two seasons while battling various ailments.\n\nStrong Second Halves: Valpo outscored Missouri State by 13 in the second half on Jan. 23, statistically the team’s best half in conference play this season. That was the second straight second half that has gone well for Valpo, which outscored Indiana State 54-42 after the break on Jan. 18. Over those two games, the Brown and Gold outscored the opponent by a combined count of 98-73 in the second half.\n\nComeback Kids: Valpo continued its trend of erasing significant deficits in the 86-77 victory over Indiana State on Jan. 18 at the ARC. The hosts trailed by 11 with 6:12 to go in the first half, but pulled off the team’s third victory when behind by 10 points or more this season. It was already the 11th time in Matt Lottich’s four-year tenure as the head coach that Valpo has chased by double digits and came away victorious. Valpo has come from double figures down to tie or take the lead seven times this year.\n\nErasing Double-Figure Deficits Under Lottich\n\nYear Opponent Largest Deficit Outcome\n\n2019-20 Indiana State 11 W 86-77\n\n2019-20 SIUE 10 W 89-76\n\n2019-20 Toledo* 14 W 79-77\n\n2018-19 Illinois State 12 W 58-56\n\n2018-19 George Washington 10 W 82-79\n\n2017-18 Bradley 10 W 77-64\n\n2017-18 UNCW 10 W 79-70\n\n2016-17 Wright State 10 W 84-74\n\n2016-17 Cleveland State 12 W 78-67\n\n2016-17 BYU 12 W 92-89\n\n2016-17 Trinity Christian 16 W 89-75\n\n*largest comeback vs. D1 opponent since Jan. 17, 2012 vs. Detroit Mercy\n\nPoints Galore: Valpo improved to 5-0 this season and 27-2 under Matt Lottich when scoring 80 points or more thanks to the 86-77 victory over Indiana State on Jan. 18. The 86 points marked the most Valpo has scored in a Missouri Valley Conference game since joining the league. The field-goal percentage of 50.8 against the Sycamores was Valpo’s highest in a Valley game this season. It was Valpo’s highest single-game scoring output in conference play since blitzing UIC 96-65 in a Horizon League encounter on Jan. 22, 2017, the same game that saw Alec Peters shatter Bryce Drew’s all-time scoring record.\n\nBalanced Attack: Five Valpo players finished in double figures in the Jan. 18 victory over Indiana State, the first time that has occurred against a Division-I opponent since Dec. 2, 2018 vs. UC Riverside. Valpo has had four or more players finish in double figures in each of the last two games.\n\nKiser Cracks Double Figures: Senior John Kiser has accomplished a lot along his journey from walk-on to key player, but one threshold he hadn’t cracked before the Jan. 18 matchup with Indiana State was scoring double figures in a game. He had previously reached nine on six occasions, but made it into double figures with a career-high 12 points while sharing the team lead with eight rebounds in the home victory over the Sycamores.\n\nSophomore Showdown: In a battle of two of the Missouri Valley Conference’s brightest stars, Javon Freeman-Liberty finished with 28 points to defending conference Freshman of the Year A.J. Green’s 29 in UNI’s 88-78 victory over Valpo on Jan. 15. However, Freeman-Liberty had the better all-around stat line, pulling down eight rebounds and four steals. It was the sophomore sensation’s 18th consecutive double-figure scoring output, his 10th game with 20 points or more and his fourth contest with 28 points or more. He also led the team in rebounds for the first time since Nov. 25 vs. Cincinnati in the game at UNI, as his eight boards marked his highest total since accruing nine in the game against the Bearcats. In addition, he enjoyed his fifth game this season with four steals or more in the battle with the Panthers.\n\nGuarding the Arc: Valpo held Drake to 2-of-20 from behind the 3-point arc (10 percent) on Jan. 11, the team’s second-best performance this season in terms of 3-point defense behind a Dec. 8 victory over Central Michigan where the Chippewas went just 1-of-17 (5.9 percent). That Central Michigan team had previously made at least four 3s in every game this season, and that was Valpo’s lowest opponent 3-point percentage since Jan. 26, 2015 (Milwaukee 1-of-17, 5.9 percent). Drake’s two made 3s on Jan. 13 at the ARC was the team’s lowest total since Feb. 17, 2015.\n\nFinding a Way to Win: Valpo shot just 33.3 percent on Jan. 11 vs. Drake, but did enough right to withstand a cold shooting performance in a 66-61 victory. The game marked Valpo’s lowest shooting percentage in a victory since beating UIC 64-58 on Jan. 21, 2010 despite a 32.1 percent shooting clip. The 66 points were the fewest by Valpo in a victory this season. Valpo was previously 0-5 this year when scoring fewer than 70 points.\n\n#SCTop10 Again: Javon Freeman-Liberty slammed home a poster dunk in the first half of Tuesday’s game at Southern Illinois, gaining national attention as the play appeared on ESPN throughout the evening. The play checked in at No. 5 on SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays, marking the second time this season that the program has been featured on the daily countdown, as Daniel Sackey had the No. 9 play for an August buzzer-beater to top Carleton as part of the program’s foreign tour. Since Valpo joined the Missouri Valley Conference, the University has been featured on SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays on seven occasions spanning five sports – men’s basketball (three times), women’s basketball, softball, men’s soccer and volleyball.\n\nStopping the Streak: With Valpo’s 81-79 overtime victory over Evansville on Jan. 4, the team stopped a five-game head-to-head losing streak against the Aces and garnered its first win against Evansville since joining the Missouri Valley Conference (previously 0-4). But most noteworthy of all was the 22-game losing skid in games played at Evansville that came to an end. Matt Lottich became the first Valpo coach to win at Evansville since the legendary Gene Bartow led his team to a 101-95 victory on Feb. 1, 1969. During the years (or more accurately, decades) between those victories, five Valpo coaches went winless in the River City: Bill Purden (0-6), Ken Rochlitz (0-3), Tom Smith (0-5), Homer Drew (0-4) and Bryce Drew (0-1). No member of the Valpo team or coaching staff was alive the last time the program won in Evansville before Saturday.\n\nWorking Overtime: The Jan. 4 game at Evansville was Valpo’s second overtime affair of the season and first victory. The squad came out on the wrong end of an 81-77 decision vs. Cincinnati in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Nov. 25. The win over the Aces snapped a three-game OT losing streak that also included home defeats to Indiana State and Missouri State last season and dated back to a 75-70 OT victory over SIUE at the ARC on Nov. 21, 2018. Jan. 4 at Evansville was Valpo’s first OT affair in a true road game since Feb. 26, 2016, an 80-76 win at Milwaukee in the final year of Bryce Drew’s head coaching tenure.\n\nLeading the League\n\nThis marked the second time in the last three years Valpo entered Valley play as the conference leader in steals per game (8.7) after also doing so in 2017-18 (7.8 spg).\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty became the first Valpo player to enter conference action as the league’s leading scorer since 2016-17, when Alec Peters started Horizon League play at 25.5 points per game.\n\nFreeman-Liberty was also the first Valpo player to enter conference play leading the way in steals since 2016-17, when Lexus Williams topped the Horizon League at 1.8 per game.\n\nThis was the first time Valpo started conference action atop the statistical leaderboard in assists (16.7 apg) since 2011-12, when Valpo started Horizon League action averaging 14.7 assists per game.\n\nFreeman-Liberty is trying to become the first player to lead The Valley in both scoring and steals since Drake’s Curt Smith in 1993. In addition, he is attempting to become the first play to lead the MVC in steals in consecutive seasons since Hersey Hawkins of Bradley did so in 1986, 1987 and 1988.\n\nValpo is trying to become the first Valley team to lead the league in both assists and steals since Bradley in 2008.\n\nPutting Up Points: Valpo finished the nonconference schedule with a scoring average of 76.3, the team’s highest nonconference scoring average since entering the 2013-14 league slate at 77.1. The team currently sits at 75.4 points per game, up from 66.8 a year ago.\n\nWinning Ways: Thanks to the Dec. 18 win at High Point, Valpo locked up a winning record during the nonconference portion of the schedule for the 10th consecutive season. The last time Valpo entered the conference slate with a sub-.500 mark was 2009-10, when Valpo went 5-7 prior to the start of Horizon League action.\n\nComebacks, Revisited: Seven times this season Valpo has trailed by double figures and come back to tie or take the lead. On three of those occasions, the Brown & Gold sealed the deal and won the game.\n\nValpo trailed by 11 in the first half on Jan. 18 vs. Indiana State before coming back to win 86-77.\n\nValpo faced an early 18-5 deficit at Arkansas (in North Little Rock, Ark.) on Dec. 21 and battled back to take an eight-point lead over the Razorbacks with 7:27 to play before falling 72-68.\n\nValpo faced a 10-point halftime deficit on Dec. 3 at Eastern Michigan and chased by as many as 12 before coming back to take a 66-60 lead with 7:23 to go. The Eagles eventually prevailed 85-79.\n\nValpo rallied from 12 down with 10:12 to play to force overtime in an eventual 81-77 defeat to Cincinnati on Nov. 25 in the third-place game of the Paradise Jam.\n\nOn Nov. 12 at SIUE, Valpo was down by 10 with 13:00 minutes to play in the opening half before winning by 13. That marked the first time Valpo had come from down by double figures to win by double figures since Feb. 17, 2018, a 77-64 victory over Bradley.\n\nThe most noteworthy comeback of all came on opening night, when Valpo erased a 14-point deficit to beat Toledo 79-77. It was the team’s largest comeback against a Division-I opponent since Jan. 17, 2013, rallying from 22 down to beat Detroit Mercy 89-88. It was Valpo’s biggest comeback in any game since coming from 16 down to beat Trinity Christian on Nov. 12, 2016.\n\nIn Matt Lottich’s head coaching tenure (fourth season), there have already been 11 times Valpo has trailed by double figures and come away victorious. The team overcame four double-figure deficits in 2016-17 (Wright State, Cleveland State, BYU and Trinity Christian), two in 2017-18 (Bradley and UNCW) and two in 2018-19 (George Washington and Illinois State).\n\nLock-Down D: Central Michigan entered its Sunday, Dec. 8 game at the Athletics-Recreation Center as the top scoring offense in the nation at 93.9 points per game. Valpo held the Chippewas to a season-low 55 points, just the second time all season they’ve been held below 75 with the other instance coming at Minnesota. Valpo contained Central Michigan to just 33.9 percent shooting for the game, the team’s second-lowest shooting percentage of the season. The 55 points were the fewest allowed by Valpo all season and the opponent’s field goal percentage of 33.9 was the team’s best since holding Missouri State to 30.9 percent on Jan. 29 of last season.\n\nNovember Success: Valpo finished the month of November with a 5-3 record, continuing a tradition of strong starts to seasons. November has been Valpo’s best month under head coach Matt Lottich, as the team owns a 24-7 (.774) November mark through the first four years of his tenure. This marked the 10th straight season Valpo has had a winning record in November, as the team has compiled a 56-19 (.747) November record over the last decade.\n\n2019-20: 5-3\n\n2018-19: 4-3\n\n2017-18: 8-0\n\n2016-17: 7-1\n\n2015-16: 6-2\n\n2014-15: 7-1\n\n2013-14: 5-4\n\n2012-13: 5-1\n\n2011-12: 5-2\n\n2010-11: 4-2\n\n2009-10: 3-4\n\nA Flair for the Dramatic: Valpo added a new name to its long list of late-game heroes in the program’s storied history during the Nov. 5 season opener vs. Toledo as Javon Freeman-Liberty knocked down an off-balance 15-footer from the left elbow with 3.7 seconds left in a 79-77 victory at the Athletics-Recreation Center. That marked the 24th time since the start of the 1992-93 season Valpo has prevailed on a game-winner in the final five seconds. Although it was the first game of the regular season, it was already the second time Valpo has won in dramatic fashion this year as Daniel Sackey’s overtime buzzer-beater lifted the team past Canadian powerhouse Carleton 83-80 in overtime on its foreign tour in August.\n\nNonconference Highlights: Valpo’s nonconference schedule was highlighted by seven opponents that qualified for the postseason last year. Here are a few of the opponents that highlighted the 13-game docket that led into the start of Missouri Valley Conference action.\n\nToledo (Nov. 5) went 25-8 last season including a 13-5 conference mark. The Rockets went to the NIT a year ago and have won back-to-back MAC West Division titles.\n\nSaint Louis (Nov. 9) has made four NCAA Tournament appearances in the last decade and went 23-13 in 2018-19 on its way to the Atlantic 10 Tournament title.\n\nGrand Canyon (Nov. 22) went 20-14 overall and 10-6 in the WAC last season, qualifying for the postseason with a CBI berth.

The Razorbacks, members of the SEC, reached the second round of the NIT last season and finished 18-16 overall. Against one of the top teams nationally in the NET rankings, Valpo led by eight with under eight minutes remaining, but fell 72-68.\n\nWrapping Up Canada\n\nValpo finished its four-game Canadian Foreign Tour from Aug. 10-14 with an unblemished mark after notching wins over McGill (84-78), Concordia (94-90), Carleton (83-80, OT) and the University of Quebec (81-68).\n\nValpo battled from 90-80 down with 4:56 to play to top Concordia 94-90 in Montreal on Aug. 11 thanks to a game-closing 14-0 run.\n\nThe highlight of the tour came on Aug. 13, when Winnipeg native Daniel Sackey drained a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to top Carleton 83-80 in overtime.\n\nValpo stopped Canadian powerhouse Carleton’s 15-game winning streak against NCAA Division-I teams that included triumphs over USF, Ole Miss, Providence, Cincinnati, Vanderbilt and Alabama.\n\nThe Sackey buzzer-beater was No. 9 on SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays that evening.\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty scored a team-high 18.8 points per game during the Canada journey, while Donovan Clay and Mileek McMillan shared the team lead by averaging 5.3 boards apiece. Sackey averaged 15.0 points per game during the trip.\n\nPreseason Picks\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty and Ryan Fazekas both earned All-MVC Second Team honors.\n\nThey joined Tevonn Walker (2017) as the only Valpo players to be tabbed preseason all-MVC since joining the conference.\n\nThe last time Valpo had multiple players on the preseason all-league first or second teams in the same season was 2016, when Alec Peters and Shane Hammink were first and second team Horizon League preseason picks, respectively.\n\nValpo was picked to finish ninth in the preseason poll, based on a survey of the conference’s head coaches, sports information directors and media.

Valpo started 4-0 in Missouri Valley Conference play, but finished the year 15-18 overall and 7-11 in league action.\n\nNew Year, New Look\n\nValpo has five returning letter winners after seven letter winners departed following the 2018-19 campaign.\n\nValpo has 40.1 percent of its scoring and 35.7 percent of its rebounding back from last season.\n\nThe five returning letter winners are Valpo’s fewest since the 2013-14 campaign, when Jordan Coleman, LaVonte Dority, Bobby Capobianco and Vashil Fernandez were the only players back from the previous season.\n\nStaff Sidebars\n\nAssociate head coach Luke Gore is in his 18th year on staff and has served under four different head coaches.
