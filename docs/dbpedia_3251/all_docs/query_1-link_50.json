        "text": "Finals? Just using the plural is enough, Sid. My only Cup-Winners' Cup game ever was the last ever. And Villa Park was the furthest I travelled for any of the European club finals. One ECCC/UCL final and one UEFA Cup final, both at Hampden. Then the following year's UEFA Cup final at the City of Manchester stadium for which I was guaranteed a face value ticket anyway.\n\nOne solitary World Cup finals match - Germany v Costa Rica opener 2006 which I landed in the FIFA random ballot barely 48 hours earlier and had to fly from Prestwick to that one that's called Frankfurt but is about as close to Frankfurt as Prestwick is to Ibrox, and then catch an overnight train to Mannheim, change at Mannheim and down to Munich for 8 am-ish on the day of the game (The DFB's HQ town to the birthplace of Sepp Herberger and then the city where Germany won its only major trophy on home soil - all very poetic I thought ... but still just one game).\n\nDid six group games, two quarters, a semi and the final at Euro 96 but - again - that was on the doorstep and no-one in England seemed that interested in buying tickets to watch anyone other than England.\n\nThe most exotic place I've seen Scotland is Pittodrie. Wembley is more a biological certainty than an away trip for Scots but even then I've seen Scotland at Wembley only once more than Germany. And while I've seen the Mets at Shea, the Cubs at Wrigley and the Blue Jays at the Sky Dome, I have never seen a soccer match outside Europe. And apart from the odd Euro trip with the Teds and a dozen or so randoms in the English top 5 leagues, I've managed the Czech top flight, the Danish, La Liga, Serie A, Serie B and the top three tiers in Germany - all one game each. Just one each.\n\nMuch as I deride it as unworthy of being considered a \"European trophy\" or \"continental competition\" I would like to get the Super Cup final done before I die. But, inevitably, the once will do me. Just like I've been to every league ground in Scotland, every junior ground in Ayrshire region and am fucking delighted we have Israel and Albania coming to Hampden in the UEFA Nations League (never seen either) but have zero interest in seeing Costa Rica again, at Hampden, this Friday.\n\nThis is all probably explaining why I talk about European finals so much and get off on the Euro experiences of others. While I have this strange thing of seeing European finalists in the flesh, I never seem to make the finals themselves.\n\nSo - yeah - please. Bring on the Cup Winners Cup finals, Sid - I need it, man. I just gots to know.\n\nFRIDAY QUIZ - This week brought to you in association with the Museum of Jerseys, official partner of the OTF European Cup Trivia Thread.\n\nWe remember Cardiff last year, right? Juventus, in their traditional black and white stripes, were skelped by Real Madrid in purple (though I personally saw it as all-violet). And most of us here probably also remember Real Madrid in all-black, skelping Valencia in the 2000 final (especially those of us who saw the picture posted by jwdd27 on the previous page).\n\nBut did you know Real also lost the 1962 final in a more blue-ish version of their neither-purple-nor-violet Cardiff kit? Or that they lost the 1964 final, versus Inter, in their traditional all-white?\n\nSo, can you tell me ...\n\n(1) The eleven clubs other than Real Madrid to have won the European Cup/Champions League final in a change/away kit,\n\n(2) The six years in which both sides contested the final in change/away kits,\n\n(3) The four clubs who played and lost their only final in change/away kits,\n\n(4) The four clubs other than Real Madrid to have both won and lost finals in both their home and change/away kits?\n\n*For the porpoises of this dolphin, teams altering their shorts - as per Bayern in 1987 - or wearing random socks or having a special trim or commemorative one-off legend on their shirt does not constitute a change/away strip. If that season's home shirt is obviously gone, it's a change/away strip.\n\nAnd remember, folks, for all your kit needs - home, away or mash-up - pop on down to Museum of Jerseys. \"It's not a building full of old stuff in St Helier\""
