        "text": "Following our visits to the city in 2016, 2019 and 2023, our men's team return to Los Angeles this pre-season. The second most populous city in the USA behind New York is filled with beautiful beaches, is the home of Hollywood and will host the 2028 Olympic Games.\n\nThings to do\n\nHead to Universal Studios for a host of rollercoasters, explore The Wizarding World of Harry Potter or Super Nintendo World and take a tour of the studios to see where the latest blockbusters are being filmed and see classic sets – something also on offer at Warner Bros Studio.\n\nThe view of the city from the Griffith Observatory is stunning, particularly at night, or instead head to the shoreline at Venice Beach or check out the Santa Monica Pier.\n\nMagnolia Park in Burbank is a walkable street with some cool shops and coffee shops, or you can stretch your legs around Old Zoo at Griffith Park to see a cool little nugget of history. Speaking of history, the Hollywood Walk of Fame is where icons of screen and stage are immortalised.\n\nIf you fancy a flutter, horse racing happens on certain Friday and Saturdays at Santa Anita, while music fans will want to stop by the world’s largest independent record shop at Amoeba Music. If you need an evening show, laugh yourself silly at Comedy Store or Laugh Factory.\n\nA trip to Porto’s Bakery is a must, while if you’re hungry, you could also try Ca De Sole for a nice Italian dinner, or Sushi Row in Ventura Blvd has one of the highest concentrations of sushi restaurants outside of Japan. Ozzy’s Apizza in Glendale is one of the best pizza spots, and is co-owned by a Gooner! Wash whatever you opt for with a cocktail at Black Market Liquor Bar.\n\nThe stadiums\n\nOur tour starts at Dignity Health Sports Park, home of MLS side LA Galaxy. It is based in the city of Carson, 14 miles south of downtown LA and was built in 2003. It has a capacity of 27,000, making it the second-largest soccer-specific stadium in the USA.\n\nIt has hosted six MLS Cup finals, as well as the 2003 Women’s World Cup final and is regularly used by the US women’s national team. It will host rugby matches at the 2028 Olympics, and was the temporary home of the NFL’s LA Chargers between 2017 and 2019.\n\nFollowing that, we head to the familiar surroundings of SoFi Stadium to tackle Manchester United, where the Chargers as well as the LA Rams play their home games. Situated in the city of Inglewood, 10.5 miles from the centre of LA, it was constructed in 2020 and has a capacity of 70,240.\n\nThe impressive structure boasts a permanent roof structure and a huge ovular screen suspended over the pitch, which weighs over 1,000 tonnes.\n\nHaving already hosted the 2022 Super Bowl, matches at this year’s Copa America and the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, it will stage eight matches at the 2026 World Cup, another Super Bowl in 2027 and football games at the Olympics the following year. The venue was also where we beat Barcelona 5-3 in friendly action during our 2023 Stateside tour.\n\nFollowing our game against United, we go coast-to-coast as we head across the nation to Philadelphia to tackle Liverpool - the first time we will play in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nThings to do\n\nHistory buffs will want to check out the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed by the founding fathers and the United States of America was born. The Historic Old City also features Elfreth’s Alley, dating back to 1702 and is worth a walk around.\n\nYou can take in more of the city with a stroll on Cira Green, an elevated park over 100 feet above 30th St. in Philadelphia's University City section. Meanwhile, the Magic Gardens are completely covered in mosaics comprised of salvaged ceramic and glass and international folk art\n\nIf you want to let the bus take the strain, an open-top tour will show you Philly's greatest hits, but there are also guides centred around food, music, art, the supernatural and locations from Rocky, including a trip to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and a chance to run up the 72 steps just like Sylvester Stallone.\n\nFor an authentic Philly cheesesteak, head to Angelo's Pizza, John's Roast Pork, Joe's in Fishtown and Phillip's in South Philly, or enjoy a taste of Italy at Gran Caffe L'Aquila. As for drinks, grab yourself a milk tube - a sweet, dense, foamy treat unlike any beer-drinking experience - from Human Robot’s Olde Kensington location, or for a taste of dive bar action, head to Ray's Happy Birthday Bar in South Philly.\n\nFor something a little different, you can listen to the world’s biggest pipe organ - The Wanamaker Grand Court Organ. Built for the 1904 World's Fair, it is still played daily for 45 minutes at noon and 5:30pm.\n\nThe stadium\n\nThe city is fanatical about sports, and was the second US city to have its teams win championships in each of MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA. Our game against the Reds will be held at the home of the four-time Super Bowl winners Philadelphia Eagles, Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nOpened in 2003, the 67,594-capacity venue is located in South Philadelphia, 3.5 miles from the city centre. It has regularly hosted soccer matches, including games in the 2003 Women’s World Cup, 2009 Gold Cup and the 2016 Copa America, as well as USA home internationals and multiple pre-season friendlies.\n\nArsenal Women will head to the US capital in August where they’ll take on Washington Spirit and Chelsea Women at Audi Field Stadium.\n\nThings to do\n\nYou’re spoilt for choice in DC. You can catch a show at the Kennedy Centre, spend some time at the Sculpture Garden and Constitution or hit the Nationals Stadium for a baseball game (if you want to avoid the hot summer sun, be sure to sit on the third-base side!).\n\nIf that’s not enough, you can spend hours discovering the Smithsonian Museums. There are too many to tackle in a single day, but the Museum of Natural History and Air & Space Museum are must-visits.\n\nIn a city like this, you’re surrounded by history. So make the most of it and visit the memorials on and around the National Mall – from Lincoln and Jefferson to Martin Luther King. Alternatively, take a tour of the Capitol Building and explore the seat of the United States Congress up close.\n\nFor dining and drinks, the Eastern Market is a one-stop shop. Downtown Wharf and Georgetown Harbour are also worth a wander – there are several restaurant options, along with beautiful views of the Potomac River.\n\nIf there’s still gas in the tank after a long day, ride up to the top of the Washington Monument for a great view of the city. It’s worth the long lines for a perfect sunset moment.\n\nThe stadium\n\nAudi Field seats 20,000 and is home to no less than four different teams: DC United, DC Power and our August opponents Washington Spirit, as well as the DC Defenders American football team.\n\nSince opening its doors in July 2018, the stadium has played host to a number of top-tier fixtures – including our men's match against the MLS All-Stars during our 2023 USA tour. As well as enjoying a 5-0 win with goals from Gabriel Jesus, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Martinelli, Declan Rice made his first appearance in an Arsenal shirt on this pitch almost a year ago."
