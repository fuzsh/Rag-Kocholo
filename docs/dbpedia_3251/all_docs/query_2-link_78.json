        "text": "Tradition, that feeling of belonging that is passed from one generation to the next. Stories, rituals, and customs that gave sense to something. And no one knows better what tradition means like the University of Notre Dame with its 130 years of history as one of the most legendary universities in the United States.\n\nAt Notre Dame, tradition runs deep, and there's no arguing that every time the school name is mentioned, our thoughts turn football (American) glory, as Notre Dame is synonymous with football, and grand part of it is also its stadium, which for decades have been considered by the Fighting Irish's fans as sacred ground.\n\nNo one could ever think that something rather than football would take place on the hallowed field, a field that has seen 11 championships, despite not seen one since 1988, but these few acres on campus, are about to be present for a different type of story.\n\nLiverpool FC vs. Borussia Dortmund\n\nTimes change and the first soccer game ever is set to be staged at Notre Dame following the confirmation that Liverpool FC will face Borussia Dortmund as a 2019-20 pre-seaon friendly game.\n\nLiverpool are in the hunt to secure a Premier League title, something they hadn't achieved since the 1989-90 season and are in the semi-final of the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League where they face FC Barcelona.\n\nBorussia Dortmund too are fighting for the Bundesliga title training leaders Bayern Munich by one point with four matches still to play.\n\nTwo teams with tradition and history in the world of football will merge with the history of an iconic place such as Notre Dame Stadium on July 19, a date to be saved for posterity.\n\nNot even Notre Dame can fall behind the new era"
