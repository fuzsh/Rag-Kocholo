        "text": "It will not quite be midnight in Moscow when the UEFA Champions League final kicks off Wednesday in Moscow. It will happen at 10:45 p.m. local time to accommodate prime-time TV in Western Europe. The first all-English final, between Manchester United and Chelsea, has been the talk of the soccer world as an estimated 45,000 English fans streamed into the Russian capital for the match.\n\nUnited its chasing its third title after victories in 1968, over Benfica, and 1999, against Bayern Munich. Chelsea is in the final for the first time.\n\nThe game will be played at Luzhniki Stadium, which has a capacity of nearly 85,000. The stadium’s artificial turf playing surface has been covered with sod, not once, but twice after the first surface was deemed unacceptable.\n\nHere are some facts and deep trivia from the history of the UEFA Champions League and its predecessor the European Cup, our A to Z (that’s Zee, not Zed!):\n\nA Athens is the only city in Europe to have sent three teams — Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and AEK — into the competition in the same year.\n\nB George Best: In 1968, 10 years after the Munich air crash that decimated Manchester United’s Busby Babes, the iconic player from Northern Ireland played with verve and determination in leading the Red Devils to a 4-1 victory in extra time over Benfica of Portugal at Wembley Stadium. United became the first English team to win the Cup.\n\nC Comeback: The last time Manchester United played in the final was in the 1999 against Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Bayern took a 1-0 lead on a goal in the sixth minute by Mario Bassler. It stood up through the first half and into second half injury time. Both teams were chasing three titles that season — United had already won the Premier League and F.A. Cup. Bayern had won the Bundesliga and was preparing for the German Cup final, which was scheduled to be played after the Champions League title match. Referee Pierluigi Collina signaled three minutes of stoppage time just before United’s Teddy Sheringham, a second-half substitute, headed home a corner from David Beckham at 90:36. The super-sub Ole Gunnar Solskjaer then directed a Sheringham header past an incredulous Bayern keeper Oliver Kahn. Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson captured the improbable, impossible comeback with these words: “Football, bloody hell.”.\n\nD Dutch Masters: It seems only a bit incongruous that three players from the Netherlands formed the backbone of a top Italian side, A.C. Milan, which won two straight titles (1988-89 and 1989-90). The threesome was Marco van Basten (the manager of the Dutch national team), Ruud Gullit (the coach of the Los Angeles Galaxy of M.L.S.) and Frank Rijkaard (who was fired earlier this month as manager of Barcelona).\n\nE Eleven: that is the number of championships won by clubs from Italy (A.C. Milan, 7; Juventus, 2; Inter Milan 2), Spain (Real Madrid, 9; Barcelona, 2) and England (Liverpool, 5; Manchester United, 2; Nottingham Forest, 2; Aston Villa, 1 … and either Manchester United or Chelsea this season).\n\nF A French magazine, L’Equipe, engineered the founding of the tournament, but only one French team — Olympique Marseille in 1992-93 — has won the continental title, the first year it was known as the UEFA Champions League. Marseille was later barred from defending its title when French officials determined that the club’s owner, Bernard Tapie, had played a role in fixing matches.\n\nG Greatest game: The 1960 European Cup final was played before 135,000 fans (still the largest for a final in the competition) at Hampden Park in Glasgow. In the game, Real Madrid spotted Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany the first goal, then scored the next seven unanswered in a 7-3 victory. For Real, Alfred di Stéfano scored three goals and Ferenc Puskas had four.\n\nH Heysel: The 1985 final in Brussels will be remembered forever as the day 39 Juventus fans died when a riot broke out before the game and Italian fans were trapped against a fence while others were trampled. With the players in their locker rooms unaware of the events outside, UEFA made the decision to carry on with the game, which was won by Juventus, 1-0. The ensuing investigation led to a five-year suspension of English clubs from European competition and the banishment of Liverpool for six years. Only two English teams — Manchester United in 1999 and Liverpool in 2005 — have won the title since. That will change Wednesday.\n\nI The Italian striker Filippo Inzaghi is the only player to score two hat tricks in the competition, both when he was playing for Juventus. He scored his first during a 4-1 victory over Dynamo Kiev in the quarterfinals in 1997-98 and got another three goals in a 4-4 draw against Hamburg SV in a group stage match in the 2000-1 tournament.\n\nJ Jens Lehmann, Arsenal’s mercurial German goalkeeper, became the first player to be shown a red card in a final when he was ejected from the 2005-6 game against Barcelona in Paris. In the game’s 18th minute, Ronaldinho found Samuel Eto’o with a through ball. Lehmann was forced to race off his line. Eto’o pushed the ball past Lehmann and was brought down on the edge of the penalty area, setting up a free kick. Arsenal, playing with 10 men, took the lead on a goal by Sol Campbell late in the first half, but Barcelona went on to win the match on second half goals by Eto’o and Juliano Belletti.\n\nK Dynamo Kiev, the Ukrainian club, is the most successful club from the former Soviet Union in the Champions League. Kiev has advanced to the semifinals three times (1977, 1987 and 1999), but has never advanced past that stage.\n\nL L’Equipe, a French sports magazine, and its editor, Gabriel Hanot, are credited with being the driving forces behind the inauguration of the tournament in 1955. It began as a competition for the winners of their national leagues and was named the European Champions Clubs’ Cup, which was shortened to the European Cup.\n\nM Roy Makaay, the Dutch striker, scored the fastest Champions League goal, only 10.2 seconds into the match, when Bayern Munich played Real Madrid in 2007.\n\nN Nicknames: The Blond Arrow (Alfred di Stéfano) and the Galloping Major (Ferenc Puskas) are the only two players from the 1950s still among the top 10 career goal scorers in the European Cup/Champions League. Di Stéfano, a native of Argentina, played in 58 games and scored 49 goals, all for Real Madrid; the Hungarian Puskas scored 36 goals in 41 games for Budapest Honved and Real Madrid.\n\nO One Hundred Appearances: Nine players have played in 100 European Cup/Champions League games — Paolo Maldini, Roberto Carlos, Oliver Kahn, Raúl, Luís Figo, David Beckham, Clarence Seedorf, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.\n\nP Bob Paisley is the only man to coach three championship teams when Liverpool won the title in 1977, 1978 and 1981.\n\nQ Only one team — Glasgow Celtic — has ever completed a quadruple, which included winning the European Cup. In the 1966-67 Celtic won its domestic league championship, two domestic cups and the European title.\n\nR Real Madrid has won the title a record nine times (and lost in three other finals; 1962, 1964 and 1981). Real dominated in the early years, when the competition was called the European Cup — winning the first five championships 1956-1960. Real last won the Champions League title in 2002.\n\nS Six in a row: English clubs won six straight titles from 1976-77 to 1981-82. Liverpool won three times (1976-77, 1977-78 and 1980-81), Nottingham Forest twice (1978-79 and 1979-80) and Aston Villa once (1981-82).\n\nT Trevor Francis, the first player to be transferred between English teams for a one million pound fee, scored the game’s only goal as Nottingham Forest, led by Manager Brian Clough, defeated Malmo of Sweden in the 1979 final in Munich. Forest would go on to defend its championship the next season, but Francis missed that final with an injured Achilles’ tendon.\n\nU Under the Lights: For the first time in the history of the European Cup, the final will be switched from Wednesday to Saturday night for the 2009-10 competition. The final will be played at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. “I did not see many children or families in Athens because Wednesday is a school night,” UEFA President Michel Platini said in last December. “Moving it to Saturday should make it more of a family occasion.”\n\nV Valencia of Spain has the dubious distinction of appearing in consecutive finals (1999-2000 and 2000-1) and losing both. Valencia, which had won the Spanish Cup over Barcelona, lost the first final by 3-0 to Real Madrid. The next year, Valencia swept past Arsenal in the quarterfinals and then Leeds United in the semifinals before losing to Bayern Munich in a penalty kick shootout.\n\nW The old Wembley Stadium in London has hosted more European Cup or Champions League finals than any other stadium; five in 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978 and 1992.\n\nX Xabi Alonso capped a tremendous comeback for Liverpool in the 2004-5 final against A.C. Milan scoring in the 60th minute to tie the game, help send it to extra time and, eventually, penalty kicks, where Liverpool won. Milan took a 3-0 lead in the first half. But after the break, Alonso and his central-midfield mate Steven Gerrard engineered six of the most thrilling minutes of Champions League soccer when the Reds stormed back.\n\nY The Nigerian defender Celestine Babayaro is the youngest to play in a Champions League match. He appeared for Anderlecht of Belgium against Steaua Bucuresti in November 1994 when he was 16 years 87 days old.\n\nZ Crvena Zvezda — Red Star Belgrade — is the only team from any of the countries that made up the former Yugoslavia to win the European Cup. the Serbian team beat Olympique Marseille of France in a penalty kick shootout in the 1990-91 final played in Bari, Italy."
