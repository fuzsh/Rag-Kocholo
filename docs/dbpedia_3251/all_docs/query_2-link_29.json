        "text": "Manchester United’s nightmare season came to a disappointing end Sunday in Southampton, where a 1-1 draw left the team in seventh place for the season, and out of European competition entirely next year. United started the day three points behind Tottenham yet clinging to a superior goal difference, but Spurs crushed Aston Villa 3-0 to secure the second and final place in the Europa League.\n\nThe first season after legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down was always going to be tough, but it couldn’t have gone much worse for United. David Moyes as a league-wide laughing stock for months before he was finally sacked in late April. Despite the arrival of Juan Mata from Chelsea, losses to Stoke, Liverpool, Manchester City, Everton and Sunderland since the transfer window sealed United’s fate, and the repercussions of finishing seventh will likely be felt all summer long in the transfer market.\n\nFor the first time since the the 1989-90 season, Manchester United will not participate in European competition, and will have only the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup to play for. English teams were banned from European competition for five years after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, but United returned to win the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1991. Since then, the Red Devils have played in the UEFA Cup or the Champions League every single year."
