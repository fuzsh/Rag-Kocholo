No fewer than 6 different English and 5 different Dutch clubs have reached double figures at least once, for in total 8 and 7 times, respectively.\n\nThe only clubs to have conceded double figures more than once are are APOEL from Lefkosia (on 3 occasions, all in the CWC), Anorthosis Famagusta, Floriana, KR (Reykjavík), Red Boys Differdange and Reipas Lahti, all twice. No fewer than 5 different Cypriotic clubs (for in total 8 times) and 4 different clubs from Luxembourg and Malta (on 5 occasions in total) have been destroyed in this manner.\n\nThe only club to have both reached and conceded double figures in European competition is Anderlecht.\n\nChampions' Cup/League\n\n1956/57, prel. rd.: Manchester United 10-0 Anderlecht 1962/63, 1st round: Ipswich Town 10-0 Floriana 1965/66, 1st round: Benfica 10-0 Stade Dudelange 1966/67, 1st round: Haka (Valkeakoski) 1-10 Anderlecht 1969/70, 1st round: Feĳenoord 12-2 KR (Reykjavík) Leeds United 10-0 SFK Lyn (Oslo) 1970/71, 1st round: Borussia Mönchengladbach 10-0 EPA (Larnaka) 1973/74, 1st round: Dinamo Bucuresti 11-0 Crusaders 1979/80, 2nd round: Ajax 10-0 Omonia (Lefkosia) 1980/81, 1st round: Liverpool 10-1 OPS (Oulu) 2011/12, 2nd.qual.: HJK (Helsinki) 10-0 Bangor City\n\nCup Winners' Cup\n\n1961/62, prel. rd.: Újpesti Dózsa 10-2 Floriana 1963/64, 2nd round: Sporting CP (Lisboa) 16-1 APOEL (Lefkosia) 1964/65, 1st round: Sparta Praha 10-0 Anorthosis (Famagusta) 1965/66, 1st round: Reipas (Lahti) 2-10 Honvéd (Budapest) 1967/68, 1st round: Aberdeen 10-0 KR (Reykjavík) 1968/69, 1st round: Dunfermline Athletic 10-1 APOEL (Lefkosia) 1969/70, 1st round: Lierse SK 10-1 APOEL (Lefkosia) 1971/72, 1st round: Chelsea 13-0 Jeunesse Hautcharage 1973/74, 1st round: Malmö FF 11-0 Pezoporikos (Larnaka) 1974/75, 1st round: Liverpool 11-0 Strømsgodset IF (Drammen) PSV (Eindhoven) 10-0 Ards (Newtonards) 1976/77, 1st round: Levski-Spartak (Sofia) 12-2 Reipas (Lahti) 1982/83, 1st round: Swansea City 12-0 Sliema Wanderers 1983/84, 1st round: Rangers 10-0 Valletta 1994/95, prel. rd.: Maribor Branik 10-0 Norma Tallinn 1997/98, 1st round: Roda JC (Kerkrade) 10-0 Hapoel Beersheba\n\nFairs' Cup\n\n1961/62, 1st round: MTK (Budapest) 10-2 RC Strasbourg 1962/63, 1st round: Roma 10-1 Altay (Izmir) 1965/66, 1st round: 1.FC Köln 13-0 US Luxembourg 1969/70, 1st round: Liverpool 10-0 Dundalk\n\nUEFA Cup/Europa League\n\n1972/73, 1st round: US Rumelange 0-12 Feyenoord 1976/77, 1st round: Derby County 12-0 Finn Harps 1977/78, 1st round: AZ '67 (Alkmaar) 11-1 Red Boys Differdange 1983/84, 1st round: Austria (Wien) 10-0 Aris Bonnevoie Bayern München 10-0 Anorthosis (Famagusta) Rabat Ajax 0-10 TJ Internacionál (Bratislava) 1984/85, 1st round: Ajax 14-0 Red Boys Differdange 1999/00, prel. rd.: CE Principat 0-11 Viking FK (Stavanger) 2000/01, prel. rd.: Constel-lació 0-10 Rayo Vallecano\n\nCountry- and Citywise Feats\n\nHere an overview is presented of countries and cities performing well in two or more Cups in the same season.\n\nWinning all three Cups\n\nOnly once, one country won all three European cups: in 1989/90, Italy won the Champions' Cup through Milan, the Cup Winners' Cup through Sampdoria, and the UEFA Cup through Juventus. Curiously enough, all three were beaten in the 1990/91 Coppa Italia by one and the same team, Roma.\n\nWinning two Cups\n\nThe following countries have won 2 Cups in one season (apart from Italy's feat in 1989/90 above):\n\nSpain 9 times (1957/58 CC and FC, 1959/60 CC and FC, 1961/62 CWC and FC, 1965/66 CC and FC, 2005/06 CC and UEFA, 2013/14 CC and EL, 2014/15 CC and EL, 2015/16 CC and EL, 2017/18 CC and EL) Italy 5 times (1960/61 CWC and FC, 1988/89 CC and UEFA, 1992/93 CC and UEFA, 1993/94 CC and UEFA, 1998/99 CWC and UEFA) England 5 times (1967/68 CC and FC, 1969/70 CWC and FC, 1970/71 CWC and FC, 1980/81 CC and UEFA, 2018/19 CC end EL) Germany 2 times (1974/75 CC and UEFA, 1996/97 CC and UEFA)\n\nThe only cities to have won two Cups in one season are Milano (1993/94) and Madrid (2017/18).\n\nReaching three different Finals\n\nThe following countries has representatives in each of the three continental finals in the same season:\n\nItaly 1988/89 [Milan won the CC final, Sampdoria lost the CWC final, Napoli won the UEFA Cup] 1989/90 [Milan won the CC final, Sampdoria won the CWC final, Juventus beat Fiorentina for the UEFA Cup] 1992/93 [Milan lost the CC final, Parma won the CWC final, Juventus won the UEFA Cup] 1993/94 [Milan won the CC final, Parma lost the CWC final, Internazionale won the UEFA Cup] Spain 1961/62 [Real Madrid lost the CC final, Atlético de Madrid won the CWC final, Valencia beat Barcelona for the Fairs' Cup] 1985/86 [Barcelona lost the CC final, Atlético de Madrid lost the CWC final, Real Madrid won the UEFA Cup]\n\nItaly in 1989/90 and Spain in 1961/62 were the only two countries to have fielded four of the six finalists until in 2018/19 England provided all four finalists in the two remaining competitions, three of them from London.\n\nIn 1997/98, Italy also fielded three finalists, but two of those played the UEFA Cup final. In 2013/14 and 2015/16, Spain fielded three finalists, two in the Champions League and one in the Europa League final.\n\nReaching two different Finals\n\nThe following countries had clubs in two finals (including the six occasions above in which a country boasted representatives in three finals):\n\n13 times: Spain (1957/58, 1959/60, 1961/62, 1962/63, 1963/64, 1965/66, 1985/86, 2000/01, 2005/06, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2017/18) 12 times: Italy (1960/61, 1964/65, 1972/73, 1983/84, 1988/89, 1989/90, 1992/93, 1993/94, 1994/95, 1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99) 11 times: England (1967/68, 1969/70, 1970/71, 1972/73, 1975/76, 1979/80, 1980/81, 1983/84, 1984/85, 2005/06, 2018/19 [*]) 7 times: Germany (1974/75, 1976/77, 1978/79, 1979/80, 1981/82, 1996/97, 2001/02) twice: Belgium (1975/76, 1977/78) once: France (1995/96) Netherlands (1987/88) Scotland (1966/67) [*] in 2018/19 England accounted for both finalists in the Champions League and in the Europa League.\n\nCities with 2 finalists in one season:\n\nMadrid (five times, in 1961/62, 1985/86, 2013/14, 2015/16 and 2017/18) Glasgow (1966/67) Liverpool (1984/85) Milano (1993/94) London (2018/19 - three finalists)\n\nReaching the Semifinals in all three Cups\n\nThe following countries had clubs in all semifinals in the same season [the number between square brackets indicates exactly how many teams the country fielded in the semifinals that season]:\n\n10 times: Italy (1964/65 [3], 1967/68 [3], 1988/89 [3], 1989/90 [4], 1992/93 [3], 1993/94 [4], 1994/95 [4], 1996/97 [3], 1997/98 [4], 1998/99 [4]) 5 times: England (1964/65 [3], 1965/66 [5], 1969/70 [3], 1972/73 [4], 1983/84 [4]) 3 times: Germany (1973/74 [3], 1975/76 [3], 1978/79 [5]) twice: Spain (1961/62 [4], 1985/86 [3]) once: Scotland (1966/67 [3]) France (1995/96 [3])\n\nEngland (1965/66) and Germany (1978/79) have the record of fielding five of the 12 semifinalists; Germany repeated this feat in 1979/80 (but did not have semifinalists in all three tournaments: one in the Champions' Cup and four in the UEFA Cup). Italy twice had teams in the semifinals of all the Cups in three consecutive seasons (1992-95 and 1996-99).\n\nSpain fielded 3 semifinalists in the Champions League 1999/2000 (but none in the only other remaining tournament, that for the UEFA Cup). Italy improved on that in 2002/03, fielding 3 semifinalists in the Champions League and one in the UEFA Cup. In 2006/07, England had 3 semifinalists in the Champions League, but none in the UEFA Cup. In 2013/14 and in 2015/16 Spain fielded 2 semifinalists in both the Champions League and the Europa League (the new name for the UEFA Cup). In 2018/19, England also fielded two semifinalists in both tournaments, and all four reached the final.\n\nReaching the Quarterfinals in all three Cups\n\nThe following records only apply to seasons in which the Cup Winners' Cup was played, i.e. the 39 seasons from 1960/61 until 1998/99.\n\nThe following countries had clubs in all quarterfinals in the same season [the number between square brackets indicates exactly how many teams the country fielded in the quarterfinals that season]:\n\n19 times: Italy (1961/62 [3], 1962/63 [3], 1964/65 [3], 1967/68 [3], 1969/70 [3], 1971/72 [4], 1982/83 [3], 1984/85 [3], 1988/89 [4], 1989/90 [4], 1990/91 [6], 1991/92 [4], 1992/93 [4], 1993/94 [6], 1994/95 [5], 1995/96 [4], 1996/97 [3], 1997/98 [4], 1998/99 [6]) 14 times: England (1960/61 [3], 1964/65 [3], 1965/66 [5], 1968/69 [4], 1969/70 [4], 1970/71 [6], 1972/73 [4], 1976/77 [3], 1978/79 [4], 1980/81 [3], 1983/84 [4], 1984/85 [4], 1996/97 [3], 1997/98 [3]) Germany (1960/61 [3], 1963/64 [3], 1972/73 [4], 1973/74 [4], 1975/76 [4], 1978/79 [5], 1980/81 [3], 1981/82 [4], 1982/83 [3], 1985/86 [3], 1988/89 [4], 1993/94 [5], 1995/96 [3], 1997/98 [5]) Spain (1961/62 [5], 1964/65 [4], 1965/66 [5], 1967/68 [3], 1977/78 [3], 1982/83 [4], 1985/86 [3], 1986/87 [3], 1988/89 [3], 1991/92 [3], 1995/96 [4], 1996/97 [4], 1997/98 [3], 1998/99 [4]) 5 times: France (1979/80 [3], 1989/90 [3], 1994/95 [3], 1995/96 [3], 1996/97 [3]) 4 times: Belgium (1976/77 [3], 1987/88 [3], 1989/90 [4], 1991/92 [3]) Netherlands (1970/71 [3], 1977/78 [3], 1992/93 [3], 1995/96 [3]) 3 times: Soviet Union (1983/84 [3], 1984/85 [3], 1990/91 [3]) twice: Scotland (1966/67 [3], 1968/69 [3]) once: CSSR (1963/64 [3]) Hungary (1965/66 [3]) Portugal (1993/94 [3]) Romania (1988/89 [3])\n\nOnly in the season 1974/75 there was not a single country fielding a team in each of the quarterfinals. In 1995/96 there were no fewer than 5 such countries (together responsible for 17 of the 24 quarterfinalists).\n\nThe record of fielding 6 of the 24 quarterfinalists is held by Italy (thrice, in 1990/91, 1993/94 and 1998/99) and England (1970/71); Germany (1979/80) also boasted 6 quarterfinalists, but not in all three Cups (1 in the CC and 5 in the UEFA Cup). Italy fielded quarterfinalists in all three competitions for eleven consecutive seasons: 1988/89 until 1998/99. By the way, in the first season after the Cup Winners' Cup had been abolished, 1999/00, Italy failed to field a single team in the UEFA Cup quarterfinals (although 4 Italian teams reached the 1/8 finals). The same happened again in 2000/01 - in fact, even worse for the Italians: none of their clubs reached any quarterfinal, neither in the Champions' League nor in the UEFA Cup that season.\n\nTwo cities managed to field three quarterfinalists (one in each tournament) in one season:\n\nBudapest (1965/66) Bucuresti (1988/89)\n\nOther Curiosities\n\nFC Barcelona are the only club to have played two quarterfinals in the same season: in the Champions' Cup and the Fairs' Cup of 1960/61.\n\nManchester United won their first two European Cups (Champions' Cup 1967/68 and Cup Winners' Cup 1990/91) in spite of finishing behind city rivals Manchester City in the English league; in revenge, Manchester United finished ahead of City in the season (1969/70) the latter won the Cup Winners' Cup. This spell was broken in 1998/99, when United won the treble while City managed to get out of the Second Division - both scoring two extremely late goals to do so.\n\nMost Participations\n\nBelow we list all clubs to have entered European competitions on 20 or more occasions. Between square brackets the participations are split according to the competitions (first Champions' Cup or Champions League, then Cup Winners' Cup, then Fairs' Cup and UEFA Cup or Europa League; negative numbers between separate brackets indicate the number of seasons a club entered both the Champions League and the UEFA Cup or Europa League; for Barcelona this includes the 1960/61 season in which they entered both the Champions' Cup and the Fairs' Cup, the only time any club participated in both competitions simultaneously - Barcelona also competed in both the Fairs Cup 1958-60 and the Champions' Cup 1959/60 but as the first started in 1958 Barcelona's entry is counted for the 1958/59 season).\n\nNote that seasons in which a club withdrew before playing a single match (such as a number of Eastern European clubs in 1968/69) are not included.\n\nAll numbers up to and including the 2019/20 season.\n\n63 [50- 4- 9] Real Madrid 62 [30-13-21] [- 2] Barcelona 59 [34- 7-23] [- 5]

During the 2003/04 UEFA Cup they overtook Crvena zvezda and after Israel attacked Lebanon in the summer of 2006, Israeli clubs were again forced to play home matches at neutral venues and Maccabi
