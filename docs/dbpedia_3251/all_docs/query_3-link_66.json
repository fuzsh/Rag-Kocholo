        "text": "Mo Dehui (Pinyin), Wade-Giles Mo Teh-hui (b. April 26, 1883, Xinjiang province, China - d. April 17, 1968, Taipei, Taiwan), civil governor of Fengtian (1926-27). He was also acting minister of agriculture and commerce (1925) and minister of agriculture and industry (1927-28) of China and president of the Examination Yuan in Taiwan (1954-66).\n\nMoalla, Mansour (b. May 1, 1930, Sfax, Tunisia), finance minister of Tunisia (1980-83). He was also minister of posts, telegraphs, and telephones (1969-70) and planning (1970-74, 1980-83).\n\nMoavero\n\nMoavero Milanesi, Enzo (b. Aug. 17, 1954, Rome, Italy), foreign minister of Italy (2018-19). He was also minister without portfolio (European affairs) (2011-13).\n\nMoawad\n\nMoawad, René (Anis), Arabic Rini (Anis) Mu`awwad (b. April 17, 1925, Zgharta, Lebanon - d. Nov. 22, 1989, Beirut, Lebanon), president of Lebanon (1989). A member of a powerful Maronite Christian family in the north of Lebanon, he became involved in politics and was a member of parliament from 1957 to 1989. Between 1960 and 1982 he served in a number of posts, including chairman of the Administration of Justice Parliamentary Commission (1959-61), chairman of the Budget and Finance Commission (from 1960), minister of post and telecommunications (1961-64), minister of public works (1969), and minister of education and fine arts (1980-82). In the latter role he cut through sectarian hatred and organized school examinations for Christian and Muslim children whose studies had been interrupted by the civil war that began in 1975. In a special session of parliament, on Nov. 5, 1989, he was elected president - a post Lebanon's 1943 charter specified had to be held by a Maronite - over the objections of Maronite Gen. Michel Aoun, who denounced Moawad as a Syrian puppet. Moawad pledged to implement an Arab League-sponsored plan for peace between Muslims and Christians that included a Syrian role in the process, but he was killed just 17 days later by a car bomb that also took the lives of over 20 others. The bombing took place as Moawad and other officials returned from a ceremony celebrating the 46th year of Lebanese independence from French rule. In 2005-08 his widow Nayla (b. July 3, 1940, Bsharri, Lebanon) was minister of social affairs - Lebanon's first female minister.\n\nMobando Yogo, Yves (b. Oct. 20, 1955), governor of Équateur (2004-07).\n\nMoberly, Sir John (Campbell) (b. May 27, 1925, Exmouth, Devon, England - d. Sept. 14, 2004, Reading, Berkshire, England), British political agent in Qatar (1959-62); knighted 1984. He was ambassador to Jordan (1975-79) and Iraq (1982-85).\n\nMobutu Ndimba, Malo (b. April 14, 1982), governor of Nord-Ubangi (2022- ); grandson of Mobutu Sese Seko.\n\nMobutu Nzanga\n\nMobutu Nzanga (Ngbangawe), (François Joseph) (b. March 24, 1970, Kinshasa, Congo), Congolese politician; son of Mobutu Sese Seko. He lived in exile in 1997-2002. After his return, he founded the Union of Mobutist Democrats in 2005 and was chosen as its presidential candidate. He finished fourth with 4.8% of the votes in the first round on July 30, 2006. On September 20, he concluded an alliance with Pres. Joseph Kabila who appointed him as minister of state in charge of agriculture on Feb. 5, 2007. In October 2008 he became deputy prime minister in charge of basic social needs. He was fired in March 2011 for spending more than three months in Europe.\n\nMobutu S.S.\n\nMobutu Sese Seko (Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga) (loosely, \"The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake\"), original name (until Jan. 10, 1972) Joseph-Désiré Mobutu (b. Oct. 14, 1930, Lisala, near Coquilhatville [now Mbandaka], Équateur province, Belgian Congo [now Congo (Kinshasa)] - d. Sept. 7, 1997, Rabat, Morocco), president of Congo (Léopoldville/Kinshasa)/Zaire (1965-97); nephew of Litho Moboti Nzoyombo. At the Congo's attainment of independence in July 1960, the coalition government of Pres. Joseph Kasavubu and Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba appointed him secretary of state for defense and then chief of staff. A power struggle developed between Kasavubu and Lumumba, and in September 1960, Mobutu seized control of the government and announced that he was \"neutralizing\" all politicians. In February 1961, however, Mobutu turned over the government to Kasavubu. In return, the latter made Mobutu commander in chief of the armed forces. In 1965, after another power struggle had developed between Kasavubu and Premier Moise Tshombe, Mobutu removed Kasavubu in a CIA-backed coup and assumed the presidency himself. He moved to Africanize names in the nation; the name of the country was changed in 1971 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Republic of Zaire. He was reelected to the presidency in one-man contests in 1970, 1977, and 1984. The term kleptocracy was coined to define his despotic regime. He took full advantage of the backing he received from the West, which viewed him during the Cold War as a guardian against Communism. In 1996 rebel forces led by Laurent Kabila were able to seize ever-larger amounts of territory. On May 16, 1997, Mobutu abandoned the country to Kabila and went into exile in Morocco.\n\nMoçâmedes, José de Almeida e Vasconcelos (Soveral de Carvalho da Maia Soares de Albergaria), (1º) barão de (b. 1737, São Pedro do Sul, Portugal - d. ...), governor of Goiás (1772-78) and Angola (1784-90). He became barão de Moçâmedes on Aug. 13, 1779.\n\nMoch\n\nMoch, Jules (Salvador) (b. March 15, 1893, Paris, France - d. Aug. 1, 1985, Cabris, Alpes-Maritimes, France), French politician. Elected député in 1928, he became minister for public works in the Popular Front government ten years later. After the fall of France in 1940, he voted against Marshal Philippe Pétain, was interned, was freed in 1941, and joined the Resistance, then Gen. Charles de Gaulle's Free French Forces in England. Returning to the Ministry of Public Works after World War II, he later became minister of the interior (1947-50), where he helped to build up the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité, a special police unit used to combat civil disturbance. He was then minister of defense (1950-51) and delegate to the UN Disarmament Committee (1953-60). His opposition to the European Defense Community Treaty brought conflict within his own party; he turned to the study of disarmament questions and participated actively in the creation of Pugwash, the international movement for world peace. On May 14, 1958, favouring a centre-left government, he returned to the Ministry of the Interior under Premier Pierre Pflimlin to confront an expected invasion by parachutists of the disaffected French Army units in Algeria. He resigned on May 31. He was among the Socialists who voted for the return of de Gaulle and became a member of the bureau of the French Section of the Workers' International (as the Socialist Party was then called). His hostility to Communism finally led him to resign from the Socialist Party in 1974, in protest against its alliance with the French Communist Party - the \"union of the left\" entered into by Socialist leader François Mitterrand in 1972.\n\nMochizuki, Keisuke (b. April 1 [Feb. 27, lunar calendar], 1867, in present Hiroshima prefecture, Japan - d. Jan. 1, 1941, Tokyo, Japan), home affairs minister of Japan (1928-29).

He has also been secretary-general of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (1994, 1999-2001), minister of social development (1998-99) and public education (2018-21), and ambassador to the United States (2021- ).\n\nMocumbi, Pascoal (Manuel) (b. April 10, 1941, Lourenço Marques [now Maputo], Mozambique - d. March 25, 2023), foreign minister (1987-94) and prime minister (1994-2004) of Mozambique. He was also minister of health (1980-87).\n\nMoczar\n\nMoczar, Mieczyslaw, byname Mietek, original name Mikolaj Demko (b. Dec. 25, 1913, Lódz, Poland - d. Nov. 1, 1986, Warsaw, Poland), Polish politician. He joined the Communist Party of Poland in 1937. He took the name Moczar from the Communist guerrilla group - Moczary (\"swamps\") - which he commanded during World War II. The postwar regime in Poland was dominated by those Communists who had spent the war years in Moscow. Moczar was chairman of the Presidium of the People's Council of Olsztyn (1948-52), Bialystok (1952-54), and Warszawa (1954-56) województwa and minister of state farms (1956). However, after Wladyslaw Gomulka assumed the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party (PUWP) in 1956, Moczar's political career advanced rapidly. As interior minister (1964-68) he was a key figure in a campaign launched in 1967 against \"revisionists\" and \"Zionists.\" His own bid to succeed Gomulka was unsuccessful; in December 1970 Edward Gierek became party leader while Moczar became a full member of the Politburo. In June 1971 Moczar was dropped from the PUWP Secretariat and in December from the Politburo, apparently at the insistence of Moscow. He staged a dramatic but brief comeback when the emergence of the Solidarnosc (Solidarity) trade-union movement plunged the PUWP leadership into crisis; he was again a Politburo member in 1980-81.

Sept. 17, 1950, Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay state [now in Gujarat], India), chief minister of Gujarat (2001-14) and prime minister of India (2014- ). Of humble origins, he joined the Hindu-nationalist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in 1972 and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1987. In 1995 he helped form in Gujarat the first-ever BJP-controlled government in India. In 1998 he became BJP general secretary. In 2001 the BJP chose him to replace party colleague Keshubhai Patel as chief minister of Gujarat. He ran in his first election in February 2002, winning a seat in the Gujarat state assembly. Shortly afterwards the state was engulfed by riots triggered when a group of Muslims set fire to a train in the city of Godhra, killing dozens of Hindu passengers. Modi was accused of condoning the violence in which about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. In 2005 the United States declined to issue Modi a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for the 2002 riots, and the United Kingdom also criticized his role. Although Modi himself was never indicted on any charges of inciting communal violence, some of his close associates received lengthy jail sentences for their role in the events. Modi's administration was also accused of being involved in extrajudicial killings termed \"fake encounters.\" Despite the controversies, the BJP secured significant victories in elections to the state assembly in 2002, 2007, and 2012. Modi established a reputation as an able administrator and was given credit for the rapid growth of the state's economy. In 2013 he was chosen leader of the BJP. He led the party to a resounding victory in the 2014 general election and was able to form a government without seeking coalition partners. While his supporters claimed he stood for good governance and economic growth, others said he represented sectarian nationalism and favoured the rich. Ultimately the second aspect clearly came to the fore, in line with a worldwide recrudescence of nationalism. Muslims faced mob attacks from Hindu vigilante groups emboldened and in some cases directly supported by BJP politicians. It was this divisive rallying of the majority population, rather than a mixed economic picture, that led to his overwhelming reelection in 2019. In 2024 his coalition won again, but the BJP no longer had a majority on its own.\n\nJ. Modise\n\nModise, Joe, byname of Johannes Modise (b. May 23, 1929, Doornfontein, Johannesburg, South Africa - d. Nov. 26, 2001, Centurion, near Pretoria, South Africa), defense minister of South Africa (1994-99). He became an anti-apartheid activist in the 1950s and was one of 156 people charged in the lengthy Treason Trial, which started in 1956. The charges were later dropped. The killing of dozens of unarmed protesters at Sharpeville in 1960 and the subsequent banning of the African National Congress (ANC) led him and many other activists to embrace the concept of armed struggle against the increasingly repressive white-minority regime. He was on the high command of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, from its inception in 1961 and was appointed commander in 1965. He established bases in Tanzania, Angola, and Uganda. With backing from the Soviet Union and its Cold War allies, he also oversaw training programs in Cuba and Eastern Europe. After the Cold War ended and the ANC was unbanned, Modise was with the first group of negotiators to open talks with the Pretoria government in 1990. He became the country's first black minister of defense in 1994 when the ANC was swept to power and Nelson Mandela became president. As defense minister, he won praise for skillfully transforming an institution that was a key tool of state repression during the apartheid era, scoring high marks from some of the senior white officers he used to be at war with. But he was sharply criticized for a military debacle in tiny Lesotho in 1998, when South African and Botswanan troops went to the aid of the government there to help quell disorder in the wake of a mutiny. Over 60 soldiers, including several from South Africa, were killed during the operation, which many critics said should never have been launched in the first place. He retired from active politics in June 1999.\n\nT. Modise\n\nModise, Thandi (b.

Oct. 26, 1919, Tehran, Iran - d. July 27, 1980, Cairo, Egypt), shah of Iran (1941-79). He was the eldest son of Reza Pahlavi, the pro-German shah who was forced to abdicate in 1941 when the Soviet Union and Great Britain occupied Iran. Replacing his father on the throne, he played a leading role in suppressing the Soviet-sponsored \"autonomous\" states in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan in 1946. A struggle for control of the government developed with Mohammad Mossadegh, a zealous nationalist who in 1951 secured passage of a bill in the Majles (parliament) to nationalize the vast British petroleum interests in Iran. Mohammad Reza was forced to appoint the popular Mossadegh as premier shortly thereafter. In 1953 the shah tried to dismiss Mossadegh but was himself forced to leave the country by Mossadegh's supporters. Several days later, however, Mossadegh's opponents, with the covert support and assistance of the United States, restored Mohammad Reza to power, who reversed Mossadegh's nationalization. Having already divorced two wives unable to produce a son (Princess Fawzia of Egypt in 1948 and Soraya Esfandiari in 1958), in December 1959 he married Farah Diba; a crown prince, Reza, was born in Tehran on Oct. 31, 1960. On Sept. 15, 1965, the shah was given the title Aryamehr. On Oct. 26, 1967, he crowned himself and his wife at a lavish ceremony in the Golestan Palace, Tehran. Widespread dissatisfaction led in 1978 to the growth of support for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a Shi`ite religious leader living in exile in Paris. Amid rioting and turmoil, the shah left the country on Jan. 16, 1979 (though he did not abdicate), and Khomeini assumed control. A referendum resulted in the declaration on April 1, 1979, of an Islamic republic in Iran.

Nov. 3, 1618, Dhod, Malwa [now in Rajasthan, India] - d. March 2, 1707, Ahmednagar [now in Maharashtra, India]), emperor of India (1658-1707). He was the third son of the emperor Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal (for whom the Taj Mahal was built). His abilities and a taste for power brought him into rivalry with his eldest brother, Dara Shikoh, who was designated by their father as successor to the throne. A struggle for power broke out in 1657 and Aurangzeb decisively defeated Dara at Samugarh in May 1658. He confined his father in his own palace at Agra. In consolidating his power, Aurangzeb killed his three brothers, a son, and a nephew. At first Aurangzeb was a capable Muslim monarch of a mixed Hindu-Muslim empire. He was much occupied with safeguarding the northwest from Persians and Central Asian Turks and less so with the Maratha chief Shivaji, who twice plundered the great port of Surat (1664, 1670). Later, the pious ruler of an Islamic state replaced the seasoned statesman of a mixed kingdom; Hindus became subordinates, and the Marathas, like the southern Muslim kingdoms, were marked for annexation. The first overt sign of change was the reimposition of the jizya, or poll tax, on non-Muslims in 1679, which was followed by a Rajput revolt in 1680-81, supported by Aurangzeb's third son, Akbar. The Deccan kingdoms of Bijapur and Golconda were conquered in 1686-87, and the Maratha kingdom was broken up. The Marathas, however, adopted guerrilla tactics, spreading all over southern India amid a sympathetic population. Aurangzeb's warfare in the south prevented him from maintaining his former firm hold on the north. When the Sikh guru (spiritual leader) Tegh Bahadur refused to embrace Islam, he was executed (1675); the succeeding guru was in open rebellion for the rest of Aurangzeb's reign. Aurangzeb is considered the last great ruler of the Mughal Empire, which under him reached its greatest extent.\n\nMohyliov\n\nMohyliov, Anatoliy (Volodymyrovych) (b.

Sept. 2, 1924, Sacho, Baringo district, Rift Valley province, Kenya - d. Feb. 4, 2020, Nairobi, Kenya), president of Kenya (1978-2002). In 1950 he entered politics and five years later was nominated to the Kenya Legislative Council. He campaigned successfully in 1957 in the first elections for African members of the Legislative Council and became minister of education (1961-62) and local government (1962-64). In 1960 he led a breakaway movement from Jomo Kenyatta's Kenya African National Union (KANU), which was dominated by the two most influential tribes, the Kikuyu and the Luo. His own Kenya African Democratic Union was essentially an alliance of the smaller tribes that worked closely with a party of local white settlers. After independence (December 1963), his party merged with Kenyatta's in November 1964, and when Kenyatta became president in December 1964, Moi was made minister of home affairs. In January 1967 he became vice president of Kenya. He remained closely loyal to Kenyatta, and as the grand old man of Kenya became less active as a result of age, Moi was given increasing responsibility. Upon Kenyatta's death on Aug. 22, 1978, he became acting president; he was subsequently nominated for the presidency by KANU, and was elected (October 1978) with no opposition. He was reelected in 1979, 1983, 1988, 1992 (the first multiparty election), and 1997. Charges of fraud and corruption were leveled against him during several campaigns, but Moi ignored the critics. He was chairman of the Organization of African Unity in 1981-83. Although Moi was widely respected, he lacked the charisma of Kenyatta and had no strong independent political base of his own. He continued Kenyatta's pro-Western policies, which ensured significant sums of development aid during the Cold War.\n\nMoily, M(arpadi) Veerappa (b.

In 1952 he founded the Basutoland African Congress, later renamed Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). Like the Basotho National Party (BNP) and other groups, it opposed British rule, including the system of administration by tribal chiefs. The BNP gained control in 1966 of the newly independent nation's government, and in opposition Mokhehle led the BCP, which served as a voice of Pan-Africanism in the fledgling nation. He apparently won the country's first post-independence election in 1970, but was prevented from taking office when Leabua Jonathan seized power with the assistance of the army. In 1974 Mokhehle's party led a failed revolt, and he was forced into exile. From South Africa he continued to push for an end to unconstitutional rule while the paramilitary wing of the BCP, the Lesotho Liberation Army, carried out numerous attacks within Lesotho; in this connection he was willing to become party to the South African apartheid regime's destabilization policies in Lesotho. He returned to Lesotho in 1989. In 1993 the first democratic elections since 1970 were held. The BCP won all 65 legislative seats, and he became prime minister. In August 1994, King Letsie III and key military leaders staged a coup and dissolved the government and parliament, but intensive international pressure was brought to bear, and in September the elected government was restored. After opponents within the party tried to remove him as leader, he formed a new party in June 1997, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, taking a majority of MPs with him. He retired from politics in 1998, handing the reins of his party to Pakalitha Mosisili.\n\nMokhtar (bin) Ahmad, Tan Sri (Haji) Wan (b.

(He was not the inventor of \"Molotov cocktails,\" the bottles of inflammable liquid that the Finns had used against the Soviets in 1939 and mockingly named after him; however, the Soviet Union later itself used them against German tanks.) He gave up the post of foreign minister in 1949, but resumed it after Stalin's death (1953), until his disagreements with Nikita Khrushchev resulted in his dismissal (1956). He was made minister of state control, but when he joined the \"antiparty group\" that tried to depose Khrushchev in 1957, he lost all his high positions. He then became ambassador to Mongolia (1957-60) and Soviet delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna (1960-61).

Jan. 26, 1937, Binkolo, Bombali district, Northern province, Sierra Leone - d. Aug. 2, 2003, Guinea), president of Sierra Leone (1985-92). In 1958 he left the civil service to join the Royal West African Frontier Force, attending courses in Nigeria and England. He became captain in 1965 and major in 1966. In 1968, following the coup that restored constitutional government, he was arrested and spent seven months in detention. On his release he returned to the army. He advanced to colonel in 1970 and in 1971 was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He was promoted to brigadier in 1973, and in 1974 Pres. Siaka Stevens nominated him a member of parliament and made him a minister of state in the cabinet. In 1983 he was promoted to major general. When Stevens stood down in 1985, he was succeeded by Momoh after a carefully arranged single-candidate election in which Momoh received 99.85% of the vote. Initially, his integrity endeared him to the people, but his popularity soon faded when his government failed to eliminate corruption or improve the economy. He also appeared unwilling to remove associates of Stevens from key positions. He was ousted in 1992 and went into exile in neighbouring Guinea, but returned home in February 1997 at the urging of Pres. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. After Kabbah was deposed in a May 1997 coup, Momoh led a delegation to Guinea to plead with Pres. Lansana Conté to recognize the military junta of Johnny Paul Koroma. Conté refused to break ranks with other leaders of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States who condemned the coup and slapped an embargo on Sierra Leone. After West African forces restored Kabbah to power, Momoh was arrested (February 1998) when he tried to slip through a checkpoint in the capital disguised as a woman. In November 1998 he was found guilty of conspiracy but escaped a treason charge which could carry the death penalty. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Junta loyalists freed him from jail in January 1999 when they infiltrated Freetown and came close to capturing the city.\n\nMomotaro, Daisy A(lik) (b.

Oct. 10, 1819, Templemore, County Tipperary, Ireland - d. Nov. 29, 1894, Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland), governor (1861-67) and governor-general (1867-68) of Canada. On the death of his father he succeeded to the peerage of Ireland (as 4th Viscount and 4th Baron Monck) in 1849. After a defeat as a candidate in Wicklow in 1848, he was elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal member from Portsmouth in 1852 and was a lord of the treasury in 1855-58. Defeated in the general election of 1859, he decided to leave active politics. In 1861 he was named governor of the province of Canada (present Ontario and Quebec). He was noted for the deftness of his efforts to avoid British or Canadian involvement in the American Civil War (1861-65) and for his role in preparing for Canadian federation. Queen Victoria elevated him to the peerage of the United Kingdom (as 1st Baron Monck) in 1866 and extended his term so that he might be the first governor-general of the new Dominion of Canada, created in 1867.

April 19, 2021, Minneapolis, Minn.), vice president of the United States (1977-81). In 1947 he organized student volunteers who assisted Hubert Humphrey, Orville Freeman, and Karl Rolvaag in excluding leftists from the newly created Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in Minnesota. In 1958 Freeman, now the governor, appointed Mondale special assistant to the state attorney general and two years later named him to fill the unexpired term of the attorney general. When Humphrey resigned from his Senate seat after being elected vice president in 1964, Mondale again was the beneficiary of an unexpired term, this time in the U.S. Senate. He won election to the Senate seat in 1966 and reelection in 1972. He sought the 1974 Democratic presidential nomination but dropped out of the race, acknowledging that he did not have a taste for the kind of nonstop campaigning necessary to capture the presidency. In 1976 he aggressively sought the second spot on the ticket with Jimmy Carter. The Carter-Mondale ticket was defeated in its attempt at reelection in 1980, and Mondale immediately began his quest for the 1984 presidential nomination. A lifelong crusader for equal opportunity, he selected Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate. However, except for a brief period after the first TV debate, during which Pres. Ronald Reagan appeared tired and confused, polls showed the Mondale-Ferraro ticket slipping further and further behind. He won only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia, for a total of 13 electoral votes. In 1993-96 he was ambassador to Japan. When Paul Wellstone, the Democratic senator from Minnesota, was killed in a plane crash while campaigning to retain his seat in 2002, Mondale took his place on the ballot but was defeated by Republican Norm Coleman.\n\nMondelli, Emilio (b.

Feb. 3, 1969, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), Mozambican nationalist leader. Educated in South Africa, Portugal, and the United States, he only returned for a longer stay to Mozambique in 1961, at which time he was still pro-Portugal. The underdevelopment of Mozambique made him commit to independence, but he still hoped to achieve it in friendly cooperation with Portugal. In 1962 the Mozambique African National Union and the National Democratic Union of Mozambique merged as the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo), of which he became president, based in Tanganyika (later Tanzania). But new breakaway organizations emerged and he was attacked as being pro-Western. He accepted Chinese aid and was pushed to start a guerrilla war in 1964. Although in 1968 the second Frelimo congress was held inside Mozambique, the war had not been very successful, as the Portuguese exploited ethnic rivalries and managed to contain Frelimo territorial control to economically unimportant northern areas. In 1969 he was killed by a parcel bomb; the responsibility for this assassination has never been clearly established. After independence was achieved in 1975, the country's premier university was named after him.\n\nMoney, Sir Arthur Wigram (b. Oct. 23, 1866 - d.
