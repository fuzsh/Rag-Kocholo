        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nFC Barcelona Camp Nou\n\nIf you are a soccer (football) fan, does it get any better than a visit to FC Barcelona Camp Nou? A few years back I spent the day in one of the most iconic soccer stadiums in the world. If you are a futbol/football/soccer fan you know all about legendary FC Barcelona. Home of Messi and his Golden Boots and two time Golden Ball awards for the best player in the World Cup. This football club is legendary and has won… a lot. I have to admit a visit to Camp Nou was great but the highlight for me was seeing the UEFA Champions League Cup.\n\nFor you sports fans, there is no greater afternoon spent than visiting Camp Nou – home of FC Barcelona. Many famous matches have been played in this stadium but it is also the home to a small sports museum featuring both the Barça football club and other sports clubs that call this stadium home.\n\nThis football club was established in 1899 and has call Camp Nou home since 1957. The stadium holds just under 100,000 fans. With such a huge fanbase it’s still important to have seating for visiting fans. There are designated seat visiting foes of FC Barcelona. Missed a match? You can go to the website and see all the 90-minute matches of the season.\n\nBarça Stadium Tour & Museum\n\nStarting at 26€ Euros, this is tour is pricey but if you are a true fan, you won’t mind the price to see this state-of-the-art stadium. If you want to make it really fun, you can see the league trophies, watch fans sing the club song, take a closer look at the Golden Ball and Golden Boot trophies.\n\nThe visit to the museum is more than just a visit: you’ll be able to access special content using the multimedia audio guide. The Camp Nou tour is not any old tour. With the new Virtual Experience using VR goggles you sit right in the stands so that you can re-live the most exciting goals and moments as if you were really there!\n\nDuring special tours, you can visit the team locker room (the Barça locker room is off-limits) and also take photos with the UEFA Champions League Cup. I’m not going to lie, this was a highlight for me as I’ve watched many Champions League games with my family.\n\nThe museum is also worth the tour as you will be able to see trophies from the different leagues that call Barça Stadium home. It is not just a soccer/football stadium but home to basketball, handball, futsal (indoor soccer with fewer players) and roller hockey teams.\n\nChampionship Record\n\nChampions League – 5 – 1991-92, 2005-06, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2014-15\n\nFIFA Club World Cup – 3 – 2009-10, 2011-12, 2015-16\n\nEuropean Cup Winners’ Cup – 4 – 1978-79, 1981-82, 1988-89, 1996-97\n\nSpanish League Championship – 26 – 1928-29, 1944-45, 1947-48, 1948-49, 1951-52, 1952-53, 1958-59, 1959-60, 1973-74, 1984-85, 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1997-98, 1998-99, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2017-18, 2018-19\n\nCopa del Rey – 30 – 1909-10, 1911-12, 1912-13, 1919-20, 1921-22, 1924-25, 1925-26, 1927-28, 1941-42, 1950-51, 1951-52, 1952-53, 1956-57, 1958-59, 1962-63, 1967-68, 1970-71, 1977-78, 1980-81, 1982-83, 1987-88, 1989-90, 1996-97, 1997-98, 2008-09, 2011-12, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18\n\nWith a huge shop, there are penty of souvenirs that you can bring home. I received a genuine FC Barcelona scarf (which I proceeded to give to my hubby). I bought myself a nylon backpack that I travel with to this day. Want your very own Leo Messi jersey? There is no shortage of colours or sizes from toddler to adult."
