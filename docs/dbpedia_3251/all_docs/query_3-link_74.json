The 2011 edition commemorated the 150th anniversary of Italian unification. The majority of the race was situated entirely within Italy - only the end of stage 13 and beginning of stage 14, in Austria, featured roads outside the home nation. Alberto Contador entered the second half of the Giro holding the race lead, and never relinquished it. Instead, he continually added to his advantage. After no stage was second place closer to him than it had been the day before. The largest chunk of time taken in one day came in stage 13, the first of three high-mountain stages that preceded the Giro's second rest day. Contador and José Rujano finished over a minute and a half ahead of the rest of the field. Contador essentially gifted the stage win to Rujano, something he also did later in the race with his former teammate Paolo Tiralongo, since the three-minute overall advantage it gave him was already close to the largest he had ever had in a Grand Tour. He did take one stage win for himself in the second half of the Giro, the uphill individual time trial to the Nevegal. Two stages in the second half of the Giro had their courses altered shortly before they were run. Stage 14 had been hyped as the debut of the Monte Crostis in the Giro d'Italia, but commissaires from the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) mandated it be removed the night before Stage 14 was run.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophées_UNFP_du_football\n\nTrophées UNFP du football\n\n[ \"Position\", \"Player\", \"Club\" ]\n\n[ [ \"GK\", \"Vincent Demarconnay\", \"Paris FC\" ], [ \"RB\", \"Fabien Centonze\", \"Lens\" ], [ \"CB\", \"Stoppila Sunzu\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"CB\", \"John Boye\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"LB\", \"Thomas Delaine\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"CM\", \"Farid Boulaya\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"CM\", \"Renaud Cohade\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"CM\", \"Alexis Claude-Maurice\", \"Lorient\" ], [ \"FW\", \"Opa Nguette\", \"Metz\" ], [ \"FW\", \"Gaëtan Charbonnier\", \"Brest\" ], [ \"FW\", \"Habib Diallo\", \"Metz\" ] ]\n\nTrophées_UNFP_du_football_42\n\nThe Trophées UNFP du football are a number of awards given annually by the National Union of Professional Football Players to players playing in France's Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, as well as to managers and referees, the most prestigious one being the Player of the Year.

Filming for the series was interrupted by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike in November 2007, after production on the two-episode tornado storyline wrapped. The first part, Something's Coming, aired on December 2, 2007. Welcome to Kanagawa, the second part and the last episode filmed before the strike, was originally going to be aired after the strike's resolution, but aired on January 6, 2008. Seven additional episodes were produced for the fourth season after the strike, the first of which aired on April 13, 2008. The final two episodes served as a two-part finale and were aired consecutively on May 18, 2008. A total of 17 episodes aired as part of the season, with one recap special airing on September 23, 2007. The series continues to focus on Wisteria Lane residents Susan Delfino, Lynette Scavo, Bree Hodge, Gabrielle Solis and Edie Britt, with Mary Alice Young returning as the series' narrator. Katherine Mayfair and her family are introduced in this season and are the center of the season's mystery. Critical reception for the season was positive, and ratings increased from the third season.

[ 8 ] [ 12 ] Estradiol benzoate is used in hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty due to hypogonadism or other causes in women . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] It is also used in hormone therapy for transgender women . [ 13 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Aside from hormone therapy , estradiol benzoate is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders , dysfunctional uterine bleeding , and breast engorgement . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] In addition , it is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men . [ 8 ] Estradiol benzoate has a relatively short duration of action , and is administered by intramuscular injection usually two to three times per week . [ 8 ] [ 12 ] It is used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms at a dosage of 1 to 1.66 mg initially and 0.33 to 1 mg for maintenance two times per week , and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty at a dosage of 1.66 mg two to three times per week . [ 8 ] [ 30 ] The dosage used in hormone therapy for transgender women is 0.5 to 1.5 mg two to three times per week . [ 13 ] In the treatment of prostate cancer , estradiol benzoate is used at a dosage of 1.66 mg three times per week ( for a total of 5 mg per week ) . [ 8 ]\n\nEstradiol_benzoate_2\n\nEstradiol benzoate (EB), sold under the brand name Progynon-B among others, is an estrogen medication which is used in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low estrogen levels in women, in hormone therapy for transgender women, and in the treatment of gynecological disorders. It is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol benzoate is used in veterinary medicine as well. When used clinically, the medication is given by injection into muscle usually two to three times per week. Side effects of estradiol benzoate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol benzoate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol benzoate was discovered in 1933 and was introduced for medical use that same year. It was the first estradiol ester to be discovered or marketed, and was one of the first estrogens to be used in medicine. Along with estradiol dipropionate, estradiol benzoate was among the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years following its introduction. However, in the 1950s, longer-acting estradiol esters that necessitated less frequent injections, such as estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate, were developed, and have since largely superseded estradiol benzoate.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Shende\n\nBela Shende\n\n[ \"Year\", \"Film\", \"Song ( s )\", \"Music director ( s )\", \"Language\", \"Co-singer ( s )\" ]\n\n[ [ \"2001\", \"Tera Mera Saath Rahen\", \"Dum dum diga diga\", \"Anand Raj Anand\", \"Hindi\", \"Atul Kale\" ], [ \"2001\", \"Ehsaas : The Feeling\", \"Tumse milkar hua hai Ehsaas\", \"Anand Raj Anand\", \"Hindi\", \"K.K\" ], [ \"2005\", \"Paheli\", \"• Kangna Re • Khali Hai Tere Bina • Minnat Kare\", \"M.M .

He appeared in the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show, recorded a number of hit comic songs and became known internationally through his many film characterisations, among them Chief Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther film series. The filmmakers John and Roy Boulting described him as the greatest comic genius [Britain] has produced since Charles Chaplin. Sellers's career on radio, film, television and record spanned from 1948 until his death. He made his radio debut on ShowTime in 1948, followed by appearances in Ray's a Laugh, Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine to Be Young. Along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, he took part in the radio series The Goon Show (1951-60). Throughout his career, Sellers made a number of television appearances, in character roles and for interviews and advertisements. His stage appearances were few, largely because he had been unhappy with the touring he had done as a child with his family. During his career, he also released a number of albums containing sketches and comic songs; the songs were undertaken in a variety of comic characters. Starting in the 1950s, Sellers appeared in over fifty films, including I'm All Right Jack, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, Being There and the Pink Panther series. At the peak of his career, he was one of the most popular stars at the British box office: third in most popular films in 1962, and second in 1963. Sellers's versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eurodance_songs\n\nList of Eurodance songs\n\n[ \"Year\", \"Artist\", \"Origin\", \"Song\" ]\n\n[ [ \"2010\", \"Hera Björk\", \"Iceland\", \"Je ne sais quoi\" ], [ \"2010\", \"Rihanna\", \"Barbados\", \"Only Girl ( In the World )\" ], [ \"2010\", \"SunStroke Project and Olia Tira\", \"Moldova\", \"Run Away\" ], [ \"2011\", \"Kelly Rowland featuring the WAV.s\", \"United States\", \"Down for Whatever\" ], [ \"2011\", \"Eric Saade\", \"Sweden\", \"Popular\" ], [ \"2011\", \"Alexandra Stan\", \"Romania\", \"Mr. Saxobeat\" ], [ \"2011\", \"Pitbull featuring Marc Anthony\", \"United States , Puerto Rico\", \"Rain Over Me\" ], [ \"2011\", \"The Wanted\", \"United Kingdom and Ireland\", \"Glad You Came\" ], [ \"2012\", \"Loreen\", \"Sweden\", \"Euphoria\" ], [ \"2012\", \"Oceana\", \"Germany\", \"Endless Summer\" ], [ \"2012\", \"R.I.O . featuring Nicco\", \"Germany , United States\", \"Party Shaker\" ], [ \"2012\", \"Tacabro\", \"Italy\", \"Tacata '\" ], [ \"2013\", \"Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris\", \"Canada , United States\", \"All Around the World\" ], [ \"2013\", \"Cascada\", \"Germany\", \"Glorious\" ], [ \"2013\", \"Katy Perry\", \"United States\", \"Walking on Air\" ], [ \"2018\", \"Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa\", \"Scotland and United Kingdom\", \"One Kiss\" ] ]\n\n2010s\n\nList_of_Eurodance_songs_4\n\nThe following is a chronological list of Eurodance songs.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_All_Japan_Pro_Wrestling_personnel\n\nList of All Japan Pro Wrestling personnel\n\n[ \"Ring name\", \"Real name\", \"Notes\" ]\n\n[ [ \"Ayato Yoshida\", \"Unknown\", \"Active Advance Pro Wrestling\" ], [ \"Bodyguard\", \"Noboru Kurakawa\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Dylan James\", \"Dylan James\", \"\" ], [ \"Gianni Valletta\", \"Wayne Pace\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Jake Lee\", \"Lee Che-Gyong\", \"\" ], [ \"Joe Doering\", \"Joseph Doering\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Jun Akiyama\", \"Jun Akiyama\", \"General Manager and representative director\" ], [ \"Kai\", \"Atsushi Sakai\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Kento Miyahara\", \"Kento Miyahara\", \"\" ], [ \"Kuma Arashi\", \"Masaya Suzuki\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Masanobu Fuchi\", \"Masanobu Fuchi\", \"\" ], [ \"Naoya Nomura\", \"Naoya Nomura\", \"\" ], [ \"Osamu Nishimura\", \"Osamu Nishimura\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Ryoji Sai\", \"Ryoji Sai\", \"Pro Wrestling Land 's End\" ], [ \"Shotaro Ashino\", \"Shotaro Ashino\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Shuji Ishikawa\", \"Shuji Ishikawa\", \"World Tag Team Champion\" ], [ \"Suwama\", \"Kohei Suwama\", \"Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion World Tag Team Champion Member of the Board of Directors President of talent relations\" ], [ \"Takao Omori\", \"Takao Omori\", \"Member of the Board of Directors\" ], [ \"Utamaro\", \"Hiroki Murase\", \"Freelancer\" ], [ \"Yoshitatsu\", \"Naofumi Yamamoto\", \"Gaora TV Champion\" ] ]\n\nRoster -- Heavyweight wrestlers\n\nList_of_All_Japan_Pro_Wrestling_personnel_0\n\nThis is a list of professional wrestlers who currently wrestle for All Japan Pro Wrestling, as well as a list of notable alumni.
