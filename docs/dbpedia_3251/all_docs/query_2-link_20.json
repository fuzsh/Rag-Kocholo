        "text": "Click here for the previous part of Moved, Cancelled & Called-Off European Club Games, covering to 1969 to 1985, here for Part 4 of 1991 to 2000, or here for all in the Football Special Report series.\n\n1985-86:\n\nEuropean Super Cup 1985:\n\nSince its inception, starting off as an unofficial contest in 1972 between the winners of the European Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup before the concept was adopted by UEFA the following year, the European Super Cup had mostly been a two-legged home and away affair. This switched to a single game for the 1984 edition, with European Cup winners Juventus hosting Cup Winners’ Cup winners Liverpool in Turin in a preview of the grimly-fated 1985 European Cup final in Heysel. And because the Super Cup didn’t actually take place in the year it was for at the time, the 1984 final was held in February 1985, just over four months ahead of the disaster. The programme-makers for the game were obviously confused by this themselves, as it clearly states “Super Coppa 1985” on the cover. But due to the tragedy in Brussels in May, this would actually turn out to be the only Super Cup held in relation to that year. The 1985 version, which would have pitted Juve against Liverpool’s rivals Everton, was cancelled following the banning of English clubs from continental competition as a result of the deadly crowd trouble, with Everton also feeling the more immediate effect of missing out on their first European Cup campaign as 1984-95 league champions.\n\nEuropean Cup 1985-86:\n\nOne certain type of European ground-moving that we’ve not been mentioning much, due to its routineness, is that of SK Rapid Wien and FK Austria Wien upgrading to the national Praterstadion – soon to be the Ernst-Happel-Stadion – rather than using their own smaller homes. For the 1985-86 European Cup, Austria Wien did start off the campaign at their Franz Horr Stadium, beating Dynamo Berlin there to advance from the first round. But meeting slightly bigger German opposition of the Western variety next in Bayern Munich, Austria would not actually move up to Praterstadion for the 1st-leg on 16 November 1985, but to Rapid’s Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion (where they had also previously taken on Dynamo Berlin and Liverpool in Europe), with a thrilling 3-3 draw on front of 17,000 meaning a 5-7 aggregate elimination.\n\nCup Winners’ Cup 1985-86:\n\nWhile English clubs were excluded from Europe for the first of five seasons following the Heysel disaster, a lesser known banishment at the same time was issued to CSKA Sofia. They had beaten rivals Levski Sofia in the 1985 Bulgarian Cup final to theoretically earn a spot in the Cup Winners’ Cup, but crowd trouble at the final led to a UEFA decision to also bar them from competing continentally for a year.\n\nConversely, a first time continental entrant were Ireland’s Galway United, defeated 1985 FAI Cup finalists to Shamrock Rovers but qualifying due to their opponents also becoming league champions. United’s Terrlyand Park was deemed insufficient for the visit of Lyngby Boldklub in the first round 2nd-leg on 2 October 1985, with the nearby Galway Sportsgrounds chosen instead. The Sportsgrounds were mostly used as the home of Connaught Rugby, while also hosting greyhound racing, but appropriately enough its opening back in 1927 had been marked by a football match (note: this may have been Gaelic football). With the Tribesmen having lost 1-0 in the 1st-leg away, the tie was more or less put beyond doubt as Lyngby went 0-2 up before half-time in Galway, although a final score of 2-3 on the night, watched by 2,932, at least made things look more respectable.\n\nAnother European debutant in Switzerland’s FC Aarau was in a similar situation, although they were the actual Swiss Cup winners rather than runners-up (managed at the time by one Ottmar Hitzfeld). But their Stadion Brügglifeld also did not meet standards, so the first round 2nd-leg game against Red Star Belgrade on 2 October 1985 was played at FC Zürich’s Letzigrund on front of 11,200. Four shared first-half goals to ultimately make it 2-2 in Switzerland put Red Star through 2-4 on aggregate.\n\nOn the same night as both of the above, Celtic took on Atlético de Madrid at Celtic Park. But the crowd trouble you’ll remember from near the end of Part 2 at the 1985 Celtic-Rapid Wien tie, which caused a replayed game at least 300KM away from Glasgow, continued to have consequences. This time, although allowed play at home, only 150 spectators comprised of media and special guests were allowed in, with a 1-2 Atlético win in the strange vacuum securing the tie for the Spaniards 1-3 overall.\n\nUEFA Cup 1985-86:\n\nFollowing their European Cup run in 1984-85, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of the closed Soviet city of Dnipropetrovsk (the future-Dnipro) returned as one of two Ukrainian representatives among the three USSR entrants in the UEFA Cup. As before, their home games would have to be played outside of Dnipropetrovsk due to the secretive nature of the city’s nuclear, arms, and space industries, although ironically this time their first round opponents were “allies” from East Germany in Wismut Aue. Dnipro’s now-second home of Stadion Metalurh, Kryvyi Rih, was once again employed for a 2-1 victory over Aue on 2 October 1985 to progress 5-2; then also in the second round where a 1-0 over PSV Eindhoven in the 2nd-leg on 6 November secured another great result, 3-2 on aggregate; before seeing one last use on 27 November in the third round 1st-leg against Hajduk Split, a 0-1 defeat contributing an ultimate 3-0 victory for the Croats.\n\nTwo more games on the same night as above were also played at the “wrong” stadium. The non-Ukrainian USSR entry in Spartak Moscow continued to travel that well-worn path for northern Soviet clubs when the weather wasn’t good, several thousand kilometres south to Georgia. 48,500 in Tbilisi’s Dinamo Stadium watched as Spartak faltered to a 0-1 defeat to FC Nantes in the third round 1st-leg on 27 November 1985, a 1-1 draw in 2nd-leg later securing progression for the Frenchmen.\n\nThe other club to use a different ground on 27 November 1985 were Borussia Mönchengladbach, who harkened back to their glory days of the 1970s by using Rheinstadion, Düsseldorf, as had been done whenever the business end of continental seasons were commencing. Here, with 65,000 in attendance, progression must have seemed all but secured after a smashing 5-1 thrashing of Real Madrid in the third round 1st-leg. However, in an amazing but very Real recovery, the Spaniards then won the 2nd-leg 4-0 on 11 December, with the last on the 88th minute stealing the tie from the West Germans via away goals.\n\n1986-87:\n\nEuropean Super Cup 1986:\n\nWhen the Super Cup returned after its year absence, it retained the one-legged format for now. But unlike all previous editions, neither side would be playing at their home ground. Perhaps this was due to the European Cup winners being Steaua București and the Cup Winners’ Cup winners being Dynamo Kyiv, with UEFA deciding against one or two communist-hosted games for a final of theirs (to be fair, this had happened previously when Red Star Stadium in Belgrade held the 1973 European Cup final, and Dynamo Kyiv had already won the 1975 Super Cup including a 2nd-leg on front of 105,000 at Kyiv’s Republican Stadium against Bayern Munich). Instead, the monarchical Stade Louis-II in the Principality of Monaco stepped in for the first time, as would later become the yearly tradition form 1998 to 2012, with a 1-0 for Steaua there on 24 February 1987 to add to their enviable trophy cabinet.\n\nEuropean Cup 1986-87:\n\nWhile FC Porto’s Estádio das Antas was being upgraded, the Portuguese giants borrowed the much smaller Estádio dos Acros of Rio Ave FC, about a half an hour down the coast, to take on Maltese champions Rabat Ajax in the first round. 8,000 were in attendance for the 1st-leg there on 17 September 1986 with the 9-0 Porto result meaning a goal-per-fan ratio of more than 1:1000, before only one was scored in the formality of the 2nd-leg to make it 0-10 overall.\n\nFK Austria Wien were drawn against Avenir Beggen of Luxembourg for the first round, with the 1st-leg away attendance of 474 being among the smallest in European Cup/Champions League history (besides “media only” closed-door affairs). Bringing a 0-3 lead home with them, rather than upgrade to Praterstadon or Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion as before, Austria instead downgraded to Stadion Lehen, Slazburg, home of SV Austria Salzburg, for the 2nd-leg on 1 October 1986, with another 3-0 win wrapping things up on front of 3,500. In the second round, Austria were once again drawn against Bayern Munich for the second successive pairing at the same phase. This time, for the 2nd-leg on 5 November 1986, the larger Praterstadion would now be needed, where a 1-1 draw on front of 47,000 sent Bayern through 1-3 on aggregate. But the last move meant that between the Franz Horr, the Gerhard-Hanappi, Stadion Lehen, and the Prater, Austria had played four successive European homes games (over two seasons) at four different grounds (somewhat appropriate for a club named after their nation).\n\nOn 4 March 1987, Beşiktaş and Dynamo Kyiv prepared to take each other on in a quarter-final 1st-leg at the former’s İnönü Stadium in Istanbul. However, due to heavy snow, this was postponed. It would be ten days later on 14 March before the game could be played, but snow still meant that the İnönü was unavailable, with İzmir Atatürk Stadium instead used. Beşiktaş didn’t take too well to their temporary home however, suffering a humiliating 0-5 defeat, before a 2-0 to Dynamo only four days later at the 2nd-leg confirmed the Turks’ exit.\n\nUEFA Cup 1986-87:\n\nGalway United returned to continental competition after their debut the year before, this time qualifying for the UEFA Cup as league runners-up to Shamrock Rovers. The Netherlands’ Groningen were drawn as first round opponents, with a comfortable 5-1 crushing of the Irish by the Dutch at home in the 1st-leg ending things as a contest. The 2nd-leg was still notable though as one of the only times a Gaelic Athletic Association pitch was allowed play host to association football, before the ground-breaking change in the 2000s which would eventually see Ireland internationals played at the GAA’s HQ of Croke Park (having been strictly been prohibited under the GAA’s “Rule 42”, which had banned “foreign sports” from being played in their grounds going back to the Association’s original Irish nationalist/anti-imperialist ethos). Here it was not Croke Park but the slightly less glamorous, and more scenic, surroundings of Páirc an Chathánaigh in the village of Carraroe that was chosen and somehow granted instead of Terryland Park, with 1,580 in attendance for the historic fixture on 1 October 1986 – a 1-3 defeat sending Groningen through 2-8 on aggregate.\n\nDnipro Dnipropetrovsk were also back, but this time would only once need to borrow Kryvyi Rih’s Stadion Metalurh, owing to their closed city status (see above). This was because they were defeated there by Legia Warsaw 0-1 in the first round on 2nd-leg on 1 October 1986, which was the only goal of the tie to send the Poles through.\n\nIn the third round 1st-leg on 26 November 1986, Spartak Moscow took on Swarovski Tirol at the Lokomotiv Stadium in Simferopol, Crimea – another popular destination for northern Soviet clubs when their own grounds were snowed out as happened here. A 1-0 Spartak win on front of 26,200 was somewhat surprisingly overturned with a 2-0 victory for the Austrians back at Tirol on 10 December 1986.\n\n1987-88:\n\nEuropean Cup 1987-88:\n\nWhen Benfica took on FK Partizani Tirana in the first round 1st-leg on 16 September 1987, a 4-0 home win was coupled with four sendings-off for the away side. This aggressive behaviour, as well as that of some Partizani officials, led to UEFA disqualifying the Albanian champions altogether following the game, granting Benfica a 0-3 walkover for the 2nd-leg.\n\nFrom bad players to bad fans, and Real Madrid were the latest club to be punished for previous crowd trouble. This stemmed from hooligan incidents during their 1986-87 European Cup semi-final at home to Bayern Munich, which to begin with caused UEFA to make their next continental home game behind mostly closed-doors. Therefore, for this first round 1st-leg at home to Napoli on 16 September 1987, only 499 were in attendance at the Santiago Bernabéu to watch the 2-0 home win. A 1-1 draw in Naples was enough to send Real through, but the punishment didn’t stop there as they were now were now banned from playing at the Bernabéu at all for the next game versus Porto. 42,000 were in attendance at the borrowed Estadio Luis Casanova of Valencia instead (as the Mestalla was called at the time after Valencia’s president) for the second round 1st-leg on 21 October 1987, where a 2-1 win, followed by the same result in the Spaniards’ favour at the return game, allowed them to progress to the quarters and to a fully attended home stadium again.\n\nCup Winners’ Cup 1987-88:\n\nImpressively progressing past Vitosha Sofia to begin with (the latest name of Levski), first-time Greek Cup winners OFI Crete were drawn against Atalanta for the second round, who themselves had qualified as runners-up in the Coppa Italia to double-winners Napoli. For the home 1st-leg on 21 October 1987, the Crete chairman for some reason decided to move the game off the island and north across the Mediterranean to Toumba Stadium, Thessaloniki. The chairman predicted a strong show of support for Crete on the mainland, in which he was correct with nearly 12,000 showing up for a fine 1-0 win on the night, and the formation of an official OFI-PAOK supporters friendship which lasts to this day. But that still doesn’t really explain why he would have not preferred the huge game at his own clubs’ ground, Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium, which also could have had a seen a higher attendance (although it may have simply not been up to UEFA standards for such a tie). Either way, back at Bergamo for the 2nd-leg on 4 November 1987, Atalanta recorded a 2-0 victory to end the Cretian adventure there.\n\nElsewhere in the second round, Hajduk Split were paired against Marseille, with the events that followed covered on here previously via a Pyro On The Pitch entry. Already veterans of noteworthy European trouble via the “cockerel incident” (see Part 2), Hajduk were all but eliminated going into their home game following a 4-0 defeat in the 1st-leg on 22 October 1987, and within ten minutes of the 2nd-leg kicking-off at their Stadion Poljud on 5 November, the game was halted due to tear gas and flares being thrown from the hardcore home-end, followed by a pitch invasion. After 15 minutes, play was allowed to resume with the Croats going on to win 2-0, which would have eliminated them anyway but the result was later annulled by UEFA due to the trouble with a 0-3 Marseille walkover going down in the history books instead.\n\nWith the vacuum left by English clubs, some more interesting continental runs than usual were made possible for a few years (including several ending as champions). In the 1985-86 European Cup for example, Finland’s FC Kuusysi progressed to the quarter-finals – an incredible achievement for a club representing a nation entered into Pot 4 out of 5 for Euro and World Cup qualifying draws at the time – before elimination at the hands of another beneficiary, the ultimate winners that season Steaua Bucharest. But even before Heysel, a Finnish club in FC Haka had reached the 1983-84 Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-finals, as mentioned in Part 2 due to their home leg having to be played in France. The same achievement would amazingly be repeated again in 1987-88, this time by Rovaniemen Palloseura, RoPS, to make it three different Finnish clubs reaching three continental quarter-finals in the 1980s – a feat not accomplished by a single one in any decade before or since (TPS Turku in the 1987-88 UEFA Cup also defeated Internazionale at San Siro in the second round and were less than a half away from progressing, before ultimately going 0-2 down to lose 1-2 on aggregate).\n\nRoPS received a favourable draw, with Glentoran in the first round – where 0-0 at home and 1-1 at The Oval saw them through on away goals – before Albania’s Vllaznia in the second, who themselves were in rare territory for their country having beaten Malta’s Sliema Wanderers in the initial phase to make it there (although, continuing the theme, fellow Albanians in Flamurtari would make it to the third round of the 1987-88 UEFA Cup, recording an impressive 1-0 win over Barcelona while being eliminated 4-2 on aggregate). Two 1-0s over the two legs for RoPS sent the Finns through to the last eight, where this time heavier-hitters in Olympique de Marseille awaited, fresh from their Split walkover. For the home 1st-leg on 1 March 1988, the same problem which faced Haka again arose, as the long Finnish winter meant essentially no playable pitches in the country. Italy was this time chosen as a suitable replacement, specifically Lecce’s Stadio Via Del Mare. 1,631 were in attendance there for a 0-1 Marseille win thanks to Jean-Pierre Papin, before a 3-0 to the French side on 15 March 1988 back at Stade Vélodrome ended any RoPS hopes of an unprecedented semi-final.\n\nUEFA Cup 1987-88:\n\nSpora Luxembourg, despite a nominal home ground of the national team’s Stade Josy Barthel, played their first round 2nd-leg against Feyenoord at Stade Camille Polfer, both in Luxembourg City. 1,100 were in attendance there on 30 September 1987 as Feyenoord actually fell behind 2-1 on the day at one point, but wound up 2-5 winners, 2-10 on aggregate.\n\nEspañol began a march that would take them all the way to the final with a first round tie against Borussia Mönchengladbach. However, having picked up a 0-1 win away in the 1st-leg on 16 September 1987, the home portion of their campaign was initiated not at their Estadi de Sarrià, but at the base of great rivals Barcelona. Although the reasons for this are unclear, and despite a crowd of only 15,500, Español found themselves perfectly at home at Camp Nou, with a 4-1 victory on 30 September 1987 to take them through 5-1 on aggregate.\n\nWhile the above-referenced Lecce had never reached Europe themselves, their Stadio Via Del Mare would be used by not one but two other clubs for continental competition in 1987-88. For as well as the RoPS game in the Cup Winners’ Cup, a slightly closer outfit in AC Milan also required the facilities in the UEFA. This was a result of an incident also already recorded on here via Football Special Report #17, when the home Milan crowd pelted the pitch with missiles against Belgium’s surprise package Waregem in the third round 2nd-leg of the 1985-86 UEFA Club in which the Belgians were triumphal 2-3 on aggregate. As well as this shock humiliation, Milan were punished with a two-game continental stadium ban and missing out on Europe in 1986-87, the ban came into effect for the following year’s UEFA Cup. Lecce’s stadium was chosen instead for the first round 2nd-leg versus Sporting Gijón on 30 September 1987, with 45,000 in attendance for a 3-0 win to overturn Gijón’s 1-0 from the 1st-leg. On 21 October 1987, Via Del Mare was used once more by Milan for the second round 1st-leg, again drawing Spanish opponents in Español. Oddly, the soon-to-be finalists could only attract a slightly smaller crowd of 37,000 for another disappointing defeat as far as the Rossoneri were concerned, 0-2, before elimination with a scoreless draw at the 2nd-leg in Spain.\n\nThe side that would beat Español in the final were Bayer 04 Leverkusen, who also had played a home game in an earlier round not at home. While Leverkusen’s Ulrich-Haberland-Stadion could only hold 22,000 at the time, as shown later by the attendance for their home leg of the final, the visit of Barcelona for the quarter-finals was evidentially deemed too big an occasion for the relatively smaller ground. Müngersdorfer Stadion, Cologne, was sourced instead, playing host to a 0-0 in the 1st-leg on 2 March 1988 with 40,000 present, before the Brazilian Tita scored the only goal of the tie in the 2nd-leg at Camp Nou on 16 March to send them through. A pairing with fellow Germans Werder Bremen for the semis could only attract 17,000 to the Ulrich-Haberland.\n\n1988-89:\n\nEuropean Cup 1988-89:\n\nOn 9 November 1988, Red Star Belgrade kicked-off a second round 2nd-leg game against AC Milan at their Red Stadium Stadium, aka Marakana. Going 1-0 up on the 50th minute, the Yugoslavs were looking good to progress having drawn the 1st-leg 1-1 at San Siro. However, 7 minutes later, the referee blew his whistle and abandoned the game due to dense fog and low visibility, the scoreline being declared void and the match ordered to be replayed from the start the next day on 10 November at 3PM. The most peculiar thing was that the exact same line-ups as the day before were mandated, but with the exception of Milan’s Pietro Paolo Virdis and Carlo Ancelotti. Virdis had been sent-off in the abandoned affair while Ancelotti had picked-up his second yellow for the competition, meaning they were both technically punished for a game that “never happened”. Nevertheless, the situation benefited the visitors, as in the replay – on front of an extremely impressive crowd for the short notice of 65,500, only slightly down form the 71,212 the day before – they went 0-1 ahead on the day after 35 minutes. Red Star did equalise a few minutes later, but, with the tie at 2-2, Milan ultimately progressed via penalties and no doubt praised the fog that had helped them get there.\n\nElsewhere in the second round, Galatasaray had been taking on Neuchâtel Xamax of Switzerland. A 3-0 home win for the Swiss in the 1st-leg on 26 October 1988 was hampered by pitch invasions and other trouble from those among the sizable away following. Then, at the 2nd-leg on 9 November, a classically intimidating Turkish atmosphere at their Ali Sami Yen Stadium inspired Galatasaray to a 5-0 victory and progression. But on 18 November, Neuchâtel made an objection to the result of the tie based on the aforementioned trouble and intimidation. UEFA initially ordered a replayed 2nd-leg – which raised wide objections from the greater Turkish football community with even Fenerbache unveiling a banner during a league game in support of their rivals in this situation – as a well as Galatasaray having to play their next European home game at least 300KM away from Istanbul, plus a fine of 24 million Turkish Lira. Upon legal objections however, the fine was dropped, the result of the tie allowed to stand and Gala’ progressed, but a new punishment was introduced of having to play their next European game on neutral ground (outside Turkey), with the one after that to be at least 300KM from Istanbul.\n\nConsidering its large ethnic-Turk population, Germany was always going to be a likely destination for the neutral game, a quarter-final 2nd-leg against AS Monaco, and Cologne’s Müngersdorfer Stadion was indeed chosen by Galatasaray. And indeed a huge mostly pro-Turkish crowd of 60,000 were in attendance on 15 March 1989, with a 1-1 draw on the night allowing Gala’ to again progress, 2-1 on aggregate to reach their first ever continental semi-final. With Real Madrid taking on AC Milan in the other semi, a real chance at the final must have seem possible against Steaua Bucharest, albeit themselves 1986 European Champions. But the 1st-leg on 5 April 1989 resulted in a 4-0 rout in favour of the Romanians, and for the 2nd-leg on 19 April, with the potential advantage of the “hellish” Ali Sami Yen out the window, an uninspiring 1-1 draw on front of 35,000 at the replacement İzmir Atatürk Stadium in İzmir was all that could be achieved.\n\nCup Winners’ Cup 1988-89:\n\nIn the lead up to 1990 World Cup, several Italian stadiums required renovations. Among these was Genoa and Sampdoria’s Stadio Luigi Ferraris, with work getting under way in late 1987. Although Sampdoria were able to play their entire 1988-89 domestic campaign there (apart form the Coppa Italia 1989 final 2nd-leg) as the ground was upgraded stand by stand, their Cup Winners’ Cup run for the same period would require a fully functional stadium. Stadio Giovanni Zini in Cremona, 178KM away, would become Samp’s European home for the season instead, the usual home of 2nd-tier (at the time) US Cremonese, as well as for that Coppa Italia final. And like the domestic cup, Sampdoria amazingly marched all the way to the Cup Winners’ Cup final without ever truly playing at home. In Cremona, for all second legs, they beat IFK Norrköping 2-0 on 6 October 1988, 3-2 on aggregate; Carl Zeiss Jena 3-1 on 9 November 1988, 4-2 on aggregate; 0-0 with Steaua Bucharest on 15 March 1989, 1-1 via away goals on aggregate; and 3-0 over Mechelen in the semi-final on 19 April 1989, 4-2 on aggregate. Defeat to Barcelona ultimately awaited in the final, but, having secured a second consecutive Cpppa Italia victory over Napoli, Sampdoria returned to the Cup Winners’ Cup for 1989-90, repeated their march to the final, this time playing at their real home all the way, and beat Anderlecht to pick up their first ever piece of European silverware.\n\nUEFA Cup 1988-89:\n\nAnother ground that needed renovating ahead of Italia 90 was Roma and Lazio’s Stadio Olimpico. Both clubs were forced to relocate for the end of the 1987-88 season and for the entire 1988-89 season to Stadio Flaminio, home at the time to the amateur Atletico Roma FC and built for the 1960 Rome Olympics as primarily a football venue, but perhaps now more famously remembered as the home ground of the Italian national rugby team from 2000 to 2011 before more recently falling into disrepair. Surprisingly though, apart from the first round, Roma were able to do the inverse of Sampdoria by still playing all their continental UEFA Cup matches at the Olimpico. The exception was the first round 1st-leg on 7 September 1988, a 1-2 Roma loss at the Flaminio on front of just over 16,000 at the hands of 1. FC Nürnberg. But the Romans rallied by winning the 2nd-leg on 12 October 1988 after extra-time to proceed.\n\nAlso on 7 September 1988, St. Patrick’s Athletic prepared to welcome Hearts in the former’s first European tie since Bordeaux in the 1967-68 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On that occasion, as you’ll know from Part 1, they had borrowed Bohemians’ Dalymount Park due to the smaller size of Pats’ Richmond Park and its lack of floodlights. But by 1989, Pats had to temporarily abandon Richmond altogether, with renovations needed while the club was in bad financial straits. Harold’s Cross greyhound stadium became their new home until 1993, previously used by Shelbourne in the 1980s, and Pats followed in the Shels’ footsteps again for the Hearts game as their Tolka Park was this time to be used. 8,000 turned up for the big Irish-Scottish clash, with physical confrontations between rival fans outside the ground. A 0-2 Hearts win on the night was mirrored by the same result in the 2nd-leg on 5 October 1988, on front of the same amount of spectators, to send the Saints marching out of the competition.\n\nOn 30 September 1987, Linfield were defeated 2-4 at home by Lillestrøm and eliminated 3-5 on aggregate from the 1987-88 European Cup. But of course, the fact that we’re mentioning this now means there was crowd trouble. Repeated missile throwing from the Windsor Park crowd resulted in UEFA discipline, with Linfield barred from playing at the stadium for their next two European home games. In fact they would have to play across the water, at Wrexham’s Racecourse Ground in Wales. This came into effect for the UEFA Cup campaign of 1988-89 and the first round 2nd-leg on 5 October 1988 against TPS of Finland. On front of 904, a 1-1 was played out which was enough to give the Finns an away goals win after a scoreless first leg.\n\n1989-90:\n\nEuropean Cup 1989-90:\n\nAfter the above, the second Linfield game barred from Windsor Park came with the 1989-90 European Cup and a draw against a side previously known for moving their own continental games, as seen earlier, in Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. By this point, as the Soviet Union began its break-up, Dnipropetrovsk’s closed-city status had elapsed and they were able to play at their Meteor Stadium for continental games. But for the first round 1st-leg on 13 September 1989, it was again the Racecourse Ground of Wrexham that Linfield had to use, with 1,235 in attendance for a 1-2 Ukrainian victory, followed by a 1-0 at the Meteor on 27 November to send Dnipro through (the sole 2nd-leg goal scored by Eduard Son, a player born in the Kazakh SSR of Korean origin).\n\nThe by-now eleven-time Luxembourgian champions Spora Luxembourg (that 11th being their last as having merged into the new Racing FC Union Luxembourg in 2005) were drawn against Real Madrid for the first round, a game deemed too big for Stade Josy Barthel. Heading to the nearby, once-autonomous German region of Saarland, 1. FC Saarbrücken’s Ludwigsparkstadion was chosen, the home to the briefly-existing Saarland national team in the 1950s which had also hosted a continental club game before via the European Cup in 1955, when Saarbrücken as Saarland national representatives took on AC Milan. On 13 September 1989 the stadium made its long awaited European return with 5,900 in attendance for Spora and Real’s 1st-leg, a routine 0-3 win for the Spaniards followed later by a 6-0 completion at the Bernabéu.\n\nAlso in the first round Sparta Prague faced Fenerbahçe, with the 1st-leg at Stadion Letná on 13 September 1989 disrupted by “fan incidents” and the classic 300KM banishment from the ground for their next European game handed out by UEFA afterwards. Winning the away leg as well, 1-2, to progress, the ban came into effect for the second round tie with CSKA Sofia. Štadión Spartaka in Trnava, Slovakia, unsurprisingly of FC Spartak Trnava, was decided upon as the replacement venue, although the land at the time was of course still united with Prague as part of Czechoslovakia. 7,765 attended to watch their fellow Spartans in the 1st-leg on 18 October 1989, a 2-2 draw, before a 3-0 CSKA win back in Sofia ended the Czech club’s participation.\n\nCup Winners’ Cup 1989-90:\n\nA similar situation to the above Sparta Prague game occurred in the Cup Winners’ Cup as well, except that Partizan Belgrade’s 300KM punishment for their tie with Celtic was coming into effect after a 1988-89 UEFA Cup second round clash with AS Roma. In that encounter, the 1st-leg at Stadion JNA was briefly interrupted after home fans set fire to a high-jump mat, and later missiles pelted the pitch following a Roma goal including captain Giuseppe Giannini being hit in the head with a coin. Like Sparta, they were able to relocate to a stadium still technically within the same federal country of SFR Yugoslavia, but again one that wouldn’t be for long as Stadion pod Bijelim Brijegom, Mostar, in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was chosen, home ground FK Velež Mostar at the time (now of the Croat-identifying HŠK Zrinjski Mostar since 1992). 8,176 were there for the 1st-leg on 12 September 1989 and a 2-1 Partizan win, which would be followed by a thrilling 5-4 game at Celtic Park on 27 September with the Serbs going through on away goals.\n\nIn an Austro-Hungarian second round derby, Admira Wacker faced Ferencváros and beat them 1-0 with a very late goal at their Bundesstadion Südstadt for the 1st-leg on 18 October 1989. Rioting by some away supporters followed afterwards in the city of Maria Enzersdorf, where Admira are based, which resulted in a Ferencváros stadium ban for the next game. But not the old 300KM (possibly because the incidents didn’t actually occur in their own ground of Üllői úti Stadion ) as Szeged, where the 2nd-leg was to be played, is only 175KM from Budapest. 17,000 packed into Tisza Volán SC’s Felső Tisza-parti Stadion for the match on 1 November 1989, but another 0-1 for Admira would win it for the Austrians.\n\nPartizan Belgrade, meanwhile, had continued by eliminating Groningen 6-5 on aggregate in the second round. But once again, there had been crowd trouble at at their Stadion JNA for the 2nd-leg on 1 November 1989. Yet another 300KM stadium ban was imposed for the next round, meaning an unprecedented double in the same tournament of being punished as such for separate incidents. In the quarter-finals Partizan took on Dinamo București, going down 2-1 in the 1st-leg away on 7 March 1990. Rather than Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 2nd-leg this time would take place in Montenegro and its Stadion pod Goricom in Titograd, the capital city named so from 1946 after the former Yugoslav-dictator Tito, to 1992 when it would change back to its “true form” of Podgorica. Stadion pod Goricom was home to both FK Budućnost Podgorica (which it currently still is) and to OFK Titograd, who interestingly also renamed themselves to the original FK Mladost (“Youth”) in 1992, only to revert back to OFK Titograd in 2018 out of respect for the old club traditions. On 21 March 1990 though, Dinamo would arrive there for the 2nd-leg and on front of 9,000 pick up a comfortable 0-2 win to progress 1-4 on aggregate.\n\nUEFA Cup 1989-90:\n\nIn a first round 2nd-leg on 26 September 1989, an infamous incident – the “Staafincident” – occurred at Stadion De Meer in Amsterdam where AFC Ajax were taking on Austria Wien. With the score level on aggregate at 1-1, the game went to extra-time. But in the 104th minute, an iron rod was thrown from the hardcore home fans behind the goal, striking the head of Austria goalkeeper Franz Wohlfahrt. Swiss ref Bruno Galler abandoned the game, with Austria granted a 0-3 walkover on the night, while Ajax were barred from European football for a year plus a 200KM ban from playing in Amsterdam for their next three home European games after.\n\nOn the same night as the iron rod incident, a game over in Italy was being played at an alternative venue for less sinister reasons. Fiorentina’s Stadio Artemio Franchi, aka the Comunale, was another World Cup 90 venue in the process of renovation and the Viola started the 1989-90 season by using fifth-tier U.S. Pistoiese’s Stadio Marcello Melani. By October they were able to return to their own ground, which was still a work in progress, but for continental games which required a fully functional stadium, plus some other domestic fixtures later in the season, Perugia’s Stadio Renato Curi was to be their home. In a scenario remarkably similar to Sampdoria’s 1988-89 Cup Winners’ Cup campaign, Fiorentina would make it all the way to the UEFA Cup final while using Renato Curi, taking on Atletico Madrid in the first round 2nd-leg there on 27 September 1989 and winning 3-1 on penalties; drawing 0-0 with FC Sochaux in the second round 1st-leg on 18 October 1989, progressing on away goals after a 1-1 in France; defeating Dinamo Kyiv 1-0 in the third round 1st-leg on 22 November 1989 with the only goal of the tie; another 1-0 victory over AJ Auxerre in the quarter-final 1st-leg on 7 March 1990, repeating the score-line in the 2nd-leg; and finally a 0-0 with Werder Bremen on 17 April 1990, allowing Fiorentina to progress 1-1 on away goals to the two-legged final.\n\nThe UEFA Cup final would be an all-Italian affair for the first time in history, as awaiting Fiorentina was Juventus. With Juve at home for the 1st-leg on 2 May 1990 and victorious 3-1, Fiorentina switched to Avellino’s Stadio Partenio rather than Perugia for the 2nd-leg on 16 May. This was presumably for the higher attendance, as 40,000 were in the ground for a 0-0 draw to give the Old Lady another Cup. To add insult to injury, the next day it was announced by the Fiorentina chairman that Roberto Baggio was leaving the club to join the very team that had just beaten them. Riots erupted in Florence for several days as a result, including attacks on the club owner’s home, and would later continue during the World Cup with more rioting at the nearby base of the Italian national team at Coverciano, until the Italian Football Federation moved the squad to the city of Marino near Rome for better safety.\n\n1990-91:\n\nEuropean Cup 1990-91:\n\nAC Milan received a bye through the first round due to the absence of Dutch champions AFC Ajax, who were serving their European ban for the “Staafincident” in the 1989-90 UEFA Cup as discussed above.\n\nThe inevitable first ever clash of Porto vs Porta’ – that is FC Porto and Portadown – was drawn for the first round, with the 1st-leg in Portugal on 19 September 1990. But the Northern Irish outfit were denied the luxury of playing at Porto’s Estádio das Antas, as Estádio do Bonfim of Vitória de Setúbal was instead chosen to host the “minnows”. And accordingly, with the stadium’s greatest ever attendance having been 40,000 for a 1971 Vitória UEFA Cup game game against Spartak Moscow, only 3,000 spectators would show up. A Portadown own-goal after only 6 minutes indicated the way the tie was going to go, with a 5-0 result on the night followed by a 1-8 drubbing at Shamrock Park for the 2nd-leg on 3 October 1990.\n\nAlso on 3 October 1990, another Irish side in St. Patrick’s Athletic were in action as they took on Dinamo București in their first round 2nd-leg, losing 1-4 on aggregate in the end but picking up respectable 1-1 draw on the night . Like their 1988 UEFA Cup game against Hearts, this would be played at Shelbourne’s Tolka Park while Pats still used the dilapidated Harold’s Cross as a temporary home. However, with the tie effectively already over from the away leg, only 1,200 attended, compared to the 8,000 for Hearts.\n\n20 March 1991 would prove to be a cursed night for UEFA, as not one but two European Cup quarter-final 2nd-legs were forced to be abandoned. The first involved Dynamo Dresden, who were making sure that East Germany were technically still represented nearly six months after the dissolution of the state (as even though they were now playing under the re-united German flag, their records for this season still stood as East German as they competed in the first and last NOFV-Oberliga, previously the DDR Oberliga), taking on Red Star Belgrade at home in their Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion. 0-3 down from the 1st-leg, and falling behind 1-2 on the night, the Dresden fans knew that elimination was inevitable and crowd trouble began. With projectiles raining down on the pitch – coming especially close to hitting Red Star’s Robert Prosinečki as he went to take a corner, as well as a linesman – and following several unsuccessful appeals for calm, the referee abandoned the match on the 78th minute. A 0-3 walkover was warded to Red Star, while Dresden were banned from competing in Europe for a year.\n\nThe second “cursed” game that night, meanwhile, was going down in the south of France where Olympique de Marseille took on AC Milan. With the home side leading 2-1 on aggregate in injury time, two of the four stadium floodlights at Stade Vélodrome suddenly failed and, despite having only seconds being left to play, the referee had no choice but to take the players off the pitch due to the low visibility. A break of 15 minuets elapsed before the power could be restored, but at that point, Milan director Adriano Galliani refused to allow his players back out to finish the game, presumably banking on a replayed match to escape what looked like inevitable defeat. However, this just resulted in the game being abandoned permanently, with a 3-0 walkover for Marseille, and severe consequences for Milan with a one year ban from Europe and a two year suspension from all club functions for Galliani.\n\nCup Winners’ Cup 1990-91:\n\nBefore hosting the St. Patrick’s Athletic – Dinamo București game in the European Cup, Shelbourne’s Tolka Park had already seen continental action in 1990 via Bray Wanderers in the Cup Winners’ Cup. Winning their first ever FAI Cup that year, the Seagull’s Carlisle Ground was insufficient for their accompanying first ever continental outing, drawn against Trabzonspor for a sole qualifying round tie before the rest of the teams joined for the first round. 5,000 were in Tolka for the 1st-leg on 19 August 1990, where the Turks opened the scoring after only 2 minutes but were pegged back to 1-1 on 51 minutes, which it remained until the end to record a very fine result for the Irish part-timers. The 2nd-leg on 4 November 1990 would be by no means a disgrace either, with Bray eventually going down to two second-half goals.\n\nThe first round tie between Estrela da Amadora and Neuchâtel Xamax had its order of legs reversed from the draw, so that the 1st-leg on 19 September 1990 took place in Portugal rather than Switzerland as originally intended, and vice-versa for the 2nd-leg on 3 October when Estrela went through on penalties.\n\nFC Swift Hesperange, Luxembourgian Cup winners for the first time in 1990, were drawn against Legia Warsaw in the first round for their continental debut. Following a 3-0 defeat in the 1st-leg on 19 September 1990, Stade de la Frontière in Esch-sur-Alzette, home of Jeunesse Esch, rather than Swift’s own Jeunesse Esch, was used for the 2nd-leg on 3 October, where another 0-3 Legia win sent the Poles through on front of just 518 spectators.\n\nWith East German double-winners Dynamo Dresden’s victory in the last independent DDR Oberliga championship, allowing them entry to the European Cup, the passage of one of the most unexpected clubs to reach continental competition was also created for their defeated opponents in the final of the 1990 FDGB-Pokal, who inherited the Cup Winners’ Cup berth. This was second-tier SG Dynamo Schwerin, with the Dynamo name of course implying another club associated with the East German Volkspolizei and Stazi, the police force and secret police respectively. But amid the Peaceful Revolution and the East’s imminent reunification with the West German Federal Republic, Dynamo Schwerin changed their name to Polizei SV Schwerin, or PSV, on 17 April 1990, a couple of months before the final (to make it two PSVs in this Cup Winners’ Cup, along with the more famous one of the Eindhoven variety). Rather than their smaller, ill-equipped Sportpark Lankow, Hansa Rostock’s Ostseestadion about an hour away was employed for PSV’s Cup Winners’ Cup first round 1st-leg against Austria Wien, with another paltry 835 showing up for a 0-2 defeat on 19 September 1990. A 0-0 on front of a not-much-better 1,150 at the 2nd-leg on 3 October 1990 ended Schwerin’s European history there, and on 1 July of that year the brief history of the East German PSV in general would also conclude as they were renamed again to 1. FSV Schwerin. This version of the club later merged with several other bodies to eventually form the current FC Meckenburg Schwerin, while a separate, new SG Dynamo Schwerin, with no legal link to the old Dynamo but aiming to uphold the traditions, was also created in 2003.\n\nUEFA Cup 1990-91:\n\nOn 11 March 1990, the Lithuanian SSR declared itself independent from the Soviet Union to become the Republic of Lithuania. Accordingly, a new Lithuanian Top League was formed from the previous Lithuanian SSR amateur divisions, kicking off on 7 April 1990, while concurrently a “Baltic League” was also organised including the Lithuanian teams who had been in the Soviet Top League, as well as clubs from neighbouring Estonia and Latvia who were hot on the Lithuanian’s heels in terms of independence. Both leagues acted as a first stage for the 1990 Lithuanian championship, with the best sides in the country from each progressing to a final playoffs.\n\nDespite not proclaiming sovereignty until May 1990, and not declaring independence until April 1991, Georgia’s new league system was established even earlier than Lithuania’s, with the top flight Umaglesi Liga starting on 30 March 1990. This would be won by Dinamo Tbilisi, renamed for a short period in the fervour of independence as Iberia Tbilisi, while FK Žalgiris Vilnius (who played one game in the 1990 Soviet season before withdrawing) were to become the first Lithuanian champions of the modern age, both of whom having competed in the Soviet Top League the season before which had decided the USSR’s European places for 1990-91. But with the break-aways, the Soviets protested to UEFA and sanctions were handed out against both the Lithuanian and Georgian FAs. Although Tbilisi finished mid-table in 1989, and were therefor not directly effected, Žalgiris had qualified for a UEFA Cup spot in coming 4th which was then revoked off the back of the sanctions.\n\nSo to round off all of the above, on 19 September 1990 it would be Chornomorets Odesa, the 5th placed team from the 1989 Soviet Top League, taking on Rosenberg in a first round 1st-leg, rather than the rightful Žalgiris. Chornomorets won 3-1 on the night, followed by 2-1 loss in Norway but progressing on away goals, before elimination at the hands of AS Monaco, 1-0 on aggregate with the only goal of the tie (scored by one George Weah) coming in the 2nd-leg away on 7 November 1990.\n\nInternazionale kicked-off the home-portion of a march to what would ultimately be an all-Italian final against Roma, not at San Siro, but by borrowing Hellas Verona’s Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi for a 3-1 after-extra-time win over Rapid Wien in a first round 2nd-leg on 3 October 1990 to send them through. The reason for this change is unclear (San Siro having been renovated around the time too, but obviously completed before World Cup 90), with Inter back at their regular home for the next round against Aston Villa so as not needing to repeat the feats of Sampdoria and Fiorentina.\n\nIn another first round 2nd-leg involving an “Inter” side on 3 October 1990, Inter Bratislava of Czechoslovakia took on Avenir Beggen of Luxembourg. But rather than their Štadión Pasienky, it was Štadión Petržalka of FC Hydronika Petržalka (currently FC Petržalka, among 18 names for the club throughout its history) serving as host venue, where a surprise 2-1 lead for Avenir from the first game was overturned by a 5-0 Inter win with 1,089 in attendance. In the second round, 1. FC Köln were drawn as the Slovaks’ opponents and this time it would be Inter recording a fine away win in the 1st-leg, 0-1 on 24 October 1990. The 2nd-leg on 6 November 1990 was again held at Štadión Petržalka, with a 0-2 Köln victory now on front of a greatly improved 9,906 ending Inter’s participation there.\n\n*****"
