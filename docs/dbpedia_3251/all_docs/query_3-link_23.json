        "text": "Valparaiso (19-15, 9-9 MVC)\n\nvs. Bradley (22-11, 11-7 MVC)\n\nGame No. 35 – Sunday, March 7 – 1 p.m. CT\n\nEnterprise Center (16,502) – St. Louis, Mo.\n\nNext Up in Valpo Basketball: The Valparaiso University men’s basketball team will play for the Missouri Valley Conference title and the automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament that goes along with it on Sunday afternoon at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis. Seventh-seeded Valpo’s unlikely run to the championship game has featured victories over Evansville, Loyola and Missouri State. Now, one win separates the program from its 15th NCAA Tournament appearance. In order to punch a ticket to the Big Dance, Valpo will have to knock off defending Arch Madness champion Bradley on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLast Time Out: Valpo led by as many as 14 and held on to defeat Missouri State 89-82 on Saturday night at the Enterprise Center. After being limited to 7.0 points per game over Valpo’s first two MVC Tournament victories, star sophomore Javon Freeman-Liberty returned to form with a 29-point output in the semifinal triumph. Freeman-Liberty, who finished third in the MVC Larry Bird Player of the Year voting, was a rebound shy of a double-double and also accumulated five assists and three steals. Senior John Kiser continued his breakthrough MVC Tournament as the former walk-on racked up a career-high 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting. Freshman Ben Krikke poured in 11 points off the bench while fellow rookie Donovan Clay stuffed the stat sheet with 10 points, seven rebounds and six assists.\n\nFollowing Valpo Basketball: Television – CBS – Kevin Harlan (play-by-play), Dan Bonner (analyst) and John Schriffen (sideline)\n\nRadio – WVUR (95.1 FM, Valparaiso) – Todd Ickow (play-by-play) and Paul Oren (analyst); KFNS (590 AM St. Louis) – Brendan Wiese (play-by-play), Kevin Lehman (analyst) and Rich Zvosec (analyst)\n\nTwitter updates - @ValpoBasketball\n\nLinks for the video, audio and live stats will be available at ValpoAthletics.com.\n\nBack in the Final\n\nValpo is making its 14th conference championship game appearance in the last 26 years with Valpo owning a 10-3 record in title games during that span. This is Valpo’s first Missouri Valley Conference title game appearance in just its third year in the league.\n\nValpo is making its first title-game appearance in any conference since 2015, a year where Valpo beat Green Bay in a home Horizon League Tournament title game at the Athletics-Recreation Center.\n\nValpo is making its first conference championship game appearance in head coach Matt Lottich’s four-year tenure.\n\nAlthough playing in a league championship is nothing new with the program’s proud past, the route to get there this season strayed from the norm. This marks the first time in program history Valpo has played four conference tournament games in a season.\n\nA Victory on Sunday Would…\n\nClinch Valpo’s first NCAA Tournament berth since 2015 and the 15th NCAA appearance in program history.\n\nMark Valpo’s first MVC Tournament title in only its third season in the conference.\n\nNotch the 11th conference tournament championship in program history and first since beating Green Bay 54-44 on March 10, 2015 at the ARC. Before that, Valpo beat Wright State 62-54 at the ARC in the 2013 Horizon League title game, so a victory would be Valpo’s third straight in conference championship contests. Valpo hasn’t dropped a league title game since falling to Detroit Mercy 70-50 in the 2012 Horizon League final, also hosted in Valpo.\n\nClinch the 21st 20-win season in program history and the second under head coach Matt Lottich.\n\nAn Unlikely Final\n\nAs a No. 7 seed, Valpo is the lowest seed to make the State Farm MVC Tournament championship game. UNI (at No. 6) was the previous low.\n\nThe combined seeds of Valpo and Bradley tied for the high for an MVC title game with Bradley a No. 4 seed and Valpo a No. 7 seed. The record was set last year with Bradley and UNI at No. 5 and No. 6.\n\nIn only its third season in the conference, Valpo is making its first MVC title game appearance.\n\nHead Coach Matt Lottich: Matt Lottich (73-59) is in his seventh season overall at Valpo and fourth as head coach in 2019-20. Lottich led the team to 15 victories in his third season in charge in 2018-19, the program’s second campaign in the Missouri Valley Conference. In his first year as head coach (2016-17), Lottich guided Valpo to its fifth Horizon League regular season championship in a six-year span as he led the team to 24 wins and an at-large berth into the NIT. Lottich, hired as the 22nd head coach of the Valpo men’s basketball program in April 2016, graduated from Stanford University in 2004 and New Trier High School (Illinois) in 2000.\n\nNotes Wrapping the Semifinal: Valpo 89, Missouri State 82\n\nStar sophomore Javon Freeman-Liberty returned to form after averaging just 7.0 points per game over Valpo’s first two MVC Tournament wins. He reached double figures in all 29 regular season games that he played prior to missing the final two games of the regular season while battling mononucleosis. He exploded for 29 points, his third-highest total of the season and highest since a career-high of 32 on Nov. 25 vs. Cincinnati in the U.S. Virgin Islands. He scored 23 of his 29 points after halftime on Saturday night against the Bears.\n\nFreeman-Liberty’s effort was his 30th game this season scoring in double figures, his 14th game with 20+ points and his eighth game with 25+ points. He had a career-high nine made free throws (9-of-12) in Saturday’s game.\n\nJohn Kiser scored a career-high 17 points, an effort that was less than 24 hours removed from the senior matching his previous career best of 14 in the quarterfinal upset of Loyola. Prior to the MVC quarterfinal against Loyola, Kiser had scored in double figures just once in 110 career games. He has now done so in back-to-back contests. He’s averaging 11.7 points per game over the three tournament matchups.\n\nFreshman Donovan Clay scored in double figures for the fifth straight game, matching his longest streak of double-figure performances during his rookie campaign. He is the only Valpo player who has scored in double figures in all three MVC Tournament games.\n\nFreshman Ben Krikke scored seven of his 11 points at the free-throw line. He has nine double-figure outputs during his freshman season including three in the last five games.\n\nRyan Fazekas had a season-high six rebounds.\n\nValpo made nine 3s in the game and has now made a combined 19 3s over the last two games after going 0-for-10 in the first-round matchup with Evansville.\n\nValpo had 31 free throw attempts, its second most in a game this season and most since 35 at Saint Louis on Nov. 9. However, Valpo made just 22, hitting at a 71 percent clip from the charity stripe.\n\nThe top team in the league in assists per game, Valpo continued its success in that department by handing out 20 helpers on 29 made baskets.\n\nIt wasn’t quite as epic as the 18-point comeback to beat Loyola on Friday, but Valpo did trail by as many as nine points with 6:17 left in the first half.\n\nValpo improved to 9-0 this season and 31-2 under Matt Lottich when scoring 80+ points. In addition, Valpo improved to 1-6 this season and 3-22 under Lottich when allowing 80 points or more.\n\nSeries Notes: The hosts have won all nine matchups between these two teams, an impossibility in Sunday’s first neutral-site matchup. The Braves own a slim 5-4 edge in the all-time series. The two teams have split the six matchups over Valpo’s first three seasons in The Valley.\n\nBradley 80, Valpo 69 (Jan. 29): In the first meeting between the two teams, Valpo incurred an 80-69 defeat in Peoria. The defending MVC Tournament champion Braves shot 52.9 percent from the field on their way to improving their home record to 12-1. Valpo fought from 17 down with 12:21 to play to pull to within two with 3:38 to go, but the Braves scored 10 straight points after the final media timeout to up the lead back to 12. Javon Freeman-Liberty led the way with 21 points, Ryan Fazekas nailed four 3s and scored 14 points and Donovan Clay poured in 13 of his 15 points after halftime.\n\nValpo 90, Bradley 78 (Feb. 22): Valpo drained its most 3-pointers in a game since 1989 and set the conference record for the most in a Missouri Valley Conference contest, hitting 18 treys on the way to a 90-78 victory over Bradley in the regular season meeting at the Athletics-Recreation Center in Valparaiso. Valpo trailed by 13 in the first half before roaring back for the victory. Four Valpo players finished in double figures, led by Javon Freeman-Liberty’s 18 points. Ryan Fazekas (17), Mileek McMillan (16) and Eron Gordon (13) all had big scoring nights. Valpo shot 55.6 percent from the field and 64.3 percent from beyond the 3-point arc.\n\nWe Meet Again: Fifth-year Bradley head coach Brian Wardle is no stranger to matching up with Valparaiso in a conference-tournament setting. Valpo’s last two conference championships included wins over Wardle, then the head coach at Green Bay, during the league tournament. Valpo erased a double-figure deficit to beat Wardle’s Phoenix 54-44 in the Horizon League title game on March 10, 2015 at Valpo’s Athletics-Recreation Center, clinching the program’s most recent NCAA Tournament berth. Valpo’s 2013 Horizon League title also went through Wardle, as Valpo topped his team 70-69 in a Horizon League semifinal at the ARC that saw Ryan Broekhoff hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer, the second-most famous shot in Valpo history behind Bryce Drew’s in 1998.\n\nScouting the Braves\n\nEntered Arch Madness as the fourth seed, but entered the semifinal round as the favorites as the top three teams were on the wrong end of quarterfinal upsets.\n\nReached the Arch Madness final by virtue of wins over Southern Illinois and Drake.\n\nDarrell Brown and Elijah Childs were named to the All-MVC Second Team, while Nate Kennell registered Third Team All-MVC honors.\n\nFinished the regular season with a 15-2 home mark and a 4-8 road record.\n\nWon three games all decided by three points or fewer to win Arch Madness last year before dropping an NCAA Tournament matchup with Michigan State 76-65.\n\nA Flair for the Dramatic: Valpo added a new name to its long list of late-game heroes in the program’s storied history during the MVC quarterfinal upset of Loyola. Eron Gordon’s go-ahead layup on an assist from John Kiser with three seconds left in overtime gave Valpo a 74-73 victory over the Ramblers. That marked the second time this season the team hit a game winner in the final five seconds. During the Nov. 5 season opener vs. Toledo, Javon Freeman-Liberty knocked down an off-balance 15-footer from the left elbow with 3.7 seconds left in a 79-77 victory at the Athletics-Recreation Center. There have been 25 instances since the start of the 1992-93 season where Valpo has prevailed on a game-winner in the final five seconds. Although it wasn’t an official game, Daniel Sackey’s overtime buzzer-beater lifted the team past Canadian powerhouse Carleton 83-80 in overtime on its foreign tour in August, a sign of late drama to come for Valpo basketball in 2019-20.\n\nForeign Tour = Postseason?: Prior to this season, the Valpo men’s basketball program went to Canada for a foreign tour. This was the third time the program has taken a preseason foreign tour, and the first two were followed by seasons that culminated with postseason appearances. After visiting Cancun in 2010-11, Valpo won 23 games and made a CIT appearance. The 2015-16 trip to Canada preceded a 30-win season and an appearance in the championship game of the NIT at Madison Square Garden.\n\nMaking History Like I Do\n\nValpo sophomore Javon Freeman-Liberty…\n\nFreeman-Liberty scored his 600th point of the season (currently at 604) on Saturday, joining an elite list of Valpo basketball players with 600-point years – Bruce Lindner (1969-70), Alec Peters (2015-16, 2016-17), Dick Jones (1966-67), Bryce Drew (1996-97, 1997-98) and now Freeman-Liberty.\n\nHas 72 steals this season, shattering the previous single-season program record set by Lubos Barton (63, 2001-02) that had stood for nearly two decades.\n\nHas 132 career steals, 13 away from entering Valpo’s career Top 10.\n\nIs in position to become the first player to lead the MVC in steals in consecutive seasons since Hersey Hawkins of Bradley did so in 1986, 1987 and 1988.\n\nIs up to 604 points for the season, which is the new program record for points in a single season by a sophomore. Alec Peters’ 2014-15 point total of 569 was the previous mark.\n\nHis 604 points rank seventh in program history for points in a single season.\n\nHas 968 career points, putting him 32 points away from becoming the second player in program history to reach 1,000 points by the end of his sophomore season.\n\nHe has also cracked the program’s Top 10 for made field goals in a season. He is currently at 219, which ranks seventh in program history.\n\nNeeds to get to 609 points to move into a tie with John S. Williams (Indiana State, 1983-84) for the 10th-most points by a sophomore in Missouri Valley Conference history, putting him just five points away from cracking that list.\n\nScored in double figures in all 29 regular-season games he played before seeing his streak snapped in the MVC Tournament opener as he finished with eight points against Evansville. He followed that with a season-low six points in the MVC Quarterfinal win over Loyola before the 29-point outburst in the semifinal round.\n\nValpo Single-Season Scoring List\n\nBruce Lindner 1969-70 725\n\nAlec Peters 2015-16 679\n\nAlec Peters 2016-17 666\n\nDick Jones 1966-67 662\n\nBryce Drew 1996-97 617\n\nBryce Drew 1997-98 613\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty 2019-20 604*\n\nTracy Gipson 1992-93 595\n\nDan Oppland 2004-05 577\n\nDan Oppland 2005-06 573\n\nAlec Peters 2014-15 570**\n\n*sophomore scoring record\n\n**previous sophomore scoring record\n\nValpo Single-Season Made Field Goal List\n\nBruce Lindner 1969-70 274\n\nJohn Wolfenberg 1971-72 253\n\nDick Jones 1966-67 248\n\nAnthony Allison 1995-96 240\n\nDan Oppland 2005-06 231\n\nJohn Wolfenberg 1972-73 230\n\nAlec Peters 2015-16 223\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty 2019-20 219\n\nAlec Peters 2016-17 218\n\nTracy Gipson 1992-93 217\n\nValpo in Arch Madness\n\nIn just its third year as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, Valpo is 4-2 all-time in the MVC Tournament with three of those victories coming this season.\n\nThe program was the No. 10 seed in 2018 and dropped an opening-round matchup 83-79 to Missouri State in its first Arch Madness appearance.\n\nValpo progressed to a No. 9 seed in Year 2 in the Valley and earned its first Arch Madness victory, beating Indiana State 77-55 in the opening round. The team fell 67-54 vs. Loyola in the quarterfinal round a year ago.\n\nThis year, Valpo is the No. 7 seed after finishing tied for sixth in the conference standings, its best finish since joining The Valley.\n\nValpo won zero Arch Madness games its first year in the league, one its second year in the league and now three during its third season.\n\nFriday’s Feats\n\nBy upstaging second-seeded Loyola in overtime, Valpo advanced to the semifinals of Arch Madness for the first time since joining the league.\n\nEntering Friday, only one team had advanced to the semifinal round after playing in the opening round of the MVC Tournament since the event went to its current format in 1997. The only time it occurred was Bradley in 1998. On Friday, it happened twice with eighth-seeded Drake knocking off top-seeded UNI in addition to Valpo’s victory over Loyola.\n\nThis was the first time in Arch Madness history the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds both lost in the quarterfinal round. It also snaps a streak of 21 straight years that the No. 7 seed lost in the quarterfinal round.\n\nValpo defeated Loyola for the first time since joining the Valley, snapping a seven-game head-to-head skid to the Ramblers. Loyola won this year’s regular season meetings by a total of five points over two games and the three matchups this season were decided by a grand total of six points. This was Valpo’s first win over Loyola since the final meeting when the two schools shared Horizon League affiliation, an 85-76 Valpo win in Chicago.\n\nInside the Upset: Valpo 74, Loyola 73 (OT)\n\nThe comeback kids made their greatest comeback yet as Valpo erased a double-figure deficit to win for the 15th time in Matt Lottich’s four-year tenure as Valpo head coach and the sixth time this season. Valpo has only been on the other end (losing a 10-point lead in a defeat) once during Lottich’s tenure.\n\nFriday’s 18-point comeback edged a 17-point rally earlier this year at Illinois State as the largest deficit Valpo has erased this season. It marked the team’s largest comeback since Jan. 17, 2012 vs. Detroit Mercy. Valpo also came from 18 down to force overtime at Drake earlier this season, but lost in the extra session.\n\nValpo played in its fourth overtime game of the season and improved to 2-2 in such contests. This was Valpo’s first overtime conference tournament game since March 7, 2016, a 99-92 upset loss vs. Green Bay in a Horizon League semifinal in the season that ended with Valpo playing in the NIT Championship game.\n\nThis was the first time this season Valpo played in a game decided by a single point. Valpo last had a game dictated by the slimmest of margins in a 55-54 OT loss on Jan. 29, 2019 vs. Missouri State.\n\nFour Valpo players finished in double figures, led by Ryan Fazekas with 15 including five 3s. He has knocked down five 3s in three of his last five games. The senior is shooting 63 percent (17-of-27) from 3 during that five-game stretch.\n\nSophomore Daniel Sackey finished with 13 points, reaching double figures for the third time in the last four games after eight straight in single figures. He scored six points total in the six games leading into Feb. 25 at Missouri State, and has averaged 11.0 points per game over four games since.\n\nSackey tied a career high with six rebounds against the Ramblers, his first game with six boards since doing so in back-to-back contests in the U.S. Virgin Islands in November against Grand Canyon and Nevada.\n\nSenior John Kiser did everything in his power to will his team to victory on Friday. He went 5-of-9 shooting on his way to a 12-point, eight-rebound effort. His point total equaled a career high that was set on Jan. 18 of this season vs. Indiana State.\n\nFreshman Donovan Clay threatened a triple-double with 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists while also grabbing a steal and swatting three shots. The seven assists represented a career high, shattering his previous mark of six on Feb. 22 vs. Bradley. The three blocks also equaled a personal watermark (Feb. 15 at Illinois State) and the eight rebounds were one shy of his career best, nine on Jan. 7 vs. Southern Illinois.\n\nAfter scoring in double figures in all 29 regular-season games, Freeman-Liberty was limited to single figures for the second consecutive contest at Arch Madness. The star sophomore missed the final two games of the regular season while battling mononucleosis. He scored six points before fouling out on Friday.\n\nComeback Kids\n\nValpo has a season-long trend of the team erasing deficits. Six times this year including four against Valley teams, Valpo has come from double figures down to win. Most notably, the team erased an 18-point deficit to win Friday’s MVC quarterfinal.\n\nValpo has come back to tie or take the lead after trailing by double figures 11 times this year.\n\nDuring Matt Lottich’s head coaching tenure (only his fourth season), Valpo has trailed by double figures and won on 15 occasions. Valpo has led by double figures and lost just once in that span, this season at UNI.\n\nThe 90-78 victory over Bradley on Feb. 22 marked the sixth time under Lottich and second time this season Valpo has trailed by double figures and gone on to win by double figures. This was the second time in the last three years that Bradley has led by double figures at the ARC and lost the game by double figures. In 2017-18, the Braves led by as many as 10 in an eventual 77-64 Valpo win.\n\nErasing Double-Figure Deficits Under Lottich\n\nYear Opponent Largest Deficit Outcome\n\n2019-20 Loyola 18* W 74-73 (ot)\n\n2019-20 Bradley 13 W 90-78\n\n2019-20 Illinois State 17 W 65-62\n\n2019-20 Indiana State 11 W 86-77\n\n2019-20 SIUE 10 W 89-76\n\n2019-20 Toledo 14 W 79-77\n\n2018-19 Illinois State 12 W 58-56\n\n2018-19 George Washington 10 W 82-79\n\n2018-19 UNLV 11 W 72-64\n\n2017-18 Bradley 10 W 77-64\n\n2017-18 UNCW 10 W 79-70\n\n2016-17 Wright State 10 W 84-74\n\n2016-17 Cleveland State 12 W 78-67\n\n2016-17 BYU 12 W 92-89\n\n2016-17 Trinity Christian 16 W 89-75\n\n*largest comeback since Jan. 17, 2012 vs. Detroit Mercy\n\nWrapping Up Game 1: Valpo 58, Evansville 55 (March 5)\n\nLess than two weeks removed from setting the Missouri Valley Conference record for 3-pointers in a game with 18 on Feb. 22 vs. Bradley, Valpo didn’t hit a trey in the victory. The team snapped a 298-game streak of made 3s, failing to connect from distance for the first time since Nov. 18, 2011. Valpo went 0-for-14 in that game, a 62-59 win over Akron. Valpo went 0-for-10 in Thursday’s contest. Strangely enough, over its last 300 games, Valpo is 2-0 when failing to hit a 3-pointer.\n\nValpo became the first team in the 30-year history of Arch Madness to fail to hit a 3-pointer in a game.\n\nClay led the team with 16 points while sharing the rebounding team lead with Freeman-Liberty with seven apiece. Krikke’s 10 points came on 4-of-5 shooting while squeezing five rebounds.\n\nClay held or shared the team lead in scoring for the third straight game after he did so just twice in the first 29 games of the season.\n\nFreeman-Liberty returned after missing the previous two games with an illness and contributed eight points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals, holding the outright team lead in both assists and steals.\n\nFreeman-Liberty scored in double figures in all 29 regular-season games, but his impressive streak came to an end in Thursday’s tournament opener.\n\nValpo beat Evansville for the third time this season, recording a three-game sweep of a conference foe for the first time since March 7, 2015, a 60-55 Horizon League semifinal win over Cleveland State at the ARC. All three of Valpo’s victories over Evansville came by three points or fewer.\n\nValpo won its first-round MVC Tournament Game for the second consecutive season and extended its season win total to 17. The three-point game was Valpo’s closest Arch Madness contest in the three years in the league, until the next night, when Valpo beat Loyola by one.\n\nThis was Valpo’s eighth game of the year decided by three points or fewer as Valpo bolstered its record to 5-3 in such contests.\n\nValpo improved to just 4-26 under Matt Lottich when scoring fewer than 60 points. Two of the victories have come this season as Valpo beat Southern Illinois 55-38 on Feb. 12.\n\nInside the Honors\n\nValpo received a nice haul of postseason Missouri Valley Conference honors, with Javon Freeman-Liberty earning First Team All-MVC, All-Defensive Team and Most-Improved Team, Donovan Clay nabbing All-Freshman Team recognition, Mileek McMillan receiving Most-Improved Team recognition and John Kiser being named to the All-Bench Team and MVC Scholar-Athlete Second team.\n\nFreeman-Liberty finished second in the MVC Defensive Player of the Year voting and third in the Larry Bird Player of the Year voting. He was one point behind UNI’s Isaiah Brown for Defensive Player of the Year, the first time in the history of the award a single point separated first from second.\n\nThis marks the second straight season Valpo has boasted a member of the All-Freshman Team after Freeman-Liberty earned a spot a year ago. Valpo has had a player on either the All-Newcomer Team or the All-Freshman team in every season since joining The Valley.\n\nValpo has boasted a member of the MVC All-Defensive Team in each season since joining The Valley. Tevonn Walker earned a place on the 2017-18 All-Defensive squad before Freeman-Liberty grabbed a spot a year ago. Freeman-Liberty and UNI’s Isaiah Brown are the only players to earn MVC All-Defensive Team status in each of the last two seasons.\n\nThis marks the sixth consecutive season Valpo has placed a player on the all-defensive squad. Vashil Fernandez (2014-2015, 2015-2016) and Walker (2016-17) earned Horizon League all-defensive recognition over the school’s last three years in the league before Walker and Freeman-Liberty have continued the string of defensive standouts over the first three years in The Valley.\n\nFreeman-Liberty became the first Valpo player since joining The Valley to achieve first-team status. He became just the fifth Valpo player over the last 30 years to earn first-team all-conference as a freshman or sophomore, joining Alec Peters (2014-15), Raitis Grafs (2000-01), Lubos Barton (1998-99) and Bryce Drew (1995-96).\n\nValpo had at least one first-team all-conference performer in each of the program’s last seven seasons in the Horizon League, but Freeman-Liberty’s honor ended a two-year drought that coincided with the move to The Valley.\n\nFreeman-Liberty earned his way on to the MVC Most-Improved team by finishing the regular season second in the league in scoring, seventh in rebounding, sixth in assists and first in steals after not earning first or second team all-conference last season. He upped his scoring average from 11.0 points per game to 19.3 points per game.\n\nMcMillan’s Most-Improved status came after he went from 2.8 points per game to 9.2 points per game while over doubling his rebounding average from 1.5 to 3.2. He finished the regular season third on the team in scoring after finishing ninth on the squad a year ago.\n\nThoughts of Thievery\n\nValpo currently ranks second in the league with 7.8 steals per game, behind Loyola 7.9.\n\nValpo has 265 steals this season, the team’s most in the last seven years. Valpo finished with 272 in 2011-12. This is just the fifth time in the last 30 years Valpo had accrued 250+ steals in a season.\n\nValpo has nine games this season with 10 steals or more and 17 with nine steals or more. By comparison, Valpo had just four games a year ago with nine steals or more and two with double-figure steal totals.\n\nValpo’s steals average of 7.8 per game is up from 6.1 per game last season.\n\nClay Leading the Way\n\nDuring leading scorer Javon Freeman-Liberty’s two-game absence due to mononucleosis over the final week of the regular season, freshman Donovan Clay averaged team bests in both points per game (16.5) and rebounds per game (6.0) over two contests.\n\nClay’s efforts helped him receive Missouri Valley Conference recognition, as he nabbed the league’s final Newcomer of the Week award for the 2019-20 season, which was announced on Sunday evening.\n\nIn the first game of Freeman-Liberty’s absence on Tuesday, Feb. 25 vs. Missouri State, Clay turned in a career-high 22 points to lift Valpo to an 89-74 victory. He led the team in both points and rebounds (seven). The rookie followed that up by sharing the team lead in scoring in the Feb. 29 road loss at Indiana State, turning in 11 points and five boards.\n\nClay joins Eron Gordon as the only two Valpo players to appear in all 31 regular-season games. The Valpo rookie came off the bench in each of his first two collegiate contests on Nov. 5 vs. Toledo and Nov. 9 at Saint Louis, but started 29 consecutive games since to close out the regular season.\n\nClay has been in double figures in 19 of his 34 games, including all three in Arch Madness. He finished in double figures just once over the first seven games of his career, but has done so in 18 of 25 games since.\n\nHis hometown of Alton, Ill. is just over 20 miles from St. Louis.\n\nPrior to Friday’s MVC Quarterfinal vs. Loyola, Clay had led or shared the team lead in scoring in three straight games after doing so twice prior to that in the first 29 games of the year.\n\n3-Point Specialist\n\nValpo senior Ryan Fazekas is shooting 50.6 percent from 3-point range at 45-of-89 this season. He would currently rank tied for fourth in the history of the Missouri Valley Conference for single-season 3-point percentage.\n\nFazekas has reached the minimum of 75 attempts needed to qualify for the Valpo record book for single-season 3-point percentage. The record of 52.1 percent was set by Lance Barker in 1991-92. Mike Jones (1988-89) currently ranks second at 49.2 percent, a spot Fazekas would take over if he remains at his current clip.\n\nFazekas stands at a career 3-point percentage of 46.5 (93-200). He has met the minimum 150 career attempts and is in position to shatter the previous program record for career 3-point percentage set by Samuel Haanpaa (2006-2008) at 44.5 percent.\n\nFazekas suffered a broken wrist in the second game of the season on Nov. 9 at Saint Louis and did not return to action until Jan. 23 at Missouri State after being sidelined for 17 games. Fazekas also missed 13 games due to two separate injuries last season, and has missed 30 games while playing in 34 over his two seasons in a Valpo uniform.\n\nWith his 20 points on Feb. 25 vs. Missouri State, Fazekas became just the third Valpo player in the last 17 seasons to score 20 points or more on his senior night, joining good company. Both of the other Valpo players who had a 20-point output on senior night during that time frame went on to play in the NBA, Alec Peters (21, 2017 vs. Milwaukee) and Ryan Broekhoff (23, 2013 vs. Youngstown State).\n\nFazekas scored in double figures in four straight games to close out the regular season and was 16-of-26 (.615) from beyond the 3-point arc during that stretch.\n\nNext Man Up\n\nAfter starting at point guard for his first 23 games of the season and averaging 28.2 minutes per game, sophomore Daniel Sackey accepted a different role for a five-game stretch from Feb. 9 to Feb 22.\n\nDuring that stretch, Sackey took a reserve role in stride, coming off the bench and playing just 12.0 minutes per game.\n\nDue to an injury to Nick Robinson (back) and Javon Freeman-Liberty’s illness that caused him to miss the final two games of the regular season, Sackey’s had his number called as he returned to the starting lineup for the Feb. 25 game against Missouri State.\n\nIn his return to the first five, Sackey had 14 points, the second-highest total of his career. He followed that by sharing the team lead with 11 points in the Feb. 29 regular-season finale at Indiana State. He also handed out a team-high five assists against the Sycamores.\n\nSackey hit double figures in back-to-back games to close out the regular season after eight straight in single figures. He had scored six points total over the previous six games before coming through with 25 points over the final two regular-season contests.\n\nGlue Guy\n\nWhen senior John Kiser suffered an ankle injury on Feb. 12 vs. Southern Illinois, it briefly appeared that the former walk-on turned key player had played his last game in a Valpo uniform.\n\nHowever, Kiser quickly returned to the court after missing just two games, and did so as a starter for the Feb. 22 game vs. Bradley. He’s started five straight and 23 total over his four years while appearing in 111 Valpo games.\n\nKiser is third on the team behind Clay and Freeman-Liberty in season plus/minus.\n\nKiser is the only four-year member of the program and the first four-year player of Matt Lottich’s career as a head coach.\n\nFrom Sophomore Slump to Junior Jump\n\nAfter averaging just 2.8 points per game a year ago, junior Mileek McMillan finished the regular season third on the team in scoring at 9.2 points per contest. He has also over doubled his rebounding average from 1.5 to 3.2.\n\nThe Merrillville, Ind. native played just 8.1 minutes per game and made one start as a sophomore. This year, he’s started all 30 games he played in the regular season and averaged 18.2 minutes per contest.\n\nMcMillan started 18 of his 32 games as a freshman in 2017-18, posting 3.2 rebounds per game.\n\nHe went just 6-of-26 (.231) from beyond the 3-point arc during the nonconference slate this year, but hit at a .423 (30-of-71) clip in Valley action.\n\nMcMillan scored a career-high 20 points on Feb. 19 at Drake, shattering his previous mark of 16 set on Nov. 17 of this season against North Dakota. He tied Eron Gordon (Dec. 18 at High Point) for the most 3-pointers made by a Valpo player in a game this season by draining six in the overtime defeat to the Bulldogs. McMillan became the first Valpo player to convert a half a dozen 3s in a conference game since Ryan Fazekas on Jan. 5, 2019 at Missouri State. McMillan became (at the time) just the fourth Missouri Valley Conference player to hit six or more 3s in a league game this season, joining UNI’s A.J. Green (three times), Illinois State’s Zach Copeland and Bradley’s Nate Kennell. McMillan had previously made no more than four 3s in any of his first 88 career games.\n\nValpo in St. Louis\n\nAlthough Valpo is the new kid on the block when it comes to Arch Madness, the program’s history at the building now known as the Enterprise Center goes beyond the team’s three MVC tournament games over the last two years.\n\nValpo’s Sweet Sixteen game against Rhode Island in 1998 was played at the building, which was then known as the Kiel Center.\n\nValpo also appeared in the 2002 NCAA Tournament in St. Louis, but the first-round date with Kentucky was played at the Edward Jones Dome.\n\nHead coach Matt Lottich played at Stanford from 2000-04 and was part of the Cardinal team that participated in the first and second round of the NCAA Tournament at the Edward Jones Dome in 2002. His squad joined Valpo as two of the eight teams competing in St. Louis in the opening round of the tournament that year. Stanford beat Western Kentucky 84-68 in the first round before falling 86-63 to Kansas. Lottich saw action in both contests.\n\nReaching New Valley Heights\n\nValpo finished with its highest league win total since joining the Missouri Valley Conference after finishing 6-12 in Year 1 and 7-11 in Year 2.\n\nValpo completed the league slate with a Valley mark of .500 or better for the first time and has secured an overall winning record.\n\nThe Feb. 25 win over Missouri State allowed Valpo to knock off the MVC preseason favorite for the first time since joining the league. The Brown & Gold were previously 0-7 against the team projected first in The Valley Preseason Poll.\n\nValpo exceeded expectations this year, tying for sixth in the league standings after being picked ninth in the preseason poll.\n\nIt’s Raining 3s – Last Meeting vs. Bradley\n\nValpo converted 18 3-pointers in a 90-78 win over Bradley on Feb. 22 at the Athletics-Recreation Center, coming one shy of establishing a school record for 3s in a single game while shattering the mark for the most in a Missouri Valley Conference contest.\n\nThe record for 3s by a Valley team in any game is 20, but the previous record in conference play was 17, reached on five occasions.\n\nIt was the most triples Valpo has knocked down in a game since the record-setting night against Butler on Feb. 6, 1989 at the ARC.\n\nValpo’s 64.3 percent clip from 3-point range came against a Bradley team that entered the evening allowing opponents to shoot just 29.7 percent from 3 for the season. The Braves were in position to shatter the school mark for 3-point field goal percentage defense and entered the evening with a single-season 3-point field goal percentage defense that ranked fourth in Missouri Valley Conference history.\n\nThe 18 3s tied for the 24th-most nationally in a single game this season.\n\nSeven of the eight Valpo players who logged at least one minute hit at least one 3-pointer in the game.\n\nThe 18 3s were the most Bradley has permitted in program history.\n\nValpo had just set its previous season high for made 3s in a game with 14 on Feb. 19 at Drake.\n\nValpo’s previous season high for 3-point field goal percentage was 47.1 percent on Nov. 9 at Saint Louis. The 64.3 percent vs. Bradley marked Valpo’s first game above 50 percent from distance since Dec. 8, 2018 at George Washington. Valpo’s last time above 60 percent was 10-of-16 (62.5 percent) on Jan. 20, 2015 at Youngstown State.\n\nThe performance against the Braves was Valpo’s best 3-point shooting percentage since going 12-of-18 (66.6) on Nov. 10, 2013 vs. North Park. It was the best against a Division-I team since Jan. 18, 2007 at Western Illinois, when Valpo went 12-of-16 for 75 percent from 3.\n\nPutting Up Points – Last Meeting vs. Bradley\n\nValpo’s 90-point output on Feb. 22 vs. Bradley marked the team’s highest point total against a Division-I opponent this season, surpassing 89 on Nov. 12 at SIUE.\n\nIn fact, it was Valpo’s highest single-game point total against a D1 team since scoring 94 on Nov. 15, 2017, also at SIUE.\n\nIt was Valpo’s highest point total in an MVC game since joining the conference and highest in any league game since Jan. 22, 2017, 96 in a Horizon League matchup with UIC.\n\nThe 90 points came against a Bradley team that entered the evening ranked 65th nationally in scoring defense at 65.0 points per game and 19th in field-goal percentage defense at 38.8.\n\nNonconference Highlights: Valpo’s nonconference schedule was highlighted by seven opponents that qualified for the postseason last year. Here are a few of the opponents that highlighted the 13-game docket that led into the start of Missouri Valley Conference action.\n\nToledo (Nov. 5) went 25-8 last season including a 13-5 conference mark. The Rockets went to the NIT a year ago and have won back-to-back MAC West Division titles.\n\nSaint Louis (Nov. 9) has made four NCAA Tournament appearances in the last decade and went 23-13 in 2018-19 on its way to the Atlantic 10 Tournament title.\n\nGrand Canyon (Nov. 22) went 20-14 overall and 10-6 in the WAC last season, qualifying for the postseason with a CBI berth. The Lopes have reached the WAC title game and qualified for the postseason in each of their first two years as a Division-I postseason eligible team.\n\nNevada (Nov. 24) went 29-5 and 15-3 in the Mountain West last season on the way to an NCAA Tournament appearance.\n\nCincinnati (Nov. 25) posted a 28-7 (14-4 American) record last season, qualifying for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nCentral Michigan (Dec. 8) enjoyed a 23-12 overall record and 10-8 MAC mark last season, winning two games in the MAC Tournament and qualifying for the CBI. The 23 victories tied the program’s highest total in 16 years.\n\nArkansas (Dec. 21) closed out Valpo’s nonleague schedule in North Little Rock. The Razorbacks, members of the SEC, reached the second round of the NIT last season and finished 18-16 overall. Against one of the top teams nationally in the NET rankings, Valpo led by eight with under eight minutes remaining, but fell 72-68.\n\nWrapping Up Canada\n\nValpo finished its four-game Canadian Foreign Tour from Aug. 10-14 with an unblemished mark after notching wins over McGill (84-78), Concordia (94-90), Carleton (83-80, OT) and the University of Quebec (81-68).\n\nValpo battled from 90-80 down with 4:56 to play to top Concordia 94-90 in Montreal on Aug. 11 thanks to a game-closing 14-0 run.\n\nThe highlight of the tour came on Aug. 13, when Winnipeg native Daniel Sackey drained a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to top Carleton 83-80 in overtime.\n\nValpo stopped Canadian powerhouse Carleton’s 15-game winning streak against NCAA Division-I teams that included triumphs over USF, Ole Miss, Providence, Cincinnati, Vanderbilt and Alabama.\n\nThe Sackey buzzer-beater was No. 9 on SportsCenter’s Top 10 plays that evening.\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty scored a team-high 18.8 points per game during the Canada journey, while Donovan Clay and Mileek McMillan shared the team lead by averaging 5.3 boards apiece. Sackey averaged 15.0 points per game during the trip.\n\nPreseason Picks\n\nJavon Freeman-Liberty and Ryan Fazekas both earned All-MVC Second Team honors.\n\nThey joined Tevonn Walker (2017) as the only Valpo players to be tabbed preseason all-MVC since joining the conference.\n\nThe last time Valpo had multiple players on the preseason all-league first or second teams in the same season was 2016, when Alec Peters and Shane Hammink were first and second team Horizon League preseason picks, respectively.\n\nValpo was picked to finish ninth in the preseason poll, based on a survey of the conference’s head coaches, sports information directors and media. Missouri State was named the preseason favorite.\n\nWrapping Up 2018-2019\n\nValpo moved up two spots in the standings from Year 1 to Year 2 in the Missouri Valley Conference while also earning its first Arch Madness victory by beating Indiana State 77-55 in the opening round of the MVC Tournament.\n\nValpo allowed 66.3 points per game, ranking 48th of 351 nationally in scoring defense.\n\nThe team finished with 15 victories for the second straight season including nonconference triumphs over UNLV and George Washington. Valpo started 4-0 in Missouri Valley Conference play, but finished the year 15-18 overall and 7-11 in league action.\n\nNew Year, New Look\n\nValpo has five returning letter winners after seven letter winners departed following the 2018-19 campaign.\n\nValpo has 40.1 percent of its scoring and 35.7 percent of its rebounding back from last season.\n\nThe five returning letter winners are Valpo’s fewest since the 2013-14 campaign, when Jordan Coleman, LaVonte Dority, Bobby Capobianco and Vashil Fernandez were the only players back from the previous season.\n\nStaff Sidebars\n\nAssociate head coach Luke Gore is in his 18th year on staff and has served under four different head coaches. The Valpo veteran has helped the team to seven postseason berths in the last nine years and was on staff for the three winningest seasons in program history. He oversees the team’s post players.\n\nAssistant coach Rob Holloway is back for his second season after spending the previous two years on staff at Eastern Illinois, his alma mater.\n\nAssistant coach Matt Bowen returned to Valpo’s staff in 2018-19 after previously spending four seasons with the Brown & Gold from 2002-2006. He was the head coach at the University of Minnesota Duluth from 2012-2018.\n\nDirector of Basketball Operations Jason Karys is in his first season in that capacity, but has been around the program in a variety of roles, spending two years as a graduate assistant, one as a walk-on player and three as a manager.\n\nStrength & Conditioning Coach Derek Bol is in his eighth season. He is a 2010 graduate of Iowa State.\n\nGraduate Assistant Peter Funk has taken that role after three years as an undergraduate manager.\n\nAthletic trainer Ken DeAngelis is in his first season full-time at Valpo after previously earning his master’s degree from the University in 2012 while spending two years as a graduate assistant athletic trainer.\n\nTradition of Excellence\n\nValpo has 14 NCAA Tournament appearances and four NIT berths in the program’s proud history, with the team’s postseason success highlighted by a Sweet Sixteen run in 1998.\n\nThe program has produced nine All-Americans, won 18 regular season conference championships and 10 conference tournament crowns.\n\nValpo also boasts eight NBA players, 10 conference players of the year and 20 20-win seasons.\n\nNine of the team’s NCAA appearances have come since 1996.\n\nValpo has qualified for the postseason seven times in the last nine years, but enters 2019-20 seeking its first postseason tournament berth since playing in the NIT to conclude the 2016-17 season.\n\nProducing Pros\n\n- Valpo has developed a myriad of professional basketball players over the last quarter century, most notably a pair of NBA players in the last three years.\n\n- Ryan Broekhoff (class of 2013) signed a contract with the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2018 after spending five seasons playing internationally in Russia and Turkey.\n\n- Broekhoff tallied a season-high 15 points on 6-of-8 shooting from the floor (3-5 3PT) in 22 minutes of action Jan. 5 in a 106-100 loss against Philadelphia. Broekhoff played in 42 games during the 2018-19 season.\n\n- Alec Peters (class of 2017) was the 54th pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns.\n\n- Peters appeared in 20 games for the Suns in 2017-18, highlighted by a 36-point performance in the season finale against Dallas - a new single-game high by a Valpo alum in the NBA.\n\n- Peters won a championship with CSKA Moscow in Russia in 2018-19.
