        "text": "Michael Laudrup (Danish pronunciation: [ˈmiˌkʰɛˀl ˈlɑwˀtʁɔp], born 15 June 1964) is a Danish professional football coach and former player. Renowned for his composure, passing, vision, techncal skills, ball control, and dribbling ability, Laudrup is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] He is the older brother of fellow retired footballer Brian Laudrup.\n\nQuick Facts Personal information, Full name ...\n\nClose\n\nDuring his playing career, Laudrup won league titles with Ajax, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other attacking positions. In a period where Laudrup was recognized as one of the best football players of his generation, he became a key member of Johan Cruyff's \"Dream Team\". At Barcelona, Laudrup claimed nine trophies in total, including four successive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the European Cup in 1992, as he moved to arch-rivals Real Madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth La Liga title in a row.\n\nLaudrup made his debut for the Denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. He starred in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and from November 1994, he captained Denmark for a total of 28 matches,[9] including the victorious 1995 Confederations Cup tournament. He played alongside his brother Brian in the Denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 World Cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.\n\nIn 1999, Laudrup was voted the Best Foreign Player in Spanish Football over the preceding 25-year period[10] and in April 2000 he was knighted, receiving the Order of the Dannebrog. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of Denmark by the Danish Football Union, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.[11] He was officially named the best Danish footballer of all time by the Danish Football Union (DBU) in November 2006.[12] He was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a FIFA awards ceremony in 2004.[13] In April 2013, he was named by Marca readers in the \"Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history\".[14]\n\nOn 16 October 2021, at a show celebrating the National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark's 125th anniversary, 125 candidates for the title of the greatest ever Danish sports star had been reduced to eight, and Laudrup was named the winner.[15]"
