        "text": "Chester FC's Sealand Road ground disappeared just over three decades ago. The ground, where 20,372 once saw the Blues play Chelsea, played host to the club's greatest moment, when the lowly Blues, playing in the Fourth Division, toppled league champions Leeds United, who would go on to finish runners-up in the European Cup that season.\n\nChas Sumner saw his first game in 1967, when Chester FC (the change of name to Chester City did not occur until 1983), were in the Fourth Division, and recalls the team's famous League Cup run in 1974-75 \"I was there for all the games in the League Cup run,\" says Chas, who runs website Chester Football History. The big one was Leeds United, because Leeds were league champions, and Chester won 3-0 – without doubt the best result in the club's history.\n\nIan Seddon, one of the heroes of that night for Chester told the Chester Chronicle in 2017: \"I played against Billy Bremner most of the game in the middle of the park and he was just fantastic. He came off after 60 minutes and we were 2-0 up at the stage.\n\nRead more: Chester residents fear noisy rooftop revellers will put an end to their 'solitude'\n\n\"But he waited in the tunnel until the end of the game to shake our hands, it showed what kind of gentleman he was. He was fantastic.\"\n\nManager Ken Roberts also recalled the night, speaking in 2017: \"We had no fear and the lads were unbelievable. We treated every game down to earth and just got on with it, we just did what we had to do.\n\n\"After the game Billy Bremner and Jimmy Armfield came over to congratulate us. 'We couldn't get near you', Billy said. I could have told him that would happen before the game.\"\n\nBremner himself admitted in the press after the game that it was a case of the best team won on the night, hands down. He said: \"The better team won on the night. They were different class from us.\"\n\nChas Sumner remembers the night: \"It was an amazing experience compared to what we were used to, though the attendances weren't bad for division four. To see a really full ground, especially under the floodlights with them being night matches, it added something that bit special to the occassion.\"\n\nChester would go on to beat Newcastle United, losing out to Aston Villa in the semi-final 5-4, despite a 2-2 draw at Sealand Road.\n\n\"People still have fond memories of the ground, but realistically you have to be over forty to remember going to a game there,\" adds Chas. \"The last game was April 1990.\n\n\"They were essentially evicted from there [Sealand Road] because the ground was sold with vacant possession at the end of the 1989-90 season. The last game was against Rotherham.\"\n\nThe club then played at Macclesfield Town's Moss Rose for two seasons before returning to Chester and the new Deva Stadium.\n\nOne of the ground's most unusual features, the main stand, was built in 1979, replacing the former wooden stand. The stand was set back from the pitch with the seating on the second storey, accessed by staircases extending from the front of the stand.\n\nThe roof of the Sealand Road main stand can still be seen above the heads of away supporters at Port Vale's Vale Park in Stoke, having been salvaged from the ground during Sealand Road's demolition in 1992.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive emails direct to your inbox here\n\nREAD NEXT:"
