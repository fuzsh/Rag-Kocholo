This was the longest period any team had spent since the previous appearance in the tournament.\n\nWinning other trophies\n\nSee also Treble (association football) and List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season.\n\nAlthough not an officially recognised achievement, eight clubs have achieved the distinction of winning the Champions League or European Cup, their domestic championship, and their primary domestic cup competition in the same season, known colloquially as the \"continental treble\":\n\nCeltic in 1967, having won the European Cup, the Scottish First Division, and the Scottish Cup\n\nAjax in 1972 won the European Cup, the Eredivisie, and the KNVB Cup\n\nPSV Eindhoven in 1988 did likewise, having won the European Cup, the Eredivisie, and the KNVB Cup\n\nManchester United in 1999, having won the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League\n\nBarcelona in 2009, which included La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League\n\nInter Milan in 2010, which included Serie A, the Coppa Italia, and the Champions League\n\nBayern Munich in 2013, which included Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal, and the Champions League\n\nBarcelona in 2015 won the treble for the second time, having won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League\n\nBayern Munich in 2020 became the second club to win multiple trebles, having won the Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal, and the Champions League\n\nManchester City in 2023, which included the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League\n\nLiverpool in 1984 won the English First Division and the European Cup. However, this 'treble' included the Football League Cup rather than the FA Cup.\n\nBayern Munich in 2001 won the Bundesliga and the Champions League. However, this 'treble' included the DFB-Ligapokal rather than the DFB-Pokal.\n\nIn addition to this treble, several of these clubs went on to win further cups. However, most of these cups were technically won the following year following the conclusion of regular domestic or international leagues the year before. Also, several domestic cups may not have been extant at the time that equivalent cups were won by clubs of other nations, and in some cases they remain so. Furthermore, there is much variance in the regard with which several cups are taken both over time and between nations. Regardless, the following clubs all won competitions further to the treble mentioned above:\n\nCeltic also won their secondary domestic cup competition, the Scottish League Cup, in the 1966–67 season and it is the only European club historically that was able to achieve four major titles in one season (UEFA Champions League, top national league, the main domestic cup competition, and the second domestic cup championship; This does not include the previous season's competitions, for example; Super Cups), thus making their achievement unique in this respect to every other club. In addition, he also managed to win the Glasgow Cup (an unofficial regional competition) sometimes colloquially referred to as a part of \"the quintuple\".\n\nAjax also won the Intercontinental Cup (the predecessor of the FIFA Club World Cup and the de facto premier global club cup) and the inaugural (and technically unofficial) UEFA Super Cup the following season, forming part of a quintuple of Cup successes;
