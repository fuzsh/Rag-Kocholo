        "text": "CITY 2 GORNIK ZABRZE 1\n\nEuropean Cup Winners Cup Final\n\n29th April 1970\n\nattendance 10,000\n\nscorers\n\nCity Young(12), Lee(43 pen)\n\nGornik Ozlizlo(68)\n\nRef P Schiller\n\nCity Corrigan, Book, Pardoe, Doyle, Booth, Oakes, Heslop, Bell, Lee, Young, Towers – sub Bowyer(17), Dowd(unused), Carrodus(unused), Mann(unused), Summerbee(unused)\n\nGornik Kostka, Latocha, Ozlizlo, Gorgon, Flerenski, Szoltysik, Wilczek, Olek, Banas, Lubanski, Szarinski – used subs Skowronek(75), Deja(85)\n\nFRANNY LEE PUTS CITY AHEAD FROM THE PENALTY SPOT AND BELOW ANSWERS A QUESTION ABOUT IT IN LOOK-IN MAGAZINE\n\nFROM THE PRESS BOX\n\nLIONS OF VIENNA\n\nMagnificent City Prove Themselves Europe’s Kings\n\nManchester City proudly emerged as the new Lions of Vienna last Night when they carried off Europe’s ‘Cup Winners’ Cup at the first attempt in this tournament.\n\nOn a night of torrential rain on which their saturated but still jubilant supporters were the real heroes, City’s supremacy was never in doubt in their 2-1 victory over Polish rivals Gornik Zabrze.\n\n…Although Manchester City’s injury hoodoo struck once more last night when Mike Doyle had to be carried off in the first half with a badly trapped nerve near one of his knees, his side were already on their way to what even then seemed almost inevitable victory as he departed from the scene in great pain.\n\nIt had taken the English side only 12 minutes to shoot their way into a well deserved lead with a goal by Neil Young, the marksman who had put them into this tournament with his F.A. Cup Final goal at Wembley last year.\n\n…And three minutes before the interval England forward Francis Lee added to this lead with a goal from the penalty spot. It was a position that proved unassailable, even though the inferior Poles managed to pull back a goal in the 68th minute.\n\nEven the appalling conditions could not dampen the enthusiasm of the hardy fans at the finish when City’s veteran captain Tony Book held aloft his side’s third major trophy in a year.\n\nAlthough wet to the skin, as I was in a press box as comfortless as a lifeboat on a stormy sea, they did cartwheels on the pitch on which their heroes had performed such wonders.\n\nFrankly the apprehensive Poles with their compliment of seven internationals, were disappointing.\n\nKeeping their pre-match promise, the Maine Road men surged straight on to the attack, and harassed Gornik could only fumble unhappily in their desperate attempts to hold them off.\n\nWhen Young scored his goal it was only the culmination of 12 minutes of absolute domination and his breakthrough was the just reward for intelligent anticipation.\n\nLee playing with all the fire and fervour that will serve England well in Mexico, shook off three defenders out on the left and hammered in a shot of fearsome power. It struck the foot of a post and then cannoned off the legs of goalkeeper Kostka straight to Young, whose flick into goal was the merest of formalities.\n\nIn an ill-natured start Gornik midfield man Olek complained to the Austrian referee that Lee had punched him, but I had seen no such offence. But when after only three minutes play the Pole decided to take the law into his own hands and to bang Lee hard down on the pitch, he was deservedly booked.\n\nMuch later in the game Gornik centre forward Banas was also booked for kicking the ball away as City prepared to take a free-kick.\n\nCharacteristically, Lee soon bounced back into full blooded action when he tested Kostka with a quick rising shot which the keeper parried with a cat-like leap.\n\nThe game was only 16 minutes old when Doyle collided with Florenski and lay in agony for two minutes while play went on around him. Even then the referee was reluctant to allow trainer Dave Ewing to attend to him. When Ewing got his way and carried Doyle off, City played on with only ten men for six minutes before Ian Bowyer came on as substitute.\n\nKostka conceded the penalty when City got their second goal, but there was no other course open to him than to tackle Young in rugby style when he saw the lanky raider bearing down on his goal. Lee drove his penalty shot home via Kostka’s legs.\n\nIn the 68th minute, however, Towers conceded a free-kick to Szoltysik and this player and Lubanski managed to force the ball out to veteran international Oslizlo who had cut in cunningly from the left, he beat Corrigan with a left foot drive in one of Gornik’s rare raids.\n\nRONALD CROWTHER WRITING FOR THE DAILY MAIL 30TH APRIL 1970\n\nCITY LOSE MIKE DOYLE THROUGH INJURY\n\nFrom NEIL YOUNG, CATCH A FALLING STAR by Neil Young with Dante Friend\n\nWe arrived in the stately City of Vienna for the final. A beautiful City and we were all in fabulous spirits as we settled in there. We had opposition to beat but we had no doubts that we could win. We felt relaxed and we enjoyed the cultural tours we went on. My overiding memory is of a very clean place. There was no graffiti, no-one misbehaving. I think standards over there, the way people dressed, the way people spoke, were better than at home.\n\nTo be honest going into that game we did have one worry. That was a world class player called Lubanski, Gornik’s star man. It’s been well documented over the years that the weather that night in the Prater Stadium was horrendous. The stadium held 80,000 however a torrential downpour limited the attendance on the night to 12,100, with just 4,000 traveling fans from Manchester braving the elements. Nevertheless, although our loyal fans were drenched in the stands (there was absolutely no cover to be had anywhere), The Blue Army stood firm and cheered us on to victory.\n\nThe rain was unbelievable that night. It was a miracle the game even finished.\n\n…I scored the first when Franny Lee worked the ball in from the left and had a shot at goal. The keeper parried the shot and the ball was heading out towards me. I had managed to find some space inside the box, I looked across and reacted instinctively when the ball looped towards me. I had beaten the offside trap and a ball-watching defence, bang! 1-0.\n\nThe second goal was similar but in reverse if that makes sense. This time I made the goal for Franny but I felt a little aggrieved because I would definitely have scored a second had I not been cynically body checked by their goalkeeper.\n\nAnyone who can recall Harold Schumachers challenge on Patrice Battistan in the 1982 World Cup semi-final will know exactly what I mean. The referee didn’t even book the Gornik keeper but at least he gave us a penalty. Franny was quite lucky with the penalty, it went inthrough the keeper’s legs but only just.\n\nAt 2-0 we had some breathing space and the City fans present certainly thought it was all over because they were going berserk.\n\nOslizlo scored late on for Gornik to give us a nervous last few minutes, but even at 2-1 we felt comfortable and when the final whistle went it was absolute ecstacy. We were over the moon, or should I say the Blue Moon! We had done it.\n\nNEIL YOUNG SCORES TO MAKE IT 2-0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
