        "text": "Manchester United have confirmed the appointment of Jelle ten Rouwelaar as the club's new first-team goalkeeping coach, with the Dutchman joining after a short stint at Ajax.\n\nTen Rouwelaar is the latest change in the first-team coaching department at Carrington this season, with Rene Hake and Ruud van Nistelrooy joining as assistant managers, while Mitchell van der Gaag has left the club.\n\nTen Rouwelaar travelled with Van Nistelrooy and Hake to Trondheim for United's opening pre-season friendly of the summer and his appointment was confirmed while he was on the pitch at the Lerkendal Stadion warming up the goalkeepers in the squad, Radek Vitek, Dermot Mee and Elyh Harrison.\n\nALSO READ: Rosenborg vs United live as forgotten left-back starts\n\nALSO READ: United star generating interest as bids are rejected\n\nThe 43-year-old has been Vincent Kompany's goalkeeping coach for the previous four years, first at Anderlecht and then at Burnley. He left Turf Moor at the end of his contract this summer and signed a deal with Ajax before United showed an interest. They paid €100,000 in compensation to Ajax to prize him out of a job he had barely even started.\n\n“Jelle is experienced with English football and he has some great innovations in goalkeeping, a new approach and it’s very interesting,” said Erik ten Hag.\n\n“I’m convinced he will really help our game, as a team, but especially the keepers, as a squad, as a team, their position in the team and how they’re aligned with the rest of the team and playing as a collective.”\n\nTen Rouwelaar is set to replace Richard Hartis, whose departure hasn't yet been finalised. Assistant goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson has extended his stay at Old Trafford, however.\n\nHe will begin work with Andre Onana when United return to Carrington, with the club's first-choice goalkeeper missing the Rosenborg friendly to follow an individual fitness programme. Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton remain on a summer break after their involvement at Euro 2024."
