        "text": "Establishing a storage depot for aid materials\n\nMore than 2500 people are presumed dead in Haiti following the flooding and it is feared that this number may climb even higher when the full extent of the destruction is known.\n\nConcern logistician Cety Barberousse and Assistant Country Director Peter Doyle returned from an assessment in Thiotte in the Southern Department of Haiti on May 30. They reported that much of the surrounding area showed extensive damage as a result of flooding that destroyed housing settlements and washed away crops. Attempts to reach Mapou, an area hard-hit by the floods, were fruitless as the main road was blocked by floodwater. There was a noticeable stench in the area, suggesting burial of animal or human remains under flood debris nearby. Local medical staff from Thiotte hospital explained to the Concern team that they had traveled by foot to and from Mapou in order to give what assistance they could to those affected by the disaster.\n\nThroughout the assessment tour, Barberousee and Doyle met with local residents who described how they had seen men, women and children, homes and lifestock all washed away into the path of the floodwater. There were also hundreds of displaced families making their way from the worst affected areas towards the town of Thiotte.\n\nConcern's initial on-the-ground assessment determined...\n\n1. That there is an urgent need for food supplies, water purification materials and shelter materials to assist the estimated 3,000 people who have been severely affected by the flooding. People are hungry and looking for food rations. (Many people are missing and presumed to have been swept away by the floodwaters).\n\n2. That tents and plastic sheets are needed immediately for the families who have lost their homes.\n\n3. That Medical kits are needed for local health centers that are almost empty.\n\n4. That although there is a supply of water in community cisterns, purification materials are urgently needed to make this safe for drinking.\n\n5. Logistics are an issue and the situation is further complicated by the fact that the area can only be reached by helicopter with no transport at the other end to move materials into other affected areas.\n\nPlans are underway to coordinate with the United Nations to extend the size of the assessment area to include other outlying districts in the coming days.\n\nWhile media attention has been focused on the neighboring district of Mapou, the needs within the Thiotte district and other outlying areas must also be given immediate attention:"
