        "text": "Part of the Crossing The Line Festival\n\nPresented In Partnership with L’Alliance New York\n\nLoosely based on “Showgirls”, by Paul Verhoeven.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN PREMIERE\n\nA trashy American musical, an absurd cabaret, a techno oratorio of gender stereotypes: Marlène Saldana immerses herself in the unbridled mental universe of the heroine of Paul Verhoeven’s cult film to turn glitz and glitter into an antidote to violence and emptiness.\n\nABOUT THE WORK\n\n“How to survive in a world populated by scum?”, Jacques Rivette once wrote of Paul Verhoeven’s film. In 1995, the Dutch director filmed the grandeur and decadence of Las Vegas as a premonitory metaphor for an America that gorges itself on crass vulgarity and crushes people. The incandescent and obscene film shows without comment the fate of a young woman who has come to try her luck in the city of gambling and easy money. She accepts all kinds of humiliations and becomes a predator herself, ready to do anything to survive. Poorly received by critics and audiences alike on its release, it is now recognised as a monument of queer counter-culture, camp and pop expressionism; a cult film in which lightness, glitter and glitz describe the struggle of classes and sexes and relationships of domination and submission. Showgirls is a major film about gender, its violence and its metamorphoses.\n\nShowgirl premiered in 2021 at Théâtre Saint Gervais, Geneva. Its concept, text and performance are by Jonathan Drillet &amp; Marlène Saldana, freely Inspired by Showgirls, Paul Verhoeven’s 1995 film, and has original music Rebeka Warrior.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nJonathan Drillet is an actor, playwright, author, director. Born in 1981 in Saint Brieuc, he trained at the Ecole du Louvre and the Drama Conservatory of the 20th arrondissement of Paris. He has since worked with Raimund Hoghe, Hubert Colas, Sanja Mitrovic, Julien Prévieux. He works today as a performer and artistic collaborator with Jonathan Capdevielle, Théo Mercier, and Phia Ménard. In 2019 he wrote the text for the play Affordable Solution for Better Living by Théo Mercier and Steven Michel, which received the Silver Lion at the Venice Dance Biennale.\n\nMarlène Saldana is a multi-talented actress who played an ambivalent and voguing Jacques Demy in Christophe Honoré’s Les Idoles, as well as the more outlandish creatures that populate Sophie Perez and Xavier Boussiron’s shows. This time, she dives into the contradictory, bloated and delirious mental universe of Nomi, the heroine of Paul Verhoeven’s film. Between impotence and self-assertion, glitz and gloom, she struts about the stage as a powerful and clownish woman in a vulgar and crazy world. Like Nomi, she dances on a volcano, a nipple that evokes the absurdity of Beckett’s Happy Days as much as a podium for a Copi-like performance. Her Showgirl is a grotesque monologue, a queer stand-up set, a techno oratorio exalted by the relentless score composed by Julia Lanoë, aka Rebekka Warrior (Sexy Sushi, Kompromat, Mansfield.TYA): a lucid, joyful and nightmarish vision of a society sick of its patriarchal stereotypes and of a resurrection through derision, sequins and intoxication.\n\nJonathan Drillet and Marlène Saldana founded their company The United Patriotic Squadrons of Blessed Diana, based in Paris, in 2011. In 2021, they created Showgirl at the Théâtre Saint Gervais, Geneva as part of the La Bâtie festival. In 2023, they continued their research on Verhoeven’s movie by going to Los Angeles and Las Vegas through the Villa Albertine program. They came back with images for their own movie, Starkness, which will premiere in September 2024 (Barberousse Films). Their next creation, a group piece for 10 dancers, called Les chats, will premiere at Théâtre du Nord (Lille) in November 2024.\n\nRUN TIME\n\nApproximately 1 hour and 20 minutes.\n\nSUPPORT"
