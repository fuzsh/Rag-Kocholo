        "text": "Villa Albertine and Other Cinema present Underground Superstars: a night of outrageous and energized films by Villa Albertine resident Marie Losier, known for her loving portraits of poetic artists and performers such as Genesis P-Orridge, Felix Kubin, Cassandro Armendariz, and the legendary Kuchar brothers.\n\nCurated by avant-garde filmmaker and Other Cinema Director/Curator Craig Baldwin, this special tribute evening features a series of films by Marie Losier and the Kuchar Brothers, in the presence of none other than Marie and Mike Kuchar themselves!\n\nThis isn’t the first time Losier teams up with the Kuchar brothers. She’s created three films featuring Mike and his late brother George, one of which is screened at Saturday’s Underground Superstars event. The Kuchar brothers gained cult recognition for their over-the-top, no-budget films, and became major influential figures in the underground film and comics scenes since the 1960s, first in the Bronx and later in San Francisco.\n\nThe screening event is held at San Francisco non-profit art gallery and screening venue Artists’ Television Access (ATA), which aims to cultivate and highlight culturally aware, underground media and experimental art to promote innovative art and the exchange of non-conformist ideas. Baldwin’s work has been recognized and shown at festivals internationally, and his interests lie at the intersection of archival retrieval and re-combinatory forms of cinema, performance, and installation.\n\nFilmmaker, artist, and curator Marie Losier has worked in New York City for 23 years, and has shown her films and videos at museums, galleries, biennials and festivals around the world including i Cannes, Berlin, Rotterdam, IDFA, Tribeca, CPH:DOX, Cinéma du Réel, Torino, and Locarno. She’s made several film portraits on avant-garde directors, musicians and composers, andnow she joins us at the Villa Albertine in San Francisco to work on her portrait of the enigmatic band The Residents, co-produced by Barberousse Films."
