        "text": "Barberousse (Philippe Josse) was a Parisian press artist and cartoonist. After a technical education with the Ecole Centrale de la Radio and three years in animation in Germany during World War II, he turned to creating cartoons and illustrations. He published his first work in L'Agent de Liaison in 1946, and he has subsequently worked for Fantasia, Minerve, France-Dimanche, Samedi Soir and Ici-Paris. He developed a series of recognizable animal characters, of which the cat and the mouse, and also the dog 'Tonic', are the best-known.\n\nSome of his cat and mouse work appeared in the pocket book 'Le Chat et la Souris' in the Dupuis collection 'Gags de Poche' in 1964. In that same year, Casterman published a collection of his work called 'En suivant de crayon de Barberousse'. He also provided the illustrations for the book '7 ans, c'est tentant' by Jean Amadou, that was published at the time of the 1981 French presidential elections.\n\nBarberousse has also made promotional artwork for Watterman, Conord, Loto, Siemens, Phildar and the Jean Richard's circus. He has also worked extensively as a political cartoonist for TV shows, and he participated in the creation of the characters from Stéphane Collaro's 'Bébête Show'. Barberousse has furthermore written several children's songs, and made drawings for record covers and books. He developed the character 'Reinefeuille' for a TV show of 90 episodes in 1974."
