        "text": "This article is about a current or upcoming project.\n\nInformation may be added and/or changed as further updates become available.\n\nIf you see something missing, you can help the wiki by updating the article.\n\nBehind The Mask is an upcoming documentary film by filmmaker Marie Losier, which follows The Residents before, during and after their 50th Anniversary tour of Europe in 2023.[1] A release date for the film is yet to be announced.\n\nThe film began development in 2020, and entered production in late January 2023. The project is co-produced by Barberousse Films and Transpalette,[1] and supported by ZDF and the Centre National du Cinema in partnership with ARTE and Villa Albertine.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nBehind The Mask is a \"film essay\" about The Residents, which explores the space \"between myth and reality, between anonymity and everyday life\", encompassing \"storytelling, documentary, installation and creation\" through the use of various formats including 16mm film, digital video and archive material.[1]\n\nThe film opens with the death of the group's founding composer and engineer Hardy Fox in 2018, and features a \"ceremony\" intended to \"bring Fox back to life\". The film then follows a \"fantastic journey\" in the lives of the members of The Residents, imagining \"scenes from their daily [lives]\", with each scene like \"a painting, presenting their [lives] and the characters they have been able to embody throughout their career\".[1]\n\nProduction[]\n\nFrench documentary filmmaker Marie Losier approached The Cryptic Corporation around 2021, proposing to produce a film on The Residents. Cryptic's \"Captain Doc\", Homer Flynn, was \"sold\" on the project when he saw and \"loved\" Losier's 2018 film Cassandro the Exotico!, which he described as an \"amazing documentary\".[2][3]\n\nBehind The Mask was quietly announced on January 27th 2023, through social media posts by @barberousse_films on Instagram and Mathilde Delaunay on Facebook. The posts featured a photo of The Residents in their Duck Stab! Alive! costumes, alongside an announcement that filming had begun that day for a Marie Losier-directed film about The Residents.\n\nFilming took place throughout 2023 in Bourges, Brussels, Paris, Essen, and San Francisco (all locations visited by The Residents on their Faceless Forever tour, and the last being their home of fifty years). The Cryptic Corporation's most direct acknowledgment of the documentary was in the March 2023 Cherry Red Residents newsletter, which mentioned that that the group had been \"allowing themselves to be filmed for a proposed documentary.\"\n\nOn June 21st, Instagram accounts @barberousse_films and @Fluorescentpool began publishing photos from the production of the film, debuting apparently newly constructed Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, and Mr. Brown eyeball masks (worn by François Yves Octave Marcel, Paula Rodríguez Polanco, and Eléonore Berrubé respectively). The photos also featured the actresses Vimala Pons and Marlène Saldana, and a number of crew members. Between June 22nd and July 1st, further set photos were uploaded to Instagram by @raquel__wesh, @itsleoski, @Fluorescentpool, and @barberousse_films.\n\nThe production moved to San Francisco for around early September.[4] On September 8th, the second-generation Mr. Blue was spotted being filmed by Losier at Amoeba Records and Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco; Mr. Blue graciously posed for photos with fans during these appearances.[5][6] The production left San Francisco after around \"six or seven weeks\".[4]\n\nComparing Losier's film to Don Hardy's 2015 documentary Theory of Obscurity: A Film About The Residents, Homer Flynn noted that, as opposed to the \"journalistic approach\" of the earlier film, \"what Marie is going to do will be 180 degrees different... so you'll have these two contrasting points of view, which I think is... very cool and, in a way, kind of Residential.\"[7]\n\nSee also[]\n\nMarie Losier\n\nFaceless Forever\n\n[]"
