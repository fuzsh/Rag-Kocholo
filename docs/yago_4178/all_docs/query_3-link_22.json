        "text": "Anika Poitier’s first love was film. Yet with a child on the way, she says, “I needed a creative outlet that was more kid-friendly.” So Poitier teamed up with her interior designer mother on a textile and accessories line. Their first collection centered on female artists and grew from there. A signature design is an infinity-style serpent. “It symbolizes strength and the journey to empowerment,” says the designer, who employs her filmmaker eye when selecting materials, and is drawn to linen for its transparent and natural qualities. “I love the way light shines through. We all want to exist in a calm, nurturing space.” Today, that notion rings more true than ever. Anika Poitier’s first love was film.
