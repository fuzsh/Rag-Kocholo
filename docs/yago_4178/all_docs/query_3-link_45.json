        "text": "Raymond Barberousse was born in Kinshasa, Zaire (now recognized as the Democratic Republic of Congo) of Haitian parents who eventually settled down in the energetic borough of Brooklyn, New York. Growing up in Brooklyn, Raymondâ€™s artistic inclinations began to flourish. He found inspiration in the vibrant street art, the dynamic architecture, and the kaleidoscope of cultures that defined his surroundings.\n\nFueled by his passion for design and creativity, Raymond pursued a Bachelor of Architecture from Howard University School of Architecture in Washington D.C. Equipped with a solid foundation of the principles of architecture, he embarked on an architectural career where he transformed spaces and environments with his creativity and keen eye for detail.\n\nHowever, his creative journey took an unexpected turn when Raymond found a new avenue for self-expression, seamlessly blending form and function to create light fixtures that are sculptural in form and structural in composition. His unique designs strike a delicate balance between vintage beauty and dynamic modern design.\n\nToday, Raymond, his wife and two amazing kids call the vibrant city of Miami, Florida, home. Through his work, he seeks to not only illuminate spaces but also ignite imaginations, inviting viewers to experience the harmonious fusion of creativity and craftsmanship that defines his vision."
