        "text": "Becoming more sustainable in the beauty industry - my reflections after listening to a very enlightening COP28 speech by Oriele Frank (thank you for addressing so many critical areas). There are many aspects to our industry that need addressing from sourcing of ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, consumer use and disposing. Whilst many focus on these points, we are also needing to address the sheer volumes that are manufactured and never end up being with who they are intended for, the consumer and unfortunately end up in landfill or incinerated. This not only causes an impact on financial losses, it affects our planet's ecosystem and we are just in an endless cycle that no one seems to be addressing in a way that is financially pro-active for companies, speaks to consumers values and begins the journey to anti-landfill. It's no mean feat though, this will take years to get to where it needs to be, however, we can only make changes if we take those steps forward and try. This is why I feel so passionately about the excess product taboo that many companies need these pain points handled in a way that ticks as many of the Earth friendly requirements, reduces those financial losses, increases sales, brand awareness and generates insightful data to help streamline manufacturing stock numbers all whilst tackling the waste that is generated. I'll put the link for Oriele's COP28 speech below (trust me it's worth it!) and I would love to open up discussions on excess beauty product stock waste so feel free to engage with me in the comments section or you can message me directly and I will be happy to help in any way that I can. https://lnkd.in/eSF3-YyZ #sustainablebeauty #excessstock #beautyagainstwaste #cop28 #recycling #beautyindustry #beautymarketing #ecosystem #elemis #beautybrands\n\nFor everyone at #cop28 and anyone in power, I urge you to listen with intention and reflection to the opening speech by HM King Charles this morning in Dubai. His words today are more important than ever before. Listen. Reflect. Act. I hope that the Danish delegation begins reimagine on how to drive a nature positive economy with vision and deep citizen mobilisation. If one of the world's richest nations and peoples cannot find balance with nature, what part of the world can? A few learnings from my journey which I help will assist you when you think about whether to defend status-quo or actually make radical progress in the UAE: Think circular, not linear. Embrace complexity and admit that there is no quick, simple fix. Go from a masculine, zero-sum, patriarchal mindset to one that embrace the feminine and our deep inner knowing. Think and act for the long term of all people and species (invite nature to the table, its our lifesupport system) Do what is right, not what satisfy a few powerful stakeholders. Understand that leadership is not about who is the most popular or who is in charge, rather it's taking people to a place they otherwise wouldn't go. #regenerativeleadership #regenerativeeconomy #regenerativeagriculture https://lnkd.in/ecnUzH3B\n\nOn Friday night at the Museum of the Future in Dubai we held our â€˜Cut to the Futureâ€™ reception. Thank you to all who were able to join us! We were honoured to have the company of prominent figures, including: H.E. Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, the Minister of Economy of the United Arab Emirates; Shaikh Dr. Majid Al Qassimi, Founder & Partner at Soma Mater Management Consultancies; The Hon. Chris Bowen MP, Australian Minister for Climate Change and Energy; Gergely FÃ¡biÃ¡n, State Secretary of the Ministry for Economic Development of Hungary, and Cristian Busoi, Member of the European Parliament. Collaborative partnerships, represented by our distinguished guests from academia, industry, and politics, are essential for expediting our plans to decarbonise iron and steel production and invest in the workforce of today and the future. ðŸ’¬ Sanjeev Gupta, our Executive Chairman and Founder, stressed the need for collective action, and outlined the urgency of reducing emissions in the steel sector. He said, \"Steel has built the modern world. The industrial revolution was largely about carbon and steel. Now, once again, there is a new revolution happening, and that is a green revolution â€“ a green steel and hydrogen revolution.\" 'Cut to the Future' represents our call to action, highlighting our transition towards green iron and steel, and our ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 (CN30). We can only achieve this by working together, and we invite you to join us in our endeavour. #CutToTheFuture #ClimateAction #COP28 #ZeroEmissions #NetZero #GREENSTEEL #Decarbonisation #Sustainability"
