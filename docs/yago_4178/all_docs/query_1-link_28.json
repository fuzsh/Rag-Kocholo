        "text": "In 1492, Captain Antoine de Ville de Domjulien climbed the “inaccessible mountain” on the orders of King Charles VIII. Why did a king want to take on a mountain? How could such an undertaking be accomplished?\n\nThe Mont Aiguille – Carmo – Corps armé en montagne project aims to understand the relationship between ancient societies and verticality, in particular through the political uses and military knowledge of mountains during the Renaissance.\n\nThe experimental archaeology approach enables us to reconstruct vanished equipment, in this case 15th-century assault ladders, in order to rediscover their contextualized uses by restoring their actual conditions of use: “climbing” proper, at least as it was practiced in the 15th century.\n\nLudovic Veltz’s 40-minute documentary follows the progress of the scientific project from start to finish, and in particular the historian’s work, from the archival source to experimentation both in the laboratory for biomechanical tests and in the wild on Mont Aiguille. It recounts the researcher’s trial and error, and the slow work of informing and working with local players: craftsmen, enthusiasts, schoolchildren, elected representatives…\n\nThe use of drones and photogrammetry enabled us to create a 3D model of Mont Aiguille, visually recreating the ascent as it might have been in 1492, while providing an immersive experience for the viewer."
