[1].\n\nCarruthers served as chairman of the The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC), a pro-industry \"junk science\" front group created and funded by Philip Morris through the PR firm APCO Associates, now known as APCO Worldwide.[2] He was only ever nominally the head of TASSC; the real behind-the-scenes work was done by a younger professional lobbyist Steve Milloy who became a regular celebrity on Murdoch's Fox TV News. Milloy eventually took over the front-role, and became an on-line arbitrator of what was junk-science and what was 'sound science'. He was the polluting industries' main supporter and cheer-squad leader, both in the health ('tobacco smoke is not dangerous') and environmental ('there is no such thing as climate change') fileds.\n\nCarruther later became the Dean of New Mexico State University's College of Business and is listed as the formerly President and CEO of Cimarron Health Plan. He serves on the board of Arrowhead, an economic development center in Las Cruces, as well as a number of other corporate and public organizations.\" [1]\n\nChair, Think New Mexico\n\nDocuments & TimeLine\n\nGovernor Garrey Carruthers, was probably recruited to head the TASSC by Bob Baberousse (TAI's Legislative Counsel) and Betsy LeMond of Philip Morris.\n\n1986 Oct The Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) Foundation Update announces that President Reagan has named CSE Foundation President Richard H. Fink one of 12 members of the newly-established President's Commission on Privatization. Other commission members are:\n\nAnnelise Graebner Anderson, senior fellow. Hoover Institution\n\nMichael D.

A report on New Mexico for the tobacco industry notes:\n\nThe TI lobbylist does not anticipate any significant tort reform activity in 1988. Collateral sources may be given consideration, as may insurance regulation or workers compensation issues. There is virtually no chance that product liability proposals will be introduced or could move in 1988.\n\nGovernor Carruthers sees tort reform as valuable to economic development, but he is not actively pushing for reforms in 1988. His effectiveness in promoting legislation is questionable.\n\nThe Speaker of the House is firmly opposed the tort and product liability reform. He is backed by the Trial Lawyers and the AFL-CIO.\n\nThe New Mexico Alliance for Tort Reform worked for 1987 legislation, but considers 1988 an unlikely year for action due to the time constraint.\n\nThe Institute lobbyist [Barberousse] works this issue through his representation of the Association of Independent Insurers. The industry has not been approached for coalition support. [6]\n\n[Barberousse was, in effect, being double-paid for his work by both the insurance and the tobacco industries.]\n\n1988 Jan 18 Weekly Activities of Terry Frakes for the Tobacco Institute in Region VIII (including New Mexico). He was meeting with David Remes of Covington & Burling (C&B) in Austin Texas, and then went to Sante Fe in New Mexico.\n\nI also had the opportunity to sit down at length with Bob Barberousse, local TI counsel, and discuss the 1988 session of the New Mexico legislature. While I was there a 5 cent a pack cigarette tax bill was filed in the Senate.\n\nAttended a luncheon for the Governor of New Mexico, and Barberousse and I had a chance to sit down and meet with the Speaker of the House, Ray Sanchez. [7]\n\n1990 Mar 9 The Tobacco Institute newsletter \"Executive Summary\" contains an item:\n\nNew Mexico Governor Carruthers has called a three-day special session on revenue starting March 16. Among the governor's proposals is a 4-cent cigarette excise tax increase. During the regular session, the legislature defeated proposals for 6- and 10-cent cigarette tax hikes.\n\nThe following week it reported\n\nNew Mexico adjourned the special legislative session without acting on Governor Carruthers's 4-cent cigarette excise tax proposal [8]\n\n1993 March Statement of Support for TASSC: this is a draft card design which says \"Inappropriate science only harms the integrity of public policy decisions\" and asks for a financial contribution (to make it look like a genuine grassroots organisation). This preliminary copy design was in the files of Steve Parrish at Philip Morris Corporate Affairs. [9]\n\n1993 May The TASSC Statement of Principles draft was in the files of Philip Morris's Worldwide Regulatory Affairs (these are the lawyers and political lobbyists). It gives no address other than Washington DC box number, a fax number & phone number) [10]\n\n1993 May 12 Writing to Richard Lindzen at MIT trying to recruit him to TASSC Curruthers had been an economist at New Mexico State Uni\n\nLindzen only had to \"complete the enclosed Statement of Support\" to become a member.

Additionally, in 1991, the Coalition presented (then) Mayor Fredrico Pena with the Smoke-Free Award in recognition of his support and dedication to creating a smoke-free environment in Denver. US West received the \"Smoke-Free Award\" in 1989.\n\nFrom 1993, Steve Milloy was working as the researcher and organiser, running TASSC from behind the scenes.\n\n1993 Nov A TASSC list sent to the Tobacco Institute along with press clippings showing the success of Curruthers in his media tours. This is supposedly the launch date. [13]\n\n1994 Miami '94 journalists conference. PAHO doc 'Profits over People p30 Carruthers is paid $5,000 a month\n\n1994 April The first quarterly newsletter 'The Catalyst' by TASSC and asking for help in finding members. It says that the organisation was launched last Fall (November) and that it already has \"more than 400 individuals or organisations\" including \"75 respected scientists and academicians from some of the nation's finest colleges universities, and leading research institutions.\"\n\nIt had been promoted by \"a national media tour that took us to Denver, St Louis, San Diego, and Dallas/Fort Worth.\"\n\nThe newsletter spells out examples of unsound science (the term \"junk science\" hadn't yet become its currency.) Judging from the turgid writing, Milloy may not have been employed at this time. They have a mailing list for their releases for 650 media outlets. Carruther's key supporters were\n\nFloy Lilley,a Florida lawyer who had become the director of the Clint W Muchison Chair of Free Enterprise at the University of Texas at Austin. She was ex-Xerox Corp., a member of Elizabeth Whelan's American Council on Science and Health, and a climate denier.[14]\n\nhttps://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/pkhm0090\n\nDr Margaret N Maxey the previous holder of the Free Enterprise chair at the University of Texas. She was from the Energy Research Institute and a member of the American Nuclear Society and a half-dozen other related energy and risk-assessment societies. [15]\n\nUnder the direction of these three TASSC was:\n\n* in support of bovine somatotropin (BST was a hormone used to promote milk production and activists were objecting)\n\n* in support of the Carpet and Rug Institute (vapour exudates from synthetic carpets were saturating some offices)\n\n* against the Alar scare\n\n* against the EPA being raised to Cabinet status by President Clinton.\n\n* against the super-fund toxic waste/landfill projects\n\n* anti the Clean Air Act [16]\n\n1994 Oct /E TASSC's newsletter, Vol 1 No 3 \"The Catalyst\"\n\nThe American scientific community is very concerned that public confidence in scientific research is being seriously eroded by policy makers who use scientific findings to conform to political agendas, according to a poll sponsored by The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC).\n\nThe poll, conducted by The Tarrance Group of Houston, Texas, showed that 62 percent of scientists believe public confidence in scientific research has decreased in the last 10 years, and 83 percent agree that policy makers use science to achieve their policy goals in controversial issues such as asbestos, pesticides, dioxin, environmental tobacco smoke or water quality.\n\nEd Goeas, President and CEO of The Tarrance Group, also attended the news conference and said, \"Overall, researchers are critical of the need for more stringent adherence to scientific principles and a thorough review process of research. These data clearly indicate wide-spread concern over how scientific research is conducted, why it is conducted, and how it is used in the formation of public policy.\"\n\nAfter months of research and 10% development, The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) issued its \"Five Guiding Scientific Principles\" to offer a standard against which policy-makers should measure research.\n\nThe TASSC member scientists who assisted in drafting our Statement of Principles are :\n\nDr. James E. Enstrom, University of California at Los Angeles School of Public Health;\n\nDr. Alan Gross of the Medical University of South Carolina;\n\nDr. Jay Lehr, senior scientist, Environmental Evaluation Enterprises;\n\nDr. George Levinskas, fellow, director and past president of the Academy of Toxicological Sciences;\n\nDr. Floy Lilley, College of Engineering, University of Texas.\n\nAlso,\n\nDr. Margaret Maxey, professor of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas;\n\nDr. Patrick Michaels, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia;\n\nDr. Henry Miller, visiting scholar, Hoover Institution, Stanford University;\n\nDr. Stuart F.

TASSC's \"The Catalyst\" newsletter reports that Carruthers was speaking\n\nto a symposium in Sao Paulo, Brazil on \"New Advances in Ambient Air and Cardio-Respatory Illnesses:\"\n\nin La Jolla, San Diego, California, speaking to the California Independent Petroleum Association.\n\nat the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission 's mid-year meeting\n\nat the Indoor Air Quality, Immunity and Health Conference (invited by Alan Hedge)\n\n[18]\n\n1996 Mar 4 TASSC has as a science adviser, Michael Pariza , Director of the Food Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is supporting the National Restaurant Association against claims by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) about fatty foods done as part of its National menu Monitoriing program.\n\nTASSC granted a \"media manipulation award\" to the CSPI for its report warning consumers about nutritional hazards in sandwiches. \"It's time for everyone to say 'no' to this junk science\", said Garrey Carruthers, chairman of TASSC, \"It's time to reject this fear-mongering nonsense.\" [19]\n\n1997 Mar Steve Milloy took over officially as 'Executive Director' of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC) . He had previously been hired as the 'behind the scenes contact' who could answer press questions. For a while Garrey Curruthers continued to parade himself as 'President' and 'Founder'.\n\nThe so-called Management Board listed in the TASSC letterhead was also sometimes called an \"Advisory Board\" [Not a SAB], and different listings had different names at different times. George L Carlo's name never appears on the letterhead, but he is listed by APCO (the PR company which ran the operation behind the scenes) as a member of the TASSC Scientific Advisory Board .\n\nThis Advisory Board appears to have consisted of a variable list with at least 7 well-known tobacco industry 'consultants', only a few of which were 'scientists':\n\nMickey Edwards , Republican politician\n\nMichael Gough , OTA scientist/dioxin now with Cato Institute (a close Milloy's friend)\n\nJames Steele , ex-Ass.
