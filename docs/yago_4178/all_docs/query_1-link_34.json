He gradually introduces his student to the unglamorous side of the profession, ultimately assigning him to care for a prostitute rescued from a local brothel.",

        "text": "This is not the best film I've ever seen. Yet.\n\nIt's a very simple story about two doctors working in a medical clinic that caters to the poor. But this is just the glue that ties together a wonderful tapestry of short stories that ask the most fundamental question: why must we treat everyone with dignity? Why do some of us assume that certain people may be less worthy of it, including the dying, the poor and the insane?\n\nIn one heartbreaking tableau, Kurosawa forces us to watch a dying man painfully try and take breaths. It takes him a long time to die, and we are forced to watch along with the young doctor. It is difficult to see.…\n\nAn incredible humanist masterwork. Red Beard is a humbling film of death and pain, but most importantly kindness. The lead character is young and selfish, in need of a wise and patient teacher. The titular character is stubborn and gruff, but a good and honest man. Through them comes an understanding of the power of conscientious care, mental health matters as much as the physical. People are not broken, they can be healed and loved, abuse can be left in the past. Everyone deserves kindness, and those able to be patient, caring, and loving, provide the world with more than enough.\n\nRed Beard philosophises on what makes someone a good doctor. It is not an ability to heal, but an…\n\nI knew, somehow, that Kurosawa was capable of making a film I would like as much as I did Ikiru, but I certainly did not expect it.\n\nAs I watched this film unfold, I worried. I worried that it would go off the rails, that it would turn bitter and cynical, that it would reveal the good doctor to be a fraud or a villain somehow, or that it somehow the world would let me down and defend the initial attitudes of the protagonist. After all, it's a 3 hour film. There has to be conflict, and it certainly seemed to set up that conflict between protagonist and Red Beard as the central one. So when that conflict seemingly resolved…\n\nI remain deeply suspicious of looking to art for moral instruction that extends any further than simple empathy, but if ever a movie showed us Life and How to Live It, it must be Red Beard. Kurosawa had already shown his affinity for the Russian masters, but here he really achieves the perfect blend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky with a film as panoramic as the former (Kurosawa truly makes widescreen seem like it's taking in the whole of a society) and as intimately concerned with the simmering tensions of morality and existence as the latter. This is a work of opulent intimacy, of mostly talking set against a vast canvas that dwarfs but also magnifies the central players. This is…\n\n#madlad Mifune\n\n'The pain and loneliness of death frighten me. But Dr. Niide looks at it differently. He looks into their hearts as well as their bodies.'\n\nRed Beard is the movie that cures the heart with human kindness.\n\nKurosawa composes an ode to humanism through a doctor whose mission is to help people who suffer physically and mentally. There is no honor or money in what he does: he treats the sick with the meager funds he receives from the government, and he remains gentle with those who slander him and reject his help. His dedication shines in his small acts: he repeatedly offers water to a physically abused little girl until she finally accepts instead of splashing it…\n\n***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***\n\nAkahige is, simply, one of a kind. Regardless of the motivations that the multiphacetic Japanese master had in mind, one thing that has remained clear even nowadays is that he aimed towards a different perspective. He required a perspective that exalted humankind at its highest and most moralistic point. The protagonists were no longer drawn into epic battle scenes; ambitious lords were no longer the main characters; samurais did not abound in the screen anymore. Kurosawa's masterpiece is about the perseverance of the human condition and ends up becoming an incredibly powerful learning experience. Toshirô Mifune is back assuming a different leading role, yet mirroring the past personalities he had…\n\nIt's truly satisfying in a sick way for me to see Red Beard, one of the most lauded \"classics\" in history, getting a low 70s on Rotten Potatoes. Despite the fact that I'm by no means a Kurosawa fan, and that the only work I truly enjoy from him is High and Low, It's still disheartening that every time I've decided to give Kurosawa one more chance, it's yet another disappointment with another entry of his filmography. However, when it comes to Red Beard, it's simply one of the biggest insomnia-killers and one of the most excruciatingly joyless experiences I've had with motion pictures.\n\nRed Beard admittedly has great potentials on paper: a slow-burn story about two doctors bonding over…\n\nAkira Kurosawa has become a staple, an icon if you wish, of the Samurai genre. From classics like \"The Seven Samurai\" to \"Rashomon\" all have escalated into our film conscious while also somewhat reinventing and injecting themselves into other genres outside Japan. However, for those who have actually gone beyond the director's filmography, will find ourselves him tackling other genres such as Thriller (High and Low) or social drama (Ikiru). But one thing even I got caught off guard and by total surprise was this flick, Kurosawa's take on medical drama with some social justice message thrown in the mix.\n\nThe story of a doctor that sees himself above the rural town he's given pretty much an \"internship,\" will not…"
