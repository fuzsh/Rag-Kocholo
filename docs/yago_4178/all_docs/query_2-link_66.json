        "text": "End of Empire Cinema and the First Banlieue Film by Alan O’Leary\n\nfrom Film Quarterly Winter 2016, Volume 70, Number 2\n\nLa bataille d’Alger (The Battle of Algiers, Gillo Pontecorvo), which premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 3, 1966, has turned fifty. In itself, this fact is trivial; after all, a great many films are reaching their half-century mark these days. The difference is that The Battle of Algiers—an Italian-Algerian co-production commissioned by the Algerians themselves as a hymn to their achievement of independence from France in 1962—seems to reach far beyond cinema itself to attain an “endlessly renewed contemporary resonance.”1 The re-release of Battle in 2004 was marked by ruminations and polemics regarding the film’s argument for urban terrorism in the service of national liberation.2 Commentators put a new emphasis on the film’s picturing of Islam, a dimension of Battle that seemed to require comment in the light of September 11, 2001.3 Today, attacks inspired or directed by ISIS seem to ensure that the film and its sympathetic version of “Islamic” violence retain a controversial visibility.4 At the same time, the film’s presentation of the “rational” argument made by the French military for the use of torture as a means to gather intelligence speaks to Battle‘s ambivalence about its anticolonial theme.5\n\nLet it be said immediately that discourses situating Battle in relation to contemporary Islamist or Islamist-inspired violence partake of an old-fashioned Orientalism that posits a clash of civilizations, homogenizes North Africa and the Middle East in terms of a “pan-Arab terrorism,” and obscures the history of Western occupation as itself terroristic (whether as the direct violence of oppression or as the structural violence of racial hierarchies and economic exploitation).6 But such discourse is also of a piece with the negative reception of Battle that dates back to its original premiere at the Venice film festival, when the French delegation walked out in protest.7 Subsequent denunciation was as loud from the left as from the right, with the former dismissing the film’s “objectivity”—that is, its presentation of the human cost to both sides and its refusal to demonize even the torturers—as a sop to bourgeois sensibility.8 In fact, any film dealing with the ugly circumstances of political violence will inevitably generate debate and controversy, but it is valid to ask whether, apart from its relevance to world affairs, there is anything left to say about Battle today.9\n\nIts fiftieth anniversary offers an occasion to challenge some of the commonplaces about the film and to show that there remains much to be clarified about its character. An attention to location in the film and a focus on its little-discussed coda can resituate Battle as a film that, going beyond its well-recognized revolutionary narrative, deals with the end of the French empire and represents the first in a line of banlieue cinema—that is, as a film that presciently anticipates postcolonial conditions on the territory of France itself.\n\nEditor’s Note\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Rich asks: “What does it mean that in today’s context The Battle of Algiers has begun to look like a recruiting film for Al-Qaeda?” (111). I use the ideological word terrorism without quotes in the text because the term itself is employed in Battle by one of the revolutionary leaders.\n\n3. See, for example, Carlo Celli, Gillo Pontecorvo: From Resistance to Terrorism (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2005).\n\n4. Nicholas Harrison has assessed the “Islamic elements” in Battle and analyzed the problems in the critical discourse concerning these in “Yesterday’s Mujahiddin: Gillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers (1966),” in Postcolonial Film: History, Empire, Resistance, ed. Peter Hulme and Rebecca Weaver-Hightower (London: Routledge, 2014), 23–46.\n\n5. Amanda Crawley and Sophie Watt have recently pointed to how the lucidity of its presentation of counterinsurgency techniques, including those of “enhanced interrogation,” meant that Battle came to be used as a training film for military and police internationally. “La bataille d’Alger or the Colonial Warfare at the Roots of a New World Order,” paper presented at the symposium “The Battle of Algiers at 50: Legacies in Film and Literature,” May 18, 2016, University of Sheffield. Even Edward Said, a great admirer of Battle, worried in an interview with Pontecorvo that the director might admire the imperialists he portrayed. See “The Quest for Gillo Pontecorvo,” in Reflections on Exile and Other Essays (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2000), 282–92.\n\n6.

The Torino museum holds a range of important collections, several dedicated to Italian directors of the sixties and seventies like Elio Petri, Francesco Rosi, and Pontecorvo himself. The Pontecorvo archive has yet to be catalogued, but I have been able to consult it thanks to the generosity of archivists Carla Ceresa and Mauro Genovese. Several folders of material pertain to Battle or to Parà, the unfilmed script that predates Battle, also dedicated to the Algerian war and developed by Pontecorvo and his scriptwriter Franco Solinas with the producer Franco Cristaldi.\n\n11. For a summary of some of the criticism of the film in these terms, see Nancy Virtue, “Poaching within the System: Gillo Pontecorvo’s Tactical Aesthetics in The Battle of Algiers,” Screen 55:3 (2014): 317–37.\n\n12. I have not seen a copy of the film with this title intact, but it is recorded in a contemporary review by Maurice Rapf entitled “High Drama in a History Restaged,” Life Magazine, October 27, 1967. For the often-retold story of how the film stock was treated in order to achieve the newsreel effect, see Irena Bignardi, “The Making of The Battle of Algiers,” Cineaste 25:2 (2000): 14–22, on 19–20.\n\n13. Virtue, “Poaching within the System,” 318.\n\n14. Forgacs writes that “the film that Pontecorvo made in Algiers in 1965 was, in a loose sense, a remake of Roma città aperta twenty years later,” though he warns that “one should push the analogy only so far” (“Italians in Algiers,” 362).\n\n15. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Italian Fascism’s Empire Cinema (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2015). With the phrase “end of empire,” I am also thinking of work on architecture in Algiers that informs my account in this article: Sheila Crane, “Architecture at the Ends of Empire: Urban Reflections between Algiers and Marseille,” in The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics and Everyday Life, ed. Gyan Prakash and Kevin M. Kruse (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2008), 99–143.\n\n16. See Ruth Ben-Ghiat, “Fascism, Writing, and Memory: The Realist Aesthetic in Italy, 1930–1950,” Journal of Modern History 67:3 (1995): 627–65, and “The Italian Colonial Cinema: Agendas and Audiences,” Modern Italy 8:1 (2003): 49–63. Marie-France Courriol has traced debates in the 1930s–40s concerning the cross-fertilization of documentary and fictional realism in Italian empire cinema set in Africa or the territories occupied by Italy in South Eastern Europe. See Courriol, “Documentary Strategies and Aspects of Realism in Italian Colonial Cinema (1935–1939),” Italianist 34:2 (2014): 122–41.\n\n17. Evidently, there is something to be said about how Battle might be dealing in a cryptic or displaced way with the legacy of Italian colonialism. Rhiannon Noel Welch has already pointed this out in “Contact, Contagion, Immunization: Gianni Amelio’s Lamerica,” in Italian Mobilities, ed. Ruth Ben-Ghiat and Stephanie Malia Hom (London: Routledge, 2016), 68–87, on 84n. Lucy Riall has recently argued that it is important to consider Italian colonialism beyond Italy’s “official” colonies (“The Global Turn in Modern Italian History: Perspectives and Comparisons,” plenary paper at the Society for Italian Studies interim conference, Trinity College Dublin, April 30, 2016). Many European migrants to Algeria were Italian, and these Italians were in a sense “colonialists”: Battle can also be read to be dealing with their history, and to be alluding, however obliquely, to the fascist fantasy of “an imperial-diasporic nation that encompassed Italians in [Italy’s] colonies, the metropole, and in Italian communities abroad” (Ben-Ghiat, Italian Fascism’s Empire Cinema, xvii).\n\n18. As Ben-Ghiat writes, a definition of realism from 1933 by the avowedly fascist writer Elio Talarico, “a need for commitment, humanity, for a true sense of things and a concrete vision of the world,” is identical to definitions to be found in left-wing theories of realism after 1945. It is by now well accepted, at least within Italian Studies, that (to quote Ben-Ghiat once again) “works such as [Rome Open City], which are often viewed as a stylistic rupture with the culture of fascism, may be better considered as the products of a decade of experimentation and debates over the realist aesthetic” (Ben-Ghiat, “Fascism, Writing, and Memory,” 653, 660).\n\n19. Courriol, “Documentary Strategies,” 128.\n\n20. A comparison could usefully be made of the coda of Battle and the exuberant crowd scenes that close the Italian empire film Bengasi (Augusto Genina, 1942).\n\n21.

Mary Jean Green, “Echoes of the Casbah: From Pépé Le Moko to Bab El-Oued City,” Nottingham French Studies 46:1 (2007): 68–83.\n\n24. Even the French military operation to defeat the FLN in Algiers is christened “Operation Champagne.”\n\n25. In thinking of the spatial oppositions in Battle in terms of rhetoric, I am following David Forgacs in “Space, Rhetoric, and the Divided City in Roma città aperta,” in Robert Rossellini’s Rome Open City, ed. Sidney Gottlieb (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 106–30. Forgacs’s analysis (building on Michel de Certeau) of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the city in Rossellini’s film has obvious applications to Battle, as Forgacs himself hints in his previously mentioned article “Italians in Algiers.”\n\n26. The film reprises a long-standing policy by the FLN to present their struggle at the international level. For an account of how the Algerian war of independence was also a war for international opinion waged between the French and the FLN, see Matthew Connelly, “Rethinking the Cold War and Decolonization: The Grand Strategy of the Algerian War for Independence,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 33:2 (2001): 221–45. The character of the film’s multiple address has yet to be thoroughly analyzed, though Murray Smith touches on this theme in “The Battle of Algiers: Colonial Struggle and Collective Allegiance,” in Terrorism, Media, Liberation, ed. J. David Slocum (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2005), 94–110.\n\n27. Most commentators erroneously speak of the coda events occurring two years after the death of the FLN leader Ali La Pointe that ends the main body of the film, but Ali was actually killed in October 1957 and the coda takes place in 1960. Battle opens with an onscreen title with the place and year “Alger 1957” and circles back to this date via the long flashback that constitutes the bulk of the film. The historical protests shown in the coda took place in response to rallies by pro-French hardliners against the visit of the French president Charles de Gaulle to Algeria in December 1960. In the previous month, de Gaulle had stated in a televised speech that an Algerian republic would “one day exist” and with its own government. Interestingly, the film omits this context.\n\n28. Jim House, “Colonial Containment? Repression of Pro-independence Street Demonstrations in Algiers, Casablanca and Paris, 1945–1962,” War in History 24 (2017). Sincere thanks to Jim House, my colleague at Leeds, for sharing with me his research on the December 1960 protests in advance of its publication.\n\n29. I have placed the word “flow” in inverted commas because in this context it is a term that bespeaks Orientalism. Connelly has described how France tended to understand the Algerian desire for independence as solely to do with problems related to the growth of the Muslim population: “while Algerians endured gross economic and political equality, French social scientists insisted that demographic disparities explained the [Algerian] war and that only French-led development could address them” [Connelly’s italics]. Political agitation, he argues, was therefore “depicted as a ‘rising tide’ or a river overflowing its backs—even by anticolonialists like the director Gillo Pontecorvo. His The Battle of Algiers…deliberately pictured Algerians as a flooding river sweeping the French before them.” Michael Connelly, A Diplomatic Revolution: Algeria’s Fight for Independence and the Origins of the Post–Cold War Era (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), xi. For Pontecorvo’s use of the river metaphor, see Piernico Solinas, Gillo Pontecorvo’s “The Battle of Algiers” (New York: Scribners, 1973), 165–66. The employment of Orientalist metaphor and stereotypes is a dimension of Battle that has been noted but not yet adequately treated in terms of the film’s address to the France and the colonizing North.\n\n30. The Casbah is heard, though, with chanting and the ululation sounds made by Algerian women emerging from it. As many have noticed, the aural dimension of the film carries a powerful charge. The protest sequences, especially those I discuss that take place at Climat de France, feature an echoey, “distressed” sound quality (as if recorded with rudimentary equipment) that is of a piece with the high contrast film stock and use of telephoto lenses.\n\n31. Robert Descloîtres, Claudine Descloîtres, and Jean-Claude Reverdy, L’Algérie des bidonvilles (Paris, 1961), 81, cited in House, “Colonial Containment?”\n\n32. House, “Colonial Containment?” It is said that in the 1950s the Casbah held the world record for human density, with 70,000 people living in an area of twenty hectares, or about fifty acres.\n\n33. See Kahina Amal Djiar, “Politics and Housing in 1950s French Algiers.” in The Politics of Making, ed. Mark Swenarton, Idea Troiani, and Helena Webster (London: Routledge, 2007), 36–48.\n\n34. Chevallier speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Diar El-Mahçoul housing project, quoted in Zeynep Çelik, Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers under French Rule (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 143.\n\n35. Karen Pinkus has argued that Italian fascist-period architecture in L’Eclisse (Eclipse, Michelangelo Antonioni, 1962) is employed to figure the incomplete process of decolonization on the territory of Italy itself. See Pinkus, “Empty Spaces: Decolonization in Italy,” in A Place in the Sun: Africa in Italian Colonial Culture from Post-Unification to the Present, ed. Patrizia Palumbo (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 299–320. The use of Pouillon’s designs in Battle suggest to me an awareness of the Antonioni model (Battle also contains a telling allusion to Red Desert, 1964). Once again, this strongly suggests that Battle is also a film on the consequences and legacy of the Italian colonial experience.\n\n36. Fernand Pouillon, Mémoires d’un architecte (Paris: Seuil, 1968), 205. If my conversations with artists and others in Algiers are an indication, both Chevallier and Pouillon are recalled with a certain sympathy and admiration. Diar Es-Saada, Pouillon’s first housing project in Algiers (intended solely for Europeans), came to be pictured on a bank note issued by the new Algerian state in 1964. See Crane, “Architecture at the Ends of Empire,” 117–19.\n\n37. See Djiar, “Politics and Housing in 1950s French Algiers.”\n\n38. See Shiela Crane, “On the Edge: The Internal Frontiers of Architecture in Algiers/Marseille,” Journal of Architecture 16:6 (2011): 941–73. Crane writes: “Evolutionary housing was built on the universalist assumption that all French subjects could become French citizens, even though the very notion of the ‘évolué’ paradoxically fixed a rigid hierarchy defined by racial difference” (963).\n\n39. Walking around the Climat de France with my camera on a visit to Algiers in December 2015 I was shouted at in Arabic by a group of local kids: “Built by the French, lived in by Algerians, photographed by foreigners.” My sincere thanks to Algerian artist Amina Menia for showing me around the Pouillon developments.\n\n40. There are no doors in the exterior walls of the 200 Columns—only windows, flights of stairs, and monumental entrances to the courtyard; there is no individual access to apartments from the outside of the building.\n\n41.

Ruedy writes of the official FLN attitude to Algerian national identity furthermore that the FLN’s “credo reflected in broad terms a sense of cultural identity shared by a great majority of Algerians. But it left unsaid the ways in which each of its statements was true.…Did the Algerian fatherland have room for non-Arabs? For non-Muslims?”\n\n48. Bhabha, Location of Culture, 38.\n\n49.

I have in mind the “logic of supplementarity” described by Jacques Derrida (an Algerian Jew) in his discussions of Kant and Rousseau. See Niall Lucy, A Derrida Dictionary (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004), 135–41. Vincendeau talks of the banlieue in French cinema as “a borderline, heterogenous space that is neither town nor country, and in some cases deserves to be called a no man’s land.” Vincendeau, La Haine, 22.\n\n56. Vincendeau writes that the five-minute opening sequence of La Haine is distilled from dozens of hours of newsreel footage, though she notes that the opening and grainiest images of a young man shouting at police are likely to have been created for the film since they feature synchronized sound. Vincendeau, La Haine, 46.\n\n57. The images of the dancing women that close Battle recall Eugène Delacroix’s picturing of Marianne in the 1830 painting “Liberty Leading the People,” as well as the running Pina, the female protagonist of Rome Open City, in her famous death scene in Rosselini’s film. Plainly, the realistic register of Battle is discarded for a traditional symbolism in these closing scenes, even as the resemblance to newsreel is retained in the coarse editing, use of long lens, and grainy film stock. (Pontecorvo himself worried about the breaking of the realistic illusion; see Solinas, Gillo Pontecorvo’s “The Battle of Algiers,” 174.) But the images also recall sensual Orientalist imagery, for example paintings of harem dancers by the Italian Orientalist painter Giulio Rosati, and the dancers’ play with flags and veils recalls Orientalist portrayals of Salomé.\n\n58.
