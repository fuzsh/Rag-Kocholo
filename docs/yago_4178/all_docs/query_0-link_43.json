He lives in an old village presbytery, south of Paris, which has been converted into a functional dwelling. Inside, the de´cor is not ostentatiously old-fashioned, and there is a large television set in the living room. The staircase positioned in the centre of the house leads to the room at the top. Sheaves of paper, thick like parchment, and a bulbous-shafted antique fountain pen crowd the surface of the single desk, prominently placed half way along the wall opposite the doorway. The room should be expansive; square-shaped, it covers the full surface area of the house. However, the desk and its accoutrements, the writing lamp and the chair, are cocooned in the uniform, dark pine of the ﬂoor, walls and ceiling. There is no word processor or computer screen anywhere to be seen. As the humble guest ventures the words, ‘C¸a fait un peu le genre Proust’, the writer, with a characteristically dramatic gesture, and impeccable timing, ﬂings open the shutters by the desk, and the green sweep of the Valle´e de Chevreuse, with its pockets of trees and narrow lanes weaving in and out of the meadows like dollar signs, ﬂoods the ﬁeld of vision. Tournier has operated what Marcus Hester, writing on the nature of metaphorical insight, terms the ‘gestalt switch’,1 a device that transforms the world in which the protagonist exists in the absence of any permanent alteration of its sensible features. In this case it is a trick of the light caused by the sudden opening of the shutters. Its eﬀect is one of spectacular agrandissement, but it is not a simple trompe-l’oeil, for the eye has already been deceived as to the proportions of the writer’s den. Over the years Tournier has brought his readers to a multitude of transitional viewpoints such as this. His work has been understood by some as a vehicle for diﬀerent ideas about society based on the durability of mythical archetypes, deconstructed by others into a myriad of quotations from other texts near and far-gone. The literary deconstructor, in his ceaseless unscrambling, goes backwards to a time before the text has been put together, whereas the literary sociologist ix\n\nx\n\nMichel Tournier\n\npicks and chooses some time after, and from a well-established corpus of references. All literary commentators are a blend of these two ﬁgures. However, Tournier aims to activate what may be nefariously described as the pleasure of reading; thus he is guided by the illusory ideal of an eternal ‘reading’ present. His narrative inscribes the ﬂight of the vampire,2 homing in unerringly on its target, which is the experience of the reader.3 He sees the relationship with his readers as a form of sacred communion and worries about the baleful inﬂuence of profaners (who are likely to be journalists). He wishes for a genuinely reciprocal arrangement. Once someone has accepted Tournier into his or her world, then elements of this reader’s world should ﬂow back and somehow inﬁltrate Tournier’s. This has less to do with interpretation and the open text; it is more about the way and context in which literature is read. It talks of the impact of prose narrative, of initial reactions that are often submerged in the ebb and ﬂow of considered critical debate. Reality, in Tournier’s eyes, is an objective, material entity rather than the interaction of conﬂictual discourses. This metaphysical gamble is most clearly seen in his attitude to language, which recalls Tom Stoppard’s metaphor of the cricket bat.4 Language is an instrument that can be used by the writer to express a diversity of ideas and perceptions, just as the bat is employed by the batsman in a variety of diﬀerent strokes. Thus, in Tournier’s writing there is no sense of a genuinely postmodern insecurity about language and how it signiﬁes meaning. On the contrary, he glories in the range of communicative possibilities aﬀorded by the French language, which he sees as inﬁnitely richer than the televisual or the cinematic image. For example, the pun is eulogised because it brings to the fore two diﬀerent meanings at the same time and not because it casts doubt on one or both of the meanings expressed or on the integrity of language as a vehicle of communication.5 The pun is thus seen as a ﬁgure which ampliﬁes knowledge rather than fractures meaning. This distinction is an important one, for throughout his work Tournier has constantly endeavoured to overcome negative dialectics which are seen as threats to positive unifying forces. It has been and still is unfashionable to use words such as ‘reality’ and ‘the real’ in a positive sense. However, George Steiner is the most notable of a number of cultural critics formerly associated with the structuralist movement of the 1950s and 1960s who now argue that we must retain the capacity to read as if the text before us ‘incarnates a real\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\npresence of signiﬁcant being’.6 Steiner is worried about the pressures exerted by modish, though philosophically irrefutable, critical practice over our appreciation of great Art. Irritated by the ‘autistic echo chambers of deconstruction’,7 he evokes the silent joy of the Talmudic scholar who participates in a ‘ceremony of intellect’. The rhetoric is no accident, for his argument culminates in an appeal to Art as a form of communion between the artist and his solitary interlocutor which lies beyond language: To be ‘indwelt’ by music, art, literature, to be made responsible, answerable to such habitation as a host is to a guest . . . is to experience the commonplace mystery of a real presence. Not many of us feel compelled to, have the expressive means to, register the mastering quality of this experience—as does Proust when he crystallises the sense of the world and of the word in the little yellow spot which is the real presence of a riverside door in Vermeer’s View of Delft, or as does Thomas Mann when he enacts in word and metaphor the coming over us, the ‘overcoming of us’, in Beethoven’s Opus 111. No matter. The experience itself is one we are thoroughly at home with—an informing idiom—each and every time we live a text, a sonata, a painting.8\n\nThe notion of a textual reality and the implied existence of a dialogue between author and reader are, though the latter may be more of a Platonic Ideal than a reality, crucial to Tournier’s enterprise. Each of his titles designates a scenario, and each scenario solicits a metaphorical statement whereby Tournier articulates a vision of the world which is not literally real, but, to the extent that he consciously engages with what he anticipates to be the deep-seated desires and fears of his readership, may well be metaphorically true. As the series of haunting photographs he assembled for an exhibition of photography at the Muse´e d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris testify,9 he is interested in the way that artists invest what is already there with something more. Tournier likes to put on a show. Confronted with a bullish reader, he feints like a matador; however, if we are prepared to take him more often at his word, he will lead us to the literary equivalent of the alchemist’s laboratory.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction Metaphor used to belong to poetry. As a trope or ﬁgure, its scope in prose narrative is traditionally limited to an aspect of style. In a recent empirical study Gerard Steen sets out to prove that this commonly-held perception is misguided. In one of the tests devised by Steen a team of language experts were presented with a 25-line extract from Norman Mailer’s Miami and the Siege of Chicago and asked to identify and isolate examples of metaphor. They agreed on nineteen cases.1 That there should be such a concentration of metaphors in any small text, let alone one written by a well-known literary star, should no longer be regarded as exceptional, for an increasing number of language specialists are moving towards the view articulated by the two scholars cited in the introduction to Steen’s study who speak of metaphor as being situated in the ‘deepest and most general processes of human interaction with reality’.2 Current research driven by the work of Ortony, Lakoﬀ and Johnson, and Dirven and Paprotte´ aims to investigate what the metaphorical basis of language reveals about the cognitive capacities of the human mind. However, just as interest in the workings of metaphor has extended far beyond the domain of literature, so the literary text has lost its privileged status as the site of metaphorical meaning. Literature is not an habitual mode of expression, therefore literary language is less interesting to researchers absorbed by the question of how we organise the reality around us than recorded speech, or even standard journalists’ reports. Thus, in metaphor studies literature has been sidelined. This general obliviousness may explain in part why comparatively few literary commentators have tapped into the rich fund of material resulting from the explosion in ‘metaphorology’ of the last twenty or so years.3 Living at the end of the twentieth century, we are accustomed to contrast literary ﬁction as genre with documentary fact. This is a relatively recent development predicated on an assumption which is not always reliable. Stein Haugom Olsen cites writers as disparate in style, 1\n\n2\n\nMichel Tournier\n\ncontent and epoch as Richardson, Henry James and Malcolm Bradbury, all of whom refute the idea that literature, and in particular the novel, should be read as ﬁction.4 Witness Henry James, insisting in The Art of Fiction that ‘the novel is history’. He lambasts Trollope for conceding to the reader that he and ‘this trusting friend’ are only ‘making believe’. This seems to James a ‘terrible crime’,5 and yet the distinction between history, journalism and biography on the one hand, and ﬁction on the other is a basic ingredient in the conceptual diet of literary critics and reviewers alike. How do we read the work of writers who are either oblivious to this tension, or happy to absorb it? In many literatures, the modern American novel for example, the application of the fact/ ﬁction dialectic yields precious little insight; writers such as Saul Bellow, Truman Capote, Don Delillo, John Updike even, seem unconcerned as to the ﬁctive character of their ﬁction, to the extent that those who can tolerate horrendous neologisms have begun to talk of a new genre called ‘literary faction’. However, the conspicuous strain of self-consciousness in modern European literature, where the reader is frequently made aware of the ﬁctional identity of the work and of the distinction between narrator and author, has coincided with a theoretical appropriation of metaphor. In competition with a host of other interesting concepts and approaches, metaphor seems to have lost the privileges it once enjoyed when it was venerated by the Romantics, and upheld subsequently in the thinking of Proust and Vale´ry. Modern literary theory has circumscribed metaphor by taking it out of the speculative domain of thought and identifying it as a ﬁgure of speech associated with a fundamental tenet in modern linguistics. The principle at issue, which has its source in Saussure’s exposition of language as a synchronic phenomenon, states that language is generated from our ability as human beings to discriminate between various paradigms. This skill derives from a perceptual faculty by which we diﬀerentiate between things or phenomena on the grounds of similarity and contrast. In the discourse of literary theorists, ‘metaphor’ is sometimes used to qualify this process of paradigmatic selection. The ﬁgure of metonymy is correspondingly elevated, to illustrate what Saussure termed the ‘rapports syntagmatiques’ of our language.6 Metaphor and metonymy are henceforth apposite ﬁgures, presiding over the dual process of selection and combination in which language is produced. Much of the theory involved in modern poetics resides in this distinction, between the syntagm and the paradigm, and the alternating modes, deﬁned as metonymy and metaphor, in which they are ‘ﬁgured’.\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n3\n\nIn preparing the ground for a discussion of Tournier’s ﬁction from a metaphorical perspective, my intention has been to create a narrative which is applicable to Tournier’s ﬁctional project and may also make a modest contribution to current thinking about the role and value of literature in today’s society. In this perspective the restrictions imposed on metaphor by the poststructuralist view of the ﬁgure as limited to an analysable feature of language need to be lifted, for my argument is rooted in the presupposition that the study of metaphor helps considerably in the evolution of a theory of the imagination. Once the theory is in place, new avenues are opened on a number of questions which have been highlighted and debated in discussions of Tournier’s work, notably the respective roles of author and reader in the literary construction of meaning, the value of thematic studies in a postmodern era, and the possibility that, at this self-same moment when cultural values are seen as relative, aesthetic judgements may still be validated. An introduction to the history of metaphor will be followed by three case studies, the function of which is to ground more securely my readings of Tournier’s ﬁction. These are Paul Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor as imagination, developed by Ricoeur as a form of readerly response to the ‘phenomenon’ of narrative ﬁction; Jean Ricardou’s less systematic, though recurrently illuminating writing on the all-pervasiveness of metaphor in both literary and non-literary discourse; and ﬁnally George Lakoﬀ and Mark Johnson’s universalist theory of metaphor as the primary organiser, the one and only conceptual agent at work as the human being constantly situates and resituates itself in relation to the world around it. Lakoﬀ and Johnson advocate the abolition of boundaries between discourses seen in terms of the literal and the metaphorical. This radical departure from the empiricist norm adumbrates much of the discussion on the value of literary ﬁction to society at large, for if metaphor is seen as not only blurring but conspiring actively to break down literary distinctions between reality, truth and ﬁction, it will be doing so in the interests of clearing the paths of communication between the novelist and his readership, paths which have become, in the postmodern age, rather overgrown. The discussion is balanced on a knife-edge, between the aesthetic and the sociological dimensions of the literary process. A literature which constantly reaﬃrms its status as ﬁction will distance itself from the ‘real world’ inﬂuences which shape the responses of its readers. If literature has become too self-conscious, too abstract, too far removed from the perceptions of its audience, it is axiomatic that\n\n4\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nliterary aesthetics will have followed suit. If we have reached a point where the novel is too often a foil for the illustration of a theoretical concept, there may be a heavy price to pay. In its drift from the democratic to the esoteric, what value does the novel as an art form have to society as a whole? Tournier has always sought to reach a wide audience. At a time during the late 1960s and early 1970s when advocates and exponents of experimental art and literature were in the ascendancy in France, he was writing novels that ﬂesh out the clear, uncompromising objective to be announced later in Le Vent Paraclet, the ﬁrst and by far the largest of his many autobiographically-tinged essays: ‘Mon propos n’est pas d’innover dans la forme, mais de faire passer au contraire dans une forme aussi traditionnelle, pre´serve´e et rassurante que possible une matie`re ne posse´dant aucune de ces qualite´s’ (VP, 190). For Tournier, provocation presupposes intelligibility. He is a messenger. He is also, ﬁrst and foremost, a philosopher: ‘Mon seul proble`me litte´raire est donc d’ordre pe´dagogique: comment rendre claires et agre´ables ces choses subtiles et diﬃciles que j’ai a` dire’.7 The well-documented switch, prompted by his failing the agre´gation in 1949, from a career teaching philosophy to an eventual niche in the literary world failed to dampen Tournier’s early passion for philosophy. On the contrary he was to see the potential for a far wider dissemination of philosophical ideas and arguments in the form of ﬁctional narratives than could be achieved, even in France, through the more conventional channels of philosophical discourse. This self-image, reﬂecting hues of Rabelais, La Fontaine, Voltaire and Diderot, is perhaps one reason why Tournier is still described as the most traditional of contemporary French novelists. And in many ways he is. He is also a radical for all times. Few if any writers over the ages have pursued a policy of cultural democratisation through their art as far as Tournier, who has consistently claimed that his novels and short stories should be read as productively by children as by adults. To this end, Vendredi ou La vie sauvage was published in 1971 as a ‘corrective’ to his ﬁrst novel, Vendredi ou Les limbes du Paciﬁque, and in 1983 Les Rois Mages—a rewriting of his fourth, Gaspard, Melchior, et Balthazar—appeared. Both these rewritten texts are characterised by the suppression or alteration of key episodes in the original novels, a more direct form of narration, and a simpliﬁed rhetorical structure. However, in spite of these ‘improvements’, the original novels were not withdrawn from circulation. Having analysed the speciﬁc character of the self-censorship in Vendredi ou La vie\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n5\n\nsauvage, Ge´rard Genette concludes that through his rewriting enterprise Tournier has abdicated artistic integrity in favour of personal proﬁt: ‘Je suis seul devant ce texte, et pourtant je me sens deux: l’enfant qu’il vise et l’adulte qu’il atteint. D’ou` j’infe`re qu’il louche.’8 Vendredi ou La vie sauvage is Tournier’s best-selling book. Recently it has topped the three million mark for sales in France alone. The idea of a child-friendly literary style goes to the heart of Tournier’s ﬁctional project. Baﬄed academics point to the thesaurus of cultural references embedded in his oeuvre, a cleverly constructed intertext existing on a scale unmatched in the ﬁction of any other modern writer which is designed to activate a knowledge and experience that a child reader could scarcely be expected to possess. Until recently little attention has been paid to some of the author’s declarations in this respect: that he would have sacriﬁced his life’s work in order to have created Hans Christian Andersen’s The Snow Queen (VP, 48); that the simple, ‘childish’ contes, ‘Amandine ou Les deux jardins’ and ‘Pierrot ou Les secrets de la nuit’, constitute the summit of his literary achievement;9 that his ﬁfth novel, La Goutte d’or, was (with the exception of one or two abstract pages on the art of calligraphy) explicitly written so as to be read as proﬁtably by children of ten as by adults.10 Tournier aﬁcionados may have recognised in these proclamations his weakness for hyperbole and taste for the melodramatic and chosen quietly to ignore them. However, in the course of a table ronde discussion published as part of the proceedings of the 1990 conference on Tournier held at Ce´risy-la-Salle, the author took the opportunity to provide a trenchant restatement of his position. Asked about his wish to rewrite his second novel, Le Roi des aulnes, so as to make it a more appropriate read for children, he replied in the following terms: Ce que je voudrais faire, c’est re´e´crire Le Roi des aulnes de´pouille´ de tout un fatras qui l’encombre . . . tout ce qui n’est pas essentiel a` l’action. J’aimerais fournir du roman une e´pure qui pourrait eˆtre illustre´e et que les enfants pourraient lire, ce qui ne signiﬁe pas que cette version aurait e´te´ e´crite pour eux. Ce serait une version ame´liore´e, et tellement ame´liore´e que les enfants y trouveraient leur paˆture alors que, dans l’e´tat actuel des choses, je ne pense pas qu’on puisse le lire avant quinze ans.11\n\nAs his literary career has ﬂourished, Tournier has retained a visible proﬁle in the world of education. He regularly visits French schools, particularly the colle`ges (intermediary or high schools), where he reads his stories before classes of attentive listeners. It would appear that he sees in these children troops of mini Socrates, a most rigorous audience\n\n6\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nbecause the need to question and the will to discover are at that time of life, prior to the onset of puberty, at their most acute. ‘Angus’, one of the short stories in Le Me´dianoche amoureux, is, so Tournier reveals in a postface, a narrative that takes as its starting-point unanswered questions arising from the plot of Victor Hugo’s L’Aigle du casque, questions which should puzzle any reader who approaches the Hugo text with a child-like inquisitiveness (MA, 256–57). It is tempting to read Tournier’s child-centred narrative policy as a logical reﬁnement of the reasoning behind his original choice to deal in myths. Myths are sacred, eternal stories, often exchanged in nonwestern societies as part of initiation rites. In the context of western civilisation Tournier revealingly talks of myth as the ‘enfance de la litte´rature’.12 In Le Vent Paraclet he explains their attraction with reference to Plato’s ‘Allegory of the Cave’, which can be read simply as a children’s story, ‘la description d’un guignol qui serait aussi the´aˆtre d’ombres chinoises’ (VP, 188) but can also be elevated to a theory of knowledge, and higher still, to the status of an ethical, ontological treatise, without the original story having changed. Tournier has become ever more adroit in the way that he addresses two audiences ‘in one go’: the sophisticated adult cognoscenti, and younger minds unencumbered with the chores of the everyday and uncluttered by the cultural junk of intellectuals. Still, the diﬃculties encountered by Tournier readers, especially problems raised by the rewriting enterprise, are not easily whisked away. In his excellent book Martin Roberts advises a benignly cautious approach to the issue. Roberts accepts that Tournier is constantly rewriting his own and others’ material to the extent that artistic creation for this writer is not strictly about inventing plots, characters and scenarios; rather it deﬁnes a process of re-invention. Like the thieving magpie he professes to be,13 Tournier picks up on stories, ideas, themes, and conceits that have been used elsewhere and recycles them in diﬀerent combinations. Thus, Roberts argues, he is a literary ‘bricoleur’. Moreover, as his career has gone on, Tournier’s ‘bricolage’ has been leavened with a fair dose of ‘autobricolage’. This latter tendency denotes neither vanity nor paranoia, instead a recognition on the part of the author that he is imbricated in a concomitant process of change and repetition. Tournier’s instincts as a bricoleur are thus revealed towards the end of Roberts’ study as an artistic fascination with the relationship between the model and the copy, and, more precisely, with the potential activated by the copy to change the way in which the model is perceived.14 In the\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n7\n\nspeciﬁc context of the child-oriented rewritings however, the author does what he conspicuously avoids doing in his own literary discourse, which is to supply a clear value judgement in favour of the copy. As Roberts says, it would be nice to be able to judge Les Rois Mages as a text ‘in its own right’, but, given that it has mutated from an earlier, still widely available text, this is precisely ‘what we cannot do’.15 With the publication of works such as Vendredi ou La vie sauvage and Les Rois Mages, the keen Tournier reader is presented with the literary equivalent of a cleft stick. Tainted forever by his knowledge of the father-text, it is impossible for him to approach the new version with an open mind. The world of Tournier’s ﬁction is quite literally left to the young. Although initially it skirts the periphery of my argument, the debate about Tournier’s children narratives will eventually ﬁnd its way to the core. As Michael Worton pointed out in the discussion at Ce´risy, the child is in itself an unassailable concept—where does childhood end and adulthood begin? However, Tournier’s express desire to jettison the ‘fatras’ raises the less child-speciﬁc idea of the search for a more eﬀective form of literary communication. And it is in the conjunction between the writer’s world-view and the world-view of his projected reader—and that projection embraces both the sophisticated adult and the child of reasonable reading age—that metaphor plays a vital role.\n\nMETAPHOR: TRADITIONS AND MOVEMENTS Professional metaphor-spotters, the sort of specialist literary critic or psycholinguist who would have participated in Steen’s research, may not all have realised quite how far this standard trope has travelled. Metaphor is a key concept in such far-ﬂung scholarly territories as theoretical physics, theology, psychoanalysis and the cognitive sciences, its interdisciplinarity an immediate clue to what a small amount of preliminary research on the subject should reveal: that scholars have very diﬀerent ideas about what exactly metaphor is. Even within its traditional stamping-grounds of philosophy, linguistics and literary study, metaphor divides opinions sharply. In broad terms our understanding has evolved via two epistemological traditions: the Continental or European tradition, and the Anglo-Saxon/American tradition. The European tradition reactivates Aristotle’s original identiﬁcation\n\n8\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nof the concept in the modern context of linguistics and literary theory. Aristotle describes metaphor as ‘consisting in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else; the transference being either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy’ (Poetics, 1457b).16 This would indicate that he understood it primarily as a linguistic operation, a nominalist transgression involving the substitution of what is normally held to be a literal referent with a ‘ﬁgurative’ replacement. The linkage of Aristotle with Saussurian linguistics is not immediately evident, not least because according to Saussure there could be no such thing as a ‘ﬁgurative replacement’. Fundamental to Saussure’s most inﬂuential teachings— those sections of the Cours which promote an exclusively synchronic linguistics—is his assertion that the linguistic unit contains no semantic value in itself. It may gain semantic value, but only when it becomes a sign, when it is included in the physical manifestation of langue as parole, in the form of speech or writing. Thus the eﬀect of Saussure has been to distil Aristotle’s original deﬁnition of metaphor, which is now frequently understood as the transposition of names, or as Lacan surmises with minimalist clarity, ‘un mot pour un autre’.17 The connection between metaphor and language is explicitly made by the Formalist critic and linguist, Roman Jakobson, who argues that metaphor and metonymy are two fundamental principles guiding the formation of all discourse. Jakobson’s thinking on metaphor evolved through a series of papers on the topic of aphasia, or speech malfunction, that derive in part from psycho-linguistic experiments.18 He conceives of metaphor as one element of a dialectic, of which the other is metonymy. Together they form a polar coupling that governs certain patterns of speech. In these classical ﬁgures he observes ‘the most condensed expression of the two basic modes of relation: the internal relation of similarity (and contrast) underlies the metaphor; the external relation of contiguity (and remoteness) determines the metonymy’.19 Jakobson argues, from the evidence of some bread-and-butter tests on the language acquisition of children, that two distinct kinds of aphasia correspond to these metaphorical and metonymic relations. In the one kind a speaker ﬁnds it diﬃcult to substitute for a given word others which have similar or contrasted meanings (e.g. ‘bubbly’ for ‘champagne’). He insists instead on substituting words connected through ‘contiguity’ relations (e.g. ‘bottle’ or ‘hangover’). Hence, says Jakobson, only ‘metonymy is used and grasped by him’. With the other kind of aphasia the speaker’s diﬃculty is the reverse: she or he can only\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n9\n\nsubstitute words related by similarity or contrast of meaning. Their respective inabilities to produce the ﬁgures of either metaphor or metonymy identify these two aspects of aphasia. In a second, widely acclaimed paper, Jakobson develops his argument, blending his notion of metaphorical and metonymic speech deﬁciencies into the mainstream of Saussurean linguistics. To reiterate, one of Saussure’s most durable claims is that the transition from langue to parole eﬀected by the utterance of a sentence requires two axes, or modes of arrangement of linguistic items. There must be a paradigmatic axis of related words from which the speaker selects for insertion into the sentence. And he must be able to string the words available for selection along a linear or syntagmatic axis. Jakobson reasons that the two kinds of aphasic are distinguished by their inability to perform adequately in either one of these two ‘modes of arrangement’. Those with a problem of ‘paradigmatic selection’ are held to be deﬁcient in metaphoric substitution based on similarity or contrast of meaning. Those who have a problem combining terms along the syntagmatic axis are held to be deﬁcient in metonymic association. Proﬁting from his work on speech disorders, Jakobson then applies the same principles (of similarity and contiguity) to speech construction. He writes: The development of a discourse may take place along two different semantic lines: one topic may lead to another either through their similarity or through their contiguity. The metaphoric way would be the most appropriate term for the ﬁrst case and the metonymic way for the second, since they ﬁnd their most condensed expression in metaphor and metonymy respectively.20\n\nIn support of this argument Jakobson describes the most rudimentary of practical situations, in which one person talking about a hut may proceed to talk metaphorically about dens or cottages, while another may go on to talk metonymically about thatching, poverty, or wild animals. Although his ideas were challenged by Stephen Ullmann,21 and later more robustly by the philosopher David Cooper—who has shown that the dual category system of metaphor and metonymy is far from stable22—Jakobson’s unequivocal statement on the active roles of metaphor and metonymy in the production of discourse has founded the majority of semantic interpretations of Saussure since the publication of his papers. The most seductive theory of metaphor as a purely linguistic phenomenon is provided by the famous psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan. My earlier elision of Lacan’s deceptively simple ‘one name for another’ formula with Aristotle’s original deﬁnition of metaphor is peremptory;\n\n10\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nthe fuller version of Lacan’s deﬁnition integrates Jakobson’s metaphor—metonymy polarity into a psychoanalyical context, entailing some interesting modiﬁcations: L’e´tincelle cre´atrice de la me´taphore ne jaillit pas de la mise en pre´sence de deux images, c’est-a`-dire de deux signiﬁants e´galement actualise´s. Elle jaillit entre deux signiﬁants dont l’un s’est substitue´ a` l’autre en prenant sa place dans la chaıˆ ne signiﬁante, le signiﬁant occulte´ restant pre´sent de sa connexion (me´tonymique) au reste de la chaıˆ ne.23\n\nIn this essay Lacan advocates the classiﬁcation of the mechanisms of the unconscious as ‘ﬁgures of style’, and as tropes. Many people ﬁnd his lexicon abstruse, and suspiciously mystifying. This is because he attempts to show what others pass over, namely the means by which purely symbolic phenomena—those that dominate dreams or neuroses—come into relation with language. Preempting Kristeva,24 he identiﬁes Freud’s key concepts of condensation and displacement with the ﬁgures of metaphor and metonymy respectively. In both The Interpretation of Dreams, and its abridged version ‘On Dreams’, Freud attempts to describe the speciﬁc nature of dream images.25 He remarks that dreams consist of several strong, spotlighted (and therefore remembered) images, which tend to recur in the subject’s other dreams, and occasionally in the dreams of other people. These images appear to have symbolic meaning. Freud termed the coming-together of these symbolic images in the unconscious mind of the sleeping subject condensation; the need for interpretation springs from the fact that these symbols have been displaced from the context in which they normally feature, which is the conscious mind of the subject. Condensation and displacement govern one synchronous process, which allows us to dream. Once the essence of Freud’s interpretation of dreams is abstracted, we can see how neatly it ﬁts Lacan’s linguistic model. In Lacan’s deﬁnition, metaphor governs the instance when one signiﬁer is substituted for another. This is a conscious deformation of the metonymic chain of signiﬁcation, recognisable as such because, for an utterance to be understood as metaphorical, the proper mode of discourse (which Lacan claims is fundamentally metonymic) must remain perceptible. Metaphor is therefore the presence in discourse of the normally absent work of selection, the unusual showing or manifestation in the living language of the paradigmatic function, the workings of which are accentuated in the sub-conscious phenomenon of dream language. Although Lacan’s schema is persuasive, there are good reasons that\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n11\n\nmilitate against the useful appropriation of a Lacanian concept of metaphor by the reader of literary narratives. David Macey has emphasised the inconsistencies that become evident when Lacan’s formula is read alongside his other ‘tropological’ utterances. Macey points out that, four years earlier, in ‘Fonction et champ de la parole et du langage en psychanalyse’, metonymy is classiﬁed with metaphor under the heading, ‘semantic condensations’.26 He goes on to expose other discrepancies, on the evidence of which, he argues, the metaphor—condensation and metonymy—displacement equation, generally considered an integral part of Lacanian linguistics, rests upon unstable foundations. Moreover, notwithstanding the far-reaching connotations integral to Lacan’s conception of metaphor as the ﬁgure of Freudian repression, Macey is suﬃciently worried about its denotative aspect. Taking Lacan’s habitual example, Victor Hugo’s line— sa gerbe n’e´tait point avare, ni haineuse—he eﬀectively deconstructs it, in order to demonstrate how Lacanian metaphor works, ‘thanks to the suppression of its context and to a very cavalier use of elements of poetics’.27 Macey’s counter-analysis of Hugo’s metaphor, which draws on a context derived from both the text in which it features, the poem Booz endormi, and the history of that text in terms of its reception and of its place in the Hugo oeuvre, and thus ventures outside the world of psychoanalysis, illuminates the conundrum in which the supporter of a Lacanian reading of metaphor will ﬁnd himself. Although Lacan has brought the activity of rhetoric to the forefront of the system, his ﬁgures are destined always to reveal a law of psychoanalysis—the dominant or master trope, the ﬁgure of the Father, or in Lacan’s case, the ‘nom du Pe`re’. The reader will, therefore, always be constrained by this speciﬁc set of symbols. Reading Lacan demands that one accepts the truth of psychoanalysis, which is in itself a form of blind assent. Other structuralist and post-structuralist thinkers such as Tzvetan Todorov and Paul Ricoeur, and latter-day rhetoricians such as Brian Vickers and Chaim Perelman take a diﬀerent approach to the topic of metaphor. They too claim Aristotle for their own by situating metaphor as part of a general rhetorical praxis. Todorov argues that Aristotle’s deﬁnition of rhetoric as the ‘faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion’ (Rhetoric, 1355b) has been adopted with a degree of complacency. According to Todorov, Aristotle meant by this much more than the idea that rhetoric targets eloquence or good style; he was referring to the composition of eﬀective\n\n12\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nspeech that makes it possible to act on others. Thus, the rhetoric of the Ancients saw language at its most dynamic: La rhe´torique ne saisit pas le langage comme forme—elle ne se pre´occupe pas de l’e´nonce´ en tant que tel—mais le langage comme action; la forme linguistique devient l’ingre´dient d’un acte global de communication (dont la persuasion est l’espe`ce la plus caracte´ristique). C’est sur les fonctions de la parole, non sur sa structure, que s’interroge la rhe´torique. L’e´le´ment constant est l’objectif a` atteindre: persuader (ou, comme on dira plus tard, instruire, toucher et plaire); les moyens linguistiques sont pris en conside´ration dans la mesure ou` ils peuvent servir a` atteindre cet objectif.28\n\nIn classical terms, therefore, rhetoric covers the various forms of functional speech at work in a predominantly oral culture. As Todorov reads Tacitus, rhetoric is situated at the very heart of things, in the formation and practice of government. It is the dynamic principle informing what we now understand as democracy.29 Ricoeur attempts to deduce the rationale behind Aristotle’s persistent deﬁnition of rhetoric in terms of the art of persuasion. Given that rhetoric controls the speaker’s means of persuasion, then the language of rhetoric must be its praxis, the public manifestation of the word, a forum engendering the speciﬁc use of a language which is, however, removed from the stipulated exactitude of the philosopher’s text. Aristotle’s genius (to Ricoeur’s way of thinking) was to insist that rhetorical praxis be contingent on the philosophical notion of vraisemblance, in that the public speaker, seeking to convince his audience of the truth of what he is saying, must appear authentic. Similarly, in the Poetics literary language is deﬁned in accordance with its mimetic function, ‘sa vise´e est de composer une repre´sentation essentielle des actions humaines; son mode propre est de dire la ve´rite´ par le moyen de la ﬁction, de la fable, du mythos tragique’.30 Ricoeur proposes a discursive triad, rhe´torique—preuve—persuasion, which is clearly distinct from the poesis—mimesis—catharsis series exclusive to the functioning of literary language. However, situated at the face of this diﬀerence is the unique structure of metaphor, which, unlike other classiﬁed tropes and ﬁgures, entertains the possibility of the transference of the meaning of words. Hence, Ricoeur argues, metaphor facilitates the interaction of diﬀerent spheres of discourse. It is unique precisely because it has a dual function, being both rhetorical and poetic. Metaphor essentially conveys vraisemblance, whether through oral or literary discourse. Ricoeur and Todorov emphasise the illocutionary force of the metaphorical act. They stress the importance of persuading an audience\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n13\n\nto think that the metaphorical substitute for the literal referent of Aristotle’s equation is plausible, that it should be taken as some kind of truth or spur to action. They espouse a revival of the rhetorician’s art, as a means of restoring a lost vitality to contemporary discourse. This need for an energising rhetoric of persuasion conjures up the anachronistic ﬁgure of the orator. It demands the virtuosity of an oral culture, a facility for oral discourse which may seem inappropriate in an intellectual climate dominated by the written word and a general culture seemingly in thrall to the image, or computer graphic. However, scholars like Perelman are unambiguous in their call for a return to the study of rhetoric as a necessary, applicable discipline: . . . toute argumentation se de´veloppe en fonction d’un auditoire et . . . le ‘vraisemblable’ dont il est question dans les raisonnements dialectiques doit eˆtre conc¸u comme l’acceptable, le raisonnable qui ne peut eˆtre de´ﬁni a` l’aide de crite`res impersonnels, inde´pendants des esprits qui le jugent (. . .) Les ﬁgures de rhe´torique ne doivent plus eˆtre e´tudie´es isole´ment, en dehors de leur contexte, en n’examinant que leur structure, mais doivent eˆtre envisage´es en fonction de leur action sur l’auditoire.31\n\nAlthough both camps—formalists and rhetoricians—tend to pull in diﬀerent directions, they are united to the extent that they see metaphor principally as a feature of language. They have developed theories which are anchored, initially, by readings of Aristotle and then ﬁltered through or modiﬁed by the injunctions of Saussure. Now Saussure’s ideas were revolutionary, in that he dispelled the concretist perception of language as nomenclature, as a set of name-tags given to each and every pre-existing object in the natural world. Instead Saussure asks us to think not in terms of what appears to be there, but in terms of how we recognise what is there, and then of how we process this information. Consider this passage from the Cours: Le signe linguistique unit non une chose et un nom, mais un concept et une image acoustique. Cette dernie`re n’est pas le son mate´riel, chose purement physique, mais l’empreinte psychique de ce son, la repre´sentation que nous en donne le te´moignage de nos sens.32\n\nThe emphasis on mental images, on the imaging structure of language, is both attractive and amenable to a theory of metaphor. However, Saussure’s conceptual apparatus of langue and parole appears to limit its usefulness. The process of selection and combination by which langue is manifested in parole implies that la langue can only be conceived as a repository of the individual’s pre-existing linguistic knowledge. It is a concept which takes no account of the dynamic\n\n14\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nprinciples of language bequeathed by classical rhetoric, nor does it allow for any notion of semantic innovation.33 In pragmatic terms the view of metaphor as nominal substition is even more limited. Consider the following examples given by David Cooper. The substitution view tout court takes no account of even the simplest of ‘active’ metaphors, such as ‘The ship ploughed the sea’, in which metaphorical intent centres on the verb rather than on the noun. The identiﬁcation of metaphor may also hinge on another grammatical constituent of the phrase, on an adverb or even on a preposition, as in the case of the ludicrous 1960s expression: ‘She’s into LSD’. As Cooper points out, ‘Did anybody ever confess to being ‘‘underneath LSD’’?’34 Another prerequisite for the substitution view of metaphor is the presumption that the metaphorical term substitutes for a literal term which is absent from the metaphorical expression, but available to be recaptured at will. Here again the generally accepted view is shown to be thoroughly inadequate. Resorting to Cooper again, we may wonder what Churchill actually meant when he described Mussolini as ‘that utensil!’? What would be the literal paraphrase of a metaphor like ‘Architecture is frozen music’, or Dostoievsky’s ‘Eternity is a spider in a Russian bath-house’? From these examples alone, it is clear that metaphor follows a diﬀerent ‘symbolic’ logic, in so far as it forces us to make comparisons which previously we may not have been able to perceive. Metaphor seeks to change perspectives on things, and therefore it is outward-looking, whereas Saussure holds that we grasp language as a set of internal relations. It also bears repeating that for Saussure language has no symbolic status—the linguistic sign can only refer to other linguistic signs. There remains the intriguing possibility that Saussure’s innovatory work on synchronic linguistics may have been misappropriated. A signiﬁcant feature of Saussure’s explication is the attribution of the syntagmatic order to parole—it is physically there, available to analysis—and of the paradigmatic order to langue. Therefore, Saussure relates the syntagm to a particular feature of a given language, whereas the paradigm has a universal application: Le rapport syntagmatique est in praesentia; il repose sur deux ou plusieurs termes e´galement pre´sents dans une se´rie effective. Au contraire le rapport associatif unit des termes in absentia dans une se´rie mne´monique virtuelle.35\n\nHe uses the example of a column, which exists in a certain physical relationship with the architrave that it supports. This structure, in\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n15\n\nwhich two unities are equally present in space, is the equivalent of a syntagmatic relation; however, if the column is Doric it will contrast with many other variants of column (Ionic, Corinthian, etc.), which are not present in space but which, nonetheless, constitute a paradigmatic or associative relation. In practice, the syntagmatic order describes the nuts and bolts of language, the mechanisms of phonology and grammar which are constantly reﬁned so that any given language continues to function eﬃciently. However, the syntagmatic order always cedes to, because it is always preceded by, the paradigmatic order, which, on account of the principle of identity and contrast, allows for the creation of language. Questions of meaning therefore revert to the speaker’s intention. If meaning is, as Austin initially claimed in How to do things with words, always the speaker’s utterance meaning, then language meaning, or semantics, belongs exclusively to the realm of the paradigm. One might even venture that Saussure’s concept of la langue is most easily and accurately apprehended as his perception of the fundamental human faculty by which we diﬀerentiate in terms of identity and contrast. Both metaphor and metonymy—if metonymy is a viable means of cognition, which is doubtful—arise initially, therefore, in the build-up to their expression in language, or discourse, in the mind of the individual speaker. Both are, or can be, assimilated to Saussure’s paradigmatic order; neither form part of the syntagmatic order. Of course, Saussure bequeathed the intractable problem of quite how the human being is able to string words together syntactically in such accomplished fashion to Noam Chomsky, whose theories have since revolutionised thinking on the nature of syntax. The prospect emerges that metaphor is not predominantly a fact of language. It is ﬁrst and foremost a means of cognition, and moreover, a cognitive process which is relayed through the imagination. Our capacity to see Jastrow’s diagram (famously borrowed by Wittgenstein) ﬁrstly as a duck, then as a rabbit (or vice versa) is a metaphorical function of the imagination.36 Once metaphor is freed from linguistic shackles and considered as a possible means of cognition, then it may play a more purposeful part in literary theory. The English literary critic, I. A. Richards, was the ﬁrst to speculate on the idea that metaphor represents an intrinsic conceptual faculty of the human mind. Richards saw metaphor neither as the substitute of a literal referent, nor as a comparison, but as the interaction of two thought-domains: ‘In the simplest formulation, when we use a metaphor we have two thoughts of diﬀerent things active together and\n\n16\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nsupported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a resultant of their interaction’.37 Metaphor no longer embraces the innovative combination of two units of language, it now relates to the interaction of two modes of thought. To illustrate his deﬁnition, Richards chooses the example, ‘The poor are the negroes of Europe’. Applied to this metaphor, the ‘substitution view’ tells us that something is being indirectly said about the poor of Europe, but we are not exactly sure what. The ‘comparison view’ claims that the epigram presents some comparison between the poor and the negroes. In opposition to both, Richards says that our ‘thoughts’ about European poor and American negroes are ‘active together’ and ‘interact’ to produce a meaning which is the resultant of that interaction. In the given context the focal word ‘negroes’ obtains a new meaning, which is not quite its meaning in literal uses, nor quite the meaning which any literal substitute would have. The new context imposes an extension of meaning upon the focal word, but, for the metaphor to work, the reader must remain aware of this extension of meaning; he must attend to both the old and new meanings together. The most far-reaching consequence of what has since been called the ‘interaction’ theory of metaphor is the one Richards fails to stress, namely that it posits an account of metaphorical meaning which works essentially on the prior, unstated, and necessarily variable knowledge of the reader, or addressee. For example, the metaphorical intent of the classical example of the ﬁgure, ‘Man is a wolf’, will be lost on a reader who is suﬃciently ignorant about wolves. On the other hand, for the metaphor to obtain the reader need not know the standard dictionary deﬁnition of ‘wolf’, or be able to use that word in literal senses; he need only know what Max Black has termed the ‘system of associated commonplaces’ which, in this case, would be a collection of imaginary statements recording those things or qualities which he holds to be true about wolves. To an expert on wolves the reader’s ‘system of commonplaces’ may include half-truths or complete errors (that the wolf hunts alone); however, the important thing for the metaphor’s eﬀectiveness is not that the commonplaces be true, but that they be readily and freely evoked. This is why a metaphor that works in one society may seem preposterous in another. People who take wolves to be reincarnations of dead humans will give a rather diﬀerent interpretation of the metaphor than that oﬀered by the natural scientist. The eﬀect, then, of (metaphorically) calling a man a ‘wolf’ is to evoke the wolf-system of related commonplaces. If the man is a wolf,\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n17\n\nhe preys upon other animals, is ﬁerce, hungry, a scavenger and so on and so forth. Each of these implied assertions has now to be made to ﬁt the principal subject (the man) either in normal or abnormal senses. The reader, or addressee, will be led by the wolf-system of implications to construct a corresponding system of implications about the principal subject. But the corresponding set (the new meaning) will not be those comprised in the commonplaces normally implied by literal uses of ‘man’. The new implications must be determined by the pattern of implications associated with literal uses of the word ‘wolf’. Any human traits that can without undue strain be talked about in ‘wolf-language’ will be rendered prominent, and any that cannot will be pushed into the background. The wolf-metaphor suppresses some details and emphasises others. In short, it organises the reader’s view of the man. Two important factors emerge from Richards’ analysis. Firstly, the prospect of metaphorical meaning is conditional on the prior, possibly shared knowledge of the addressee. Therefore—and this is the second point—metaphor works through time, as well as through space. The publication in 1962 of Max Black’s Models and Metaphors marks a milestone in the study of metaphor. In this book Black sets out to prove that behind the ‘stroke of genius’ or ‘remarkable insight’ which, typically, accounts for scientiﬁc discoveries or inventions there are conceptual processes at work, one of the most important of which is metaphor. Metaphor equates to what scientists term ‘theoretical models’; Black’s example is Clerk Maxwell’s representation of an electrical ﬁeld in terms of the properties of an imaginary, incompressible ﬂuid. There is nothing new in scientists’ use of theoretical models; however, in this case Black is interested in Maxwell’s insistence on the ‘imaginary’ character of the ﬂuid evoked. It has the status of a model and yet one can neither point at it nor construct it. This imaginary existence of the ﬂuid allowed Maxwell in his discourse on electrical ﬁelds to move away from the concept of an imaginary ideal and towards ontological commitment. He no longer regarded Faraday’s lines of force as ‘purely geometrical conceptions’; they became ‘the directions in which the medium is exerting a tension like that of a rope, or rather, like that of our own muscles’.38 The diﬀerence is between thinking of the electrical ﬁeld as if it were ﬁlled with a material medium, and thinking of it as being such a medium. The ﬁrst approach, classiﬁed by Black as the implementation of the model as ‘heuristic ﬁction’, supposes a detached comparison reminiscent of simile; the second requires an identiﬁcation typical of metaphor. Referring both to\n\n18\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nRutherford’s solar system and Bohr’s model of the atom, each of which is associated with monumental developments in the history of science, Black argues that this latter, ‘existential’ use of models is ‘characteristic of the practice of the great theorists in physics’.39 Having established some sort of historical validity for his theorisations, Black pursues the analogy between the theoretical model in relation to science, and metaphor in relation to literature. He argues that theoretical models, whether treated as real or ﬁctitious, are not literally constructed; rather ‘the heart of the method consists of talking in a certain way’.40 They introduce a new language which, under speciﬁc conditions, may produce a better understanding of the original ﬁeld of investigation. In order to substantiate this claim Black resorts to another example of the use of the theoretical model, taken this time from a published account of investigations in pure mathematics.41 The problem to be solved, that of ﬁnding some method for dissecting any rectangle into a set of unequal squares, serves no practical purpose other than that of interest to those who enjoy playing mathematical games. In the course of the investigation the usual methods of trial-anderror and straightforward computation produced no results. It was only when the mathematicians ‘abandoned experiment for theory’ that they started to make progress. The last in a series of diﬀerent kinds of diagrams representing rectangles suddenly ‘made’ their problem part of the theory of electrical networks. Black elaborates on the mathematicians’ introduction of a point-for-point model in their procedure. We learn that geometrical lines in the original ﬁgure were replaced by electrical terminals, and squares by connecting wires through which electric currents are imagined to ﬂow. Then, by suitable choices of the resistances in the wires and the strengths of the currents ﬂowing through them, a circuit is described conforming to known electrical principles (in this case Kirchoﬀ’s Law). The resources of a wellmastered theory of electrical networks are thus applied to the original geometrical problem. The lesson imparted by Black is that the theoretical model initiates a novel discourse. In the language of science it is essentially an heuristic instrument that seeks, by means of a ﬁction, to break down an inadequate interpretation and pave the way for a new, more adequate interpretation. The radical aspect of Black’s work concerns this stress on the use of ﬁctions and therefore on the role of the imagination in the pursuit of knowledge in the sciences. However, the value of his contribution to a theory of literary or philosophical metaphor should\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n19\n\nnot be underestimated. He reminds us that, according to the interaction theory, a successful metaphor has the power to bring two separate domains into cognitive and emotional relation by using language directly appropriate to the one as a lens for seeing the other. The implications, suggestions and supporting values entwined with the literal use of the metaphorical expression enable a new subject matter to be viewed in a new way. Importantly, the extended meanings that result, the relations between initially disparate realms created, can neither be antecedently predicted nor subsequently paraphrased in prose. Equally, Black insists, the memorable models of science are ‘speculative instruments’ which bring about a wedding of disparate subjects by a distinctive operation of transfer of the implications of relatively well-organised cognitive ﬁelds. Often the use of a particular model may amount to nothing more than a strained and artiﬁcial description of a well-mapped domain. But on other occasions it may highlight what has previously been overlooked, or shift the relative emphasis attached to details; in general it may help us to see new connections. Recent thinkers such as Goodman (working speciﬁcally within the framework of pictorial art), Ortony and Kittay have wrestled with the diﬃculties involved in discriminating between the literal and the metaphorical use of language. Eva Kittay’s contribution is especially valuable in that she forwards an account of metaphorical reference which is elegant and relatively simple. If the literal referent is the referent of an expression understood literally, she argues, then the metaphorical referent is the referent of an expression understood metaphorically. This means that the referent of the metaphorical expression—when that expression takes the form of a singular referring term—is the literal referent that would be speciﬁed by an appropriate term from what Kittay calls the ‘topic domain’, that is, the set of connotative options proposed by the metaphor in the ﬁrst instance. Thus, metaphor is the process by which one of a number of existing connotations is privileged. Metaphorical reference is then whatever this privileged connotative element would normally (literally) refer to in circumstances where it is regarded as denotative, rather than connotative. In simple terms, metaphor refers to a property or quality of the subject which is either undisclosed or not suﬃciently highlighted in its ordinary language denotation, but which has nonetheless always existed. Interestingly, Kittay then speculates that if we can speak of metaphors referring, can we also then speak of sentences in which these\n\n20\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nsingular terms occur as metaphorically true or false? She makes the point, with characteristic understatement, that truth and falsity are relative to a conceptual scheme, and that metaphorical truth and falsity therefore need to be understood in the same terms. Relative to a scheme in which cities are thought of as women, ‘The Venice of the Renaissance was a noblewoman’ would be true, whilst ‘The Venice of the Renaissance was a washerwoman’ would be false. The all-important distinction is established: while metaphorical reference can be understood by appeal to simple anaphora, metaphorical truth must be understood through the conceptual detour provided by the secondorder meaning speciﬁc to metaphor. In order to demonstrate her theory of metaphorical truth, Kittay proposes an audacious metaphor for metaphor: Metaphor as Rearranging the Furniture of the Mind.42 The bare room, as well as the material essence of the furniture, is the world we humans encounter prior to our activity of structuring and creating our environment. The furniture, the relation the pieces bear to one another, and the rules we follow for placing and using the individual items represent our creation and arrangement of the world we inhabit—our immediate environment. The sentences in the language of our room-world would refer to the furniture, in its relation to the room, to other pieces of furniture, and to our needs, desires and anything that might inﬂuence future events. Likewise the meaning of a speciﬁc piece of furniture has to do with its form and material, and the success or otherwise with which it slots into the general scheme. Having projected these linguistic rules on to this ‘furniture catalogue’ image, Kittay narrates a number of discursive situations. To speak correctly, she suggests, is to utilise the furniture according to conventions reﬂected in its current placement, and it is also to assent to a proper placement of furniture. Therefore, assenting to the proper placement of furniture is to speak the truth. Conversely, to sit down at a table where there is no chair is to cause oneself a nasty injury, and eﬀectively to utter a falsehood. To assent to a misplaced chair would be to assent to a falsehood. To assent to a bureau placed against the bathroom door would be to speak plain nonsense, and to assent to all the furniture being piled up in the middle of the room would be to speak of possible, but improbable worlds (though the speech act may refer to ‘moving house’). The point Kittay makes is that truth is ‘relative to what is the proper order’,43 although, in view of later implications she introduces, it might be wiser to say that truth is\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n21\n\nrelative to what is the pre-existing order. ‘Metaphorical placements’ occur when there is a meaningful violation of this proper order, as would be the case with the moving of the straight-backed chair for the convenience of a guest who has a bad back. This productive capacity of metaphor is part of a general law of life. When a room is completely refurbished there is initially a great disruption. However, with time we forget that the furniture was ever diﬀerently ordered. To the extent that the change is systematic and widespread, it leaves only the slightest trace of its metaphorical origin. The next tenant who takes the room will assume that the dining area has always been by the sunniest window. It is now the literal truth. However, it would be an odd truth if the next tenant was a Japanese student, since she would view furniture placed against walls as a breach of all aesthetic and pragmatic rules for furniture arrangement. An African friend accustomed to living in a long house would ﬁnd even the conﬁguration of the room odd. He would be amused at the bed (regardless of its placement) and appalled by the lack of hammocks. Kittay maintains that both these visitors would come to see this arrangement as ‘serviceable, given the conditions of western living’,44 adding that neither would be likely to see any merit in the sofa on its side. Kittay’s argument suggests that, although metaphorical truth may be accessible, our perception of metaphor is imbricated in our cultural diﬀerences. The conventions and rules informing the ‘proper order’ are culturally determined. Diﬀerent cultures will inevitably have diﬀerent rules responding to diﬀerent criteria and structured by diﬀerent concepts. Ultimately, the eﬀectiveness of metaphor relies almost entirely on contextual factors. Semantic ﬁelds are an inadequate basis for analysis because they do not provide us with the signiﬁcation of terms. Words have content. In the ﬁeld of cooking, to know that ‘fry’, ‘grill’ and ‘roast’ all contrast in a particular way; that they are, in the language of semantics, incompatible co-hyponyms, does not help us to know what to do if we are ordered to roast a chicken. Kittay uses a telling example—The seal dragged himself out of the oﬃce—to show how the elaboration of the total context of a single metaphor will often lead the analyst out of the immediate linguistic vicinity. In this case, three diﬀerent, equally plausible, interpretive possibilities are suggested. The seal may indeed be a seal, one of the many animal characters in a modern children’s fairy-tale. On the other hand, it could refer to the weary executive at the end of a hard working day, during which he has been constantly on display, trotted out before prospective clients in\n\n22\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nwhose company he behaves like a performing seal. Or, the seal could refer to the physical appearance of a stereotypical oﬃce worker in the days before health promotion. He would wear a black suit that had, by dint of habitual use, developed a ﬁne sheen not unlike the seal’s coat, his black hair would be worn slicked down, and he would walk with a waddling gait which would become more exaggerated as the day wore on. Thus, at 5 o’clock every weekday afternoon . . . Kittay’s analyses conﬁrm a number of hypotheses about metaphor: that it inhabits a much larger world; that it embraces the text in which it features; that it refers to myths and truths which are indigenous to a particular culture; that it is culturally deﬁned because it presupposes the existence of an accepted system of knowledge. If I have dwelt too long on these big ideas, it is because they, rather than the ‘ﬁgure among ﬁgures’ exactitude of traditional exegetes, provide the stimulus to my own understanding of literary metaphor. I now want to discuss three divergent approaches to metaphor, each of which has a more direct bearing on my investigation of Tournier’s ﬁctional project.\n\nTHREE CASE-STUDIES: RICOEUR; RICARDOU; LAKOFF AND JOHNSON It is evident from the conﬂicting, multi-faceted approaches to the subject, some of which have been outlined above, that metaphor germinates in the imagination, traditionally the poet’s though it may spring from that of the reader or conversationalist. Perhaps the need to establish the location of the agent of metaphor, the identity of its executor, has been overplayed. What now seems clear is that any credible model of metaphoric comprehension cannot aﬀord to dispense with at least a working theory of the imagination. However, of all the interested parties only Paul Ricoeur oﬀers a developed account of the role of imagination in metaphorical insight. Ricoeur claims that an adequate semantic theory of metaphor, that is, ‘an inquiry into the capacity of metaphor to provide untranslatable information’,45 requires a theory of the imagination that is both psychological and semantic. The signiﬁcance of his approach lies in the simple fact that he is prepared to give to metaphor a source, the imagination. Now that it has a beginning we are able to conceive of it diﬀerently, as something which is produced, like a narrative, rather than as an ever-present faculty of the mind. As Ricoeur observes, this beginning is the mode of\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n23\n\nfunctioning of the imagination, which is ‘immanent . . . to the predicative process itself’.46 This work of the imagination provides the basis for a theory of metaphorical reference which, Ricoeur claims, is representative of literary ﬁction generally. The pre-plan for metaphorical reference comprises three stages. Initially Ricoeur leans on Kant. Thus, imagination is described in what Kant called its productive mode, in which it underwrites a synthetic operation of understanding. In metaphor this synthesis occurs by way of an imaginative leap which allows us to see how two previously unassociated systems of implications ﬁt together to reveal an underlying unity (whilst still preserving their surface incompatibility). In the second stage, imagination is recalled to the pictorial dimension, to the state in which it is normally conceived and where it begins to supply the images that ﬁll out the sense of the metaphor. However, the vestiges of the imagination’s conceptual functioning are still prevalent. Ricoeur emphasises that images are not, or need not necessarily be, mental pictures; rather, they are ways of presenting relations ‘in a depicting mode’. Finally, imagination in metaphor is conditional on a ‘negative’ step, in which primary reference to the everyday world is suspended, so as to make possible a new creative reference, a ‘remaking’ of reality (to paraphrase Nelson Goodman’s slogan). Ricoeur sums up this three-fold movement as follows: Imagination does not merely schematize the predicative assimilation between terms by its synthetic insight into similarities nor does it merely picture the sense thanks to the display of images aroused and controlled by the cognitive process. Rather, it contributes concretely to the e´poche´ of ordinary reference and to the projection of new possibilities of redescribing the world.47\n\nRicoeur’s conceptualisation of the productive imagination puts those who believe that metaphor is cognitively irreducible on a much ﬁrmer footing. Now we can see that it is in the movement of the imagination prior to discourse—in what Ricoeur calls the schematising process of predicative assimilation—that new meaning and new insight are born. Imagination releases metaphor as a tool for understanding.48 Upon this foundation Ricoeur builds an impressive theory of metaphorical reference. He takes as his starting point Roman Jakobson’s communication model.49 In an attempt to embrace the totality of linguistic phenomena within a single schema Jakobson identiﬁes six crucial factors—the addresser, the addressee, the code, the contact, the context and the message—which pertain to all forms of verbal communication. Any one of these factors may be animated, or rendered\n\n24\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nprominent in discourse by any one of six corresponding functions: the emotive, the conative, the metalingual or metalinguistic, the phatic, the referential, and the poetic functions respectively. In literary discourse, or verbal art as Jakobson prefers to call it, the poetic function focuses on the message for its own sake. Therefore, Jakobson argues, this function ‘by promoting the palpability of signs, deepens the fundamental dichotomy of signs and objects’.50 This is, in essence, a restatement of the classic formalist/structuralist position. However, Jakobson ﬁnds that it is now vulnerable. The semantic equivalence brought about by phonic equivalence in the poetic text brings with it an ambiguity that aﬀects all the functions of communication. The addresser is split (the I of the lyrical hero, or of the ﬁctitious narrator), and so too the addressee (the you as supposed addressee of dramatic monologues, supplications and epistles). Thus, poetic ambiguity need not necessarily imply the suppression of the referential function: The supremacy of poetic function over referential function does not obliterate the reference but makes it ambiguous. The double-sensed message ﬁnds correspondence in a split addresser, in a split addressee, and besides in a split reference, as it is cogently expressed in the preambles to fairy tales of various peoples, for instance in the usual exordium of the Majorca storytellers: ‘Aixo era y no era’ (‘It was and it was not’).51\n\nIt is clear to Ricoeur from Jakobson’s analysis that the relation of poetics to the more general science of linguistics is immersed in a logic of metaphor. Indeed, according to Ricoeur the metaphorical expression provides the theatre in which all this drama of the doubles takes place: ‘C’est dans l’analyse meˆme de l’e´nonce´ me´taphorique que doit s’enraciner une conception re´fe´rentielle du langage poe´tique qui tienne compte de l’abolition de la re´fe´rence du langage ordinaire et se re`gle sur le concept de re´fe´rence de´double´e.’52 At this point Ricoeur starts to think of metaphor in terms of ﬁction generally. Metaphor is a contracted ﬁction; ﬁction is an expanded metaphor. This identiﬁcation of metaphor with literary ﬁction becomes the fulcrum of his analysis: ‘The ‘‘it was and it was not’’ of the Majorcan storytellers rules both the split reference of the metaphorical statement and the contradictory structure of ﬁction.’53 Again, Jakobson provides the basis for the analogy. Since the referential function operates in a context, the ‘re´fe´rence de´double´e’ sparked by the ambiguity of the poetic sign cannot, therefore, be constrained within the narrow conﬁnes of the message as expressed through its poetic function. Just as the poetic ambiguity juxtaposes two senses of a word, two linguistic universals, so\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n25\n\nthe ‘re´fe´rence de´double´e’ juxtaposes the two worlds in which these senses feature, the world of the text and the world outside the text. Thus, Ricoeur lauds the poet as not only the maker of ﬁne metaphors but as ‘this genius who generates split references by creating ﬁctions’. Herein lies the audacity of metaphor; in its brash resolve to alter not only the sense of the utterance in which it features, but the entire context upon which that utterance is dependent. Let us summarise the diﬀerent stages in Ricoeur’s account of metaphorical reference. Initially, the poetic function of the text brings about the suspension of ordinary descriptive reference so as to clear the space for the imagination to do its work. The result of this work is a fracture along the entire length of the communicative axis. The doubleedged poetic sign replays itself in the various actants and functions designated in the process of communication. The most important of these repercussions concerns the manifestation of a split reference aﬃliated to a context. This context surrounds the metaphorical relation of the work of ﬁction to the empirical world of ordinary reference, in which the radical claim to ‘redescribe reality’ is promoted through the split reference of the language of ﬁction. The most contentious aspect of Ricoeur’s argument is precisely this, that the ambiguity of the poetic sign translates into the double reference of poetic language, which, by virtue of its renewed referential function, gains the capacity to provide new cognitive insight on the world outside the text. The re-creation of the world in the poem is maintained in tensive relation with the external world by the radical copula, the is of the metaphorical assertion, which stakes its authority to make the suspension of primary reference to the everyday world an act of permanence. By way of a happy coincidence, Ricoeur’s plotting of metaphor provides a ready-made schema appropriate for the dressing of my chosen model, the Tournier œuvre. It may seem an odd thing that Tournier’s ﬁrst novel, the one which ought perhaps to have testiﬁed to the ‘originality’ of this new writer, is Vendredi ou Les limbes du Paciﬁque, an initially faithful rewriting of Daniel Defoe’s classic adventure story, Robinson Crusoe. Tournier may have sensed something which many readers of Robinson Crusoe, on account of Defoe’s suﬀocating moralising, probably miss; that the marooning of a solitary man on a desert island puts the greatest possible distance between that man and the referential concerns of his normal, and now past, existence. Defoe’s Crusoe spends his time on the island sustaining a metaphysical system that enables connections with this former,\n\n26\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nempirical world to be re-established. For a while Tournier’s Robinson follows the tracks of his literary ancestor. He, too, discovers a footprint in the sand. But gradually the signiﬁcance of his situation becomes apparent. Robinson’s life is not merely a battle against solitude. He is not merely ship-wrecked; he is suspended in limbo, in the world of the e´poche´, freed from the clutter of existence to explore the virtualities of the imagination. Vendredi plies the reader with successive representations of this virtual existence—the tranquillity of the womb/tomb in the depths of the grotto, Vendredi’s ‘vie en marge’ from which Robinson is ‘culturally’ excluded, and Robinson’s patch of pink moss. It aﬀords glimpses of what Genette calls the ‘espace inte´rieur’ of the text, in the orated ecstasies of the biblical ‘Song of Songs’. The reader is lured into this world, which is both the Romantic and the Barthesian ‘bower of bliss’, a place of sensory expectation, of linguistic sense without meaning. The myth of Robinson Crusoe puts the innate conservatism of metaphor, in which denomination carries with it the seeds of predication, under enormous strain. However, the umbilical cord remains intact and functional, for in Vendredi ou Les limbes du Paciﬁque we are presented with an unimaginable situation which we know to be (just) possible. This is the essence of myth, in its polyvalent relation to metaphor, which is explored in Chapter 2. As he was writing Vendredi, Tournier was also working on what was to become his second novel, Le Roi des aulnes. The latter is set in France and Germany during the Second World War. In it the narrative of ﬁction runs parallel to another narrative, constituted through the historical referents spaced out in the text, a second narrative which relays our conventional knowledge of this history. Presented as a narrative entity however, Le Roi des aulnes embodies Ricoeur’s radical view of the poetic text as ‘re´fe´rence de´double´e’. The ﬁction aﬃrms its identity as ﬁction, primarily through the ‘real life’ characterisation of a mythological, or fantastic ﬁgure, but at the same time asserts its right to speak on matters of the utmost philosophical importance. Le Roi des aulnes is, therefore, the representation or the dramatic expression of this relationship between denomination and predication, which is unique to metaphor. Ricoeur’s gallant refusal to abandon the notion of a non-textual reality aﬀorded him pariah status in the poststructuralist heyday of the 1960s and 1970s. Yet via one of the most radical experiments in narrative form, carried out by the most enthusiastic proponent of the\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n27\n\nnouveau roman school of writing, the philosophical foundations of Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and its implications for the narrative arts are exposed and scrutinised. The text is Les lieux-dits, its author Jean Ricardou. Les lieux-dits is a novel born of language. It starts out under the auspices of the travel guide—there are faint echoes here of Barthes’ essay on Le Guide Bleu—but the signiﬁer is straight away liberated from any constraining, bourgeois-led discourse and embarks on a ‘literary’ adventure, stopping oﬀ at eight diﬀerent place-names. The linear movement of the narrative is disrupted not only by the repetition of sequential chunks—a characteristic feature of the nouveau roman— but by semantic detours generated from a small number of core motifs: the symbol of the cross, ﬁre and water, the reading of the painting, and the two species of ant. At an early juncture a metaﬁctional debate— which will mean little to those readers uninitiated into the arcane world classiﬁed in university libraries under the rubrique ‘Philosophy of Language’—is introduced. Why is the second destination, Beaufort, which is a settlement on a hill, so called? There has never been a castle at Beaufort, the reader is told, ‘Aucune ruine, ni vestige symbolique’.54 Therefore, the name Beaufort cannot be said to render some prior, historical reality. Moreover, another clue, the clipping of roadside hedges in the shape of crenelated walls, suggests that the opposite is true, that the topography of Beaufort has evolved so as to conform to the place-name. The name comes before the thing. Not everybody is prepared to accept this evidence at face value. Opponents of the word fanatics argue that, in spite of the lack of fortiﬁcations, other features such as the narrow windows of the houses grouped along the one spiralling road, give it the ‘look’ of a citadel: ‘Ainsi, contrairement aux the`ses d’une doctrine fallacieuse, est-il bien l’origine de son nom ce village qui, en sa singulie`re ge´ome´trie, est beau, fort, et haut’.55 A conﬂictual, oppositional dynamic is thus established, ‘l’e´trange querelle qui s’occupe de de´ﬁnir lequel, des mots et des choses est l’e´le´ment majeur’.56 In this case the quest for origins (including, for example, clear references to Benveniste’s famous attack on etymologies57) precipitates a ‘medieval fantasy’ in which the citadel is besieged by underground forces, ﬁghting under a semiological standard, who strive to take it and expel the guardians of the nomenclature. There is a strong sense that this debate about language, which is, properly speaking, a metaphysical dichotomy, subsumes the other battles that are played out in the narrative. The matter is not, as we\n\n28\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nshall see, resolved conclusively. This poses a problem, for Les lieux-dits exhibits not only a desire for order, but a desire for a natural order. Mathematics is held up as a possible model. In Milan Kundera’s work seven is a magical ﬁgure; in Les lieux-dits, as in Robbe-Grillet’s Le Voyeur—both could be read as circular narratives—the ﬁgure eight and its multiples is a primary structural motif. (There is less emphasis in Les lieux-dits on the pictorial dimension of the number, though the arrangement of the words on the cover—which is reproduced identically on the title page—has an eightish shape to it.) We can be certain of the fact that there are eight place-names, each composed of eight letters, which head the eight chapters into which the book is divided. The mid-point and the end of chapter four occurs on page 80, and there are 160 pages in all. The number eight is cited often in the text, not quite to the exclusion of all other numbers—two dates (1908 and 1917) are mentioned. The word used most frequently is ‘aujourd’hui’ (au jour de huit), suggesting not only the timelessness of numbers but the discursive present of synchronic linguistics. ‘Aujourd’hui’ occurs (sometimes more than once) on eighteen diﬀerent pages. When the eight place-names are listed to form a crossword-style grid, the left-toright diagonal spells out (and thus reiterates) Belcroix, the fourth destination in narrative order: B A N N I E` R E B E A U FO R T BELARBRE BELCROIX CENDRIER CHAUMONT HAUTBOIS MONTEAUX This movement of the eye, scanning down and across the grid, is also the recommended method of reading the allegorical painting.58 The mathematical order of Les lieux-dits is ﬁxed. Conversely, the answers to the more conventional ‘literary’ questions posed by this text are extremely ﬂuid. There is a narrator, who is closely identiﬁed with the chief protagonist, named in the text as ‘Olivier Lasius’. The latter is engaged in a quest for meaning. How to interpret the painting? What happened to the painter, Albert Crucis? Was he taken away in an ambulance? Was the ambulance involved in a crash, and was everything, including the body of Crucis, incinerated in a ﬁre which was caused by the crash? Or was Crucis killed by a pyromaniac who had\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n29\n\nescaped from a mental institution? There are an inﬁnite number of possibilities for narrative resolution. In this case they revolve around a constellation of signiﬁers emanating from the central ‘star’ word, ‘croix’: croisade, croissant, La Croix Rouge, la croix des chevaliers de Malte, crucial, Crucis, etc. Another form of linguistic logic is also at work. The place-name Cendrier generates a contiguous chain of ideas which ‘justiﬁes’ references to amongst other things Pall Mall cigarettes and the British Royal Family. This language world seems governed by a system. The antique-dealer at Beaufort specialises in medieval weapons, though he is unconcerned as to whether they are genuine antiques or forgeries. However, he must respect the municipal regulations which govern the display of his wares, for he is only one of many antique-dealers concentrated in Beaufort, all with diﬀerent collections: books, engravings, tapestries, etc. These paradigmatic sets are of most interest to other knowledgeable specialists. In order to attract more ordinary tourists, the Beaufort Tourist Oﬃce has instructed the dealers to take turns in mounting a composite display based around a particular theme or narrative, using articles borrowed from their fellow traders. Visitors to Beaufort will therefore delight in ﬁnding not only a number of homogeneous collections, but also an heterogeneous display where each article derives its function not from its intrinsic properties but from its place in the overall scheme. ‘Faut-il aujourd’hui pre´ciser’, the narrator asks with rhetorical menace, ‘que certains controversistes, utilisant toute circonstance pour faire rebondir leur querelle, se sont plu a` lire dans cette double mise en place, une parabole de la linguistique distinction entre le paradigme et le syntagme?’59 The reference to Saussure in the ﬁrst instance, and then to Jakobson’s theory that the process by which language becomes meaningful discourse is governed by the laws of metaphor and metonymy, is unmistakable. However, in Les lieux-dits words have a life of their own. Coherence is impossible in a narrative which constantly deconstructs itself. This situation is unbearable for the ants, functional insects whose very existence is instinctively attuned to notions of system and order. The ants are the representatives par excellence of the construction industry. Signiﬁcant ant activity in the text of Les lieuxdits means that everything is recycled; words, ideas, concepts keep coming back. Hence the semantic slippage of the text—which may take the reader rapidly from Cendrier to Pall Mall cigarettes and on to the British Royal family and thus imparts a dynamic thrust to the narrative—is negated by the constant re-emergence of certain motifs.\n\n30\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nMetaphor, or word associations, wins the battle over metonymy, or narrative discourse. Within this deconstructive/reconstructive process there is, however, stability at the level of the morpheme. If the source words were no longer recognisable, chaos would ensue. And once these words are (metaphorically) stabilised, then the possibility emerges that they may accrue a symbolic function, either in the form of anagrams (belatedly recognised by Saussure as, along with onomatopoeia, an alternative means of linguistic motivation) or as words which, horror of horrors, represent non-linguistic phenomena. As the text progresses, therefore, we are constantly referred back to the physical evidence of language, to the visible presence of the signiﬁer. Ironically, this revives the potential for representation; language may indeed have a mimetic function. We can circumnavigate this linguistic dilemma by taking our ﬁrst step outside the world of the text and activating some knowledge based on genre. The unmotivated repetition of a particular narrative sequence is a technique pioneered by Alain Robbe-Grillet. In his novel La Jalousie, the death of a centipede is described at several junctures in the narrative. In cases such as these the repetition is both lexical and syntactic. Entire sentences, paragraphs, pages even are reproduced apparently at random. The ﬁrst of two such privileged sequences in Les lieux-dits follows an orthodox robbe-grilletian pattern. The second involves a more fragmented, prolonged, and complex operation performed by a ﬁrst-person narrator who is now participating actively in events and apparently steering the narrative towards its closure. Both scenarios focus intensively on ants. In the ﬁrst a boy by the wayside is acting strangely. He is peering at a small gravelly area, but he is not looking through the magnifying glass which he has in his possession. On closer inspection he is manipulating the glass, so that it captures the trajectory of the sun, and directing the beam towards an army of black ants clustered around a fragment of glass-like material. The ants are exterminated one after the other. In the narrative reprise of this incident only the identity of the persecutor has changed. We are given to understand that this is the boy’s account of a scene he has witnessed. The ant-killer is now a woman in a red dress whose example the boy has copied. Nevertheless the narrator administers an appropriate punishment in recognition of the boy’s misdemeanour. He whips his bare legs with tapered brambles. The boy’s discomfort signiﬁes the revenge of the ants, for the irritation to his skin is caused by formic acid, ‘l’acide formique’, a form of\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n31\n\nretribution which is preﬁgured literally by the fact that he is rather stiﬀ. Indeed he has ‘des fourmis dans les jambes’,60 pins-and-needles from having been crouched too long in the same position, absorbed by his ant incinerating. In the second half of the text, the narrator, who is now a more forceful discursive presence, begins to study the behaviour of warring species of ants. He notices how the big red ant acting alone triumphs over batallions of smaller black ants while the conﬂict rages in sunlight, but also the defeat of a more docile red ant in the shadows, where it is rapidly ‘tronc¸onne´e’ by its numerous black cousins. He introduces variations, holding his palm out over the battleground, thereby providing unexpected areas of shade, creating other diversions which cause a red ant to dementedly attack other ants of its own species. The narrator’s experiments with ants are revealed as preparation for the de´nouement, when the ant conﬂict is re-enacted, only this time on a human stage. As the country lane narrows to a path, Atta, the woman in the red dress, and Lasius, the narrator, abandon their car and continue their journey on foot. Lasius forcefully requests that Atta should undress alphabetically, ‘slip’ before ‘soutien-gorge’, showing again the triumph of the paradigmatic set over the naturally syntagmatic order of seduction. She acquiesces to his request. Then he pegs her out on the ground in cruciﬁxion posture, whips her legs with a bunch of nettles and explains what will happen next. Her body will be covered with a thin layer of honey so as to attract a seething horde of red ants. A magnifying glass will be positioned on the ground at such an angle that the beam of the midday sun will ignite the tip of one of eight pathways of dry scrub radiating out from the focal point of the supine human form. This conﬁguration suggests the medieval punishment of the auto-da-fe´, or burning (of witches or heretics) at the stake, albeit on a horizontal plane. Certainly the resulting conﬂagration should speed the extinction of the red ants, thereby exacting the vengeance of the black. Lasius will make good his escape, leaving the pyromaniac to carry the can. The pyromaniac, he informs Atta, has been a real presence all along and has now been summoned to the neighbourhood in order that he be implicated for such a creative pyromaniacal achievement. However, the conclusion we are supposed to arrive at has already been spelled out. The two narrative genres—the travel guide and the novel—are seen to represent the ebb and ﬂow of the oppositional forces brought to life in the text. The narrator observes that these two\n\n32\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nadversaries contain within themselves the seeds of their own destruction: Il n’est pas de guide qui ne succombe au de´sir du langage et, outre les descriptions assurant aux objets une nouvelle allure, ne propose de´ja`, sous couvert de le´gende ou d’histoire, mainte e´trange aventure. Quant au roman, pour occupe´ qu’il soit a` inventer l’autonomie de son espace, il ne laisse d’utiliser, en revanche, a` chaque instant, des e´le´ments du monde: tout paysage ﬁctif s’e´tablit par re´fe´rence a` de quotidiennes contre´es.61\n\nAll generic distinctions are eﬀectively contaminated by the fundamental metaphoricity of language, which involves the reader in a constant coming-and-going within the conﬁnes of the speciﬁed language, making links between sound patterns, semantic ﬁelds and narrative structures, whilst at the same time building bridges between the text and the world outside it. Connotation and denotation are thus the two faces of the same metaphorical coin. As the resuscitated Albert Crucis murmurs wistfully on the last page of the text, ‘Tout cela, une fois de plus, aujourd’hui, est une me´taphore’.62 The text thus adopts a narrative alternance in which ‘fourmi’ succeeds ‘cigale’,63 and ‘nul doute’ replaces ‘sans (sens) doute’ as each aspect of the terrain is mapped by the intrepid narrator. Poetry cedes to realism which cedes to poetry; we travel from connotation to denotation and on to connotation. Still, the overall picture of Les lieux-dits falls some distance short of coherence. The Proper Names are symbolic, each seeming to designate the character’s function in the narrative: Crucis is a Latin genitive, meaning ‘of the cross’; lasius alienus is a breed of tiny black ant; Atta’s fate is predetermined by her palindromic name, suggesting the refraction of light or heat, as in a crucible, to a centre-point, and thus incineration by means of the magnifying glass. Yet the title of the opus bequeathed by the pe`re La Fourmi, Le Jardin des Oppositions, suggests a medieval allegory. An allegory of what? A human tendency to self-destruct? The pe`re La Fourmi dies having swallowed a vial of the insecticide he had been using in an attempt to wipe out the local population of red ants. Signiﬁcantly, La Fontaine’s grasshopper is marginalised. On the other hand the text teems with ants. Moreover, the narrator’s growing interest in ant behaviour necessitates a change of mode, as the distant third person is superseded by a more involved ﬁrst-person voice. More importantly, with the repeated narrations of the incineration scene, the narrative eventually transcends connotative symbolism and reaches the brink of a full, metaphorical transition, as the ants are replaced by human actants. Lasius’ ﬁnal plan is the literal enactment of an alle-\n\nPerspectives on Metaphor and Literary Fiction\n\n33\n\ngorical potential which has already been the subject of some discussion, namely that the repeated patterns of ant conﬂict merely reproduce human behaviour: Nul doute que l’histoire des humains avec ses queˆtes de l’amour, de la richesse, de la liberte´ fugace ou de la creuse e´meraude du Graal, avec ses guerres, ses esthe´tiques, ses re´volutions, ses croisades, ne soit la re´plique de la lutte impitoyable que se livrent, depuis des mille´naires, les peuples des fourmis. S’il s’interroge sur la nature de telle correspondance, le voyageur ne manquera pas d’eˆtre trouble´, sans doute, par la simple ide´e que les activite´s humaines puissent eˆtre une me´taphore des conﬂits qui divisent les populations microscopiques.64\n\nThe very notion of allegory, the possibility of allegorical meaning, is then immediately quashed by a ﬂurry of rhetorical questions aimed at each of the categories—war, aesthetics, revolutions, etc.—listed in the quotation above. The precarious, physical existence of the narrative is reiterated as the narrator self-consciously cuts to the next scene— ‘. . . j’interromps ici cette ligne, aujourd’hui’65—which will conclude with a diﬀerent, contradictory meditation on the ﬁgurative sense of the red ant, ‘les lignes des fourmis rouges et bleues, avec leurs pattes de´passant de chaque coˆte´ de l’axe des mots, n’e´taient, selon la formule de Crucis, qu’une me´taphore du texte, puisque l’auteur avait commence´ a` produire son e´criture selon telles couleurs alterne´es’.66 Nevertheless Ricardou has, perhaps fatally, permitted an anthropomorphic incision of the sort which Robbe-Grillet fought so tenaciously in the halcyon days of the nouveau roman.67 Once aired, the parallelism between ant and human can never be properly despatched, for it signals recognition—though this may be a sub-conscious recognition on the part of the reader—of the fact that all literature, indeed all metaphor is anthropomorphic. Our apprehension of the world can never be ‘objective’, for it will always be impregnated with the essence of human history. The narrator’s pseudo-scientiﬁc observation of ant behaviour thus emphasises that so-called ‘natural’ history is, in fact, ‘cultural’ history, an anthropomorphic perspective on nature. According to the crude allegorical schema, ant conﬂict reiﬁes two oppositional ways of organising human society, in which the rugged individualism of the red ant is pitted against the cooperative, communal black ant. At the same time both species, indeed all species of earthbound ants, are programmed to construct. Ants are instinctive builders, the most functional of functional insects. Of course, Les lieux-dits is not about ants, it is about literature. What is it? How does it work? An appropriate response would be that this book, whatever it is, is a ‘hell\n\n34\n\nMichel Tournier\n\nof a job to read’, ‘c’est la croix et la bannie`re’. The reader of Les lieuxdits risks the fate of a dysfunctional red ant. We are the woman"
