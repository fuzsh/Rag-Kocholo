        "text": "Wednesday\n\nCommunity Articles\n\nShambhala Is A Culture\n\nContemplating culture and decorum in Chicago\n\nThroughout Shambhala, a member of the leadership team at every center worldwide holds the position of Delegate to the Office of Culture & Decorum. Generally, this person is appointed by the director of the international office via nomination from the local council. For Chicago, I am the current nominee. But if you asked me just one year ago to consider this leadership role, I would have laughed out loud.\n\nIn my 9-year practice journey, my interactions with the Culture & Decorum delegate weren’t pleasant to me. I found encounters to be very stiff and harsh, as if the person’s only job was to shush people in the meditation hall, and to know by heart the order of toasts at a community party. And if such a person genuinely was interested in a more collaborative and relaxed approach to Culture & Decorum, that person left the post with more stress than when they began.\n\nAfter great contemplation on the teachings of the lineage, my personal experience, and the words of the Sakyong and the Sakyong Wangmo, I have come to see this post as a challenge and opportunity, one that I wish to direct and share with the entire Chicago community. The result of my contemplations comes from a personal exploration of what culture and decorum means in Shambhala.\n\n“Shambhala is a culture. Our vision takes form not only through meditation and study, but also through society and the dignity of culture.”\n\nThe Sakyong Wangmo, Khandro Tseyang\n\nPractice On & Off the Cushion\n\nAs mindfulness, awareness, and basic goodness are the foundation for our practice on the cushion and in the world, decorum is the practice of communicating mindfulness and awareness to self and others. Through rituals of decorum, we learn to embody our practice and develop habits to support it. So as much as this does include limiting discursive speech in the meditation hall, it also includes practices of generosity, gratitude, exertion, and more.\n\nThis isn’t just at the Center, but also at home. Throughout the Way of Shambhala curriculum and beyond, opportunities to practice decorum at home, at work, and in society are available and open to all. Again, the practice of decorum is in service to our personal mindfulness practice and our journey toward discovering basic goodness.\n\nThe Language of Basic Goodness\n\nCulture in Shambhala is slightly different. My experience of culture in Shambhala comes through senior teachers and community events. There are dances, toasts, speeches, rituals, songs, and arts that in part are derived from both the native Tibetan culture of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and traditions he adopted during his sojourn in Great Britain. As a Black working-class American, I found it difficult to connect to these cultural displays. I remember times in which I resisted and resented them.\n\nDuring my most recent retreat, I had a moving experience of Shambhala culture in action, in progress, and in collaborative development. A participant offered during a celebration her own a capella gospel arrangement of a Shambhala root text. It was executed with musical precision, and brought the whole room to joyful tears. That moment softened my rigid view of culture in Shambhala, and revealed the infinite possibilities of enlightened culture.\n\nAll secular and religious societies uphold and share what is most important to them through culture. In Shambhala, with basic goodness of self, society and reality as the view, path, and fruition of all actions, culture serves as an expression of basic goodness. Culture is how we personally and publicly acknowledge basic goodness in all things. Weddings, funerals, rites of passage, songs, stories, and the arts express recognition of basic goodness.\n\nAs we practice in service to enlightened society and expand our society through space and time, we will inevitably include other expressions of basic goodness in the world that will be equally celebrated and propagated; drum circles, open mics, quinceañeras, mitzvahs, retirements, recovery, balls, dinners, gospel choirs, and so much more are ripe for inclusion in Shambhala culture. They would not at all be appropriated, but rather recognized that in a society as diverse as enlightened society, all expressions of basic goodness are equally practiced and valued.\n\nOpportunities in Chicago\n\nWith these understandings, I hunger for the possibilities awaiting the Chicago center. But I can’t do it alone. Through my felt sense of the teachings and community, I can only share what I know. I offer my time and heart to sharing, and to hear how our members personally practice mindfulness everywhere and express basic goodness in the world.\n\nI’d like to cultivate a small, diverse team of leaders who fearlessly model Shambhala culture and decorum, and who wish to expand the bounds of those expressions. If you have any curiosity about this, please contact me. I’m not seeking “perfect practitioners.” I’m not seeking “inflexible hall monitors.” I’m seeking community members who are (nearly) willing to take their practice beyond the cushion, and who want to be challenged. This challenge doesn’t need to be rigorous, but it has so great an opportunity to be joyful!\n\nIf you’d like some clarity on what’s in place so far, please seek the following resources:\n\nBooks\n\nAn Introduction to Shambhala Culture, distributed by Shambhala Media\n\nThe Lost Art of Good Conversation by Sakyong Mipham\n\nOnline resources (requires Shambhala login)\n\nShambhala International Culture & Decorum page\n\nShambhala Network"
