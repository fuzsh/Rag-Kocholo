        "text": "The Office of High Sheriff is an independent non-political Royal appointment for one year. The origins of the Office date back to Saxon times, when the 'Shire Reeve' was responsible to the king for the maintenance of law and order within the shire, or county, and for the collection and return of taxes due to the Crown. Today, there are 55 High Sheriffs serving the counties of England and Wales each year.\n\nThe High Sheriff is the Sovereign's representative in the County for matters of law and order and the judiciary and consequently takes an active interest in the administration of justice. The appointment is honorary and there is no formal qualification for the office, although certain people including Members of both Houses of Parliament, serving members of the armed forces, and specific government officials are disqualified from taking office.\n\nThe nominations of prospective High Sheriffs for each County are made in a meeting of the Lords of the Council in The King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice presided over by the Lord Chief Justice in November each year. Subsequently the selection of new High Sheriffs is made annually in a meeting of the Privy Council by The Sovereign when the custom of \"pricking\" the appointee's name with a silver bodkin is made.\n\nHigh Sheriffs receive no remuneration or expenses from public funds.\n\nFurther information can be obtained from the High Sheriffsâ€™ Association of England and Wales (opens new window).\n\nWhile the duties of the role have evolved over time, supporting the Crown and the judiciary remain central elements of the role today.\n\nEach High Sheriff will approach their year slightly differently depending on their particular skills, experience and their own areas of interest. The key objectives of the role can be summarised as follows:\n\nto uphold and enhance the ancient Office of High Sheriff and to make a meaningful contribution to the High Sheriff's county during the year of office\n\nto lend active support to the principal parts of the Constitution within their county - the Royal Family, the Judiciary, the police and other law enforcement agencies, the emergency services, local authorities, and church and faith groups\n\nto ensure the welfare of visiting High Court judges, to attend on them at court and to offer them hospitality\n\nto support the Lord-Lieutenant on royal visits and on other occasions as appropriate\n\nto take an active part in supporting and promoting the voluntary sector and giving all possible encouragement to the voluntary organisations within a county\n\nThe principal formal duties of High Sheriffs today include attendance at Royal visits in the county and support for His Majesty's High Court judges when on circuit.\n\nIn recent years, High Sheriffs actively lend support and encouragement to agencies around crime reduction initiatives and those involved in the voluntary sector, especially among young people. In this way they are able to raise the profile of local charities working with young and vulnerable people to support their valuable work in strengthening community cohesion."
