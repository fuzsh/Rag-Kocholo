        "text": "The Experience\n\nCity Hall can (and should) be admired from the outside (which isn’t that hard to do, considering that William Penn and the building’s iconic clock can be seen from many spots throughout the city).\n\nBut history buffs, architecture fans, folks who love a good story and anyone interested in a jaw-dropping skyline view (so, everyone?) should find time to hop on a guided tour of one of Philly’s most iconic buildings. Here’s how.\n\nCity Hall Tower Tours\n\nOffered both as part of the interior and exterior tour (see below) and as a standalone option, the City Hall Tower Tour takes you to a glass-enclosed observation deck 500 feet above street level — and just a few feet below the massive bronze statue of William Penn.\n\nThe ascent is a bit of a rustic experience, with four visitors at a time joining an operator inside a small, 100-year-old elevator to reach the top.\n\nThe payoff is more than worth it as you take in rare, 360-degree views of Philadelphia from William Penn’s perspective.\n\nPro tip: After admiring the city view, be sure to look up through openings in the ceiling to examine details of the iconic statue up close.\n\nInterior & Exterior Tours\n\nIn addition to the tower tours, guided tours offer a more comprehensive look at City Hall.\n\nAs you stroll around the perimeter of the building and through the center courtyard, tour guides offer insights and anecdotes about the history of the building, from its prolonged 30-year construction (1871 to 1901) to a gentlemen’s agreement among developers that kept William Penn as the tallest point in the city’s skyline until 1986.\n\n(An ensuing Philly sports curse was reversed when a miniature William Penn statuette was placed atop the Comcast Center in 2007.)\n\nAs you listen, keep your eyes peeled and look up to examine some of the 250 sculptures designed by Alexander Milne Calder.\n\nInside the building, you’ll explore the grandest of its more than 700 rooms. Stops on the tour include the ornate City Council Caucus Room where council members publicly debate and vote on bills — and the lavish Mayor’s Reception Room, which is lined with portraits of the previous mayors in the city’s history.\n\nThe tour ends with a trip to the top of the City Hall Tower, where you’ll experience sweeping, 360-degree views of the city from an enclosed observation deck.\n\nHeads up: The building still serves as the official seat of Philly’s government, so expect a quick trip through a security checkpoint as you enter the building, and keep an eye out for busy staffers."
