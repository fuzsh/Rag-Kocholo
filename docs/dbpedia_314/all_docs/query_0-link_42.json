        "text": "The white horse faces WNW, is near The Ridgeway on the edge of the Marlborough Downs, two miles south east of Broad Hinton village, on Hackpen Hill where the Wootton Bassett to Marlborough road zigzags up the hill.\n\nIt is said to have been cut by Broad Hinton parish clerk Henry Eatwell, in 1838, with the assistance of the landlord of a local pub, to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria.\n\nIt is visible from the main 'A' road to Avebury, from Swindon/Wroughton, and from high ground near the village of Cliffe Pypard to the west. As its not very large, it is best photographed from the road that approaches it, and there are a variety of points along this road where you can see it clearly. As its on quite a shallow slope, although jacked up a little on an embankment, it gets shortened as you approach it.\n\nIts currently in good condition, but at times in the past it has become overgrown, and more difficult to see."
