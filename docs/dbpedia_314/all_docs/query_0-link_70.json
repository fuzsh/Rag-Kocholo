        "text": "Gloucestershire is a county in South West England. The county comprises part of the Cotswold Hills, part of the flat fertile valley of the River Severn, and the entire Forest of Dean.\n\nThe county town is the city of Gloucester, and other principal towns include Cheltenham, Stroud, Cirencester, and Tewkesbury.\n\nWhen considered as a ceremonial county, Gloucestershire borders the preserved county of Gwent in Wales, and in England the ceremonial counties of Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Somerset and Bristol.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nUK WIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES\n\nAll wide area and local Police communications are carried out on the UK wide TETRA network called Airwave using a mixture of Motorola, Sepura and EADS radio terminals. This system replaced their previous 150Mhz AM simulcast wide area and local PR UHF systems. Some historic information can be found here: www.dtels.org/html/site_map.htm\n\nLocal authority NHS Ambulance services use Airwave, replacing their previous wide area 166Mhz and UHF handheld 'incident' radio systems.\n\nLocal authority Fire & Rescue services also use Airwave as their prime method of wide area 'vehicle to control' communications replacing a mixture of FM and AM simulcast systems in the 70Mhz band. At incident Fireground communications are still carried out on simplex UHF frequencies with some cross-band capabilities to Airwave."
