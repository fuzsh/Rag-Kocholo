        "text": "Broad Town is situated two miles from Royal Wotton Bassett and 10 miles from Swindon. Broad Town Primary School and Preschool are central to the village. Villagers from Broad Town and the surrounding villages are able to walk to The Hop Garden (Broad Town Brewery) which opened in 2020 and now thrives on both local and distance customers. Broad Town Garage offers regular car maintenance as well as car sales.\n\nWe are an inclusive village and there are many events going on regularly in the Village Hall such as the WI, Coffee Mornings, Walking Groups, Bumps and Beyond, Dog Training and the Social Club. There are regular Services in the Church. Every year villagers take part in the re-liming of the White Horse and tidying up the Church Yard.\n\nWe have excellent links to the M4 which is 4 miles away and there are many beautiful walks around the area. Royal Wootton Bassett boasts supermarkets, chemists, doctorsâ€™ surgeries, pubs, shops and a weekly Wednesday Market."
