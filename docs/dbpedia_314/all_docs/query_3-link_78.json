        "text": "Broad Town prepares for explosive fun with Felix Festival!\n\nBroad Town prepares for explosive fun with Felix Festival! Broad Town, Swindon – The time has come for the Felix Festival, an event to benefit military personnel and their families.\n\nFelix Fund presents the Felix Festival 2023, taking place at the Hop Chapel located at the Broadtown Brewery, Broad Town, SN4 7RB. This is an exciting event, especially since it’s the first time happening since lockdown, and in a brand-new location! With free camping available starting from September 15th, it’s a fantastic opportunity to enjoy an unforgettable festival experience and enjoy live music from talented artists from 2pm until midnight. In addition, there will be an on-site bar and catering services to keep you refreshed and satisfied and breakfast to help any hangovers on Sunday morning!\n\nNow in its twelfth year, Felix Fund is a charity that is dedicated to providing financial assistance and welfare support to current and former military personnel who have conducted or assisted with EOD & Search operations for the British Military and SO15 EOD & Counter Terrorism Policing. We also extend our assistance to dependent family members and maintain memorials to honour those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n\nThis year’s Felix Festival promises to be bigger and better than ever before, with live bands including Funke and the Two Tone Baby, who are also playing Glastonbury this year, some delicious street food that will satisfy your appetite and limited batch beer, Longest Walk and Rapid Ascent celebrating the work of EOD & Search personnel and Royal Navy Mine Clearance Divers."
