        "text": "Geography is a rich and diverse subject that gives children the opportunity to learn about diverse places, people, resources, environments and the effect of mankind. It inspires a curiosity and fascination about the world from an early age and fosters enthusiasm and a passion for learning. By studying the beauty of Earth and the awesome power of Earth-shaping forces, we can fascinate, inspire and create globally-aware pupils.\n\nWhilst the importance of geographical knowledge is recognised, we also wish to enable children to become lifelong geographers who have the skills and attitudes to continue to appreciate the world around them. Throughout the Geography curriculum at Broad Town, children will learn the Earthâ€™s key physical and human processes. They will deepen their understanding of the interaction between physical and human processes and how these affect landscapes and environments.\n\nOur Forest school activities promote self-esteem, creativity, confidence and independence and often link to the geography national curriculum and foundation stage objectives. Our geography curriculum is supported by a range of exciting activities some which are part of our activity passports. These include, write a tour of your local area and make a treasure map."
