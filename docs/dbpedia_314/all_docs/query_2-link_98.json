They can become projectiles if they are attached to containers that are put into the bailing machine and can pose a threat to recycling workers. Lids can also damage equipment by getting jammed in gears and other workings. One exception: you can recycle metal lids on cans, for example soup cans. Leave these metal lids attached or place them in the bottom of cans and pinch the top of the cans together.\n\nStep on it: You can save space by crushing aluminum cans and plastic containers. Now that you're recycling all that you can, you are going to need the space!\n\nWait Until It's Full: If your bin contains only a few items, do not set it out yet.
