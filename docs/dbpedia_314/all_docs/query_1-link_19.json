        "text": "ON THE THRESHOLD DECEMBER 2018\n\nI spend lots of my time in doorways or waiting on the threshold. Doorways into life when I have the joy of meeting a family wanting their new baby to be christened – joyous time learning from them what becoming a family for the first time or adding another child to their family. The hospitality and kindness of the people I visit is something I treasure, but even with the privilege of walking alongside a child or an adult seeking baptism I’m aware of being on the threshold – this is their story I have the joy of walking with them; it is not my journey.\n\nWith couples wanting to be married whether in the joys of first love or taking the plunge and risk of commitment after past hurt being with people and discovering something about what love means to them and helping them take their courage and go through the doorway of commitment to each other is fun.\n\nAlongside those who are dying and with those who love them is a more painful doorway and one where I am aware that much is hidden from sight. Here too there is privilege in being allowed to wait with other people as they cross this threshold.\n\nSoon, I and the village communities I serve will be in the stable doorway: watching nativity plays; singing carols, preparing for the celebrations of Christmas. This threshold offers us the beginning of a journey with the God who became human in the baby at Bethlehem – I invite you, with me, to step anew through that doorway.\n\nThe Reverend Rachma Abbott Priest in Charge, Woodhill Benefice.\n\nThe Vicarage Clyffe Pypard, SWINDON SN4 7PY. 01793 731134\n\nJOAN THOMSON NEE HATHERALL 1921 – 2018\n\nIt is with sadness that we say farewell to Joan Thompson, one of Broad Town’s longest living residents.\n\nJoan came to Broad Town in 1928 aged 7 years when her family moved here from Swindon. Joan attended the village school and the village church where she became a Sunday School teacher and in 1952 was married to Peter Thomson. Peter was in the RAF and he and Joan spent a few years away from Broad Town before returning with their own family. Joan was still involved with activities in the village. She enjoyed talking to the school children about her memories of the war, was a ‘regular’ at Community and Church Coffee mornings and was still on the church flower rota – she decorated a window for this year’s harvest service. Joan loved writing poetry and many of her poems reflect her love for Broad Town.\n\nJoan’s energy and inspiration will be missed by everyone.\n\nBROAD TOWN PRESCHOOL\n\nInvite residents of Broad Town to our NATIVITY DRESS REHEARSAL on Thursday 13th December at 10am. In the Village Hall.

Our thanks also to Judy Conybeare for producing and installing the memorial wreaths to the fallen men of Broad Town that were displayed so poignantly throughout the village.\n\nCHURCH FLOOR REPAIRS\n\nUnfortunately our proposals for repairs to the Church floor have not been accepted.

If you would like to see what we’ve gathered to date please e-mail us on btresearch71@gmail.com and we will send you a link to the website.\n\nThe website is a work in progress because we know we’re missing some of the details of who is pictured and when the photographs were taken. Can you help fill any of these gaps? As the nights draw in please rummage around your attics and look at your family albums for any Broad Town related pictures. Can you help add new pictures? Or do you have any memories you would like to share?\n\nIf you see us out with cameras standing in peculiar places we’ll be attempting to stand in the same place to take an identical “now” picture to mirror what the original photographer saw.\n\nIf you have any questions or requests please get in touch with Malcolm on 01793 731567 or E-mail btresearch71@gmail.com THANK YOU.\n\nPARISH COUNCIL UPDATE\n\nThe Parish Council would like to thank everyone in the parish for their support this year and to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nParish Steward Scheme.\n\nWe were asked at our November meeting to provide a bit more information on what the parish steward scheme can do for us. Here is an extract from Wiltshire Council’s website - “Parish stewards carry out minor highways work which has been set for them by the local community. They are part of Wiltshire Council's £15m per year highways contract with Ringway Infrastructure Services Limited, which began on April 1st 2016. Since the start of the contract, 20 parish stewards have been recruited and trained to carry out this valued community service. The stewards will serve their own group of parish and town councils in the county, reporting issues and carrying out repairs and maintenance, providing a ‘one stop and done' service. They will prioritise the needs of their patch including roads, pathways, drainage and verge maintenance. Their remit could include painting railings, highways strimming and minor pothole repairs”.\n\nThe principle behind the scheme is that local communities are best placed to identify the smaller maintenance issues that need addressing. We want to ensure that we have a good long list of activity to keep our parish steward busy and regularly visiting Broad Town. If we don’t indicate work to be done he will go elsewhere. So if you see minor repairs required around the Village please send details to the Parish Clerk (broadtownparishclerk@gmail.com), these will be passed onto the Parish Steward for action. Please title your request ‘Parish Steward Work’ and remember the Steward only has access to hand/power tools.\n\nPlay Area – annual independent safety inspection\n\nEvery year we commission an independent safety inspection of the equipment in our Play Area at Redhills. We are very pleased to say that the report found all of the equipment to meet the requirements of the relevant standards. No areas of high risk were reported and the remedial actions required can be completed as part of general maintenance. We would like to thank a very kind volunteer from the village who has offered to attend to the main maintenance areas identified in the report. Thank you!\n\nCouncil Tax Single Person Discount Review\n\nWiltshire Council has started a review of entitlement to the above discount which across the County reduces the tax take by more than £24m a year. The Council will be using a third party to check current applications for the discount so if you do receive a request to complete a new claim form then please do respond. If no response is received from a household then the council tax discount will be ended.\n\nDecember meeting\n\nThe substantive item on the agenda for our December meeting will be budget setting for next year.\n\nThe date of the next Parish Council meeting is Monday 10th December at 6.30pm in the Village Hall. Everyone is welcome and refreshments will be provided. Our January meeting will be on Monday 7th January 2019 at 6.30pm.\n\nTHE FOUR WAYS COMMUNITY PUB, BROAD TOWN VILLAGE HALL\n\nEVERY FRIDAY BAR 9pm-late – PLEASE NOTE NEW OPENING TIME: if there’s enough interest in going back to opening any earlier, we will, but for the last few months we’ve had very few customers before the little hand points at the 9!

More people than you think struggle with the cost of heating. For those of us in the rural villages, we rely on electricity or oil, both of which are expensive and oil purchases mean careful budgeting to afford the cost of filling the tank! Although cheaper, gas is expensive too. It’s wonderful that at this time of year Wiltshire Community Foundation run their Surviving Winter Grants which collects funds from those who would like to donate and ensure that the money is distributed to those in need. See the information in the magazine and please do contact me for more information.\n\nTo be eligible for a grant someone must;\n\nbe considered to live in fuel poverty (spend more than 10% of their annual household income on fuel to keep their home warm and in a 'satisfactory' condition)\n\nbe in receipt of eligible means-tested benefits\n\nAnd fall into one of the categories below;\n\nbe pensionable age and affected by fuel poverty.\n\nbe of working age with a disability or a long-term health condition which affects their ability to keep warm .\n\nbe in receipt of Better 2gether childcare funding for their 2 year old.\n\nPlease get in touch if I can help with any of the above.\n\nAs ever, I am around for general help and support on a wide variety of issues including transport, mobility and safety around the home and reducing the feeling of loneliness. Give me a call on 07557 922020 and leave a message. I will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nEllen Blacker - Health & Wellbeing Champion\n\nMalmesbury, Royal Wootton Bassett and Cricklade Community Areas.\n\nOIL HEATING IN BROAD TOWN AND SURROUNDING VILLAGES\n\nMy name is Ben Davis - my family and I moved to Broad Town just over three years ago.
