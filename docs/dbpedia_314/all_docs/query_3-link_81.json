        "text": "Curiosity can lead you to some incredible places. It’s what called us to Kentucky in 2016 to build a distillery like no other. And we haven’t stopped innovating since. From our glass rickhouses, to our Napa Valley style tour, we’re pushing the boundaries of bourbon like no one has before. Not because we’re particularly fond of bending the rules, but rather to re-imagine what the category could be. One that’s more innovative, transparent and collaborative. Because if you want to create an entirely new bourbon experience, you can never stop exploring. Never stop discovering. Never stand still.\n\nOur award-winning Discovery celebrates the art of blending fine whiskies from all over the world. The Collaborative Series celebrates the art of finishing, working with respected producers of beer, wines, and spirits by aging fine whiskey in their barrels to create truly unique products. And the Origin Series is our 100% estate-distilled bourbon and rye, adding modern twists to traditional recipes.\n\nThe Bardstown Bourbon Company is a trailblazer, pushing boundaries through innovation while honoring the traditional art of making whiskey. Located in the Bourbon Capital of the World, Bardstown Bourbon Co. produces the highest-quality whiskey brands, and was awarded Whiskey Producer of the Year by the prestigious IWSC and swept the 2024 San Francisco World Spirits competition, earning Double Gold medals across our entire product line."
