        "text": "The boys had a great time and can’t wait to come back tomorrow. Think they realise that mummy doesn’t stay with them now! Although it was emotional for me, I knew they were in the best care so please pass on my thanks to Jennie, Tor and the rest of the team. They all made it that much easier for us all. Also, all the joining instructions and info you sent through beforehand were so helpful and really comprehensive. You work so hard and always keep the parents up to speed with what’s going on - pre-school are so lucky to have you. Appreciate the last few months must have been an absolute nightmare for you keeping up with all the government changes and expectations.\n\nI just wanted to say how well organised everything was at pre-school today. Despite all the restrictions you’re all faced with during these strange times it was very reassuring and stress free for us as parents. I appreciate it’s a lot of work for you all and very stressful, it must also be a very anxious time when you all have your own personal concerns surrounding COVID but as ever everyone was professional and put the needs of the children and their families first. That’s why we love Broad Town Pre-School\n\nHello I just wanted to send a quick message about our first day back to pre school since March!! I was a bit nervous as was …… but as soon as we arrived we were greeted my Jennie and I was impressed with all the snack organisation and hand gelling! We were then met at the door by Tor and…..was helped to find her peg etc and was happy to go in by herself! I was instantly put at ease as was ……… and I would like to pass on my thanks to all the staff for their hard work at such difficult times. It is greatly appreciated!! If you could pass on my thanks to the staff that would be fantastic Thank you!\n\nThe staff at Broad Town pre-school made the transition from nursery really easy. It is such a welcoming and friendly place. Our son thoroughly enjoys attending sessions here and the forest school is such a big part of this. We debated about whether 2 years old was too soon to send our son to pre-school but he has settled in so quickly and this is no doubt due to the wonderful staff. Broad Town pre-school: Best decision we could have made!\n\nA friendly and professional childcare setting that is like a second family to my children,. The staff are warm and give a varied amount of activities each day to keep your little ones busy. Both of my children attended, my son spent 2.5 years there full time and loved it. He enjoys the freedom to play outside and use the forest as well.\n\nFrom the second I walked into the classroom at Broad Town Preschool I knew my preschool hunt was over. Not only does the school have a fantastic forest school to encourage children in their love and learning about the outdoors, they have a very organised, thoughtfully set up and well stocked classroom with a variety of play and learning toys and tools. On a practical level the school has a dual layer of security for entry from a locked intercom outside gate followed by an internal gate to the preschool play area, which was very important to us. The staff are an incredible combination of loving, fun, caring, firm and instructive. They value communication and open dialogue with parents and are very supportive not only in transitioning children into a new environment but in keeping parents in the loop of any and all concerns. Our time at Broad Town Preschool sadly cut short by Covid, will forever hold a special place in our family's life as our son was so happy and well nurtured there. They have set the bar high on our expectations for all future school experiences. For us it was a bit out the way to travel to but it was our choice and completely worth it for us to find such a gem for our son. We could not recommend the preschool more\n\nBroad Town Preschool is absolutely amazing. We fell in love with the setting the moment we visited for the first time. The teachers/staff are just incredible. They go out of their way to ensure that the children have the most wonderful time each and every day and couldn’t do any more to ensure the children are happy. Our little boy enjoys every minute whilst at Preschool and has nothing but lovely things to say when he comes out at the end of each day. The teachers are so kind and caring and as a Mother it is obvious how much they care for the children. I couldn’t recommend them/this preschool enough"
