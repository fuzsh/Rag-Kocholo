        "text": "Dutchess County is located in southeastern New York State, between the Hudson River on its west and the New York-Connecticut border on its east, about halfway between the cities of Albany and New York.\n\nDutchess County was one of the first 12 counties that were established in the Province of New York in 1683. Most of the first settlers in Dutchess County were Dutch. Franklin D. Roosevelt lived in his family home in Hyde Park, overlooking the Hudson River. His family's home is now managed by the National Park Service.\n\nMain Industries: Prior to the 1960s, Dutchess County was primarily agricultural. Since then the southwestern part of the county has developed into a largely residential area, with many of its residents commuting to jobs in New York City. The northern and eastern regions of the county are still very much rural with large farmlands.\n\nEducation: Higher Education institutions in Dutches include Bard College, Culinary Institute of America, Dutchess Community College, Marist College, Ridley-Lowell Business & Technical Institute and Vassar College\n\nLand: The terrain of the county is mostly hilly, especially in the Hudson Highlands in the southwestern corner and the Taconic Mountains to the northeast. Almost a half mile long border exists with Berkshire County, Massachusetts in the extreme northern end of the county. There are 3 national protected areas in Dutchess County including: Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site, Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site and the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site."
