        "text": "Centrally located, we are very easy to travel to. Just ten minutes from the M4, you can drive to Bristol or Bath in under an hour and get within the M25 London Orbital in just over an hour. More locally, the market town of Wootten Bassett is 10 minutes away, Marlborough and Calne are 20 minutes and Malmesbury, Tetbury and Cirencester approximately 30 minutes.\n\nGoogle maps is a great way to navigate to us, especially if you use our google listing as we have ensured the location is accurate: https://goo.gl/maps/BZ5yfJqyQkiAd96L6\n\nSat nav with our postcode SN4 7RA will bring you into the hamlet of Cotmarsh, but not onto the farm.\n\nDirections from the M4\n\nCome off Junction 16 of the M4 motorway. Follow signs to Wootten Basset and then Marlborough. About 2 miles outside of Wootten Basset on the Marlborough Road, after you have entered Broad Town, you take a left hand turn. This is a small turning, with a discreet white road sign for ‘Cotmarsh’. Once on the lane to Cotmarsh (go past the entrance to ‘From the Fields’ campsite, this isn’t us). Follow the lane around a sharp left bend and keep driving until the very end, which will bring you through our wooden gate onto the farm.\n\nWe would be grateful if you could drive slowly once on the lane to Cotmarsh. It’s a quiet no through road and we wish to keep the traffic disturbance to our neighbours as minimal as possible. We often have children playing in the yard as you enter the farm too.\n\nPublic Transport"
