        "text": "BROAD U.S.A. is a privately held company headquartered in New Jersey, supporting the sales and service to our customers in North America. Relying on our innovative and environmental-friendly technology, BROAD U.S.A commits itself to optimize energy efficiency for clients in Commercial, Civil and Industrial markets.\n\nBROAD U.S.A. is committed to the Absorption Marketplace – It is our primary business since we started in 1998\n\nBroad is dedicated and focused on ensuring our owners can always find proper training, service and after sale support with replacement parts and or units.\n\nBroad is committed to the inherent value and flexible solutions that thermally driven absorption plays in our modern world.\n\nWe Roll Our Own – Absorbers\n\nAbsorption design is our core competency and primary focus . Unlike many current players in the absorption market, Broad designed and created its first absorber in 1988 with its own human capital, hard work, the desire to be the best.\n\nThis homegrown approach has allowed Broad to continue to innovate and lead as the worldwide customer base has grown to over 80 plus counties.\n\nBroad supports CCHP/Co-generation\n\nBROAD has worked closely with the US Department of Energy (DOE) to assist in some early US-based demonstration deployments of high-efficiency solutions to co-generation heat recovery.\n\nA prime example of this early cooperation was the demonstration site at Fort Bragg in North Carolina “The 82nd Airborne” back in 2001 BROAD USA is an active member of the USCHP and EPA CHP partnership. Broad is assisting in the August 2012 executive order to deploy over 40GW of CHP by 2020.\n\nWhy BROAD Factory Tests Every Chiller as Standard?\n\nEnsures the chiller will yield the operating performance characteristics as designed. It can also be a great opportunity for the operator to learn about the unit which will be cooling or heating the building and to become an expert in the operation of the absorber.\n\nThe only way to really validate that the chiller supplied is meeting the design specification requirements. Field testing can be extremely challenging and expensive to replicate. Lowers risk of “system issues” and eliminates field verification of chiller performance which can be very time intensive and difficult to accomplish.\n\nWhole Unit Testing Platform – Our factory acceptance testing (FAT) facility has over 40 test beds for comprehensive performance tests. It is the largest most advanced whole unit testing platform in the world. Broad testing facility has been certified since 1997.\n\nSetting the Bar High on Standards\n\nBroad Absorbers whether they are simple single stage or ultra-high efficiency multi-energy two stage chillers all are designed to the same Stringent Vacuum Standard. The passing test for the Broad standard helium detection test is 10-8 atmospheres of pressure per cubic centimeter of volume per second an industry best in class.\n\nTube material choice and the impact on the longevity of the absorber coupled with a great design and good vacuum is what a modern absorber is all about. BROAD typically is providing higher quality materials such as “oxygen free copper”, CuNi and thicker walls to ensure the chiller meets it 25-year life design cycle without unplanned and costly re-tubing common in other older absorption designs.\n\nA Brief Introduction of BROAD Town\n\nBROAD Town is the headquarters of BROAD Group. It is located in the eastern suburbs of Changsha City, 16 Km from downtown 12km from the airport. Named as “Broad Tech Park” in 1997, it was the first tech park named after a company in China. It is home to dozens of technological inventions that have impacted the whole world, for instance, the world’s first noe-electric exhaust air conditioning, the world’s first fresh air purification machine, the world’s first factory-made sustainable buildings…\n\nBROAD Town covers an area pf 1km², 0.68km² is reserved as ecological protection zone and organic farm. it is a factory with the least factory features. All residential buildings at 0.25 million m² on the campus have adopted 15-20 cm thermal insulation, 3-4 paned windows, external solar shading and fresh air heat recovery machine. BROAD exports air conditioning to more than 80 countries, yet it seldom uses air conditioning itself.\n\nAt BROAD Town Organic food,self -processed cerels and edible oils, and reverse osmosis water is all available. Staff have no desires to buy vehicles are awarded monthly, and garbage is classified before recycling, What’s more, the grocery here is unattended, dinning-table and floor is so clean that you will not spot a single grain of rice or piece of paper. All rooms enjoy 100% fresh air with PM2.5 be filtered by 99.9%. Theatre, gym,yoga studio, boutique hotel and 44 statues of the most influential are scattered on the campus, marking BROAD Town a harmonious community between the environmental valve and human value.\n\nBROAD Group Introduction\n\nBROAD Group is an enterprise based on the vision of unique technologies and the mission of preserving. All BROAD products and services are subversion of traditional industries, and are essentially optimizing human life and earth’s environment.\n\nBROAD wholly-owns the following subsidiaries:\n\nFounded in 1988, supplies non-electric central air conditioning under built-in vacuum condition powered by natural gas and waste heat and packaged water distribution system. It is world-renowned for super energy efficiency.\n\nFounded in 2005, supplies clean fresh air machine that recovers 80% heat and filters PM2.5 by 99.9%, as well as a complete series of clean air products and air quality monitoring device for commercial to domestic use and wearable for personal use.\n\nFounded in 2007, provides equipment, investment, design, construction and operation of district cooling-heating-power (CHP) projects, and pursues the greatest extent of energy conservation through market mechanism.\n\nFounded in 2009, supplies ultimate structural material for construction and transportation sectors, i.e. CTS slab, truly bringing about a sustainable development path for human being.\n\nBROAD Group was established in 1988, hardhearted in Changsha, Hunan, China and has products in more than 80 counties.\n\nBROAD ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HISTORY\n\nYear Events 1992 Invented China’s first CFC-free direct-fired non-electric air conditioning 1997 Invented the world’s first plate heat exchanger for non-electric air conditioning with energy efficiency increased by 40% 1998 Release the BROAD Declaration , advocating “fighting against low energy efficiency and material waste to the fullest, extending product lifespan to the longest” Pesticide and fertilizer prohibited in BROAD Town Implemented the water and electricity metering systems for BROAD staff 1999 Invented the world’s first non-electric zero emission air conditioning powered by exhaust gas from turbine Recommended low-load design to customers in product brochures to advocate energy conservation even at the risk of receiving complaints 2002 BROAD Organic Farm was developed to provide organic food to staff 2003 Released the BROAD Values to advocate “environmental protection is more important than profit” 2004 Invented the world’s first Packaged Water Distribution System with operational energy decreased by 70-85% for cooling water and chilled water Initiated the annual energy consumption check policy for all customers with open reports The world’s first company to take dispute risk by showing energy efficiency on chiller’s control panel 2005 Translated and published 250,000 copies of YouthXchange , an environment guideline of UNEP 2006 Translated & published the 780-page Living in the Environment , an English environment encyclopedia 2008 China’s first thoroughly-renovated community with all buildings at BROAD Town retrofitted with 15cm thermal insulation, 3-paned windows, external solar shading and heat recovery fresh air Invented the world’s first clean fresh air machine, recovering exhaust heat by 80% and filtering PM2.5 by 99.9% 2009 Invented the world’s first factory-made sustainable building (BSB) that saves energy by 80% Invented the world’s first Life Phone (Air Monitor) to detect PM2.5, CO2, etc. Completely replaced detergent with caustic soda and adopted reverse osmosis water as drinking water at BROAD Town 2010 Provided central air conditioning system and operation services to all 250 pavilions at World Expo Shanghai, cutting 73,000 tons of CO2 emissions, which equals to planting 4 million trees Built a sustainable building demo for The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16, Cancun) 2011 BROAD chairman was awarded the “Champions of the Earth” by the UN for his contributions to energy conservation 2012 UN Secretary General cited BROAD as the only energy conservation case in the “RIO +20 Declaration” The Oval Mountain Organic Farm was built in Xiangyin County, gradually increase the food organic rate of staff to 80% Launched the 8-catergory garbage sorting system. Low Carbon Commute Incentives for Staff was carried out to encourage car-free staff 2013 BSB was awarded the CTBUH (Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat) Innovation Award for its contribution to innovative environmental conservation Installed solar panels for all factory roofs (230,000 m2) in BSB factory 2014 BROAD chairman was awarded the World’s Top 25 Eco-Innovators by Fortune Magaine BROAD Recycled Oil Company obtained the qualification to utilize 30% of national waste mineral oil 2015 To make building an eternal wealth, BROAD started the invention of core tubular stainless steel slab and stopped production of steel structure during the same year 2016 To extend the lifespan of air-conditioning to 60 years and extend the lifespan of heat exchange tube to unlimited , BROAD replaced brass heat exchange tubes and stainless steel heat exchange tubes with titanium tubes\n\nThe core values of BROAD include responsibility to our environment which nurtures us, responsibility to humanity which inspires us, responsibility to our customers who support us, and responsibility to our employees who dedicate their energy and creativity for all of us.\n\nFor the environment, everything we do is from the perspective of sustainability: Increasing energy efficiency, reducing energy consumption, reducing energy costs, and reducing consumption of materials.\n\nFor humanity, sustainability is wired into the DNA of the full spectrum of BROAD’s diverse product lines: Non-electric chillers, sustainable structural material, clean air machines, prefabricated negative pressure rooms, and many other products. BROAD reduces our customers’ carbon footprint, and charts the way to a future of sustainable cooling and heating, building construction, and air purification.\n\nFor our customers, we aim to be an enterprise one is proud to do business with. For many companies, perhaps profit is most valued. At BROAD, our aim is to be distinguished by excellence in products and service: to conceive of and make products no one else can make, and to offer a level of service no one else can provide. So what sort of enterprise does that make us?\n\nIn an era of social transformation plagued by vague moral standards\n\nBROAD adheres to the “Principle of 7 Nos and 1 Without”: No environmental pollution, no technology theft, no cheating, no vicious competition, no chain debt, no tax dodging, no bribery, and without malicious conscience. BROAD believes morals are more important than competition, and responsibility is more important than growth.\n\nHow are our values reflected in our core product lines?\n\nIn our era of global warming, environmental deterioration, and ozone depletion, BROAD continues to innovate and invest in our absorption chiller, now in the 12th generation, to capture waste heat for power and contribute zero ozone depletion, because we believe that environmental protection is more important than profit.\n\nIn our era of deteriorating air quality, BROAD has abandoned our ROI model and invested huge sums in air purification systems that provide 100% fresh air with no recycled air, unlike the 70% return air/30% fresh air of most conventional air handlers. In our era of pandemic caused by COVID-19, BROAD has developed a Negative Pressure Isolation (NPI) facility by combining our expertise in prefabricated stainless steel buildings with our air purification prowess to develop a treatment center than can be built in days, and protects medical staff and enables them to treat patients in the safest environment possible. Another innovating product others cannot make, backed by service others cannot provide, because we believe that human health is more important than profit this year or next.\n\nIn our era of accelerating urbanization, BROAD has brought for a new structural material made of hardened stainless steel: B-CORE. Tall buildings can now be built without concrete or carbon steel, which together account for over 12% of total global emissions. B-CORE challenges conventional building traditions, providing the more energy efficient, healthiest buildings which have an almost unlimited lifespan as stainless steel is so non-corrosive. BROAD poured huge investments into this technology, because the future of the human race is more important than the future of us an individuals.\n\nEvery day, BROAD aims to demonstrate our loyalty to our customers, fairness to our vendors, and dedication to our employees. Long term relationships are more important than gains or losses."
