        "text": "National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data systems are often used to study the associations between urbanization level of residence and health and to monitor the health of urban and rural residents. NCHS has developed a six-level urban-rural classification scheme for U.S. counties and county-equivalent entities. The most urban category consists of “central” counties of large metropolitan areas and the most rural category consists of nonmetropolitan “noncore” counties. Three versions of the NCHS scheme are available:\n\n2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties which is based on the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) February 2013 delineation of metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (derived according to the 2010 OMB standards for defining these areas) and Vintage 2012 postcensal estimates of the resident U.S. population;\n\n2006 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties which is based on the OMB’s December 2005 delineation of MSAs and micropolitan statistical areas (MISA) (derived according to the 2000 OMB standards for defining these areas) and Vintage 2004 postcensal estimates of the resident U.S. population), and\n\n1990 census-based NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties which is based on the OMB’s June 1993 delineation of MSAs (derived according to the 1990 OMB standards for defining these areas) and 1990 census data.\n\nThe levels of the NCHS scheme were chosen for their utility in studying health differences across the urban-rural continuum. The NCHS scheme has more metropolitan levels (four) than nonmetropolitan levels (two) because the large U.S. metropolitan population (in 2010, about 85% of the U.S. population) can support more levels for health analyses than the relatively small nonmetropolitan population.\n\nThe basic framework of the three schemes is the same. However, while the classification rules used to assign counties to the six urban-rural categories are the same for the 2013 and 2006 NCHS schemes, they differ somewhat from those used for the 1990 census-based scheme.\n\nA key feature of the NCHS urban-rural scheme, which makes it particularly well-suited for health analyses, is that it separates counties within large metropolitan areas (1 million or more population) into two categories: large “central” metro (akin to inner cities) and large “fringe” metro (akin to suburbs). This is an important feature of the NCHS urban-rural scheme because for a number of health measures, residents of large fringe metro areas fare substantially better than residents of other urbanization levels. For these measures, residents of the inner cities and suburbs of large metropolitan areas must be differentiated to obtain an accurate characterization of health disparities across the full urban-rural spectrum.\n\nThe report 2013 NCHS Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [PDF – 2.5 MB] details development of the 2013 NCHS scheme and provides some examples o the scheme’s application to mortality data and to health measures from the National Health Interview Survey. The report also compares the 2013 and 2006 NCHS schemes.\n\nThe report NCHS Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [PDF – 1.3 MB] details development of the 2006 NCHS scheme and provides some examples of the scheme’s application to mortality data and to health measures from the National Health Interview Survey. The report also describes the 1990 census-based NCHS scheme.\n\n2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\nMetropolitan counties: Large central metro counties in MSA of 1 million population that: 1) contain the entire population of the largest principal city of the MSA, or 2) are completely contained within the largest principal city of the MSA, or 3) contain at least 250,000 residents of any principal city in the MSA.\n\nLarge fringe metro counties in MSA of 1 million or more population that do not qualify as large central Medium metro counties in MSA of 250,000-999,999 population.\n\nSmall metro counties are counties in MSAs of less than 250,000 population.\n\nNonmetropolitan counties: Micropolitan counties in micropolitan statistical area; Noncore counties not in micropolitan statistical areas data access website.\n\n2006 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\nMetropolitan counties: Large central metro counties are counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) of 1 million or more population that 1) contain the entire population of the largest principal city of the MSA, or 2) are completely contained in the largest principal city of the MSA, or 3) contain at least 250,000 residents of any principal city of the MSA. Large fringe metro counties are counties in MSAs of 1 million or more population that do not qualify as large central. Medium metro counties are counties in MSAs of 250,000 to 999,999 population. Small metro counties are counties in MSAs of less than 250,000 population.\n\nNonmetropolitan counties: Micropolitan counties are counties in micropolitan statistical areas. Non-core counties are nonmetropolitan counties that are not in a micropolitan statistical area.\n\nUse of the Urban-Rural Classification with Natality and Mortality Files\n\nThe NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties should only be used with data files where all counties are identified. For example prior to 2005, standard mortality and natality public-use files did not identify counties with populations less than 100,000. For 2005-present, the public use mortality files have no geographic detail. Specifically, the county FIPS codes for counties with populations less than 100,000 are not provided on these files; instead all of these counties are assigned the same geographic code for “balance of state.” Because there are counties with populations less than 100,000 in all of the urban-rural categories except the large central metro category, it is not possible to compute birth and death rates by urbanization level using the standard natality and mortality public-use files. Access to mortality and natality files with all counties identified currently requires NAPHSIS and NCHS approval of the project and the signing of a data use agreement.\n\nData Files and Documentation\n\n2013 NCHS Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [PDF – 2.5 MB]\n\n2006 and 1990 NCHS Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties [PDF – 1.3 MB]\n\nCounty Geography [PDF – 136 KB]\n\nFile Documentation [PDF – 158 KB]\n\nNCHSurbruralcodes [XLS – 175 KB]\n\nNCHSurbruralcodes [SAS7BDAT – 512 KB]\n\nContact"
