        "text": "With rolling hills and stunning countryside, the area around Swindon is home to a variety of beautiful villages and towns. It is no surprise that people from all over the country rush to visit the area each year.\n\nOne such place less than an hour from Swindon up the A420 is Abingdon in Oxfordshire, also known as the birthplace of famous rock band Radiohead.\n\nRadiohead are an English rock band formed was formed in the historic market town. The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys, OxfordshireLive reports.\n\nRead next: Beautiful village with a chocolate factory and pub\n\nFormed in 1985, the band consists of Thom Yorke, brothers Jonny Greenwood and Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien and Philip Selway. The guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and the bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year; the guitarist Ed O'Brien and the drummer Philip Selway the year above; and Colin's brother, the multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, two years below.\n\nAbingdon-on-Thames, more commonly known as Abingdon, is a historic market town and civil parish in the ceremonial county of Oxfordshire, England, on the River Thames. The area was occupied from the early to middle Iron Age and the remains of a late Iron Age and Roman defensive enclosure lies below the town centre.\n\nAbingdon is 9 miles south of Oxford and 26 miles north-east of Swindon in the flat valley of the Thames on its west bank. Boasting great transport links to Oxfordshire's major motorways, the town is on the A415 between Witney and Dorchester, adjacent to the A34 trunk road, linking it with the M4 and M40 motorways.\n\nDespite these connections, Abingdon no longer has a rail service. However, in recent years, urban expansion has brought Radley railway station close to town's north-eastern limits. In more recent developments, the town centre of Abingdon was renovated in 2012 as part of the council's redevelopment plan.\n\nGot a story to share or an issue for us to investigate?
