        "text": "Welcome to Andover Township, New Jersey\n\nAndover Townshipâs message is \"Experience the Good Life\". We are proud to offer a fine quality of life and work hard to maintain that designation. Andover Townshipâs 21 square miles of beautiful country life is home to just 6,500 residents. Although rural in nature, we are located only 40 miles northwest of NYC, and have quick access to major thoroughfares, enabling residents and businesses to connect to a third of the United States population in one day's drive. We are working diligently to insist the best internet services are provided for the telecommuter, home business owner and of most recent, the virtual classroom.\n\nOur Township is full of locally owned and operated businesses. In fact, we have more than 100 businesses in our community, ranging from technology, medical professionals, financial advisors and institutions to auto shops, health food stores and farms. We are proud to offer family owned restaurants featuring everything from bagels to pizza to fine dining. A farm to table program has also been established, including local artisan bread, cheeses and produce. Additionally, we are located within 10 minutes of a state-of-the-art hospital and have convenience to five supermarkets within a 15-minute drive."
