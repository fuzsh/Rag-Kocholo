        "text": "City in Burlington County, New Jersey, US\n\nFor the township, see Bordentown Township, New Jersey.\n\nCity in New Jersey\n\nBordentown is a city in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 3,993,[10] an increase of 69 (+1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 3,924,[19][20] which in turn reflected a decline of 45 (−1.1%) from the 3,969 counted in the 2000 census.[21]\n\nBordentown is located at the confluence of the Delaware River, Blacks Creek, and Crosswicks Creek. The latter is the border between Burlington and Mercer counties. Bordentown is the northernmost municipality in New Jersey that is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.[22] It sits about one-third of the distance from Center City, Philadelphia to Midtown Manhattan; it is located 5.8 miles (9.3 km) south of the state capital Trenton, 27 miles (43 km) northeast of Center City Philadelphia, and 54 miles (87 km) southwest of New York City.\n\nBordentown's first recorded European settlement was made in 1682 in what became known as Farnsworth's Landing and, after 1717, the town that had developed in the Provence of New Jersey was renamed to Borden's Town. After the American Revolution and the establishment of the New Jersey state government, Bordentown was incorporated with a borough government form by an act of its legislature on December 9, 1825, from portions within Chesterfield Township. It was reincorporated with a city government form on April 3, 1867, and it was separated from Chesterfield Township about 1877.[23]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas Farnsworth, an English Quaker, became the first European settler in the Bordentown area in 1682, when he moved his family upriver from Burlington. He made a new home on the windswept bluff overlooking the broad bend in the Delaware River, near today's northwest corner of Park Street and Prince Street, perhaps where an 1883 frame house now stands. \"Farnsworth Landing\" soon became the center of trade for the region.[24] Farnsworth is also the namesake of one of Bordentown's main streets, Farnsworth Avenue.\n\nJoseph Borden, for whom the city is named,[25][26] arrived in 1717, and by May 1740 founded a transportation system to carry people and freight between New York City and Philadelphia. This exploited Bordentown's natural location as the point on the Delaware River that provided the shortest overland route to Perth Amboy, from which cargo and people could be ferried to New York City.[27] The town was the childhood home of Patience Wright, America's first female sculptor, who lived there in the 1730s.\n\nBy 1776, Bordentown was full of Patriots. Joseph Borden's son (also named Joseph Borden) became a colonel during the American Revolutionary War. Other noted patriots lived in the area, including Thomas Paine. Francis Hopkinson (a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence), Colonel Kirkbride, and Colonel Oakey Hoagland. Hessian troops briefly occupied Bordentown in 1776 as part of the New York and New Jersey campaign before leaving to engage in the Battle of Iron Works Hill on December 23. On May 8, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, British forces raided Bordentown in pursuit of retreating American militiamen. The Redcoats burned several Bordentown buildings along with large quantities of American military supplies and several ships in the nearby waters. On June 23, 1778, British forces again raided Bordentown, destroying several buildings.[28]\n\nIn August 1831, master mechanic Isaac Dripps of Bordentown re-assembled (without blueprints or instructions) the locomotive John Bull (originally called \"The Stevens\") in just 10 days. It was built by Robert Stephenson and Company, in England, and was imported into Philadelphia by the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The next year it started limited service, and the year after that regular service, to become one of the first successful locomotives in the United States. The John Bull is preserved at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[29]\n\nAnother notable resident of Bordentown is Clara Barton, who started the first free public school in New Jersey in 1852. Barton later founded the American Red Cross.[30] A recreation of her schoolhouse stands at the corner of Crosswicks and Burlington streets.[31]\n\nIn 1866, Susan Waters moved into what is now one of the larger properties on Mary Street. This was a base from which she taught and produced over 50 of her works, many of which are painting of animals in natural settings and pastoral scenes. She was also an early photographer. In 1876 she was asked to exhibit several of her works at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.[32]\n\nIn 1881, Rev. William Bowen purchased the old Spring Villa Female Seminary building (built on land purchased from the Bonapartes in 1837) and reopened it as the Bordentown Military Institute. In 1886, African-American Rev. Walter A. Rice established a private school for African-American children, the Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, in a two-story house at 60 West Street, which later moved to Walnut Street on the banks of the Delaware, and became a public school in 1894 under Jim Crow laws. The school, which was known as the Bordentown School, came to have a 400-acre (1.6 km2), 30-building campus with two farms, a vocational/ technical orientation, and a college preparatory program.[33] The Bordentown School operated from 1894 to 1955.\n\nIn 1909, the religious order Poor Clares established a convent in the former Motherhouse of the Sisters of Mercy on Crosswicks Street. The building still stands and is used as an assisted living community called The Clare Estate. The Order of Poor Clares moved to a new facility outside Bordentown City.[34]\n\nJoseph Bonaparte\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral years after the banishing of his family from France in 1816, arriving under vigilant disguise as the Count de Survilliers, Joseph Bonaparte,[35] former King of Naples and Spain and brother to Napoleon I of France, purchased the Point Breeze Estate near Bordentown from American revolutionary, Stephen Sayre.[36] He lived there for 17 years, entertaining guests of great fame such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and the future 6th U.S. President, John Quincy Adams. The residents of Bordentown nicknamed the Count, \"The Good Mr. Bonaparte\" (Good to distinguish him from his younger brother). He built a lake near the mouth of Crosswicks Creek that was about 200 yards (200 m) wide and 1⁄2 mile (800 m) long. On the bluff above it he built a new home, \"Point Breeze\".[37] The current Divine Word Mission occupies its former site along Park Street.[38]\n\nToday only vestiges of the Bonaparte estate remain. Much of it is the remains of a formerly Italinate building remodeled in English Georgian Revival style in 1924 for Harris Hammon, who purchased the estate at Point Breeze as built in 1850 by Henry Becket, a British consul in Philadelphia. In addition to the rubble of this mansion and some hedges of its elaborate gardens, only the original tunnel to the river (broken through in several places) and the house of Bonaparte's secretary remain. Many descendants of Joachim Murat, King of Naples and brother in law of the Bonapartes executed in 1815, also were born or lived in Bordentown, having followed their uncle Joseph there. After the Bonaparte dynasty was restored by Napoleon III, they moved back to France and were recognized as princes.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 0.97 square miles (2.52 km2), including 0.93 square miles (2.42 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of water (4.02%).[1][2]\n\nThe City of Bordentown is surrounded on three sides by Bordentown Township and on the western side by the juncture of the Delaware River and Crosswicks Creek, which is the border with Hamilton Township in Mercer County.[39][40][41] It is bounded on the east by U.S. Route 130 and U.S. Route 206, on the south by Black's Creek and Interstate 295, and on the north by the Mile Hollow Run. Across the Delaware River is Falls Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18502,725—18601,130−58.5%18804,258—18904,232−0.6%19004,110−2.9%19104,2503.4%19204,3712.8%19304,4050.8%19404,223−4.1%19505,49730.2%19604,974−9.5%19704,490−9.7%19804,441−1.1%19904,341−2.3%20003,969−8.6%20103,924−1.1%20203,9931.8%2023 (est.)4,021[11]0.7%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 3,924 people, 1,859 households, and 922 families in the city.

The restaurants are primarily Italian, but there are also restaurants and diners that specialize in American food, Chinese food, and more recently Japanese and Latin-American food.[54]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nBordentown has been governed under the Walsh Act since 1913. The city is one of 30 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this commission form of government.[55] The governing body is comprised of three commissioners, one of whom is selected to serve as Mayor. Each commissioner is assigned a specific department to oversee during their term in office. Members are elected at-large to four-year concurrent terms of office on a non-partisan basis as part of the May municipal election.[7][56][57]\n\nAs of 2024 , Bordentown's commissioners are Mayor Jennifer L. Sciortino (Director of Revenue and Finance), Deputy Mayor Joe Myers (Director of Public Property, Streets and Water) and Commissioner Heather Cheesman (Director of Public Safety and Affairs; appointed to an unexpired term), all serving terms of office that end on May 13, 2025.[3][58]\n\nIn March 2024, the commissioners appointed Heather Cheesman to fill the seat that had been held by James E. Lynch Jr., until he resigned from office; Cheeseman will serve on an interim basis until the November 2024 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.[59]\n\nThe city's municipal complex is located on the site of the Point Breeze estate. Part of the site was purchased by the city in 2020 from the Divine Word Missionaries who occupied the 60-acre (24-hectare) site previously. The repurposed building opened in August 2022. The former city hall was located at 324 Farnsworth Avenue.[60][61]\n\nEmergency services\n\n[edit]\n\nHope Hose Humane Fire Company 1 dates its founding to 1767, making it the nation's second-oldest volunteer fire service, having taken its current name from the combination in 1976 of the Hope Hose and the Humane fire companies.[62]\n\nConsolidated Fire Association dates back to the 1966 merger of three separate volunteer fire companies.[63]\n\nEnvironmental Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bordentown City Environmental Commission (BCEC) is a volunteer group of Bordentown City residents. The Commission is an official body, and its chair answers to the Mayor. The BCEC advises local officials and the Planning Board regarding environmental issues and is a watchdog for environmental problems and opportunities. It is designed to inform elected officials and the public, serve on committees, research issues, develop educational programs and advocate for sound environmental policies. Local issues include preservation of open space, promoting walking and bicycling trails and the River Line, protection of wetlands and water quality, recycling and energy conservation, and environmental education.[64]\n\nThe BCEC's most current efforts have focuses upon a bicycle and pedestrian circulation study, the City's open space plan, and the development of a set of local greenways (Thorntown and Black Creek).\n\nState government facilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe New Jersey Juvenile Justice Commission operates two juvenile detention centers in the Johnstone Campus in Bordentown: Johnstone Campus Juvenile Female Secure Care and Intake Facility, which houses the state's adjudicated girls,[65] and Juvenile Medium Security Facility-North Compound (JMSF-N) and the Juvenile Medium Security Facility-South Compound (JMSF-S) for boys.[66]\n\nFederal, state and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nBordentown City is located in the 3rd Congressional District[67] and is part of New Jersey's 7th state legislative district.[68][69][70] Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 census, Bordentown City had been in the 30th state legislative district.[71] Prior to the 2010 Census, Bordentown City had been part of the 4th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[71]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 3rd congressional district is represented by Andy Kim (D, Moorestown).[72] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[73] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[74][75]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 7th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Troy Singleton (D, Palmyra) and in the General Assembly by Herb Conaway (D, Moorestown) and Carol A. Murphy (D, Mount Laurel).[76]\n\nBurlington County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of five members who are chosen at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year; at an annual reorganization meeting, the board selects a director and deputy director from among its members to serve a one-year term.[77] As of 2024 , Burlington County's Commissioners are: Director Felicia Hopson (D, Willingboro Township, 2024),[78] Tom Pullion (D, Edgewater Park, 2026),[79] Allison Eckel (D, Medford, 2025),[80] Deputy Director Daniel J. O'Connell (D, Delran Township, 2024)[81] and Balvir Singh (D, Burlington Township, 2026).[82][77][83][84][85][86]\n\nBurlington County's Constitutional Officers are: Clerk Joanne Schwartz (D, Southampton Township, 2028)[87][88] Sheriff James H. Kostoplis (D, Bordentown, 2025)[89][90] and Surrogate Brian J.
