        "text": "MDP have prepared and submitted outline planning for the erection of one, self-build dwelling and associated infrastructure at land to the rear of the client’s property in Broad Town, Swindon.\n\nThe site is located in the village of Broad Town, which is 3 miles from Royal Wootton Bassett, 6 miles from Swindon and 16 miles from Chippenham. The village itself lies on the edge of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, however the site in question does not fall within this designation.\n\nThe rectangular shaped site, which comprises amenity grassland, scattered trees herbaceous borders, scattered trees, and two ponds is roughly 0.16 hectares in size. It is what is referred to as a ‘backland’ site and sits to the rear of an existing property on a residential street in the village, with curtilage on three sides.\n\nThe layout options of the proposed development were carefully considered to ensure effective and efficient use of the site, whilst not infringing on the countryside or the neighbouring properties. Multiple options have been provided to the Local Planning Authority to show the potential use of the development site. One of these is a 3-bedroom bungalow with private garden and parking. The details of the design regarding appearance, landscaping, layout and scale are intended to be discussed and agreed at a later time by means of a formal submission or by revised plans ahead of a decision. The matter in hand for the Local Authority is to decide on whether it would be appropriate and beneficial for the ‘backland’ to be used to develop a single dwelling.\n\nMDP worked with a team of experts to ensure a strong case was put to the Local Authority. It was argued that it would be beneficial to create a design-led home, that was respectful to the surrounding environment and neighbours and that also provided a self-build plot that will assist in meeting registered local demand.\n\n​\n\nThe outline planning application has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority and MDP awaits the outcome."
