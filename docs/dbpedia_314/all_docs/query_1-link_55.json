        "text": "Wiltshire\n\nWiltshire's records were created from a combination of transcripts created from the parish registers and bishop's transcripts held by the Wiltshire Record Office, transcripts created by the Wiltshire Family History Society, and the Philimore marriage registers.\n\nWiltshire is a largely agricultural county in South West England. A landlocked county, it is bordered by the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire. Salisbury Plain is known for being the location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites. The county is named after the former county town of Wilton, which itself is named after the River Wyle.\n\nBelow we have provided parish lists for all the Wiltshire parish records. The lists are organised by event. The years ranges provided for each parish may contain gaps. Please note that there are some near-duplicates due to changes in parish names over the years and in variations of how a given parish name was transcribed. Check for all variants of a parish name if searching by place.\n\nBaptisms\n\nBanns\n\nMarriages"
