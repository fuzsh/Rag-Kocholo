        "text": "Marlborough, town (parish), administrative and historic county of Wiltshire, southern England. It lies on the River Kennet in a valley of the chalky Marlborough Downs (hills).\n\nTraces of Neolithic and Roman occupation have been found in the vicinity of the Castle Mound, former site of an 11th-century royal castle. John, later king, was married at the castle chapel in 1189. He granted the town its first charter in 1204; the present charter dates from 1575. During the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century, the town, which supported Parliament, was besieged and captured. In 1653 a great fire destroyed much of Marlborough, and other fires occurred in 1679 and 1690, but the present broad High Street is still flanked with houses dating from the 16th century.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAnother Great British Vocabulary Quiz, Innit?"
