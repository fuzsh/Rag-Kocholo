        "text": "All recorded crimes and anti-social behaviour on or near Broad Town Road since recording started in 2010\n\nThe published data includes the month in which the crime was recorded, the crime category and, where known, the outcome.\n\nAnti-social behaviour is included for recording purposes only, it is not followed up with an investigation and hence has no outcome.\n\nPlease note that crime locations were refreshed in 2022, so crime before and after that date may not be directly comparable. Older crimes are also often missing outcome data, so you should not assume that the lack of an outcome indicates that there was no resolution."
