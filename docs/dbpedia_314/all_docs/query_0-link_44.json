        "text": "Swindon\n\nSwindon is the ideal area to spend quality time with friends and family. From visiting Swindon’s Designer Outlet to attending Wyvern Theatre, Swindon’s oldest entertainment facility. For trainspotters and history lovers, the award-winning Steam Museum of GWR‘s trains and social history exhibitions is great for a family day out. We also encourage our outdoor-loving residents and their guests to head to Stanton Country Park. It’s a wide open space designed for kids to play in, with park tea rooms and a farmhouse kitchen garden for adults to enjoy. The Stanton House Hotel, which is close to the renowned lake, is also nearby for refreshment stops.\n\nAnother year-round family favourite is Roves Farm. Voted Travellers Choice 2022 by TripAdvisor, here you can meet & feed the animals in Pets Corner, hop on a tractor ride, sit and relax with a cup of tea and homemade cake from the tearoom, and explore the indoor play barn or outdoor adventure play. Lydiard Park is another Travellers Choice for Trip Advisor 2022. This beautiful historic estate on the western edge of Swindon offers a Palladian House, Church and Walled Garde. Set in 260 acres of parkland with a children’s play area, café, events and education programmes make it a great destination for a family day out. Swindon is also famous for its amazing range of outdoor spaces, including Coate Water Country Park and Lydiard Park. This diverse, modern town is steeped in heritage and holds an abundance of beautiful places to explore.\n\nBath\n\nBuilt for pleasure and relaxation, Bath has so much to offer, with breathtaking countryside, magnificent Georgian architecture, and a thriving food and drink scene. Accessible to wheelchair users and tries to be as inclusive as possible for people with sensory impairment, our first recommendation for residents and loved ones is The Roman Baths. The Roman Baths are one of the finest historic sites in Northern Europe, where visitors can explore the complex, walk on the original Roman pavements and see the ruins of the Temple of Sulis Minerva. Bath celebrates its most famous resident, Jane Austen in the The Jane Austen Centre. Set in a classically decorated Georgian townhouse, visitors experience a snapshot of life during Regency times and explore how living in this magnificent city affected Jane Austen and her writing.\n\nAnother favourite tourist spot is Sally Lunn’s, which is situated in Bath’s oldest house. This little tea room and restaurant are famed for birthing a certain kind of hybrid teacake that’s part bread bun, part cake, and much loved by both residents of Bath and its visitors. Bath Abbey offers visitors a moment of stillness; a space that’s alive with music and prayer, art and history, where awe-inspiring architecture lifts the eyes and raises the spirit. Accessible by car in just one hour from Blunsdon St Andrew, Bath is the perfect place to explore some of the prettiest countrysides England has to offer.\n\nOxford\n\nOxford, an elegant city in central southern England; whether you are visiting Oxford for the first or tenth time, there is always something new to discover. A masterpiece of Baroque architecture, landscaped Parkland and stunning Formal Gardens, Blenheim Palace is a must visit. Here, visitors can explore over 2000 acres of parkland, 90 acres of award-winning Formal Gardens, and ride the miniature train to The Pleasure Gardens, which leads you to a dedicated family area that offers a giant hedge maze, butterfly house, and adventure playground. A year-round calendar of tours, exhibitions, experiences, and events make this an ideal place to visit again and again. The Ashmolean is the University of Oxford’s museum of art and archaeology, founded in 1683. Britain’s first public museum holds world-famous collections ranging from Egyptian mummies to contemporary art, telling human stories across cultures and across time.\n\nOxford is an inspiring city filled with stunning architecture, history, and culture. This exciting city has something for everyone, from ancient and modern colleges, fascinating museums, and galleries to plenty of parks, gardens, and green spaces in which to relax. Oxford is also home to Oxford Castle & Prison, where you can explore 1,000 years of history and step back in time with their costumed guided tours and see fascinating stories come to life. Residents and families are able to visit Oxford in under one hour from Ridgeway Rise Care Home."
