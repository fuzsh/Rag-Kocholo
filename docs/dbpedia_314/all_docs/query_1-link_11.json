        "text": "It is now well maintained, but this was not always the case. This horse was nearly lost at one time, and this was the nearest of the white horses to where I grew up in North Wiltshire, and I remember visiting it when it was very difficult to find. In 1991 the Broad Town White Horse Restoration Society was formed, and they restored the horse and continue to regularly scour it.\n\nAlthough visible for a number of miles, its not seen by as many people as most as it is away from any major roads. I must admit I haven't visited many of these villages since it has been so well maintained. From the top of the hill you have really good views and in the past I took groups of teenagers there to teach them map reading, as a part of the Duke Of Edinburgh award scheme.\n\nThere are three versions as to how this horse originally came about:-\n\nI have seen, \"It is on land which once belonged to Little Town Farm. According to Rev. Plenderleath, writing in 1885, it was cut in 1864 by a William Simmonds, who held the farm then. Simmonds claimed later that it had been his intention to enlarge the horse gradually over the years, but he had to give up the farm and so did not have the opportunity. It is difficult to imagine exactly what he had in mind; take a drawing of a horse and expand it by enlarging the outline, and the more one enlarges it the less the result resembles the original.\"\n\nAlso that, \"A letter appeared in the Morning Post in September 1919 from the curator of the folklore section of the Imperial War Museum, who stated that in his childhood in Wootton Bassett in 1863, he visited with another fellow across a great valley to the cliff on which the horse is cut. When we got there, we set to work with a number of tools which we had brought to scour the white horse. He also states that the horse was about fifty years old.\"\n\nThe third is that it was cut 1896 by Mr Horsey, Horsley or Hussey ."
