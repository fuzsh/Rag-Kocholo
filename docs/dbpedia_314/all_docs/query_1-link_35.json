        "text": "Situated just outside the charming rural hamlet of Clyffe Pypard, and Broad Hinton, Nonesuch Farm enjoys an elevated position and offers easy access to a number of market towns including Marlborough. The High Street at Marlborough is one of the widest in the UK and is lined by beautiful old buildings. The town displays the confidence of wealth from times past, yet today stays vibrant and progressive with its own chic restaurant and café culture and many independent shops – recently ranked as the second best place to shop in England. Swindon, Bath, Bristol, Cheltenham and Gloucester are the main regional centres and are all within daily commuting distance. Junction 16 of the M4 is about 7.5 miles distant and there are direct services to London Paddington from Swindon, scheduled to take from 55 minutes.\n\nWiltshire is renowned for its excellent selection of state and independent schools. Local private schools include Marlborough College, Pinewood School, St. Mary’s Calne, St Margarets Prep School, Dauntsey’s School, Cheltenham College, Cheltenham Ladies College and Bath schools. Additionally, there are a number of local primary and state schools.\n\nNonesuch Farm is situated in a tranquil and secluded location, nestled among open rolling agricultural fields, offering breath-taking views of the Marlborough Downs. This charming property consists of a picturesque cottage from the mid-17th century and a well-appointed brick barn conversion providing ancillary accommodation.\n\nBuilt with painted brick exteriors and a thatched roof, Nonesuch Farm provides a stunning combination of modern contemporary design blended seamlessly with the traditional brick elevations, all with an exemplary finish throughout. Highlights include;\n\nThe present owners have spent a great deal of time and care restoring, extending and refurbishing Nonesuch Farm to an exceptionally high standard whilst retaining many original features and introducing a stylish contemporary finish throughout.\n\nUpon entering the house through a welcoming entrance hall, you are greeted by an elegant drawing room featuring a wood burning stove, set in a stone fire place. A small step leads from the hall to the kitchen/dining room, it features bespoke handmade units and an Everhot, and serves as a superb space for both entertaining and relaxed family living with access to terraces on both sides of the property.\n\nContinuing from the kitchen, a cosy playroom leads through to a fully glazed modern extension which blends seamlessly with the original house and with large glazed windows overlooking the gardens and beyond.\n\nThe generous master bedroom, with its vaulted ceilings and exposed beams, enjoys triple-aspect views of the gardens and the picturesque countryside. Additionally, there are three more bedrooms and two family bathrooms.\n\nBeautifully landscaped and meticulously maintained, the garden consists of lush lawns, swathes of wildflowers and well-stocked flower, shrub, and tree borders.\n\nThe adjoining barn conversion spans two floors, with the upper floor extending the length of the building. This space boasts exposed beams, timber floors, abundant natural light, and panoramic views through large windows on either end. The ground floor comprises an entry hall, Kitchen cloakroom and shower room, making it an ideal space for an annexe or entertaining guests. There is also a large space suitable for a variety of uses, currently used as a workshop and previously as an artist studio or games room."
