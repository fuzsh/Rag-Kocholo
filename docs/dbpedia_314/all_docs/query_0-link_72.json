        "text": "Visit the Sights of Wiltshire\n\n(So Much History To See For Free!)\n\nWhether you’re on a day trip from London or touring around the south of England, put the sights of Wiltshire on your itinerary – there’s so much history to see (and lots to do for free). Visit the World Heritage Sites, enjoy a stroll around the prehistoric plains or a walk through the greenest of countryside, and then head over to a medieval town for lunch in a typical Wiltshire pub.\n\nAre you a fan of the outdoors, history and all things picturesque? Follow the footsteps of a local family and discover the charms of Wiltshire.\n\nTable of Content\n\nGeneral Advice For Visiting Wiltshire\n\nMarlborough\n\nAvebury, Silbury Hill and West Kennet Long Barrow\n\nSalisbury\n\nStonehenge\n\nHistoric Sites to Visit in Wiltshire (Apart From Stonehenge)\n\nAuthored by Oli Harris.\n\nA confession, before I moved to Wiltshire in 2013, I had never even visited the county, let alone thought about living in it. However, in that same year, I started travelling to Marlborough for work, and began to fall in love with the place. Therefore, what I write here may come across as a little biased, but I won’t hide away from the fact that I am very much a Wiltshire fan.\n\nWhere is Wiltshire?\n\nIn simple terms Wiltshire is around 70 miles west of London, on the way to Wales. To make that journey by car will take roughly an hour and a half, and the train from London Paddington is not too different, destinations can include Great Bedwyn, Pewsey, Westbury and Salisbury.\n\nGeneral Advice For Visiting Wiltshire\n\nI would generally recommend visiting in the summer. There is so much to do in Wiltshire but the majority of it is outdoors, and some of the scenery would be best seen in the warmth under the summer sun rather than bearing the full force of an icy winter wind.\n\nIn terms of travel, yes, there are lots of train stations and GWR runs a pretty good service from London and Reading, but I think a car is a bit easier. Some of the places I really love and will detail are not that friendly for public transport. It is a rural county, so buses are not that frequent and unreliable, so use a car if you can.\n\nWear some appropriate footwear. There is so much to see, but a lot of it requires a bit of walking around, which is wonderful but not so cool if you are wearing inappropriate shoes. So have a think about what is comfortable just in case you want to keep wandering!\n\nSo with those three simple tips in the bag, here are some places I recommend you visiting, which won’t cost you anything.\n\nMarlborough\n\nMarlborough has a really nice vibe. Probably most famous for being home to celebrity boarding school, Marlborough College, this rural market town is basically one very long and wide high street, with a variety of shops and cafés housed in half-timbered buildings on either side.\n\nTwo centuries-old parish churches frame either end of the main drag, where you’ll also find the Town Hall and a couple of visitor attractions, like the historical Merchants House and Priory Gardens. As mentioned above, summer is wonderful as you can sit and drink or eat outside on a pavement terrace, watching other tourists or the locals potter about their business.\n\nPark in the high street and give yourself a couple of hours to wander around, pop into a pub if you have time, and take in the atmosphere.\n\nIf you feel like stretching your legs further, walk north from the high street towards The Common, which merges into Marlborough Golf Club. This ‘village green’ is a grassy parkland and a great place for walking, especially if you have a dog with you. The views from here are quite something.\n\nAvebury, Silbury Hill and West Kennet Long Barrow\n\nAvebury Henge\n\nAbout 4-5 miles from Marlborough is World Heritage Site Avebury, and the associated ancient sites of Silbury Hill and the West Kennet Long Barrow. It’s definitely a worthwhile place to visit in the UK. Without going into too much detail, Avebury is just staggering and is one of very few remaining examples of an original henge. The stones that remain are massive, imposing and really quite impressive.\n\nI am not spiritual in any way but if you approach Avebury from the south, walking along a line of stones known as ‘The Avenue’, when you get to the beginning of the stone circles a change in mood and atmosphere is felt – there’s something kind of different about this place which is hard to explain.\n\nAlthough it can get busy with tourists, Avebury Ring is 100% worth a visit. The visitor centre, café, shop and a pub are nearby, and there is also ample parking, plenty of toilets and facilities.\n\nSilbury Hill\n\nBack towards Marlborough is the world’s largest manmade mound in Europe, Silbury Hill. It is an incredible giant lump in the landscape, which is clearly visible for miles around. You can either park right next to it and have a look from the viewing point, or walk from Avebury through ‘The Avenue’ into the next field and over the hill. From the top of this hill you’ll get an amazing view over this mysterious prehistoric landmark which may once have been a sacred ceremonial site.\n\nHowever, no one really knows why Silbury Hill was built (probably around 2400 BC), but it took a couple of hundred years of hard labour and it’s still standing centuries later despite excavations. The hill was mined with tunnels in an attempt to discover the secrets within, but it appears to be nothing more than chalk and earth, despite people assuming that some sort of treasure might be buried in there.\n\nAvebury and Silbury Hill – Visitor Information\n\n* Free Entry\n\n* Open during daylight hours\n\n* Carpark fee (Free for National Trust members)\n\n* Toilet facilities near Alexander Keiller Museum\n\n* Dogs should be kept on a leash\n\nWest Kennet Long Barrow\n\nSo it might seem a bit odd adding a burial plot to a list of things to see in Wiltshire, but hear me out. This is a really old, important burial plot. It is also kind of creepy to walk inside but is worth doing and kids love it. A long barrow is essentially a covered, manmade cave type thing that was used a burial site. The one at West Kennet is in great condition and has a colourful history. It’s very close to Silbury Hill and you can park up, walk through the fields and up a gentle slope towards the ancient monument.\n\nAgain, a slightly odd feeling prevails as you approach and enter the stone chamber… but I imagine prehistoric burial sites do that to you. Again, amazing to think this thing was constructed so long ago, and has seen so much history (remains are said to date back to 3670 BC). There aren’t many of these barrows in the country, and certainly not in this exceptional state of conservation. Do check out these Neolithic beauties, they are truly treasures of our land, and should be appreciated, but moreover, their existence should be publicised!\n\nWest Kennet Long Barrow – Visitor Information\n\n* Free Entry\n\n* Open during daylight hours\n\n* Free parking at the A4 layby (signposted)\n\n* Toilet facilities near Museum in Avebury\n\n* Only assistance dogs allowed\n\nSalisbury\n\nMany of you will have heard of, and likely visited Salisbury if you are in this part of the world. Driving about 45 minutes southwest from Marlborough, one of England’s most picturesque cities has lots to do, and plenty to see.\n\nIdeally, you will start at the iconic Salisbury Cathedral. Not only is it a fine example of a Gothic religious building (dates to 1220) it is bursting at the seams with history. This grand Anglican temple is the home of Britain’s famous Magna Carta, which underpins the freedoms we live with today and is perhaps the most important document in our island’s history.\n\nWithin the cathedral walls also lives the world’s oldest working clock (any other clocks feel free to challenge this, I’m quoting from memory). I can’t quite figure out how the mechanism works but it looks pretty unique and is one of a number of pieces inside the cathedral that you can gaze upon as you walk around the naves.\n\nYou are welcome to join a religious service inside Salisbury Cathedral but will need to buy a ticket for a tourist visit. They have a nice little café there too, and wonderful grounds – a sunny, summer day here in the Cathedral Close is beautiful, but busy. Try to visit early if you are going to make the trip.\n\nI enjoy simply sauntering around Salisbury, and leave the agenda behind a bit. There is a lot to stumble upon, and as such a day wandering the streets, popping into artisan shops and eateries, and sitting in the grounds of the cathedral is very pleasant indeed. Just a couple of minutes away, we had a great lunch at Cosy Club, a restaurant which has an eclectic feel and varied menu, and had a lovely couple of pints in The Haunch of Venison, a place that really echoes the historic feel of the whole city.\n\nBlackmore Copse\n\nBlackmore Copse is some 6 miles east of Salisbury and makes a lovely woodland walk if the weather is fine. Paths wind through the nature reserve which belongs to the Woodland Trust, where you’ll glimpse deer wandering among the giant oaks and ancient ash, or drinking from the ponds. Wildflowers cover the wooded slopes attracting butterflies which add even more colour to the forest landscape.\n\nThoughts On Wiltshire\n\nI’ve missed off a few places, not least Stonehenge, but the above are locations I can genuinely say you will enjoy yourself, and there is a lot to do for free. Wiltshire has left a mark on me that I never imagined it would be able to… I am a city boy after all.\n\nIf you are a fan of the outdoors, history and all things picturesque, I believe you won’t have any better day out than a stress-free jaunt to Wiltshire. If it can charm me, it will charm you, so please give this part of England a try!\n\nOli Harris lives in Wiltshire. Founder of The SportingBlog, he loves exploring with his dog Hershel, his humans Jasper and Harley, and wife Chloe.\n\nCurrently Oli is curating a series of pieces that focus on the relationship between Sport and Fashion.\n\nStonehenge – Ancient Wonder of The World\n\nAlthough a fee is charged to visit Stonehenge World Heritage Site, you can clearly see the Neolithic stone rings from surrounding common land. A network of footpaths cross Salisbury Plain making it easy to walk there too.\n\nFrom Woodhenge carpark, a circular route takes in some fascinating sights, such as Durrington Walls (the biggest henge in the UK) and Woodhenge itself (an ancient timber circle ringed by a ditch), before reaching the Stonehenge megaliths some 2.5 miles away. The last stretch runs along ‘The Avenue’ embankment, the original ceremonial entrance to Britain’s most famous UNESCO monument. Finally, head over to Stonehenge Curcus before tracking back to your car. If you’re using public transport, start the walk in Amesbury, a historic town which is nearby.\n\nStonehenge Entrance Fees\n\nStonehenge is due to reopen to visitors on April 12th, 2021. There is currently a limit on visitors and booking is required in advance.\n\nPrices: Adults £19.50; Kids aged 5-17 £11.70; Students & over 65s £17.60; Entrance is free for members of the English Heritage and National Trust.\n\nA daytrip to Wiltshire is hardly enough time to see the historical sights and natural landscapes of this charming county in south England.
