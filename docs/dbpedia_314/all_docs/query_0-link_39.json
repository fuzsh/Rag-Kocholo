        "text": "Wiltshire Lawn Mower Dealers\n\nWiltshire lawn mower dealers offering a range of lawn mower and garden machinery services including Sales, Service, Repair, Spares and Parts. Wiltshire Lawn Mower Dealers can be found in major cities and towns of Wiltshire as well as across the more rural areas of the county.\n\nSearch for Lawn Mower Dealers in Wiltshire using our Dealer Finder\n\nAbout Lawn Mowers\n\nCylinder mowers can be electric, petrol powered or simply hand pushed. The blades rotate vertically like a cylinder against a bottom blade and this gives a scissor-like cut and a well manicured lawn. These mowers are perfect for level lawns where a really fine, short cut is required. They come with a variety of cutting widths, rollers for a striped effect and detachable grass collection boxes so you can choose whether or not to collect the clippings.\n\nRotary – Rotary mowers are extremely versatile and cope with most types of lawn and rougher grassy areas or difficult, sloping banks. Choose from either electric or petrol driven models and either manual push or self-propelled.\n\nIf you have a big area to mow or you have difficulty in pushing a lawnmower, then a self-propelled model is definitely worth considering although it might be slightly more expensive. On a rotary mower the blades rotate horizontally at the selected cutting height and the grass is thrown out at the back into a grass collection box. If you don't want to collect the clippings you simply take the box off.\n\nHover – Hover mowers are rotary mowers that literally hover over the surface of the grass. Generally without wheels, some models do now have rear wheels to make it easier to move them into position prior to use. However, as most models need to be carried, this has led to their lightweight design. The handle folds so the machine can be hung from a shed or garage wall making them extremely space efficient too.\n\nA hover mower is ideal for small to medium gardens, while a bigger model could cope with a medium to large lawn – although the trailing cable will always be a nuisance. Some models come with an integrated grass collection box. If you want to keep your lawn neat and tidy, then a hover mower will do a great job but if you want a high quality cut then it's not the best choice.\n\nAbout Wiltshire\n\nWiltshire is a ceremonial county in South West England. It contains the unitary authority of Swindon and covers 3,485 km2 (861,000 acres). The ancient county town was Wilton, but since 1930 Wiltshire County Council and its successor Wiltshire Council (from 2009) have been based at Trowbridge.\n\nWiltshire is characterised by its high downland and wide valleys. Salisbury Plain is famous as the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks and as the main training area in the UK of the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its medieval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere.\n\nWiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK.\n\nThe local nickname for Wiltshire natives is moonrakers. This originated from a story of smugglers who managed to foil the local Excise men by hiding their alcohol, possibly French brandy in barrels or kegs, in a village pond. When confronted by the excise men they raked the surface in order to conceal the submerged contraband with ripples and claimed that they were trying to rake in a large round cheese visible in the pond, really a reflection of the full moon. The officials took them for simple yokels or mad and left them alone allowing them to continue with their illegal activities. Many villages claim the tale for their own village pond, but the story is most commonly linked with The Crammer in Devizes\n\nTwo thirds of Wiltshire, a mostly rural county, lies on chalk, a kind of soft, white, porous limestone that is resistant to erosion, giving it a high chalk downland landscape. This chalk is part of the Southern England Chalk Formation that underlies large areas of Southern England from the Dorset Downs in the west to Dover in the east. The largest area of chalk in Wiltshire is Salisbury Plain, a semi-wilderness used mainly for arable agriculture and by the British Army as training ranges. The highest point in the county is the Tan Hill–Milk Hill ridge in the Pewsey Vale, just to the north of Salisbury Plain, at 295 m (968 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe chalk uplands run northeast into West Berkshire in the Marlborough Downs ridge and southwest into Dorset as Cranborne Chase. Cranborne Chase, which straddles the border, has yielded much Stone Age and Bronze Age archaeology. The Marlborough Downs are part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, a 1,730 km2 (668 square mile) conservation area.\n\nIn the northwest of the county, on the border with South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset the underlying rock is the resistant oolite limestone of the Cotswolds. Part of the Cotswolds is also in Wiltshire, in the county's northwestern corner.\n\nBetween the areas of chalk and limestone downland are clay valleys and vales. The largest of these vales is the Avon Vale. The Avon cuts diagonally through the north of the county, flowing through Bradford on Avon and into Bath and Bristol. The Vale of Pewsey has been cut through the chalk into Greensand and Oxford Clay in the centre of the county. In the south west of the county is the Vale of Wardour. The southeast of the county lies on the sandy soils of the northernmost area of the New Forest.\n\nChalk is a porous rock so the chalk hills have little surface water. The main settlements in the county are therefore situated at wet points. Salisbury is situated between the chalk of Salisbury Plain and marshy flood plains."
