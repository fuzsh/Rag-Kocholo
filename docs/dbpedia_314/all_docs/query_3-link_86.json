        "text": "Fine & Country are delighted to have agreed the sale of The Fields. Benefitting from a highly successful lifestyle business, with scope to expand, this beautifully presented four-bedroom detached, family home sits within a private, circa 5 acre plot within the popular village of Broad Town.\n\nSeller Insight:\n\nWhat is your favourite room of the house and why?\n\nWe love our new kitchen diner - a great social and entertaining space, with views of our animals, land and beyond up to the Ridge.\n\nWho do you think would be the next ideal owner?\n\nThe Fields could suit so many buyers - families, couples, animal & countryside lovers, etc. We think of particular appeal, is countryside living, but with easy access to the shops and services in Royal Wootton Bassett plus proximity to Marlborough, Cirencester, Cotswold Water Park and beyond.\n\nWhat do you love most about the house and why?\n\nWe love the space here and the fact our land wraps around the house. The stars are often lovely here on a clear evening. We love the view up to the Ridge too. We also find we can frequently go for a 5 or 6 mile run or walk (straight from the property on to a quiet lane and bridleways) and not see a single other person!!!\n\nWhat do you love about the local community?\n\nThere is a thriving community in Broad Town with lots of village activities. We have the fabulous Broad Town Brewery which is just a five minute walk away and such a fab, welcoming place, with visiting street food vendors most weekends - we have met so many neighbours here, it's a brilliant community asset! We also love our immediate community, with everyone being so friendly - from help at lambing time, to occasional street parties and informal gatherings.\n\nHow easy is it to commute from here?\n\nSuper easy - I regularly commute to the London office, with Swindon station being c. 15 minutes away and under an hour to Paddington. It's also great that we're less than 10 minutes drive to the M4.\n\nWhat made you choose this property over others that were available at the time?\n\nWe loved the land which has enabled us to build up a menagerie of animals (alpacas, sheep, Pygmy goats and chickens). The location is great, with access to miles of trails, bridleways and footpaths from our doorstep! The cycling is also very good around here too, with the ride to Marlborough for brunch being a beautiful 10 miles each way! A particular highlight was also the swimming pool (which is now heated) - fab for a post work swim or to chill out at the weekend! After exploring the property, outbuildings, grounds and location, we thought it would be a fab spot for a Glamping site, which we set up in our first year here - the site has gone down a storm with guests, with lots of amazing feedback on the site and location and several fully booked seasons since!\n\nAccommodation Summary:\n\nGround Floor:\n\nThe sleek and stylish kitchen/breakfast room has been fitted with ample storage options and smart integrated appliances including a coffee machine, microwave, dishwasher and ovens with an additional plate warming tray. Three sets of bi-fold doors open out onto the wrap-around gardens and outdoor seating areas and allow panoramic views over the surrounding grounds from all viewpoints. During the summer months, the doors can be open to the gardens allowing a fabulous flow between inside and out. In the colder months, there is a further, more relaxed seating area to enjoy a peaceful moment in front of the log burner.\n\nThe useful utility/boot room includes a newly fitted shower, Belfast sink, space for white goods and further storage cupboards. The generous, dual-aspect principal reception room can be found at the front of the property. Also located on the ground floor are two of the guest bedrooms, cinema room and the newly fitted family bathroom.\n\nFirst Floor:\n\nLocated on the first floor are the master and principal guest bedrooms. The guest bedroom is a spacious double room with fitted wardrobes and space to add an ensuite bathroom if required. The impressive master bedroom has an ensuite shower room, multiple built-in wardrobes and sliding doors which allow access onto the wrap-around balcony where you can enjoy the beautiful, uninterrupted views over the private grounds and surrounding rolling countryside towards the Ridgeway.\n\nOutside:\n\nThe Annexe:\n\nLocated within the grounds, the annexe can be accessed via the main gates, or independently through the side gates and offers additional accommodation ideal for guests, a holiday let or live-in staff. Set away from the main house and with general accommodation including a sitting room with kitchen area, principal bedroom, shower room, and a second large bedroom, the annexe presents endless possibilities for hosting or letting.\n\nGardens:\n\nThe private gardens wrap around the main house and feature an array of mature trees and beautifully maintained, level lawns. There are multiple outdoor seating areas, ideal for outdoor dining allowing you to follow the sun throughout the day and into the evening. The heated swimming pool is discreetly positioned just behind the main house and is the perfect place for relaxing in the summer with a cool drink in hand.\n\nOutbuildings:\n\nA highly successful lifestyle business currently operates from The Fields. Included within the grounds are two heated shower blocks with separate shower cubicles and washing facilities, a separate walk-in shower room suitable for wheelchair access, a large outdoor barn with firepit, two large double garages with additional double carport, two stables with a separate tack room and feed store and an enclosed hay store.\n\nGrounds:\n\nSurrounding the outbuildings and main house, the level grounds at The Fields have been divided into separate grazing paddocks with smart post and rail fencing. To the front and side of the property are two sets of electric gates which allow access to the large parking areas. The grounds are fully enclosed by mature hedging.\n\nPlanning Permission:\n\nIn addition, planning permission has recently been granted to build a further two bedroom, detached residential annexe which will sit within the front gardens and can be accessed via the front gates.\n\nApplication reference - PL/2023/10171\n\nLocation:\n\nBroad Town is a well-situated village, just 2 miles from the town of Royal Wootton Bassett, on the edge of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and within easy reach of the M4 and the mainline railway station at Swindon, with direct services to London Paddington taking around 50 minutes.\n\nThe Broad Town Brewery microbrewery has The Hop Chapel and The Hop Gardens, serving a range of ales and beers and serving street food. The Crown Inn in the neighbouring village of Broad Hinton can break up an evening stroll, and there are a much wider range of eateries, shops and amenities just 2 miles away in Royal Wootton Bassett. The thriving market town of Marlborough is also within easy reach, offering a high street full of boutique shops and alongside larger national retailers such as Waitrose.\n\nThe area is steeped in history dating back to Neolithic times, with some significant sites at nearby Avebury and West Kennet Long Barrow and the iron age hill fort at Barbury Castle, which has stunning panoramic views of the surrounding area. The Ridgeway national trail which runs through Barbury Castle is one of many excellent footpaths, bridlepaths, and trails to be explored, whether that be on foot, horseback, or bicycle. Footpaths and bridleways can be accessed directly from the property.\n\nBroad Town itself offers a primary school, with secondary provision at nearby Royal Wootton Basset Academy, which has been rated as 'Outstanding' by Ofsted.\n\nLocal Authority: Wiltshire, Band G\n\nServices: Mains electricity, water & drainage, oil fired central heating. Broadband mobile 4G."
