The parish includes the hamlet of Thornhill and the farming hamlet of Cotmarsh.\n\nSince 1996 the village and surrounding landscape have been the subject of an archaeological project supported by the University of Bath, Swindon College and QinetiQ Archaeology. Results have been published in a number of journals and a final report is anticipated in 2015/2016.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics"
