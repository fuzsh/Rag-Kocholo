        "text": "Samuel R. Delany (born April 1, 1942, New York, New York, U.S.) is an American science-fiction novelist and critic whose highly imaginative works address sexual, racial, and social issues, heroic quests, and the nature of language.\n\nDelany attended City College of New York (part of City University of New York) in the early 1960s. His first novel, The Jewels of Aptor, was published in 1962. Babel-17 (1966), the story of an artist-outsider, explores the nature of language and its ability to give structure to experience. Delany won the science-fiction Nebula Award for this book, which established his reputation, and for The Einstein Intersection (1967), which features a similar protagonist and addresses issues of cultural development and sexual identity, a theme more fully developed in the author’s later works.\n\nDhalgren (1975) is the story of a young bisexual man searching for identity in a large decaying city. In Triton (1976; later retitled Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia), Delany uses the protagonist, Bron Helstrom, to examine gender and sexual identity and to question whether any utopia can exist. Delany’s Nevèrÿon series (Tales of Nevèrÿon [1979]; Neveryóna; or, The Tale of Signs and Cities [1983]; Flight from Nevèrÿon [1985]; and The Bridge of Lost Desire [1987]) is set in a magical past at the beginning of civilization. These tales concern power and its abuse while addressing events contemporary to their publication, such as the AIDS epidemic.\n\nDelany’s complex Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand (1984) was regarded by critics as a stylistic breakthrough. His subsequent novels include Dark Reflections (2007), which portrays an aging gay Black poet as he lives through successes and disappointments, and Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders (2012). He also wrote the novella “Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-precious Stones” (1969) and the autobiographical Atlantis: Three Tales (1995), a collection of novellas recounting the experiences of young African American artists.\n\nDelany’s other autobiographical books include The Motion of Light in Water: Sex and Science Fiction Writing in the East Village, 1957–1965 (1988), about his childhood and the beginning of his writing career, which won a Hugo Award; and Bread & Wine: An Erotic Tale of New York (1999), a memoir in graphic-novel format about his relationship with a white homeless man. Times Square Red, Times Square Blue (1999) presents Delany’s personal experience of the gentrification of Times Square in New York City. In 2000 he published 1984: Selected Letters, a collection of correspondence with a friend in which he writes about his personal life and on such diverse topics as the Internal Revenue Service and AIDS. In Search of Silence: The Journals of Samuel R. Delany, Vol. 1, 1957–1969 was published in 2017, and The Atheist in the Attic (2018) collects a novella, an essay, and an interview.\n\nDelany’s works on writing include The Jewel-Hinged Jaw: Notes on the Language of Science Fiction (1977), a groundbreaking critical analysis of science fiction, and About Writing: Seven Essays, Four Letters, and Five Interviews (2005). When asked whether he considered himself a “genre writer,” Delany told The Paris Review in 2011 that\n\nI think of myself as someone who thinks largely through writing. Thus I write more than most people, and I write in many different forms. I think of myself as the kind of person who writes, rather than as one kind of writer or another."
