        "text": "Major works:\n\nBabel-17 • Nova • Dhalgren • Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand\n\n“A rocket launch, a phoenix reborn, a new Delany novel—three wonderful, fiery events.”\n\n—Ursula K. Le Guin\n\n“You know how life and real history is always more complex and fractal than fiction can manage? Delany manages it. He does the thing where his science fictional innovations have second and third order consequences, where they interlock and give you worldviews. . . . Reading Delany is like pop rocks for the brain. He scintillates. Things sparkle and explode all over, and it’s not entirely comfortable but it is quite wonderful.”\n\n—Jo Walton, Tor.com\n\nBenefits of Using Safe Crypto Casinos.
