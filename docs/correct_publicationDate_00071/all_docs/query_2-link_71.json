        "text": "In the interstices between new posts, you get more of this . . .\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Nova, Samuel R. Delany, 1968.\n\nAfter reading this novel, I can understand why, in the sixties, Delany had the literary fame he did. Again, in its poetic language and depiction of a subculture intimately linked to its machines. In William Gibson, it is computer cowboys. Here it is the jacks nearly everyone has to link to all kinds of machines. Delany, as in his Babel-17, reminded me of William Gibson, and an interview with Gibson I recently came across confirmed that influence.\n\nDelany does a lot of things in this novel: poetic descriptions, intriguing characters (the metaphor of a Net for human civilization and the character of Mouse reminded me of the vaguely remembered The Net by Loren J. MacGregor), an adventure tale, speculation on human culture and political and social trends, and, like Babel-17, also presents some ruminations on art – particularly the aesthetics of the novel.\n\nIn the poetry department, Delany eschews precise technical description (for instance, when describing Prince’s prosthetic arm) for suggestion and mood. He also never exactly describes Tyy and Sebastian’s pets.\n\nThe characters were all interesting: the intuitive, spontaneous artist Mouse (his sensory-syrnyx is so typical, in its modulation of light, sound, and odor, of sixties’ interest in multi-sensory, psychedelic art); the overly introspective and planning – yet brilliant – would be author Katrin (tt was a nice touch to reveal, in a bit of self-referentialism, that the novel is, in fact, the novel he always is talking of writing and prepares for with thousands of notes), the tarot reading Tyy; the twins (actually triplets who long to be reunited with their missing brother) Idas and Lynceos; and the compelling triumvirate of the obsessive Lorq von Ray, Prince and his sister, Ruby Red.\n\nLorq von Ray comes across as generally likeable, but his obsessive plans to harvest the power source Illyrion from a nova seem callous and egotistical when he explains the social and political consequences of finding it. Yet, he can also be seen as advancing history and the human condition (what economists would call creative destruction) even though it’s for personal ego gratification. The Prince, seeming psychotic that he is, can be seen as defender of the stagnant status quo. There is a definite sexual attraction between Ruby Red and von Ray but that doesn’t stop her from trying to kill him (the novel’s quest/adventure plot is paced in very unexpected ways). Though Delany does not say it, I got the sense there was an unspoken sexual attraction of Prince for his sister. Their dispute with von Ray stems from them regarding von Ray as the inferior heir of a fortune based on the piracy of von Ray’s grandfather.\n\nAs an adventure tale, I was interested in the story though it is paced oddly with many scenes taking place on worlds before the final encounter with the Prince, Ruby Red, and the nova begins. That encounter does not take up nearly as much room as it probably would if another author wrote this tale. Delany shows a command of astrophysics (though I confess I don’t know what astrophysics involving novae consisted of in 1968), but he doesn’t let a knowledge of hard science stop him from speculating on a vastly expanded table of periodic elements or the reality of Tarot.\n\nDelany, mainly through Katrin (though he is the “author” of Nova, I can’t think his stalling, preparations and note-taking make him a surrogate for the prolific Delany), expands on theories of history, literature (including the statements that a novel should reflect its time’s theory of history and that good characterization is done through habitual, purposeful, and gratuitous actions), and society. I found especially interesting his idea that twentieth century man is alienated because his “work” so seldom leads to tangible, productive ends."
