        "text": "Our Author of the Month for October 2023 is the American novelist and literary critic Samuel R. Delany. He is most celebrated for his Science Fiction novels, notably Babel-17, Nova and Dhalgren, and has been the recipient of four Nebula and three Hugo Awards. Densely imagistic and fraught with symbolism, his books explore themes of sexuality, mythology and social exclusion and have been widely admired both within and outside the Science Fiction community: Umberto Eco once wrote of him ‘I consider Delany not only one of the most important writers of the present generation, but a fascinating writer in general who has invented a new style.‘ Start with Babel-17, the intergalactic epic that catapulted him to fame, his action-packed space opera Nova or the definitive collection of his short fiction Driftglass, featuring amongst other things neutered space travellers, telepathy, Hells Angels and genetically modified amphibious workers.\n\nHave a look at some of his titles here, or come and visit a selection of them at the Bookshop throughout October."
