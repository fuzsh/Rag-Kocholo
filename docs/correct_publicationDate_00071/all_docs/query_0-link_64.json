        "text": "\"Dark Reflections is one of the most honest books I've ever read about the martyrdom of the writer in the contemporary world. Samuel Delany, who has entertained readers for decades with his rich fantasies, now gives us the truth and nothing but the truth. At certain points, I wanted to put this book down because it was so sad--but I couldn't because I was so engrossed by its spare beauty and its searing frankness.\"\n\n--Edmund White\n\n\"The background is unusually dense, as always with Delany, with layers and implied further layers and texture. There are multiple cultures, even within the one side of the conflict we see, there are people of all colours, shapes and sizes and social classes. There are castes and classes, there’s also the sense that working people actually work, with a notion of things they actually do. There’s also body modification for fashion and lifestyle reasons (solid roses growing from your shoulder, like a tattoo) that have social significance as class and status markers. . . . If Babel-17 were published now as a new book, I think it would strike us an great work that was doing wonderful things and expanding the boundaries of science fiction. I think we’d nominate it for awards and talk a lot about it. It’s almost as old as I am, and I really think it would still be an exciting significant book if it were new now.\"\n\n--Jo Walton, What Makes This Book So Great\n\n\"Samuel R. Delany, right now, as of this book, Nova, not as of some future book or some accumulated body of work, is the best science-fiction writer in the world, at a time when competition for that status is intense. I don’t see how a science fiction writer can do more than wring your heart while explaining how it works. No writer can. The special thing that science fiction does is to first credibly place the heart in an unconventional environment. A particular thing that recent science fiction has been doing is to make that unconventional environment a technological one. Another has been to make it a romantic one, sometimes calling it an intensely humanistic one . . . All of these things are accomplished in Nova.\"\n\n--A.J. Budrys, Galaxy Magazine\n\n​\n\n\"One of the most complete and fully realized pictures of an interstellar society that I have ever read.\"\n\n--Norman Spinrad, Science Fiction Times\n\n\"A very moving, intensely fascinating literary [auto]biography from an extraordinary writer. Thoroughly admirable candor and luminous stylistic precision; the artist as a young man and a memorable picture of an age.\"\n\n--William Gibson\n\n​\n\n\"Absolutely central to any consideration of black manhood. . . . Delany's vision of the necessity for total social and political transformation is revolutionary.\"\n\n--Hazel Carby, Race Men\n\n​\n\n\"The prose of The Motion of Light in Water often has the shimmering beauty of the title itself. . . . This book is invaluable gay history.\"\n\n--Inches Magazine"
